<h2><span class="mw-headline"> First Launch Attempt </span></h2>
<div class="afjmet"><span class="afjwhen">-001:22:00</span> (20:30EST)</div>
	<p class="afjpao"><span class="afjwho">Launch Control:</span> This is Apollo Saturn launch control. We're at T minus 1 hour 22 minutes and counting. Cabin purge has now been completed and the boost protective cover has been closed. The 65 percent nitrogen 35 percent oxygen mixture will now be enriched to a 60-40 mixture at liftoff. Just completed were some preflight command tests with the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston. These tests are to insure that Houston can send commands, and that they are being received on or by the launch vehicle. Also just completed was a first motion signal. This is the first motion of the vehicle as it lifts off the pad. A test signal is sent to the eastern test range and to the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston to assure that they will get this signal at liftoff. Also, we just received a final go for a Jimsphere release. The Jimsphere is a weather balloon which is the final weather balloon to go up before launch indicating the wind direction.</p>
	<p class="afjpao"><span class="afjwho">Launch Control:</span> C-band beacons are in check at this time. The C-band beacons aboard the launch vehicle are used in tracking. They give indications of range velocity during the power phase of flight. Que ball sim command was just sent. The que ball is an angle of a tacmeter which is perched above the launch escape system, and it's read by the spacecraft commander in the spacecraft. It would indicate any deviation from the plan flight through. It reads zero as it sits on the pad and during the test a simulated command is sent to it, and Gene Cernan in the spacecraft reads off what he is reading in the spacecraft during that sim command. The checks in the spacecraft continue to run somewhat ahead of schedule. The spacecraft test conductor Skip Shovin indicated their running ahead and looking good to which Cernan reply we're looking good up here too. The countdown continuing to move along well at this time T minus 1 hour 21 minutes and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.</p>
<div class="afjmet"><span class="afjwhen">-001:12:00</span> (20:40EST)</div>
	<p class="afjpao"><span class="afjwho">Launch Control:</span> This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control 13 minus 1 hour 12 minutes and counting. At this time Spacecraft Commander Gene Cernan and the Spacecraft test conductor Skip Chauvin are going over some command checks. During these checks the Spacecraft Commander actually gimbles or moves, swings the main engine in the Service Module. He does this using his flight hand controller and this is a system which is done so that if there is a problem with the computer which normally flies these, he can take over and manually fly it. Normally, however, all burns of this engine are done by the computer. Out at the pad, the space vehicle is surrounded by searchlights producing some 225 foot candles of light, a total of 72 20 kilowatt zeon lights and 2 60 kilowatt zeon searchligh banks provide this illumination. At liftoff, approximately 7500 foot candles will be produced from the flame of the Saturn V first stage engines. This is almost equivalent to daylight. Searchlights will also illuminate the Apollo 17 for the first 60 feet of it's flight. Countdown continuing to go smoothly now as we approach the 1 hour mark. T minus 1 hour 11 minutes and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.</p>
<div class="afjmet"><span class="afjwhen">-001:00:00</span></div>
	<p class="afjpao"><span class="afjwho">Launch Control:</span> This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're at T minus 1 hour and counting. T minus 1 hour and counting. Just completed were the C-band beacon checks. These are checks of the beacons, two of them aboard the instrument unit of the space vehicle. These are used in conjunction with C-band radar here at Kennedy Space Center to check the space vehicle during powered phase of flight. A check was just made with the superintendent of range operations who ran through the camera coverage looking at the weather around the various areas to see what camera coverage, and that appears to be satisfactory. Meanwhile, at the pad, the closeout crew has completed securing the white room area, and they are clearing the pad area themselves at this time. Just before they left, they indicated to Cernan that they were completed their jobs going back away from the pad area. Cernan said "We'll see you when we get back." The pad leader responded that "The next face you see had better be a frogman or you're in trouble." The weather appears to be satisfactory. We've been tracking some local buildups, but at this time they're just - they do not seem to be posing any problem for an on-time launch at 9:53 p.m. EST. Now, T minus 59 minutes, 32 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.</p>
<div class="afjmet"><span class="afjwhen">-000:55:00</span> (20:57EST)</div>
	<p class="afjpao"><span class="afjwho">Launch Control:</span> This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We are at T-55 minutes 54 seconds and counting. Stoney, astronaut Bob Parker, the capsule communicator here in the firing room who has a variety of of functions during this mission; one of which is to set the elevators at the 320 foot level. He actually commands the elevators which are part of the egress system, emergency egress system, for the astronauts. He has just reported that the elevators have now been set at the 320 foot level. In an emergency the crew could come out of their spacecraft into these elevators where they would be lowered at a high speed, 600 feet per minute, to the ground floor or A level floor where they can exit from there into a variety of escape modes; one of which would be down a chute into a blast danger area or a safety area, or they could continue on out and be picked up by armored carriers. Underway at this time with the launch vehicle are some checks of the secure range safety systems aboard the vehicle. These are actually checks of the receivers in that system. A range Safety Officer could terminate the flight of Apollo 17 if it became erratic by initiating emergency cut off, or if necessary a propellant dispersion command. These systems are located on each of the flight stages. There are three stages of the Saturn V. Two receivers in each stage, and they would receive a signal from the range safety officers and then sending through them to through these receivers, they could perform the propellant dispersion. These actions, of course, will be taken only if the vehicle were so erratic that it were endangering some land areas, and of course, only after the crew had used one of the escape options open to them. The test going well at this time. Our countdown continuing T-54 minutes 6 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.</p>
<div class="afjmet"><span class="afjwhen">-000:50:00</span> (21:02EST)</div>
	<p class="afjpao"><span class="afjwho">Launch Control:</span> This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control at T minus 50 minutes 55 seconds and counting. Preparations are underway in the launch control center at this time for a critical power transfer test. The space vehicle at this time is being fed from an external power source, but shortly before liftoff it will be transfered to the internal flight batteries. This test is to ensure that all electrical systems aboard the vehicle function properly on the internal flight batteries. The test takes about five minutes during which time the various elements of the launch team monitor thier systems and report in then to the test supervisor, Bill Schick here in the control room that everything looks good during the test. Depending on local weather conditions the various areas around the United States, the flight of Apollo 17 will be monitored or be able to be seen by people as far as 500 miles away. This is the flight as seen of the first stage of powered flight. This would include a large portion the southeastern United States, northern tip of Cuba and the Bahama Islands. The power transfer test is now underway; first stage, second stage, third stage, instrument unit now all going to internal power. Count down continuing to go well T-minus 49 minutes 35 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Test Control.</p>
<div class="afjmet"><span class="afjwhen">-000:45:00</span> (21:06EST)</div>
	<p class="afjpao"><span class="afjwho">Launch Control:</span> This Apollo Saturn Launch Control, we're now T minus 45 minutes 55 seconds and counting. Various elements of launch team reporting in to test supervisor Bill Schick, that they experienced no problems during the power transfer. We now transfer back again to an external power source, which will feed the vehicle systems until approximately 50 seconds before liftoff, at which time the final power transfer to internal takes place. At the T minus 45 minute mark, we'll be watching for swing arm number 9. That's the swing arm which gives access to the Spacecraft to swing back to a retract position, 12 degrees back from the Spacecraft. This is a park position, a standby position, where it remain down until the final moments of the countdown. T minus 5 minutes, it swings back to the full retract position. Once it swing backs, the launch escape system aboard the a-, atop of the Spacecraft can be armed and this system could be used to pull the Astronaut crew to safety in any disaster. Now T minus 44 minutes 52 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.</p>
<div class="afjmet"><span class="afjwhen">-000:41:00</span> (21:11EST)</div>
	<p class="afjpao"><span class="afjwho">Launch Control:</span> This is Apollo Saturn - This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're at T minus 40 minutes, 51 seconds and counting. Swing arm number 9 just retracted a few minutes ago, and, as it retracted, the astronaut crew aboard the space field could feel it moving away from the spacecraft. Eugene Cernan the spacecraft commander commented, "We're really hanging out here in the breeze now." Spacecraft test conductor, referring to the weather indicated that that was just a small breeze. The launch escape system has been armed. The system now could be used to carry the astronauts to safety if necessary. It's also used during the initial phases of powered flight to carry the astronauts away in an emergency. It would fly away in a high arc pulling them to a height, enough so that their parachute systems could deploy, and they could make a normal landing. The system is about 33 feet long. The motor develops 147 thousand pounds of thrust. This is almost twice the amount of thrust of the Redstone rocket, which powered astronaut Alan Sheppard, America's first man into space. The countdown continuing to move along smoothly now. T minus 39 minutes, 36 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.</p>
<div class="afjmet"><span class="afjwhen">-000:35:00</span> (21:18EST)</div>
	<p class="afjpao"><span class="afjwho">Launch Control:</span> This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're at T-minus 35 minutes 11 seconds and counting. Spacecraft commander Gene Cernan has reported back to the spacecraft test conductor Skip Chauvin. He said you've delivered us the best now it's our turn. Thank the guys we want to see them as soon as we can when we get back and I guarantee you we'll do that. Meanwhile C-band beacon checks are going on with the space vehicle. The liquid hydrogen liquid oxygen fully aboard and being replenished at this time to ensure a full load at liftoff. Count down continuing to go smoothly as we approach the half hour mark T-minus 34 minutes 34 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.</p>

	<p class="afjpao"><span class="afjwho">Launch Control:</span> This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control T minus 30 minutes 54 seconds and counting. Manned Spacecraft just indicated to the test supervisor Bill Schick that we are go for the terminal countdown sequences. Final propulsion checks have been completed and the C-band readouts, once again repeated have been completed. Beach boss reports the launch sight recovery force helicopters are on station and ready. Digital range safety command checks are now underway as the countdown continues smoothly aiming for the T minus 30 minute mark. Now at T minus 30 minutes 24 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.</p>
<div class="afjmet"><span class="afjwhen">-000:25:00</span> (21:27EST)</div>
	<p class="afjpao"><span class="afjwho">Launch Control:</span> This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. T-25 minutes 54 seconds and counting. Command Module Pilot Ron Evans at this time has armed the reaction control system aboard the service module. He does this by allowing the hypergolic fuels to move down the lines to the engines. At this time he is reading out the temperatures, pressures and fuel quantities in that system. Our weather continues to look good. The major frontal area which had been of some concern earlier, has remained well west of the launch area also some smaller buildups which we have been monitoring do not appear to be coming close enough to cause any concern for our 9:53 PM launch time. That launch will be aiming Apollo 17 for the Taurus-Littrow area of the Moon. This area is named after the Taurus Mountains. These in southern Turkey and the Austrian astronomer, Littrow. The site is expected to yield some of the oldest and some of the youngest lunar samples returned during the Apollo flights to the Moon. Now T-24 minutes 50 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.</p>
<div class="afjmet"><span class="afjwhen">-000:20:00</span> (21:32EST)</div>
	<p class="afjpao"><span class="afjwho">Launch Control:</span> This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control T-minus 20 minutes 55 seconds and counting. Short time from now we we'll begin chilling the propulsion systems aboard the second and third stage of the Saturn V vehicle. This necessary to condition them for the flow of the super cool liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. Just a few moments ago the crew aboard spacecraft America was doing an updated weather forecast. Cernan reported I hope it's as beautiful out there as it is in here. Countdown continuing to move smoothly at T-minus 20 minutes 24 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.</p>

	<p class="afjpao"><span class="afjwho">Launch Control:</span> This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control at T-minus 10 minutes 55 seconds and counting. At this time some computer checks being run with the launch vehicle. The spacecraft has now gone to full internal power. Up to this point the spacecraft fuel cells have been sharing the power load with an external source. Also going on at this time are some checks of the astro corem circuit. This is the circuit which is used by the launch operations manager spacecraft test conductor Stony and the three astronauts at launch time. This is to ensure that they are not getting any extraneous voices or are having to listen to any of the other network which might be carrying on a conservation which they don't need at that time. Countdown proceeding smoothly T-minus 10 minutes 15 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.</p>

The Vice-President in the firing room at the launch control center, observing the final minutes of the countdown and he'll watch the launch from here. The countdown has proceeded smoothly since picking up at 11:53 A.M. this morning. Weather continues to look good as we aim toward a 9:53 P.M. Eastern Standard Time launch. Now T minus 7 minutes 37 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.</p>
<div class="afjmet"><span class="afjwhen">-000:05:45</span> (21:47EST)</div>
	<p class="afjpao"><span class="afjwho">Launch Control:</span> This is Apollo Launch Control. T-5 minutes 54 seconds and counting. At this time entering the final phases of the countdown various elements of the team reporting into Test Supervisor Bill Shick with the go no-go for launch. At launch time a water deluge system at the pad will spray water over the entire area of the pad, some 400 000 gallons of water. More than the average family would use in three years will be spread over the pad and the swing arms protecting them from the searing flames of the Saturn V first stage. Various elements reporting in now. First stage reporting they are GO. Range Safety, Superintendent Range Operations they are GO. Launch Operations Manager reports he is GO for launch. Launch Director Walter Kapryan has given a GO for launch.</p>
<div class="afjmet"><span class="afjwhen">-000:04:55</span></div>
	<p class="afjpao"><span class="afjwho">Launch Control:</span> We've passed the 5 minute mark, T-4 minutes 55 seconds and counting and swing arm No. 9 now coming back to the fully retracted position. The launch escape system setting atop the spacecraft, spacecraft named America by the crew now could pull the crew to safety if there were any problem while the vehicle remains on the pad or during the early portions of the flight. At the T-4 minute mark we'll be standing by for word from the Launch Vehicle Test Conductor Norm Carlson, giving a clear for launch for the launch vehicle ignition. At T-3 minutes 7 seconds we'll go on an automatic sequencer. It's called the terminal countdown sequencer. The astronauts on the Astro corn circuit now reporting and thanking the launch team for all their prayers and all their help.</p>
<div class="afjmet"><span class="afjwhen">-000:03:40</span></div>
	<p class="afjpao"><span class="afjwho">Launch Control:</span> T-3 minutes 55 seconds and counting. Apollo 17, the launch team wishes you good luck and God speed, reports the launch operations manager over the Astro com circuit. T-3 minutes 40 seconds, the countdown continuing to go on smoothly. Once we go on the terminal countdown sequencer, the countdown will be automatic from there on out. The countdown sequencer will initiate the various functions from that time on; however, the men here in the firing room will be monitoring their consoles, watching temperatures, pressures, various readouts. They could override that terminal sequencer if necessary. Moving up now to the time when we'll go on that terminal sequencer.</p>
<div class="afjmet"><span class="afjwhen">-000:03:10</span></div>
	<p class="afjpao"><span class="afjwho">Launch Control:</span> T-3 minutes 10 seconds and counting. Spacecraft ready light has come on indicating that the spacecraft is ready. We are now on the terminal sequencer. Launch sequence has started. The flowing of that water on the pad will begin at the 1 minute mark flowing on the flame deflector below the launch vehicle on the launch pedestal itself and along the swing arms which will be coming back at liftoff. Instrument unit ready light has come on. Emergency detection system ready light is on.</p>
<div class="afjmet"><span class="afjwhen">-000:02:30</span></div>
	<p class="afjpao"><span class="afjwho">Launch Control:</span> Ail indications are we are GO for launch as we approach the 2 minute 30 second mark. Pressurization of the various propellant tanks now aboard the space vehicle is starting. At two, our second stage liquid oxygen tanks now pressurized. These propellant tanks are pressurized with helium to insure that during the flight the fuel flows properly down through the engine. It's quiet here in the firing room now as the men are monitoring their consoles, looking at the temperatures, checking pressures and a variety of parameters to ensure everything is in a GO condition. Pressurization continuing on the fuel tanks at this time we'll go to the critical power transfer at the T-50 second mark in the count down. At that time we'll transfer external power source to the flight battery aboard the space vehicle. The final action by the crew aboard the spacecraft America will be a final guidance alignment conducted by the Spacecraft Commander Gene Cernan. The flight of Apollo 17 will be able to be seen depending on weather conditions, some 500 miles away as it goes into Earth orbit. Pressurization continuing, liquid hydrogen tanks now aboard the second stage have now been pressurized, all propellants aboard the second stage now pressurized. A cover aboard the que ball. This is the que ball system on top of the launch escape system will be pulled off just shortly before launch. First stage propellant tanks have been pressurized.</p>

<div class="afjed">[  At T-3 minutes and 7 seconds, the automatic sequencer took over. This sequencer, the oldest and most reliable piece of automation on LC-39, chose this moment in the launching of the last Apollo to cause trouble. At T-30 seconds it went into an automatic cutoff indicating that one of the essential operations leading to the launch of the space vehicle had not been properly completed. Besides halting the countdown, the cutoff started a series of "safing" procedures which included the return of swing arm 9 to a standby position. <i><a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/ch23-7.html" class="external text" title="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/ch23-7.html" rel="nofollow">Moonport</a></i> ]</div>

<p class="afjother"><span class="afjwho">Schmitt:</span> <span class="src">(Oral History 1999)</span> The one thing that you don’t want to do is have a aborted launch on a launch pad and have to recycle and come back a month later and go through another month of simulator training. You’re ready to go when you’re ready to go. And I think everybody felt that way.</p>
<p class="afjother"><span class="afjwho">Schmitt:</span> <span class="src">(Oral History 2000)</span> You certainly don't want to recycle for another month. That was the first thought we had on the launch pad when we did, in fact, have a delay, was that, well, let's hope that we don't have to go through this for another month. You would have gotten into it and done it and then never noticed the difference, but still at the immediate point of being ready to launch, you're ready to launch, there's no question about that.</p>

	<p class="afjpao"><span class="afjwho">Launch Control:</span> This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're at T minus 30 seconds and continuing our hold. The problem was with the terminal countdown sequencer, which failed to give the command to pressure, pressurize the third stage lox tank. The crew in the firing room, realizing this were seeing this happen pressurized the tank manually, but this did not happen fast enough to satisfy the automatic sequencer. As was mentioned earlier, during this sequence everything must happen at a certain time, before the next step in the sequence can take place. The next step that was to take place was the retraction of swing arm 9 and at the time that was to take place the terminal sequencer had not had an indication that the third stage lox tank had been pressurized. The plan now is to recycle to the T minus 22 minute mark in the countdown. Now this recycling procedure will take an additional 35 to 40 minutes. This still puts us well within our launch window. While we're recycling, we'll continue to review the data to determine just what the problem is and whether or not we can proceed from the T minus 22 minute mark for a launch later in the window.</p>

<p class="afjother"><span class="afjwho">Schmitt:</span> <span class="src">(Oral History 2000)</span> Somewhere in the deep dark past of computer programming, a programmer had told the final sequencing checks that the computer was going to do — to look to see if a signal to pressurize a booster oxygen tank had been sent. Not whether it had been <em>received</em> and acted upon, but had the signal been <em>sent</em>.</p>
<p class="afjother"><span class="afjwho">Schmitt:</span> <span class="src">(Oral History 2000)</span> Well, when they went through that particular point where that signal was supposed to have been sent and the tank pressurized, the signal didn't get sent. The computer didn't send the signal, but the person in the launch control center saw that that didn't happen and just pressed a button and pressurized the tank. So everything was fine, but the computer didn't know it. When they went through the final sequence, the computer saw that that signal hadn't been sent, and it said "Hold."</p>
<p class="afjother"><span class="afjwho">Schmitt:</span> <span class="src">(Oral History 2000)</span> So the computer just shut everything down. That's what you want them to do, it's just that it was programmed wrong. Garbage in, garbage out. So what they did, they actually went into the launch computers, tracked down that point and hard-wired around that particular sensor so that the next time the computer went through, it would believe that the signal had been sent. Sure enough, it believed it, and off we went. We were two hours and forty minutes late, but, nevertheless, we were on our way.

<p class="afjed">Launch director Skip (Clarence) Chauvin explained the situation to the crew. Schmitt managed to nap during the delay.</p>
<p class="afjother"><span class="afjwho">Schmitt:</span> <span class="src">(Oral History 2000)</span> Right at thirty seconds, Skip Chauvin came over the line and said we have a hold. I think Gene was more concerned than the rest of us, because none of us knew whether everything in the spacecraft and in the rocket knew we were in a hold. But we went through that thirty-second period and it was quiet for a few minutes. Then Chauvin came back on the line and said, "We have a problem with the launch computer. It's not a major problem. We're going to fix it and when we have it fixed, we'll recycle." I think it was eight minutes for a planned hold and then go through it again. That is exactly what happened.</p>
<p class="afjother"><span class="afjwho">Schmitt:</span> <span class="src">(Oral History 2000)</span> At that point I felt very comfortable. I'd worked with Skip in many chamber tests and things like that, so we knew him very well, and from the sound of his voice, it didn't sound like anything that wasn't going to be fixed. So I fell asleep. Anytime you put fans humming or a little bit of vibration, things like that, I can go to sleep. There's no problem. So I got an hour or so dozing sleep while we were waiting for that problem to be fixed.</p>

	<p class="afjpao"><span class="afjwho">Launch Control:</span> This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're remaining still in the T minus 30 second mark. We'll remain here for some period. It will take approximately 35 to 40 minutes to recycle back to T minus 22 minutes, where we'll resume the count. To explain again what has happened was we were in what was called the terminal countdown sequencer. At 3 minutes 7 seconds in the countdown we go on to an automatic system called the terminal countdown sequencer. This countdown sequencer initiates various actions, the final actions in the count. Each of these must occur on schedule and in sequence. Now what happened at this particular time was, the third stage liquid oxygen tank was not automatically pressurized as it should have been. The launch crew here in the firing room, when they saw this, manually pressurized that system, but it was too late to satisfy the sequencer. The next event in the sequence was the retraction of swing arm number 1, swing arm going over to the first stage and at that time, the sequencer did not see that the tank had been pressurized and sent an automatic cut-off. So we had an automatic cut-off at the 30 second mark. We're standing by at the 30 second mark to go back to T minus 22 minutes and we are reevaluating the problem, looking at the, what caused the sequencer not to automatically pressurize that tank, seeing what that problem is and seeing if there is a possibility if we go ahead and do this manually early in the sequence, if that will satisfy the sequencer and we can proceed. Now holding at the T minus 30 second mark in our countdown, this is Kennedy Launch Control.</p>

The T-minus 22 minute mark is chosen as the recycling point because this is the point where we start the chill down as was mentioned during that point in the countdown. We start the chill down of the second and third stages to prepare them for the influx of the liquid hydrogen, the cold liquid hydrogen and the cold liquid oxygen. This chill down has some very specific parameters and must be started at a certain time and cannot go beyond a certain time. So it's best to go back to that point in the countdown under these circumstances and to resume our countdown at the T-minus 22 minute mark. When a determination is made that we can resume. Continuing to look at the data here is see exactly what happened. There is no indication of ignition. Ignition was scheduled to come at the 8. 9 second mark. Here in the control room a number of the people were looking through the remote cameras which have the capability out at the pad of zooming in on specific areas and a number of people here were looking right at those first stage engines and there was no indication whatsoever of engine ignition. We're continuing to evaluate all the data at this time as we hold at the T-minus 30 second mark. This is Kennedy Launch Control.</p>

At this time there still has not been a resolution to the problem, but we'll continue looking at that. We could continue on counting down while this problem is looked at. To reiterate what the problem was; the terminal countdown sequencer failed to give the command to pressurize the third stage liquid oxygen tanks. The crews monitoring this function saw that that happened and immediately manually pressurized the tanks, but this did not occur in time in the sequence and when swing arm one was to retract it had not received this signal. As a consequence an automatic cutoff was sent.

Liquid hydrogen is also vented from the vehicle as there is some boil off. However, because it is quite a volital fuel it is vented through a burnpond at the side of the pad. That burnpond is at the north side of the pad and there it can be seen burning in a controlled condition at this time.

Meantime the crew is getting a variety of updates in the spacecraft, updating them on various aspects and the changes to their mission due to this hold period. Also, at the Manned Spacecraft Center they are continuing to update the flight azimuth as they get new times for the launch. Launch Operations Manager Paul Donnelly just went through quite an extensive briefing with the spacecraft test conductor to pass ¢,n to the crew what they feel the problems were and how they plan to work around it.

	<p class="afjpao"><span class="afjwho">Launch Control:</span> This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're continuing in our hold at the T minus 8 minute mark. At this time, it's been determined to take an additional 20 minutes, add an additional 20 minutes to that planned hold period. The reason for this is, the crews would like to take the work around that they have devised and at Marshall Spaceflight Center, where the Saturn V launch vehicle was developed, they have what is called a bread board or a system, which is similar to this one and run through the sequence and insure that it does operate properly. The crew aboard the spacecraft was informed of this additional 20 minute hold. They indicated that they expected to use all three stages of this Saturn V and they were happy to have the 20 minute hold if that was going to assure that all three were going to work properly. Now continuing our hold at the T minus 8 minute mark, this is Kennedy Launch Control.</p>

	<p class="afjpao"><span class="afjwho">Launch Control:</span> This is Apollo Saturn Test Control. We are continuing our hold at the T-minus 8 minute mark. The reason the T-minus 8 minute mark is chosen for this hold as mentioned earlier has to do with the chill down of the thrust chambers in the S-2 or second stage and the third stage. Both of these stages use liquid hydrogen, an extremely cold cryogenic fuel and the thrust chamber must be conditioned prior to flight so that it's ready at the time of ignition inflight to receive these fuels coming in. To achieve the proper temperature the thrust chamber chill down should not exceed 20 minutes, but it must be on for at least 7 minutes and 40 seconds. So rounding that off the hold was called at the 8 minute mark. We can continuously hold it at this point whereas if we continued on down we would have to watch these parameters very closely so that we did not exceed that 20 minute accumulated cooling time. At this point we can continue our hold and that continuation can be determined by the problem and we can pick up then at any time or continue at long as necessary. We're continuing that hold now at T-minus 8 minutes and holding. This is Kennedy Launch Control.</p>

We are continuing to stand by waiting to hear from the testing going on at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville. To recap the activities earlier today the countdown picked up at 11:53 a.m. after a planned hold period picked up at T-minus 9 hours mark shortly after that time the pad was cleared and we began loading the cryogenic fuels, that's the liquid hydrogen and the liquid oxygen aboard the space vehicle. Those operations actually went a little bit ahead of schedule. The astronaut crew went out to the pad, enter their spacecraft, began checking it out and those operations also running a little bit ahead of schedule. We went on to our terminal countdown sequencer at the 3 minute 6 second mark as scheduled. Everything seemed to be proceeding fine. At the T-minus 30 second mark we got an automatic cut off. It was determined that this cut off came because pressurization of the liquid oxygen tank aboard the third stage was not initiated automatically as it should have been when it was done manually the terminal sequencer did not sense that this had been done and therefore gave the automatic cut off. We're working the problem right now continuing to hold at the T-minus 8 minute mark. T-minus 8 minutes, this is Kennedy Launch Control.</p>

We have approximately 5 more minutes remaining in that hold. It has been determined that the workaround is a correct and satisfactory one. A bread board or a sample system at the Marshal Spaceflight Center was used to run through the entire sequence as it now configured and that operated satisfactorily. What happened was the - during the terminal sequencer, the liquid oxygen tank was not pressurized automatically. When this was done manually, the indication did not get to the sensors in time so that we had an automatic cutoff. The liquid oxygen tanksaboard the third stage, it has been determined, will be pressurized manually early in the terminal sequence and jumpers have been installed so that we can then feed the informaticn to the sequencer so that it will not have an indication that the LOX tanks have not been pressurized. This - a bread board situation of this has been constructed at the Marshal Spaceflight Center in Huntsville and this has operated satisfactorily. So, it's been determined to go ahead with our countdown on this basis. We'll be planning to pick up the count at the T minus 8 minute mark some 4 minutes from now. Now T minus 8 minutes and holding.

At the T-minus 60 second mark 20 nozzles will start flame deflector deluge of 13 000 gallons per minute of water pouring down on that flame deflector, so a great deal of what is seen at launch time, which looks like smoke, is actually steam as this water is burned off. This water's to cool the pad area and to cool the equipment along side the launch tower as the water also pours across the swing arms in the launch tower.</p>

They have this private circuit to keep extraneous talk off of their circuit. They are checking in, they are checking in now on the astro comm circuit indicating that they are GO. Spacecraft has indicated they are ready. Instrument unit ready light has come on. SIC at the first stage preparations are now complete as we approach the 3 minute mark.

Distinction of sounds in launch vehicle sequence countdown to lift-off - I think the only thing that really comes across in there is that at some point you get a good vibration. At some point in the countdown, you get a good vibration as you're sitting up there. It's not part of the CSM's operation, so you're not sure what's going on. And this happened in the CDDT and, of course, all we did was check and find out we were doing something with the booster.</p>

	<p class="afjdb"><span class="afjwho">Cernan:</span> <span class="src">(Technical Debriefing)</span> Countdown - It was dark and we didn't see anything until S-IC ignition.</p>
	<p class="afjdb"><span class="afjwho">Cernan:</span> <span class="src">(Technical Debriefing)</span> The S-IC ignition - The lights started going out at 7 seconds, and somewhere around 3 seconds they were completely out. You could feel the ignition. You could feel the engines come up to speed. Just prior to lift-off and during the first few seconds of lift-off when we were near the pad, both the CMP and I could see the reflection of the engine ignition out the left-hand window and the hatch window in the BPC. We could not see the fire but could see a red glow through the windows reflecting apparently off the surface. Ignition was like a big old freight train sort of starting to rumble and shake and rattle and as she lifted off. We got a good tower clear.</p>
	<p class="afjdb"><span class="afjwho">Evans:</span> <span class="src">(Technical Debriefing)</span> I really wasn't watching the lights because I guess I didn't expect the thing to shake quite as much as it did. To me, I felt like I was really vibrating. I wanted to find out what was making me vibrate. I wasn't expecting that much vibration when the S-IC lit off. At lift-off, again, once it got vibrating, I didn't feel the yaw. I was watching the needle on the thing but didn't feel the yaw, though.</p>

I had my intercom very high and all my S-bands and tweaked everything up prior to lift-off. We went through max-q and the only unusual thing going through max-q, considering wind components that we had was that I saw 25 percent on the ALPHA going through max-q. The yaw needle was right on, but the pitch needle had dropped to a degree and a half at the most. I guess I didn't really expect it because of the predicted wind components. After we got through max-q, you could still certainly tell the bird was burning as we pressed on toward staging, but it got much quieter and it was very evident that you were through max-q when that time came.</p>
	<p class="afjdb"><span class="afjwho">Evans:</span> <span class="src">(Technical Debriefing)</span> The shaking increased a little bit up to max-q and then there was a different type of shaking.

	<p class="afjdb"><span class="afjwho">Cernan:</span> <span class="src">(Technical Debriefing)</span> If you want to put them in more layman terms, I think the S-IC acted and performed like some big, old, rugged, shaky, big monster. It has to be noisy, has lots of vibration, and smoothed out somewhat after max-q, but still was a rumbling bird.</p>
	<p class="afjdb"><span class="afjwho">Schmitt:</span> <span class="src">(Technical Debriefing)</span> I think that it is good to do a lot of simulation about malfunctions during launch, but up through max-q it is a little bit unrealistic to think that you are going to analyze a malfunction in the spacecraft.</p>
	<p class="afjdb"><span class="afjwho">Cernan:</span> <span class="src">(Technical Debriefing)</span> To sum up the S-IC, I personally didn't think it was any different than my previous ride on the S-IC and up through this point being a night launch really didn't make any difference at all. The only thing I did different that I hadn't really though a lot about until I sat on the pad and began to think about staging was, just prior to staging, I took my hand off the abort handle and held the support arm rather than the translation control handle until after staging. I did this just a couple of seconds prior to staging. I had talked about it with John Young a little bit prior to the flight and it turns out that's what he did, also. Probably a good thing.</p>
	<p class="afjtec"><span class="afjwho">Cernan:</span> Told you to hold on. Look at that son of a gun.</p>
	<p class="afjtec"><span class="afjwho">Evans:</span> Man .... criminy (laughter).</p>
	<p class="afjdb"><span class="afjwho">Evans:</span> <span class="src">(Technical Debriefing)</span> Of course, with the shutdown of the S-IC, I think that was about 4-1/2g.</p>
	<p class="afjdb"><span class="afjwho">Cernan:</span> <span class="src">(Technical Debriefing)</span> We pushed 4g.</p>
	<p class="afjdb"><span class="afjwho">Schmitt:</span> <span class="src">(Technical Debriefing)</span> Just pushing 4g on the thing and it quits just like that. I was prepared for it because Gene had said, &quot;Hey, brace yourselves because it is going to happen,&quot; and it happened all right. It just flat quit when we went from 4g to 0.</p>
	<p class="afjdb"><span class="afjwho">Cernan:</span> <span class="src">(Technical Debriefing)</span> The great train wreck.</p>
	<p class="afjdb"><span class="afjwho">Schmitt:</span> <span class="src">(Technical Debriefing)</span> I think in all those booster cutoffs, it's hard to see how rapidly the g-level decreases.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p class="afjother"><span class="afjwho">Schmitt:</span> <span class="src">(Oral History 2000)</span> Very slow acceleration at first, but heavy, heavy vibration as the five F-1 engines in the first stage, the S-IC, are fighting each other to some degree. You build up, over two minutes and forty-five seconds, about 4 Gs' acceleration. At that point everything shuts down. You drop off the first stage and then you ignite the second stage, the S-II, and you're back on your way, but only at one and a half Gs. So there's a big change, it's from 4 Gs to minus one and a half, as the whole stack unloads, to plus one and a half, as you go on on the second stage. And that all happens in just slightly over a second. So that is probably the most dynamically exciting point in the mission, certainly in the launch part of it. From then on it's pretty straightforward. You get into orbit in about ten minutes using all three stages.</p>

	<p class="afjdb"><span class="afjwho">Cernan:</span> <span class="src">(Technical Debriefing)</span> When the S-II lit off, we literally for a nanosecond flew through the bright yellow fireball that was left over from the S-IC. ... I don't think it's ever been recorded on a daylight launch before, but as soon as the S-IC shut down during the time involved in recycling and getting the staging sequence going and the S-II lit off, apparently the trailing flame of the S-IC overtook the spacecraft when we immediately went into that zero-g condition. And, for just a second, as the S-II lit off, we went through the flame. It was very obvious. We could see it out of both windows. I particularly could see it out of the left-hand rendezvous window of the BPC. It was not a smoke; it was not an orange fireball; it was just a bright yellow fire of the trailing flame of the S-IC; and it happened for just a split second. Then we got off on the S-II and things got very quiet and very smooth and was a very long, quiet, smooth ride.</p>

	<p class="afjpao"><span class="afjwho">Public Affairs Officer:</span> Coming up on 5 minutes. Everything still looks very good in the launch of Apollo 17. The launch vehicle spacecraft now 80 miles high, 230 miles down range.</p>

	<p class="afjtec"><span class="afjwho">Cernan:</span> Okay; I don't know if you'll be able to pick up any horizon.</p>

	<p class="afjtec"><span class="afjwho">Cernan:</span> Okay; let's keep on 1 g. I got some stars out the right, but I don't see - -</p>
	<p class="afjdb"><span class="afjwho">Cernan:</span> <span class="src">(Technical Debriefing)</span> While we were on the S-II, we would see no indication of light from the engines. We were just thrusting out in the darkness of space. I tried to see stars for potential mode IV and, of course, at that time, mode II abort and turned the lights down on the left side once or twice. But even with the lights down on (we had the LEB lights relatively low), in my estimation, it would have required all the lights in the spacecraft to have been off and certainly more than a few seconds to become night adapted to be able to see through the windows and pick up stars that would have been able to help in an abort situation had you lost the computer and the SCS. We had looked, potentially planned to use those stars in an abort condition if we had to. We had excellent constellations to look at. They obviously were there, but I could not see through the low glow reflection on the window even with our lights, floodlights, turned almost all the way down. I even went to the extent of trying to shield my eyes on the S-II and looked out the window and I still could not pick up anything that I could have recognized for an abort. I also could not pick up any night horizons during that point in time which I thought I might be able to base on seeing where the stars cut off and where they do not.</p>
	<p class="afjdb"><span class="afjwho">Schmitt:</span> <span class="src">(Technical Debriefing)</span> We had another indication of that during entry when we were looking for a night horizon and finally saw it, but it was extremely hard to find.</p>

	<p class="afjtec"><span class="afjwho">Overmyer:</span> MARK. Mode IV capability, and we copy cut-off.</p>
	<p class="afjtec"><span class="afjwho">Cernan:</span> Roger. Mode IV. And we do have S-IVB ignition.</p>
	<p class="afjtec"><span class="afjwho">Overmyer:</span> Roger. We see it, and the thrust is looking good on it.</p>
	<p class="afjob"><span class="afjwho">Evans:</span> <span class="src">(Onboard)</span> Jack, did you see that glow - -</p>
	<p class="afjob"><span class="afjwho">Schmitt:</span> <span class="src">(Onboard)</span> Gee&nbsp;!</p>
	<p class="afjob"><span class="afjwho">Evans:</span> <span class="src">(Onboard)</span> - - go - go in past us?</p>
	<p class="afjtec"><span class="afjwho">Cernan:</span> We saw that one, too, Bob.</p>
	<p class="afjtec"><span class="afjwho">Overmyer:</span> Roger.</p>
	<p class="afjob"><span class="afjwho">Evans:</span> <span class="src">(Onboard)</span> Did you see it go past us?</p>
	<p class="afjob"><span class="afjwho">Schmitt:</span> <span class="src">(Onboard)</span> Yes. We're right in the flame.</p>
	<p class="afjob"><span class="afjwho">Cernan:</span> <span class="src">(Onboard)</span> Yes, that's what the Titan used to do, used to fly through the flame of that thing.-</p>
	<p class="afjdb"><span class="afjwho">Cernan:</span> <span class="src">(Technical Debriefing)</span> The S-I cutoff, as Jack said, is again very sharp, almost instantaneous, from almost 4g to 0. But on the S-II, although it's sharp and a very hard hit, you don't unload the entire stack like you do when you're on the S-IC. The staging was very smooth. It did not seem like an exceptionally long time before we separated and the S-IVB lit 	off.</p>
	<p class="afjdb"><span class="afjwho">Cernan:</span> <span class="src">(Technical Debriefing)</span> I could see nothing on S-II until S-II shutdown. I could see the glow of S-IVB ignition. I say the glow of S-IVB ignition, it very easily could have been the fireball of S-II which tried to overtake us but couldn't quite make it. But there was a glow right during the period of S-II shutdown to S-IVB ignition. During the S-IVB burn, you could see the glow of the aft engines throughout the burn and throughout the orbital [operation?]</p>
	<p class="afjdb"><span class="afjwho">Cernan:</span> <span class="src">(Technical Debriefing)</span> We got lit off on the S-IVB, and, unlike the flame we flew through on the S-II, we did not do that on the S-IVB. I don't know where the reflection came from, but I could see the reflection from somewhere out the forward window. Either it was the S-II trailing flame trying to overtake the vehicle but didn't quite make it, or it was S-IVB ignition reflecting off the S-II because there's no atmosphere up there at that point. But I did not see a flame, but a residual back light out that window just for a short period of time, either right at staging or just at S-IVB ignition. As I think back, my best guess would be that the same thing happened on the S-II, that the trailing flame, when you go from 4g to 0 instantaneously, tends to overtake the vehicle. But in the case of the S-II, it's not nearly as big a pattern and just didn't quite make it up the stack. I just saw some of the glow of it. That's my best guess. After the S-IVB ignited, we never saw anything except the APS firing throughout that burn. You could see the mixture ratio shift.</p>
	<p class="afjdb"><span class="afjwho">Schmitt:</span> <span class="src">(Technical Debriefing)</span> But PU shift, both vehicles, was surprisingly noticeable.</p>
	<p class="afjdb"><span class="afjwho">Cernan:</span> <span class="src">(Technical Debriefing)</span> The S-II was a Cadillac: quiet, less than 1g flight most of the time until we built up our g-load prior to staging. It was quiet, smooth, had very little noise, or feeling of rumbling or anything else.</p>

	<p class="afjtec"><span class="afjwho">Cernan:</span> Why?</p>

	<p class="afjtec"><span class="afjwho">Cernan:</span> Okay, cut-off at 42.</p>
	<p class="afjtec"><span class="afjwho">Evans:</span> Don't worry. Well, that's the ... - -</p>
	<p class="afjtec"><span class="afjwho">Overmyer:</span> Understand. Cut-off at 42. Roger. We copy.</p>
	<p class="afjpao"><span class="afjwho">Public Affairs Officer:</span> And that looked like a near nominal shutdown. At shutdown we show 25,600 feet per second. That also looks very close.</p>
	<p class="afjdb"><span class="afjwho">Cernan:</span> <span class="src">(Technical Debriefing)</span> Communications throughout the booster phase were excellent. I never had any problem hearing either Stony or CAPCOM. Controls and displays performed super. Crew comfort through powered flight - I felt very comfortable throughout the entire flight in orbit.</p>
	<p class="afjdb"><span class="afjwho">Cernan:</span> <span class="src">(Technical Debriefing)</span> As far as I'm concerned, there was no pogo on the burn.</p>
	<p class="afjdb"><span class="afjwho">Evans:</span> <span class="src">(Technical Debriefing)</span> No, none.</p>
	<p class="afjdb"><span class="afjwho">Cernan:</span> <span class="src">(Technical Debriefing)</span> Summing up the birds. If you want to put them in more layman terms, I think the S-IC acted and performed like some big, old, rugged, shaky, big monster. It has to be noisy, has lots of vibration, and smoothed out somewhat after max-q, but still was a rumbling bird. The S-II was a Cadillac: quiet, less than 1g flight most of the time until we built up our g-load prior to staging. It was quiet, smooth, had very little noise, or feeling of rumbling or anything else. The S-IVB: a light little chugger is probably the best way I can describe it, which is not different than I remember it in the past. It just sort of rumbled on, not anywhere near the extent of the S-IC, but just sort of continued to rumble on through the burn. After a while, especially during TLI, it got to be a very pleasant, warm feeling that she was burning like she should burn.</p>
	<p class="afjdb"><span class="afjwho">Evans:</span> <span class="src">(Technical Debriefing)</span> Chugging, I think, has two different connotations. I felt the S-IVB was more of a very light rumble in the background, something that is kind of rumbling as opposed to chugging. A chug to me is a bang-bang type thing, and to me it was more of a rumble.</p>
	<p class="afjdb"><span class="afjwho">Schmitt:</span> <span class="src">(Technical Debriefing)</span> I agree, it may be a sense of rumbling but the ride was smooth. I could sense some activity behind it, but I wouldn't have said that it was chugging.</p>
	<p class="afjdb"><span class="afjwho">Cernan:</span> <span class="src">(Technical Debriefing)</span> I'll modify chugging to say it was a hummocky chug, just a rolling type. Nothing different, and, as I say, the best recollection, similar to the S-IVB I had the opportunity to ride on before, but probably even more steady and continuous flow of light rumbling.</p>
