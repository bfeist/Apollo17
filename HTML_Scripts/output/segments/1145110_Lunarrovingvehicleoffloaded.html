And it's too far away to be sure, but it looks like it's mottled also, although there did appear in the bin - in the monocular to be a more heterogeneous mottling. It might be a breccia.</span>

I'd say from a population point of view, boulders of the size Jack's talking about that are visible through the surface anywhere from 1 to 2 to 3 meters - a very small percentage, but when you look at them at our level, it looks like they are quite populous. I'd say there are maybe about 25 of them in view between myself and the - where the horizon falls off down away from us towards the South Massif. The area back towards Station 1, at least the other side of Trident, looks like it's more heavily strewn with some of these filleted and partially mantled large fragments.</span>

It looks like it's not more than a meter deep. It's very fresh, has a bright halo around it, and it's very rocky in its interior and has some rocks that are at least 10 or 20 centimeters in diameter on the rim. It looks like it's penetrated into some rockier - much rockier substrate than what we're seeing on the surface.

And it looks like that the saturation crater size is very small in the area we can see; that is, there don't seem to be any old or very subdued craters - Well, let me -let me think about how to put that again. They're - it's obviously saturated with craters a few centimeters in diameter, but when you get bigger than that, there seems to be more of a - a clear distribution rather than a saturation.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">Gordy, let me give you a quick far horizon. At 12 o'clock, I've got Family Mountain. It's a - it and South Massif are a replica from their plane form where I - up from where I am, except that Family Mountain is much more symmetrical and rounds off to a very more definite peak. The South Massif, in turn, has got a high plateau, a high flat peak on top. My far horizon then, at 12 o'clock, from about - to 11:30 is dominated by Family Mountain. It's - Well, I hate to use the word anorthosite without getting out of the spacecraft, but it sure is white. It sure is white, but its varied shades of white - with - sort of a - a tendency on its southern or southeastern slope to sort of be marble caked with a darker material much the same color as the mantle that we're - we've landed on. The Family Mountain disappears just about at the level of the rim of Camelot on my far horizon and just in front of it - it starts up - that's at about 11 o'clock - it just - just there is where the South Massif starts up very abruptly - I'd say - well, I'll try not to overestimate, but certainly 30 degrees, I'd say - very abruptly to a very impressive altitude. I know I was at 13,000 when I said I was at their level, but - it sure looked it from there. It - it plateaus off from about 10:30 to about 9:30, and then it starts sloping back down towards the east at about the same angle. Very symmetrical. There are several places where you can see what appear to be outcrops. I say several - about a dozen anyway, where you can see relatively large areas of outcrop on the South Massif. That outcrop is a - of a darker gray color than the white-gray of the Massif itself. The one most domin - dominant outcrop is right at the change in slope to the west, where it goes upslope and then plateaus off, and there is a definite outcrop. And you can see several boulders on all levels of the Massif that have come apparently from outcrops and I feel certain we will be able to get to some of those - that have come all the way down. South Massif, too, is a - appears to be in areas marbly caked dirty, such as if it was sprinkled with a dirty or a darker covering, and that covering is more evident as - as it slopes back here towards the - towards the east. As the far horizon now, I can see - I can see - South Massif all the way to 9 o'clock, but then behind it, there's just a little breadloaf-type dome of a much darker, much more hummocky mound back there, relatively big. It's probably, from where I stand, at least 10 percent the - the size of the Massif, the South Massif. Gray in texture. There appear to be some lineations running - well, as I'm looking at them, they're dipping down into the west at about 20 degrees, but that may be a Sun-angle problem. But they're definitely there. And then, contrasting that is - is Bare Mountain which is also much darker gray, much different than the Massif from where I stand, much more hummocky surface. It appears to be to me what I would expect Sculptured Hills to be like. One other thing about the South Massif is that - as I look at - as I look at it - at about 9:30 to 10:30, there is a little knob of the South Massif that sort of - oh flows toward - towards the east or slightly towards the northeast. That's the one that tends to be a little bit more heavily covered with the - darker dusty material - -</span>

I can see a couple of places where craters have - have penetrated very small craters and penetrated the Massif -craters maybe a meter or 2 in size, some 5 meters, and there's a lot of rock debris around them, which tends to believe that there is very little, if any, soft covering on that Massif.</span>

They are - the tracks can be traced up, at least to midslope. That's at my 3 o'clock position. And occasionally, at that midslope position, particularly northwest of Henson, you can see abundant boulders suggestive of outcrop. That's something that we had missed seeing on the pre-mission photos. But - And it isn't as abundant as on the South Massif, but there are apparent ledge formers about midslope.</span>
