The first presumption - the easiest solution was to have it unlevel, which case we could fix it this way. But I guess that's not the case. We'll have to see what happens overnight.

                <span class="spokenwords">This is Apollo Control at 149 hours 11 minutes. During the change of shift press briefing the major activity aboard Challenger on the lunar surface and here in mission control has been to get the spacecraft in the proper configuration for the crew to begin their eight hour sleep period. The crew reported and we confirmed through telemetry here on the ground that the spacecraft cabin pressure had come up just a little bit above what we would normally expect - normally runs around 5 pounds per square inch. And we're seeing a pressure of about 3/4 of a pound higher than that about 5.73 pounds per square inch. This is not particularly unusual. we'did see a pressure rise following rep ressurization after the first EVA where the cabin pressure came up somewhat above normal. The pressure relief valve in the cabin would operate at about 5.83 pounds per square inch. In the taped conversations with the crew that we obtained during the change of shift briefing, you'll hear some conversation about the cabin pressure and some instructions to the crew to have them looking for any sources in the cabin that might be putting extra oxygen into the cabin such as the PLSS fill valves that might not have been closed fully or something like that. At this point the cabin pressure has stabilized it looks like and we've found nothing amiss. We'll replay the tape conversation for you and then standby live.</span>

Well, it's not. It looks like a very fine-grained gray rock. But, it's a fractured piece and it looks like it - I've picked up fractures of about three or four vesicle faces on it. The vesicle faces are very shiny and that's what reflected and caught my eye. I think the unique part about it is - Jack may want to tell you something else about it - the unique part about it is - I picked it up at Shorty.

And the LM Cabin pressure reading at this time 5.77 pounds per square inch. There's no particular concern over the higher than normal cabin pressure. However, it is something we don't understand at the present time. Now, there are a limited number of sources of oxygen that can be getting into the cabin to raise the pressure. And, as Joe Allen mentioned to the crew, there's not much chance that anything is leaking in from the outside. We've been systematically checking 1 by 1 the potential sources of the oxygen flow into the cabin. And at some point, if all of the potential sources are eliminated, we begin to reach the conclusion that perhaps the sensor is at fault. However, at this point, it's not possible to say what the - what the cause of the slightly higher than normal LM cabin and pressure is.</span>

The procedure that we're going to follow here is to let the cabin pressure continue to drop. It's come down from 5. - from a high of 5.81 pounds per square inch to 5.73 and we're going to let it get down a little closer to 5 pounds and then run some checks to determine which of the two regulators is leaking. The procedure after this was determined - after this is determined would be to simply use the good regulator and turn off the regulator which has the small leak.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">This is Apollo Control at 150 hours 20 minutes. We're looking at a LM cabin pressure now of between 5.61 and 5.65 and you heard CAPCOM, Joe Allen, instruct the crew to turn back on one of the cabin oxygen regulators which supplies O2 to the cabin from the storage tanks. REG A is the one that's online right now. We'll watch the cabin pressure and see if it begins to rise again, and if so, we would conclude that Regulator A has a small leak. However, if nothing happens we'll then turn Regulator A off and turn REG - Regulator B on, and watch it to see if the cabin pressure begin to go up with that regulator. The LM Environmental Systems Officer made one point to Flight Director, Gene Kranz, and that is that very very small amounts of additional gas in the cabin will show up in our telemetry readings. Now, we're talking ab out tenths to hundreths of a pound per square inch of pressure and there are a number of possible things at the end of an EVA that could contribute to this kind of a pressure rise, such things as moisture in the suits when the suits are removed, evaporating carbon dioxoide, or the temperature rise - small temperature rises in the cabin due to the heat stored in the rocks brought in. All of these things could have contributed to causing the pressure rise that we saw and it may well turn out that neither of the regulators has any problem. In the event that there is a small leak in one of the two regulators the Lunar Module functions perfectly well, the cabin atmosphere would be maintained perfectly well with one regulator and the procedure would be to simply shut down the regulator that was leaking. It, of course, could be brought back online if needed and would perform it's function. And it still appears that we are approximately 2 hours behind in getting the crew ready for their sleep period. We have a clock in the control center counting down to our best estimate at this time as to when the sleep period will begin and it now shows 2 hours 36 minutes.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">Roger. This is a news report to eat by. I'll combine an orbital science report with a sports report, an unusual combination here. I'll start out with a sports report on Monday night football, which you may not have heard yet. Joe Namath tried mightily to lead the New York Jets into the American Football League playoffs, but the Oakland Raiders grounded the Jets in a fourth quarter 24 to 16 blitz. Namath passed for more than 400 yards but, in spite of it, New York scored only one touchdown. Moving along to the successes of Captain America, I'll run down different items in the SIM bay here, beginning with the UV spectrometer. In general, the data has been excellent. We're getting indications that the hydrogen atmosphere of the Moon is much less than expected. In fact, I don't think we're detecting any, but rather setting a limit on the amount of hydrogen around the Moon. There was an Aerobee launch - or an attempt at an Aerobee launch - from White Sands on Monday to calibrate solar UV radiation, but this launch failed because an instrument viewing port in the rocket failed to open. A second launch - let's see - was scheduled, I think, for today, and I don't know whether that was successful or not, I guess it'll be launched later today. The infrared scanning radiometer is performing beautifully. Indications are that subsolar-point surface temperatures are higher than we've detected from our Earth-based observations before. We're seeing many thermal anomolies, particularly in Procellarum and in the Procellarum area west of Copernicus. And we're seeing also a few unusual cold spots, which apparently are indicating areas of very fine soil with a few or no blocks in and on the soil. The lunar sounder data is beautiful, and the power monitor signals we find correlate with the surface features. And the HF data indicates to us that we are detecting a variety of layers in the mare areas.</span>

From the EVA-2 EMU summary, the elapsed EVA time was 7 hours plus 37 minutes plus 22 seconds for a new outdoor record under international rules. The rest of the sheet looks free from problems in a comforting way. Let's see, average metabolic rates - for you, Geno, 855; and, Jack, you're running at around 920, And that, relative to premission averages of around 850.

I didn't hit 15 going up very much.. Coming down I did, but it's - it's really a "stand by for turn and watch where you're going" type of run. Because the small craters, - of course, are the ones that can really jolt you. But the trouble is, you can't - you can never see what's just over the next ridge, and the next ridge may be 20 meters away, and you just can't see it until you're there, and you don't know whether its a dish crater or pit crater.</span>

Ron Evans aboard America is now in his 33rd revolution of the Moon. That spacecraft currently in an orbit 69.3 by 53.6 nautical miles. Evans began an 8 hour sleep period at 146 hours 40 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, which is right on the flight plan. And he's scheduled to end that sleep period at 154 hours 40 minutes. The pan camera - mapping camera, and laser altimeter in the CSM scientific instrument module bay, have been turned off.

The goodnights with the crew aboard Challenger were exchanged at 152 hours 25 minutes, and we plan to give them a full 8 hour sleep period which puts wakeup at 160 hours 25 minutes. That presumably would move the start time for the EVA 3 back 1 hour. We'll be getting conformation on that shortly. And both the CSM and the Lunar Module continuing to perform almost perfectly as planned. Based on the telemetry that we're getting here on the ground and at this moment our large scribing plotter display in front of mission control, shows the Command Module, America, to be passing almost directly over Challenger on the lunar surface in the Valley of Taurus Mountains. America now on its 33 revolution of the Moon. And Ron Evans well into his scheduled 8 hour sleep period. Evans is right on the planned time for sleep. Sleeping right on the - on the flight plan times. During the sleep period we'll have the air-to-ground lines down. Normally that circuit gets rather noisy after the crew has gone to sleep - configured the lunar module to sleep. The power amplifier is turned off, the transmitter output power of the Lunar Module decreased from about 18 watts down to about 1 watt and that accounts for the noise that we frequently have on that circuit during sleep periods. For that reason, we will have the circuit down configured to record any conversations with the crew for subsequent playback. At 152 hours 29 minutes, this is Apollo Control Houston.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">This is Apollo Control at 153 hours 27 minutes. We have heard nothing from the crew aboard Challenger on the lunar surface, Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt, for the past hour since we said goodnight to them. And we now have a little less than 7 hours until their scheduled wakeup time. We plan to wake them up at a GET time of 160 hours 25 minutes which would be 8 hours after we said goodnight to them. Ron Evans aboard the Command Module, America, is about to begin his 34th revolution of the Moon, and on this revolution we'll be sending Ron a wakeup call. Wakeup for him is 154:40, 154 hours 40 minutes. It'll be about 35 minutes before we regain radio contact with the CSM as it comes back around the eastern limb of the Moon on its 34th revolution. Both vehicles continuing in very good shape. One minor problem appeared to crop up with the Lunar Module following the repressurization after the 2nd EVA. The cabin pressure went up to about 5.8 pounds per square inch. This is about 8 tenths of a pound above what we think of as the normal LM cabin pressure. However, it is not unusual to see the cabin pressure spike up a bit on repressurization and then drop back down. However, this rise was getting fairly close to the pressure of which the cabin relief valves would open and relieve the pressure. One consideration when the pressure goes up in this manner is that perhaps one of the several sources of oxygen in the LM cabin might be leaking. Such things as the portable life support system fill valves or the portable life support system itself, or one of the oxygen purge systems, or even the the main regulator valves that control the flow of oxygen from the LM supply tanks in the cabin. After isolating these possible sources one at a time, and still watching the pressure rise gradually, we elected to shut down both of the oxygen regulator valves and see what happened to the pressure, keeping a flow of oxygen through the cabin to remove carbon dioxide buildup, and on shutting down both regulators, the pressure did, in fact, begin to drop. The assumption at that time was that possibly one of the regulators was leaking slightly, allowing a small amount of oxygen above the needs of the crew and for replenishment, to flow into the cabin. And as the pressure dropped back down, we brought one regulator at a time online. However, the pressure continued to fall back to its normal level of about 5 pounds per square inch even with both regulators on. So, at this point, the assumption is that nothing is the matter. There are a couple of possible explanations for the rise in cabin pressure. One is - one explanation is that one of the regulators was, in fact, leaking, and when they were recycled and reseated, the seal held properly and the regulators are now performing properly. The other possibility is that moisture from the suit circuits - the temperature rise caused by bringing things from outside the LM into the lunar cabin - rocks and other equipment that had been exposed to the Sun on the lunar surface - causing an increase in water vapor, carbon dioxide, and the slight rise in the cabin temperature, which would, in turn, bump the pressure up. Those are probably the most likely possibilities. In any event, the situation as it now stands is that the LM cabin's pressure is at 4.9 pounds per square inch, which is within the normal range, and there's no indication of any leakage either through the regulators or through the other sources of oxygen. It appears that everything is functioning normally. During this shift in Mission Control, Flight Director, Gene Kranz has his flight control team reviewing the situation for liftoff. This team of flight controllers will be in charge of the lunar liftoff, and they are considering such things as the ideal time to conduct the plane change maneuver with the Command Module, to put it in the proper orbit for subsequent rendezvous with the lunar module; also, looking at LM weights and performance characteristics, assuring that all that data is in proper form for the liftoff which we expect will occur at the flight plan time. EVA 3 will be, it looks like now, delayed 1 hour from the published flight plan time. This reflects the late sleep time for the crew, the fact that they began their rest period one hour late. And we expect this will translate to a one hour late start for EVA 3, and the EVA is planned for a full 7 hours duration. At 153 hours 33 minutes, this is Apollo Control Houston.</span>

Ron, completing an 8 hour sleep period, and flight surgeon reports he has been sleeping soundly during virtually all of that sleep period. And Ron Evans, right on the Flight Plan. The command module performing very well. During the sleep period, the pan camera, the mapping camera, and the laser altimeter back in the scientific instrument module bay have been turned off. We have been gathering data from the infrared scanning radiometer and the ultra violet spectrometer. And the telemetry data that we have received indicates that they're performing normally. For Ron Evans - or for rather for Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt aboard the Lunar Module Challenger, they now have about 5 hours 53 minute remaining in a scheduled 8 hour sleep period, and the surgeon reports that Gene Cernan who is wearing the biomedical sensors during sleep period is sleeping soundly at this time, so the lunar module crew also appears to be getting well into their rest period. We show America in an orbit at the present time with a high point or apocynthion of 69 and 1/2 nautical miles and a low point or pericynthlon of 53.4. No signs of activity, aboard the Command Module at this point. We'll stand by for the wake up call to Ron Evans.</span>

Systematic descriptions and samples of four of the six main units of the area, massifs, subfloor, the light mantle, and the dark mantle were obtained. In addition, detailed descriptions were given of a variety of craters, including exciting discoveries that the crater Shorty, and descriptions of the Lee-Lincoln Scarp and lineaments in the hilly terrain. The South Massif is composed of two main varieties of breccia; blue-gray and tan-gray blocks of both varieties were abundant at station 2 up on Nansen. I won't go into the geologic details on those breccias.

We'll see him again in about 48 minutes. Meanwhile the crew of lunar module Challenger is still asleep at Taurus-Littrow. To reiterate the new wake-up time for the Challenger crew it's Ground Elapsed Time of 160 hours 25 minutes with the start of EVA 3 coming at 163:40, which is approximately 1 hour later than the Flight Plan. Current orbit measurements of spacecraft America: 69.6 by 53.5 nautical miles. As the spacecraft disappeared behind the Moon, the velocity in orbit was 5372 feet per second.

First of all, your RCS is hooking right along there 4 percent above the Flight Plan line; however, we have some plans for that 4 percent, which I'll go over with you later. On the oxygen, you've gained a little on it, since I was last on anyway. O2 tank 1 is a little low, but it's balanced by tank 3 being a - a little high, and tank 2 is right on the redline, so I think they all balance out to be about on the redline on the Flight Plan line. And they all three balance out to be right on the Flight Plan line, as close as I can tell. On hydrogen, you're probably up about 4 percent in tank 1, and the other two are right on the line, so you are in good shape there, still.</span>

It's not degrading down into a circular orbit. It's - I think it's staying just about the way it was, and so we're looking ahead to a plane change, and we're - we're thinking about an extra maneuver prior to plane change - about 1 hour prior to plane change on the back side. There was some discussion here about what to call that maneuver. Somebody wanted to call it a HAM, Height Adjustment Maneuver, and someone else said, well that one's already used in the rendezvous sequence. Maybe we ought to make it "bacon". And even "lox" was was suggested, considering the FDOs objected to "bacon" because of his religion. So the "lox" was eliminated because we already used that for the S-IVB.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">Anyway, what the maneuver's going to be - whatever we call it - is about 11 foot per second RCS burn, 1 hour prior to plane change so that'll be on the back side. And, that'll just about use up your RCS overage and put you back on the Flight Plan line. That will adjust the height when you get around to the plane change, and then the plane change will be a little bigger than originally planned, showing about 365 feet per second, SPS, of course. And, looking at the consumables, that will put you down right - right on the rescue red-line on SPS, so we're still in good shape - consumable-wise. Further tracking will refine this, of course, so we'll have updates on the plan. Any questions on that? Over.</span>

Okay, on the SIM bay. Basically there's nothing new to report. And all the people down here appreciate your timely operation of the SIM bay, and it's responsible for really maximizing the data return. In general, we're pretty happy. The problems that we're have - having with it are ones that have already been mentioned to you. On the - on the HF antenna retract problem that we have, if we have it, here's the plan. We're - Well, first of all, the consensus on that is that we really think the antennas are retracting okay. That it's a malfunction in the limit switch that drives the talkback that's really the problem. But we have devised an alternate method, utilizing timing and stall current, and actually the signature of the motor stall current down here in the data, to determine proper retraction. And just prior to 168 hours in the Flight Plan, you're supposed to retract those antennas, and we're going to check the data at that time, and say "yes" or "no"; they are retracting or they aren't. If they don't, then the alternate plan we'll swing into at that time is to reschedule the HF targets that are now scheduled on rev 55. Reschedule them and do them on rev 42. After which, we'll try one more time to retract the antennas, and if it still looks like they indeed are not retracting - I guess it's just the one that's in question - then we'll go ahead and jettison them at that time. And we'll still have gotten most of the - of the at least - priority HF targets with that alternate plan. Over.</span>

With the shadow effect on the eastern - I guess the east and southeastern interior rim of the crater, it reminds me a lot of some eroded hills. Like if you've got a valley that maybe has a 20-foot - it's bigger than that - but say you got a 20-foot drop on the thing where it's been - just rain erosion down the side and it kind of washes little - little valleys down it here and there. And it leaves mounds and humps in between that haven't eroded away yet. And that's the way the side of that crater works. And then the other side of it, the northeastern rim of it and the interior rim, looks just like a - one of the massif units. That is, it's a very fine texture, no real erosional processes, just a smooth, gentle - gentle slope.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">Okay, think I left off, or was cut off there without mentioning two varieties of breccia in the South Massif they found. Blue-gray and tan-gray and, without going into the geological details, those are the two types they found up there at Nansen. The subfloor unit was exposed as blocks and ejecta around larger craters had been partly buried by dark mantle. And craters apparently had penetrated thin parts of the light mantle. Especially good samples were obtained from the rim of Camelot where the same textural characteristics which are banding caused by variations in vesicle concentration, coarse-grain size, and mineralogic features, as reported in EVA-1, were found. So apparently this unit is quite uniform over the distances that they have covered so far in the traverses. The prominent east-facing scarp, crossing the valley floor from north to south about 5 kilometers west of the LM, was traversed twice near the crater Lara, near Hole-in-the-Wall, although Hole-in-the-Wall appeared to be pretty subtle. No change in the surface characteristics or lithology of the mantle was discernible where the astronauts traversed the Scarp. Outcrops of boulders were observed farther to the north where the northward extension of the Scarp crosses the face of the North Massif, it forms a notably smooth and relatively young-appearing surface. Elsewhere, the surface of the North Massif is prominently furrowed and textured, and the crew described it as a cross-hatched pattern on the surface that they could see with one set of lineaments dipping eastward and the other westward at about 30 degrees. Some of the most interesting observations made during the EVA were related to craters. Many small craters within the dark mantle have glass-coated central pits. Jack called them dimples. Some of the pits are nearly cylindrical and maybe half again as deep as the crater itself. Other small craters occurring in both the dark and light mantle have bright halos, but these halos appear to be noticeably brighter on the light-colored material. This bright material is not blocky or fragmental ejecta derived from a subfloor layer, but rather appears to consist of "instant rock" or soil breccia which has been partly consolidated by the impact shock itself. The most interesting eureka during the EVA was at station 4, Shorty Crater, where Jack found some bright red or orange, he described it, orange dirt within the gray to dark-gray rim material. The colored banding is circumferential to the crater and resembled alteration halos, which occur around many terrestrial volcanic vents. So you can see why the geologists are excited on that one. The morphology of Shorty, however, is similar in some respects - -</span>

And the last 2 or 3 nights, what I'd do is put the lap belt on loosely. And you know, it just kind of keeps you from rolling all over the cockpit. Then last night, I didn't put it on at all and stayed in the sack. And I really didn't go too far anyhow. One time I woke up and I was crossways in the couch up here. And then when I woke up this morning my feet were up in the tunnel, and my head was kind of still in the center couch, more or less. So you really don't roam around too much that way anyhow, even if you aren't tied down. And you can get the "huggy pillow" effect by being inside that sack and laying your head on the outside of the sack. It just about fits me, except that if I stretch my feet out - then I get a little bit of a pull. Little bit of a pull - on it and it feels like a huggy pillow that way.</span>

And there was a picture of Jan, John, and Jaime in the paper, watching the EVA on TV. The only thing new on the peace talks is that Kissinger will probably be coming back to the United States today and there's a rumor, the French press said that the compromise is in the work on the withdrawal of the North Vietnamese troops from the south. The Rockets lost - the Aeros, the hockey team, won last night. They beat the Alberta Oilers. The Rockets lost to Buffalo. And the weather finally cleared out. The cold front cleared out the wet stuff and last night I think was the first time since you guys launched that we've had a look at the Moon, so we had a direct look at you last night. It's just high cirrus and sunny this morning when I came to work. Over.</span>

The headlines were full of reports of the find of orange dirt and the rest of your adventures yesterday. Internationally, the U.S. and North Vietnam held intensified secret peace talks, and Henry Kissinger prepared to return to Washington probably this afternoon, I understand, after a final session with Le Duc Tho. The French press said a compromise was in the works on the withdrawal of North Vietnamese troops from the South. The Houston Rockets lost to Buffalo up in Buffalo last night, but the hockey team, the Aeros, took a 6 to 4 win over the Alberta Oilers. In - Really, that's about it on the news, except maybe for the weather, which finally broke. The cold front cleared out the drizzly rain last night, and for the first time since you've launched - that I can remember anyway - we've been able to look up and see the Moon, directly.

It's just staying where it was, about a 70 by 50. And so what we're planning on is an extra little maneuver about 1 hour prior to the normal plane change, which will lower the Command Module altitude at the plane change mode to - to 60. This will be about a 11 feet per second RCS burn. And then Ron will do the plane change at the normal time, but it'll be little bigger than - that we had planned. I think the last half was about 365 feet per second for plane change. And we've checked the consumables. That puts the RCS right on the preflight line. He's been running about 4 or 5 percent above it. That will use up that pad there, put him back to nor - nominal on RCS, and on the SPS, that puts you right down on the CSM rescue redline; so, really no problem. In good shape, consumablewise.
