Apollo 17, 130,714 nautical miles out from Earth, velocity now, 3,985 feet per second, continuing to decelerate as we approach the so-called cross over between the sphere of influence from Earth to Moon. I can't recall ever seeing two pages of a flight plan as blank as these are, from 36 hours to 38 hours. Later on today, the - after the eat-period the crew will crawl through the hatch into the Lunar Module for some housekeeping chores, checking out of stowage of equipment in the Lunar Module. But the most exciting thing going on now, was the checkout of the Bio-medical harness on the Command Module Pilot. Midcourse correction burn went nominally on time. The velocity just at time of ignition was 4,058 feet per second. It jumped approximately 10 feet since there was a 10-foot per second burn. But then, within a few minutes it was down below the original velocity as the spacecraft continues to decelarate. Altitude at the time of burn, or distance from Earth, was 128,217. We show a pericynthion of 52.09 miles at closest approach after the burn. And standing by at 36:36, this is Apollo Control.</span>

It's mixed with some cloudiness that extends from that area all the way down to the Antarctic ice shelf. But it looks like some pretty good movement patterns from the southwest, north - northeast. No strong weather waves or cyclone development on that yet, although one may be picking up about halfway between Tierra del Fuego and the coast of Antarctica, the - where the front, or at least the cloud masses, curve from the east-west direction to an almost due south direction. Most of South America still looks like pretty good weather. There is cloudiness along the Andean Ridge and also in the Amazon Basin, stretching from the eastern coast of South America on up about, oh, two-thirds of the way towards Central America. It doesn't look like frontal weather there. It's probably tropical convergence weather. Now there is this - still this small, moderately developed cyclone pattern that's hanging pretty much over Buenos Aires now, I think. Uruguay and Buenos Aires. I think I mentioned that earlier in the day. And that still is there, and I suspect those folks are getting a fair amount of weather out of it.</span>

There's a little clouds off - cloud pattern off to the east of those islands, but it doesn't look like any major weather in that area. The eastern half and Midwest of the United States is completely cloud covered right now. There - however, the - extending from Mexico to Sonora and up into Arizona and New Mexico, and possibly as far north as Colorado, is a clear band. But then there is more cloudiness to the north of that. The Pacific regions west of - The West Coast of the United States is cloudy, at least west of Southern California. I cannot see Baja, so that cloudiness extends down south of - into Baja California. I see no strong new frontal patterns, although I'm looking right across the limb at the Earth now. There may be one that would be lying maybe across northern California and - and into Colorado, with a little clear area ahead of it, possibly in Kansas. But then into this, a solid bank of clouds that stretches from Brownsville, at least, clear up to - well, along the Gulf Coast across the panhandle of Florida, up the East Coast and on out past Nova Scotia, I'm sure. Florida is clear. Florida - the peninsular portion of Florida is - it looks very clear and some of the deep turquoise green waters to the south and southeast of that area are - are very obvious at this time.</span>

If I'd been a little more observant I could see that there was a little bit, looks like a decrease in at least the thickness of the clouds, vertical thickness, between the two areas you just mentioned. So, there is some indication here of those two fronts, although they are contributing to a general weather pattern in the eastern United States.</span>

When I looked at it, of course, my handle was flush against the edge and it was also - essentially - locked in position. But since the bungee was down on the thing I took hold of it, and I felt that the hook itself was loose. Okay, so I took the handle and the handle will come back - would come back once you pressed the little button, you know, to release the handle. The handle would come back to about a 45-degree position just like it normally does when you try to cock the latches. Okay, with the handle back in that 45-degree position, then I grabbed hold of the hook and brought the hook off of the docking ring with my fingers and back to about that 45-degree position again just like it was comparable to the first cocked position. And that's the way it is right now.</span>

Let me say once again, way back when we first started and Gene was talking to you, I heard one of your answers, weak but clear, with zero signal strength showing here. Now, that might have been through Ron's VOX, I don't know. Since then, you've been able to modulate the signal strength, with occasional weak words. And - and then, when that signal strength was up around 3.2, where it is now, then you came in loud and clear with a broadcast. I answered you, you said about three words, then dropped off completely. And then we - we changed configuration.</span>

During this past checkout of the lunar module we've had considerable difficulty in some of the communications configurations in the way the down links and the uplinks were set up. And some bit of difficulty in sorting out just what the nature of the problem with one of the docking latches is. People will be examining this through the night and during the checkout of the LM tomorrow or additional work in the LM perhaps the thing can be sorted out.

The crew is now in the midst of the heat flow and convection demonstration. This is the demonstration that's designed to provide more exact data on the behavior of fluids in a low gravity field. This type of investigation is really not possible on Earth where gravity determines flow of fluids. In space the flow forces surface tension. There are three test cells involved in this demonstration for measuring and observing the fluid flow, behavior and the results are recorded with the 16mm camera aboard. We have about 5 minutes worth of tape that accumulated during the news conference and we'll play that for you now and then pickup live.</span>

That was a reminder that we are approaching the time where we are going to make the first step in a two step adjustment caused by the late launch. This will be to bring the Greenwich mean time, the Ground Elapsed Time and the flight plan together. What this first step will account for an hour of 2 hours and 40 minutes adjustment that will be made eventually. The clocks will not be recycled at this time at 45 hours. The clock recycling will be accomplished later in the mission at 65 hours elapsed time. This 1 hour adjustment consists of moving the activities that were scheduled in the flight plan to take place between 46 hours and 30 minutes and 47 hours up to 45 hours in the flight plan. Therefore, during the hour from 45 hours to 46 hours we will have accomplished all the flight plan activities that were originally scheduled to be accomplished from 46 to 47 hours. This will put us 1 hour ahead on the flight plan. We would pick up the activities originally scheduled at 47 hours at 46 hours under this plan. And this would proceed in an orderly fashion one hour ahead up to the 65 hour mark at which time we will synchronize the Ground Elapsed Time clock to 67 hours and 40 minutes and at that time go to the 67:40 time in the flight plan and we will be back on schedule.</span>

And it seems to be an extremely strong front with what I would guess is heavy air-mass weather all along it. And up to the east-northeast of Japan, there's an excellent example of a shadow line from some fairly thick high clouds on solid overcast of lower clouds.

With the lunar referenced velocity of 3,343 feet per second. The flight director has just gotten another update on the S-IVB impact prediction, based on tracking to date. The newest prediction is that the impact will occur at an elapsed time of 86 hours 59 minutes 55 seconds, at 3 degrees 58 minutes south latitude, 12 degrees 35 minutes west longitude. While that tape was playing, there were several conversations with the crew. Including one between Brigadier General Tom Stafford and Gene Cernan. Stafford was Cernan's spacecraft commander in both Gemini and Apollo. We'll play those conversations for you now and then come back up live.</span>

Here in the Control Room flight director Gene Kranz and his white team are preparing to relieve the orange team which has been directed tonight by flight director Chuck Lewis. Major activities during this shift have been the heat flow and convection demonstration which has been performed twice during this shift. Once, while the spacecraft was nulled in all three axes and again after the passive thermal control spinup mode had been established. That demonstration is to provide data on behavior of fluids in a low gravity field and the information learned from the demonstration could be valuable in the future science experiments and perhaps for manufacturing processes in space. The crew is in its presleep checklist at the present time and we have a - again a new update on the S-IVB impact just provided by the flight dynamics officer - updates impact time to 86 hours 59 minutes 38 seconds at 3 degrees 37 minutes south latitude, 12 degrees 7 minutes west longitude. We do not anticipate a change of shift briefing at the end of this shift. Handover is scheduled for midnight and there will be no change of shift briefing. At 48 hours 12 minutes this is Mission Control Houston.</span>

Spacecraft Communicator, at the present time, is astronaut Robert Parker. He has replaced Robert Overmyer in that position and in Mission Control we're set to maintain the watch while the crew is sleeping, keeping an eye on spacecraft systems via telemetry.

At present time in Mission Control, Flight Director Gene Kranz is going around the room polling each of his Flight Controllers on the mission status and all the reports are coming up very good. The orbital science officer said that the temperatures in the SIMBAY where the various scientific instruments will be used in Lunar orbit to observe the Moon from orbit appear to be about as would be expected at this time. During the previous shift the film in the panoramic and mapping cameras was cycled and this is done once every 24 hours if the cameras are not used, to prevent the pressure points on the film in the transport mechanism from creating striations in the film emulsion, and those cameras are cycled ahead several frames to move that pressure point around on the film emulsion. During Lunar module housekeeping when the crew entered the LM on the previous shift, everything looked to be in order in that vehicle. And the guidance and control officer reports that the midcourse correction maneuver performed earlier in the day - was very close to nominal. Also, the command module is running a bit ahead of the flight plan schedule as far as reaction control system propellent usage and service propulsion system propellent usage and we have a bit more than had been predicted for this point in the flight. And the Electrical Environmental Communications Officer, EECOM, said that in general the command module - the command and service module appear to be in very good shape. Apollo 17, at this time, is 75,975 nautical miles from the Moon and we're showing a velocity with respect to the Moon of 3,325 feet per second. We don't anticipate any further conversation with the crew, having said "goodnight" to them - and we are planning to give them an additional 30 minutes on their rest period if they so desire. The rest period, according to the flight plan, is scheduled to end at a Ground Elapsed Time of 56 hours. However, we do not plan to put in a call to the crew until 56 hours 30 minutes, giving them the option to sleep an additional 30 minutes if they so desire. We showed at 48 hours 38 minutes, or about 23 minutes ago, that they had turned off the voice sub-carriers indicating that they were preparing to bed down and get to sleep. During this sleep shift we'll plan to have the air-to-ground lines down to minimize the amount of noise on these circuits. We'll be recording any conversation with the crew and will be prepared to bring the lines up in very short order should we have any calls from the crew.

Apollo 17 is now 74,098 nautical miles from the Moon and the spacecraft velocity is 3,317 feet per second with respect to the Moon. The flight dynamics officer has the option of setting up the display which gives us the velocity of the spacecraft and its distance relative to either the Moon or the Earth. And his option is to look at the spacecraft position and velocity with respect to the Moon or to Earth. At the present time, we are looking at those parameters with respect to the Moon. The large display plot up on the large 10 by 20 foot describing plotter display at the front of the Control Center shows us that the spacecraft is now approaching 160,000 nautical miles from Earth.

Wake up call is scheduled for 56 hours 30 minutes or about 5 and a half hours from now. Apollo 17, currently 160,762 nautical miles from Earth and we're showing the spacecraft 72,200 miles from the Moon and its continued to be very quiet in Mission Control, almost no conversation on the loops here, and no change in any of the systems aboard the spacecraft - everything going along very smoothly and performing well at this time. The cabin temperature at the point we monitor it, that's where our telemetry which is the outlet of the air flowing into the cabin, shows the temperature at that point to be about 63 degrees. The cabin temperature itself would be somewhat warmer than that, probably up around room temperature - 68, 69, 70 degrees - in that area.

Actually, that would be the earliest that we would expect to hear from them and prior to beginning the rest period we advised them that we would not plan to put in a call until about 30 minutes later than called for in the flight plan. They were about a half hour late beginning the rest period. Tomorrow's schedule is relatively uncluttered and Flight Director, Gene Kranz, decided to give them the extra 30 minutes of sleep if they desire to take it. On awakening the - one of the main activities in the flight plan for today has the crew re-entering the lunar module, Challenger and partially powering the vehicle up and running some additional checks. And there has been no change in the status of the spacecraft based on the telemetry information we're getting here in Mission Control everything continues to perk along very smoothly.

The flight dynamics officer has been working on the trajectory, and looking at tracking data as a result of the midcourse correction performed yesterday. And at this point it appears that no further midcourse maneuvers will be required to get Apollo fif - Apollo 17 into lunar orbit at the desired altitude and time. However, the flight dynamics officer is going to reserve final decision on that point probably until tomorrow. Although it does appear certain at this point that there will be no midcourse correction required at the midcourse correction three opportunity. And probably not even at midcourse correction four. Our data displays at this time show Apollo 17 68,237 nautical miles from the Moon. And on a different display we're reading 165,584 nautical miles back to Earth.

                <span class="spokenwords">This is Apollo Control at 54 hours 57 minutes, some 1 hour 33 minutes now from the scheduled crew awakening time. What has been a very uneventful sleep shift for the crew and a very quiet period here in Mission Control. After the crew awakes, one of the activities on their schedule for the day will be to update the clocks for the spacecraft, we'll be updating the clocks here in Mission Control at the same time. This clock update is occasioned by the fact that we lifted off 2 hours 40 minutes late from Cape Kennedy, however, in order to place the spacecraft in lunar orbit at the same diurnal time or the same Sun time, and retain the lighting conditions desired for the lunar landing, the translunar injection burn was given a slight bit longer burn - just a little bit more energy put into that burn - trip time to the Moon decreased by 2 hours and 40 minutes. The net effect of this is that we now arrive at the Moon at the same time that we would have arrived had the liftoff been on time. One other effect is that the crew has a net 2 hours and 40 minutes less time to accomplish those things that needed to be accomplished in the translunar coast. This is of small consequence because the translunar coast time is relatively a slack period for them, however, in order to avoid any sudden shift in sleep periods and that sort of thing, the time has been made up in two increments - the first one of 1 hour at 45 hours in the flight plan. The crew activities were jumped ahead by 1 hour and they essentially began doing those things that were called for 1 hour later in the flight plan. They will again jump ahead an hour and 40 minutes and that'll occur at 65 hours. By that time they will have completed all those activities required up through 67 hours 40 minutes in the flight plan. Or, in other words, they'll have completed all of the activities required to get them into lunar orbit 2 hours and 40 minutes early. And in order to make the clocks then agree with where the crew will be in the flight plan, we'll jump the clocks ahead 2 hours and 40 minutes. This clock update which can be likened to going on daylight saving time, only 2 hours and 40 minutes worth of change instead of 1 hour of change as we do on daylight savings time, will occur at 65 hours when the crew will have completed all of those flight plan activities up through 67 hours and 40 minutes. This simply involves setting our clocks at 65 hours in the Control Center and aboard the spacecraft at 65 hours, moving them ahead to 67 hours 40 minutes. Then, barring any further changes in the mission timeline from that point on, the elapsed time clocks which are used as the cue to flight plan activities, should agree with the flight plan and events that - in the flight plan are called out for a certain time will happen at that time on the elapsed time clocks in Mission Control and aboard the spacecraft. This is a convenience factor. The other alternative wodd be to go through the flight plan and change all of the flight plan times to agree with the clocks. We simply find it easier to change the clocks and avoid having to make all those updates to the flight plan. At the present time, Apollo 17 is 64,232 nautical miles from the Moon and we're showing 169,518 nautical miles from Earth. Spacecraft velocity at the present time, again with respect to the Moon, is 3,289 feet per second. And we are now 1 hour 27 minutes away time at which we anticipate the crew will be awakening. At 55 hours 3 minutes this is Apollo Control Houston.</span>

And we've seen no signs of activity aboard the spacecraft at this point, however, we could hear from the crew almost any time between now and the next 30 minutes. And if we haven't heard from them within about 30 minutes we'll be putting in a call - a wake up call to the crew. Here in the control center the next team of flight controllers beginning to come on duty. Flight director, Neil Hutchinson, will be relieving flight director, Gene Kranz. And the spacecraft communicator on the upcoming shift is to be astronaut Gordon Fullerton. He'll be replacing CAPCOM, Bob Parker. Apollo 17, at this time, is 62,415 nautical miles from the moon and traveling at a speed of some 3,280 feet per second and we show a range to Earth now of 170,650 nautical miles. We'll bring up the lines and monitor live  at this point for any call from the crew. At 55 hours 59 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.</span>

Apparently the crew either does not have their volume turned up enough to hear the calls from the ground or perhaps the ear plug has slipped out of the ear of the crewman who's to monitor last night which I understand was Evans. Therefore, about every 10 minutes the CAPCOM is going to give a wake up call to the crew again in an attempt to raise them. Spacecraft Communicator Bob Parker is - has unplugged from the CAPCOM Console and is being replaced by Gordo Fullerton. And when we see on telemetry that the voice subcarrier from the spacecraft has been turned on, we'll play the old fight song again: Jayhawk Fight Song, University of Kansas. And, eventually we may get these sleepheads awake. At 56:58 Ground Elapsed Time, Apollo 17 is 60,471 nautical miles out from the Moon, approaching at a velocity of 3,285 and our slant range in nautical miles from the Earth to the spacecraft is 171,985 nautical miles.

The crew at this time having a belated breakfast, having overslept about an hour, despite many attempts to raise them by playing the Kansas fight-song and the crew alarm being sent up on the up-link, which causes a warbling sound in the headsets. However, apparently, Ron Evans, who was on watch was unable to hear, since likely the earplug had fallen out of his ear while stirring around in his sleep. Some amount of levity there is - it was suggested that their pay be docked or they should be charged with one hour of annual leave at any rate. The spacecraft is presently 58,073, it's just now changed, 58,067 nautical miles out from the Moon approaching an ever increasing velocity as they draw near the moon now 3,284 feet per second.

That little storm - fairly big storm - that was off the coast of northwest Africa yesterday, has moved inland and presumably is giving those people up there some weather. Might even be getting some snow up in the Atlas Mountains. It's still fairly well organized and inland a few hundred miles - or the edge of it is inland a few hundred miles. The people at the Cape of Good Hope ought to be seeing some clouds that are forerunners of a large circulation system that's south-southwest of them - that, although large, seems to have most of its heavy clouds to the southeast of the center. And they may not get any major weather out of this one. But they'll probably have cloudiness for a few days. The storm that was over Buenos Aires yesterday has apparently moved out to sea and is now west - or east-southeast of that area. Otherwise the - except for those three storm areas, the South Atlantic looks relatively calm. The zero phase point is now off the - east coast of South America, and it looks fairly dull and gray. And I suspect no extensive choppiness in that area.</span>

On the international/national scene: There's another reported snag in negotiations between Dr. Henry Kissinger and North Vietnam's Le Duc Tho. The two have discussed the peace terms since Monday; but, so far, little news concerning the talks has been released by either side. They meet again today. A judge in the Pentagon Papers trial of Daniel Ellsburg has declared a mistrial. Judge Matt Burn has asked that a new jury be selected. Both sides in the cases must now go back to the beginning and prepare their arguments again. Former President Harry Truman is still hospitalized with a serious heart condition. Although listed in critical condition, the 88-year-old former Chief Executive has shown some improvement, according to his daughter, Margaret Truman Daniel. President Nixon has completed selection of his new cabinet by announcing that he will keep Richard Kleindienst as Attorney General, There will be a number of major changes, though, in upper levels of the Justice and Interior Departments. Life Magazine will be no more as of the end of December. The pictorial magazine lost over 30 million dollars during the past 4 years. No doubt some of the final pictures to appear in the famous 36-year-old publication will be those of the Apollo 17 mission. An airliner crashed at Midway Airport in Chicago, Friday. Of the 6l persons aboard, only l8 survived the crash. In other national and international highlights: Unemployment figures show a drop to the lowest level in 2 years; 5.6 billion dollars has been released by the Federal Government in the first revenue-sharing payment to the state and local governments; and the NATO foreign ministers have urged the Soviet Union to cut down troop strength and allow freer movement of people over the east-west borders. In local and regional news: New hijack control devices have been installed at Houston Intercontinental Airport. The new metal detectors are being installed in many airports around the United States. New inspection procedures will also begin in January - of all hand luggage carried aboard airliners. And on the sports page: Al Conover is not going to return to Wake Forest as rumored. The Rice coach has met with University President Dr. Norman Hackerman to discuss a firm 5-year contract agreement. Professional football highlights today's sports; the "Over-the-Hill-Gang" from Washington with Billy Kilmer and Larry Brown will take on the Dallas Cowboys at Texas Stadium in Irving. The Cowboys will, no doubt, go with Craig Morton at quarterback. Dallas can ensure itself of a "wild card" slot in the playoffs with the Redskins, if they win. For Dallas, it's a revenge game. The Skins have won nine straight. Johnny Bench, the Cincinnati Reds all-everything catcher, has been hospitalized for tests. X-rays showed a spot on a lung. Doctors feel sure the lesion is benign, though. The University of Houston basketball team takes on Xavier tonight. The Cougars, with four wins and one loss, will face a Xavier team that likes to play slowdown basketball. The Houston Rockets beat the Portland, Oregon, Trailblazers last night in Hofheinz, 114 to 108. The Big Eight Athletic Conference has joined the Big Ten and the Ohio Athletic Conference in breaking relations with the U.S. Olympic Committee. Back in Houston again: Bill Peterson, the Oiler coach, says he's not planning on new assistant coaches. He says, "The Oilers need more togetherness with their coaches, not new ones." And a final item: the Des Moines, Iowa, post office was emptying a mail pouch. One package fell on the floor, broke open, and spilled all over the place. The contents were Postal Service instructions on how to wrap and mail packages to insure safe transit and delivery.</span>

Most of the 55 passengers - There were - well, I'm not sure I'm getting all the numbers right here. But it said here that most of the 55 passengers were found dead in the debris of a - and it was a Boeing 737 about a half a mile away from the airport. One of the victims was representative George Collins, a Democrat from Illinois - who was returning from Washington to organize a children's Christmas party. The weather, at the time, was a 500-foot ceiling and 1-mile visibility. And sleet and snow were falling at the time. There were no reports that any occupants of the houses were injured or killed. I turn back to the back of the paper, here. A United spokesman said one of the six crewmembers, a stewardess, was among16 persons admitted to Holy Cross Hospital. She said there were two infants among the passengers. Jet apparently missed runway 13 at Midway on - and cruised over the neighborhood of bungalow homes at heights of 500 to 1000 feet and then with his nose up and tail down tore into the dwellings. Witnesses said the plane scraped the roofs of two bungalows and sheared through six houses, setting them aflame. The fuselage of the airliner split, but the nose remained intact. A tail section was sticking out of one house. The plummetting airliner sheared through utility lines and a 2-square-mile area was blacked out. Telephone service was knocked out. A power company spokesman said 5000 homes were affected.</span>

We think we've got a pretty good handle on what the problem was - and that was, that the - the LM communications gear, we think, was jumping on the voice subcarrier, rather than the main carrier. And the symptoms that we had point to that. What would happen is, when I would try to transmit, then it would lose lock as soon as I put modulation on the voice subcarrier. During the checks today, we're going to try to verify that the system is indeed working okay. And we can do it without any changes in the onboard procedures by - purely by procedures that will be handled at the ground site and here at Mission Control. And so that's what we're planning to do. We really don't - The problem that happened has been seen before, evidently; and it's not that unusual. We really don't think there's anything wrong with the onboard equipment. Over.</span>

When you get a - a moment, when it's convenient, we'd like you to go up to the latch number 4 there, the one that's been giving us trouble, and we'd like you - well, we think it's just half cocked and we'd like you to stroke it. We think it will probably cock on one - with one more stroke. We'd like you to stroke it at least twice more to verify that it is fully cocked. And as you do stroke the handle, we'd like you to notice approximately what point in the - in the throw that the resistance increases. I think that summarizes what we want you to do, if you keep us advised as you go along.</span>

At any rate the spacecraft is 177,966 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a velocity of 2,652 feet per second in - with reference to the Earth. And as soon as the space digital display goes back to the Moon reference, we'll read those numbers off. We're waiting for the call from the crew that they have completed stowing or installing the probe and drogue assembly in closing out the tunnel. At 61:51 standing by this is Apollo Control.</span>

It's clear enough now to even see the coral reefs down off of Florida. And it looks like west Texas is probably also pretty clear, at least in a run from east to west.

                <span class="spokenwords">Geno, I'll read you the PAO release; they summed up pretty well, and I'll just use their words here. The time has been made up in two increments. The first one of 1 hour and 45 minutes in the Flight Plan. The crew activities were jumped ahead by 1 hour, and they essentially began doing those things that were called for 1 hour later in the Flight Plan. They will again jump ahead an hour and 40 minutes, and that will occur at 65 hours. By that time they will have completed all those activities required up through 67 hours and 40 minutes in the Flight Plan. Or, in other words, they will have completed all the activities required to get them into lunar orbit 2 hours and 40 minutes early, and in order to make the clocks then agree with where the crew will be in the Flight Plan, we'll jump the clocks ahead 2 hours and 40 minutes. This clock update, which can be likened to going on daylight saving time, only 2 hours and 40 minutes worth of change instead of 1 hour of change as we do on daylight saving time, will occur at 65 hours when the crew will have completed all of those Flight Plan activities up through 67 hours and 40 minutes. (Chuckle) This simply involves setting our clock to 65 hours in the Control Center and aboard the spacecraft to 65 hours, moving them ahead to 67 hours and 40 minutes. Then, barring any further changes in the mission time line, from that point on, the elapsed time clocks, which are used as a cue to Flight Plan activities, should agree with the Flight Plan and events that, in the Flight Plan are called out for a certain time will happen at that time on the elapsed time clocks (laughter) in Mission Control and aboard the spacecraft. (Laughter) This is a convenience factor.</span>

And when it gets up about the latitude of Tierra del Fuego, but quite a bit west of that land, it branches out to the east and west in a large mushroom pattern. And, it looks like the top of that mushroom may be a curved cold front that's pushing its way up into the southeast Pacific. It currently - the eastern edge of that front is probably 10 degrees longitude from Tierra del Fuego, and it looks like that land in southern Chile is picking up high clouds, probably associated with that front's movement.</span>

And November November, we think, has just - has just nine frames remaining now. The two nonscheduled magazines are OO and PP; 160 frames each. Those are the ones provided for optional use. We have 44 additional frames scheduled out of November November, scheduled during lunar orbit. There is only nine left in it now, so we'd like to save at least 60 frames out of either Oscar Oscar or Papa Papa, the two optional magazines, to cover the scheduled frames. Guess what we're saying is there's no problem. We've still got plenty of film, but you will have to use some of your optional mags for scheduled pictures. Sixty frames is what we want to save.</span>

But I just put Ron's polarizing filter in front of the monocular, looking at the Earth and rotate 90 degrees, and from max to min in terms of brightness, there's a remarkable change. And I suspect that means that the Earth is polarizing light enough to see it. The main thing that happens is that the oceans get considerably darker when I rotate the filter towards the dark position anyway. The continents don't seem to show any obvious change, but the oceans and the zero phase point darken - oh, I would guess by a factor of two in brightness. Maybe that's an extreme, but I think it's that.</span>

Actually two of them tied together, one starting up probably southeast of Australia and - and then heading down with a long arcing frontal system to another clockwise rotational parrot's - parrot's cone, I should say, down around - near the tip of South America, between it and Antarctica. There is one strong tributary front heading up to the north-northwest from the western side of this big, arcing, frontal mass. And I think that's probably what you're referring to. I'm not sure.

The one down near - near the continent of Antarctica, down there, near the tip of South America, seemed to be squashed slightly as if there is possibly some - some squashing or effect coming off - off the South Pole area near Antarctica. I think, if I turn around and look at it the way Jack was looking at it, it's a cap of a mushroom.
