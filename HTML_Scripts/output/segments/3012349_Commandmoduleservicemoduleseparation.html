Velocity now 12,611 feet per second. This velocity will triple by the time they reach the atmosphere. Current predicted velocity at atmospheric entry 36,090 feet per second at an angle of minus 6.5 degrees. Command Module Pilot, Ron Evans, at the present time, is donning the so called counter-pressure garment which is being evaluated for possible future space programs as a protection against cardiovascular changes that occur to the human body after long missions. The midcourse correction burn number 7 went off on time very nominally. Little over 9 seconds burn time with two RCS jets. A change in velocity of 2.1 feet per second. In the landing area in the South Pacific the National Weather Service said, this morning, that weather conditions are expected to be satisfactory. Weather forecast for the planned landing area, 360 nautical miles southeast of Pago Pago is for partly cloudly skies, easterly winds at 10 miles, seas at 3 feet, and a temperature of near 77 degrees. 2 hours 38 minutes away from entry and at 301:40 Ground Elapsed Time in the mission of Apollo 17, this is Apollo Control.</span>
