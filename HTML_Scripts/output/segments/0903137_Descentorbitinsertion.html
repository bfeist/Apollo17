Did you - did you tell us a few minutes ago that you did indeed do all those at about 6 minutes?</span>

The INCO did send LOW BIT RATE, COMMAND, just prior to - to LOS there before LOI, which is the way it's called out in the Flight Plan. And then you should have come along later with a COMMAND RESET, setting the switch to HIGH BIT RATE, and the COMMAND RESET switched into HIGH BIT RATE mode, and for some reason it did not go into HIGH BIT RATE.</span>

I tell you, in the mare, there just is no visible relief. Although there seem to be some sinuous systematics anyway to the distribution. Like, there'll be a very dark area associated with the light area. And that dark area is darker than the mare. I think the pictures will show that. Now, in the highlands, however, the - the light albedo areas, which are very comparable, that appear to be swirllike patterns of the same type, seem to be associated with a crest of crater ridges and other high points. We're on over - right over a concentration of these now in the northern part of Marginis, where the rule of a - of the light areas being associated with a - either - either symmetrically around a much darker area than the normal mare, or on one side, and in this case, generally the south side - of a dark area is - that rule is very clear.

During this pass Jack Schmitt saw a flash just north of the crater Grimaldi at an elapsed time of 90 hours 18 minutes and thought it might be a meteor impact. We could not confirm that; however, the Moon was still ringing from the S-IVB impact and would mask out other activity on seismometer recorders in the science support room here. Apollo 17 will perform the Descent Orbit Insertion maneuver behind the Moon just after the start of the third revolution and at a point near perilune the low point in that revolution. Ignition time for that maneuver is 93 hours 11 minutes 36 seconds. Delta-V change of velocity of 197.4 feet per second. Duration of the burn 22 seconds and we anticipate a result orbit of 58.9 by 14.5 nautical miles. If the burn is performed as expected we'll next acquire Apollo 17 at 93 hours 34 minutes 24 seconds. If Apollo 17 is unable to perform the burn acquisition time will be 93 hours 31 minutes 37 seconds. We'll come back up just prior to the no burn acquisition time and stand by through that period of several minutes. At 92 hours 51 minutes this is mission control Houston.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">Okay. There's not a whole lot of news on the wire tonight, matter of fact. President Nixon received a firsthand report on private Vietnam peace negotiations today from a key member of the U.S. negotiating team, General Alexander Haig, Jr., Henry Kissinger's Chief Lieutenant. Haig flew back from Paris to report to the President, while technical experts from both sides held an unusual Sunday meeting in the French capitol. Presidential Assistant Kissinger will resume his talks with North Vietnam's Le Duc Tho on Monday after a 1-day recess. And former President Harry Truman continued to show some signs of improvement late today after he was earlier removed from the critical list at Research Hospital up - up in Kansas City. His cardiac situation has improved, and this improvement included a slower and stronger pulse and a stable blood pressure. The football scores are as follows in the National Football League today: The Bears defeated the Eagles 21 to 12; the Detroit Lions and the Buffalo Bills played to a 21-21 standoff; Dolphins extended their undefeated streak 23 to 13 over the New York Giants; the Patriots defeated the New Orleans Saints 17 to 10; Green Bay sewed up the Central Division of the NFC by defeating the Vikings 23 to 7; the Cardinals upset the Rams today 24 to l4; Denver defeated San Diego 38-13; Kansas City upset Baltimore 24 to 10; the 49ers defeated the Falcons 20 to nothing, 20 to 0; and Pittsburg defeated Houston 9 to 3, and they - they took the Central Division of the AFC. So the playoff picture is becoming a little clearer. You've got - in the NFC, you've got Washington, Dallas, and Green Bay. And the fourth team will either be San Francisco, Los Angeles, or Atlanta. That will be decided next week. In the AFC, Pittsburg, Miami, and Oakland are in it. And the fourth team will be either the Jets - and another team. They've got the Giants listed here, but it can't be the Giants because that's the wrong division. So we'll - we'll check that one out. Cleveland; okay, Cleveland. The fourth team is either going to be Cleveland or the Jets.</span>

We've lost contact with the antenna because of it's attitude, about 50 seconds early. During this 4th pass on the front side of the Moon there was considerable description of the Lunar surface and photography was accomplished. The mapping camera experts will continue to study the extension and retraction times of the camera. If those times continue to grow, they will probably revise the Flight Plan somewhat to reduce the number of times that camera must be extended and retracted. At the present time though they are just keeping a close eye on those times to see whether they will continue to grow. We'll next acquire Apollo 17 on it's 5th revolution of the Moon at 97 hours 22 minutes.</span>

Flight Director, Pete Frank and members of the Orange Team, are preparing to hand over flight control duties to Flight Director, Gene Kranz and the White Team at this time. There will be no change of shift news conference. Shortly after the Orange Team came on duty, the Descent Orbit Insertion number 1 maneuver was performed. At 93 hours 11 minutes 36 seconds, this was a very good burn. Duration 22 seconds. Velocity change of 198.2 feet per second. Resultant orbit was 59.1 by 14.9 nautical miles. Apollo 17 crew since that time has been performing landmark tracking through the sextant, a great deal of photography, and performing the ultraviolet spectrometer and infrared scanning radiometer experiments, and providing surface descriptions, the geology reports and some Earth weather reports from lunar orbit. The infrared experiment will be continued throughout the rest period that the crew is now in. The ultraviolet experiment has been terminated for tonight. The mapping camera is taking longer to extend and retract than expected. And the last operation took 1 minute 24 seconds to extend and 1 minute 51 seconds to retract. Each of these operations should be accomplished in 1 minute 12 seconds. The camera experts will continue to watch this and if the delayed operation continues, they may reduce the number of times that the camera is extended and retracted. Crew said goodnight at 97 hours 47 minutes. They're anticipating a big day tomorrow, landing, first EVA. 7 hours 49 minutes remaining in that rest period. Apollo 17's present orbit is 59.1 by 13.5 nautical miles. And a short time ago the flight dynamics officer gave the flight director the latest impact coordinates for the S-IVB which impacted the lunar surface today at 89 hours 39 minutes 40 seconds. Coordinates for that impact: 4.21 degrees south latitude, 12.31 degrees west longitude. At 98 hours 55 minutes this is mission control Houston.</span>

Here in Mission Control, Flight Director Gene Kranz has been reviewing the status of the mission with his oncoming team of flight controllers. No problems of note to be reported. The service propulsion system engine, it was reported, looks to be in very good shape as a result of the, or based on the data that we received during the LOI and DOI, the Lunar Orbit Insertion and Descent Orbit Insertion maneuvers performed earlier. The Flight Dynamics Officer, during this shift, is going to be following the spacecraft trajectory very closely looking for any cross range or down range errors which would need to be compensated for prior to the lunar landing. We don't expect any conversations with the crew. We have had confirmation of acquisition of signal now and we'll stand by for a short period of time to get a look at the systems and to assure that we're not going to get a call from the crew.</span>

In fact, the 2 crewmen on whom we have biomedical data, Ron Evans and Jack Schmitt, appeared to have gone to sleep almost as soon as they said goodnight. Very shortly thereafter the surgeon noted the slow down in heart rhythms typical of sleep. And that is the condition they were in when we last saw them at the end of the sixth revolution. And we have reacquired radio contact with Apollo 17 and getting good data from the spacecraft at this time. The crew is scheduled to end this 8 hour rest period in a little over 4 and one half hours from now. And it appears that everything is quiet aboard Apollo 17 and no signs of any crew activity.

Our last look at the spacecraft's lunar orbit showed it to be maintaining an orbit fairly close to 13 nautical miles by 59 nautical miles, actually dropping down somewhat below 13 on the pericynthion to about 12.6. And we should have radio contact with the spacecraft shortly, and we'll begin getting telemetry data on all of the spacecraft systems. We have 46 minutes showing until scheduled crew wakeup time. And we've had the AOS call, Acquisition of Signal, getting good high bit rate data at this time. And the flight dynamics officer's orbit display shows Apollo 17 to be in an orbit of a high point of 59.9 nautical miles. The low point or pericynthion of 12.5.

We'll be reacquiring in about 45 minutes - a little bit less, as the spacecraft comes back on the front side on the tenth revolution. And by that time the crew should have completed breakfast. They'll be getting the pressure suits unstowed and begin preparations for entering the lunar module, for the separation, landing on the lunar surface, and the first EVA, all scheduled to occur this day. The IR data which Joe Allen advised the crew we're getting in such good form back here on the ground from the spacecraft's service module, is from the IR scanning radiometer. This is an instrument carried in the CSM SIM bay, Scientific Instrument Module bay. And it's obtaining surface temperatures under the groundtrack of the spacecraft from which scientist will be able to construct a temperature map. From this information they hope to be able to characterize such lunar surface physical parameters as the general conductivity, the bulk density, and the specific heat. Apollo 17 at the present time is in an orbit about 59 nautical miles at it's high point and about 12-1/2 miles above the lunar surface at the low point. At 106 hours 5 minutes this is Apollo Control Houston.</span>

We're about 2 minutes now from reacquiring Apollo 17 as the spacecraft comes back around on the front side of the Moon on the tenth revolution. And when we again establish radio contact the crew should have pretty well finished breakfast and be getting suited up, ready for Jack Schmitt and Gene Cernan to enter the lunar module and begin preparations for separation, powered descent to the lunar surface. Here in the control center we're in the process of a shift handover. Flight Director, Gerry Griffin, and the team of flight controllers who will be on during today's powered descent are now coming on to replace the Gene Kranz team. Flight Director Neil Hutchinson will be in charge of CSM activities once the two vehicles separate. CAPCOM for the lunar module will be Astronaut Gordon Fullerton and Astronaut Ken Mattingly is moving in taking up position at the console to handle CSM activities. And we're now about 30 seconds away from reacquiring Apollo 17.</span>
