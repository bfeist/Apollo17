And I remember remarks at that time, "Gee, if we could see it like this when we came back in, we'd have to close our eyes." If we can see this thing coming in like I think we may be able to see it at 50 miles, it isn't going to look like very much.</span>

Some 1 hour and 38 minutes until ignition on lunar orbit insertion. Presently, the spacecraft is 4,243 nautical miles away from the Moon. The Moon is getting larger, as noted by the crew. They considered closing the window shades in the spacecraft. Velocity now 4,544 feet per second. Some numbers on acquisition of the spacecraft. With the burn - a normal burn, the acquisition on the east limb of the Moon would be at 89 hours 16 minutes 29 seconds. Without a burn, it would be somewhat sooner, 89 hours 7 minutes 46 seconds. A private conversation was conducted with the Apollo 17 crew from Ground Elapsed Time of 85:46:55 to 86:04:46. The subject of the conversation was Gene Cernan's request for suggestions concerning alleviating some gas symptoms he had had during the flight. The following is a summary of the conversation. The call to the crew was made by Donald K. Slayton, Director of Flight Crew Operations. Dr. Royce Hawkins, Chief of Medical Operations at MSC asked Cernan to explain his symptoms, Cernan reported it was no great problem, but that he has had some greater gas discomfort than his fellow crew members. He said he felt quite fine at this time, and there was never any pain or nausea associated with the discomfort. Cernan advised Dr. Hawkins of the anti-gas medication, symethocone, he'd been taking. Dr. Hawkins recommended to Cernan that he continue the medication after meals and before going to sleep. Hawkins also advised Cernan on some changes to his menu over the next 2 days to reduce the discomfort. Cernan reported quote "I'm better, there's nothing detrimental or incapacitating about this; we're all in good shape. We hope things are looking as good down there as they are up here." close quote. Lunar Module pilot Harrison Schmitt reported the crew had encountered some difficulty with the onboard system that separates gas bubbles from the drinking water supply. Schmitt was advised that the gas separator system has given the crews problems on previous Apollo flights. Astronaut John Young, Commander of the Apollo 16 mission and Back-up Commander for Apollo 17, also talked briefly to the Astronauts, and wished them well. Distance now 4,125 nautical miles from the Moon. Velocity 4,570. Still an hour and 35 minutes, MARK, until ignition on lunar orbit insertion burn. At 87:19, this is Apollo Control.</span>

Some 26 minutes now until Apollo 17 passes behind the Moon, coming up on the Lunar Orbit Insertion burn in which the spacecraft will start its initial orbit measuring 52 nautical miles by 170 nautical miles, an elliptical orbit around the Moon. That maneuver will take place at a Ground Elapsed Time of 88 hours 54 minutes into the flight, and will slow the spacecraft down considerably from its present velocity of some 5,700 feet per second. Presently, the Apollo 17 spacecraft is 1,528 nautical miles out from the Moon, approaching at 5730 feet per second. After the spacecraft passes behind the Moon, 25 minutes from now, assuming as successful lunar orbit insertion burn, it should come from behind the east face of the Moon, the limb of the Moon, at approximately 33 minutes later. It'll take a few moments for the ground stations to lock up on the downlink from the spacecraft even though the theoretical contact time is roughly 33 minutes after loss of signal. At 88 hours 18 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.</span>

We have had loss of signal as Apollo 17 coasted behind the Moon on the start of the first lunar orbit, 10 minutes and 28 seconds away from Lunar Orbit Insertion maneuver. A retrograde service propulsion system burn of some 2,988 feet per second. Assuming a successful burn, the spacecraft should come out from behind the Moon at 89:16:29 Ground Elapsed Time as Gene Cernan promised it would before they went behind the Moon. At loss of signal, the spacecraft was some 395 miles above the surface of the Moon, traveling at a velocity of 7,241 feet per second. 9 minutes and 30 seconds - MARK, until LOI ignition. At 88:44 and returning just before acquisition of signal, as Apollo 17 comes from behind the Moon, this is Apollo Control.</span>

Some 55 seconds until Apollo 17 comes from behind the Moon, on the start of the first Lunar Orbit. We're awaiting appearance of the spacecraft and word that the burn went successful, which apparently it has because the spacecraft without a burn would have appeared some 8 minutes ago. The ignition time i s 88:54:21 in Ground Elapsed Time. Should be getting lock on fairly soon, zero. That was the theoretical acquisition time. Of course, it does take a few seconds for the ground station to lock onto the signal from the spacecraft. We're awaiting word from the communications officer that we have indeed gotten a signal and telemetry from the spacecraft.</span>

Here in the Control Center we are hearing the crew aboard the spacecraft of Apollo 17 very clearly, however the ground has not be able to fully lock up on the spacecraft with the so-called uplink, on the voice uplink. And apparently it has to do with the 85 foot antenna at Goldstone. We're continuing to stand by until the 2-way communications are complete. An hour and 20 minutes before loss of signal as we go across the face of the Moon, the front face of the Moon on the first Lunar Orbit. At 89:20 and standing by, this is Apollo Control.</span>

When I turned on bank A, the chamber pressure came up to 87 percent, and stayed there essentially. Five seconds later, I put on band B, the chamber pressure rose to 90 - about 91 - somewhere in that area. And then, throughout the burn, chamber pressure increased, which you'll see on the strip chart. But I was sure surprised at only 87 percent when we started it. It looked like the velocity gained versus time was correct throughout the burn, though. The maximum the chamber pressure ever got to was about 97 percent, and that was toward the end of the burn.</span>

Before we really got concentrating on the burn, and I had an opportunity to - we all had an opportunity to look at Korolev, at a very low grazing Sun, one of the striking things was the - to me was the extreme absence of relief, the very smooth surface that existed in Korolev, independent, of course, of the craters that are penetrating that surface. And it looked like there was a ring in the floor - outsi - next to the wall, about maybe one-sixth of a crater radius, that was somewhat brighter at the low grazing Sun, suggesting it may have had a different slope. And I believe I'm correct in saying that the inner floor may be slightly raised. We'll try to make other observations this next time around on that one, but there was just a very smooth floor. The light plains material in that crater is very smooth.</span>

You can see the ray patterns in Copernicus moderately well. You can even tell that they do cross Eratosthenes. Stadius shows up as a very clear dark area to the southwest of Eratosthenes. Now, one of the things that we mapped on the southeast and south rim of Copernicus were dark albedo areas within the ejecta. And those are apparent here, very clearly. And also, within - on the upper portion of the rim and on the benches, in that quadrant. The walls - there are the dark spots - lower albedo material that we mapped. They are - form linear patterns along the benches, apparently. Although the bench - the topography is not too clear. But the dark spots are in arcuate linear arrangement parallel to the rim. And they appear to have - be elongate along radius - along the radius of the crater.</span>

Copernicus H is also very obvious as a dark-rimmed crater, relative to the albedo of the ejecta blanket. And the northwest quadrant, which we mapped as a smooth floor material and somewhat darker albedo, is just as apparent here, although all the contrasts, of course, are less. The main thing that you can pick out in earthshine are albedo distinctions. Now - now we - we - I remember that we also, at one time - and I can't remember whether it made the final map or not - mapped an arcuate fault structure, based on the change in albedo. And this was on the southwest quadrant of Copernicus. And that crossed the southern rim, more or less north-south, went down and curved across the floor and up the southwest rim, and that is a very clear arcuate pattern in this lighting. Darker albedo than the rest of the crater. And along the arc, there appear to be a couple or three even darker spots - much as we thought we saw in some of the early photography.</span>

Now there's - I'm getting - essentially directly overhead, and again the dark spots within the crater wall are still apparent, and the streaming or the radial elongation of these spots is clear. Now, on the lower wall - that's below the first bench - I can see four of these dark areas, and on the next wall above that, above the first bench, there are two - two obvious ones and a couple that are somewhat more subtle.</span>

Now this is not mare; it's lighter albedo, lighter reflectivity than the mare, and, although there are patches of mare in the lower areas in it. But looking along that plain, in fact, a lar - a long linear plain, it - it looks quite smooth with only some very broad undulations that appear to be roughly radial to Orientale itself. The more - closer we get to it, the more I see minor relief showing up. I start to see the shadows, I guess. And that relief seems to bring out a hummocky texture in - in addition to the craters you would expect to see there.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">I won't try to give you a trend on the hummocks because I think the shadows are biasing my view; they do ap	pear to be north-south trending, but I think that is because of the shadow patterns. This is a spectacular sight, you guys; you ought to take a look at Orientale. One of the largest fresh basins on the Moon. It still is probably 4 billion years old, or 3.8 at any rate, if our dating criteria are any - any good. It has the outer Cordillerian ring and the inner ring called the Rook Mountains - very, very nicely shown. There are massifs on that inner ring, the Rook Mountain ring; there are massif complexes much like what we'll be studying at Taurus-Littrow. There are low areas, nonmare areas, that are comparable to some - to the Taurus - the valley that we'll be landing in. And, all in all, I think we'll find that our ring in the Taurus-Littrow area around Serenitatis is comparable in many regards to this Rook Mountain ring around Orientale. You want - did you interrupt, Gordy?</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">Okay; I thought I heard your key. Okay; in the inner portion of Orientale, as we approach a terminator, the lighting is still excellent. Matter of fact, it appears brighter than what we were looking at over at Copernicus. Now, part of that may be we're seeing much sharper relief since the slope - Earth-facing slopes are nicely lit, and the backfacing slopes, of course, are in shadow. The first portion of the bench inside the Rook Mountains is partially filled by mare. Now, the higher land in there is very smooth, in a gross sense, is a very smooth hummocky terrain, cut by roughly circumferential grabens. The trend of the hummocks themselves are not radial; they're more - well, they're about a 45-degree angle to the radius. They, in detail, have a much finer hackly texture, much like we've been able to see on photographs before. And, in general, you get the impression that, in several areas here, that that hackly tex-tured surface is draped over material that resembles the massifs of the Rook Mountains themselves. There's one area just to the north now of our track where there's a large, roughly equidimensional mountain mass, with a few projections of massiflike peaks through this hackly textured surface.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">There are also some radial grabens; I just now picked one up, which we've also seen on the Orientale photographs taken by Lunar Orbiter. It's amazing how fresh appearing this basin looks, considering its great age. But it's - it probably is not - had any more violent a history than Imbrium. Now, we're getting up, just about to go over a delta-rim crater that's out in the basin. I don't remember the name of it offhand. But it's - be familiar to some of the geologists who have mapped this basin. It does not appear to have a strong impact ejecta blanket around it. It's filled with mare, and it's quite sharply in contrast to a crater of comparable size to the northwest. See that one, Ron; I don't know whether you can get it. I get a good view out of 5 now of that one. And, once again, it looks as if this hackly textured material that forms the higher hills in the inner bench - has a draped appearance over the, over preexisting terrain, and, in fact, along the ridges of the hummocks, you - we now can pick up little rilles that roughly parallel the hummocks, although not - not - not consistently. They do cross down into the valleys. But it has appearance that there may have been a tensional relief along the crest of each of the hummocks, or many of the hummocks.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">Delta-rim crater just as has been, I think, discussed in the literature, has just that, delta rim with no obvious ejecta blanket around it, compared to other larger craters within the basin. We're directly over that crater right now. It's filled with mare, very smooth mare. Matter of fact, within that fill, I can see no - no craters. Getting very close to the Earth terminator, but you see good texture in the ejecta blanket of the large crater in the north part of the inner basin of Orientale. The radial ridge and valley patterns are very clear; the concentric coarse hummocks near the rim are apparent; and you can even see the second - patterns of secondaries, the larger secondaries, extending out away - radially out away from that crater. The south - the mare fill in the south floor of Copernicus, I mean of Orientale, is very smooth but does have the sea-swell texture that we saw over in Tranquillitatis.</span>
