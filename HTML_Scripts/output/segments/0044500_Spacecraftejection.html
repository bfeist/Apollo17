The Indian Ocean out into the Pacific Ocean and back into the Atlantic Ocean. And for the most part relatively clear of clouds except in the Antarctica region, and up towards Europe which is - which is on the horizon, across the Mediterranean, it looks like there might be some clouds back up in that way.

                <span class="spokenwords">This is Apollo Control at 5 hours 30 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The white team of flight controllers, headed by Gene Krantz, is in the process now, of handing over to the team headed by flight director Pete Frank. After 12 hours, the team came on about 3 hours prior to the scheduled launch time of 8:53 PM Central Standard Time. Of course, launch occurred 2 hours 40 minutes late at a Ground Elapsed Time of 11, - of a Central Standard Time rather, 11:33 PM. As a result of the late launch-time the trans-lunar injection, that's up through translunar injection, also slipped 2 hours, 40 minutes. We would expect that the translunar injection which is targeted to make up the difference will get us back on the nominal flight plan time by the time the spacecraft arrives at the Moon. In other words, arrival time at the Moon would be at the same Central Standard Time as called for in the Flight Plan at about 1:49 PM Central Standard Time, December 10. But, the Ground Elapsed Time would be about 2 hours, 40 minutes earlier than that provided for in the Flight Plan, the arrival being at about 86 hours, 14 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The 2 hour, 40 minute difference being accounted for in a speedier arrival time at the Moon, a translunar injection burn being targeted just slightly longer than would have been the case in a normal launch. The spacecraft getting to the Moon in a total elapsed time 2 hours 40 minutes less, in effect, making up for lost time from the late launch. In order to get the flight plan back in agreement with the Ground Elapsed Time the GET, or ground elapsed clock, will simply be moved ahead 2 hours, 40 minutes between now and the time spacecraft arrives at the Moon. So, that by the time Apollo 17 is inserted into Lunar Orbit, the GET will once again agree with the flight plan GET and of course, the Central Standard Time of arrival will be the same as was originally planned by virtue of a speedier trip time. As a result of the late liftoff it was not possible to program television coverage of the transposition and docking. This was because of a shift in the orbital ground track moving the ground track away from the needed Manned Spaceflight network coverage for television. We simply didn't have an adequate ground station to receive the television signal from the spacecraft. There has been one recurring problem that is yet unexplained. That is in the displays and control system. The crew reported on several occassions that MASTER ALARM was occurring. The master alarm manifests itself in a form of a light that flashes in the Command Module. There are three of these lights and also a tone that comes on and a normal procedure is when the MASTER ALARM light comes on and the tone sounds, the crew then looks at another matrix of lights to determine precisely where the problem is. However, when looking at this matrix of lights none of them were lighted, indicating that some spurrious signal had ignited or lighted the MASTER ALARM light and that there was in fact no problem in the systems. There is at this point no explanation for the problem. However, engineers here in the Control Center, are looking into the past history of Panel 2, which is the panel on which a number of switches are located, which have triggered this master alarm, to see if there is a history of Panel 2 that would indicate a possibility of some momentary short in the caution and warning system, which could give a MASTER ALARM. The problem at this point is an annoyance, but does not appear to be a serious problem. All other spacecraft systems are performing normally, and the trajectory to the Moon is almost precisely as planned at this point. We do not anticipate a change of shift press briefing. The white team will be coming back on at the regualar Central Standard Time 4:00 PM tomorrow. And in light of this rather short turnaround we're going to forego the change of shift press briefing. At 5 hours, 36 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.</span>

The high clouds cast very distinct shadow patterns on the lower ones and, very commonly, had entirely different orientations -pattern orientations. The low ones seem to be more associated with arcuate front patterns; whereas, the high clouds were generally transverse to that, roughly north/south directions.

And you can, by very subtle changes in the apparent smoothness of the ground, probably make out where the actual continent begins and the pack ice ends. There are a few exposed ranges, I guess it's midsummer down there now, and you can make out the snow-free areas scattered at least in the northern portion of the continent.</span>

It, I think, was one I saw in some of the forecast sheets as a dissipating hurricane or typhoon. I'm not sure which it is there. I guess it's a typhoon. And I see something here that I noticed in Earth orbit, Bob. That as you approach the terminator - and now I'm looking at the eastern terminator - have to keep all my directions straight here - yes, eastern terminator. The clouds - those associated with the cyclone over India and one that's - appears to be due south of there - maybe 30 degrees of latitude - have a gray appearance. The - instead of the brilliant white of other clouds as you approach the terminator, those - at least the high level clouds are gray. Now, when we were going over them in orbit, the lower level clouds were still white, and I think I can see a hint of that right now. The Sun gives a strong light reflection off of the buildups in the low-level clouds; whereas, the high-level and probably layered cirrus and maybe some of the intermediate level stratus tend to look gray because of grazing Sun, I suspect.</span>

I can't remember what we - I think we put some of that on tape, and we were probably LOS at the time. But the banded character of the sunrise in the atmosphere was very, very marked. There was a gray-blue upper layer followed - that merged or graded into a brilliant blue intermediate zone that was just above the cloud levels. And within the clouds, you got a orange to yellow band, getting more yellow as the Sun rose, that was broken by the dark patterns of the buildups.</span>

That's approximately 200 kilometers east of the Apollo 14 ALSEP site where the seismometer is located. That impact is expected to be picked up by the other seismometers on the Moon, the other Apollo lunar surface experiment seismometers. Booster systems engineer is now maneuvering the S-IVB stage, the third stage of the launch vehicle to a solar heat control attitude. This is to minimize the heat into the instrument unit. They will then track the stage for a considerable length of time and determine whether another corrective burn will be required.

The Booster Systems Engineer has advised Flight Director Pete Frank that a second midcourse correction for the S-IVB, the third stage of the launch vehicle will be required. This maneuver is performed with the auxiliary propulsion system of the S-IVB, and the Booster Systems Engineer will command this burn at 11 hours 15 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The magnitude of the burn is not known at this time. That will be determined shortly before the midcourse is performed. The purpose is to tune up the trajectory to more precisely target the S-IVB stage to the desired impact point on the lunar surface. Tracking to this point of the spacecraft indicates that a midcourse correction will probably be performed for the spacecraft at the scheduled midcourse number 2 time at 35 hours and 30 minutes. A preliminary look - that's a very early look shows it to be about 10-1/2 feet per second, but that will be refined as we get closer to the time.

                <span class="spokenwords">This is Apolio Control at 9 hours 59 minutes. The Flight Dynamics Officer, Bill Boone, has computed the half way marks for the spacecraft in both time and distance. We'll give those to you now. Apollo 17 will reach the half way point in distance at a Ground Elapsed Time of 30 hours 3 minutes. Its distance from both the Moon and the Earth at that time will be 114,787 nautical miles. Its velocity, referenced to the Earth, will be 4,522 feet per second; referenced to the Moon, 3,826 feet per second. The half way mark in time will be reached at a Ground Elapsed Time of 43 hours 8 minutes 6 seconds. At that time Apollo 17 will be 144,924 miles from the Earth, with an Earth reference to velocity of 3,551 feet per second. And it will be 87,561 nautical miles from the Moon, with a Moon referenced velocity of 3,403 feet per second. Apollo 17 will cross the lunar sphere of influence at the Ground Elapsed Time of 70 hours 43 minutes 24 seconds, at which time it will be 190,725 nautical miles from the Moon. Earth referenced velocity 2,340 feet per second. Distance from the Moon at that time, 33,639 nautical miles, with the lunar referenced velocity of 3,356 feet per second. At 10 hours 1 minute into the mission, this is Mission Control Houston.</span>

Pete Frank and the orange team of flight controllers getting ready to hand over to Jerry Griffin and his gold team of flight controllers at this time. Astronaut Bob Parker will remain as the CAPCOM for a good deal of this next shift. Several spurrious master alarms that were seen while the spacecraft was still in Earth orbit are as yet unexplained. There are no obvious reasons for them. The spacecraft experts in the back rooms, the support rooms here at the Mission Control Center are still tracking this situation. It's not considered a serious problem. The more recent master alarms that have occurred during this shift and during the translunar coast phase after Apollo 17 burned translunar insertion, are attributed to a higher than normal oxygen flow at regular intervals in the cabin. The cabin is still being purged of the partial nitrogen atmosphere that it contained at launch that is being purged, a vent valve is open in the cabin and the higher than normal O2-rate has been introduced to help purge the cabin. Now, added to that when the water accumulator in the suit circuit cycles, there is a brief increase of oxygen flow over and above the higher than normal flow that we are using to purge the cabin. And this is just high enough to when the water accumulator cycles it brings it up just high enough to trigger the master alarm. It is not a problem. The last three or four master alarms that we have seen are attributed to this. However, the Earth orbit master alarms are not yet accounted for. But, they are not considered to be a serious problem. During this shift a midcourse correction number 1 was performed on the SIV-B stage of the launch vehicle, 13 feet per second performed with the auxilary propulsion system. A second midcourse for that third stage of launch vehicle is planned at a Ground Elapsed Time of 11 hours 15 minutes. The magnitude of the burn is not - is not yet known. These midcourses are to tune up the trajectory of that stage, to bring it closer to the desired impact point on the lunar surface. As far as the spacecraft is concerned midcourse correction number 1 was passed. We did not perform midcourse correction number 1. The magnitude at that time was less than 3 feet per second. We will probably perform a midcourse correction number 2 at 35 hours and 30 minutes. A preliminary look at that indicates about a 10-1/2 foot per second burn at that time. The Mission is going well. We have not heard from the crew for some time now and are confident that they are asleep. The spacecraft is in passive thermal-contro1 mode, stabilized in 1 revolution every 18 minutes, approximately 3 per hour. The crew is scheduled to be awakened 4 hours, 24 minutes from this time. At 10 hours 35 minutes into the Mission, this is Mission Control, Houston.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">This is Apollo Control at 11 hours 27 minutes Ground Elapsed Time into the mission of Apollo 17. Approximately 11 minutes ago, as you were 6 minutes ago, the S-IVB corrective burn was performed roughly 14.2 feet per second to modify the trajectory of the S-IVB third stage in the Saturn V, targeting for impact just west of the crater Ptolemaeus at latitude 7 degrees south by longitude 8 degrees west. However, the actual impact location and the time of impact will be forthcoming after some additional hours of tracking of the stage has been gathered. We're looking now at a midcourse correction burn number 2 of the Apollo 17 spacecraft at 35 hours 30 minutes, with a change in velocity - a posigrade of 10.5 feet per second. Some 3-1/2 hours remaining in the crew rest period. All three apparently sound asleep at this time. And the passive thermal control mode puts the spacecraft at spinning at some 3 revolutions per hour. To repeat earlier statistics on half way in distance, time, and when the so-called sphere of influence is crossed will be at the half way point in distance at 30 hours and 3 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, in which time it will be 114,787 nautical miles either direction to the Earth or Moon. And a half way point in time will occur at 43 hours 8 minutes and 6 seconds when the spacecraft will be 144,924 nautical miles out from Earth; and 87,561 nautical miles out from the Moon. The so-called sphere crossing, or the point in which the spacecraft is assumed to come under the gravitational influence of the Moon, will take place at 70 hours 43 minutes 24 seconds when the spacecraft is 33,639 nautical miles out from the Moon and approaching. The air/ground circuit has been up all of this time since the crew has retired for a fairly brief rest period, and at this time we will take down the air/ground circuit until the wakeup call is made some 3 hours 29 minutes from now. And at 11 hours 30 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.</span>

And Apollo 17 at the present time is 56,948 nautical miles out from earth at a velocity of 7,609 feet per second. A short time ago the Booster Systems Engineer Frank Van Renseler reported that after the final APS burn in the S-IVB stage, which is targeting the stage to impact on the Moon, he reported that the S-IVB stage was tumbling intentionally, after that burn, and as he gathered up all his documents and packed his briefcase, he, on the flight directors loop, he said, "I've enjoyed working with you on the Apollo program." Flight Director in training Neil Hutchinson replied "It's been nice riding with you." The riding implication being that they were riding on his launch vehicle. Van Renseler is a Marshall Spaceflight Center Engineer detailed to the Flight Control Division here at Manned Spacecraft Center. Van Rensleser finished his job for the last time. He packed his launch vehicle documents and left the room. The booster systems console is vacant for the final time in Apollo. Some 2-1/2 hours remaining in the crew sleep period. No word from the crew. They have not talked to the ground nor vice versa in the last several hours and at 12 hours 29 minutes this is Apollo Control.</span>

They will be awakened about 2:30 Central Time. This is a rather short sleep period slightly under 6 hours, the object being to get the crew back on to Houston time day-night cycle eventually. The cycle is disturbed somewhat by the, - initially what would have been a night launch, and ended up being a morning launch - early morning launch - at least by Cape time. Got a hand over to the Goldstone 210-foot tracking antenna, about 8 minutes ago. And that station at the present time is handling spacecraft data, and when the crew awakens will handle the voice transmissions between the Control Center and the Crew of Apollo 17.

Apollo 17 presently 65,273 nautical miles out from earth; velocity now 6,974 feet per second. And getting back on schedule with Apollo 17 because of the late liftoff and the hold situation early this morning. The translunar injection burn was targeted to get the spacecraft at the moon or into lunar orbit at about the same actual time as it would have had we launched on time - at 8:53 PM last night central time. However, to get the flight plan back on the actual indicated Ground Elapsed Times shown in the flight plan at approximately 64 hours they're going to have what is called a GET update some 2 hours and 40 minutes to force the event times in the flight plan to agree with actual Ground Elapsed Times flown in the mission. We'll come up again in about a half hour as Parker makes his initial wake up call to the crew and at 14 hours 29 minutes, this is Apollo Control.</span>

After their post-sleep checklist checking over the systems. The flight director just advised the CAPCOM to hold off on the wake call until they switch antennas. There's some P-23 navigation sightings that will be run today, and that apparently is about all the activity scheduled during the - this work period. However, there will be at 35 hours and 30 minutes a midcourse correction number 2, which this time looks like about 10 and a half feet per second. Apollo 17 now is 67,365 nautical miles out from the Earth; velocity 6,829 feet per second. Spacecraft communicator, Bob Parker, has been joined at the CAPCOM console by backup Apollo 17 commander, John Young, and his relief CAPCOM, Gordon Fullerton. Standing by for the antenna arrangement to be sorted out. Spacecraft at this time, is still in the barbeque roll or passive thermal control mode, three revolutions per hour to stabilize the temperatures on spacecraft systems. They'll open up the air-ground circuit for the first call when it does come. At 15 hours and 1 minute, this Apollo Control.</span>

We'll be with you with the postsleep checklist, and primarily it looks like a P-23 day for Ron And what we'd primarily like to do is spend a good part of that time getting the spacecraft cleaned up, reshuffled, restowed a little bit, and get it in order for the next few days ahead. It doesn't look like today's that big of a day.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">Okay. The plan we're considering, and we're offering it to you now for your opinion, is at 65 hours GET, we'll update, and at the time the clock goes to 65, we'll update it 2 hours and 40 minutes to 67:40. And we're shaping your trajectory such that you'll arrive at the Moon at the same time GMT as you would have had you launched on time. In other words, your translunar time is 2 hours and 40 minutes less. So once we do that, we'll be back with all the right times in the Flight Plan without any updating. And the one thing we think of is that your next day will, which is now a 16-hour day, will shorten to a 13-hour and 20-minute day-. But that's about the only real effect we can see. How does that sound?</span>

Jack, while you're there, I might try - we've been talking about consumable updates and what would be the most meaningful way to give you the information. As a trial, for 14 hours, with reference to the charts in the back of the book, which in the case of - in case of all of them, are listed in percentages except the RCS, which is in pounds. On the cryo quantities, when I take all the tank percentages and plot them, it turns out that there's no real significant difference from the lines that are plotted on either hydrogen or oxygen. On RCS, you're running about 3 percent ahead of the line. And if that's a satisfactory way to put it, that's the way we'll give you the - the updates rather than giving you every tank percent by percent. Over.</span>

A little bit of levity a short time ago when Jack Schmitt, Lunar Module Pilot, called down to say: "This is LMP, mark, 2 aspirin." He had mentioned earlier in his post-sleep checklist that he was considering taking two aspirins. Apollo 17 is presently 72,843 nautical miles out from Earth. Velocity 6,477 feet per second. We're continuing to stand by on the air-ground circuit for further conversation as the crew finishes up their meal period and gets what few flight plan updates are involved in the days activity.

And a major system probably associated with that that stretches into the northern western United States.

                <span class="spokenwords">I'll run down a few quick summaries of this morning's news. Former President Harry Truman has rallied slightly, despite his weakened heart and labored breathing. His doctors report that their main worry is whether his heart is strong enough to withstand the strain, the physical strain of 88 years. Despite the slight rally, Truman's condition is still considered critical. In Paris, Henry Kissinger met with Hanoi's Le Du Tho for 4 hours yesterday in planned secret talks. Paris newspapers report an imminent cease-fire, but neither Kissinger or Tho indicate that this is true. After the 4-hour talks, Kissinger shook hands; and his aid - got a little typo error here - but neither representative made any comment concerning their meeting. At Camp David, Maryland, President Nixon's press secretary, Ron L. Ziegler, said that Kissinger and Nixon are in close communication by cable concerning the secret peace talks. But Ziegler declined to provide more information about progress in the talks. President Nixon selected Claude S. Brinegar, a California oil executive and a doctor of economics, to be Secretary of Transportation succeeding John A. Volpe. Volpe will become the U.S. ambassador to italy. Here's one concerning last night's launch. Mrs. Spiro Agnew reportedly made a wish on a falling star just before the delayed launch of Apollo 17. Sitting beside her at the VIP viewing site was Barbara Cernan, who said that she was nervous when the lift-off was postponed. She added, "But Al Bean was there with me. He said not to be concerned." Mrs. Cernan was accompanied by her daughter Tracy, and her mother, Mrs. Jackie Ashley. Mrs. Ron Evans, who saw the launch with her children, Jamie and John, said that she was never worried because everybody knew what they were doing.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">Well, I can give you my feelings, anyway. It was a spectacular sight, and no doubt about it. I'd say the level of illumination would have made it easy to - to read a newspaper or anything like that from my vantage point near the VAB. The - the plume itself actually looked no larger or - or even any brighter, really, except in contrast, than it does on a day launch by comparison. But - well, the effect, I guess, was about what I expected just trying to extrapolate previous launches into a nighttime situation. The weather was very clear. That was one advantage gained by delaying the launch the 2 hours and 40 minutes that you did. By that time, there were very few clouds around at all. And we could see a brilliant flash there when the first stage cut off and the second stage ignited. And I lost you visually probably, oh, 4 to 5 minutes into the second stage, as best I can remember. Part of the problem was the brightness of the plume during the first stage, it kind of burned a spot on my eye; and so then I was - had reduced efficiency at looking for a small point of light from there on out. Stu's here with me and he was watching it, too. I'll see if he has anything to add.</span>

And we'll get a report as soon as a set of coordinates for the S-IVB impact are available. Also, capcom Gordon Fullerton read up a news report to the crew.

Apollo 17 at this point is 81,654 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a speed of 5,972 feet per second. And we see from the telemetry data that the fuel cell purge called for in the flight plan at this time is progressing. This involves flowing, in this case, oxygen at a high rate through the fuel cell for a short period of time to remove any build-up of contaminants. And, as a routine maintenance or housekeeping procedure, same thing is also done periodically for the hydrogen.</span>

The crew aboard Apollo 17 has completed the next item in the flight plan in the way of housekeeping duties aboard the spacecraft. That involved dumping waste water. Water is accumulated in a 7 to 8 gallon tank on the spacecraft which is produced as a by-product of generating electricity in the fuel cells. These fuel cells generate quite a bit more water than the spacecraft is able to consume for cooling and for crew drinking purposes. The excess goes into a waste water tank and periodically it's dumped down to about lO percent, and the crew has just completed that activity. We're going to take advantage of a relatively quiet time in the flight plan at this time to replay a portion of the air-to-ground conservations with the spacecraft which included among other things a rather detailed description of earth given by Jack Schmitt, some weather patterns. This replay is necessitated by a problem that we had with a portion of the public affairs release circuit between 4:40 and 5:05 p.m. central standard time this afternoon in which a portion of the release circuit did not receive the air-to-ground and for the benefit of those people who missed that portion of air-to-ground we'll replay the tapes at this time.</span>

That completes our replay of the segments of the air-to-ground that were lost on a portion of the Public Affairs Release Network earlier today. During that replay, we accumulated about 5 or 6 minutes of additional tape with the crew, the activities involved during that period of time or completion of waste water dump, the crew dumping excess water produced by the fuel cells and stored in a storage tank on the spacecraft, and they dump it down to about 10 percent of its quantity, or its capacity. And, also completed one other routine housekeeping activity. That was cycling the film in the panoramic and mapping cameras contained back in the service module scientific instrument module bay. That bay, of course, still has the door over it. The door will be jettisoned before going into orbit around the moon exposing those cameras for use in lunar orbit taking high-resolution and very accurately controlled mapping cameras - mapping photos of the lunar surface. The cycling of the film is made necessary by the fact that the film is under some tension in the magazine in the transport mechanism. This tension tends to put pressure on the emulsion, and if the film is not advanced, oh, four or five cycles, at least once every 24 hours, it tends to create striations in the emulsion, and this is done during the translunar coast when the cameras are not being used periodically, once a day to prevent these striations from developing in the emulsion of the film. We'll replay that accumulated tape for you and then continue to stand by live.</span>

As you heard based on the telemetry data that we got here on the ground both cameras appear to be functioning properly tucked away in the scientific instrument module bay of the CSM. You also heard some conservation with Jack Schmitt who is wearing the biomedical harness during sleep periods it's customary for one of the three crewman only to wear the biomedical harness which allows them to get heart rate during the sleep period and the crewman take turns wearing that biomedical harness and during the sleep we are getting good biomedical data - good heart rate data on Schmitt at the present time. Also, Ron Evans commented on getting the spacecraft in the PTC attitude. Essentially, this attitude has the spacecraft oriented at right angles to it's direction of travel. Right angles to the Earth Moon plane so that the Sun is essentially shining on the sides of the vehicle of the CSM and LM. And, then using the reaction control system thrusters on the command module they set up a slow roll rate so that the two vehicles docked together are rotating at the rate of about three revolutions per hour. And, if this is done properly and it's a tricky maneuver usually crews get more and more experienced at it as they go through the mission, and tend to have the most problems early on in getting it set up. But if it is set up with all of the rates damped and everything very stable when the roll is started it will maintain this roll without wobbling out of it throughout the rest period. The purpose of this is to maintain a proper thermal equilibrium on the spacecraft so that the heating on one side from the Sun the cooling of the other as it is exposed to the black of space is uniform and nothing gets too hot or too cold. At the present time Apollo 17 is 84,482 nautical miles from Earth and the velocity continuing to decrease gradually down to about 5,824 feet per second, just a little over one mile per second. We'll continue to stand by live now for any conversations with the crew. This could continue to be a relatively quiet period based on Ron Evans or I guess it was Jack Schmitt's comment that Evans was in the kitchen leads us to believe that they are probably getting ready to eat. This is Apollo control at 19 hours 45 minutes.</span>

On the telemetry data that we have here in the Control Center, we're watching as the spacecraft is automatically killing off its rates, in preparation for setting up it's passive thermal control mode. They're getting the vehicles very stable, and they're measuring rate changes in thousandths of a degree per second. And when it is as essentially as stable as it appears possible to get it, they'll then fire the thrusters, to begin rolling at a slow 3 revolutions per hour rate. This is the second passive thermal control mode established.</span>

That front looks like it starts and develops as a small - - it actually seems to start with an anticyclone development off the coast of Antarctica. Moves up across New Zealand, looks like the South island primarily, a little bit of the North island is still visible, and into the eastern coast of Australia. And I'll give you a spot where it intersects and crosses the whole of Australia. However, it - it breaks up and is not very well formed, once it gets inland away from the coast. I see no well-developed waves on it at this time, so it's hard to say how strong it is. There might be one developing just to the south of New Zealand or right off the coast of New Zealand.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">This is Apollo Control at 20 hours 45 minutes. We're occasionally picking up a bit of noise on the Air-to-Ground circuit. This is due to the fact that the spacecraft is in the passive thermal control mode, as it rotates. We're gradually losing contact through one of the OMNI antennas and re-establishing adequate signal strength on another one. And as it moves from antenna to antenna on our coverage, we get the noise. This is a characteristic that becomes more pronounced as the spacecraft gets farther and farther from Earth. Here in Mission Control, the Flight Activities Officer has been actively involved in figuring out how in the flight plan we're going to make up for the 2 hours 40 minutes difference from the flight plan liftoff time and the actual liftoff time. One of two things happen when you lift off late for a mission. Either the events that are called out in the flight plan occur at a different Earth time, Central Standard, Eastern Standard, or Greenwich Mean whichever reference you happen to be using, or the elapsed times change. And the flight planning is all done in terms of elapsed time for the most part. Events that are called out in the flight plan are listed by the amount of time that has elapsed from liftoff. At the present time, in the Apollo 17 flight plan, the amount of time that has elapsed since liftoff is unchanged from the pre-mission flight plan time. However, as, by the time we have approached or reached the Moon, because of the speeded up translunar coast time, occasioned by slightly faster or slightly greater amount of energy that was put in during the translunar injection burn, we'll have to make up 2 hours 40 minutes. In other words, we'll be arriving at the Moon 2 hours 40 minutes earlier than flight plan allowed for. This means that all of the events that are called in the flight plan to occur between now and lunar arrival have to be accomplished in 2 hours 40 minutes less time than the flight plan allows for. This creates no serious problems, because it's a relatively quiet period of the mission. It's very easy, by adjusting sleep period slightly and moving the activities up to accomplish it. However, the flight planning officer, flight activities officer, prefers to accomplish this shift in two increments rather than a single one. And this could be likened to a change of daylight savings time, where you don't want to make the jump too big at once, and you might start interfering in a way that would be noticeable, say, with sleep periods. But by accomplishing it in two segments, the change is relatively insignificant. And what this amounts to is that at two different times in the flight plan, we'll read changes to the crew, and they will go down the flight plan, moving a series of events approximately 1 hour earlier. The second time that this is done, they'll actually be moving events 1 hour 40 minutes earlier and at the same time, we'll update the clocks in Mission Control, the Ground Elapsed Time clocks, which serve as the key to where you are in the flight plan to agree with the changes we have made in the flight plan. And from that point on, the GET clock will be back in synchronization with the flight plan. This clock update is presently scheduled to occur at 66 hours Ground Elapsed Time, rather at 67 hours 40 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, and we'll move the clocks to 66 hours. Apollo 17 at present time is 88,091 nautical miles from EARTH.</span>

And we'd like to have a bit more discussion of the Ground Elapsed Time update after first making the disclaimer that GET clock updates are not done for the purpose of confusing people; although, I'm sure it seems that way at times. And, by way of clarifying the previous description of this GET update we should point out that the amount of time that the clocks are changed both here and mission control and aboard the spacecraft will be 2 hours and 40 minutes and this clock change is scheduled to occur as mentioned previously at about 65 hours Ground Elapsed Time. In other words when the clocks here in the control center and the clocks in the spacecraft keeping track of the time that has elapsed since liftoff reach 65 hours they will be arbitrarily jumped ahead 2 hours and 40 minutes so that at that point the clocks agree with the flight plan. However, in order to account for these 2 hours and 40 minutes which are suddenly going to disappear from the amount of time available to the crew to accomplish their activities to make it easier on the crew it will be done in two increments. The first increment of 1 hour and the second increment of 1 hour 40 minutes. And, at about the time the second increment of change is made in the flight plan we'll also simultaneously update the clocks. Apollo 17 at this time 88,909 nautical miles from Earth and the velocity continuing to decrease gradually down now to 5,603 feet per second. Very little activity is scheduled in the flight plan between now and the time the crew begins it's rest period. This day aboard the spacecraft has been planned as a relatively short one recognizing that the crew would not get a great deal of sleep on that very long - as a result of the very long launch day. And a relatively short sleep period following. This day was intentionally kept short. They're now - should be completing their eat period although they really have nothing showing in the flight plan until about 22 hours or about another hour from now where they have alloted time for exercise. They will be changing the lithium hydroxide canisters that remove carbon dioxide from the spacecraft cabin atmosphere. They will be realigning the spacecraft platform the stable platform that's used as an attitude reference by the guidance navigation and control system. Then they have one more eat period and go through the pre-sleep checklist beginning an 8 hour rest period at about 25 hours Ground Elapsed Time or a little less than 4 hours from now.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">Okay, Bob. The entire boost itself was not unlike what you've heard and what Stu down there understands from the physical cues, and what have you. But the significant part of going at night is that as soon as we did have ignition down there in the bottom of the S-IC stack - even though I only have a little slit out of - out of the rendezvous window here, and Ron doesn't have much of a hole in the boost protective cover out of the hatch window, we could definitely confirm ignition because we could see the reflected light on out through in front of us. It was by no means blinding, of course; we had the cockpit pretty well lit up. We - as soon as we lifted off, that light immediately went behind us. We came into just S-IC staging, and I had an opportunity to say, "I told you so," to Jack and Ron. It was just like the great train wrecks of the past. I definitely could see the S-II ignite; and, then, of course, the - I could see the significance of the reflection through the window, besides all the other cues we had for ignition, very much like the S-IC lit up the windows on the stack. Tower jett was pretty spectacular. I could see - the entire boost protective cover and some flame from somewhere - I'm not sure - maybe it was through the hole in the windows - but I could definitely see it. Of course, it disappeared in short order. When the S-II shut down, the delay time between shutdown there and the S-IVB igniting, the entire - the entire flame overtook us, and we literally through - flew through the S-II flame when the S-IVB ignited, if you can imagine that. It's very similar to the Titan staging, where you actually fly through the fireball on the S-II. And that's something you never see - none of those things you ever see quite that way in daylight. On the S-IV, I could see - Of course, once we got going, I couldn't see any light from that plume again, but we could see the APS firing all the way through the burn. And once we got in orbit, as other guys have seen, you could see the APS firing at night without any difficulty. One of the most significant things about TLI is the fact that we, of course, started at night and flew right on up and through a sunrise, which in itself was a pretty spectacular thing. But, when you do it during a TLI burn, it even adds a little bit of momentum to your effort.</span>

And during parts of the S-II and parts of the S-IVB burn, I even turned the lights down in the cockpit - in hopes that I could see stars out there; but I could not make out a one. Ron, I think, may have saw Saturn out the overhead hatch; but looking through the rendezvous window, during a boost phase and during a time-critical phase like a Mode II or Mode IV, I am very much afraid that we would not have been able to pick up that reference.</span>

The old Saturn V has got to be a pretty consistently performing vehicle. But - with the added night-time contrast, I think it made it probably the best ride any three guys have ever had.</span>

Going through Max q, I got up to 25 percent; but my yaw attitude error was zero and my pitch attitude error probably wasn't even at - oh, certainly less than 2 degrees. After Max q, she smoothed out by comparison quite a bit ; and the S-II was a very quiet ride, a very smooth ride. However, you are always aware, due to just a little rumbling out in the S-IVB, that she was still burning for you. The S-IVB, I think, was just a continually - rumble but smooth or consistent ride, all the way through TLI.</span>

Something I don't ever remember happening, but it's happening now in the windows. That's the 1, 3, and 5, but not 2 and 4, is that in the center of the window about 6 or 8 inches in diameter, as you come through the night side of the rotation, you pick up a very light - oh, you might call it even a frost. Very light frost on the window - more like a - a moisture frost, film of moisture, or film of frost - not very thick like crystals at all. As you come through the sunlight, it tends to sublime away, but never - you never fully lose it until you go back into darkness again. The very artistic definite ice crystals that we had on my number 1 window over here yesterday - I think we reported to you this morning that they were gone or they sublimed away.

Very - it's a very bright point now - oh, it's hard to say how far across. But, quite unlike what I mentioned being in the vicinity of the Samoan islands earlier. And it's right at the shore, and it could be just that the shore area has somewhat choppier seas. So maybe - maybe the brightness of that point is a function of sea state, although I don't know exactly what type of seas it would take to brighten it up. I suspect choppy seas are better than long swells.</span>

As I recall, the weather briefings that we had at the Cape last week, that - talking with Ken Nabor and Jim Nicholson down there, that the patterns we were seeing from the satellite pictures in their forecast - or analysis anyway, charts in the New Zealand part of the Pacific, those waves formed along the front would move north and then curve east. And that appears to be the pattern that was visible in one of the older fronts. And I suspect if that pattern would hold with the wave that's developed off the coast - right on the coast of New Zealand now, that it might move on up the western coast of New Zealand. We'll probably have a chance to watch that the next few days and see what happens to it.</span>

For this period yesterday we were in our hold, and I think it goes without saying; but we'd sure like to pass on our bit of gratitude and thanks for the response that the people down at the Cape came up with. And particularly at Marshall. I think we all knew no one would be going anywhere unless everyone was satisfied that we were going all the way.

Hey, I don't know whether you were around, Gene, the other day when I was talking about the circulation patterns around Antarctica. We were looking then at the Indian Ocean - actually, South Atlantic in the Indian Ocean region. And you see the same pattern at about the same latitude, say 60 degrees south, where all the linear cloud patterns which presumably are - reflect the various cold fronts have - are arcuate with their convex sides, or more actually, almost pointed sides are all lined up in a west-to-east direction around that latitude. It's quite a spectacular appearing circulation pattern. And the little wave that I mentioned on New Zealand seems to be beginning to form another arrow or another convex point on that front that's fitting right into the same circulation pattern.</span>

That storm off the - just off the southwest coast of New Zealand is still intensifying and has both high and low level clouds as you can see by shadow lines. It looks like it may go into pretty - pretty fair storm system. Borneo is very clear today; and, as is the Philippines. And as I mentioned, there's a - looks like a very strong frontal system that stretches from, oh, let's say, the south coast of - or southeast coast of Vietnam up - up between and across Tai - between the Philippines and Taiwan and across Taiwan. And right along, and I can't tell I think, just off - just south of Japan. I can't tell whether Japan is in the front or not. I'll look at it some more. The strongest storm center that I can see on that is - is way north, and probably - Hokkaido is - has a fair amount of weather from that storm system. There seems to be a tropical depression just north of Borneo. A very strong circulation system north of Borneo and, I guess, just south of - of Vietnam.</span>

And, also, that's residual after the frontal passage. And it looks like maybe Shanghai, after all, may have some storms associated with it, but it's really hard to pick out exactly - the exact coast line of Asia, but I - there are some clouds in the Yellow Sea behind the front, Look like they might be possibly some high cirrus is all.</span>

The more I look at it the less well developed it appears to me compared to some of the other circulation patterns. It could be just a residual depression from Teresa that has moved out into that area. It is an isolated, a relatively isolated cloud pattern, fairly small, but apparently fairly dense. But has - does not have a strong cyclonic pattern to it. Nothing at all like the pattern that now exists above Borneo and seems to be moving towards Luzon.</span>

The spacecraft guidance and control system uses it as a reference in determining its own attitude. They've also been charging the two entry batteries that are used during peak electrical loads of liftoff, and then are recharged during the translunar coast when the fuel cells are producing a surplus of electrical energy. They've recharged one of those two batteries and are in the process of recharging the second one at this time. And you heard the crew describe going into their pre-sleep checklist and getting things aboard the spacecraft configured for the sleep period, which is scheduled to begin at 25 hours Ground Elapsed Time or a little more than 1-1/2 hours from now. Apollo 17 at this time is 96,244 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at 5,264 feet per second. And all spacecraft systems continue to function almost perfectly as planned. A little while ago the lunar module officer - control officer - confirmed from telemetry what Gene Cernan was reporting visually out the window and that is that the lunar module appears to be in very good shape. Of course we have a limited number of telemetry readings on the LM at this point. But one of them that we do have gives us an indication of the integrity or tightness of the LM cabins. We can see that in the amount of pressure decaying. It appears to be a very tight vehicle.</span>

But the clouds do not look very dense or concentrated in any one area. And at leading off to the southeast from that general cloud mass, there're cyclonic - anticyclonic cloud mass is a - is one of the old fronts - or at least one of the old linear cloud patterns that extends down into the South Pacific.</span>

And a not too strongly developed circulation system, so I can't predict the winds. But I wouldn't expect them to be anything - anything what might be down - associated with the remnants of the tropical depression Theresa. Now that Theresa - what's left of it, if I'm correct in - in picking it out there, probably is - is moving in that direction, although it looks weak enough that, right now I don't think it would be any big problem.

And it's looking right at the coastline now and see no bright spot in the center. Also, that circulation pattern or tropical depression possibly that I saw earlier north of Borneo is now even more strongly developed at the tail end of the front that stretches up toward Japan. And it - it really looks like a humdinger from here. Beautiful circulation pattern and very concentrated. And it is now east of Vietnam, and again between Vietnam and - and the island of Luzon.</span>

It's purely a novice talking about something he is very unfamiliar with, except for having a longstanding interest in it. And I think the one philosophical point, if any, that comes out of it is that somebody, probably 3-1/2 billion years ago or so, could have looked at the Earth and described patterns not too dissimilar. And it was within those patterns that life developed, and now you see, I think, and obvious to everybody, what that life has progressed to doing. And I certainly think all of us feel that it has not stopped doing that progression, and we'll probably see it do things that even you and I can't imagine them doing I certainly hope so.</span>

Unfortunately, that's not the case. But he certainly couldn't look at that fragile blue globe and not think about the ancient sails of life that are crossing its paths and wonder ahead to the - up to the present, to the modern sails of life that are represented by men that developed out of that life that are sitting there next to you and that are the country in all sorts of different guises and working towards the same end, and that is to put that life farther into the universe. I certainly hope that someday, in the not-too-distant future, the guy can fly who can express these things.</span>

Flight Director, Pete Frank, and his orange team of flight controllers will hand over Mission Control duties to Jerry Griffin's gold team of flight controllers in about 15 minutes at 7 A.M. Central Standard Time. Each of the departing controllers is now briefing his relief. There will be no change of shift news conference. The orange team will double back after 1 shift, returning to the Control Center at 5 P.M. today to get back on a schedule which will put them on the EVA shift. To summarize the shift now ending, the crew began rest period at 25 hours elapsed time. Each crewman took a sleeping pill, and Jack Schmitt reported that Gene Cernan and Ron Evans were asleep shortly after the crew configured the spacecraft for their rest period. However, Jack Schmitt, who was the duty man to wear the head set and the bio-medical harness during this rest period, seemed almost reluctant to surrender his view of the earth to sleep. At 100,000 nautical miles from the Earth he broadcast a weather forecast, then indulged in a bit of philosophy as he gazed from his window, about mankind's achievements. He remarked that from his vantage point the Earth probably looks the same now as it did at the dawn of man. Apollo 17 reached the halfway point to the Moon at an elapsed time of 30 hours 3 minutes. At that time it was 114,787 nautical miles from both the Earth and the Moon. Spacecraft's systems are continuing to perform well and the CAPCOM, astronaut Bob Parker, plans to awaken the crew at 33 hours elapsed time, that's 1 hour 44 minutes from now. Midcourse correction number 2 will be performed at an elapsed time of 35 hours 30 minutes, 4 hours and 14 minutes from now. Present indications are that it will be a 10 and 1/2 foot per second burn. The latest prediction on the S-IVB is that it will impact the Moon at an elapsed time of 86 hours 58 minutes 23 seconds. Coordinates of the impact location presently predicted 6.73 degrees south, 9.7 degrees west. The impact time and the coordinates are likely to change prior to the impact itself, and continued tracking of the S-IVB will be performed. At 31 hours 16 minutes, this is Mission Control, Houston.</span>

The Mission of Apollo 17, which at this moment is 120,887 nautical miles out from Earth, velocity has continued to decrease to 4,305 feet per second. Slightly over a half hour remaining until spacecraft communicator Robert Parker gives the crew a wakeup call. And a relatively busy day ahead with midcourse correction - midcourse correction maneuver #2 at 35:30 Ground Elapsed Time, a 10-1/2-foot per second posigrade maneuver which will raise the trajectory slightly from an impact trajectory with a minus pericynthion at the Moon, raise it to about 60 nautical miles above the surface. Latest numbers on the S-IVB impact predictions is for impact to take place at a Ground Elapsed Time of 86:58:23 at 6.7 degrees south latitude by 9.7 degrees west longitude. The gold team of flight controllers have settled in for a 10-hour day here in Mission Control, which in addition to the midcourse correction burn, includes the first manning of the Lunar Module, first checkout, which begins at about 40 hours. They start actually, at 39:30 getting the probe and drogue removed from the tunnel, going into the Lunar Module. We'll come back up live with the air-ground when the first call is made to the crew by the spacecraft communicator. And at 32:29, this is Apollo Control.</span>

Apollo 17 is now 122,186 nautical miles out from the Earth, velocity now 4,259 feet per second.

It looks like there are probably two fairly weak cyclones - Southern Hemisphere cyclones in the South Atlantic. One, southwest of Cape of Good Hope, and the other about due west of - of the Falkland islands, maybe a little bit north of that.

Apollo 17 spacecraft, should at this time be coming out of the passive thermal-control mode and getting into the proper attitude for the midcourse correction burn #2, which is some 31 minutes and 23 seconds from now. Apollo 17, presently 126,988 miles from the Earth traveling at velocity of 4,098 feet per second. The midcourse correction burn #2 with an ignition time 35:29:59.1 has a velocity change in the posigrade direction of 10.6 feet per second, which for the service propulsion system engine is a BURP lasting 1.58 seconds. Purpose of this burn is to raise the pericynthion from an impact trajectory as it stands now, to one with a clearance over the Moon of some 53 nautical miles which will become the pericynthion of Lunar Orbit. Standing by on air-ground 1 at 34:59 this is Apollo Control.</span>
