                <span class="spokenwords">This is Apollo Control at 16 minutes 45 seconds after liftoff. We've confirmed Apollo 17 is in a near nominal orbit. The crew reported an orbit of about 93.5 by 89.5 based on their onboard calculations, and computations on the ground show that we're very close to the nominal 90 mile - nautical mile orbit. As a result of the late liftoff, the trans-lunar injection will be a little bit earlier than the flight plan Ground Elapsed Time but we don't have an update on this time yet. We expect that it will be on the order of 8 to 10 minutes early. We'll update that time as we get a later update.</span>

                <span class="afjwho">PAO</span>
                <span class="spokenwords">We would expect that the time of arrival at the Moon will be approximately the same as the flightplan time in terms of Greenwich Mean Time. The Ground Elapsed Time will be somewhat earlier, and we expect that there will be clock update - a so called clock update - at some point where we make the clocks in Mission Control and aboard the spacecraft agree with the Ground Elapsed Time that they would be showing in the flight plan. The net effect will be that we'll arrive at the Moon in a shorter Ground Elapsed Time - in effect about 2 hours 40 minutes earlier than the flight plan would show, but at the same Greenwich mean time or local time here on Earth, that - that we would have had had we lifted off on time. We're in effect making up the time by speeding up the arrival at the Moon. The spacecraft at translunar injection will be going somewhat faster than a nominal liftoff translunar injection. Consequently, it will arrive at the Moon going slightly faster, and also somewhat earlier, about 2 hours 40 minutes earlier in terms of Ground Elapsed Time. This will also mean that the lunar orbit insertion will require a bit more energy to slow the spacecraft down and get it into lunar orbit. These details of course, will all be worked out in the time that we have before our lunar orbit insertion. And, when we get an updated translunar injection time, we'll pass that along.</span>

Apollo 17 now in an orbit about 90 miles by 93 miles, and everything appears to be nominal aboard the spacecraft and aboard the launch vehicle, Saturn third stage. One additional impact of our late liftoff will be the loss of television coverage for the transposition and docking maneuver. The television coverage will not be possible because the ground track has shifted and we don't have the site coverage that had been expected for television. The translunar injection burn, reigniting the Saturn third stage to put the spacecraft on its trajectory to the Moon, is now scheduled to occur at a Ground Elapsed Time of 3 hours 12 minutes 35 seconds, or roughly 9 minutes earlier than the flight plan time. This again the effect of the late liftoff.</span>

And from the President of the United States we have the following message to the crew of Apollo 17. The message reads: "As you set forth on the final Apollo expedition to the Moon, I want to have my personal best wishes for a successful mission and safe return. I am sure your voyage, your scientific exploration, will be the crowning achievement in a program which has expanded Man's horizons, brought great credit to your country and lifted the spirits of people all over the world. Godspeed to you all." Signed Richard Nixon. The flight Dynamics officer, continuing to process tracking data, following orbital insertions, reports that there is a small amount of out of plane error showing up in the orbit. This it is believed is due to a small error in the instrument unit of the Saturn third stage. However, the orbit is very close to nominal, about 90 nautical miles by 93 nautical miles. And we look very good, both with respect to the spacecraft and with respect to the Saturn third stage which must perform that burn, putting Apollo 17 on its trajectory toward the Moon. At 34 minutes, this is Apollo Control Houston.</span>

One of the things the booster engineer will be looking for when we reacquire and get good lock on the data will be the Saturn 3rd stage instrument unit. Looking at one brief bit of data before we lost signal, it appears that one of the four batteries in the instrument unit had a very high current drain on it. We will be looking closely at that to see if it was simply a telemetry problem or if, in fact, that battery does have some problem. And we should be about 15 seconds now from reacquiring.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">This is Apollo Control. 1 hour 25 minutes after lift off. During the postlaunch press conference at Cape Kennedy, we had a short aquisition with the crew through the Hawaiian tracking station. During that period of conversation, and during that period of monitoring the systems on the spacecraft and the launch vehicle, we found that the situation was essentially unchanged. That is, both vehicles now looking good; the spacecraft and the launch vehicle. And we're progressing toward a normal translunar injection. 1 hour 46 minutes 50 seconds from now. The crew has discussed one unexplained series of events. It appears that when certain switches are cycled or moved on panel 2 which is the main panel in front of them, the center panel of the spacecraft, they're getting a master caution and warning signal. A light comes on - a tone comes on. This is to attract the crews attention that something may be wrong and the normal procedure is then to look at another matrix of lights which would zero them in on the problem. The light - the system or the subsystem or particular area being monitered, or which had the problem would light an individual light. However, when they go to this other matrix of lights, they find that none of them are lighted. This is leading the crew and the flight controllers here in mission control to believe that they are getting an spurious signal to the master caution and warning, when in fact nothing is wrong. We don't have any further explanation for the problem at this point. We will continue to look at the data and particularly during the translunar coast, we think we'll get a good long time to look at things in detail and try to find out precisely what is happening. At this point however, the problem presents no concern and one of the more likely explanations, or possible explanations that's been advanced is perhaps some contamination in some switches. We did accumulate some taped conversation during the press conference with the crew. We will replay that for you now and then stand by for acquisition of signal over the United States.</span>

And, as you heard CAPCOM Robert Overmyer advising the crew, we've been getting a good look at all the data, and spacecraft, launch vehicles, look fine. No discernable problems. Gene Cernan did mention one anomaly and that was the mission timer. One of the - one of the numerous clocks aboard the spacecraft which was running about 15 minutes [sic] slow - and Cernan said it appeared that it happened either during the launch phase or shortly before they got down to take a look at it in the lower equipment bay. No explanation for that one at this point. And we show now 1 minute - 1 hour, rather - 11 minutes until ignition for the translunar injection maneuver, the burn with the Saturn 3rd stage which will place Apollo 17 on its trajectory toward the Moon. Ignition time and still holding at about 3 hours 12 minutes 35 seconds Ground Elapsed Time, and that burn will be about 5 minutes 45 seconds in duration, but we don't have the final calculated time from the flight dynamics officer which will undoubtedly vary somewhat from the premission Flight Plan time.

And during that passover at Carnarvon, and we've passed up the numbers to the crew they'll use in the Translunar Injection maneuver. The burn is targeted to last 5 minutes 51 seconds with a change in velocity of some 10,359 feet per second. Accelerating Apollo 17 to the required speed to get it into an orbit that will intercept the Moon. And the time of ignition, 300 - 03:12:35 and we're showing an ejection time of 04:39. The transposition and docking maneuver which preceeds ejection, is somewhat fluid in that it's done when the crew and mission control are ready, following Translunar Injection. However, from the projected time for ejection, it would appear that transposition and docking will occur about 25 to 30 minutes ahead of the nominal Flight Plan time. And we're now 39 minutes away from the scheduled ignition for translunar injection. At 2 hours 34 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.</span>

Flight Director, Gene Kranz, going over the status for these flight controllers observed that there appeared to be no problems that would interfere with TLI and we expect to have a normal translunar injection, about 23 minutes from now as Apollo 17 completes its state-side pass and moves out over the Atlantic Ocean at the start of its third revolution.</span>
