During the CF squared we asked about that bundle of wires that has contact with the gimbal - and when I deployed it, that bundle was - it still had contact with the gimbal and everybody at the CF squared said that was okay. But, you might think about it. I don't know what I could do to help if that is the problem. But that might be causing the problem here that it wouldn't cause on Earth.</span>

No, I don't think there is anything here that really needs to be written down. I'll go through with you first, and we can talk about details and writing in, if you want to on any of them. But, I don't think there is anything that really needs to be written in. The EVA - it is going to be essentially nominal, with two minor exceptions. One is the - we've allowed about 5 minutes extra at the LM before leaving for the Rover fender fix; and, John, we'll be talking to you about that in a minute. And the second big change, is that we're also extend - allowing 5 more minutes at the end of the EVA so that we can have extra time for dusting. And I suspect that if the Rover fender fix works and we aren't getting as dirty as we did last night, then we may gain back that 5 minutes. We're also allowed - well, what we've done is we've taken the time here out of some of the tasks at Station 3 and Station 4. And along with the fact that we think you're a little bit farther east than planned - and we're allowing 4 minutes additional driving time. But again, that's all real-time, and. if we're doing well on time, we can reinstitute all those tasks, and get rid of the 5 minutes that we are allowing here, there, or elsewhere. So that's just sort of to keep in your thinking.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">The variations that we found on the surface of the South Massif indicating a possibility of layering - I guess you saw those mostly with the monocular - and the observation of boulder tracks and the size of the Massif emphasizes the importance of sampling boulders that can be traced to sources at various elevations of the Massif. And I guess we should say that's hopefully. And we'll just have to see what happens when we get down to Station 2 on that. But, if we see boulders with tracks, I'm sure you guys remember, that they obviously will have a higher priority. Since we didn't get to Emory, and since we didn't really get to the rim of Steno itself, the question of sampling of the actual subfloor is still somewhat ambiguous although there is a large consensus opinion that says that we sampled the subfloor when we sampled that intermediate Gabbro that we sampled yesterday at both the ALSEP and Station 1. The - here is a possible alternative conclusion which says that the subfloor has not been sampled, but that these blocks that we sampled and the surface are both parts of a later flow. And, in that line, we're still looking for specific observations which will help us distinguish between whether or not the dark mantle is a - whether the dark mantle is a separate unit from the intermediate gabbro that we're seeing or, whether it's the - Stand by.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">- All this says that, we're very much more interested in Station 5, as you might expect, than we were before. And I guess, for this reason, we'll be trying to keep the timeline a little tighter than usual to guarantee that we've got some time left over at Station 5. And, we're also interested in moving perhaps - in perhaps moving Station 5 from its present location there in the southwest of Camelot over to the southeast or east or some location where we have a feeling that we've got big boulders up on the rim. This would be so we could sample, hopefully, some of the light material and some of the boulders together and get a better confirmation that the materials from deep in the subfloor unit is this intermediate gabbro, as opposed to just material from the upper part of the subfloor. It's just a matter of proving to ourselves whether or not the boulders we sampled yesterday are from deep within the subfloor, or only at the surface of the subfloor; or, perhaps, as I said, the other alternative being that the intermediate gabbro is part of the dark mantle, and we're seeing a churned-up regolith on top of it - sort of being the gaseous upper part of the flow having been broken down rather rapidly into the dark mantle. Okay, stand by a minute.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">Okay. To summarize that again, reading - I guess I got ahead of myself here in the little deal they wrote up. At the present time we have two working hypotheses for the dark mantle, the gabbro - and the gabbro relationships to each other. One: the crystalline rocks that we found in the gabbro are an upper unit of the subfloor with their dark mantle cover unrelated to them in time. Key observations that they suggest here, are stratigraphy at Camelot, Station 5, and other steep craters. Especially, perhaps, the trench and sheltered spots which are unguarded - ungardened, as in plowed - for an older regolith underneath the dark mantle, if such a thing could be found. We don't think we found that yesterday. Or, look at the superposition relations between dark mantles and boulders or, the mantles - instances of the mantle on the boulders or, inversely, of small boulders on the mantle.</span>

                <span class="afjwho">CC</span>
                <span class="spokenwords">The second working hypothesis is that - is that the dark mantle is regolith derived from a vitreous, vesicular, flow tops of the crystalline rock flow beneath. And, it again goes to say that perhaps the re - gabbro that we sampled yesterday was indeed the late flow; and what the regolith was, was derived from the vitreous, vesicular flow tops as it were. Again, many of the same observations are called for. In particular, they'd be interested then in looking at the coarser fines as they define as from a millimeter to 20 millimeters, for some sort of transitional lithologies and textures. In other words, what do the small walnut-size rocks look like, if you can in hand specimens? If I can get more specific in terms of EVA mechanics, let me say that we'll call out in real-time the deletion of the tasks at Stations 3 and 4, if they become necessary. And what we're planning on doing is, deleting the trench in the base of the scarp at Station 3, and also, deleting the radial sample of the - on Shorty at Station 4. That's provisionally what we're planning on. And depending on how the time is going, we'll call that out real-time. We also have - The experiments remain pretty much the same: We'll deploy the charges at the same locations as we're planning in the checklist at the present time. We also don't - for your planning further ahead, we don't anticipate any significant changes in EVA-3. The charge number 5, which we were going to deploy at Emory, will not - but didn't, will not be deployed during EVA-2, but we'll deploy it on EVA-3 out at Station 10. And, what we're going to do there, is when you take the 8-pounder and put it between the seats, we'll then have the 3-pounder left over, and we'd like to put that on one of the footpads in the Sun - that's probably either the minus-Z or minus-Y footpad. And, we'll leave it there in the Sun until the start of EVA-3, in which case we'll put in the Rover underneath the LMP's seat. And, thermally, that looks okay. There is a probability that we're going to play the "return to the ALSEP" game, and we're going to do this for a couple of reasons. One, we're going to go back and look at getting some more ALSEP photos. I guess Gordy says you've got that. And, that will probably be at the end of EVA - in fact, it will certainly be, if it happens, at the end of EVA-3 when you go back to get the neutron flux probe. I might also say with regard to EVA-3 that, obviously, we're more interested in Station 10 than we were before. Another "return to the ALSEP" goodie that we're looking at - if we have the consumables today when you get back from finishing Station 5 - is that the Lunar Surface Gravimeter has been unable to level itself over the night, and they sent, you know, some thousand commands trying to get it straightened out, and they say it looks as though it's not level. And, so, we'd like Jack to go back with his practiced hand-on-bubble levels and recheck that at the end of - after Station 5 today, if there's sufficient consumables. And, we've planned for Gene to just let Jack off and let him walk back to the LM, after he gets off and looks at that. And, that's about everything we have. As I say, in summary, that the big changes are going to be extra time at the beginning, taking care of the fender extension, and the probability of extra time at the end. Although we'll have to see how well the fender works and how things go. The probability of extra time at the end to allow for dusting and the time spent on those particular activities we'll probably end up taken out of the tasks at Station 3 and Station 4. Over.

An initial reaction down here is that the battery temps were high on deployment because of particularly unfavorable heat soaking on the way out. And the Marshall people are hopeful that they'll be back to normal this morning. However, we're obviously anxious, as I'm sure you are, to get an early reading on the battery temps - that's number 1. And number 2, just for the off chance that the meter's not working, I think we've pretty much discount that, because of the way the meter worked yesterday. But, on the off chance that the meter's not working, you might just lean over and see if the meter is reading zero before you punch in the circuit breakers, because that would give us at least a partial confirmation in that direction, that there's not something wrong with the offset. If they're reading - sitting there reading 30 to 40 degrees, then that probably says something about the offset. And, beyond that - -</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">Bob, I think, based on what I saw yesterday, that the chances are pretty good that all the big blocks out here in the dark mantle area will be pretty much the gabbros. By the way, I looked at that with a hand lens last night, and I don't know that you got the report, and I'm back to saying that it's probably closer to 30 - 40 percent plagioclase. It's very - it's a good gabbro, a final pyroxene gabbro, and it apparently has a fair amount of ilmenite in it. There's some bright shiny flakes within the vugs and some dark minerals in the matrix that are probably ilmenite. And one other additional possibility then, is that the mantling we're seeing here, is the - is just dark fine glass - darker than usual, because of the iron and the titanium in the rock itself. Also, the probability, I think, still has to be considered, that you're dealing with a true mantle that has been gardened enough that at least where we're seeing it now, in the first few tenths of a centimeter that it is unrecognizable as a mantling unit yet. The relationship to the large boulders is, I think, one right now, of just filleting and a small amount of covering because of the local gardening process. We haven't seen any clearly mantling relationships between the dark mantle or the surface materials here and the large boulders.</span>

And then repeat with two other maps, and then tape both the two maps - now four maps - tape them together, and you'll end up with a sheet that's about 15 inches by 19 inches, a sheet of chronopaque. And then tape both sides of it - the overlapping edges to strengthen it. And you can further strengthen it, if you tape an "X" of tape across both sides of it. And then, on the roll up, on the long axis, and secure it with a strip of tape and put it in the ETB. And on that strip of tape you secure it with - be sure and leave a tab on the end of it so you can get it off with your gloves. And then remove clamps from both the utility light units, and open the clamp jaws to max. And then tighten the mounting bracket that you've got on it so it won't be swinging around; and stow the clamps in the ETB, You got that, Gene?</span>

And then when you get the ETB in the seat, you unroll the chronopaque sheet and you locate the front edge with the long axis fore and aft, even with - even with the axle. And you lay the edge of the sheet over the inboard guide rail and you clamp it. And you lay the other edge of the sheet over the outboard guide rail and clamp it. And, as I said, the inboard clamp must be directly over the axle to avoid interference while steering. And tighten the clamps securely, both of them. And then while you're driving around out there by yourself, it would be good if Jack could take a look at it and see if you're getting any unusual dynamics. And at Station 2, you should inspect the fender for any unusual wear that might have been caused by this mass out there on the fender, of those clamps bouncing up and down. One thing about it, doing it in a suit, Gene, you have to push in with your leg and hold - and it's sort of a two-handed job. And I'm not sure in 1/6 g if you can position the fender, the pseudofender, on there without Jack, say, holding on to the long end behind the Rover so that won't - won't fall off. It works okay in one g for one man. But I'm not sure it's not a 2-g proposition - a two-man proposition in 1/6. Over.</span>
