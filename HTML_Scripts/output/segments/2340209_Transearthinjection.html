Coming up in 2 hours and 16 minutes on the transearth injection burn behind the Moon during - at the end of revolution number 75. To repeat the ignition time currently is Ground Elapsed Time of 236:42:08. A burn of 3046.9 feet per second to boost the spacecraft out of lunar orbit and on a trajectory toward Earth. A splashdown in the South Pacific Tuesday afternoon. The spaceflight meteorology group of the national weather service said this afternoon that weather conditions are expected to be satisfactory for the landing and recovery of Apollo 17 next Tuesday. A weather forecast for the planned landing area which is located about 350 miles southeast of American Samoa calls for scattered to broken clouds, winds of 10 knots, three foot seas and temperatures near 81 degrees. Members of the white team of flight controllers are beginning to drift in for the hand over just prior to acquisition of signal next revolution. We're estimating a change of shift press conference at approximately 4 p.m. in the small briefing room with the off-going flight director Neil Hutchinson. To repeat, estimated change of shift press conference at 4 o'clock, small briefing room, Houston News Center. At 234:26 this is Apollo control.</span>

And, when once again we hear from the crew, they should be in the midst of eating their last meal in lunar orbit. Everything is in very good shape for the trans-Earth insertion maneuver to be performed at the end of this revolution, and at the beginning of the 76th revolution as they come around the front side of the Moon, they'll be on their way back to Earth. During this front-side pass, we'll be passing up to the crew the final set of numbers that'll be fed into their computer, targeting the trans-Earth injection burn. Also, we have the times for acquisition of signal following TEI. With the normal TEI burn, we would expect to acquire signal at 236 hours 55 minutes. If for some reason, the burn is not performed as planned, we would regain radio contact at 239 hours 7 minutes 18 seconds. And, we should have AOS momentarily.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">This is Apollo control. We've now had loss of signal. Apollo 17 completing it's last full revolution of the Moon. Flight Director, Chuck Lewis, has just advised his flight controllers this would be a good time to take a 10 or 15 minute break and then be back on the consoles ready for acquisition of signal at which time Apollo 17 should be on its way back to Earth. The final set of numbers passed up to the crew to perform the transearth injection burn are very close to those that we had earlier. A couple of very minor changes. The ignition time is 236 hours 42 minutes 8 seconds. That represents a change of one second. The total burn duration remains unchanged essentially at 2 minutes 25 seconds. And this will impart an increase in velocity to the spacecraft of 3046 feet per second and that represents a decrease of 1 foot per second over the numbers we had previously. Splashdown is targeted for a Ground Elapsed Time of 304 hours 31 minutes 25 seconds in the Pacific southeast of Samoa. The targeted splashdown coordinates are 17 degrees 54 minutes south and 166 degrees west. The television picture as Apollo 17 comes around into acquisition of signal. We regain radio contact should be a very spectacular view of the lunar surface, The spacecraft at the time we acquire should be at an altitude of about 291 miles above the lunar surface moving out at more than 55 hundred miles per hour and it will be almost directly over the crater Tsiolkovsky which is on the lunar farside normally not visible from Earth. This will be the second time that we've had a chance to view the lunar far side via television from an Apollo mission. The first time occurred on Apollo 10. We were discussing that mission with the Commander of Apollo 10 General Tom Stafford, who's here in the Control Center. Stafford also recalled it being a very spectacular view, as all lunar crews have reported. One thing he did point out is that Apollo 10 had significantly more velocity at transearth injection than Apollo 17 will have. Had a shorter trip time of something like 40 hours for the return compared with about 68 hours for the return time on Apollo 17. This would perhaps cause the Moon to shrink a little less rapidly than we recall it from Apollo 10, but nevertheless, should be a very spectacular sight. The previous crews have described it, the Moon is looking as if you were in a high performance jet aircraft going straight up and the Moon goes from filling the TV screen to shrinking into a discernable sphere in a relatively short period of time, a matter of 10 to 15 minutes as we recall. Again, the acquisition of signal time, the time at which we should have radio contact with Apollo 17, given a normal TEI burn is 236 hours 55 minutes. We have a clock in the Control Center, counting down to that acquisition time. We're now 28 minutes 14 seconds from acquisition. If, for some reason, the transearth injection burn was not performed, we would acquire about 12 minutes later at 237 hours 7 minutes 18 seconds. This is due to the fact that without the burn the spacecraft remains in a lower orbit, does not clear the lunar horizon and become visible to antennas on Earth as soon. Everything has continued to progress very smoothly leading up to transearth injection. On the last front side pass, we fed up the final numbers to the crew. They made the final checks of their guidance and navigation equipment, and as they went around the corner of the Moon everything was looking absolutely normal. We did have one minor unexplained situation occur at the start of the revolution. Gene Cernan reported that he tried for 4 or 5 minutes to establish radio contact and apparently not getting through. The instrumentations communications officer here in the Control Center checked with the various tracking sites, both the prime and backup sites, and they all confirmed that they had rot heard downlink from the spacecraft, although we did have, that is, voice downlink, we did have good telemetry lock on and good solid signal strength. The indications that we had, both on the ground and from the spacecraft were that everything was in the normal configuration and we simply have no explanation for that 4 or 5 minutes when the crew was unable to contact us. But the communications equipment has continued to work absolutely normally. No sign of any problem and no concern. This burn of course is performed while the spacecraft is behind the Moon, so we have no data on the maneuver. We'll get our first report, of it as the crew comes back around on the lunar front side. Comparing this transearth injection maneuver burn with previous burns, it's interesting to observe the Flight Controllers. They're certainly all aware that this is a significant event, leaving the Moon for the final time in the Apollo Program, but the atmosphere here in the Control Center is not much different from previous transearth injection burns that we've observed. Having watched the spacecraft and crew perform this same maneuver flawlessly seven times previously, there's obviously less of the tension that was evident at this time after Apollo 8, when Apollo 8 was preparing to leave the Moon four years ago. We have a number of small clusters of people gathered around in casual conversation and in about 5 or 10 minutes, I'm sure we'll see everybody returning to consoles, getting set to receive that first data from the spacecraft. We're now 12 minutes away from the time at which the crew will be igniting their 20,500 pound thrust service propulsion system engine for 2 minutes and 25 seconds of what's been described as a rather stiff kick in the tail for the spacecraft that starts it on it's path back to Earth. And we're now about 25 minutes from reacquiring radio contact with Apollo 17. At 236 hours 31 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.</span>

And, at that time, we should get confirmation from the crew that America is enroute back to Earth. We have another clock counting, here in the Control Center, for the acquisition time that we can expect, if the Trans Earth Injection burn was not performed, and that now shows 14 minutes 42 seconds until acquisition of signal. That again is the time that we would acquire if the Trans Earth Injection burn was not done as planned. We have an interesting display at the present time, which is called up by our Flight Dynamics Officer, and this display shows what the computers here in the Control Center predict that the current velocity of the spacecraft and its altitude are, based on the assumption that the burn was performed as planned. And, if that assumption is correct, Apollo 17 at this time, is traveling at some 7800 feet per second and is at an altitude of about 237 miles above the Moon and climbing rapidly. And, we're now less than 1 1/2 minutes away from acquisition of signal.</span>

Let me orient you, as soon as we're focused here. Okay - Smythii - I'll point right at the center of Mare Smythii, and then move up towards Neper and then into the swirl area a little bit more north. And Gene will zoom you in and let you see what some of that looks like. I don't think we have a full answer at what the swirls are, but some of the things that we saw in Taurus-Littrow and later from orbit around Sulpicius Gallus may suggest to people, from now on, that the possibility of alteration from fluids in the interior of the Moon is more than just a possibility.</span>

Not an awful lot has happened to the Moon since - except for the impact craters, some of the younger ones, since 3 billion years ago, which is one of the reasons it becomes so interesting to man. It's - the Moon's frozen in a period of history 3 billion years and older, which is a period of history that we cannot recognize very readily on Earth because of the dynamic processes of mountain building and oceans and weathering that are taking place even at the present time. Understanding that early history of the Moon may mean an understanding of the early history of the Earth. And, I think we're well on our way to a first-order understanding of that history as a result of the Program. Okay, going to take you a little bit farther along. Again, to Proclus, which is the obvious partially rayed crater with a big excluded aone to the southwest. There's Mare Fecunditatis and its contact area with the Sea of Serenity, Mare Serenitatis; and the landing site now has to be just about on the horizon.

I know we in the program believe that it's really and truly been a heritage that will prove itself to be one of the - most beneficial things that have happened to mankind in quite some time, although none of us can really predict the future. But I think everyone that has been part of this program has been proud of its accomplishments. I know we have. We're looking back at someplace, I think, we will use as a stepping stone to go beyond some day. And those aren't words. It's a faith I truly and dearly have. And I think we will all see it in our lifetime, not just as a nation, but as a world. I think the Apollo Program not only has given us the first steps to that sort of impossible dream, but has given us an opportunity to make the first steps in bringing a world together as one unit, so that we can make that step together. It's been a privilege sharing the program - that part of it that we've been in with as many people as we have and as many people as we can, because I've often thought and I've often said before that anything that's worthwhile doing and doing well, is certainly worthwhile sharing with others. This is history being made in our time, while you and I are alive, not 100 years ago or 1000 years ago, and it's sort of the real thing happening right now. You're living it, not just us. We hope that you're getting as much out of it, not just feeling of pleasure and excitement, but that of accomplishment, as we are.</span>

But just north of the - the overlap, between Tranquility and Serenitatis, that contact changes sharply to a - the grays are gone - it's a very sharp contrast and I think those who have seen it before will remember it, but Serenitatis from -where we stand is - much more tan dominated, than gray dominated.</span>

Also, they have the scientific instrument module bay in the Service Module of the spacecraft pointed toward Earth, with the ultraviolet and infrared spectrometers gathering their first data on Earth from lunar distance. The crew is scheduled to begin it's sleep period about 3 hours from now, at 242 hours 20 minutes Ground Elapse Time.

It would take a lot of minutes to get much of a stereo base since you're 10,000 miles out. But, remembering back to Ron's final picture there before you went to the UV attitude, after he asked the question about how high he had to be to fill up the 80-millimeter lens, I think he took one at that time. We're thinking of combining a picture now with that picture, and then enlarging the one to get it to the equivalent diameter. And, some rough calculations of your longitude at that time and then - now, show that you've changed about 21 degrees across the surface of the Moon between that picture and the present time, which comes out, if you take the average altitude between that time and now, to - to about a 25-to-l stereo base, as best I can figure.</span>

The nominal time for the charge to go off is 240 hours 52 minutes. And it's been our experience with the previous three charges that their tending to go with in about five minutes either side of that targeted time. So, we would expect to see my seismic activity in the next oh 5 to 7 minutes. And as we mentioned previously, the television camera on the Lunar Rover is not available to us. Instrumentation and communications engineer at the previous detination attempted to bring up the camera, sent a number of commands and the lunar communications relay unit which transmits the television signal to Earth did not respond to the commands. We never got a picture from the camera and we're assuming that the communications relay unit and camera system on the lunar rover are out of operation.

Evans had reported a few minutes ago that it had been a slight bit of gas. He requested permission to take a Lomotil, which is one of the pills in the medical kit, which slows down intestinal activity. The Surgeon recommended for gas that a gas pill be taken. Lomotil will not be taken for a problem that has not developed, but if Ron would like to discuss the situation further we would set up a private conversation and a private conversation has been requested and will be taking place shortly.</span>

The flight surgeon, Dr. Zeiglschmidt had recommended that a gas pill be taken instead, and we told Evans that if he wished to discuss the situation in more detail, we would set up a private conversation. Evans requested a private conversation and that has been in progress since shortly after 241:22.

Wakeup time at 250 hours 30 minutes or about 7:20 AM Central Standard Time tomorrow.

The change of shift news conference will be begin in approximately 10 minutes in the MSC News Center Briefing Room. Participants will be the Flight Director from the previous shift, Charles Lewis, and the Flight Surgeon, Dr. John Zieglschmid. There was a private conversation with the Command Module, Ronald Evans, between 241 hours 22 minutes and 241 hours 59 minutes. The private conversation was initiated at Evans' request after he had ask permission to take a Lomotil, a medication to reduce gastrointestinal activity. Participants in the private conversation were Dr. Royce Hawkins, Dr. John Zieglschmid, Flight Director Charles Lewis, and CAPCOM Gordon Fullerton. Evans said he had had a continuation of a gas problem, mentioned previously by all 3 crewmen. Both Evans and Gene Cernan said their main concern was for tomorrow's EVA. Dr. Hawkins and Dr. Zieglschmid recommended Evans take 2 Lomotil tablets tonight and 2 more after breakfast to reduce gastrointestinal activity. They recommended that he take a semethocone tablet after meals for gas. They also recommended changes in Evans' breakfast menu tomorrow. Asked if the other 2 crewmen had had problems similar to Evans, Cernan reported that he and Jack Schmitt had had persistant gas which the crew felt was aggrivated by hydrogen dissolved in the water used for rehydrating foods on board the spacecraft. The crew reported the gas caused occasional discomfort, but that there was no serious problem such as nausea or pain. Dr. Hawkins said he was confident the medication and dietary changes recommended for Evans would preclude any problem for tomorrow's EVA. The news conference should begin approximately 5 or 6 minutes. We've had no further communications with the crew since saying goodnight to them about an hour ago. All going well aboard spacecraft America which is now 19,454 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity 3,997 feet per second. At 244 hours 26 minutes this is Mission Control, Houston.</span>

And there's a couple of obvious things I'm sure you've undertaken, but if you haven't, all the window shades off. Get some sunlight in there. And might crank on all the lights to get some more heat load in there. Also the - of course, the cabin fan and the temperature - CABIN TEMP control thumbwheel - it's your option on that. The other things, like mixing valve adjustment and powering up other items, we're looking at very seriously, but we would like to not do those items until after the EVA this morning. We'd like to remain the status quo on the ECS system with the exception of - you do have the cabin fans on your option there.

                <span class="spokenwords">Okay. We start today's newscast out with this historical fact. Today marks the 69th anniversary of man's first flight in a heavier-than-air powered machine. Back on December 17, 1903, Wilbur and Orville Wright, of Dayton, Ohio, took three historic flights on the sand beaches of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. The brothers will be honored today at a ceremony at a visitor's center near the flying site. Now, a look at the news. There's apparently been a serious hitch in the peace talks between the U.S. and Borth Vietnam. Dr. Henry Kissinger, in a curt news conference at the White House, has said that the North Vietnamese have reneged on earlier agreements and have brought out - brought the peace talks to a halt. Dr. Kissinger said the unresolved problems, which center around the number of peace supervisors and their placement, is not acceptable to the President, and Kissinger feels, and we quote, "We have not yet reached an agreement that thi.-President considers just and fair." Final unofficial returns from the Federally supervisee election name Arnold Miller the new president of the United Mine Workers. His victory over Tony Boyle appears to be only his first step in his promise to clean up the union. Former President Truman remains in serious condition at a Kansas City hospital. Doctors say that the 88-year old Truman is not responding to treatment. In the congressional spotlight in Washington, it appears that the contest for the position of House Majority Leader will be between Representative Thomas O'Neal of Massachusetts and Congressman Sam Gibbons of Florida. The two will vie for the post left vacant by the absent and presumed death of Congressman Hale Boggs. Boggs disappeared in the crash of a light plane in Alaska, in October. Northeastern Ohio has been blasted by a blizzard. As much as 28 inches of snow has fallen, blocking highways and closing airports. An additional foot is expected - was expected before it was to move east. Cleveland has been very hard hit with the white stuff, and the snow is now moving into the northeast. They'll have a white Christmas up that way. Here in Clear Lake, it's a clear, crispy day, but a chilly Sunday morning. Ellington had a 27 this morning. Might take a look at sports here. Miami defeated Baltimore yesterday 16 to 0, to go undefeated in the American Football Conference of the NFL.</span>

In a real hair raiser at Candlestick Park, San Francisco, John Brodie came off the bench late in the game, in fact, in the last 2 minutes of the third quarter, and led the 49ers to a 20 to 17 win over the Minnesota Vikings. The win gives the Western Division crown to the 49ers in the National Conference. His - the last touchdown thrown was with 5 seconds remaining in the game. That puts the Washington Redskins, Green Bay, San Francisco, and Dallas Cowboys in the NFC playoffs and closes out the NFC contest. In the American Conference, there's one key game today to decide the winner of the Central Division. Pittsburgh plays San Diego and Cleveland plays the New York Jets. Both Cleveland and Pittsburgh will get into the playoff's, but their position in the standings is not yet known. One will be the wild-card team, one will be the conference - division winner. Miami and Oakland are the other teams in the American Conference playoffs. Cincinnati plays here at Houston. And we'll keep you posted on that one. In local high school football, Baytown Sterling scored a major upset by defeating San Antonio Lee in the 4A semifinals. The score was 21 to 20 and the game in the Astrodome before 26,000 fans. The loss was the first in 28 games for the San Antonio school. In basketball, the Houston Cougars downed California last night, 79 to 75. Some other major college scores: Kansas, 60, over San Francisco, 58; Penn State, 65, over Boston, 63; New Mexico State, 69, Texas El Paso, 49; Indiana, 89, Ohio, 68; Minnesota, 87, Loyola, 81; Florida State, 85, Baylor, 67. And in pro basketball, Houston defeated the Detroit Pistons, 123 to 112. And just a final note from all your friends down at Cape Kennedy, they'd just like you to know that the Merritt island High School won the Florida State Championship, defeating Tallahassee Leon High School, 40 to 21. And, that's pretty much the update for the morning.</span>

On 16 we had some - rather strange readings on the EVAP OUT temperature and a few other ones. And the potential is there for you to get those same readings - especially if you had had moisture - the potential is to get those readings at - after depress, and we'll be watching it closely. I guess - I don't want to say just ignore them, but we'll be watching them and take any readings for after depress there with a grain of salt. And while you're at it, you might go down and zero the optics If you've got somebody in the LEB.</span>

We looked up there yesterday and couldn't find any, but there is some up there today. And the face of the hatch is slightly moist, but it's not - nothing like bubbles.</span>

Velocity 3,034 feet per second. Midcourse correction burn number 5, which is nominally scheduled at 253 hours 42 minutes Ground Elapsed Time will not be performed in as much as the correction is less than a half foot per second required. Meanwhile, the spaceflight meterology group with the National Weather Service said this morning that weather conditions are expected to be satisfactory for the landing and recovery of Apollo 17 on Tuesday. The weather forecast for the planned landing area, approximately 360 nautical miles southeast of Pago Pago, calls for partly cloudly skies, widely scattered rain showers, variable winds at 10 miles per hour, seas at 3 feet, and the temperature near 80 degrees. Still approximately 4 hours away from the transearth EVA in which Command Module Pilot, Ron Evans, will go hand over hand back to the SIM bay and retrieve film cassettes from the cameras and instruments in the SIM bay, pass them back into the Command Module for return home. At 253:18 still up live as long as the crew is awake, this is Apollo Control.</span>
