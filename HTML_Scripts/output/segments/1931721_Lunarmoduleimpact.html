One, we totally aborted that lunar sounder pass because: One, we couldn't get the HF antenna out; and, two, because the temperature in the film cassette was too low. Those things are both taken care of now, And they're talking down here about essentially starting over at 197 hours, which will be the top of the next page, and pretending that that's 195 hours and running through that 195-hour page, beginning at 197 hours. The only problem with that, of course, is that it runs into your eat period and destroys that, which essentially means that you're going to get to bed 1 hour later. And I guess what we're saying is, if you're going to get to bed 1 hour later anyway, we might go ahead and ask you to do it, if you're agreeable. If you're clean-uping - cleaning-up companions there have progressed far enough that you think you're going to get to bed on time and don't want to do it, then that's another story.

Handling characteristics were outstanding and pretty much the same as they have always been on LMs in the past. The APS burn - burn went nominal; the residuals on that one were actually quite big, about 744, that's feet per second - and we nulled those out and after that the midcourses were max of 1.3) then a max of 1.6 on the second one. But, after the TPI, we were coming up - up the pike right - over - right - all the way in the line-of-sight rates - actually both out of plane as well as in plane were - were zero - basically zero for out of plane and, as predicted, on a nominal curve for in plane. And it really ended up to be pretty much a storybook rendezvous.</span>

Dateline Washington, the United States today threw its support behind the Christmas Peace package proposed by South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu, who accused North Vietnam of using high-pressure tactics in an attempt to impose an incomplete peace settlement. American representatives at the Paris peace talks, told the Communists it was futile for them to continue clamoring for the signature of the cease-fire agreement drafted in October by Kissinger and Le Duc Tho. In Kansas City, the condition of former President Harry S. Truman weakened to, quote "very serious" Thursday. His doctor says vital signs are stable, but former President Truman was unable to speak; his lungs were filling with fluids still, and his kidneys have been impaired. In Mexico City, the International Federation of Airline Pilots, meeting in Mexico City this week, has promised a worldwide stoppage of all transportation industries if the governments do not take action to stop hijackings. In New York, the United States won an apparent victory in the United Nations when the General Assembly voted an approval of a cut in U.S. contributions to the world organization. Vote was 8l to 27, and reduces the U.S. budget assessment from 31*5 percent to 25 percent, starting in 1974. Here at home in Houston, the city council voted to locate the new proposed sports arena in the Greenway Plaza. The vote, however, stipulates that the Mayor find a way to finance it without using city tax funds. Council indicated that if the Mayor can't do this, the city will abandon plans for the 10-million-dollar, 18-thousand-seat facility. On the lighter side, in Jersey City, only one of 51 - that is one of 51 women who took physical exams for the police department, passed. Police Director Frederick Stevens said 24 of the women were too short, seven were underweight, and four did not have eyesight that could be corrected. In sports, the Alberta Oilers, that's Alberta and not Houston Oilers, these are the hockey ones, skated past the Houston Aeros for a 3-to-2 victory here in Houston. And the Minnesota Vikings, in the city of Minneapolis, came to terms on a lease agreement to play their games in a proposed stadium up there in the north, or I guess it's building a stadium to keep it from being too cold, instead of being too muggy like it is down here. And that's the news; as you can see, it's a slow news day and things are still moving very slowly down here.</span>

Fifty two minutes remaining until America passes behind the Moon, nearing the end of the 60th Lunar Orbit. An hour and 41 minutes until the crew awake time. America presently, is in an orbit measuring 62.5 at low point at which point it is at the moment, at pericynthion. And 180 degrees around at the rear side of the Moon it will reach apocynthion some 3 miles higher 65 nautical, and at 205 hours 48 minutes Ground Elapsed Time in the Mission of Apollo 17, this is Apollo Control.</span>

Some 42 minutes remaining, until the first call is made to the crew on the spacecraft. Approximately 5 minutes after they come around on the front side of the Moon on revolution number 61. Currently, the orbital digital display here in the Mission Control Center shows the orbit measuring 69.2 by 71.8 which may or may not be the current orbit. If it is some-. body has done a maneuver here. Here in the control center the flight controllers are going over the changes to the flight plan for the day's activities, getting all of the different entries, new entries to the flight plan sorted out and agreed upon. Preparation for crew wakeup. On second thought, disregard that earlier orbital measurement. I suspect this display maybe, is invalid at the moment.

A cease-fire proposal suggested by South Vietnamese government officials has been rejected by the U.S. White House News Secretary Ron Zeigler has declined to characterize the present Paris peace efforts, but say - did say there are still some obstacles to overcome. And we had another hijack attempt. A youthful Canadian, who hijacked an airliner in northern Canada was talked out of his escapade by his father. The youth had held 62 persons aboard the plane for a short while, then retained only four hostages for 10 hours. It appears that the United Mine Workers may have a new president. Maverick candidate Arnold Miller retained a strong lead over Tony Boyle in the government-supervised election. The transatlantic airfare price war that seems imminent, promises to be a real boon to the vacationer.

An attempt was made to nominate him for the presidential election while he was there, but the move was declared illegal and he returned to Paraguay.

A state senate's studying - study committee has heard some heavy opposition to parimutuel betting in Austin, but the proposal appears to have a good chance of approval. And if you follow the Tomball police force, who quit in masses a couple of days ago - Tomball has rehired three of the officers who quit, and two more of the police who walked out are seeking to be rehired. And just a note here - there was a little beautification of Houston. Some of the thousands of billboards that line main highways around Houston will be coming down after the first of the year. All signs must be licensed by the state and a fee paid after that time. Some of the sports news: Johnny Bench, the Cincinnati Reds catcher who had a benign spot removed from a lung Monday, is recovering nicely at Christ Hospital in Cincinnati, The star baseball player will remain hospitalized for about 5 more days. Brad Van Pelt of the Michigan State University defensive star won the Maxwell Club trophy as the year's top college football player. The Washington Redskin's Larry Brown took top honors as the top professional player of the year. Southern Methodist has apparently chosen a new football coach to succeed Hayden Fry, but University officials say an announcement won't come until next week. Mark Spitz and Shane Gould, both top Olympic swimmers, were honored as top athletes in the world by European sports writers - for this past year, of course. There was no action last night in college basketball. The University of Houston is getting ready to play California tomorrow night. Joe Paterno, Penn State coach, has won the Walter Camp Football Foundation award as coach of the year. And it appears that Mike Tillamen of the Oilers may play out his option this year and this - Coach Bill Peterson says that it upsets his draft plans this coming year. And I've already updated the weather to you. I just might add a little parenthetical thought that it's really not that much in the news and all the news around here anyway has been Apollo 17 and your lift-off. We picked up the lift-off last night from the Moon and carried it live TV for about 2-1/2 minutes as you went out of sight like a star, and then, of course, live TV picked up your docking and - rendezvous and docking. A very spectacular picture, I might add, of the lunar surface as the Challenger came up to meet America. Over.</span>

I can still - knowing they're there - I can still pick up the bands, streamers, I guess would be a better word. And last night when I watched one set, there was a strong linear streamer going out - oh, maybe 3 or 4 or 5 diameters - I'll have to get my directions straight. Well, I'll figure out which side of the ecliptic it was. That was not nearly so strong when I looked this time - now partly that may be dark adaptation, I don't know, but I'll try to keep track of that one. But these two streamers today are about an equal strength and they're still visible as zodiacal light.</span>

Just for your information, at the beginning of the next rev, we're going to have a Flight Plan update. Or actually, we'll have small - a pan camera pad at the beginning of the rev and then into the rev after the orbital science visuals, we'll have a Flight Plan update. What we're going to be doing is we're going to be doing an extra ultraviolet-scan program and we're going to do some antenna calibration on the HF - lunar sounder antenna so we get quite a lengthy Flight Plan update and, after that, it'll just be flying the Flight Plan. The thing with the lunar sounder is that we're getting a lot of noise from Earth that we don't see on the back side of the Moon in the HF and we'd like to calibrate this out.</span>

The slope of the walls is steep - probably 45 degrees on the inside - it's a gradual slope on the outside slipping away from the crater. There is no apparent albedo differences in the ejecta or patterned annulus around the crater itself and we're looking specifically at the one to the northwest of the Wright Brothers, now. There is a definite mare flow that is unindated [sic], and it's a different color and, you know, that you have a light albedo to it now, it's kind of a grayish tan. It's a light grayish tan material that has flowed - and I can't tell - it almost looks like it's flowed down to the crater. There is an impact crater right in the breach of the crater - which has nothing to do with the flow itself. The material in the - I'm almost out of sight of it already. I was going to say the material in the inner crater in these boulder ring structures down there - the material all the way in the center of it is comparable to the hummocky, bumpy looking type stuff that is not really the mare - not the smooth mare of Smythii - but the other part of the mare of Smythii.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">Yes, some of the craters, though, you can't see the boulder-ring structures on it. And some of them that are definitely impact craters, you know, that have the ejecta rings around them. I've got to study them a little bit more. This is really the first chance I've had to look at Smythii, on this pass, but I want to take a look at him a little bit more. Some of the boulder-ring basins there - the walls are not delta shaped at all. The one to the north and let's see, as you look to the Wright Brothers there's one directly north, and then the next one, and then the next one. The one directly north we'll say is 12 o'clock; the other one is 1 o'clock; and then a 2 o'clock crater. The 1 o'clock crater looks to me there is a high lava mark around the outer basin, the outer ring of the crater, itself. The one at 12 o'clock is the one I was talking about, has the breach on it with the later impact - the small impact crater on it. And without the binocs I couldn't tell flow direction, whether they were flowing into the boulder-ring basin from that mare patch on the outside or vice versa, so I'm going to try to check that out the next time around.</span>

One is the South and North Massifs and the other is the Sculptured Hills. And the Sculptured Hills are at a light gray albedo between the Massif and the dark mantle. This line is very evident and there's a definite break in slope that you can see between the South Massif the, I won't call it the slide, but the white mantle is out on the valley floor. And from here, Shorty stands out like a sore thumb.</span>

We'll need high bit rate during that time. That's why we need the - line of Bravo. And we're doing the Earth study of - with the - with the lunar sounder to determine the polarization of the noise from the Earth so we can subtract it out of our data.

Here in Mission Control we've completed a shift handover. The Flight Director on this shift is Charles Lewis, and our Spacecraft Communicator is Astronaut Gordon Fullerton. Flight Director, Chuck Lewis has completed a status review for each of his flight controllers and from all around the room reports of everything nominal come back. During this shift two things of interest will be the firing of the explosive charges left on the lunar surface by the astronauts to SS scientists and determining the sub-surface structure. The first of these charges, designated charge No. 6 is scheduled to be detonated at about 212 hours 51 minutes. There is some latitude in this event and because of that we'll have the television camera on the lunar Rover up early to catch the event as - at it's earliest possible occurrence, which would be 212 hours 21 minutes and will leave it up through 213 hours 21 minutes.</span>

So if you want to take any photos, we are suggesting using the-DAC and the 75-mm lens and using JJ which is very high-speed black and white. Ninety-eight percent of JJ is unscheduled. Here are some settings you might use for terminator photographs over mare. Use T2.8, 1/500, and infinity. For terminator over highlands, use T4, 1/500, and infinity. And for Tsiolkovsky on rev 74 that's GET of 232:58; that's sometime in the future here - we're suggesting using T5.6, 1/500, and infinity. Over.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">Okay. That was a projection of Fecunditatis Mare, I guess, up into there. Sculptured Hills tend to have both a regional distribution and a structurally controlled distribution, the structurally - structural control being apparently related to the rims of - of old craters. For example, there are some Sculptured-Hills-appearing topographic materials that - again, in the ray-excluded zone, but out in Fecunditatis, we find the rim of a fairly large flooded crater - in Fecunditatis. And all of this may tie in with the possible - possibility that we saw at the landing site, that Sculptured Hills are composed of an igneous gabbroic rock. And these may represent local intrusions controlled by the structure of an old impact crater - extrusions controlled by the structure of the old impact crater.</span>

This isn't a good viewing attitude at all, and we get a few isolated views that may be worth commenting on. The contrast, in my eye anyway, between the three color units around the landing site is a - let's call it a medium bluish gray to gray for the dark mantle; a light blue-gray for the annulus around Serenitatis; and, then, a tan-gray for the Serenitatis Mare proper. And, in Dawes, you can see - I think you can see that the overturned - or the - the rim materials are made up of the brownish-gray material, and the walls underneath those rims are the bluish-gray, which is the age relationship suggested by topography.

But, in one place, there's a very subdued, flooded crater which seems to control a arcuate projection - or, let's say, a circular projection - of the light blue-gray out over the tan-gray mare. Most of the major wrinkle-ridge system of Serenitatis, of course, is outside the annulus of blue-gray, except locally, and one of those places was in the - to the west of the Taurus-Littrow site. Although that wrinkle-ridge system does - I can see now, as we look south of Seren - in the southern portions of Serenitatis that wrinkle-ridge system does cross the contact between the blue-gray and the tan-gray.

In this particular case, it related to the sequence of events that created Imbrium, cratered it, and then flooded it with mare. And Archimedes is a completely circular - closed circle as a crater, and it is filled with mare. And it, in itself, is superimposed on the - one of the main benches of the Imbrium crater. Now, to have mare filling that crater and actually filling all the depressions of approximately the same level in the vicinity of a mare - of a large mare region, it's one of the things that's suggested to many people that rather than single sources for mare lavas, you have a multitude of sources in a very fractured lunar crust. The ultimate source in depth, though, is still certainly a subject for controversy.</span>

And I think he had commented on being layers in the ledges that were visible in the walls, and I certainly concur with that. Although we could not trace layers - individual layers from ledge to ledge, within a coherent ledge the layers were traceable; and, in one case, I'm sure I could count six or seven ledges - sub - well, layers within single ledges. Reason it reminded me of it is looking at Timocharis, and I cannot do that with Timocharis. It looks like it's - those ledges - any ledges that may have been present as a result of the Imbrium Mare have since disappeared by weathering. That's lunar weathering, of course. Of course, down here in the Imbrium - southern Imbrium - is one of the better regions of the Moon to observe the wrinkle-ridge systems or mare ridges, sometimes they're called. And it's purely that. They're fairly sharply defined - quite sharply defined ridges that are wrinkled in their pattern, sinuous would be another term. And with sharply defined slopes on either side of the ridge. Sometimes they are flat-top ridges; sometimes they are more like spines. And occasionally you see them that almost appear to have vertical slopes on one wall or the other. The whole impression that I have, anyway, is that they - there may be a combination of structure and folding of the surface of the mare - construction on the surface and folding of that surface. They're particularly interesting that they tend to - wherever there has apparently been an old sub - flooded crater - Yes, did you want to get that stuff? They seem to be controlled by the shape of flooded old craters within the Imbrium basin. And I think that's a safe conclusion, because you get the standard outlines shown by the rille - the ridges; excuse me. Some of them are polygonal, and some of them are quite circular.</span>

In the first observation, of the mass of material that goes out into the crater Fermi, the - it looks like there is a whole bunch of craters in there that have - or are essentially rimless craters. However, on close examination with the binocs, I couldn't see any that didn't have at least a slight indication of a rim. The rims that were on them were essentially very subdued. They extended out to about - oh, a half a crater diameter; and these are on the craters in the 500 - to 1000-meter size. I didn't get a chance to look at them, looking straight down the craters, to see if there was any depressions or any domes or any type of a structure in the bottom of craters. But I get the impression that they're - primarily all look - just of cones with no flat bottoms at all. And I'll look again at those things when we go by there next time. The flow that goes down into Waterman - if we look at the pictures, Tsiolkovsky 5 of 5 - the shadow is just about in the same area on this one as it is on that one, and I didn't take a chance to look in that one until I got to the west of it. So I'll have to look when I'm passing it from the north side of Tsiolkovsky looking south, to see what's down in the shadow area there. But when you're on the west looking back across it, you can't see into the shadow. But the material that's in the floor of the crater Waterman is the same type of material that the little flow on the northeast corner has broken off and slid down into its own little crater.</span>

I'll reserve judgement on some of the flat-floored, flat-mare filled depressions that are around the crater until I get a chance to look at those the next time around.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">Say, Gordy, something that struck me, - something maybe everyone else has thought about, but I hadn't before. At the southeast corner of Smythii, there was a relatively large - several large somewhat subdued craters but with relatively steep sides to them. And next to this one was a very small, white, bright-haloed crater. And I watched the rays of this crater; and the southeastern rays draped over the slopes of this much larger subdued crater - draped over the walls, all the way down onto the floor. And as they draped over the walls, they obviously gave me a very good albedo change from the darker wall to the very much lighter colored. But as they hit the floor of the crater, they form patterns that are not only not unlike, but actually very, very similar, to the light-mantled area that we have been referring to as a possible slide, back at Taurus-Littrow. The patterns as they drape down the inner slopes of the crater and onto the floor, I would be willing to bet if we went down there we'd probably find the same type of things we found at Taurus-Littrow.</span>

While we're waiting for the site to come up again here, which seems to interest us every time we go over it, I think we sort of came to a general concensus on the problem of the smaller cone-shaped craters on the far side that have the little pool-like concentrations of material in the bottom. If you look at the freshest of those craters, the - that seems to be contiguous with the streaks of very dark material that cover the walls and the rim of the fresh cone-shaped craters. As the crater gets older, that material - that distinction becomes less obvious; however, the pool remains, and all you lose is the dark streaks on the rim and on the walls of the crater. I think we sort of feel - suspect that that pool in the bottom of the fresh craters is just the concentrated impact melt that - some of which is - stayed there during the impact and other which drained back - that drained back after the impact from the - drained from the walls. And then, with time, that pool maybe subdued some. The structures in it, the swirls and little domes in that pool are subdued possibly not only by the impact but by debris, slides, and avalanches off the walls of the crater.</span>

It's still a gray, with an orange hue to it. And when I use any blue or tan or anything, it's a hue on gray; and I'll usually try to say gray in there. But to say something's orange, I think, would be misleading. It's really an orange-gray, but it's clearly a distinct hue.</span>

I was talking about in the same area, and I'm trying to mark it approximately on the chart. But it was a classic, small, bright-haloed crater. The classic with a classic ejecta and everything. Except it was this orange-hued crater. It was not bright-white. But it was very classic. And, as I said earlier, not subtle at all.</span>

And although this has come up in the past, we haven't said anything about it. You know, Ron put his biomed harness on a couple of hours ago, and he's going to end up wearing it a total of 6 hours. Then, all of a sudden, when we make a change-over again, and I put it on, and - for a 12-hour period, and then we change again. And one of the problems up here is putting these things on, and you'd like not to leave them on too long, but once you get them on, you like to make use of them. And it's a problem, it's time consuming. I'd like you to consider down there letting Ron wear those until tomorrow morning, having me change over then. And when EVA time comes, we'll take special consideration to whatever requirements there are.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">Okay. Let me start with the America's gear there. The - on the UV spectrometer, well, actually having to do with UV. During - back during rev 38, they sent an Aerobee sounding rocket from White Sands, up, and it carried a UV spectrometer above the atmosphere and successfully acquired solar UV calibration data. Farside terminator shows there is a hydrogen atmosphere, but it is much less than had been predicted. The PI is very happy with the mode 4 maneuver. On the IR scanning radiometer, it's still performing beautifully, and the PI is getting lots of high-quality data, and I understand is ecstatic about it. On rev 33, the crater Kepler C showed up as a 132-degree Kelvin anomaly on a 94 degree Kelvin background after 11.6 days of lunar night, the crater Reiner was a similar anomaly on that revolution. In low orbit on rev 9, Kepler A showed a broad hotspot corresponding to its ejecta blanket with a sharp spike corresponding to the crater in the center. One coldspot anomaly seems to correspond to a cinder cone-like feature in Mare Orientale near the crater Hohmann. On the lunar sounder, telemetry monitoring of the sounder's average reflected power indicates that the mare and highlands exhibit markedly different reflectivity, both HF and VHF. The data is consistent with distinct layering in the mare, as would be expected, where the mare flooded by successive layers of lava, although, they say other explanations are possible. They don't see that layering indication in the highlands. Predicted topographic signatures over features such as craters and mare ridges have been confirmed in principal. Of course, as you know, until they get the film back they don't have - they can't really reach any definite conclusions. On the cameras - the cameras, both cameras and the laser altimeter all appear to be performing very well. And everybody's especially happy with the solid laser altimeter performance. Okay, that kind of sums up SIM bay. Do you have any questions, that I could chase down, or should I go on with surface stuff?</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">Okay. On the surface, the heat flow. These are - these are little short summaries, each written by the Pis or co-Is (sic) on each experiment. Mark reports that the entire heat flow system is working perfectly. The probes have cooled down to a temperature of -16 degrees C at a depth of 2.3 meters, and are nearly at their final temperature. For comparison, at Hadley Rille, we found a -20 degree C at 1.5 meters depth, we had, to refresh your memory, was -16 at 2.3. Both probes show an increase of temperature with depth, and it is clear that we will get a valid heat flow measurement. The LEAM is functioning properly, responding to calibration, and sensors show a low noise figure. The LEAM will be off until lunar afternoon, and on, with sensors covered, until after sunset. Otto Berg ask that you accept his thanks and appreciation. On the LSG, the sensor beam cannot be nulled at this time, in spite of Jack's efforts. We are still studying the problem and hope to find a workaround. In any case, the instrument does function to some extent, as a vertical seismometer, and may be useful in a search for a gravitational radiatior from pulsars. The LSPE is fully operational. LM ascent clearly recorded on all four geophones. And apparent seismic velocity measured across the geophone array was 110 meters-per-second. Regolith velocity was very close to that measure at the Apollo 16 site. The LM impact was clearly recorded on the geophones, and the estimated distance was 10 kilometers away, in the South Massif, actually very close to the targeted point. Although, I guess you've discussed this, we didn't see it on the video. The first charge went off while you were on the backside, last rev, and it's very apparent on the tracers which I'm monitoring right now. I think the next one's due sometime within the next 2 hours. </span>

                <span class="spokenwords">Okay, the lunar mass spectrometer, the low voltage circuits of the LMS have been operated briefly. All monitors indicate the proper performance of the instuments, but application of high voltages will await lunar sunset, when both the analyzer and the site has had time to outgas. Temperature of the radiator plate is slightly above nominal, but not so high as to be even important. That was from Dick Hodges. Okay, here's a little summary from Dave Strangway on the SEP. He starts out by saying, "Water, water everywhere and plenty to be found," because you didn't get behind the timeline. The SEP transmitter was confirmed to be working well at the correct power level, using the lunar sounder. The receiver heated well above predictions during the whole mission, as I'm sure you are aware, but the two prime data legs were operated within the temperature limits of the recorder, and we have no reason to doubt that we got good data. There is also a good chance that the leg from Station 4 to the LM was within the temperature limits. Your procedures were performed excellently and we look forward to processing the DSEA tape.</span>

The Earth-Moon gravity transfer indicates a valve of - won't read the numbers, in miiligals - at the - at the Tarrus-Littrow base. But the value will be used to obtain a revised value for the lunar radius at this landing site. Gravity measurement made during the three EVAs showed a large negative anomaly of about minus 38 milligals at the base of the South Massif. A similar negative anomaly of about minus 30 at the base of the North Massif. Preliminary conclusions of the traverse gravimeter meas - TGE measurements indicate that the material under the valley floor of Tarrus-Littrow is much denser than that of the North and South Massif. The gravity values will support the hypothesis that the valley subfloor consist of dense basaltic rocks, perhaps as much as 3 or 4 kilometers in thickness. The extra measurement between stations 2 and 3 will be of great help in determining the nature of the boundaries of this basaltic layer and the varied extension of the massif.</span>

Do you have anything plugged in to the - is the biomed still plugged in and laying over on Jack's umbilical, or is there, is there anything plugged in to - to Jack's that could explain the funny trace here? It's kind of a sporadic-looking - looks like somebody with a heart in a pretty bad shape. (Laughter) Over.</span>

And coming up at about 215 hours 27 minutes, a little less than 1 hour from now, we're scheduled to have the second detonation of an explosive charge on the lunar surface as part of the lunar seismic profiling experiment. This charge will be a one-half pound charge located about six tenths of a kilometer from the Lunar Roving Vehicle. The summary of science information read up to the crew by our CAPCOM Gordon Fullerton will be available in the News Center. We hope to get copies of the information read up to the crew to the News Center and reproduced and available. It will of course also be available on the transcript somewhat later.

This charge is part of the lunar seismic profiling experiment. It is a one-half pound charge of explosives located about six-tenths of a kilometer southeast of the lunar roving vehicle. And we've got black and white TV now from lunar surface and we'll have that through the converter and up on the area where that charge is located.

And, we're looking through the lunar rover television camera at the spot on the Moon where we believe the second of two seismic charges to be detonated, is located. We do have a problem with the TV camera in that it appears to be heating up close to the acceptable limit and it could become necessary to shut the camera down prior to the time we have the detonation. This decision will be based in part on what sort of priorities the scientists have for other things they would like to view with the camera in relation to the detonation of this charge. And the instrumentation communications engineer, keeping a close eye on those temperature readings, reports that the temperature has apparently begun to stablize and to maybe even move down a bit, so we maybe out of the woods on that score.</span>

But the idea here is to look for some craters that we've identified on photographs that are in a similar geologic setting to Shorty Crater and see if we can see orange material around them. We're trying to determine if the orange material at Shorty is a one-time special occasion or whether possibly it's common to the area and just never been noticed before. And we think you'll be able to determine this visually, better than any other way. So, if you can get out the orbit - the orbit charts; the orbit photographs; let's see, the Lunar Landmark Maps for the CSM, and turn to the landing site number 2 of 4 picture. Let me know when you get that, and I'll show you where we think a likely point is to see craters that are similar in setting to Shorty, to look for orange material.</span>

We suggest that you utilize the best window in your attitude which you should be maneuvering to now, if you - if I haven't completely interrupted the Flight Plan. is - at that attitude, window - let's see - 1 is the best, and 4 should point up that way also. We suggest you get somebody on the binoculars at 1. And use the same camera setup, with the exception of using tbs 250-millimeter lens, if you can, that you're going to be setting up for as per the Flight Plan for the orbital science photos. If you can put the 250 on there; use KK as shown; and f/8, 1/250, and infinity - I'll repeat that when you get to it - for the pictures, if you see anything.

This is a very steep-walled depression, by the way. It has talus streaming down the sides of it, and the coloration streams in this same direction. It looks as if there may be layers or roughly horizontal zones that are - have the coloration that we're seeing, which are forming the talus slopes down below them.</span>

If Ron was talking about the same crater, and I have my doubts, he got a picture of it, he said. But the interior - I won't say there's a change to black; it's just dark. I'd say it's probably about the size, to put it in the right perspective, of Shorty, or just a little bit bigger. The inside is dark. By that, I don't nean it's black or anything inside; I just can't really see inside of it. But the - it's a rust-colored blanket that comes out and overlaps on the rims and then has the classic ejecta.

A few minutes ago you heard Capcom, Gordon Fullerton, query the crew as to whether or not a switch might have been placed in the wrong position on one of the pumps circulating glycol, a coolant, to fuel cell 1. And Jack Schmitt looked at the panel, confirmed that a switch was in fact in the OFF position, turned it back on and everthing was back to normal with no problem. By way of background the EECOM, John Aaron, had noticed a slight increase in temperature on fuel cell 1 via the telemetry. After watching it for or 4 minutes he asked Capcom to check with the crew, see if the switch controlling the glycol pump was in the OFF position and as mentioned, Jack Schmitt confirmed that it was. This pump, as we say, circulates liquid glycol coolant through the fuel cells and cools it in much the same way that water flowing through radiators and around the engine of your automobile, cools the automobile engine. The most likely explanation for the switch being in the wrong position that we have here, appeared to be a more or less transitory phenomenon, was that it was bumped by one of the crewmen moving about the cabin in zero g. The fuel cell temperatures very quickly dropped back to normal once the pump was turned on again. We have about 18 minutes remaining in this pass before we loose radio contact with Apollo 17. We are showing an orbit at this time with a high point or apocynthion of 65.2 nautical miles and a low point or paracynthion of 62.2  Among the other statistics the orbital weight of the CSM at this time is 36,477 pounds. And the orbital period just a tad under 2 hours - 1 hour 59 minutes 17 seconds.</span>

And for the rest of the flight plan up to the crews sleep period which begins at about 220 hours we have relatively quiet time very little scheduled in the flight plan - have an eat period. During the next revolution the crew will be operating the panoramic camera in the SIM bay. They're scheduled to be in the midst of an exercise period at this time. And we could confirm from the biomedical data on Ron Evans, his heart rate, that he was indeed exercising. Prior to beginning the sleep period the crew will be going through their film magazines getting everything ready for an active day of picture taking tomorrow. There will be a lunar surface science briefing at 9:20 a.m. Saturday December 16 in the main auditorium building 1 at MSC. Again that time is 9:20 a.m. December 16.

On this revolution, the major activities aboard the spacecraft will be the operation of scientific instruments. It's a relatively quiet period of time for the crew. The pan camera will be turned on briefly, just so we can get a look at the telemetry data on that camera. We won't be obtaining any photography with it. The mapping camera will be on for one full revolution obtaining ground track coverage supplemented by the laser altimeter data that provides an altitude reference in each photograph. Also the infrared and ultraviolet spectrometers will be operating and the crew will be taking a few hand held photographs out the spacecraft windows, using the Hasselblad camera. We may have a bit of noisy communications toward the beginning of this pass. We've just gotten acquisition of signal and we'll be receiving the spacecraft through one of the 85 foot dish antennas, rather than the 210 antenna. We do have acquisition of signal now and appear to have reasonably good signal strength.</span>

The one right above rev 62 picture on the thing, there's definitely kind of a - an unindated (sic) old depression there with a mare, very smooth mare floor on the thing. With two, - two old craters. And, that is definitely a younger flow than whatever made the polygonal craterlike depression. Right above the rev 62 number. The thing that bothers me about that is that they, they almost - oh, looks like if you threw a rock in the mud, you know - made a mud pie, and you get a wave or a ripple going out from there. In other words, you've got a high wavefront going out from a circular direction with a slightly sloping up to that wavefront. That's on the inner ring on the thing. The outer ring, of course, is a typical-type ring that you get from an impact type of an operation. It looked like the rough-looking floors of those rings, ring basins, essentially have the same albedo, the same characteristic, as the rougher looking floor in the Mare Smythii itself.</span>

It, again, has that dark greenish-black rock that is collected down at the bottom of it, and you also see it streaking down the side of it. But, I think one of the most significant features about the crater itself is that it has a swirl, and these are honest to goodness - they look like swirls rather than rays.

And two mags in particular, which look fine to us, are mag Barabara and mag Karen. Barabara has 500 frames of CEX, and Karen, 100 frames of black and white. Excuse me, 50 frames, not 500, of CEX. And 100 of black and white. These mags have never been fit checked on the command module cameras; but we believe that they will, along with - as long as we take precaution because the locks don't work the same, ... on the command module on the LM cameras, number 1. And number 2, the focus won't be quite as good as on the - with the LM cameras. However, it will be satisfactory. So there's 150 frames there you might want to take advantage of in those two mags.

In Kansas City, former President Harry S. Truman's condition continues to deteriorate as doctors are unable to restore his vital kidney functions. On the Paris peace talks scene, there has been essentially no apparent further developments today. It continues about the same. And in New York, police are red-faced, it says, when it was learned that more than 50 pounds of heroin originally seized way back in 1962 - this is part of the French Connection business - has been stolen from the police building where it was being kept as evidence. And a last local news item. Three prominent Houston men are missing. They were last seen in person at Cape Kennedy in Florida on December 6 but were apparently lost among the 500,000 people who watched the launch of Apollo 17 The following appeal, it says, is issued in case they are listening: "Gene, Jack, and Ron, - come home. And if you pass a fellow with a bushy white beard and crimson suit, advise him you'll be home before Christmas." That's the extent of the news.</span>

And everybody just looking forward to the EVA and the deorbit and the splash. Out in El Lago - everybody's fine out there, Ron. And John's out selling Christmas trees today and Jaime's going to go out shopping with her aunt sometime today and - a little Christmas shopping - it's getting near that time of year. And one of your friends from Phoenix is due in today, for the rest of the mission, I guess. And out in Tucson, it was a little early this morning, Jack, but everybody's up and about and I talked to your mother, and everybody's fine. She's getting anxious to go back to Silver City and see all the celebration. I guess those people out there are really enjoying it and really getting wild about it.

                <span class="spokenwords">Okay, everyone - everybody is talking about the success of the Apollo 17 mission here in Houston, and the weather. It was cold this morning. Some thermometers in the Houston metropolitan area were in the mid-20's. The lowest official temperature for the city of Houston was 31. I might add Ellington had a record 29. A huge high pressure system is dominating the midsection of the nation. Barometric pressure reached a high of 30.7 in the Houston area this morning at about 5:00 a.m. With strong gusty winds, the chill factor was a 5 above in Houston, and about a minus 10 degrees in Galveston. Man, that's cold. The national Christmas tree was lighted last night in Washington by Vice President Spiro Agnew. A small crowd, braving cold and rainy weather, watched, as the Vice President threw the switch to light up the 70-foot spruce that came from Medicine Bow, Wyoming. During the ceremony, Mr. Agnew said we must remember the many servicemen who are missing in action or prisoners of war in Indochina and pray for them this holiday season. North Vietnamese peace talk negotiator Le Duc Tho has told newsmen he is very optimistic about prospects for an early cease fire in Vietnam. Before leaving Paris, Le Duc Tho said he will remain in very close contact with Dr. Henry Kissinger. Dr. Kissinger is in Washington. A Paris radio station has said a peace pact signing is imminent, tut the report has been denied in Washington. Former Treasury Secretary John Connally says he expects to get a call from President Kixon shortly to carry out some foreign visits this coming year. One assignment nay be a visit to Moscow. John Scaii, a former newsman from A3C and a special consultant to President Nixon, is expected to be the next U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. a formal announcement from the White House is expected in a few days. An explosion has taken the lives of 21 men in West Virginia. The blast occurred at a steel-making complex near Weirtown, West Virgina, on the Ohio River. President Nixon has given the green light for a pay raise for all Federal employees. The across-the-board increase of 5.14 percent will benefit both civilian and armed forces personnel. A 747 jumbo jet, while taking off out of Miami International yesterday, went through a flock of birds and reportedly lost - had an engine go out. The pilot turned the aircraft around and went out over the Atlantic and burned down some fuel and landed at Miami, but skidded off the runway, hit a concrete culvert, and sheared the nose gear. A few passengers fainted, but only 4 were injured when they went down the slide. The unexpected always deserves some attention. The small community of Westwood, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City, will send back a check it has received from the Federal government in the Federal-revenue-sharing program. Major Joe Dennis said Westwood just didn't need the money. On the regional and local scene - I just might add - I see it's not here, that President Truman's condition seemed to deteriorate some last night, but he is still not listed on the critical list, he is serious. Miss Ima Hogg, the 90-year-old founder of the Houston Symphony, was honored at a gala birthday party last night and cake-cutting ceremony at the symphony. And little Tomball, Texas, has had police trouble, but nearby Pasadena doesn't seem to have any. Thirteen new pretty policewomen have just joined the suburban police force out in Pasadena. And Jack, here's a special for you. If you ever get tired of cracking rocks, why not try politics? A geologist, J. Leonard Davidson, is going to run for mayor of Houston during the 1973 election. And we also received word this morning that an elementary school in Silver City, New Mexico, is being renamed for their most illustrious graduate. It will now be the Harrison H. Schmitt Elementary School in Sliver City, New Mexico. A couple new college coaches have been named- Dave Smith has been named the new coach of Southern Methodist. Up in West Lafayette, Indiana, a veteran coach has been named to improve football fortunes at Purdue. Alex Agase, former head coach at Northwestern, will take over the Boilermakers. Kent Nix is expected to get the nod as starting quarterback for the Oilers against the Cincinnati Bengals in the final game of the year. Pastorini is still out with a pulled hamstring muscle. The Houston Rockets dropped their basketball game with the Baltimore Bullets last night by a score of 94 to 91. Purdue beat Western Kentucky last night 91 to 75. Friendswood High School was eliminated last night in the Class II-A semifinals as they bowed to Boling at Rice Stadium 33 to 7. And a final in the news today, Marian Rice Hart, the 8l-year-old American aviatrix, says she has at least two more years left for flying. Mrs. Kart is currently flying around the world in a singleengine Beechcraft Bonanza. She is presently in Katmandu, India. That's all from Editor Jim Kukowski here.

And the outer - crater rims on that thing are kind of like the one - ... about rev 62 in the picture, but the outer rim - is sloping in the opposite direction from the normal crater, or something. In other words, the steep slope is on the outside of the rim, and you have a gradual slope up to the - you know, from the center of the crater, you've got a gradual slope up to the rim, and then it drops off to the steep slope on the outside. And the steep slope on the outside is maybe - oh, 35 to 45 degrees. The slope on the inside is probably - somewhere around 20 degrees - would guess. And there is one portion of the rim - kinda of on the western portion of that one that I was lookmg at, anyhow, it's almost a delta-shaped ring.</span>

I guess that's what I can term them or call them - that's what they always kind of looked like to me. But - they slope up. But the rims of those craters and even the interior rims on ones that are multi-ringed, they slope upward from the center of the crater toward the rim, and a gradual slope, and then they drop off on the outside of the crater rim, sloping down from the outside crater up to 45 degrees. And then at some points on there, it almost looks like it's a real classic delta-shaped rim on them, where you have the same slope on the inside as well as the outside of the crater.</span>

It's got a - a very, very obvious ... furrow, looks like it's elongated, basically to the - generally to the east and to the west. I can't tell, but because of the shape of it, and because of those a ... darker rim deposits I'm sure there must be a vent there somewhere, but it's too dark down in there. I can't really see for sure whether there is one or not. But, if there is, I imagine it's pretty big. And I can't tell., it's only sort of intuitive, but I imagine the elongation was produced during the thrust of the initial dynamics, the formation of the impact.</span>

I've been able to, over the last day - just generally searching it out, I've been able to find rilles that clearly cross and separate portions of ridges. And ridges that clearly cross and partially bury rilles. And in another third case of a rille that appears to be levied - that is, have banks of - flat banks on either side, but near the end of it, it transitions into a mare ridge, very clearly. It looks as if, to me, that the rille and ridge problem in here is just one of repetitive compression and extension within the surficial flows of the Imbrium Basin. And that possibly during the compressive stages, there were extrusions locally along the ridge system, but in the main part, the ridge systems do represent, I think, a doming it looks like just a doming of the mare surface except for these local ridgelike extrusions.</span>

Right now we're looking at probably pulling in those antenna at 233:45 or 46, right in that time frame. If those maneuvers - that should not work, we shall have to jettison the antennas at around 234:3 - 235:39. We have, and we won't give it to you until we need it. We have a VERB 49 maneuver to a jett attitude for 234:25, and that'll keep in that attitude and then we'll jettison the antennas at 235:43, and, of course, we'll have to bring up the logic power on those.

One of the ways that seems be useful for determining the relative age of the larger basins, to me anyway, is the abundance of block fields on the slopes of the walls or the slopes of the central peaks.

And, there's a crater, looks like a subdued impact crater, right on that structure, and you can see the trace of the graben down the walls - the west wall of the crater and up the east wall. And it does - from directly overhead, it appears to taper downward. The walls of the graben, that is, get closer together as it approaches the bottom of the crater. And on the south wall of the graben, as exposed in the west wall of the crater, there's a fairly sharp - sharply defined white area in the talus.</span>
