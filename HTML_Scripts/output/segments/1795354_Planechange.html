                <span class="spokenwords">Okay. We'll do that. Let me give you a - a quick rundown on review of what we're going to do this morning. We've got the extra RCS trim burn that's going to be coming in, and I've got a pad for that guy. And I have about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 one-liners to go into your Flight Plan, to bring it up to date. The general plan is to do a minus-X RCS on the trim maneuver, in order to avoid impinging on the SIM bay. That burn will be about 30 seconds worth. And that's going to give you about 9 foot per second DELTA-V. The maneuvers have all been checked out, and it's a reasonable timeline. And so, I have both the plane change and the trim pads for you. And that may cut into your eat period just a little bit. So, you might keep that in mind, that when you get a chance to nibble; that's probably a good - good thing to be doing. And then once we finish the plane change, we - we're going to be back on the nominal Flight Plan, and pressing on in a - just like we have been. We'll be leaving the mapping camera in and taking pictures with it still retracted, in a attempt to avoid increasing the number of cycles on the camera. And we'll be running the SPS PU valve in the decreased position, in order to optimize our propellant loadings.</span>

This will be four jets, minus-X on the RCS. And, I'd like to just add a comment here about the attitude. This attitude is one that's computed after you've gone to the plane-change REFSMMAT. And when you call P41, you'll be getting a different set of attitudes computed out of it because of the P41 computing a plus-X burn. But, when you're in attitude and P41's called, and you get to the DELTA-V register, you should be able to put all of the DELTA-V in one axis.</span>

Got almost everything done, They had to delete Station 10 in order to make up time, but that's made up for by the fact that they found some more interesting things at other stops. And there was - I mentioned the dikelets, and there's some indication that they may have seen a dike or something of that nature over on the North Massif, And Jack went out and applied all his - his physical skills to the lunar surface gravimeter and that included jumping ana kicking and pounding and it still doesn't work. Guess we'll get them up about 183:45 and the only thing we've had to do on their Surface Checklist for launch day is just to scrub the P22 that was in there. And we're just going to drop that one to make up some time--and it looks like they ought to get about 8 hours sleep out of it. So looks like everybody is in good shape. And you've got just a few seconds to LOS. Keep your eye on the waste water and we'll see you.</span>

And approximately 48 minutes until America comes around again, coming up on two maneuvers. Spacecraft communicator, Ken Mattingly, read up the PAD's or the data needed by the Command Module Pilot for performing these maneuvers. The first is a trim maneuver to tune up the command module orbit, prior to the lunar orbit plane change maneuver. The trim maneuver will be done on the back side of the Moon when we're out of contact with the spacecraft. That trim maneuver is scheduled at 181:34:01 or 181 hours 34 minutes 1 second Ground Elapsed Time. Total velocity change in posigrade - 9.2 feet per second. Burn time RCS - that's with the reaction control system engines - 30.06 seconds. And as Mattingly mentioned to Evans, it's being done in so called minus X direction. In other words the spacecraft will pitch over engine bell forward toward the direction of flight so that Evans will see where he's been instead of where he's going. And the RCS thrusters will fire forward so that the instruments in the SIM bay will not be damaged by the exhaust plume from the rearward firing engines. The effect is the same, however the spacecraft's performing the maneuver in a pitched over attitude and actually 180 degrees away from the original land direction. On the next front side pass, then, following that the scheduled lunar orbit plane change maneuver putting the command module America back into proper co-planer path with the landing site for rendezvous later today. This maneuver is scheduled at Ground Elapsed Time of 182:33:53. Total burn time on the SPS engine of 20.07 seconds, for a velocity change of 366 feet per second. This a burn that will force the plane of the orbit back to coincide with that of the lunar module as it makes its ascent from Taurus-Littrow back into orbit for the rendezvous sequence. The orbital measurements after the trim burn will be 67.3 nautical miles apocynthion by 62.4 at pericynthion. The plane change maneuver has also some retrograde component in it. A very slight retrograde component, which will Circularize the orbit at 62.7 nautical miles. At 181 hours even, this is Apollo Control.</span>

It's - it's almost unbelievable when I talk to the guys in the backroom, and I just wanted to make sure that you knew that I knew it.</span>

And he's given us a summary of the late news. And the weather couldn't be worse in Houston. It had to be better on the Moon or in orbit around it. This morning more cold and drizzle blanketed the Houston metropolitan area. Yesterday morning it was 32 degrees. This morning a little warmer but a lot wetter, and it's getting colder on Friday. On the national-international scene: Peace talks in Paris between Dr. Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho have ended - at least for the time being. Dr. Kissinger is in Washington today to brief President Nixon on the talks. The past 3-1/2 weeks, the pair of negotiators have held 58 hours of talks. Neither side is giving out any hints. When asked about the cease-fire by Christmas, Dr. Kissinger told reporters at Andrews, "I don't want to make any predictions." The U.S. by sizeable vote has had its assessment to the fund of the United Nations reduced by a vote of 8l to 27. The U.S. will now pay only 25 percent of the cost rather than the present 31 percent. Transatlantic fares may drop beginning in February. The International Air Transport Association says all carriers will set their own prices. It appears that air travelers to Europe next year may get some real bargains. In the hotly contested and federally supervised United Mine Workers election, the insurgent candidate, Arnold Miller, has gone into a lead over incumbent President Tony Boyle. Miller has led a grass roots movement to oust Boyle who took over the union control from the late John L. Lewis. We mentioned the rather dismal weather in the Houston area this morning, but the midwest and northeast are really getting some bad weather. Ice storms seriously hampered the northern part of the nation, from Idaho to the eastern seaboard. After almost a year, troops involved in the India-Pakistani War are beginning to go back to their homelands. Truce-line maps have been exchanged and approved by both governments. Civil servants of the European Common Market, they're called Eurocrats, are on strike. The 8000 employees walked off the job due to a salary dispute. On the regional and local scene: the Houston City council has vetoed a plan to build a nev commuter airstrip in southwest Houston for the STOL aircraft. Residents of the area have been protesting. The community of Tomball, north of Houston, is looking for a new police force. The police chief and seven officers walked off the job Tuesday, after the City Council refused the officers a pay raise. In Harris County, the State Highway Patrol end reserve police have been called in to maintain police protection. That's maintain protection in Tomball. The project to expend the - expand the Armand Bayou as a park and wildlife refuge has been given a boost with a $100,000 pledge. So far $350,000 has been pledged and $750,000 is needed to gain Federal matching funds. Galveston will hold a school bond election on February 3rd. The bonds, if okayed, will be used to air-condition all schools not so equipped and to improve lighting in two schools. It's a light day in sports; the head coaching job for SMU is open, being considered are North Carolina coach Bill Dooley, and Washington coach Jim Owens. George Blanda, a living testimony for the over-40 set will become the oldest man ever to play football this Sunday. Prior to Blanda, I guess, we've had some other folks, but this ought to be a new record. In pro basketball, Houston didn't play last night. Currently, Baltimore, Boston, Milwaukee, and Los Angeles lead the divisions. In pro hockey, Alberta beat the Houston Aeros, 3 to 2. The big news in Houston sports is a City Council approval of the Greenway Plaza as a site for the 10-l/2-million-dollar sports arena. And finally in - Christmas shopping is in full swing. Christmas trees are in tents, on street corners, and supermarket sites all over the area. Private homes throughout the whole area are lighting up with decorations ranging from happy Santa Clauses in sleighs to nativity scenes. It will be a Christmas world waiting for you when you come home. And that ends our summary for this morning.</span>

During the just completed front side pass the Command Module Pilot Ron Evans completed the lunar orbit plain change maneuver which went nominally on time with a velocity change of 366 feet per second using the service propulsion system engine. Just prior to that before he appeared on the front side of the Moon a small trim maneuver was performed using the forward firing reaction control system thrusters. This maneuver was to trim up the orbit. Some dispursions that had grown during the lunar orbit period that America has been in motion about the Moon. The Gold Team of Flight Controllers is handing over at the moment to their replacements after about a 12-hour shift. The oncoming team is the White Team of Flight Controllers headed up by Eugene Krantz. There will not be a change of shift press briefing of the off going shift. 47 minutes to wake up of the surface crew, Schmitt and Cernan. And at 182:57 this is Apollo Control.</span>

The crew's early arising caught us a little unprepared here in mission control we had our own wake up tune to play up to them this morning which was to be the title theme from the motion picture 2001 A Space Oddessy, however they beat us to the punch with their own wake up song to the control center and we'll play that back for you at this time.</span>

We have reacquired Ron Evans aboard the Command Module America and everything is progressing very smoothly aboard that vehicle. We're on separate communication circuits at the present time and will be up until the revolution prior to LM liftoff at which time we'll switch back to a single air-to-ground a single spacecraft communicator operation and be able to follow the operation in both vehicles simultaneously. That will be at acquisition of signal on the CSM's 51st revolution.</span>
