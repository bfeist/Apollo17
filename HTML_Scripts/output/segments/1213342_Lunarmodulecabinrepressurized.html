And it - fairly uniformly distributed. There are blocks a meter in diameter.</span>

Our flight director Gene Krantz and his team of flight controllers are replacing the Pete Frank team. Our spacecraft communicator on this shift is Astronaut Joe Allen. And aboard Challenger on the Lunar Surface, Jack Schmitt and Gene Cernan, are in the process of getting the Lunar Module reconfigured, ready for their sleep period, which the flight plan calls for them to begin at 128 hours or about 3-1/2 hours from now. After they complete the reconfiguration of the Lunar Module and get the cabin more or less ship shape, they'll have an evening meal, eat period before retiring. And aboard the Command Module, we said good night to Ron Evans on the last revolution, the 18th revolution of the Moon for the CSM, and we're just about to reacquire the Command Module, now on its 19th revolution, presuming that Ron Evans will be asleep. During the EVA, Evans was primarily involved with running the lunar sounder experiment. This was one of the major activities aboard the Command Module. That experiment appeared to be functioning well, obtaining surface and sub-surface data on the lunar stratigraphic sequences and structure. We have a change of shift briefing, which will begin in a little less than 15 minutes in the News Center Briefing Room, Building 1.</span>

Jack Schmitt and Gene Cernan aboard Challenger on the lunar surface have been involved in getting the portable life support systems recharged for tomorrow's EVA. And we're planning to debrief them on the first EVA shortly. They are then scheduled to continue getting the LM cabin configured for sleep and they have some time set aside to eat and we hope to get them into their sleep period at the time called for in the flight plan, which is a littles less than three hours from now. During the change of shift and we accumulated a small amount of taped conversation with the crew. We'll play that back now and continue to stand by live.</span>

However, there is a fair amount of pad built into the Flight Plan during this period of time, up through the eat period and beginning with their sleep period, and we do expect to get them to bed on time. We also, earlier, got a report from them on weights - sample weights in sample collection bag number 2 and also in the sample return container, the rock box that was brought back aboard the lunar module. They reported 16 pounds for the sample collection bag, 32 pounds for the rock box. These are the gross weights, and we'll be coming up with net weights based on the estimated weight of the containers and other equipment. They are usually packing equipment stowed on the rock boxes. As soon as we have a net weight for the samples we'll be passing that along. The next activity scheduled in the Flight Plan is the EVA debriefing and we expect that that will be occuring in the next 30 to 45 minutes.</span>

Then we're going to read up to you a LEVA cleaning procedure which is fairly simple, a real short geology debrief, a one-line change in the Lunar Surface Checklist. And then, we've been doing some thinking down here about how to fix the fender. And it's going to involve, we think, although we'll work on it while you guys are getting some rest, it's going to involve using utility clamps, from inside your LM there, instead of tape, to fasten some sort of stiff material onto the Rover in place of the missing fender. And we'll go with either with one of your - your cue cards, or possibly with part of insulation that was the flame blanket protecting the Rover during the landing. Or perhaps part of the packing material that was between the Rover wheels, and is probably lying on the ground underneath the LM there.</span>

Either that or back of a part of a data book or something - I hate like the devil to tear one of those other fenders off. And the reason tape won't stick is that everything's got a fine coating of dust, and the only way I could finally get it to stick was to put tape on it -rip the tape off - or take the tape off - which took some of the dust off and then tape would tend to hold it. But it just won't hack it up here.</span>

And if it looks like we can do it, and it won't cost you any more than say 10 minutes, we're going to have you go through with it. If it takes longer than that, we're going to go back to the drawing board and see what else we can do here.</span>

The Rover mobility rates over the short span you drove, which is hardly representative, are slower than people had anticipated. Do you think this is due to visibility, terrain, or what? Do you think you can still hack a 7.3 or 8 kilometer minimum or average to Station 2 tomorrow?</span>

We didn't drive in many straight lines. Trying to find, for the most part, our bearings, and tried to pick some high spots so we could look around. So I think straight-line navigation out in the area we're going is going to be easily 8 kilometers.</span>

And it sloped off, and I'd say at least a half a meter high in the line of sight from where the neutron probe is to the - to the RTG.

But - because those boulders are fairly light-colored, they look like they're probably 50 percent plagioclase. The - it could be that the regolith is derived from some other material that has blanketed the area. I don't think we have that answer, yet.</span>

Let me sum up by saying, that I guess as I indicated before, our best guess is that the vesicular crystalline rock, probably gabbro, or I think you've been calling it intermediate basalt or gabbro, forms at least the upper part of the subfloor. I don't think we've been close enough to a large crater rim to say that it's a - what the deep sections of the subfloor form, but we think that this intermediate gabbro vesicular rock, at least medium-grained, perhaps coarsegrained rock, forms at least the upper layer of the subfloor.

But, I don't think we've seen, or done anything today that is going to make us change very much from the nominal station of - nominal EVA-2 plans. The fact we didn't get the station -to the EVA-1 at the large boulders at Emory is probably going to mean that Station 5 might be shifted a little bit to the boulders on Camelot. But certainly Station 5 on the subfloor and also to Station 10 have assumed a higher priority than they originally had. Other than that I, don't think we'll see an awful lot of changes to EVA-2.

Step number 2 reads: If excess dust still remains, use a towel from the LM tissue dispenser, which has been wetted with water, and gently wipe the visor from the top to the bottom; that is, in one direction. And fold this towel after each wipe to keep the contact surface clean. There's a note. "Take care not to wet the inside that is, the concave surface of the gold visor." And the last step is: Allow it to air-dry. And that's it on the LEVA cleaning.</span>

We've only got one or two annoying problems with it, nothing major, that is with the SIM bay, not with the sounder. One of them being that we have our usual mapping camera extend problem. And we've just decided to leave it extended and it will serve it right if it gets a little contaminated with an occasional dump. And, I guess there's a minor problem with one of the big antennas. It didn't pass its retract check properly, so I guess it may have to be jettisoned when we do a plane change. Otherwise, things are working beautifully. Over.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">This is Apollo control at 127 hours 58 minutes. And the crew aboard Challenger on the lunar surface are now getting configured to begin their sleep period. Among the things in the checklist that they have done is to turn off the power amplifier which accounts for the somewhat noisier communications that we're getting. This is a normal presleep configuration and we don't expect to be communicating with the crew a great deal in the next hour and of course, none while they're in their sleep period. As you heard in the last exchange between CAPCOM Joe Allen and Gene Cernan, the crew will probably be getting the sleep period about one hour later than the flight plan calls for. At around 129 hours rather than the nominal flight plan time of 128 hours. We plan to allow them the full 8 hours for their rest period which means that they will be waking up just prior to 137 hours about 136 hours 55 minutes will be the wakeup time. And this would also slip the start of EVA-2 by about one hour giving us a start time for EVA-2 of 140 hours 10 minutes or about 5:03 p.m. central standard time. There is a one and a half hour pad following EVA-2 and EVA-3. This is identified in the flight plan as MCC conference and amounts to one and a half hours that can be used to make up loss time after the second EVA and third EVA. We would expect to make up the lost hour after the first EVA; however, if we are again running somewhat late after the second EVA rather and if we are running somewhat late after the second EVA we still have the hour and a half pad after the third EVA and would of course expect to be back on the nominal flight plan in time for an on time liftoff from the lunar surface. But, again, based on the one hour late beginning of the sleep time and our plans to give the crew a full eight hours of sleep. We would expect the EVA-2 to begin one hour late. At 140 hours 10 minutes or about 5:03 p.m. central standard time. We'll continue to leave the communication circuit, PAO release Line up live until it appears Cernan and Schmitt have begun their sleep period - have actually gone to sleep. We'll be reacquiring the command module in about 21 minutes. That vehicle now on it's 21st revolution around the Moon. And Ron Evans now about four hours into his scheduled eight hour sleep period. At 128 hours 2 minutes, this is Apollo control, Houston.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">This is Apollo Control at 128 hours 54 minutes. Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt aboard Challenger on the lunar surface have turned off the voice subcarrier. we don't expect to hear from them any further. However, we do not believe at this time that they have begun their sleep period. Cernan reported about an hour ago that it didn't look as if would actually begin their sleep period until about 129 hours. So we expect that they are probably very close to beginning and will actually get to sleep within the next 10 or 15 minutes. Ron Evans aboard the Command Module crossed over the landing site some 10 or 15 minutes ago. America is now in it's 21st revolution of the Moon. And Evans has been sleeping soundly for nearly 5 hours. we do plan to let Cernan and Schmitt sleep a full 8 hours which means that they will be getting up about an hour later than the flight plan time which will also slip the start of EVA 2 by about 1 hour. Because of the noise on the air-to-ground line, with the lunar module operating with it's power amplifier OFF, which is the normal configuration for sleep period, we are going to take the relief line down. We'll record any conversations we get with the crew. Also, we would have a pretty good chance of getting the lines up in the event they plan to give us a call because we'll see the voice subcarrier come on first. But in any event either live or play-back we'll come up very shortly after any conversations with Challenger on the lunar surface or America in orbit around the Moon. At 128 hours and 56 minutes this is Apollo Control Houston.</span>

Gene Cernan called to say that he and Jack Schmitt were beginning their sleep period and would see us in the morning which will be at a Ground Elapsed Time of 136 hours 55 minutes. We plan to give them the full 8 hour sleep period called for in the flight plan. Also, Ron Evans, continuing to sleep soundly aboard the orbiting command service module America, completing it's 21st revolution of the Moon. And we're about to lose radio contact with the command module as it goes behind the Moon on that revolution. Both vehicles continuing to perform normally and good solid data from both the command and service module and the lunar module. Wakeup time for Evans aboard America is 131 hours 20 minutes. 31 minutes, this is Apollo Control Houston and we'll replay that very brief segment of tape from the lunar module Challenger.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">Okay. I'll read a few selected excerpts here. The surface around the landing site is generally an undulating plain, which was somewhat rougher and had a greater abundance of blocks than was expected by the astronauts. It is saturated with small craters not exceeding a few centimeters in size but not with larger craters. Small craters commonly have glass on their floors. Boulders ranging from about 1/2 meter to 4 meters are common. All of them are partially buried or covered with the dust of the dark mantle. In one locality, a crater of about 1 meter deep pentrated the relatively fine dark surface material and excavated small blocks. Other shallower craters in this area did not fully penetrate the mantle. This fact, together with the abundance of small boulders on and near the surface, indicates that the dark mantle is relatively thin. A minor amount of dust noted upon landing suggested a thin layer of fine grain unconsolidated material. Footprints and LRV tracks left firm impressions in the fine grain material when darker material was kicked up from underneath. At the ALSEP site, the drill encountered harder material several times and definitely seem to reach harder material at about a 7-foot depth. The deep drill core apparently also bottomed in harder material. In the core, the material was noted to be cohesive, and it contained more fragments than did the surficial material. Predominant rock type between the LM and Steno Crater is medium grained, vesicular or nonvesicular basalts or gabbro. They contain about equal amounts of plagioclase and pyroxene along with less abundant opaque material. The guys took a total of - well, they took a lot of pictures. They had 229 color and 197 black-and-white during EVA-1. And they got 17 samples in addition to the deep drill core. Three were large, unbagged rocks, and the total, excluding the core, estimated to weigh about 13 kilograms so far, and they traveled about 3 kilometers in the Rover. As a summary conclusion, the observations made on the first EVA support the premission interpretation that at least the upper part of the subfloor materials consist of basaltic lava flow. The overlying dark mantle may be part of the regolith on subfloor material, but the possibility that it is an independent unit remains open and will be tested by observations on second and third EVAs. Both the dark mantle and upper sub floor units contain remarkably little foreign material between the ALSEP site and Steno with suggests comparatively young ages. Over.</span>

The central station and all the experiments with the exception of one are working normally.

According to our rather crude read-out on film remaining, it looks like we're using more film than we should be in the recorder, and -it's - if you add up the amount of film used according to that telemetry compared to some times when the RECORDER has been ON and also in STANDBY, it looks like there's a possibility they jive to show that we might be pulling film through the RECORDER in - while we're in STANDBY. This is unlikely because it takes a couple of failures that we don't think are really likely at all, but we're going to try to run a little test at 134:50, during that sequence of getting set up with the VHF sounder pass.</span>

Hey, we spent some time on this - fender problem and worked out a pretty simple-minded procedure, which involves essentially taking four of those chronopaque pages out of your lunar surface maps, ones which are not going to be used for discussing the site, taping them together with gray tape so that you end up with a piece of paper about 15 inches by 10-1/2 inches, and then using the AOT lamp clamps, preposition them full opened, and taking them out, and taking that piece of paper out, laying it on top of the fender guide rails and - and clamping the edges of it with the AOT lamp clamps. It's simple and straightforward, and the beauty of it is you're only spending about 2 minutes in the clamping operation, and it could save you up to about 12 dusting, I think maybe. What do you think?</span>

In other news, South Vietnam's President Thieu has suggested that all prisoners of war be released before Christmas. He has also asked that all Vietnamese parties be included in peace negotiations. South Vietnam and the Viet Cong are now not directly represented in the secret talks now under way in Paris. Meanwhile, Kissinger met for more than 4 hours yesterday with Hanoi representative Le Duc Tho. The two negotiators are expected to meet again this afternoon. The former President, Harry Truman, is still resting quietly, although his condition remains serious according to his doctors. American poet Mark van Doren died at the age of 78 - He was a professor of literature at Columbia and a winner of the 1940 Pulitzer Prize for his poetry. President Nixon announced yesterday that he wants to extend wage price controls beyond the scheduled April 30 expiration date. He also plans to freeze new hiring, promotions, and pay increases for executives of the Federal Government, which doesn't affect us, I guess.

                <span class="spokenwords">Hey, Gordo, we're still eating, but let me give you a few observations. That outcrop I talked about that was way at the top of the South Massif at the break in slope - at the very top of the break in slope - almost looks - it's hard to tell that it's inplace outcrop up there. It's hard to convince myself that it is. Looks like there's some very large and many, many small fragments of large - like 3 and 4-meter rocks up there and a lot of smaller fragments. I've seen that type of of thing in a number of places over the South Massif. However, I - do see - they also, they all seem to be sitting on top of the South Massif surface, but I do see one other area that it looks like there is a - it is protruding from within some sort of mantle on the South Massif. So conceivably some of that could be a place [?]. An additional impression I got is - is that at least with the monocular, that those fragments - those boulders look much more angular than what we've seen here. And, for the most part, they appear to be - if covered at all - very little by any mantle except the one I just mentioned.</span>

It's practically the same color as the South Massif. It just looks to be very undulating. I see no outcrops evidenced from here in the scarp. I think I can just about see where Hole-in-the-Wall is, but it's so subtle that I can't really tell you much about it. And the local terrain, which I think is the southern rim of Camelot, just about blanks out where Hole-in-the-Wall should be - just about covers it up. But what I can see in a small little saddle to our local horizon here in front of us - I can see out there just about - oh, I'd say a 100 meters or so to the south of Hole-in-the-Wall and it just looks like a subtle undulating slope. We can't really tell too much the steepness from here.</span>
