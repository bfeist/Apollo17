And it also - will also prevent water sep spindown like happened yesterday, if you happen to have the hose - the return hose blocked against the wall outlet there. The change is to write in on the upper left corner of 5-10, just prior to "SUIT isOL, ACTUATOR OVERRIDE (SUIT DISCONNECT)." Write in "PRESSURE REGS A and B to EGRESS."

                <span class="afjwho">CC</span>
                <span class="spokenwords">Okay. I'll read here from this thing just verbatim. It says, "EVA 3 continues to follow essentially the nominal premission plan. Main objectives continue to be the North Massif; Station 6, J; Sculptured Hills; and Van Serg Crater. In view of the extensive observations of the dark mantle and main - and plains subfloor unit on EVA 1 and 2, particularly there before Station 5, the relatively - the relative priority of Station 10 is reduced, so that Station 10 becomes a flexible station as time allotment is a reserve, possibly providing more time at the earlier station, if desired. However, mantle and block sampling at Station 10 are still important objectives. Block pack constraints are not nearly as tight as they were yesterday, guys, and so we can be more flexible in reshuffling station times if we need. We probably won't be coming up against option walkbacks like we did at Station 4. Closeout time at the LM has been increased by 20 minutes to make the closeout less rushed and to allow for potential ALSEP troubleshooting. It is currently planned to take this time from Station 6, 7*"</span>

        <div class="utterance" id="timeid1612627">

                <span class="afjwho">CC</span>
                <span class="spokenwords">But if 6/7 requires more time when we get there,we can borrow it from one of the other stations; I guess, in particular, station 10, probably. As the initial activity then, we are going to have to take explosive package 5 with us, and we'll stick it under the LMP seat, and I'll remind you in real time when we get down on the ground on that one. And number 5, 3 pound, will be deployed at station 10, and again I'll remind you about that in real time, so don't - you don't have to bother to write it in on your checklist. Planned traverse proceeds as normal. We're expecting to spend about an hour and 20 minutes at stations 6 and 7, and the suggestion is that we may end up wanting to spend that totally at the split boulder at station 6, hut, of course, the option still exists to visit more than one place and sample other boulders if it seems feasible and attractive and desirable. They are suggesting additional 500-millimeter photographs, especially if it seems that we can use those to document tracks and sources of docu - of the sampled boulders; for instance, at stations 6 and 7. We are continuing to hold the nominal 47 minutes at station 8 - that is, 8A, and we still think that's as good a place as any to sample the Sculptured Hills. Station 9 is still nominal 30 minutes, but in view of the similarities to the in - to station 4, we're anticipating a possible desirability to remove time from station 10 to enlarge station 9, but that will have to be a real-time decision, based upon what we find at station 9. Station 47 - station 10 continues nominal. We're still interested in sampling the blocks and also interested in - in trenching to try and see - if we can say something about the dark mantle - light area relationship and, perhaps, the nominal coring. We're going to - we're going to deploy EP 5 there; and, other than that, they're basically the same. If we have the time during that closeout, and you'll know if we have enlarged the closeout somewhat, of the LM, based on our experience the last two nights, particularly for dusting; but also, if time permits, in that time we might try and get the - use up the extra double core, if there is one, in the dark mantle near the IM or do some trenching near the IM. But that's only if time permits at the very end, depending upon how the consumables run out. They want to call attention to two particular things here. One, since you guys really haven't gotten any very big rocks so far, they're recommending, they say here, and I quote: "The value of large individual samples has been demonstrated. We recommend that several football-sized samples of a uniform igneous rock be collected at Station 9 or 10." I'll pass that on as that. Another point of interest is the 1- to 20- millimeter size section of the regolith, the dark mantle, the lithology. Then, any observations or collections you can make pertinent to that would be of interest in trying to determine the relationship of the dark mantle to the subfloor units of gabbro underneath. Two short questions which I'll ask, which I hope - hope you can answer in just a very few words. One of them is a yes and no answer. One, we - they can't find the geophone photos specifically called out in the transcript. There is probably a little bit of garble at that point, and the people in the back room will be very happy if you could say once and for all, Jack, that, yes, you did get the geophone photos.

It appears to us from your voice transcript that we weren't fast enough on it at the time that that may be deployed closer to the ALSEP than the one you deployed on the way out. And we'd like an impression on that. And, number 2, you mentioned that you placed it in a depression. We'd like some feeling for that depression in terms of how much of a danger that bomb - charge might play to the AISEP when i t i'oc-j off. If it's in a depression of any sort, thcy'ri' probably pretty well protecting the ALSEP. Any comment on those two questions? Over.</span>

And we ought to try to make sure that we look at a variety of rocks from the North Massif. I think we saw the major rock types on the South Massif yesterday, but we really didn't spend a lot of time ranging along the front there to verify that completely. The other comment on the 1- to 20-millimeter size fraction. There isn't an awful lot of that in the dark mantle. That's one of the striking things about it.</span>
