Okay, before we do anything else here, I guess I better - better hook the old tether on the thing. Okay, tether is on. And she's locked. Okay. It is behind my back? Oh, okay. It's nice and white down here. The UV cover's closed real well. Doesn't seem to be any ... at all on the white face, on the UV or the IR. Everything is in good shape. Looks like part of that - Oh, the cork insulation - chipped off again down here in the corner - in the corner that I'm looking at. Okay, let's try the old cassette.

That's a - Well, that's the way it goes. Hey, it's clearer down here when you take that visor up. I hope I took the outside one. I mean the gold one. No, that's both of them, I think. Better leave it down. There we go. Yes, you take the outside one up a little ways and then you can really see down in the SIM bay. You know, that tape down in here is not scorched one bit. The whole side of the spacecraft is scorched like a son of a gun - but the - you know, the panels, and everything. Man, there's bubbles, you know, on all that silver paint that's on here - is, you know, it used to be kind of a bright-looking silver paint. It looks like - it's in a shadow right now - but it looks like it's just been heated up one way or another. Yes, that's it up here between the SIM bay and the top of the service module. It actually looks like it's been burned, you know. Not just a little bit warm, it's just kind of burned because it's bubbled. Yes. That's what you were seeing from the LM, I'm sure. And - but - as far as I can - it's kind of dark down the other side of the spacecraft - the other side of the SIM bay - but it looks like the thrusters don't make any - hardly any marks on there. Now, I look - I look at quad A - the side of quad A thruster, though, and it's all scorched. So I'm not sure but what that might have been - what in the world could do that? Tower jett, do you suppose? I don't know. Might have. Well, let's take one of these covers off. Oh, this is - like it did in practice. (Laughter) Sticking underneath the door. Looks like I can jerk on it a little harder up here. In practice, I didn't want to break it. There's - a part of the - could you see that one?</span>

Once (Chuckle) - Outstanding - once you get stable in a position, see, I can pretty much hang on with one hand, and I can twist - Oops. Yes, once you start going, it's a son of a gun to try - it's all wrist action. Working - Yes, but once you get stable on the thing, you can kind of relax there, and - Yes... drift, you know, and if I ever bang my foot against - against something, just - just barely touch it, and it bangs right back. And - Hey, America looks really great there. Still got that silver tape on him - or is it blue? Looks silver with this helmet. Let's see, I've got to get over this way farther this time, don't I? Okay. There we go. Hey, I got a picture of the waste water dump from the LM the other day, but it looks the same way now. There's all kinds of little ice particles all around the - the periphery of the dump nozzle itself. It covers up the - well, that kind of gold part that's - that's on the - on the end of the dump nozzle. And then, there are little particles of frozen water, I guess - must be - that are - that are all over - up the side of the spacecraft there, but only in the vicinity of the - the nozzle. It goes up just about to window number 1 - it goes up to window number 1 - well, maybe on up to - no, there's particles all the way up the side of the spacecraft, clear up to the top of the tunnel. But they're real fine. I want to see if they're stuck on there. Hey, you can just touch them, and they blow away. They're just little ice particles.</span>

Depressurization began at Ground Elapsed Time of 257:35. TV turned on shortly after Evans came out. Evans was clear outside the spacecraft at 257:45 approximately 10 minutes after hatch open - or depres-surization I should say. He brought back the lunar sounder film cassette at 257:54. His mean heartrate during this early period of the EVA was running around 139 and 140, and began to taper off as he got more accustomed to this new environment outside the spacecraft. The panoramic camera cassette was retrieved at approximately 258:03 back into the cabin. Mapping camera cassette 258:16. Evans returned to the Command Module at approximately 258:28 the hatch was closed the TV turned off just about 4 minutes prior to the hatch closure. Repressurization began at 258:28 at hatch closure and ended just a few moments ago at 258:44. At this time there is an orbital science briefing which will begin in the main auditorium. The air to ground circuit will be recorded for delayed playback at the conclusion of the lunar orbital science briefing and a followup of that will be the change of shift press conference with the flight director Neil Hutchinson. Now estimated to take place at about 4:30. At 258:48 this is Apollo Control.</span>

Apollo 17, 153,321 nautical miles from Earth, And one of the comments you heard from capcom advising the crew that the fifth of the explosive charges left on the lunar surface at Taurus Littrow had gone off as programed. The detonation occurred almost precisely on time at 260 hours 24 minutes. This is a one and a half or rather a three pound explosive charge located one and a half kilometers east of the lunar rover. And, we appeared to get good seismic data here in the control center. At the present time the crew is still in the eat period, and we've had relatively little conservation from them. It also from the flight plan looks as if we'll have relatively quiet evening. Very few things scheduled between now and the time the crew is to begin their rest period at 267 hours or about 6 hours 15 minutes from now.</span>

San Francisco beat Minnesota, 20 to 17. Miami made it, I guess 14 straight, 16 to 0 over Baltimore. And Buffalo beat Washington, 24 to 7, how about that? Cleveland beat the Jets, 26 to 10. Kansas City beat Atlanta, 17 to 14. Green Bay won over New Orleans, 30 to 20. St. Louis beat Philadelphia in a close one, 24 to 23. Denver beat New England, 45 to 21. Detroit beat the Rams, 34 to 17; and Oakland beat the Bears, 28 to 21. And here's some sad news. The Giants beat Dallas, 23 to 3. And one final score - Cincinnati, 61, Houston, 17. Over.</span>

The exercise that we've been going through with Ron Evans and the antennas aboard the CSM involve an attempt to extend the second of the two elements of the High-Frequency antenna used in the lunar sounder experiment. Each of these elements is about 34 feet 2 inches long. Both together comprising elements of a single antenna. And, one; of the - one of the elements is extended, and the second is balking at extending. Apparently, due to being cold, and the resistance of pushing the antenna out is heating the motor up. Therefore, we have to turn it on for a period of time until the antenna bogs down and the motor begins to heat, and then turn it off to let the motor cool down. In order to assist in getting it out, and you heard CAPCOM Gordon Fullerton advise the crew that it's going out inches at at time, we're backing off a little bit on it to relieve the tension, and then having the crew go forward, and with each of these steps gaining a few inches on getting the antenna extended. Apollo 17 at this time is 151,300 nautical miles from Earth and traveling at a speed of 3,440 feet per second.</span>

Apollo 17 at the present time is 148 900 nautical miles from Earth. This is a quiet period in the Flight Plan for the crew and we have scheduled an exercise period. And following that the crew will be the spacecraft up in the passive thermal control mode, rotating about the longitudinal axis of the spacecraft at about three revolutions per hour. This is done during the trans-lunar and trans-earth phases of the mission to maintain proper thermal equalibrium while the crew is in the sleep period. The crew is scheduled to begin an 8 hour rest period at 267 hours, or about 4 hours from now.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">Jack, I got a quick agricultural explanation of the problem. (Laughter) Evidently, it's the two plates between which the beam itself is suspended are adjustable, so that - by ground command, so that by driving these plates back and forth, they try to center the beam between them. And then the - the data is initiated when the beam vibrates between the plates, it changes capacitance, or at least that's the general principle. And the problem is that by drive, they can command the plates back and forth and stop the stop, but they cannot get the beam to leave - leave one of the plates. It just is hung up against one plate, and this would - could be caused by one of the wires that's suspended - sort of hang the beam, pendulum-fashion, being broken so that it has cockeyed off to one side. I guess that's the best guess as to the malfunction at the moment. It's presently in use as a seismometer returning data in that mode, but useless in its primary intended data-taking mode.

This charge was a 1/8th pound charge located about 65 meters from the Lunar Roving Vehicle, the charge that was closest to the landing site of Apollo 17.

The spacecraft at this time is in the passive thermal control mode, rotating about it's longitudinal axis at the rate of about 3 revolutions per hour to distribute the heating and cooling effects of sunlight on one side and the heatsink of space on the other, and produce uniform heating and cooling within the spacecraft structure.</span>

About an hour and a half ago Jack Schmitt reported what appeared to him as a transitory blink of the spacecraft lights. He asked if we'd seen anything in the telemetry that indicated any sort of a glitch or a problem in the spacecraft electrical system. At that time the EECOM looked at his telemetry displays and said everything appeared to be normal, but to be doubly sure, we had the data, replayed from the receiving site at Madrid where it had been picked up from the spacecraft and looked at the data second by second. Aaron has completed that review, John Aaron, the EECOM, and reports that he saw nothing abnormal during the period of time in question. However, there were a couple of instances where the spacecraft current levels increased or spiked, as they say, by about an amp or two, but this is an increase of 1 or 2 amps out of a total of 78 to 80 some amperes being drawn by the spacecraft at this time, and is not considered abnormal. Gene Cernan reported after Schmitt asked the question that neither he nor Command Module Pilot, Ron Evans had seen the blink in lights that Jack Schmitt reported. Schmitt also allowed as how it may have been a - a figment of his imagination. There is, as we say, no - no explanation for the apparent blink in lights. We see nothing here on the ground that indicates anything abnormal in the spacecraft. Crew also reported that the spacecraft cabin was a bit on the chilly side and we read to them a procedure to increase the cabin temperature. We don't have a direct reading of cabin temperature - we can deduce indirectly what that temperature would be from air inlet temperatures which generally read lower than the cabin temperature itself. The EECOM estimates that the temperature in the cabin has been running somewhere between 68 to 70 degrees - probably in the high sixties, and hopefully beginning to come up a bit now. At the present time Apollo 17 is 145,300 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a speed of 3,600 feet per second now. The crew is scheduled to begin a sleep period at about 267 hours. They've completed the exercise period. Ron Evans, who is on the bio-medical sensors, was exercising and the surgeon reported seeing the - seeing his heart rate rise, indicating that he was exercising.</span>

The CDU glitch that is being discussed, refers to a small piece of - refers to a small piece of erroneous information which appears to have gotten through the CDU. The CDU being the Coupling Data Unit, which is a black box that receives information from various measuring devices on the spacecraft, and converts them to a form that is meaningful to the computer. The CDU or Coupling Data Unit in question, is one that handles this transfer of information from a measuring device, in this case the inertial measurement unit, to the computer. The indications that we've gotten so far from the checks run and the telemetry data that we've looked at, do not show any problem. The essential thing is to understand what the nature of the erroneous information that was fed through this CDU to the computer might be. It's very conceivable that there will be a ready explanation for an erroneous bit of information getting through. If, in fact, there is some problem, and the CDU can be expected to continue feeding erroneous information to the computer, there is a program that can be loaded into the erase-able memory of the computer which in effect allows it to question the information that's fed through and to in effect, make a determination as to whether that information is reasonable. If it's not reasonable, the computer then throws it out. And we now have high bit rate data from the spacecraft so we'll be able to look in great detail at this particular aspect of the guidance system.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">Okay. Let's start with the - the LSPE. All eight charges have now been exploded, and they were all on schedule and produced excellent signals. These data were used in conjunction with the ascent stage lift-off and also its impact data, which should give us an excellent picture of the geologic structure of the outer 3 kilometers of the Moon. This little summary I'm reading right now is - was written by Joel Watkins. The geophone array is functioning beautifully and and we're already talking about its potential in a listening mode for study of meteorite impact frequency. We still don't have precise EP locations from Ray Batson, so the following interpretation will almost certainly be changed when we get better data and field tapes, which we will use to refine our arrival times. Bearing the above in mind, my preliminary interpretation is as follows. The low-velocity layer seems to be thicker and higher in velocity than at either Apollo l4 or 16 sites. I think this may mean that the low-velocity layer here includes dark mantle material as well as the regolith. Details of the higher velocity substrate are fuzzy, but velocities increase with depth in a way which would be consistent with a thick accumulation of lava flows. This probably represents the subfloor material. And he concludes by saying, "You guys did a great job, see you after splash." On the same subject, Dr. Kovach went a little further, and he just recently admits to seeing evidence of two high-velocity layers, especially after the 6-pound charge was fired, that - that evidence showed up. He also mentions in - mentioned in his press conference yesterday that the - the data point allowed by the - the ascent-stage impact was - was very important - the fact that they - they got it in about 9 kilometers away and the - that data is right in a critical range where - where they see a big change in the - the percentage of - velocity change. I'm getting kind of balled up here in the words, but that data is very important because it's in - where the steep gradient of velocity change occurs. On looking through here, I guess, in - in summary, I'll read a couple of sentences again out of the press conference. We do find evidence of lunar crust as we did in the past, but we may have to thin it considerably. We may have, in fact, have to thin it as much as to 25 kilometers instead of 60 - that they believed it was up until now. And they're thinking they may have to lower the velocity of seismic ways - waves in the mantle, which, I guess, at last guess was around 9 kilometers per second. Now it's looking more like 7-5, and the crustal velocity is probably as low as 6.3 kilometers per second. Okay, yes. That was - that last data was really from Dr. Latham, and he was interpreting that data mainly from the S-IVB impact, reading from some of the other seismic sites. Any questions on that? I realize that this is pretty ragged. Over.</span>

It's stabilizing out and, at the present time, they show about a degree centigrade per meter gradient. Apollo 15 is stabilized at about 1.8, and it looks like the 17 site's headed for about the same, which gives consistent data for the two sites. It looks like that's what is going to result when it's reached its final equilibrium. And so that - if you call that - those two sites typical of the Moon, then that leads one to the following conclusions; that that data requires that there be a total greater abundance of radioactive isotopes in the Moon as compared to the Earth, so there would be an implication here for a fundamental difference in the composition between the two. And the higher number of isotopes would in turn require that they be located very near the surface, implying substantial differentiation of the material, at least compositionally or stratisfactionally [sic]. It's not necessary that it had have to be stratified. It was only required that it be stratified in most of - in that most of the isotopes be concentrated in the upper layers of the Moon. I guess that's about what we've got on the heat flow at the present time. Over.</span>

At about 65 centimeters, the temperature drops to 254, and that's the lowest temperature we see. Below that depth, the temperature begins to increase again, and it's 257 at the bottom of the probes.

                <span class="spokenwords">Roger. Okay, the TGE has produced some - fair amount of excitement around here - and interest. The instrument really worked beautifully. It had some baro switches that turned it on for temperature control - right aft - right during lift-off - and so it had 3 days to stabilize before you got to Taurus-Littrow. And on landing, the bias measurement showed that the bias shift was extremely small, so they feel that they had a very accurate reading on all the readings. And I mentioned the other night that the number they got for the gravity field at the landing site should allow them to actually revise the value for the radius of the Moon at the landing site. But then you asked me about some of the variations in reading around the valley there. Well, it turns out that - if you call the landing site zero on the scale of milli-gals and then take the differences from the landing site, over at the South Massif, you have a minus 36; in other words, a lesser amount of gravity. And all these numbers, by the way, are corrected only for elevation, and there are some more sophisticated corrections to - to be put on them. But the - with - correcting for elevation, you have a 36-milligal negative anomaly at the South Massif. And the number at the North Massif was a minus 26. And there is very little difference, within a milligal or so, between the North Massif and the Sculptured Hills site. But you can see that there's a significant difference between the landing site and the foothills on both sides. The Shorty Crater showed a slight positive anomaly compared to the landing site, but it's less than a milligal, which is sort of - you start to think "Well, that means a localized volcanic center," but it's - nobody's really going out that far on a limb. The - they were especially appreciative of the 2A stop, which was - let's see - well, it verified the extremely sharp gradient of the anomalous condition from the foothills as you go back into the valley. The 2A stop - I'm trying to find the number here - Okay, went from minus 36 at Station 2 to a minus 29 at 2A, so it's - it really changes quickly as you get away from the - the mountains. Okay, he summar - summarized his feelings by saying that "the negative gravity anomalies which were measured right at the South Massif and the North Massif clearly indicate that the valley is filled with a higher density of material than the material which makes up the massif so that if the material underlying the floor at Taurus-Littrow - say, is basaltic in composition and has a density of about 3, the material which makes up the massif has a substantially lower density." He goes on to say that we're not sure exactly what the density difference is, but if it's as large as 20 percent difference, then the material in the floor of the valley and the - well, the thickness of the high-density material in the valley has to be on the order of about 1-1/2 kilometers thick. So that's a - I guess that's a minimum thickness, assuming the greatest difference in densities.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">Yes. They're really - everything is really tied in the original theories on the structure and makeup of the valley. Everything seems to be falling right in there, and that's what has - has the whole crowd of scientists around here really smiling. Let's see - let me find out what's next here. Okay. It was Strangway's turn next, and he didn't have any results to present, of course, because he's got to get the tape back first, really. However, the orbital sounder - the command module sounder - when they made the pass across the site with the transmitter on - No, I got it backwards. When it was in a listening mode, listening to the ground transmitter's signals, they found that the signal was in exactly the frequency range that it was supposed to be, and they - they picked up the - exactly the right sequence rate, once every 0.8 second. And when they calculated the power levels, that we were putting out just exactly the 1 watt that we were expected to put out. So that - that everything looks good as far as the operation of the transmitter, and without going into all the details which you know as well as I do about the thermal problems on the receiver, they're still - well, he sums it up, we have no reason yet to be sweating it too badly. They're very hopeful that when the tape gets back, we'll have good data on at least some of the legs, and they're - they're waiting for you to bring it to them. Dick Kruse is here, and he mentioned that all your pains, Geno, in brushing dust off of it probably saved the day. If it's there, it was just due to that, that it did work, because it was really on the ragged edge here.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">This is Apollo Control at 266 hours 17 minutes. The crew at the present time is establishing the spacecraft in its passive thermal control mode. This is rotating at about 3 revolutions per hour for thermal control which means that they're preparing to get some sleep. Sleep period is scheduled to begin at 267 hours and the PTC or passive thermal control mode is the normal set up for the spacecraft to maintain thermal equalibrium during a sleep period. The crew had reported a possible glitch as they referred to it with the CDU or coupling data unit about an hour ago at 265 hours 7 minutes. We looked in great detail at the telemetry data and replayed data from the time when this glitch occured, and by looking at the data, have confirmed that there is no problem with the coupling data unit, and the guidance and navigation system which it forms a part of. To summarize the sequence of events, Gene Cernan was in the process of loading numbers into the spacecraft computer, telling it to maneuver to the proper attitude for passive thermal control, when he noticed that his eight-ball attitude indicator and his computer attitude readout disagreed. These 2 readouts if everything is as it should be, should be in very close agreement. Noting disagreement there, he advised that there was a possible glitch in the CDU or coupling data unit which feeds information from the inertial measurement unit to the computer. The glitch being possibly that the CDU was feeding erroneous information to the computer. If this was in fact the case, the computer knowledge of the spacecraft attitude would become impaired. It would have been possible to work around this sort of problem if it were a transient problem. This would have been done by loading a program into the computer erasable memory which in effect would tell the computer to disregard imputs which were unlikely or unreasonable. As it turned out, Gene Cernan came up with the explanation for the glitch. He suggested that he may have loaded the incorrect numbers into the computer when he was asking the - or telling the computer to maneuver to a new attitude. Rather than telling the computer to maneuver to a new attitude, by punching in the wrong numbers, he in effect told it - that's it's attitude numbers were incorrect and that it should load a new set of attitude numbers which the computer proceeded to do. And at the same time, the next time that he looked at and compared the eight-ball with the computer, he of course, found that they didn't agree. We were able to confirm that this in fact had happened by replaying data, looking at the numbers that were fed into the computer second by second and sure enough just as Cernan had suggested, a wrong series of numbers had been inadvertently loaded. The computer had done precicely what it was told to do and the indication of an error from the coupling data units was displayed. Making a long story short, the coupling data units are functioning precisely as they should and there's no problem with the guidance aid navigation system. Cernan, I'm sure, a bit chragrived at a procedurel error but as with everyone on the ground, relieved that a potentially significant problem turned out to be no problem at all.</span>

A reminder also, prior to going to sleep, to burnp the cabin up to 5.7 with the OPS to start getting the gas out of the OPS. And I checked with the remaining two homefronts, Jack. Your - I talked to your mother and sister. Everybody's fine there, and they watched the top of your head a little bit this afternoon on the EVA.

On the comm carrier, there's a whole bunch of wires, about eight of them - looks like they're twisted pairs, you, know, twisted in fours really. They come up through the thing. And two of those eight wires are cut - are broken in two. The hot end, or the end that comes up from the plug going toward the headset - those two wires both come out individually and individually taped, each one of them. And then the whole group - you know, I bent them out of the way so they wouldn't be touching anything. So they wouldn't touch insulation or tape. I bent them out of the way and taped the whole side of it just to keep the rest of them from breaking in two, and it looks like a pretty good fix on the thing, really. However, if you have any concern about blowing the audio panel, I'll just go ahead and wear the lightweight headset.</span>

Yes, the concern here is not only which wires they are - the potential does exist if one of those shorts to ground to blow the audio panel or at least a circuit breaker, depending upon which wire it is. I gather that what you've done - is that you haven't wired the broken wires back together, but it's just sort of covered the bare leads and wired them out of the way. is that right?</span>

It's been a quiet night. All spacecraft systems continuing to perform very well. The spaceflight meteorology group with National Weather Service said a short time ago that weather conditions are expected to be satisfactory for the landing and recovery of Apollo 17 crew and spacecraft tomorrow. The weather forecast for the planned landing area, which is located approximately 360 nautical miles southeast of Pango Pango, calls for partly cloudy skies, widely scattered rain showers, variable winds of 10 miles per hour, seas of 3 feet and a temperature of near 80 degrees.

                <span class="spokenwords">Well, I guess that we all assume maybe you're like the rest of us and turn to your sport page first sometimes. So we thought we'd recap the pro football action yesterday, in a rather strange day, since there were only - only two games that really made any difference. And I think the scores kind of showed the day. In the American Conference playoff games coming up next weekend, Oakland will play at Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh getting into the playoffs for the first time in 40 years. The Cleveland Browns will take on the undefeated Miami Dolphins, who have won 14 straight. In the National Conference, Dallas will be at San Francisco Saturday, and Green Bay plays at Washington on Sunday. Quickly recapping some of the scores from yesterday. On that sad, sad one here in Houston, Cincinnati rolled over the Oilers, 61 to 17. There were three touchdowns scored in the fourth quarter within less than 5 minutes of play, all on interceptions - on - the part of Cincinnati. New York Giants, it says, upset Dallas 23 to 3. I question the upset since Dallas was already in the playoffs; and, in what I watched, it looked like they were aware that they were already in the playoffs. Buffalo upset Washington 24, - 17. And again it's a questionable upset because O. J. Simpson had a great day, and Larry Brown from Washington was kept on the bench for the whole game. Oakland, 28, over Chicago, 21; Detroit, 34, over Los Angeles, 17. Los Angeles' hopes for any playoff berth had been knocked out by San Francisco's win on Saturday, and it looked like they played that way on Sunday. Cleveland, in a real tough one up in New York with 30-knot winds and a - gale - gale-force winds and lots of snow and cold, defeated New York Jets, 26 to 10. Green Bay, 30, over New Orleans, 20, in a tough one, which saw two - two touchdowns being scored off of blocked punts. Kansas City, 17, over Atlanta, 14. And, again, Atlanta's chances for a playoff berth had been wiped out on Saturday; and, apparently, they played that way on Sunday. Denver, 45, over New England, 21; St. Louis, 24, over Philadelphia, 23. Pittsburgh defeated San Diego 24 to 2. On Saturday Miami had taken Baltimore 16 to nothing, and as I previously mentioned, San Francisco defeated Minnesota on Saturday 20 to 17. Just one little note, Jack, you might be interested in this mornings paper, concerning the New Orleans Saints. One of the - Dave Parks from the New Orleans Saints, announced his retirement, and he kind of took a rap at the Saints in claiming that they were a team that did not want to win, and that he was retiring unless they would trade him to a winner. It sounds like our friend over there might have some problems this winter come contract time. In pro basketball last night, the Houston Rockets beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 110 to 109. Jack Marin had 35 points, Mike Newlin had 34. In college basketball, UCLA remains number one in the latest ratings. Second ranked Florida State was beaten this weekend by Princeton, 61 to 59, Third ranked Maryland won, as did fourth-ranked Marquette, fifth-ranked Minnesota and number six, North Carolina State. Indiana is rated 15th, Houston is 16th. We can't find Purdue, Kansas or Cal Tech in the ratings right now. There's one bowl game tonight. Iowa State, who has taken a 5 game losing streak into the Liberty Bowl, will meet: Georgia Tech at Memphis, Tennessee. In local hockey, the Aeros and the Los Angeles Sharks of the World Hockey Association, battled to a 4-4 tie.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">Now, for page 1 news. The outlook for a quick peace settlement in Vietnam has taken an apparent turn for the worse. The Hanoi government radio announced last night that U.S. planes have dropped more mines in Haiphong harbor and has also carried out bombing and rocket attacks on the city of Haiphong. There was no immediate comment from Washington on the charges. The snag in the Paris peace talks apparently hinges on a few key points, according to press association reports. Among them, the North Vietnamese will not accept the idea of two separate Vietnamese states and the method of policing a truce, the two-Vietnam policy being the major stumbling block. The weather here is making news. Yesterday's reading at Intercontinental Airport was a frigid 22 degrees. Downtown Houston was 32. The airport reading was the lowest since 1932. Up north in the upper Midwest and northeast, it's going to be a white Christmas, and more snow is moving into the area. Chicago had a low of 5 above Sunday; Kansas City, 19; and Albuquerque, 18. Anne Armstrong, long a power in Texas Republican politics, is reportedly about to be named to a high post in the Nixon administration. Harry Truman still clings to life. The 88-year-old Presi - 88-year-old former President is holding his own, according to his doctors. Debris found floating in the Gulf of Mexico off the west coast of Florida has been identified as that of a Coast Guard Helicopter that crashed. Earlier the chopper had rescued four fishermen from a sinking shrimp trawler. The helicopter was headed back to Saint - Saint Petersburg when it went down with the four fishermen and the crew of four. It's a lot safer up there where you are than on the Texas highways. The State Highway Patrol reported a high number of serious accidents on Texas roads this weekend. A Houston newspaper reports that industrial demand for Trinity River system water will not produce enough money to finance the project and that the City of Houston's water and industrial district funds will have to make up the difference. Meanwhile, the Clear Lake City Water Authority is tossing around a proposal that would require developers to pay 50 percent of the cost of all lateral water and sewer lines. Up around Conroe, in Montgomery County, a transformer blew up Sunday morning and electrical power went out for several hours. Several thousand homes were affected. Baytown was the scene of four armed robberies Sunday. Four business establishments were hit in a l4-minute period. The masked gunmen got about $500 cash. No one was injured. And a final note, today in history, actress Betty Grable is 56 years old. That's from your news editor, Jim Kukowski.</span>

Spacecraft at the present time is 114,147 nautical miles away from the Earth, approaching at a velocity of 4,600 feet per second. Rather quiet work day for the crew of Apollo 17. Earlier in the day the morning news was read up to the crew after they were wakened by two different musical selections. One of which was recorded yesterday in the Evans home by some neighbors who had come in. And the first one was a rendition of "We've Just Begun" by The Carpenters. The singing group Carpenters, that is. At 278:01 Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.</span>

Let me just record on the tape my impression of these light flashes as they occurred around the Moon and at other times. In general, they've all been essentially - just a - as - as it says - a flash, with a - with a little bit of a glow, and usually in one eye or the other eye. And for some reason, most generally, they've been kind of - if you - you'd almost say it's in - it's in the periphery of your vision, because you get the feeling that maybe there was a flash over to the left or down to the right or something like that. But you don't get a distinct impression as to where the flash came from. Well, you can - you can see where it came from, but not - you can't see the flash itself. Like it was just beyond your vision. Most of them have been like that. At one time and one time only throughout the flight, I can remember kind of a triple flash, so to speak. And in that case, there was a bright flash in the left eye on - on - about 10 o'clock in the left eye. And then it repeated itself again about 2 o'clock in the left eye. And then about, oh, 10 o'clock, a quarter of the way out, in the right eye. I just got a bing, bing, bing, just like that. Three - three of them right in a row. And the rest of the time, though, they've all essentially been single flashes to me.</span>

I guess the best summation I can make of that is I think I saw both lines and - and the spots or the flashes a little bit more sharply, but that might be because of the adaptation - dark adaptation in the LM prior to going to sleep was probably a little bit better. And I'd guess - it's awful hard to tell time when you're under - when it's dark, ... but I guess I want to say they were quite frequent, and I'd say that means two to three a minute now. That could be way out, but that's what I'd guess.</span>

As usual in these inflight news conferences, the questions that will be asked of you were prepared by correspondents covering the Apollo 17 mission at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston. They will be read exactly as written and in the order determined by the newsmen. The first question is for Jack Schmitt. If you, as a geologist, were coming home from a field trip on Earth, you'd be drafting a preliminary report and discussing it with fellow geologists. In terms understandable to laymen, can you summarize what you would be saying in your preliminary report about your field trip to Taurus-Littrow?</span>

                <span class="afjwho">LMP</span>
                <span class="spokenwords">Well, I'll - I'll give that a try, Gordy. I think the thing we had hoped to accomplish at Taurus-Littrow was to look at a - as broad a spectrum of the history of the Moon as possible in one small area, as the concluding flight to the Apollo Program. And I think we did that. I think we had look - did look at some of the oldest rocks that it is possible to see with our capability in the breccias of the South and North Massifs. I think we saw some intermediate-age rocks of fairly unexpected character, I believe, in the subfloor crystalline or igneous rocks, the gabbro, as we called them there. And we also understood, I think, that those rocks, in fact, had intruded into the breccias of the North Massif. We found, I believe, in the - at the Crater Van Serg, on the third EVA, that the regolith, or the garden zone, on the top of that subfloor gabbro, or the igneous rocks, was quite thick, or appears to be very thick, which is an expected result, and will - hopefully, those rocks will have much information about a fairly extended period of lunar erosion. And, we found that there was indeed a dark mantle over the area of - variable thickness; but, apparently, of relatively recent age, and that in turn had a light mantle of material of which we do not yet understand, and I think that the samples are going to have to tell that story. It may well be a land slide that has come off the South Massif. And, then, possibly as important as any finding, we found that even later than that relatively young light mantle deposit are avalanche - possible avalanche - we have alteration reminiscent of the alteration by hot waters or hot gases on Earth, and that was the orange - appears to be the orange soil that we found around the Crater Shorty. And, subsequently, in orbit we started to pick up, and particularly through Ron Evans' efforts, pick up more and more of the apparent evidence of such alteration taking place in fairly recent time on the Moon. All of those items, I think, are extremely significant and go through the full range of our present knowledge of lunar history. And, a report I would write would initially summarize that particular sequence of events.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">Well, they don't necessarily have to be volcanic, Gordy. I refer to them as alteration, and much of the hydrothermal, or hot water, alteration we see on Earth is related to recent volcanism, or ancient volcanism; but, also, we know of that kind of alteration of preexisting materials to take place as a result of - of just fluids working their way up through the Earth's crust, and I presume that such a process is also possible on the Moon. The ones we saw seem to be associated with areas of dark mantle, of various types, and most of the photographic evidence we have is that those dark mantle deposits are associated with volcanism, but it is not necessarily proved yet, I believe, that the - the orange soils or the alterations we've seen are volcanic. However, the process would be a related process, that is, one of internal origin.</span>

Why do you think you were able to see so much orange material from lunar orbit, after your partners had found some on the ground, where none of the previous Apollo crews reported seeing anything but grays, tans, and browns?</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">Well, I think, for one thing, that we were in, essentially, a different orbit than some of the other crews that had been up there before. And even though each of us has a color tone in our own eyes, what we come up with, I think, is a function pretty much of what you'd like to believe and what you'd like to see out of things. If you feel it has a tint of orange with it, and this is in a new area that we really haven't flown over that much, and this is primarily - where we were seeing this type of thing was on the western rim of Serenitatis, and some of the - well, at least it looks like known volcanic deposits along the rim of Serenitatis.</span>

That leads you to see things. Now that's not seeing things that are not there. It makes you look for things that are there, and that's extremely important; and that's where the kind of training all three of us have had and I think has made it possible for us to find a lot of things that might not otherwise have been found.</span>

I - it's an opportunity - Well, to me I guess it was an opportunity to be what I call a "real space man." And - you're out there in the deepness of space, with nothing there but your spacesuit on, and you're doing the job that has to be done. And we're riding around in space out here, and this is in a capsule and we look out the window, you know, but it's nice firm feeling. It's a solidly built vehicle, and you get the zero g effect on the thing, but you don't get the feeling of - really getting out and walking in space. And once I became accustomed to what it was like in the EVA environment, then you relax and you take it easy, you try to accomplish what you can and observe what you can and really enjoy it.

                <span class="spokenwords">When we look back at the Apollo Program I don't think anyone can privately to themselves and publicly say that this isn't truly indeed really a beginning - a beginning of man's really first venture out into deep space. And once there's a beginning, there's a continuation. The probing into deep space by man, the next landing on the Moon, a trip to Mars may not be for 10 years, a decade; it may not be until the end of this century. But I personally have faith that it will happen. I think it's a restraint, an abnormal restraint of man's intellect at this point in time to restrict or tend to think that he will restrict his own feeling of exploration, his own quest for knowledge. He's had an opportunity. He's proved that he could take advantage of this opportunity, and I think that the nature of mankind is going to just press on. That's why I believe not - we of Apollo 17 - yes, it's a beginning; but the whole Apollo Program is really the true beginning of what's to come in the future. And I firmly believe that. We can look back in a 100 years or 200 years and the 5-year or 10-year period of time, we may be slowed down here. I think we'll be - we'll be lost in the merit of what is really accomplished during the next several decades.</span>

The American people seem to be getting fairly blase about space flight and television coverage of Apollo 17 has been at a minimum. But this is not the case abroad. For example, in the Republic of Zaire, the former Belgian Congo, an estimated 20 million people are watching extensive coverage on TV sets set up in the villages. What do you have to say to the people of underdeveloped nations?</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">Well, Gordy, first of all, I'm not sure that the amount of television coverage is necessarily a measure of the interest of the American people. I don't have those figures at hand. I'm sorry to hear that the adventures we had and the insight that maybe we gained into not only ourselves, but to the history of the solar system was not shared extensively with the American people, if that's true. As far as the rest of the world is concerned, and also the people of the United States who may not participate as much in the affluence that we all would like to share, I think that's what space flight in general and the Apollo Program in particular has offered, is many new avenues from which we can provide for those people abroad and for our own people, the kind of quality of life and the material - including the material quality of life that everybody aspires to. I think, we've just begun the adventure of understanding how - what we've learned and how we've learned to do it in space can be applied to these particular kinds of problems. That is one of the great challenges that I think NASA and other agencies within the United States Government and other governments abroad have, is to use this base of technological information now for their own people.</span>

But, a point I tried to get across, several days earlier in this flight, is that the real promise of the future for all the peoples of the Earth is to weld themselves into a coherent group of people who can live and work together and then enjoy all the benefits and all the knowledge that is to come from future space explorations. I think we are doing this not just as Americans but as human beings and everyone throughout these countries throughout the world who are watching us right now are also human beings no different than we are.

I think that the most important thing that maybe I have done is to - to be able to show that we can build a transportation system that allows you to fly people of a wide variety of disciplines.

But, I've watched a lot of people work on a lot of spacecraft, and I'm very proud to be able to say that all the vehicles that have been associated with Apollo 17 have been outstanding.

I personally believe that those prayers played no small part in any success that we were able to achieve on this flight. I ask those people, however, to continue their prayers in particular for some of our friends and some of our comrades who are still in southeast Asia - POWs, MIAs who may not - although God willing I hope they will - but who may not have the opportunities to get home and enjoy the Christmas that we're looking forward to. And with that from Apollo 17 spacecraft America on December 18, 1972, we all wish you a very, very Merry Christmas and a happy holiday season. Godspeed and God bless you all.</span>

At the present time in mission control we've got a group of engineers, from the crew systems division, clustered around the capcom console going over a set of recommended procedures which capcom Gordon Fullerton will be discussing with Ron Evans for fixing his communications carrier, the so called Snoopy hat, that the crew wears that has the earphones and microphone attachments built in. Evans reported several days ago that the comm carrier - communications carrier was intermittant and last night he took it apart looked inside and found that in fact a couple of wires had broken and made a temporary fix. The procedures that we'll be reading up to him are to ensure that in so far as possible that the Snoopy hat communications carrier is fixed up to work properly during entry. If for some reason the Snoopy hat carrier couldn't be used Evans would plan to wear the light weight headset using the Snoopy hat to hold it in position but the preferable arrangement during entry would be to have a working comm carrier built into the Snoopy hat. Apollo 17 at this time is 93,270 nautical miles from Earth. And the speed is 5,444 feet per second.</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">Okay. Geno mentioned that you'd already essentially taped the electronic part to your Snoopy hat. I guess, first of all, we're suggesting that you rig - rig this up for Jack, and let you have the good one just to be sure. And I'll - I'll quickly run through the steps we have. I think maybe this will be the easiest way. And you can then listen and if you've done it already or if you - if this mentions something that you haven't thought of, it'll at least accomplish the job. They have about 15 steps here, but I don't think it'll take long to summarize it. They suggest taking the headband off the lightweight headset; in other words, taking the electronic part off the headband, straighten the mike boom, and straighten the - the comm carrier boom, the appropriate one for whichever ear Jack wears his molded earpiece in, then rotate the lightweight headset mike boom 90 degrees. They found that was necessary to get it to face your mouth when - when you end up with this all taped on there. You have to sort of twist it, force it 90 degrees. Then lay the lightweight headset boom along the comm carrier boom with the electronic part on the outside of your - your earpiece on the Snoopy hat. And the - the hose that goes to the molded earpiece facing downward coming out down and with the - the mike boom 1 inch beyond the comm carrier mike boom tip. And then tape the two booms together for the entire length of the comm carrier boom. And then rebend the whole works back so that the tip is back in front of your mouth. And then tape the electronics box onto the side of the earpiece, and you can run tape all the way around the lower part of the earpiece, and you can lift up on the leather-covered doughnuts on the inside there, pull that loose and then run tape underneath. Just pull the lower part of it loose, run tape all the way around to really securely anchor the electronics box to the outside of the - the earpiece so there's no chance that that will slip off or shift. Then you can kind of push the leather earseal back down on top of the tape inside. Let's see. Then - -</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">Okay. Then take the comm carrier electrical lead and double it back on itself, and - and tape it together so that it doesn't flop around. And now you've got it essentially set up. I - I've lost my place here on the sequence. Just a second. Okay. Place the molded earpiece - Well, actually, one further modification was then to run the - the hose, which is now external, up underneath the leather doughnut and out through the ear opening, and - and pull it on through. Now you - to put this all on, you'll have to stick the molded earpiece in your ear and then as you pull the Snoopy on, sort of pull the slack out of the - the audio hose there so you don't end up with a lot of hose coiled up in the earcup. And the - the remaining hose then just sort of dangles down beside your neck. Fasten the chinstrap, and make sure that the hose isn't pinched or - anywhere. Readjust the mike boom to a half inch from your - in front of your lips, and make sure one of the foam parts of the mike boom is facing your mouth. Okay. Then you just route the - the electrical lead and the - the plug on down through the slot and ICG, and put - put all the excess length of the connectors and the - the excess stuff down inside the ECG [sic] so it doesn't flop around, and of course mate the pins, the connectors, and snap the ICG closed at the front to be sure that it'll capture. One thing they did try in this configuration is - was - was to see if you could get the helmet on over all that, in case a suited reentry became necessary at short notice, and it does go on. Randy Hester tried it. And with just a little cocking of the head, you can get the helmet on over. How's that sound to you?</span>

During the night, the Flight Dynamics Officer and the Retro Return to Earth Officer will be compiling their last stretch of tracking data on the spacecraft and computing the final midcourse correction which would be performed at about 3 hours prior to entry. At the present time that midcourse correction would appear to be very small, around 2 feet per second.

                <span class="spokenwords">Okay. It's some more like human interest stuff rather than pure news. One thing the - in the Liberty Bowl football game Georgia Tech beat Iowa State. Well, I guess it's not quite over yet - this is a fourth quarter score, Georgia Tech 315 Iowa State 24. And, there is a story about the Moonship that's streaking smoothly homeward. There's nothing in it that you don't know about, though, except maybe one little part of the article describing a quote from William E. Fastie of Johns Hopkins University, member of the Orbital Science Team, who said that a rather startling discovery is the Moon is simply not degassing. It has nothing left in terms of anything that you think - that can create an atmosphere. Much to his surprise, even the amount of hydrogen, an element that should have been the most abundant outgassing candidate, turned out to be about 1 percent of its predicted value. He speculated that the absence of a planetary magnetic field on the Moon works to the purge surface of any atmospheric accumulation. The atoms of gases that have vented to the surface, he theorized, pick up an electrical charge then - and are then swept away by the solar wind, which is a stream of electrified atoms pushing far out into the solar system of the Sun. Former President Truman is stabilized is the word they are using now. His heart condition is unchanged. His kidneys are failing him, and he's termed to be still in a very serious condition but resting comfortably. A declining birth rate and a desire for fewer children in the years ahead have caused the census bureau to reduce sharply its estimates of future population growth in the United States. By the year 2000, for example, the estimate is now 20 million fewer people than had been forecast on the basis of previous statistics. Reduction could have major implications for American society in many areas. And it reflects changes in birth and child planning, which now suggest that the U.S. may eventually reach zero population growth. The last one is pretty interesting, and more so if you can see the picture that goes with the story, about James L. G. Fitzpatrick who for 40 years has been interested in copying natural flight. And he has now designed a batlike flying machine that may be ready for a test run next summer. Fitzpatrick said that the first - that first, every small part of the ungainly structure must be tested carefully. Otherwise you end up either in a disaster or a grave, and we try to avoid that sort of thing. After three decades of trying, Fitzpatrick, who's 66, believes his latest device comes closest to the real thing, although it still needs a small motor to flap the wings. Asked whether his device, as yet unnamed, works on the flight principle of a bird, he said, "I don't know anyone who knows what principle a bird works on, but I guess this is more like a bat of a pterodactyl. Fitzpatrick's ornithopter or flapping wing airplane is equipped with cockpit controls that include a throttle that regulates the 1-horsepower engine and up-and-down flight. Other equipment includes rudder pedals to regulate a power steering system, a parking brake, a pseudopaddagieum, I don't know what that one - that word is, it's a new one on me, to transfer power from the engine to the wings, and a two-way radio. It has a maximum 40-foot wingspan and weighs 320 pounds. It is 6 feet long and it looks like a cage of scaffolding covered in parts by canvas. He said he's far enough along on building his device that he will be able to test the way the wings move in the Staten island Community College gym by the first of the year. However, there will be no free flying. The gymnasium test will involve tying weights to the wing tips and flapping the wings. He said that his bird is rather slow in maturing; and it's been a long gestation period which involved 9000 hours of experimentation, $40,000 in his money, and the dissection of 300 birds of various species. "I've been interested in flight since 1930," he said. "Basically, I was curious as to why various things flew, and I've been painfully finding out ever</span>

                <span class="spokenwords">It'll take them awhile to cue it up, and maybe we'll work on that. Let me give you guys a few items here while you're thinking. Number 1, the old weather report: 2000 scattered - high scattered - 10 miles visibility, 3-foot seas, winds are out of the east at 10 knots. Just about exactly what you had yesterday, and probably what we've been telling you for 2 or 3 days. Looks like we're going to have a midcourse 7 this morning, about 2 feet per second. Pretty much just to really center us in the corridor. We're already within the corridor now, with no problems. We're going to exit PTC at a different roll angle. We'll read that up to you later when you get the Flight Plan out; but just so you don't go ahead and exit early, we will be sending you something up on that exit PTC to new roll angle. And as far as the LEVAs are concerned, you guys were looking for a place to stow those last night, and what we're suggesting is putting them in the sleep restraint on top of A-8 where you've got one suit stowed, apparently. And we're suggesting you put one of those on the helmet on that PGA. And the other one, as it were, loose and in the bag. Over.</span>
