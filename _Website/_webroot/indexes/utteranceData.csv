-023722|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control, we're at T minus 1 hour 22 minutes and counting. Cabin purge has now been completed and the boost protective cover has been closed. The 65 percent nitrogen 35 percent oxygen mixture will now be enriched to a 60/40 mixture at liftoff. Just completed were some preflight command tests with the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston. These tests are to insure that Houston can send commands, and that they are being received on or by the launch vehicle. Also just completed was a first motion signal. This is the first motion of the vehicle as it lifts off the pad. A test signal is sent to the eastern test range and to the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston to assure that they will get this signal at liftoff. Also, we just received a final go for a Jimsphere release. The Jimsphere is a weather balloon which is the final weather balloon to go up before launch indicating the wind direction. C-band beacons are in check at this time. The C-band beacons aboard the launch vehicle are used in tracking. They give indications of range velocity during the power phase of flight. Q-ball sim command was just sent. The Q-ball is an angle-of-attack meter which is perched above the launch escape system, and it's read by the spacecraft commander in the spacecraft. It would indicate any deviation from the planned flight through. It reads zero as it sits on the pad and during the test a simulated command is sent to it, and Gene Cernan in the spacecraft reads off what he is reading in the spacecraft during that sim command. The checks in the spacecraft continue to run somewhat ahead of schedule. The spacecraft test conductor Skip Chauvin indicated their running ahead and looking good, to which Cernan replied, "we're looking good up here too." The countdown continuing to move along well at this time T minus 1 hour 21 minutes and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-022741|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control, 13 minus 1 hour 12 minutes and counting. At this time Spacecraft Commander Gene Cernan and the Spacecraft test conductor Skip Chauvin are going over some command checks. During these checks the Spacecraft Commander actually gimbles or moves, swings the main engine in the Service Module. He does this using his flight hand controller and this is a system which is done so that if there is a problem with the computer which normally flies these, he can take over and manually fly it. Normally, however, all burns of this engine are done by the computer. Out at the pad, the space vehicle is surrounded by searchlights producing some 225 foot candles of light, a total of 7220 kilowatt xenon lights and 260 kilowatt xenon searchlight banks provide this illumination. At liftoff, approximately 7500 foot candles will be produced from the flame of the Saturn V first stage engines. This is almost equivalent to daylight. Searchlight will also illuminate the Apollo 17 for the first 60 feet of it's flight. Our countdown continuing to go smoothly now as we approach the 1 hour mark. T minus 1 hour 11 minutes and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-021533|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're at T minus 1 hour and counting. T minus 1 hour and counting. Just completed were the C-band beacon checks. These are checks of the beacons, two of them aboard the instrument unit of the space vehicle. These are used in conjunction with C-band radar here at Kennedy Space Center to check the space vehicle during powered phase of flight. A check was just made with the superintendent of range operations who ran through the camera coverage looking at the weather around the various areas to see what camera coverage, and that appears to be satisfactory. Meanwhile, at the pad, the closeout crew has completed securing the white room area, and they are clearing the pad area themselves at this time. Just before they left, they indicated to Cernan that they were completed their jobs going back away from the pad area. Cernan said "We'll see you when we get back." The pad leader responded that "The next face you see had better be a frogman or you're in trouble." The weather appears to be satisfactory. We've been tracking some local buildups, but at this time they're just - they do not seem to be posing any problem for an on-time launch at 9:53 p.m. EST. Now, T minus 59 minutes, 32 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-021031|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We are at T-55 minutes 54 seconds and counting. Stoney, astronaut Bob Parker, the capsule communicator here in the firing room who has a variety of of functions during this mission; one of which is to set the elevators at the 320 foot level. He actually commands the elevators which are part of the egress system, emergency egress system, for the astronauts. He has just reported that the elevators have now been set at the 320 foot level. In an emergency the crew could come out of their spacecraft into these elevators where they would be lowered at a high speed, 600 feet per minute, to the ground floor or A level floor where they can exit from there into a variety of escape modes; one of which would be down a chute into a blast danger area or a safety area, or they could continue on out and be picked up by armored carriers. Underway at this time with the launch vehicle are some checks of the secure range safety systems aboard the vehicle. These are actually checks of the receivers in that system. A range Safety Officer could terminate the flight of Apollo 17 if it became erratic by initiating emergency cut off, or if necessary a propellant dispersion command. These systems are located on each of the flight stages. There are three stages of the Saturn V. Two receivers in each stage, and they would receive a signal from the range safety officers and then sending through them, through these receivers, they could perform the propellant dispersion. These actions, of course, will be taken only if the vehicle were so erratic that it were endangering some land areas, and of course, only after the crew had used one of the escape options open to them. The test going well at this time. Our countdown continuing T-54 minutes 6 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-020630|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control at T minus 50 minutes 55 seconds and counting. Preparations are underway in the launch control center at this time for a critical power transfer test. The space vehicle at this time is being fed from an external power source, but shortly before liftoff it will be transfered to the internal flight batteries. This test is to ensure that all electrical systems aboard the vehicle function properly on the internal flight batteries. The test takes about five minutes during which time the various elements of the launch team monitor their systems and report in then to the test supervisor, Bill Schick here in the control room that everything looks good during the test. Depending on local weather conditions the various areas around the United States, the flight of Apollo 17 will be monitored or be able to be seen by people as far as 500 miles away. This is the flight as seen of the first stage of powered flight. This would include a large portion the southeastern United States, northern tip of Cuba and the Bahama islands. The power transfer test is now underway; first stage, second stage, third stage, instrument unit now all going to internal power. Countdown continuing to go well T-minus 49 minutes 35 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Test Control.
-020130|PAO|This Apollo Saturn Launch Control, we're now T minus 45 minutes 55 seconds and counting. Various elements of the launch team reporting in to test supervisor Bill Schick, that they experienced no problems during the power transfer. We now transferred back again to an external power source, which will feed the vehicle systems until approximately 50 seconds before liftoff, at which time the final power transfer to Internal takes place. At the T minus 45 minute mark, we'll be watching for swing arm number 9. That's the swing arm which gives access to the Spacecraft to swing back to a retract position, 12 degrees back from the Spacecraft. This is a park position, a standby position, where it remain down until the final moments of the countdown. T minus 5 minutes, it swings back to the full retract position. Once it swing backs, the launch escape system aboard the - atop of the Spacecraft can be armed and this system could be used to pull the Astronaut crew to safety in any disaster. Now T minus 44 minutes 52 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-015635|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn - This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're at T minus 40 minutes, 51 seconds and counting. Swing arm number 9 just retracted a few minutes ago, and, as it retracted, the astronaut crew aboard the space field could feel it moving away from the spacecraft. Eugene Cernan the spacecraft commander commented, "We're really hanging out here in the breeze now." Spacecraft test conductor, referring to the weather indicated that that was just a small breeze. The launch escape system has been armed. The system now could be used to carry the astronauts to safety if necessary. It's also used during the initial phases of powered flight to carry the astronauts away in an emergency. It would fly away in a high arc pulling them to a height, enough so that their parachute systems could deploy, and they could make a normal landing. The system is about 33 feet long. The motor develops 147 thousand pounds of thrust. This is almost twice the amount of thrust of the Redstone rocket, which powered astronaut Alan Shepard, America's first man into space. The countdown continuing to move along smoothly now. T minus 39 minutes, 36 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-015047|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're at T-minus 35 minutes 11 seconds and counting. Spacecraft commander Gene Cernan just reported back to the spacecraft test conductor Skip Chauvin. He said, "You've delivered us the best now it's our turn. Thank the guys we want to see them as soon as we can when we get back and I guarantee you we'll do that." Meanwhile C-band beacon checks are going on with the space vehicle. The liquid hydrogen liquid oxygen fully aboard and being replenished at this time to ensure a full load at liftoff. Countdown continuing to go smoothly as we approach the half hour mark T-minus 34 minutes 34 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-014630|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control, T minus 30 minutes 54 seconds and counting. Manned Spacecraft just indicated to the test supervisor Bill Schick that we are go for the terminal countdown sequences. Final propulsion checks have been completed and the C-band readouts, once again repeated have been completed. Beach boss reports the launch sight recovery force helicopters are on station and ready. Digital range safety command checks are now underway as the countdown continues smoothly aiming for the T minus 30 minute mark. Now at T minus 30 minutes 24 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-014129|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control, T-25 minutes 54 seconds and counting. Command Module Pilot Ron Evans at this time has armed the reaction control system aboard the service module. He does this by allowing the hypergolic fuels to move down the lines to the engines. At this time he is reading out the temperatures, pressures and fuel quantities in that system. Our weather continues to look good. The major frontal area which had been of some concern earlier, has remained well west of the launch area also some smaller buildups which we have been monitoring do not appear to be coming close enough to cause any concern for our 9:53 PM launch time. That launch will be aiming Apollo 17 for the Taurus-Littrow area of the Moon. This area is named after the Taurus Mountains. These in southern Turkey and the Austrian astronomer, Littrow. The site is expected to yield some of the oldest and some of the youngest lunar samples returned during the Apollo flights to the Moon. Now T-24 minutes 50 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-013630|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control, T-minus 20 minutes 55 seconds and counting. Short time from now we we'll begin chilling the propulsion systems aboard the second and third stage of the Saturn V vehicle. This is necessary to condition them for the flow of the super cool liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. Just a few moments ago the crew aboard spacecraft America was given an updated weather forecast. Cernan reported, "I hope it's as beautiful out there as it is in here." Countdown continuing to move smoothly at T-minus 20 minutes 24 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-013133|PAO|This is Apollo - This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control, T minus 15 minutes 52 seconds and counting. The Vice-President of the United States, Spiro Agnew has entered the launch control center now. He'll observe the final portions of the countdown from here and also the launch. Arming and checking of the Service Module reaction control system has now been completed and in progress is the chilldown of the S-II, or second stage start tank. Checkouts continuing to go well, some running a little bit ahead of schedule, all on time. T minus 15 minutes 20 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Test Control.
-012632|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control at T-minus 10 minutes 55 seconds and counting. At this time some computer checks being run with the launch vehicle. The spacecraft has now gone to full internal power. Up to this point the spacecraft fuel cells have been sharing the power load with an external source. Also going on at this time are some checks of the astro comm circuit. This is the circuit which is used by the launch operations manager, spacecraft test conductor, Stony, and the three astronauts at launch time. This is to ensure that they are not getting any extraneous voices or are having to listen to any of the other network which might be carrying on a conversation which they don't need at that time. Countdown proceeding smoothly T-minus 10 minutes 15 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-012335|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control, T-minus 8 minutes and counting. T-minus 8 minutes and counting. The Vice-President in the firing room at the launch control center, observing the final minutes of the countdown and he'll watch the launch from here. The countdown has proceeded smoothly since picking up at 11:53 A.M. this morning. Weather continues to look good as we aim toward a 9:53 P.M. Eastern Standard Time launch. Now T-minus 7 minutes 37 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-012131|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control, T-minus 5 minutes 54 seconds and counting. At this time entering the final phases of the countdown various elements of the team reporting into Test Supervisor Bill Shick with the GO NO-GO for launch. At launch time a water deluge system at the pad will spray water over the entire area of the pad, some 400,000 gallons of water. More than the average family would use in three years will be spread over the pad and the swing arms protecting them from the searing flames of the Saturn V first stage. Various elements reporting in now. First stage reporting they are GO. Range Safety, Superintendent Range Operations they are GO. Launch Operations Manager reports he is GO for launch. Launch Director Walter Kapryan has given a GO for launch. We've passed the 5 minute mark, T-minus 4 minutes 55 seconds and counting and swing arm No. 9 now coming back to the fully retracted position. The launch escape system setting atop the spacecraft, spacecraft named America by the crew, now could pull the crew to safety if there were any problem while the vehicle remains on the pad or during the early portions of the flight. At the T-4 minute mark we'll be standing by for word from the Launch Vehicle Test Conductor Norm Carlson, giving a clear for launch for the launch vehicle ignition. At T-minus 3 minutes 7 seconds we'll go on an automatic sequencer. It's called the terminal countdown sequencer. The astronauts on the Astro com circuit now reporting and thanking the launch team for all their prayers and all their help. T-minus 3 minutes 55 seconds and counting. Apollo 17, the launch team wishes you good luck and God speed, reports the launch operations manager over the Astro com circuit. T-minus 3 minutes 40 seconds, the countdown continuing to go along smoothly. Once we go on the terminal countdown sequencer, the countdown will be automatic from there on out. The countdown sequencer will initiate the various functions from that time on; however, the men here in the firing room will be monitoring their consoles, watching temperatures, pressures, various readouts. They could override that terminal sequencer if necessary. Moving up now to the time when we'll go on that terminal sequencer.
-011842|PAO|T-3 minutes 10 seconds and counting. Spacecraft ready light has come on indicating that the spacecraft is ready. We are now on the terminal sequencer. Launch sequence has started. The flowing of that water on the pad will begin at the 1 minute mark flowing on the flame deflector below the launch vehicle on the launch pedestal itself and along the swing arms which will be coming back at liftoff. Instrument unit ready light has come on. Emergency detection system ready light is on. All indications are we are GO for launch as we approach the 2 minute 30 second mark. Pressurization of the various propellant tanks now aboard the space vehicle is starting. At two, our second stage liquid oxygen tanks now pressurized. These propellant tanks are pressurized with helium to insure that during the flight the fuel flows properly down through the engine. It's quiet here in the firing room now as the men are monitoring their consoles, looking at the temperatures, checking pressures and a variety of parameters to ensure everything is in a GO condition. Pressurization continuing on the fuel tanks at this time we'll go to the critical power transfer at the T-minus 50 second mark in the count down. At that time we'll transfer external power source to the flight battery aboard the space vehicle. The final action by the crew aboard the spacecraft America will be a final guidance alignment conducted by the Spacecraft Commander Gene Cernan. The flight of Apollo 17 will be able to be seen depending on weather conditions, some 500 miles away as it goes into Earth orbit. Pressurization continuing, liquid hydrogen tanks now aboard the second stage have been pressurized, all propellants aboard the second stage now pressurized. A cover aboard the Q-ball, this is the Q-ball system on top of the launch escape system will be pulled off just shortly before launch.
-011623|PAO|First stage propellant tanks have been pressurized. Now past the 1 minute mark and we are going on internal power. Now all systems to internal power. We'll be looking for the engine start sequence at the 8.9 second mark in the countdown. Engines will build up to a thrust of 7.6 million pounds.
-011602|PAO|T-minus 30 seconds, we have a cutoff, we have a cutoff at T-minus 30 seconds. We are standing by at T-minus 30 second mark. We'll bring word to you just as soon as we get it. We have a cutoff at T-minus 30 seconds. T-minus 30 seconds and holding. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-011501|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're holding at the 30 second mark. This was an automatic cutoff. Cutoff by the terminal sequencer as mentioned this sequencer initiates various actions. Each action must take place and must be completed before the next one can be initiated. If anything does not get completed in time there will be an automatic cutoff. This cutoff was automatic, done by the sequencer. We're standing by now to check just what the problem was. Now at T-minus 30 seconds and holding. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-011356|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. The astronaut crew aboard the spacecraft going through their various safeing now. Safeing of all systems and the launch team here continuing through their emergency procedures. We'll be standing by to check out the problem just as soon as we can get word. T-minus 30 seconds and holding. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-011156|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. The safeing procedures continuing at this time. Up to the T-minus 30 second mark the countdown had been proceeding smoothly. Weather conditions at launch were predicted to be and appears to be good at that time. However, we had an automatic cutoff from the terminal countdown sequencer and we're standing by to see just what caused that automatic cutoff. All systems being safed at this time. T-minus 30 seconds and we are in a hold. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-010845|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're continuing in our hold at the 30 second mark, while the launch team assesses our problem. The swing arm, swing arm number 9 will be brought back to it's park position, which is 12 degrees back from the space vehicle. Continuing the safeing procedures this time and assessing the problem, holding at T-minus 30 seconds, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-010322|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're continuing in our hold at the T-minus 30 second mark as the launch team assesses our problem. At this point swing arm number 9 is going back to the 12 degree park position. This is a position about 15 to 20 feet from the spacecraft. All safeing procedures have proceeded normally. We're continuing our hold while we assess our problem. at T-minus 30 seconds, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-010133|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. The swing arm number 9 is now back to that retract position at the 12 degree position. Point out that the window we have tonight extends to 1:31am. So we have some time here to assess the problem and then continue - recycle and continue our countdown. We're continuing to hold at the 30 second mark at this time. 30 seconds and holding, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-005427|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're at T-minus 30 seconds and continuing our hold. The problem was with the terminal countdown sequencer, which failed to give the command to pressure, pressurize the third stage lox tank. The crew in the firing room, realizing this were seeing this happen pressurized the tank manually, but this did not happen fast enough to satisfy the automatic sequencer. As was mentioned earlier, during this sequence everything must happen at a certain time, before the next step in the sequence can take place. The next step that was to take place was the retraction of swing arm 9, and at the time that was to take place the terminal sequencer had not had an indication that the third stage lox tank had been pressurized. The plan now is to recycle to the T minus 22 minute mark in the countdown. Now this recycling procedure will take an additional 35 to 40 minutes. This still puts us well within our launch window. While we're recycling, we'll continue to review the data to determine just what the problem is and whether or not we can proceed from the T minus 22 minute mark for a launch later in the window. The crew aboard the spacecraft has been alerted to the problem and understand what is happening. They're standing by there at this time. Now at T minus 30 seconds and holding, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-004926|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control, We're remaining still in the T-minus 30 second mark. We'll remain here for some period. It will take approximately 35 to 40 minutes to recycle back to T minus 22 minutes, where we'll resume the count. To explain again what has happened was we were in what was called the terminal countdown sequencer. At 3 minutes 7 seconds in the countdown we go on to an automatic system called the terminal countdown sequencer. This countdown sequencer initiates various actions, the final actions in the count. Each of these must occur on schedule and in sequence. Now what happened at this particular time was, the third stage liquid oxygen tank was not automatically pressurized as it should have been. The launch crew here in the firing room, when they saw this, manually pressurized that system, but it was too late to satisfy the sequencer. The next event in the sequence was the retraction of swing arm number 1, swing arm going over to the first stage and at that time, the sequencer did not see that the tank had been pressurized and sent an automatic cut-off. So we had an automatic cut-off at the 30 second mark. We're standing by at the 30 second mark to go back to T-minus 22 minutes and we are reevaluating the problem, looking at the, what caused the sequencer not to automatically pressurize that tank, seeing what that problem is and seeing if there is a possibility if we go ahead and do this manually early in the sequence, if that will satisfy the sequencer and we can proceed. Now holding at the T-minus 30 second mark in our countdown, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-004701|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're continuing to stand by here at the T-minus 30 second mark in the countdown. The crew remaining perfectly calm in their spacecraft. They have gone through their safeing checks. The various safeing checks of the launch vehicle have been completed. We are now going through preparations for recycling to the T-minus 22 minute mark. Standing by at this time at T-minus 30 seconds. T-minus 30 seconds and holding in the countdown for Apollo 17. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-004543|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're continuing our hold at the 30 second mark. We'll recycle to the T-minus 22 minute mark. The T-minus 22 minute mark is chosen as the recycling point because this is the point where we start the chill down as was mentioned during that point in the countdown. We start the chill down of the second and third stages to prepare them for the influx of the liquid hydrogen, the cold liquid hydrogen and the cold liquid oxygen. This chill down has some very specific parameters and must be started at a certain time and cannot go beyond a certain time. So it's best to go back to that point in the countdown under these circumstances and to resume our count at the T-minus 22 minute mark. When a determination is made that we can resume. Continuing to look at the data here is see exactly what happened. There is no indication of ignition. Ignition was scheduled to come at the 8.9 second mark. Here in the control room a number of the people were looking through the remote cameras which have the capability out at the pad of zooming in on specific areas and a number of people here were looking right at those first stage engines and there was no indication whatsoever of engine ignition. We're continuing to evaluate all the data at this time as we hold at the T-minus 30 second mark. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-004351|PAO|This Apollo Saturn Launch Control still in our hold at the 30 second mark. While the launch team here is busy recycling to the T-22 minute mark, the mission team out at the Manned Spacecraft Center also preplanning some of the new time for the mission. They are also at this time busily preplanning the new launch azimuth. The azimuth now if we go at the next opportunity would be the 81.06 degrees. This will be automatically fed into the instrument unit of the Saturn V vehicle from the Manned Spacecraft Center. All elements of the launch team now putting everything together, checking over data and doing their best to put us back into a recycle position ready to pick up the count at the T-minus 22 minute mark. Still evaluating data, however, and we have not at this time been given a GO for that resuming of the countdown. T-minus 30 seconds and holding at this time. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-004227|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control, continuing our hold at the 30 second mark. Back at the mission control center in Houston the flight controllers returning to their seats now after some consultation. They're back now giving status check and getting ready in case we are - it is determined that we can pick up the count. In the firing room here, the Apollo Program Director Rocco Petrone has moved into the viewing area where the President - Vice President Spiro Agnew and NASA administrator James Fletcher are and he is giving them a briefing and a run down on our problem. We are standing by at this time. The clock has now been recycled to the T-minus 22 minute mark; however, we have not picked up the count at that mark. We are now at T-minus 22 minutes and holding. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-004115|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control, continuing to stand by at the T minus 22 minute mark in the countdown. Recycling operations have gone well. We're back to the T-minus 22 minute mark and at this mark which we will pick up the count if we are given a go to resume. Check has been made of the Mission Control Center team at the Mission Control Center in Houston. All elements of that team reporting that they are ready to resume as soon as they get the word. Now standing by here at Kennedy Space Center, while data is reviewed and determination will be made if and when we can resume our countdown for Apollo 17. Now at T-minus 22 minutes and holding, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-004016|PAO|This Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We are continuing to standby at the T-minus 22 minute mark. We are hoping to resume the count shortly. The problem has not been resolved. We're continuing to look into it; however, it has been determined that a resolution one way or the other should be able to be made shortly. So right now we are continuing our recycle procedures hoping to pick up the count perhaps just minutes from now. If the problem is not resolved by the time we reach the T-minus 8 minute mark after we continue to countdown, the clock will be held again. Right now we are continuing the recycling procedures hoping to pick up shortly at T-minus 22 minutes. We are now T-minus 22 minutes and holding. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-003908|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're continuing to stand by at the T-minus 22 minute mark. We've been given the word here in the firing room now that the count will be resumed at 11 p.m. at T-minus 22 minutes. At this time there still has not been a resolution to the problem, but we'll continue looking at that. We could continue on counting down while this problem is looked at. To reiterate what the problem was; the terminal countdown sequencer failed to give the command to pressurize the third stage liquid oxygen tanks. The crews monitoring this function saw that that happened and immediately manually pressurized the tanks, but this did not occur in time in the sequence and when swing arm one was to retract it had not received this signal. As a consequence an automatic cutoff was sent. There are several possible workarounds to this they are being looked into at this time, and we plan to resume our countdown at the T-minus 22 minute mark at 11 p.m. Now holding at T-minus 22 minutes. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-003754|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're at T-minus 21 minutes 10 seconds and counting. The countdown picked up, the launch team here made a quick check of the various elements, all reporting in to the test supervisor Bill Schick, indicating that they were ready to resume the count. Now counting at T-minus 20 minutes 53 seconds, and we'll continue to countdown here as we look at the problem which caused the hold at the T-minus 30 second mark. Now at T-minus 20 minutes 42 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-003119|PAO|This Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're at T-14 minutes 35 seconds and counting in our countdown for Apollo 17. Back at the Mission Control Center the men there are updating the launch azimuth. Launch azimuth standing now at 82.54 degrees. This will automatically be feed into the instrument unit. The swing arm, swing arm number 9, the access arm to the spacecraft, remains at the 12 degree position it will remain there until the T-minus 5 minute mark in the countdown. Going on at this time are the recycling of some of the vents for the liquid hydrogen and the liquid oxygen. These are the vents which allow the venting of these gases as there is some boil-off occurring. It is necessary to continue venting these to ensure they do not freeze in either an open or closed position. The countdown proceeding smoothly now. T-minus 13 minutes 43 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-002638|CMP|Alpha. Okay, EDS AUTO is on up now.
-002626|CMP|... verify AUTO. Launch vehicle rates, verify AUTO.
-002620|CMP|RCS command is OFF. Release.
-002617|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're at T-minus 9 minutes 36 seconds and we are counting. However, we do plan to continue the hold at the T-minus 8 minute mark. We can hold at that point for 20 minutes and plan a 20 minute hold while the launch crew here satisfies themselves that they have worked out a good solution and a work around to the problem. The crew has been alerted aboard the spacecraft. Cernan indicated that perhaps they could start a nice conservation about a good book, Thomas Hardy or something like that. Countdown continuing now aiming toward the 8 minute mark at which time we'll hold. T-minus 9 minutes now T-minus 9 minutes and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-002620|CDR|One at AC1, MAIN A. Two AC2, MAIN B.
-002559|LMP|Okay, that's going to latch.
-002537|CDR|Roger, ATC. Understand Challenger is GO for launch.
-002512|LMP|Okay, secondary PUMP switch is OFF.
-002509|LMP|MARK it.
-002438|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're now holding at the 8 minute mark as planned. The hold at this time is planned for approximately 20 minutes. The crew feels that they have, that they have a work around to the problem, working around the indication going to the terminal sequencer that the tank has not been pressurized, when actually it had been done manually. They are checking all of their data, however, to insure that this is the proper method to work around the problem and that this will result in a smooth countdown from here on. Now at T-minus 8 minutes and holding, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-002413|CDR|Okay, we'll be looking for them.
-002341|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're continuing our hold at the 8 minute mark. The launch operations manager has gone over with the launch team their proposed solution a work around. The team appears to be satisfied that it is the proper one. They are now briefing management personnel on the problem and the work around. Out at the pad the liquid oxygen continues to vent from the vehicle and is replenished. Liquid hydrogen is also vented from the vehicle as there is some boil off. However, because it is quite a volatile fuel it is vented through a burnpond at the side of the pad. That burnpond is at the north side of the pad and there it can be seen burning in a controlled condition at this time. This is a normal condition, actually during the day this burns in such a pure manner that it cannot be seen. However, at night it is clearly visible. Our countdown continuing to hold at the T-minus 8 minute mark at this time. T-minus 8 minutes and holding this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-002225|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're continuing to hold at the T-8 minute mark. Me an time the crew is getting a variety of updates in the spacecraft, updating them on various aspects and the changes to their mission due to this hold period. Also, at the Manned Spacecraft Center they are continuing to update the flight azimuth as they get new times for the launch. Launch Operations Manager Paul Donnelly just went through quite an extensive briefing with the spacecraft test conductor to pass on to the crew what they feel the problems were and how they plan to work around it. The crew aboard the spacecraft indicated that if the launch team was satisfied with these solutions, that they certainly were confident themselves. Now continuing our hold at the T-minus 8 minute mark this is Kennedy Test Control.
-002158|CDR|Okay, understand; full retract.
-002147|CDR|Skipper, thank you. We - we plan to, babe.
-002140|CDR|We're going to do our best, and we're also going to have a ball.
-002121|CDR|Thank you for the hardware, and the help, and the prayers, and everything else that goes into making a good mission.
-002117|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're continuing in our hold at the T minus 8 minute mark. At this time, it's been determined to take an additional 20 minutes, add an additional 20 minutes to that planned hold period. The reason for this is, the crews would like to take the work around that they have devised and at Marshall Spaceflight Center, where the Saturn V launch vehicle was developed, they have what is called a bread board or a system, which is similar to this one and run through the sequence and insure that it does operate properly. The crew aboard the spacecraft was informed of this additional 20 minute hold. They indicated that they expected to use all three stages of this Saturn V and they were happy to have the 20 minute hold if that was going to assure that all three were going to work properly. Now continuing our hold at the T-minus 8 minute mark, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-002114|CDR|I sure do, I've got 5 good bright ones.
-002104|CDR|... you're loud and clear.
-002057|CDR|We thank you, very much. Loud and clear.
-002049|CMP|Air 5, program 02. Okay, we've got a VERB 75 do not enter. Please.
-002006|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Test Control. We are continuing our hold at the T-minus 8 minute mark. The reason the T-minus 8 minute mark is chosen for this hold as mentioned earlier has to do with the chilldown of the thrust chambers in the S-2 or second stage and the third stage. Both of these stages use liquid hydrogen, an extremely cold cryogenic fuel and the thrust chamber must be conditioned prior to flight so that it's ready at the time of ignition in-flight to receive these fuels coming in. To achieve the proper temperature the thrust chamber chilldown should not exceed 20 minutes, but it must be on for at least 7 minutes and 40 seconds. So rounding that off the hold was called at the 8 minute mark. We can continuously hold it at this point whereas if we continued on down we would have to watch these parameters very closely so that we did not exceed that 20 minute accumulated cooling time. At this point we can continue our hold and that continuation can be determined by the problem and we can pick up then at any time or continue as long as necessary. We're continuing that hold now at T-minus 8 minutes and holding. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-002006|CDR|Roger. 3 minutes, Bob. Forward ...
-001914|CDR|It's pull the bypass, skip.
-001904|CDR|Roger. 2 Minutes.
-001828|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're continuing in our hold at the T-minus 8 minute mark. Back at the Marshall Spaceflight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, the crews there are at work on a bread board, or a mock-up of the system in question, where they're putting it through it s paces, checking out the work around solution, that is, jumping around this erroneous signal, and insuring that everything works properly. The crew still standing by in the spacecraft, updating various systems there, updating their flight plan, all continuing to go well there. The crew at the Manned Spacecraft Center also doing considerable amount of updating. They'll be continuing to update the azimuth, and the Launch Control Center here at Kennedy Space Center, the launch team manning their consoles, standing by to pick up the count, when we're given the word to go. However, we're standing by still. At this time, we have no word from the Marshall Spaceflight Center. We're expecting that to come within 10 to 15 minutes from this time. Now at T-minus 8 minutes and holding, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-001824|LMP|Roger. Bus ties going on. The AC's on. DC's on.
-001806|CDR|Roger. 1 Minute.
-001759|CDR|CDR PAD COMM is OFF. LMP?
-001749|CDR|Roger. GDC align, and ball number 2 is coming in.
-001725|CDR|Roger. Understand, cut-off.
-001655|CDR|That's affirm, understand. We're just holding fast here.
-001653|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're continuing in our hold period at this time. Test Supervisor Bill Shick just announced here in the Firing Room that the hold is expected to last approximately 20 more minutes. Liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen continuing to be replenished aboard the 3 stages of the launch vehicle at this time. That replenishing will continue during the hold period and during the final minutes of the countdown. The countdown continuing in the hold. T-minus 8 minutes and holding this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-001633|CDR|Okay, we'll just standby, hold fast.
-001600|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control at one minute to midnight, one minute to midnight. We are continuing to hold at the T-minus 8 minute mark. Work is still going on at the Marshall Spaceflight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Updating of the tracking continuing at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston. And the launch team here at Kennedy Space Center preparing to pick up the count. Hopefully, we will be given a go-ahead to pick up the count in approximately 10 to 12 minutes from this time. We are continuing to standby waiting to hear from the testing going on at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville. To recap the activities earlier today the countdown picked up at 11:53 a.m. after a planned hold period picked up at T-minus 9 hours mark shortly after that time the pad was cleared and we began loading the cryogenic fuels, that's the liquid hydrogen and the liquid oxygen aboard the space vehicle. Those operations actually went a little bit ahead of schedule. The astronaut crew went out to the pad, entered their spacecraft, began checking it out and those operations also running a little bit ahead of schedule. We went on to our terminal countdown sequencer at the 3 minute 6 second mark as scheduled. Everything seemed to be proceeding fine. At the T-minus 30 second mark we got an automatic cut-off. It was determined that this cut-off came because pressurization of the liquid oxygen tank aboard the third stage was not initiated automatically as it should have been when it was done manually the terminal sequencer did not sense that this had been done, and therefore gave the automatic cut-off. We're working the problem right now continuing to hold at the T-minus 8 minute mark. T-minus 8 minutes, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-001545|CDR|Okay, push to normal.
-001408|CDR|Roger. TVC servo 1 is OFF, and 2 is OFF. Roger, REAC valve to NORMAL.
-001342|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control, continuing to hold at the T-minus 8 minute mark. The hold continues to be planned for approximately 5 to 7 more minutes. However, the launch window should be pointed out tonight extends to 1:31 AM. Now if for any reason we could not make it in that launch window, we could recycle under our present configuration and resume our count aiming for a 9:53PM EST launch tonight. The window for tonight is the same as it was for last night and this morning - 9:53PM to 1:31AM, however the launch team appears to be optimistic with the solution they've found to the problem. They are just waiting for verification and confirmation from the testing that's going on at the Marshall Spaceflight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. The time now is 7 minutes after midnight We're continuing to hold at T-minus 8 minutes. T-minus 8 minutes and holding , this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-001327|CMP|Okay, I've got a VERB 34. ENTER. Uh. ... That's affirm.
-001310|CDR|STC, CDR. The 5 engine lights all went on about a minute ago.
-001258|LMP|Roger, going OFF and then AUTO. AC. DC.
-001228|CDR|Okay, CDR's PAD COMM. And LMP's ...
-001214|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control, continuing to hold at the 8 minute mark in the countdown. Still awaiting word from the Marshall Spaceflight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, and the result of the test being run at this time up there. Meanwhile, here in the firing room, all elements of the launch team are assessing their position. They are assessing the effect of the hold and this amount of hold time on each of their systems. Everyone, at this time, busily at work here in the firing room, also at the Mission Control Center in Houston, busy there with their flight update. Now continuing to hold at the T-minus 8 minute mark, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-001137|CDR|TC, CDR. You're busy Skip, I just wondered if think it's going to be a GO for a recycle here. Okay.
-001113|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're at 15 minutes past the hour continuing to hold at the T-minus 8 minute mark. The supervisor just indicated that we plan to pick up the clock at the T-minus 8 minute mark in 10 minutes. Planning to pick up the clock at 25 minutes past the hour. The tests being run - or have been run now at the Marshall Space Flight Center and indicate that our system is good the way it has been reconfigured. All elements now during this 10 minutes will be preparing their various systems to pick up the clock at the T-minus 8 minute mark. Meanwhile, out at the Manned Spacecraft Center the flight controllers there also planning to pick up the clock. We just received a GO from the superintendent of range operations indicating that the range has been cleared around the new flight azimuth. The Manned Spacecraft Center Houston flight indicates that they are go to pick up the clock at 25 minutes past the hour. Now at T-minus 8 minutes and holding this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-000948|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch control. We're continuing our hold at the T minus 8 minute mark. We have approximately 5 more minutes remaining in that hold. It's been determined that the workaround is a correct and satisfactory one, A bread board or a sample system at the Marshall Spaceflight Center was used to run through the entire sequence as it now configured and that operated satisfactorily. What happened was the - during the terminal sequencer, the liquid oxygen tank was not pressurized automatically. When this was done manually, the indication did not get to the sensors in time so that we had an automatic cutoff. The liquid oxygen tanks aboard the third stage, it has been determined, will be pressurized manually early in the terminal sequence and jumpers have been installed so that we can then feed the information to the sequencer so that it will not have an indication that the LOX tanks have not been pressurized. This - a bread board situation of this has been constructed at the Marshall Spaceflight Center in Huntsville and this has operated satisfactorily. So, it's been determined to go ahead with our countdown on this basis. We'll be planning to pick up the count at the T-minus 8 minute mark some 4 minutes from now. Now T-minus 8 minutes and holding. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
-000920|CDR|Okay. Skip, we're just sitting tight. Okay. Yes, I'll get my pencil out, I guess.
-000814|CDR|Roger. Coming back to PARK.
-000759|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We are now resuming the count. T minus 7 minutes 54 seconds and counting. At this time in the Spacecraft update is being given to the Spacecraft Commander, Eugene Cernan. The swing arm still at the 12 degree position, that is the park position, standing by at the Spacecraft. That will be brought to the full retract position at approximately T-minus 5 minutes in the countdown. The flight director just ran through the - his team - a status report from his team at the Mission Control Center. That team all reported they are in a GO condition. Now, at T-minus 7 minutes 20 seconds and counting this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-000543|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control, T minus 5 minutes 40 seconds and counting. At this time the various elements of the launch team have been reporting in to Bill Shigby, test supervisor, indicating that we are GO to continue. Mission director Chet Lee just verified that we are GO for launch. Safety indicates that we have a GO, First stage test conductor, this is the man who has charge of those five first stage engines which will give us the lift-off, has indicated a GO for launch. Launch Operations Manager, Paul Donnley, also giving us a GO for launch, and finally the Launch Director, Walter Kapryan says we are GO for launch. We've passed the five minute mark now and swing arm number 9, this is the access arm to the spacecraft, is coming back to the full retract position. It moves back along side the mobile launch tower and it will remain there now through the final portion of the countdown and the launch. At the T-minus 60 second mark 20 nozzles will start flame deflector deluge of 13,000 gallons per minute of water pouring down on that flame deflector, so a great deal of what is seen at launch time, which looks like smoke, is actually steam as this water is burned off. This water's to cool the pad area and to cool the equipment along side the launch tower as the water also pours across the swing arms in the launch tower. We are approaching the 4 minute mark in the countdown now, T-minus 4 minutes 5 seconds and continuing to count. At the 4 minute mark we'll stand by for a final GO from Norm Carlson, Launch Vehicle Test Conductor. He has given a GO. The Launch Operations Manager now switching over to the astro COMM circuit, this is the circuit that the astronauts, the launch operations manager and the spacecraft communicator will remain on. They have this private circuit to keep extraneous talk off of their circuit. They are checking in, they are checking in now on the astro COMM circuit Indicating that they are GO. Spacecraft has indicated they are ready. Instrument unit ready light has come on. S-IC, that's the first stage, preparations are now complete as we approach the 3 minute mark. There is quiet in the firing room now as the engineers and technicians are monitoring their consoles. They are monitoring the various rates, pressures, temperatures, they can override the terminal sequencer if they sight a problem that it has not picked up. We are on that terminal sequencer now, we have passed the 3 minute mark T-minus 2 minutes 47 seconds and counting as we are on the terminal sequencer. At the T-minus 50 second mark we will be looking for that critical power transfer. This is where we transfer from the external power source, which has been feeding the 3 stages of the launch vehicle to internal power to the flight batteries aboard the space vehicle. It's expected that given proper weather conditions people will be observing this flight from as much as 500 miles away. This includes a large portion of the southeastern United States, the northern tip of Cuba and the Bahama islands. Now approaching the 2 minutes, 2 minute mark, MARK, T-minus 2 minutes and counting and the countdown continues to move along smoothly now in the terminal countdown portion. The automatic sequencer has stopped the replenishing of the liquid oxygen and the liquid hydrogen. We're standing by now to begin pressurization of the fuel tanks, the second stage fuel tank pressurized, third stage fuel tank pressurized. The countdown continuing to move along smoothly. T-minus 90 seconds, T-minus 90 seconds. Countdown continuing smoothly. S-IVB propellant pressurized, the indication now using the work around showing the S-IVB propellant has been pressurized. Now looking at the liquid hydrogen tank, as they become pressurized LH2 aboard the second stage pressurized. All propellants now aboard the second stage pressurized as we approach the 1 minute mark in the countdown.
-000408|CDR|Okay. We'll be ready when you are.
-000100|PAO|MARK. T-minus 1 minute and counting. Now in the final minute of the countdown. At T-minus 45 seconds Gene Cernan will make the final guidance alignment - this is the -
-000044|PAO|MARK. T-minus 45 and Gene Cernan made that final guidance alignment. That's the last action taken by the crew aboard the space vehicle. Now approaching the half minute mark. T-minus 33, T-minus 30 seconds and continuing on now - continuing on at T-minus 26 seconds ...
-000030|CC|30 to go.
-000029|CDR|Okay, Robert. We're ready and we're GO up here.
-000025|PAO|MARK. T-minus 25. We'll get a final guidance release at the T-minus 17 second mark. T-minus 17, final guidance release. We'll expect engine ignition at 8.9 seconds ...
-000020|CC|Minus 20.
-000010|PAO|10 ... 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... ignition sequence started - all engines are started - we have ignition 2, 1, zero - we have a liftoff.

0000343|PAO|That's the automatic guidance system, the inertial guidance system, performing properly.
0000345|CDR|Okay, Bob, I got the ELS SEP circuit breakers. And we've seen it all: ignition, staging, and tower.
0000352|CC|Roger. Got you.
0000354|LMP|By the way, the cabin's sealed (laughter).
0000358|PAO|Apollo 17 now 65 miles high.
0000358|CDR|Okay guys, we've got a long way to go.
0000400|CMP|Okay, I'll tell you where in the hell we're going here.
0000403|CDR|Okay; 4 minutes and we're GO here, Bob.
0000406|CC|Roger, Gene. We're going round the room. Looks GO here.
0000409|CDR|21 degrees. We're MODE 2, Ron.

0000430|CC|Roger, 17. You're GO.
0000434|CDR|Let me tell you, this night launch is something to behold.
0000438|CMP|Okay, H and H-DOT are good.
0000446|CDR|Okay, I don't know if you'll be able to pick up any horizon.
0000447|PAO|Coming up on 5 minutes. Everything still looks very good in the launch of Apollo 17. The launch vehicle spacecraft now 80 miles high, 230 miles down range.
0000450|CMP|No, it's too dark - too light in here.
0000452|CDR|Yes.
0000455|CDR|Okay, let's keep - on. One G.
0000458|LMP|I got some stars out on the right, but I don't see -
0000502|CC|Five minutes, Geno, and you're GO down here. You're looking great.
0000505|CDR|... Jack, Okay.
0000506|CDR|Okay, Robert. We're GO here at 5.
0000513|CMP|Coming up on S-IVB to COI.
0000514|CDR|You guys believe me about that S-I staging now?
0000516|CMP|(laughter) I can't -
0000519|LMP|I can't believe how smooth this is.
0000520|CMP|I can't - I can't believe how smooth this is.
0000521|CDR|Okay, let's keep this mother burning. We've got a long way to go. We're only half way there.
0000524|CC|17, Houston. Your times are nominal. Level sense arm at 8 plus 36; S-II shutdown at 9 plus 20. Nominal times.
0000533|CDR|8 plus 36 and 9 plus 20. Roger.
0000536|LMP|Coming up on gimbal motors, Geno.
0000537|CDR|Okay. ...
0000538|PAO|CAPCOM Robert Obermeyer, advising Gene Cernan and the crew aboard Apollo 17 the second stage shutdown at about 9 minutes 20 seconds elapsed time. That shutdown about 3 and a half minutes from now.
0000552|CDR|I forget anything yet, Ron?
0000554|CMP|Nope.
0000554|CDR|Okay, we're still MODE 2, coming up on -
0000556|CC|Standby for S-IVB to COI capability.
0000559|CC|MARK. S-IVB to COI capability.
0000601|CDR|Roger. S-IVB to COI. We're GO at 6.
0000603|CDR|Good. Gimbal motors?
0000604|CMP|Go ahead.
0000605|CC|Roger, Geno.
0000606|CDR|PITCH 1.
0000606|CMP|Got it.
0000607|CDR|And YAW 1.
0000608|CMP|Got it. Go ahead. ...
0000613|CDR|PITCH 2.
0000615|CMP|Got it.
0000615|CDR|And YAW 2.
0000615|PAO|Apollo 17 still right on the nominal trajectory at an altitude now of about 92 nautical miles.
0000616|CMP|Got it. Okay, got a plus 15.8 and a plus 19. ...
0000621|CDR|Okay, Bob. We're got four good motors and we're GO at 06:20.
0000625|CC|Roger. And, 17, we copied the gimbals and watched them and they looked good.
0000629|CMP|One G? Just like sitting on the pad, isn't it? A ...
0000635|LMP|Okay, our calibration on that tank changed a little bit again, apparently.
0000639|CDR|Okay.
0000640|LMP|Down at 90%.
0000641|CMP|90? On the TANK 2?
0000644|LMP|On the hydrogen.
0000645|CMP|Hydrogen. TANK 3, I mean.
0000646|CC|Stand by for S-IVB to orbit capability.
0000649|CDR|Roger, Bob. ...
0000649|CC|MARK. S-IVB to orbit capability. And we'd like OMNI Delta, Jack.
0000654|LMP|Roger. You've got it.
0000656|CMP|Okay, 7 minutes ...
0000658|CC|Roger.
0000700|CDR|7, and I'm 6 degrees. How does that sound?
0000701|CMP|Okay, that's good. 17, 3. Let's see, 119. We go to ... half a mile high.
0000701|PAO|Now 7 minutes in and we have sufficient velocity to make orbit with the Saturn third stage should we have an unexpected early shutdown of the second stage.
0000708|CDR|Seven minutes, Bob. We're looking good onboard.
0000711|CC|Roger.
0000717|CDR|Am I glad I took my hand off that abort handle!
0000719|CMP|(laughter) man!
0000720|LMP|So am I. (laughter) I'll tell ya (laughter)
0000724|CDR|Okay, we've got to get through this one, and then through staging. Standby for inboard. Okay. ...
0000727|PAO|We're now less than 2 minutes from second stage shutdown and ignition of the Saturn third stage. And the center engine will be shutting down as scheduled in about 10 seconds.
0000734|CDR|Standby for inboard.
0000735|CMP|Okay. Okay, we're at a G 1/2. Standby.
0000740|CDR|We have inboard cut-off.
0000743|CC|Roger, Gene. Inboard on time.
0000746|PAO|And that inboard shutdown looked to be on time.
0000750|CDR|Okay, she pitches up just like the simulator.
0000751|CMP|Yep. Sure does. Pitches -
0000753|PAO|Apollo 17 now 625 miles downrange, 93 miles in altitude.
0000755|LMP|(grunting noise)
0000756|CMP|Is that hard to reach, Jack?
0000757|LMP|Yes. Why don't you take it down, I can't quite - G and a half is too much.
0000801|CDR|Eight minutes, and we are GO.
0000803|CC|Roger, 17. You're looking great.
0000808|CDR|Okay, ... standby for a PU shift.
0000812|CMP|Is that what that was?
0000814|CDR|Yes, I think it was.
0000815|CMP|Yes, I think that was it.
0000817|PAO|The spacecraft guidance systems agreeing very closely with the Saturn guidance. It looks good.
0000818|CDR|Okay, Ron. That level sense arm will be at 36.
0000820|CMP|36. Okay.
0000821|CC|17, Houston. You are GO for staging.
0000824|CDR|Thank you, Bob. We are GO for staging up here.
0000829|CDR|A little over a G.
0000831|LMP|There's a little chug.
0000832|PAO|Staging now less than 1 minute.
0000834|CDR|Okay, we've got to get through this one. Coming in, we're level sense arm now.
0000840|CC|You have level sense arm at this time, Gene.
0000842|CDR|Roger, Bob. Level sense arm.
0000846|CDR|Okay, Ron. Our next thing will be standby for MODE 4, and we'll have staging. I will call it out to you.
0000848|PAO|Apollo 17 traveling at 21,000 feet per second. It's achieved about 83 percent of the velocity required for a minimum orbit.
0000852|CDR|And little S-IVB burn, baby burn. Gimbal ...
0000901|CDR|Nine minutes, Bob, and 17 is GO.
0000904|CC|Roger, 17. You're GO here.
0000906|CDR|Okay, standby.
0000907|PAO|And about 10 seconds to staging.
0000909|CDR|10 seconds.
0000916|CC|Standby for Mode IV capability.
0000920|CDR|S-II cut-off.
0000921|CC|MARK. Mode IV capability, and we copy cut-off.
0000923|CDR|Roger. Mode IV. And we do have S-IVB ignition.
0000928|CC|Roger. We see it, and the thrust is looking good on it.
0000930|CDR|God, you see that glow ...
0000931|CMP|Geez!
0000931|CDR|We saw that one, too, Bob.
0000933|CC|Roger.
0000933|CDR|Did you see it go past us?
0000934|CMP|Yes.
0000935|LMP|We're right in the flame.
0000936|CDR|Yes, that's what the Titan used to do. Used to fly through the flame of that thing. Let's, let's press on here we've got a lot to do. We're MODE 4.
0000945|PAO|We're up to 23,000 feet per second - we'll be shooting for something over 25,000.
0000946|CMP|Yes.
0000947|CDR|Okay, we're at - a little less than 1/2 G.
0000949|CMP|Less than half of a G.
0000950|CDR|Okay, 10 minutes, Ron. I'll be at about fourty ...
0000955|CC|17, the steering has converged and the CMC is GO. You're looking great.
0000959|CDR|Roger. The CMC is GO, 10 minutes, and 17 is GO onboard.
0001002|CMP|Okay, H-DOT's a little bit low, but not bad.
0001007|CC|17; Houston. You are GO for orbit - GO for orbit.
0001011|CDR|Those are kind words, Robert. We're GO for orbit here.
0001015|CC|Good show, Gene.
0001018|CDR|Okay, coming up on 3.0, Ron.
0001020|CMP|Okay.
0001020|CDR|Doublecheck everything.
0001021|PAO|Coming up on 10 minutes 30 seconds after liftoff and the spacecraft launch vehicle now 11,000 - 1,100 miles, rather, downrange, altitude 93.4 miles.
0001022|CMP|3.0, 347 degrees. 23.9. Okay, we're a little bit high.
0001028|CDR|I couldn't see a star if I had to right now.
0001029|LMP|I couldn't either. Velocity's a little high.
0001031|CDR|Okay. 10:30 and we're GO.
0001033|CMP|H-DOT's a little high. A little bit low -
0001034|CC|Roger, 17. You're looking great.
0001036|CDR|Okay, the cutoff is VI plus 100.
0001037|CMP|VI ... okay, I'll count you down.
0001052|PAO|And we're about 1 minute from shutdown, about 1 minute from orbit insertion.
0001104|CDR|Eleven minutes and we are GO.
0001106|CC|Roger, Gene. And cut-off will be at 11 plus 47, 11 plus 47.
0001113|CDR|11 plus 47. Roger.
0001131|CDR|Okay. 11:30 and we're GO here. And - Standing by.
0001135|CC|Roger, Gene. Cut-off time is still holding good, 11 plus 47.
0001143|CDR|Okay. Cut-off at 42.
0001147|CC|Understand. Cut-off at 42. Roger. We copy.
0001154|PAO|And that looked like a near nominal shutdown. At shutdown we show 25,600 feet per second. That also looks very close.
0001200|CDR|We're looking at 93.5 by 89.5.
0001207|CC|Roger, Gene. We're copying the DSKY.
0001212|CDR|Okay, Jack. Give - -
0001216|PAO|Gene Cernan reporting the on-board Indication of an orbit of 93.5 by 89.5. Now we'll be getting tracking and confirming that here on the ground.
0001220|CC|And the local horizontal maneuver has initiated, Gene.
0001245|CDR|And, Houston, the - looks like the - tank pressures are venting.
0001254|CC|Roger, Gene. The range safety is safe and we - you are in a GO orbit, nominal.
0001300|CDR|Roger. GO orbit, nominal. Thank you.
0001315|CC|And, 17, I'll be unable to update that AOS time, but 52:20 is looking good.
0001323|CDR|Roger.
0001347|PAO|This is Apollo Control coming up on 14 minutes after liftoff, that liftoff coming about 2 hours 40 minutes late, and we'll be assessing the effects of that late liftoff on subsequent events in the mission timeline, passing those along. One of the effects will be a change in the acquisition of signal / loss of signal time and as we move along on the ground track -
0001410|LMP|Houston, can you confirm - MAIN BUS TIE A/C, OFF?
0001415|CC|Stand by on that, Jack.
0001417|LMP|I've been carrying very low amps on the BAT BUS, and I did not see a drop. I'm carrying about 2 amps now. Volts are 3 - 30.5.
0001440|CC|Jack, go ahead and take the B/C motor switch OFF.
0001447|LMP|Okay. It's OFF. And I confirm that one.
0001450|CC|And we think it's the EDS POWER switch and the fuel cell ... switch that are drawing the current that you're seeing there.
0001458|LMP|Okay. That could well be.
0001501|CC|Okay, Jack, we're going to lose you in about 1 minute off of Vanguard here and see you at 52:20.
0001506|LMP|Roger; we're pressing and thanks, Bob.
0001509|CDR|Okay, Bob. Everything is looking GO onboard. Everything's stable. We can see the APS firing, and our attitudes look good.
0001520|CC|Geno, everything is in good shape down here. The booster's in good shape; you're looking good; and their AOS time is 52:20 as I'gave you.
0001528|CDR|We got that, babe. We'll see you coming around.
0001530|CC|Good show, babe. A little late but a good show.
0001533|CMP|Outstanding ride.
0001626|CC|17, Houston. We're hanging with you here. Looks like you're hanging in Vanguard a little longer than we expected.
0001642|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 16 minutes 45 seconds after liftoff. We've confirmed Apollo 17 is in a near nominal orbit. The crew reported an orbit of about 93.5 by 89.5 based on their onboard calculations, and computations on the ground show that we're very close to the nominal 90 mile - nautical mile orbit. As a result of the late liftoff, the trans-lunar injection will be a little bit earlier than the flight plan Ground Elapsed Time but we don't have an update on this time yet. We expect that it will be on the order of 8 to 10 minutes early. We'll update that time as we get a later update.
0001739|PAO|We would expect that the time of arrival at the Moon will be approximately the same as the flightplan time in terms of Greenwich Mean Time. The Ground Elapsed Time will be somewhat earlier, and we expect that there will be clock update - a so called clock update - at some point where we make the clocks in Mission Control and aboard the spacecraft agree with the Ground Elapsed Time that they would be showing in the flight plan. The net effect will be that we'll arrive at the Moon in a shorter Ground Elapsed Time - in effect about 2 hours 40 minutes earlier than the flight plan would show, but at the same Greenwich mean time or local time here on Earth, that - that we would have had had we lifted off on time. We're in effect making up the time by speeding up the arrival at the Moon. The spacecraft at translunar injection will be going somewhat faster than a nominal liftoff translunar injection. Consequently, it will arrive at the Moon going slightly faster, and also somewhat earlier, about 2 hours 40 minutes earlier in terms of Ground Elapsed Time. This will also mean that the lunar orbit insertion will require a bit more energy to slow the spacecraft down and get it into lunar orbit. These details of course, will all be worked out in the time that we have before our lunar orbit insertion. And, when we get an updated translunar injection time, we'll pass that along.
0002356|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 24 minutes. Apollo 17 now in an orbit about 90 miles by 93 miles, and everything appears to be nominal aboard the spacecraft and aboard the launch vehicle, Saturn third stage. One additional impact of our late liftoff will be the loss of television coverage for the transposition and docking maneuver. The television coverage will not be possible because the ground track has shifted and we don't have the site coverage that had been expected for television. The translunar injection burn, reigniting the Saturn third stage to put the spacecraft on its trajectory to the Moon, is now scheduled to occur at a Ground Elapsed Time of 3 hours 12 minutes 35 seconds, or roughly 9 minutes earlier than the flight plan time. This again the effect of the late liftoff.
0002511|PAO|And we will be reacquiring Apollo 17 through the Carnarvon Tracking Station at a Ground Elapsed Time of about 52 minutes 20 seconds, roughly 27 minutes from now.
0003202|PAO|This is Apollo Control now 32 minutes after the liftoff of Apollo 17 and we have loss of signal with the spacecraft, we will be reacquiring through the Carnarvon Tracking Station in about 20 minutes. And from the President of the United States we have the following message to the crew of Apollo 17. The message reads: "As you set forth on the final Apollo expedition to the Moon, I want to have my personal best wishes for a successful mission and safe return. I am sure your voyage, your scientific exploration, will be the crowning achievement in a program which has expanded Man's horizons, brought great credit to your country and lifted the spirits of people all over the world. Godspeed to you all." Signed Richard Nixon. The flight Dynamics officer, continuing to process tracking data, following orbital insertions, reports that there is a small amount of out of plane error showing up in the orbit. This it is believed is due to a small error in the instrument unit of the Saturn third stage. However, the orbit is very close to nominal, about 90 nautical miles by 93 nautical miles. And we look very good, both with respect to the spacecraft and with respect to the Saturn third stage which must perform that burn, putting Apollo 17 on its trajectory toward the Moon. At 34 minutes, this is Apollo Control Houston.
0003533|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The postlaunch press conference at Cape Kennedy is scheduled to begin at 12:33 Central Standard Time, 1:33 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. Again, that time 12:33 Central Standard Time, 1:33 Eastern Standard for the post-launch press conference at Cape Kennedy.
0005100|PAO| - Control at 51 minutes into the flight of Apollo 17 and we're standing by to reacquire the spacecraft through the Carnarvon, Australia, tracking station. One of the things the booster engineer will be looking for when we reacquire and get good lock on the data will be the Saturn 3rd stage instrument unit. Looking at one brief bit of data before we lost signal, it appears that one of the four batteries in the instrument unit had a very high current drain on it. We will be looking closely at that to see if it was simply a telemetry problem or if, in fact, that battery does have some problem. And we should be about 15 seconds now from reacquiring.
0005100|CC|17, read you loud and clear.
0005100|LMP|Hey, we're going real well up here, Bob. Have no significant anomalies as yet; and we've just about completed our part of the insertion checklist. Gene has his SCS check yet, and Ron's got some P52 numbers for you. And the only thing I've seen so far is a - some spurious MASTER ALARM without caution and warning that seem to be associated with moving switches on panel 2.
0005100||CC
0005100|LMP|So far, it's been fairly random. Some that I remember is the SECONDARY COOLANT LOOP EVAP switch, the LAMP TEST switch, - see - I think I got one with the TEMP IN AUTO switch. Gene got one doing something. I can't remember exactly what it was.
0005100|CC|Okay - -
0005100|LMP|Probably random.
0005100|CC|- - we copy. Jack, we're standing by for that P52 data. We've only got about a 4-minute - a 5-minute pass here. We'll take the 52 data, and I got a few updates for you.
0005100|LMP|Okay.
0005100|CMP|Okay; 52 data is coming. NOUN 71 is 24 and 30; NOUN 05 is .01; NOUN 93s are plus .080, plus .029, plus .018; and we torqued at 35:25.
0005356|CC|Okay. We copy that. Okay, while we're filling in some here, you might want to know this, Jack. Your sunset and sunrise times in the Launch Checklist are all off by 8 - approximately 8 minutes and 30 seconds. That every - sunset and sunrise will occur about 8 minutes and 30 seconds sooner than in the - in the Launch Checklist. That's an approximate number.
0005420|LMP|Okay, we got you.
0005421|CC|Okay. And on page 2-17 of the Launch Checklist, you're going to want to delete all reference to Honeysuckle AOS and LOS and delete all reference to Canaries AOS and LOS.
0005435|LMP|Wilco.
0005437|CC|And we want to add an Ascension pass; AOS at Ascension, 01 plus 54 plus 00, and Ascension LOS will be 02:00:16.
0005500|LMP|Okay, Bob; you're going to have to repeat that.
0005503|CC|Okay, stand by. Let me give you a page. On 2-17 - let's go Hawaii AOS first of all. On Hawaii AOS, on page 2-17. AOS - -
0005514|LMP|Go.
0005514|CC|- - is 01 plus 17 plus 24. Hawaii LOS, 01 plus 22 plus 49.
0005535|LMP|Gotcha. Now what about the Ascension?
0005541|CC|Okay, here - give you the Ascension again now. AOS, 01 plus 54 plus 00. Ascension LOS will be 02:00:16. Over.
0005605|LMP|Okay, I got those. Hawaii is 01 plus 17 plus 24, and LOS is 01 plus 22 plus 49. And Ascension is AOS, 01 plus 54:00; and LOS, 02 plus 00:16.
0005621|CC|Roger, Jack. Good copy. And booster's looking good down here and you're looking good.
0005627|LMP|Okay, and I'll do a better job of itemizing those switches. We were pressing pretty hard, and I'll - I'll be able to go back and get most of them, I think. And We'll keep an eye on it - on the MASTER ALARMS.
0005640|CC|Roger, Jack. We understand. And I think we copied most of what you said there, and we're working on it.
0005646|CDR|Okay, Bob; other than that MASTER ALARM, all is well on America, and I understand the booster is looking good to you.
0005652|CC|That's affirmative.
0005654|LMP|And, Bob, let me add that not - we did get spurious MASTER ALARMs without switch movement, but many came with switch movements. We've had about seven.
0005704|CC|Okay; understand.
0005710|LMP|That was only after insertion.
0005715|CC|Seven times that your heart doesn't need, huh?
0005720|LMP|Oh, we were paying attention to a sunset that was the biggest - -
0005725|CDR|Sunrise.
0005726|LMP|- - or sunrise or something that we saw. It was the biggest rainbow I'd ever seen.
0005733|CC|Beautiful. We can't wait to hear what you had to say about that - the ignition on the S-II. It sounded pretty spectacular.
0005748|CDR|Bob, just let it be said that that was quite a booster ride. When we get a chance a little later - -
0005755|CC|Roger.
0005755|CDR|- - maybe we'll be able to tell you something.
0005756|CC|We're about ready to lose comm here. You're looking great, guys, and we'll pick you up in Hawaii here shortly.
0005803|CDR|Okay, we're looking at the deserts of Australia right now and, again, everything's good onboard.
0005808|CC|Roger. Pick you up at 01:17:24.
0005812|CDR|Roger.
0005812||STDN (REV 1/2)
0005903|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're coming up now one 1 hour after liftoff for Apollo 17. And as you heard CAPCOM Robert Overmyer reporting to the crew that everything looks good, including the Saturn 3rd stage. Apparently the indication we had of a possible battery problem in the instrument unit nothing more than a bad bit of telemetry there. When the booster engineer got a good hard look at the telemetry on this pass, he reported everything looked good. We are ready at this point to begin the post-launch press conference at Cape Kennedy and we'll switch to Cape Kennedy and stand by for that press conference.
0011725|LMP|Hello, earthlings. We're back with you.
0011727|CC|Roger, Jack. Read you loud and clear; how us?
0011732|LMP|You're loud and clear. And no change systems-wise that I've seen.
0011737|CC|Roger, Jack. Any more MASTER ALARMs?
0011739|LMP|We had one when Ron's - looked like his neck ring hit panel 2. ...
0011744|CC|Okay. Sounds like we had something loose in panel 2, huh?
0011748|LMP|Yes. I don't know - it may be annoying, but so far it doesn't seem to be a problem.
0011753|CC|Roger. Just for your information, everything is looking outstanding and no problems. We're taking a good look at the data here at Hawaii, and we'll make a GO/NO GO decision about 60 seconds after acquisition at Goldstone. But there's nothing right now to lead us to believe that zero opportunity will be required.
0011813|CDR|Okay, Bob, understand that. We are prepared, however. Spacecraft, other than those MASTER ALARMs, is looking very good. We got the docking probe extended. The SCS reference attitude check is complete.
0011830|CC|Roger.
0011838|LMP|Hey, Bob, I just remembered another switch that I think gave us a MASTER ALARM was H2O QUANTITY INDICATOR.
0011845|CC|Roger. Copy that, Jack. H2O QUANTITY INDICATOR.
0011851|CC|Roger we're - 17, we're going to lose you in about 30 seconds. But when you get over the stateside here, we're going to take - take the dump on the data, and we'll read it out real carefully so when you get in TLC we ought to be able to see where that MASTER ALARM glitch is coming in to.
0011908|LMP|Okay, Bob. And - yell at me if you want anything done on the comm with this change in AOS LOS stuff.
0011916|CC|Negative on that right now. We'll see you at 01:28:59 through Goldstone.
0011923|CDR|Okay, 01:28:59, Bob. We'll be there.
0012226|CC|Roger, Gene.
0012248||GOLDSTONE (REV 2)
0012248|CC|17, Houston. We're back with you.
0012251|CDR|Okay, Bob. We're still same as before and ready when you are for TLI.
0012258|CC|Roger.
0012303|LMP|I can see the lights of southern California, Bob.
0012307|CC|Roger, Jack.
0012311|LMP|We're going to be going a little bit south of that area.
0012315|CC|Right. Your ground track looks like it's taking you right up over the mid part of Baja California.
0012320|LMP|Yes, sir; I'll believe that. I'll bet you I can see Ensenada right now.
0012324|CC|Roger.
0012327|CDR|Bob, I expect he'll probably be able to see the lights of Silver City, too.
0012331|LMP|Well, I'm sure going to be looking for them, I'll tell you.
0012340|CC|Jack, just for your information, you'll probably - when you come up a little farther in this orbit here and get over Mexico, you should be able to see all that bad weather that was giving us so much worry and had Tindall and New Orleans and everything all messed up this morning when I went through there. They had a pretty bad line of weather along there.
0012359|LMP|I was assuming it wasn't too bad. I think you made it, didn't you?
0012406|CC|Oh, yeah, I made it, but I had to - you know, I had to work at it. But it's a - we were - I was worried about it getting down as towards MILA there after - you know if we had to scrub and go tomorrow night. Boy, I'm sure glad we got you off tonight.
0012421|LMP|Guess who else is.
0012422|CC|No, I can't - I wouldn't believe that.
0012500|PAO|This is Apollo Control. 1 hour 25 minutes after lift off. During the post-launch press conference at Cape Kennedy, we had a short acquisition with the crew through the Hawaiian tracking station. During that period of conversation, and during that period of monitoring the systems on the spacecraft and the launch vehicle, we found that the situation was essentially unchanged. That is, both vehicles now looking good; the spacecraft and the launch vehicle. And we're progressing toward a normal translunar injection. 1 hour 46 minutes 50 seconds from now. The crew has discussed one unexplained series of events. It appears that when certain switches are cycled or moved on panel 2 which is the main panel in front of them, the center panel of the spacecraft, they're getting a master caution and warning signal. A light comes on - a tone comes on. This is to attract the crews attention that something may be wrong and the normal procedure is then to look at another matrix of lights which would zero them in on the problem. The light - the system or the subsystem or particular area being monitored, or which had the problem would light an individual light. However, when they go to this other matrix of lights, they find that none of them are lighted. This is leading the crew and the flight controllers here in mission control to believe that they are getting an spurious signal to the master caution and warning, when in fact nothing is wrong. We don't have any further explanation for the problem at this point. We will continue to look at the data and particularly during the translunar coast, we think we'll get a good long time to look at things in detail and try to find out precisely what is happening. At this point however, the problem presents no concern and one of the more likely explanations, or possible explanations that's been advanced is perhaps some contamination in some switches.
0013125|CC|Parker can't make it back. He's got to come back on the golfstream. So you might have to have Young on for a while after we do a TLI.
0013135|LMP|Hey, you just wouldn't believe, Bob, the lights you can see in the west right now. It must be absolutely clear.
0013144|CC|Roger, Jack. Sounds spectacular. Jack, people in the room here want to know if you've been down your checklist yet?
0013156|LMP|Oh, we got that out of the way in about 5 minutes. Have we missed something?
0013200|CC|There's a different checklist here we're talking about.
0013205|LMP|(Laughter)
0013205|CDR|If you're talking about the Flight Plan, yes.
0013213|CC|Roger.
0013216|CMP|What a waste.
0013232|LMP|If I'm not mistaken, we must be just south of Arizona now. is that right, Bob?
0013238|CC|That looks real good. Yes, you're over Mexico there, and looks like you're - oh - maybe a hundred miles south of the border there.
0013246|LMP|Okay. I was pretty sure I was looking up in the Phoenix-Tucson complex there.
0013251|CC|Roger. Understand.
0013254|LMP|Beautiful -
0013256|CC|Little better than ... Florida.
0013302|LMP|The west is always that way. I wish it was daylight so we could see Sonora and that country. That's spectacular, I'll bet you.
0013313|CC|Roger. ...
0013315|LMP|Man's field of stars on the Earth is competing with the heavens, Bob.
0013322|CDR|Bob, you're coming through with a large squeal right now in the background.
0013332|CC|Understand ...
0013347|LMP|Okay, I think we got the Gulf Coast showing up now by the band of lights, Bob.
0013354|CC|Roger.
0013358|CDR|Okay, Bob. Assume the booster is still looking good, and we'll be GO for a nominal TLI.
0013404|CC|That's affirmative.
0013406|LMP|Okay.
0013407|CDR|And you're still coming up with a loud squeal.
0013408|CC|Roger. ...
0013419|CC|17, how do you read?
0013421|LMP|Would you believe we're just south of Houston now, Bob?
0013517|CC|17, are you receiving Houston now?
0013520|CDR|All right, Bob. You came up unreadable with the squeal that time.
0013524|CC|Am I still squealing? This is Houston.
0013527|CDR|That's affirm. You're very loud, almost unreadable with the squeal. Bob, why don't you give us the short count?
0013543|CC|Geno, don't change anything. We think it's a ground site situation here, and just stand by.
0013549|CDR|I believe it's in the VHF, Bob.
0013618|CDR|Okay, Bob. I'm not sure exactly where we are, but I'm looking out - to an awful lot of horiz - lights on the horizon out there at 12 o'clock, and an awful lot of lightning in the clouds out there.
0013631|CC|Roger. I - we show you just about over the middle of the Gulf. Looking ahead, you're probably seeing the very southern tip of Florida there.
0013639|CDR|It looks like almost the entire Florida peninsula has got lights - out by in it somewhere.
0013649|CC|Roger. How does my comm sound to you now, Gene?
0013652|CDR|Okay, give us a quick short count.
0013654|CC|Roger. Short count follows: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; short count out.
0013701|CDR|Bob, you're all right now.
0013703|CC|Okay.
0013705|CDR|And can you give us a feel for what the final weather was at the Cape - at launch?
0013713|CC|Yes. Let me get that for you. The reason why we had that problem on the comm is we just handed over from Texas to MILA, and we're - and you're going through MILA now. And it's great. So we have a little problem with our Texas site.
0013725|CDR|Okay.
0013727|CC|The television coverage had you all the way through staging very well on - and the S-II ignition. Then, you went right behind a cloud for a while, but they were tracking you pretty well.
0013739|CDR|Okay.
0013741|CC|They also - cut in for about a half minute or so and showed a view of the crowd in just the available light from the booster, and it stood out pretty well.
0013753|LMP|Okay, Bob. We're going right over Florida now, looking down at Miami. A beautiful view of the Keys all lit up, and I just saw a shooting star right over Miami.
0013804|CC|Roger.
0013815|LMP|That's a very, very fine view of Miami. Hard to believe.
0013821|CC|I'll bet they sat there and watched you go.
0013843|LMP|Looks like we're right over the Bahamas now, Bob.
0013847|CC|Roger. I'll buy that.
0013857|LMP|Well, I'm not easily impressed, Bob. But I'm certainly impressed by this one.
0013901|CC|Roger. What's the CMP doing? We haven't heard much from him. is - is he at the other window?
0013907|CMP|He's crawling around looking for things down in the LEB.
0013910|CC|(Laughter) Okay. They won't let you have a window tonight, huh, Ron?
0013913|CMP|No, I'll catch one here pretty quick.
0013924|CC|Just a reminder, if you haven't already done it. There is no need to unstow the TV, because due to this late launch, there's just no site available.
0013931|CDR|Okay, Bob. We're not going to unstow it.
0013936|LMP|Bob, I don't - I guess there's no site available for some time, is that correct?
0013942|CC|That's affirmative. And if I can pull one of you guys away from a window, I've got a TLI plus 90 pad.
0013946|LMP|Oh, I'd love to copy that. Just a minute.
0014128|LMP|Hello, Houston; Apollo 17. How do you read?
0014131|CC|17, Houston. Go ahead.
0014133|LMP|Okay. Lost you there for a minute. We had good signal strength all through that, so I figured it was your problem.
0014139|CC|Roger. We're just waiting here - You ready for the pad?
0014143|LMP|We were calling you, and you missed us. So you might think about that. Ready for the pad.
0014147|CC|Okay. It's a TLI plus 90, SPS/G&N; 66953; minus 0.59, plus 1.88; ignition time, 004:40:01.48; minus 0351.8, minus 0000.1, plus 3378.2; roll is 180, 073, 003; NOUN 94 [sic] is - HA is not applicable, HA is plus 0020.1; 3396.4, 4:50, 3380.8; sextant star is number 11, that's 11, 342.4, 32.3. Stand by. 17, Houston; are you still reading me?
0014333|LMP|Hey, Houston, if you read, we're reading you. Got you all the way through the trunnion on sextant star.
0014341|CC|Okay, we'll have to wait and pick you up at Ascension. We just had a keyhole pass at Bermuda, and a little bit of a pass at Vanguard.
0014349|LMP|Okay, I'll wait for you to finish that, and on the readback. Okay.
0014354|CC|That's affirmative. Stand by. We've got Vanguard, I can continue on with - after trunnion, the bore-sight Star is not applicable, Jack. NOUN 61, plus 13.29, minus 032.00; 1099.2, 34904; GET of .05G, 024:38:09. Want to read back that much of the pad, Jack?
0014441|LMP|Okay, Bob. It's TLI plus 90 pad, SPS/G&N; 66953; minus 0.59, plus 1.88; 004:40:01.48; minus 0351.8, minus four zeros 1, plus 3378.2; 180, 073, 003; HA is NA; plus 0020.1; 3396.4, 4:54, 3380.8; 11, 342.4, 32.3. Boresight is NA; plus 13.29, minus 032.00; 1099.2, 34904; 024:38:09. Over.
0014549|CC|Roger, Jack. Good readback except burn time is 4:50 and not 4:54. And we'll be losing you here in about a minute, so wait on the rest of that pad. Just a reminder for Ron, we'll be standing by at Ascension for the next gyro torquing and we, might have a drift update on the IMU there,
0014617|LMP|Okay, he copied that. And we'll wait for the rest of the pad.
0014621|CC|Okay.
0014622|LMP|Burn time was 4:50 - I think that was when you started to cut out.
0014627|CC|Roger.
0014810|CC|17, this is Houston through ARIA. How do you read? Over.
0014833|CC|17, Houston. Through ARIA, how do you read? Over.
0014850|CC|17, Houston. Through ARIA, how do you read?
0014931|CC|17, Houston. How do you read through ARIA?
0015033|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 1 hour 51 minutes. We're getting good telemetry data from Apollo 17 through one of the Apollo Range Instrumented Aircraft out over the Atlantic Ocean. Apollo 17 moving across the Atlantic now towards Africa. And on the next revolution, at about this point, the spacecraft will be on its way to the Moon during the Trans-lunar injection maneuver. Ignition for that burn is scheduled to occur 1 hour 21 minutes from now. During launch the flight surgeon monitoring heart rates on the 3 crewmen recorded peak heart rates of 130 for the Commander Gene Cernan, also 130 for Command Module pilot, Ron Evans, and 115 for Lunar Module pilot, Jack Schmitt. We should be reacquiring the command service module and reestablishing voice communications with the astronauts in about 2 minutes from now through Ascension.
0015347|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We should be acquiring the spacecraft through Ascension in about 5 seconds and reestablishing voice communications with the crew.
0015404|CC|17, Houston.
0015407|LMP|Go ahead.
0015408|CC|Roger. You're back with us. I'll finish up that TLI plus 90 pad so we can talk a little here if you want.
0015414|LMP|Go ahead.
0015415|CC|Okay. Set stars are Sirius and Rigel; RALIGN is 318; 148; 358. There'll be no ullage. Okay. Down at the bottom of the pad we've got the P37 for lift-off plus 9. GET is 009:00; DELTA-Vt, 4897; longitude, minus 175; GET of 400K, 033:49. Over.
0015502|LMP|Okay, Bob. Zero - Sirius and Rigel; 318; 148; 358; no ullage; 009:00; 4897; minus 175; 033:49. Over.
0015519|CC|Okay, Jack. Good readback.
0015526|LMP|Okay, Bob. We had - as usual - up here (laughter) a spectacular sunrise, and Gene wants to talk to you.
0015533|CDR|I got some numbers on Ron's P52 for you, Bob.
0015536|CC|Okay; standing by to copy. Go ahead.
0015538|CDR|Okay. NOUN 71 were stars 22 and 24; NOUN 05 are all balls; NOUN 93s are all minus. They're 00.037, 00.007, and 00.021. That's minus 37, minus 07, and minus 21; and they were torqued at 01:51:40.
0015605|CC|Okay. We copy.
0015620|LMP|Bob, we're over - what might be - intermediate to low stratus that have a very strong crenulation pattern - pulling out some geological terms here. I don't think I've ever seen anything like it flying.
0015638|CC|Roger.
0015638|LMP|Looks like about a north-south lineation with a very strong crinkling, roughly east-west.
0015647|CC|Roger. Copy that; that's interesting. You know, you're just directly over that South Atlantic area. Your - you - your path just kind of kept you going right between the - Africa and South America, right dead center all the way.
0015739|CC|And, 17, just for your information, we've searched all the data we can, and we cannot find anything wrong with the spacecraft or the booster at all. Everything is looking real fine, and the only problem in the air is that - those MASTER ALARMs that you have reported - we're not able to tie in anything common yet to any of those things either.
0015758|CDR|Okay, Bob. We have not had any for - quite some time, I think, since the last time we talked to you about them.
0015805|CC|Roger. Understand. We'll probably get a good workout on that after TLI and try and track it down one more.
0015810|CDR|Okay. But, also, we have not really been doing much switching since the insertion checklist was complete, either.
0015816|CC|Roger. Understand. It's got you glued to the windows, I guess, huh?
0015823|CDR|They are interesting; I'll say that.
0015826|LMP|Well, I certainly am, Bob, and - again there's a big - a fairly continuous intermediate cloud deck, I think. And it has patterns comparable to what I've seen on pictures of ice floes.
0015840|CC|Roger. Understand.
0015840|LMP|And - of pack ice; I should say pictures of pack ice in the Antarctic.
0015856|CC|17, Houston. We've got two questions concerning the MASTER ALARMs. One, do you get the MASTER ALARM on the LEB also; and, two, do you get the tone with the MASTER ALARM?
0015910|LMP|We did get the tones. The MASTER ALARMs were on both - panel 1 and panel 3. I can't tell you about the LEB right now. Maybe Ron can.
0015920|CMP|No, I didn't pay that much attention.
0015923|CC|Okay.
0015924|CDR|Hey, Bob, there was something interesting I wanted to get around to tell you. The - MISSION TIMER down in the LEB, when Ron went down there to get things squared away, was about 15 seconds or so behind all the other clocks.
0015945|CC|Roger. We copy that.
0015947|CDR|Okay; and we reset it - re synced it - and it's been running okay. I don't know whether that's a clue to anything or not, but apparently it happened either during launch - or somewhere before we got down there right after insertion.
0020002|CC|Okay, we're going to lose you here in about 9 seconds. You are GO is looking great, and we'll work on it, and if you get another MEV, will you check the LEB for us?
0020011|CDR|Yes sir, I sure will do, Bob. We'll see you. What's our next AOS?
0020016|CC|Stand by. Carnarvon at 2:25.
0020020|CDR|Thank you.
0020041|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Apollo 17 now over the horizon from the Ascension site - will be reacquiring in about 25 minutes through Carnarvon. And, as you heard CAPCOM Robert Overmyer advising the crew, we've been getting a good look at all the data, and spacecraft, launch vehicles, look fine. No discernable problems. Gene Cernan did mention one anomaly and that was the mission timer. One of the - one of the numerous clocks aboard the spacecraft which was running about 15 minutes [sic] slow - and Cernan said it appeared that it happened either during the launch phase or shortly before they got down to take a look at it in the lower equipment bay. No explanation for that one at this point. And we show now 1 minute - 1 hour, rather - 11 minutes until ignition for the translunar injection maneuver, the burn with the Saturn 3rd stage which will place Apollo 17 on its trajectory toward the Moon. Ignition time and still holding at about 3 hours 12 minutes 35 seconds Ground Elapsed Time, and that burn will be about 5 minutes 45 seconds in duration, but we don't have the final calculated time from the flight dynamics officer which will undoubtedly vary somewhat from the premission Flight Plan time. At 2 hours 2 minutes this is Apollo Control Houston.
0022510|PAO|This is Apollo Control, at 2 hours 25 minutes. Apollo 17 now approaching the west coast of Australia. And we'll be reacquiring the spacecraft in about 35 seconds. During this pass over Carnarvon, we expect to pass up the first set of numbers to the crew that they'll use in the Translunar Injection Burn, to put them on their trajectory toward the Moon. That maneuver is scheduled to begin at 47 minutes from now. And we have acquisition of signal a little bit early.
0022530|CC|17, Houston. How are you doing?
0022540|CC|Stand by. It's Carnarvon at 02:25-
0022544|CDR|Thank you.
0022546|CDR|I see you're trying.
0022548|CC|17, Houston. How are you doing?
0022551|LMP|Well, we're pretty good. You're wavery here a little bit on signal strength.
0022555|CC|Okay. We've got a TLI pad any time you're ready to copy it, Jack.
0022603|LMP|Goodness; okay, let me get rid of something here. Ron, I'm putting that right underneath you.
0022607|CC|And, guys, we'd like P00 and ACCEPT, please.
0022613|LMP|Okay.
0022613|CC|You'll get a CSM state vector if you'll give us P00 and ACCEPT.
0022618|CDR|Got P00 and ACCEPT.
0022620|LMP|Okay. Let me have my favorite pad.
0022622|CC|Okay. Here's the TLI pad. Time base 6 at 3:02:57; 180, 312, 000; 5:51; DELTA-Vc is 10359.6, 35582; 000, 345, 040; extraction will be at 300, 165, 320; 312.0, 306.0, 57:10, yaw is 0; ejection time, 4 plus 39 plus 00. Over.
0022740|LMP|Okay, Houston. Here's your TLI pad. 3:02:57; 180, 312, 000; 5:51; 10359.6, 35582; 000, 345, 040; 300, 165, 320; 312.0, 306.0 57:10, 000; ejection time, 4 plus 39 plus 00.
0022822|CC|Good readback, Jack; and we'd like OMNI Charlie, and it's your computer, and you've got your state vector.
0022832|LMP|Okay. You've got OMNI Charlie. And, Bob, we had almost a completely weather-free pass over Africa and Madagascar. And the scenery - both aesthetically and geologically - was something like I've never seen before, for sure.
0022856|CC|Roger.
0022859|LMP|We got odds and ends on the tape and quite a bit on the film.
0022904|CC|Roger; good show. Are you saying that you didn't have any weather over that southern Africa there?
0022910|LMP|Not very much. Barely broken clouds in some places. Most of the countryside was clear.
0022917|CC|Roger.
0022919|LMP|There were - patterns - like I haven't even seen in textbooks. Maybe I haven't been looking enough, but some of the desert and grassland patterns were - had the appearance of ice crystals almost, except on a megascale, if you - have ever looked at ice crystals in sand.
0022936|CC|Roger.
0022945|LMP|Or, better yet, ice crystals on your car window when you - get out early in the morning up in northern areas.
0022955|CC|Roger. And just be advised, we'll be standing by for the GO/NO GO for PYRO ARM when we get to Hawaii, and we'll be giving you a GO for TLI about that time.
0023006|LMP|Okay; and we'll be ready.
0023016|CC|And, Ron, in - on the Launch Checklist, on 2-25, on the manual and nominal S-IVB TLI-1, add 34 degrees on the nominal pad for all the pitch angles; and on the manual pad, add 34.5 degrees to all the pitch angles, and you'll have it right.
0023041|CMP|Okay, Bob. You ... - -
0023043|CC|And - -
0023043|CMP|- - let me get set. That's - okay, we'll just add 34 to the nominal and 34.5 to all the manual ones ... - -
0023049|CC|And you'll want to do that on your cue card also, Ron.
0023052|CMP|Yes, that's affirm.
0023100|CC|And we're about ready to LOS; we'll see you at Hawaii.
0023107|CDR|Okay, Bob, we'll see you - -
0023108|CC|02 plus 50 at Hawaii.
0023111|CDR|Okay, 50. And we'll be into our TLI checklist, and - we'll be ready for that PYRO ARM.
0023117|CC|Okay.
0023232|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We'll be reacquiring the spacecraft in about 18 minutes. And during that passover at Carnarvon, and we've passed up the numbers to the crew they'll use in the Translunar Injection maneuver. The burn is targeted to last 5 minutes 51 seconds with a change in velocity of some 10,359 feet per second. Accelerating Apollo 17 to the required speed to get it into an orbit that will intercept the Moon. And the time of ignition, 300 - 03:12:35 and we're showing an ejection time of 04:39. The transposition and docking maneuver which preceeds ejection, is somewhat fluid in that it's done when the crew and mission control are ready, following Translunar Injection. However, from the projected time for ejection, it would appear that transposition and docking will occur about 25 to 30 minutes ahead of the nominal Flight Plan time. And we're now 39 minutes away from the scheduled ignition for translunar injection. At 2 hours 34 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.
0024900|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 2 hours 49 minutes. We're standing by now to acquire radio contact with Apollo 17 through Hawaii. During this Hawaiian pass we're getting another good look at spacecraft and launch vehicle systems. The last look we had through Carnarvon everything looked very good. Flight Director, Gene Kranz, going over the status for these flight controllers observed that there appeared to be no problems that would interfere with TLI and we expect to have a normal translunar injection, about 23 minutes from now as Apollo 17 completes its state-side pass and moves out over the Atlantic Ocean at the start of its third revolution.

0025255|CC|17 - -
0025255|LMP|And, Bob, in case you're interested, there - all through the nightside pass here - there's a - quite a strong - well - stronger than I would have ever expected - horizon glow off to the north. I suspect that, I think Gene said a while ago that it's around on his side also.
0025312|CC|Roger. Guys , I've got the word you wanted to hear; you are GO for TLI - you're GO for the Moon.
0025320|CDR|Okay, Robert. Understand. America and Challenger with their S-IVB are GO for TLI.
0025326|CC|That's affirmative.
0025329|CDR|You're a sweet talker.
0025332|CC|We try to please here, Gene.
0025340|LMP|You know, somehow, Bob, I knew you were going to say that - we were GO - and that you try to please.
0025347|CC|We've been working together too long, huh?
0025354|LMP|Not long enough, yet.
0025448|CC|And, 17; Houston. You're about 1 minute from LOS, and we'll pick you up at Goldstone at about 3 hours and 00 minutes; and that's only a couple of minutes prior to time base 6 start.
0025502|CDR|Okay, Bob. We'll be with you.
0025504|CC|Roger.
0025507|LMP|Bob, that glow is actually above the horizon, just in case you're curious. I can see - stars below the top of the glow - down closer to the Earth.

0030342|CC|Roger, Gene.
0030421|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 3 hours 4 minutes. We are now some 8 minutes away from ignition. Everything's looking good for the translunar injection maneuver, the combined S-IVB Saturn third stage and the spacecraft with an orbital weight of 308,298 pounds at the start of this maneuver.
0030615|LMP|Comm check, Bob.
0030621|CC|17, Houston; go ahead.
0030623|LMP|I was just checking with you; you're so quiet down there, we almost forgot you were there.
0030627|CC|Roger. Don't want to forget me. We're just watching everything; we can't find anything wrong, so we're just trying to keep quiet here.
0030637|CDR|Okay, Bob. We're watching the S-IVB tanks pressurize.
0030641|CC|Roger.
0030650|LMP|You ought to look for the good things rather than the bad.
0030655|CC|Well, that's good when we don't find anything wrong.
0030659|LMP|Can't agree more.
0030732|CC|17, the chilldown is in progress, and the tank pressures are looking good.
0030738|CDR|Okay, Bob; looking good here.
0030937|CC|17, Houston. You are GO at 3 minutes prior to ignition. You're looking good, and you're going to - we're going to have A - ARIA coverage all the way through the burn until Ascension.
0030951|CDR|Roger; understand, Bob. 57:10, ORDEAL OPERATE -
0031038|PAO|And we're coming up now on 2 minutes until ignition. This burn, again, will be a 5 minute 51 second maneuver. The S-IVB engine, delivering about 225,000 pounds of thrust, and it will be increasing the spacecraft velocity in the current state of about 25,000 feet per second up to about 35,585 feet per second.
0031101|CDR|We're in average G.
0031105|CC|Roger. We confirm it.

0031119|CC|Roger.
0031137|PAO|And booster reports the ullage engines are on. This is to settle the propellants in the S-IVB prior to ignition. We are at 53 seconds from ignition.
0031204|CC|17, you're looking great on the final status check here, and you're GO for TLI.
0031217|PAO|20 seconds now to ignition and we're maintaining communications with the spacecraft through one of the ARIA, Apollo range instrumented aircraft.

0031229|PAO|10 seconds.
0031240|CDR|The lights on and we have ignition.
0031246|PAO|And, very faintly we copy the crew reporting S-IVB ignition and that's confirmed by the telemetry and booster reports the thrust looks good on the S-IVB.
0031257|CC|17, Houston. You're looking good, and the thrust is GO.
0031302|CDR|Bob, you're down in the mud, but we're GO onboard at 20 seconds.
0031306|CC|Roger.
0031311|PAO|And telemetry data from the Saturn instrument unit shows the velocity increasing up now to 26,000 feet per second, beginning to climb ever more rapidly.
0031321|LMP|... antenna.
0031324|PAO|This burn was initiated at an altitude of about 97 nautical miles above Earth, and when finished, the spacecraft will be at about 150 miles above Earth, and on its way to the Moon, some 213,000 miles nautical miles away.
0031341|CDR|One minute, Houston in the blind, and we're GO.
0031345|CC|Roger, Gene. We can barely hear you through the ARIA, but you're GO.
0031354|LMP|You have reasonable signal strength, but you are unreadable.
0031410|PAO|Very weak voice communications and booster says the data is now static but at last look everything looked normal.
0031415|CDR|Everything's GO at 1:30.
0031422|CDR|Confirm a PU shift, and GO at 1:45.
0031434|CC|17, Houston, We can confirm PU shift, and you are GO.
0031455|PAO|That was CAPCOM Robert Overmyer confirming to the crew that our data showed the Saturn shifting its propellant utilization for a most efficient utilization of the propellant.
0031510|CDR|Okay, Houston, 2:30 - in the blind - we're still GO.
0031514|CC|Roger, 17. You're GO; looking great.
0031518|CDR|Okay, Bob. Got that. Understand we're GO from the ground; and it's a good ride, although it's rumbling around a little bit.
0031524|CC|Okay.
0031531|PAO|Coming up now 3 minutes into the burn and velocity approaching 30,000 feet per second.
0031541|CDR|Three minutes, and we are GO.
0031545|CC|Roger, Gene.
0031553|CDR|Bob, we're going to TLI right through sunrise.
0031558|CC|Roger; understand.
0031601|PAO|Gene Cernan reporting the TLI burn has taken them out of darkness and into sunrise now.
0031606|CDR|Okay, 3:30 is GO. We have - 17 is GO at 3:30.
0031610|PAO|And, we're showing a velocity of 30,463 feet per second.
0031616|CC|Roger, 17.
0031631|PAO|Apollo 17 now about 107 nautical miles above Earth and continuing to climb ever more rapidly.
0031705|PAO|4 minutes and 30 seconds now and everything continuing to look good. Apollo 17 at a velocity of 32,000 feet per second.
0031711|CDR|Okay, Bob, 17 is GO at 4:30. You're still unreadable.
0031716|CC|Roger. How do you read me? You are GO, by the way.
0031723|CDR|Okay, we got you that time. Understand we're GO on the ground, and we're still GO here, and we're TLI-ing right through sunrise.
0031729|CC|Understand.
0031741|PAO|5 minutes now, less than 1 minute to go, and booster engineer reports that we're very close to the nominal predicted shutdown time.
0031801|CC|17, Houston. Your burn time is nominal.
0031805|CDR|Roger. Understand burn time, nominal.
0031811|PAO|Shutdown time now in about 21 seconds. Showing a velocity of 33,000 feet per second. Altitude now approaching 150 miles.
0031835|LMP|Cutoff at 52.
0031839|CMP|(Laughter) Did you read the DSKY?
0031842|CC|We don't have the DSKY. You have to read it to us, Ron.
0031846|CMP|Okay. VI is - I got a 00 and a 00 and NOUN 95 VI is 35573 - is a plus 9.
0031904|CDR|And, Bob, the EMS is minus - EMS is minus 19.4, minus 19.4.
0031913|CC|Roger. We copy that.
0031917|CDR|And it was an auto cut-off - auto cut-off on time.
0031921|CC|Understand a guided cut-off on time. Looking great.
0031927|CDR|And I am watching tank pressures - are venting, the tanks are venting.
0031933|CC|Understand. The tanks are venting.
0032004|PAO|And, we're still getting communications through the Apollo Range Instrumented Aircraft. We'll be picking up through Ascension shortly, at which time we'd expect the communications to improve, the noise to drop off. From Gene Cernan's report, also from the reports from Ron Evans, it appeared that that translunar injection was extremely close to nominal. The crew read a cutoff time of 5 minutes 52 seconds. The premaneuver prediction was 5 minutes 51 seconds. And the cutoff velocity appeared to be very, very close to the planned normal. Booster engineer, Frank Van Rosilier reports the booster cutoff appeared to be exactly normal.
0032143|PAO|And booster engineer now predicting that the maneuver to separation attitude will begin in about 3 hours 33 minutes 27 seconds.
0032256|LMP|Okay, Houston, how do you read?
0032302|CC|17, Houston. We'd like OMNI Delta.
0032306|LMP|Okay. I picked it up a little bit. How do you read now?
0032309|CC|Read you loud and clear.
0032311|LMP|Okay. I hope you got all that. It was a beautiful burn, right through sunrise. Did you get the numbers?
0032317|CC|Yes, we copied your VI and your EMS numbers, and we've got a number for you. Maneuver start time will be at 3 plus 33 plus 27 -
0032349|LMP|Okay, we got you. Maneuver at 03:33:27-
0032357|CC|That's affirmative, Jack.
0032402|LMP|You guys didn't tell us we couldn't see anything going through the sunrise.
0032409|CC|(Laughter) Roger.
0032508|CC|17, Houston. We're making plans here for a spacecraft SEP time of 03 plus 43.
0032522|LMP|03 plus 43. Roger.
0032736|CC|17, Houston. We're copying cabin press of 5.9 this time.
0032742|LMP|Roger. We - we just got it, Bob.
0032745|CC|Okay.
0032746|LMP|Thank you.
0032942|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 3 hours 30 minutes. The flight dynamics officer has just reported that initial tracking, following the translunar injection burn, shows the spacecraft to be on a very nominal trajectory, and a relatively small midcourse correction indicated at this time. The pre-burn prediction on that first midcourse correction was around 5 feet per second and we expect that that will be updated as we get additional tracking following the burn.
0033028|PAO|In about 3 minutes the spacecraft should - the launch vehicle should be - begin maneuvering to the proper attitude for separation and we're predicting separation to occur at about 3 hours 43 minutes - or about 13 minutes from now.
0033204|LMP|Frame 65 for the LMPs mag November November.
0033328|PAO|About 10 seconds now until the Saturn third stage begins maneuvering into the proper separation attitude.
0033358|PAO|And booster engineer reports from telemetry data that the booster has begun maneuvering into the proper attitude for spacecraft separation.
0033421|CDR|Okay. We - we are maneuvering, Houston.
0033425|CC|Roger. We're watching it.
0033452|LMP|Now we've got a few very bright particles or fragments or something that go drifting by as we maneuver.
0033502|CC|Roger. Understand.
0033507|CMP|There's a whole bunce of big ones on my window down there - just bright.
0033510|LMP|It looks like the Fourth of July out of Ron's window.
0033517|LMP|Yes. Now you can see some of them in shape. They're very Jagged, angular fragments that are tumbling.
0033525|CC|Roger. They look like fluid of some sort?
0033528|LMP|Not to me. They look like pieces of something.
0033533|CC|Roger.
0033534|LMP|They're very bright.
0033536|CC|Jack, we'd like OMNI Charlie.
0033704|LMP|Bob, for the most part, these fragments are not - or are tumbling at a very slow rate. I tried a couple pictures of them - different settings. You may get an idea of what, at least, the patterns look like.
0033720|CC|Roger. I've got you. We're all ears on these fragments if you think you can figure out what they might be.
0033725|LMP|Well, you know I - I don't know. There are a number of possibilities. If you had some kind of a - I got the impression maybe they were curved a little bit, as if they might be - off the side of the S-IVB. And that's a wild guess - -
0033740|CMP|Okay. RCS LOGIC is ... --
0033743|LMP|- - ice chunks, possibly. Or maybe there's paint coming off of it.
0033746|CC|Roger. I noticed on one trip up the elevator last weak near one of the flags. I thought it was on the S-II, but it might have been on the S-IVB. Looked like it was peeling. Maybe that's what you've got.
0033757|CC|And the S-IVB maneuver is complete.
0033758|CMP|... on MAIN A.
0033803|CMP|Okay. We'll set the old clock.
0033804|LMP|Okay. And the - with the maneuver complete, the fragment field is essentially static, except for very slight tumbling within the fragments.
0033813|CC|Roger. Copy that.
0033815|LMP|Every once in a while, a fragment of considerably higher velocity than the others goes across my window. But that's very rare.
0033823|CC|Roger.
0033834|CMP|Hey, that's that field of view I saw out my window Jack, do you see it now?
0033839|LMP|Yes.
0033843|LMP|And, Bob. At least, there - there's no apparent relative motion between fragments.
0033851|CC|Roger. Understand.
0033854|LMP|I'll take two pictures about a minute apart if I can. And it'll be Frame 70.
0033905|CC|Okay. Frame 70.
0033907|CDR|And, Bob. This is Geno. My impression is that they are - flat, flake-like particles. Some may be 6 inches across. And, although there's no relative motion between the two, most of them seem to be twinkling. And I think, for the most part, they're all moving away from us.
0033931|CC|Roger, Gene. Thank you.
0033948|CMP|Okay. We've got 0180 and 0 on the old thumbwheels.
0033953|LMP|Okay.
0033956|CC|Roger, Ron.
0034006|CMP|Okay. TRANS CONTROL is ARMED.
0034007|LMP|... two ARMED.
0034009|CMP|CONTROLLER number 2 is ARMED.
0034011|LMP|... SECS LOGIC ...
0034014|CMP|Okay. SECS LOGIC is CLOSED; SECS ARM are CLOSED; LOGIC POWER is ON.
0034020|LMP|Okay.
0034025|CC|17, Houston. You have a GO for T&D.
0034030|CDR|Okay. A GO for T&D.
0034051|CMP|Okay. We'll ARM the PYROs. And we'll hit the GDC ALIGN.
0034113|CMP|And maneuver's complete. Okay 0180 and 0, on the GDC. No. It's just ... it's kind of diddling.
0034131|CMP|Okay. DELTA-V in NORMAL.
0034155|CMP|S-IVB, okay. Okay, switches are all set.
0034206|LMP|Okay; 59:30.
0034209|CMP|Okay. Let's start the DET.
0034212|CMP|Tickity-tick-tickity.
0034213|CDR|Houston. We're running at 59:30.
0034215|CC|Roger.
0034219|CMP|Okay.
0034225|CMP|Okay. That's LAUNCH VEHICLE SEP, push button.

0034240|CMP|Next?
0034243|CDR|SEPARATION, Houston.
0034244|CMP|Okay, check the covers. Okay. And check the other ones off.
0034252|LMP|They're all ..,
0034253|CMP|Okay, I'm going to start the - My gosh, look at the junk! Okay; there's 15 seconds. Pitch her up. Okay, we'll PROCEED on the - -
0034303|LMP|... normal ...
0034311|CMP|Okay, we've already PROCEEDed, Jack.
0034323|CMP|Okay, we've checked her out.
0034326|CDR|Houston, we're right in the middle of a snowstorm (laughter).
0034329|CC|Roger. And we'd like OMNI Delta.
0034333|CMP|Hey, look at that burst. It's going to be bright as all get out.
0034335|CDR|And there goes one of the SLA panels.
0034342|CMP|Yes.
0034351|CMP|We're not there yet. Long ways to go yet. It's on the other side of the Earth, if the simulator's any good.
0034407|PAO|Apollo 17 now in the process of turning around after having separated, blown the pyrotechnic charges that separates the spacecraft from the Saturn third stage.
0034408|CMP|Oh, man!
0034409|CDR|There goes another SLA panel, Houston, going the other way.
0034410|CMP|Yes.
0034411|CDR|I've - -
0034412|LMP|Hey, there's the booster!
0034419|CC|Roger. Bet you never saw the SLA panels on the simulator.
0034424|CDR|No, but we've got the booster and is she pretty. Challenger's just sitting in her nest.
0034429|CC|Roger. We'd like OMNI Bravo, now, Jack.
0034438|CMP|Okay, we'll plus-X it. We'll see the - oh, you can't see ... Okay. Oh, I can't see my COAS.
0034453|LMP|And, Houston, some of the particles going by the window - -
0034456|CMP|Okay, did you change the DAC?
0034459|CDR|- - were obvious enough - fairly obvious to me - paint.
0034500|CC|Okay. We'll buy that.
0034510|CMP|Okay. There it is. Okay, did you change the PAC? Got ATT l/rate 2?
0034532|LMP|Okay, Houston, you want the high gain?
0034540|CC|Roger. We're standing by for it, and the angles as published on L/3-3 should be good.
0034547|LMP|Okay.
0034616|CMP|Okay, it's flying pretty good.
0034637|CMP|Okay, we're in REACQ here.
0034657|LMP|Houston, how do you read? We don't have a very good knock - lockon here in REACQ.
0034701|CC|Roger, Jack. We're reading you pretty good - voice.
0034714|LMP|Okay. It looks like it's improving. It dropped off - signal strength dropped off, and now it's picking up again.
0034720|CC|Roger.
0034724|CC|We're getting good signal now, Jack.
0034732|CC|Jack, the high gain is looking good.
0034733|LMP|Oh, okay.
0034738|CMP|I'm guessing. I don't know - about a hundred ... - -
0034740|LMP|That's good news. It seemed to smoo - slew very smoothly, so it looks all right.
0034753|CC|Roger, Jack.
0034754|CMP|ATT 1/RATE 2?
0034825|CDR|I can't tell you too much, Bob, from the center seat other than Captain America is very intent on getting Challenger at the moment.
0034833|CC|Roger. I can believe that.
0034841|CMP|Yes, I'm coming in a little slow, but we've got plenty of time.
0034905|PAO|Ron Evans now at the controls of America. Now moving in for the docking with lunar module Challenger.
0034913|LMP|Okay, Houston. While we're moving in here, I can see a few chunks of that platy material, possibly paint, down in the SLA sort of bouncing around between the S-IVB and the LM.
0034932|CC|Roger.
0034938|LMP|But, so far, LM looks very clean. Can't see anything abnormal from this view yet.
0034948|CC|Okay.
0034959|CMP|Isn't it, though? That thing is really stable out there.
0035031|LMP|Yes. Can you see it at all, Gene?
0035136|LMP|Got one little chunk coming out - it just came out of the SLA, and it's spinning along the long axis, and it looks very stable.
0035146|CC|Roger.
0035148|LMP|Every once in a while, a small particle flies off of it though.
0035153|CC|How big of a chunk are you talking about, Jack?
0035157|LMP|Say again?
0035159|CC|How big an item are you talking about?
0035206|LMP|Oh, I - reference to the thrusters, about the same diameter as the thruster on the LM.
0035213|CC|Oh, Roger.
0035216|LMP|That's how long it was, and about - oh, a fifth that thick or that wide.
0035223|CC|Roger.
0035224|LMP|And I don't think - I don't think it's more than a quarter of an inch or maybe even less thick.
0035236|CDR|That same particle, Bob, came by and as it went spinning, it was throwing off pieces of itself - radially out.
0035244|CC|Roger. We copy.
0035248|CDR|There's a small one come floating by and it looked like flakes. And I think I caught three of the four SLA panels going as we were maneuvering. I've got one out the hatch window now. It's quite a ways out.
0035310|CC|Roger.
0035311|CDR|It's tumbling in all three axes.
0035316|LMP|And I saw the fourth one out my side, so we saw them all.
0035332|LMP|Area around the two spacecraft is cleaned up pretty well by now. There are just a few fragments moving around.
0035407|CMP|Now she's coming in.
0035423|PAO|The crew of Apollo 17 describing what appear to be paint or possibly ice flaking off the Saturn 3rd stage. But somewhat puzzling at this point is just exactly what the flakes or particles that they're describing might be. And Apollo 17 in the process of docking with the lunar module. Preparatory to extracting the LM from the Saturn 3rd stage. This occuring at some 5,300 nautical miles from Earth. And we're watching the spacecraft velocity drop off rapidly as that altitude increases rapidly. The velocity which at the translunar injection cutoff was around 35,000 feet per second down to about 22,000.
0035458|LMP|Rover looks in good shape, so far.
0035526|CC|Roger, Jack. Can you see down on that quad? is that what you're looking at?
0035532|LMP|Yes, I'm looking right at it. And I got a good view of the MESA top anyway. It's pretty well covered, but it looks all right also.
0035546|CC|Roger.
0035549|LMP|All the antennas look good; thruster quads all look great. I could see all four of them a minute ago.
0035557|CMP|Okay, about 10 feet there, Gene. Stand by for a ... on the barber pole.
0035614|CDR|Okay.
0035641|CMP|All right; in good shape.
0035652|CMP|About now.
0035703|CDR|Capture, Houston.
0035704|CC|Roger. We copy.
0035705|CMP|Okay, we're FREE; rates look pretty good. Let's lock it together.
0035714|LMP|Okay. You ready?
0035715|CMP|Ready. She's lined up not bad.
0035718|CDR|Okay.
0035720|CMP|PRIME 1.
0035721|CDR|MARK it. Stand by.
0035722|CMP|Here she comes.
0035728|CMP|Ka-chunk. My gosh!
0035731|CDR|Okay, Houston, ripple fire; but we still have number A barber pole.
0035737|CC|Roger. We copy.
0035738|CDR|And we have a MASTER - and a MASTER ALARM.
0035740|CC|Roger.
0035741|CDR|We got - we got the most of the latches, but A is barber pole, and B is gray.
0035747|CMP|Okay, check both circuit breakers; they're IN. Yes, Okay.
0035757|LMP|We had one clear fire, maybe one or two latches and then a ripple fire on the rest.
0035807|CC|Roger.
0035810|LMP|And, by the way, I had a good view into the AOT, and I can still look in there, and it's very clean.
0035816|CC|Roger.
0035829|LMP|In fact - -
0035829|CC|Ron and Gene, we saw your MASTER ALARM. Did you have any - anything on the matrix light up?
0035837|CDR|No, not a thing. I looked.
0035838|CC|Roger.
0035847|PAO|That appeared to be a repeat of the master alarm that has been reported several times previously by the crew. They get the alarm light and tone, but when they look for the exact location of precise indication of what's wrong it's not there, indicating some sort of a spurious response by the master alarm to a problem that doesn't exist.
0035938|CDR|Okay, Bob, we're going to go ahead and take a look at that docking malfunction before we press on here further and check this barber pole out.
0035948|CC|Roger, We're working some words up here. We'll be back with you in a second on that, Gene.
0035953|CDR|Okay. We're down on the checklist through the EDS POWER breakers, OPEN.
0035959|CC|Understand.
0040057|CMP|And, Houston, in case we didn't tell you, it's talkback A that's barber pole.
0040102|CC|Understand. We have it.
0040114|CC|Say - say, Gene, we don't think it's a problem. We'll find out what it is when you get in. We think we should just press right on with the Flight Plan checklist and keep going.
0040127|CMP|Okay, we concur with that. Okay, we'll press on, Bob.
0040158|CDR|Okay, Bob. We just got a MASTER ALARM when I went to the RETRACT PRIME, from 1 to OFF.
0040207|CC|Roger. We copy that. Looks like panel 2 is jinxed up there, huh?
0040329|CMP|Okay, O2 HEATER number 3 went to AUTO.
0040335|CC|Roger. We copy that.
0040808|CDR|Okay, Bob. We're reading a DELTA-P of greater than 4, and I'm going to open the PRESSURE EQUALIZATION VALVE now.
0040818|CC|Roger, 17. We copy that.
0040905|CDR|Okay, the DELTA-P is coming down, Bob.
0040909|CC|Roger.
0040944|CC|Gene, while you're watching that, I just thought you'd be interested. We talked to some of our friends down at the Cape who watched the launch, and they said you were aglow all the way until you faded into - you couldn't tell you from a star. They saw staging, and they could just see you as a star way off in the distance until you faded out. Not a cloud in the way at all.
0040953|CDR|Beautiful. Okay, we're at - we're at 2, and we're monitoring it for 3 minutes.
0040959|CC|Okay.
0041008|CMP|And, Houston. While we're checking the integrity here, on mag Alfa Alfa, there's about 50 percent.
0041018|CC|Mag Alfa Alfa, 50 percent. Roger.
0041159|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 4 hours 12 minutes. The crew aboard Apollo 17 at this time pressing ahead with their preparations for separating the lunar module and command module, now docked together from the Saturn third stage. You heard some conversation earlier about an indication that all of the docking latches have not locked up. Now there are 12 of these latches in the docking mechanism, 6 of which are instrumented, and of the 6 that are instrumented, there was an indication that one of those may not have latched. However, we are confident that more than enough latches have locked up to assure a good solid dock, and for that reason the crew is pressing ahead with their preparations for separation.
0041254|CDR|Okay, Bob. That's 3 minutes. It's - DELTA-P change is less than 0.1.
0041259|CC|Three minutes and less than 0.1.
0041303|CDR|We are pressing on.
0041308|CC|Roger; press.
0041311|PAO|That report from Gene Cernan indicating that they have a good seal at the docking interface. Once the hatch is removed between the two vehicles, the crew will get a good look at all of those docking latches and they will be able to tell how many - if any of them didn't latch up. We're pushing ahead now for - for extracting the lunar module separating from the Saturn third stage at Ground Elapsed Time of 4 hours 39 minutes.
0041441|CMP|Okay, you want cabin's at 4.8 now; REPRESS is about empty. Okay. No, not yet, it's still getting a little bit.
0041504|CMP|That REPRESS PACKAGE VALVE is kind of noisy.
0041519|CMP|That's all the REPRESS O2. We'll turn that OFF.
0041524|CDR|Okay, Houston, the REPRESS PACKAGE is empty now, and we're down to a DELTA-P of 0.2.
0041530|CC|Roger. We copy that.
0041540|CC|And, 17. Just be advised, you're going to have an S-IVB nonpropulsive vent start 04:18:27- You've got about 3 minutes on that.
0041551|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. Thank you.
0041703|LMP|Can you reach ... there?
0041705|CMP|Yes, I'll get them.
0041707|CDR|Okay, Bob. We seem to be holding DELTA-P at about 0.2. I suspect that's probably zero.
0041718|CC|Roger. We copy that.
0041724|LMP|And the cabin pressure's about 4.5. You want us to wait until 5 PSI for the EMERGENCY CABIN PRESSURE SELECTS?
0041742|CC|Negative on that. Let's just go ahead and let's press on.
0041746|LMP|Okay. They should be BOTH.
0041757|CMP|Okay, EMERGENCY register working.
0041809|CMP|Coming down though, Gene. Let's wait until it gets down a little ways.
0041828|CMP|Yes.
0041851|CMP|Yes. Straight up and down as well.
0041903|CMP|Up one one. Must be the nonpropulsive VENT that's banging. (Laughter) Here comes all the - look at all the stuff going again. It's really glowing.
0041914|LMP|Your nonpropulsive vent gives quite a glow.
0041918|CC|Roger, Jack.
0041924|CMP|It looks like a rainbow. Dark one.
0041940|CMP|Okay. REPRESS PACKAGE to FILL.
0041947|CMP|That ought to take the surge tank down a little bit ... about at what? About 400?
0042003|CMP|500 on the surge. No, they ought to be closed off by now, I think. Yes.
0042016|CC|17, Houston.
0042018|CMP|Go ahead.
0042020|CC|Roger. Be advised, you don't have to wait until 5 PSI cabin to go ahead and open the hatch.
0042026|CDR|Okay, we're not, Bob. We're pressing on with it now.
0042027|CC|Roger.
0042030|CMP|Okay, it looks like we're going to maintain about 400 on the surge.
0042104|CMP|Okay?
0042118|CDR|Okay, Houston. The hatch is coming out.
0042121|CC|Roger.
0042126|CMP|(Laughter) I don't know what you're going to do with it.
0042139|CMP|Put it up here in the - in the - on the couch.
0042157|CMP|There we go.
0042158|CMP|Hey, that's a lot lighter than it used to be (laughter).
0042204|CDR|There's going to be a lot of happy people down there, Bob. I haven't checked them all, but visually, they're all locked.
0042210|CC|Understand, Gene. All of them are locked.
0042213|CDR|Let me give them a good check.
0042215|CMP|Yes. You'd better check them, because we got a barber pole on that one.
0042221|CDR|Okay, here's one that didn't come over.
0042225|CMP|What is the position of it?
0042227|CDR|7 ***
0042245|CMP|7 and 9?
0042302|CDR|Okay, Bob. Maybe we aren't all going to be so happy.
0042304|CC|Go ahead.
0042305|CDR|Okay, 7, 9, and 10 - the handle is flush; the bungee is vertical, but the handle is not locked down, and the - and the red button is showing. And I can pull each one of them back slowly. I haven't done anything with them. That's 7, 9, and 10.
0042335|CC|Roger. We copy that. The handle is flush; the bungees are vertical, but the handle is not locked down, and the red button is showing on 7, 9, and 10.
0042345|CDR|That's affirm.
0042423|CDR|Okay, Bob. Bob, I just pushed the handle on 10 home a little bit and it did lock. And the red button is flush. So that leaves me 9 and 7.
0042436|CC|Roger; understand.
0042447|CC|Geno, go ahead and try the handle on 9 and 7; and, if that doesn't work, cock them and refire them starting with 9, please.
0042458|CDR|Okay; the handle doesn't work. I'll have to recock them.
0042502|CC|Okay.
0042516|CMP|When you trip it with your - did you cock it twice?
0042520|CDR|Yes.
0042521|CMP|And it took two cocks to make it go?
0042524|CDR|Yes.
0042525|CMP|Okay.
0042530|CDR|Okay, 9 cocked twice; it tripped. It is overcenter and locked.
0042534|CC|Roger. How about the barber pole now?
0042538|CMP|Okay. Wait a minute, I've got - DOCKING PROBE MAIN A circuit breaker's IN and gone to RETRACT, and it's gray.
0042544|CC|Okay - -
0042544|CMP|Aha! That did it.
0042546|CC|Roger.
0042613|CDR|Okay, Bob. Cocked 7 twice and tripped it, and it's overcenter and locked.
0042618|CC|Roger.
0042620|CDR|I think that takes care of them all.
0042625|CC|Good show.
0042656|CMP|Okay, DOCKING PROBE circuit breakers are OUT and EXTEND/RETRACT is OFF.
0042714|CMP|Because it belongs on the probe. ... it's painted yellow, it belongs on the probe.
0042834|CDR|Okay, Bob. The umbilicals are connected.
0042839|CC|Roger.
0042933|CDR|Okay, Houston, 7 Delta on the test meter is now reading 1.0, it jumped up to 2.6, and is now back to 1.0.
0042943|CC|Roger. We copy. That's good.
0043006|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 4 hours 30 minutes. About 9 minutes from now the crew will be firing the pyrotechnic charges that separate the lunar module docked to the command module from the Saturn third stage, and springs will push the LM CSM back away from the launch vehicle at a rate of about 1 foot per second, and at Ground Elapsed Time of 4 hours 52 minutes the launch vehicle will yaw to the proper attitude for an evasive manuever of about 10 feet per second to be performed at a Ground Elapsed Time of about 5 hours 3 minutes. This will increase the separation difference to assure no chance of recontact between the booster and the spacecraft on route to the Moon. On removing the hatch between the LM, the CSM, allowing the crew to get a look inside the docking tunnel, they found that 3 of the 12 latches had not locked up, but on manually recocking them and activating them, they latched up properly, which indicates that there's nothing physically wrong with the system. And we would expect that the next time the 2 vehicles come together to dock that the latches will function properly.
0043031|LMP|There we go. Okay. There, we're going up in the tunnel.
0043150|CMP|Pretty good ham sandwich.
0043230|CDR|Okay, Bob, the hatch is back in.
0043236|CC|Roger, Gene.
0043424|CC|17, Houston.
0043427|LMP|Go ahead, Houston.
0043428|CC|Roger. We've got some new - new angles here for you.
0043443|LMP|Stand by a minute, and let me find a place to copy them.
0043449|CMP|What - what kind of angles are they, Bob?
0043452|CC|They're your NOUN 22 attitude maneuver for APS burn out of the hatch window. They're in the middle of the page L/3-5-
0043503|CMP|Oh, okay.
0043506|CC|Instead of 270, we want 274.
0043511|CMP|Wait 1. We're not quite with you.
0043512|CC|Okay.
0043542|LMP|Okay. I think I'm with you at 3-7; go.
0043548|CC|It's on 3-5, Jack, middle of the page there. Those NOUN 22s.
0043556|LMP|Okay, I take it back; 3-5, middle of the page.
0043601|CC|Okay. You notice there's three angles there - 270, make that 274.
0043613|LMP|Okay. That the only change?
0043614|CC|And the - no, the next one, the 129-8, change that to 164. And 4.3 on the yaw, change that to zero. It's close enough; zero on the yaw.
0043633|LMP|Okay. We got them 274, 164, 00.
0043636|CC|Roger, and the high-gain angles that you've got on the Flight Plan are close enough and should do it.
0043645|LMP|Very good.
0043913|PAO|Telemetry data now shows the crew loading the information into the spacecraft digital auto pilot in preparation for separation from the Saturn third stage. That should be occurring in the next minute or so.
0043953|CMP|Okay. We're 6 frames a second. Okay, what - what did ... RANGE ...
0044009|CMP|Okay, I'll - I'll leave it at 10 feet and about an f - f/8. Okay, ... at set. Because I had that one to 0180 to 0.
0044101|CDR|Okay, Bob. We're aligning our GDC, and the next thing we'll pick up will be SECS ARM circuit breakers. And we'll give you a call on the LOGIC.
0044112|CC|Roger, Gene.
0044126|LMP|Okay, Bob. While we're waiting, does the balance on the - -
0044130|CMP|I see what you mean (laughter).
0044131|LMP|H2 and O2 flow in fuel cell 3 - well, actually, in all three fuel cells, look pretty good to you?
0044151|CC|Jack, the flows look just right for the current.
0044158|LMP|Okay. Used to seeing them more or less lined up, and I hadn't calculated any further than that.
0044204|CC|Roger.
0044205|LMP|O2 - O2 seems a little higher H2, relatively speaking. (laughter)
0044226|CMP|Okay. That's pretty close. Verified: SECS ARM breakers are CLOSED.
0044233|CDR|Okay, Houston. We're ready to come up with the LOGIC.
0044242|CMP|Okay, Houston, LOGIC 1 is coming on now and LOGIC 2.
0044248|CC|Roger.
0044313|CMP|And, Houston, just to keep track of EMS null bias check that time, was - went from 100 to 100.7 in 100 seconds.
0044334|CC|17, we'd like to just verify on that top line S-IVB/LM SEP circuit breakers - both of them are CLOSED?
0044345|CDR|Okay, we'll verify them again. We doublechecked them.
0044349|CC|Okay, we just didn't hear your call and we want to make sure of that. Didn't want to miss anything here.
0044353|CDR|Okay. They are - they are verified CLOSED, and Jack just checked them again.
0044357|CC|Okay. You are GO for PYRO ARM and GO for extraction.
0044401|CDR|Okay, GO for PYRO ARM; GO for PYRO extraction - or LM extraction (laughter).
0044409|LMP|Okay, PYRO ARM.
0044410|CMP|Okay, we'll ARM the old PYROs. There's PYRO A; PYRO B.
0044417|LMP|SERVO POWER number 1 ...
0044419|CMP|TVC SERVO POWER, AC 1.
0044421|LMP|TRANS CONTROL POWER, up and ON.
0044424|CMP|TRANS CONTROL POWER is ON.
0044429|CMP|Okay, ROT CONTROLLERS are ARMED. Okay, I'll wait just a little bit on that - EMS to NORMAL. Get DELTA-V ...
0044458|CMP|Okay, EMS to NORMAL? Push right there. Yes.
0044506|CDR|Okay; on my mark, the S-IVB/LM SEP will come on.
0044509|CMP|Okay, and then I'll back it off to - Okay?
0044523|CDR|Okay, on my mark, S-IVB/LM SEP: 3,2,1-
0044532|CDR|MARK it. Okay, we got it.
0044535|CMP|Oh, ho! Man, did we! There she goes. Yes; LM came with us.
0044543|CMP|Okay, we're CMC, AUTO. All right. We've got 0.6. It's all right. Okay, whoopee-dee-doo!
0044558|CMP|Safe the PYROs. Okay, LOGIC'S OFF.
0044608|CMP|SECS - SECS ARM breakers are OPEN.
0044617|PAO|This is Apollo Control. America and Challenger are on their own. LM injection occured at 4 hours 45 minutes Ground Elapsed Time - at an altitude of 13,000 nautical miles from earth.
0044641|CMP|Now I think we ought to go to the maneuver pretty quick. Otherwise, the S-IVB will be so far away you can't see it. Okay, you ready to maneuver?
0044656|CMP|Okay, CMC in AUTO, caged. Away we go. That - that ... wasn't as bad as the original SEP.
0044712|CMP|Yes.
0044717|CMP|Came right out, though.
0044719|LMP|MAPPING CAMERA and PAN CAMERA are OFF.
0044729|CMP|Okay. POWER'S OFF. Hey, Jack. Hand me the Hasselblad. I think we're bowing the right direction. Yes, the Moon is there. The Earth is - that's the Earth.
0044752|CMP|SERVO POWER'S OFF, yes.
0044756|CMP|The Earth just fills up window 5. Okay, f infinity, about a 250th.
0044815|CMP|What - what do you have? A zero in there? Hey, I lost my watch. Turn the AC OFF. Yes, AC is OFF. Whoops, what a beauty! What a beauty! Yes, the Earth. I can see the S-IVB it's going ...
0044845|CMP|Look at that.
0044848|CMP|Yes, Madagascar and Africa. Got to be.
0044900|CMP|... see it.
0044902|CMP|Got to be.
0044905|CMP|Yes, as soon as I find the S-IVB, we'll -
0044921|CMP|Hey, there's Antarctica. It's all full of snow. Okay. You want to look?
0044935|CMP|Yeah.
0044942|CMP|Yes. Oh, there it goes, there. Looks kind of empty down there without the LM - -
0044953|CDR|Okay, Bob, we're looking right up the dome of the S-IVB.
0044959|CC|Roger. We copy that. We're standing by for your GO for yaw maneuver.
0045019|CMP|We can give them a GO for yaw, can't we? We can see it now.
0045024|CDR|Yes, we can see it. You've got the GO for the yaw.
0045031|CC|Roger. Thank you, 17.
0045042|CDR|Looks like she came out of there clean as a whistle.
0045048|CC|17, Houston. The yaw maneuver will be starting in about 4 plus 52, a little less than 2 minutes from now.
0045055|CDR|Okay.
0045116|CC|Sounds like you are taking a picture of that old dome out there, huh?
0045122|CMP|Oh, we're at the end. (Laughter) We're at the end - you know.
0045221|CMP|... In there.
0045235|CMP|Hey, there it goes. Look at the aft fire of the thing.
0045238|CDR|Yes, we can see it fire now.
0045246|CC|Roger, 17. Yaw maneuver started.
0045254|PAO|The Saturn third stage now maneuvering into attitude for the APS evasive maneuver, a 10 foot per second burn using the auxiliary propulsion system that will assure -.
0045306|LMP|The old S-IVB had a flare for the dramatic, but it certainly did its job for us.
0045310|CC|Roger, Jack. Preliminary data indicate that you are about as nominal as you can be.
0045326|CDR|That's the way we'd like to keep it, Bob.
0045328|CC|You'd better believe it.
0045331|CDR|Okay. She's - as we're looking at it, she's pitching up. She was looking right at us - we were looking right at the dome - and now she's pitching up. The shroud around the IU seems to be totally intact. It - it looked like a super clean separation. I can't really see where there's any paint or anything externally chipped off the - the booster from here. We're beginning to - to pick up the bell. It's really a shame you don't have this - this whole thing on TV; it's really quite a sight.
0045412|CC|Roger. We concur with that.
0045425|CDR|The Mylar and the gold coating on the inside of the shroud that's now visible is also intact. It looks like you could use it again if you could get it back.
0045443|CC|Well, it's got a job to do when it hits the Moon yet.
0045515|CDR|Okay, Bob. We've - we're almost looking at it broadside now.
0045520|CC|Roger.
0045601|CDR|Okay. She's spitting a little; looks like the yaw maneuver may be complete.
0045613|CDR|We got a - full view of the - entire J2 from here; and no kidding, Bob, the whole bird, the shroud at the top by the IU, the separation plane down by the S-II, from here all looks as clean as a whistle, all the way.
0045632|CC|Roger, Gene. If you're happy, we'd like a GO from you for the evasive burn.
0045640|CDR|Okay. You're going to burn on the boosters plus X-axis, is that right?
0045645|CC|That's affirmative.
0045648|CDR|Let's get a picture or two here yet, and we'll give you a GO.
0045658|CC|And, Gene, it'll be about 7 minutes until the evasive burn; 5 plus 03.
0045703|CDR|Okay. You have a GO.
0045710|LMP|And for your reference, at frame 105 I started a few 250-millimeter pictures of the S-IVB.
0045724|CC|Roger, Jack.
0045821|CDR|And, Bob, the entire sky, as far as I can make it out through the hatch window, is completely filled with our twinkling flakes.
0045847|CC|Roger. We copy that.
0045857|LMP|I saw a couple particles go by the window awhile back, and it looked a little bit like insulation in this - these particular case - styrofoam insulation, but in flat flakes.
0045919|CC|Roger that.
0045922|LMP|That was right after we separated from the S-IVB.
0045928|CC|Roger.
0045929|LMP|CSM SEP - CSM SEP, Bob.
0045933|CC|Roger. Understand.
0045937|CDR|Bob, I know - I know we're not the first to discover this, but we'd like to confirm, from the crew of America, that the world is round.
0045952|CC|Roger. That's a good data point. Have you gotten a good look at any of that weather down there on the Antarctic?
0050002|CDR|Well, on Ron's window number 1 - maybe he can tell you a little about it.
0050009|CMP|You know, it's yeal funny there in Antarctica the - You can see the snow, but there isn't any weather at all in it. All of the weather's around it in the water.
0050018|CC|Roger.
0050020|LMP|That's where the moisture is.
0050026|CMP|I don't know what to take a picture of.
0050112|CMP|I can't see the U.S. at all.
0050114|CC|17, Houston.
0050116|CDR|Go ahead.
0050117|CC|Look's like you've got a superconservative CMP up there. We've run off some numbers - Looks like you used about 40 pounds of RCS on the T&D, and you've used about a total of 42 pounds RCS total; so we're hanging right in there. Beautiful.
0050134|CDR|Very fine; glad to hear that.
0050137|LMP|... velvet touch.
0050140|CMP|Still a little bit too much, but that's not bad.
0050142|CDR|We'll be glad to leave all that extra, I hope, in the service module when we get home.
0050247|CMP|It's in the Volkswagen pouch down there.
0050310|CMP|Oh, I'll change the lens now.
0050311|CC|17, Houston. It's about 30 seconds from the evasive maneuver burn.
0050317|CDR|Okay.
0050319|CMP|Here, Jack, can you see him good? Check the settings there. I took an f/22 stop.
0050351|CDR|There it goes, Bob.
0050352|CMP|There it goes; finally.
0050354|CC|Roger.
0050511|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 5 hours 5 minutes.
0050512|CC|17, Houston. The evasive burn is complete, and the LOX dump will be at 5 plus 24 plus 20.
0050523|CDR|Okay; 5 plus 24 plus 20.
0050525|CC|Roger.
0050526|CMP|It's going to be gone, I think, before we see it.
0050541|CDR|And, Bob, you can tell Frank to forget the - returning that phone call I made to him a couple days ago.
0050550|CC|Roger. Understand.
0050554|CDR|All my questions are answered.
0050556|CC|Think you've had enough booster briefings, huh?
0050559|CDR|Yes. I figure this is probably the best one of all.
0050604|CC|Frank said he'd guarantee all those S-IVBs would be just as good as this one.
0050608|CDR|Okay. That's - fair enough.
0050621|CDR|The S-IC and the S-II didn't put on a bad show either.
0050624|CC|That's right.
0050838|CMP|Houston, magazine November November is on about 123 right now.
0050846|CC|Okay, Ron. Magazine November November is on 123.
0050855|CDR|And, Bob, we're on page 3-9 of the Flight Plan now. We'll check the LM/CM DELTA-P, get the cabin fan filter in. We'll go over the check - the Systems Checklist, get the primary EVAP and a few odds and ends, and start doffing our PGAs. How's that sound?
0050916|CC|Sounds like a winner, Gene.
0050919|CDR|Okay.
0051101|LMP|I guess you saw that one, Houston. That had no caution or warning with it.
0051110|CC|Roger. That a MASTER ALARM?
0051112|LMP|Yes, sir.
0051114|CC|How about the LEB?
0051115|LMP|Gene's got ... say again. (Laughter) You caught me. I forgot to look. Keep after us; we'll get you that data point.
0051126|CC|Roger, Jack.
0051130|LMP|Gene's got his hands all over panel 2, which probably is what caused it.
0051152|CC|Jack, we think that might have been a real one due to the accumulator cycle with the O2 makeup flow going on there - it gave - it held the O2 flow higher for - greater than the16 seconds.
0051206|LMP|Well, that's certainly a possibility. We didn't notice it - Looked upright at the time. But it - Sure that was the right time?
0051217|CC|Well, EECOM's watching it here, and he feels it is.
0051224|LMP|Gee, I can't argue with him.
0051350|LMP|Okay, Houston. Ready to deactivate the primary evaporator if you concur.
0051401|CC|Roger, Jack. We concur.
0051550|LMP|Okay, Bob. VHF SIMPLEX Alfa's OFF.
0051557|CC|Roger.
0051601|LMP|And we're gradually moving into getting out of the suits.
0051605|CC|Yes. I'll bet you're looking forward to that.
0051610|LMP|Well, I'll tell you it's a different world without that old one G on you. The old suit's a little bit friendlier.
0051716|LMP|And, as you may have noticed, Bob, we've come to the end of the Launch Checklist.
0051723|CC|That's affirmative, and we've put ours away for posterity. We also stored it with our TLI zero data that we worked so hard to generate.
0051737|LMP|Well, I'm just happy - didn't - use it. That view of the Earth for a rev there was something I was looking forward to and I was not disappointed.
0051749|CC|That's great, Jack.
0051754|CDR|Bob, you've got a pretty good size storm over the north - I guess the northwestern coast of India, where it starts to wrap up and around to the west. It's a - rounded out on the horizon, so I can't make out exactly where it is too well.
0051817|CC|Roger.
0051821|CC|Could we get a read-out on the LM/CM DELTA-P?
0051851|LMP|Plus 0.4.
0051856|CC|Roger. We copy that.
0051900|CDR|Bob, Antarctica is what I would call effectively just a solid white cap down on the - South Pole. There's definite contact between the continent and the water. But, as Ron said, most of the clouds seem to be, well very artistic, very picturesque - some in clockwise rotating fashion but appear to be very thin where you can, for the most part, kind of see through those clouds to the blue water below.
0051945|CC|Roger.
0051946|CDR|The continent - the continent itself is - is the same color as the clouds; but, of course, more dense - and striking difference than any of the other white background around because you can definitely see that contact with the water and with the clouds over the water.
0052005|CC|Roger. Understand. There'll soon be a comm switch over to Madrid here shortly. We may break lock in a few minutes here. Or a few seconds, rather.
0052026|CC|And you might watch - your accumulator's going to cycle in about 20 seconds here. Let's see what happens on the MASTER ALARM.
0052103|CC|17, Houston. How do you read through Madrid?
0052107|LMP|You're loud and clear, Bob, and could you give us our distance from the Earth?
0052112|CC|Roger. I'm looking up at the board. I'd guess at about 19,000 miles. Want me to get it exact?
0052118|CMP|No, just approximate's good enough.
0052124|CC|18,100, FIDO says.
0052127|CDR|Okay. And I suppose we're seeing as 100 percent full Earth as we'll ever see; certainly as I've ever seen. It appears to be - it may be a little bit - a little bit of a terminator way out to the - well, to the east - out beyond Australia and beyond India. But beyond that it's about 99 percent pure.
0052259|CDR|Bob, it's these kind of views - these kind of views that stick with you forever.
0052307|CC|Roger, Gene.
0052309|CDR|We've got a - I guess probably the continent of Africa dominates the world right now. It's covering the - oh, the upper third - upper and western third of the - of the world. We can see the Sinai; we can see up into the Mediterranean; we can see across the Mediterranean, although we can't quite make out the countries up there; we can see across into India. I catch a glimpse of Australia out in the far horizon. Got Zanzibar on the southern tip of Africa, the Cape down there just almost directly below us. And, I don't know exactly how big Antarctica is, but I guess we can certainly see more than 50 percent of it. And - the rest of it is all ocean. The Indian Ocean out into the Pacific Ocean and back into the Atlantic Ocean. And for the most part relatively clear of clouds except in the Antarctica region, and up towards Europe which is - which is on the horizon, across the Mediterranean, it looks like there might be some clouds back up in that way. I can probably - probably - well, not probably - I can make out the entire coast of Africa from Mediterranean around to the west, coming back to the south, back where it takes its big dip to the east, back around the Cape, back around up through the Suez Canal, almost perfectly.
0052459|CC|Roger. We understand.
0052502|CDR|And there's one batch of clouds in northern Africa, just a small batch, it looks like it may be up near the - well, no, it's not near the mouth of the Nile; it's quite a bit west of that as a matter of fact, I can see the mouth of the Nile; I can see it running straight down towards us as it parallels the Suez, and then sort of fades out into the central darker brown or darker green portions of Africa.
0052537|CC|Roger, Gene. Sure be nice to have that on TV, wouldn't it?
0052542|CDR|Boy, I'd love to give it to you; any way I could.
0052556|CDR|You know - and there's no strings holding it up either. It's out there all by itself.
0052607|CC|Roger. I just was going through the 17 status report on CSM systems and, boy, everything is absolutely nominal, with the exception of ... glitching MASTER ALARMs that we're trying to still track down; but every other system is just nominal it's - everything is great.
0052630|CDR|Okay. Sounds good. That's the way they built it for us.
0052729|CC|Gene, looking at our plot board, you're directly over the southern tip of Africa or just slightly out in the Indian Ocean there, according to our plot board, which isn't exactly accurate all the time. But shortly you're going to start going backwards on the Earth here and head back across the Atlantic. That ought to be some sort of a first. You cross the Atlantic twice, going from west to east, and then, now you're going to cross it going from east to west here shortly. All in a very short span of time.
0052809|LMP|Yes. I guess that does sound like a first.
0053000|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 5 hours 30 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The white team of flight controllers, headed by Gene Krantz, is in the process now, of handing over to the team headed by flight director Pete Frank. After 12 hours, the team came on about 3 hours prior to the scheduled launch time of 8:53 PM Central Standard Time. Of course, launch occurred 2 hours 40 minutes late at a Ground Elapsed Time of 11, - of a Central Standard Time rather, 11:33 PM. As a result of the late launch-time the trans-lunar injection, that's up through translunar injection, also slipped 2 hours, 40 minutes. We would expect that the translunar injection which is targeted to make up the difference will get us back on the nominal flight plan time by the time the spacecraft arrives at the Moon. In other words, arrival time at the Moon would be at the same Central Standard Time as called for in the Flight Plan at about 1:49 PM Central Standard Time, December 10. But, the Ground Elapsed Time would be about 2 hours, 40 minutes earlier than that provided for in the Flight Plan, the arrival being at about 86 hours, 14 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The 2 hour, 40 minute difference being accounted for in a speedier arrival time at the Moon, a translunar injection burn being targeted just slightly longer than would have been the case in a normal launch. The spacecraft getting to the Moon in a total elapsed time 2 hours 40 minutes less, in effect, making up for lost time from the late launch. In order to get the flight plan back in agreement with the Ground Elapsed Time the GET, or ground elapsed clock, will simply be moved ahead 2 hours, 40 minutes between now and the time spacecraft arrives at the Moon. So, that by the time Apollo 17 is inserted into Lunar Orbit, the GET will once again agree with the flight plan GET and of course, the Central Standard Time of arrival will be the same as was originally planned by virtue of a speedier trip time. As a result of the late liftoff it was not possible to program television coverage of the transposition and docking. This was because of a shift in the orbital ground track moving the ground track away from the needed Manned Spaceflight network coverage for television. We simply didn't have an adequate ground station to receive the television signal from the spacecraft. There has been one recurring problem that is yet unexplained. That is in the displays and control system. The crew reported on several occassions that MASTER ALARM was occurring. The master alarm manifests itself in a form of a light that flashes in the Command Module. There are three of these lights and also a tone that comes on and a normal procedure is when the MASTER ALARM light comes on and the tone sounds, the crew then looks at another matrix of lights to determine precisely where the problem is. However, when looking at this matrix of lights none of them were lighted, indicating that some spurrious signal had ignited or lighted the MASTER ALARM light and that there was in fact no problem in the systems. There is at this point no explanation for the problem. However, engineers here in the Control Center, are looking into the past history of Panel 2, which is the panel on which a number of switches are located, which have triggered this master alarm, to see if there is a history of Panel 2 that would indicate a possibility of some momentary short in the caution and warning system, which could give a MASTER ALARM. The problem at this point is an annoyance, but does not appear to be a serious problem. All other spacecraft systems are performing normally, and the trajectory to the Moon is almost precisely as planned at this point. We do not anticipate a change of shift press briefing. The white team will be coming back on at the regualar Central Standard Time 4:00 PM tomorrow. And in light of this rather short turnaround we're going to forego the change of shift press briefing. At 5 hours, 36 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.
0053001|CDR|Bob, I can assume that from what you said there will be - probably not be a midcourse 1?
0053002|CC|That's exactly what we're working towards, Gene. And I - I'm sorry I didn't convey that feeling to you a little earlier. There's no reason for mid-course 1 right now.
0053003|CDR|Okay. Because we prefer to press on and get the suits off and hit the sack rather than make it, unless we have to.
0053004|CC|That's for sure. Roger. The earlier data showed us midcourse 1 would have been less than 3 feet per second, and we wouldn't have done it. And the data's been fluctuating, but they're smoothing it out, and it's still holding that way; so we won't be doing it, probably.
0053005|CDR|Okay. Very good.
0053006|LMP|Bob, I'm looking over Gene's shoulder here at the Earth, and it must be an awful clear day for the so-called convergence zone across Africa. Gene, I think, Indicated, as it looked to us as we crossed it earlier, most of Africa is clear. Only some - probably are broken and scattered clouds -cumulus in the east central portion that are running along the line of - north/south lines.
0053007|CC|Roger.
0053008|LMP|Looks like a major circulation system off the southern tip of Africa, as Gene mentioned, plus one west of that, 20 or 30 degrees of longitude. Make that east of that.
0053009|CC|Roger.
0053010|LMP|And, southwest of the - make that south southwest of the tip of Africa at Cape Good Hope, there looks like an incipient circulation system developing about half way between the coast of Antarctica and Africa. If I had to guess, it's going to swing up north towards the Cape and - and then swing west The whole pattern, ... it looks like now, is a fairly equally spaced cyclones that are sort of circling around the Antarctic continent, as we can see it now.
0053011|CC|Roger, Jack.
0053350|LMP|But I would guess that South Africa is going to have good weather for several more days, at least. And if the pattern is - is apparent in the clouds we see is correct, the last disturbance I mentioned probably is going to pass south of the Cape also,
0053351|CC|Roger. Understand.
0053352|LMP|As we were going - over our daylight around the Earth in orbit, it was very clear looking at the various clouds, Bob, what were high clouds and what were low clouds, particularly when you had them together. The high clouds cast very distinct shadow patterns on the lower ones and, very commonly, had entirely different orientations -pattern orientations. The low ones seem to be more associated with arcuate front patterns; whereas, the high clouds were generally transverse to that, roughly north/south directions. That's not completely general observation, but I noticed it several times.
0053353|CC|Roger. Understand.
0053354|CC|I just noticed on the plot board here, it looks like you're come up on 20,000 miles out, right about now.
0053527|LMP|It feels like about, 20,000 miles.
0053527|CC|Okay.
0053728|LMP|Bob, I have the first hint of contamination on window 5. It's covering, probably, the central - well, I'd say, - roughly around - it's square about - 7 inches in - on a side with a very thin film that's catching the sunlight; and slightly irridescent, but also very finely granular - very finely granular. You can just barely tell what it is, actually.
0053809|CC|Roger. Understand.
0053811|LMP|Looks like very uniform in thickness right now.
0054655|LMP|Bob, this is Jack. We've got a UCTA dump scheduled, or is possible, at 6 o'clock. There's nothing sacred about that time, is there?
0054711|CC|Nothing at all. Whenever you're ready, just go ahead and dump.
0054715|LMP|Okay.
0054848|LMP|Bob, one of the things that we missed in our training is a good geography lesson, and particularly on Antarctica. I got the monocular out, and apparently the dark band that Gene - Ron mentioned as interface between the continental water is that between the pack ice and the water. And you can, by very subtle changes in the apparent smoothness of the ground, probably make out where the actual continent begins and the pack ice ends. There are a few exposed ranges, I guess it's midsummer down there now, and you can make out the snow-free areas scattered at least in the northern portion of the continent.
0054947|CC|Roger. Did you get any pictures of that, Jack?
0054950|LMP|Oh, yes. We got some pictures earlier. I'm going to get another one here in a minute. I'll tell you, if there ever was a fragile-appearing piece of blue in space, it's the Earth right now.
0055003|CC|(laughter) Roger.
0055006|LMP|And we got a MASTER ALARM.
0055008|CC|Okay. We copy that.
0055011|LMP|And there's one in the LEB.
0055014|CC|Okay. Good data point.
0055018|LMP|And there are no caution lights.
0055021|CC|It came right at accumulator cycle, along with the high O2 flow again.
0055026|LMP|Yes, I just checked the time, and I think you are right on that one. Well, we gave you your LEB data point.
0055039|CC|Yes, sir.
0055049|LMP|The problem with looking at the Earth (laughter) particularly Antarctica, is it's too bright.
0055100|CC|Understand.
0055102|LMP|And so I'm using my sunglasses through the monocular, which is not the best (laughter) viewing platform. I think I can see some of the areas of the Dry Valley, but, again, I'm not too sure of my geography Bob. There are clouds over the continent, I believe, but, of course, they're just as white as the snow, and you only see differences in texture brought out by - probably varying photometric return because of fairly low sun angles down there.
0055141|CC|Roger.
0055147|LMP|But you can see patterns of what I believe is pack ice - leading off from that sharp interface that was talked about earlier. And those patterns seem to merge directly with the patterns of the clouds as if the - at least near the continent - the oceanic currents are controlling the air currents, up to a point, along with the movement of the pack ice.
0055224|CC|Roger.
0055225|LMP|I'm distinguishing the pack ice from clouds mainly by the angularity of the patterns within them. There is no good clear color or albedo distinction. So, I could - I could be looking entirely at clouds, but I suspect there are some pack ice patterns, too. I'm not keeping you awake, am I, Bob?
0055253|CC|No, sir. Just keep talking; we're listening. And I'm sure not much of the world is listening, but this will all be recorded, and you can read it all when you get back and think it through and tie it up with the pictures. And I'm sure there's going to be people interested in this. And we're interested ourselves; just keep talking.
0055311|LMP|All I want to do is read what I say.
0055314|CC|Roger. If I had a little more geology training, I'd be asking you some better questions. I'm afraid, right now, I can't think of anything to ask you.
0055321|LMP|Well, I can't - I really wish I knew that geography. I don't know - I wish I'd thought of bringing a good map of Antarctica. Could somebody do a little researching for me and see if they could tell me if we're - have a Little American view - say on the eastern edge of the continent?
0055348|CC|Roger. We'll see if we can get some Antarctica geographers around.
0055353|LMP|Yes, I'd like to - and, also, whether or not they think the Dry Valley area is visible to us. Let's see, there's some - some of the people over there in Bill Bennett's group, I think, have a little Antarctic experience, or used to. They might be able to help you out.
0055410|CC|Okay. We'll see what we can track down on it.
0055413|LMP|Don't use up a lot of people's time on it, but - but I'd be interested.
0055418|CC|Roger. It's getting pretty empty around here. It's 5:00 in the morning, so - (laughter)
0055425|LMP|Okay. There is a good strong northern hemisphere cyclone up near India, and I think Gene mentioned that. It, I think, was one I saw in some of the forecast sheets as a dissipating hurricane or typhoon. I'm not sure which it is there. I guess it's a typhoon. And I see something here that I noticed in Earth orbit, Bob. That as you approach the terminator - and now I'm looking at the eastern terminator - have to keep all my directions straight here - yes, eastern terminator. The clouds - those associated with the cyclone over India and one that's - appears to be due south of there - maybe 30 degrees of latitude - have a gray appearance. The - instead of the brilliant white of other clouds as you approach the terminator, those - at least the high level clouds are gray. Now, when we were going over them in orbit, the lower level clouds were still white, and I think I can see a hint of that right now. The Sun gives a strong light reflection off of the buildups in the low-level clouds; whereas, the high-level and probably layered cirrus and maybe some of the intermediate level stratus tend to look gray because of grazing Sun, I suspect.
0055626|CC|Roger. You mentioned something in Earth orbit that kind of intrigued me. You mentioned seeing the rainbow, and we were trying to figure out how you saw a rainbow up there. And you were in orbit already at that time. Do you remember that?
0055641|LMP|Well, - we're not - we were speaking of the merits of the sunrise.
0055646|CC|Okay. Roger.
0055650|LMP|- having a banded color appearance that varied as you approached sunrise. I can't remember what we - I think we put some of that on tape, and we were probably LOS at the time. But the banded character of the sunrise in the atmosphere was very, very marked. There was a gray-blue upper layer followed - that merged or graded into a brilliant blue intermediate zone that was just above the cloud levels. And within the clouds, you got a orange to yellow band, getting more yellow as the Sun rose, that was broken by the dark patterns of the buildups.
0055754|CC|Roger. Good show.
0055759|LMP|The interesting thing was the continual glow on the horizon we had, even at night, on the darkside pass - and that glow was in the atmosphere because I could see stars rise over the horizon in it and then pass on through it.
0055819|CC|Roger. You were talking - the airglow, I guess, is the phenomenon most of the guys had seen before. It's kind of Interesting, Yes?
0055825|LMP|Yes, that's - that's right. It's interesting - I guess standard airglow, but it is very striking that it's a continuous thing even in the dark pass.
0055836|CC|Roger.
0055842|LMP|I think I did see the eastern tip of South America, now.
0055856|CC|Roger. You're starting to back up now, coming the other way. So you're still over Africa, according to our chart here, but you're backing up towards the - South America.
0055907|LMP|Yes, I can see the part of South America that Mercator thought that fitted in with the bend in Africa some many decades ago and started people thinking about moving continents around on the crust.
0055925|CC|Roger. Jack, how'd the PGA doffing go? Most of you - are you all out of the PGAs now?
0055938|LMP|That's in work. We're taking it slow and easy up here, Bob.
0055941|CC|Roger. Understand. I'll just be curious to see if they all fit in that bag.
0055948|LMP|I think you'll find that Ronald Evans will also be curious about that. He's already making comments.
0055956|CC|Roger.
0060003|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 6 hours. As Jack Schmitt gives the description of the earth, Apollo 17 is 22,868 nautical miles from earth, velocity 12,520 feet per second.
0060017|LMP|Bob, you certainly do have a very clear intuitive impression, although the evidence is hard to pull together, that the - any frontal systems that move off the Antarctic continent do not take on any well-defined character until they get into the moist regions of the ocean. And when they do, they seem to pick up an arcuate circ - circulation that, in the view we have, seem to get fairly regularly spaced cyclone patterns that lie between the Cape of Good Hope and northern portion of Antarctica. And these - circulations of the cyclones follows roughly an east/west pattern, and the curve - and the arcs of the fronts are more north/south than - let's say northwest, swinging around to the south.
0060130|CC|Roger.
0060130|LMP|All of them - all of them very - very nicely defined as southern hemisphere cyclones. There - about four of those visible swinging around - oh, I guess, that's latitude - I'm having to guess here, but I'd say latitude 50 to 60 south.
0060155|CC|Okay; 50 or 60 south on that, huh?
0060158|LMP|Yes, I have to look at the map here in a minute and see if that puts me between Antarctica and the Cape.
0060203|CC|Roger.
0060208|CC|Well, the tip - the tip of Africa there is at about 32 south.
0060214|LMP|Well, that sounds like a pretty good guess, then. It looks like the intertropical convergence zone over Africa is starting to get more and more clouds in it now. I suspect as midday approaches, which is what we're seeing there, we can expect to see more and more moisture indications.
0060239|CC|Roger. They're - they're probably about noontime right there right now. It's 11:36 at the zero meridian at Greenwich, so it's just a little bit before noon right in that area you're talking about.
0060251|LMP|Yes, some of those masses of what I suspect are cumulus buildups - well, not really. They don't look like they're as concentrated and localized. More like just masses of fairly dense clouds that are developing in that band of green that crosses the lower portion of Africa.
0060317|CC|Roger.
0060355|LMP|Stay tuned for the next installment on the Earth. I'll try to get out of this suit.
0060401|CC|Okay. Just take it easy, Jack, and we'll be listening.
0060406|LMP|Man, I've never taken it so easy in my life. I'll tell you, Bob, I couldn't have believed this would be an experience like it is now.
0060415|CC|Roger.
0060421|LMP|Every time you turn around, there is something else to see and wonder what's causing it. Whether it's a particle zipping across the window, or one zipping across the cabin, or spring mechanics here in zero g; there's always something going on.
0060437|CC|Roger.
0060705|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 6 hours 7 minutes No midcourse correction number 1 will be performed. The value of the maneuver that would be required is less than 3 feet per second and midcourse correction number 1 will not be performed by Apollo 17. The spacecraft is now 23,682 nautical miles from Earth, velocity 12,301 feet per second.
0060955|LMP|Bob, if I'm not waking you up, an observer from another planet certainly - probably could decide that we have such things as clouds and at least large thunderstorms because right at the terminator you get a brightening of the sunlit side and a long, long shadow out to the - out to the east that is reminiscent of what we saw in the early days looking at the Moon at the terminator.
0061037|CC|Roger.
0061040|LMP|However, in the next pass around, I'll bet you wouldn't see them.
0061121|LMP|I've never been a big - Well, I didn't grow up with the idea of drifting continents and sea-floor spreadings, but I tell you, when you look at the way the pieces of the - of the northeastern portion of the African continent seem to fit together, separated by a narrow gulf, you could almost make a believer of anybody.
0061122|CC|Roger. It's beginning to look like the globe that you might buy down at the store, huh?
0061157|LMP|Oh, I don't think so, Bob. (laughter)
0061159|CC|Okay.
0061201|LMP|I don't think we'd better put this one up for sale. Somewhere there might be somebody who would like to buy it.
0061227|CC|Say, Jack. We noticed the O2 flow has dropped down now. We're wondering, did you all close the waste storage vent valve?
0061236|LMP|I don't think so; let me check on that. It might have gotten closed inadvertently in this game we were playing down in the LEB.
0061255|LMP|Ron says it's still on VENT.
0061258|CC|It's on VENT. Roger.
0061307|CC|Okay. We're noticing the flow is coming back up slowly; so something caused it to drop, and it's coming back up.
0061315|LMP|Okay.
0061741|CC|17, Houston.
0061744|LMP|Go ahead.
0061745|CC|Jack, just to ease those words I said before, we looked at the schematics here a second, and you'd be dumping urine out of that same line as that waste vent, and that would probably cause the pressure to build up enough to slow the O2 flow. And we noticed that the O2 flow is climbing back up to where it belongs.
0061808|LMP|Well, that's clever. Okay.
0061811|CC|Didn't mean to worry you there. Shouldn't have said it, I guess, before we looked at the schematic.
0061818|LMP|Oh, I really hadn't started to worry about it yet, Bob, so no sweat.
0062215|LMP|How'd the S-IVB work go Bob?
0062224|CC|They just finished their second burn, and it's targeted right where they want it. Just working perfectly.
0062234|LMP|Where were they going to put that one? I guess I lost track of that.
0062252|CC|7 degrees south and 8 degrees west, Jack.
0062257|LMP|Say again, you cut out on the first.
0062300|CC|Okay; 7 degrees south and 8 degrees west.
0062309|LMP|Okay. That ought to be interesting.
0062329|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 6 hours 24 minutes. The S-IVB maneuver that was just being discussed was performed with the auxiliary propulsion system; just completed Delta V of 13 feet per second to tune up the trajectory for S-IVB impact at the desired location on the lunar surface of 7 degrees south, 8 degrees west. That's approximately 200 kilometers east of the Apollo 14 ALSEP site where the seismometer is located. That impact is expected to be picked up by the other seismometers on the Moon, the other Apollo lunar surface experiment seismometers. Booster systems engineer is now maneuvering the S-IVB stage, the third stage of the launch vehicle to a solar heat control attitude. This is to minimize the heat into the instrument unit. They will then track the stage for a considerable length of time and determine whether another corrective burn will be required. At 6 hours 25 minutes into the mission, this is Mission Control, Houston.
0062706|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 6 hours 27 minutes. Booster systems engineer has just reported to the Flight Director that the S-IVB stage is in good shape, with 14 hours life time remaining. The limiting factor on the S-IVB is the battery life. Fourteen hours of battery life remaining on the S-IVB.
0062847|CDR|Hello, Houston; how do you read CDR?
0062852|CC|Read you loud and clear, Gene.
0062855|CDR|Okay.
0062931|LMP|Bob, LMP's going off the air for a little while.
0062934|CC|Roger, Jack.
0062939|LMP|It sounded like a sigh of relief.
0062941|CC|No, sir. Been enjoying listening to you; keeping - keep me awake down here.
0062948|LMP|You had a long day.
0062949|CC|Not as long as you've had.
0062952|LMP|I've just been lying around, floating around.
0062956|CC|You make it sound so good.
0063000|LMP|Piece of cake. I'll talk to you in a little while.
0063005|CC|Yes, sir.
0063326|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 6 hours 34 minutes. Apollo 17, now 26,553 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity 11,606 feet per second.
0063955|CMP|Houston, Apollo 17.
0064000|CC|Go ahead, Ron.
0064003|CMP|Okay; we had another MASTER ALARM, and I just glanced up and it was the MAIN A UNDERVOLT light that was on, just for a second.
0064018|CC|Okay. Ron, we didn't see anything at all on MAIN A down here. We did have an ACCUMULATOR cycle again. Don't know if that ties in or not.
0064028|CMP|Well, the MAIN A UNDERVOLT - I just happened to be looking right at the panel and the MAIN A UNDERVOLT light blinked on for a second. And, of course, obviously, MAIN A is up now.
0064045|CC|Roger.
0064145|CC|Ron, Houston here. We've checked the back room and the high-speed charts and that and don't see any glitch on MAIN A at all on our data down here.
0064157|CDR|Okay, Bob.
0064859|PAO|This is Apollo Control. It's 6 hours 49 minutes. Apollo 17 is 28,232 nautical miles from Earth; velocity 11,291 feet per second. We're continuing to operate at present on the normal GET of the flight plan, normal Ground Elapsed Time. Under that schedule the crews rest period will begin about 9 hours and 15 minutes into the mission. If, however, the crew completes the activities that are scheduled in the flight plan early, the rest period will probably begin early if they so desire. However, at the present time we are continuing to operate on the GET of the flight plan. At 6 hours 50 minutes, this is Mission Control, Houston.
0065000|PAO|On the GET of the Flight Plan. At 6 hours 50 minutes, this is Mission Control, Houston.
0070658|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 7 hours 7 minutes. Apollo 17 has just passed the 30,000 mile mark on its journey to the Moon. Now, at 30,039 nautical miles, velocity continuing to decrease now 10,932 feet per second.
0071010|CMP|Houston, 17. That was O2 FLOW HIGH.
0071014|CC|Roger. We copied that one. We saw it. Just about ready to call you when you called us Just now.
0071023|CMP|Okay. Mighty fine.
0071451|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 7 hours 15 minutes. Astronaut Bob Parker is now relieving Astronaut Bob Overmyer at the CAPCOM console and the commander of the backup crew, Captain John Young, has just left the control room. He has been sitting at the CAPCOM console with Overmyer since returning from the Cape early this morning. So the next CAPCOM voice you will hear will be that of Bob Parker.
0073401|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 7 hours 34 minutes. Apollo 17 now 32,697 nautical miles from earth velocity 10,457 feet per second. The crew a little over midway in the scheduled meal period in the flight plan.
0074958|LMP|Houston, 17.
0074959|CC|Roger. Go 17.
0075003|LMP|That little MASTER ALARM there, I can't be absolutely positive, but out of the corner of my eye, I think it was the SUIT COMPRESSOR light that glitched.
0075015|CC|Okay. We copy that. You - we believe down here it was the HIGH O2 FLOW.
0075022|LMP|Well, they're pretty close. I thought it was red and I thought, okay; that's good. That's the right time, I guess.
0075029|CC|Okay; because we'd just called it out. I was just read for you 5 seconds before you called me.
0075036|LMP|Very good, Doctor.
0075039|CC|Roger. And Stoney is back in Houston on the console.
0075042|LMP|That's hard to believe. What are you doing back here? We're - we haven't even had time to go to sleep.
0075046|CC|Well, I tell you, it's a tale that's hard to believe. It's almost as miraculous as your escape from the pad tonight.
0075106|LMP|Did you enjoy the launch?
0075108|CC|Beautiful.
0075120|LMP|You've seen one night launch, you've seen them all. Huh, Parker?
0075215|CMP|We go to SCS. Okay.
0075236|CMP|Never know if this is it or not but we'll try it.
0075252|CMP|Dust whipping all over the place. The stars in there -
0075433|CMP|... Yes, let's do it a little better now.
0075644|LMP|... Bob, mag November November is 130 now. And I just took another set of Earth pictures.
0075657|CC|Okay. Copy that. November November at 130.
0075707|CMP|And, Houston, 17. You copying the torquing angles now?
0075715|CC|Roger. Stand by.
0075721|CC|Okay. We have them, and you're GO to torque them.
0075725|CMP|Okay. I'll torque it at 58:10.
0075758|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 7 hours 58 minutes. Ron Evans is realigning the inertial platform that was scheduled on the flight plan for 8 hours 15 minutes. That indicates that they are running 15 to 20 minutes ahead of the flight plan. Jack Schmitt is obviously taking some pictures. He gave Bob Parker a report on a film magazine that he was using.
0075901|CMP|... REFSMMAT.
0075904|CC|And, 17, we have a preferred REFSMMAT standing by if you want to give us ACCEPT, and we'll send it up before you do your second P52.
0075914|CMP|Okay, you have P00 and ACCEPT now.
0075919|CC|Roger. Understand we have updata. It's coming at you. And, Ron, while we're sending it up to you, we'll also send you an update on the zero trunnion bias, as per the Flight Plan.
0075937|CMP|Okay. Mighty fine.
0080009|CMP|Somewhere. There it goes.
0080032|CMP|There they are, right there.
0080236|CC|Okay, 17 - Ron, you can go to BLOCK now. You've got your PTC REFSMMAT. You're free to do a P52 option 1 if you want. And, be advised we are suspicious from time to time you may have an open mike there.
0080251|CMP|Okay. Thank you, Bob.
0081005|CMP|Okay, Houston. Those are the differences in the gyro torque and I'll torque it - oh, 11, I guess. Eight ... 11.
0081014|CC|Okay. Copy that.
0081207|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 8 hours 12 minutes. Apollo 17 now 36,353 nautical miles from Earth, velocity 9,878 feet per second.
0081332|CC|Apollo 17, Houston. Over.
0081335|CDR|Go ahead.
0081337|CC|Roger. We've been discussing the question of what your sleep configuration is going to be in terms of headsets or not, particularly with reference to all of these various MASTER ALARMs. And I guess we'd feel better if one of you guys slept with his headset on. We were curious as to what your plans are.
0081401|CDR|Bob, since I've got to wear the biomed anyway, I might just as well go ahead and keep it on.
0081407|CC|Okay. The other option is for us, if we were trying to get hold of you, is to put the Klaxon up. But we're a little - un-in-favor of that, because of the possibility of one of these spurious things waking everybody up that way.
0081422|CDR|Yes, I'll go ahead and keep it on and see how it works out for a while.
0081427|CC|Okay. We copy that. And, when you guys are ready, we have a couple of - we have three items to read up to you, three updates in the Flight Plan.
0081452|LMP|Okay. Go ahead, Bob.
0081453|CC|Okay. The firsts in the Flight Plan itself, and it's the quads for the PTC spinup, and they'll be Alfa and Bravo.
0081519|LMP|Okay. For PTC spinup, quads Alfa and Bravo.
0081524|CC|All right, we just took that back. It should be Bravo and Delta for spinup; Alfa and Bravo only for damping. Copy Bravo and Delta for spinup; Alfa and Bravo for damping.
0081704|CC|And, 17, if you have that, I have two others. One's the Flight Plan Supplement Book, and the other one is in the G&C Checklist.
0081716|LMP|Okay. Go with the Supplement.
0081718|CC|Okay. In the Flight Plan Supplement, we have an E-LOAD update on page 1-43. Say; 1-43 - can give me a call when you get to that page?
0081742|LMP|Okay, Bob. I'm there.
0081744|CC|Okay. Under line - it's 30704, column Bravo - you'll find currently 33550. And let me give you a word of warning. When we change this, we'll be changing it again around 67 hours. These are primarily due to the launch delay. And we'll give you another GET update of this sort later on. The new number to replace 3 - -
0081815|LMP|Bob--
0081815|CC|Go ahead.
0081817|LMP|Let me get a pencil, please.
0081817|CC|Okay.
0081818|LMP|I'll use that instead of a pen.
0081820|CC|Okay.
0081921|LMP|Go ahead.
0081922|CC|Okay. Under - Again, I remind you, 30704 column Bravo, which was 33550, is now 34761. The line just below it, which is 05, also in column Bravo, is 15403. Over.
0081951|LMP|Okay, Bob. For 30704 Bravo, 34761; and for 31005 Bravo, 15403.
0082004|CC|Okay. Very good. And the next one is in the G&C Checklist under the P37 block data. And to help you find it, that's on page 4-23.
0082039|CMP|Okay. Go ahead.
0082041|CC|Okay. On the lift-off plus 15, be the first block. It's 01500, 3893, minus 174, 05756. The second block for lift-off plus 25 is 05 - Pardon me, start over again there; 02500, 6651, minus 175, 05725. Over.
0082137|CMP|Okay, Houston; Apollo 17. First one would be 01500, a DELTA-V of 3893, minus 174, and GET 400 K is 05756. The other one is Tig of 02500, DELTA-V of 6651, longitude of minus 175. GET of 400K is 05725.
0082214|CC|Roger. Good readback.
0082232|LMP|Okay, Bob. This is Jack. I'm going to be moving into the pre-sleep checklist here. Are there any things you want to change or alter in that? Are you ready for the waste - waste stowage vent to be closed?
0082249|CC|Roger, 17. We're ready for the vent valve to go closed. WASTE STOWAGE VENT to CLOSED. And we have no anticipated changes, at the present time, in the Flight Plan, Jack.
0082305|LMP|Okay, I'm just looking at 1-29 in the pre-sleep checklist and - wondering if there was anything there.
0082319|CC|Stand by, Jack.
0082400|CC|Okay, 17. For antenna management tonight we'd like you to select OMNI Bravo at the current time, and stow the high-gain antenna. And we'll take care of managing our antennas from here on.
0082419|CMP|Okay. We'll give you OMNI Bravo and stow the high-gain.
0082425|CC|Okay.
0082453|CC|And, Jack, we indeed do not have anything to add to the presleep checklist tonight.
0082506|LMP|Okay.
0082514|LMP|And - with your concurrence, I'll take the H2 FANS all to AUTO now.
0082522|CC|Stand by.
0082526|CC|Roger. We're ready for that. All to AUTO.
0082628|CC|Okay, Jack. I guess that you - we're not quite sure what you said or meant there - or what - what it is. In the Flight Plan itself, we want H2 HEATERS 1 and 2 to AUTO, and we want H2 FANS, on tank 3 only, to AUTO. They're three there for H2 tank 3.
0082653|LMP|Okay. You're teaching me to read carefully early, aren't you?
0082657|CC|We're trying. The 1 and 2 HEATERS will be in AUTO and 3 FAN will be in AUTO.
0082704|LMP|That's the way it is now, and consider the fans have been cycled.
0082708|CC|Roger.
0082712|LMP|According to the checklist, you might look at the third line on 1-29, and look at the H2 line on the Flight Plan, and see why I was confused.
0082737|CC|Roger. We were just discussing whether or not there was a fan or fans in each tank.
0082744|LMP|That ought to keep you awake this morning.
0082747|CC|Going to take something.
0082754|LMP|What I was really trying to do, Bob, was get out of chlorinating the potable water, but you wouldn't bite.
0082814|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 8 hours 28 minutes. Apollo 17 now 37,832 nautical miles from Earth; velocity 9,667 feet per second. Apollo 17 crew in the period now in the flight plan where they're making preparations for their rest period. Getting the systems in the proper configuration for a sleep period. The spacecraft has been maneuvered to the passive thermal control or PTC mode - attitude, rather. And just prior to the rest period the crew will spin up the spacecraft for thermal control during the rest period. The spin rate will be slow or approximately 3 revolutions of the spacecraft per hour but it will keep the thermal balance on the spacecraft. At 8 hours 30 minutes, this is Mission Control, Houston.
0083043|CC|Apollo 17, Houston. Over, Jack.
0083048|LMP|Go ahead. Over, Bob.
0083050|CC|Okay. We're going to give you a little high-gain antenna practice here. We'd like to pick up with the high-gain antenna again so that we can get your PTC or can watch your PTC develop. We'd like you to go to a PITCH of 40 and YAW of 275 on the HIGH GAIN. That's 40, PITCH: 275, YAW; and MANUAL and WIDE. Over.
0083127|LMP|Okay. You want the high gain selected, I presume.
0083129|CC|That helps, yes.
0083133|LMP|You got it.
0083135|CC|Roger. Our apologies.
0083144|LMP|Oh, I don't expect that'll be the last time you have to apologize. I think we're running about even now.
0083206|LMP|You're missing quite a view, Bob. Sorry you're not here.
0083212|CC|That makes two of us. Weitz just said, "That makes three of us."
0083231|LMP|What are you trying to tell me?
0083236|CC|Look out.
0083239|LMP|Who's your friend off on your right, tonight?
0083245|CC|Wally Moon, would you believe?
0083250|LMP|Say again?
0083251|CC|Wally Moon.
0083252|LMP|Oh, a Moon, huh? Why don't you ask him what he's reading at H2 tank 3 quantity?
0083305|CC|Okay. I'm asking him.
0083316|LMP|In percent.
0083321|CC|Okay, 17. On tanks 3 of H2, we're reading 84.38.
0083330|LMP|Okay, it looks like we're reading almost the same nowadays.
0083337|CC|That's Good.
0083339|LMP|I thought we launched a little bias, but I guess that's gone now. We're a little higher than that.
0083527|CC|And, 17, Houston. We're seeing your rates are quite low enough to start the spinup to PTC.
0083545|CMP|Okay. We'll see if we can't get it right this time.
0083835|CMP|Houston, 17.
0083836|CC|Go ahead, 17.
0083838|CMP|Does it make any difference with the plus or minus roll there with the - now that you are going to use the high gain?
0083851|CC|Okay. Well, the Flight Plan says minus roll, why don't we do it that way?
0083858|CMP|Oh, okay.
0083901|CC|And after you start the roll, 17, we'd like to go back to OMNI Bravo and stow the high gain.
0083909|CMP|Okay.
0083911|CC|We only needed the high gain to just keep a good check on your rates.
0083932|CC|And, 17, that means stow the high gain after you - after the startup. We'd like to watch the startup itself.
0083940|LMP|Okay. I was just going to ask you when.
0084220|CC|Okay, 17 - We're ready for high gain to stow and select OMNI Bravo.
0084229|LMP|Okay.
0084935|CC|17, Houston. We gather you're ready for sleep, almost. One thing we'd like to check at the end here is your O2 heater configuration. Over.
0084948|CDR|Okay. Go ahead, Bob .
0084950|CC|Roger, Gene. Can you give us your O2 heater configuration?
0084954|CDR|Okay. We've got 1 and 2 in AUTO, and 3 is OFF.
0085000|CC|Okay. We'd like those per the Flight Plan; 1 and 2 to OFF, and 3 to AUTO.
0085008|CDR|Okay; 1 and 2 to OFF and 3 to AUTO.
0085012|CC|Okay. And do you have a final change or update on the film status - beyond that 130 that Jack gave us?
0085021|CDR|Stand by 1.
0085505|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 8 hours 55 minutes. As the crew of Apollo 17 prepares for a 5-3/4 hours rest period, the spacecraft is 40,165 nautical miles from earth velocity 9,349 feet per second.
0085804|CC|And, 17, your PTC is looking real good so far.
0085810|CDR|Okay. That number on that mag is still 130, Bob.
0085813|CC|Okay. I copy that, Gene.
0085816|CMP|And Alfa Alfa, that 16-millimeter mag, is about 25 percent left.
0085823|CC|Okay; copy that as well.
0085835|CC|And I guess as soon as you change the LiOH canister, if you have or haven't, and charge BATTERY Bravo, then we're ready for you to go to sleep at your leisure. Configuring your comm, remember the SQUELCH, ENABLE, and the VOICE, OFF, when you get ready to go to sleep.
0085931|CC|Roger, Apollo 17. We copy the film update, and we're ready for you to go to sleep once you've got the LiOH canister changed, if you haven't. And remember also the charge on brady - BATTERY Bravo. After that, it's just the comm configuration, SQUELCH, ENABLE, and VOICE, OFF, when you get ready to go to sleep.
0085931|LMP|Bob, You're cut in and out. Stand by. We'll talk to you in a minute.
0090000|CC|Okay, I think we're losing an OMNI here.
0090001||REST PERIOD - NO COMMUNICATIONS
0091233|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 9 hours, 12 minutes. Apollo 17 now, 41,677 nautical miles from Earth, velocity 9,159 feet per second. The spacecraft has stabilized into a passive thermal control mode now. It is completing one revolution every 18 minutes.
0092558|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 9 hours 26 minutes. The Booster Systems Engineer has advised Flight Director Pete Frank that a second midcourse correction for the S-IVB, the third stage of the launch vehicle will be required. This maneuver is performed with the auxiliary propulsion system of the S-IVB, and the Booster Systems Engineer will command this burn at 11 hours 15 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The magnitude of the burn is not known at this time. That will be determined shortly before the midcourse is performed. The purpose is to tune up the trajectory to more precisely target the S-IVB stage to the desired impact point on the lunar surface. Tracking to this point of the spacecraft indicates that a midcourse correction will probably be performed for the spacecraft at the scheduled midcourse number 2 time at 35 hours and 30 minutes. A preliminary look - that's a very early look shows it to be about 10-1/2 feet per second, but that will be refined as we get closer to the time. At 9 hours 27 minutes, this is Mission Control Houston.
0093044|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 9 hours 30 minutes. We have had no voice communications with the crew for some time now. But we do have indications that they have not yet fully configured the spacecraft for their rest period. Normally the voice switch is turned off the last step before the rest period. That voice switch is still on. Apollo 17 now 43,261 nautical miles away from Earth, velocity 8,964 feet per second.
0094802|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 9 hours 48 minutes. From the data that he is receiving, the Flight Surgeon, Dr. Sam Pool, reports that he believes the spacecraft Commander Gene Cernan is asleep. Cernan is the only member of the crew who is wearing the biomedical harness during the rest period, and therefore, is the only one that the flight surgeon is getting measurements on. But the indications are that Cernan is asleep and apparently the entire crew has gone to sleep. Apollo 17 now 44,749 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity 8,794 feet per second. The awake clock as operating in the Control Center shows wake up for the crew in 5 hours 10 minutes 37 seconds.
0095855|PAO|This is Apolio Control at 9 hours 59 minutes. The Flight Dynamics Officer, Bill Boone, has computed the half way marks for the spacecraft in both time and distance. We'll give those to you now. Apollo 17 will reach the half way point in distance at a Ground Elapsed Time of 30 hours 3 minutes. Its distance from both the Moon and the Earth at that time will be 114,787 nautical miles. Its velocity, referenced to the Earth, will be 4,522 feet per second; referenced to the Moon, 3,826 feet per second. The half way mark in time will be reached at a Ground Elapsed Time of 43 hours 8 minutes 6 seconds. At that time Apollo 17 will be 144,924 miles from the Earth, with an Earth reference to velocity of 3,551 feet per second. And it will be 87,561 nautical miles from the Moon, with a Moon referenced velocity of 3,403 feet per second. Apollo 17 will cross the lunar sphere of influence at the Ground Elapsed Time of 70 hours 43 minutes 24 seconds, at which time it will be 190,725 nautical miles from the Moon. Earth referenced velocity 2,340 feet per second. Distance from the Moon at that time, 33,639 nautical miles, with the lunar referenced velocity of 3,356 feet per second. At 10 hours 1 minute into the mission, this is Mission Control Houston.
0102937|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 10 hours 29 minutes. Apollo 17 now, 48,070 nautical miles from Earth, velocity 8,434 feet per second. Pete Frank and the orange team of flight controllers getting ready to hand over to Gerry Griffin and his gold team of flight controllers at this time. Astronaut Bob Parker will remain as the CAPCOM for a good deal of this next shift. Several spurrious master alarms that were seen while the spacecraft was still in Earth orbit are as yet unexplained. There are no obvious reasons for them. The spacecraft experts in the back rooms, the support rooms here at the Mission Control Center are still tracking this situation. It's not considered a serious problem. The more recent master alarms that have occurred during this shift and during the translunar coast phase after Apollo 17 burned translunar insertion, are attributed to a higher than normal oxygen flow at regular intervals in the cabin. The cabin is still being purged of the partial nitrogen atmosphere that it contained at launch that is being purged, a vent valve is open in the cabin and the higher than normal O2-rate has been introduced to help purge the cabin. Now, added to that when the water accumulator in the suit circuit cycles, there is a brief increase of oxygen flow over and above the higher than normal flow that we are using to purge the cabin. And this is just high enough to when the water accumulator cycles it brings it up just high enough to trigger the master alarm. It is not a problem. The last three or four master alarms that we have seen are attributed to this. However, the Earth orbit master alarms are not yet accounted for. But, they are not considered to be a serious problem. During this shift a midcourse correction number 1 was performed on the SIV-B stage of the launch vehicle, 13 feet per second performed with the auxilary propulsion system. A second midcourse for that third stage of launch vehicle is planned at a Ground Elapsed Time of 11 hours 15 minutes. The magnitude of the burn is not - is not yet known. These midcourses are to tune up the trajectory of that stage, to bring it closer to the desired impact point on the lunar surface. As far as the spacecraft is concerned midcourse correction number 1 was passed. We did not perform midcourse correction number 1. The magnitude at that time was less than 3 feet per second. We will probably perform a midcourse correction number 2 at 35 hours and 30 minutes. A preliminary look at that indicates about a 10-1/2 foot per second burn at that time. The Mission is going well. We have not heard from the crew for some time now and are confident that they are asleep. The spacecraft is in passive thermal-contro1 mode, stabilized in 1 revolution every 18 minutes, approximately 3 per hour. The crew is scheduled to be awakened 4 hours, 24 minutes from this time. At 10 hours 35 minutes into the Mission, this is Mission Control, Houston.
0112700|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 11 hours 27 minutes Ground Elapsed Time into the mission of Apollo 17. Approximately 11 minutes ago, as you were 6 minutes ago, the S-IVB corrective burn was performed roughly 14.2 feet per second to modify the trajectory of the S-IVB third stage in the Saturn V, targeting for impact just west of the crater Ptolemaeus at latitude 7 degrees south by longitude 8 degrees west. However, the actual impact location and the time of impact will be forthcoming after some additional hours of tracking of the stage has been gathered. We're looking now at a midcourse correction burn number 2 of the Apollo 17 spacecraft at 35 hours 30 minutes, with a change in velocity - a posigrade of 10.5 feet per second. Some 3-1/2 hours remaining in the crew rest period. All three apparently sound asleep at this time. And the passive thermal control mode puts the spacecraft at spinning at some 3 revolutions per hour. To repeat earlier statistics on half way in distance, time, and when the so-called sphere of influence is crossed will be at the half way point in distance at 30 hours and 3 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, in which time it will be 114,787 nautical miles either direction to the Earth or Moon. And a half way point in time will occur at 43 hours 8 minutes and 6 seconds when the spacecraft will be 144,924 nautical miles out from Earth; and 87,561 nautical miles out from the Moon. The so-called sphere crossing, or the point in which the spacecraft is assumed to come under the gravitational influence of the Moon, will take place at 70 hours 43 minutes 24 seconds when the spacecraft is 33,639 nautical miles out from the Moon and approaching. The air/ground circuit has been up all of this time since the crew has retired for a fairly brief rest period, and at this time we will take down the air/ground circuit until the wakeup call is made some 3 hours 29 minutes from now. And at 11 hours 30 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
0122700|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 12 hours 27 minutes Ground Elapsed Time into the mission of Apollo 17. And Apollo 17 at the present time is 56,948 nautical miles out from earth at a velocity of 7,609 feet per second. A short time ago the Booster Systems Engineer Frank Van Renseler reported that after the final APS burn in the S-IVB stage, which is targeting the stage to impact on the Moon, he reported that the S-IVB stage was tumbling intentionally, after that burn, and as he gathered up all his documents and packed his briefcase, he, on the flight directors loop, he said, "I've enjoyed working with you on the Apollo program." Flight Director in training Neil Hutchinson replied "It's been nice riding with you." The riding implication being that they were riding on his launch vehicle. Van Renseler is a Marshall Spaceflight Center Engineer detailed to the Flight Control Division here at Manned Spacecraft Center. Van Rensleser finished his job for the last time. He packed his launch vehicle documents and left the room. The booster systems console is vacant for the final time in Apollo. Some 2-1/2 hours remaining in the crew sleep period. No word from the crew. They have not talked to the ground nor vice versa in the last several hours and at 12 hours 29 minutes this is Apollo Control.
0132700|PAO|This is Apollo Control 13 hours, 27 minutes Ground Elapsed Time into the mission of Apollo 17. The spacecraft presently is 61,186 nautical miles out from the Earth, decelerating slightly in its velocity now 7,272 feet per second. Crew has another hour and a half of sleep period remaining. They will be awakened about 2:30 Central Time. This is a rather short sleep period slightly under 6 hours, the object being to get the crew back on to Houston time day-night cycle eventually. The cycle is disturbed somewhat by the, - initially what would have been a night launch, and ended up being a morning launch - early morning launch - at least by Cape time. Got a hand over to the Goldstone 210-foot tracking antenna, about 8 minutes ago. And that station at the present time is handling spacecraft data, and when the crew awakens will handle the voice transmissions between the Control Center and the Crew of Apollo 17. At 13 hours, 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time this is Apollo Control.
0142700|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 14 hours 27 minutes Ground Elapsed Time into the mission of Apollo 17. Slightly more than a half hour remaining until spacecraft communicator, Robert Parker, wakes the crew of Apollo 17 up after a brief 6 hour rest period. Apollo 17 presently 65,273 nautical miles out from earth; velocity now 6,974 feet per second. And getting back on schedule with Apollo 17 because of the late liftoff and the hold situation early this morning. The translunar injection burn was targeted to get the spacecraft at the moon or into lunar orbit at about the same actual time as it would have had we launched on time - at 8:53 PM last night central time. However, to get the flight plan back on the actual indicated Ground Elapsed Times shown in the flight plan at approximately 64 hours they're going to have what is called a GET update some 2 hours and 40 minutes to force the event times in the flight plan to agree with actual Ground Elapsed Times flown in the mission. We'll come up again in about a half hour as Parker makes his initial wake up call to the crew and at 14 hours 29 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
0145753|PAO|This is Apollo Control 14 hours 57 minutes Ground Elapsed Time into the mission of Apollo 17. A 2 minutes mark remaining in the crew waken - wake period or sleep period before the crew is awakened. Spacecraft communicator, Bob Parker, should be calling them shortly and we'll stand by for that first wake up call. Rather slack day as far as crew activity today. After their post-sleep checklist checking over the systems. The flight director just advised the CAPCOM to hold off on the wake call until they switch antennas. There's some P-23 navigation sightings that will be run today, and that apparently is about all the activity scheduled during the - this work period. However, there will be at 35 hours and 30 minutes a midcourse correction number 2, which this time looks like about 10 and a half feet per second. Apollo 17 now is 67,365 nautical miles out from the Earth; velocity 6,829 feet per second. Spacecraft communicator, Bob Parker, has been joined at the CAPCOM console by backup Apollo 17 commander, John Young, and his relief CAPCOM, Gordon Fullerton. Standing by for the antenna arrangement to be sorted out. Spacecraft at this time, is still in the barbeque roll or passive thermal control mode, three revolutions per hour to stabilize the temperatures on spacecraft systems. They'll open up the air-ground circuit for the first call when it does come. At 15 hours and 1 minute, this Apollo Control.
0150245|PAO|Here we go.
0150259|CC|Apollo 17, Houston. Good morning.
0150309|CDR|Hello, Robert.
0150311|CC|Glad to have you with us again. You guys got a good night's sleep, we think.
0150316|CDR|Well, I'll tell you, it was (laughter) looked forward to.
0150331|CDR|Give us a few minutes here and we'll - get operational.
0150341|CC|Roger. Give us a call when you're ready to talk to people.
0150348|CDR|Okay.
0150944|CDR|Yes, from the looks of things, Bob, down there, it looks like getting off last night was a good idea.
0150955|CC|Got a new CAPCOM now, Geno. Why? Looks kind of cloudy down there?
0151001|CDR|Yes. Hello, Gordo. How you doing? Yes, I'm looking - oh, we're probably directly over - just west of the - out in the Pacific, but abeam of the bottom third of South America, I suppose. And I've got North America, Mexico, and the U.S. on the top third - the top 25 percent of the Earth. And it looks like you've got cloud cover from somewhere where the coast bends around Corpus right on north into the Great Lakes and is completely out into the Atlantic, including covering Florida out there.
0151043|CC|Roger. I can verify the part between the Cape and Houston, anyway.
0151057|CDR|Yes, the Gulf looks like it's pretty well filled with clouds. Looks pretty thick from here.
0151103|CC|Roger.
0151107|CDR|However, if you're interested in going to South America, the whole continent looks - looks pretty good. A few clouds; but, for the most part, you can see the entire continent.
0151118|CC|Roger. Guess it's summertime down there.
0151129|CDR|Okay, Gordo. We're - we're stirring slowly. We'll get back with you here.
0151134|CC|Okay.
0151201|CDR|Gordo, one question. How does the spacecraft look to you? I didn't hear anything all night long as far as any MASTER ALARMs or anything.
0151210|CC|I'm getting the word that nothing was seen here either. It looks absolutely super.
0151219|CDR|Very good.
0151525|CDR|Okay, Bob - or Gordo, I've got H2 HEATERS 1 and 2, OFF now.
0151532|CC|Roger, Gene.
0151652|CDR|Hello, Houston; America.
0151657|CC|Go ahead, America.
0151701|CDR|Okay, Gordo. I'm looking over the Flight Plan today. We'll be with you with the postsleep checklist, and primarily it looks like a P-23 day for Ron And what we'd primarily like to do is spend a good part of that time getting the spacecraft cleaned up, reshuffled, restowed a little bit, and get it in order for the next few days ahead. It doesn't look like today's that big of a day.
0151733|CC|Okay. Geno, I might give you some words on what we have in mind to get the GET back in sync here, if - if you want to hear those while you're looking through the upcoming hours.
0151757|CDR|Yes, why don't you - why don't you pass a few words on that?
0151801|CC|Okay. The plan we're considering, and we're offering it to you now for your opinion, is at 65 hours GET, we'll update, and at the time the clock goes to 65, we'll update it 2 hours and 40 minutes to 67:40. And we're shaping your trajectory such that you'll arrive at the Moon at the same time GMT as you would have had you launched on time. In other words, your translunar time is 2 hours and 40 minutes less. So once we do that, we'll be back with all the right times in the Flight Plan without any updating. And the one thing we think of is that your next day will, which is now a 16-hour day, will shorten to a 13-hour and 20-minute day-. But that's about the only real effect we can see. How does that sound?
0151907|CDR|Yes, we - we'll get to the Moon, you say, the same GMT, so all our sunrise, sunset, lunar-orbit activities, and Sun angle at landing will be the same. And let me - I'll - it sounds pretty good, Gordo. I just want to take a look at that day that you're shortening and see what we're doing in there.
0151927|CC|Okay. It doesn't cut out anything. In fact, we picked a time that's pretty much dead time as far as the Flight Plan goes. Take a look, and we'll talk about it later.
0151939|CDR|Okay.
0151945|LMP|Good morning, Gordy. This is Jack.
0151947|CC|Good morning, Jack.
0151955|LMP|Let me fill my square on the postsleep checklist. I've got 24030, PRD.
0152007|CC|Okay.
0152009|LMP|And I slept in and out - probably totaled about 4 hours in that last period. But I feel pretty good in spite of that, and expect now that I've educated myself on how to sleep, that it'll pick up the next time around.
0152027|CC|Roger.
0152032|LMP|No medication yet, but I'm considering a couple of aspirin. I'll let you know if I take them.
0152037|CC|Roger.
0152041|LMP|And, fluids? Let's see, I guess I've had two of your little water-measurement-containers full so far, plus the meal I had in my pocket. And I'll catch up on - I think I'm a little dehydrated. I'll catch up on fluids with breakfast.
0152100|CC|Okay.
0152102|LMP|And my meal yesterday was the meal B in the pocket.
0152108|CC|Roger. Meal B.
0152118|LMP|And I guess consumables update. That's mainly yours.
0152125|CC|Roger.
0152125|LMP|There's plenty there. And I'll wait for your words on that. And the watch is wound.
0152131|CC|Roger. Okay. Got the consumables update numbers, if you're ready to copy.
0152145|LMP|Not quite, Gordy. I'll give you a buzz.
0152147|CC|Okay. No hurry.
0152237|LMP|Okay. The CMPs rad's, 1509.
0152243|CC|Okay.
0152243|LMP|15019. 15019.
0152248|CC|Roger.
0152333|LMP|Gordy, this is Jack. How do you want to send the consumable - consumables information?
0152340|CC|We were just discussing that here. Used to - in flights gone by, there was a place in the Flight Plan, a little form to fill out. But we're trying to figure out if there is such a place in the current data file. Do you know of one?
0152355|LMP|Well, I'll tell you what I've got. I've got the consumables curves, and if there are any major changes to those curves, I guess you could give them to me, and I'll put them on as points.
0152409|CC|There's no - -
0152410|CDR|Page -
0152410|CC|- - changes at all.
0152414|LMP|Okay. And why don't we just do it that way in the future in case there is anything. And that's on page 1-45 and subsequent in the Flight Plan Supplement.
0152425|CC|Okay.
0152431|LMP|Looks like you took good care of my space - my systems last night.
0152436|CC|No troubles at all.
0153059|LMP|Okay, Gordy. Your friendly medical officer up here has some more information for you. CMP, continuing, had about 3 hours of sleep, had - three cans of fluid, of water that is. And he ate everything in meal B but the fruitcake, and he didn't use the brownies and the beverage in meal C.
0153133|CC|Okay.
0153230|LMP|Okay. And continuing, the CDRs PD - PRD is 17019. He had 3 hours of fair sleep, no medication, and 1-1/2 cans of water, and one-half a sandwich. The CMPs sleep was 3 hours. And I'll try to get more systematic as we go along here.
0153257|CC|Okay.
0153321|CC|Jack, we are assuming no - no medication on the CMP. is that right?
0153328|LMP|That's affirm. We haven't gotten that kit out yet
0153332|CC|Okay.
0160055|LMP|Gordy, this is Jack. Looks like the windows have cleared up pretty well in PTC from the - ice crystals, anyway, that were on window - window 1. The hatch window still seems to have a film of something on it. But, otherwise, they look pretty good.
0160113|CC|Okay, sounds good. Jack, while you're there, I might try - we've been talking about consumable updates and what would be the most meaningful way to give you the information. As a trial, for 14 hours, with reference to the charts in the back of the book, which in the case of - in case of all of them, are listed in percentages except the RCS, which is in pounds. On the cryo quantities, when I take all the tank percentages and plot them, it turns out that there's no real significant difference from the lines that are plotted on either hydrogen or oxygen. On RCS, you're running about 3 percent ahead of the line. And if that's a satisfactory way to put it, that's the way we'll give you the - the updates rather than giving you every tank percent by percent. Over.
0160225|CMP|Okay, that's good. That's outstanding.
0161220|LMP|MARK. Two aspirin for the LMP.
0161220|CC|Roger, LMP.
0161332|CC|Jack, next time the Surgeon would like a mark on each individual aspirin.
0161342|LMP|Well, I gave it to you since I swallowed them both simultaneously.
0161347|CC|Roger.
0161351|LMP|I knew they wanted that, Gordy, and that's why I only gave you one.
0161356|CC|Okay.
0161357|LMP|Would they rather have them go down one at a time?
0161405|CC|I'll have to go back to the backroom on that.
0162506|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 16 hours and 25 minutes. The Crew of Apollo 17 is now presently in a meal period. A little bit of levity a short time ago when Jack Schmitt, Lunar Module Pilot, called down to say: "This is LMP, mark, 2 aspirin." He had mentioned earlier in his post-sleep checklist that he was considering taking two aspirins. Apollo 17 is presently 72,843 nautical miles out from Earth. Velocity 6,477 feet per second. We're continuing to stand by on the air-ground circuit for further conversation as the crew finishes up their meal period and gets what few flight plan updates are involved in the days activity. At 016:26 and standing by, this is Apollo Control.
0164444|CC|17, Houston. We see the optic starting to stir there, you can go ahead with a P52, but before you do the P23, we have some updates to it.
0164457|CMP|Hey, okay, Gordo. We'll do that.
0164534|CC|17, Houston. Can you confirm that you did change the LiOH canister before going to sleep last night?
0164543|CMP|Well, we can confirm that we didn't. How about that?
0164548|CC|Okay.
0164548|CMP|We'll - Thanks - thanks for reminding us. We'll try that first thing this morning. I was just getting too tired, and the CO2 didn't look quite that high last night, so I - -
0164600|CC|Roger.
0164600|CMP|- - I let it go.
0164607|CC|Okay, that's - that's fine. We're not concerned about being late with it.
0164614|CMP|Okay.
0165305|CMP|Okay, Houston. That looks like a pretty good one that time. You note the star angle difference?
0165311|CC|Roger. We copy.
0165315|CMP|Okay (chuckle). I can't see squat out through that telescope. I just hope it lines it up and does the right thing. Okay. Those are the torquing angles, and you can let me know when you have them.
0165333|CC|Okay. Stand by.
0165338|CMP|The telescope is no different than any other time. There is just a lot of reflection from the lunar module. And even though everybody said that before, you don't quite believe it until you see it yourself.
0165408|CC|Okay, Ron. You're clear to torque it.
0165412|CMP|Okay. We'll torque it at 54:30.
0165416|CC|Okay.
0165525|CC|17, Houston. When you - if you can find a stenographer, I got some dictation, some pads for you and also a Flight Plan update.
0165550|CMP|Stand by 1, Gordo.
0165738|LMP|Okay, Gordy.
0165741|CMP|P37.
0165742|LMP|Oh, okay. Stand by. Okay, Ron's ready to copy.
0165752|CMP|P37 pad's first.
0165754|CC|Okay. Okay, the P37 block data for 35 hours. Well, we've got 35, 45, 55, 65. GET ignition of 035:00. DELTA-Vt is 5326, minus 175, 081:39. For a GET of 045:00, 7728, minus 177, 081:18. For a GET of 055:00, 5859, minus 175, 105:30. GET of 065:00, 4703, minus 175, 129:40.
0165934|CMP|Okay, I'll read that. Let's see, 35:00 at 5326, minus 175, and 81:39. At 45:00, 7728, minus 177, and 81:18. At 55:00, it's 5859, minus 175, 105:30. At 65:00, it's 4703, minus 175, and 129:40.
0170011|CC|Okay, that's correct. I've got a maneuver pad for you. It's a flyby maneuver at a time of 81 hours, which is 5 hours prior to LOI, This is required because you're presently on an impacting trajectory. And this is assuming you wouldn't do midcourse 2. Midcourse 2 will put you on a - on the proper trajectory. If you can get a maneuver pad out, I'll give it to you.
0170044|LMP|Okay. That's in work.
0170211|CMP|Okay, Houston. This is 17. Ready for the flyby pad.
0170223|CC|Okay, Ron. We were just watching your roll angle. You're going to - we're going to be updating the optics cal attitude. And the roll will be 164, and you're coming up on that. Maybe you want to stop the PTC near that roll angle first.
0170241|CMP|Hey, that's a good idea.
0170248|LMP|Gordy ...
0170310|LMP|Gordy, did you read Jack?
0170312|CC|Loud and clear, Jack.
0170314|LMP|I can take the pad, if you want to while Ron stops PTC.
0170320|CC|Okay. Why don't I give you the update to the Flight Plan, since that'll give you the new attitude and also the - change in the star for the P23. And then Ron can get on with that. The pad we can get after that.
0170336|LMP|Go ahead.
0170338|CC|Okay. Turn to 17 hours in the Flight Plan, page 18.
0170355|LMP|Go ahead.
0170357|CC|Okay. The "VERB 49 maneuver to optics cal attitude" right at the top of the page. Cross out the attitude numbers and replace them with "Roll 164, pitch 301, and yaw 348 at a high-gain pitch angle of minus 48 and a yaw of 315. Over.
0170434|LMP|Okay; 164, 301, 348, minus 48, and 315.
0170440|CC|That's correct. Now go down a few lines to the sighting attitude at - one's at 17 hours and 15 minutes. And cross out that attitude and the high-gain pitch angle and change to a Roll of 196, pitch 304, and yaw 348. High-gain pitch is minus 61, and the yaw remains the same, 357. Over.
0170516|LMP|Okay, 196, 304, 348, minus 61.
0170522|CC|That's correct. And now, on the first star of P23, we're going to change the star, so cross out - replace the NOUN 70 numbers with star 21. That would be three balls 21. And delete the NOUN 88 and the vector numbers there.
0170612|LMP|Okay, start 21 and no NOUN 88s.
0170616|CC|Right. And over on the right where it says "Merak," you can write in "Alphard." That's what 21 is.
0170635|LMP|Okay.
0170636|CC|Okay. Now down on the next page, at 18 hours 20 minutes, where it says "Optics calibration attitude." We got to put in the same thing as - the same change as above. We want, instead of 175, 298, 330, change that to 164, 301, and 348. High gain of minus 48 and 315. Over.
0170715|LMP|Okay, 164, 301, 348, minus 48, 315. Over.
0170721|CC|Okay. Now, about 10 lines down, delete "Charge battery A." We're going to leave battery A charged for a while longer, since we used up so much of it on the pad last night.
0170741|LMP|Okay. Delete "Battery charge A," and you want to leave it on B.
0170744|CC|Yes. Right. Flip the page. Might as well clean up all of these checklist changes. At 19 hours 40 minutes, change "Magazine Kilo Kilo" to "Magazine November November."
0170805|LMP|Okay. That's done.
0170806|CC|And then skip a few pages to 24 hours and 30 minutes
0170820|LMP|Go ahead.
0170821|CC|And just above the "CSM Systems Checklist" callout there, write in "Charge battery A."
0170837|LMP|Okay, I got you.
0170840|CC|And we'll be leaving it on battery A all night long. Okay, that's all the Flight Plan changes. I've got that flyby pad when you're ready.
0170855|LMP|Okay, I'm all set.
0170858|CC|Okay. Purpose is flyby, SPS/G&N. The weight is 66839; plus 1.21, minus .02 - correction, the yaw trim is a minus 0.12. Ignition time is 081:17:21.03 NOUN 81 is a plus 0091.1, plus 0204.1, plus 0459.3. Attitude is 121, 153, and 321, Apogee is NA; perigee, plus 0021.2. DELTA-V total of 0510.8, 1:17, 0506.3. Sextant star: 26, 096.5, 33.9. Boresight star is NA; NOUN 61, plus 15-57, minus 175-00; 1099.9, 362.43; and GET of 0.05G is 153:24:11. PTC align stars are Sirius and Rigel; 256, 152, 069 - Ullage is none. And for remarks: number 1 is "Burn docked." number 2 assumes PTC REFSMMAT: number 3, LM weight, 36281; and number 4 is "Assumes no Midcourse 2." Over.
0171230|LMP|Okay, Gordy. You read that?
0171234|CC|I haven't heard anything since I finished the pad, Jack.
0171239|LMP|Okay. I'll push the other button then. Okay, your readback: Flyby, SPS/G&N; 66839; plus 1.21, minus 0.12; 081:17:21.03; plus 0091.1, plus 0204.1, plus 0459.3; 121, 153, 321; HA is NA, plus 0021.0; 0510.8, 1:17, 0506.3; 26, 096.5, 33.9. Boresight star is NA; plus 1557; minus 175.00; 1099-9, 362.43; 153:24:11. Sirius and Rigel; 256, 152, 069. No ullage. Remarks: 1, burn docked; 2, PTC REFSMMAT assumed; 3, LM weight, 36281; and 4, assumes no midcourse 2.
0171402|CC|Okay. One correction on perigee of NOUN 44. That's a plus 0021.2.
0171418|LMP|Okay; 0021.2 plus.
0171423|CC|And one additional remark. This results in a 187-mile perigee - perilune.
0171458|LMP|Okay. I got that.
0171500|CC|Okay. For general information, we're planning midcourse 2 tomorrow at about 35:30, and it should be about 10 feet per second.
0171516|LMP|Okay, Strangely enough, that's even scheduled at 35:30.
0171535|CC|Rog.
0171545|CC|I have one reminder to open the WASTE STOWAGE VENT valve as shown on the - at 17 hours there.
0171556|LMP|Oh, okay. We were just going back to clean up. I think we owe you a LiOH canister change, too.
0171609|CC|Roger. We concur with changing it.
0171957|CMP|And, Houston. Apollo 17 will maneuver to the optics calibration attitude now.
0172004|CC|Okeydoke.
0172008|CMP|It's funny eating potato soup, and all the soup is all around the outside of the bag. And you get a little hole right down through the middle of it.
0172022|CC|How about that?
0172042|CMP|It's just like in one G. The spoon isn't quite long enough to reach the bottom without getting your fingers on the side of the bowl.
0172051|CC|Rog.
0172353|LMP|Gordy, I don't know what your weather is like down there, but from here it looks like you're probably overcast today. Might even have a pretty good storm going.
0172404|CC|Well, it's gray and cold and a little rain, so your - your call is correct.
0172414|LMP|Yes, it looks like Mexico, in general, is pretty nice, although there is a band of east-west trending clouds that start from the Gulf of California, cross Sonora and probably up through New Mexico, and over into Texas as far around as I can see. Southern California looks like it's in pretty good shape today, but northern California looks like it's probably overcast. And a major system probably associated with that that stretches into the northern western United States. But a band of clear weather looks like it stretches from Arizona right on up through, I would guess it - through Colorado and Kansas and probably into the Midwest pretty well.
0172524|CC|Rog. You're a regular human weather satellite.
0172530|LMP|If Ron would just stop his maneuvers I'd tell you some more, but the Earth just set behind the LM.
0172538|CC|Rog.
0172540|LMP|More specifically, it set behind the Rover, which may be a space first. Pretty impressive storm system down off the west coast of Antarctica.
0172607|CC|Roger.
0172711|LMP|And, Houston. The canister has been changed. Number 3 is in A as per the earlier Flight Plan instructions.
0172724|CC|Okay.
0172726|LMP|Sorry we were late, but we got a little tired last night.
0172837|CC|Jack, Houston. We'd like you to go ahead and get that WASTE STOWAGE VENT open now, so we can keep to the schedule on cabin enrichment.
0172849|LMP|Okay; Ron is getting that. Keep nagging.
0172854|CC|Thank you.
0173528|CMP|That the same as I had before?
0173550|CMP|Hey, that looks like a pretty good optics cal right there. That's three times. Okay. No, that's not very good.
0173609|CC|Ron, we're copying your comments.
0173612|CMP|Okay. Think we'll use that one there for the optics cal.
0173620|CC|Roger.
0173641|CMP|Okay. Let's go to the old sighting attitude. Well, let's put the other thing in there first.
0173959|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 17 hours 40 minutes. In mission control at the present time we're in the midst of a shift handover. Flight Director Gene Kranz and his team of flight controllers coming on now to replace Flight Director Gerry Griffin. The spacecraft communicator at the present time is astronaut Gordon Fullerton. For the crew aboard Apollo 17 this is scheduled to be a rather short and - not too active period of time before they begin their next sleep period. They'll be performing a few midcourse navigation activities, also doing some routine maintenance on the fuel cells. And not a great deal of additional activity scheduled for them.
0174044|CMP|Yes. That's a pretty good VERB 49. I got the - got an orange Earth in the sextant. Let me put up the old EMP now. If you all don't need all that light in there, Jack, I could sure - Like the window shade might help a little bit, really. Not - not very much. Okay. Address 304, we want 06. Address 305, 24 44; 306, 60 06 ENTER; 307 was 77. Okay, at address 310, we want 15 62 ENTER; 311, we want a 52 05 ENTER; 330, we'll VERB 30 37. VERB 25 NOUN 26 ENTER 1. Okay. R-2 is a 44 ENTER. R-3 is a 140 - 5. Okay, ENTER that. Now, we're ready to go on the first star here; 7 ENTER; 23 ENTER. ... we don't want to do an optics cal. No, we don't want to do that. ENTER. Okay, first star is 21. ENTER. I am going to use the ... 110 ENTER. PROCEED. Son of a gun. Okay, we don't want to do the 180 option, so ENTER that one; 19630 ... getting pretty close. Okay. PROCEED.
0174354|LMP|... mike ...
0174402|CMP|Okay, we're CMC OPTICS ZERO'S OFF and low. Now let's see if we can see the old star in there.
0174414|LMP|Gordy, this is Jack. You guys did a good job fixing that MAS - MASTER ALARM problem. What did you do?
0174428|CC|Jack, did you call?
0174432|LMP|Yes, I was wondering what you did to fix the MASTER ALARM problem.
0174439|CC|Let me check and see.
0174445|CMP|(Laughter) Yes, I've got to find the subsolar point. A little bit of an error looks like. Let me see, we'll fix it down a little bit. That really jars us back, doesn't it?
0174516|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The participants have left Mission Control for the news conference, a change of shift press conference that should begin in about 5 to 10 minutes, in the MSC News Center Briefing Room -
0174525|CC|Jack, I guess all we've done is wish it away, Actually, we think it's still there, and you may - you may get them here later after the waste stowage vent - O2 flow gets on up.
0174548|LMP|Okay, but those were associated with the accumulator as I recall. Yes, the random ones is the ones I was interested in. They just seemed to stop. Of course, we haven't been moving switches on 2, but we were getting them without doing that also.
0174613|CMP|Okay, there's the old star. Works just like the simulator; you can't see the star when it goes down in the Earth (laughter).
0174621|CC|It's still being worked on, Jack. Though we don't have any real concrete story to give you on it yet.
0174631|LMP|Okay, it seemed to be pretty quiet last night, so that's the only problem.
0174637|CMP|Okay. Gene, you want to give me CMC FREE?
0174640|CMP|Okay.
0174945|CMP|Let's see. 379, okay. That's not too bad. There it is; ENTER. Release 23; ENTER.
0175132|CMP|Okay.
0175307|CMP|Yes, I don't know what - what's -
0175344|CMP|Okay, those would punch a hole in it.
0175347|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 17 hours 54 minutes. The change of shift press conference is ready to begin at this time in the MSC News Center Briefing Room. We'll take down the live air-to-ground, record, and play back immediately following the press conference.
0175522|CMP|I think that's five on that star. Do you concur that that's five on that star, Houston?
0175531|CC|Stand by. Let me check.
0175534|CMP|I think it was. I'll take another one just in case.
0175615|CMP|Okay, Gene. CMC AUTO.
0175618|CDR|Roger.
0175620|CMP|Okay, Betelgeuse. All right. That's all right; don't move.
0175711|CMP|20. Okay. Earth's far horizon; 25 ENTER. Plus 02745 ENTER. Plus 99128; 28 ENTER. Plus 12885 - 12885 - 12885. Okay. Hit. It's okay; want the 180 option, no? Computer ... Betelgeuse. Okay, that's Earth's far horizon.
0175830|CMP|Punch a hole in them. Yes. Good. Okay, says we're there - Okay. Says the old star comes at the substellar point. Okay, it's the far horizon, the double line is down in the - down in the Earth. Shaft 280; okay. Reach up a little bit here.
0175955|CMP|Okay. Didn't do such a hot job of putting them on there. You want to go to CMC FREE. Okay. Give it a flip that way and a flip thataway and a yaw that way, two yaws that way.
0180146|CMP|(Singing) Holy mackrel.
0180157|CMP|Yes. That was a good mark.
0180201|LMP|Gordy, this is LMP.
0180206|LMP|Hello, Houston; 17. Are you reading?
0180209|CC|Go ahead, Jack.
0180212|LMP|Yes, you got any news today - to read up to us?
0180217|CC|Well, yes. As a matter of fact, we have a little bit made up here. I guess along the personal line, we checked with Barbara and Jan and the kids, and they're all back home safe and sound and they mentioned that they're going into their own personal quarantine period, glued to the squawk box. Over.
0180248|CDR|Okay.
0180248|LMP|I was afraid you were going to get too personal there, for a minute. (Laughter)
0180255|CC|I'll run down a few quick summaries of this morning's news. Former President Harry Truman has rallied slightly, despite his weakened heart and labored breathing. His doctors report that their main worry is whether his heart is strong enough to withstand the strain, the physical strain of 88 years. Despite the slight rally, Truman's condition is still considered critical. In Paris, Henry Kissinger met with Hanoi's Le Du Tho for 4 hours yesterday in planned secret talks. Paris newspapers report an imminent cease-fire, but neither Kissinger or Tho indicate that this is true. After the 4-hour talks, Kissinger shook hands; and his aid - got a little typo error here - but neither representative made any comment concerning their meeting. At Camp David, Maryland, President Nixon's press secretary, Ron L. Ziegler, said that Kissinger and Nixon are in close communication by cable concerning the secret peace talks. But Ziegler declined to provide more information about progress in the talks. President Nixon selected Claude S. Brinegar, a California oil executive and a doctor of economics, to be Secretary of Transportation succeeding John A. Volpe. Volpe will become the U.S. ambassador to italy. Here's one concerning last night's launch. Mrs. Spiro Agnew reportedly made a wish on a falling star just before the delayed launch of Apollo 17. Sitting beside her at the VIP viewing site was Barbara Cernan, who said that she was nervous when the lift-off was postponed. She added, "But Al Bean was there with me. He said not to be concerned." Mrs. Cernan was accompanied by her daughter Tracy, and her mother, Mrs. Jackie Ashley. Mrs. Ron Evans, who saw the launch with her children, Jamie and John, said that she was never worried because everybody knew what they were doing.
0180519|CMP|(Laughter)
0180736|CDR|Good summary, Gordo. We thank you, and our best wishes for the return to health of Mr. Truman.
0180746|CC|Roger.
0180750|CDR|Gordo, we were figuring up here that we probably launched on the 6th of December in Houston and on the 7th of December in Florida.
0180800|CC|That's right. You called it right.
0180806|CMP|Okay, CMC AUTO there, Gene, please.
0180812|CMP|Oh, boy.
0180904|CMP|Okay, let's use the VERB 23, ENTER. Oh, what did I do there. ENTER, let's see, is a 110. There, okay. VERB 25 - ENTER. Oh, Gamma Prime Leonis. (Coughing) Okay, minus 8490 - 84900, I mean; plus 40299 plus 40299 ENTER; plus 34176, plus - 76, ENTER; okay, PROCEED. 202 ... 18, okay. There already. ... I guess. We'll try that one more time. ... CMC, AUTO? 196306.
0181026|LMP|Gordy, you still there?
0181027|CMP|Okay; that's right.
0181031|CC|Go ahead, Jack.
0181034|LMP|Yes, I mentioned to Bob yesterday how - when we moved away from the Earth - how fragile a piece of blue it looked to be, and that impression certainly grows the farther you get from it. I wish everybody could have a chance to get that impression. Things might go a little easier for us.
0181057|CC|Roger.
0181106|CMP|Okay, Gene, ... CMC FREE?
0181111|CMP|(Singing) ... must be making the vector worse and worse instead of better. (Laughter) Well, it was on the substellar point that time except it was halfway through the Earth almost. Not really.
0181241|CDR|Hey, Gordy, we haven't really had a clear and detailed description of what you or somebody else saw at the launch, in terms of the lighting around the countryside, the state of the flame, and how long the - exhaust was under the S-IC. Do you have anything to add to that?
0181312|CC|Well, I can give you my feelings, anyway. It was a spectacular sight, and no doubt about it. I'd say the level of illumination would have made it easy to - to read a newspaper or anything like that from my vantage point near the VAB. The - the plume itself actually looked no larger or - or even any brighter, really, except in contrast, than it does on a day launch by comparison. But - well, the effect, I guess, was about what I expected just trying to extrapolate previous launches into a nighttime situation. The weather was very clear. That was one advantage gained by delaying the launch the 2 hours and 40 minutes that you did. By that time, there were very few clouds around at all. And we could see a brilliant flash there when the first stage cut off and the second stage ignited. And I lost you visually probably, oh, 4 to 5 minutes into the second stage, as best I can remember. Part of the problem was the brightness of the plume during the first stage, it kind of burned a spot on my eye; and so then I was - had reduced efficiency at looking for a small point of light from there on out. Stu's here with me and he was watching it, too. I'll see if he has anything to add.
0181514|CDR|Stu who?
0181519|CC|He said after that comment he has no comment.
0181523|CDR|(Laughter) I'm sorry, Stu.
0181528|LMP|I can't believe that; Stu always has something to add.
0181532|CMP|(Singing) Houston, in case you just noticed, I forgot the VERB 67 until just now. Although, in reality, all we're trying to do here is get a DELTA-H measurement anyhow. And, Houston, do you have any feel yet for what the DELTA-H is - line has been?
0181559|CC|Stand by, Ron.
0181614|CC|Ron, this is Houston. We're not going to be able to give you a handle on the Delta H until we have a chance to take all the data and reduce it and work it around a little.
0181628|CMP|Okay, that's mighty fine.
0181632|CMP|Okay, Geno, CMC AUTO? Let's see what's on this star here. Kalinan [sic] - that's Menkalinan, I guess. Okay, Earth far horizon; 23, ENTER 120, ENTER, 25 ENTER ... (Coughing) (Singing) Plus - 7073 ENTER, plus 70644 ENTER. Okay, that is the unit vector of the star.
0182214|CMP|Okay, it's a 180 option we don't want. ... the real option. (Laughter) I guess they're getting - Houston, you must be getting all the good data without the high gain, huh?
0182238|CC|That's affirmative, Ron.
0182240|CMP|Okay. Okay, let's ENTER that.
0182255|CMP|Okay, Gene, you go CMC FREE now? Yes, that's about a half a sextant diameter above the - above the horizon. Substellar point looks pretty good, though.
0182551|CMP|Hey, guys, -
0182858|PAO|This is Apollo control at 18 hours 29 minutes. During the change of shift press briefing, flight director Gene Kranz reviewed the status of the mission with each of his flight controllers everything essentially normal at this point. Flight dynamics officer reported that they have not yet gotten sufficient tracking on the S-IVB trajectory to give an impact point based on tracking. We should have that in a matter of hours. And we'll get a report as soon as a set of coordinates for the S-IVB impact are available. Also, capcom Gordon Fullerton read up a news report to the crew. And it's been relatively quiet for the past 5 or 10 minutes on the air to ground line. We'll replay the accumulated tape and as soon as we've caught up with the tape we'll stand by for live conservations with the crew.
0183054|CMP|- Yes, not yet.
0183111|CMP|Yes, it's on there.
0183643|CMP|30 ENTER - oops! CMC AUTO ... Now, last star. Oh, that was it. I'm going to go back to the calibration attitude.
0183804|CMP|Okay, CMC auto engaged, and away we go.
0183811|CMP|Okay, we got to dump the waste water, too. 10 percent.
0183821|CMP|164, 301, and 318 - that's the optics calibration attitude that we want to start with. Put the landmark line of sight mark on star 22. Also the optics line of sight, with optics zero. Let's see, I'll the optics, I guess first.
0184543|CMP|Okay, Houston, looks like optics calibration here is 89995 - I get that half the time and 997 the rest. So (laughter) we'll use 995, I guess.
0184557|CC|Roger.
0184607|LMP|Okay, Houston, you ready for some purges and dumps?
0184611|CC|Let me make sure here. We're standing by.
0184643|LMP|Okay. I'll get going on the O2 purges on the fuel cell.
0184643|CC|Okay.
0184928|LMP|Well, I had my clock on the wrong scale. is that about 2 minutes, Houston?
0184948|CC|That's good, Jack.
0185009|CC|Did you copy that, Jack? They said that was fine.
0185013|LMP|Yes, sir, Stu; I copied that. How are you?
0185016|CC|Okay; swinging.
0185021|LMP|That's good to hear.
0185024|CC|Sure am enjoying your descriptions.
0185031|LMP|Well, if I could get Ron off his - work with the optics, we'd look at the Earth some more. But that will come. Right now I'm seeing all sorts of little ice crystals of various composition, (laughter) that are moving around, and every one of them bounces off the LM that I can see. No, none of them stick. I noticed that some of them will go into a corner with a fairly high velocity and either be turned around by a double bounce, or just get lost in the corner and have very low velocity when they come out.
0185110|CC|Roger.
0185206|LMP|Most of them look like they have at least a foot or 2 per second.
0185213|CC|Roger.
0185224|CC|Hey, Jack, I was surprised when you said when you got Ron off the optics. Don't tell me that Ron is going to let you look through his optics.
0185233|LMP|Oh, heavens no! We just move the windows. (Laughter)
0185237|CC|(Laughter) Okay.
0185238|CMP|That's for sure.
0185247|PAO|The CAPCOM at the present time is Astronaut Stuart Roosa, backup Command Module Pilot for Apollo 17.
0185308|LMP|Stu, apparently you get - do get some particle/particle collisions, because some of the trajectories are back towards us.
0185322|CC|Okay; we're waiting for the explanation of that.
0185329|LMP|Well, I think it's because the particles and - some of them, you know, are bouncing off the LM and get out into the stream, which normally would have no collisions. How's that? You can say it's not very good. I don't care.
0185355|CC|Got to use tact here.
0185432|PAO|That animated description of the behavour of a cloud of ice crystals drifting along with spacecraft is coming from Jack Schmitt. Apollo 17 at this point is 81,654 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a speed of 5,972 feet per second. And we see from the telemetry data that the fuel cell purge called for in the flight plan at this time is progressing. This involves flowing, in this case, oxygen at a high rate through the fuel cell for a short period of time to remove any build-up of contaminants. And, as a routine maintenance or housekeeping procedure, same thing is also done periodically for the hydrogen.
0185615|CC|You can terminate the purge on fuel cell 3 - O2.
0185621|CMP|Yes. I even forgot to listen for the ding on that one. Thank you.
0185832|CC|17, we'll be having a communications handover to Honeysuckle in about a minute and a half.
0185841|CDR|Okay, Gordo.
0185845|LMP|That's great. Next time I look at the Earth, I'll see what's happening in Australia.
0190124|LMP|Okay, Houston. We're starting our waste water dump.
0190129|CC|Okay.
0190130|CDR|Wish us luck. Wish us luck.
0190138|CMP|Hey, that really goes out!
0190152|CC|Can you give us P00 and ACCEPT? And we'll give you a new state vector.
0190201|CMP|Probably need one after all those ...
0190205|LMP|Okay, you've got P00 and ACCEPT.
0190209|CC|Roger.
0190411|CC|Okay, the vector's in there. It's your computer.
0190418|CDR|Okay, Gordo. Thank you.
0190658|PAO|This is Apollo control at 19 hours 7 minutes. The crew aboard Apollo 17 has completed the next item in the flight plan in the way of housekeeping duties aboard the spacecraft. That involved dumping waste water. Water is accumulated in a 7 to 8 gallon tank on the spacecraft which is produced as a by-product of generating electricity in the fuel cells. These fuel cells generate quite a bit more water than the spacecraft is able to consume for cooling and for crew drinking purposes. The excess goes into a waste water tank and periodically it's dumped down to about lO percent, and the crew has just completed that activity. We're going to take advantage of a relatively quiet time in the flight plan at this time to replay a portion of the air-to-ground conservations with the spacecraft which included among other things a rather detailed description of earth given by Jack Schmitt, some weather patterns. This replay is necessitated by a problem that we had with a portion of the public affairs release circuit between 4:40 and 5:05 p.m. central standard time this afternoon in which a portion of the release circuit did not receive the air-to-ground and for the benefit of those people who missed that portion of air-to-ground we'll replay the tapes at this time.
0190951|LMP|Houston, you going to want to cycle some film here?
0190956|CC|That's affirm. We're planning on it. Let me make sure they're ready, though, before you do it.
0191007|LMP|Well, I didn't want to bring it up, but you're about - 20 minutes late on your cue.
0191018|CC|You must have missed our first call.
0191023|LMP|I probably did.
0191221|CC|Jack, we're ready for the pan and mapping camera film cycling. You haven't started into the procedure yet, is that correct?
0191232|LMP|No, not yet.
0191234|CC|Okay, at your convenience, we're ready to - watch you do it.
0191242|LMP|Okay. And were those last high gain - I guess they're still good, huh? You want the high gain on it?
0191253|CC|Okay; we'd like you to use PITCH at minus 50 and YAW 320 and acquire the high gain.
0191303|LMP|Okay, will do.
0191406|CC|You have 10 percent waste water now. You can terminate the dump.
0191412|LMP|Okay. We're just about there.
0191507|CMP|Okay, the old IMAGE MOTION is OFF.
0191512|CC|Roger.
0191513|CMP|DATA SYSTEMS are going ON. AUX TV is going to SCIENTIFIC.
0191523|CC|Jack, we'd like AUTO and NARROW on the HIGH GAIN.
0191538|LMP|There you go. Okay?
0191541|CC|Thank you.
0191543|CMP|Okay. SM/AC POWER is coming ON. MAPPING CAMERA is going to STANDBY; talkback's gray. PAN MODE is verified in STANDBY. PAN CAMERA MODE? Yes. Okay PAN CAMERA is going to POWER - now. Barber pole
0191619|LMP|Okay, the PAN CAMERA just went to POWER. Okay, Ron's talking to you. Didn't know that.
0191628|CC|Roger.
0191631|CMP|PAN CAMERA SELF TEST has gone to HEATERS.
0191638|LMP|High bit rate. Okay; waiting your cue, Gordy.
0191645|CC|Okay, stand by.
0191650|CC|Okay, Ron, we're ready for the film cycling.
0191745|CMP|Okay, MAPPING Camera is going ON.
0191815|CMP|Okay, PAN CAMERA SELF TEST is going to SELF TEST. Talk back's barberpole. Okay, I forgot to time it, yes.
0191908|CMP|Okay, talkback went gray on the PAN CAMERA.
0191912|CC|Roger.
0191927|CMP|Okay, PAN CAMERA POWER is OFF.
0191954|CMP|Okay, MAPPING CAMERA is going OFF.
0192034|CMP|Okay. SM/AC POWER is coming OFF, huh?
0192042|LMP|Okay, Houston. Film cycling is complete.
0192045|CC|Okay. It looked real good on both cameras.
0192052|LMP|Very good.
0192349|LMP|Okay, Gordy. If your friends there on your left are wondering what strange sounds they're hearing, I just got the harness on.
0192355|CC|Roger.
0192400|CDR|And, then, I guess if you're through with the high gain, I'll go back to OMNI Bravo.
0192407|CC|Okay. We concur with that idea.
0192412|LMP|And if I could ever get Ron out of the kitchen, we'd get into PTC.
0192421|CC|Jack, you'll be glad to know your heart is beating normally. We have a good signal.
0192507|LMP|Just so long as it's beating, Gordy. About 20 hours ago, (laughter) I wasn't so sure.
0192706|CDR|Gordo, (cough) we're maneuvering to the PTC attitude now.
0192711|CC|Okay.
0192920|CMP|Houston, Apollo 17. Any recommended quads for damping the PTC rates?
0192929|CC|Stand by on that, Ron. We'll give it to you in a minute.
0192939|CC|Ron, we're recommending AB for damping and Bravo Delta for roll spinup. I'll say again. Alpha Bravo for damping and Bravo Delta for roll spinup.
0192952|CMP|Okay, Robert, and welcome back aboard.
0192955|CC|Roger, sir.
0193001|CMP|You know, this eating in zero G is not so bad if you keep your bags right side up. If you keep them that way, you get the right perspective. It's sure something funny, if you turn the bag upside down, and it still doesn't fall out, you know.
0193019|CC|Roger.
0193141|CMP|Having a little peach ambrosia for a snack here.
0193300|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 19 hours 33 minutes. That completes our replay of the segments of the air-to-ground that were lost on a portion of the Public Affairs Release Network earlier today. During that replay, we accumulated about 5 or 6 minutes of additional tape with the crew, the activities involved during that period of time or completion of waste water dump, the crew dumping excess water produced by the fuel cells and stored in a storage tank on the spacecraft, and they dump it down to about 10 percent of its quantity, or its capacity. And, also completed one other routine housekeeping activity. That was cycling the film in the panoramic and mapping cameras contained back in the service module scientific instrument module bay. That bay, of course, still has the door over it. The door will be jettisoned before going into orbit around the moon exposing those cameras for use in lunar orbit taking high-resolution and very accurately controlled mapping cameras - mapping photos of the lunar surface. The cycling of the film is made necessary by the fact that the film is under some tension in the magazine in the transport mechanism. This tension tends to put pressure on the emulsion, and if the film is not advanced, oh, four or five cycles, at least once every 24 hours, it tends to create striations in the emulsion, and this is done during the translunar coast when the cameras are not being used periodically, once a day to prevent these striations from developing in the emulsion of the film. We'll replay that accumulated tape for you and then continue to stand by live.
0194207|PAO|This is Apollo control. That completes our replay of accumulated tape we'll now stand by for any live conservations with the crew. One thing additionally that we get out of cycling the cameras the panoramic and mapping cameras as an indication of how they are performing mechanically. As you heard based on the telemetry data that we got here on the ground both cameras appear to be functioning properly tucked away in the scientific instrument module bay of the CSM. You also heard some conservation with Jack Schmitt who is wearing the biomedical harness during sleep periods it's customary for one of the three crewman only to wear the biomedical harness which allows them to get heart rate during the sleep period and the crewman take turns wearing that biomedical harness and during the sleep we are getting good biomedical data - good heart rate data on Schmitt at the present time. Also, Ron Evans commented on getting the spacecraft in the PTC attitude. Essentially, this attitude has the spacecraft oriented at right angles to it's direction of travel. Right angles to the Earth Moon plane so that the Sun is essentially shining on the sides of the vehicle of the CSM and LM. And, then using the reaction control system thrusters on the command module they set up a slow roll rate so that the two vehicles docked together are rotating at the rate of about three revolutions per hour. And, if this is done properly and it's a tricky maneuver usually crews get more and more experienced at it as they go through the mission, and tend to have the most problems early on in getting it set up. But if it is set up with all of the rates damped and everything very stable when the roll is started it will maintain this roll without wobbling out of it throughout the rest period. The purpose of this is to maintain a proper thermal equilibrium on the spacecraft so that the heating on one side from the Sun the cooling of the other as it is exposed to the black of space is uniform and nothing gets too hot or too cold. At the present time Apollo 17 is 84,482 nautical miles from Earth and the velocity continuing to decrease gradually down to about 5,824 feet per second, just a little over one mile per second. We'll continue to stand by live now for any conversations with the crew. This could continue to be a relatively quiet period based on Ron Evans or I guess it was Jack Schmitt's comment that Evans was in the kitchen leads us to believe that they are probably getting ready to eat. This is Apollo control at 19 hours 45 minutes.
0195121|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 19 hours 51 minutes. On the telemetry data that we have here in the Control Center, we're watching as the spacecraft is automatically killing off its rates, in preparation for setting up it's passive thermal control mode. They're getting the vehicles very stable, and they're measuring rate changes in thousandths of a degree per second. And when it is as essentially as stable as it appears possible to get it, they'll then fire the thrusters, to begin rolling at a slow 3 revolutions per hour rate. This is the second passive thermal control mode established.
0195211|CC|The rates are looking good, they're amped adequately. We're ready for spin-up.
0195220|CDR|Okay, Bob.
0195235|PAO|The crew set up the spacecraft in the passive thermal control mode before their previous sleep period and experienced no difficulties, and they appear to be going very smoothly, in this passive thermal control setup. You heard CAPCOM Robert Overmeyer who's come in to relieve CAPCOM Gordon Fullerton, advise them that the rates have been killed off sufficiently to begin rotating the vehicles now.
0195440|CDR|Okay, Gordo. We're in PTC. Or, Bob, I guess you're down there now.
0195451|CC|Roger, Gene.
0195536|LMP|Bob, did you ever find out what part of Antarctica we were seeing at various Earth orientations?
0195546|CC|Jack, I've - I tried that this afternoon, and I couldn't get hold of anybody, and I looked on a map for a while, and I - I'm not sure where Little America was. I can't truthfully say I did it - get it. I'll keep looking at it.
0195559|LMP|Okay. I - at any rate, it looks like there's a very well-developed front coming out of the northwestern portion of Antarctic ice shelf. And ... and it - let's see here. Well, stand by 1.
0195625|CC|Roger.
0195626|LMP|Have to change windows.
0195842|LMP|Okay, Bob. That front looks like it starts and develops as a small - - it actually seems to start with an anticyclone development off the coast of Antarctica. Moves up across New Zealand, looks like the South island primarily, a little bit of the North island is still visible, and into the eastern coast of Australia. And I'll give you a spot where it intersects and crosses the whole of Australia. However, it - it breaks up and is not very well formed, once it gets inland away from the coast. I see no well-developed waves on it at this time, so it's hard to say how strong it is. There might be one developing just to the south of New Zealand or right off the coast of New Zealand.
0195955|CC|Roger. I copy that, Jack.
0195958|LMP|There at least is some sinusoidal motion or appearance to the front ... And you'll have to wait, because I lost it again.
0200016|CC|Roger.
0200022|LMP|I took two 5 - 50-millimeter pictures. Mag November November is on 132.
0200033|CC|Roger. November November on 132. Those are pictures of the - -
0200039|LMP|And that was the -
0200051|CC|Jack, Houston. Was that - were those pictures of those fronts you are talking about?
0200239|PAO|That was Jack Schmitt giving us the description of the weather patterns developing off the northwest coast of Antartica and extending up towards New Zealand and Australia. Apollo 17 at the present time is about 85,500 nautical miles from Earth and situated over the south Pacific. The spacecraft now essentially fixed with the respect to the Earth and Moon, but the Earth rotating beneath it as the earth rotates - -
0200314|LMP|Bob, I got our orbital map out now, and that front is going off across to the coast of Australia north of Sidney and largely a little south of Brisbane and - and swings across the whole of Australia and seems to come - near as I can tell, go by into the Indian Ocean about - well, where the Great Sandy Desert intersects the northwestern coast of Australia.
0200353|CC|Roger, Jack.
0200715|CC|17, I've got a Flight Plan update here.
0200723|LMP|Stand by, please.
0200724|CC|Roger. It's just a short one. One item to change.
0200731|LMP|Well, if you saw my hands right now (laughter), you'd know why I said wait 1.
0200734|CC|Understand. I'm just - just waiting for your call. Just didn't want you to think we're going to give you a whole rafter of it.
0200743|LMP|Oh, we know you wouldn't do that.
0200803|CC|If you're eating, Jack, just go ahead and eat. This is nothing that can - we can just wait, and any time, just go ahead.
0200811|LMP|Yes, I'm not panicking.
0200913|LMP|Okay, Bob. Go with the update, and LM/CM DELTA-P at 20 plus 09.
0200930|CC|Want you to know, Jack, we just cut out by the antenna switching. Say again the LM/CM DELTA-P.
0200936|LMP|Okay, 0.6 at 20 plus 09.
0200943|CC|Roger. Okay. My update is just simply on the botton of page 3-23 at 2300 hours in the Flight Plan or 23 hours in the Flight Plan. "WASTE STOWAGE VENT valve, CLOSED." Just delete that one, and move it over to 24:30, That's because you got started late on that.
0201010|LMP|Okay. You could've just said, move it.
0201012|CC|Okay. Just change it down to 24:30.
0201017|LMP|24:30.
0201200|LMP|Okay. Bob - about revision one on my previous discussion of the weather around Australia. That front does cross - probably Brisbane is probably cloudy. It does cross about that area, and - however, there is a bank of clouds that runs off of it down the coastline. So Sidney is either cloudy or has some pretty nice clouds off - off shore. And the remnants of the front as it dissipates in the hinterland of Australia dies out at about the Great Sandy Desert, and there is not a good indication that it crosses into the Ind - Indian Ocean. But we're getting over near the LM, and that's a little hard to tell.
0201253|CC|Roger.
0201303|LMP|Now, it - more - looks more and more like the cyclone circulation developing right over the top of New Zealand; the South island, I think. And now I'm looking with the binoc, and as much - that anticyclone circulation is centered on the ice shelf. And I think that - well, I Just don't know - I think that's the Ross Ice Shelf, but I'm not sure, off Antarctic. And the clouds from that circulation do extend over the ice shelf and barely into the Antarctic con - continent.
0201345|CC|Roger, Jack.
0201358|LMP|Now to the north of Antarctica. Let's see now. I ought to give you a better orientation than that. But, anyway, there is a large cyclone circulation pattern that has its southern extremity right on the edge of the ice shelf. And that - that is east by 20 or 30 degrees of longitude of the front that I just was discussing. By the way, that front intersects Antarctica.
0201440|CC|Roger, Jack.
0201622|LMP|Between New Zealand and Australia, the front I was discussing previously has some fairly strong transverse cloud patterns. It's hard to say whether they're high cirrus or not. But the clear area to the south of the front suggests that maybe the jet stream is roughly paralleling that front in that area.
0201653|CC|Roger. I'd have to look up and see - -
0201701|LMP|If I had to guess, I'd -
0201701|CC|- - if they do have any jet stream down there right now.
0201705|LMP|I - if I had to guess, if you were flying - west from Sidney this afternoon, you'd have a pretty strong tailwind behind you, Bob.
0201723|CC|Roger.
0201727|LMP|Let's see, did I get that right?
0201734|LMP|Would you believe a headwind?
0201736|CC|Okay. I'll believe that.
0201749|LMP|But the bulk of Australia is very clear, all the south and the north. It's just that one line of - of clouds that crosses the center section.
0201804|CC|Roger.
0201856|LMP|That put all the major cities of the south, Perth and Adelaide, at least, and Melbourne, certainly in the clear. And in the North Darwin, in those areas, are very nicely clear today.
0201915|CC|Roger. I hope we can get this out to them and let them know that you're watching and tell them how good the weather is.
0201928|LMP|Oh, that's all right. I'm just having fun, Bob,
0201931|CC|Understand. I imagine they'd appreciate it though.
0203518|LMP|Bob, I tried to pick out the Hawaiian islands on that last little turn here through window 5. And I can't say that I did. I think I've got them - the area spotted. It looks like they might be under some fairly heavy cloud cover today. I do not see the islands. I'm not sure I could, if it was clear.
0203538|CC|Roger. Hey, Jack, I got some answers to your question from last night on where Little America is with respect to - on Antarctica.
0203551|LMP|Go ahead.
0203553|CC|There's a - inden - indentation that looks like a gulf that's called the Ross Sea, and on the northwest edge of the Ross Sea is Little America, That's the location of it.
0203609|LMP|Okay. And that would be the coast of Antarctica that sort of faces New Zealand and Australia. is that correct?
0203618|CC|Negative. According to the map I've got, it's - the Ross Sea looks like it would be more facing up towards the South America area. It's actually kind of facing up sort of the middle between Australia and South America, Jack.
0203701|LMP|Okay, Bob. You cut out, and I presume you meant that - the Ross Sea was facing north - sort of the Pacific between South America and Australia?
0203712|CC|That's affirmative, Jack. It's a very sharp indentation or sea or gulf onto the Antarctica.
0203729|LMP|Okay. I think I know the area you mean, and I'll check it out again when it comes by.
0203735|CC|Okay. That's Little America on that west-northwest edge of that Ross Sea. That's where Little America is.
0203746|LMP|Yes, all that - those names are familiar. I just had forgotten my geography. I'll see if I can recognize them.
0204511|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 20 hours 45 minutes. We're occasionally picking up a bit of noise on the Air-to-Ground circuit. This is due to the fact that the spacecraft is in the passive thermal control mode, as it rotates. We're gradually losing contact through one of the OMNI antennas and re-establishing adequate signal strength on another one. And as it moves from antenna to antenna on our coverage, we get the noise. This is a characteristic that becomes more pronounced as the spacecraft gets farther and farther from Earth. Here in Mission Control, the Flight Activities Officer has been actively involved in figuring out how in the flight plan we're going to make up for the 2 hours 40 minutes difference from the flight plan liftoff time and the actual liftoff time. One of two things happen when you lift off late for a mission. Either the events that are called out in the flight plan occur at a different Earth time, Central Standard, Eastern Standard, or Greenwich Mean whichever reference you happen to be using, or the elapsed times change. And the flight planning is all done in terms of elapsed time for the most part. Events that are called out in the flight plan are listed by the amount of time that has elapsed from liftoff. At the present time, in the Apollo 17 flight plan, the amount of time that has elapsed since liftoff is unchanged from the pre-mission flight plan time. However, as, by the time we have approached or reached the Moon, because of the speeded up translunar coast time, occasioned by slightly faster or slightly greater amount of energy that was put in during the translunar injection burn, we'll have to make up 2 hours 40 minutes. In other words, we'll be arriving at the Moon 2 hours 40 minutes earlier than flight plan allowed for. This means that all of the events that are called in the flight plan to occur between now and lunar arrival have to be accomplished in 2 hours 40 minutes less time than the flight plan allows for. This creates no serious problems, because it's a relatively quiet period of the mission. It's very easy, by adjusting sleep period slightly and moving the activities up to accomplish it. However, the flight planning officer, flight activities officer, prefers to accomplish this shift in two increments rather than a single one. And this could be likened to a change of daylight savings time, where you don't want to make the jump too big at once, and you might start interfering in a way that would be noticeable, say, with sleep periods. But by accomplishing it in two segments, the change is relatively insignificant. And what this amounts to is that at two different times in the flight plan, we'll read changes to the crew, and they will go down the flight plan, moving a series of events approximately 1 hour earlier. The second time that this is done, they'll actually be moving events 1 hour 40 minutes earlier and at the same time, we'll update the clocks in Mission Control, the Ground Elapsed Time clocks, which serve as the key to where you are in the flight plan to agree with the changes we have made in the flight plan. And from that point on, the GET clock will be back in synchronization with the flight plan. This clock update is presently scheduled to occur at 66 hours Ground Elapsed Time, rather at 67 hours 40 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, and we'll move the clocks to 66 hours. Apollo 17 at present time is 88,091 nautical miles from EARTH.
0205013|LMP|Okay, Bob, checking on the Ross Sea, and if I've got her pegged right, it's got a fair amount of open water in it this time of year.
0205027|CC|Roger.
0205027|LMP|Although it's completely surrounded, I think, completely surrounded, I think by portions of the icepack. And off to the west of there, it looks like there's an area that might be - clear of snow, and - does my memory serve me correctly, that that's where McMurdo Sound is, and some of the dry valleys?
0205057|CC|I believe so. That's the Little America area right now, all that general vicinity, Jack.
0205111|LMP|Okay. It looks like the prime recovery area and the Samoa island region is clear, and my guess would be from the fairly subdued zero phase point, that they might have fairly nice seas out there. The boys on the Ticonderoga are probably enjoying themselves immensely, I hope.
0205136|CC|Roger.
0205142|LMP|Indonesia looks like it's having a nice day, with the possible exception of the region over just north of Australia. New Guinea and that area they - some clouds in there. I can't tell whether they are high or low clouds though. They look like they're probably fairly high clouds. But north of New Guinea, there's a strong concentration of clouds. Although small, it looks fairly dense like there might be a little tropical depression in that area.
0205220|CC|Roger.
0205236|LMP|The folks in Carnarvon ought to be enjoying a very nice day.
0205330|LMP|I've been trying to spot tropical storm Teresa, which is - a couple of days ago was in the Philippines. But I can't - I don't think I quite have that visible to me right now.
0205347|CC|Roger, Jack. Say, you might want to put something in the back of your mind here a minute. We made a run of the DSE recording just now of the TLI to get an idea of the quality of the DSE recording, and Gene came through loud and clear. Ron was very weak and almost unreadable, and we never caught you, Jack, in there. We don't - maybe you weren't saying anything during TLI, but we never did catch anything you said.
0205417|LMP|Okay. I don't recall talking too much during TLI.
0205421|CC|Roger. Understand. Now Gene - Gene came through real loud and clear. So whatever technique he was using went on that tape real well.
0205526|CC|Hey, Jack; Houston.
0205531|LMP|Hello.
0205533|CC|Hey, Jack. Just a couple more comments on that DSE. I think, as you well know, it's very critical on the position of your - of your boom there, and those areas that you're critical in, why, make sure that you've - you've really got those beauties up or you're talking right in - right into it. And this - this really makes a difference, because the DSE - The volume is - is fairly low, and if you're muddled just the least bit, why, it - it's going to be difficult to pick it up. So talk slow, and - and get right up next to the mike, because I know you - you're doing it. Just some voices come across a little better than others.
0205618|LMP|Roger, Stu. Thanks for the comments. As a matter of fact, you probably called it just right. I think during - once I got the helmet off, I loosened up my chinstrap, and my mike booms had moved away from my mouth some. And I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the reminder.
0205638|CC|Yes. It's - that's probably the most critical item is that - is the position of those, and this has been true of - in the past, and it just really makes a difference in - in that - being able to pick up the data off the voice.
0205654|LMP|Roger. I've - Ron and I did some experimentation with that in the chamber, and couldn't agree more. But I sometimes don't remember it. Thank you.
0205705|CDR|Well, Stu, I just - -
0205707|LMP|I - I
0205707|CDR|- - thought I'd -
0205710|CDR|Okay. Go ahead, Stu.
0205712|CC|No, I was saying I was - I'm sure you - you're aware of that, but I think the fact that the volume is - is down just accentuates the - the problem.
0205728|LMP|Okay. Gene had something he wanted to ask you.
0205731|CDR|Stu, I - I just thought you'd like to be aware of it, as much time as we've all spent down at the Cape, probably May is one of the nicest months down there. However, having had the opportunity to - to be up here during May, I find out that it's not nearly as nice up here.
0205753|CC|Okay.
0205759|CDR|And I'd like to - to thank all my friends for that
0205803|CC|Okay.
0210321|PAO|This is Apollo control at 21 hours 3 minutes. Things continuing to progress smoothly and very quietly here in mission control and aboard the spacecraft. And we'd like to have a bit more discussion of the Ground Elapsed Time update after first making the disclaimer that GET clock updates are not done for the purpose of confusing people; although, I'm sure it seems that way at times. And, by way of clarifying the previous description of this GET update we should point out that the amount of time that the clocks are changed both here and mission control and aboard the spacecraft will be 2 hours and 40 minutes and this clock change is scheduled to occur as mentioned previously at about 65 hours Ground Elapsed Time. In other words when the clocks here in the control center and the clocks in the spacecraft keeping track of the time that has elapsed since liftoff reach 65 hours they will be arbitrarily jumped ahead 2 hours and 40 minutes so that at that point the clocks agree with the flight plan. However, in order to account for these 2 hours and 40 minutes which are suddenly going to disappear from the amount of time available to the crew to accomplish their activities to make it easier on the crew it will be done in two increments. The first increment of 1 hour and the second increment of 1 hour 40 minutes. And, at about the time the second increment of change is made in the flight plan we'll also simultaneously update the clocks. Apollo 17 at this time 88,909 nautical miles from Earth and the velocity continuing to decrease gradually down now to 5,603 feet per second. Very little activity is scheduled in the flight plan between now and the time the crew begins it's rest period. This day aboard the spacecraft has been planned as a relatively short one recognizing that the crew would not get a great deal of sleep on that very long - as a result of the very long launch day. And a relatively short sleep period following. This day was intentionally kept short. They're now - should be completing their eat period although they really have nothing showing in the flight plan until about 22 hours or about another hour from now where they have alloted time for exercise. They will be changing the lithium hydroxide canisters that remove carbon dioxide from the spacecraft cabin atmosphere. They will be realigning the spacecraft platform the stable platform that's used as an attitude reference by the guidance navigation and control system. Then they have one more eat period and go through the pre-sleep checklist beginning an 8 hour rest period at about 25 hours Ground Elapsed Time or a little less than 4 hours from now.
0211018|LMP|Bob, you with me?
0211024|CC|Roger. We wouldn't go away, Jack. We're listening. Did you call?
0211029|LMP|Well, I just - Yes, I almost lost a pass here, and just a couple more words about Australia. As a - as a general landmass, it's red. Very strong red hues, except for the north and eastern coasts, where that red gradually merges into a greenish-gray. It's as - as red as portions of - of northern Africa appeared to be yesterday.
0211112|CC|Roger.
0211113|LMP|Very striking color. It would be more of an orange-red, really, with brown subduing it. It's not - obviously not crimson or anything like that.
0211129|CC|You think it's a function of Sun angle Jack? Or is it just - just a red like we see out in New Mexico area sometimes - some of the areas?
0211137|LMP|Yes. No, it's not Sun angle, because that'll hold a good red color right - right in towards sunset or sunrise. It's - it's due primarily, I'm sure, like most desert areas, to the oxidation of the iron-bearing minerals in the sands and rocks in those regions.
0211158|CC|Roger.
0211159|LMP|Getting limonite and hematite. Little geology thrown in there, Bob. Sorry.
0211208|CC|That's all right. Got to keep you warmed up for the next couple of days.
0211230|LMP|Well, I think the Flight Plan will probably keep me warmed up, too.
0211235|CC|Roger. We thought that time around T&D was just outstanding.
0211244|CDR|Hey, Bob. We - I think we've pretty well got impressions from you down there on that - on that night launch. I might give you a few of mine.
0211254|CC|Go ahead, Gene.
0211334|CC|17, Houston. Are you there? You're right on the edge, if you read me. We're getting a lot of static. If you'll just hang on a minute, we'll be back into some calm air.
0211359|CC|Gene, Houston. Go ahead.
0211447|CC|17, Houston.
0211449|CDR|Go ahead.
0211450|CC|We're just standing by for your comments you wanted to make. I think we lost comm there a minute. We're back with you.
0211458|CDR|Okay, Bob. The entire boost itself was not unlike what you've heard and what Stu down there understands from the physical cues, and what have you. But the significant part of going at night is that as soon as we did have ignition down there in the bottom of the S-IC stack - even though I only have a little slit out of - out of the rendezvous window here, and Ron doesn't have much of a hole in the boost protective cover out of the hatch window, we could definitely confirm ignition because we could see the reflected light on out through in front of us. It was by no means blinding, of course; we had the cockpit pretty well lit up. We - as soon as we lifted off, that light immediately went behind us. We came into just S-IC staging, and I had an opportunity to say, "I told you so," to Jack and Ron. It was just like the great train wrecks of the past. I definitely could see the S-II ignite; and, then, of course, the - I could see the significance of the reflection through the window, besides all the other cues we had for ignition, very much like the S-IC lit up the windows on the stack. Tower jett was pretty spectacular. I could see - the entire boost protective cover and some flame from somewhere - I'm not sure - maybe it was through the hole in the windows - but I could definitely see it. Of course, it disappeared in short order. When the S-II shut down, the delay time between shutdown there and the S-IVB igniting, the entire - the entire flame overtook us, and we literally through - flew through the S-II flame when the S-IVB ignited, if you can imagine that. It's very similar to the Titan staging, where you actually fly through the fireball on the S-II. And that's something you never see - none of those things you ever see quite that way in daylight. On the S-IV, I could see - Of course, once we got going, I couldn't see any light from that plume again, but we could see the APS firing all the way through the burn. And once we got in orbit, as other guys have seen, you could see the APS firing at night without any difficulty. One of the most significant things about TLI is the fact that we, of course, started at night and flew right on up and through a sunrise, which in itself was a pretty spectacular thing. But, when you do it during a TLI burn, it even adds a little bit of momentum to your effort.
0211817|CC|Roger, Gene. Any comment you might make on the possibility of picking up your yaw, if you'd lost your platform at that time - remember the discussion we had about the yaw in the late - like a Mode IV or something like that?
0211832|CDR|Yes, Bob. I not only will comment - I was aware of it, and I was looking for it. And during parts of the S-II and parts of the S-IVB burn, I even turned the lights down in the cockpit - in hopes that I could see stars out there; but I could not make out a one. Ron, I think, may have saw Saturn out the overhead hatch; but looking through the rendezvous window, during a boost phase and during a time-critical phase like a Mode II or Mode IV, I am very much afraid that we would not have been able to pick up that reference.
0211908|CC|Roger.
0211911|CDR|As I remember it, as low as I had the interior lights there for a period of time - and I didn't want to keep them that low, of course - to see if I could get adapted very fast because we were in a dynamic phase of the burn. But my window just gave me a very deep purplish hue, a hue of which I could not, literally, see through to look to see any stars at all. Now, that may have been due to the very low intensity of our interior flood lights.
0211945|CC|Roger, Gene.
0212001|LMP|Bob, this is Jack. A little lay impression there. I think I - saw just about everything Gene was talking about - as far as his description - and felt like it was - although everything was an amazing experience, each one in itself, after each one was over, you could think back and say, "Yes, that's what other guys said it was like." The old Saturn V has got to be a pretty consistently performing vehicle. But - with the added night-time contrast, I think it made it probably the best ride any three guys have ever had.
0212045|CC|Roger.
0212048|CDR|Bob, I might add, that the S-I was, as usual, pretty shakey on lift-off. I saw all the maneuvers as I called them out - the yaw and small reverse roll. Going through Max q, I got up to 25 percent; but my yaw attitude error was zero and my pitch attitude error probably wasn't even at - oh, certainly less than 2 degrees. After Max q, she smoothed out by comparison quite a bit ; and the S-II was a very quiet ride, a very smooth ride. However, you are always aware, due to just a little rumbling out in the S-IVB, that she was still burning for you. The S-IVB, I think, was just a continually - rumble but smooth or consistent ride, all the way through TLI.
0212154|CC|Roger.
0212156|LMP|Gene I think one of the big things that impressed me was the - how instantaneous the decelerations were of each one of the boosters when they cut off. That included the S-IV TLI cut-off. No physical appreciation of tailoff at all.
0212238|LMP|And, Bob, from my rendez - from the right-hand rendezvous window when the tower jett occurred, there seemed to be a lot of burning particles streaming away from it. I could not see - did not notice or remember seeing the actual cover or tower itself; but I - we were inside the cone of the burn and with a lot of streaming. It looked very much like a sky rocket - portion of one at any rate. Reminded me of the Fourth of July out in Silver City a few years ago.
0212316|CC|Roger. Say, any time you got your Flight Plan handy, I've got a discussion here I'd like to run through with you on the - how we're going to recover those 2 hours and 40 minutes from the launch delay - and you'll need to copy it into the Flight Plan. And then just wanted - want you to be advised, we're not happy with the PTC. We get a half angle of about 17 degrees; and so sometime after the P52 coming up at 23:00, we'll want to do another PTC, or initiate PTC again.
0212354|CDR|Well, that was the commander who initiated PTC, and I've already heard about that.
0212400|CMP|(Laughter) You bet he has. Okay. We've got the Flight Plan here, Bob. Which part of it are you talking about ...?
0212406|CC|Well, let's just talk some words here for a minute, and then I'll go through some specifics that you can just write down on a page because you don't want to do it until a little later. Okay, what we're going to set up here - You will arrive at lunar orbit at the same GMT time. The landing Sun angle - Sun elevation angle - and the camera settings and everything will be unchanged when you get to lunar orbit. To compensate for the 2 hour 40 minute late launch, we're going to hack 2 hours and 40 minutes out of the timeline. And we're going to - They'll be out of the TLC timeline - and we're going to do it in two groups. And this is where you might want to start copying now, Ron. Delete 1 hour from 46 to 47. From 46 to 47, we're just going to delete the activities that are presently scheduled at 46:30 to 47:00, you'll perform at 45 - move those to 45. Let me read that again. Delete 1 hour from 46:00 to 47:00. The activities that are listed at 46:30 to 47:00, perform at 45:00.
0212531|CMP|Okay, Bob, looks like we delete 1 hour from 46 to 47 hours. And then the activities that are at 46:30, we'll do those at 45:00.
0212540|CC|Roger, Ron. And then starting at 47, just take - just scratch 1 hour off of each time, just subtract 1 hour from each of those times up through 66 hours. Just subtract 1 hour from 47 up through 66.
0212610|CMP|Okay, we can do that. Subtract 1 hour from 47 through 66 hours.
0212614|CC|Okay. And then just for your information - you won't have to do it - but we're going to play the old simulator step-ahead game at 66 hours of the old time, which will be 65 hours of the new time. So however you want to call it, we'll call you; and we're going to sync you up at 67:40 at that point. We'll play the old step-ahead game there.
0212633|CDR|Okay, Bob. That means that you're not going to actually do any clock updates or syncs until - until somewhere in the 60's there and not in the 40's.
0212646|CC|Roger. It'll be 65 hours of the new time or 66 hours under the old time; depends on how you want to look at it. But that's when we'll sync you up.
0212655|CDR|Okay.
0212657|CC|You'll be in sync all the way out to that time; just - we're just going to delete and jump you to 67:40.
0212706|CDR|Okay.
0212710|CC|And just another note of interest - You don't have to write this down - what - let's see; I'll read it to you. The awake periods will be - on day 3, you'll be 15 hours, 8 hours sleep starting at 11:33 CST; then at day 4, you'll be 14 and 20 hours, with 8 hours sleep. So - it actually just shortens a couple days there.
0212737|CMP|Okay. Mighty fine.
0212745|CC|The beauty of that - that Tommy came up with on that, Ron - is that all you have to do is go subtract those 1 hours and no more reading or anything else; just subtract them and we're in business.
0212757|CMP|Yes, it looks real fine.
0212802|CC|We're going to give Tommy a gold star for that one.
0212807|CMP|(Laughter) You bet.
0212824|LMP|(Cough) Bob, this is Jack. I'm going to try and get a little exercise. I'd be interested to know how high I can get my heart rate just fooling around up here.
0212833|CC|Okay, if we can - We'll keep you posted, Jack.
0212859|CDR|Bob, just to keep you and the people there thinking a little bit, today is a relatively short day; but it is a good day because it gives us a chance to again get acclimated, finish our stowage and just generally go through all the things that have to be gone through for the rest of the mission. We've got 3 eating days today, and judging from what we're thinking and talking about now - that the last two are going to be sort of stretched into one eating period because three meals on this particular day just is not really going to be stomachable.
0212947|CC|Roger. We understand that.
0212957|CDR|I think you'll find out that our eating and drinking, for the most part, is starting off relatively slow; but - I think we'll pick it up here by tomorrow.
0213012|CC|Roger.
0213304|CDR|Bob, one other thing while I'm thinking about it. The PU shifts were all noticeable, but probably the one that really caught me a little bit by surprise was the PU shift on the S-IVB during - during TLI.
0213320|CC|Roger.
0213323|CDR|It just felt like you lit in the other burner.
0213327|CC|Roger. Understand.
0213347|CC|Just for Jack's information, you're running in the 80s on your heartbeat. We saw a 91 or 2 there for a few minutes. Are you working - still working out?
0213359|LMP|(Laughter) Yes. That's sort of discouraging.
0213404|CC|I'm sorry, babe (laughter).
0213411|CDR|Hey, Bob, what was Jack running before he started that?
0213420|CC|He was running in the 60s; the count's somewhere in the mid 60s.
0213426|CDR|Okay.
0213515|CC|Okay, Jack. You're running about 105 and 103 right now.
0213602|CC|Kind of interesting, Jack. You slowed down, and then you're back up to 105 right now. Now you're slowing down again.
0213700|PAO|Flight surgeon John Zeigelschmitt is watching the heart rate of Jack Schmitt, as Jack exercises aboard the spacecraft using a modified exerciser, that consists primarily of a cylinder and a cord that comes out of it allows him to adjust the amount of tension or resistance to pull that the device has, and there are a variety of ways in which it can be used, allowing him to pull against the adjustable tension - this bungee like device - and he's gotten his heart rate up somewhat in excess of 100 beats per minute .
0213955|CDR|Hello, Houston; 17.
0213955|CC|Go ahead, 17.
0213955|CC|Go ahead, 17; this is Houston.
0213955|CDR|Hello, Houston; this is 17.
0213955|CC|Roger. Go ahead.
0213955|CC|17, Houston. Go ahead.
0213955|CDR|Hello, Houston; this is 17-
0213955|CC|Roger, 17. Go ahead. Roger, 17. Go ahead.
0214125|CC|Hello, 17; Houston. You read?
0214128|CT|Honeysuckle comm tech, Houston comm tech, net 1. Goddard voice, Houston comm tech, net 1.
0214138|CT|Goddard voice.
0214139|CT|Roger, Goddard. I'm reading you loud and clear, Honeysuckle. I'm not getting to him.
0214144|CDR|Hello, Houston; this is America. Over.
0214147|CC|America, Houston. Stand by. If you read us, don't change anything in the cockpit yet.
0214153|CT|17, Honeysuckle.
0214156|CT|Roger, Honeysuckle. I read you - -
0214157|CDR|Hello, Honeysuckle. 17's reading you loud and clear.
0214200|CT|Roger. We have a comm outage and I'll be right with you.
0214205|CDR|Okay. Very fine. How are things down there today?
0214208|CT|Fine, your weather report was beautiful. ...
0214214|CDR|Oh, your country looks beautiful from here.
0214230|CC|Okay, 17; Houston. How do you read now?
0214236|CDR|We got you, Bob.
0214237|CC|Okay. That was our network problem, not your problem onboard.
0214243|CDR|Okay thank you, I just figured out what happened on my PTC. Here - with his exercises, Jack is shaking all of America in all three axes, here.
0214254|CC|Roger. He finally got to 115 on the heart rate.
0214301|CDR|Yes, my rate needles are bouncing back and forth a half a degree (laughter).
0214304|CC|Roger. Got to find something to pin it on.
0214455|CC|Jack. Surgeon over here says you got a 120 on the heartbeat for a moment there - 122 right now. Okay, 130, Jack. 130. 140, Jack, 140.
0214616|PAO|The numbers reported to Jack Schmitt by CAPCOM are his heart rate. And you heard him report a heart rate up to about 140 beats per minute as Jack is apparently continuing to exercise vigorously with the onboard exerciser. This is aimed among other things at keeping the cardio vascular system which tends to get lazy in zero gravity in condition.
0214725|CC|17, we've got a serious one here. You might be interested. All that exercise banging around in there has destratified tank 3 O2, so it stirred it all up good.
0214738|CDR|Yes, glad we brought him along then. We found some use for him.
0214744|LMP|Once an EECOM, always an EECOM. I have to cre - create my own G in order to run in place.
0214755|CC|Roger.
0214801|LMP|How high up did the heart rate get, Bob?
0214805|CC|We got you at 140, Jack. Were you running in place? is that - -
0214809|LMP|140 was - Yes, I was - I'm underneath the right-hand couch holding on to the main Y-Y strut with my hands and running against the LEB.
0214823|CC|Roger. It worked real well. 140 and you were running in the mid-60's, so you picked up about - almost 70 beats there, no problem. The surgeon is very happy.
0214834|LMP|Roger. (Laughter) Well, I'm happy too. You know, it took a while to find a technique I was - initially, I got up to 90 with just isometrics - pushing against the couch, and the running is obviously what it takes .
0214855|CC|Roger.
0214855|LMP|But I don't - Bob, I don't I really don't feel - I guess I lost you.
0215138|LMP|Hello, Houston; 17. You still there?
0215141|CC|Roger. We're with you. We had a little comm problem there as - you know, coning on this - as we were changing on the antenna - but we're with you.
0215152|LMP|Okay. What's the heartrate right now?
0215157|CC|Right at - Stand by. We had a data dropout, Jack, that's why I'm holding up. And it just came on and we'll tell you in a second here. About 60, Jack. Right about 60 even.
0215223|LMP|Okay. That's where I was when I started, so that's - you certainly recover fast. I don't know whether that's faster than in one G or not.
0215235|CC|Well, we're happy with it - the Surgeon is happy with it, so it's good.
0215240|LMP|Well, I just - How does that compare - do they have any data on how that compares with the recovery - say, the 5 minute recovery time on the ergometer?
0215251|CC|We can look it up, Jack, if you're interested. We - we'll have to check your records, they don't have it right in front of us.
0215257|LMP|Well, no big deal, just curious.
0215259|CC|Roger.
0215550|CC|Jack, just for your information - the Surgeons pulled out the recovery rate data and it's the same with our data, which is a little rough here. It's the same for zero G as your one G ergometer data.
0215612|LMP|Okay. That's very interesting.
0215615|CC|Roger.
0215946|LMP|Bob, since we've got a few moments to talk - which I know we won't have later in the mission. Something I don't ever remember happening, but it's happening now in the windows. That's the 1, 3, and 5, but not 2 and 4, is that in the center of the window about 6 or 8 inches in diameter, as you come through the night side of the rotation, you pick up a very light - oh, you might call it even a frost. Very light frost on the window - more like a - a moisture frost, film of moisture, or film of frost - not very thick like crystals at all. As you come through the sunlight, it tends to sublime away, but never - you never fully lose it until you go back into darkness again. The very artistic definite ice crystals that we had on my number 1 window over here yesterday - I think we reported to you this morning that they were gone or they sublimed away. But the impression they left on the window is still there; it's very sharp and very evident.
0220116|CC|Roger. We copy that.
0220238|LMP|Bob, I don't know whether you were copying Honeysuckle's call to us, while you lost comm there for a while.
0220245|CC|Roger. We copy.
0220246|LMP|But they said that they had - Okay.
0220255|CC|They kind of concurred with your - -
0220256|LMP|Okay - -
0220257|CC|- - weather report there, Jack.
0220300|LMP|Oh, lucky guess. I might say that the sub - the zero phase point that we're looking at is right at the northeast coast of Australia, and it's much brighter. Very - it's a very bright point now - oh, it's hard to say how far across. But, quite unlike what I mentioned being in the vicinity of the Samoan islands earlier. And it's right at the shore, and it could be just that the shore area has somewhat choppier seas. So maybe - maybe the brightness of that point is a function of sea state, although I don't know exactly what type of seas it would take to brighten it up. I suspect choppy seas are better than long swells.
0220355|CC|Roger, Jack.
0220415|LMP|That front is - seems to have slowed down its progress. It's about in the same position, possibly slightly farther north than when I started talking about it this morning. The wave that has - seems to be developing off the - now off the southwest coast of New Zealand is much more pronounced than it was. Definitely seems to now have a slight cyclonic pattern - clockwise pattern. And I wouldn't be surprised if the next couple of days that moves along the front over towards Sydney. And maybe a little farther north than that might - Brisbane is probably more likely.
0220506|CC|Roger, Jack.
0220511|LMP|Except I got the movement wrong again. Although it does seem to have progressed west from - from New Zealand.
0220526|CC|Roger.
0220531|LMP|I take back what I said about forecasting Sydney's weather. I think that will - I would suspect that would move to the northeast like - now that I look - it seems like an earlier front, which is partly dissipated, had the same kind of motion, and now lies considerably north and east of the one I've been talking about.
0220558|CC|Roger.
0220644|LMP|Thinking back on some weather briefings we had last week, Bob - Are you there?
0220649|CC|That's affirmative.
0220654|LMP|I'll talk to you later. I think you're - We're losing you for a little bit here.
0220659|CC|Okay, Jack. We're reading you loud and clear right now. Oh, you're going out a little bit now.
0221033|LMP|You back with us, Bob?
0221036|CC|That's affirmative.
0221041|LMP|Okay, I was going to try to recover there from that last few statements. As I recall, the weather briefings that we had at the Cape last week, that - talking with Ken Nabor and Jim Nicholson down there, that the patterns we were seeing from the satellite pictures in their forecast - or analysis anyway, charts in the New Zealand part of the Pacific, those waves formed along the front would move north and then curve east. And that appears to be the pattern that was visible in one of the older fronts. And I suspect if that pattern would hold with the wave that's developed off the coast - right on the coast of New Zealand now, that it might move on up the western coast of New Zealand. We'll probably have a chance to watch that the next few days and see what happens to it.
0221149|CC|Roger, Jack.
0221240|CDR|Houston, how are you reading now?
0221242|CC|Reading you loud and clear.
0221246|CDR|Okay, Bob. As I look at the clock, we're - just 24 hours ago we were about within our hold somewhere. For this period yesterday we were in our hold, and I think it goes without saying; but we'd sure like to pass on our debt of gratitude and thanks for the response that the people down at the Cape came up with. And particularly at Marshall. I think we all knew no one would be going anywhere unless everyone was satisfied that we were going all the way. And that's certainly the way we felt, but we do want to thank everybody who had a part in making that come true.
0221328|CC|Roger, Gene. I think it was a superb show between the Cape and Marshall and Houston and probably even Goddard, with the Network and just about everybody concerned, really, had to do some work there to bring it off. And it went off real smoothly.
0221346|CDR|Yes. After flying with Stafford a couple of times and having that happen a few times back, I thought maybe he was aboard.
0221354|CC|(Laughter) Okay. I think that was a first for getting a Saturn V to 30 seconds before ignition and - or rather actually 30 seconds before liftoff and holding there.
0221412|CDR|It got mighty quiet onboard about 30 seconds.
0221416|CC|I sure imagine.
0221419|LMP|We all felt like old hands the second time around, though.
0221423|CC|Roger.
0221428|CDR|Bob, I've been at that 30-second count one other time and it's no different the second time around.
0221436|CC|Roger.
0221440|CDR|But we do appreciate the work, and I think it's typical of - of what made this manned space program such a super program. The response of people like that.
0221452|CC|We concur with that, Gene, wholeheartedly.
0221513|CDR|And with that in mind, tell everyone to stick around because there's a lot yet to be done.
0221518|CC|You better believe it.
0222020|LMP|The old accumulator cycle again, I guess, gang.
0222025|CC|Roger. We're seeing it. It looks like you got a MASTER ALARM. is that affirm?
0222035|LMP|Yes, sir. That's how we tell these days. Although it doesn't happen all the time, and I guess as long as - Whenever we have that WASTE VENT, CLOSED, we probably wouldn't be bothered by it at night.
0222049|CC|Roger. That's - that's our feelings here, Jack.
0222116|CC|Say, Gene and Ron, I talked to your fraus on the phone here a little while ago, and they gave me a very interesting observation you might appreciate. They were standing close to some water when launch and they noticed that when the booster lit up, something scared all the fish because the water literally began to boil with fish jumping from the light, I guess, or from the shock wave or something. It was - made a very distinct impression because that's the first thing both of them told me about.
0222154|CMP|Yes, that's pretty neat.
0222158|CC|A neat way to go scare up the fish, I guess.
0222202|CMP|(Laughter) Right.
0222214|CDR|How are they doing today, Bob?
0222217|CC|Really fine, really fine. They're just - like I said, they're just really tickled pink, and Barbara said that she wants you to know she's going into quarantine until after the weekend here, until after landing.
0222231|CDR|If she goes into quarantine, it'll be a space first.
0222234|CC|Roger.
0222244|CC|You got to be careful about all this.
0222245|CDR|Well, you know what to tell them -
0222249|CDR|Go ahead, Bob.
0222249|CC|You got to be careful now - The hotboxes are open - the hotlines are open at the houses there, so everything you say is being listened to.
0222303|CDR|Yes; okay. In that case, just want to say hello and we're having a super good time looking forward to what's coming, and we thank you for the news, Robert.
0222319|CC|Roger.
0222324|CDR|And my impression of the world, philosophically, I suppose you'll be getting from time to time, but it sure hasn't changed.
0222332|CC|Roger, Gene.
0222333|CDR|It's sure beautiful. It's sure beautiful and, looking back at it, there's several billion people who have got a lot to work for because it's one of the most beautiful sights we've ever seen here.
0222351|CC|Roger, Gene. You guys are sounding great and doing real great. We're pressing right on here.
0222359|CDR|I just want to emphasize, Bob, that these first 2 days - of course, yesterday was a pretty good day, but today we're catching up and - and, as I say, on the food consumption, don't be expecting too much.
0222414|CC|Roger.
0222427|CDR|Acclimation and familiarity, and stowage, and preparation, and enjoyment and relaxation - are ready to call it a day today, which is probably the most ideal day in the Flight Plan to put it, because it's probably the only one we'll have.
0222443|CC|Roger.
0222447|CDR|Not that they aren't all going to be enjoyable.
0222452|LMP|Hey, Bob, your hourly weather report is due and - I'll wait awhile (laughter). I keep losing your comm.
0222504|CC|Okay.
0222556|LMP|Bob, you there?
0222558|CC|Roger, Jack. We're standing by.
0222602|LMP|Okay, I had a quick - quick look and just to bring you up to date, we're starting to be able to see the coast of Asia. The Philippines are wide open today. And the - that tropical storm Theresa that I mentioned I thought I could see - indeed, I'm sure that's what that little concentrated mass of clouds was north of New Guinea. And, I suspect, although I didn't get a good fix on it, that the folks in Guam may be in for some heavy weather.
0222637|CC|Roger.
0222719|LMP|Oh, and, Bob, I got another pair of pictures. And that would be up to 134.
0222727|CC|Roger. That's on November November, is that affirm?
0222731|LMP|That's affirm.
0222732|CC|Real - Good show.
0222741|LMP|And that was taken - the last pass, about 10 minutes ago, if you want to keep track of GET.
0222748|CC|Roger. Thanks, Jack; I'm doing that.
0222822|CC|Just for some information for Ron, in particular. We've evaluated the data from the mapping camera and the pan camera cycling there and it looks real good. Everything looks right normal.
0222834|CMP|Hey, that's outstanding. Good deal.
0223447|LMP|Bob, how do you read 17?
0223451|KRANZ|17, read you 5 by.
0223459|LMP|That's the strangest sounding Bob I ever heard.
0223504|KRANZ|He's taking a short break.
0223506|LMP|Okay. Good. Nice to talk with you. Hey, I don't know whether you were around, Gene, the other day when I was talking about the circulation patterns around Antarctica. We were looking then at the Indian Ocean - actually, South Atlantic in the Indian Ocean region. And you see the same pattern at about the same latitude, say 60 degrees south, where all the linear cloud patterns which presumably are - reflect the various cold fronts have - are arcuate with their convex sides, or more actually, almost pointed sides are all lined up in a west-to-east direction around that latitude. It's quite a spectacular appearing circulation pattern. And the little wave that I mentioned on New Zealand seems to be beginning to form another arrow or another convex point on that front that's fitting right into the same circulation pattern.
0223628|KRANZ|Okay, copy.
0223632|LMP|That would make four of those major convex fronts that I can see from this view crossing - south of Australia up into the South Pacific.
0223649|KRANZ|Okay.
0223704|LMP|On - on that tropical storm that was Theresa, I don't know whether they're still calling it now - that now, but I'm not sure it may be a little south of Guam. Guam may not be in trouble with that one.
0223721|KRANZ|It looks like it's just a bit to the west of Manila there - about 5 or 6 degrees, no more than that about. It looks like it's about 5 degrees west of Manila and about 5 degrees south. And it is still called Theresa.
0223937|LMP|Okay, Gene, if you're still there, I don't like to argue with you but I think our analysis chart is a little more up to date.
0223944|KRANZ|Okay.
0223945|LMP|That center - that area that you just mentioned is very clear now - east of the Philippines. Did you say west or east of the Philippines?
0223955|KRANZ|West of the Philippines.
0224001|LMP|Okay, that area that you mentioned, 5 degrees east, is very clear and the center of the - what appears to be the storm that I'm speaking of, would be about 142 longitude and maybe 8 degrees north latitude.
0224019|KRANZ|Okay.
0224019|LMP|Which would put it south of Guam.
0224022|KRANZ|Okay, yes, you're over in the area between Guam and the Carolines, then.
0224026|LMP|Say again, Gene?
0224027|KRANZ|You're over in the area between Guam and the Carolines, then. You're saying it would be just about due west of the Carolines, then. Okay.
0224038|LMP|Yes, you're probably looking at a - oh, I don't know - maybe a what - a 12-hour old prog, or something?
0224044|KRANZ|Yes, that's the one I had for launch date.
0224049|LMP|Okay. Well, it's - it's - moved quite a bit now, and I guess it's the same storm; still seems to be very well organized but quite concentrated and small.
0224102|KRANZ|Okay. I'll get a new prog in and compare your estimate there.
0224110|LMP|Okay. I think that's pretty good - those - 142 and 8 degrees would be pretty good center of that storm. I've got some pretty good coor - I can see Mindanao, and I can see the - let's see - just a second - what is that on Australia?
0224152|LMP|Yes, of course, that is Port Moresby. I can see that point there, and between those two - I can pin that one down probably within a couple of degrees.
0224202|KRANZ|Okay. We'll get a satellite photo and bring it in here in just a bit.
0224254|PAO|The conversation over the past few minutes has been between Flight Director, Gene Kranz, and Jack Schmitt. Apollo 17 at this time, almost directly above the northeast coast of Australia - some 94,000 nautical miles from earth.
0225000|CMP|Houston, canister number 4 is in Bravo now.
0225009|CC|Roger. We copy that.
0225611|LMP|Houston, 17.
0225624|CC|Go ahead, 17.
0225633|LMP|Okay, Bob. That storm off the - just off the southwest coast of New Zealand is still intensifying and has both high and low level clouds as you can see by shadow lines. It looks like it may go into pretty - pretty fair storm system. Borneo is very clear today; and, as is the Philippines. And as I mentioned, there's a - looks like a very strong frontal system that stretches from, oh, let's say, the south coast of - or southeast coast of Vietnam up - up between and across Tai - between the Philippines and Taiwan and across Taiwan. And right along, and I can't tell I think, just off - just south of Japan. I can't tell whether Japan is in the front or not. I'll look at it some more. The strongest storm center that I can see on that is - is way north, and probably - Hokkaido is - has a fair amount of weather from that storm system. There seems to be a tropical depression just north of Borneo. A very strong circulation system north of Borneo and, I guess, just south of - of Vietnam.
0225834|CC|Roger.
0225836|LMP|Probably south - probably southeast. I hadn't noticed it before, but it's extremely concentrated northern hemisphere cycl - cyclone pattern. I don't know whether that's on your prog or not. That's not what's left of Sally, is it?
0225858|CC|Stand by. Let me look at the prog over here a sec. Okay. We - it doesn't show on the old one; the new one is coming in there shortly, Jack.
0225907|LMP|Okay. If that is a developing depression, it's approaching Luzon and not very far away - 2 or 3 degrees of longitude now, although Luzon is clear.
0225925|CC|Roger.
0225936|LMP|I can see Korea quite well, Bob. It's clear today.
0225943|CC|Yes, we - we've got the fronts. The leading edge of the front on our prog was past Korea and on Japan, and you've got it moving quite a bit further east there.
0225954|LMP|Well, I'm not absolutely sure -
0225957|LMP|MASTER ALARM on the accumulator.
0230001|CC|Roger. We copy.
0230006|LMP|I can't make out Japan spe - specifically yet; but it's clearly past Korea, and, by - by inspection, it looks like it would be also past Japan by now, the trailing edge of the front. However, the circulation center on farther northeast may be affecting Hokkaido, as I said.
0230033|CC|Roger. Like I said, the front on the old prog for yesterday showed that front on the other side of Japan, so it's moved across pretty well.
0230059|LMP|As I recall, they had a tropical storm called Sally that went into - ... a few days ago, and so I suspect this new one that seems - that I think I see between Borneo and Vietnam maybe something else; a new depression or I may be - be fooled by it.
0230149|LMP|Mainland China, Bob, was the last pass here. I can't see the Ear - see the Earth now, but Mainland China looked like it was clear as far as I could see. There might be another front quite a ways inland, but that gets right at the LM, and I can't tell. But Korea, Yellow Sea, and the regions of China south of there - Shanghai , Nanking and those places are - look as if they are quite clear today. I'll check that again next time around.
0230221|CC|Roger.
0230228|CC|And, Jack, we are ready to terminate the charge on BATTERY B and start the charge on BATTERY A.
0230238|LMP|Okay. That's in work.
0230355|LMP|Houston, for your information, system test 7A is about 0.6.
0230402|CC|Say that again, Jack. I missed that. 0.6 on system test 7A?
0230407|LMP|That's affirm. Battery compartment pressure.
0230412|CC|Thank you, Jack.
0230445|LMP|Okay, Bob. BATTERY A is being charged now.
0230451|CC|Roger, Jack.
0230630|LMP|Bob, you got any of the LMies in there today?
0230636|CC|Any of the LMies? Roger. They're all sitting by. Just gave me a big thumbs up, Jack.
0230644|LMP|Okay. Give them a thumbs up on the rendezvous radar antenna. It looks real good.
0230655|CC|Roger.
0230657|LMP|I'm nose-to-nose with it practically here at about 2 feet, and it's extremely clean. And I see absolutely no sign of any - anything abnormal with it.
0230718|CC|Roger.
0230731|LMP|Matter of fact, compared to some of the flaking problems and things like that we've heard about in the past, I never saw a cleaner piece of hardware that that LM looks right now.
0230741|CC|Roger.
0230750|LMP|Appropriately, finally we're getting - we're starting to use it during the Christmas season. It sure looks like a Christmas package with all the orange tape on it.
0230759|CC|Roger.
0230808|CC|Ron, we got your NOUN - NOUN 05.
0230813|CMP|Okay. I'll go ahead and accept that one this time.
0230859|CC|We got the 9 degrees, Ron. You can torque.
0230906|CMP|Okay. I'll torque at 940.
0230914|CC|Okay. We got it.
0230926|CC|And, Jack, we've been looking at our records. We don't have a previous SYSTEMS TEST reading for 7 Alfa. Do you recall any previous readings on that one?
0231003|LMP|Okay, that looks like another accumulator cycle - got a MASTER ALARM.
0231015|CC|We dropped data just then, Jack, so we can't concur or confirm it. That's exactly the right time - -
0231025|LMP|... all right.
0231034|LMP|Bob, you cut out about your SYSTEMS TEST meter discussion.
0231038|CC|Roger, Jack. Do you have any previous 7 Alfa readings? We don't have any in our log here written. We're just wondering what the past readings on that was.
0231051|LMP|No, I think that was the first one we would have been called to make after a battery charge, right?
0231057|CC|That's affirm, Jack.
0231128|CC|Go ahead, Jack. I - you're coming in very weak.
0231135|LMP|Well, I didn't intend to be transmitting. We were just discussing the battery vent and things. We may have missed something in the dump checklist. We'll check it out.
0231144|CC|No, sir. We don't think so. We just thought may you might have read it earlier.
0231150|LMP|Oh, yes, you want the battery vent - it should be closed now, right?
0231156|CC|Stand by, Jack.
0231200|LMP|Okay. Ron says it ought to be open.
0231202|CC|That - that's affirm - -.
0231203|LMP|... So let me check the checklist.
0231204|CC|- - it should be open. That - there's no question about that. It should be open.
0231209|LMP|Okay. It's open.
0231212|CC|Really, there's no problem, Jack. It should be open, but the value appears a bit low to us, and we'd like to read it again before you go to sleep. We may want to close it. And a nominal reading would be 1.7 - -
0231231|LMP|Okay. We - we closed it when we were doing all our dumping some time back and neglected to open it again. So, it was closed when I gave you the reading, and it has been closed during some 2 hours, anyway. I'll - you can figure out how long.
0231252|CC|Okay. We - we copy that.
0231326|CC|Jack, would you mind opening the vent and watching the system meter concurrently with it?
0231338|LMP|Stand by.
0231439|LMP|Well, it's - it's CLOSED now, and it's still reading what it - 0.6. Do you want us to open it again?
0231449|CC|Roger. Open the VENT and - -
0231450|LMP|I mean, it's open now. I'm - I'm sorry, Bob. It is now open and reading 0.6. It read 0.6 when it was CLOSED.
0231500|CC|Okay. Just leave it open now.
0231505|LMP|Okay.
0231507|CC|And we will want to still check it prior to your sleep period.
0231514|LMP|Okay.
0231534|LMP|Okay, Bob, a little update on the coast of Asia. It looks like some residual cloudiness would be affecting the Pusan region of Korea. And, also, that's residual after the frontal passage. And it looks like maybe Shanghai, after all, may have some storms associated with it, but it's really hard to pick out exactly - the exact coast line of Asia, but I - there are some clouds in the Yellow Sea, behind the front, Look like they might be possibly some high cirrus is all.
0231621|CC|Jack, do you still see that storm that you said was sitting between Guam and - Borneo in that area?
0231634|LMP|Okay. I see there is this cloud concentration between New Guinea and Guam. The more I look at it the less well developed it appears to me compared to some of the other circulation patterns. It could be just a residual depression from Teresa that has moved out into that area. It is an isolated, a relatively isolated cloud pattern, fairly small, but apparently fairly dense. But has - does not have a strong cyclonic pattern to it. Nothing at all like the pattern that now exists above Borneo and seems to be moving towards Luzon.
0231718|CC|Roger. We copy.
0232004|LMP|Say ...
0232133|LMP|Okay, Houston. We're moving in the pieces of a Presleep Checklist. Here's some onboard read-outs for you. BATTERY C is 37.0; PYRO BAT A, 37.2; PYRO BAT B, 37.2; RCS A, 95; Bravo, 94; Charlie, 94; Delta is 96.
0232210|CC|Roger. We copy that. And if you've started it, we don't want you to reinitialize the PTC until about 2400 on the timeline.
0232227|LMP|Okay. We're - we're just getting a little ahead - we - took us longer last night on the presleep than we expected. We're trying to work it out again.
0232235|CC|Yes. We don't to - we want to terminate the waste stowage vent at that time, because we think that that vent is what's contributing to our PTC coning.
0232246|LMP|Okay. We're - we're not - we're not really ready to go to sleep yet, but we're just moving ahead.
0232252|CC|Roger.
0232258|LMP|And if it's okay, I'll cycle the H2 fans.
0232307|CC|Roger. We're standing by.
0232416|LMP|Okay. The fans are off.
0232418|CC|Roger.
0232436|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 23 hours 25 minutes. The crew has completed realigning the inertial measurement platform, the platform used as a stable reference. The spacecraft guidance and control system uses it as a reference in determining its own attitude. They've also been charging the two entry batteries that are used during peak electrical loads of liftoff, and then are recharged during the translunar coast when the fuel cells are producing a surplus of electrical energy. They've recharged one of those two batteries and are in the process of recharging the second one at this time. And you heard the crew describe going into their pre-sleep checklist and getting things aboard the spacecraft configured for the sleep period, which is scheduled to begin at 25 hours Ground Elapsed Time or a little more than 1-1/2 hours from now. Apollo 17 at this time is 96,244 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at 5,264 feet per second. And all spacecraft systems continue to function almost perfectly as planned. A little while ago the lunar module officer - control officer - confirmed from telemetry what Gene Cernan was reporting visually out the window and that is that the lunar module appears to be in very good shape. Of course we have a limited number of telemetry readings on the LM at this point. But one of them that we do have gives us an indication of the integrity or tightness of the LM cabins. We can see that in the amount of pressure decaying. It appears to be a very tight vehicle.
0232827|CC|Say, Jack, we got a request in here from our ARIA friends.
0232838|LMP|Go ahead.
0232840|CC|They were just wondering if your looking out that way, if you could give them some sort of update of what the weather in the Wake island - Kwajalein - the south of the Wake area looks like.
0232851|LMP|Okay. Let me work on that one.
0232853|CC|Okay. You're going to mearn - earn your American Meteorological Society badge here pretty quick.
0232907|LMP|Okay. Let me get the monocular, and we'll look at Wake island. I miss having all those nice latitude and longitude lines on the globe.
0232923|CC|Yes sir.
0232943|PAO|The ARIA friends that CAPCOM, Robert Overmeyer, is refering to, are the crews of the Apollo Range Instrumented Aircraft used in supplementing the manned spaceflight network coverage. They'll be leaving from Patrick Airforce Base prior to the end of the mission and flying into the Wake island area to be on station during Apollo 17's reentry and splashdown.
0233344|LMP|Okay, Bob. I'll probably have to work on this one a little more, but - but it looks like around Wake, or in the vicinity of the Kwajaleins and north of Wake, about all you have is a lot of cloudiness although - and in a generally - over a wide part of that Pacific, I'm talking about 15 or 20 degrees of longitude and latitude, there's a - roughly a clock - a clockwise circulation pattern. But the clouds do not look very dense or concentrated in any one area. And at leading off to the southeast from that general cloud mass, there're cyclonic - anticyclonic cloud mass is a - is one of the old fronts - or at least one of the old linear cloud patterns that extends down into the South Pacific.
0233506|CC|Roger, Jack. I'm sure that the ARIA troops are listening down at Patrick and caught all that.
0233514|LMP|Well, my guess is, Bob, and it's purely a guess, is that there - probably - if they were out there right now, would be experiencing an intermediate layer of clouds with scattered showers. And a not too strongly developed circulation system, so I can't predict the winds. But I wouldn't expect them to be anything - anything what might be down - associated with the remnants of the tropical depression Theresa. Now that Theresa - what's left of it, if I'm correct in - in picking it out there, probably is - is moving in that direction, although it looks weak enough that, right now I don't think it would be any big problem. And it may, in fact, go south of there.
0233611|CC|Roger. The prog I got in my hand for 3-hour-old weather has Theresa located just about in the Manila area. Did you concur with that, or do you think it passed the - the Philippines?
0233625|LMP|Well, I don't - Manila's clear. The only thing approaching near Manila is - is this other storm center that now is north of Borneo. And to the east of Manila, it's clear all the way over to this little cloud mass that I was guessing might be Theresa.
0233644|CC|Roger. All I say, this is 3 hours old so - -
0233646|LMP|- - And that's about - I gave Gene Kranz some coordinates on it. You can look it up. Those were pretty good coordinates for that cloud mass. Now whether that's really Theresa or not, I don't know.
0233702|CC|We got one thing with - for the last couple of hours here, we've been getting high-bit-rate data through our new facility - a new facility at Tidbinbilla, Tidbinbilla is to a 210 dish, and they're covering the first - -
0233714|LMP|- - between Wake in the Kwajaleins , Marshall islands, in that area, it doesn't look like a very concentrated weather pattern, although it looks like you'll have ceilings in that region. And they're overcast ceilings rather than broken. Except around the fringes of it.
0233731|CC|Roger.
0233735|LMP|We'll keep an eye on it of course.
0233751|CC|Jack, how do you read us now?
0233754|LMP|You're loud and clear.
0233756|CC|Okay, 17, for the last 2 hours, we've been getting high-bit-rate data from a new facility, the facility at Tidbinbilla and they're working their first Apollo flight ever, you might give them a cheery hellow.
0233821|LMP|Tidbinbilla, is that correct?
0233824|CC|That's affirmative. It's very close to the Honeysuckle base - -
0233828|LMP|Where is that?
0233829|CC|Very close to Honeysuckle.
0233833|LMP|Well, how you doing - how you doing mates? We certainly appreciate you guys being on the loop for this one.
0233923|PAO|That new 210 foot dish antenna at Tidbinbilla, which is near Honeysuckle Creek, which in turn is near Canberra, now online and accounting for our excellent signal strength from the spacecraft. Apollo 17 at this time is 96,958 nautical miles from Earth. The speed is 5,233 feet per second.
0234001|CC|17, Houston. We'd like ACCEPT, and we'll update your gyro drift, the pitch, roll, and yaw drifts.
0234012|CDR|Okay, got ACCEPT and P00.
0234016|CC|Roger.
0234512|CC|17, Houston. The computer is yours. And you can go back to attitude and reinitialize PTC whenever you want to.
0234518|CDR|Go ahead, Bob.
0234521|CC|The computer is yours, Gene - -
0234522|CDR|Go ahead. We're reading you.
0234523|CC|You can go to attitude and reinitialize PTC whenever you want to.
0234530|CDR|Okay. Did you mean to leave the computer with VERB 21 NOUN 01 up?
0234536|CC|Roger. That's your computer with that - as you got it.
0234541|CDR|Okay; that's right. That's 1462.
0234643|CDR|Okay.
0235009|CC|17, Houston.
0235014|CMP|Roger. Go ahead.
0235015|CC|Roger. We've got a recommended configuration for your H2 fans and H2 heaters. We would like the H2 HEATERS 1 and 2 to AUTO and H2 FANS 1 and 2, OFF; 3 to AUTO. Your O2 heaters look good.
0235045|LMP|Okay. Let me verify that I've got these right. H2 HEATERS 1, 2, AUTO. O2 HEATERS, 1 OFF; 2, OFF; 3, AUTO. H2 FANS - H2 FANS, you want OFF; OFF; and AUTO. is that correct?
0235107|CC|That's what we want on the H2 FANS. And the O2 is fine, as you've got it.
0235114|LMP|Okay. They're OFF, OFF - Okay; H2 FANS: OFF, OFF, and AUTO.
0235120|CC|That's affirmative, Jack.
0235133|CDR|Okay, Bob. I just cleaned the suit circuit return valve screen, here. It was probably, as expected, a little crud on it. A few things have collected, but really not too bad.
0235148|CC|Roger, Gene.
0235329|LMP|Bob, a little more about Wake and the Marshalls and Kwajalein. That large pattern of what appear to be broken overcast clouds in a - a clockwise circulation pattern - crosses the equator region now that I've tried to project that through.
0235353|CC|Roger, Jack.
0235725|CC|17, Houston.
0235732|CMP|17, go ahead.
0235733|CC|Roger, Ron. When you stop the present roll on the PTC to reinitialize, pick a roll angle of 315 or 130 for stopping, so that we have good comm during the damping period.
0235751|CMP|Okay. 315 or 120, okay.
0235753|CC|130, Ron.
0235757|CMP|Okay. 315 or 130.
0235803|CC|Roger. That'll give us good comm to watch the data on the damping.
0235808|CMP|Okay.
0235935|PAO|This is Apollo Control, now 24 hours after liftoff and Apollo 17, 97,917 nautical miles from Earth. The crew, at the present time, is stopping the passive thermal control mode. They'll be reestablishing it. It had begun to diverge a little bit - it had begun to wobble about the axis. The concern in going to sleep with that sort of situation is that it will wobble through the point at which they would have gimbal lock and of course we would wake them up before then but in order to avoid having to disturb the crew's sleep they'd like to get the passive thermal control very stable, so that it will hold up during the entire sleep period.
0240029|CDR|Hello, Houston. How do you read?
0240031|CC|Read you loud and clear, 17.
0240034|CDR|Okay. We're at 300. Do you want us to go to 315 yet, or is 300 going to be okay?
0240039|CC|That's good enough, Gene. And we'd like you to close your waste vent at this time, please.
0240056|CDR|Okay.
0240107|CDR|Okay. It's CLOSED now.
0240109|CC|Roger.
0240132|CC|And, 17, Houston. We've got the same recommendation. We recommend Alfa and Bravo for damping; Bravo and Delta for spinup. Over.
0240148|CDR|That was Alfa and Bravo for damping and Bravo and Delta for spinup.
0240152|CC|That's affirmative
0240451|CC|17, Houston.
0240455|CMP|Go ahead.
0240458|CC|If one of you want to break out the Flight Plan Supplement, we have a change to the E-LOADS on page 143 due to the change of gyro-compensation parameters. If you want to copy them down when you get the Supplement out.
0240514|CDR|Okay. We'll give you a call.
0240515|CC|Roger. We'll be standing by.
0240627|CDR|Okay, Bob. We're in our - we're on our damping cycle now.
0240634|CC|Roger. We're watching you, Gene.
0240816|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're in the midst of turning over the shift now to Mission Control, to the team of Flight Director, Pete Frank. Gene Kranz and his team will be going off shift in about 25 minutes. we do not plan to have a change of shift Press Briefing. The crew aboard Apollo 17 is scheduled to begin an 8 hour sleep period in a little less than one hour at a Ground Elapsed Time of 25 hours. And we have no major activities in the flight plan before that time. At 24 hours 9 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
0241213|CDR|Bob, I just hit the control stick. It's locked again in roll; it may have bumped it a little bit.
0241220|CC|Roger, Gene. We copy.
0241715|LMP|Houston, 17. Okay if we CLOSE the waste stowage vent now? Oh, okay. I'm sorry. It's CLOSED.
0241723|CC|Roger, 17.
0241728|LMP|Forget it. We got it, I - I was left out.
0241753|LMP|Okay, Bob. On the film status, we're still where we were, November-November, 134. And I'll probably take two more pictures before we go to sleep.
0241811|CC|Roger. We copy.
0241938|CC|And, 17, if one of you are down in the LEB, could you give us a read-out on SYSTEMS TEST 7 Alfa?
0241945|LMP|Stand by. ... Okay
0242058|LMP|Houston, 17. 7 Alfa is 0.6.
0242103|CC|Roger. 7 Alfa equals 0.6.
0242251|LMP|Okay, Houston; 17. Are we configured properly now for comm?
0242304|CC|Stand by, Gor - stand by, Jack.
0242311|LMP|Okay. I've got - I'm on OMNI Bravo right now.
0242324|CC|We're in good shape on the comm, and we'll be controlling the OMNIs.
0242354|LMP|Roger, Bob.
0242401|CC|17, the rates look great. We're ready to initialize PTC.
0242412|CDR|Okay, Bob.
0242714|CDR|Okay, Bob. PTC is initiated.
0242718|CC|Roger, Gene. We copy, and we watch the roll start.
0243303|CDR|Hello, Houston. I think we've got everything done on the checklist. The chlorine has been - water has been chlorinated, we're in PTC, and I think Jack picked up everything else. How does it look to you?
0243319|CC|Roger, Gene. Let's - let us make a check through the room here, and then just a reminder that I've got that addition on the E-LOADS for the - in the Flight Plan Supplement.
0243335|CDR|Yes. Stand by. Jack's going to keep the headset on and the biomed, and he'll close you out with that, and if there's nothing else, I'm going to go off the air.
0243346|CC|Roger, Gene.
0243349|CDR|Okay, say goodnight to my friends back there.
0243353|CC|We certainly will.
0243356|CDR|Hey, Just so that we know, it is about midnight, right?
0243400|CC|It's about 7 minutes after midnight, Gene.
0243406|CDR|Okay, Just didn't want - wanted to make sure it wasn't noon.
0243410|CC|Roger.
0243413|CDR|Good night there, Robert.
0243414|CC|Good night, Gene.
0243420|CMP|Okay. Say good night, Dick.
0243555|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 24 hours 36 minutes as Gene Cernan says goodnight Apollo 17 is 99,714 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity 5,114 feet per second. The Lunar Module Pilot, Jack Schmitt, will be wearing the communications headset and the biomedical harness for the sleep period tonight.
0243644|LMP|Bob? This is Jack. Your last report for the day as the Earth goes past window 5. The first thing I noticed was that our zero phase point is not nearly as bright on the west coast of Australia as it is on the - was on the east. And it's looking right at the coastline now and see no bright spot in the center. Also, that circulation pattern or tropical depression possibly that I saw earlier north of Borneo is now even more strongly developed at the tail end of the front that stretches up toward Japan. And it - it really looks like a humdinger from here. Beautiful circulation pattern and very concentrated. And it is now east of Vietnam, and again between Vietnam and - and the island of Luzon.
0243756|CC|Roger. We copy.
0243757|LMP|And I'd be very - be very curious to know tomorrow morning if you - you people are carrying that one on their progs or on their analysis chart.
0243810|CC|Roger.
0244133|LMP|Okay, Bob. You want me to erase something on page 1-43 and insert something else?
0244140|CC|That's affirmative, Jack. On 1-43 under column A, down at line 11 and 12 and 13. Just to make sure you're at the right spot, the line 11 0-data is 00115. Do you copy that? Do you see that?
0244205|LMP|I'm with you.
0244206|CC|Okay. Change that line to 00377.
0244218|LMP|Go ahead.
0244219|CC|Change line 12 to 00050.
0244232|LMP|Go ahead.
0244233|CC|And line 13, 00523. Over.
0244245|LMP|Okay, I got that and (laughter) as you might imagine, when I said erase, I did. And do you have the 04 and the 05 again, please? That is, if they're pertinent.
0244304|CC|Stand by, Jack. I'm lost myself here a second.
0244310|LMP|See, you gave me an update on 30704 and 31005, and I just erased it.
0244319|CC|Okay, The 04 under column B is 34761, and the 05 line under column B is 15403. Over.
0244341|LMP|Okay. Here we go. In line Alfa, 31411, 00377; 31512, 00050; 31613, 00523. In line Bravo, 30704 is 34761; 31005 is 15403. Over.
0244412|CC|Roger. We copy, Jack. Just a reminder to be sure and configure the comm per the presleep checklist. And, just for your information, Jack, I - I hold you at 100,116 miles. I was going to give you a call at 100,000 even, and then I got talking to you. So you've crossed the 100,000 mark right now. Tomorrow, you're probably not going to be giving us our weather report, You'll be too far out, but we'll probably be starting to hear from the Moon, huh?
0244444|LMP|We're not going to see much of the Moon, you know. It's going to be pretty dark, so I'll have to keep looking at the Earth.
0244450|CC|Roger.
0244450|LMP|Pretty good - pretty interesting place. Very interesting place.
0244456|CC|I'm real sure.
0244458|LMP|And I guess - I guess, maybe, I - 100,000 miles. My goodness gracious. That's impressive.
0244508|CC|Yes, sir. You're slowing down all the way, Jack.
0244519|LMP|Well, it's sure downhill all - all the way back, isn't it?
0244522|CC|That's for sure.
0244537|CC|Jack, did the CMP get off the line, and is he sacked out now, too?
0244544|LMP|Yes, I lost both those guys. They - they decided they wanted to sleep, and I may be rumbling around here for a while but I took - we all three took Seconal, so I think we'll get to sleep before long.
0244557|CC|Roger. Just give us a call if you need anything, and we'll be watching everything there, and pleasant dreams.
0244611|LMP|Now, you don't really mean that, do you?
0244616|CC|Well, I can't come up and tuck you in so - hope you have a good sleep. You need lots of rest up there, gang.
0244637|LMP|I'll tell you, Bob, about halfway though this day, I think I acclimated. And I really feel good. I've been eating a lot better, and I'm not - the only thing I ever really felt was a slight headache. It really - not the fullness of the head that people described, I guess, but just a little headache. I could have been looking at the Earth too much. I don't know.
0244702|CC|Roger, Jack. You've been sounding good.
0244706|LMP|Oh, actually, I feel - I've been feeling fine. Just - none of us have felt like eating. And that's probably normal, and everybody's eating more now, and we'll start getting to sleep, I think.
0244718|CC|Roger. Jack, just a reminder on that comm for the presleep checklist. It's important to us because we can get the - we can get high-bit-rate data more.
0244748|LMP|Bob, you cut out, but I'm in the comm sleep configuration now. I'm working that way.
0244758|CC|Okay. Ed Grindell was shaking his head for a minute. Now he says as long as you're working that way.
0244838|LMP|Bob, you still cut out. Let's try it again.
0244842|CC|No - no problem, Jack, Just a reminder on the comm; that's all. We're watching you go through the checklist here.
0244849|LMP|Okay.
0244914|LMP|Okay, I'm on HIGH GAIN now, and OMNI Bravo selected.
0244937|LMP|How do you read, Bob, on the HIGH GAIN?
0244939|CC|Read you loud and clear, Jack.
0244944|LMP|Okay. And it's in REACQ and NARROW.
0244947|CC|Stand by. Stand by on that, Jack.
0245030|CC|Say, Jack, can we refer you to the checklist on S/1-27, a sleep configuration there, where you S-BAND SQUELCH, ENABLE, et cetera?
0245044|LMP|Roger. I'm ENABLED.
0245055|LMP|Oh, et cetera. Yes.
0245100|CC|Roger.
0245105|LMP|Okay. I'll get to that in a minute, Bob. Who knows, I might have something else to say.
0245108|CC|Okay.
0245132|LMP|Bob, I just probably ought to qualify all those remarks about the Earth's weather. It's purely a novice talking about something he is very unfamiliar with, except for having a longstanding interest in it. And I think the one philosophical point, if any, that comes out of it is that somebody, probably 3-1/2 billion years ago or so, could have looked at the Earth and described patterns not too dissimilar. And it was within those patterns that life developed, and now you see, I think, and obvious to everybody, what that life has progressed to doing. And I certainly think all of us feel that it has not stopped doing that progression, and we'll probably see it do things that even you and I can't imagine them doing I certainly hope so.
0245238|CC|Roger, Jack. We concur.
0245406|LMP|Bob, you always wished that you had a poet onboard one of these missions, so he could describe things that we're seeing and looking at and feeling in terms that might - might transmit at least a part of that feeling to everybody in the world. Unfortunately, that's not the case. But he certainly couldn't look at that fragile blue globe and not think about the ancient sails of life that are crossing its paths and wonder ahead to the - up to the present, to the modern sails of life that are represented by men that developed out of that life that are sitting there next to you and that are the country in all sorts of different guises and working towards the same end, and that is to put that life farther into the universe. I certainly hope that someday, in the not-too-distant future, the guy can fly who can express these things.
0245524|CC|Roger, Jack. You're doing a pretty good job expressing them.
0245825|CC|Jack, Houston.
0245830|LMP|Go ahead.
0245831|CC|Roger, Jack. We'd like to go to select OMNI Bravo, and stow the high gain the the normal stowage. It's customary we do not use the high gain for PTC going TLC.
0245855|LMP|Okay, Bob. I'm sorry, but the checklist indicated that you do, I'll go back to OMNI Bravo.
0245904|CC|Roger. It's probably ambiguous. If you end up going up on the checklist, up to the top of 1-28, it shows you where you want OMNI Bravo.
0245925|LMP|Ambiguous is the best word I can think of for it.
0245930|CC|Say again, Jack.
0245934|LMP|Ambiguous is the best word I can think of for it.
0245937|CC|Roger. We - I concur. I should have probably called you earlier and just pointed out on the Flight Plan where it says presleep checklist. And then there's the word "comm," and it says "OMNI," and that leads you into the checklist and makes sure you use the OMNI setup for - for the sleep configuration.
0245958|LMP|Ho, ho, ho. Tricky fellows. I guess you're right.
0250006|CC|Yes, it's something we don't - we don't - sim PTCs, TLCs, and TECs very often. That's for sure.
0250021|LMP|Well, that's because we have a whole day to learn out here.
0250024|CC|That's affirmative.
0250031|LMP|OMNI Bravo.
0250033|CC|Roger.
0250116|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 25 hours, 1 minute into the mission. Apollo 17 is 100,953 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity 5,062 feet per second.
0252240|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 25 hours 22 minutes. We haven't heard from Jack Schmitt recently, however, the Flight Surgeon reports that his data indicates he's not yet asleep. Apollo 17 now at 102,000 miles from Earth velocity 5,018 feet per second. We'll continue to leave this line up until we get an indication that the Lunar Module Pilot is asleep. The other 2 crewmen are asleep at this time. At 25 hours 23 minutes, this is Mission Control, Houston.
0252537|LMP|Okay, Bob. I think I'll hit the hay. How does everything look to you?
0252550|CC|Looking pretty good, Jack. We'd like the S-BAND NORMAL VOICE to OFF, and S-BAND SQUELCH ENABLE, please.
0252559|LMP|Yes, I'll get that. I just want to make sure that PTC and everthing looks good.
0252604|CC|Yes, it looks real fine, Jack.
0252610|LMP|Okay, talk to you in the morning - or to somebody anyway.
0252613|CC|Roger. Parker will wake you up - I think. Have a good sleep.
0252617|LMP|Oh god.
0252626||REST PERIOD - NO COMMUNICATIONS
0252652|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 25 hours 27 minutes. Jack Schmitt has said "goodnight". We'll take the line down now and come back up with Mission Control reports hourly. Apollo 17 now 102,202 nautical miles from Earth, velocity 5,010 feet per second.
0262701|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 26 hours 27 minutes. The crew has completed the first hour and 1/2 of an 8 hour rest period. Here in Mission Control, flight controllers are monitoring spacecraft's systems while the crew sleeps. All goes well with Apollo 17. Spacecraft is 105,060 nautical miles from Earth. Its velocity is 4,893 feet per second. This is Mission Control, Houston.
0272711|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 27 hours 27 minutes. 5-1/2 hours remain in the crew's rest period. All spacecraft systems continue to operate normally. Apollo 17 is now 107,835 nautical miles from Earth, velocity 4,784 feet per second.
0282702|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 28 hours 27 minutes. Everything continues to go well with Apollo 17. Astronaut Bob Parker has come on duty at the CAPCOM console now, and he will send a wakeup call to the crew in 4 hours and 32 minutes. Apollo 17 is 110,561 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity 4,679 feet per second.
0292701|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 29 hours 27 minutes. Apollo 17 is 113,208 nautical miles from Earth. Traveling at a speed at 4,579 feet per second. In 36 minutes, Apollo 17 will reach the half-way point to the Moon in terms of distance, at a Ground Elapsed Time of 30 hours, 3 minutes, no seconds. Apollo 17 will be 114,787 nautical miles from both the Moon and the Earth. 3 hours, 32 minutes remaining in the crew's sleep period. At 29 hours 27 minutes, this is Mission Control, Houston.
0302702|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 30 hours 27 minutes. 24 minutes ago Apollo 17 did reach the half-way point in distance in its journey to the Moon. At that time in the elapsed time of 30 hours 3 minutes, it was 114,787 nautical miles from both the Earth and the Moon. Its velocity at that time was 4,522 feet per second. At this time, Apollo 17's distance is 115,842 nautical miles from the Earth. Velocity is 4,483 feet per second. Midcourse correction number 2 will be performed at an elapsed time of 35 hours 30 minutes. That's 5 hours, 1 minute from now. It will be a 10.5 foot per second burn. The crew still has 2 hours and 31 minutes remaining in the sleep period. At 30 hours 28 minutes this is Mission Control Houston.
0311210|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 31 hours 12 minutes. Apollo 17 is now 117,746 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a speed of 4,415 feet per second. Flight Director, Pete Frank, and his orange team of flight controllers will hand over Mission Control duties to Gerry Griffin's gold team of flight controllers in about 15 minutes at 7 A.M. Central Standard Time. Each of the departing controllers is now briefing his relief. There will be no change of shift news conference. The orange team will double back after 1 shift, returning to the Control Center at 5 P.M. today to get back on a schedule which will put them on the EVA shift. To summarize the shift now ending, the crew began rest period at 25 hours elapsed time. Each crewman took a sleeping pill, and Jack Schmitt reported that Gene Cernan and Ron Evans were asleep shortly after the crew configured the spacecraft for their rest period. However, Jack Schmitt, who was the duty man to wear the head set and the bio-medical harness during this rest period, seemed almost reluctant to surrender his view of the earth to sleep. At 100,000 nautical miles from the Earth he broadcast a weather forecast, then indulged in a bit of philosophy as he gazed from his window, about mankind's achievements. He remarked that from his vantage point the Earth probably looks the same now as it did at the dawn of man. Apollo 17 reached the halfway point to the Moon at an elapsed time of 30 hours 3 minutes. At that time it was 114,787 nautical miles from both the Earth and the Moon. Spacecraft's systems are continuing to perform well and the CAPCOM, astronaut Bob Parker, plans to awaken the crew at 33 hours elapsed time, that's 1 hour 44 minutes from now. Midcourse correction number 2 will be performed at an elapsed time of 35 hours 30 minutes, 4 hours and 14 minutes from now. Present indications are that it will be a 10 and 1/2 foot per second burn. The latest prediction on the S-IVB is that it will impact the Moon at an elapsed time of 86 hours 58 minutes 23 seconds. Coordinates of the impact location presently predicted 6.73 degrees south, 9.7 degrees west. The impact time and the coordinates are likely to change prior to the impact itself, and continued tracking of the S-IVB will be performed. At 31 hours 16 minutes, this is Mission Control, Houston.
0322707|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 32 hours 27 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The Mission of Apollo 17, which at this moment is 120,887 nautical miles out from Earth, velocity has continued to decrease to 4,305 feet per second. Slightly over a half hour remaining until spacecraft communicator Robert Parker gives the crew a wakeup call. And a relatively busy day ahead with midcourse correction - midcourse correction maneuver #2 at 35:30 Ground Elapsed Time, a 10-1/2-foot per second posigrade maneuver which will raise the trajectory slightly from an impact trajectory with a minus pericynthion at the Moon, raise it to about 60 nautical miles above the surface. Latest numbers on the S-IVB impact predictions is for impact to take place at a Ground Elapsed Time of 86:58:23 at 6.7 degrees south latitude by 9.7 degrees west longitude. The gold team of flight controllers have settled in for a 10-hour day here in Mission Control, which in addition to the midcourse correction burn, includes the first manning of the Lunar Module, first checkout, which begins at about 40 hours. They start actually, at 39:30 getting the probe and drogue removed from the tunnel, going into the Lunar Module. We'll come back up live with the air-ground when the first call is made to the crew by the spacecraft communicator. And at 32:29, this is Apollo Control.
0325801|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 32 hours 58 minutes Ground Elapsed Time into the Mission of Apollo 17, Almost 2 minutes remaining until the first wakeup call is made to the Crew of Apollo 17 by spacecraft communicator Robert Parker. Parker is joined this morning by Apollo 17 backup Commander John Young at the CAPCOM console, and it appears that Parker's relief CAPCOM, Gordo Fullerton, just walked in the door and likely will relieve Parker in the day's duties of getting off midcourse correction #2 burn, and the first housekeeping venture into the Lunar Module. Apollo 17 is now 122,186 nautical miles out from the Earth, velocity now 4,259 feet per second. We'll stand by with the circuit open for the first wakeup call the usual post-sleep checklist, and Flight Plan updates and all of the conversation that normally takes place when the crew first wakes up. Let's just open the line now.
0330038|CC|Apollo 17, Houston. Good morning.
0330106|LMP|Is that the best you could do?
0330109|CC|That's not very good either. Give us a call when you want to talk to us.
0330118|LMP|Good morning to you.
0330155|LMP|How's everything look, Bob?
0330208|CC|You guys look absolutely super. No problem at all.
0330215|LMP|Nice way to wake up. Maybe we'll just sleep in for a few more hours.
0330222|CC|Stand by. I'll check on that.
0330224|LMP|(Laughter).
0332109|LMP|Bob, 17. How do you read?
0332112|CC|17, this is Gordo. Bob just finished up his workday with that last call, and I'll be on now.
0333124|LMP|Houston, 17. How do you read?
0333127|CC|Loud and clear, Jack.
0333131|LMP|Good morning, Gordy. How you doing?
0333133|CC|Real good. How about you?
0333137|LMP|We all feel pretty good this morning. Got some reports for you.
0333142|CC|Okay. Ready to copy.
0333145|LMP|Okay, on the CDR. PRD is 17025; 6-1/2 hours good sleep. One Seconal, which is the one I reported last night, so that's just one now. Had a - yesterday, midday or so - he had a nausea pill for gas. And we hadn't found the other gas pill, so he tried that one. And he drank, since I last reported, two and a half containers of water.
0333232|CC|Roger.
0333237|LMP|The CDR food intake, as with all of us, is a little bit random, and I don't know exactly the best way to report it, unless you want it all in detail.
0333254|CC|Let me check while you - Go on, and I'll see if they want a detailed description of the food or not.
0333313|LMP|Okay. LMP medical. PRD 24036; 5-1/2 to 6 hours good sleep, 1 intermittent. Again, I had a Seconal but that's the same Seconal I mentioned last night. And since last report - I guess one - two and a half containers of fluid. Water.
0333353|CC|Okay.
0333356|LMP|And just for checking on the water intake, you should have me down for six containers of water.
0333405|CC|Roger. Six total.
0333409|LMP|That's affirm.
0333420|LMP|CMP medical. PRD is 15023; 7-1/2 hours very good sleep. He had the same Seconal we had. And, since last report, has three water containers for a total of six now.
0333445|CC|Roger.
0333457|CC|Jack, I guess we do want an accounting of all the food. Whatever you think is the best way to report it.
0333520|LMP|Okay, Gordy. Back on the CDR, and I'll just tell you what we ate. For the day 2. CDR: mixed fruit, that's the can, instant breakfast, one vitamin pill, a bag of tea, turkey and gravy, the wet pack, and orange juice.
0333601|CC|Roger.
0333607|LMP|Okay, The LMP: cinnamon toast bread, mixed fruit, instant breakfast, coffee, lemonade, peach ambrosia, one vitamin, one slice of bread, grapefruit drink, gingerbread, orange drink. And I have one complaint: somebody slighted me on a caramel candy in meal C.
0333650|CC|Roger. We'll start an investigation.
0333654|LMP|Yes, it was not there. Okay. CMP: the spiced oat cereal, mixed fruit, instant breakfast, and coffee, potato soup, and peach ambrosia. That's all for breakfast. And then later on, he had chocolate pudding and a grape drink. And let's see - we all - You might log him for a vitamin pill and me for a vitamin pill.
0333727|CC|Okay.
0333730|LMP|Oh, yes, I forgot. It's here; one frankfurter, for lunch.
0333736|CC|Roger.
0333744|LMP|And we just changed LiOH canister as per the Flight Plan.
0333749|CC|Okay.
0333754|LMP|And in a minute, I'll have weather report for you.
0333758|CC|Very well.
0334059|LMP|Hey, Gordy.
0334101|CC|Go ahead.
0334104|LMP|Gordy, the null bias check. Plus 0.9 and 100 seconds.
0334111|CC|Okay, one question G&C had. Do you do that null bias at plus 100 or minus 100 on the EMS counter?
0334123|CMP|Plus 100.
0334125|CC|Okay, and it's increased up to 101.9, right?
0334132|CMP|No, it increased to 100.9.
0334136|CC|Roger. Miscopied you; 0.9. Okay; thank you.
0334140|CMP|Yes, okay. Seems to me like last night it was 100.7.
0334148|CC|Roger.
0334203|CC|And for our part of the postsleep checklist, I have the consumables status, if you'd care to listen.
0334223|LMP|Stand by, Gordy.
0334517|LMP|Gordy, we'll take your consumables in a second. Let me bring you up to date on the weather around the world, if you're interested.
0334528|CC|Yes, we are; go ahead.
0334531|LMP|Africa, looks in pretty good shape. There is a - except for an area probably around Zambia and Rhodesia in the tropical convergence zone there, where it looks pretty cloudy and probably quite rainy. There's a very strong circulation pattern and presumably a storm off - just off the coast of northwest Africa. Very spectacular spiral formation of clouds in a cyclone development. It looks like there are probably two fairly weak cyclones - Southern Hemisphere cyclones in the South Atlantic. One, southwest of Cape of Good Hope, and the other about due west of - of the Falkland islands, maybe a little bit north of that. South America looks to be in quite good shape weatherwise, except possibly Uruguay and maybe northern Argentina which appear to have a - at least some fairly thick clouds there, although no strong circulation associated with this.
0334803|CC|Okay, Jack. We got all that up to Argentina, then the OMNI switch kind of cut you off.
0334859|CC|Jack, we got the - at least the first part of your weather report fine up through the clouds in northern Argentina, and then the switch in OMNIs cut you out.
0334912|LMP|Okay, that was about it, Gordy. That's - I'll talk to you some more later about it. I guess the main thing I need now is - are your consumables.
0334926|CC|Okay. By the way, you were looking back from more than halfway to the Moon. You're about 125,000 out now. On the consumables, the RCS is running at 1.3 percent over the Flight Plan line. On the O2 tanks 2 and 3 are right on the lines, and tank 1 is about 4 percent below the line. But it's been there all the way since launch, that same bias on tank 1. On the hydrogen: tanks 1 and 3 are right on the lines, tank 2 is about 3 percent above the line. All in all, you're looking real good consumablewise.
0335021|LMP|Okay. That's hardly worth writing down, I guess.
0335026|CMP|That's the way we like to see it.
0335030|CC|Same here.
0335041|CC|Oh, the only other thing I have in the way of updates is a PIPA bias update. You can load it yourself, or we can load it when we come up with the up-link prior to the burn. Your choice. And then we'll have an update to the erasable load update and a supplement to correspond with that bias update.
0335104|CDR|Gordy, why don't you go ahead and load it yourself when you send up the vector?
0335111|CC|Okay, and I'll give you that update for the supplement. It's on 1-43 whenever you're - whenever it's convenient.
0335123|CDR|Okay, Jack's getting that out. I ran another PIPA bias at minus 100, and it confirmed the first one. It ended up at 99.2.
0335136|CC|Roger.
0335141|LMP|Go ahead with your update on 1-43, Gordy.
0335145|CC|Okay. It's in the load A of the octal ID of 03, which now reads 77252. Change that to 77655.
0335233|LMP|Did you copy, Gordy?
0335234|CC|I didn't copy your readback; no.
0335239|LMP|Okay, 306 03 and Alfa 77655.
0335244|CC|That's right.
0340319|LMP|Gordy, how do you read?
0340324|CC|Loud and clear.
0340328|LMP|Okay. For the reference on - on those menus, at least for the LMP, I think I'm probably putting 8 or 9 ounces of water in the citrus drinks and those kind of things, rather than 7, which has probably upped my water intake some.
0340347|CC|Okay.
0340347|LMP|And I think that probably goes for everybody. That probably goes for - it goes for Ron and probably Gene also.
0340354|CC|Roger.
0341007|CC|17, Houston. I have a little synopsis of the news here, if you'd like to listen during breakfast. Let me know.
0341016|CMP|Okay, mighty fine. Send it up.
0341019|CC|Okay, front page first. In Paris, Henry Kissinger met for 30 minutes this morning with French President George Pompidou at the Elysee Palace just hours before his scheduled conference with North Vietnamese Politburo member Le Duc Tho - Tho, that is. North Vietnamese spokesmen accused Kissinger of attempting to force a peace settlement by threatening further escalation of the war. As both U.S. and North Vietnamese negotiators expressed disappointment at the continued deadlock, Chief American delegate William J. Porter traveled to Brussels to brief Secretary of State William B. Rogers. Rogers will - will return later today from the NATO Conference of Ministers. This one is datel - date - datelined Brussels. Diplomatic sources indicated today that NATO allies will request negotiations with the Soviet Union and its allies on mutual troop reductions in central Europe. Exploratory talks expected to begin about January 31, with full-scale negotiations to follow sometime next fall. In Kansas City, vital life signs for Harry S. Truman appear to have stabilized. But the 88-year-old former President remains on the critical list at Kansas City's Research Hospital. Truman is suffering from lung congestion and heart weakness. In Argentina, aides to popular Argentine politician Juan Peron said that Peron will refuse the nomination to the presidency of Argentina and will return to exile during the coming week. And, on the sports page, Rice coach Al Conover is expected to reveal today - sometime today his decision to either remain at Rice as head coach or move to his alma mater, Wake Forest in a similar position. The Owl head coach has said that he has been offered the job and promises a yes-or-no decision today. There is some speculation that head coach Joe Paterno of Penn State may move to a head coaching job in the pros next year. Paterno is busy preparing his Nittany Lions for a Sugar Bowl meeting with Oklahoma and is refusing to discuss the matter until after the game. Locally, the state high school football playoffs - -
0341248|CMP|Lost you, Gordo.
0341251|CC|Say again?
0341428|CC|Okay, 17. Continuing after being rudely interrupted by the OMNI switch, the state high school football playoffs here in Texas are underway and with a whole host of games scheduled this weekend. And the final item, the Major League Baseball Players' Association and the Commissioner's Office are going at it again. It must be getting close to spring training time.
0341453|LMP|Gordy, you cut out since the Nittany Lions.
0341503|CC|Okay. Did you hear about the - the high school playoffs?
0341509|LMP|No, the last we heard was the Nittany Lions.
0341513|CC|Okay. (Laughter) Paterno, the head coach at Penn State, may move to a head coaching job in the pros next year. He's busy setting up his Nittany Lions for a Sugar Bowl meeting with Oklahoma and is refusing to discuss the matter until after the game. Here locally, the state high school football players are - playoffs are underway with a whole host of games scheduled for this weekend. And the final item, the - the Major League Baseball Players Association and the Commissioner's Office are going at it again, which means it must be getting close to time for spring training.
0341602|LMP|No editorials, please (laughter).
0342928|LMP|Gordy, film update on mag November November. I'm on frame 138, and that includes a couple of pictures I mentioned to Bob I took just before I went to sleep. And also, two pictures this morning at about 33:30. Those are the Earth.
0342953|CC|Okay, Jack.
0343520|CC|17, Houston. A reminder. We need the H2 PURGE LINE HEATERS, ON, now. And I do have a maneuver pad for the midcourse when you're ready to copy. Over.
0343536|LMP|Okay. I've already got the HEATER, ON. And give me about 5 minutes, and I'll get the pad.
0343543|CC|Okay. And if you'll give us ACCEPT and P00, we'll get the up-link started just after the next antenna switch. We want to catch it between switches. Over.
0343557|LMP|Okay. You got P00 and ACCEPT.
0343600|CC|Thank you.
0344619|CC|17, it's your computer. You have a state vector, VERB 66, and a target load, and a PIPA bias update.
0344627|LMP|Very good.
0344949|LMP|Believe it or not, Gordy, I'm ready for your pad.
0344954|CC|Okay, Jack. It's a midcourse 2, SPS/G&N; the weight is 66786; plus 1.21, minus 0.13; ignition time is 035:29:59.09; minus 0003.4, plus 0002.1, minus 0009.8; attitude is 132, 194, 343; HA and HP are NA; DELTA-Vt 0010.6, burn time is 0:02, 0006.5; sextant star is 25, 233.7, 16.4; rest of the pad is NA. Ullage, none. Other remarks; LM weight, 36281. High gain angles: PITCH, minus 21; YAW, 181. And this will give you a perilune of 53.1. Should make everybody onboard feel a little more comfortable. Over.
0345159|LMP|Okay, Gordy. We haven't been particularly uncomfortable, but knowing no way we would hit the Moon. Here's MCC-2, 7 - SPS/G&N; 66786; plus 1.21, minus 0.13; 035:29:59.09; minus 0003.4, plus 0002.1 And you cut out on DELTA-Vz. Give me that again, please.
0345234|CC|Okay. DELTA-Vz is a minus 0009.8.
0345245|LMP|Okay. DELTA-Vz, minus 0009.8; 132, 194, 343; NOUN 44 is NA; 0010.6, 0:02, 0006.5; 25, 233.7, 16.4; rest of pad is NA. No ullage. LM weight, 36281. High gain PITCH, minus 21; YAW, 181. Perilune, 53.1.
0345323|CC|Okay. That's a good readback.
0345421|CC|17, Houston. You can go back to BLOCK now.
0345433|CMP|Okay. We're in BLOCK.
0345516|CC|Jack, a couple of quick items. We would like for you to terminate the BATTERY A charge now, and also turn the H2 tank HEATERS for tanks 1 and 2 OFF.
0345534|LMP|Okay. H2 tank HEATERS 1 and 2 are OFF, and I'll terminate the charge.
0345539|CC|Roger.
0345816|PAO|This is Apollo Control 34 hours, 58 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 17 spacecraft, should at this time be coming out of the passive thermal-control mode and getting into the proper attitude for the midcourse correction burn #2, which is some 31 minutes and 23 seconds from now. Apollo 17, presently 126,988 miles from the Earth traveling at velocity of 4,098 feet per second. The midcourse correction burn #2 with an ignition time 35:29:59.1 has a velocity change in the posigrade direction of 10.6 feet per second, which for the service propulsion system engine is a BURP lasting 1.58 seconds. Purpose of this burn is to raise the pericynthion from an impact trajectory as it stands now, to one with a clearance over the Moon of some 53 nautical miles which will become the pericynthion of Lunar Orbit. Standing by on air-ground 1 at 34:59 this is Apollo Control.
0350254|CDR|Okay, Gordo, there's all balls and 05 on that P52 .
0350304|CC|Roger. That looks good.
0350305|CDR|And you're looking at NOUN 93. Okay, you're looking at NOUN 93.
0350327|CC|Okay, and we GO to torque it.
0350406|CMP|Houston, Apollo 17. When we ran the DELTA-V test, we - we're reading minus 22.2 and I'm having a little trouble finding the SPS cue card. Wonder if FAO know exactly - knows exactly where that is?
0350423|CC|Stand by; I'll check.
0350709|LMP|Houston, if you saw a MASTER ALARM, it was the POWER SCE NORMAL switch getting hooked to OFF.
0350720|CC|Roger.
0350733|CC|As far as we know, the SPS burn card ought to be in with the rest of the cards in R-2.
0350741|LMP|Gordy, we finally found that thing. It was way back in the back; sorry.
0350745|CC|Okay.
0350823|LMP|We're starting our purges, Houston.
0350827|CC|Roger.
0351451|CMP|Okay, Houston, We'll get to the attitude in about another 4 minutes or so. Then we'll whip in the P30 and go right into P40. We're doing a waste water dump, urine dump, and - man, the sky is just full of little bitty particles.
0351512|CC|Roger, Ron.
0351554|CMP|Hey, I doubt if we can get the star sextant check, but you can try it.
0351847|CMP|Okay. Okay, 35:29:59:09 for the time. NOUN 81 - okay, NOUN 81s are loaded good.
0351910|CMP|Just the burn time's good.
0351944|CMP|Okay. We'll see if we can get the DET started here.
0352004|CMP|Okay; got the DET started.
0352007|CC|Jack, you can bring up the high gain any time now.
0352010|CMP|In 10 minutes, Jack so we're in good shape. Okay, got that. ...
0352027|CMP|Yes, he's dumping waste water. It's about 15. Yes. Yes, straight up to RELIEF, Jack.
0352040|CC|And, Jack, also we're showing 10 percent on waste water, now.
0352044|CMP|... 786, LM weight. Okay, ..., OFF; ..., OFF. That's what I'm doing now. To what? One three, okay. Here we go. Set ... IMU. Okay. Realign the old GDC a little bit.
0352145|CMP|Okay, GDC is aligned. STAB control breakers. All IN and good shape.
0352154|CMP|MANUAL ATTs are RATE COMMAND; DEADBAND, MIN; RATE to LOW. Yes.
0352206|CMP|Okay, TVC is in RATE COMMAND. LM/CSM is in LM/CSM. GIMBAL DRIVE is in AUTO. Okay.
0352214|CC|Jack, this is Houston. We're ready for the high gain.
0352221|CMP|(Laughter)
0352233|CC|17, Houston. Do you read?
0352242|CMP|I think there's no trim on this ... Flight Plan.
0352249|CMP|Okay.
0352254|CC|Apollo 17, Houston. How do you copy?
0352257|CMP|Okay, so that's ... trim, to 0.2.
0352307|CMP|No trim if it's greater than 2 feet per second.
0352324|CMP|Yes, we're down to 6 minutes.
0352330|CC|Apollo 17, Houston. How do you read?
0352335|CMP|Okay, Gordo. We got you.
0352338|CC|Okay, we weren't getting through there for a minute or 2. We're ready for the high gain now.
0352354|CMP|Okay. Minus - minus 21 and 181.
0352406|CC|And 17, You're GO for midcourse 2.
0352412|CMP|Okay. Sounds good.
0352419|CMP|And, Jack, you ready for GIMBAL MOTORS? - I mean the BUS TIES?
0352427|CMP|Ready for the BUS TIES.

0352816|CMP|Okay, cycle to ..., MIN, RATE to HIGH, DIRECT, CMC AUTO; uncaged, RATE COMMAND, GIMBAL MOTORS, LM/CSM and GIM - AUTO.
0352831|CDR|Okay, Houston. 01:30 and we're GO onboard for the burn.
0352835|CC|Roger.
0352838|CMP|Okay, Houston. No ullage.
0352844|CDR|Houston - Houston, I'm sure you've seen it. We're reading below the green band oxidizer pressure, about 163.
0352855|CC|Roger.
0352900|CMP|(Singing) Okay. Let's wait until 30 seconds and
0352909|CMP|CONTROL POWER is ON. ... DELTA-V THRUST A switch. Get it and EMS at 30 seconds. Ullage - no ullage.
0352929|CDR|You're in average G.
0352930|CMP|Okay, average G is coming. EMS to NORMAL. DELTA-V THRUST A is ON. Okay, no manuals to it. You'll get the 99 - Okay?
0352952|CMP|10 seconds, Houston.
0352954|CC|Roger.
0353000|CMP|99.
0353003|CMP|Uh-hoo! There we go. Lift-off!
0353005|CDR|Okay. The burn is on time and - au - auto shutdown
0353008|CC|Roger.
0353010|CMP|Okay. Let's see what kind of trim we got. Yes, we trimmed it. Trimmed it to 0.2. Yes. Less than 2. Okay, plus 7 on the EMS.
0353023|CC|Roger - -
0353024|CMP|I mean on the R-l. (Laughter)
0353030|CMP|Okay, we'll trim it out to 2. Plus 0.3. One more chance. Okay, there we go.
0353043|CDR|Okay, Houston. You're looking at NOUN 85, and the EMS is minus 3.3.
0353049|CC|Roger, Gene.
0353050|CMP|Okay, gimbal motors check. Two -
0353054|CMP|MARK it. Two -
0353056|CMP|MARK it. One -
0353059|CMP|MARK it. One -
0353102|CMP|MARK it.
0353105|CMP|Okay. SERVO POWER is OFF.
0353110|CMP|TRANS CONTROL POWER and DIRECTS are OFF.
0353115|CMP|DELTA-V circuit breakers are OPEN. Hey, we just caught up with all the particles. They're all going with us now.
0353134|CMP|Okay, DIRECTS are OFF. PITCH and YAW. PITCH 1, YAW 1 are OPENED. Okay, you got the DELTA-V counter?
0353158|CMP|Okay. BMAGs are caged. BUS TIES, JACK?
0353223|CMP|Okay. BUS TIES are OFF. BIT RATE to LOW, while you're up there.
0353258|CMP|That shouldn't change, I don't think; should it?
0353304|CMP|Okay.
0353322|CDR|Houston, America.
0353323|CC|Go ahead.
0353332|CDR|Okay, the burn was on time. Looked like it was about 2 seconds. DELTA-Vx was 0,7. ROLL was 132, PITCH was 193, and YAW was 342. Residuals after trim were zero - plus 0.1, zero, and minus 0.1, and DELTA-Vc, is minus 3.3. OX 007. FUEL is 009 and DECREASE 50.
0353409|CC|Roger.
0353457|CMP|PAN CAMERA'S OFF. MAPPING CAMERA's OFF, huh? And SM/AC POWER will be coming OFF, shortly.
0353553|CMP|You know, Houston, we must of caught up with every one of those particles. Because we're right in the middle of them. They're going kind of in a random fashion. Most of them are drifting right along with us. Some of them are going against us and away from us. But before we did the burn - you know, the propulsion, they got out of the vent. Sent them all away from us in what looked like - in more or less the X-direction.
0353621|CC|How about that.
0353626|CMP|... we really got a star field out there now (laughter).
0353630|CC|Roger.
0353631|CDR|Say, Gordy, the LM/CM DELTA-P is 1 - That's 1.0. You want me to go to TUNNEL VENT?
0353641|CC|Stand by.
0353657|CC|Yes, that's affirmative, Geno. You have a GO for TUNNEL VENT valve, VENT.
0353703|CDR|Okay.
0354109|CC|17, Houston.
0354115|CMP|Roger. Go ahead.
0354116|CC|Okay, we do want to put BATTERY A back on CHARGE as shown in the Flight Plan. And, also, I have a new flyby pad. No hurry on this one, but it's a flyby pad post MCC-2.
0354135|CDR|Okay, Gordo, how quickly should this tunnel vent?
0354141|CC|Let me get a reading on that.
0354212|CC|Geno, that should take about an hour. We'll try to remember to occasionally remind you to look at it.
0354223|CDR|Okay. I'm glad you said that because I don't see any indication of it moving here yet, at all.
0354229|CC|Roger.
0354344|LMP|Houston, 17-
0354346|CC|Go ahead.
0354349|LMP|Never got to give you a 7-Alfa reading on a - after the last charge. It was 0.6 - decimal 6 as before.
0354404|CC|Okay. Ed Mitchell - Ed Mitchell must be working now. I was just about to ask you for that. And for Geno, one reminder, you will have to switch back to LM/CM DELTA-P in order to read the DELTA-P. Over.
0354425|CDR|Yes, Gordo, I'm - I'm aware of that, and I've done it. But in the about 3 or 4 minutes that I vented, I didn't see any change yet.
0354433|CC|Okay. It's a pretty slow process.
0354632|LMP|Okay, Gordy, battery A is being charged.
0354637|CC|Roger, Jack.
0354644|LMP|And I checked that 7-Alfa in the VENT position, and it's 0.6 also.
0354655|CC|Okay.
0355218|CMP|Okay, Houston. How's the CMP's "zippen" or ZPN?
0355226|CC|Let me take a check to my left here.
0355230|CMP|I'll take a deep breath for you.
0355432|CC|Okay, Ron. Your ZPN looks good.
0355439|CMP|Okay, I don't have the other one on yet. But I was a little bit curious because I left the electrodes in this thing, and - you know, the little sponges, I left those inside the electrodes, but they stuck to - to the back of the electrodes and kind of corroded the inside of it there a little bit.
0355459|CC|Evidently, it's working okay.
0355503|CMP|Okay, mighty fine.
0355507|CMP|I'll put some new ones in.
0360747|CMP|Okay, Houston, is my heart beating?
0360753|CC|I'm sure it is, Ron, but I'll check to my left.
0360759|CMP|Okay.
0360808|CC|We'll wait a couple of minutes. It takes that long to settle down and give you a reading on it.
0360814|CMP|Okay. No problem.
0360917|CC|Ron, your EKG looks real good.
0360924|CMP|Okay. Thank you much.
0360928|CMP|That's all new, what you call it - those sponges and stuff, you know. And, Houston, I'm not - I'm not putting - putting any cover tape on it, so if it quits - you know, comes loose or something like that, well, let me know and I'll push it on again.
0360953|CC|Okay, will do.
0361055|LMP|You might make a note that Dr. Evans was assisted in that operation by Dr. Schmitt,
0361101|CC|Roger, Doctor.
0361109|CC|Jack, I've still got this flyby pad standing by.
0361117|LMP|Nag, nag, nag.
0361129|CMP|Can't talk with a mouthful of bread cubes, it all comes out.
0361134|LMP|Okay, what kind of pad you want to give me? Flyby, right?
0361138|CC|Right. A regular maneuver pad.
0361149|LMP|Okay, and I guess the other one I can cross out, right?
0361153|CC|That's affirmative. That's obsolete now that you've done midcourse 2.
0361212|LMP|Okay, Gordy, I'm all set.
0361214|CC|Okay, it's a flyby. SPS/G&N; 66678; plus 1.21, minus 0.13. Ignition time is 081:14:43.49; plus 0043.3, plus 0211.8, plus 0453.2. Attitude is 128, 146, 317; Ha is NA. Hp is plus 0021.1. DELTA-Vt is 0502.1. Burn time, 1:18, 0497.6. Sextant star is 25, 189.3 27.4. Boresight star is NA. NOUN 61 is a plus 15.60, minus 175.00; 1101.6, 36242. GET of 05G is 153:24:03 - GDC stars are Sirius and Rigel; 256; 152; 069. Ullage, none. Remarks: 1, burn docked; and number 2, assumes PTC REFSMMAT. And that's it. Over.
0361456|LMP|Okay, Gordy. Here's your readback. Flyby, SPS/G&N; 66678; plus 1.21, minus 0.13; 081:14:43.49; plus 0043.3, plus 0211.8, plus 0453.2; 128, 146, 317. Ha is NA. Plus 0021.1; 0502.1, 1:18, 0497.6; 25, 189.3, 27.4. Boresight, NA. Plus 15.60, minus 175.00; 1101.6, 36242; 153:24:03 - Sirius and Rigel; 256; 152; 069. There's no ullage. Remark 1, burn docked - docked; and 2, PC - PTC REFSMMAT is assumed.
0361616|CC|Okay, that's a good readback.
0361755|CDR|Gordy, I might mention for future reference that we've established a new list of consumables, or at least added it to the old one. Now includes gray tape and tissues.
0361807|CC|Okay, you want us to track those?
0361812|CDR|It might help. We have a heck of a time finding them in here.
0361816|CC|Roger.
0361820|LMP|Oh, you meant quantity-wise.
0361825|CC|Yes, we'll set up in a special back room.
0361833|CDR|We could call it the T-T room. Tissue and tape, of course.
0361839|CC|Rog.
0363441|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 36 hours, 34 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 17, 130,714 nautical miles out from Earth, velocity now, 3,985 feet per second, continuing to decelerate as we approach the so-called cross over between the sphere of influence from Earth to Moon. I can't recall ever seeing two pages of a flight plan as blank as these are, from 36 hours to 38 hours. Later on today, the - after the eat-period the crew will crawl through the hatch into the Lunar Module for some housekeeping chores, checking out of stowage of equipment in the Lunar Module. But the most exciting thing going on now, was the checkout of the Bio-medical harness on the Command Module Pilot. Midcourse correction burn went nominally on time. The velocity just at time of ignition was 4,058 feet per second. It jumped approximately 10 feet since there was a 10-foot per second burn. But then, within a few minutes it was down below the original velocity as the spacecraft continues to decelerate. Altitude at the time of burn, or distance from Earth, was 128,217. We show a pericynthion of 52.09 miles at closest approach after the burn. And standing by at 36:36, this is Apollo Control.
0364207|CC|Apollo 17, Houston. It's been about an hour, you might check the LM Command Module Delta-P again.
0364216|CMP|Okay; thank you. We'll do that.
0364313|CDR|It's 2.2, Gordo; I put it back in VENT.
0364317|CC|Okay.
0370019|CDR|Hello, Houston; America.
0370023|CC|Roger, America. Go ahead.
0370026|CDR|Okay, Gordo. We're up to 2.5 on the tunnel and still venting.
0370033|CC|Okay. is that music we hear in the background?
0370040|CDR|Yes, sir. (Music: Up, Up, and Away by Brazil '66)
0370053|LMP|They've been making fun of some of my music. ...
0370059|CC|Yes, it's coming down to us in living stereo.
0370105|CDR|Reminiscent of yesteryear. (Music: Up, Up, and Away by Brazil '66).
0370243|CDR|Music from America.
0370246|CC|Roger. Thank you for the concert. That was very appropriate.
0371007|CDR|Gordo, Ron went off the air for a minute, and LM DELTA-P is now 2.6.
0371015|CC|Okay, Gene.
0371033|CC|Geno, we'd like for you to let it get up to 2.8 before closing off the VENT.
0371039|CDR|(Music) Okay, Gordo. We'll make it 2.8.
0371045|CC|Roger.
0372042|CC|America, Houston. That was a sight handover, the reason we lost signal for a second there.
0372048|LMP|Okay.
0373247|LMP|Houston, 17-
0373249|CC|Go ahead.
0373253|LMP|Say, are we going to have a pretty good view of the Earth out of any CSM windows at the LM checkout attitude?
0373302|CC|I'll check on that.
0373303|LMP|We're sort of blocked right now.
0373305|CC|Roger.
0374231|CC|America, Houston. We're predicting that your LM/CM DELTA-P ought to be about right now, about 2.8.
0374241|LMP|Okay.
0374245|CC|We would like a reading -
0374245|LMP|We'll check it.
0374314|CDR|Gordo, 2.9.
0374318|CC|Okay. Sounds good.
0374416|LMP| ...
0374430|LMP|Gordy, the reason I asked about that view of the Earth, we were sort of thinking maybe we might go early, if it was all right with you, and watch the Earth a little bit more.
0374445|CC|Okay. We're still trying to get the answer on whether you'll have a window. Stand by. I might have it here.
0375005|CC|America, Houston.
0375009|LMP|Go ahead.
0375011|CC|Okay. The LM inspection attitude that you'll go to results in kind of a marginal view of the Earth out of window 1, about 60 degrees away from it, bore-sight line of sight. And we're - we can - we've started to work on and if you wanted to do is you can go to kind of intermediate attitude, which will be the LM attitude except for roll which will be off by about 60 degrees, which will - will give you a good view of the Earth out of window 1. And then when we get ready to do the LM entry, you can roll that additional 60 degrees to get to the proper attitude, if you wish. Your choice. Over.
0375058|LMP|Yes, if that doesn't bother anybody down there, we'd like to do that.
0375103|CC|Okay. We'll have something for you here in a few minutes.
0375400|CC|Okay. If you're ready to copy, I have a VERB 49 maneuver for you that will let you look at the Earth.
0375411|CMP|Wait a minute, Gordo, and I'll just let you load it as we go here.
0375415|CC|All right.
0375427|CMP|Okay; ready to copy.
0375429|CC|Okay. Roll is 240, pitch is 089, and yaw is 0. And the high gain for that attitude, we think it'll probably track to this attitude, is plus 29 and 27.
0375457|CMP|Okay. Plus 29 and 27.
0375500|CC|Roger.
0375918|CC|America, Houston. Until you get the attitude, OMNI Charlie will probably work better.
0375935|LMP|Okay, Gordy. We got you OMNI Charlie now.
0375937|CC|Okay; loud and clear.
0380515|LMP|Gordy, for your information we have our LM transfer items in the jettison bag ready to go over and we're pretty well squared away on the, all the command module stowage now with minor exceptions.
0380529|CC|Okay.
0381302|CC|America, Houston. We'd like you to go ahead and get on the high gain again since - and stop it just wandering around aimlessly. And how does the Earth look now?
0381330|LMP|Sorry, Gordy, to be so slow. Earth looks great, and we'll get the high gain up in just a second.
0381336|CC|Okay.
0381931|LMP|Houston, 17. How do you read?
0381935|CC|Go ahead. You're loud and clear.
0381940|LMP|Okay, Gordy, going from south to north on noontime, at least our noontime weather, it looks like there is a fairly strong mass of polar air moving from the southwest up towards Tierra del Fuego. It's mixed with some cloudiness that extends from that area all the way down to the Antarctic ice shelf. But it looks like some pretty good movement patterns from the southwest, north - northeast. No strong weather waves or cyclone development on that yet, although one may be picking up about halfway between Tierra del Fuego and the coast of Antarctica, the - where the front, or at least the cloud masses, curve from the east-west direction to an almost due south direction. Most of South America still looks like pretty good weather. There is cloudiness along the Andean Ridge and also in the Amazon Basin, stretching from the eastern coast of South America on up about, oh, two-thirds of the way towards Central America. It doesn't look like frontal weather there. It's probably tropical convergence weather. Now there is this - still this small, moderately developed cyclone pattern that's hanging pretty much over Buenos Aires now, I think. Uruguay and Buenos Aires. I think I mentioned that earlier in the day. And that still is there, and I suspect those folks are getting a fair amount of weather out of it.
0382154|CC|Roger.
0382200|LMP|Except for scattered clouds, Central America and Mexico, for the most part, are clear - as is most of the Caribbean islands - Cuba and the others are - all look like they've pretty good weather. There's a little clouds off - cloud pattern off to the east of those islands, but it doesn't look like any major weather in that area. The eastern half and Midwest of the United States is completely cloud covered right now. There - however, the - extending from Mexico to Sonora and up into Arizona and New Mexico, and possibly as far north as Colorado, is a clear band. But then there is more cloudiness to the north of that. The Pacific regions west of - The West Coast of the United States is cloudy, at least west of Southern California. I cannot see Baja, so that cloudiness extends down south of - into Baja California. I see no strong new frontal patterns, although I'm looking right across the limb at the Earth now. There may be one that would be lying maybe across northern California and - and into Colorado, with a little clear area ahead of it, possibly in Kansas. But then into this, a solid bank of clouds that stretches from Brownsville, at least, clear up to - well, along the Gulf Coast across the panhandle of Florida, up the East Coast and on out past Nova Scotia, I'm sure. Florida is clear. Florida - the peninsular portion of Florida is - it looks very clear and some of the deep turquoise green waters to the south and southeast of that area are - are very obvious at this time.
0382442|CC|Roger, Jack. I'm following along on the satellite weather picture here that's taken from about your same vantage point and - although nowhere near the detail that you're describing.
0382505|LMP|Have you seen today's analysis charts of the United States or North America?
0382511|CC|No, I haven't. I was just told, Jack, that the - the weathermen and a lot of other people around here, too, are following your weather reports with great interest.
0382540|LMP|Yes. Does that mean they're right or wrong?
0382547|CC|You've got the better view, by far.
0382552|LMP|That doesn't prove much. Okay, Gordy, I'm - I suspect that that's a pretty healthy front. I don't know. Your weather must be cloudy and bad today. is that right?
0382604|CC|It is. We've got about a half-mile vis and drizzly rain.
0382611|LMP|Okay. Well, I suspect comparable weather extends all the way across the eastern United States. That looks like awful dense clouds, although there's no obvious frontal pattern. It just stretches from the Midwest to the East Coast. And, also, there's no good indication of stratification of those clouds, as if they'd be fairly - fairly thick up into the cirrus levels.
0382651|CC|Roger, Jack.
0382652|LMP|Looks like Arizona, New Mexico, and northern Sonora probably have some - one band of high cirrus. But other than that, probably a beautiful day out in that area.
0382719|LMP|There's some transverse cloud patterns over the Mississippi-Alabama area. It suggests maybe that the Jetstream may be just north of that region. But otherwise, there's no good indication of Jetstream position right now.
0382742|CC|Roger.
0382911|LMP|Gordy, there is one minor weather disturbance, possibly just about over Puerto Rico or maybe just -just to the east of that island. No strong circulation patterns, although there's a hint of a cyclone development. There might be just a small depression in that area. I don't know whether your maps are carrying anything down there or not.
0382945|CC|I think I see what you're talking about on the satellite picture, but I don't have a surface analysis that goes that far. I do - I just now got a copy of the surface charts for the United States. And there's - there's a front stretching from northern Texas northeastward up through Tennessee and Virginia and another one sort of parallel to it. But, this way southward from Louisiana along the Gulf Coast across northern Florida and on out into the Atlantic. And I guess the two are kind of blending together to make that irregular mass of clouds you mentioned.
0383031|LMP|Okay, Gordy. If I'd been a little more observant I could see that there was a little bit, looks like a decrease in at least the thickness of the clouds, vertical thickness, between the two areas you just mentioned. So, there is some indication here of those two fronts, although they are contributing to a general weather pattern in the eastern United States.
0383059|CC|Roger.
0383107|LMP|I think, with a little experience in this business, you might have picked those two out of that mass. But it's not immediately obvious.
0383115|CC|Roger.
0383123|LMP|You got anything on there coming in from the northwest now, say up in Wyoming and Colorado?
0383138|CC|The way it's drawn on this surface charts shows that - that northern front that I mentioned, just now, sort of curving on up through central Colorado, and then bending westward toward - through Utah. That's about the only other frontal activity. There's one, probably dry front, then a short one through central Arizona and southern Utah.
0383215|LMP|Okay. Well, that makes sense. That would match with that - what I was thinking was high cirrus in Arizona. And also I can see how you could bend - that's the northern front up through Colorado and then back westward to explain the patterns we're seeing in the clear areas south of that.
0383238|CC|Roger.
0383304|LMP|Gordy, the zero-phase point now is off the coast of Chile and Ecuador - oh, maybe 10 or 15 degrees of longitude, and it is fairly dull. It does not seem to indicate any great amount of choppiness or wave action in that area.
0383335|CC|Roger.
0383405|LMP|And about 15 minutes ago, Gordy, I took two more Hasselblad shots of the Earth.
0383414|CC|Okay.
0383429|CMP|And, also, Houston, frame number - let's see, that's 16 and 17 - were taken of the Earth about 15 minutes ago, too. And that's magazine Sierra Sierra.
0383445|CC|Okay, Ron. We copy that.
0383456|LMP|Gordy, with respect to the icepack off the coast of Antarctica, it's difficult to distinguish pack ice from clouds, in general. However, the clouds seem to pick up reflection patterns with respect to the Sun. And using that as a - and some shadows in below as the criteria, it looks as if the pack ice in the South Atlantic would extend to a latitude almost comparable to that of Tierra del Fuego. I don't know whether that - that's reasonable or not.
0383546|CC|Okay. I don't either. But maybe someone who's more of an expert can clear up your question on that. I'll let you know.
0383557|LMP|Now to the southwest of Tierra del Fuego there's a - looks like a small cyclone developing, clockwise rotation, just off the edge of the pack ice, and - but it does not seem to be closely associated with the frontal activity that I mentioned when I started out speaking at this - this particular time.
0383637|CC|Roger,
0383637|LMP|There is another - there is another one, maybe a front, a little bit ahead of that cyclone that's now extending north-south. Starts in the pack ice area and extends up - oh, about halfway from there to Buenos Aires - in the direction of Buenos Aires. It doesn't look like a very major mass of air or frontal system. It may develop into something over the next couple days though.
0383712|CC|Okay.
0383809|LMP|And centered, Gordy, at about 45 south and say 30 west, there is another cyclone area that's ahead of the last front I talked about that doesn't look - I think I talked about it yesterday - still does not look too strong, although the clouds, as I recall, the cloud cover is somewhat more well developed, and circulation patterns seem to be better developed. It may be an intensifying storm over what we saw yesterday.
0383847|CC|Roger.
0383852|LMP|I cannot see that it's associated with any clear frontal activity, however.
0383858|CC|Okay.
0383905|LMP|That, I presume, should be migrating in the direction of the - of the southeast coast of Africa, so we'll keep an eye on it.
0383916|CC|Roger.
0383921|LMP|And that reminds me, did you get any information on the - that - what looked like a very strong, concentrated typhoon or hurricane in the South Pacific between Borneo and the Philippines?
0383945|CC|Let me check and see what we got on that. I wasn't here when you first talked about it evidently.
0383951|LMP|Well, it was one that they didn't seem to be carrying, and it looked extremely well developed from here.
0384035|LMP|Gordy, yesterday that - the one I'm speaking of - was centered at about 15 north and a hundred and - make that about 117 east.
0384057|CC|Okay. I've been informed that they are - the satellite people are carrying that one now. I'm not sure whether they had seen it before or didn't see it until after you did. But they are aware of it now and are tracking it.
0384119|LMP|Well, we're not competing. They just didn't have any information for me on it yesterday. We'll probably be able to see that again late this afternoon.
0384139|CC|Okay. The one that you just gave the coordinates on is - does have a name, - that's Therese, Hurricane Therese. And - so the - the other one must be the - must not have the name.
0384205|LMP|Okay. Now which one has - is Therese.
0384210|CC|The one you just - the coordinates you gave almost exactly pinpoint Therese.
0384217|LMP|Okay. That's near the Philippines.
0384219|CC|That's affirmative. Between there and Vietnam,
0384239|LMP|Okay. Well, then that sounds like - if that's an up-to-date position, it has relatively little movement since yesterday.
0384252|CC|Roger. They show it moving just very slightly westward.
0384300|LMP|Okay. Are they carrying anything south of Guam now that we talked about yesterday?
0384332|CC|Take a minute to get something on that. They don't have a current map showing anything in Guam right now.
0384346|LMP|And we also had a storm developing south of - or southwest of New Zealand. Might look at that one, too.
0384357|CC|Okay.
0384410|CC|Jack, are you making these observations through the monocular?
0384419|LMP|Yes, sir.
0384420|CC|Okay.
0384421|LMP|Although most of them - well, at this distance, Gordy, the circulation - detailed circulation patterns to say what's a cyclone and what isn't are not visible to the naked eye, at least not to mine.
0384436|CC|Roger.
0384438|LMP|The major frontal patterns are, however.
0384649|CC|Jack, that disturbance you mentioned near Guam isn't being carried on the current charts here as anything significant. They do show some cloudiness north of the tropical convergence zone, but just that.
0384708|LMP|Okay. Well, I had a feeling what I was seeing yesterday might have just been the remnants of Teresa [sic], which I think went - got into that area a couple days ago. It was not a very well-developed system, but did seem - seem to be isolated from the other cloudiness that I would have put into the tropical convergence zone. That was between Wake and Kwajalein.
0384738|CC|Roger.
0384904|LMP|Gordy, let me try to give you a description of something that is a little bit unusual than what we've been seeing. The - there's an axis that runs from, say, the outer portion of the Ross ice shelf along the - and just off the coast of Antarctica, then bends up so that it would pass just to the east of Tierra del Fuego and - and then continues on that heading so that it would intersect the far east coast of South America, if it continued. Now along that axis, the - what appear to be multiple frontal patterns or at least linear cloud bands, bend very sharply and change from a heading that roughly parallels the axis around the one that is roughly north-south. And some of the front - frontal direction changes that I gave you earlier, down in that area, are - also bend around that axis.
0385035|CC|Okay.
0385038|LMP|And there just, oh, there are probably a dozen, if you tried to pull them out, cloud bands between the Ross Sea and Tierra del Fuego that bend around the same axis. Quite striking.
0385054|CC|Roger.
0385107|LMP|Now there's some indications, to me at any rate, that the Jetstream in that area may be essentially east-west - oh, maybe 20 degrees of latitude north of the Ross Sea, and then bends down very sharply so that it intersects the - or approaches the coa- Antarctic ice shelf to the east of the Ross Sea, and then maybe it bends up and forms the axis that I just described that's causing that bending of the cloud patterns.
0385155|CC|Okay. Sounds like a good, theory.
0385209|LMP|There's a linear clear area in that area north of the Ross Sea that - and to the north of that is a sharply defined front that I talked about earlier. And then, both the - that front continues. The clear area is cut off by the axis that I described, a cloud axis.
0385236|CC|Roger.
0385236|LMP|Now that should show up real well on the 250-millimeter pictures we took. Gordy, I'm back looking at zero-phase. And now, apparently, the exact zero-phase was partially obscured by a cloud pattern earlier. Now, when I - There is a very, very small bright spot in the center of the zero-phase area. Nothing comparable to what I described off the coast of Australia yesterday, but an extremely small spot. I suspect that the size of your bright spot in zero-phase has some direct - or indirect, at any rate, relationship to sea state.
0385331|CC|Roger.
0385551|LMP|Gordy, as you might expect, the whole coastline of Chile is - or all of Chile, practically, is clear. Beautifully exposed to us here, particular the Atacama Desert, which is noted for that particular characteristic, and - at least among geologists it is. And the coast of Peru is also clear with clouds following the Andean Ridge, probably the - certainly the coast side of the Andean Ridge. Lima ought to be enjoying a very nice day today. The - Ecuador, however, looks like it might have a little more cloudy weather, although it doesn't look like any major storm activity.
0385656|CC|Roger.
0390314|CC|America, Houston. We have a couple of words here on medications. is everyone listening?
0390325|CDR|Yes; we're on, Gordo. Go ahead.
0390327|CC|Okay. Geno, you mentioned taking a nausea pill for some gas yesterday, and we were looking into some of the side effects. You definitely don't want to use that particular pill for gas. One of the side effects is that it's an appetite depressor. And there are some pills loaded in A-7, along with the vitamin pills, specifically for the purpose of eliminating gas. We would appreciate if you'd give us a call in advance prior to taking any medications except the Seconal and aspirin. Over.
0390419|CDR|Okay, Gordy, will do. I was aware that those gas depressors were around. At the time, we couldn't find them in A-7. And so I took one of those other things, whatever it is. And while you're talking about that, as per the preflight food check, gas is very evident on - particularly on me - and I think I'm suppressing it slowly. But is there any problem, or what do you recommend on that Mylinol [sic] or Mylicon or whatever it is?
0390459|CC|Okay. Stand by 1.
0390502|CDR|This goes hand-in-hand with the amount of gas that I experienced preflight.
0390510|CC|Okay.
0390511|CDR|And it's the kind of gas - it's the kind of gas that just stays in your stomach.
0390516|CC|Roger.
0390545|CC|Okay, Geneo. The recommended use of those gas pills is to chew one after each meal. And then, if needed, chew up another one before going to sleep at night.
0390604|CDR|Okay; fine. I chewed one after breakfast.
0390608|CC|Okay. A little water after you chew it up, I guess, helps its effectiveness.
0390615|CDR|That's a basic requirement, I believe. The effect of it has not been too obvious yet though.
0390625|CC|Roger.
0390753|LMP|Gordy, you want the O2 HEATERS 1 and 2 to AUTO now?
0390800|CC|That's affirmative.
0390808|LMP|Okay, They're there.
0390907|CDR|Gordy?
0390910|CC|Go ahead.
0390914|CDR|I don't want to cause any concern on that gas. It's no real great problem. It's just a slight discomfort; that's all.
0390920|CC|Okay, Gene. I think we understand.
0391033|LMP|Gordy, I have just eaten my first peanut butter sandwich in orbit around the Earth.
0391043|CC|Roger. How was it?
0391047|LMP|What's that? Well, it was just as good as it was when I was growing up - which means it was great. I grew up on those things, as I recall.
0391110|CC|Charlie Duke's here with me and he - -
0391111|CMP|Miss the lettuce. Sure have missed the lettuce and mayonnaise on mine though.
0391432|CMP|And, Houston, we'll go ahead and maneuver onto the LM attitude.
0391437|CC|Okay. We're watching you. Punch it in there.
0391440|CMP|Okay.
0392723|CMP|Okay. DIRECT O2 is coming OPEN now.
0392727|CC|Okay.
0393011|LMP|DIRECT O2 is OFF.
0393014|CC|Roger.
0393055|CC|America, before you open the equalization valve, we'd like one final reading on the LM/CM DELTA-P.
0393107|CMP|Okitydoke.
0393117|CMP|Okay. With this cabin pressure now, it's up to 3.5, almost 3.6.
0393125|CC|Okay, Ron.
0393358|CC|Jack, Houston. We're ready to terminate the charge on battery A.
0393410|CMP|Standby. Good. CSM LM pressure equalization, huh? Okay, cryo pressure indicator to surge 3 and verify cryo. Oh, wait a minute. See if I got the right one here. Recto 2 is on.
0393606|CDR|Okay, Gordo, I cycled the CRYO PRESSURE INDICATOR from up to down, back to SURGE/3. And we got a MASTER ALARM and there was no O2 HIGH FLOW with it at all.
0393626|CC|Okay.
0393634|CDR|Okay, I just did it again to verify it. And that picked up - it picked up the MASTER ALARM, although it might be associated with the fact that the surge tank is down and coming back up.
0393648|CMP|No, I don't think so.
0393650|CC|Roger, Gene. Although, the surge tank shouldn't have caused it.
0393657|CDR|Okay, let me give you one more try on it. Well, that time it didn't wait. All I did was go up to 1 slash 2 and the ALARM came on.
0393712|CC|Roger.
0393714|CDR|Okay, I went back to surge3; it did not. So maybe it's coming on when I go up to 1 slash 2.
0393721|CC|Roger
0393726|CDR|Yes, there it is, Gordy. It's definitely repeatable. I can go up to PRESSURE CRYO QUANTITY 1 slash 2 and the ALARM comes on.
0393738|CC|Okay, Geno; understand.
0393739|LMP|You might note that - hey -
0393742|CMP|Okay -
0393742|LMP|Gordo, you might think about the fact that we were getting them when the cabin pressure was high after launch. And there might be some association there, also.
0393757|CC|Okay, a good observation.
0393805|CMP|EMERGENCY CABIN selector to OFF. We got to unbolt it down there somewhere. Underneath the commander's couch. Okay.
0393838|CMP|REPRESS PACKAGE valve OFF, should be OFF.
0393852|CMP|Okay; verify DIRECT O2 is CLOSED. Okay; TUNNEL VENT VALVE, LM/COMMAND MODULE DELTA-P. Okay, it's greater than 3.1. It's up around 3-6.
0393938|CMP|Okay, we're going to open the pressure equalization valves.
0394109|CMP|Okay. DELTA-P is 2-1/2.
0394112|LMP|And, Gordy, battery A charge has been stopped and the battery compartment pressure is still reading 0.6.
0394122|CC|Roger, Jack.
0394136|CMP|Okay. There's the DELTA-P of 2. We'll close the equalization valve. Yes, we'll monitor for 3 minutes now.
0394401|CC|Geno, Houston. We just wanted to verify that no - none of the lights in the matrix were - flashed when you operated that switch and got the MASTER ALARM.
0394415|CDR|That's affirmative, Gordo; none of the lights flashed at all.
0394418|CC|Roger.
0394421|LMP|When we get the cabin pressure down, Gordy, here, we might try one more time. Which Gene just did.
0394435|CC|Okay, and nothing happened?
0394439|LMP|That's affirm.
0394442|CC|Roger.
0394540|CMP|Okay, still holding at 2.0 on the DELTA-P.
0394548|CMP|Okay, we'll open the pressure equalization valve and when the cabin pressure gets to 4.0, hit the REPRESS O2
0394658|CMP|DELTA-P is about 0.6, we might make it this time.
0394720|CMP|DELTA-P's - Okay, I'm going to open her right up. DELTA-P is 0.2 now.
0394829|LMP|Okay, Houston, the hatch is open.
0394832|CC|Roger.
0395039|CMP|Okay, the EXTEND LATCH is ENGAGED. Red is not visible. GN2 BLEED button. (Singing) Okay; GN2 BLEED. Not too much in there.
0395106|CMP|Okay, PRELOAD SELECTOR lever - rotate parallel to the orange stripe. Okay. PRELOAD HANDLE, torque clockwise to unload the old support beams.
0395132|CMP|(Clanking noise) Ah ha! The probe is big. Whoops - Oh, okay.
0395143|CMP|The probe is loose in the tunnel. Okay, rotate away from the orange stripe. (Singing) Torque -
0395225|CMP|Okay, we'll probe umbilicals. is the LM POWER OFF? Proceed - doesn't make any difference. DOCK PROBE CIRCUIT BREAKERS undone? ... That's good and tight.
0395256|CMP|(Clanking noise) Oops. This darn thing. Okay.
0395322|CMP|Son of a buck. Okay, I'm trying putting those things back on now, just for the heck of it. It's brand new; nice and tight.
0395348|CMP|Can you smell nitrogen? Smell something up here.
0395356|CMP|Okay, probe umbilicals disconnected and stow. Electrical connector covers are closed. Yes, yes, those are yellow ones. PRELOAD HANDLE, position against - against the umbilical connector. Okay, that's done.
0395418|CMP|SELECTOR LEVER is in the mid position. INSTALLATION STRUT.
0395431|CMP|Okay, INSTALLATION STRUT is unstowed. CAPTURE LATCH RELEASE HANDLE LOCK. Okay, the RELEASE HANDLE is unlocked.
0395457|CMP|Okay, RATCHET HANDLE unstowed to the full extension; boost to the first detent. That's good and tight going back to the first detent. Okay. Fold probe, looks like. Yes, it's out. (Singing)
0395531|CMP|Ooooh! There it comes. That's just like in the simulator. It comes down by itself. It comes - pushes me out of the way, as a matter of fact. Okay. I'll get it a little better.
0395600|CMP|Okay, RATCHET HANDLE pulled to full extension and then ratchet one stroke. Gets it so it gets it off the thing.
0395625|CMP|Okay, that's one stroke backwards now. Okay, RATCHET HANDLE and ... INSTALLATION STRUT are restowed. CAPTURE LATCH RELEASE HANDLE.
0395708|CMP|Okay, CAPTURE LATCH RELEASE HANDLE is rotated 180 degrees and it's back in the recess. Okay, let's see if it comes out.
0395720|CMP|(Clanking noise)
0395722|CMP|Ooops. Here it comes. I couldn't see it awhile ago, Let me look - the PROBE STRUT's in the way. That's why you can't see it until now. Where do we want to go with this thing down over here at the -
0395823|CMP|Houston, it's a nice clean ... and release there on top of the probe. It's nice and clean down there. The button is depressed. There's play around the little button on the end of the probe there too.
0395840|CC|Okay, Ron. In about 1 minute, we're going to have a site handover. You'll be talking through Hawaii after that takes place.
0395853|CMP|Okay. What's the docking angle? Blew it, I guess. 1.2 degrees, huh?
0395923|CMP|Yes, I think I better ver - verify that, just to make sure. COAS looks great.
0395941|CMP|Hold a minute, Gene - wait a minute. You got - there we go.
0395951|CMP|(Clanking noise)
0400006|LMP|... even getting - ... any scratching on here now. ... I ... out there.
0400027|CC|Ron, this is Houston. We'd like to confirm the tunnel index angle - that's a positive - a plus 1.2, is that right?
0400037|CMP|Stand by. I don't believe it yet. I want to check it myself. Well, Gordo, that's what I read, but I figure it's his privilege.
0400050|CMP|I was just checking for any scratches on the drogue, but it doesn't look like there is any on there.
0400058|CC|Roger.
0400104|CMP|See ... (singing)
0400213|CMP|Okay, Houston. The roll docking index is on a 1.2 - a plus - one point - a plus 1.2.
0400223|CC|Roger. Plus 1.2.
0400228|CMP|And - I took a look up there in the docking latch number 4. The bungee is parallel. ... Bungee is parallel, but it's not fully extended. You look down in the end of it you know, and it's not fully extended. And the - capture - the docking latch itself or the docking lever is loose on the docking ring. So, it looks like to me that's when I ought to recock and fire it again.
0400312|CC|Okay. We copy that, Ron. Stand by.
0400408|CC|Ron, can you estimate in inches how far down the bungee piston is?
0400418|CMP|Yes, it's down about a half an inch.
0400421|CC|Roger.
0400425|CMP|And, when I take the - and move the handle back a ways and I can take the hook - no I did (laughter). I took the hook and I pulled it back off the docking ring and then it caught again, so now it won't go back over the docking ring. Maybe I just lifted the hook off the docking ... ring with my finger.
0400458|CC|Roger.
0400529|CMP|...
0400534|CC|Say, Ron, I would like to caution you again, sticking your finger around or under that hook - there may still be some spring energy stored up there that could release.
0400547|CMP|Oh, you bet you. Yes, I know that. No, I was just touching the top of the hook when I pulled it back off the docking ring. I'm pulling back onto the docking ring, and it looks like it's back in the cocked position now.
0400608|CC|Okay. I think we've got the picture.
0400642|CMP|Do you want me to open the hatch here, Jack, or do you want to - while they're thinking about that I'll get out of the way and come on and open the hatch.
0400722|CMP|(Laughter) Can't get up and can't get down - Okay - -
0400827|CC|We're having a long conversation about that latch, Ron. Why don't you all just press on down the checklist and leave it as it is while we think about it?
0400838|CMP|Okay. That's what we're doing here Gordo.
0400855|CMP|Okay, Gordo, do you want the O2 HEATERS 1 and 2, OFF, and 3, AUTO? That's what you've got.
0400912|CC|Yes, that's fine.
0400922|CMP|Okay. He's going to open the hatch and IVT. Gordo, let me give you a little more on that docking latch. When I looked at it, of course, my handle was flush against the edge and it was also - essentially - locked in position. But since the bungee was down on the thing I took hold of it, and I felt that the hook itself was loose. Okay, so I took the handle and the handle will come back - would come back once you pressed the little button, you know, to release the handle. The handle would come back to about a 45-degree position just like it normally does when you try to cock the latches. Okay, with the handle back in that 45-degree position, then I grabbed hold of the hook and brought the hook off of the docking ring with my fingers and back to about that 45-degree position again just like it was comparable to the first cocked position. And that's the way it is right now.
0401031|CC|Okay, Ron.
0401057|LMP|Okay, Gordo, I'm running up through the tunnel from America to Challenger.
0401103|CC|Roger.
0401119|LMP|Yes... Okay ...
0401125|LMP|One piece of tape coming up shortly, provided I can find the tape. Here it is.
0401225|CDR|Piece of tape coming up ...
0401251|CDR|I'll tell you, Gordo, it's remarkably clean up here. It doesn't look like the snowstorm that I remember coming into last time.
0401301|CC|Roger Geno.
0401307|CC|We tried to leave it all cleaned up - -
0401308|LMP|... up here. Hey, you did a good job, friend.
0401330|LMP|Hey, that's good. Where is it? Oh, you - straight out there? Let me see; I want to see. I want to take a look at it, too. Hey, there it is; sticking straight out.
0401359|LMP|Okay, Houston, America has a VHF antenna - looks deployed perfectly.
0401408|CC|Roger.
0401419|LMP|Hey, you guys are upside down in there (laughter). ...
0401513|LMP|The commander's window has a slight amount of condensation on the - along lower left edge - that's the left-hand edge, really. It seems to be just there when the Sun warms the window.
0401530|CC|Roger, Jack.
0401539|SC|Okay, Houston. 74 on 1-3.
0401543|CC|Okay.
0401555|LMP|Geez, what was that? (laughter) What was that from? ... What the heck is this?
0401629|CC|Sounds like the cabin repress is working up there.
0401634|CDR|Holy smole. ...
0401638|CDR|Man oh man, did the heart beat go up on that?
0401640|LMP|Sorry about that ...
0401641|CDR|(laughter) ...
0401659|LMP|Turns out - there's Sun out in the AOT.
0401706|CC|Roger, Jack.
0401717|LMP|Okay. I'm looking out the AOT, and I see a VHF antenna and part of a umbra radar antenna in position 1. Position 2 looks right in the radar antenna, and, as I said yesterday, it looks beautiful.
0401748|CC|Roger.
0401750|LMP|Position 3, I see the other side of America and very, very clean AOT, very clean. Okay, I got a good view of the side of the service module, and you can see these little blisters in the side of the covering there quite distinctly. I think people were talking about those before.
0401839|CC|Roger.
0401904|LMP|Yes, I take that back. That's the side of - that's the side of the command module - looking at that has the little blisters on it. Got to get oriented up here.
0401946|LMP|Got a great view of the hatch - you ... watch your eyes there Gene. Look up, rather than into the Sun ...
0402051|SC|Okay. Step 1 on 1-4.
0402056|SC|Okay, Gordy. The LMP OPS is 6100 psi, 6100.
0402103|CC|Roger.
0402111|SC|And the CDR's OPS is 5900, that's five-nine-zero-zero.
0402117|CC|Okay.
0402120|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Cernan and Evans at this time have gone into the Lunar Module, and they're going through the housekeeping transfer of items from the command module into the lunar module and will proceed with the checklist of activating the spacecraft, or lunar module, spacecraft communications system, and the communications have been split into two links on Earth, Air-to-Ground 1 for the command module, and Air-to-Ground 2 for the lunar module. They're on hot mike or a voice-actuated circuit, so we can hear them run through the items as they accomplish them aboard the lunar module, Challenger.
0402224|SC|Okay. Zip bag coming up.
0402302|SC|You won't scare me any more if I come on up here with you, will you? (Laughter).
0402318|SC|I got to go back in there.
0402318|SC|Okay.
0402400|PAO|This is Apollo Control, a correction on the earlier statement, it is Cernan and Schmitt in the Lunar Module Challenger at this time. Evans had the detail of removing the probe and drogue earlier, but he's by his lonesome, back in the Command Module.
0402424|SC|Yes. Do you want to stack part of it over there?
0402431|SC|No, wait a minute. There's strips of the stuff, you know, I'll just give you a strip of it. Take it over there.
0402538|SC|Okay. Here you go. That's ... of them is that enough?
0402715|CMP|Yes, go ahead, Jack. Yes, in the tunnel. What do you need.
0402720|SC|Okay.
0402728|SC|Okay.
0402815|LMP|Checking circuit breakers now, Gordy.
0402822|CC|Roger.
0402951|LMP|... both circuit breaker panels were as advertised, Gordy.
0402957|CC|Okay.
0403632|CMP|Am I not looking in the right place?
0403637|CC|Let me look. I don't know where one is, right offhand. I'll check here.
0403651|CMP|Well, just help me with some terms here. I was just looking again at side of - underneath the power bungee.
0403722|LMP|Okay, Gordy; we're at the top of 1-13 and all switches, valves were in proper configuration.
0403731|CC|Okay, you could have asked me and I could have told you that.
0403739|LMP|We were just trying to give you a plug - Well, if you don't want them - Well, we'll take it back. (Laughter) I shouldn't have said anything to the world's most experienced DLMP. Right?
0403805|CC|Roger.
0403934|CMP|Hey, can you guys open the hatch out there. Take your picture.
0404027|CC|Ron, at first glance, it doesn't look like you have one onboard, a picture of the latch. We're still looking though, but I don't think we have one.
0404038|CMP|Well, it's kind of the conclusion I came to when I didn't find it in the systems data - Hey, I got a little bit to tell you about that. Oh, those little ones underneath the power bungee.
0404049|CC|Okay, go ahead.
0404113|CMP|...
0404122|CMP|Okay, if you look at the docking latch number 4 up beside of that - Oh, kind of a J-hook looking thing. There is a snowman. In other words, a great big fat thing with a head on top of it. And if you consider the fat thing with the head on it as a snowman, well then, the snowman's head is pointing out a 9 o'clock, on that one. Whereas one that's fully cocked and latched over there, the snowman's head points up at about 11 o'clock. And - Okay, there is a lever that comes right out of the bottom of the power bungee, it looks like, and then it comes out of the bottom then left out of that lever, is another silver slot or silver bar that goes from the lever to the J-hook with the snowman on it. That particular thing that connects the J-hook to the lever coming out of the bottom of the bungee is visible. In other words, it's not sticking back underneath the J-hook. It's visible.
0404249|CC|Ron, we've got just a line drawing here and we've still haven't got with you on what's what according to the drawing. Maybe you can hold off until we get a model of the latch, then we can stay with your description.
0404308|CMP|Oh, okay, Gordy.
0404309|CC|I'll give you a call.
0404313|CMP|Okay.
0404503|SC|(laughter)
0404538|CMP|Yeah, I know it,it's up to you. ... I want to float up in the tunnel. Do you want to float up and look?
0404605|CMP|You know, the congestion I had all day yesterday is just about gone.
0404739|LMP|Gordy, you'll be happy to know that putting the LMP's camera together is 500-percent easier in zero gravity.
0404748|CC|Roger.
0404753|LMP|It becomes a two-hand process.
0405130|CMP|Is that temporary stow?
0405301|CMP|Hey, Jack, if you get a chance, take a picture back this way.
0405341|LMP|Okay ...
0405423|CMP|Okay.
0405503|LMP|Putting the cue cards up now, and the camera, by the way, Gordy, operated for two frames and the Reseau looked clean lens looks clean and everything's fine with it.
0405516|CC|Okay, Jack; sounds good.
0405547|PAO|This is Apollo control. Schmitt and Cernan at this time still in the lunar module going through the activation and housekeeping chores that are scheduled in the flight plan. They entered approximately on time as indicated by the flight plan. Meanwhile, here in the control center one of the docking collar capture latches is here in the control center being examined by flight controllers trying to sort out why some of the latches apparently did not fully engage during the docking operation. Spacecraft now 140,451 nautical miles from Earth; velocity now is 3,683 feet per second. Continuing to stand by on air-ground 2 for a conservation from the crew of Challenger.
0410122|SC|The regular type, huh?
0410137|CMP|Okay, I can do that.
0410141|CDR|Okay, Gordo, we're on the top of 1-15, we're ready to go ahead and transfer the power and we'll give you a call.
0410149|CC|Okay, Geno.
0410203|CMP|Okay, the LM POWER circuit breaker is IN. What the - let me know what you want ... Okay, going to OFF, RESET. Okay, back ON. And, I got the old MASTER ALARM again. The pressure's been I don't know what it is.
0410234|LMP|Okay, Houston; we got a good transfer.
0410238|CC|Roger.
0410239|CMP|Got it again by hitting the panel.
0410338|CC|Ron, this is Houston.
0410343|CMP|Yeah, go ahead, Gord.
0410345|CC|Okay, we've got considerable conversation going on here about that docking latch, and it's not at all settled yet. But the primary thing we want to guard against is the possibility that it is malfunctioning and that we get it latched down on the ring and can't unlatch it, and, therefore, have problem with undocking, or possibly even prevent it. So, we'd like you steer clear of that until we come up with a final solution. No experimentation, please. Over.
0410422|CMP|Okay, I understand. I'll leave them alone. And just one little other bit of information to let you know the handle itself is not free at this point to come on back down like it's - you know. Like, if it were fully cocked, the handle itself would be free to come back down. It is not free, I did not try to put a whole lot of pressure on it, but it's not free.
0410451|CC|Okay. I understand.
0410501|LMP|Okay, Houston. GLYCOL PUMP 2 is ON, it's been on about a minute, and we've got good talkbacks from batteries 1 and 4.
0410511|CC|Roger, Jack.
0410542|LMP|LMP and CDR buses are 262.
0410548|CC|Roger.
0410600|CC|Okay, Jack, you can go ahead and switch onto high taps on 1 and 4.
0410613|LMP|That's in work. Okay, 1 and 4 are on high taps.
0410630|CC|Roger.
0410822|LMP|Houston, glycol pressure is 22.
0410831|CC|You faded out, Jack. Say again on glycol pressure.
0410837|LMP|Roger. It's 22.0.
0410842|CC|Okay.
0410843|LMP|Well, you can cut off the decimal.
0410855|CMP|Okay, stand by 1.
0410910|CMP|Okay, it's off, Jack.
0411100|CMP|No, wait a minute, I got to go get it. Which one you on? A? Okay.
0411135|CMP|Okay, Jack, I'm SIMPLEX Alfa. Okay, try it again. I got the - how me.
0411154|CMP|Okay, Jack, you're cutting out on everything, and all I'm getting is the end of your transmission there.
0411204|CMP|Okay, I got counting - 1, 2, 3, 4.
0411208|CDR|Jack, you read Gene? Okay, you - you were loud and clear after your first two words in every case, just like you were cutting out on VOX.
0411231|CDR|We got it all - -
0411232|CMP|Got it all that time. You got it all that time there now, do you read me too?
0411252|CMP|Well, that's interesting. Let me adjust the squelch on this one here.
0411317|CMP|Okay. Seems to work. I can't hear the squelch on any of them.
0411326|CDR|Jack, go VHF A TRANSMITTER and RECEIVER, OFF, and B TRANSMITTER, VOICE, and leave the RECEIVER, ON.
0411332|LMP|Okay, VOICE, ON and off on B now.
0411337|LMP|Okay, TR.
0411347|CMP|Okay, I'm going to B now. Okay ... how's that? ...
0411400|LMP|Okay. You're loud and clear, Ron. How me?
0411404|CMP|Okay, loud and clear that time.
0411406|LMP|Okay. And my - my VHF Alfa had to go to 2 on the SQUELCH, and I'm in 3 on Bravo.
0411417|CDR|... okay?
0411418|LMP|You're loud and clear Gene.
0411421|CDR|Okay ... but not much.
0411426|LMP|Okay. How do you read now?
0411428|CDR|Okay I got it.
0411429|LMP|Okay, I took it B to 2. So it's the same kind of thing I guess.
0411435|CDR|Okay for four minutes in voice, is low bit rate check ...
0411450|LMP|Okay, Houston, how do you ready Challenger? Counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Over.
0411456|CC|Challenger, Houston. You're loud and clear, although we have a lot of background noise. Not sure whether that's getting through. Do you know if Ron is still on VOX?
0411509|CDR|... Challenger to give you a call ...
0411547|CDR|Hello, Houston, America. How do you read?
0411551|CC|America, this is Houston. Over.
0411557|CDR|Okay, stand by, and Challenger is going to give you a call on S-band, and VHF checks are both GO on A and B.
0411605|CC|I think I site lost lock on Challenger, we are getting some data. We'll stand by for another check.
0411613|LMP|We acknowledge that. I heard him the first time. Okay, you ought to be getting in ... low bit rate.
0411622|LMP|Okay, Houston, this is Challenger. Counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. How do you read?
0411628|CC|Challenger, Houston. You're loud and clear, with some background noise.
0411638|LMP|They don't have a good up-link Gene. I had signal strength. And now I don't have any at all.
0411646|LMP|Okay, Houston, Challenger gave you a call, but he does not have any up link signal strength at all.
0411646|CC|Okay, and we'd like him to hold this configuration right there, until we get the site straightened out and we understand what the problem is.
0411701|LMP|...2.2.
0411705|CDR|Okay, understand hold configuration there. He just got about 2.2 on the signal strength.
0411711|CC|Okay, Geno.
0411716|LMP|And tell them I heard their transmission to you. No, a few minutes ago. I was at zero signal strength and I heard their transmission at least one of them. The first time they acknowledged, that I was going to do it.
0411750|LMP|Did you shift my hose back?
0411805|CC|Hello, Challenger; this is Houston. Do you read me?
0411813|LMP|Okay, Houston. I read you. You're weak but clear. Signal strength is fluctuating. When you call me, it fluctuated down to about 1.6. Over. And it's 2 now.
0411826|CC|Okay, Jack. You're loud and clear. The background noise I've been mentioning, although I guess you haven't heard me mention it until now, is what we expect in DOWN VOICE BACKUP and LOW BIT RATE. How have you read this transmission all the way through? Over.
0411845|LMP|Did he say "say again?" Gene? Gene, did he say "say again?" I got a little bit - oh he's got three point -
0411857|CMP|... their not talking to us ...
0411859|LMP|What? Okay, Houston. I've got 3.4 on the signal strength, and try me again.
0411912|CC|Okay, Challenger. You're coming in loud and clear. How do you read me?
0411919|LMP|Okay, Houston. I know you tried to transmit. I could just barely tell that. I could see the signal strength vary down to 3. You were modulating, apparently, but you're not getting through to me.
0411936|CC|Okay, Challenger. I'm transmitting simul now in both S-band frequencies, and it sounds to us like for some reason when I transmit, the up-link signal starts to break up. It's just the way you see it. Over.
0411952|LMP|Okay, Gordy. You're breaking up there. Still modulating, but I cannot read you. Would you - would you tell America what you said?
0412003|CDR|Yes, Gordy, we read you in America loud and clear on that simul.
0412008|CC|Okay, Geno.
0412051|LMP|Is he talking, Gene?
0412113|LMP|As soon as he starts trying to talk, the signal strength drops off about 0.4. Now, I have had - I heard him loud and clear one time when he called you guys.
0412124|CC|America and Challenger, we're going to hand over to a different site and try that here in about 30 seconds.
0412141|LMP|What else do we have to do, get some of these mags stowed?
0412154|LMP|We've got to stow the mags. Here, put the PPK where it belongs.
0412434|CC|Hello, Challenger; this is Houston through Bermuda. How do you copy?
0412448|CC|Challenger, this is Houston. How do you read me?
0412454|LMP|Do you want to ... up the camera ...stow our LCG back there...
0412510|CC|America, Houston ...
0412516|CDR|Go ahead ...
0412522|CDR|Go ahead Gord ...
0412524|CC|Okay, Jack. I think he answered us, but he was completely lost in the noise. I could just barely make out ... somebody talking. Could he hear us okay?
0412541|CDR|No. If he did hear you, he didn't answer.
0412546|CC|Okay. It was my imagination then.
0412555|CC|Challenger, Houston. How do you read?
0412605|CC|Hello, Challenger; Houston. How do you read?
0412630|LMP|...3.2...one word...I heard...
0412750|CC|Hello, Challenger. This is Houston. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, how do you copy. Over.
0412805|LMP|...
0412931|CC|America, Houston.
0412936|CC|Can you tell Jack, ask him to verify he's on aft OMNI?
0412945|CDR|Okay. I'll have him verify he's on aft OMNI. That's affirm. He's verified.
0412955|CC|Okay.
0412955|CDR|... earlier when he was ... that he had good signal strength ...he would transmit...
0413007|CC|Roger.
0413007|CC|But on this last set of checks, we didn't hear anything ...
0413013|CDR|Apparently not.
0413016|CC|Okay.
0413021|CDR|There was one time earlier when he had zero signal strength where he said he could hear you transmitting to us very weak but clear.
0413032|CC|Okay.
0413059|CC|Hello, Challenger. Hello, Challenger; this is Houston. How do you read?
0413104|LMP|Okay. You're loud - well, you're about 3 by, Gordy, but very clear.
0413111|CC|Okay, Jack. We can hear about 1 by 1 in the midst of a lot of noise, but we could tell you're sounding much better.
0413328|LMP|No. I've got 2 now signal strength.
0413417|CC|Challenger, this is Houston. Going up to you through Bermuda, and your - you should come down through Goldstone. How do I sound now?
0413441|CC|Challenger, Houston. How do you read?
0413452|LMP|You're 1.8, 1.8. Yes. Never heard him.
0413534|CC|Hello, Challenger; Houston. How do you read?
0413646|LMP|Gordy received me, didn't he? Well, he started to say something; then he dropped off.
0413650|LMP|Now he's up. Haven't heard him.
0413757|CC|America, Houston.
0413804|CC|Okay. We're going to go back to Goldstone, both up and down, and we'd like Jack to do step 406 on the checklist; in other words, go to VOICE. S-BAND VOICE to VOICE, the BIOMED to RIGHT. And we're going to give it a try in the normal configuration. Over.
0413827|CDR|They want step 406, gentlemen. BIOMED, RIGHT; and S-BAND VOICE to VOICE.
0413835|CC|That's affirmative.
0413839|CDR|... he's going there now.
0413840|CC|Roger.
0413859|CDR|Houston, do you read Challenger?
0413903|CC|Roger, Challenger. Read you weak but clear. How do you read?
0413909|LMP|Okay, Houston, You just came in loud and clear. How do you read?
0413913|CC|Okay. And that time, you're loud and clear, Jack and sounds real good.
0413920|LMP|Okay, Gordy. Let me say once again, way back when we first started and Gene was talking to you, I heard one of your answers, weak but clear, with zero signal strength showing here. Now, that might have been through Ron's VOX, I don't know. Since then, you've been able to modulate the signal strength, with occasional weak words. And - and then, when that signal strength was up around 3.2, where it is now, then you came in loud and clear with a broadcast. I answered you, you said about three words, then dropped off completely. And then we - we changed configuration.
0414004|CC|Okay, Jack. That correlates with what we've seen here in the way of signal strengths dropping in and out. Stand by, and I'll see where we want to go from here.
0414120|CC|Challenger, Houston. We'd like you to do step 7. We'll check out the telemetry HIGH BIT RATE.
0414130|LMP|Okay; step 7.
0414140|CC|And, Challenger; Houston. Making a voice check. How do you copy?
0414147|LMP|Roger. You're loud and clear. How me?
0414149|CC|You're loud and clear.
0414245|CC|Challenger, Houston. We're looking at the HIGH BIT RATE for a minute here while we're waiting. Would you check the CROSS TIE circuit breakers, panel 16? Verify they're open.
0414305|LMP|That's verified. CROSS TIE's BUS and BAL LOADS open.
0414310|CC|Roger.
0414351|CC|Challenger, Houston. We'd like you to accomplish step number 8.
0414404|LMP|Roger. Step 8.
0414423|LMP|Okay, Houston. How do you read the Challenger? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Over.
0414427|CC|Challenger, you're loud and clear. How me?
0414431|LMP|Loud and clear.
0414433|CC|Roger.
0414601|CC|Challenger, Houston. Go ahead with step 9. Report the ED BAT VOLTAGES.
0414612|LMP|Wilco. Stand by.
0414703|LMP|Okay, Houston. ED BATs A and B are 37.2.
0414709|CC|Roger. Okay. And go ahead with step 10, and then we'll go back and try to find out what's wrong with DOWN VOICE BACKUP.
0414735|LMP|Gordo, say again, please.
0414738|CC|Go ahead and check the sequence camera, if you haven't already, Jack, and then we'll have some steps for you to check out what was wrong with D0WNVOICE BACKUP.
0414756|LMP|All righty. Stand by.
0414815|LMP|Sequence camera - sequence camera is GO.
0414819|CC|Okay.
0414823|LMP|And I'm ready for your step.
0414825|CC|Stand by 1.
0415036|CC|Challenger, Houston. We'd like the RANGING switch to OFF/RESET, and the VOICE switch to DOWNVOICE BACKUP, then give us a call. Over.
0415049|LMP|Okay. OFF/RESET on RANGE, and DOWNVOICE BACKUP on VOICE.
0415053|CC|That's affirmative.
0415101|LMP|Okay, Gordy. On DOWNVOICE BACKUP, how do you read? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
0415108|CC|Okay, Jack. You're readable. You're - okay, Challenger. We read your transmission, but you're just about - just about lost in the noise. Give us another count, please.
0415130|LMP|Okay, Houston; this is the Challenger. You were loud and clear, loud and clear. No different from the transmissions in VOICE, and counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. How do you read? Over.
0415144|CC|Okay, Jack. It got a lot better. You're - you're perfectly readable now. Sounding good.
0415153|LMP|That sounds good.
0415208|CC|Okay, Jack. Would you go to HIGH BIT RATE?
0415213|LMP|Roger. Challenger's HIGH BIT RATE. How do you read HIGH BIT RATE?
0415218|CC|Okay. Still the same. Loud and clear.
0415236|CC|Okay. We'd like BIOMED, OFF now, Jack.
0415243|LMP|Roger. Going BIOMED, OFF. Okay, Houston. How do you read the LM? DOWNVOICE BACKUP; BIOMED, OFF; PCM, HI. Over.
0415254|CC|Okay, Jack. You're loud and clear.
0415300|LMP|Okay, Gordy. And that was hot mike, so that's working fine up here. And you're loud and clear, also.
0415311|CC|Okay, Jack. Let's try PCM, LO, now.
0415318|LMP|Okay. Talking to you DOWNVOICE BACKUP; BIOMED, OFF; and PCM, LO. How do you read? Over.
0415325|CC|Okay. Same old, loud and clear.
0415330|LMP|Okay, Gordy. Certainly is clear up here. You're coming through 5 by at signal strength 3.2, and - all appearances up here, that previous problem was an up-link. But I guess you were not reading me. is that correct?
0415353|CC|Well, I was - The answer is yes and no at various times. We think, though, we have a good handle on the problem.
0415402|LMP|Okay; very good.
0415416|LMP|Are you ready for us to press on here, Gordy? We're all stowed and - in pretty good shape in the LM.
0415425|CC|Okay. We'd like you to check one more switch first before moving on. Check the UPDATA LINK switch to OFF.
0415436|LMP|Okay, That is verified OFF.
0415439|CC|Roger.
0415457|CC|Want you to stand by a minute or two Jack, until we verify a funny-looking parameter here on that up-link switch.
0415513|LMP|Standing by. What's that? No, they want - they got something looking funny on the up-link - they're ... I guess on the up-link switch.
0415532|CC|Challenger, Houston - -
0415533|LMP|They want to look at it.
0415535|CC|That was a bad call. We were reading the data wrong. You're clear to press on with the checklist now on page 1-20.
0415545|LMP|Okay. We'll press on. Geno, here is your jettison bag. You can get back to Ron.
0415604|LMP|Okay, S-band PR OFF, VHF OFF; I can hear you. PM OFF.
0415806|CC|Roger, Geno.
0420211|CDR|Okay, Houston. We just transferred to CSM power, and the caution warning light did go off.
0420220|CC|Roger.
0420737|CDR|Gordo, we're about wrapped up here in Challenger. It looks like there's some life in the old bird, huh?
0420748|CC|Roger.
0420756|CDR|Okay. We'll give you a call when we get the hatch closed. Ron's doing some housekeeping in the command module, and we're going to take it slow getting back in.
0420805|CC|Okay, Geno.
0421601|CMP|Okay, Houston. The drogues going in.
0421614|CC|Roger, Ron. We've got a couple of questions for you about those - about the latch. Good old latch number 4 gave us problems I guess, huh?
0421638|CC|America, Houston.
0421643|CMP|America, go ahead.
0421645|CC|Ron, can you take a look at the latch number 4, and is the hook back away from the ring approximately one inch, as opposed to resting against the ring?
0421742|CC|America, Houston, did you copy my question?
0421822|MCC-H|We're going back to air ground one.
0421822|CMP|Okay, I heard somebody going to air ground one that time, and -
0421836|CC|Roger, Ron. Got a couple of questions on those - that latch number 4 if you can answer it for me.
0421856|CC|America, Houston.
0421938|CC|America, Houston. We're back with you after some site changeover. How do you read?
0421946|CMP|Okay; loud and clear. How me, Bob?
0421948|CC|Real good, Ron. On that number 4, latch number 4, is the hook back away from the ring about 1 inch as opposed to resting against the ring? Do you have about an inch clearance on that hook right now?
0422014|CMP|Well, there's about 1/2 inch.
0422017|CC|Okay. Understand about 1/2 inch. In what position was the latch handle when the hook was first moved back, Ron? We it kind of like in a normal stroke-back, or was it just flopping back?
0422032|CMP|No, when I first looked at it, the latch handle was - see, the hook itself was over the ring when I first looked at it.
0422041|CC|Roger. We understand that - -
0422041|CMP|The hook was over the ring, and the - and the latch handle was flush, you know. It looks just like a normal - hooked docking latch, you know.
0422054|CC|Roger. Understand.
0422055|CDR|And, Bob, this is Gene. I can confirm that it did not fold back easily, because I - I checked it yesterday. I didn't check - I checked to see that the hooks were over as well as where the handles would fold back, but I obviously didn't check to see whether that one was seated. But the handle was locked.
0422117|CMP|Yes, that's right.
0422118|CC|Roger. Understand. And the first thing you saw was the depression in the Bungee. is that - is that affirm?
0422124|CMP|Yes, that's affirm. And the bungee is depressed about 3/8 - 3/8 to a 1/2 inch you know.
0422130|CC|Roger.
0422148|CMP|You can push the - you can push the hook about an inch away from the ring, but the normal - just a resting position on the thing is about a finger's width or 1/2 inch from the ring.
0422204|CC|Roger. In other words, the loose - The hook is loose so it flops a little bit; you can move it back and forth. is that affirm?
0422212|CMP|Yes. I can move it from about 1/2 inch to an inch from the edge of the ring - clearing the edge of the docking ring.
0422218|CC|Roger. Ron, when you pulled the hook - when you pulled the handle back, did you reach and pull the hook back with it, or did it come back with the handle like a normal pullback then?
0422231|CMP|No, the - the hook did not come back with the handle. The hook did not come back with the handle. Although, when I - when I pulled the handle back to - you know, which is - which is kind of a normally uncocked position - and then it wouldn't go any further, you know. It wouldn't go an farther. And then the latch itself - or the hook - the J-hook; I'll call it the hook. I moved it off the docking ring back to this position that was about an inch or 1/2 inch from the docking ring. And it stays right there now. And I can't push it back up into the docking ring at all. Can't push the hook back up to the docking ring at all.
0422325|CC|Okay. We copy that.
0422338|CC|Okay, Ron. Our plan here is to leave it like it is. And we're going to think about it tonight, and we'd like you to just keep pressing on. Just leave it alone, okay?
0422348|CMP|Okay. Sounds good. It'll clear the docking ring; no problem.
0422402|CDR|Houston, America. While Ron is putting in the probe and getting the hatch back in, I'm going to go ahead and maneuver. How does that sound?
0422416|CC|That's real fine, Gene.
0422430|PAO|This is Apollo control at 42 hours 27 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We're estimating the change of shift press conference in 15 minutes, 15 minutes at 6:15 central time in the small briefing room. Spacecraft communicator now is Bob Overmeyer. During this past checkout of the lunar module we've had considerable difficulty in some of the communications configurations in the way the down links and the uplinks were set up. And some bit of difficulty in sorting out just what the nature of the problem with one of the docking latches is. People will be examining this through the night and during the checkout of the LM tomorrow or additional work in the LM perhaps the thing can be sorted out. Apollo 17 presently at 143,562 nautical miles out from Earth traveling at a velocity of 3,590 feet per second. At 42:28 and standing by this is Apollo control.
0422614|LMP|Bob, are you all going to want OMNI or HIGH GAIN on this?
0422620|CC|Stand by on that.
0422637|CC|We're all locked up on the HIGH GAIN. We'd just like you to leave it on HIGH GAIN. The angles you see in the Flight Plan are in case it breaks lock. That's what you need for - with this attitude.
0422652|LMP|Okay.
0423310|CMP|Okay, Houston. The probe is installed. We'll get the hatch in now.
0423315|CC|Roger, Ron.
0423321|CMP|I'm not going to connect the umbilicals unless you really want to look at probe temperature.
0423330|CC|Stand by on that, Ron. We concur on that, Ron.
0423343|CMP|Okay; good.
0423928|CMP|Okay, Houston. The hatch went in nominally, once the probe installation strut was stowed in the right position.
0423942|CC|Roger.
0424110|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 42 hours 41 minutes. Apollo 17 now 144,002 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity 3,577 feet per second. The change-of-shift briefing is ready to start in the News Center briefing room. We'll take down this air-ground line and tape any communications during the course of the briefing and replay them at the conclusion of the news conference. This is Mission Control, Houston, at 42 hours 41 minutes.
0424347|CC|17, Houston. We are recommending QUADS Bravo and Delta for spin up.
0424356|CMP|Okay; Bravo and Delta. Thank you.
0425734|CMP|Okay, Houston. At 042:56:52.04, I started the stop watch, and also the watch read 18:30:01.
0425753|CC|Okay, Ron. We got that.
0430224|CMP|Okay, Houston. We've started on the heat select radial and lineal part - part of it. The little pie-shaped things are changing color as we go out. The lineal part of it - all of the chips seemed to have been concentrated on the front edge of the glass, and they're all pretty much in the linear direction or in XX-direction. At this point in time, I haven't seen any movement yet.
0430258|CC|Roger, Ron. Aren't they on ... heads the same way they were on the backup unit the other evening in the White Room - on the lamp?
0430310|CMP|Yes, all those chips seem to be - well - in an XX - I got the lineal direction, the lineal part of the experiment in the XX-direction. And all the chips are lined up in that XX-direction on the front or the top of the glass.
0430331|CC|Roger. That's just the way you were in the backup unit the other day in the White Room.
0430337|CMP|Yes, that's right.
0431136|CMP|Okay, Houston. We've started the cooldown in LIGHT 5 position there. The radial cells, they all started to change color except the one from about 10 o'clock to 12 o'clock.
0431152|CC|Roger. Except from 10 to 12. We've got it. Did the lineal ... stay right in line there, Ron?
0431202|CMP|Yes, the crystals or chips that are inside there didn't move at all. Yes, they're ... - -
0431209|CC|Roger.
0431215|CMP|On the color patterns behind there - the one on the left, as you look at the unit - the color crystals only changed down to about 0.9 of the first square as you come down from the top. The rest of them are all black on that partic - on the left row.
0431239|CC|Roger, Ron.
0431241|CMP|So that's the maximum extent of the - that's the max extent of the heating.
0431247|CMP|You might check and see if the guys want to heat it a little bit longer the next time, when they do it in the PTC.
0431255|CC|Yes. Roger, Ron. We're copying everything you're saying, and we've got all kinds of support here; we - in fact, we've got one backup unit here watching what you're doing, so we'll keep you posted on what we think.
0431308|CMP|Oh, okay.
0431312|LMP|Is the backup CMP operating it?
0431316|CC|Matter of fact, that's affirm.
0431321|LMP|That's the way to do things.
0431325|CC|And, Ron, we'd like you to stay nominal on the heating time due to the film limitation.
0431333|CMP|Okay; will do.
0431509|CMP|Okay, Houston; 17 here. is there enough film in there to allow me to keep the camera running while I try to fill up that flow pattern?
0431522|CC|Stand by on that, Ron.
0431527|CC|It's affirmative, Ron. You can leave it running.
0431533|CMP|Okay.
0431539|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 43 hours 16 minutes. Apollo 17 is 145,178 nautical miles from Earth traveling at a speed of 3,543 feet per second. The crew is now in the midst of the heat flow and convection demonstration. This is the demonstration that's designed to provide more exact data on the behavior of fluids in a low gravity field. This type of investigation is really not possible on Earth where gravity determines flow of fluids. In space the flow forces surface tension. There are three test cells involved in this demonstration for measuring and observing the fluid flow, behavior and the results are recorded with the 16mm camera aboard. We have about 5 minutes worth of tape that accumulated during the news conference and we'll play that for you now and then pickup live.
0431651|CMP|Okay, Houston. The first thing I noticed, as soon as I opened the FLOW four turns, it started running out a little bit, even - even without doing the inject. Okay; that's because the INJECT thing was open just a little bit, but it's all right.
0431711|CC|Roger. We copy.
0431722|CMP|Okay; I'll try to squirt some fluid in there -
0431726|CC|Okay.
0431727|CMP|With the fluid inject thing.
0431811|CMP|Okay; I'm taking it in quite slow. It's noted there are quite a few small bubbles coming out with it. So far, so good. It hasn't overflowed the - the first capillary ring. And it's taken off, and it's going by capillary action toward the bottom and toward the top.
0431840|CC|Roger, Ron.
0431927|CMP|Okay; it finally met together at - that part going around the top and around the bottom - met together 180 degrees opposite of the inject port and now is starting to go out across the middle and fill up from the inject port.
0431946|CC|Roger.
0431947|CMP|We're getting a lot of big bubbles coming out now. That's after about a turn and a half.
0431955|CC|Roger. We copy.
0432141|CMP|Okay; that's two turns now. The meniscus is still holding on the first inner ring - it looks like all the way around, at least as far as I can see. The bubbles - big bubbles that have been coming out now, and also the fluid have taken over the right half of the bottom of the dish. We're starting to fill in a little bit, maybe a fourth of an inch - fourth of an inch circumference coming around from the left side opposite the injection port.
0432222|CC|Roger.
0432231|CMP|Okay; I'll keep going here. We're about two and a half turns now. And it looks like all of the bubbles have already come out. We're getting real fluid now coming out. It's a real pretty picture anyhow.
0432248|CC|Roger.
0432255|CMP|Okay; that's three turns. I don't believe we're going to be able to cover the entire bottom with the four turns.
0432327|CMP|Okay. That's four turns, and - it's covered up the right - oh, three-fourths of the floor of the thing and about three-eights of an inch on the left side of the - of the floor - three-eights of an inch annulus all the way around, except for the right - oh, say right two-thirds of the floor.
0432355|CC|Roger, Ron. You can use more than four turns if you need it.
0432401|CMP|Okay; let's go ahead and try to cover up the whole floor on the thing before we do it. The bubbles are in there, and I'm afraid they're going to stay un - unless they disappear when we heat it.
0432411|CC|Roger.
0432435|CMP|There now it's - it's coming out with no bubbles now, and it looks like it almost formed a meniscus on top of itself - on top of where the bubbles were.
0432450|CC|Roger, Ron. Is it continuing to spread out?
0432454|CMP|Yes, it's continuing to spread out now, and without pumping anything into it at all - I did that last turn fairly fast - and it seems to be spreading of its own accord now, and it should go on over and cover up the bottom, I think. Once it completely covers up the bottom, I think we should go ahead and start the heat HIGH on this pattern.
0432559|CMP|Okay. Now the - Everything's all hooked together now. We completely filled up the bottom of the floor.
0432615|CMP|Hey, for some reason, the bubbles seem to be starting to break now.
0432621|CC|Roger. We copy that, Ron.
0432654|CMP|Okay. I don't know if it's coincidence or what, but all the bubbles are formed together, essentially in the center - along the plus-X-axis direction. And they're about 1 inch wide. And then they start about three-quarters - I mean three-eights of an inch in from the circumference.
0432718|CC|Roger.
0432758|CMP|Okay; I was going to try to break the bubbles with a pencil, but if you try to push a pencil into the bubble, it just moves aside.
0432822|CMP|So that being the case, I'm going to go ahead and start the - start the timer.
0432829|CC|We concur on that, Ron.
0432833|LMP|That's called the old push-a-bubble-with-a-pencil trick.
0432838|CC|Roger. Just need a sharper pencil, Jack.
0432844|PAO|Air-to-Ground is live now.
0432845|LMP|Either that or a thinner bubble.
0432916|LMP|This is the best Friday afternoon matinee I've ever been to.
0432924|CC|How about Friday evening, Jack?
0432932|LMP|Well, I've lost track. I don't think - I don't think there's any - -
0432935|CMP|Stand by.
0432937|CMP|MARK. That was 1 minute after the start.
0432941|CC|Roger.
0432944|CMP|I'll give you another mark when I go to HIGH on the - with the SELECT switch.
0433037|CMP|MARK it.
0433039|CC|Roger.
0433135|CMP|Each bubble looks like it's locus of - it looks like it's starting one of the Bernu - Bernudi cells.
0433146|CC|Say that again, Ron.
0433151|CMP|Okay; each one of those bubbles looks like it's the locus - or the start of one of the Benard cells.
0433157|CC|Roger.
0433159|CMP|So far, the bubbles aren't breaking.
0433202|CC|We copy that.
0433208|LMP|Is Stu getting - did Stu get bubbles on his pattern, Bob?
0433213|CC|We're not running it down here. We're just demonstrating on the demonstrator there, but Stu can tell you.
0433219|LMP|Oh, I thought you were running - -
0433220|ROOSA|Roger, Jack. Yes, I - you're talking of the one we - that we did, right?
0433229|LMP|That's right. Well, I am now. I thought you were running it down there also.
0433235|ROOSA|No. Okay. The one that we did in flight - Yes, I had - I had a lot of bubbles, but I couldn't get mine - Krytox out across the center. So, you all are already well ahead of what I did.
0433253|LMP|Gee, I'm sorry you had to admit that, Stu.
0433256|ROOSA|Oh, you all just do such good work.
0433305|CMP|Another thing is, it seems to me like, in one G, the Benard cells started completely back to the edge, you know, right back to the edge of the circle. And in this case, at least, they haven't filled in yet back to the edge of the circle at all. They all started out in the center and are working around the bubbles, and then it's now - just now starting to form a few of them where there aren't any bubbles.
0433331|CC|Roger, Ron.
0433336|ROOSA|How large are the cells, Ron?
0433344|CMP|Well, they're varying considerably in size. I can see one that's about a half an inch across, and then the other ones - they've got a great big bubble in it, and yet the cell itself is down to maybe an eighth of an inch. The bigger ones seem to be on the outside; and, of course, there are very few bubbles on the outside also.
0433409|ROOSA|Okay.
0433415|CMP|And the bigger ones, generally right now, are averaging about - oh, a fourth to three-eights of an inch in their cross - cross section ...
0433454|PAO|This is Apollo Control.
0433457|CMP|The cells tend to be somewhat polygonal. Let's see, we've been going 6 minutes - 4 minutes into the eating part of it and the cells are polygonal but they don't seem to be quite as straight-lined as they were on the ground.
0433518|CC|Roger. We copy.
0433528|PAO|Stu Roosa, Apollo 17 back-up Command Module pilot is talking to the crew now from the CAPCOM console. Stu performed a demonstration similar to this on his Apollo 14 flight. That demonstration was not as sophisticated as the 17 test and the 17 demonstration is expected to provide more exact data on the fluid behaviour.
0433618|CMP|It almost looks like it's reached a steady state now. It's 9 minus 2-7 minutes.
0433628|ROOSA|Roger.
0433628|CMP|Hey, I think the one thing I neglected to mention is that we essentially have a convex surface from the - the material; in other words, con - convex with the high part in the middle; and, of course, that's where the bubbles are, too, but I think you'd generally have that type of a surface anyhow. And, it hasn't broken the meniscus of the lower, or the thinnest ring.
0433734|LMP|We should have had some popcorn on our stowage list.
0433738|ROOSA|Roger.
0433946|CMP|Okay; now the Bernard cells are starting to form in that outer annulus that went all the way around.
0433954|ROOSA|Roger.
0434551|CMP|Okay; we went back to light 4 now. And we never did get any real poliginal [sic] cells formed around the outer annulus. And even the cells that were formed on the thing, it seemed like the particle flow within the cells was very slow when you compare that with the way it was in one G.
0434619|CC|Roger, Ron.
0434759|CMP|Okay; I'm trying to - suck the stuff back in the - the entry tube there, and it looks like part of it's coming in.
0434821|CC|Roger, Ron. We copy that.
0434902|CMP|And the camera is down to about 50 percent here, so I'm going to go ahead and turn it off now.
0434908|CC|Roger, Ron.
0434936|CC|Ron, if I didn't tell you, we concur with turning the DAC off there.
0434943|CMP|Okay; yes, I got you. I'll turn it off.
0435002|CMP|You know, I just happened to think, after I've already sucked part of those bubbles back in there, we've got enough fluid in there to pump it out the next time without sucking that back in there, don't we?
0435014|ROOSA|I'm sorry, Ron. Say that again.
0435019|CMP|Don't we have enough of the Krytox fluid without sucking that back in there? Maybe I can just wipe the Krytox off with some Kleenex, and maybe there won't be any bubbles the next time.
0435032|ROOSA|Okay; stand by.
0435055|ROOSA|Ron, I guess we understand you've pulled some back in, but you haven't pulled any of the bubbles. Now, if you pull any more in, you're going to start the bubbles back in. is that correct?
0435106|CMP|Yes; that's correct.
0435108|ROOSA|Okay; why don't you stand by here on that then?
0435114|CMP|Let me see - I'll see if I can push the bubbles out of the way here with something.
0435123|ROOSA|Okay. The consensus is that we would like to not pull the bubbles back in. I think you've got a good idea.
0435134|CMP|Okay.
0435139|ROOSA|It's the old keep-the-bubbles-out-of-the-Krytox trick.
0435144|CMP|(Laughter) Okay; I'll see if I can do it.
0435205|LMP|I see you're finally getting caught up in the humor of the thing there, Stu.
0435211|ROOSA|Oh, I've always been in good humor. It sure sounded like that baffle did the trick, Ron.
0435232|CMP|Yes, I think it did, too. It looks like it worked real well.
0435244|PAO|This is Apollo control at 43 hours 52 minutes. Krytox which is a heavy oil is one of the fluids being used in the demonstration. Apollo 17 is now 146,455 nautical miles from Earth, velocity 3,505 feet per second. And this shift of orange flight controllers being directed by Charles Lewis one of the several gentlemen recently promoted to flight director. The regular orange flight director Pete Frank is an observer for this shift.
0435616|ROOSA|And, 17, just so you say we didn't give you our cue, we're standing by for the 1-17 procedures there in your Experiments Checklist - the film cycling.
0435644|CMP|Okay; we'll have to get that shortly.
0435647|ROOSA|Okay.
0435747|LMP|Okay, Stu, we got you on that. The Saturday afternoon or Friday evening matinee was absorbing us so, we almost missed it.
0435758|ROOSA|Okay.
0440328|LMP|Okay, Houston. DATA SYSTEMS coming ON.
0440331|CC|Roger.
0440338|LMP|AUX TV's to SCIENCE, and SM/AC POWER is coming ON.
0440341|CC|Roger.
0440348|LMP|Okay; MAPPING CAMERA is STANDBY -
0440351|LMP|MARK it.
0440353|CC|Roger. Mark it.
0440356|LMP|PAN CAMERA MODE, STANDBY -
0440358|LMP|MARK it.
0440359|CC|Roger.
0440403|LMP|I guess that's verified.
0440419|LMP|PAN CAMERA POWER to POWER.
0440422|CMP|Barber pole and a gray.
0440424|CC|Roger.
0440433|CMP|SELF TEST is going to HEATERS.
0440505|LMP|Okay; we're standing by for your cue on MAPPING CAMERA, ON, and SELF TEST.
0440511|CC|Roger. Stand by on that.
0440550|CC|17, you're GO for cycling the pan camera and the mapping camera.
0440558|LMP|Okay.
0440611|CMP|Okay; MAPPING CAMERA has gone ON; PAN CAMERA to SELF TEST. Barber pole and release.
0440644|CC|Looks like 10 seconds on the PAN CAMERA there.
0440726|CMP|Okay; PAN CAMERA POWER is coming OFF.
0440729|CC|Roger, Ron.
0440820|CMP|Okay; MAPPING CAMERA going OFF.
0440823|CC|Roger, Ron.
0440902|CC|That's 30 seconds off on the mapping camera, Ron.
0440909|CMP|Okay; SM/AC power is OFF.
0440917|LMP|S-BAND AUX TV's OFF, and BIT RATE, LOW, now?
0440924|CC|That's affirmative.
0440940|CDR|Say, Bob, say again those jetts you're commended for PTC.
0440945|CC|We recommended Bravo and and Delta for spinup - B, D.
0440951|CDR|Okay; do the rates look okay to you?
0441000|CC|That's affirmative.
0441059|CC|Jack, Houston.
0441105|LMP|Go ahead.
0441106|CC|Jack, when you get done with the PTC area here, we'd like you to get out the Flight Plan Supplement. We'd like to get a food report from you all on your food intake for today.
0441120|LMP|I thought we gave you that in the morning. Happy to do it, but - -
0441124|CC|That's affirm, Jack - -
0441124|LMP|You want a special report? is that what you want?
0441125|CC|We'd just like to have it - prefer tonight.
0441133|LMP|It sounds like you don't think we're eating enough.
0441140|CC|Ron, would you check your NOUN 78?
0441157|CMP|Ah-ha! Thank you.
0441200|CC|Roger.
0441327|CC|Jack or Ron, when you come around, we'll ask you to stow the high gain on our call, and we'll be wanting OMNI Bravo.
0441337|LMP|Roger.
0441346|LMP|And are you ready for the trotting gourmet's report?
0441351|CC|Roger. Everybody's here with all ears.
0441358|LMP|Okay. The CDR today had scrambled eggs and three bacon squares and a can of peaches and pineapple drink for breakfast. And then later on in the day, he had peanut butter, jelly, and bread with a chocolate bar and some dried apricots. And the LMP had scrambled eggs and four bacon squares, an orange drink, and cocoa for breakfast, and potato soup, two peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and a cherry bar, and an orange drink. And that hero of the matinee, the matinee idol of Spaceship America, had scrambled eggs, bacon squares, peaches, cinnamon toast, orange juice, and cocoa for breakfast. That's how he keeps his form. And, for lunch, he had a peanut butter sandwich and citrus beverage. And that's it, since there's nobody else up here.
0441551|CC|Roger. We copy that. We'd like you to stow the high gain at this time and OMNI Bravo.
0441637|CC|Jack, we appreciate all your information, and we'd like to just pass on some recommendations here from the ground that we'd like you to keep on with your regular menu as much as possible. And, if you do cut anything off, we'd like you to concentrate on eating the meats, the juices, and the fruitcake, which are the most effective for maintaining your electrolyte balance.
0441707|CDR|Okay, Bob. We understand what you're saying. We're shooting at eating - eating it all. It's just a lot of food, that's all.
0441718|CC|Roger. We understand, Gene. Also, on that group of foods, peanut butter's great for the bal -e lectrolyte balance, also; so you're doing okay.
0441730|LMP|I knew it was good for something. It couldn't be that good without being good for something.
0441735|CDR|I think we're all trying to make a concentrated effort also to keep quite a bit of water down.
0441742|CC|Roger. I understand. Real fine.
0441832|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 44 hours 18 minutes. The Flight Surgeon, John Zieglschmid, is pleased with the food report for today. Apollo 17 is 147,306 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a speed of 3,481 feet per second.
0442607|CMP|Houston, 17.
0442610|ROOSA|Go, 17; Houston.
0442614|LMP|Okay. Got a little information on what we were talking about yesterday with respect to southern Pacific weather, if you've got nothing else going on.
0442626|ROOSA|Go; speak to me.
0442632|LMP|Okay, looks like a little - cyclonic circulation we had over New Zealand is still there. It's - looks like the front it was associated with is broken up a little bit; however, that pattern is - seems to be hugging the New Zealand area, and - but not - has not intensified. If - if not - it may have even weakened a little bit since yesterday. It's hard to be sure exactly. The front does not look as strong, and it still seems to be hanging - just stabilized, and with all of Australia clear now and the western edge of that front being just offshore north of Brisbane. The - there is -east of New Guinea - in the vicinity of the Solomon islands, it looks like a fairly moderate-sized cyclone developing at the western edge of the - of a front that was somewhat farther north and west than the one over New Zealand. North of that - Wake/Kwajalein region that was of interest yesterday to the ARIA people - still seems to be in general overcast condition, but the clouds do not look very heavy or impacted at all. New Guinea is just on the limb, so -
0442817|LMP|Yes, I think I lost them.
0443200|ROOSA|Okay, I think we've got you now, 17.
0443208|CDR|You're loud and clear, Stu.
0443210|CC|Okay.
0443251|LMP|Stu, I think we lost you about the time I lost view of the Earth and mentioned the Wake/Kwajalein area; right?
0443300|ROOSA|That's affirmative. We didn't get much of the Kwajalein report.
0443308|LMP|There was nothing new to add over yesterday. There just seems general cloudiness in the area, but they do not look too intense or well organized. Just probably a general overcast.
0443319|ROOSA|Okay.
0443336|LMP|I'll try to get some exercise, and then I'll be back at you with some more information. Maybe we can see the Philippines by then.
0443344|ROOSA|Okay.
0443353|LMP|And, Stu, I've got my biomed hooked up. Are you guys bringing it in during this exercise thing? This is Jack.
0443403|ROOSA|Yes, Jack. We'll check on that.
0443411|ROOSA|Okay; you're coming in loud and clear, Jack.
0443417|LMP|Okay.
0443537|PAO|This is Apollo control at 44 hours 35 minutes. Spacecraft distance 147,866.
0443547|LMP|Okay.
0443549|CDR|Stu, are you reading?
0443551|CC|Roger. We're reading you loud and clear.
0443555|CDR|Okay, I think that big storm that Jack was referring to - that has moved off to the - well to the east of Australia. Very definite counterclockwise rotation and then it stretches to the south or what might even be the southeast. And then just rolls right - we ... a big frontal pattern and then it rolls right into another - another clockwise - clockwise rotating low down there near Antarctica. It gives me the impression of a - of a parrot's comb when he's got his feathers ruffled. And it, in turn, has another low trailing it, arcing and then flowing into another - another low that is very near the continent down there of Antarctica. They form a chain, as I just described froming - coming from - well, possibly southeast of Antarctica - it's hard to really tell what east is down there - on up to due west of Australia by several hundred miles.
0443713|CC|Roger.
0443721|CDR|South of Australia, you get a hint of a very large cloud mass, from there all the way down to Antarctica, that has the tendency to - -
0443746|PAO|This is Apollo control that was Gene Cernan picking up Jack Schmitt's weather observations as Jack is now in an exercise period. Spacecraft is in the passive thermal control mode and is rotating. We've broken lock on the OMNI antenna. We'll pick up another antenna very shortly. Spacecraft distance 147,953 nautical miles velocity 3,462 feet per second.
0443943|CC|17, Houston.
0444011|CC|17, Houston.
0444015|CDR|Go ahead.
0444017|CC|Just wanted to get comm there again. We had some switchover there. You might be interested; we've got an ATS map in here from this morning. Just - you're just about on - We can see the flow patterns in the Antarctic just about at - 120 degrees west, which is a little closer to South America than what you're calling, I guess. But we do - we do see that activity down there.
0444046|CDR|Okay, Bob. And there is a very large cloudy air mass between Australia and Antarctica. It has a tendency to want to start a rotation, and you can see a hint of that; it's not too strong right now. We're seeing about three-quarters of the Earth, I guess. Judging from our clocks and what we can see, it looks like the Sun is setting out over the west coast; and it leaves us with about three-quarters of the Earth available to us.
0444120|CC|Roger. It'll be about 06:15 Los Angeles time right now, so it's probably sunset out there.
0444238|CC|Ron, just a reminder from the Flight Plan change last night. You'll have a P52 coming up here at 45 hours in your Flight Plan.
0444251|CMP|Roger. Mighty fine; thank you.
0444254|CC|Roger, Ron.
0444301|PAO|This is Apollo control at 44 hours 43 minutes. That was a reminder that we are approaching the time where we are going to make the first step in a two step adjustment caused by the late launch. This will be to bring the Greenwich mean time, the Ground Elapsed Time and the flight plan together. What this first step will account for an hour of 2 hours and 40 minutes adjustment that will be made eventually. The clocks will not be recycled at this time at 45 hours. The clock recycling will be accomplished later in the mission at 65 hours elapsed time. This 1 hour adjustment consists of moving the activities that were scheduled in the flight plan to take place between 46 hours and 30 minutes and 47 hours up to 45 hours in the flight plan. Therefore, during the hour from 45 hours to 46 hours we will have accomplished all the flight plan activities that were originally scheduled to be accomplished from 46 to 47 hours. This will put us 1 hour ahead on the flight plan. We would pick up the activities originally scheduled at 47 hours at 46 hours under this plan. And this would proceed in an orderly fashion one hour ahead up to the 65 hour mark at which time we will synchronize the Ground Elapsed Time clock to 67 hours and 40 minutes and at that time go to the 67:40 time in the flight plan and we will be back on schedule.
0444627|CC|Jack, just for information, you've got your heart rate to 103.
0444819|CC|Jack, you've got your heart rate to about 103; and we lost data right now.
0444840|CC|Jack, just for information, the last heart rate we had was 103; and it's - we lost data right now, so 103 is max we saw right now.
0444855|LMP|Okay, I was just doing some isometrics. I just tried running in place again then.
0444900|CC|Roger. Do you want us to call you your heart rate if - if we get data in here now?
0444906|LMP|Sure.
0444907|CC|Okay.
0445018|CC|Okay, you're up to 115, Jack.
0445820|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 44 hours 58 minutes. Moving the GET clock ahead at 65 hours will affect the time that has previously been given for the lunar sphere of influence crossing. Newsmen who are interested in this time should add 2 hours and 40 minutes to the time previously given, which would make the time for lunar sphere crossing now 73 hours 23 minutes 24 seconds Ground Elapsed Time. The distances and the velocities that were previously predicted will remain the same. Those are 190,725 nautical miles from Earth; 33,639 nautical miles from the Moon; and an Earth reference to velocity of 2,340 feet per second. Apollo 17 is now 148,668 nautical miles from Earth - -
0445952|CC|- - resting, or did you quit?
0445956|LMP|No, I'm resting right now. Didn't seem like my arms have the stamina they did yesterday to hold the artificial g. What - -
0450002|CC|... understand.
0450002|LMP|- - did I get to?
0450005|CC|We copied about a maximum of about 118 - -
0450007|LMP|What heart rate did - -
0450007|CC|- - on the heart rate.
0450011|CC|About 118 max, Jack.
0450015|LMP|Roger. Understand.
0450017|CC|Don't let me - let me harrass you. I just wan kidding you on that. Whatever you think is fair.
0450027|LMP|You're not harrassing me. When my arm's rested, I'll try again.
0450039|PAO|Spacecraft velocity now 3,441 feet per second.
0450050|CC|Couple of interesting data points for you, Jack. We saw the - while you were doing that, we saw the PP CO2 go up; and we saw the tanks destratify again the same way.
0450105|LMP|Very good. Next mission they'll have to Flight Plan it.
0450108|CC|That's affirmative.
0450112|LMP|You saw the P CO2 go up?
0450117|CC|That's affirmative. Let me get the numbers here, if you want. It took a jump from 1.3 to 2.4 on that.
0450127|CDR|Okay. That was with two of us going, and part of the time, three of us going.
0450133|CC|Roger. Understand.
0450133|CDR|Now we've still got one going.
0450136|CC|Well, it's not unexpected. I just thought you'd be interested.
0450149|CDR|Sounds sort of normal.
0450301|CDR|Hey, Bob, with this change in the hour, what time does penumbra start?
0450308|CC|Say again the question, Jack. What time does what start?
0450313|CDR|With the change in hour, what time does the penumbra - what time do we enter the lunar penumbra?
0450327|CC|Right now, we don't - Tommy doesn't think we're going to go into the penumbra, and we're verifying that.
0450337|CDR|Okay.
0450337|CC|Say Ron, could we ask a question about the heat-flow experiment setup?
0450344|CMP|Sure. Sure, go ahead.
0450347|CC|You mentioned that the lineal chips were all on the - in the XX plane, and we're just wondering - do you mean along the XX axis of the spacecraft?
0450403|CMP|Yes; along the XX axis of the spacecraft.
0450412|CC|Is the long XX axis of the lineal cell along the XX axis, Ron?
0450421|CMP|Yes, that's affirmative. It's right-side up, if you're looking at the connect panel, you know?
0450430|CC|Yes. That's - we'd - they'd like it so that that - the axis of that lineal cell was - would be parallel to the bottom of the panel 100, as an example. It's prob - right now, it's perpendicular to the bottom of panel 100, isn't it?
0450500|CMP|Well, wait a minute.
0450515|CMP|Yes, the lineal thing is, right now, perpendicular to the bottom of panel 100.
0450542|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 45 hours 5 minutes. Ron Evans is making preparations to again perform the heatflow and and convection demonstration.
0450733|CMP|Hey, Houston; America.
0450736|CC|Go ahead, Ron.
0450741|CMP|Okay, I think I see what you're saying. I'm sorry; I read the thing with lineal cell in a plus-X direction. But what they mean is, lineal cell in the - in - (laughter) -
0450755|CC|Lineal word, I guess, is the - -
0450755|CMP|... lineal cell up.
0450757|CC|Roger.
0450801|CMP|Okay, I'll turn around the other for this PTC part of it then.
0450805|CC|Wait a minute on that, Ron. We're having a debate whether we want to, maybe, continue the next part in the same attitude or just rotate it .
0450815|CMP|Okay. Seems to me like you'd like to - maybe leave it in the same attitude.
0450844|CC|Ron, the only rational reason to change it right now is we're hearing words that if you had rotated to the other way, that you'd get better pictures out of the DAC due to the lighting reflection on it. The PI would like to change it back to the other way.
0450906|CMP|Okay.
0451231|CC|17, just for information, we will not be going into the penumbra.
0451240|LMP|Okay. Sorry to hear that.
0451549|CC|Ron, we see your 52; and you can go ahead and torque.
0451606|CC|Ron, Houston. We're watching your 52, and you can go ahead and torque.
0451616|CMP|Okay, Houston; 17. Thought you said go ahead and torque. is that correct?
0451621|CC|That's affirmative, Ron.
0451625|CMP|Okay. We'll torque at 1630.
0451631|CC|Roger.
0451701|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 45 hours 17 minutes. Flight Dynamics Officer, Bill Boone, has just informed the Flight Director, Chuck Lewis, that 9 hours of tracking since the midcourse correction No. 2 burn, confirms the burn was indeed a good one. On the present trajectory of the spacecraft the height, the closest approach to the Moon, is 52 miles.
0452354|CC|Ron, a couple reminders - LOI - -
0452503|CC|17, Houston.
0452558|CC|17, Houston.
0452608|CMP|Roger. Go ahead.
0452609|CC|Roger, Ron. Just a reminder on the LOI [sic] canister change - Have you gotten into that?
0452621|CMP|No, not yet. We're - probably get started on this -
0452625|CC|Okay. On the - -
0452626|CMP|On the heat flow first.
0452627|CC|Roger. Understand. We'd like to know when you start on that heat flow, Ron, because we need to get the DSE to high bit rate.
0452642|CMP|Okay. I'm having a little trouble getting them mounted - in a stable position this way,
0452648|CC|Understand.
0452950|CMP|Okay, Houston; this is 17. I'm about ready to start it here in about 45 seconds here; let me know when you get the tape recorder going.
0452959|CC|Roger, Ron.
0453009|CC|Okay, we got the tape recorder in HIGH BIT RATE.
0453017|CMP|Okay.
0453018|CC|Hey, stand by 1, Ron. We got a little change here we'd like to make on the plan on page 2-6.
0453031|CMP|Okay. Stand by for zero. 3, 2, 1 -
0453036|CMP|MARK it. It's reset. Start the stop watch.
0453039|CC|Roger. And, Ron, on the checklist on page 2-6 after the 16-minute "End of test and proceed to next test" we'd like to turn the DAC OFF at that position.
0453057|CMP|Okay. Will do.
0453058|CC|And, then, you turn it back on at the re - where it says "Reset stop watch and start." The time zero there - point. Prior to that, turn it on. I'll remind you of it.
0453110|CMP|Okay. You don't want to watch me fill that pan again, huh?
0453121|CC|Say again, Ron.
0453126|CMP|You don't want to watch me fill the pan again.
0453128|CC|Yes. Roger. Yes, it'll be up before then. We'll watch you fill the pan. We just - while you're taking time wiping it and all that, that's when we - we don't want to use up the film there.
0453150|CMP|Okay. I'm with you. Actually, I've already cleaned out the - the little area there.
0453205|CC|Roger. I've got 1 minute on my timer right now - about 01:27, actually.
0453211|CMP|Oh, thank you.
0453224|CMP|Well, we'll start at 2 minutes.
0453337|CC|You're still on the front page with the ...
0453841|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 45 hours 38 minutes. Distance now 149,941 nautical miles from the Earth; velocity 3,405 feet per second.
0454750|CMP|Okay, Houston. The DAC is OFF now.
0454753|CC|Roger. DAC OFF.
0454812|CC|Say, Ron.
0454820|CMP|Go ahead, Houston.
0454822|CC|Yes, Ron. If it's not too much bother, it's one of those nice things to have. The PI would like you to take a picture with the - with the 35-millimeter indoor of the orientation of the heat flow as it's mounted. See if you can get that, if it's not too much problem.
0454842|CMP|Okay. No problem. Good idea.
0454848|CC|And that should be magazine SS, which is the same one you'll use for - with the ALFMED tomorrow.
0454900|CMP|Affirmative; okay.
0454923|CMP|Okay. I opened the flow about four turns. A little bit is running out - one big bubble in it. And I still have a little bit left over, even though I wiped it out pretty good awhile ago. The meniscus is up to the bottom ring, and I think we put in eight things in there where it's going to try to get the meniscus up to the top baffle. is that correct?
0454956|CC|That's correct, Ron.
0455116|CMP|There must have been a few more bubbles down in there again. That was two turns now, and I've got it about half full all the way across.
0455129|CC|Roger.
0455131|CMP|But, maybe there's just about eight or 10 bubbles in it.
0455230|CMP|... That's three turns. The fluid is essentially .. and we're still going on the first - fourth turn now, and it's still develops a meniscus around the lower baffle - the smaller baffle.
0455456|CMP|Okay. Looks like about six of the bubbles have developed into three, for some reason.
0455507|CC|Roger.
0455557|CMP|Oh-oh. It was doing real well there. Then on seventh turn, a bunch of bubbles came in again.
0455603|CC|Roger.
0455724|CC|Ron, I might have given you a bad call before. We don't want the DAC on until just before that 2-minute mark here, where just prior to going EXPERIMENT/HEAT SELECT - FLOW PATTERN - LOW. At that point, is where we want the DAC on.
0455744|CMP|Okay. You want the DAC on when it starts heating up.
0455747|CC|That's affirm.
0455751|CMP|Okay. You, know - I may have lost track of the turns here, but I think we've got 7-1/2 or 6-1/2 turns in here. And it still hasn't overflown that first lower baffle. I've got a tremendous concave - convex surface on the fluid, but it still hasn't broken the meniscus of the first baf - baffle.
0455820|CC|Roger. We copy that.
0455855|CMP|Okay. I'm going to go ahead and take it another turn, because it was my understanding we wanted to try to get in the second baffle, anyhow. So, I'm going to take another turn of Krytox and put some more in there.
0455908|CC|That's correct, Ron.
0455937|CC|Ron, if that - if that doesn't do it, they're saying you might want to take a pencil or something and stir it up a bit and try and break it up from lower baffle into the upper baffle.
0455950|CMP|(Chuckle) Okay. I'm afraid, I may have it all over the place if I do that, but I'll try it.
0455955|CC|Roger. Very slowly.
0455959|CMP|(Laughter) Right.
0460055|CC|Ron, just a question while you're watching it here. Do you have any bubbles in the lineal cell?
0460256|CMP|Yes. This one is going to be interesting. There are about, oh, a dozen, nine to a dozen - small bubbles right next to the inject board and then about the same number right in the center of the convex portion of it.
0460314|CC|Roger, Ron. Did you - we didn't copy your answer to our question about any bubbles in the lineal.
0460326|CMP|No, I didn't get to your question on that. In the lineal unit there are no bubbles whatsoever.
0460332|CC|Roger. Thank you.
0460333|CMP|And there might have been very slight movement. Matter of fact, I can see just a very slight movement, even now. The particles, in there, they're still lined up in the YY direction essentially though, although it looks like some of them may have deviated from the front of the lineal unit back toward the center, or toward the back of the lineal unit, as you call it.
0460410|CMP|Well, I missed the 2-minute start time there, but I can keep track of it here.
0460414|CMP|So we'll start the DAC, and then I'll turn this to LOW at 02:45.
0460431|CC|Okay. We got a hack on it, Ron. If you started it, we started our clock.
0460438|CMP|Okay. You know, just for future reference here, if we like to do things in zero G and without jarring or jiggle, we want to make sure that the switch actuates with a minimum of pressure.
0460507|CC|Roger, A good point.
0460511|CMP|(Laughter)
0460616|CMP|Okay. That's just now starting to develop. Look like circular cells, great big ones. And then some of the bigger ones are subdividing now.
0460632|CC|Okay. We got that.
0460632|CMP|... are even - some of them are even getting bigger. One of them is - oh, about three-quarters of an inch in diameter, and it hasn't divided yet, at all.
0460653|ROOSA|Those are real good comments, Ron. I was in just talking with the experimenters, and if you've got nothing else to do, giving us some sizes of those cells would certainly be very beneficial.
0460713|CMP|Okay.
0460722|CMP|Okay. Frame 27 was taken at an elapsed time of about 4 minutes.
0460737|ROOSA|Okay. We got that.
0460742|LMP|Stu, this is Jack. I was taking the pictures. I took four pictures about 20 seconds apart - of the sequence just after he started it. And that ended with - or started with frame 26.
0460805|ROOSA|Okay. Frame 26 for 4 seconds - I mean for 4 frames.
0460814|CMP|Okay. That one cell I spoke of that was about three-quarters of an inch in diameter now is about an inch long and maybe three-quarters of an inch wide. Each - All of the cells seem to be bigger, in general. They're bigger this time. There is two small ones at about an eighth of an inch and - and along one side. The other one is a half-inch, a half-inch - oh, a quarter of an inch, a halfinch, and then a circular when you get around the outs - out - annulus of the cup. Then you start getting circular sides instead of straight sides. All of the flow comes from the little center spot and flows outward from the center toward the outside of the cells.
0460907|ROOSA|Okay. We - we copy that - -
0460907|CMP|... all of the bubbles have disappeared, except two.
0460919|ROOSA|Ron, is the smallest cell you see about an eighth of an inch across?
0460926|CMP|The smalles cell I see is a four-sided one; it looks like a diamond. And it's an eighth of an inch on one side, an eighth of an inch on the other side, and maybe 3/16 on the other two sides.
0460939|ROOSA|Okay. That sounds - that's a good description, Ron. I know on mine some of the smaller ones didn't show up in the - in the film, and we were not - not sure what size they are. So you might, before you quit, bracket the - the smallest or the biggest cells by your estimate of the size.
0461017|PAO|This is Apollo control at 46 hours 10 minutes. Apollo 17 is 150,976 nautical miles from Earth traveling at a speed of 3,375 feet per second.
0461120|LMP|... any rate, frame number 31, frame number 31 ...
0461136|CMP|And the information first half of the experiment. The orientation was 90 degrees from this one. (Laughter) in that the lineal cell was on the right, and the lineal cell was aligned with the XX axis.
0461200|ROOSA|Okay, Ron. We got - We had a drop in our signal strength there, and we did get your last comment about the orientation. We missed some comment about the frame numbers; I think came from Jack.
0461214|CMP|Okay. Something's a little different on this one here. Right at the top of the flow circle, it looks just like a finger. It's a curved surface that goes out and almost touches the - the circumference of the dish. And it looks just like if you're holding your finger up and looking at it. It's that type of a shape to it. It comes back down, and it's about a half an inch wide. The flow again emanates from a source that is almost on the fingertip, you might say.
0461258|ROOSA|Okay. We copy.
0461310|CMP|Okay. Somehow, that fingertip finally touched the complete circumference, and the tip of the finger disappeared.
0461321|ROOSA|Okay.
0461324|CMP|Okay. My - my small one-eighth inch - or one-eighth of an inch sided diamond joined with another one, now, and one side of the diamond is gone. I still have three sides of the diamond and the fourth side of the diamond, or the upper right-hand corner of the diamond, you might say, has disappeared and goes on with another little square - or rectangle. One - one end of the rectangle is about 3/l6 of an inch long; the other two sides are about three-eights of an inch long.
0461407|ROOSA|Ron, what's the location of that - of that diamond and rectangle in the - in the circular dish? And is it near the edge, or is it towards the center?
0461418|CMP|There are almost - No, it's almost in the center. Towards the center. Almost in the center. On the left edge, as you look at the piece of equipment , as you're looking at it, there are absolutely no patterns at all. There is a flow. You can see a stream of flow. Whoops. I can get up then and start looking at it. I blew on it when I was talking. You can see a stream of flow from the circumference in toward the outer group of cells. The outer group of cells is at least half an inch from the circumference though, at that point.
0461504|ROOSA|Okay, Ron. We're copying all that.
0461518|CMP|Yes. I think there is a general migration of - of the cells. Kind of toward the bottom of the circle, if you want to look at it that way. They seem to be stretching kind of in that direction, too.
0461540|ROOSA|Okay. You're saying that's toward minus X?
0461547|CMP|... No, toward the plus Y, as you're looking at it.
0461552|ROOSA|Okay. They're migrating toward plus Y.
0461553|CMP|I'll - I'll try to make all directions, with respect to - with respect to the right-side-up of the equipment, you know.
0461601|ROOSA|Okay. We've got you.
0461606|CMP|And the first finger I talked about was at 12 o'clock. It has joined the edge now and almost disappeared. The second finger was - still essentially the way it was - is getting slightly closer to the edge. There's maybe - oh, less than 1/32 of an inch between the tip of the finger and the edge. And it goes out at - at 2 o'clock. Okay, from 3 o'clock on around to about 7 o'clock, the cells - it's in a shadow, and I can't see for sure if they're touching the edge or not, but it looks like they're probably essentially touching - the ... the edge.
0461651|ROOSA|Okay.
0461656|CMP|And then from 7 o'clock on around to 12 o'clock again, none of the cells are touching the edge at all. And they're - oh, an average of three-eighths of an inch from the outside circumference.
0461715|ROOSA|Okay. We're getting all that, Ron.
0461803|ROOSA|And, Ron, we'd like to verify that the fluid is up to the second baffle.
0461811|CMP|That's verified. It's up to the second baffle.
0461815|ROOSA|Okay - -
0461815|CMP|All I had to do was start it in one position, and as soon as I started it - started it in one position, it whipped all the way around it. From the point I started it, it went all the way around in both directions.
0461828|ROOSA|Okay. That sounds beautiful. That ought to be a good data point for something.
0461835|CMP|Yes. Right.
0461837|CMP|I think that in the low flow here evidently things are even a little bit slower than they were in the high rate - in the high - in the high heat rate. But my little diamond now, is almost joined with the rectangle. And I think given half a chance, it's tending to go into another fivesided figure.
0461909|ROOSA|Okay. We copy.
0462044|CMP|And we start to cool down ...
0462112|CMP|Okay. As we're cooling down, the flow patterns tend to join together, so far. The ones on the outer periphery dissolve into straight lines. Straight lines are emanating in a radial direction from the center of the circle.
0462410|CMP|And, Houston, if you're listening; or DSE if you're listening. Had a little bit of film -oop, there's the end of film right now. May as well stop it. Hey, I went to HIGH for a little ways.
0462424|ROOSA|Okay, Ron. You came back in; I didn't get all of that. Understand you ran out of film. And say the other.
0462435|CMP|Well, I still had a little bit of film when the cooldown - the 2-minute cooldown period was left, so I went back to HIGH on the FLOW PATTERN just to see what would happen. And it looked like they were starting out with - again larger-sized cells developing into smaller ones. And, initially, all of the cells were about a half an inch in diameter, and they were closer to the periphery of the dish than they were in the LOW FLOW position.
0462515|ROOSA|Okay. We copy that, Ron. After - after you went to HIGH - after the 19 minutes - how long was it before you started seeing a change?
0462537|CMP|It was within a minute there. See, it cooled down fairly rapidly at the end of the 2 minutes. All of the cells had essentially dissolved. You had some radial lines on the outer perim - The cells that were on the outer side degraded into a strictly radial lines, back to the second row of cells. The row of cells that were on the inside kind of joined together and all ended up into one or two large cells about an inch - or about 3-3/4 of an inch across.
0462618|ROOSA|Okay. Sounds like real good data - -
0462620|CMP|Still got the HIGH going.
0462742|CMP|I still have it in HIGH, and the pattern that's developing is almost identical to the - what was happening in the LOW, except it seems to be happening at a faster rate.
0462800|ROOSA|Okay. We copy that - -
0462801|CMP|... triangle or a little diamond developed down there and then - and it disappeared. Only this time, it kind of joined with a different little cell, but it was the same cell next to it. I still have the big one. It's about an inch long, at 11 o'clock, as I had before. I still have a finger that's developing about 12 o'clock, and another one about 2 o'clock. And they seem to be migrating again toward the bottom of the dish.
0462957|ROOSA|Okay, Ron. It sounds like you've really wired that experiment in great shape, and all the - and everybody's real happy with the - with the data. I guess now you might as well tear it down and press ahead.
0463132|ROOSA|Okay, Ron. We're back with you now, and everybody's real happy about the data and experiment. And it looks like you did a super job, and you might as well tear it down and press ahead.
0463148|CMP|Okay. I still got it in HIGH, and I'm kind of sucking the fluid back down the - the intake. And as I get the fluid thinned out, low and behold there's a whole bunch of bubbles underneath there. And each bubble is a source for one of those little cells. It's the internal source.
0463224|ROOSA|Okay, Ron. We got that. You may have made a breakthrough for science.
0463232|CMP|(Laughter) Okay.
0463407|CC|17, Houston.
0463411|CMP|17, go ahead.
0463413|CC|Ron, just a reminder that we're scratching that page 3-45 that - from 46 to 47 - that's scratched out. And from then on all the times, you just subtract an hour from it, if you haven't done that already.
0463428|CMP|Let's see. Yes, we've already done that, Bob. Thank you.
0463432|CC|Roger. Just a reminder on that. And EECOM is over here trying to figure out if you changed the canister or not. Just a reminder on that one.
0463442|CMP|Okay. We'll get that as soon as I get this out of the way. Okay?
0463445|CC|Sure. While you're back there - Panel 100 and that - you might park the optics. We see they're not in ZERO.
0463500|CMP|Okay.
0463502|CC|And along that same line, Ron, we did notice several times while people were watching through the optics that they went to ZERO. And it's no problem if the rates are low, but just a reminder that we don't want to bump them into the stops with any kind of a rate.
0463525|CMP|Yes. I concur with that, Bob. I guess I didn't realize we were doing that.
0463531|CC|We just picked up some data points down here that people - You were all looking around, I guess, and you might - it's easy to miss that TRUNNION going to ZERO, I guess.
0463548|LMP|Houston, 17.
0463550|CC|Go ahead, Jack, or Gene.
0463556|LMP|I'm ready to update your weather in the Western Pacific, if you're interested.
0463602|CC|Roger. Go ahead.
0463607|LMP|Still can't quite figure out what that circulation around New Zealand means. It looks like it's merging with some more weather to the southeast. I suspect it's stormy there, but I still -It's not a terribly well-developed storm, although it seems to be broadening in its extent. Australia is completely free of any significant weather and almost completely free - free of clouds. The - There appears to be a front - although right now it does not look too intense - approaching from the southwest. And it looks like it's about 5 degrees of longitude south of the southwestern tip of Australia. The typhoon Cirrus - or Therese, I guess it is - appears to be just about the same position it was yesterday. And that is north of Borneo and between Vietnam and the Philippines.
0463726|CC|Roger. We see that on the prog here, Jack.
0463733|LMP|Okay - -
0464002|CC|Jack, we've been out of comm here. We've missed any of your last report here.
0464136|CC|Ron, did you ever get your P23 data from today.
0464142|CMP|That's negative; never did.
0464144|CC|Okay. Just got some updating information for you, if you want to listen to it. I don't think you need to copy it down.
0464153|CMP|Very good. Go ahead.
0464154|CC|Okay, Ron, the effective horizon was 25, plus or minus 6 nautical miles, which is real fine. The substellar pointing error was 1 arc-minute, plus or minus 1 arc-minute, which is less than the 1-SIGMA error. The marking data was extremely consistent, and all techniques and procedures were excellent. And the horizon updates from the current onboard value of 28 - is not required, so you're extremely good P23. Outstanding.
0464231|CMP|Hey, that's good to hear. Great. Thank you.
0464236|CC|And I do have one input from your other half. There's a concern that if you spill grape juice on your flight suit, it's hard to get out. So be sure - and when you're eating - drinking grape juice - you want to make sure you learn to drink it right.
0464254|CMP|(Chuckle) Okay. We - we'll try that, for sure.
0464658|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 46 hours 46 minutes. The display which shows distance and velocity is referenced to the Moon at this time so these numbers I'm about to give you will be Moon referenced and not Earth referenced. Apollo 17 is 80,322 nautical miles from the Moon. Velocity 3,349 feet per second. The crew is in a meal period at this time and we don't expect much conversation for some time. Earlier today, while the Lunar Module was being checked out and during a test of simultaneous dual communications capability from Challenger and America, a portion of the conversation was lost due to a communication line configuration in the Public Affairs distribution system. We have now obtained tape of this lost conversation from the Air/Ground recorders in the Control Center and will play that for you now.
0465040|LMP|Houston, 17.
0465042|CC|Go ahead. 17, Houston. Go ahead.
0465047|LMP|I need to make a correction. Roger. I need to make a correction. It looks as if that storm area that was in New Zealand yesterday has moved up across the two islands and is now sitting northwest. It's getting a little hard to identify the smaller islands in the pacific, but - pretty sure I've got it in the right place now looking at the map. And it is northwest of New Zealand. And it looks like New Zealand is probably having reasonably good weather today, although I suspect it rained last night.
0465127|CC|Roger, Jack. That's interesting because on my prog it doesn't show a thing down that area. This just may not be up to date here yet.
0465136|LMP|Well, there may be nothing down there except some cloud patterns and - but that's all I can see, of course. The front that's south of Australia now - I presume front - just looking at a fairly well-developed, although narrow, cloud line, is about 5 - about 10 degrees south of Perth right now, southwest of Perth and runs on a northwest-southeast line - over to a point about 10 or 15 degrees southwest of Tasmania. And then it intersects a curved front that runs from there up to - to Tasmania, and then back around down south of New Zealand about 10 degrees.
0465242|CC|Roger, Jack.
0465624|CDR|Say, Bob, this is Gene. I got some new sensors on. You might want to take a look at them.
0465629|CC|Roger. Good show, Gene. We were just wondering about that, and I'll bug the guys on my left here and make sure they're looking at them.
0465651|CC|We're not getting any data yet, Gene.
0465655|LMP|Bob, we're starting to get ... from just off Luzon on the northeast trend ... seen so far a shadow line of fairly thick high clouds overlying some thick lower clouds behind the front.
0465729|CC|Roger. You might have - be of interest onboard there, the FIDOs - -
0465852|CC|Jack, we've been having comm dropouts here on this OMNI as you swing around on us.
0465903|LMP|Okay. What - where did I leave you, Bob?
0465908|CC|Well, I'm not sure because we picked up a number of different bits, and then we dropped it all.
0465917|LMP|Did you get the overcast over Korea and Manchuria bit?
0465922|CC|Negative. I didn't get that.
0465936|LMP|Okay. That generally - South China looks clear. I haven't had a real good look at it yet, it's out on the limb. It's clearly, however, overcast over Korea and Manchuria. It does not appear to be frontal weather there, though. The dominant front in the northwestern Pacific stretches on a northwest line from just off Luzon on up as far as I can see to the terminator. And it seems to be an extremely strong front with what I would guess is heavy air-mass weather all along it. And up to the east-northeast of Japan, there's an excellent example of a shadow line from some fairly thick high clouds on solid overcast of lower clouds. Don't see any major cyclone development along it, or wave development. It just locks like a very strong air-mass front.
0470051|CC|Roger, Jack. We've got it on our prog here. We don't show the one on the northeast part of Japan, but we do show a front prog for tomorrow morning going off of Taiwan and - right from Taiwan eastward - past the Ryukyu islands and just on into the northern Pacific there. Looks like pretty heavy cloud mass over there.
0470114|LMP|Roger. That's the one I'm - Roger. That's the one I'm looking at. Extremely heavy. And right now it - in fact starts about at Luzon. It looks like Taiwan is almost on the back side of it.
0470130|CC|Yes. That's what our prog - it shows it right on Luzon and then Taiwan's clear.
0470137|LMP|Very good.
0470139|CC|We'll keep up with you yet there, Jack. Say, you may be interested. We've got 9 hours of good tracking on the - after the midcourse - and we show a perilune of about 52 miles which confirms a good midcourse.
0470159|CDR|Sounds outstanding - -
0470200|CMP|That's great.
0470201|CDR|You can cross off the canister, by the way; it's changed.
0470205|CC|Okay. EECOMs happy about that now, finally. And, Gene - the CD - your data looks good.
0470217|LMP|Okay. I never had a chance to tell you, Bob, but you - as you see - I presume - I - the LMP no longer has sensors on.
0470229|CC|Roger. We confirm that.
0470234|LMP|By the way, those were the - I guess you know - the sensors that we put on at the Cape. And they still seemed to be in good shape when I took them off. I figured I'd let things rest a while, and then I'll put them on again tomorrow.
0470249|CC|Roger. Looks like you've got eat period scheduled here for an hour, and then into the presleep checklist.
0470259|LMP|Whoopee! The old preslip [sic] checklist.
0471219|CC|Apollo 17, Houston.
0471225|CDR|Go ahead, T.P.
0471226|CC|Yes. I was going to say, is that talkative commander onboard?
0471232|CDR|How are you doing down there?
0471234|CC|Well, I feel lots better. Like I told you Geno, I think that you were the jinx on Gemini 9 for all the delays. Over.
0471243|CDR|No way; you got a longer history than I do.
0471247|CC|Everything's looking great.
0471252|CDR|Yes, it's looking good onboard. We're - I think we're pretty well squared away. We've got our stowage in shape, and we're in the house-cleaning routine. And that's about 50 percent of the battle.
0471306|CC|Right.
0471310|CDR|The weather down there didn't look too good today. How's it been?
0471313|CC|Well, as it started out, it was below minimums this morning and finally, this afternoon, it cleared up. But it was strictly zilch this morning and starting last night. There's another front due in here later tonight.
0471328|LMP|Yes, we've been watching that one.
0471332|CC|Well, Jack, you're turning into a very trained weather observer besides being a geologist.
0471340|LMP|Oh, I'm enjoying it immensely, Tom, as you may have gathered.
0471345|CC|Right.
0471345|LMP|Very interesting place to watch; I'll tell you.
0471348|CC|Absolutely superb.
0471352|CDR|How are things on the home front, T.P.?
0471355|CC|Geno, things couldn't be better.
0471401|CDR|Well, you might sound all the good words from us.
0471403|CC|Oh, will do. I plan to drop by and burn a cup of coffee tomorrow.
0471411|CDR|I'd love to invite you up here for supper.
0471416|CC|And I wish I could join you. I could make another couple of remarks, but they'd be X-rated; so I shouldn't.
0471425|LMP|Okay. I'll accept that.
0471430|CDR|You notice I haven't yet.
0471433|CC|(Chuckle) I'm very well pleased, Geno. Your - your language is superb.
0471738|CC|17, Houston, just a couple of words. We'd like you to know we're real satisfied with all the LM data that we saw during the LM activation work today, and, looking at it, the data looked real good.
0471754|LMP|Great, Bob. I was - you had me worried there for a while with that comm. Do you have a good idea what caused that?
0471802|CC|Yes, we're sure about 99.9 percent of it was just ground linkup.
0471810|LMP|Yes, that's certainly the way it acted onboard.
0471814|CC|I guess there won't be any need to go back and change the Checklist on that, but there's a lot to be said for maybe going to a real good stable condition and then getting a good firm checkout before you go into that downvoice backup mode and things like that. And I think that's what we'll do in the future.
0471831|LMP|Understand.
0471833|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 47 hours 18 minutes. That completes the tape from this afternoon. At this time Apollo 17 is 79,293 nautical miles from the Moon. With the lunar referenced velocity of 3,343 feet per second. The flight director has just gotten another update on the S-IVB impact prediction, based on tracking to date. The newest prediction is that the impact will occur at an elapsed time of 86 hours 59 minutes 55 seconds, at 3 degrees 58 minutes south latitude, 12 degrees 35 minutes west longitude. While that tape was playing, there were several conversations with the crew. Including one between Brigadier General Tom Stafford and Gene Cernan. Stafford was Cernan's spacecraft commander in both Gemini and Apollo. We'll play those conversations for you now and then come back up live.
0474549|LMP|Houston; 7 - 17
0474554|CC|Go ahead, Jack.
0474557|LMP|Yes, I'm just a little curious about the difficulty on holding the OMNIs. is that about the same as past missions, or are we losing a little bit more than usual?
0474612|CC|We're going to have Ed here give us a description for a minute, so let me stand by.
0474619|LMP|Okay.
0474644|CC|Jack, according to that - to our stalwart INCO over there, due to this new 210 down at Tidbinbilla we're holding actually longer than in the past history.
0474700|LMP|Okay. I just guess I've never been on this end before.
0474704|CC|Roger. Do you - do you hear it onboard when we break lock there?
0474713|LMP|Yes, matter of fact, with the SQUELCH ENABLED, we lose all the background noise. And we know when we're picking you up because we start to get background noise again.
0474727|CC|Roger. In other words, you - you are able to stop talking or something when you - when you know we're breaking lock then.
0474736|LMP|Well, if we happen to be talking when you break lock - no, unless we're watching the meters we won't. We lose you when you get about 55 - say 60 percent signal strength. And apparently we're not talking to you when we have less than that.
0474752|CC|Roger. Yes, INCO gave me a briefing tonight and showed me what chart to watch so I can look at numbers when to talk. I've been talking to myself too much, lately.
0474807|LMP|Yes, they have a beautiful chart there for that purpose.
0474813|CC|I never really wanted to be an INCO, but I guess I was forced to tonight.
0474823|LMP|There are lots of comments for that one, Bob; but I'd better not say anything.
0474826|CC|Roger.
0474827|LMP|Ed would never speak to me again.
0474829|CC|Well, that's all right. We can't X-rate the transcripts, so we'll just have to take - take it easy.
0474852|LMP|Say, Bob, I've got another question about the Challenger.
0474854|CC|Go ahead, sir.
0474901|LMP|(Music) Yes, sir. The battery voltage on low taps, strangely enough, was just like the simulator; but I had expected that the simulator might have been wrong - that we would have seen higher voltage there. is that - is that about what you guys expected?
0474923|CC|Roger. They said they expected that because the extra time on the pad that they're running. That 2-hour-and-40-minute delay is coming into play again.
0474935|LMP|Oh, yes, yes. That's right. Good. I forgot all about that. Something made that slip my mind.
0474943|CC|Well, things have been going so well that I can't blame you forgetting that.
0474953|LMP|... Stanley Holloway's crazy Flight Plan updates that we've just forgotten that we were ever late.
0475000|CC|Roger. Say, by the way, we like the music in the background. Sounds pretty good.
0475009|LMP|Yes, we sort of - didn't - we didn't get it out at all until today. [Music: Whipped Cream by Al Hirt] I don't know whether we forgot about it or too many other learning things going on. It's - it's quite pleasant.
0475023|CC|Roger. I don't think you forgot about it. I think you were just glued to those windows.
0475030|LMP|Well, I still am, as a matter of fact. The old Earth's coming by. And, say, I mentioned a couple of fronts that joined together about 20 degrees south of - of - the south coast of Australia. And it looks like that's a fairly healthy storm center developing down in there - conceivably may migrate up across Tasmania and maybe up - up the Sydney-Brisbane coastal area in the next few days.
0475107|CC|Roger. Where is the exact center of that, Jack? it took me a second to get my prog out here.
0475115|LMP|Well, just a second. Let me give you better from the map.
0475118|CC|Roger.
0475205|CC|While you're looking at your map, I just might mention to Gene, I just talked to your - your better half over there, and everybody's fine and happy.
0475218|CDR|Great. Always like to hear news like that, Bob.
0475221|CC|Roger.
0475231|LMP|Bob, did you get that - 15 to 20 degrees south southwest of Adelaide?
0475243|CC|Roger.
0475320|CC|17, Houston. Are you into your pre -
0475342|CC|17, Houston. Are you into your presleep checklist ...?
0475454|CC|17, Houston. Are you into your presleep checklist now?
0475502|CDR|We're just about ready to get started, Bob. We're running a little bit behind, but - we'll catch up here.
0475508|CC|Okay. No sweat.
0475516|LMP|(Music) Trying to get some more of this good food down.
0475519|CC|Roger. Keep saying those words. The people on my left appreciate that.
0475529|CDR|Yes, but it does take awhile.
0475532|CC|I'm sure of that.
0475538|LMP|You know what we really need is Rita to fix it for us.
0475543|CC|That's affirmed. I'll go along on that.
0475618|CDR|Okay, Bob, I'm going to cycle H2 FANS 1 and 2.
0475624|CC|Okay, we're watching.
0475748|CDR|FANS are OFF.
0475751|CC|Roger.
0475915|LMP|Bob, we're still on November November frame 140, and I'm going to take two more pictures before I go to sleep.
0475923|CC|Roger, Jack. We copy that. November November frame 140. And you ought to be on 142 when you go to sleep, I guess, huh?
0475935|LMP|That's affirm.
0480936|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 48 hours 9 minutes. Apollo 17 now 77,623 nautical miles away from the Moon and the lunar referenced velocity 3,333 feet per second. Here in the Control Room flight director Gene Kranz and his white team are preparing to relieve the orange team which has been directed tonight by flight director Chuck Lewis. Major activities during this shift have been the heat flow and convection demonstration which has been performed twice during this shift. Once, while the spacecraft was nulled in all three axes and again after the passive thermal control spinup mode had been established. That demonstration is to provide data on behavior of fluids in a low gravity field and the information learned from the demonstration could be valuable in the future science experiments and perhaps for manufacturing processes in space. The crew is in its presleep checklist at the present time and we have a - again a new update on the S-IVB impact just provided by the flight dynamics officer - updates impact time to 86 hours 59 minutes 38 seconds at 3 degrees 37 minutes south latitude, 12 degrees 7 minutes west longitude. We do not anticipate a change of shift briefing at the end of this shift. Handover is scheduled for midnight and there will be no change of shift briefing. At 48 hours 12 minutes this is Mission Control Houston.
0481446|LMP|Houston, 17-
0481449|CC|Go ahead.
0481453|LMP|Roger. One final word. I got those pictures; and, I tell you, that typhoon off - north of Borneo - looks like it's right off the coast of - the east coast of Vietnam now, and it's about as tightly organized and solid as anything I can remember seeing in photographs. It looks as if, from yesterday, it's moved quite a bit to the west.
0481526|CC|Roger. We concur. The prog for 12:00 - Let's see, that's about 6 hours from now - shows it to be right over the Vietnam area, the Viet - Vietnam peninsula there. So it looks like it's moving the way they're progging it, huh?
0481542|LMP|Yes; well, it's right there. Yes, it certainly is. It's - it's moved from just a little bit west of Luzon over to the coast there. So it's a pretty healthy storm.
0481559|CC|Roger. It looks - on the prog chart here - it looks real tight. It's a very - very centralized thing and real tight circular.
0481612|LMP|Oh, yes, you better believe it. It in really - it is tight. It - it's really - really no bigger than the - in terms of cloud pattern - no bigger than the - say, South Vietnam itself.
0481631|CC|Roger. How're you getting that, Jack? Are you looking with the monocular now?
0481639|LMP|That's affirm. Monocular still gives real good resolution on the cloud patterns. [Music] Naked eye, you just see the masses; but with the 10-power monocular, it's perfectly adequate for seeing the kind of patterns we're talking about.
0481700|CC|Roger. I understand.
0481959|CC|Well, guys, I guess I won't get the chance to say goodnight to you because Parker's going to come in to put you to bed.
0482009|LMP|Heavens.
0482013|CC|And we'd - we'd like you to clear - -
0482015|LMP|You can still say goodnight, Bob.
0482016|CC|- - the DSKY, if you will.
0482020|LMP|Say goodnight, Bob.
0482022|CC|Say goodnight, Dick, huh? One last word. You know, we're always hounding you guys - really don't mean to - but we - we'd like to see a clear DSKY so something doesn't burn out. Don't know the exact words on that, but -
0482039|CDR|Okay, we - we'll give you a clear DSKY.
0482042|CC|Roger.
0482050|CDR|Goodnight, Robert.
0482057|CC|We'll see you tomorrow, troops. And we had a good show today, and We'll have more tomorrow.
0482117|LMP|Ron says goodnight, Bob.
0482122|CC|Roger.
0482825|LMP|Robert Parker, are you there?
0482829|CC|That's affirmative.
0482833|LMP|Well, you're just in time to put us to sleep. A nd I'll give you one last little old observation here. Extremely bright zero phase point right off the northwestern corner of Australia right at Carnarvon, it's as bright as I've seen. They must have a pretty good surf or something going in there.
0482858|CC|Okay; that sounds good.
0482929|CC|Okay, 17, we copy all that; and I gather you're going to sleep at this point.
0482937|LMP|Well, we're going to try, Bob. I don't think any of us are real sleepy right now, but we're going to give her the old space try, here; and I'm sure we'll be asleep before long. Ron is on watch; and, if you don't wake him up with your voice, give him a crew alert. He says he'll wake up with a MASTER ALARM.
0482959|CC|That's a healthy sign. All right, guys; if I stick around long enough in the morning, I'll wake you up.
0483325|CDR|Okay, Robert, are you happy with your high - antenna configuration?
0483334|CC|That's affirm. INCO is happy.
0483340|CDR|Okay, you have anything else for us? I'll take care of our sleep configuration if you don't.
0483347|CC|Okay, stand by. I'll go around the MOCR here with white.
0483354|SC|(Laughter)
0483400|CC|Okay. A lot of happy people down here with nothing to ask you.
0483407|CDR|Okay. Nice to have everybody happy. And you - that Includes the - the biomed on the commander, huh?
0483422|CC|Okay, I guess they're happy.
0483440|CDR|Okay, are you going to sing to Ron in the morning to wake us up?
0483444|CC|Depends on how soon you guys decide to wake up in the morning. I'll be around for 8 hours anyway.
0483457|CDR|What's your expected GET of awake?
0483519|CC|Stand by, Okay, 17, it should say 56 - -
0483520|CDR|... 56.
0483521|CC|Go ahead.
0483526|CDR|Yes, we're just going to say the same thing.
0483528|CC|Okay. Should show 56 on your clock.
0483545|CC|In fact, Dr. Kranz, here, just decided that you guys get another half hour in the morning if you wanted it. But you better tell us now because we'll wake you up at 56 and ask you if you want the other half hour then, unless you tell us.
0483606|CDR|Yes, why don't you give us another half hour; and if we happen to wake up and want to move around, well, We'll do it.
0483612|CC|Okay; We'll wake you up at 56:30.
0483912|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 48 hours 39 minutes. We now have turned off the voice subcarrier up to the spacecraft and INCO just a few minutes ago reported that the crew has also turned off the voice subcarrier from the spacecraft, indicating that they have completed their presleep preparations and should begin scheduled 8 hour rest period shortly. Spacecraft Communicator, at the present time, is astronaut Robert Parker. He has replaced Robert Overmyer in that position and in Mission Control we're set to maintain the watch while the crew is sleeping, keeping an eye on spacecraft systems via telemetry. Apollo 17 is now 76,630 nautical miles from the Moon and everything appears to be functioning normally aboard the spacecraft at this time. At 48 hours 40 minutes this is Apollo Control Houston.
0485745|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 48 hours 58 minutes. At present time in Mission Control, Flight Director Gene Kranz is going around the room polling each of his Flight Controllers on the mission status and all the reports are coming up very good. The orbital science officer said that the temperatures in the SIMBAY where the various scientific instruments will be used in Lunar orbit to observe the Moon from orbit appear to be about as would be expected at this time. During the previous shift the film in the panoramic and mapping cameras was cycled and this is done once every 24 hours if the cameras are not used, to prevent the pressure points on the film in the transport mechanism from creating striations in the film emulsion, and those cameras are cycled ahead several frames to move that pressure point around on the film emulsion. During Lunar module housekeeping when the crew entered the LM on the previous shift, everything looked to be in order in that vehicle. And the guidance and control officer reports that the midcourse correction maneuver performed earlier in the day - was very close to nominal. Also, the command module is running a bit ahead of the flight plan schedule as far as reaction control system propellent usage and service propulsion system propellent usage and we have a bit more than had been predicted for this point in the flight. And the Electrical Environmental Communications Officer, EECOM, said that in general the command module - the command and service module appear to be in very good shape. Apollo 17, at this time, is 75,975 nautical miles from the Moon and we're showing a velocity with respect to the Moon of 3,325 feet per second. We don't anticipate any further conversation with the crew, having said "goodnight" to them - and we are planning to give them an additional 30 minutes on their rest period if they so desire. The rest period, according to the flight plan, is scheduled to end at a Ground Elapsed Time of 56 hours. However, we do not plan to put in a call to the crew until 56 hours 30 minutes, giving them the option to sleep an additional 30 minutes if they so desire. We showed at 48 hours 38 minutes, or about 23 minutes ago, that they had turned off the voice sub-carriers indicating that they were preparing to bed down and get to sleep. During this sleep shift we'll plan to have the air-to-ground lines down to minimize the amount of noise on these circuits. We'll be recording any conversation with the crew and will be prepared to bring the lines up in very short order should we have any calls from the crew. At 49 hours 2 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
0495700|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 49 hours 57 minutes. It's been nearly an hour and a half since we said goodnight to the crew and there's been no change in the status of the spacecraft or operations here in the Control Center. Everything's progressing along very smoothly at this point. We don't expect to put in a call to the crew until 56 hours 30 minutes Ground Elapsed Time or about 6-1/2 hours from now. Apollo 17 is now 74,098 nautical miles from the Moon and the spacecraft velocity is 3,317 feet per second with respect to the Moon. The flight dynamics officer has the option of setting up the display which gives us the velocity of the spacecraft and its distance relative to either the Moon or the Earth. And his option is to look at the spacecraft position and velocity with respect to the Moon or to Earth. At the present time, we are looking at those parameters with respect to the Moon. The large display plot up on the large 10 by 20 foot describing plotter display at the front of the Control Center shows us that the spacecraft is now approaching 160,000 nautical miles from Earth. At 49 hours 59 minutes this is Apollo Control Houston.
0505800|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 50 hours 58 minutes. The crew has been in a rest period now for about 2-1/2 hours. The Flight Surgeon, has bio-medical data on the Commander, Gene Cernan, indicates that at least Cernan is soundly asleep at this time and we presume that all 3 crew members are sleeping. Wake up call is scheduled for 56 hours 30 minutes or about 5 and a half hours from now. Apollo 17, currently 160,762 nautical miles from Earth and we're showing the spacecraft 72,200 miles from the Moon and its continued to be very quiet in Mission Control, almost no conversation on the loops here, and no change in any of the systems aboard the spacecraft - everything going along very smoothly and performing well at this time. The cabin temperature at the point we monitor it, that's where our telemetry which is the outlet of the air flowing into the cabin, shows the temperature at that point to be about 63 degrees. The cabin temperature itself would be somewhat warmer than that, probably up around room temperature - 68, 69, 70 degrees - in that area. At 50 hours 59 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
0515700|PAO|This  is Apollo Control at 51 hours 57 minutes. We've had no signs of any activity from the Spacecraft and it appears that the crew is sleeping at this time. Apollo 17 some 70,200 nautical miles from the Moon. And we have a clock counting down to the time at which the crew is scheduled to awake - some 4 hours from now. Actually, that would be the earliest that we would expect to hear from them and prior to beginning the rest period we advised them that we would not plan to put in a call until about 30 minutes later than called for in the flight plan. They were about a half hour late beginning the rest period. Tomorrow's schedule is relatively uncluttered and Flight Director, Gene Kranz, decided to give them the extra 30 minutes of sleep if they desire to take it. On awakening the - one of the main activities in the flight plan for today has the crew re-entering the lunar module, Challenger and partially powering the vehicle up and running some additional checks. And there has been no change in the status of the spacecraft based on the telemetry information we're getting here in Mission Control everything continues to perk along very smoothly. At 51 hours 59 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
0525727|PAO|This is Apollo control at 52 hours 57 minutes. We're now mid way through a scheduled 8 hour crew sleep period. And it continues to be very quite here in mission control. No signs of activity aboard the spacecraft, and everything going along very smoothly. The flight dynamics officer has been working on the trajectory, and looking at tracking data as a result of the midcourse correction performed yesterday. And at this point it appears that no further midcourse maneuvers will be required to get Apollo fif - Apollo 17 into lunar orbit at the desired altitude and time. However, the flight dynamics officer is going to reserve final decision on that point probably until tomorrow. Although it does appear certain at this point that there will be no midcourse correction required at the midcourse correction three opportunity. And probably not even at midcourse correction four. Our data displays at this time show Apollo 17 68,237 nautical miles from the Moon. And on a different display we're reading 165,584 nautical miles back to Earth. At 52 hours 59 minutes this is Apollo control Houston.
0535717|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 53 hours 57 minutes continuing very quiet in Mission Control. Now about two and one half hours remaining in the crew sleep period. The flight plan calls for the sleep period to end at 56 hours Ground Elapsed Time, however, we don't plan to give them a call until 56:30, giving them the option to sleep for an additional 30 minutes. Apollo 17 now 167,000 nautical miles from Earth and we are showing velocity with respect to the Moon at 3,293 feet per second, some 66,300 nautical miles from the Moon at this time. This is Apollo Control at 53 hours 58 minutes.
0545120|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 54 hours 57 minutes, some 1 hour 33 minutes now from the scheduled crew awakening time. What has been a very uneventful sleep shift for the crew and a very quiet period here in Mission Control. After the crew awakes, one of the activities on their schedule for the day will be to update the clocks for the spacecraft, we'll be updating the clocks here in Mission Control at the same time. This clock update is occasioned by the fact that we lifted off 2 hours 40 minutes late from Cape Kennedy, however, in order to place the spacecraft in lunar orbit at the same diurnal time or the same Sun time, and retain the lighting conditions desired for the lunar landing, the translunar injection burn was given a slight bit longer burn - just a little bit more energy put into that burn - trip time to the Moon decreased by 2 hours and 40 minutes. The net effect of this is that we now arrive at the Moon at the same time that we would have arrived had the liftoff been on time. One other effect is that the crew has a net 2 hours and 40 minutes less time to accomplish those things that needed to be accomplished in the translunar coast. This is of small consequence because the translunar coast time is relatively a slack period for them, however, in order to avoid any sudden shift in sleep periods and that sort of thing, the time has been made up in two increments - the first one of 1 hour at 45 hours in the flight plan. The crew activities were jumped ahead by 1 hour and they essentially began doing those things that were called for 1 hour later in the flight plan. They will again jump ahead an hour and 40 minutes and that'll occur at 65 hours. By that time they will have completed all those activities required up through 67 hours 40 minutes in the flight plan. Or, in other words, they'll have completed all of the activities required to get them into lunar orbit 2 hours and 40 minutes early. And in order to make the clocks then agree with where the crew will be in the flight plan, we'll jump the clocks ahead 2 hours and 40 minutes. This clock update which can be likened to going on daylight saving time, only 2 hours and 40 minutes worth of change instead of 1 hour of change as we do on daylight savings time, will occur at 65 hours when the crew will have completed all of those flight plan activities up through 67 hours and 40 minutes. This simply involves setting our clocks at 65 hours in the Control Center and aboard the spacecraft at 65 hours, moving them ahead to 67 hours 40 minutes. Then, barring any further changes in the mission timeline from that point on, the elapsed time clocks which are used as the cue to flight plan activities, should agree with the flight plan and events that - in the flight plan are called out for a certain time will happen at that time on the elapsed time clocks in Mission Control and aboard the spacecraft. This is a convenience factor. The other alternative wodd be to go through the flight plan and change all of the flight plan times to agree with the clocks. We simply find it easier to change the clocks and avoid having to make all those updates to the flight plan. At the present time, Apollo 17 is 64,232 nautical miles from the Moon and we're showing 169,518 nautical miles from Earth. Spacecraft velocity at the present time, again with respect to the Moon, is 3,289 feet per second. And we are now 1 hour 27 minutes away time at which we anticipate the crew will be awakening. At 55 hours 3 minutes this is Apollo Control Houston.
0555714|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 55 hours 57 minutes. We're about 30 minutes away from the scheduled crew awakening time. And we've seen no signs of activity aboard the spacecraft at this point, however, we could hear from the crew almost any time between now and the next 30 minutes. And if we haven't heard from them within about 30 minutes we'll be putting in a call - a wake up call to the crew. Here in the control center the next team of flight controllers beginning to come on duty. Flight director, Neil Hutchinson, will be relieving flight director, Gene Kranz. And the spacecraft communicator on the upcoming shift is to be astronaut Gordon Fullerton. He'll be replacing CAPCOM, Bob Parker. Apollo 17, at this time, is 62,415 nautical miles from the moon and traveling at a speed of some 3,280 feet per second and we show a range to Earth now of 170,650 nautical miles. We'll bring up the lines and monitor live  at this point for any call from the crew. At 55 hours 59 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.
0562941|PAO|This is Apollo Control, we're getting ready to wake up the crew. Bringing up to the voice circuits in the network at 56 hours 29 minutes, almost 30 minutes. Timing out to wakeup zero mark.
0563117|PAO|We're waiting for the spacecraft to rotate through the next best OMNI antenna, before we make the wakeup call.
0563540|CC|(Wakeup Music)
0563658|CC|Good morning, Apollo 17. It's Houston. Over.
0563733|PAO|Apparently the crew has not turned on the downlink on their transmitter. That was the University of Kansas J-Hawk Fight Song, which is Ron Evans Alma Mater.
0563815|CC|Apollo 17, Houston. Good morning.
0563916|CC|Apollo 17, this is Houston. Good morning.
0564115|CC|Apollo 17, Houston. Good morning.
0564538|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're going to try one more time with the Jayhawk Fight song and see if we can get them to turn on the transmitter. 56:45 Ground Elapsed Time standing by. Here we go.
0564554||(Music: Jayhawk Fight Song)
0564656|CC|Apollo 17, Houston. Good morning. Are you with us this morning?
0564843|PAO|As they say in the entertainment music business, one more time. We're going to send crew alert and when we see the voice up carrier up we're going to roll the tape again, the Jayhawk Fight song. Either crew is very sleepy this morning or else they have their volume turned down where they can't hear the music. At 56:49 standing by, this is Apollo Control.
0565502|PAO|We are now sending crew alert. Gene Cernan's pulse rate still at about 49 which indicates the klaxon didn't wake him up. No indication yet that the spacecraft transmitter's has been turned on.
0565712|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Apparently the crew either does not have their volume turned up enough to hear the calls from the ground or perhaps the ear plug has slipped out of the ear of the crewman who's to monitor last night which I understand was Evans. Therefore, about every 10 minutes the CAPCOM is going to give a wake up call to the crew again in an attempt to raise them. Spacecraft Communicator Bob Parker is - has unplugged from the CAPCOM Console and is being replaced by Gordo Fullerton. And when we see on telemetry that the voice subcarrier from the spacecraft has been turned on, we'll play the old fight song again: Jayhawk Fight Song, University of Kansas. And, eventually we may get these sleepheads awake. At 56:58 Ground Elapsed Time, Apollo 17 is 60,471 nautical miles out from the Moon, approaching at a velocity of 3,285 and our slant range in nautical miles from the Earth to the spacecraft is 171,985 nautical miles. Standing by at 56:58, this is Apollo Control.
0565730|CC|Apollo 17, Houston. Good morning. Are you with us this morning?
0570502|CC|Good morning, Apollo 17. It's time to rise and shine. Over.
0572223|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 57 hours 22 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The crew is still asleep. Have been unable to raise them until now. They're considering using an oscillator passed directly into the air-to-ground circuit to put a high-pitched tone, that perhaps even with the earplug out they would be able to hear it from a fairly good distance. Presently, Apollo 17 is 59,682 nautical miles out from the Moon approaching at a velocity of 3,285 feet per second. Mother Earth is behind them some 172,562 nautical miles. Here goes another call.
0572314|CC|Apollo 17; oh, Apollo 17; it's morning. Time to get up. Over.
0572331|CC|Hello, Apollo 17; do you read? Over.
0573914|CC|Here goes the tone up on the air-ground circuit from network.
0573935||(Music: Jayhawk Fight Song)
0574032|CC|Hello, 17. Hello, 17. How do you read us this morning?
0574042|LMP|We're asleep.
0574047|CC|That's the understatement of the year.
0574053|LMP|Never let Evans be on watch.
0574102|CC|I think we'll go along with that from here on.
0574103|SC|... good morning.
0574106|LMP|(Laughter) That was some party last night, Gordy. Man, that was a humdinger.
0574113|CC|Must have been.
0574507|CC|17, Houston. Over.
0574513|SC|Go ahead ...
0574514|CC|Okay, we're starting out late, as you know; but there's nothing ahead that we can see that's time-critical. So you might try to hurry a little, but don't - don't go to any great lengths to try to catch up with the Flight Plan. We can slip the LM telemetry activation without any problem. Over.
0574542|LMP|Okay, we got you. Our biggest problem this morning is keeping Ron from going back to sleep.
0574548|CC|Roger.
0574553|CMP|By the way, my sleep report is ... looks like I had about 7-1/2 hours of pretty good sleep.
0574602|LMP|And if you believe that, you're really a ...
0575220|LMP|Okay, Houston; 17. I don't know if you're ready for this or not, but we have a few reports for you.
0575227|CC|We're ready. Go ahead, Jack.
0575234|LMP|Okay. On your CDR: PRD, 17028; he claims 7-1/2 hours of good sleep. He had a Seconal before going to bed, and since the last reporting, has had four containers of water.
0575301|CC|Roger.
0575314|LMP|Okay, with respect to food - let's see, we gave you a intermediate report yesterday. Do you want that repeated?
0575328|CC|Negative.
0575333|LMP|Well, I'm not sure I can differentiate what I said yesterday, so I'd just better give it all to you. This is yesterday's complete report.
0575340|CC|Okay.
0575341|LMP|CDR was scrambled eggs, three bacon squares, peaches, pineapple-grapefruit drink, peanut butter, jelly, bread, chocolate bar, orange drink, apricot - that's dried apricot - one frankfurter, a third of a fruitcake, half a beefsteak, butterscotch pudding, orange drink, and tea.
0575420|CC|Okay, we got that.
0575423|LMP|Let me know if I'm too fast for you.
0575427|CC|No, we've got it all on tape. Go ahead.
0575442|LMP|Okay, with respect to food yesterday - LMP: scrambled eggs, four bacon squares, orange-pineapple drink, cocoa, potato soup, two peanut butter, two jelly, two bread, cherry bar, orange-grapefruit drink, beefsteak, orange drink, and tea.
0575518|CC|Okay.
0575530|LMP|Okay, and the PRD is - -
0575531|CC|Jack, we're just about to switch antennas now. Why don't you wait until we get through it before continuing.
0575540|LMP|Roger.
0575746|LMP|Okay, Houston. You back with us?
0575750|CC|Okay, Jack. I think we're back with you again.
0575755|LMP|Okay; got you. LMP: PRD, 24064; 7-1/2 hours very good sleep, 1 hour intermittent. Had a Seconal. I took two aspirins yesterday. And since the last reporting, I've had four containers of water.
0575825|CC|Roger.
0575829|LMP|Okay. Old CMP - the man of the hour, one might say. Scrambled eggs, bacon squares, peaches, cinnamon toast bread, orange juice, cocoa, peanut butter, jelly, bread, cherry bar, citrus beverage, fruitcake, butterscotch pudding, orange drink, turkey and gravy, two frankfurters, and tea. You might say he was a little logey. Okay. CMP: PRD, 15027; 7 and a - let's - Make that 8 hours of very good sleep. He claims he didn't get to sleep for a while. Seconal, and he's had five containers of water since the last reporting.
0580001|CC|Okay.
0580020|CC|Jack, if - future reports if it's any easier, we can go to negative reporting. If you're fairly close to the menus, just tell us the differences. Whatever is easiest for you is fine with us.
0580041|LMP|Okay. Well, now that we're eating well, that may be the best way to do it.
0580048|CC|Okay. I have the - your consumables status, if everybody that's interested is listening.
0580057|LMP|Go ahead, Gordon.
0580059|CC|Okay. Your RCS is running right along at 1.3 percent above the Flight Plan line. On your cryos, the O2 tanks 2 and 3 are right on the lines. Tank 1 is still, as before, about 4 percent below -below the line but looking real good. On hydrogen, you're a little above on one tank - on tank 2 - a little bit below on tank 3, but the average is right with the Flight Plan lines. So consumables look good. Over.
0580147|LMP|Okay. That's good to hear. And, I see that our old SPS oxidizer pressure has dropped some more. I guess the old - the helium is working it's way in there - or out of there.
0580203|CC|Okay. That's the way it looks to us. One final thing. Management has informed me that since you've been so late getting to work this morning, we are going to have to dock you all a day's annual leave.
0580221|LMP|All of us! I can understand - I can understand that for the commander, since he's always the commander, but I do not understand why the LMP loses a day - an hour.
0580248|CDR|Hello, Houston. This is America.
0580251|CC|Hello, Geno. Good morning.
0580255|CDR|Hello, Gordo. Request is that I handle the disciplinary problems up here; how's that?
0580303|CC|Okay.
0580345|CC|Geno, we'll have FAO work on a good time in the Flight Plan later here to work in a captain's mast.
0580356|CDR|Okay; (chuckle) that'll be great. Hey, Gordy, for the record; I swallowed three of those - those gas pills yesterday.
0580405|CC|Okay.
0581146|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 58 hours 11 minutes Ground Elapsed Time into the Mission of Apollo 17. The crew at this time having a belated breakfast, having overslept about an hour, despite many attempts to raise them by playing the Kansas fight-song and the crew alarm being sent up on the up-link, which causes a warbling sound in the headsets. However, apparently, Ron Evans, who was on watch was unable to hear, since likely the earplug had fallen out of his ear while stirring around in his sleep. Some amount of levity there is - it was suggested that their pay be docked or they should be charged with one hour of annual leave at any rate. The spacecraft is presently 58,073, it's just now changed, 58,067 nautical miles out from the Moon approaching an ever increasing velocity as they draw near the moon now 3,284 feet per second. The Earth continuing to get farther away behind them 173,821 nautical miles. At 58:13 and standing by, this is Apollo Control.
0581830|CMP|Houston, 17.
0581850|CMP|Houston, 17.
0581910|CC|Okay, Ron, we see the 93s; and you're clear to torque them.
0581916|CMP|Okay, we'll torque them at 19:20.
0581920|LMP|And, Houston, I've started the dumping.
0581925|CC|Roger.
0582010|LMP|And, Houston, we're going to dump A on the water dump - WASTE WATER DUMP.
0582014|CC|Okay.
0582833|LMP|Houston, we're starting a - O2 purge.
0582838|CC|Okay, Jack.
0582900|CDR|Hey, Gordo, we'll get everything cleaned up in the Flight Plan, including eating, up to 59 hours where we start checking the DELTA-P and pressurizing the CSM for LM entry.
0582919|CC|Okay. We see you doing all that now, and we're just checking things off as you call them. Sounds good.
0582928|CDR|Okay. And then when we'll clean all that up - regards to what the time will be, we'll pick up the 59-hour mark then.
0582938|CC|Okay.
0583133|LMP|Okay. Waste water dump is terminated.
0583136|CC|Roger.
0583527|LMP|Fuel cell purge complete.
0583530|CC|Roger on the fuel cell purge.
0583927|LMP|Hello, Houston; 17.
0583930|CC|Go ahead.
0583934|LMP|Roger. While we're getting organized to eat a little bit here, I'll give you your morning weather report, if you want it.
0583940|CC|Okay, go ahead.
0583945|LMP|Okay, Gordy. That little storm - fairly big storm - that was off the coast of northwest Africa yesterday, has moved inland and presumably is giving those people up there some weather. Might even be getting some snow up in the Atlas Mountains. It's still fairly well organized and inland a few hundred miles - or the edge of it is inland a few hundred miles. The people at the Cape of Good Hope ought to be seeing some clouds that are forerunners of a large circulation system that's south-southwest of them - that, although large, seems to have most of its heavy clouds to the southeast of the center. And they may not get any major weather out of this one. But they'll probably have cloudiness for a few days. The storm that was over Buenos Aires yesterday has apparently moved out to sea and is now west - or east-southeast of that area. Otherwise the - except for those three storm areas, the South Atlantic looks relatively calm. The zero phase point is now off the - east coast of South America, and it looks fairly dull and gray. And I suspect no extensive choppiness in that area.
0584154|CC|Jack, take a breather there. We got an antenna switch coming.
0584510|CC|Okay Jack, we're back with you and listening.
0584518|LMP|Okay, Gordy, I can't see you right now. I think that was about the extent of it. We'll get some food and, while I'm eating, I'll look at it and see if there are any more details.
0584529|CC|Okay.
0584554|PAO|This is Apollo Control. As Lunar Module Pilot Jack Schmitt began describing the global weather systems, as he saw them, from almost 180,000 miles out from Earth, the weather service meterologist here in the Control Center, Allen (Sandy) Sanderson brought in some TIROS weather maps and laid out on the spacecraft communicators console, so that CAPCOM could follow what Schmitt was describing. The crew still having breakfast at this time. CAPCOM is going to describe the tracking after the midcourse 2 yesterday. Spacecraft now 56,962 miles from the Moon, approaching at a velocity of 3,284 feet per second.
0585144|CC|17, Houston. I have the morning news here, whenever you'd like to hear it - if you would.
0585152|CDR|Go ahead, Gordo. We'd like to hear it now.
0585157|CC|Okay. First, a look at the weather in the local area. It's going to be mostly cloudy through Sunday, with a chance of showers here today - but much warmer. I'll have to wait until we get through the OMNI switch here, and then I'll be back with you.
0585503|CC|Okay, 17, continuing on with the weather. It should be - get up to the upper 60s here in Houston today. It was foggy when I came to work, but I understand the Sun is out now and the fog is burned off. On the international/national scene: There's another reported snag in negotiations between Dr. Henry Kissinger and North Vietnam's Le Duc Tho. The two have discussed the peace terms since Monday; but, so far, little news concerning the talks has been released by either side. They meet again today. A judge in the Pentagon Papers trial of Daniel Ellsburg has declared a mistrial. Judge Matt Burn has asked that a new jury be selected. Both sides in the cases must now go back to the beginning and prepare their arguments again. Former President Harry Truman is still hospitalized with a serious heart condition. Although listed in critical condition, the 88-year-old former Chief Executive has shown some improvement, according to his daughter, Margaret Truman Daniel. President Nixon has completed selection of his new cabinet by announcing that he will keep Richard Kleindienst as Attorney General, There will be a number of major changes, though, in upper levels of the Justice and Interior Departments. Life Magazine will be no more as of the end of December. The pictorial magazine lost over 30 million dollars during the past 4 years. No doubt some of the final pictures to appear in the famous 36-year-old publication will be those of the Apollo 17 mission. An airliner crashed at Midway Airport in Chicago, Friday. Of the 61 persons aboard, only 18 survived the crash. In other national and international highlights: Unemployment figures show a drop to the lowest level in 2 years; 5.6 billion dollars has been released by the Federal Government in the first revenue-sharing payment to the state and local governments; and the NATO foreign ministers have urged the Soviet Union to cut down troop strength and allow freer movement of people over the east-west borders. In local and regional news: New hijack control devices have been installed at Houston Intercontinental Airport. The new metal detectors are being installed in many airports around the United States. New inspection procedures will also begin in January - of all hand luggage carried aboard airliners. And on the sports page: Al Conover is not going to return to Wake Forest as rumored. The Rice coach has met with University President Dr. Norman Hackerman to discuss a firm 5-year contract agreement. Professional football highlights today's sports; the "Over-the-Hill-Gang" from Washington with Billy Kilmer and Larry Brown will take on the Dallas Cowboys at Texas Stadium in Irving. The Cowboys will, no doubt, go with Craig Morton at quarterback. Dallas can ensure itself of a "wild card" slot in the playoffs with the Redskins, if they win. For Dallas, it's a revenge game. The Skins have won nine straight. Johnny Bench, the Cincinnati Reds all-everything catcher, has been hospitalized for tests. X-rays showed a spot on a lung. Doctors feel sure the lesion is benign, though. The University of Houston basketball team takes on Xavier tonight. The Cougars, with four wins and one loss, will face a Xavier team that likes to play slowdown basketball. The Houston Rockets beat the Portland, Oregon, Trailblazers last night in Hofheinz, 114 to 108. The Big Eight Athletic Conference has joined the Big Ten and the Ohio Athletic Conference in breaking relations with the U.S. Olympic Committee. Back in Houston again: Bill Peterson, the Oiler coach, says he's not planning on new assistant coaches. He says, "The Oilers need more togetherness with their coaches, not new ones." And a final item: the Des Moines, Iowa, post office was emptying a mail pouch. One package fell on the floor, broke open, and spilled all over the place. The contents were Postal Service instructions on how to wrap and mail packages to insure safe transit and delivery.
0590002|LMP|Very good news report, Gordo -
0590006|CDR|Yes. That crash in Chicago, can you tell me a little bit more about it?
0590012|CC|I read real briefly in the paper, just before I came in, that it did crash in a populated area. It was a very brief report. I don't think the final details have been published yet. I'll check to see if we've got anymore in.
0590033|CDR|Okay. And I guess you know where - at least my wishes go for that Cowboy game, don't you?
0590048|CC|I'm not sure that I do.
0590056|CDR|I'll just let you make an assumption.
0590059|CC|Okay. We've got an antenna switch coming here.
0590421|CC|17, Houston. I have a little more on the plane crash, if you'd like to hear it.
0590428|CDR|Yes, sir, Gordy. Go ahead.
0590430|CC|Okay. It was a United Airlines jet, 61 people aboard. And it crashed into a south-side Chicago neighborhood while trying to land at Midway. Most of the 55 passengers - There were - well, I'm not sure I'm getting all the numbers right here. But it said here that most of the 55 passengers were found dead in the debris of a - and it was a Boeing 737 about a half a mile away from the airport. One of the victims was representative George Collins, a Democrat from Illinois - who was returning from Washington to organize a children's Christmas party. The weather, at the time, was a 500-foot ceiling and 1-mile visibility. And sleet and snow were falling at the time. There were no reports that any occupants of the houses were injured or killed. I turn back to the back of the paper, here. A United spokesman said one of the six crewmembers, a stewardess, was among 16 persons admitted to Holy Cross Hospital. She said there were two infants among the passengers. Jet apparently missed runway 13 at Midway on - and cruised over the neighborhood of bungalow homes at heights of 500 to 1000 feet and then with his nose up and tail down tore into the dwellings. Witnesses said the plane scraped the roofs of two bungalows and sheared through six houses, setting them aflame. The fuselage of the airliner split, but the nose remained intact. A tail section was sticking out of one house. The plummetting airliner sheared through utility lines and a 2-square-mile area was blacked out. Telephone service was knocked out. A power company spokesman said 5000 homes were affected.
0590643|CDR|Okeydoke.
0590650|CC|And a little news about your trajectory. Since the midcourse 2, you've been looking real good. You've - you're homing in on 53-1/2-mile parallel. We're discussing midcourse 4, which - if we do it all - it's going to be very small. It's looking like about a foot and a half per second right now. And I guess if we do it, it will only be because it will save us DELTA-V at LOI. Over.
0590728|CDR|Okay, I was just looking. Those dumps really knocked us for a loop, didn't they?
0590734|CC|Yes, it - it's driving your PTC out.
0590740|CDR|Yes, we're at almost 40 degrees now.
0591050|LMP|Gordy, has the temperature been pretty cold down there?
0591055|CC|Here, in Houston, it warmed up considerably last night - yesterday afternoon and last night. And this morning, it's probably in the 60s somewhere.
0591120|LMP|Makes it - -
0591204|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 59 hours 12 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 17 currently is 56,148 nautical miles out from the Moon closing on the Moon at 3,284 feet per second. Distance from Earth is now 175,441 nautical miles. We'll continue to leave the line up as we proceed into today's activities which includes another activation and check out of the lunar module and hopefully today the communications noise will be somewhat less than it was yesterday. At 59:13 standing by, this is Apollo Control.
0591832|CC|17, Houston. I have some words about the troubles we had during the LM comm checks yesterday, if you have a free moment to listen.
0591847|CDR|Go ahead, Gordy. We're listening.
0591849|CC|Okay. We think we've got a pretty good handle on what the problem was - and that was, that the - the LM communications gear, we think, was jumping on the voice subcarrier, rather than the main carrier. And the symptoms that we had point to that. What would happen is, when I would try to transmit, then it would lose lock as soon as I put modulation on the voice subcarrier. During the checks today, we're going to try to verify that the system is indeed working okay. And we can do it without any changes in the onboard procedures by - purely by procedures that will be handled at the ground site and here at Mission Control. And so that's what we're planning to do. We really don't - The problem that happened has been seen before, evidently; and it's not that unusual. We really don't think there's anything wrong with the onboard equipment. Over.
0592007|LMP|Sounds good, Gordy. We'll just take her slow and easy when I get over there today and make sure we understand it.
0592017|CC|Okay, Jack. And there's no - real no voice check scheduled, and we don't think any are required. We can tell what we need to do without any voice checks from here.
0592029|LMP|Gordy, you're breaking up. Talk to you as soon as we get another OMNI.
0592033|CC|Okay.
0592041|LMP|While I got you, I took three pictures of the Earth I thought I might have moved one of them. And we're on frame 145.
0592107|LMP|Did you copy, Gordy?
0592110|CC|That's affirmative, Jack. I copy. You may not be reading me through the OMNI switch.
0592116|LMP|Okay, that was mag November November.
0592121|CC|Roger.
0592349|LMP|Houston, 17. Do you want us to go into a battery B charge?
0592355|CC|Let me check, Jack. That's affirmative. Go ahead
0592402|LMP|Okay.
0592523|LMP|BATTERY B is being CHARGED. And, Gordy, different than the last time - the charger amps is moving up very slowly. Started out at about 0.2 and now is 1 amp - little more - it's still going up. Before, it jumped right up to about 2 amps. is that expected?
0592549|CC|Oh ... we'll check on that. Stand by.
0592559|CDR|Gordy, the LM/CM DELTA-P is 0.6. You still want us to take the command module up?
0592619|CC|Geno, that'll be fine. You will not have to jack up the command module pressure.
0592628|CDR|Okay, I think I'll maneuver at attitude then.
0592638|CC|Okay; sounds good.
0592806|CC|Jack, the way the amps are going to look when you put the charger on is the function of the state of the charge of the battery. And what you described is about what we'd expect, considering where the battery should be.
0592824|LMP|Okay; that's what I figured. It's up about one and three-quarter amps now.
0592828|CC|Roger.
0592834|LMP|And it appears to be stable.
0592837|CC|Okay.
0592839|LMP|Gordy, I'm in the process of - I'm in the process of putting biomed sensors on.
0592844|CC|Roger.
0593044|CMP|Hey, Houston; 17. Thanks to a little South Carolina boy we had up here last time, we've got some grits up here. And they're really not too bad. A little butter on them and - A little bit dry. Of course, you could add a little more water to them and they'd be a little better, but not bad at all.
0593106|CC|I can't believe I'm hearing that from a real Yankee
0593113|CMP|Of course, Kansas is not exactly Yankee.
0593116|CDR|Let me tell you, that does not apply to the little old farm boy from Chicago.
0593123|CC|Roger.
0593130|LMP|As you students of American history may recall, Kansas caused a lot of the problem we had with those two people.
0593141|CC|Roger.
0593146|CDR|And grits is causing the rest of it.
0593238|CC|17, Houston. We see that you're making a maneuver uncoupled in pitch, and we'd rather you make it coupled to keep FDO happy. Over.
0593250|LMP|Okay.
0593254|CDR|Yes, that was my fault, Gordo. I screwed up here.
0594250|CMP|Houston, EMERGENCY CAB REPRESS is OFF.
0594256|CC|Roger.
0594304|CMP|Okay, REPRESS PACKAGE valve is OFF.
0594308|CC|Say again, Ron.
0594309|CDR|Hello, Gordy. You with us?
0594310|CC|Yes. How do you read?
0594315|CDR|We're reading you loud and clear. The EMERGENCY CABIN PRESSURE SELECT is OFF. And we're about ready to open the EQUALIZATION valve.
0594325|CC|Okay. And we're ready for the high gain.
0594332|CMP|Okay.
0594430|PAO|This is Apollo Control 59 hours 44 minutes Ground Elapsed Time into the mission of Apollo 17. The crew, at this time, making preparations for entry into the lunar module.
0594444|LMP|Gordy, that's the high-gain. How do you like it?
0594448|CC|Looking good.
0594520|CDR|Okay, Gordy. I was reading 0.2 on the DELTA-P and the hatch is cracked.
0594525|CC|Roger, Gene.
0594840|LMP|Hey, Houston; 17. How do you read the LMPs biomed?
0594846|CC|Let me check.
0594908|CC|Jack, the EKG looks great. Your ZPN looks like a sensor may be loose.
0594925|CC|And we'll be handing over here in - -
0594927|LMP|... loose sensor ...
0594928|CC|- - about 30 seconds.
0594931|LMP|Okay. We're in the process of getting the probe and drogue out. I pushed on the sensors real hard again, and see if that helps it.
0594940|CC|Okay. We'll take a look.
0594953|CC|That helped it. Don't worry about it, until we call you again.
0595005|CDR|... on that one, Gordy. You've always been one of those smooth talkers.
0595450|CMP|There's all - yes - they're down there somewhere.
0595454|CMP|Okay. The probe is out. And we'll try the drogue now.
0595458|CC|Okay, Ron.
0595753|CDR|Okay, the - the drogue is out, and we're going up to take another look at Challenger.
0595803|CC|Okay, Gene.
0595931|LMP|Somebody left their lights on in here.
0595937|CC|Roger.
0595944|LMP|It's just like a refrigerator.
0595949|CC|Roger.
0600036|LMP|Docking index is unchanged.
0600040|CC|Okay. It's a plus 1.2. Right?
0600045|LMP|That's affirm.
0600318|CC|Ron, Houston. Over.
0600323|CMP|Go ahead.
0600325|CC|Okay, Ron. When you get a - a moment, when it's convenient, we'd like you to go up to the latch number 4 there, the one that's been giving us trouble, and we'd like you - well, we think it's just half cocked and we'd like you to stroke it. We think it will probably cock on one - with one more stroke. We'd like you to stroke it at least twice more to verify that it is fully cocked. And as you do stroke the handle, we'd like you to notice approximately what point in the - in the throw that the resistance increases. I think that summarizes what we want you to do, if you keep us advised as you go along.
0600421|CMP|Okay.
0600423|CC|We - we're going to leave it cocked then from here on until redocking after rendezvous. Well - we don't want to - we don't want you to fire it.
0600438|CMP|Sure. Understand.
0600508|LMP|Houston, we're transferring to LM POWER.
0600511|CC|Roger.
0600514|LMP|Okay, Houston. I'm going to give them LM POWER. I'm going to go RESET and OFF.
0600522|LMP|And we have LM power.
0600525|CC|Roger.
0600549|CDR|Gordo, this is Geno.
0600551|CC|Go ahead, Gene.
0600555|CDR|Okay. While my compatriots are carrying out their respective tasks, I'm going to go off the air here for a - a few short minutes. And give you a call when I get back.
0600607|CC|Okay.
0600610|LMP|And I'm in step 3, Gordy, on 2-2.
0600615|CC|Roger.
0600725|CMP|Okay, Houston. America here. I'm on nor docking latch number 4 now.
0600731|CC|Okay, Ron.
0600750|CMP|Okay, the handle itself is free swinging at - to a point about 1 inch beyond the backside of the J-hook.
0600810|CC|Roger.
0600811|CMP|And, I'll go ahead and try to cock it now.
0600819|LMP|Gordy, ED BATs are 37.2 and 37.2, and the BUS VOLTAGES are 26.2 and I'll bring on the high taps.
0600836|CC|Okay, Jack. Sounds good.
0600841|CMP|And, Houston, as we all suspected, it has one cock on it, or it had one cock. Now it's fully cocked. And the handle itself is free swinging. The plunger has depressed, oh, almost three-quarters of an inch from the top. And it is no longer parallel with the surface.
0600914|CC|Roger, Ron.
0600918|CMP|Okay. When you look back in the side of it there, that little J-hook with the snowman in it, the snowman's head points - as you look directly at the side of it, it points - the snowman's head is at 8 o'clock and the connecting link from the one that connects - the one that goes into the plunger to - to the little fat J-bar there, is parallel with that slot, so that the point of the J sticks out. So it is, indeed, fully cocked.
0601000|CC|Okay, Ron. Sounds good and that's where we'd like to leave it.
0601005|CMP|Okay. Will do.
0601021|LMP|Okay. Step 5, 2-3.
0601024|CC|Roger.
0601120|LMP|Okay, Houston. Step 5 complete. Glycol pressure is 21. It's down about a psi from yesterday.
0601128|CC|Okay, Jack. Copy.
0601134|CMP|And, Houston, is magazine II a good one to use for a - some opportunity interior photos?
0601144|CC|Let me check, Ron.
0601157|CC|That's affirm; II sounds good.
0601204|CMP|Hope so. Looks like that's the only one I have.
0601212|CC|Do you - do you recall when you did the heat flow on HH, if you used all of HH up on that experiment?
0601223|CC|Don't get it out to look, but I just wondered if you remembered.
0601224|CMP|... No, it ran out. It didn't - I got the complete cooldown part of the ex - of the experiment on HH and then switched to HIGH. And I got about 2 minutes of HIGH before the film ran out again. Had that at HIGH power on the - on the - -
0601250|CC|Okay, Ron. Thank you.
0601253|CMP|After the main part of the experiment was complete.
0601256|CC|Roger.
0601302|CC|And, Jack, we're copying LM data now.
0601304|LMP|Okay, Gordy. Beautiful. I was just going to say step 6 is complete.
0601646|LMP|Houston, 17.
0601648|CC|Go ahead.
0601654|LMP|Roger. I just was thinking while I was waiting here that the cleanliness of these two spacecraft is certainly a tribute to the - all the people at Grumman and Downey and at the Cape, who worked so hard to put them that way.
0601714|CC|Okay. We'll make sure they hear about it.
0601932|CC|Challenger, Houston. We're - we've looked at the LM data and it looks perfect, no problems at all. What we're doing right now, though, is - is - the checkout on the carrier and subcarrier lockups on the LM comm. So far, we've had no trouble with it, but we haven't quite completed the routine we wanted to try. Over.
0602000|LMP|Okay. I understand, Gordy. No - no hurry here.
0602534|CC|Okay, Jack. We've completed our investigation of the comm, there. It all looked good. You can press on page 2-4.
0602547|LMP|Roger.
0602714|LMP|Say, Gordy, I see I neglected to pull the BAL LOAD circuit breaker when I went to - after going to high taps. You want me to go back and show you that again?
0602727|CC|Stand by.
0602738|LMP|That's the BAL LOADs breaker on 16, so the buses were tied together.
0602742|CC|Roger. I understand.
0602753|CC|Jack, there's no need to go back. Just keep on going.
0602800|LMP|Okay. Sorry about that.
0602803|CC|No problem.
0603140|CC|America, Houston. We're all ready for the E-MOD dump, if it's convenient to you.
0603218|CMP|Houston, this is America. I guess that's for me, isn't it?
0603224|CC|That's right, for Captain America.
0603228|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. We'll get her here.
0603239|CMP|Okay, VERB 74 ENTER.
0603246|CC|Okay, we're getting it.
0603252|CMP|Okay.
0603311|CMP|And, Houston, we have 50 percent remaining on magazine India India.
0603318|CC|Roger.
0603323|CMP|And they're all taken at 6 frames a second.
0603329|CC|Okay.
0603355|CC|Okay, America, we've got the dump.
0603404|CMP|Okay. Understand; you have the dump.
0603545|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 60 hours 35 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. LM checkout apparently going along quite well at this time. The bulky docking latch has been recocked and will be left in that position until redocking after lunar orbit insertion after the landing. Apollo 17 is now 53,438 nautical miles out from the moon. Velocity now 3,286 feet per second. Meanwhile, back at the Earth, the spacecraft is now 177,980 nautical miles from the Earth. At 60:36 standing by, this is Apollo Control.
0603734|CDR|Hello, Gordo. This is Geno. I'm - back on the line.
0603739|CC|Okay. Welcome back.
0603745|CDR|Yes, I was just testing out survival techniques in space.
0603751|CC|Roger. Did you survive?
0603758|CDR|Well, so far.
0603801|CDR|And we've got the LM back on CSM power.
0603805|CC|Okay.
0603830|CDR|Gordo, it's called education of necessity.
0603835|CC|Roger.
0603843|CDR|Okay. I guess the LM looked pretty good to you, huh?
0603848|CC|Yes, sir. It looked perfect. And we also went through the little communications main carrier sub carrier lockup check, and the - and the comm system worked perfectly, so there's no problems at all to report.
0603909|CDR|Okay, fine. We'll start in - with the - Jack donning the PGA, and then I'll follow him.
0603918|CC|Okay.
0604038|LMP|Gordy, how'd that ZPN turn out?
0604042|CC|Let me get another check, here.
0604121|CC|Okay, Jack. It looks fairly good right now. Don't bother changing anything.
0604130|LMP|Well, I'm just going to be in a position to work on it in a little while and if the occasion arises, I could.
0604140|CC|Okay, we'll keep that in mind, although it looks reasonable at the moment. It has shown some - at some times, it's gone to - from edge to edge on their scale but it's come back in right now.  I'll find out later if they want to do anything.
0604202|LMP|Okay, the - the electrolyte pads may be still expanding a little bit so I'm going off the air briefly to start getting into the suit. And I'll talk to you in a little while.
0604215|CC|Okay.
0605348|CDR|Hello, Gordo.
0605351|CC|Hello.
0605356|CDR|Okay. We're up to frame count 151 on magazine November November. They've been pictures of the - primarily of the CSM out the LM windows by the CMP.
0605413|CC|Okay.
0605419|CDR|He's been up there fooling around for a while. We may have to check it out and see what he did.
0605742|CC|America, Houston.
0605747|CDR|Go ahead, Gordo.
0605748|CC|That dropout there was because Ascension had a problem. We're now over on Madrid, and you're sounding good.
0605759|CDR|Okay.
0610114|CDR|Okay, Gordo. Jack is in his suit, unzipped at this time. I'm going off the air, and Ron will come on and keep you informed as to how we're going.
0610130|CC|Okay. Fine.
0610307|LMP|Houston. How do you read the LMP?
0610310|CC|Loud and clear, Jack.
0610314|LMP|Okay. I'm in my suit, presently unzipped. Didn't seem to be any problem at all.
0610322|CC|Okay.
0610407|LMP|And, Gordy, I think I found a problem with the biomed sensors. And when I come out of the suit, I can fix it. I put a little of that bacterial cream on the sensor places last night as a preventive mechanism, and I think it's just a little greasy to hold the sensor.
0610429|CC|Okay.
0610908|CMP|Okay. Gene's got his suit on and he's going across to the LM now.
0610912|CC|Roger, Ron.
0611526|CMP|Okay. This is CMP. I'll go off the line here, for a little bit, until I can get my suit on again.
0611532|CC|Okay, Ron.
0611536|CMP|And Jack's still on the line up there in the 124 though.
0611539|CC|Okay.
0611737|LMP|Okay, Houston. We're both zipped now, and it went quite easily.
0611743|CC|Okay, Jack. Sounds super.
0612103|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 61:21 Ground Elapsed Time. Position and velocity on the spacecraft now 51,982 nautical miles from the moon, velocity 3,288 feet per second, distance from earth 179,437 nautical miles. Crew completing their checkout of the lunar module, getting partially suited in their pressure garment assemblies or space suits, if you will, for the installation of the probe and drogue, and closeout of the tunnel into the lunar module. At 61:22 up and live on the air-ground circuit, this is Apollo Control.
0612938|CMP|This is CMP. I finally got my suit on now.
0612943|CC|Go ahead.
0612955|CC|America, Houston. Did you call?
0613002|CMP|No, I was just saying - the CMP. Got my suit on now. And I had a little trouble with the donning liners getting stuck - stuck in the zipper; but I figured out how to get them out of the way now.
0613016|CC|Okay.
0613840|CMP|Okay, Houston. Gene has his suit pretty well on now.
0613847|CC|Okay, Ron.
0613853|CC|We reviewed the data on the E-MOD. Everything looks normal. One thing you might do is - no big thing, but you might zero NOUN 26. It's still loaded, left over from the EMP you used in the P23 yesterday.
0613913|CMP|Okay. Thank you much.
0613948|LMP|Gordy, this is the LMP. How do you read?
0613951|CC|Loud and clear, Jack.
0613955|LMP|Say, when I was switching batteries, I noticed switching from low to high taps that there were some reverse-current indications. Sure that's nothing to be concerned about; you probably expected those, right?
0614013|CC|That's affirmative, Jack. That's normal.
0614019|LMP|Right.
0614938|PAO|This is Apollo Control. From all indications on telemetry here in Mission Control, the crew at this time have - has closed the Lunar Module hatch and it should be reinstalling the probe and drogue assemblies. And finally the Command Module hatch, thereby closing out the tunnel. Apollo 17 now 177, whoops would you believe our space digitals have gone back to Earth reference momentarily. At any rate the spacecraft is 177,966 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a velocity of 2,652 feet per second in - with reference to the Earth. And as soon as the space digital display goes back to the Moon reference, we'll read those numbers off. We're waiting for the call from the crew that they have completed stowing or installing the probe and drogue assembly in closing out the tunnel. At 61:51 standing by this is Apollo Control.
0615530|CC|America, Houston. We'd like to terminate the charge on battery B.
0615540|CMP|Okay; stand by 1.
0615544|CDR|Okay, we'll get that in a minute, Gordon.
0615546|CC|Okay.
0615849|CDR|Okay, Gordo, the charge should be terminated on BAT B.
0615854|CC|Okay.
0615856|CDR|And 7 Alfa's still - 7 Alfa's still 0.6.
0615901|CC|Roger.
0620402|CDR|Okay, Gordy, I - I'm looking around, but I can't figure out what that MASTER ALARM is. I didn't see any O2 HIGH FLOW and I didn't see any lights, and we did get it down in the LEB.
0620413|CC|Okay, Gene.
0620418|CDR|And there it is again.
0620422|CC|Roger.
0620430|CDR|And again.
0620434|CC|Roger.
0620435|CDR|Okay, I saw SPS PRESSURE blink on that one.
0620442|CC|Roger.
0620445|CDR|Yes, Gordy, she's triggering continually on SPS PRESSURE.
0620459|CDR|Yes. I can't reset it, and a minute later she's coming up with a blink on SPS PRESSURE.
0620512|CC|Okay, Gene. We think it's the - well - well, we - we're sure that it's the oxidizer pressure is right on the trip limit. We're almost certain it's due to helium absorption.
0620527|CDR|Yes, we're reading 155 right now.
0620531|CC|Roger.
0620826|CDR|Okay, Gordy. We got the SPS PRESSURE light on steady now.
0620830|CC|Roger.
0621525|CC|America, Houston. If you give us ACCEPT, we'll give you a new state vector. Nothing much wrong with the one you've got, but we're just going to tweak it up.
0621537|CDR|Okay, Gordy, you've got it.
0621539|CC|And one other question. Do you have the LM closed up now? We're seeing some heater currents that are a little hight indicating maybe the light's still on. And we're just trying to understand where the LM is at the present time.
0621557|CMP|Okay, I just closed the hatch, just about the time you started talking there.
0621602|CC|Okay, we'll take a look at the currents now.
0621803|CC|America, it's your computer, and we did the VERB 66.
0621811|CDR|Okay.
0622902|CDR|Say, Gordo, what's the trend in thinking on that SPS light - to leave it lit or to bump the pressure up?
0622912|CC|Well, I - Ed Mitchell must be at work, because we were just talking about that subject. I'll call you when they come up with a final decision.
0622926|CDR|Okay. And Ron has put the - has closed LM hatch. He's put the drogue in. He's put the probe in, and he's putting the CSM hatch in as a one-man exercise - suited. So he's doing the whole thing, and he's still in his suit. Our suits are stowed.
0622947|CC|Okay, Gene. We got one question here, that - just - just waiting for a convenient time to ask, and that was - wondered if, with reference to the wakeup problems we had this morning, if you'd clarify just exactly why Ron didn't hear our crew-alert MASTER ALARM. You know exactly why?
0623020|CMP|Well, it's not the Seconal. As much as I hate to admit it, the POWER AUDIO/TONE was OFF (chuckle) in my headset.
0623042|CC|Okay. We kind of suspected that - that one.
0623044|CMP|Okay; that lets you rest a little bit easier. And just to prevent something like that from happening again - or if it should happen again - what we'll do, we'll hook up the tone booster, which we didn't have hooked up last night.
0623102|CC|Okay. We concur. Sounds good.
0623122|CMP|Yes. I woke up and I saw that light there and I thought, "Gee-whiz, I just got it in time." Until I tried to push - push out that caution and warning MASTER ALARM. And burned my end of my finger.
0623133|CC|(Laughter)
0623150|CMP|I was also in a sleep restraint and upside down with a zipper in the back. And I had a little problem getting my hands up to start with, also.
0623201|CC|Roger.
0623240|CMP|Hey, Houston, CABIN REPRESS is back to BOTH now - I mean EMERGENCY CABIN REPRESS.
0623248|CC|Roger, Ron.
0623620|LMP|Gordo, if you don't have any objections, we'd like to ge ahead and secure the high gain, and go on to PTC while Ron's doffing his PGA.
0623633|CC|Let me check and see if we have any.
0623720|CC|Sounds good to us. Go ahead and, per Flight Plan, spin it up.
0623729|LMP|Okay.
0623734|CC|Okay, I didn't want to mislead you. I mean, you can get ready to spin it up. We'll give you the GO to spin up.
0623742|LMP|Okay.
0623905|LMP|Okay, Gordy. You want to leave the high gain until you call?
0623915|CC|Stand by.
0623924|CC|Okay. Jack, this is a good attitude to go to OMNI Bravo, and you can go ahead and secure the high gain.
0623933|LMP|Okay.
0624443|CC|America, Houston. The rates look good; you're GO for spinup.
0624450|CDR|Okay; great, Gordo; we're GO for spinup. We've - we've got a show in here that very few men have ever seen, and that's a CMP trying to get out of his suit by himself.
0624505|CC|Wish I was there to watch.
0624510|CDR|It really is a story to behold.
0624515|LMP|Needless to say, we're both very impressed.
0624519|CC|I can tell.
0624553|CC|America, Houston. Use B/D roll for spinup.
0624559|CDR|Okay.
0624631|LMP|Okay, Houston. This is the LMP on biomed. How do you read?
0624639|CC|Okay, Jack. Let's take a point check here.
0624709|CC|America, D-2 ROLL is not on. You need the Delta ROLL jet.
0624717|CDR|Yes, I'm still working on it, Gordo. I was just deciding whether to spin minus or plus; but I guess we ought to spin minus, as per the Flight Plan.
0624725|CC|Okay,
0624813|CDR|We're on our way.
0624817|CC|Okay. Okay, - the LMP's EKG and ZPN look good. And on the SPS light, we recommend not doing anything with the system. We want you to go to ACKNOWLEDGE so the - get the light out of your eyes, and then just fly there in ACKNOWLEDGE on the CAUTION and WARNING.
0624853|CDR|Okay, Gordy. We're in ACKNOWLEDGE, and - I presume, probably after LOI, we'll be able to go back to NORMAL, right?
0624908|CC|That's affirmative.
0624913|CDR|Is that an abnormal amount of helium ingestion [sic], or do you think that's about right?
0624919|CC|It's - it's absorption, and that's normal.
0625204|CDR|Hello, Houston. You read?
0625206|CC|Loud and clear.
0625211|CDR|Okay, now that we got another look at you, Gordy, it looks like Houston might be right on the fringes of either being clear or clearer. The entire Gulf is pretty nice. Florida looks pretty clear, and Mexico looks pretty clear. There's a big air mass of clouds that looks like it picks up somewhere around the coast at Houston, heads on up north, and then covers most of the Midwest and the East, from about the middle of Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia on north. It's clear enough now to even see the coral reefs down off of Florida. And it looks like west Texas is probably also pretty clear, at least in a run from east to west. We can see Baja, and on up the coast of California up north.
0625309|CC|Okay, sounds like the whole crew is turning into weathermen.
0625325|CDR|It's one of the better views we've had of the States, I think, even though we're quite a ways out.
0625346|CC|Roger. Looks like your subso - subspacecraft point is just about Peru right now.
0625357|CDR|Yes, we're - looks like we're looking straight down on the center of South America, pretty close to what you're saying.
0625447|CDR|Gordy, you want to bring us up to date briefly on how you plan on handling this time update again?
0625457|CC|Okay. I'll do that. Let me - but let me practice before I start here. Just a minute.
0625504|CDR|Okay. I'm primarily interested in those parts of the Flight Plan which we're going to eliminate.
0625514|CC|Okay. Just one second.
0625733|CC|Geno, I'll read you the PAO release; they summed up pretty well, and I'll just use their words here. The time has been made up in two increments. The first one of 1 hour and 45 minutes in the Flight Plan. The crew activities were jumped ahead by 1 hour, and they essentially began doing those things that were called for 1 hour later in the Flight Plan. They will again jump ahead an hour and 40 minutes, and that will occur at 65 hours. By that time they will have completed all those activities required up through 67 hours and 40 minutes in the Flight Plan. Or, in other words, they will have completed all the activities required to get them into lunar orbit 2 hours and 40 minutes early, and in order to make the clocks then agree with where the crew will be in the Flight Plan, we'll jump the clocks ahead 2 hours and 40 minutes. This clock update, which can be likened to going on daylight saving time, only 2 hours and 40 minutes worth of change instead of 1 hour of change as we do on daylight saving time, will occur at 65 hours when the crew will have completed all of those Flight Plan activities up through 67 hours and 40 minutes. (Chuckle) This simply involves setting our clock to 65 hours in the Control Center and aboard the spacecraft to 65 hours, moving them ahead to 67 hours and 40 minutes. Then, barring any further changes in the mission time line, from that point on, the elapsed time clocks, which are used as a cue to Flight Plan activities, should agree with the Flight Plan and events that, in the Flight Plan are called out for a certain time will happen at that time on the elapsed time clocks (laughter) in Mission Control and aboard the spacecraft. (Laughter) This is a convenience factor.
0625915|CDR|You're lucky; we're going to lose an OMNI.
0625919|CC|Okay. I'll hold off there for the rest.
0625925|CDR|Gordy, never mind. I think I got the gist of it.
0630413|CDR|Did you give up, Gordy?
0630419|CC|Okay. What we're really going to do is - (chuckle) really is simple. At 65 hours we're going to do the update of 2 hours and 40 minutes. And the procedures are shown in the Flight Plan at 67:35. There just happens - happens to be really no - no activities we have to reschedule in the intervening time. So, after the update is complete, we'll be right on the Flight Plan, both time-wise and activity-wise. Over.
0630505|CDR|Okay. We're looking at it. Going to have to squeeze my shave in somewhere else, I guess.
0630738|CC|Hey, Gene; Houston.
0630744|CDR|Go ahead.
0630745|CC|Hey, you got to break - you can cast the tying vote. Which is the best description: the water bag or the clock one?
0630810|CDR|Oh yes. Now I remember. You got a little - give a little credit on this last one, I guess, to - to Public Affairs, because I don't think Gordo could have thought that one up all by himself.
0630836|CC|Very diplomatic.
0630838|CDR|... Considering I - I was trying to do - to do Charlie's technique step by step, I guess I got to give him little bit more credit from the gymnastic point of view.
0630900|LMP|That sounded like one of Gordy's aircraft schedules.
0630906|CC|Amen.
0630918|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 63 hours 9 minutes.
0630926|CDR|... they were moving another Saturn V out on the pad.
0630937|CC|Jack, we lost all of that due to the antenna switch. Say again.
0630958|CC|Jack, we missed your last transmission - -
0631000|CDR|Gordy, you listening?
0631001|CC|- - due to the antenna switch.
0631006|CDR|You say you got it, or you're getting it?
0631009|CC|No, we missed it.
0631015|CDR|Okay. I said you can look right down at the Cape area - that's the Cape that we know - in Florida, and it's little disheartening because the last time I was up here looking back from this angle, they were moving another Saturn V for another Moon trip out on the pad already. But I guess they're working pretty feverishly out there on B.
0631119|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 63 hours 11 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Charlie Duke was on the spacecraft's communicators console for a while there, discussing the clock update description that had been read up earlier by Gordo Fullerton asking for a judgement on the part of the crew as to whether that description was better than - -
0631152|LMP|Gordy, this is Jack. I think Gene was right. You got some - probably scattered cloud weather, but not very far away from you there's a pretty heavy mass of clouds. It may be the forerunner of that dry cold front you were talking about yesterday, which I can see stretching over into Sonora. But where it hits the stateside, it's got quite a mass of clouds associated with it. It looks like they're moving in your direction.
0631224|CC|Okay, Jack, thanks for the warning.
0631230|LMP|Clear behind it, in Arizona and New Mexico and maybe southern Colorado, it looks like there may be another front stretching, or maybe it hits northern Arizona and Utah and up through northern Colorado, and on in to Canada, trending northeast.
0631257|LMP|You're calling it right on, Jack. I'm looking at the surface chart, and that's about what we see.
0631320|LMP|Looks like a low might be developing on that one - a wave up in northern Colorado and - although the clouds are a little hard to read.
0631331|CC|Roger.
0631341|PAO|And that was lunar module pilot, Jack Schmitt.
0631345|LMP|Our sub - or our zero phase point - About 20 degrees west of Bolivia, our sub - our zero - zero phase point, and it is quite a bit brighter than yesterday and looks as if, and more general, as if maybe the seas have picked up in that region a little bit.
0631418|CC|Roger.
0631426|PAO|Some more real-time weather reporting.
0631429|LMP|One of the more unusual features is developed - as I see - developed in the southeast Pacific just north of the Ross Sea and that is a very striking mushroom pattern on a very large scale. It has north/south clouds streaming streamers from the Ross Sea. And when it gets up about the latitude of Tierra del Fuego, but quite a bit west of that land, it branches out to the east and west in a large mushroom pattern. And, it looks like the top of that mushroom may be a curved cold front that's pushing its way up into the southeast Pacific. It currently - the eastern edge of that front is probably 10 degrees longitude from Tierra del Fuego, and it looks like that land in southern Chile is picking up high clouds, probably associated with that front's movement.
0631549|CC|Roger.
0631556|LMP|I'll get some shots of that next time around. That's a spectacular pattern. You almost get the feeling that the cold airmass moving out of Antarctica streams for a while north/south. And then it picks - The cloud patterns change and as it starts to migrate, the winds start to change from east to west, Maybe that's where it encounters the Jetstream.
0631625|CC|Roger.
0631804|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Going through an antenna switch at the present time.
0631929|CC|America, Houston. I have a couple of miscellaneous items here.
0631946|CMP|Okay; go ahead.
0631947|CC|Okay. We'd like you to disable B2 and D2 just for a drill here.
0631958|CDR|Oh, thank you, Gordo.
0632001|CC|Also, the SHe tank looks exactly nominal, as far as the rise rate goes, to us.
0632016|CDR|Can't argue with that.
0632019|CC|And to summarize your film budget situation, have three magazines: KK, LL, and MM are budgeted for the scheduled photos such that they have only five, 19, and one, respectively, frames left over after you've done all the scheduled pictures. And November November, we think, has just - has just nine frames remaining now. The two nonscheduled magazines are OO and PP; 160 frames each. Those are the ones provided for optional use. We have 44 additional frames scheduled out of November November, scheduled during lunar orbit. There is only nine left in it now, so we'd like to save at least 60 frames out of either Oscar Oscar or Papa Papa, the two optional magazines, to cover the scheduled frames. Guess what we're saying is there's no problem. We've still got plenty of film, but you will have to use some of your optional mags for scheduled pictures. Sixty frames is what we want to save.
0632158|CMP|Okay; mighty fine, Gordo. Plan on Oscar Oscar for that magazine.
0632205|CC|Okay.
0632304|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 63:23 GET. The space digitals display here in the Control Center still showing Earth to Spacecraft distance and velocity. Distance 180,309 nautical miles, velocity relative to Earth 2,593 feet per second. A few moments ago the lunar module pilot, Jack Schmitt, who is a professional geologist, put on his hat as an amateur meteorologist and described some of the global weather systems visible from their vantage point out beyond 180,000 miles from Earth. Still up live and standing by at 63:24 GET this is Apollo Control.
0633401|LMP|Gordy; this is Jack.
0633404|CC|Go ahead, Jack.
0633408|LMP|I - Cal Tech will never forgive me; I'm a little hesitant on my elementry optics. But I just put Ron's polarizing filter in front of the monocular, looking at the Earth and rotate 90 degrees, and from max to min in terms of brightness, there's a remarkable change. And I suspect that means that the Earth is polarizing light enough to see it. The main thing that happens is that the oceans get considerably darker when I rotate the filter towards the dark position anyway. The continents don't seem to show any obvious change, but the oceans and the zero phase point darken - oh, I would guess by a factor of two in brightness. Maybe that's an extreme, but I think it's that.
0633510|CC|Roger. I was just trying to think of a reason. is it uniform change over all ocean areas, or is it more of a change in some areas than others?
0633524|LMP|Well, I'd say that the subsolar point shows the greatest change, but you can still - the zero phase point shows the greatest change. But all the oceans get darker.
0633539|CC|Very interesting. We are just about to switch OMNIs.
0634200|LMP|Houston, 17.
0634202|CC|Go ahead.
0634206|LMP|Gordy, I figure you're getting an optics briefing ready for me, right?
0634211|CC|I haven't had anybody volunteer one. Strictly some layman theories going around, but nothing official.
0634225|LMP|Okay.
0634548|CC|America, Houston. Just got started on the Cowboy-Redskin game, about 5 minutes into it. The Cowboys are ahead 7 to nothing. They scored the first time they got the ball.
0634616|LMP|Gordy, you started talking before we had an OMNI. Try it again.
0634621|CC|Okay. The Cowboy-Redskin game just got started. It's now 7 to nothing, Cowboys. They scored the first time they got their hands on the ball.
0634638|LMP|Okay. I think we got most of that. It happened again, though.
0634645|CDR|Did you say it was 7 to nothing, Cowboys?
0634648|CC|That's what I said. They scored the first time they got the ball. It's - the game's just about 5 minutes old.
0634657|CDR|Outstanding. I thought this was Saturday. isn't - isn't today Saturday?
0634703|CC|It is, but the college is all through, so the pros are playing on Saturday now.
0634711|CDR|Beautiful. Seven to nothing, huh? Go get 'em, Cowboys.
0634720|LMP|But, he would say the same thing for Washington, I'm sure.
0634726|CDR|Nosiree. Go get 'em, Cowboys.
0634839|CMP|Houston, 17-
0634841|CC|Go ahead, Ron.
0634846|CMP|Okay, Gordo, my apologies on the CMP's in-suit drinking bag. There was, in fact, water in it. However, somehow, when we put the suit on, the water bag had gotten turned sideways, I guess, is the way to explain it. It had gotten turned sideways such that the suction tube was crimped sideways. And, as a result, there was no way that you could get any water to go through the tube.
0634925|CC|Okay. You're talking about the problem we had there just before launch, right?
0634932|CMP|That's affirmative - prelaunch.
0634936|CC|Okay, and for your information, the PTC looks good. It ought to hold.
0634946|CMP|Okay. Mighty fine. I lost my scissors. If there's anything you can do to help me find them, it'd be appreciated.
0634959|CC|Okay.
0635003|CMP|Okay (1aughing).
0635220|CC|Got a game plan update for you here. It's now 14-nothing, Dallas; still in the first quarter.
0635230|CDR|You're sure a bearer of good news, Gordy. That's great.
0635241|LMP|Gordy, I just - this is Jack. I just tried the red filter on the front of the monocular and about the only major thing I noticed was that the cloud patterns over the landmasses seemed to be enhanced. The contrast between cloud and land, particularly green land is enhanced. Otherwise, all it does is make the red - the Earth look a little red.
0635317|CC|Roger, Jack.
0635604|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 63 hours 56 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Space digital display still showing the Earth reference numbers 181,123 nautical miles out from Earth. Velocity 2,573 feet per second relative to the Earth. There will be a change of shift press conference in the News Center Briefing Room at approximately 4:15 with Flight Director Neil Hutchinson and at 63:56, standing by, this is Apollo Control.
0640413|CDR|Hey, Gordo; this is Gene.
0640432|CDR|Hey, Houston; this is 17.
0640437|CC|Roger, Geno. I think we've got you now. Go ahead.
0640501|CC|Okay, Geno. I think we got you - -
0640502|CDR|... 17.
0640503|CC|- - Now. Go ahead.
0640506|CDR|Okay. I just happened to be throwing a few switches, and I see our helium tank temperature on quad A is about 95 or so. And the others are quite low. is that because of our attitude there during - the LM checkout?
0640528|CC|That's affirm. That's the reason.
0640533|CDR|Okay. I also see the tank that - package temperature a little higher on that quad too. But, being close to a hundred it seems a little unusual. You're - you're happy, right?
0640546|CC|That's affirm. No problem. We've been watching it, and it seems to be coming down now.
0640555|CDR|Okay. Fine. Thank you.
0640907|LMP|Houston, you want the H2 HEATERS to AUTO and the FAN 3 OFF now?
0640929|CC|Stand by, Jack.
0640946|CC|That's affirmative, Jack. Go ahead.
0640954|LMP|Okay. That's done.
0641004|CC|Now 21 to nothing, Cowboys. Second quarter.
0641013|CDR|Super Bowl, here they come. Watch out now.
0641023|CC|Should remind you that the Commander in Chief is a Redskin fan.
0641033|CDR|I read about that. That's why the Cowboys need as much help as they can get.
0641052|LMP|Gordy, in the continuing saga of looking at the Earth through rose-colored glasses, I tried a blue-colored glass, and it - as you might expect, completely masks out the continent. The land areas are just not visible through the blue. Otherwise, the ocean and clouds - or the contrasting ocean and clouds remain about the same.
0641121|CC|Roger, Jack.
0641135|LMP|And, Gordy, I tried putting all the filters we had together to check the Sun for sunspots, but just not quite enough light attenuation to do that.
0641149|CC|Okay. For a while I thought you were a human weather satellite. Now I think you're a human Earth resources satellite.
0641201|LMP|Well, about all I can say is I'm a satellite I guess.
0641226|LMP|Gordy, it looks as if the distribution of water and ice in the ri - Ross Sea has changed in the last day or two. I didn't - don't remember looking at it yesterday specifically, but it seems to be different today than it was the first day.
0641244|CC|Roger.
0641949|LMP|Houston, 17.
0641952|CC|Go ahead, Jack.
0641957|LMP|Yes, about this icepack in the Ross Sea. The - as I remember a couple days ago, there were two clear areas, triangular in shape and quite elongate, that were projecting out into the sea from the innermost part of the bay, or of the - from the continent. Today those are not apparent, at least the first look I made. And it looks like there is an elongate, more irregular clear area that is roughly parallel to the Antarctic coastline within the sea itself. We'll check that a little more closely and see if that's right.
0642056|CC|Okay. Seems like kind of a quick change for something like ice, doesn't it?
0642106|LMP|Yes, and that's what bothers me. That's why I wonder if I'm not being fooled by cloud patterns or something.
0642113|CC|I'm looking at a satellite picture here, which I guess is around 12 hours old though. But over to the east of Australia, maybe about a continent width east of Australia, there is really striking long frontal system - striking because it's so long and so straight, sort of west-northwest, trending west-northwest and east-southeast trending. Can you see that?
0642333|CDR|Gordo, are you there?
0642336|CC|Yes, sir, right here.
0642341|CDR|Okay. Now Jack and I may be talking about two different frontal systems or patterns, but the one I think you might be referring to is the one I referred to yesterday as a ruffled parrot's beak. Actually two of them tied together, one starting up probably southeast of Australia and - and then heading down with a long arcing frontal system to another clockwise rotational parrot's - parrot's cone, I should say, down around - near the tip of South America, between it and Antarctica. There is one strong tributary front heading up to the north-northwest from the western side of this big, arcing, frontal mass. And I think that's probably what you're referring to. I'm not sure. I can't quite see Australia coming up over the - over the horizon yet.
0642453|CC|Okay. I - my picture cuts off right about the - oh, two-thirds of the way south in Australia, that latitude. So most likely we're talking about the same thing, but I can't verify the southern part of it.
0642515|CDR|There is some tremendous - western side of that curve front is a tremendous clockwise rotational airmass. It must cover hundreds of square miles. The one down near - near the continent of Antarctica, down there, near the tip of South America, seemed to be squashed slightly as if there is possibly some - some squashing or effect coming off - off the South Pole area near Antarctica. I think, if I turn around and look at it the way Jack was looking at it, it's a cap of a mushroom. Only instead of simply curving in underneath the cap, it has clockwise rotations on both sides as it curves under.
0642618|CC|Roger.
0642646|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 64:26 Ground Elapsed Time. The space digitals, meanwhile, has come back to Moon reference numbers. Our distance now from the Moon is 45,955 nautical miles. Velocity 3,300 feet per second. And the Earth is 183,365 nautical miles behind Apollo 17. Shift change press conference at 4:15 with Flight Director Neil Hutchinson. Chuck Lewis taking over now, with his team of flight controllers at 64:27 and continuing to stay up live on the Air-to-Ground this Apollo Control.
0642822|LMP|Gordy, I just took 2 pictures of the Earth at the present time, and those are, right now the camera is on frame 153.
0642838|CC|Okay; 153.
0642928|LMP|Gordy, where did you say your ATS satellite picture left off to the west?
0642934|CC|Okay. To the west, it goes clear on over to Africa. But to the south, it cuts off about 30 south, or not quite all of Australia.
0642954|LMP|Okay. Yes, that mushroom pattern we've been talking about, on either edge - either end of the cap - and the mushroom points north - is a major cyclone circulation system. And also taking - moving, in one case - or trending, in one case, to the northwest and the other to the northeast, there are linear cloud patterns. Gives it a very symmetrical and a striking appearance. I hope it shows on those pictures.
0643043|CC|Okay. It doesn't show on the one I got. Maybe a later version will have that one. Because it cuts - it's cut off on this one.
0643259|CDR|(Chuckle) Hey, Gordo. This is Geno.
0643303|CC|Go ahead.
0643306|CDR|To put this update in simple terms - at 65, I guess on our clocks, you'll update us to about 67:40, right?
0643313|CC|That's affirmative.
0643317|CDR|Does that mean we have to eat 2 hours and 40 minutes earlier?
0643325|CC|Oh, you got me there. I - You haven't been eating - you haven't eaten since breakfast. is that right?
0643332|CDR|Oh, yes, sir. We just finished. We'll take another go at it, but I feel I've spending my life here eating.
0643347|CC|Yes. Well, we'll leave it up to you on this special case here.
0643353|CDR|Okay, I think we'll take - a - a jab at supper here later in the day as per the Flight Plan.
0643400|CC|All right.
0643409|CDR|Gordy - the whole suiting operation - I was really very pleased with. Jack and I both got in our suits very easily. And one by one we went into the LM. And that's where we zipped each other up. And we really had little or no trouble. We took our time. We got all configured in terms of changing our pockets around and whatever else we needed to do. And, actually, I think it's much easier to get suited than it is to get unsuited, personally.
0643449|CC|Okay. Sounds good.
0643455|CDR|Ron stayed suited and did the entire tunnel work. And then went - did it by himself - and then totally doffed his suit and stowed it by himself, also, to sort of extend that little exercise.
0643513|CC|Roger.
0644322|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 64 hours 43 minutes. Change of shift News Conference is ready to begin in the News Center briefing room. We'll take this line down now and tape for the duration of the News Conference.
0644631|CC|America, Houston. Halftime score is 28 to 3, Cowboys.
0644639|CDR|Keep talking, Gordo.
0644642|CC|Okay, I'll keep talking (laughter). The - I've learned that when you get to the ALFMED and pull it there, you'll see some tape around the emulsion shields. Those are three rectangular areas in front of your eyes and to either side that contain the photographic emulsion. This tape is around the edges of each of those three areas to help seal out light leaks. You haven't seen it before. Leave the tape on there. Don't pull it off. Over.
0644716|CDR|Okay.
0644812|LMP|Gordy, just took a series of pictures of the Earth with the 35-millimeter using the polarizing filter in the two positions. And the frame count is now 39. I took six pictures. And with the filter, on the first of each pair, in the DOWN position. The second's in the UP position. And I changed the f-stop from - the first set at f/4, the second set at f/2, and the third set at f/8.
0644901|CC|Okay; we got all that, Jack.
0644906|LMP|And, Gordy, you might ask one of the experts around there in - is the lightmeter in the 35-millimeter integrating over the interior spot, or over the hairline spot? The larger one.
0644924|CC|Okay, I'll ask.
0644930|LMP|It acts as if it's the interior one, but ...
0644935|CC|Okay.
0644952|CC|Jack. The answer to your question is the center spot is weighted for 60 percent of the reading and the rest of it for 40 percent. Over.
0645004|LMP|Okay. That - that makes sense. That would explain why the needle moved as I moved it across the series of spots.
0645011|CC|Roger. Note: At 2 days 17 hours, the GET in the MCC was updated. To correlate times from this point on, add 2 hours 40 minutes to those shown in this transcript to make them correspond to MCC GET.
0674042|CDR|Gordo, we're - we're ready any time you are for that update. And after we get the TFM and everything squared away, we'll go into ALFMED.
0674053|CC|Roger. Stand by on that, Geno; and we'll be with you in a minute.
0674059|CDR|Hello, Robert. How are you today?
0674100|CC|Real fine, Gene. You're sounding great.
0674306|CDR|Doing great out here.
0674343|CC|Geno, we're ready for the clock update. We'd like P00 and ACCEPT. And we're got two loads to put in, so it will take a couple of minutes here.
0674355|CMP|Okay, you got it?
0674356|CC|Thank you, Ron.
0674526|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 67 hours 45 minutes. We have advanced the Ground Elapsed Time clock in the Control Center and on the Flight Plan are operating at the point indicated for that time. In the News Center, the monitors, the actual GET time will be shown on the Time Base 5 clock. The GET clock will now show the Flight Plan GET time. And in the Flight Plan, the Central Standard Times and GET times listed will now agree and be correct. We accumulated a few minutes of tape during the News Conference and we'll play that for you now.
0674608|CC|17, Houston. I've got an update on your flyby maneuver pad due to this clock update. Would you like to copy it?
0674620|CDR|Stand by just 1 second (music).
0674628|LMP|Okay, Houston. Go ahead with the flyby pad.
0674634|CC|Okay, stand by 1 on that - on our end. We're done with the - we're done with the upload. The computer is yours, and we need a read-out on the TFM.
0674646|LMP|Okay, that's in work.
0674655|CC|Okay, we've got the read-out.
0675005|CC|17, Houston. The data looks good, and you're GO to copy it, and recommend you copy it into the Flight Plan Supplement. And that's on page 1-43 of the supplement.
0675021|LMP|Okay, Houston. We have it.
0675149|CC|And, 17, we got that flyby pad now. If you're still ready, we're ready.
0675203|LMP|Okay. is this a full pad or just a change to the other one?
0675206|CC|It's just a change, Jack. It's a change to NOUN 83, the GETI, and a change to the bottom line, the GET of .05G. Just two changes.
0675229|LMP|Okay, go ahead.
0675232|CC|Jack, if you'll just add 2 hours and 40 minutes to each one of them, that's it. The GETI is 081:54:43.49. The GET of .05G, 156:04:03 - Jack, I guess I read 81. I was looking at the old pad. It's 83 - 083 - on the GETI.
0675310|LMP|You're too fast for me. I was just going to chew you out.
0675315|CC|Sorry about that, Jack. I got it around the room.
0675316|LMP|083 - (laughter) 083:54:43.49; 156:04:03.
0675329|CC|Roger.
0675408|CDR|Okay, Bob. We got all of our clocks set onboard.
0675414|CC|Roger. Understand.
0675418|CDR|What was the exact amount of that update time?
0675424|CC|Two hours, 40 minutes; 2 plus 40.
0675435|CDR|Okay, 2 plus 40, exactly. Thank you.
0675508|LMP|Okay, Bob. We're going to work up an appetite with the ALFMED today.
0675513|CC|Roger.
0675533|CDR|Hey, Bob. May be a little premature - but I don't think so - but I think there was some good thinking into that update, looking at the Flight Plan up until now and where we go from here. I don't think we - we overlooked a thing.
0675548|CC|Roger. Like I said the other night, we gave Tommy a gold star on that one.
0675554|CDR|Except I think he and Rita got in - in cahoots.
0675600|CC|A little soon for supper, huh?
0675605|CDR|Yes. We just finished lunch, and it's about time to eat again.
0675609|CC|That's known as the simulator step-ahead.
0675621|LMP|Can you give us our distance from the Moon - from the Earth?
0675628|CC|Roger. Stand by on that.
0675640|LMP|Are we about 5,000 miles closer now?
0675645|CC|Don't you wish.
0675650|LMP|Well, isn't that what - isn't that the way these step-aheads work?
0675654|CC|Normally, yes. But this one didn't work that way. Jack, you're at 183,000 miles. It's really amazing how time flies when you're interested in your work, isn't it?
0675836|CC|Jack, Houston. Did you read your - my last call with the distance?
0680137|PAO|This is Apollo control at 68 hours 1 minute. Apollo 17 is 183,211 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity is 2,521 feet per second. The spacecraft communicator now is Bob Overmyer. Stu Roosa the backup Command Module Pilot for Apollo 17 is also at the CAPCOM console with Overmyer.
0680427|CDR|Houston, 17.
0680430|CC|Go ahead, 17.
0680433|LMP|Okay, Bob, we're getting ready for the ALFMED. I just took a red-filter and a blue-filter pictures, - On frame 41 now, with a 35-millimeter - pictures of the Earth. And I took them one stop smaller - that is, more open - than the lightmeter said, hoping to compensate for the small Earth. The Earth just barely fills the most inner - the innermost circle of the spotmeter. Also, there's a very strong band of clouds, shaped sort of like a narrow fir tree, with a base about 20 degrees of longitude west of Baja California, that extends up, I believe, into the vicinity of Hawaii. And the top terminates in a very strong northern cyclone pattern.
0680536|CC|Roger, Jack. Was your magazine Sierra Sierra?
0680545|LMP|That's affirm. Sierra Sierra.
0680548|CC|Roger, Jack. And you say that cloud is right -that cloud area is right near Baja California? I've got a picture of it here in front of me, from one of the satellites.
0680558|LMP|No, it's about 20 degrees west - longitude degrees west of that.
0680605|CC|Yes. Okay, we've got it on the spot here.
0680607|LMP|And maybe even more than that. Okay, maybe even more than that. It's - it might be as much as 40 degrees west, and - Actually, Hawaii may be on the west side of that. It's a little hard to tell. It's close enough to the LM that it's hard to say.
0680640|CC|Roger, Jack. I think I've got it on our map here. It shows a pretty heavy dense cloud area right down in that area you're talking about.
0680711|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 68 hours 7 minutes. ALFMED is Apollo Light Flash Moving -
0680720|CDR|Okay, Bob. For the ALFMED, CDR will be in the left seat. CMP will be in the center seat with the ALFMED. For our reporting, when we get the VOX, we'll just call out our first names to shorten it and the comments following. And Jack will be recording.
0680743|CC|Roger. We'll be listening.
0680751|PAO|That's the Apollo Light Flash Moving Emulsion Detector, associated with the visual light flash phenomenon that most crews have reported on past missions, seeing points of light in their eyes, when their eyes were closed. There are a couple of theories proposed on the origin of the flashes. One is that they are caused by cosmic rays. The other is that they are high energy atomic particles which enter the eyeball or ionize upon collision with retina or cerebral cortex. The ALFMED is an emulsion plate device that Ron Evans will wear. It will cover the front and sides of his head and will provide information ontime, strength and path of particles penetrating the emulsion plates. The other two crewmen will wear eye shields. This test will last for approximately an hour. And the data on the - recorded by the ALFMED device will be correlated with the crewmen's verbal reports on flash observations.
0681052|CMP|Okay, wait a minute. Houston, how do you read on VOX with the lightweight headset?
0681055|CC|Read you loud and clear, Ron.
0681059|CMP|Okay.
0681112|CMP|Yes. Wait a minute. Let me get this little old box set to go here, first.
0681119|CC|Okay.
0681129|CMP|Yes.
0681200|CMP|Okay, UTILITY POWER is OFF.
0681210|SC|Yes. POWER switch is OFF. Okay, it's connected, now.
0681223|CMP|Okay, UTILITY POWER is ON. Okay, let me get strapped in here, somehow, or I'll float all over.
0681408|CMP|(Music) Okay, let's see.
0681421|CMP|Uh huh, I think I can.
0681449|CMP|Okay, my blindfold's going on, now.
0681509|CMP|Okay. Sounds like they clipped. Okay, somebody will have to help me put this thing on now; yes, just kind of - like so, yes. It goes around the old ...
0681618|SC|... yes, but you ought to ... kind of maintain your head in the same position, if you can.
0681719|CMP|... to operate now?
0681743|SC|No, Just turn it down a little bit.
0681818|CMP|Go to operate while you're taking the pictures there (chuckle).
0681845|CDR|Hello, Houston. CDR put his blindfold on at 68:18.
0681851|CC|Okay, we copy that.
0681857|CDR|And how do you read me in VOX, Bob? This is Gene.
0681900|CC|Read you loud and clear, Gene.
0681904|CDR|Okay, I'm conducting the experiment. And the - frame Sierra Sierra is now at 45. I got two shots. One - two from the side and two from the bottom.
0681921|CC|Roger. We copy.
0681926|CMP|Hey, looks like a countdown for ready to go, Jack?
0681935|CDR|Hey, Bob, does it make any difference if your eyes are opened or closed?
0681940|CC|(Chuckle) it may be a personal thing, Gene. I - This is Stu. I had to have my eyes closed but give it either way.
0681958|CDR|Okay; thank you.
0682007|CMP|Okay, we'll count down to start. 3, 2, 1 -
0682013|CMP|MARK it. It's buzzing.
0682037|CDR|Yes.
0682517|CDR|Change it. The other side is not very good.
0682525|CMP|... two.
0682608|CDR|MARK. Gene. I've got a series of random lines, which do not appear to be the width of my field of view, that are moving like a flashing horizon with thunderstorms on the horizon. They're dimly flashing, and they're moving across the eye from left to right and from top to bottom, individually. Both eyes. It's stopped now.
0682702|CDR|MARK, this is Gene again. Going from the upper left to the bottom right. Lines of the same sort of thing. Dimly lit flashing horizon-type flashes. But they're linear. They're linear, and they tend to come from the - either the upper left or the upper right and work their way downward. Now they've stopped. Both eyes.
0682848|CDR|MARK. Gene again. Both eyes. This time the same flashes on the horizon, but they don't seem to be moving out of both eyes. Tend to be up at the tops of both eyes. Just rapid, sequential, lightning-like flashes. And they've stopped.
0682957|CDR|MARK. Gene again. Similar type of flashes. They don't seem to be moving, but they're coming from the right of the right eye and from the upper left of the right eye. And I can actually see an outline of a - of a curved horizon, and the flashes are coming out from behind it. They've stopped.
0683037|PAO|This is Apollo control at 68 hours 30 minutes. Distance from Earth 183,910 nautical miles.
0683045|CDR|MARK. Gene again. I see - peripherally out of my right eye - I cannot see these flashes - but I can see peripherally the right-hand and upper-right-hand side of my right eye being lit up.
0683113|PAO|Distance 183,920 nautical miles velocity 2,504 feet per second.
0683146|CDR|Pardon? This last one? They were peripherally I couldn't see them all I know is that there was some light out peripherally out - yes - but a flashing glow. Oh man, there is a good one the left eye right in the middle it's almost a purple flash. It's still going right in the middle of my eye and it's coming out from behind a horizon that is almost. It starts out as a semicircle and then folds in to a point like on a pencil, and then it disappears. That's the horizon and the light is flashing from behind it. It's gone.
0683331|CC|Hey, Gene, Houston.
0683335|CDR|Go ahead.
0683336|CC|Okay. According to all our experts here, the phenomena you're describing is pretty much the phosphene effect - sort of like when you rub your eyes or squint your eyes too hard - because the effect is lasting too long. The streaks or the flashing that we're looking for are very fast, and they do not remain as a scene to your eye. And I guess the only thing we could say would be to maybe either relax your squint a little bit or to - if the blindfold's on exceptionally tight. I know this sounds kind of screwy, but those are the words that we would like to - like to say to you. But the actual phenomena we're looking for will be a very short-lived phenomenon. It will either be a flash or a very fast streak. Something along this - we're not trying to load the data, but we feel you're describing a different phenomena.
0683520|CDR|Stu, we lost all that last conversation. You better repeat it.
0683526|CC|Okay, Gene. Sorry about that, and here I thought I had waxed so eloquently. But the - the effect you're describing is an effect that can come from rubbing your eyes or perhaps squinting too hard. But the effect we're looking for - and I guess we're really not trying to load the data - but the effect that we're looking for is a very short-lived phenomena and would not - -
0683550|CMP|MARK. Ron. I got one. In the right eye, Coming from - back - going towards ... Very narrow streak.
0683610|CC|And, Gene, our only words of wisdom are try to relax the - the eyes a little bit or if you have the blindfold on exceptionally tight, you might work on that. But the - just - I guess sort of relax and see if we can see the other - the other phenomena.
0683628|CDR|Okay.
0683926|CMP|MARK, Ron. One about 12:00 in the right eye; looked like it was just a spot.
0684243|CMP|How about 15 seconds ago. It's so dim now I hardly noticed what it was. but, kinda started in the left eye and just a flash in the left eye and then a flash in the right eye, very dim. Going left, left to right.
0684438|CMP|MARK. Can't tell if it's right or left eye. Looks like it's almost between the two eyes. There's a -
0684447|CMP|MARK. One in the left eye. Just about right in the center. Spot; no streak or anything, just a spot. First spot seemed to be right between the two eyes, upper half of the field of view.
0684842|CDR|MARK; Gene. Streak from the upper right, of the right eye, down to about the middle.
0685023|CMP|MARK; Ron. About 8 o'clock ... diameter out, just a bright flash; it's the brightest flash I've seen yet. Left eye.
0685043|CDR|Just about a second or two after Ron said "Mark," I saw a vertical bright line in the left side of the left eye; just flashed.
0685136|CMP|It was the greatest intensity - the intensity on that last one I had - but - the brightness was there, but it was kind of dull glow to it. It wasn't a - a spot that you could really focus on.
0685321|CMP|MARK; Ron. Left eye, about 09:30, half way - -
0685328|CDR|MARK - -
0685329|CMP|- - to the left.
0685330|CDR|- - Gene. Left eye, very bright spot; left eye, left side about halfway in towards the middle. That was the brightest one I've seen, and it was just a spot.
0685358|CMP|Ron. The intensity of the last one I had was - oh, a fourth of the bright one I had before that.
0685417|CMP|Spot. Yes, on the left eye.
0685508|CMP|MARK about 5 seconds ago, about 6 o'clock in the right eye.
0685514|CMP|MARK. Right between the two eyes, seemed like. Both spots.
0685526|CDR|MARK; Gene. A sharp line from the center of the left eye to the upper left-hand - upper left-hand side.
0685641|CDR|MARK; Gene. It's a very short - very short line, upper left hand of left eye going towards the right.
0685710|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 68 hours 57 minutes. Apollo 17's distance from Earth is 184,548 nautical miles, traveling at a speed of 2,488 feet per second.
0685732|CDR|MARK; Gene. Upper right eye, tangential to my eye, just a very short line. Moving - -
0685744|CMP|MARK; Ron. Oh, a fourth of a diameter out in the right eye. Bright spot. Seemed like it was coming in. I could see the spot and then the streak. It went from that point kind of in - or up, I guess.
0685953|CDR|MARK; Gene. A dull flash on the bottom inside corner of the right eye. Correction - -
0690002|CMP|MARK; Ron. Go ahead, Gene.
0690003|CDR|Okay. Correction, Gene. That was on the left eye, that last one.
0690012|CMP|The last one for Ron was at 10 o'clock. Three-fourths of the diameter out. Just a - ... was only about an eighth of an inch in diameter. Right eye.
0690305|CDR|MARK; Gene.
0690306|CDR|MARK again. A flash - first flash was in the left eye on the left side. It went vertal - vertically up and away. And following that was a flash in the identically same spot. It was a line flash, up and away. On the left side of each eye, and it went up in both cases, but they were split by about 2 seconds.
0690841|CMP|MARK; Ron. A fourth of the diameter out at 3 o'clock in the right eye. I mean a half a diameter - half a radius; put it that way.
0690852|CDR|MARK; Gene. A flash across the bottom of the right eye coming inward from left to right.
0690912|CMP|On the last one, it looked like it was a - -
0690915|CDR|MARK; Gene. Just a spot flash in the bottom of the left eye.
0690927|CMP|This is Ron. On my last one, it was just a spot flash. No direction to it at all.
0690957|CMP|Ron; MARK, MARK; Ron. When I first said the word - it kind of looks like a - almost a sine wave transition from the corner upper at 10 o'clock in the right eye to about 2 o'clock in the left eye. Right between the two of them. The sin wave was - maybe two wiggles in it, and it was about a fourth of an inch long. Going from right to left, yes. And going into the left at about 2 o'clock.
0691056|CDR|Turn that music higher.
0691059|CMP|Yes.
0691120|CMP|MARK; Ron. Seems like I looked up, and as I looked up, there was one in the left eye about 12 o'clock just a flash. On the outer periphery.
0691534|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 69 hours 15 minutes. Apollo 17's distance from Earth 184,987 nautical miles. Velocity 2,477 feet per second.
0691802|CMP|MARK; Ron. ... down about 06:30; just a flash. Right eye.
0691842|CMP|MARK; Ron. Left eye, about 03:30, three-quarters of the radius out. A very dim flash. About 03:30.
0691944|CMP|MARK; Ron. Left eye. Starting at 5 o'clock on the circumference going to 3 o'clock at about three-quarter diameter - three-quarter radius, I mean. Just a straight line.
0692014|CMP|Did I say left eye? I guess I did. Okay, let's ...
0692111|CDR|Okay, the motor quit. Okay.
0692120|CDR|Is that it?
0692128|CMP|Yes, I can get that, Gene.
0692146|CMP|Okay, you want to take a picture of it first? Okay, POWER ... Okay, stand by. 3,2,1 -
0692200|CMP|MARK it. POWER switch is OFF.
0692228|CDR|Say, Bob or Stu.
0692231|CC|Roger. Go ahead.
0692235|CDR|Okay, add - to add to today. Not last night, but - I guess the first night I was in bed - I definitely saw some of these - because I had a hard time going to bed, to start with - I saw some of the same peripheral horizon-type things you said were not the type of data you were looking for; but I also saw a - some sets of the streaks. And probably the one most imposing thing I remember is - and the last one I remember before falling asleep - was the fact that there was a very bright spot that flashed right between my eyes like a very bright headlight - like a train coming at you, only with a flash. It's difficult probably to estimate the frequency of any of those because I was in a - sort of a sleep-hazy mode.
0692339|CC|Roger.
0692343|CDR|But then, as today, I saw some that flashed and lit up the horizon and some that lit up peripherally; and I guess, as you say, that's a different kind of data, but I did see them there and they impressed me.
0692400|CC|Okay. We got all that, Gene.
0692407|CDR|Okay.
0692408|CMP|And it might be interesting to know I've never seen it before today.
0692431|CC|Hey, Gene, we appreciate all the data. We were just trying to make the data fit the curve; you know the old trick.
0692440|CDR|Okay, I just wanted you to - just told them like we saw them. That's all.
0692447|CC|Roger.
0692452|CDR|I will say one thing, though; no question in my mind but that they're there. Last trip I took, I guess I just wasn't looking for them or paying any attention to them. Maybe they were there and I ignored them because of other things. But they're there.
0692511|LMP|Okay, all you flash bugs down there - or flashbulbs I guess is the word - frame 50. I just took four pictures to show - two on the side and two on the bottom - to show the position of the ALFMED, and one of them of each set was focused on the ALFMED. The others were focused on the other - the other set was focused on the struts.
0692539|CC|Roger, Jack.
0692548|LMP|And when you don't have anything else to do, why don't you have somebody predict where the S-IVB is. I think I've got her spotted - behind us and above us with respect to the Earth and our travel from it.
0692602|CC|FIDO just went out and shot himself, but we'll get working on it.
0692608|LMP|Oh, don't worry about it. Shoot. I thought you guys might have an idea off-the-cuff there.
0692613|CC|No, what's humorous on this, Jack, is they have really been working on that S-IVB impact point, and they've really been - it's been a - a real difficult problem for them so far.
0692624|LMP|I'll tell you, I bet you Ron could give you a star sighting on it (laughter). I looked at it through the monocular and sure looks like the S-IVB.
0692637|CC|Jack, we're not doubting you at all. We could probably start cranking it right now.
0692647|CC|Jack, are you sto - you all stowing the ALFMED now or are you done?
0692653|CMP|What's that, Bob?
0692654|CC|Are you all done with the ALFMED now, Ron?
0692659|CMP|Yes, I've got to get it to - get the plate moved back down there yet.
0692703|CC|Okay, Ron - -
0692704|CMP|... get the blindfold off first so I can see what I'm doing.
0692708|CC|Roger. I just want you to know. We've got a real long update coming up to you here on the LOI abort charts and that - and it's going to be, probably, a difficult readup. And you're the most familiar with the charts; you probably would want to take them. But whenever you want to take them, they are on - charts on page 3-81, 3-82, and then the cue card for LOI limits. Whenever you want to take them. It will be a lengthy one.
0692736|CMP|Stand by, Bob. Let us get squared away from the ALFMED; then we can get going on that.
0692741|CC|No, I don't want to hurry you, Ron. I just want you to know what - when - just get yourself comfortable and be ready to take them whenever you want them. It's going to be a lengthy time, though.
0692752|CMP|Okay.
0692754|CDR|Hey, Bob, I'm looking at what - what Jack was talking about; and it's definitely not a particle that's nearby because there is another one I can look at and get a three-dimensional comparison with. It is a - it is a bright object, and it's obviously rotating because it's flashing. It's way out in the distance, as I say, because there are particles that are close by and it's obviously not one of those. It's apparently rotating in a very rhythmic fashion because the flashes come around almost - almost on-time. And it's as we look back at the Earth, it's up at about 11:00 about - oh, maybe 10 or 12 Earth diameters. I don't know whether that does you any good, but there is something out there.
0692851|CC|Roger. We don't doubt it, Gene. And we might work out a set of gimbal angles or something here; maybe we can get a look at it through the optics.
0692903|CDR|Okay. And I - I - I just want to emphasize that it's definitely not - not one of these particles that tends to look like a star out there. It's something physical in the distance.
0692948|CDR|(Laughter) Oh, yes.
0693008|SC|... thing off.
0693014|CMP|Yes, guess I am.
0693029|CC|Hey, Gene. If you can call up a NOUN 20 so we know the spacecraft attitude, and if you can reference the object you're looking at out of your window, with - with respect to body axis and let us look at your - your - give us a mark, somehow, and give us your NOUN 20s, we can try and get a tie-in and start locating - locating this object down for you.
0693058|CDR|Okay, I'm looking it out - looking at it out the center window - the hatch window - and I'll give you a hack when it crosses the XX axis at the center window; and I guess it's up maybe 45 degrees
0693118|CC|Okay, give us a hack and we're copying your NOUN 20s right now.
0693126|CDR|Okay, Jack says pitched up about 30 degrees but - -
0693130|LMP|No. 45 because -
0693131|CDR|Yes, he agrees. It's 45 degrees pitched up, and I'll give you a hack when it crosses the XX axis.
0693152|CDR|Okay -
0693153|CDR|MARK it. It just crossed through the - -
0693156|CC|MARK. We got it.
0693157|CDR|- - let's call it the XZ plane of the spacecraft. One unique thing about it, Bob, is that it's got two flashes. As it comes around in - in rhythmic fashion, you get a very bright flash; and then you get a dull flash. And then it'll come around with a bright flash, and then a dull flash.
0693219|LMP|That's the side and - of the S-IVB - and then the engine bell, Gene.
0693234|LMP|The commander doesn't think that I can see the engine bell on that thing.
0693239|CC|Roger, Jack. is that with the monocular you're looking at it?
0693246|CDR|He couldn't see the engine bell if he had 10 monoculars.
0693254|CMP|Okay. I've got the cable restowed now.
0693300|CC|Say again, Ron.
0693311|CMP|And, Gene, where's your blindfold? ...
0693525|LMP|Bob, couple of revolutions ago when I was looking at it, I had a much brighter view and I believe I was looking at it broadside. It looks to me like it may be flashing more or less end-on now. It's much, not - not as bright, although it's getting brighter. But it's not as bright now as it was awhile ago.
0693550|CC|Roger, Jack.
0693616|LMP|... we've actually been noticing that, I think, for about 24 hours or so. I just - hadn't put it together as maybe being the S-IVB. I thought it was just some other particle out there.
0693628|CC|Roger, Jack.
0693631|CDR|Hey, Robert, what's the final Cowboys score?
0693635|CC|Okay; I was just going to update that. The Cowboys won it 34 to 24. And by winning it, they wrap up the wild-card slot in the NFC; and so both Washington and Dallas will be in the playoffs.
0693654|CDR|Sounds good.
0693717|LMP|Bob, that line of clouds I called a fir tree pattern that swings up towards Hawaii - Hawaii, if you will - has - also has a mushroom pattern on the top. It has the appearance as if two major air masses - one going from west to east and the other form east to west - have converged along that line, and the joint movement of air at the interface being south to north. And up in the area of Hawaii, I think, it tends to mushroom so that the pattern then goes back to flow from west to east on the east side and from east to west on the west side.
0693818|CC|Roger.
0693827|LMP|In a little while, we'll probably get a pretty good look at a - what looks like a very concentrated intense storm that, I think, is just - east - -
0693909|CMP|... And then we'll put them, once we get updated a little bit. Yes, I'll get out of VOX in a minute.
0694028|LMP|I was looking for the Flight Plan and stuff. And the little books.
0694050|LMP|Say, Bob.
0694052|CC|Go ahead.
0694111|LMP|Houston, 17. How do you read?
0694114|CC|Go ahead, Jack. Read you loud and clear.
0694119|CDR|Okay, Bob, you want to update the LOI card and Flight Plan 3-82 and 3-81; is that right?
0694131|CC|That's affirmative.
0694136|CDR|Which one do you want to start on?
0694139|CC|I would say 3-81 is the most difficult one to start on.
0694150|CDR|Okay, in that case, why don't you start on the board - on the cue card?
0694157|CC|Okay. We can start on the cue card. Your - your druthers.
0694203|CDR|Yes, go ahead. I'm ready.
0694205|CC|Okay, on the LOI limits. The VGO column - let's go right down the VGO column; I think that would be the easiest way to do it. Where it says, "VGO 2980," change that to "2986."
0694231|CDR|Why don't you just keep going?
0694233|CC|Okay. The next one going straight down the line, "2721, 2521, and 2316." That's, all the changes on the VGO line.
0694257|CDR|Okay; and all those changes were in Mode I?
0694302|CC|That's affirmative.
0694306|CDR|Okay, I got 2986, 2721, 2521, 2316.
0694313|CC|Roger. Now under the burn time column, the first one opposite the 2986, the burn time remains the same. Do not change that one. The next one changes -
0694335|CDR|Go ahead.
0694336|CC|Zero plus 40.
0694339|CDR|Which one is that, Bob? I missed you.
0694341|CC|Okay. Where it says, "0 plus 28," change that to "0 plus 40."
0694356|CDR|Okay, press on through them all now.
0694359|CC|Change the "0 plus 53" one to "l plus 10." Change the "l plus 31" to the number "l plus 40". Over.
0694418|CDR|Okay. I got - in order - burn time 0, and then 0 plus 40, 1 plus 10, and 1 plus 40.
0694426|CC|Roger. V-measured column: the first one, the zero does not change. The next one - in this order: "265, 465, and 670." Over.
0694455|CDR|Okay. I got 0, 265, 465, and 670.
0694459|CC|That's affirmative, Gene. That's the changes to the LOI limits cue card.
0694514|CDR|Okay, Bob, I think we got all that. I guess DELTA-V measured down there in the bottom - 2980, should be 2986, huh?
0694531|CC|Roger. We felt that wasn't - that - that is - correct. To be technically correct, it should be 2986 at that last one.
0694546|CDR|Okay, I guess we're coming in just a sukosh hotter, huh?
0694552|CC|That's affirmative.
0694605|CC|You'll see from the curves that we're going to have to update, that you're a lot closer to the free-return trajectory.
0694617|CDR|Okay, why don't you go ahead on 3-81?
0694622|CC|Okay, this is the tough one. The first thing we're going to do is plot a couple or three points here in the Mode I - 2-hour - the Mode I 2-hour line changes, also. So you might want to draw a line at a LOI DELTA-V DVM of 265, 265 and draw that straight up the curve. That'll be the no - the new--
0694655|CDR|Okay, the LOI DELTA-V magnitude of - DVM of 265 huh?
0694702|CC|Roger. That will be the crossover point from the Mode I 2-hour to the Mode I 30-minute.
0694854|CDR|Bob, are you there?
0694855|CC|That's affirmative. Go ahead.
0694904|CDR|Okay, Bob, I've got a - 265 vertical line drawn and I expect I can extend the Mode I 2-hour abort to that limit.
0694910|CC|That is affirmative, Gene.
0694914|CC|Now you're going to have a new curve, so don't bother to draw in the old curve. We're going to give you three points to plot and draw a straight line in between them that will create a new curve.
0694926|CDR|Go ahead.
0694927|CC|Okay. The first one is at - the point is defined with a DELTA-VM of zero and an abort DELTA-V of 1525, 1525.
0694950|CDR|Okay.
0694952|CC|Okay, the second point is defined by a DELTA-VM of 150; an abort DELTA-V of 1810. Over.
0695017|CDR|Bob, that last was 1810?
0695020|CC|That's affirmative.
0695037|CDR|Okay. I got it.
0695038|CC|Okay, and the last point is defined by DELTA-VM of 265; an abort DELTA-V of 2105.
0695059|CC|The curve defined by those three points will be your LOI plus 2 hours abort DELTA V.
0695108|CDR|Okay, and that - that last point is just the DPS available curve with 265.
0695115|CC|That's affirmative.
0695143|CDR|Okay, it's drawn in and I - -
0695146|CC|Okay, now we got a curve 1.
0695147|CDR|- - guess at 2 - Okay, go ahead.
0695153|CC|I'm sorry I cut you out. Did you have something else you want on that?
0695157|CDR|No, it's good. Our curve's in.
0695159|CC|Okay. Curve 1 is two points defining it. The first one is DELTA-VM of 265, abort DELTA-V of 1855.
0695226|CDR|Okay.
0695227|CC|And the second one is a DELTA - DELTA-VM of 400, abort DELTA-V of 2065.
0695255|CDR|Okay.
0695256|CC|Okay. Those two points from the curve 1 of the Mode I 30-minute.
0695304|CDR|Okay, I got it.
0695306|CC|Okay, now curve 2 has three points defining it. The first point is identical with the end point of curve 1. It's 400 on the DELTA-VM and 2065 on the abort DELTA-V.
0695329|CDR|All right.
0695330|CC|Okay, the second point is 530 for the DVM and 2245 for the abort DELTA-V.
0695402|CDR|Okay.
0695403|CC|And the last point is DVM of 670 and a DELTA-V - abort DELTA-V of 2475.
0695447|CDR|Okay.
0695448|CC|Okay; and if you draw a line up the page at the DVM of 670, that is the end of the Mode I 30-minute and everything to the right of that you are in Mode II.
0695554|CC|Gene, Houston.
0695603|CDR|Stand by, Bob.
0695604|CC|Roger.
0700013|CDR|Hello, Houston. Are you reading yet?
0700015|CC|Roger. Go ahead.
0700019|CDR|Okay, Bob, curve looks good. I just checked the DPS/APS crossover on the DPS available, and it comes out with what you gave me on the card - about 2521.
0700028|CC|Roger. And just one minor point. Across the top, on the velocity to be gained, you can bias all those numbers - add a six to every one of them across the top, to be technically correct.
0700051|CDR|Okay.
0700058|CC|The next thing we have on that, Gene - -
0700059|CDR|... correct, I could have done that before I - before I plotted the curve; but that's good. We understand, and we got it down.
0700108|CC|Okay. The next thing I've got is - that whole update column in the little block there is all updated; and we probably ought to get a readback on all these numbers, Gene. I can give it to you right like a regular pad, just from the - right down from the top to the bottom, and then read it back to me. I think that'll be the best way, don't you?
0700126|CDR|Okay. Ron's going to go ahead and take them; and we'll double check them, and he'll read them back.
0700131|CC|Okay.
0700132|CMP|Okay, just go ahead and start at the top and go down.
0700135|CC|Okay. I'm starting at LOI ignition time. 88:54:26.8. Pitch is minus 43, yaw 112. GET abort ignition, 89:24:26.8; roll 217, pitch 6, yaw 25. Minus 42 on the Pitch, 110 on the yaw. 216, 6, 18. High-gain angles again. Minus 75, Yaw 250; GET abort ignition there 90:54:26.8; 153, 17, 19. Next time there, GET abort ignition for the LM FDAI angles there - 90:54:26.8; Roll, Pitch, and Yaw angles, 202, 29, 330. Over.
0700350|CMP|Okay, Bob, here we go on the readback. I'll Just read them right down the line. 88:54:26.8; minus 43, 112, 89:24:26.8; 217, 6, 25; minus 42, 110; 216, 6, 18; minus 75, 250; 90:54:26.8; 153, 17, 19, 90:54:26.8; 202, 29, 330. Over.
0700439|CC|Roger, Ron. A real good readback. The - on the next page, on page 3-82, the data there is exactly the same as the LOI limit cue card - the changes. We can read it up to you individually or you can take it from your cue cards; your choice.
0700500|CMP|No, we'll change it from the cue card.
0700503|CC|Okay.
0700526|LMP|Bob, since they won't let me write anything, I tried looking for the Moon near the Sun with the filters and could not see it.
0700536|CC|Roger.
0700543|LMP|You sure you're sending us to the right place?
0700546|CC|Roger, Jack. Hey, I've got some information on that S-IVB that you're looking at. The azimuth was in - within 1 degree of what you called when we looked - checked out on your angles.
0700708|CC|Hey, Jack. Houston.
0700748|CC|17, Houston.
0700753|CMP|Go ahead, Bob.
0700754|CC|This was for Jack and Gene. The trench has computed the S-IVB location in reference to your body axis; and the azimuth was within 1 degree, very close, and the - we calculate it should have been out of that window at 62 degrees from the X-axis, and you reported 45 degrees, which is just a 17-degree error. It's real close there. You know, just eyebailing it like that.
0700823|LMP|That's great. Then that is the S-IVB, huh?
0700826|CC|Okay. Well, we - you might check it this way, Jack. Line up the star Denebola and Rigel - say again, Regulus; I'm sorry, Regulus - Denebola and Regulus. And then, on that line, go perpendicular to that line right above Ri - right above - right above Regulus, and that should be the S-IVB. It forms one point of a right triangle with Denebola and Regulus.
0700859|CDR|What you're saying is, it's the eye of Leo the Lion.
0700903|CC|That's affirm.
0700907|CDR|Except we can't see Leo the Lion very well.
0700911|CC|Okay.
0701016|CC|And, 17; Houston.
0701021|LMP|Go ahead.
0701022|CC|We've got a rather lengthy Flight Plan update series here. We can read up to you any time you want. Just a reminder that we are sitting here waiting with it. Your call.
0701046|LMP|Generally what is it, Bob?
0701049|CC|It's changing a number of attitudes all through the Flight Plan, 84:32 - 84:35; changing VERB 49 maneuver, things like that, due to the TLC change here on times and that.
0701109|LMP|Okay, where are you going to start?
0701111|CC|Okay, it's at 84:32. Standby 1.
0701124|CC|Jack, FLIGHT Just told me we can wait on this if you want until some other time in the Flight Plan. We want to get into this Experiment Checklist with the pa - pan camera, mapping camera film cycling. Or we can do both of them concurrently.
0701157|CDR|Hey, Bob, let's get the camera cycling out of the way first, and then we'll pick up the Flight Plan updates.
0701202|CC|Roger. We concur with that.
0701312|LMP|Okay, Bob, I'll get to that camera in just a second. The coast of Australia is starting to come into view. Still looks pretty clear. We'll give you more on that later, probably. That cyclone I talked about yesterday in the vicinity, I believe, of the Solomon islands, looks even better organized than yesterday. It's really tightening up. Starting to look very bright and dense right in the core, not too dissimilar from Therese. Although it has a little broader extent in the southeast quadrant.
0701356|CC|Roger, Jack. Trying to match that up in my prog here. I can't find it.
0701405|LMP|Well, you didn't have it there yesterday either. It certainly looks like a tight little storm now though.
0701412|CC|Roger. I understand.
0701425|CC|Jack, would you mind repeating that location of that.
0701427|LMP|Can't give you much on the progress - -
0701431|LMP|Well, I'll try to give it to you a little better later. It's the one I was talking about yesterday as being in the vicinity of the Solomon islands. That's somewhat east-southeast of New Guinea.
0701445|CC|Yes. Roger. I've got it.
0701509|LMP|I think before we go to bed, we'll probably be able to update the progress of the - that front south of Australia, also.
0701517|CC|Oh. Roger. I've - I've got a pretty disorganized area to the east of New Guinea. It's probably right over the Solomons. Looks pretty disorganized on our satellite photo - from, let's see, I guess that was this morning sometime.
0701539|LMP|Well, there is a lot of cloudiness in the equatorial regions, the intertropical convergence zone in there. This is south of that, sort of on a - I'll talk to you later.
0701559|CC|Roger.
0701901|LMP|Houston, how do you read 17?
0701903|CC|Loud and clear, Jack.
0701909|LMP|Okay, S-BAND AUX TV to SCIENCE.
0701914|LMP|MARK it.
0701926|LMP|Okay, SM/AC POWER is coming ON.
0701932|LMP|MARK it.
0701944|LMP|MAPPING CAMERA to STANDBY.
0701947|LMP|MARK.
0702013|LMP|PAN CAMERA POWER is POWER; barber pole - gray.
0702024|LMP|SELF TEST is to HEATERS.
0702032|LMP|And, do you want the high gain?
0702040|CC|That's affirmative. Minus 50 on PITCH and 270 on YAW.
0702127|LMP|Okay, there she is, all locked up. PCM RATE'S going HIGH.
0702135|CC|Roger.
0702139|LMP|Okay. When you're ready, I'll do the big deal here
0702143|CC|Roger. Stand by for my cue on that, Jack.
0702158|CC|Okay, Jack; we're ready.
0702202|LMP|Okay, MAPPING CAMERA - MAPPING CAMERA is ON.
0702207|CC|Roger. We mark it.
0702215|LMP|Okay; and PAN CAMERA SELF TEST - going SELF TEST. Got a barber pole.
0702337|LMP|And the PAN CAMERA SELF TEST - or talkback is gray.
0702341|CC|Roger. We'd like REACQ on the HIGH GAIN. Check.
0702352|LMP|You got it.
0702353|CC|Thank you.
0702356|LMP|Sorry, I didn't read the checklist.
0702439|LMP|MAPPING CAMERA is OFF.
0702444|CC|Jack, say your last.
0702448|LMP|MAPPING CAMERA went OFF at 2 minutes, and the PAN CAMERA POWER is OFF.
0702453|CC|Roger. And we'd like to select your checklist angles now on the high gain, please.
0702503|LMP|Okay.
0702524|LMP|Do you want those on the dial? You don't want me to try to acquire there, do you?
0702530|CC|That's affirmative.
0702537|LMP|Okay, SM/AC POWER is going to come OFF here, now.
0702542|CC|Roger.
0702549|CMP|Okay, SM/AC POWER is OFF; and how is my ZPN doing?
0702602|CC|Jack, say again your question, please.
0702608|CMP|This is Ron. How is my ZPN doing?
0702612|CC|Oh. Roger. Let me take a look here.
0702702|CC|Hey, Ron, we don't - we don't want to say it's bad, but we're glad you're talking to us because we want to make sure you're with us.
0702711|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. Let me ... a little bit then.
0702716|CC|Roger. We think we've got a bad skin - skin sensor interface there, Ron.
0702734|PAO|This is Apollo control at 70 hours 26 minutes. Apollo 17's distance from Earth 186,663 nautical miles, velocity 2,436 feet per second. This is Apollo control at 70 hours 27 minutes. We have another update on the S-IVB stage. Impact time and coordinates predicting an impact time of 89 hours 39 minutes 38 seconds at 4 degrees 21 minutes south, 12 degrees 12 minutes west.
0703035|LMP|Bob, how do you read 17?
0703038|CC|Read you loud and clear, Jack.
0703042|LMP|Okay; that storm I'm talking about - a little more precisely is maybe centered at 2 degrees latitude, north of the Solomon islands.
0703102|CC|Yes, that kind of matches up, Jack. Does it look like New Guinea and that is pretty well clobbered?
0703111|LMP|No, not really. New Guinea is at the western edge of a cloud zone that is part of that inter-tropical convergence zone that starts at New Guinea and swings east-northeast in an arc for about half the visible Pacific, and then that arc crosses back down over the equator and heads generally towards Central America, I suspect, although that's beyond the terminator now. The storm I'm talking about is clearly south and separate from that inter-tropical convergence cloud - pattern.
0703203|CC|Roger.
0703207|LMP|It's getting very tightly wound in the - the clockwise sense, and - and is - is just where there was a less well-organized pattern yesterday. Although maybe it's moved northward a little bit.
0703240|CC|Roger. We understand, Jack.
0703317|LMP|Our zero-phase point, Bob, is about 10 degrees - make that 15 degrees longitude east of the Solomons and has a - is a - fairly - low intensity at this time. I'll keep an eye on it as it approaches that storm area and see if it changes.
0703415|LMP|Okay - I'll be ready for them - Bob, just one last thing on that line of clouds that stretches up toward Hawaii. They're very - they look very thick and dense based on the structure you can see as that - as the terminator approaches them. They cast a pretty strong shadow to the west.
0703438|CC|Roger. I see those on our satellite photo. They look pretty - pretty thick in there. I'm strictly an amateur talking to you, Jack, but it looks pretty thick in there.
0703450|LMP|Yes, right.
0703455|LMP|How about some flight - when you come around again, can you start the Flight Plan updates?
0703502|CC|Any time you want them, I can start them.
0703506|LMP|Go ahead.
0703508|CC|Okay, the first one is at 84:32 in the Flight Plan.
0703536|LMP|84:22. Go ahead.
0703539|CC|84:32. 32. Add the following - -
0703543|LMP|Okay - -
0703544|CC|Roll right 12 degrees in parentheses, To a roll of 150. The purpose of this change is to avoid - -
0703602|LMP|Say again the - say again the number in parentheses.
0703609|CC|R, roll of 150, 150.
0703617|LMP|Okay, at 84:32, "ROLL right 12 degrees to roll 150."
0703624|CC|Roger. And in parentheses here, just a comment, it's to avoid gimbal lock during VERB 49 maneuver directly below it.
0703650|LMP|Okay; go ahead.
0703652|CC|Okay. At 84:35, the VERB 49 maneuver, change the attitude to "ROLL 320, pitch 010, YAW 324." And we want the high gain antenna angles: PITCH, minus 29; YAW 17. Over.
0703734|LMP|Okay. 320, 010, 324. High gain: PITCH, minus 29; YAW, 17. And that's at - that's for the VERB 49 maneuver at 84:35.
0703747|CC|That's affirm. And it goes without saying, scratch out - scratch out "OMNI Alpha" there.
0703754|LMP|Got you.
0703755|CC|Okay, the next one is at 85:42. 85:42.
0703803|LMP|Go ahead.
0703804|CC|This is just a couple of notes here. The P52 stars we got in the CMS are 16 and 17. Gyro torquing will take 10 minutes 47 seconds, 10 minutes 47 seconds.
0703835|LMP|Okay, the stars will be stars 16 and 17. Torquing will take 10 minutes 40 seconds - 47 seconds.
0703843|CC|That's affirmative, Jack. Okay, at 85:44, over there on the right where it says, "LOI REFSMMAT attitude," change that - "ROLL 064, PITCH 135, YAW 005." Over.
0703915|LMP|Okay, got you. Change is to ROLL 064, PITCH 135, YAW 005.
0703923|CC|Okay, Jack, and let's take a break here, and you can go ahead and secure the high gain and give me OMNI Bravo, and call me when you're ready for some more of these.
0704005|LMP|Okay, go ahead.
0704008|CC|Okay, Jack. The next one is an addition at 86 hours, 86 hours. We just want the following words: "Manually pressurize SPS." Over.
0704043|LMP|Go ahead.
0704044|CC|Okay; did you get that last one, 86 hours?
0704049|LMP|Roger. 86 hours, "Manually pressurize the SPS."
0704052|CC|That's affirmative. And just for your information, that's because we need a couple hours of data on it. Like to look at it a couple of hours prior to LOI. Okay, the next one's at 87:20.
0704114|LMP|Go ahead.
0704115|CC|Okay. Where it says, "Manual roll left to 30 degrees," change "30 degrees" to "63 degrees, 63 degrees. Change the roll angle - -
0704131|LMP|All right.
0704133|CC|-- from "050" to "001".
0704153|LMP|Okay, that's roll left 63 degrees and the roll is 001.
0704159|CC|That's affirmative. And the new high gain angles will be PITCH, minus 27; YAW, 339.
0704214|LMP|Okay, minus 27 and 339.
0704217|CC|Okay, just a little bit below that - where - at about 87:27 or 87:30, where it says, "Manually roll right 30 degrees," change the "30" to "63", 63. Change the roll to "064".
0704247|LMP|Okay, roll right 63 degrees. Roll will be 064.
0704252|CC|That's affirmative. And scratch out "OMNI Alpha" and add "High gain antenna: PITCH, minus 29; YAW, 17", YAW 17.
0704313|LMP|Okay. That's high gain: PITCH, minus 29; YAW, 17.
0704321|CC|Roger, Jack. And the next one is over at 89:03. We've got a comm attitude.
0704339|LMP|Okay, 89:03.
0704342|CC|Okay, that attitude there should - it's pretty close. ROLL 165, PITCH 060, YAW 338.
0704508|LMP|Go ahead, Bob.
0704510|CC|Did you get that last - the attitude change there? it's a real trivia change; we probably shouldn't have called it, but it's - -
0704516|LMP|89:03 ... to me.
0704517|CC|- - 165, 060, and 338.
0704520|LMP|89:03; excuse me.
0704523|CC|Roger. Did you get that attitude at 89:03?
0704530|LMP|Repeat 8 - 89:03.
0704534|CC|Roger. ROLL 165, PITCH 060, YAW 338.
0704551|LMP|Okay. New comm attitude: 165, 060, 338.
0704556|CC|Roger. That seems hardly worth it on that, Jack. Sorry on that one. Just one last note, general note on all this we gave you. Everything has been checked in the CMS. You probably figured that anyway.
0704611|CMP|Roger. Always know those fellows are working with us.
0704614|CC|Roger. And, Ron, we've got good data on you now.
0704619|LMP|Is that it?
0704621|CC|That's affirmative, Jack.
0704627|CMP|Okay; thank you, Jack.
0704643|LMP|Bob, Gene just told me I may have confused you on the clouds that I told you I could see near the terminator with a good shadow - and the shadow's on the eastern side as the - the terminator approaches.
0704704|CC|Roger.
0704940|LMP|Bob, how do you read 17?
0704945|CC|Read you loud and clear, Jack.
0704949|LMP|Okay, I mentioned earlier, I can't remember exactly when, that it looked like the wa - pattern of water in the Ross Sea - clear areas within the Ross Sea icepacks had changed, and I feel more strongly about that now. It looks like it's opened up considerably. The tri - long - elongate triangular areas, two of them that were there a couple of days ago, seem to have merged, and you also have clear water along most of the inner portion of the shoreline of that sea.
0705028|CC|Roger. Must be getting towards summertime down there.
0705033|LMP|Well, I'm very surprised that it's changed shape as much as that, and it could be that that triangular pattern was caused by a cloud bank that split what is now open water and made it look as if it was icepack.
0705051|CC|Roger. Understand.
0705109|LMP|Hey, Bob, can one of the guys there give me a - a hack on when - when the terminator should cross Hawaii?
0705121|CC|Roger. We'll work it out.
0705128|LMP|Do it in either GET or CST, either one.
0705133|CC|We'll crank it up to you in GET.
0705320|PAO|This is Apollo Control. It's 70 hours 53 minutes. Apollo 17 is now 187,288 nautical miles from Earth. The spacecraft velocity is 2,421 feet per second.
0705343|CC|Ron, we missed a NOUN 05 in there. Can you give us a NOUN 05?
0705356|CC|Ron, Houston. We missed the NOUN 05 on the data - can you give us what your NOUN 05 was?
0705404|CMP|Would you believe five balls?
0705407|CC|Oh, I'd believe that.
0705411|CMP|Okay.
0705412|CC|You can go ahead and torque, Ron.
0705416|CMP|Roger. Roger. We'll torque at 30 - 54 30.
0705424|CC|54 30, Roger.
0705617|CC|Jack, Houston.
0705621|LMP|Go ahead.
0705622|CC|Roger. We've been listening to the playback of the DSE tape from the ALFMED period, and all three of you sound pretty good on that. Gene is still clearer than the rest, but all three of you sound real clear and very readable.
0705641|LMP|Excellent. That'll make up for my note taking.
0705647|CC|Roger. And also, Jack. You had a question earlier about the different response of sea and continental areas when viewed through monocular polarizing filter, and I've got a note here from John Dietrich that kind of explains it.
0705708|LMP|Okay, let's hear what John has to say.
0705710|CC|Okay. This is pretty much referencing the time you were looking at it, and here it is. "Ocean scenes near the bright area off Bolivia, which is the spel - specular point, include a high proportion of polarized light. The spacecraft-Earth-Sun geometry now is approximately equal to the Brewster angle which is nearest 53 degrees, where maximum plane polarization due to reflection occurs. Therefore, a high response of scene brightness to changes of filter position can be expected. Continental scenes are dominated by Lambertian or diffuse reflectors, which are characterized by low proportion of polarization in the reflected beam. For such scenes, changing position of the polarization filter produces changes in scene brightness that are near or below the threshhold of detectability." Over.
0705813|LMP|Okay. That sounds very good. It's sort of like the contrast between the lunar surface response and - the oceans being more like that, I guess, and the - between the lunar surface and terrestrial land surfaces.
0705833|CC|Roger, Jack.
0705848|LMP|That's very good, very interesting. Thank - thank John for me. I should have thought about that, but I've been away from it too long.
0705857|CC|No problem. Okay; terminator over Hawaii at 73:45 GET.
0705909|LMP|73:45; thank you.
0710244|PAO|This is Apollo control at 71 hours 2 minutes. Apollo 17's distance from Earth now 187,507 nautical miles, velocity 2,416 feet per second. On Monday 80 foreign students who are touring space research science centers in the United States will begin a three day visit here at the Manned Spacecraft Center. They will observe the three periods of lunar exploration by astronauts Cernan and Schmitt and will also tour the facilities at MSC. This International youth tour began December 2 in Washington D. C. and is being conducted under the auspices of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration with the cooperation of the State Department. The student group saw the Apollo 17 launch at Cape Kennedy and since that time have toured the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Oakridge National Laboratory facilities in Tennessee. Today they're at the NASA Marshall Spaceflight Center in Huntsville, Alabama tomorrow they will tour the National Oceantic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Bureau of Standards in Bouider, Colorado. The students were selected by their respective governments in response to a NASA invitation, and they range in age from 15 to 17 years and rank high academically and have strong scientific interests. Following their visit to Houston the group will tour the NASA Ames Research Center at Moffitt Field, California and the jet propulsion laboratory in Pasadena, California. Schedules for the visit here at MSC and a complete list of the participating students, and countries may be obtained at the MSC news center. At 71 hours 5 minutes this is mission control, Houston.
0710546|LMP|Houston, 17. How do you read?
0710549|CC|Go ahead. Read you loud and clear, Jack.
0710553|LMP|Roger. Gene and I are going to stir your cryos - Gene and I are going to stir your cryos for you.
0710559|CC|Okay, we'll be watching for it.
0710921|CMP|Okay, Houston; Apollo 17 here. We have canister number 8 in the Bravo.
0710928|CC|Roger; 8 in the Bravo. We got it. You made EECOM happy tonight there, Ron.
0710937|CMP|Okay, and I'm still looking for my scissors.
0710942|CC|For your what?
0710947|CMP|My scissors.
0710948|CC|What did you do, misplace them? Or do you want me to look up and see where they're supposed to be?
0710955|CMP|(Laughter) No. They were stuck in the hand controller number 1. That little thing you're supposed to put the lap belt and things into. It was stuck in there last night when I went to bed, and I got up this morning, it was gone.
0711011|CC|Scissor, scissor, who got the scissor, huh?
0711012|LMP|... waiting for him to get up.
0711016|CMP|Yes.
0711021|CC|Well, I've got a - I've got a feeling they're still with you somewhere.
0711029|CDR|All sorts of things happened on his watch.
0711034|CMP|Yes; we won't talk too much about that.
0711530|CMP|Houston, are you watching Jack's EKG?
0711539|CC|Say again, Ron; we missed that.
0711544|CMP|Roger. Are you watching Jack's and my EKG?
0711549|CC|Roger. Let me punch the Surgeon here.
0711550|CMP|We're doing a little - we're doing a little bit of exercising, now.
0711556|CC|Oh, we can see that in the cryos. We know you're doing exercises. Let me go over and get the numbers here.
0711606|CC|Jack's at 120 on the heart rate.
0711613|CMP|Okay.
0711613|CC|And, Ron, you're about 90.
0711619|CMP|Okay.
0711622|CC|And, Jack - guess you can pass the word to Jack we refined that Hawaii terminator number through the Pacific fleet and called it all around. It is actually at 72:55 GET.
0711638|CMP|Okay. 72:65 GET.
0711642|CC|No, 72:55, 55.
0711646|CMP|Roger. 72:55 -
0711756|CC|Okay, Jack. We got you at 130 right now.
0712050|LMP|Houston, this is the LMP. What was the last number you saw on my heart rate?
0712100|CC|Okay, you peaked at 135, and we had you at 130 for several minutes.
0712110|LMP|Okay.
0712206|CC|Jack, just for interest, in that time you got banging around so hard there, you caused the heaters in the H2 to shut off. The - the pressure went up until the heater shut off.
0712219|LMP|Well, that's what you wanted, wasn't it?
0712220|CC|That's affirm.
0712225|LMP|Good thing there's not another mission or we'd have to flight plan this kind of thing for your EECOMs.
0712231|CC|That's right. Got to conserve at all cost.
0712239|LMP|Who's sitting on your right tonight?
0712242|CC|Got a big Moon over there.
0712246|LMP|He's always there, isn't he?
0712250|CC|Roger.
0712433|LMP|Say, Bob, I took another picture of the Earth and forgot to give you the GET on it. That was about 15 minutes before the end of the ALFMED experiment, if you can go back that way.
0712449|CC|Okay.
0712455|CC|Let me see, Jack. We - the last thing we had was right about the end of it. We had you in Sierra Sierra, frame 50. And you had four pictures then. is that before that or after that? Okay, those four were for the ALFMED, weren't they?
0712509|LMP|That's affirm. No, this was with the - the Hasselblad, the EL camera.
0712520|CC|Oh, okay; got you.
0712527|CC|We had FAO working on matching that one up.
0712533|LMP|Okay.
0712827|LMP|Houston, 17.
0712829|CC|Go ahead, Jack.
0712833|LMP|Roger. That weak front that I talked about south of Australia yesterday has moved north, but it looks considerably weaker than it did yesterday even. Just a very thin line of clouds - very thin line of clouds that now is touching the - the tip of Australia, south of Perth.
0713106|LMP|Houston, 17. I think maybe you dropped out before I said that little weak front moving north-northeast, south of Australia. The western end of it is just touching the coast of Australia, south of Perth, but it looks much weaker; and I, right now, would not expect very much weather out of it.
0713132|CC|Okay. That - I can't tie up with you on that one, Jack, because my prog doesn't go down that far; it only stays up in the landing area. And my satellite photo doesn't go down that far south either. So, I can't touch up with you on that one.
0713149|LMP|Okay. Well, it - it looked stronger yesterday, and it might have developed. Now there is a larger disturbance at the southeastern end of that front, still south of Tasmania; although, I suspect, unless it stays on a pretty northerly course, it will not affect the weather on the east coast of Australia very much.
0713215|CC|Roger.
0713304|CC|Jack, just thought you might be interested. I called some friends of yours in Tucson, and everybody's fine there and wanted to say hello and tell you everybody's fine and getting along real good.
0713320|LMP|Thank you very much. Good to hear. They've learned to take care of themselves pretty well, haven't they?
0713325|CC|They sure have. They - they're - they're having a little trouble with the squawk box, and we'll get working on that and it's - they're having trouble reading a little bit, but they're keeping up with us.
0713335|LMP|That's nothing new.
0713336|CC|Roger.
0713337|LMP|But try to fix it, please.
0713339|CC|Oh, we'll - definitely on that one.
0713358|LMP|Bob, Ron got you all - the Earth down there zeroed in in the sextant, and it puts my little binocular to shame. I tell you, it's a fine instrument. And I'll just confirm that the - that disturbance over the So - Solomon islands is an awfully tightly wound little storm system. And right now, I finally have seen New Zealand for the first time in a couple of days, for sure. And the South island's got some, probably high cirrus over it. North island looks pretty clear. That's the end that I can get right now.
0713436|CC|Roger. We saw you looking at Regulus there; we didn't realize you were looking at the Earth instead.
0713444|LMP|Ron's been looking for the booster. And he called me down and asked me to look at the Earth. He's been holding out on me.
0713450|CC|Roger.
0713454|LMP|Pass the torch of weather forecasting to Ron.
0713521|CC|Hey, Jack. I also have some words for you and Gene. Got some advice from the home front. The thing to do with Ron in the future is to hook up a Baby Ben and a metal dishpan. It works every time, if you want to wake him up.
0713542|CMP|No. I think that's not a good way.
0713557|CC|Ron, everybody's fine over at El Lago. They are doing great. Listening to every word.
0713606|CMP|Very good, Bob. Thank you very much.
0713616|CDR|Hey, Bob. We got two of those flashers out there. They could be SLA panels. I don't know. They're alike in intensity and pretty regular in the - in the intensity, bright and dim flashes they come out with, and they're widely separated. One is about the position we called at the first time; the other one is - oh, as I'm looking at the Earth, far to the left. Closer to the center window now.
0713651|CC|Roger.
0714106|LMP|Houston, 17.
0714112|CC|Go ahead.
0714117|LMP|Yes, Bob, what is your - analysis chart, if you have it - surface terms analysis chart show for Hawaii today?
0714141|CC|Stand by on that.
0714152|CC|Jack, according to the - -
0714153|LMP|The reason I ask is that for using your term - Go ahead.
0714157|CC|No, go ahead on that, Jack.
0714202|LMP|I was going to say, using your terminator time as a partial - mark for where Hawaii ought to be, Hawaii ought to be, it looks like that cyclonic circulation at the north end of the cloud bank I described, approaching that area, would be just about on the Hawa - Hawaiian islands. I'm curious if they're getting some weather down there now.
0714242|CC|Stand by right now; I've got my weatherman right beside me here.
0714250|LMP|Also, that major front we talked about last night as being east and south of Japan has progressed even farther and is, oh, maybe 20 degrees longitude - about 20 degrees longitude from the Hawaiian islands. And I'm making some guesses on exactly where Hawaii is.
0714325|CC|Roger, Jack. We've got nothing adverse in the Hawaiian area at all. Just a lot of winds, high winds and surface winds and surface roughness, but we don't have any bad cloud area in the Hawaiian area. I'll get the Hickam sequence report here shortly, Jack.
0714355|LMP|Okay, ... a little bit. The - our zero-phase point is now centered just a little south of the disturbance near the Solomon islands. And I see no distinct change in the intensity of that zero-phase point over what I had talked about a couple hours ago.
0714422|CC|Roger, Jack. The Solomon islands disturbance and everything is confirmed on this chart that I've got. It's very definitely confirmed in there.
0714432|LMP|Okay. Well, it's a lot more obvious today than it was yesterday; but even then it was showing pretty strong circulation. It is starting to wrap up, look very much like Therese did yesterday.
0714449|CC|Roger. I'm sure of that. The one right off of Vietnam is also pretty tight, isn't it still?
0714457|LMP|Well, we can't see that one yet.
0714458|CC|Okay.
0714508|LMP|Australia in general is still very clear except in the northeastern portions where it looks like they have got scattered clouds; but it looks like a pretty night - over Australia.
0714524|CC|Roger. Looks that way from the satellite photo from the last couple days. Looks pretty nice down there.
0714532|LMP|Right.
0714636|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 71 hours 46 minutes. Weather reporter, Schmitt, is 188,524 nautical miles from Earth and the spacecraft from which he is observing is traveling at a speed of 2,392 feet per second.
0714704|CC|Jack, in looking at the sequence reports for Hickam and Hilo and that area, it looks like they just got their standard 3500 scattered, 4500 broken clouds, maybe a rain shower or two. But just their standard tropical fluffy clouds.
0715233|LMP|Houston, Apollo 17.
0715235|CC|Go ahead, Ron.
0715240|CMP|Bob, I don't know whether I told you or not, but we ended up with the LMP and the CDRs suit in the bottom of this suit bag. My suit is in the top, and I sure don't have any idea how in the world the other crews got three suits in there. I guess they never did because these things are plumb full right now, of suits, in the suit bag. And it's a good thing we lengthened them. I don't have room for anything else inside the suit bag. The water bags and - you know - contingency water bags, and my g -suit, and those flight things are - I found a place to stick them all around the wall on the outside of the suit bag.
0715330|CC|Roger, Ron. Good work.
0715350|LMP|Bob, you made some comment earlier about the weather. It may have been Hawaii, but you broke up.
0715355|CC|Roger; I just got the sequence report for Hawaii, and Hickam had 3500, scattered; 4500, broken with minor rain showers; and Hilo had about the same. And basically, it's just their tropical puffy weather out there. The typical nothing. No frontal-type weather - no cyclonic-type weather.
0715419|LMP|Okay. Well, it may be just patterns induced by the - the wind currents, or maybe I don't have the position of Hawaii quite right.
0715429|CC|Well, it's - it's possible. You know they do have high winds out there, and I've seen it, just flying in that area in the past, where those broken clouds get pretty close together at times. It almost looks like a solid overcast. And especially when you look at it from an angle, they all blend together.
0715459|LMP|I hope you're going to save all those charts you're gathering together as we talk about it on this outbound leg. Be interesting to compare them and the pictures we take sometime in January.
0715514|CC|Jack, the Weather just was out here, and they told me that's exactly what they're doing. And if your time will permit in January, they'd like to go through and maybe help piece them all together, but they're going through these transcripts and they're gathering all their satellite pictures and plotting what you're seeing versus the satellite pictures etc., etc. And they'd like to go over it with you when you get back.
0715540|LMP|I'd love to do that. I hope, in general, we're getting the directions right. At least, I know I thought I'd worry about the descriptions, and it's hard to place points on the globe, particularly in the Pacific, if you can't identify land masses near them or have those nice little latitude and longitude lines painted on the Earth.
0715604|CC|Well, that's right. We'll - we'll put in a request for some lat - long lines out there.
0715712|CC|Jack, we're going to have a slight changeover from Goldstone to Honeysuckle at 72 hours, so we will probably break by.
0715725|LMP|Okay. Bob, you know you're just the last turn or so, you started to break up occasionally as if you might be getting a bad mike button or something.
0715736|CC|Okay, I'll check it out,
0720247|CC|17, Houston through Honeysuckle. How do you read?
0720255|CDR|You're loud and clear, Bob.
0720300|CC|Roger, sameo sameo.
0720812|LMP|Houston, 17-
0720816|CC|Go ahead.
0720820|LMP|I was just playing with the polarizing filter again, and it looks as if - when you have the knob on the filter parallel to the - roughly parallel to the polar axis of the Earth, - you get maximum darkening. And, of course, the opposite 90 degrees to that you get maximum lightening of the globe. And, in the - in the case of Australia, it also appears to lighten and darken, but not to the extent of the - of the ocean areas.
0720902|CC|Roger.
0720906|LMP|It could be that in the more desert climate you get finer grain material on the ground and give you the response that John Dietrich had talked about.
0720919|CC|Roger.
0721059|LMP|Houston, 17.
0721101|CC|Go ahead, Jack.
0721106|LMP|I rechecked that little story I was trying to give you about the ice pack there in the Ross Sea.
0721112|CC|Roger.
0721113|LMP|And whether I was right a couple of days ago or not - whether I was right a couple of days ago or not in the patterns, right now there is a lot of open water between the ice pack and the inner or, let's say, southern and south - eastern shore of the sea that I don't recall being there the other day.
0721145|CC|Roger.
0721149|LMP|I don't know whether you have any connections with all the Marines stationed in Antarctica, but maybe somebody knows what the ice pack's been doing the last few days.
0721200|CC|I'll - I'll see if we can find out, Jack. I don't think we've got any gates in Antarctica, though.
0721208|LMP|Well, that way you can't lose any.
0721211|CC|Roger. Well, they never stole the continent.
0721218|LMP|Sounds like pretty good duty, Bob.
0721440|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 72 hours 14 minutes. Apollo 17 now 189,167 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a speed of 2,377 feet per second. And, we're just over an hour away from the time that Apollo 17 will enter the lunar sphere of influence. Flight Dynamics Officer, Bill Boone, has re-computed the time for that event. That will occur at 73 hours 17 minutes 45 seconds.
0723111|LMP|Houston, 17.
0723115|CC|Go ahead, 17-
0723121|LMP|Yes, I - may have misled you earlier about a storm system south of Tasmania. It's - If there is one, it's just developing, and it's probably 20 degrees of longitude south. As I recall yesterday, there was some indication that a couple fronts were joining forces and moving in that direction. Today, the weaker and more western front appears to have dominated the system, and the only area where there seems to be cyclonic circulation developing is - is that point way south of Tasmania. That conceivably might move up and affect New Zealand in a few, in a couple days, but right now I don't see how it could affect Australia.
0723219|CC|Roger, Jack.
0724546|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 72 hours 45 minutes. Apollo 17 now 37 minutes away from entering the lunar sphere of influence. Present distance from Earth is 189,878 nautical miles, velocity 2,360 feet per second.
0725526|CC|17, Houston.
0725531|LMP|Go ahead, Bob.
0725532|CC|I just wanted to give you fair warning, Jack. In case you all feel a bump there when you're about ready to go to sleep there. At 73:17:45, you'll cross that magic line into the lunar sphere of influence.
0725550|CDR|What's the number, Bob?
0725552|CC|73:17:45.
0725603|CDR|Bob, do you read us?
0725605|CC|Roger. We read you loud and clear.
0725612|CC|We're reading you, Jack. How me?
0725617|CMP|You're reading Gene. How me?
0725620|CC|Okay, sorry. I'm reading - reading 17 loud and clear.
0725628|CDR|Okay, this is Geno. What was that number on the lunar sphere of influence?
0725632|CC|73 hours 17 minutes 45 seconds: 73:17:45.
0725646|CDR|Okay, Bob. You're a little intermittent. Anyway, what you mean is we start hauling the mail I gue...
0725656|CC|Roger.
0725700|CDR|I guess we hit our slowest point. How fast are we going now?
0725743|CC|Gene, you're pretty slow today. You're at 2,354 feet per second.
0725753|CDR|Yes. That's - that's quite a drop from the 35K that the S-IVB put us on.
0725801|CC|That's for sure.
0725808|CDR|Say, Bob. What do you hear from my home front? Anything?
0725818|CC|Talked to Tracy a little while ago, and she's listening to the box quite often and enjoying it, and everybody's fine there.
0725830|CDR|Bob, you're continuing ... We're getting every third word.
0725852|CC|Gene, do you read me any better on this one?
0725911|CC|17, Houston.
0725915|CDR|Go ahead, Bob.
0725917|CC|How do you read me now?
0725923|CDR|I think you're still ... off.
0725925|CC|Roger; you're breaking up on us, too. Let's check it through here a minute.
0725931|CDR|Okay.
0725943|CC|We were wondering who was going to be wearing the headset tonight, Jack. Who's got the duty?
0730010|CC|17, Houston.
0730433|CDR|Hey, Bob. You reading us now?
0730509|CC|17, Houston, did you call?
0730514|CDR|I just wondered if you're reading us now, Bob.
0730519|CC|Roger. Reading you now loud and clear. I was just off a minute there, talking to Barbara on the phone. Everybody's fine on the home front, Gene.
0730529|CDR|Okay, what did you say Tracy said earlier?
0730531|CC|She just said she's tickled pink and listening - listening on the squawk box.
0730544|CDR|I guess that's the way a 9-year-old daughter should be in a case like this, huh?
0730547|CC|That's affirmative.
0730553|CDR|In case she's not listening, tell her not to forget to feed the horses.
0730556|CC|Roger. Barbara said I should find some nice young female voice around here to tell you she loves you, good night. But I figure we'd better not do that.
0730614|CDR|Okay; enough said. I guess what we don't need right (chuckle) right now is a nice female voice.
0730627|CC|I'm sure of that.
0730637|CDR|We're just happy, health - healthy, hungry, and homesick.
0730647|CC|You got a lot of work to do, and you better not say you're hungry. The doctor about went through the overhead over here when you said that.
0730656|CDR|That's a cliche.
0730659|CC|Roger.
0730709|CDR|Bob, just in general, how is the spacecraft looking to you? Pretty good, I hope.
0730722|CC|That's affirmative. We - we haven't found anything I guess we're - stopped getting those spurious MASTER ALARMs here for a while. So that - that was the only witch hunt we were having right there, was trying to find that.
0730741|CDR|Yes, they disappeared. The ones we've had recently seem to be real ones.
0730746|CC|Roger.
0730754|CC|Hey, guys, we were just still trying to figure out who is going to wear the headset and got - who has the duty tonight?
0730803|CDR|Oh, I'll wear it tonight, Bob.
0730807|CC|Is that Gene?
0730811|CDR|Yes.
0730812|CC|Okay.
0730825|CMP|And, Houston; 17. You ready for some onboard read-outs?
0730829|CC|You better believe it.
0730835|CMP|Okay. BAT C, 36.8; PYRO BAT A, 37.0; and Bravo is 37.0. RCS Alpha, 93, 91, 91, and 94. Over.
0730858|CC|Roger. Got them all, Ron.
0731138|CMP|Houston, we're cycling the H2 FANs, now.
0731147|CC|Roger, 17. Go ahead.
0731153|CMP|Okay. We're cycling the H2 FANs.
0731200|CC|Okay; we copy.
0731812|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 73 hours 18 minutes. Apollo 17 has just entered the lunar sphere of influence and the distance velocity displays here in the Control Center are now referenced to the Moon, Apollo 17 is 33,803 nautical miles from the Moon, traveling at a speed of 3,355 feet per second.
0732330|PAO|This is Apollo control at 73 hours 23 minutes. On it's present trajectory and without doing a lunar orbit insertion burn Apollo 17 would reach it closest approach to the Moon at a Ground Elapsed Time of 88 hours 58 minutes 12 seconds. The distance of that closest approach would be 53.48 nautical miles and spacecraft velocity at that time would be 8,198 feet per second. We expect the crew to settle down into an 8 hour rest period here very shortly. On the flight plan that rest period due to begin at 73 hours some 24 minutes ago. We do expect that the crew will shortly go into that rest period.
0734309|CDR|Hello, Houston.
0734314|CC|17, Houston. Go ahead.
0734320|CDR|Okay, Bob, we're going to turn out the lights now and hit the sack.
0734328|CC|Okay. Have you gone through the presleep checklist, getting ready on the comm and all that?
0734340|CDR|Yes; that's affirm - the presleep checklist. ... one.
0734405|CC|We're not getting any biomed data on - supposed to be on Ron, I guess. We're not showing any biomed data.
0734422|CDR|Houston, do you read 17?
0734425|CC|17, Houston. How do you read me?
0734430|CDR|Yes, I'm reading you, Bob. What did you say I might want?
0734433|CC|You might check the sensors on Ron, We're not getting any biomed data. is he unplugged?
0734441|CDR|Well, that's because he's - Yes, he's unplugged. Give him a chance to get hooked up and change some leads here.
0734447|CC|Okay,
0734449|CDR|Everything else - the presleep check - the presleep checklist is complete. I'm going to leave the comm cap on tonight. Our tone boost doesn't work, so I'll just be on comm all night.
0734533|CDR|Do you have any biomed on Ron?
0734540|CC|Stand by on that, Gene.
0734707|CDR|Good night, Robert.
0734710|CC|Good night, Gene.
0734715|CC|Got a busy day tomorrow, and we'll - we'll be with you then.
0734923|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 73 hours 49 minutes. We said goodnight to the crew at 73 hours and 47 minutes and we don't expect any more conversation with them tonight. Flight Surgeon is now receiving good biomedical data from the Command Module Pilot, Ron Evans. We'll leave the line up for a few minutes in case there are any postscripts to the air-ground and if not we'll take the line down and come back up hourly with reports. But for the moment we'll leave the line up live. This is Apollo Control. As the crew turns in the spacecraft is 32,741 nautical miles from the Moon, velocity 3,362 feet per second.
0740445|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 74 hours 4 minutes. Apollo 17 now 32,264 nautical miles from the Moon, velocity 3,366. The crew has settled down for the night and we'll take the lines down now and come back up with hourly reports.
0745000|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 74 hours 50 minutes. Gene Kranz and the white team of flight controllers are preparing to take over duties in the Mission Control Center, relieving the orange team which has been directed tonight by Chuck Lewis. This has been a relatively quiet shift. A major activity was the medical experiment to gather more information on light flashes that most Apollo crews have seen with their eyes closed. We also updated the Ground Elapsed Time clock during this shift, moving it ahead 2 hours and 40 minutes, this being necessary to bring the Greenwich mean time Ground Elapsed Time in the flight plan into agreement. These areas had not agreed because of the late launch. The crew reported seeing the S-IVB in the distance at one time during the shift. The spacecraft entered the lunar sphere of influence at 73 hours 17 minutes 45 seconds, and we said goodnight to the crew at 73 hours 47 minutes. 6 hours 8 minutes remaining in this rest period now. There will be no change of shift news conference when the shift breaks at midnight - no change of shift news conference. In its present time, Apollo 17 is 30,705 nautical miles from the Moon, velocity 3,378 feet per second. At 74 hours 52 minutes this is Mission Control Houston.
0753707|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 75 hours 37 minutes. Flight director Gene Kranz and the oncoming white team of flight controllers have been going over the status of the mission and find everything progressing very smoothly at this point. No anomalies in the performance of the spacecraft. All systems in very good shape and we're either up to or slightly ahead of the flight plan values on consumables at this point. During the shift a number of the flight controllers will begin working on some of the data the crew will use on awakening to place the spacecraft in lunar orbit, that event scheduled to occur at about 88 hours 56 minutes, and the retrofire officer and the flight dynamics officer will be busy during this shift working out some of the preliminary numbers that'll be used in the lunar orbit insertion maneuver. There is still no decision as to whether or not midcourse correction 4 will need to be performed and we suspect that that decision will also be made later on during this shift. At the present time Apollo 17 is 29,152 nautical miles from the Moon, and the spacecraft velocity is now 3,391 feet per second. This is Apollo Control Houston.
0763705|PAO|This is Apollo control at 76 hours 37 minutes. Now about 4-1/2 hours away from the scheduled crew awakening time, the flight surgeon reports that the crew appears to be resting comfortably at this time. Command Module Pilot Ron Evans is wearing the biomedical harness during this sleep period. And Commander Gene Cernan has the watch wearing the headset that would receive any call from the control center. Apollo 17 is 27,178 nautical miles from the Moon. And we're watching the velocity gradually build up under the growing affect of lunar gravity, up now to 3,411 feet per second. This is Apollo control Houston standing by at 76 hours 38 minutes.
0773701|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 77 hours 37 minutes, continuing to maintain the watch while the crew aboard Apollo 17 gets some sleep - Now about 3-1/2 hours left in that sleep period and that could be extended by 30 minutes or so if a decision is made not to make the final midcourse correction before going into lunar orbit. We expect to be getting a reading on the necessity for that midcourse correction which in any event will be a very small maneuver, before this shift ends. The midcourse correction opportunity occurs at 83 hours 55 minutes in the flight plan and the Flight Dynamics officer has gotten what appears to be a good final indication of the impact coordinates for the Saturn third stage. The latest coordinates are 4 degrees 11 minutes south and 12 degrees and 23 minutes west. Apollo 17 at this time - 25,131 nautical miles from the Moon. The spacecraft velocity 3,434 feet per second. This is Apollo Control at 77 hours 38 minutes.
0783710|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 78 hours 37 minutes. There's been no change in the spacecraft status during the past hour. Everything continues to function normally and we have about 2-1/2 hours remaining in the crew's sleep period. The flight dynamics officer reports that we've got a midcourse correction if it's performed prior to Lunar Orbit Insertion of about one half foot per second or less and that very small maneauver, if performed, would occur at 83 hours 55 minutes. Apollo 17 is now 23,112 nautical miles from the Moon and the spacecraft velocity up to 3,460 feet per second. We'll see that increase to somewhat in excess of 8,000 feet per second as the spacecraft reaches the Moon and swings around the Moon goes into orbit. The Lunar Orbit Insertion Burn removes on the order of 3,000 feet per second from that velocity. A lunar orbital velocity of about 1 mile per second. The flight surgeon has noted some stirrings of a bit of an elevation in the heart rate of Ron Evans, who is wearing the bio-medical sensors during this sleep period, although for the most part Evans has been sleeping soundly. At 78 hours 39 minutes, this Apollo Control, Houston.
0793710|PAO|This is Apollo control at 79 hours 37 minutes. Now about an 1-1/2 away from the scheduled time for crew awakening. And it has again been very uneventful, very quiet sleep shift. With the flight controllers here in mission control monitoring spacecraft systems. Everything continuing to perform almost perfectly as planned; everything nominal. And our flight dynamics display at the present time is showing the spacecraft distance related to Earth, Apollo 17 now 198,800 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a speed again with respect to Earth of 2,168 feet per second. After awakening the crew's major activities during the day include jettisoning the scientific instrument module door which exposes the scientific instruments in the spacecraft's service module to the lunar environment. Lunar orbit insertion is scheduled to occur at about 88 hours 56 minutes. The Saturn third stage will be impacting the lunar surface. And there's still a possibility of a final midcourse correction prior to lunar orbit insertion. That midcourse correction to occur - if it occurs at 83 hours 55 minutes. And we expect that we will have a decision or recommendation from the flight dynamics officer within the next couple of hours as to whether or not that midcourse correction will be required. If it is done, it will be a very small maneuver performed with the reaction control system thrusters on the CSM. At 79 hours 39 minutes this is Apollo control Houston.
0804101|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 80 hours 41 minutes. We have about 18 minutes remaining before the scheduled crew awakening time, however, we're planning to give them at least an additional 15 minutes of sleep and perhaps 30 minutes additional. The Flight Dynamics officer hopes to delay a decision on the need for midcourse correction 4 until additional tracking data is available. That maneuver, if its performed, remains very small - on the order of a half foot per second. And the decision revolves around what height of approach pericynthion we'll have with or without the maneuver. Tracking data right now shows that Apollo 17 will be approaching the Moon with a pericynthion of about 52 nautical miles - the desired pericynthion is 53-1/2. And the FIDO would like to get a bit more tracking data before making that decision. So we'll be putting off the decision as to whether or not to awaken the crew or give them more sleep time until the last possible moment. Apollo 17 at this time is 18,839 nautical miles from the Moon and the velocity up to 3,500 feet per second. We've seen no signs of activity aboard the spacecraft. The Flight Surgeon will begin to note increased heart and respiration rates on Ron Evans, who is wearing the bio-medical sensors during the sleep period and before receiving a call from the crew we'll see the voice sub-carrier come on and we'll be watching for any of those cues. If it appears that the crew is indeed up and about we'll bring the lines up and standby live or as soon as the decision is made to send them a wake-up call we'll come up and standby live. At 80 hours 44 minutes this is Apollo Control.
0812505|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 81 hours 25 minutes. We are planning to put a call through to the crew in about 5 minutes to awaken them. And, Apollo 17, at this time, is about 17,350 nautical miles from the Moon. Spacecraft velocity is about 3,567 feet per second. After awakening the crew we will be discussing a minor problem that has been noted during the sleep period. This involves a heater - a heater cycling in one of the three cryogenic hydrogen tanks that supplies hydrogen to the fuel cells. The nature of the problem is a heater that is cycling more often than normal. These heaters are controlled by a pressure-sensitive switch in the tank. As the temperature within the tank drops and the pressure drops, the switch senses this and activates the heater to bring up the temperature and hence the pressure within the tank and ensure a constant flow of hydrogen to the fuel cells. The sensor appears to be responding to a much narrower range of temperature decrease that would normally respond to about a 20 degree excursion in temperature and it is now apparently responding to about a 2 to 3 degree temperature excursion, and therefore cycling more rapidly than would normally be the case. This in itself is no concern, however if the automatic cycling should fail, if the automatic cycling function should fail, it would require going to a backup manual mode whereby the crew would be instructed to turn the heaters on and off at certain intervals to maintain the proper pressure in the tank, which, by the way, is a mode of operation that has been used on previous missions and works very well with a minimum impact to the crew time. And, as mentioned at this point we would see no reason for having to go to a manual mode. That would require some subsequent failure. This situation, however, will be discussed with the crew and they'll be advised as to the procedure that would be taken in the event that subsequent failure should occur necessitating the manual activation of the heater within this one tank. And we are now about 1 minute 50 seconds away from the scheduled awakening time, having given the crew an additional 30 minutes of sleep. The flight dynamics officer expects to give us a GO or NO/GO for the midcourse correction prior to lunar orbit insertion in about a half an hour at some 82 hours Ground Elapsed Time. We'll continue to stand by live for that call to the crew.
0813028|CC|Apollo 17, Houston. Did you call?
0813100|CDR|Good morning, Houston, Anybody there?
0813103|CC|Okay, good morning. It's LOI day, Apollo 17.
0813111|CDR|Hello, Robert. You gave us an extra half hour.
0813114|CC|That's affirmative. We're presently still debating on midcourse 4, Geno, and at the present time, it's small, about a half a foot per second. We're expecting a final decision on whether it's necessary or not in approximately 1 hour at 8 - 82:30. We'll let you know then, but it will be small, and so we decided to give you an extra half hour of sleep.
0813141|CDR|Okay, Bob, without me having to look it up, when will it come if it comes?
0813148|CC|Stand by. 83:55, so we'll give you about 1 hour and 25 minutes advance notice.
0813200|CDR|Okay. Well, we'll start stirring around.
0813206|CC|Okay, give me a call when you want to talk to people.
0813955|LMP|Hello, Houston.
0813956|CC|Hello there, 17. Good morning.
0814002|LMP|I'm not sure we're ready to talk yet, Bob, but I just thought you'd like to know we got a pretty spectacular view of - of Africa today. We can see the Sinai, can see the Red Sea, the Sea of Aden, and for the first time I think we can not only see the Mediterranean, but we can see the - most of the Southern European countries, Turkey and Greece and up into italy and some of those places, can't quite see Spain because you're just about on the horizon. And for the most part, it looks like the weather throughout the Mediterranean and Northern Africa looks pretty good.
0814046|CC|Okay, we're copying that. And, if you guys are willing to do a little switch flipping this early in morning, we'd like you to turn on the pan camera heaters, which means if somebody's down there in that vicinity, it's SM/AC POWER, ON, and the SELF TEST switch to HEATERS. Over.
0814108|LMP|You want the SM/AC POWER, ON, and the SELF TEST switch to HEATERS?
0814112|CC|That's affirm.
0814116|LMP|Okay, we'll get that.
0814118|CC|Okay.
0814129|SC|Okay, we got both of those.
0814133|CC|Gee, I didn't wake you up, did I?
0814140|LMP|Well -
0814843|CDR|Okay, Bob. The LM/CM DELTA-P is 0.6.
0814849|CC|Okay. Copy that. Sounds good.
0820040|CMP|Hello, Houston; Apollo 17. How do you read?
0820043|CC|Loud and clear, 17. We're with you.
0820048|CMP|Okay, we didn't get you there for about 5 minutes, Bob, with good up-link signal strength. Were you guys having a problem?
0820056|CC|No, not that I know of. We were getting a lot of noise down here, and we seem to think that you guys were prob - assumed you guys were turned away from us or something. But we're with you.
0820110|CMP|No, you might think about that one a little bit. We had a very strong up-link - signal strength, as good as right now. And Gene was trying to call you, off and on, for several minutes and we didn't get any response. But sounds real good now.
0820125|CC|Okay, sorry about that.
0820131|CMP|Hey, Bob. Good morning. It's a good chance to talk to you for once.
0820135|CC|Yes, for once, yes. Talk to me now this next hour and I won't talk to you again for another 3 or 4 days, Ronald.
0820143|CMP|(Laughter) Okay.
0820146|CC|Nice to be able to talk to somebody for a change -
0820148|LMP|Bob, your friendly medical officer -
0820151|CC|Go ahead.
0820156|LMP|Go ahead, if you've got something to say.
0820202|CC|Speak.
0820206|LMP|Okay. Your friendly medical officer has all the good words starting with the CDR and the food. Are you ready to copy?
0820215|CC|Ready to copy.
0820224|LMP|Okay. It was a big day yesterday, eating-wise. CDR had sausage patties, pears, and cocoa for breakfast. And a quarter - one-fourth cheese spread, one-half bread, and one-half cereal bar, and one orange beverage for lunch. Tomato soup, half a hamburger, half mustard, vanilla pudding, and an orange-pineapple drink for dinner.
0820300|CC|Okay, copy that.
0820312|LMP|... 5 hours of good sleep, and two more containers of water.
0820324|CC|Okay, 17, I got the CDRs food and then you broke up, and I got 5 hours of sleep and two containers of water. Was there something between?
0820336|LMP|That's firm, your - his PRD reading, 17032.
0820343|CC|Okay, copy that.
0820354|LMP|And I think, Bob, we're coming around different OMNI, so I'll wait on the rest of it.
0820359|CC|Roger, That's affirm.
0820653|LMP|Okay, Houston; 17. How do you read now?
0820655|CC|Okay, read you again; go ahead.
0820702|LMP|Okay, for the LMP, the food eaten - Well, let's see, I guess it's a tossup: eaten versus not eaten, so I'll give you what I ate. Sausage patties, grits, pears, pineapple-grapefruit drink, coffee, and let me make a note that the package of peaches in that pack had been - was broken in the package. Also, chicken - I had chicken soup, ham, bread, orange drink, and four bacon squares. For dinner, I sort of ate some leftovers and grape drink, corn chowder, chocolate pudding. And I've had - well, stand by. The PRD reading: 24080; and 7-1/2 hours of very good sleep last night. I took a Seconal in order to get to sleep, and I've had 1 and 1 or - 2-1/2 containers of water since last report.
0820835|CC|Okay, copy all that, Jack.
0820846|LMP|Okay, the CMP, the chowhound of the kennel here, had: sausage, grits, fruit cocktail, orange beverage, and coffee. He had ham, cheese spread, peaches, cereal bar, and orange-pineapple drink. Later on, he had tomato soup, half a hamburger, half mustard, vanilla pudding, sugar cookies, grape drink, and tea. And he has a complaint this morning, much like mine, that his apricot package had broken in the bag; and, although not too significant itself, it makes everything else pretty sticky.
0820936|CC|I copy that.
0820945|LMP|Okay, CMP medical is 15031 PRD; he had 7 hours restless sleep, and he'd like a comment from the doctors on how that looked on his biomed; and he had a Seconal, and he's had four containers of water.
0821008|CC|Okay, we copy all that one also. Jack, you guys still going to fit in your space suits?
0821020|LMP|If you'd stick around - you'd know we tried those on yesterday.
0821025|CC|Roger; copy. Tried to talk to you guys yesterday morning, but I didn't quite make it there, there was a problem apparently some place.
0821037|LMP|That's all right, we're stuffing him with food so he can't sleep.
0821042|CC|Okay, and the comment concerning Ron's sleep from the Surgeon, Jack, is that he was restless the first hour and had periods of restlessness during the night, but we logged him for about 7 hours of sleep also. But we did see periods of wakefulness, some of which were maybe up to 10 minutes long.
0821107|CMP|That sounds about right; that's good, thank you. If I can't tell how long I'm awake and, you know, how long you were really asleep.
0821115|CC|I'll tell you, Ron, if you wake up during the night, you might sit there and stare at the second hand then maybe you could count and tell how long you're awake.
0821125|CMP|(Laughter) Okay.
0821132|CC|Okay, we owe you guys a consumable update - update. And on RCS consumables, your RCS fuel remaining is still 1.4 percent above the Flight Plan; that's a slight improvement over the 1.3 percent from yesterday.
0821218|LMP|I guess everything else is about like yesterday. Is that right, Bob?
0821222|CC|Roger. The consumables are still about the same. And if you guys will wind your watches, we'll consider the postsleep checklist finished.
0821233|LMP|Okay, and Geno has got his null bias check for you.
0821236|CC|Okay, Roger on that. We're waiting.
0821244|CDR|Okay, Bob, made two checks over a period of 100 seconds. One was minus 99.0 and the other was minus 98.9.
0821256|CC|Okay, we copy minus 99-0 and minus 98.9? Geno.
0821307|CDR|And - -
0821310|CC|And we'd like OMNI Charlie, please there, 17.
0821525|CC|And, Apollo 17; Houston. We'd like to recommend you go SQUELCH, OFF, at this time, if you haven't; and we'll keep calling you the OMNIs to change as you rotate there. Over.
0821541|LMP|Okay, Bob, we've been flying normally with it enabled; maybe you think that's the problem.
0821551|CC|Stand by on that and, while we're thinking about that, can we confirm that the only medication you've had is a Seconal for you and a Seconal for Ron, and nothing for the Commander?
0821606|CDR|This is Geno, that's right; I did not take any Seconal last night. One thing I wanted to talk to you about though, I - I took one antigas pill after breakfast, I took one after supper, and I took one prior to going to sleep, which were probably within an hour apart. If you've got a better solution than those gas pills, I'd sure like to hear it.
0821636|CC|Understand that, Gene. We'll get back with you, I guess, on that later.
0821719|CC|And, Jack, as far as turning the SQUELCH, OFF, they do believe that we're better with that for margins and general management at this distance with the OMNI. As soon as we plot a PTC and go on the high gain, we'll be much better off.
0821738|LMP|Okay, Bob.
0821846|CC|And, 17; Houston. You can do without your water dump now. We're in good shape. We'll dump at 94 hours.
0821858|CDR|94 hours. Okay.
0822012|CDR|Bob, does that mean we can go ahead with the urine dump on schedule?
0822018|CC|Say again there, Geno, on the urine dump.
0822044|CC|Say again, Geno, on the urine dump.
0822050|CDR|Roger. Can we press on with it on schedule?
0822053|CC|That's affirmative, sir. It's Just that we don't need to do the water dump, that's all.
0822057|CDR|Oh.
0822059|CDR|Okay, fine.
0822440|LMP|Hello, Hou - Houston; 17. How do you read?
0822443|CC|Roger. We have you back again, 17.
0822449|CDR|Okay. We may play the S-band squelch by ear, a little bit. We got an awful lot of noise when you guys drop off the line. So, if that's all right, we'll just use it as required. Also, I'm on frame 163 on the Hasselblad, and I just completed two pictures of the Earth about 5 minutes ago. And there's one that I did not report late yesterday at about 72:30 GET. A set of two pictures of the Earth.
0822538|CC|Copy that.
0822545|CC|Say again that time. Was that 78:30? You were sleeping then.
0822555|CDR|Negative. That was 72:30.
0822558|CC|Okay. Copy that. And part of the reason we had a little problem that - this - this last time, Jack, was we planned to call the OMNIs and we didn't get the word around down here. And we didn't call the OMNI to you in time. We're still planning on doing that, and I think we'll be more coordinated next time.
0822625|LMP|Okay. We'll bear with you.
0822641|CC|And, Jack, I presume that's magazine November November.
0822652|LMP|That's affirm, Bob.
0823023|CC|Omni, Charlie, 17 please.
0823040|CMP|You got it.
0823235|CC|And, Apollo 17; Houston. For your information, we are scrubbing midcourse 4; and you can stay in PTC until 83:30, which will be about when you start to get ready for LOI anyway. We'll give you a call on that.
0823332|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Apollo 17 now 14,948 nautical miles from the Moon. And, CAPCOM, Bob Parker, just advising the crew that we will not require a midcourse correction prior to lunar orbit insertion. The flight dynamics officer had been reviewing tracking data and establishing another vector, as he calls it, on the trajectory based on that last vector and it appeared that a midcourse correction of something less than a half of foot per second would be required, if performed. And flight director, Gene Kranz, made the decision to cancel the midcourse correction prior to lunar orbit insertion.
0823430|LMP|Hey Bob, we're about three quarters of the way through eating. You got some news for us?
0823437|CC|Stand by. I'll see. Did you catch the midcourse-4 scrub?
0823444|LMP|Yes, sir. Apparently, you're not getting some of our acknowledgements.
0823448|CC|Okay, must be. Captain Young here wants to tell you that it's raining outside; and the paperboy apparently hasn't come in yet. OMNI Delta, please.
0823513|CDR|I'm surprised he didn't get his papers delivered before he came in.
0823518|CC|Roger. I suppose I should apologize to all the paperboys after saying that, but the news is still being put together for you guys. And - stand by.
0823554|CC|And, Geno, some advice to you on the gas pills. I guess - suggestion down here from the Surgeon is that one thing we ought to be sure to do is chew the pills thoroughly. It apparently is - helps in their effectiveness quite a bit; and Dr. Young, beside me, also suggested if you're chewing chewing gum, you might cut down on that a bit because he thinks this might be causing some gas.
0823629|CDR|Thank you.
0823641|CDR|I might add that both of those alternatives have been - worked on.
0823647|CC|We thought probably so.
0823713|LMP|Bob, although we're getting close to concentrating our attention on the Moon, it doesn't decrease the interest in looking back at the patterns of activity we can see on the Earth. That storm I talked about yesterday that was in North Africa, looks like it has left that area and has moved in - maybe, if it's there at all, it's just over the - Iberian Peninsula, and maybe Gibraltar and that area is getting a little activity today.
0823802|CC|Okay; copy that, Jack.
0823803|LMP|It does not look very well organized, but - it's not very well organized right now, but - it's right out on the LM, and it's hard to get a good view of it.
0823817|CC|Okay.
0823818|LMP|The storm I guessed yesterday - I thought might be moving into the Cape of Good Hope looks like it's dissipating and also staying south of that area. The whole of Africa is essentially clear, except in the southern part of the intertropical convergence area where there's scattered patches of - of fairly dense clouds. They're probably getting scattered rain showers of some kind in there this morning. Some of those extend farther south than I've - than we've seen them - down into South Africa. There's a - On one of the earlier revs, although now it's at the terminator, it looked like there was a depression developing about 30 degrees longitude, east of Madagascar in the middle of the Indian Ocean. A little bit northeast of Madagascar, there's also a new area of clouds developed that looks like it's getting organized into a cyclone pattern.
0823932|CC|Roger. OMNI Alfa, please.
0823941|LMP|Okay, you got it.
0823942|CC|Thank you.
0823951|CC|Okay. And, Jack, while you guys are finishing your lunch - your breakfast there, excuse me - Are you all on your headsets?
0824004|LMP|Yes, sir. Go ahead.
0824006|CC|Okay. Let me brief you on a little funny that we we saw last night. And I'll start the briefing by mentioning that, at the present time, it is not a great concern; but just to keep you up to date with what's going on, let me mention it to you. About 70 hours, which was probably about the time of your last exercise period, we saw three funnies with the hydrogen tanks - as I say, none of which is causing any great concern. The first of these was a shift of the limits of the pressure switch, the one that turns the heaters on and off. Remember, there are two of those switches, one on tank 1 and one on tank 2 and they work in series. And one of those switches - we can't tell which, but we suspect it's probably tank 2 because of the other funnies I'll get to in a minute on tank 2 - one of those switches went from a 13-psi range; in other words, a plus or minus 6.5 psi range. It changed its range down to plus or minus 1.5 psi. So it's now - its total range is only 3 psi. The main result of that is that it means that the pressure switches and the motor switch turning the heater on acts more frequently over shorter periods of time. The second thing which we observed following this - and we're not at all sure if there is any correlation between this and the others - We observed a high-frequency pressure oscillation in tank 2. It was about a 5-psi peak-to-peak oscillation, a frequency of about 2 cycles per second. And this lasted about 3 to 5 minutes. A third funny that we observed - and this was in tank 2 - the third funny that we observed was an erratic - and possibly correlated with the high-frequency oscillation - but an erratic total fuel cell current, and here again we were looking at - oh, peak-to-peak variations of something like 5 amps, or of 5 to 10 amps. And the suspicion is that, coupled with the shift in the limits of the pressure switch, some acoustic vibrations were set up in that tank - we may have seen them causing the oscillation of the motor switch, which was then reflected in the fuel cell currents. The - again, these erratic and possibly correlated fuel cell currents lasted for about 3 to 5 minutes. And since then, all during the night, they've [sic] been no further events of this sort; and the pressure switch with its reduced limits has been acting quite normally, just with the reduced limits overnight. As I say again, we're looking at it, people are studying it in great detail, with no real answer at the moment; but there is no great concern at present, and it appears that the worst that can happen is for the motor switch to fail because of overuse. And if this were to happen, it would force us to go to man - manual management of the heaters on the H2 tank. But that appears at the moment to be the worst, that we can anticipate from this - from this group of funnies. Over.
0824340|CDR|Okay, Bob. I understand that. You know, I wonder if we ought to stop stirring the cryos the way we've been doing it.
0824356|CC|That - that has been suggested, but - but, again, it's not very clear that any of these things are terribly correlated.
0824406|CDR|Okay. Also, you know, if you want to reduce the activity on that switch - depending on how much you need to have it done during quiet periods, such as eat periods and things like that - we could go to manual operation.
0824421|CC|Negative, Jack, because the switch - OMNI Bravo, please, 17.
0824427|CC|... If you pull out your schematics there, you'll find that the - no matter what you do, the - you can turn the thing off, in fact, and the switch will continue to operate the motor switch - the pressure switch will continue to operate the motor switch off the service module buses. There's nothing you can do. The only thing you'll do if you go from AUTO to MANUAL or OFF is you'll keep the current from going to the heaters, but the motor switch will still operate.
0824457|CDR|Okay. Thank you for the education.
0824533|CC|And I've been corrected. The frequency of the pressure oscillation was more in the vicinity of a cycle every 4 or 5 seconds.
0824556|CDR|Okay.
0824622|CC|And 7 - -
0824623|LMP|Bob, let me ask a couple of questions to make sure - -
0824625|CC|Go ahead.
0824629|LMP|Make sure I understand this. You're not sure whether the heater cycling and the pressure cycling were correlated. is that correct?
0824638|CC|That's affirmative.
0824644|LMP|In a cycle very 4 or 5 seconds, is it possible for the heaters to affect the tank that fast?
0824655|CC|That's not possible, so the only thing that really - we think could - The tank is too much of a heat sink to do it that way. What may have happened was that if you set up an oscillation - a mechanical oscillation in the tank - through - one way or another, that this could then have acted back up on the motor. But the motor switch in driving the heaters could not have reinforced the oscillation because the tank is too much of a heat sink.
0824726|LMP|Okay. When did you say this happened with respect to our exercise period?
0824734|CC|That's not well pinned down, 17. We do know it hasn't occurred since about 71 hours; and it did occur at approximately 70 hours, which was about the time of your exercise period. But we haven't been able to correlate that exactly with the start of or the finish of the exercise period.
0824755|LMP|Well, you know you should be able to do that because of the biomed on - at least on me, and Ron was on, too. But, as soon as I started exercising, you should have the biomed data on my heart rate. It was an unscheduled exercise period. We just went into it before an eat period there, I think. Let me check back.
0824816|CC|Okay. And we can check back and inform you more specific on what the times were there in terms of your exercise period, also. I'd like OMNI Charlie, please, there, 17. And we might mention that oscillations like this have been seen on the ground under somewhat different circumstances, but oscillations like this have been seen on the ground in ground tests previously. And I might say, also, that as far as other things in the spacecraft are concerned, everything looks absolutely normal or nominal, as the case may be, and in great shape and emph - I'd emphasize again that we've seen none of this oscillation again since 71 hours. Over.
0824903|LMP|Okay, Bob. That was, as you say, pretty close to the exercise. I can't pin it down in the checklist exactly, but it was somewhere after ALFMED was complete and before we changed that canister. I think we changed that canister a little early, about 70:50. So I think the medic should have pretty good data on when we were exercising. And the reason I say that was because the way we were - I was exercising anyway - I'm sort of running in place against the LEB and conceivably could have gotten an oscillation going in the tank.
0824951|CC|Roger. Understand that.
0825254|CC|OMNI Delta, 17.
0825310|CC|And, 17, we did a little - a little investigation of times down here. We found that at 71:12 you were exercising at 130 beats per minute there Jack. And we think the exercise period ended about 10 minutes later at 71:22. The H2 tank funnies started at about 71:37 with the pressure switch shift and 71:42 with the oscillations. Over. So, there it's - oh, at least 15 minutes after the exercise period was over.
0825349|LMP|Okay. I just wanted to clear my reputation, Bob. Now it's perfectly clean again.
0825401|CC|As clean as ever, anyway.
0825430|CC|Okay. 17, I guess we decided we'd let - we'll run the OMNIs down here instead of having you guys push them all the time. So if you'll select OMNI Bravo at the present time, then we'll take over and run the OMNIs for you.
0825450|LMP|Okay, Bob. It's not too big a deal. If anytime you think you want to talk to us continuously, go ahead and call them, if we're not busy.
0825500|CC|Okay. Copy that. Let us know when you're ready. I've got a pad here for you guys to copy, but there's no big hurry on it. Finish your eat period and give us a call.
0825517|LMP|Okay. I'll be with you in about 5 minutes.
0825523|CC|Say again there, 17,
0825529|LMP|Be right with you, Bob.
0825530|CC|All right.
0825535|CDR|And, looking at the Flight Plan, we're going to go ahead and change a canister; and we've got the H2 purge LINE HEATERS, ON. We're going to configure for the urine dump. We'll go ahead and do our - stop our PTC at 83:30, and then we'll do our P52.
0825557|CC|Roger. Copy that.
0825630|CC|And, 17, that P52 at 83:10 was primarily intended for the MCC-4. There's some more following, anyway, before LOI. So we suggest you scrub the P52 at 83:10.
0825651|CMP|Okay, fine. I may just do a little OJT without torquing.
0825657|CC|That's your business.
0825710|PAO|This is Apollo control at 82 hours 57 minutes. We're completing a shift handover at this time in Mission Control. The team of flight controllers headed by flight director, Gerry Griffin, coming on now to replace the Gene Kranz team. The spacecraft communicator on the upcoming shift is Astronaut Gordon Fullerton. We do not plan to have a change of shift press briefing at this shift change.
0825740|CDR|Bob, when we come out of PTC, then you want us to go right to the SIM door jett attitude?
0825749|CC|That's affirmative, 17.
0825754|CDR|Okay, and you want us to do that about 80 - 83:30, huh?
0825800|CC|Roger. That's affirm.
0825805|CDR|Okay.
0825807|LMP|Bob, what pad are you going to give me?
0825809|CC|Okay, I've got a - coming up, pericynthion - plus-2-hour abort pad here.
0830133|CC|17, Houston.
0830139|LMP|Yes, Bob. Here is 17. Say, for a while here, why don't you guys go ahead and manage the OMNIs. I think we can get things done a little better; and when it becomes inconvenient for us to switch, we'll let you know.
0830157|CC|Okay. You want us to call them to you - is that what you're saying by you manag - we manage the OMNIs?
0830204|LMP|Yes, we lose 5 or 10 minutes going around here without comm, and it usually breaks up seemingly when somebody has something to say, either you or us.
0830214|CC|Roger. Okay. That's fine. Stand by.
0830223|LMP|That's up to you guys, but, it seems to me, it would be more convenient.
0830228|CC|Okay; things are good now, Jack. Do you want to copy this pericynthion-plus-2 pad at the present time?
0830237|LMP|Yes, I'm just about ready, Bob.
0830241|CC|Okay, give me a call when you get it.
0830250|CC|And, while you're getting ready there, you might think back to yesterday afternoon just after the exercise period; and the question that's raised is whether you were running the DAC or some other miscellaneous equipment at that time which might have caused some high current usage - or erratic current usage.
0830327|LMP|We'll think about that, Bob; but offhand, none of us can remember doing anything like that.
0830332|CC|Okay; copy that.
0830615|CC|OMNI Charlie, 17.
0830735|CC|And, 17, your faithful night shift CAPCOM is signing off. I'll talk to you on the surface tomorrow. Good luck.
0830747|CDR|Thank you, Robert. Looking forward to seeing you there.
0830751|LMP|Are you leaving us, Bob?
0830755|CC|That's affirm; he's already left.
0830800|LMP|Boy, he doesn't stick around long, does he? And he wanted to read that pad to me; well, that's too bad. Okay, Gordy, I can take the pad now.
0830813|CC|Okay, Jack. It's pericynthion plus 2; SPS/G&N. Weight is 66373; plus 1.18, minus 0.14; ignition time is 090:49:55.82; plus 1787.5, minus 1891.7, minus 2396.8; attitude is 237, 126, 332; and all the rest of the PAD is NA. GDC align stars are Sirius and Rigel; 122; 354; 000. Ullage is none. Remarks: number 1, burn docked; number 2, assumes LOI REFSMMAT. Over.
0830950|LMP|Okay. Pericynthion plus 2, SPS/G&N; 66373, 1 - plus 1.18, minus 0.14; 090:49:55.82; plus 1787.5, minus 1891.7, minus 2396.8; 237, 126, 332; rest of pad is NA; Sirius and Rigel; 122; 354; 000. No ullage. Remark 1, burn docked; 2 is LOI REFSMMAT assumed.
0831031|CC|That's correct.
0831047|CC|Need OMNI Delta now.
0831139|CMP|Houston, 17. Canister change complete.
0831144|CC|Okay.
0831508|CC|America, switch to OMNI Alpha.
0831738|CC|America, Houston. I have the morning news if it's a convenient time.
0831746|LMP|Fire away, Gordo.
0831749|CC|Okay, first of all the weather. It's raining fairly - fairly heavily all night; there's a lot of water standing around. Temperatures here are in the high 50's, but it's supposed to get a little cooler tonight with a low in the 40's. I think you know how the Dallas-Redskin game came out - the only thing additional mentioned here is that chances look good now that Washington and Dallas may meet in the rubber games for the National Conference representative in the Super Bowl. In the other pro game yesterday, a field goal by Don Cockroft was the difference in a 26-to-24 win by Cleveland over rival Cincinnati. Other sports highlights: The Pittsburgh Steelers play the Oilers today in the Dome. Other big games will be Atlanta at San Francisco, Green Bay at Minnesota, and Baltimore at Kansas City. Tennessee State beat Drake University in the Pioneer Bowl 29 to 7. And East Texas State beat Carson Newman in the NAIA football playoffs. The Southwest Conference has pulled out of the U.S. Olympic Committee. Some college basketball scores: The Houston Cougars routed Xavier last night out at Hofheinz Pavilion 114 to 73; and Rice downed George Washington 93 to 89. Geno, you'll be glad to hear Purdue ripped TCU 101 to 70, and it was Texas over Oklahoma State 86 to 66. And SMU over Oklahoma City 106 to 83. We couldn't find any score at Cal Tech, Jack, but - Switch to OMNI Bravo, please. But one final score, Ron, Kansas lost to Iowa 69 to 56. The only thing new on the plane crash Friday in Chicago - it's reported here that the plane was apparently waved off because another plane was still on the assigned runway. The Democratic Party's stormy session in Washington saw the old-guard Democrats apparently take back control of the Party from pro-McGovern forces. Mrs. Jean Westwood was replaced as Party Chairman by Texas lawyer/businessman Robert Strauss. Former-president Truman appears to be more than holding his own at a hospital in Kansas City. There's a good chance the 88-year-old former Chief Executive may be taken off the critical list. There's been a 1-day interruption in the secret peace talks between Dr. Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho. The two conferred for over 3 hours yesterday. Both sides have agreed not to talk to newsmen on any substantive matters. In other news highlights, President Nixon has named Daniel Moynihan as U.S. Ambassador to India. And Chilean President Allende has flown to Cuba to visit Fidel Castro. Here's an interesting one: A 45-year-old pilot lost in the Arctic for 31 days has been found alive and well. Three companions were killed. The Soviet Party boss Leonid Breshnev has delayed a scheduled visit to the U.S. It looks as if the visit may come in the fall rather than this coming spring. One last note: The news media says that the flight of Apollo 17 is the smoothest on record so far, and I call that last one pretty accurate reporting. Over.
0832211|LMP|Thank you, Gordo, appreciate the news. Sounds like things are still happening down there.
0832236|CC|Got some more parochial news here - -
0832239|LMP|Houston, we're starting our -
0832240|CC|Go ahead.
0832244|LMP|No, we just - I just wanted to tell you we're starting our waste dumps.
0832248|CC|Okay. A little more parochial news. I have your oxygen consumable status here. Tank 1 is still running 4 percent below the line; the other two are right on the line; really no news there. Same with the hydrogen; all three are essentially right on the preflight lines. Over.
0832316|LMP|Okay, that's the way like to hear it.
0832322|LMP|We'll bring all of it home if we can.
0832325|CC|Okay.
0832408|CC|We'd like OMNI Charlie, please.
0832849|CC|Need OMNI Delta now.
0832907|CMP|Okay, Gordy. How would you like a hydrogen purge this morning?
0832914|CC|Let me make sure.
0832946|CMP|Houston, 17.
0832949|CC|17, we do want the hydrogen purge; go ahead.
0832957|CMP|Okay, hydrogen purge is in process. You'd never believe it, dust collection container assembly serial number 5725 developed a hole in it. Fortunately, with a lot of dexterity, I was able to put a piece of tape over the hole.
0833031|CC|Okay. I guess that's why we sent men into space.
0833038|CMP|(Laughter) Right.
0833109|LMP|Gordy, while the purges are going on here, I might mention, a little while ago, I looked at the Earth througih a Polaroid colored glass again and had a full view of Africa. And it appeared as if, in the red and yellow portions of Africa, that the land areas darkened considerably more than those areas that are green or foliated, and that would be the central portion; that is, they darkened with the orien - handle on the lens going in a north-south rather than east-west.
0833202|CC|Roger.
0833212|LMP|The land areas, though, still do not show as marked a contrast as do the oceans.
0833219|CC|Roger,
0833322|CC|We'd like OMNI Alfa.
0833437|LMP|Okay, hydrogen purge is complete. HEATER is going OFF.
0833440|CC|Roger.
0833500|LMP|Gordy, it looks like the cloudiness and possibly the showers associated with the intertropical convergence over Africa are moving as far south as Johannesburg right now. It's quite a distinct change from even an - an hour or so ago - a couple of hours ago. They're down into an area where, presumably, they're not normally found if vegetation indications are any criteria. And also, in the Atlantic - South Atlantic near Goa island, there seems to be a possible storm developing as part of what was probably now a fairly weak front. And whether or not that will develop into anything and move in towards Capetown is hard to say at this time.
0833608|CC|Roger, Jack.
0833630|LMP|It looks as if our old friends at Ascension are enjoying a fairly nice day out there.
0833639|CC|Roger.
0833744|CC|OMNI Bravo, please.
0834009|CC|Jack, this is Houston. We recall you mentioning the purge complete and the heaters off. We just wanted to be sure that you did leave the H2 purge line heaters on for 10 minutes after terminating the purge. Over.
0834029|LMP|Thank you, Gordy. I'll turn them back on.
0834032|CC|Okay.
0834045|LMP|Who's sitting over there reminding me of all these good things this morning?
0834052|CC|Well, that was a combination effort by John Aaron and Charlie Dumis.
0834100|LMP|Wow! You've got a real powerful team there.
0834105|CC|You bet.
0834111|LMP|Hey, you really ought to get them a cup of coffee though sometime this morning.
0834215|LMP|Gordy, also curious who's wa - who's watching Challenger this morning?
0834223|CC|Well, let's see.
0834227|LMP|Not much to see, I realize, but I'm sure somebody's there.
0834236|CC|We need OMNI Charlie, Jack.
0834251|CC|Well, we've got the first team on - the gold team - your LOI and landing team, and the LM guys are Merritt and Thorson.
0834308|LMP|You cut out on the telmu. Who is it?
0834313|CC|Merlin. Merlin the Magician.
0834327|LMP|I'm sorry, Gordy, you clipped off the first again.
0834332|CC|Merlin Merritt, the magician.
0834337|LMP|Oh, yes; of course. As I recall, he's the only one that really understands Thorson.
0834358|CC|He says he doesn't think anybody understands Thorson.
0834413|LMP|Well, we're sure looking forward to having a chance to make those guys work a little bit.
0834425|CC|They say - well - Merlin says he is, too. I don't know about Thorson. He's out of the room at the moment.
0834436|LMP|He's probably spilling coffee in SPAN.
0834440|CC|Roger.
0834632|CC|We need OMNI Delta now.
0834846|LMP|Gordy, for some reason, it's a lot easier to tell the difference between the Antarctic Continent and the icepack.
0834900|CC|Roger.
0834907|LMP|Maybe the glancing Sun is picking up the breaks in the icepack and giving it a different appearance.
0834918|CC|Roger.
0834933|LMP|The continent itself - all you can see are very - what appear to be very gentle differences in - or subtle differences in shading, possibly indicating rolling relief due to a photometric dark beam along the - as a function of local phase angle.
0835005|CC|Copy.
0835021|LMP|And except, maybe, for the area just - well, no - even there, I didn't the ... - it looks like the whole visible continent is clear of clouds this morning. Possibly some clouds just east of the Ross Sea, which is just coming into view, I think.
0835053|CC|Roger.
0835056|LMP|I know we don't have many listeners in Antarctica, but it looks like they're having a - exceptionally fine day over the portion of the continent we can see.
0835113|CC|Roger.
0835120|LMP|That weak front I mentioned in the South Atlantic stretches from the apparent storm center around Goa island - I'm not sure about that pronunciation either - up just to the coast of South America from Brazil, where it reaches its maximum eastward extent.
0835150|CC|Roger.
0835157|LMP|Our sub - our zero-phase point of the spacecraft is in the middle of the South Atlantic. And it's moderately bright, although there is no central bright point at all - a fairly large area, but moderately bright. The seas down there might be moderately choppy or rough this morning.
0835234|CC|Okay.
0835427|LMP|Houston, 17.
0835430|CC|Go.
0835435|LMP|Okay, Gordy. You might say "uh" before you - you start your sentences because you're clipping your first word. The question I had was the pan camera - we're on 1-6 of the Experiments Checklist and need your word on whether you want the PAN CAMERA, OFF, at this time - SELF TEST, OFF.
0835456|CC|Stand by.
0835516|CC|We'd like you to leave it in HEATERS.
0835521|LMP|Okay, we're leaving it in HEATERS.
0835639|LMP|Okay, Houston. The S-BAND AUX, TV is to SCIENCE - -
0835646|CC|Roger.
0835647|LMP|- - and I'm turning the IR, ON.
0835649|CC|Okay.
0835658|CC|Jack, we'd like OMNI Alfa.
0835704|LMP|How do you read on OMNI Alfa?
0835707|CC|Okay; you're readable, fair amount of noise.
0835730|LMP|Hello, Houston. How do you read?
0835732|CC|Jack, this is Houston. You're clear with considerable noise. Over.
0835836|LMP|Houston, how do you read 17?
0835839|CC|Apollo 17, Houston. Still reading you with a lot of background noise. Over.
0835904|LMP|Hello, Houston. How do you read?
0835908|CC|17, Houston. Weak but readable.
0835914|LMP|Okay, we'll have you up on your high gain pretty soon. I'm turning the IR, ON.
0835921|CC|Roger; Roger; Roger. IR, ON.
0835936|LMP|Say again, Gordy.
0835938|CC|We copy. IR, ON. Over.
0835956|CC|America, we'll take the high gain now. PITCH, minus 15; YAW, 188. Over.
0840107|CC|America, Houston. Let's try the high gain now. I see you're moving it. Minus 26 and 199.
0840122|LMP|Okay, I think we've got a main load block now on the high gain. How do you read?
0840127|CC|You're loud and clear, Jack. It looks good here.
0840133|LMP|Okay, Gordy. Let me keep going here. I did not turn the IR on because I thought you said something. IR is going ON now.
0840141|CC|Okay. What I said is, "Roger. IR, ON."
0840156|CMP|Coming on.
0840203|CMP|MAPPING CAMERA going to STANDBY.
0840206|CC|Okay; STANDBY on the MAP CAMERA.
0840234|CMP|Okay. I'm waiting your cue for PAN CAMERA POWER, to POWER.
0840241|CC|Roger. We're still locking up on the data. We'll give you a cue.
0840335|CC|Okay, Jack. You have our cue for PAN CAMERA POWER to POWER.
0840353|CMP|Okay. PAN CAMERA going to POWER.
0840413|CMP|Okay, Gordo. We're in the SIM bay door jett attitude.
0840417|CC|Roger.
0840612|PAO|This is Apollo Control 84 hours 6 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Present distance from the Moon -
0840619|CMP|PAN CAMERA POWER is going to BOOST.
0840622|CC|Roger.
0840631|PAO|Velocity 3,763 feet per second. Next major maneuver is Lunar Orbit Insertion, which presently is scheduled for 88 hours 54 minutes 22 seconds Ground Elapsed Time. Total DELTA-V or change in velocity which will be retrograde of 2,988 feet per second. Service propulsion system engine burn time of 6 minutes 38.08 seconds. Mother Earth is 206,059 nautical miles behind Apollo 17, and locked up on the high-gain antenna at this time so we should have fairly good communications all the way through the SIM BAY door jettison and until the spacecraft passes behind the Moon prior to the Lunar Orbit Insertion maneuver, which now is some 4 hours and 37 minutes away, roughly. At 84:07 standing by live on air-to-ground this is Apollo Control.
0840914|CMP|Oh, down there. Oh.
0840943|CMP|Me to you.
0841008|CMP|Okay, Houston. I'm in VOX now. Do you read?
0841012|CC|Yes, sir. You're loud and clear.
0841018|CMP|Okay. On panel 181, the LOGIC POWER MAIN A, MAIN B circuit breakers are CLOSED.
0841026|CC|Roger.
0841028|CMP|Okay. LOGIC POWER number 1 is going to JETT, number 2 to JETT. Standing by for your GO, Houston.
0841039|CC|Okay. Stand by.
0841043|CMP|Okay.
0841047|CC|Okay, America, you're - -
0841048|CMP|What happens now is - -
0841049|CC|- - GO to jett the SIM bay door.
0841056|CMP|Okay, Jack, let me know when you've got the camera ready.
0841104|CDR|Okay, Houston. You say we are GO to jett the SIM bay down a little early, huh?
0841110|CC|Well, stand by. I think we're backing down here. Stand by 1 second.
0841117|CDR|Okay.
0841139|CMP|No. I checked it at one frame.
0841144|CDR|Might check it.
0841146|CC|Okay, America. Once again, you're GO to jett the door, and you can do it early, if you wish.
0841154|CDR|Okay, Gordo. We'll do it on - on Ron's mark down there.
0841200|CC|Okay.
0841201|LMP|Hey, Houston. You know this attitude - this attitude has the Sun right into window 5 - it's probably going to be on the lens of the camera. I'll - I'll try to shade it the best I can, but I don't have an awful lot of hope for these pictures.
0841225|CC|Roger.
0841229|CDR|I think we're probably stuck with it, Jack, because we need to be in this right attitude, for the clearance and -
0841245|CMP|Okay. SIM door jett 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 -
0841253|CMP|JETT. Oh, I got a good bang. You see it, Jack?
0841300|CDR|Houston, there it goes, I got it out the hatch window and it looks like it was a clean jett. It's rolling and pitching and yawing, slightly. There is a lot of garbage that came out with it.
0841311|CMP|Can you take a picture, Gene?
0841327|CMP|Let me see it.
0841332|CMP|Ah - ah (laughter).
0841340|CDR|You take a picture. Yes, there it goes.
0841343|CDR|Hello, Houston. How do you read?
0841344|CMP|It's really - -
0841345|CC|Loud and clear. Sounding good.
0841349|CDR|Okay. Did you get the word we got a clean jett?
0841352|CC|That's right, Geno. Sounds good.
0841355|CDR|Okay. The door's moving - the door's moving directly away from us, mostly rolling. And it looks like it was a very clean - clean separation.
0841414|CC|Okay.
0841421|CMP|Yes. Boy, we got a good bang out of it. You could hear that - that pyro going, I think. It's rotating at about 5 - or 1 revolution per 5 seconds.
0841433|CC|Roger.
0841442|CMP|And it's rotating - what, about the long axis? Yes. Rotating about the long axis.
0841457|CDR|Houston, the garbage that I said went with it was just a small amount of debris, I'm sure around the sealant pyro area. There was one, oh, about a 4-foot-length piece of, oh, 1 or 2 inch tapelike material that also went out with it.
0841518|CC|Roger, Gene.
0841522|LMP|(Laughter) Okay. What do we do with these LOGIC POWER switches? Don't they go back to OFF now?
0841530|CMP|DOOR JETT's OFF, down.
0841534|CMP|Okay. You go on to the DEPLOY/RETRACT on number 1.
0841538|CMP|DEPLOY/RETRACT on number 2.
0841545|CDR|FUEL CELL REACT VALVES are NORMAL. I'm sort of glad we had those in LATCH.
0841550|CMP|Yes, me, too, because that's a pretty good bang.
0841625|CC|You've loaded the wrong pitch angle there in NOUN 22.
0841640|CDR|Well, I'm - I got 10 degrees loaded; that's what we've got copied down here in the change.
0841650|CC|Maybe it's our mistake. Let us check here, Geno.
0841655|CDR|Okay, we got 320, 010, and 324, and before I go into the muver - maneuver, I'll roll right about 12 degrees,
0841714|CC|Bad call, Gene. Our error; you're right.
0841720|CDR|Thank you, sir.
0841727|CMP|Okay, and the UV SPECTROMETER is going to go ON here.
0841733|CMP|MARK it.
0841734|CC|Roger. Mark the UV.
0841739|LMP|Okay, and the IR will be OFF on your cue.
0841745|CC|Okay, Jack, that'll be 12 or 15 minutes from now.
0841752|LMP|Okay, just give us a call.
0841943|LMP|Okay, the 100-WATT O2 HEATER circuit breaker's coming OPEN.
0841947|CC|Okay, Jack.
0842016|LMP|Okay, 02 HEATERS 1 and 2 going to AUTO, and 3, OFF.
0842021|CC|Roger.
0842151|CDR|Okay, Gordo. We'll wait until 50 past the hour and pick up the LM/CM DELTA-P; we're still reading 0.6.
0842201|CC|Roger. That sounds good.
0842207|CDR|And we're in the process of maneuvering and I guess I'll start to see if I can't get you some biomeds.
0842218|CC|Okay.
0842227|LMP|I don't know whether you were watching the LMP on the door jett, did you see a jett on my heartbeat?
0842236|CC|We'll - we'll check this data here, Jack.
0842245|LMP|I guess I was remembering erroneously 15's comment that it was very quiet, but I - of course, Ron reminded me they were in the suits.
0842305|CC|Okay, Jack. John Young was talking about the same thing here, but we didn't see anything on your EKG.
0842317|LMP|How stable can you get?
0842327|CMP|And Houston, 17 here. Mag Bravo Bravo is indicating 20 - let's see - indicating 76 percent now - 76-percent full.
0842342|CC|Okay, Ron.
0842349|CDR|And, Gordo, we are watching the 8-ball.
0842357|CC|Roger. We're keeping an eye on it, too.
0843306|CC|America, we'd like the HIGH GAIN to AUTO, please.
0843315|LMP|Okay, you've got it to AUTO. I think we may have a new discovery about microphones up here.
0843324|CC|Oh, is that right? What's that?
0843330|LMP|Well, Gordy, it looks as if you could improve your voice quality by putting fingers over the end of the mike booms. At least that works on the intercom.
0843344|CC|How about that.
0843517|CC|America, Houston. We're ready for the IR to OFF.
0843523|LMP|Okay. IR's coming OFF -
0843532|LMP|MARK it.
0843715|LMP|Hey, Gordy. Who's operating in the trench in front of you today?
0843721|CC|Okay. It's the LOI and descent team, Presley, Green, and Deiterich.
0843738|LMP|They're a trio of musketeers, if I ever heard of one.
0843743|CC|Roger.
0843746|LMP|All they lack is a French accent.
0843759|CC|A New York accent is about the best they can do.
0843813|LMP|I wasn't going to exercise any value judgments, Gordy.
0844059|CC|Jack, this is Houston. I have a preliminary LOI pad anytime it's convenient.
0844109|LMP|Okay, Gordy. I was just checking to see if I could find the Moon, and I still can't see it out there.
0844118|LMP|I'll be with you in 30 seconds.
0844120|CC|Okay.
0844247|LMP|Okay, Gordy. Go ahead.
0844251|CC|Okay. This is a preliminary LOI, SPS/G&N. 66361; plus 1.21, minus 0.12; 088:54:22.71; minus 2798.8, plus 1045.7, minus 0037.3. Attitude is all zeros.

Remarks: LM weight, 36312; and single-bank burn time is 06:51. Go ahead.
0844510|LMP|Okay. Preliminary LOI, SPS/G&N. 66361; plus 1.21, minus 0.12; 088:54:22.71; minus 2798.8 plus 1045.7, minus 0037.3. All zeros; all zeros; all zeros; 0170.1, plus 0052.5; 2988.0, 6:38, 2981.7; 45, 252.1, 13.5. Set stars are Sirius and Rigel; 122; 354; 000. No ullage. LM weight is 36312, and single-bank burn time is 06:51.
0844614|CC|One correction on the ignition time. The seconds are 22.77.
0844626|LMP|Okay, 22.77.
0844629|CC|That's affirmative; otherwise, good readback.
0844719|CMP|Okay, Houston. At 84:45, we've got about 2-1/2 to 3 minutes at 1 frame a second on mag Bravo Bravo, through the celestial adapter of the Earth.
0844743|CC|Okay, Ron. We caught that. And if you're looking for the Moon, according to our figures here, it should be visible out window number 1 about 30 degrees off the boresight axis. Over.
0844802|LMP|Okay, got you. I'll try again.
0844916|CC|America, Houston. I'm ready with a TEI-4 pad anytime it's convenient.
0844924|LMP|Stand by.
0845336|LMP|Okay, Gordy, I'm ready for a TEI-4 pad.
0845341|CC|Okeydoke. It's TEI-4, SPS/G&N; 40090; plus 0.50, plus 1.17. Ignition time is 097:20:47.45. NOUN 81, plus 2004.8, minus 2951.1, minus 1547.3; attitude will be 202, 083, 312. Rest of the pad is NA. GDC align stars are Sirius and Rigel; 133; 200; 030. Ullage: four jets, 12 seconds. And remark number 1: burn undocked; number 2: assumes no DOI; number 3: assumes landing site REFSMMAT; number 4: with the LOI REFSMMAT, your attitude will be: roll, 180; pitch, 220; yaw, 38 - correction -yaw is 338. Over.
0845613|LMP|Okay, TEI-4, SPS/G&N; 40090; plus 0.50, plus 1.17; 097:20:47.45; plus 2004.8, minus 2951.1. minus 1547.3; 202, 083, 312. Rest of pad NA. Sirius and Rigel; 133; 200; 030. Four jets, 12-second ullage. Remark 1: burn undocked; 2: no DOI assumed; 3: landing site REFSMMAT; 4: LOI REFSMMAT attitude 180, 220, 338. Over.
0845720|CC|Okay. That's a good readback.
0845929|CC|America, Houston. If you give us ACCEPT, we'll pop up a state vector - a preliminary state vector and a VERB 66, preliminary target load, and an LOI REFSMMAT. Over.
0845944|CMP|Okay, Houston. You have it.
0850108|CDR|Okay, Houston. This is America. How do you read the commander on biomed?
0850114|CC|Stand by. I'll take a look here.
0850244|CC|America, Houston. Looking at the O2 pressures, we think maybe TANK 3 isOL VALVE got jarred closed. Would you check the barber pole over on panel 278. If it's barber pole, would you reopen the valve?
0850301|LMP|Gordy, we checked that. I'll check it again. We checked it right after the Jet.
0850317|LMP|And, Gordy, it's gray. Would you like me to cycle it?
0850330|CC|That's affirmative, Jack. Go ahead and cycle it OPEN.
0850340|LMP|Okay. That's been done.
0850343|CC|Roger.
0850408|CC|America, Houston. It's your computer. You can go back to BLOCK.
0850418|CMP|Okay, we're back to BLOCK. In the DELTA-V test, I got a minus 22.0, and I'm on a bias check right now.
0850430|CC|Roger.
0850637|CC|America, Houston. The biomed looks good on all three of you.
0850646|CDR|Okay.
0850701|CMP|And the null bias check, on a plus 100, it went to 100.4. I'm working on a minus now.
0850713|CC|Okay, sounds good.
0850819|CMP|Okay. The minus 100, it ended up minus 99.5.
0850826|CC|Okay, Ron.
0851038|CMP|Gordy, the EMERGENCY CABIN PRESSURE REGs are OFF.
0851043|CC|Roger.
0851100|CMP|Okay, EQUALIZATION valve in the tunnel has come OPEN.
0851107|CC|Roger.
0851311|CMP|Okay, Gordy, the LM TUNNEL valve is in LM PRESS, and EQUALIZATION valve is CLOSED.
0851321|CC|Roger. And was it a 0.6 DELTA-P when you started this, as before?
0851329|CMP|That's affirm. It was 0.6 and now it's down to - we been seeing it as about 0.1.
0851337|CC|Roger.
0851356|CMP|And, Gordy, I've got the EMERGENCY CABIN PRESSURE REGs back to BOTH.
0851401|CC|Roger.
0851745|LMP|Okay, Gordy, we're changing mags on the - the EL camera, and mag November November is being stowed with 59 frames on it - or 59 frames used - 159.
0851807|CC|Okay, Jack; copy.
0851827|CMP|Gordy, you can record that as the second commander's P52 that came up all balls.
0851837|CC|Okay, we'll get a hard copy.
0851905|CC|Okay, we got the 93s; you're clear to torque.
0853735|CDR|Okay, Gordo, there's the gyro torque angles.
0853740|CC|Okay, we're copying them down. Stand by.
0853807|CC|Okay, Geno; torque them.
0854506|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 85 hours 45 minutes Ground Elapsed Time into the mission of Apollo 17. Presently 7,900 nautical miles out from the Moon and approaching at 4,009 feet per second. We're still about 3 hours and 8 minutes away from Lunar Orbit Insertion manuever, which will place the Apollo 17 spacecraft into a 52 by a 170 nautical mile lunar orbit. Earlier today, Gene Cernan asked Mission Control for suggestions concerning his gas symptoms. A decision has been made for the flight surgeon to consult privately with Cernan to discuss these symptoms. There's no indication that this situation will have any effect on the progress of the mission. A summary of the conversation will be released shortly. Meanwhile, for distance back to Earth, Mother Earth stands some 208,068 nautical miles behind Apollo 17. We have 2 hours and 56 minutes remaining until the first loss of signal as Apollo 17 passes behind the Moon. 3 hours and 7 minutes and 50 seconds until ignition on the Lunar Orbit Insertion maneuver, which presently is scheduled for a Ground Elapsed Time of 88:54:22. Total burn time on the SPS engine of 6 minutes 38 seconds, for a total velocity change in retrograde of 2,988 feet per second. At 85:47 Ground Elapsed Time this is Apollo Control.
0855031|PAO|This is Apollo Control 85 hours 50 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Here in the Control Center, the Flights Dynamics Officer, Jay Green, just passed up to the Flight Director Neil Hutchinson, the latest predicted figures for the S-IVB impact. The present predictions on time are for the S-IVB to impact at Ground Elapsed Time of 89 hours 39 minutes 43.4 seconds. The coordinates of the impact are predicted to be 4.12 degrees south latitude by 12.22 degrees west longitude. 3 hours and 3 minutes to Lunar Orbit Insertion ignition. 2 hours 51 minutes until Apollo 17 passes behind the Moon for the first time. Distance from the Moon, presently 7,653 nautical miles, velocity ever increasing, now 4,032 feet per second. At 85:51 Ground Elapsed Time in the mission of Apollo 17, this is Apollo Control.
0861215|CC|America, Houston. America, Houston. We've lost the high gain and data. Go on OMNI Alfa.
0861243|CC|Hello America, Houston in the blind. Go OMNI Alfa ...
0861318|CC|America, this is Houston. How do you copy?
0861326|LMP|Clear, and we're OMNI Alfa. If you don't answer this transmission, we'll try the high gain again.
0861332|CC|Okay, Jack. We're reading you now. I heard you say OMNI Alfa. Say again the first part.
0861340|LMP|Roger. We've been reading you. I think you're on VHF, however. Would you like us to reacquire on the high gain?
0861348|CC|Stand by. I'll check on that.
0861405|CC|Okay, Jack. We'd like you to try the HIGH GAIN at a PITCH of minus 29, YAW 17, MANUAL and WIDE.
0861424|LMP|Okay, Gordy, we're on the HIGH GAIN.
0861429|CC|Okay, Jack.
0861434|LMP|How do you read?
0861437|CC|I'm reading you - I can read you, but there's still a lot of background noise.
0861447|LMP|Like VHF would sound, but I'm not sure I believe it.
0861456|CC|Jack, we just commanded NORMAL voice.
0861526|LMP|Gordy, did we end up somehow out of NORMAL voice?
0861535|CC|Jack, we'd like you to try a NORMAL acquisition. Go AUTO and NARROW on the HIGH GAIN.
0861550|LMP|Okay, that peaked it up, AUTO and NARROW.
0861554|CC|Okay, you're loud and clear now.
0861559|LMP|Okay, Gordy. You said that you had to command NORMAL voice. Did we get a spurious command in there some way?
0861621|CC|Okay, we had - we did all that ourselves to establish voice through Ascension; no problem. Over.
0861636|LMP|Okay, Gordy. How did you reach us when you finally started calling?
0861644|CC|Stand by.
0861710|CC|Jack, we didn't do anything to cause the problem there, we were up-linking through Madrid and downlinking through Ascension. Did you see anything onboard that could have caused the loss of lock?
0861725|LMP|No, sir. We had good signal strength. It wasn't peaked for the high gain. It was more like an OMNI signal strength, about 70 percent. And we called you several times after the switch in lines, and then finally you came through clear, but with some background noise and sounded like VHF. I presume it wasn't, now. And when you called, I went to OMNI Alfa, with no change in signal strength, still about 70 percent, and you were still coming up the same way and apparently didn't hear us. And then the high gain - with high gain acquisition, it's been pretty clear.
0861813|CC|Okay, that's the way - that story's the way it sounded to us. And we're looking around here to see if we can figure out a reason for loss there.
0861828|LMP|Okay, and I'm ready to pressurize the SPS, if that's what you want.
0861834|CC|Okay, let me make sure here.
0861848|CC|Okay, Jack. We're ready for it.
0861855|LMP|Okay, you want me to just use SPS HELIUM VALVE 1?
0861907|CC|That's affirmative,
0861931|LMP|Okay, Gordy. We're going to ON with SPS HELIUM VALVE 1. We checked the circuit breakers, they're IN.
0861941|CC|Okay.
0861942|LMP|Okay, pressure's com - pressure's up; FUEL PRESSURE is stable at 175 and OXIDIZER at 175, and the light is out. And we're back to NORMAL on CAUTION AND WARNING. And the VALVE now is back to AUTO.
0862003|CC|Roger. And looks - looks good here. We're reading 184 oxidizer and 185 fuel.
0862044|LMP|Hey, Gordy, this is the LMP. I got a question for you.
0862048|CC|Shoot.
0862054|LMP|I'm just wondering if - I'm showing about 85 amps, and is that a good normal power load with - I presume the O2 HEATERs are ON now.
0862108|CC|Just a second, we'll check that.
0862115|LMP|I'm just trying to reestablish my references here for LOI.
0862121|CC|EECOM says the HEATERs are ON and that's the normal load.
0862130|LMP|Okay. Very good. Thank you, sir.
0862251|CMP|Houston, 17.
0862254|CC|Go ahead.
0862258|CMP|Roger. We got about an hour sitting around here. We can go to wide dead band, if you want, if you'll remind me to go back to narrow again when we need to.
0862307|CC|Let me check on that.
0862320|CMP|Might save a teacupful of fuel.
0862440|CC|Ron, we suggest just staying where you are on the dead band; there's no problem on fuel.
0862449|CMP|Okay. Mighty fine, Gordo. Thank you.
0862742|CC|America, Hou - Houston. We just finished a site handover. And we're seeing some excessive counts on the UV. We'd like to chase the problem a little, and to do that, we'd like you to turn the UV OFF for 5 seconds and then back ON. Over.
0863232|CC|Ascension COMM TEC, Houston COMM TEC, Net 1 voice check. How do you copy?
0863240|ASC|Ascension COMM TEC, I read you loud and clear.
0863243|CC|Roger, Ascension.
0863338|LMP|Houston, 17; how do you read after a COMMAND RESET?
0863342|CC|17, this is Houston. You're loud and clear. Have you been calling?
0863350|LMP|Yes, sir, we've been calling. After your handover, we heard your statement that you handed over and then hadn't been able to contact you after that. I just hit a COMMAND RESET.
0863432|CC|Okay, Jack, that was a problem here on the ground. Over.
0863442|LMP|Okay.
0863517|LMP|Say, Gordy, 17.
0863520|CC|Go ahead.
0863525|LMP|Yes, we've got B DUPLEX - B SIMPLEX ON, apparently left over from the LM checks. I suspect I should turn that OFF. Right?
0863541|CC|That's affirmative.
0863607|CMP|Houston, 17.
0863609|CC|Go ahead.
0863615|CMP|Gordo, just an interesting observation on my part. I don't know why, but all the air bubbles in the beverage packs - you know, none of the air bubbles will come together at all. If you get it a small air bubble, it stays in a small air bubble. And they'll never co - come together. However, in my chicken and rice soup package here, I had a whole bunch of small air bubbles and now it's all one great big air bubble in the middle.
0863649|CC|Okay.
0863650|CMP|Most of the - most of the spoon bowl packs you know - or wet packs, whereas the juice bags won't do it.
0863704|CC|Okay, that's interesting. I sure don't know why either.
0863714|LMP|We're just trying to keep your day interesting here, Gordy. Now that you won't let us look at the Earth anymore, we'll start looking in the cabin.
0863733|CC|Okay, while you're looking in the cabin, I've got a new hydrogen cryo configuration for you to minimize the pressure cycling and cut down the wear and tear on the motor switch. If you're ready to do it, I'll read it.
0863752|LMP|Go ahead.
0863754|CC|Okay, on H2 TANK 1 and TANK 2 HEATERS, both of them, OFF. On the FANs, TANK 1 FANs ON, TANK 2 FANs OFF. I think they're there already. And TANK 3 FANs AUTO. Over.
0863818|LMP|Hey, there's a new configuration. Okay, H2 HEATERs 1 and 2 are OFF. H2 FANs - 1 is ON, 2 is OFF, and 3 is AUTO.
0863829|CC|Okay, sounds good.
0863837|LMP|That sounds like an EECOM special.
0863841|CC|That it is.
0864630|CDR|Hello, Houston, I've got the limb of the Moon.
0864634|CC|Very good.
0864636|CDR|I've got the limb of the Moon out the - got it out the center hatch and we're just barely seeing a - barely seeing the horizon of the Moon. But, boy, is it big.
0864652|CC|Roger.
0864653|CMP|Well, that must be a - what - you know, talk about a sliver of the Moon, that is a sliver of a sliver.
0864703|CDR|Gordo, we're coming in right down on top of it. What's our perigee, did you say? 53 miles?
0864711|CC|Roger. That's about right. Don't worry, you'll miss it.
0864717|CDR|I just want to hear you say it because I'm going to hold you to it.
0864733|CDR|As long as you shadow your eyes from the Sun - the Sun is just about laying on the horizon of the Moon, and as a matter of fact, as I watch it, I can watch the horizon - the amount of - of daylight terminator get larger.
0864749|CC|Roger.
0864855|CDR|Gordy, unless I get proven wrong here, I think we'll be able to watch it all the way in as long as we can keep shadowed from the Sun.
0864907|CC|Okeydoke.
0864912|CDR|I'll tell you, when you get out here, it's a big mamou.
0865201|CDR|Gordy, it's a sight to remember. Not just because of the uniqueness of the view, but because we all got to ask ourselves if we really know where we are and what we're really looking at right this moment, and when you answer that question is yes, it certainly becomes an epic sight in your mind.
0865226|CC|Roger, Gene.
0865231|LMP|My congratulations to the trench for solving another rendezvous - rendezvous problem.
0865240|CC|Roger.
0865343|CDR|Gordy, can you tell us how far we are right now from the - from the Moon?
0865350|CC|Surely can; stand by.
0865410|CC|Right now, you're about 5,000 miles from the surface.
0865418|CDR|Okay. Thank you.
0865525|LMP|Houston, 17.
0865527|CC|Go ahead.
0865532|LMP|I think I got a visual on the SIM bay door now out window 5. It's just about directly off our present plus-Y axis.
0865546|CC|Okay. Must be way out there by now.
0865555|LMP|Oh, yes. It's a long way out there; just flashing.
0865559|CC|Roger.
0865731|LMP|Gordy, what's the MOCR having for dinner Sun - this Sunday?
0865743|CC|Well, let's see. I guess we haven't sent out for hamburgers, yet. There's a few brown bags in sight, but that's about it.
0865758|LMP|My goodness.
0865833|CDR|Gordy, it doesn't look like I had a chance to go to church today, but under the circumstances I guess it'll be okay. Next time you see the good Father you might have him put a good word in for us.
0865846|CC|Okay, I'll do that.
0870756|CDR|Gordy, is - in our present attitude I'm seeing the lip of the Moon convex down toward our minus X axis. That's out of the hatch window. Can you tell me which is the north and which is the south pole?
0870820|CC|Okay. Stand by.
0870826|CDR|Yes, I'd be all squared away if - if the Moon were on Jack's side, because he's got that end on his head, but I'm a little mixed up now.
0870834|CC|Roger. I understand your problem.
0870924|CDR|Gordy, I - I'm thinking the - the top of the - the LM towards the Sun is probably the north.
0870939|CC|Roger.
0871026|CDR|Hello, Gordy. I - I think I got it. Window - the - the north has got to be on the right as I look at the limb of the Moon opposite the Sun. Because when we go into retrograde attitude, it's got to be over there. I think I can see Korolev without any problem. It's a little bit north of the - of the equator.
0871056|CC|Roger.
0871103|CDR|Gordy, are you still with us?
0871107|CC|That's affirm. I'm with you, and I'm getting lots of advice here.
0871114|CDR|Okay. Okay. I'll bet you are. But I - I think I got it oriented. You can literally watch yourself fall down in. As we get closer, if we're going to have a view like this, it's going to be pretty dramatic. Because we're calling the way you climb on out of the Moon when you leave it, if you can see. And I remember remarks at that time, "Gee, if we could see it like this when we came back in, we'd have to close our eyes." If we can see this thing coming in like I think we may be able to see it at 50 miles, it isn't going to look like very much.
0871158|CC|Roger. We agree.
0871200|LMP|And we're even considering the win - putting - Gordy, we're consider - Gordy, we're considering putting the window covers up.
0871215|CC|You're chickens, huh?
0871221|CDR|It's going to be one of those high - high - angle energy conversion roundouts.
0871228|CC|Roger. From our information here, if you're looking at the Moon so that the - the dark limb is up, then north should be to the right.
0871242|CDR|Yes. I - I concur, and that's the way it is.
0871245|CC|Roger.
0871248|CDR|The horizon is just steadily growing bigger.
0871254|CC|Does it look about the same as last time?
0871304|CDR|What do you mean, "last time?" Couple years ago?
0871307|CC|Right.
0871312|CDR|Gordy, we never saw it coming in a couple years ago. We saw it, as I recall, a day out, and we saw just a - a shadow of the limb. But we - to my best re - recollection, we never saw it this close. As a matter of fact, we went into darkness prior to going into LOI, and this time, much to my amazement, we don't. But I see now that we won't, and I see why. I'll tell you, everyone who's seen that view leaving knows how fast you climb out. And by golly, the closer we get to it, the faster we're coming in.
0871356|CC|Roger.
0871611|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 87 hours 16 minutes Ground Elapsed Time in the mission of Apollo 17. Some 1 hour and 38 minutes until ignition on lunar orbit insertion. Presently, the spacecraft is 4,243 nautical miles away from the Moon. The Moon is getting larger, as noted by the crew. They considered closing the window shades in the spacecraft. Velocity now 4,544 feet per second. Some numbers on acquisition of the spacecraft. With the burn - a normal burn, the acquisition on the east limb of the Moon would be at 89 hours 16 minutes 29 seconds. Without a burn, it would be somewhat sooner, 89 hours 7 minutes 46 seconds. A private conversation was conducted with the Apollo 17 crew from Ground Elapsed Time of 85:46:55 to 86:04:46. The subject of the conversation was Gene Cernan's request for suggestions concerning alleviating some gas symptoms he had had during the flight. The following is a summary of the conversation. The call to the crew was made by Donald K. Slayton, Director of Flight Crew Operations. Dr. Royce Hawkins, Chief of Medical Operations at MSC asked Cernan to explain his symptoms, Cernan reported it was no great problem, but that he has had some greater gas discomfort than his fellow crew members. He said he felt quite fine at this time, and there was never any pain or nausea associated with the discomfort. Cernan advised Dr. Hawkins of the anti-gas medication, symethocone, he'd been taking. Dr. Hawkins recommended to Cernan that he continue the medication after meals and before going to sleep. Hawkins also advised Cernan on some changes to his menu over the next 2 days to reduce the discomfort. Cernan reported quote "I'm better, there's nothing detrimental or incapacitating about this; we're all in good shape. We hope things are looking as good down there as they are up here." close quote. Lunar Module pilot Harrison Schmitt reported the crew had encountered some difficulty with the onboard system that separates gas bubbles from the drinking water supply. Schmitt was advised that the gas separator system has given the crews problems on previous Apollo flights. Astronaut John Young, Commander of the Apollo 16 mission and Back-up Commander for Apollo 17, also talked briefly to the Astronauts, and wished them well. Distance now 4,125 nautical miles from the Moon. Velocity 4,570. Still an hour and 35 minutes, MARK, until ignition on lunar orbit insertion burn. At 87:19, this is Apollo Control.
0871928|CDR|Gordo. The - the widest-most part of the convex horizon probably covers a good couple of degrees. I can now see relief on the - on the horizon itself against the dark space.
0871947|CC|Roger.
0871952|CDR|And the rim of Korolev is readily visible standing out by itself in the - in the darker or the unlit part of the - of the Moon. I can see the central peaks or mountains very well lit up.
0872050|LMP|Okay, Gordy. This is Jack. is there any reason not to start the checks at about 87:43?
0872105|CC|Stand by.
0872125|CDR|Okay, Gordy. What I - what I called a - a central peak or range in there must undoubtedly be that inner ring, but it - the way it was lit up in the sunlight gave you a definite impression that it had an enlongated central range.
0872145|CC|Roger. And for Jack, no problem starting early on the checks.
0872154|LMP|Okay. They're in work.
0872336|CDR|Okay, Hous -
0872337|LMP|..., Houston. Going to ... put the UV COVER OPEN. How long?
0872345|CC|Okay, Jack. And we'd like 5 minutes of operation with it OPEN.
0872356|LMP|Okay.
0872357|LMP|MARK it, OPEN.
0872540|LMP|Okay, Houston; 17. I've started the secondary glycol pump, and I neglected to make a check on the evap OP temperature. Do you have that, and did we get a decrease?
0872556|CC|Stand by. Looks okay, Jack.
0872612|LMP|Thank you.
0872813|LMP|Okay, Gordo. There's NOUN 05.
0872817|CC|Roger.
0872832|LMP|And you're looking at the torquing angle.
0872858|LMP|Okay, Houston. I'm going SPS PRESSURE INDICATOR to 2.
0872903|CC|Okay, Jack. And you can close the UV cover, and go ahead and roll back to 064 ROLL. And you're clear to torque the P52.
0872918|LMP|Okay. UV COVER is CLOSED.
0872955|LMP|Okay, Houston. Going back to SPS PRESSURE INDICATOR 1.
0873001|CC|Okay.
0873231|CC|America, Houston. We - we still see the UV door open. Have you closed it yet?
0873251|CDR|Okay. It's now CLOSED, Gordy.
0873254|CC|Roger.
0873331|CC|America, Houston. I have the LOI and map update pads when you're ready.
0873340|CDR|Stand by 1, Gordo.
0873459|CDR|Okay, Gordy. What do you have, a map update on page 3-83 of the Flight Plan?
0873505|CC|That's affirmative.
0873513|CDR|Why don't you go ahead?
0873514|CC|Okay. It's for rev 1. AOS without burn is 089:07:46; with the burn is 089:16:29.
0873534|CDR|Okay. Without the burn is 07:46, and with the burn is 16:29.
0873539|CC|That's affirmative, and then I have your LOI maneuver pad.
0873550|LMP|Okay. We're ready to go.
0873553|CC|Okay. LOI, SPS/G&N; the weight is 66361; plus 1.21, minus 0.12; ignition time is 088:54:21.74; NOUN 81, minus 2798.8, plus 1044.9, minus 0042.5; roll, pitch, and yaw are all zero; NOUN 44, 0170.1, plus 0052.5; 2987.7, burn time is 6:38, 2981.4; sextant star is 45, 252.1, 13.5; rest of the pad is NA. GDC align stars are Sirius and Rigel; 122; 354; 000. Ullage is none. Remarks: LM weight, 36312; single-bank burn time is 6:51. Over. Stand by on the readback. Okay. We'll take ACCEPT, and give you the up-links while you're reading it back.
0873818|LMP|Okay, Gordy. Here's your readback. You've got ACCEPT. It's LOI pad, SPS/G&N; 66361; plus 1.21, minus 0.12; 088:54:21.74; minus 2798.8, plus 1044.9, minus 0042.5; 000, 000, 000; 0170.1, plus 0052.5; 2987.7, 6:38, 2981.4; 45, 252.1, 13.5; rest of pad is NA. Sirius and Rigel; 122; 354; 000. There's no ullage. LM weight, 36312; single-bank burn time, 6 plus 51.
0873928|CC|Okay. That's a good readback.
0874106|CC|It's your computer, America. You have a state vector, a VERB 66, and a target load. Go back to BLOCK.
0874115|CDR|Okay. It's in BLOCK, Gordy. We're finishing up on the bottom of 3-79.
0874121|CC|Okay.
0874125|CDR|And back at this roll attitude, I've got the big old Moon again, and from where I sit, it looks like we're right on target. Fifty miles above target, I'd like to add.
0874143|CC|Okay. That sounds good.
0874149|CDR|The limb is, of course, still growing and a little more rapidly. And what I can see of the - of the limb that's not blocked out by the Sun, it's getting obviously much larger in the window.
0874209|CC|Roger.
0874210|CDR|Now I guess it depends on the shadowing of the Sun as to whether or not we're going to see too much. I think retrograde, we ought to see quite a bit once we get over the terminator.
0874235|CDR|Gordy, there's enough of the lighted portion of the Moon where you can see the relief - not just a shadowing relief, but the actual relief of several craters as they stretch across the terminator, both to the north and to the south. I can see even more definite relief now on the horizon, just to the north and behind Korolev - on the black horizon against space.
0874306|CC|Roger.
0874309|CDR|The - the unlit part of the Moon, as you might expect, is just as dark from here as is deep space itself.
0874322|CC|Roger.
0874323|CDR|It's black, I might say at this point.
0874357|CC|America, Houston. For your information, your altitude is about 3000 miles now.
0874406|CDR|Okay, 3000 miles.
0874419|CDR|Gordy, the - the limb has much more three-dimensional relief now. Towards us, you can - you can get the feeling that the horizon - the litted portion of the horizon definitely does flow in our direction. And although you can't see the unlit portion of the Moon, you get a feeling that there's a great deal more of it a lot closer than that which you can see.
0874450|CC|Roger.
0874552|CDR|Okay, Gordy. The pre-SPS burn aim prep is complete.
0874557|CC|Roger.
0874619|CDR|And I'm going to give my buddies a chance to look at it now.
0874623|CC|Okay.
0874706|CDR|I never thought I'd see a geologist speechless at his first near - near shot at the Moon, but I haven't heard a word from him yet.
0874715|CC|Roger.
0874719|LMP|This geologist turned engineer for about an hour.
0874733|CC|He's probably speechless because there's no clouds to talk about.
0874807|CDR|Gordo, everything's looking good onboard. We're just waiting for about 88:05. We'll be in our maneuver at that time.
0874817|CC|Okay. Everything looks good here also.
0874831|CDR|Okay. And is your LOS of about 45 still good?
0874837|CC|I'll doublecheck that.
0875013|CC|America, the Flight Plan is correct on LOS. To be exact, it will be 88:43:40.
0875026|CDR|43:40. Thank you, Gordo.
0875104|CDR|If - if you guys could get an idea down there of the needle you're threading when you shoot for 50 miles at a quarter of million, you'd be mighty proud of yourselves, I'll tell you, we are.
0875119|CC|Roger.
0875128|CDR|I guess I really ought to wait and tell you that at 89:16:29.
0875135|CC|Roger.
0875238|CDR|Hey, Gordy. Do you have any idea what our relative speed is to the - to the Moon at this time?
0875246|CC|Yes. It's 5000 feet per second. You're presently 2660 miles up.
0875300|CDR|Okay.
0875315|CDR|I assume T. P. is there, and I guess John is, too. I don't know if John saw this coming in on 16, but I know they can recall what we saw leaving on 10. And other than the fact that you can't see as much of the Moon, it's just as impressive.
0875337|CC|Roger. I was just talking to John about it a couple of minutes ago. Their view on 16 was - they didn't have any sunlit Moon, but they did have some pretty good earthshine.
0875359|CDR|Well, he - he knows what I'm talking about then.
0875659|CDR|Gordy, it's an unbelievable view through the monocular now. You can really see down in the depths of some of the larger craters and with a great deal of clarity. And you can see the - some of the higher ridges actually rolling right over the horizon as they go away from you.
0875721|CC|Roger, Geno.
0880531|CDR|Hey, Houston. As much as I hate to, I think we're going to have to maneuver out of this attitude.
0880538|CC|Roger. As you take your last look there, you're presently 20 - just a little over 2000 miles up, and you're coming down about 4500 feet per second.
0880558|CDR|Yes. You'd better believe that.
0880932|CDR|Gordo, there's only one better view than this.
0880937|CC|What's that, Gene?
0880939|CDR|Right at the moment anyway. Right at the moment anyway, is to be out there and watching this spacecraft maneuver in attitude and - and watch it burn over the lunar surface. I get the feeling someone is watching.
0881000|CC|Roger.
0881106|CC|Give us OMNI Charlie, please.
0881324|CC|Apollo 17, Houston. We just had a site handover. That's resulted in the LOS time changing 19 seconds. It's now 43:21.
0881339|CDR|Okay; 43:21, and we are - we're on OMNI Charlie,
0881345|CC|Roger.
0881351|CDR|And just to round out things as we pitch back into LOI attitude, lo and behold from over the top of the LM came the Earth.
0881405|CC|Very good.
0881409|CDR|Got the whole thing in one big package.
0881513|CDR|Pretty interesting, Gordo. We can - we can see we're right over South America and, of course, we can see up the Gulf Coast. And it looks like Houston is covered with clouds, but poetically enough, we can see the Cape, at least we can see Florida.
0881531|CC|How about that.
0881705|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 88 hours 17 minutes into the mission of Apollo 17. Some 26 minutes now until Apollo 17 passes behind the Moon, coming up on the Lunar Orbit Insertion burn in which the spacecraft will start its initial orbit measuring 52 nautical miles by 170 nautical miles, an elliptical orbit around the Moon. That maneuver will take place at a Ground Elapsed Time of 88 hours 54 minutes into the flight, and will slow the spacecraft down considerably from its present velocity of some 5,700 feet per second. Presently, the Apollo 17 spacecraft is 1,528 nautical miles out from the Moon, approaching at 5730 feet per second. After the spacecraft passes behind the Moon, 25 minutes from now, assuming as successful lunar orbit insertion burn, it should come from behind the east face of the Moon, the limb of the Moon, at approximately 33 minutes later. It'll take a few moments for the ground stations to lock up on the downlink from the spacecraft even though the theoretical contact time is roughly 33 minutes after loss of signal. At 88 hours 18 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
0881903|CMP|Yes, a VERB 41 NOUN 91. And I'm on VOX now. Get the commander's light. (Laughter)
0881922|CC|Ron, you're loud and clear on VOX.
0881927|CMP|Okay, Gordo. We're in attitude now.
0881931|CC|Roger.
0882047|CMP|Okay, Houston. The star sextant check is GO. We've got it in the sextant.
0882053|CC|Roger.
0882206|CMP|Okay. Okay. Let's go ahead and go and do the P40; 22 - about - -
0882215|CDR|How many?
0882215|CMP|- - about 20 minutes. Well, it looks like it's going pretty close to where we want to be anyhow.
0882307|CMP|Okay - okay.
0882416|CMP|... back the other way.
0882424|CDR|Okay, Gordo. We're standing by in P40.
0882431|CC|Roger. We're watching you.
0882438|CDR|Okay. Everything is checking out good onboard.
0882443|CC|Roger.
0882448|CMP|Okay. Let's go over the cue cards. Okay. DELTA-V check's complete. Set the DELTA-V 2981.4. Okay. We have the pre-DELTA-V in standby. And the SIM bay's been checked, Jack?
0882526|LMP|Yes, it's been checked.
0882528|CMP|Okay. We're in RATE 2 on the BMAGs. Okay, no trim. We'll just leave 12 of them ON then. I've checked the DAP. Yes. Yes. Check it again. Yes. B/D - B/D ROLL. Get it? That's good. Plus 1.21 and minus 0.12.
0882640|CMP|Okay. The DAP is loaded.
0882641|CDR|Okay, Houston. The DAP looks good.
0882644|CC|Roger.
0882648|CMP|Okay. We're CMC and AUTO. And we're at the pad attitude now. Okay. Boresight sextant star check is complete. Yes, I did it once. Let's try it again. It kind of drifts quite a bit.
0882725|CMP|Okay. The old GDC is aligned.
0882731|CMP|Okay. DIRECT ULLAGE breakers are going IN. PITCH 1. YAW 1. MAIN A circuit breakers are IN. The rest of them are all IN.
0882749|CMP|DAP control and SPS are all CLOSED.
0882754|CMP|Okay. We have three of them in RATE COMMAND. That looks like about DEAD BAND, RATE to LOW.
0882820|CMP|SCS TVC is in RATE COMMAND.
0882827|CMP|Okay. CG is in LM/CSM.
0882831|CMP|GIMBAL DRIVE: PITCH 1, YAW 1, AUTO. PITCH and YAW in AUTO.
0882843|CDR|Okay, Gordo. We're down to 6 minutes in the checklist.
0882846|CC|Roger, Gene.
0882918|CMP|Okay.
0883014|CMP|Okay.
0883027|CMP|Okay.
0883043|CMP|Okay. We keep tight limits, though, to 1 plus 10, huh? Okay. Here we go; 25 - 25 21. BR. That's not it. Getting tight - tight lim - 340. Yes.
0883129|CMP|06:38. Single-bank burn time is 06:51. I'll start on BANK A first. That - that means we may get a chug when we start on BANK B.
0883158|CMP|Yes, but if - Okay.
0883237|CMP|Oh, my scissors flew up and disappeared somewhere. I'll have a hard time eating if you guys take all the scissors with you.
0883257|CMP|But my teeth are pretty good though.
0883333|CMP|Okay.
0883354|CMP|That's unless you start - start an hour and 20 minutes late, and then it's burn time plus 5.
0883413|CMP|Okay.
0883422|CMP|Okay.
0883444|CC|Apollo 17, Houston. If - if you three are interested in sticking around awhile, you have our GO for LOI.
0883454|CDR|Roger, Houston. Understand. America is GO for LOI. And let it be known that the crew of America is GO for LOI.
0883506|CC|Roger that.
0883520|CMP|I'm kind of worried about this camera back here. It might come banging down.
0883637|CMP|(laughter) Yes. Yes.
0883652|CMP|(Humming)
0883700|CMP|Okay ...
0883753|CMP|Okay. Panel 8 looks good.
0883803|CMP|Okay. We're 5/1, 1/2, CMC, GDC. COMMAND, RATE COMMAND, RATE COMMAND.
0883811|CMP|LIMIT CYCLE is OFF. DEAD BAND, MIN. RATE to LOW. TRANS CONTROL POWER is OFF.
0883815|CMP|A - AC DIRECTS are OFF CMC in AUTO, RATE 2, RATE 2, RATE 2.
0883824|CMP|TVC is RATE COMMAND. GIMBAL MOTORS are OFF.
0883828|CMP|LM/CSM, ELS is AUTO - I mean the ELS is MANUAL.
0883833|CMP|RCS LOGIC is OFF. ROLL is OFF. .05G. AC and GPI.
0883841|CMP|GIMBAL DRIVEs in AUTO. Everything looks good.
0883858|CMP|(Humming)
0884008|CMP|(Humming)
0884132|LMP|Four minutes - a little better.
0884138|CDR|Hello, Gordy. As we approach LOS, we've still got America out the view of the hatch window. We'll see you at 89:16:29.
0884207|CC|Okay, Gene. About 1 minute left until LOS. You have our wishes for a good burn.
0884217|CDR|Thank you, sir. We shall have one.
0884232|CMP|Okay.
0884255|CDR|And, Gordy, I assure you we will be out at 16:40.
0884301|CC|Very good.
0884338|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 88 hours 43 minutes into the Mission of Apollo 17. We have had loss of signal as Apollo 17 coasted behind the Moon on the start of the first lunar orbit, 10 minutes and 28 seconds away from Lunar Orbit Insertion maneuver. A retrograde service propulsion system burn of some 2,988 feet per second. Assuming a successful burn, the spacecraft should come out from behind the Moon at 89:16:29 Ground Elapsed Time as Gene Cernan promised it would before they went behind the Moon. At loss of signal, the spacecraft was some 395 miles above the surface of the Moon, traveling at a velocity of 7,241 feet per second. 9 minutes and 30 seconds - MARK, until LOI ignition. At 88:44 and returning just before acquisition of signal, as Apollo 17 comes from behind the Moon, this is Apollo Control.
0891530|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 89 hours, 15 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Some 55 seconds until Apollo 17 comes from behind the Moon, on the start of the first Lunar Orbit. We're awaiting appearance of the spacecraft and word that the burn went successful, which apparently it has because the spacecraft without a burn would have appeared some 8 minutes ago. The ignition time is 88:54:21 in Ground Elapsed Time. Should be getting lock on fairly soon, zero. That was the theoretical acquisition time. Of course, it does take a few seconds for the ground station to lock on to the signal from the spacecraft. We're awaiting word from the communications officer that we have indeed gotten a signal and telemetry from the spacecraft.
0891700|CMP|Didn't ... me yet.
0891706|CMP|No, it's not in yet. Well, yes, it is. There's AOS limits right there.
0891714|CMP|I think we just passed Hertz and -
0891717|CC|Hello there, America. We hear you talking.
0891731|CMP|AUTO and NARROW. Yes, AUTO and NARROW.
0891748|CMP|Good; I thought it dropped off. Hey, it dropped off.
0891755|CMP|Minus 43 and 345.
0891758|CC|Hello, America; this is Houston. How do you: read?
0891801|CMP|Attitude? Yes, 65, 60, 8. Yes, we're in attitude.
0891821|CC|America, Houston. Over.
0891842|CMP|Don't tell me the old high-gain crumped.
0891849|CMP|Okay. Let's see you're MANUAL -
0891908|CMP|Yes, we started to get it - awhile ago.
0891911|CMP|Yes, put it in AUTO and NARROW.
0891913|CMP|There.
0891936|CMP|The time?
0891947|CMP|Yes, we're at the edge of Marginis.
0892005|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Here in the Control Center we are hearing the crew aboard the spacecraft of Apollo 17 very clearly, however the ground has not be able to fully lock up on the spacecraft with the so-called uplink, on the voice uplink. And apparently it has to do with the 85 foot antenna at Goldstone. We're continuing to stand by until the 2-way communications are complete. An hour and 20 minutes before loss of signal as we go across the face of the Moon, the front face of the Moon on the first Lunar Orbit. At 89:20 and standing by, this is Apollo Control.
0892016|CMP|There's Al-Biruni over here.
0892102|CDR|Okay. It came in then. There it goes. Hello!
0892113|CC|Hello, America. How do you read Houston? Over.
0892118|CDR|America - Houston, this is America. You can breathe easier. America has arrived on station for the challenge ahead.
0892127|CC|Very good. We've been hearing you for a couple of minutes now. We've had a ground site problem, but you're loud and clear now.
0892137|CDR|Okay. That's what we sort of thought, Gordo. The SPS burn could not have been more nominal. I've got some numbers for you, if you're ready to copy.
0892146|CC|Go ahead.
0892155|CDR|Okay, TIG was on time. TIG was on time, burn time was 6 plus 33, VG is 29899; roll was 008; pitch, 357; yaw, 006; all at the end of the burn. Residuals minus 0.3, plus 0.1, and 0. DELTA-VC, was minus 6.8; oxidizer, 34.0; fuel, 34.5; unbalance is 110, decrease. The CMC holds us in a 170.3 by 52.5.
0892249|CC|That sounds great, Gene.
0892254|CDR|It was an auto ignition. It was an auto shutdown. I think any comments during the burn are on the tape. But, to me, it was probably the smoothest and quietest SPS burn I ever remember.
0892308|CC|Roger.
0892310|LMP|Houston, this is Jack. The PUGS was erratic. It's the only thing I noticed that was offnominal. It - it bounced ground a lot, in bouncing arou - initially for about a minute - around - oh, 1.8 decrease, then it gradually started to diverge from that to a more decrease, down to about 2.5 or make that 3 decrease. And I went to DECREASE on the switch; and about the time of crossover, I had it at - oh, about 1 decrease and it crossed over and stabilized at zero, and I went to NORMAL and it stayed there the rest of the burn - until just near the end, it started to go decrease again.
0892402|CC|Okay, we copy that, Jack.
0892406|LMP|Okay, Gordo, did you by any chance get the S-IVB impact?
0892412|CC|We're - Okay, the new impact time for that is 89:39, so we haven't quite got there yet.
0892426|CDR|Okay. Thank you.
0892429|CMP|And, Houston - Ron here. Something a little bit of a surprise to me. When I turned on bank A, the chamber pressure came up to 87 percent, and stayed there essentially. Five seconds later, I put on band B, the chamber pressure rose to 90 - about 91 - somewhere in that area. And then, throughout the burn, chamber pressure increased, which you'll see on the strip chart. But I was sure surprised at only 87 percent when we started it. It looked like the velocity gained versus time was correct throughout the burn, though. The maximum the chamber pressure ever got to was about 97 percent, and that was toward the end of the burn.
0892521|CC|Roger, Ron.
0892610|CDR|A little disappointed here, Gordo. I brought an airborne and a ground geologist along with me and it took them until AOS to make sure they knew where we were.
0892620|CMP|Ha, ha, ha. That's not true.
0892623|CC|Roger.
0892625|CMP|My big problem was all the holes were hills when I first started. Looked just like you had the picture upside down.
0892632|CC|Roger, Ron. I have a couple pan camera photo pads for you.
0892650|LMP|Go ahead, Gordo.
0892652|CC|Okay, the first one goes in the Flight Plan at 90:45, and the start time is 090:50:32. Stop time is 091:10:57. Go ahead.
0892716|LMP|Okay, I got 090:50:32 and 091:10:57.
0892721|CC|Okay, and next one goes on the next page. Start time is 091:18:05. Stop time is 091:27:43.
0892745|LMP|91:18:05, 91:27:43.
0892753|CC|That's right.
0892757|LMP|Okay, Gordy, I turned the PAN CAMERA, OFF, there about 30 seconds ago and the post-SPS burn checks are complete. LOGIC - no, that's - well, just a minute. The post-SPS burns are complete down to LOGIC POWER, two, to DEPLOY/RETRACT. No, that's your Flight Plan. Okay? MODE is STANDBY.
0892832|LMP|MARK it. POWER is ON on the PAN CAMERA. Okay, Houston, we're waiting your cue on the power.
0892843|CC|Okay on that, and there'll be no update to the TEI-4 pad. Over.
0892851|LMP|Beautiful.
0892902|LMP|Here's Smythii, gang. Coming over Mare - No, let's see, Crisium. coming over Crisium. It's - coming underneath us now.
0892921|LMP|I will have in a jiffy. Okay, I'm going to hang off then a little bit. Get a - Boy, this window.
0892944|CDR|And, Gordo, how did the spacecraft look to you as we came around?
0892950|CC|Real good, Geno. Nothing to report.
0892957|CDR|Very fine. Thank you.
0893004|LMP|(Laughter) One little minor problem, Gordy, is that we're breathing so hard that the windows are fogging up on the inside for a change.
0893024|CC|Okay, and we'd like the PAN CAMERA POWER, off, now. The pan camera run; good.
0893038|CDR|Beautiful.
0893043|LMP|Oh, boy, there is Picard - or Peirce, one of the two.
0893100|LMP|Okay, Gordy, all those dark and light albedo changes around Picard and Peirce are not obvious at this particular angle yet. There's some hint of them.
0893118|CC|Roger.
0893121|LMP|The - rim - is there one farther south of Peirce?
0893129|LMP|Which - is it far - is the one farthest - Picard, yes.
0893138|LMP|Picard, I think, is the one I'm looking at. Yes, it is.
0893143|PAO|MARK. 8 minutes to SIV-B impact.
0893146|LMP|Yes, and I can see Peirce now just - behind the rendezvous antenna - or radar. And - Yes, way out there, you ought to start seeing them.
0893202|CMP|I guess I ought to get that other stuff on the camera, huh?
0893209|LMP|Okay. We're just about over the top of Picard, and the rim materials, which go out about a third of a crater in diameter, as near as I can tell, are - are distinctly darker but not by much. They're more gray, really, then the gray-tan, or tannish gray of the rest of the mare.
0893233|CC|Roger.
0893238|CC|Now we assume you're all set up or about to get that way for the landing site photos.
0893246|LMP|Yes, sir. There is no obvious ray pattern or secondary pattern outside of that blanket around Picard.
0893307|CC|Roger.
0893308|LMP|I see no loops or obvious alignment that would be related to that crater. There are blocks - look like great big blocky areas on the rim.
0893321|CC|Roger.
0893328|PAO|This is Apollo Control, some 6 minutes 13 seconds away from S-IVB impact. The traces - seismograph traces - from Apollo 14 and Apollo 16 will be visible in the news room video monitors. There will be a briefing in the small briefing room on the seismology of the impact. Some 5 minutes 43 seconds now away from S-IVB predicted impact.
0893408|LMP|Do they want the 80-millimeter lens on these terminators now?
0893432|LMP|There's Taruntius, Ron.
0893437|LMP|Yes, I guess that's right.
0893458|LMP|I've got to get another magazine on it.
0893511|CC|America, can you verify the position of the P - PU valve at this time for us?
0893518|CDR|Roger. It's in NORMAL.
0893521|CC|Okay.
0893544|LMP|Macrobius, Macrobius, my friend.
0893546|CDR|No, it's Microbus [sic].
0893557|LMP|Okay, I'm loaded up for your terminator, Ron. What's - is it not out of 105, or what? is it - Okay, 80-millimeter or -
0893613|CMP|80.
0893614|LMP|80 - -
0893615|CMP|... Millimeter ... f/11 at 1/500 ...
0893618|LMP|Okay.
0893619|CMP|80-millimeter.
0893621|LMP|Okay.
0893622|CMP|f/11 at 1/500.
0893623|LMP|Five frames over the terminator, huh?
0893625|CMP|12 frames.
0893626|LMP|12 frames. Very good. How soon do I start?
0893629|CMP|Well, about -
0893633|LMP|Okay.
0893636|LMP|Okay, in about 5 minutes, all right.
0893639|LMP|Gordy, you'd be interested - there's a crater that just on - on the west rim of Crisium. Relatively fresh rim - fairly crisp rim - but no strong ray pattern. There's no ray pattern apparent at all. It looks like it's pre - the plains material around it - that - since they come right up over the - right up to the edge of the crater in one spot. That is Posidonius. That's right. That's what I'm looking at.
0893720|CC|Roger.
0893726|LMP|Not Posidonius, Proclus. That's what I'm describing. You know I - You're looking where?
0893736|CDR|... 41.
0893738|LMP|Infamous Proclus. Okay, give me a mark when I'm - Hey, look at the - -
0893750|CDR|Okay, I'll give you a mark, Jack.
0893751|LMP|At the Cauchy Rilles here. Man, is that neat. Let me see. Going to have to -
0893806|CDR|One right there with the shadowed peak in there. Right? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. And that's out of this window, huh? I'm not - sure I'm seeing it yet.
0893840|LMP|Manischewitz! Look at those terminators.
0893842|CDR|Shadows.
0893844|PAO|One minute MARK to the S-IVB impact.
0893849|LMP|There's the mare domes for the central craters. They're certainly obvious. In - northern part of - Let's see -
0893905|CDR|The lineations that trend to the northwest through this entire - entire section - they go through the - mostly through the highlands.
0893921|LMP|I can get the pictures. is it directly out of window 5? Okay. We've got about another minute and a half. I'm going to proceed here at 41.
0893932|CMP|It'll be right underneath the groundtrack. It's right under it.
0893935|LMP|Well, that's the way we're going. I'm taking them east-west.
0893938|CMP|Okay. I ...
0893940|LMP|O - yes. Okay.
0893949|CDR|Hey, Jack, we're at - coming up on 40.
0894003|PAO|We had loss of signal right on-time with the instrument unit of the Saturn IVB which - -
0894007|CC|... about a minute to PRO on P20.
0894009|CDR|Yes. We're at 40 - Okay, I'm with you, Gordo. Thank you.
0894027|PAO|Seismic signals beginning to come in.
0894030|CMP|Okay, you got it.
0894038|LMP|Okay.
0894052|CDR|Don't forget to PRO, Ron; you've got - you got 8 seconds.
0894101|CDR|MARK it - 41. Okay, I guess you can - -
0894108|CMP|Goes. With the usual FAO flight planning, that was a good time.
0894117|CC|Roger.
0894118|CMP|Hey, you can even see horizon in the - earthshine out there.
0894126|CDR|Boy, you sure can. You can see an earthlit horizon out there into the dark part of the Moon.
0894134|CMP|Can you see the landing site? I think it's going to be in the darkness.
0894137|CDR|You know, I - it - The shadows are so contrasting here, Ron, that I -
0894144|CDR|Give me that thing a minute.
0894159|LMP|Donius [sic]. There's le Monnier, the landing site. I can't -
0894208|CDR|No, it's just - it's just dark.
0894209|LMP|Isn't it a little north of track?
0894212|CDR|No, I think it's right below us, Jack. I think it's right smack below us.
0894216|LMP|In darkness ..
0894217|CDR|Yes, I yes, it is. I can't - I think I'm looking at Littrow right there, right below us. But I can't quite tell.
0894231|CDR|If I could see Vitruvius, I'd have a better handle on it.
0894236|CC|A reminder to go to f/4 and 1/250 on the last six pictures.
0894244|CDR|Roger. That's Posidonius all right, le Monnier; we're here early.
0894304|LMP|Boy, I tell you, there's no question that right at the terminator you - you pick up relief that you normally would not believe is there in the mare. I remember Bill Anders talking about the appearance of a sea swell within the mare itself and that's certainly clearly shown right at the terminator. Plus you start to see the shadows from all the very small craters that otherwise don't show up as much more that just little depressions, if that.
0894335|CC|Okay. We need ACCEPT so we can give you a landing site REFSMMAT.
0894344|CMP|Okay, you have it.
0894406|LMP|Yes. Okay, I think that will do her. Okay, Houston. I cheated. I took three extra pictures, and those were at 2.8 and a 250th at the end.
0894422|CC|Okay, Jack.
0894425|LMP|And, your - actually your times might have been a little off, because I was just about ready to lose the terminator because of the maneuver - are we maneuvering or have we? Yes. But, I think we got a good set going up to the terminator.
0894450|CC|Roger.
0894451|LMP|Plus a couple of shots - a few shots on the CEX mag Quebec Que - No, mag Kilo Kilo as we came around the Moon and that number's now on 20. Kilo Kilo is 20, and Quebec Quebec is 42.
0894516|CC|Okay, we need the IR, ON, now.
0894521|LMP|Okay, back to work.
0894528|CC|It's your computer; the up-link's in there, and you can go back to BLOCK.
0894530|LMP|IR going ON -
0894532|LMP|MARK it.
0894545|LMP|Yes, enough - enough tourist activity.
0894602|LMP|Warm in here, isn't it?
0894615|CC|America, a couple of items. Would you verify the S-BAND AUX TV switch is in the SCIENCE position? And one other thing, we think you were in LOW BIT RATE during the burn.
0894632|LMP|Okay, it's in SCIENCE and we very definitely were in HIGH BIT RATE during the burn by the checklist.
0894639|CC|Roger. We may have a problem there because it looks like LOW to us on the data. We'll check further.
0894701|LMP|Hey, Gordy, there was - Ron questioned - brought up the question or possibility of not having gone to COMMAND RESET; but, just before we left you, you'll probably be able to see that I went COMMAND RESET and turned on the tape, because I remember seeing the tape motion.
0894718|CC|Okay, Jack. We're discussing it - what happened there.
0894835|CC|America, you can go back to BLOCK.
0895152|LMP|Okay, Houston. How do you read 17?
0895155|CC|You're loud and clear, Jack.
0895159|LMP|Okay. Before we really got concentrating on the burn, and I had an opportunity to - we all had an opportunity to look at Korolev, at a very low grazing Sun, one of the striking things was the - to me was the extreme absence of relief, the very smooth surface that existed in Korolev, independent, of course, of the craters that are penetrating that surface. And it looked like there was a ring in the floor - outsi - next to the wall, about maybe one-sixth of a crater radius, that was somewhat brighter at the low grazing Sun, suggesting it may have had a different slope. And I believe I'm correct in saying that the inner floor may be slightly raised. We'll try to make other observations this next time around on that one, but there was just a very smooth floor. The light plains material in that crater is very smooth.
0895313|CC|Okay; understand. One quick word from FAO's - -
0895318|LMP|And, of course, that's independent - -
0895319|CC|- - film watchers here, has to do with optional photographs. We'd rather you take the optional photographs on either OO or PP and reserve KK for the scheduled photographs. And, as it stands now, we've got to reserve 80 frames on either OO or PP for scheduled photography. Over.
0895342|LMP|Okay, you have to keep track of that. We need - I was hoping we had an optional capability on our first rev, and we'll work it out.
0895353|CC|We do. We just want to put them on OO.
0895359|CC|That's right; just stick them on OO.
0895448|CC|Jack, the problem on the high and low bit rate there was a synchronization problem between you on the burn checklist and us on the ground on our pre-LOS command. No hardware problems, and I don't think it will be a problem in the future.
0895508|LMP|Okay. But you did lose the high bit rate. is that correct?
0895511|CC|That's affirmative. We just had low bit rate during the burn.
0895518|LMP|Okay. I may have jumped the gun on you there a little bit. But I thought we were supposed to do that just before we went AOS - LOS. I think I did it about a minute before.
0895532|CC|Okay. It was almost identi - simultaneous with our sending the command. You've got about 4 minutes to start looking at Copernicus coming here.
0895544|LMP|Okay. Thank you. We're just - Sun's Just setting.
0895607|LMP|Okay, I have a visual on Copernicus.
0895705|CC|And by the way, the S-IVB crunched in on time, and it's been ringing the ALSEP seismometers like mad for some time now.
0895742|LMP|VOX, and that's VOX. How do you read the LMP, Gordy?
0895745|CC|Loud and clear, Jack.
0895748|LMP|Thank you. Okay, good. All right, I've got a visual on Eratosthenes and Copernicus. The - they are obviously different-age craters in this light. You can see the ray patterns in Copernicus moderately well. You can even tell that they do cross Eratosthenes. Stadius shows up as a very clear dark area to the southwest of Eratosthenes. Now, one of the things that we mapped on the southeast and south rim of Copernicus were dark albedo areas within the ejecta. And those are apparent here, very clearly. And also, within - on the upper portion of the rim and on the benches, in that quadrant. The walls - there are the dark spots - lower albedo material that we mapped. They are - form linear patterns along the benches, apparently. Although the bench - the topography is not too clear. But the dark spots are in arcuate linear arrangement parallel to the rim. And they appear to have - be elongate along radius - along the radius of the crater.
0895934|CC|Roger, Jack.
0895936|LMP|This is in the southeast - southeast quadrant I'm referring to. Copernicus H is also very obvious as a dark-rimmed crater, relative to the albedo of the ejecta blanket. And the northwest quadrant, which we mapped as a smooth floor material and somewhat darker albedo, is just as apparent here, although all the contrasts, of course, are less. The main thing that you can pick out in earthshine are albedo distinctions. Now - now we - we - I remember that we also, at one time - and I can't remember whether it made the final map or not - mapped an arcuate fault structure, based on the change in albedo. And this was on the southwest quadrant of Copernicus. And that crossed the southern rim, more or less north-south, went down and curved across the floor and up the southwest rim, and that is a very clear arcuate pattern in this lighting. Darker albedo than the rest of the crater. And along the arc, there appear to be a couple or three even darker spots - much as we thought we saw in some of the early photography.
0900123|CC|Roger.
0900124|LMP|There is a general streaking - radial streaking - within that arcuate dark area that radiates radially from the crater, and if I had to project, the dark area would - north - whose northeast terminus is the arc in the crater, I'd project it off to southeast about crater diameter and a half, maybe. Now there's - I'm getting - essentially directly overhead, and again the dark spots within the crater wall are still apparent, and the streaming or the radial elongation of these spots is clear. Now, on the lower wall - that's below the first bench - I can see four of these dark areas, and on the next wall above that, above the first bench, there are two - two obvious ones and a couple that are somewhat more subtle.
0900243|CC|Okay - -
0900244|LMP|In the middle of the - -
0900245|CC|- - Can you see anything of the - that stuff we were wondering about in the central peaks?
0900251|LMP|No, Gordy, I can't. The - there's very little indication of relief in earthshine and particularly at this high Sun ang - high Earth angle, pardon the expression.
0900307|CC|Roger.
0900308|LMP|The central peaks do stand out, though, as a much lighter albedo area within the crater. It looks to me like the best thing you can do in earthshine is work with albedos. Knowing the general topography from the - from the pre - earlier photography. We're coming up on Kepler now. Copernicus is out of my view in window 5 - Maybe Ron sees it. Do you, Ron?
0900344|CMP|No, it's out of ny view now, too.
0900349|LMP|Okay, we, we - -
0900350|CDR|Can you see Reinhold over there?
0900353|LMP|Reinhold, I was not conscious - Yes, I can see Reinhold. Reinhold is one of the craters just like Copernicus that may have contributed ejecta into the Apollo 12 soil. Do you see anything - -
0900405|CMP|An S - an S-IVB - 16's S-IVB hit out there to the south, I think.
0900410|LMP|Well, I don't - -
0900412|CMP|No, I don't think you1d see it.
0900413|LMP|I don't see anything that would indicate that. Reinhold is an Eratosthenian Age crater, as you may recall. It's crossed, very obviously even in this light, by the Copernican rays, which is prime - the main way we determine the age, other than it doesn't have any rays itself. Although, on the good photography we now have, we know it has secondary crater patterns around it.
0900441|CDR|You're not looking at the same crater I am then.
0900446|LMP|Reinhold is right down here, Geno.
0900447|CDR|Where are you looking ...
0900448|LMP|Well, it's south of Copernicus.
0900450|CDR|Okay, I'm looking up here.
0900452|LMP|South and a little west.
0900454|CDR|I don't have the same view you have.
0900458|LMP|Okay, I can see Lansberg now. And I'm afraid I can't shed any light, pardon the expression, on the old question we've had about the age of Lansberg relative to the mare.
0900516|CC|Okay.
0900525|LMP|Kepler ray pattern is very striking in this light, An anastomoting - mosing series of - of bands which only average being radial. In most cases, they're a little off radial, but by joining together, they give you a general radial pattern.
0900550|CDR|I just wanted to see a -
0900552|LMP|Okay. Out the window 4, I have an excellent view of Kepler. Once again, albedo differences, such as the - are very clear - such as the distinction between the wall - light - or brighter wall materials and the rim which, in itself, is brighter than the surrounding mare. We can look right down some of the rays, and the rays are not completely linear. I'm looking now to the northwest. Gene, you can see Aristarchus way up there in the northwest. See it?
0900631|CDR|Yes. It's coming into ...
0900632|LMP|You ought to have a good view of Aristarchus. Very bright, up in the northwest part of our field of view.
0900637|CDR|The inside of that crater almost looks as if it's backlit.
0900641|LMP|That's right. Well, it should be (chuckle). Strangely enough.
0900645|LMP|And - but I want - these rays when contrast to the - maybe the feeling one would have that they are - once they get started, they form a linear pattern across the surface. They don't seem to have done that. As a matter of fact, they're quite strikingly curved along their pattern. They'll break from the general radius they're out on, curve away and then curve back. Some - all - let's see, there are one - one, two, three, four - four rays that go from out - to the northwest of Kepler, all of which show that nonlinear characteristic.
0900733|CDR|Yes, they're all radial, though-
0900734|LMP|They are radial, in general. But when you look at them in detail, only portions of them are radial. And a single ray, which you can follow continuously, will bend and then curve back.
0900749|CMP|The - it's unique. We've got rays from - I guess those must be Copernicus over here - those long ones out to the right, which you might not be able to see. Kepler and Reiner are all - all intermingling up here.
0900805|LMP|Yes, this is the area now we're going over where the gamma ray work on 15 indicated a relatively high radioactivity. And - not yet, it's -
0900825|CMP|Houston, America here. Do you see the torquing angles?
0900831|LMP|I was going to look for the Hortensius domes near Copernicus, but got sidetracked with Kepler and missed them.
0900838|CC|Okay, ... torquing angles, Ron,
0900839|LMP|They are not obvious, though, in looking in the general direction -
0900844|CMP|Okay, I'll torque it to 845.
0900847|CC|Roger.
0900856|LMP|Okay, we're getting out into Procellarum - Oceanus Procellarum proper now and, before long, should pick up the medial ridge that makes that mare so distinctive from the other mare. Actually, the ridge that stretches something like 2000 kilometers north to south, if you want to tie a vari - a number of things together. And, probably is the lun - the Moon's closest analogy to an oceanic ridge, which has - which have been in the news over the last decade.
0900934|CC|Roger.
0900950|LMP|Once again, the topography of the Procellarum Mare is not clear in this light. It's just not quite enough light to give you strong, distinct shadows, at least not yet at this Earth angle.
0901007|CC|Okay. And as you get the camera set up for the orbital science pictures of Galois would want to change and use magazine OO instead of KK. That's listed in the Flight Plan at 90:20.
0901024|LMP|Okay, we'll - we'll do that.
0901032|LMP|Okay I'm - out of the window 4, I'm able to see some of the Rima Gamma materials, and it's - awful hard to say more than just the fact there is a very clear light-colored pattern off to the north - of our position at any rate. I think all I can say is that I've seen it. I can't give you much information on it.
0901117|CC|Okay.
0901120|LMP|We can see the area where Marius Hills should be, although it's not an obvious topographic feature in this light. Still see Aristarchus off up there shining like a star, if the Moon could have stars.
0901141|CMP|Okay, Houston. I'm going to torque those cos - coarse align errors out at 1, 2.
0901149|CC|Roger, Ron.
0901155|LMP|And - -
0901203|CDR|You squared away?
0901208|CMP|It's good to be able to see some stars out of the telescope. It's the first time I've been able to see any.
0901214|LMP|Gordy, we have a - a very clear zero phase point for the earthlight. It's certainly not a strong contrast for the Sun, but it's out there. And within it, again, the fresh craters tend to brighten - quite a bit more than the surrounding mare. Still looking at Oceanus Procellarum. And now, out window 3, up to the northwest, Grimaldi is starting to show up - a very obvious dark area within the highlands of that part of the Moon - and one of the darkest mare regions that we have seen on the - on the Moon. It's comparable, at least in the photographs, to that of Tsiolkovsky.
0901326|CC|Roger.
0901327|LMP|Normally, of course, we think of the dark mare as being the younger basalt flows that - on the Moon, but in our case, of course, young means something on the order of 3 billion years or older.
0901345|CC|Roger.
0901345|LMP|For our interp - If we can extrapolate from the samples returned by other missions.
0901404|LMP|Amazing how far over - now the highlands to the west of Procellarum are - still are bright, and the contrast between fresh craters and the normal highland are very - are very obvious still in earthlight, particularly along the zero phase point with respect to the Earth. Rima Gamma now is - is coming a little bit closer to our oval track in the horseshoe in the - larger and more western end of it; the dark horseshoe is quite clear in this light. It's a west - or northwest-pointing horseshoe, as is the complete trend of that strange feature. I think Ron is going to have an excellent chance to study these light-colored swirls within the mare and other parts of the Moon. We had some good views of them and Mare Marginis and to the east of Crisium - Mare Crisium, and he should - if there is anything to be seen, he should be able to see it for - during the next few days.
0901536|CC|Okeydoke.
0901551|CDR|Say, Gordo, something I Just noticed here in working with the GDC what have you. I - looked at the PC gauge, and in the PZ - PC position, there is a continuous bias on it now of about, oh, 7 percent, and if I switch to ALPHA, it goes to zero. We never saw that bias before this last burn.
0901616|CC|Roger, Gene.
0901635|LMP|Hey, Gordy, I'm looking right up the western edge of the Procellarum mare where it contacts the - the - the high - western highlands of the Moon, and we're just about to fly a little bit south of Grimaldi. That edge is very irregular. There is no obvious indications that it - there are large basins that have been flooded by mare that have formed that edge, but, again, the topographic distinctions possible in this light are small. Now I'm starting to see that there are shadows in the craters.
0901722|CC|Roger.
0901723|LMP|That's the small craters. There, in the Mare Procellarum closest to Grimaldi, there are two arcuate rilles. Looks like they're probably V-shaped in their cross section. I'm sure we've seen those on the photographs much better than I can see them here. Those - the rille patterns, though, do seem to project over into the highlands.
0901803|CC|Okay.
0901804|LMP|To the north of that - to the north of that bay of mare. Just interrupt.
0901811|LMP|Hey, I just saw a flash on the lunar surface!
0901816|CC|Oh, yes?
0901818|LMP|It was just out there north of Grimaldi. Just north of Grimaldi. You might see if you got anything on your seismometers, although a small impact probably would give a fair amount of visible light.
0901832|CC|Okay. We'll check.
0901834|LMP|It was a bright little flash right out there near that crater. See the crater right at the edge of Grimaldi. Then there is another one north of it. Fairly sharp one north of it is where there was just a pin prick of light.
0901851|CC|How about putting an X on the map where you saw it.
0901852|LMP|I keep looking occasionally for - yes, we will. I - I was planning on looking for those kind of things. Starting to see the edge of Orientale, Gordy. Way off to the west. Hey, just yell, Gene, anytime you - -
0901947|LMP|Gordy, to the north of Grimaldi there is a large basin that is about the same size but only incompletely filled with mare in its northeastern quadrant. The rest of it looks like a fairly irregular and hummocky floor material of some kind.
0902011|CC|Roger.
0902012|LMP|But it's almost the same size as Grimaldi. It even looks like it is a little bit deeper, but, of course, Grimaldi has considerable fill. Grimaldi on its eastern edge has some of the graben, or it's rim, if you will, is cut by three or four anastomosing grabens that make it look like some of the bench areas in the larger basins.
0902100|LMP|Okay, the first ring of Orientale is showing up. The inner - next ring in is extremely obvious; got some very bright east - east-facing slopes.
0902117|CDR|I'll turn off the intercom.
0902124|LMP|It has some very bright east-facing slopes, and you can see the bands of mare that are filling the - both the first bench area and the inner bench.
0902153|LMP|Any time you need us, Gordy, just interrupt me.
0902157|CC|Okay; we'll do that.
0902203|LMP|Now, as I look north along the first bench, that's the first bench from the outside, one inside the Cordillerian ring. I better check that; I may have my names mixed up. Got Orientale, there - handy? ... see. Should be on there. Yes, this is what I need. What's the name - they got a name on that ridge, there? That's Rook Mountains. Yes, the Cordillera. Yes, that's right. Looking just west of the Cordillera on the first bench, as I look north, in this light, which is casting some shadows now, Gordy, over in here, it looks extremely smooth. Now this is not mare; it's lighter albedo, lighter reflectivity than the mare, and, although there are patches of mare in the lower areas in it. But looking along that plain, in fact, a lar - a long linear plain, it - it looks quite smooth with only some very broad undulations that appear to be roughly radial to Orientale itself. The more - closer we get to it, the more I see minor relief showing up. I start to see the shadows, I guess. And that relief seems to bring out a hummocky texture in - in addition to the craters you would expect to see there.
0902359|CC|Roger.
0902400|LMP|I won't try to give you a trend on the hummocks because I think the shadows are biasing my view; they do ap	pear to be north-south trending, but I think that is because of the shadow patterns. This is a spectacular sight, you guys; you ought to take a look at Orientale. One of the largest fresh basins on the Moon. It still is probably 4 billion years old, or 3.8 at any rate, if our dating criteria are any - any good. It has the outer Cordillerian ring and the inner ring called the Rook Mountains - very, very nicely shown. There are massifs on that inner ring, the Rook Mountain ring; there are massif complexes much like what we'll be studying at Taurus-Littrow. There are low areas, nonmare areas, that are comparable to some - to the Taurus - the valley that we'll be landing in. And, all in all, I think we'll find that our ring in the Taurus-Littrow area around Serenitatis is comparable in many regards to this Rook Mountain ring around Orientale. You want - did you interrupt, Gordy?
0902534|CC|No. I didn't say anything.
0902538|LMP|Okay; I thought I heard your key. Okay; in the inner portion of Orientale, as we approach a terminator, the lighting is still excellent. Matter of fact, it appears brighter than what we were looking at over at Copernicus. Now, part of that may be we're seeing much sharper relief since the slope - Earth-facing slopes are nicely lit, and the backfacing slopes, of course, are in shadow. The first portion of the bench inside the Rook Mountains is partially filled by mare. Now, the higher land in there is very smooth, in a gross sense, is a very smooth hummocky terrain, cut by roughly circumferential grabens. The trend of the hummocks themselves are not radial; they're more - well, they're about a 45-degree angle to the radius. They, in detail, have a much finer hackly texture, much like we've been able to see on photographs before. And, in general, you get the impression that, in several areas here, that that hackly tex-tured surface is draped over material that resembles the massifs of the Rook Mountains themselves. There's one area just to the north now of our track where there's a large, roughly equidimensional mountain mass, with a few projections of massiflike peaks through this hackly textured surface.
0902747|CC|Roger.
0902747|LMP|There are also some radial grabens; I just now picked one up, which we've also seen on the Orientale photographs taken by Lunar Orbiter. It's amazing how fresh appearing this basin looks, considering its great age. But it's - it probably is not - had any more violent a history than Imbrium. Now, we're getting up, just about to go over a delta-rim crater that's out in the basin. I don't remember the name of it offhand. But it's - be familiar to some of the geologists who have mapped this basin. It does not appear to have a strong impact ejecta blanket around it. It's filled with mare, and it's quite sharply in contrast to a crater of comparable size to the northwest. See that one, Ron; I don't know whether you can get it. I get a good view out of 5 now of that one. And, once again, it looks as if this hackly textured material that forms the higher hills in the inner bench - has a draped appearance over the, over preexisting terrain, and, in fact, along the ridges of the hummocks, you - we now can pick up little rilles that roughly parallel the hummocks, although not - not - not consistently. They do cross down into the valleys. But it has appearance that there may have been a tensional relief along the crest of each of the hummocks, or many of the hummocks.
0902953|CC|Roger.
0902953|LMP|Delta-rim crater just as has been, I think, discussed in the literature, has just that, delta rim with no obvious ejecta blanket around it, compared to other larger craters within the basin. We're directly over that crater right now. It's filled with mare, very smooth mare. Matter of fact, within that fill, I can see no - no craters. Getting very close to the Earth terminator, but you see good texture in the ejecta blanket of the large crater in the north part of the inner basin of Orientale. The radial ridge and valley patterns are very clear; the concentric coarse hummocks near the rim are apparent; and you can even see the second - patterns of secondaries, the larger secondaries, extending out away - radially out away from that crater. The south - the mare fill in the south floor of Copernicus, I mean of Orientale, is very smooth but does have the sea-swell texture that we saw over in Tranquillitatis.
0903130|CDR|Better let him say something before AOS.
0903140|CC|I ain't got nothing to say.
0903140|CDR|Houston, I guess we're getting close to AOS. We're getting close to AOS. Do you have some words for us?
0903151|CC|Okay. We show about 9 minutes to LOS. We'd like to clarify one thing, and that was on this tape recorder commands and high and low bit rate. And we just want to make it clear that preburn the 6 minute callout is HIGH BIT RATE, RECORD, FORWARD, COMMAND RESET. Did you - did you tell us a few minutes ago that you did indeed do all those at about 6 minutes?
0903226|LMP|Yes, Gordy, I certainly thought I did, but I can't specifically - I know the HIGH BIT RATE was there, because we switched to LOW later. I can't - I'm afraid I can't specifically verify the COMMAND RESET.
0903243|CDR|Gordy, I can specifically say that when those - after the bus stars came on, we called that out. I'm almost sure Jack did get it, because I had him then check the helium valves and the nitrogen - helium and the nitrogen valves,
0903258|CC|Okay. We're just trying to make sure if we - or to determine if we do have a switch problem. The INCO did send LOW BIT RATE, COMMAND, just prior to - to LOS there before LOI, which is the way it's called out in the Flight Plan. And then you should have come along later with a COMMAND RESET, setting the switch to HIGH BIT RATE, and the COMMAND RESET switched into HIGH BIT RATE mode, and for some reason it did not go into HIGH BIT RATE.
0903341|LMP|Well, you want to test it out here, before we go around?
0903346|CC|That's a pretty good thought. I think we will. On stand by. We'll give you - we'll figure out how we're going to do it here.
0903425|CC|Okay, Jack. We just now commanded LOW BIT RATE, and you're in LOW BIT RATE. We'd like you now to select HIGH and COMMAND RESET.
0903441|LMP|Okay. Gordy, you also have an oscillation in uplink signal strength and a clicking in the - in the audio. Do you read? We just went steady and at about 60 percent - 70 percent signal strength.
0903459|CC|Roger. We hear that.
0903503|LMP|Okay. I'm going to - you want me to go ahead and command HIGH and COMMAND RESET?
0903511|CC|That's affirmative. The HIGH GAIN just went WIDE BEAM, but we're still reading you loud and clear. Go ahead in HIGH BIT RATE and COMMAND RESET.
0903520|LMP|Okay. HIGH BIT RATE; COMMAND RESET.
0903536|CC|Okay; it seems to have worked properly, Jack.
0903546|LMP|Okay, Gordy. I may not have got the COMMAND RESET at 6 minutes. I - I - I just can't tell you right now.
0903557|CC|Okay; I want to assure you it was no big problem as far as the burn goes. No great loss there.
0903608|LMP|I hope not.
0903632|CC|America, Houston. About 5 minutes to LOS now. We'd like to have you go ahead and get the jet inhibits and the covers open as shown in the Flight Plan so we can see that before we lose you.
0903700|LMP|Okay; Gordy. IR COVER is coming OPEN.
0903704|LMP|MARK it.
0903705|CC|Roger.
0903709|LMP|Okay; UV COVER coming OPEN -
0903713|LMP|MARK it.
0903716|CC|Roger.
0903725|LMP|And you want me to stay in HIGH BIT RATE?
0903728|CC|That's affirmative. You're there. You're going to have to do it in a minute anyway, so since you're there already, stay there.
0903738|LMP|Okay. We're there; we've got tape motion.
0903743|CC|Okay.
0903749|CDR|Gordy, the deadban - or the A/C - B/D, A/C roll has been changed, and you should have the proper jet configuration now.
0903758|CC|Okay. We see it; it looks good, Geno.
0903803|CDR|Okay.
0903859|LMP|Okay; if you're still with us, we're going to OPEN up the MAPPING CAMERA/LASER ALTIMETER COVER.
0903904|CC|Okay, Jack.
0903928|LMP|Okay. We're going to EXTEND the MAPPING CAMERA.
0903934|CC|Roger on that.
0903935|LMP|Okay. Okay.
0903938|LMP|MARK. Barber pole.

0912434|CMP|Okay, Houston. We're with you on the OMNI Delta.
0912442|CC|Roger, Ron. Read you loud and clear.
0912448|CDR|Okay, Robert. We should have gotten everything right on up through AOS here in the Flight Plan.
0912457|CC|Good show.
0912501|CDR|And the pan camera should be running right now.
0912528|CMP|Okay, Houston. America here. We stopped the orbital photo path, frame 59. And at about the sub-stellar point, we took 59 to 66, and frame 67 was taken of the, oh, the dark slide on the corner of Lobachevsky.
0912557|CC|Roger, America.
0912634|LMP|Those frames that Ron mentioned - this is Jack - that he mentioned were taken of a area where there's a much lighter gray albedo. Rather than the tannish gray, it's pure gray material that generally is on the rim crest of a number of craters. It may be related to the swirls that we see elsewhere.
0912705|CC|Roger, Jack.
0912756|LMP|Bob, we're abeam of Al-Biruni and coming up on Goddard and Margin is right now.
0912808|CC|Roger, America. We're tracking you on the map here, watching it.
0912814|LMP|Okay.
0912824|LMP|Al-Biruni has got a - a variation in the - its floor, variations in albedo. It almost looks like a pattern as if water were flowing on a beach. It's that irregular. Not in great areas, but in small areas around on the southern side, and the part that looks like it's a water-washing pattern is of a much lighter albedo, although I cannot see any real source for it. The texture, however, looks about the same.
0912856|CC|Roger, Jack.
0912926|CMP|And Houston, America. For your info, it took an hour - an hour (laughter) - a minute and 45 seconds for the map - your mapping camera to extend and a minute and 45 for it to retract.
0912939|CC|Roger, Ron. Copy. 1:45, extend and retract.
0912952|CDR|Bob, what's our altitude now?
0912957|CC|Looks like you're crossing - you're just about 90 miles, but we'll firm that up here, Gene. You're 90.8 - -
0913006|CDR|Okay.
0913006|CC|- - America.
0913010|CDR|Okay; thank you.
0913018|LMP|Bob, this is Jack. And the question of these irregular swirls that we've got in Mare Marginis, and we are looking just north of Nep - Neper now. I tell you, in the mare, there just is no visible relief. Although there seem to be some sinuous systematics anyway to the distribution. Like, there'll be a very dark area associated with the light area. And that dark area is darker than the mare. I think the pictures will show that. Now, in the highlands, however, the - the light albedo areas, which are very comparable, that appear to be swirllike patterns of the same type, seem to be associated with a crest of crater ridges and other high points. We're on over - right over a concentration of these now in the northern part of Marginis, where the rule of a - of the light areas being associated with a - either - either symmetrically around a much darker area than the normal mare, or on one side, and in this case, generally the south side - of a dark area is - that rule is very clear. And that also seemed to hold in the back side that there was a slightly darker region between areas of light-colored swirls.
0913242|CC|Roger, Jack. We understand, and we're standing by. We have a DOI pad and some other updates.
0913251|LMP|Okay. We'll go back to work.
0913321|CC|America, Houston. We'd like PAN CAMERA, OFF.
0913331|CDR|You're reading our minds, Bob.
0913332|LMP|It's OFF.
0913334|CC|Roger.
0913334|CDR|It's off.
0913335|CC|PAN CAMERA'S OFF, and we'd like ACCEPT. We've got the DOI target load, the CSM state vector, PIPA - and an SPS tailoff constant.
0913349|CDR|Okay; you've got ACCEPT, Bob.
0913351|CC|Roger, Gene. And there will be no PIPA bias.
0913356|CDR|Okay.
0913447|LMP|Bob, I can start with that pad if you want to.
0913450|CC|Roger. We're standing by. I'll start with D0I-1. Are you ready to copy?

0914341|CC|Good readback, Jack.
0914349|LMP|Okay. What else can we do for you?
0914352|CC|Stand by 1, here. I've got an addition for Ron on that comment about that F Crater landmark. Let me get it. It's right here, and I'll come right up to Ron on it.
0914402|CMP|Okay; I'll stand by.
0914419|CC|Ron, this additional comment will have - the crater is 8 nautical miles north of your track. You will lose the landmark at a 36-degree elevation angle. Over.
0914441|CMP|Okay. It's 8 miles north, and I'll lose it at 30 degrees. Okay; so that'll be pretty quick.
0914447|CC|Thirty-six degrees; pretty quick still.
0914506|CMP|Is that the one on Family Mountain?
0914511|CC|Stand by on that, Ron. Let me look at the book here. And I'll get Farouk to help me out on that one.
0914640|CMP|Okay, Houston. I've got F Crater, now. I'm all squared away. Thank you.
0914645|CC|Okay, Ron. It's - it's right in the middle of that landing site 4 of 4 which is right before Ignin in the book on your - on the Landmark Tracking Book. And it's right dead center on that page.
0914701|CMP|Okay, I've got it now. I wrote down 404; it's 4 of 4.
0914706|LMP|Okay, Houston. We've got a good shot of the landing site.
0914709|CC|Roger. Understand. And Roger, Ron.
0914727|LMP|The shadows, Bob, go all the way across the Scarp and very long pyramiding shadows go all the way past Family Mountain. It looks like the Sculptured Hills are lit up on this side, but it almost puts the entire North Massif in shadow, from where I stand.
0914805|CC|America, Houston.
0914806|LMP|Quite an interesting place to land down there.
0914812|CC|America, Houston.
0914821|CDR|We can now, I think, see contrast down in the shadow. And the only part of the scarp that is visible - I think Jack picked it out - as being right where Lara is.
0914841|CC|Roger. America, Houston.
0914847|LMP|Roger; go ahead.
0914849|CC|Roger. Just some words in your - You'll be going through your systems checklist here and you'll probably see that it says dump the waste water if it's greater than 85 percent and you are at about 89.6 percent. We'd - we'd like you not to dump the waste water until the nominal time in the Flight Plan. Do not dump the waste water during this systems check. Over.
0914912|CDR|Okay, and I understand that was about 94 hours as I recall.
0914917|CC|That's affirmative. That's where the nominal time is and that is where we'd like it dumped.
0914922|CDR|Okay.
0914936|CDR|Bob, that's a - a fantastic black-and-white shot of the landing area with the shadow stretching across most of it.
0914945|CC|Roger. Understand.
0915035|CDR|Bob, I can now see down in through the shadow. I can see - Bare Mountain, I can see - I can't really make out the - the slide yet. Most of the North Masstif - Massif are still in shadow due to the - due to the Sculptured Hills. And just at the point where we can start really to see through the shadows and see the - some hummocky terrain on the North Massif, it just went out of my next reach. But, I did see some sort of albedo change that went across the canyon about in the vicinity of the - of the scarp.
0915220|LMP|Bob, with respect to the landing site - this is Jack - when we had near - or were closer to low phase angle, approaching it - when I first had it in view - there was a clear lightening in the area of the light mantle. It was not sharply defined, but around the crater Lara and Nansen and to the west of the scarp - there was very clearly, slightly brighter - reflectivity.
0915300|CC|Roger, Jack.
0915451|PAO|Apollo 17's orbit is 168.8 by 52.5 nautical miles. Present altitude 154.9 nautical miles moving towards apolune.
0915627|CDR|Houston, America. The MAPPING CAMERA and LASER ALTIMETER COVERS are CLOSED. I'm going to ENABLE A-l, A-2, and C-2.
0915635|CC|Roger, Gene.
0915648|CMP|Yes, it looks like the old gravity gradient worked there or something. I didn't see it get out of attitude at all. Did you all see any movement at all?
0915700|CC|Max error was about 0.2 - 0.3 of a degree, Ron.
0915708|CMP|Okay.
0915736|LMP|I'm sorry, Houston. I should have cued you on changing the SPS pressure indicators. You want to see that again?
0915747|CC|Stand by on that.
0915832|CC|Jack, it's not required to go back and do them again. We watched it on telemetry.
0915839|LMP|Okay. I'll try to remember to be a little more informative.
0915846|CC|No problem, Jack; no problem.
0920852|CMP|Okay, Houston. There are the torquing angles.
0920856|CC|Roger. We see them. They look good.
0920904|CMP|Just for another little matter of interest - once the Earth is in the field of view, which it's about - looks like it must be about 12 degrees from Regulus - it's so bright, that it blacks out any - blanks out the telescope for any star recognition. However, it worked real good, in the sextant. You can see the star real well. You just have to assume it's Regulus, though.
0920929|CC|Roger. Would that star angle difference - -
0920931|CMP|Okay, I'll torque at 30.
0920935|CMP|I torqued at 30 - 09:30.
0920939|CC|Roger. We copy.
0920942|CMP|And the first - the first star angle difference was - you know, you can get a little bit lax about it - if you want to spend a little time at it, you can get five balls every time, looks like.
0920957|CC|Roger, Ron. With that star angle difference on the second one, I can assume it was Regulus. I think you're safe in your assumption.
0921007|CMP|Oh, yes. Right.
0921011|CDR|He had to do it, or else I'd have to go down there and do it.
0921014|CC|Roger.
0921102|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 92 hours 11 minutes. Apollo 17 now at the highest point of it's orbit, 168.8 nautical miles. 37 minutes remaining before loss of signal on this revolution.
0921406|CC|America, Houston. P40 looks good.
0921412|CMP|Okay. Mighty fine; we'll go ahead and maneuver to attitude then.
0921417|CC|Roger.
0921517|CDR|Houston, I think I put the wrong number in on the PITCH. We'll correct it. It's 228, isn't it?
0921526|CC|That's affirmative, Gene.
0921531|CDR|Okay, we'll fix that.
0921637|PAO|This is Apollo control. Apollo 17 is maneuvering to the proper attitude for Descent Orbit Insertion maneuver. This will put the crew heads down.
0921809|CC|America, Houston. We'd like the HIGH GAIN to AUTO.
0921820|CDR|You've got it.
0921822|CC|Roger.
0922148|CC|America, Houston. We'd like you to hold off switching to OMNI Charlie until we cue you on that.
0922158|CDR|Wilco.
0922243|LMP|Bob, this is Jack.
0922245|CC|Go ahead, Jack.
0922249|LMP|Was there any indication on the seismometers of an impact, about the time I thought I saw a light flash on the surface?
0922259|CC|Stand by that - we'll check on that, Jack.
0922305|LMP|Don't worry about it. Some - I thought somebody was looking at it. It could have been one of the other light flashes.
0922315|CC|Roger. We copied the time and - -
0922317|LMP|I have a place marked.
0922317|CC|- - passed it to the back room.
0922322|LMP|Okay, I got it marked on the map, too.
0923119|CDR|Okay, Bob. The star sextant checks out okay.
0923123|CC|Roger, Gene. Good show.
0923302|PAO|Flight Director, Pete Frank, now checking all flight control positions for a GO NO-GO on the Descent Orbit Insertion burn. He's getting a GO from all positions.
0923441|CC|America, Houston. You are GO for DOI and you can leave the high gain selected. We're holding good.
0923450|CDR|Okay, Robert. DOI. ... the high gain.
0923458|CC|Ro - Gene, say again. You were way down in the mud on that one. Can you say again, please?
0923507|CDR|Roger; understand. We are GO for DOI, and you have the high gain.
0923511|CC|That's affirmative, Gene. Just -
0923524|LMP|Hey, Bob, I know I've argued against this kind of thing, but you got tenths on that burn time?
0923536|CC|It's 0.1 on that.
0923543|LMP|Okay, 0.1.
0923544|CC|Jack, just some words from the back room on you. The - There may have been an impact at the time you called, but the Moon is still ringing from the S-IVB impact. So it's masked any other - would mask any other impact. So they may be able to strip it out at a later time, but right now they don't see anything at your called time.
0923605|LMP|Just my luck.
0924037|LMP|Bob, log us for a picture of the Earth at 92:40 on mag Oscar Oscar. And we're on frame 68.
0924053|CC|Roger, Jack; we've got that.
0924059|LMP|You've got a lot of healthy weather out there in the Pacific today. Looks like most of those things we talked about yesterday, up in the Hawaii region and also in the south, have intensified.
0924117|CC|Roger.
0924537|CC|America, Houston. We're about 3 minutes until LOS and everything is looking great. No changes since our GO for DOI. We'll expect to see you at 93:34:24.
0924553|CDR|We'll see you at 93:34:24, Bob.
0924557|CC|Roger, Gene.
0924903|PAO|This is Apollo control at 92 hours 49 minutes. And, we've had loss of signal as Apollo 17 goes behind the Moon. During this pass Jack Schmitt saw a flash just north of the crater Grimaldi at an elapsed time of 90 hours 18 minutes and thought it might be a meteor impact. We could not confirm that; however, the Moon was still ringing from the S-IVB impact and would mask out other activity on seismometer recorders in the science support room here. Apollo 17 will perform the Descent Orbit Insertion maneuver behind the Moon just after the start of the third revolution and at a point near perilune the low point in that revolution. Ignition time for that maneuver is 93 hours 11 minutes 36 seconds. Delta-V change of velocity of 197.4 feet per second. Duration of the burn 22 seconds and we anticipate a result orbit of 58.9 by 14.5 nautical miles. If the burn is performed as expected we'll next acquire Apollo 17 at 93 hours 34 minutes 24 seconds. If Apollo 17 is unable to perform the burn acquisition time will be 93 hours 31 minutes 37 seconds. We'll come back up just prior to the no burn acquisition time and stand by through that period of several minutes. At 92 hours 51 minutes this is mission control Houston.
0933000|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 93 hours 30 minutes. We're a minute and a half away from acquisition without a burn, 4 minutes 10 seconds away from acquisition given a nominal Descent Orbit Insertion burn. Acquisition between those two times would indicate a partial burn of some kind. We'll leave the line up now.
0933155|PAO|We've passed the no-burn AOS time and do not have a signal. That's an encouraging sign that we did perform a maneuver.
0933324|PAO|One minute to nominal AOS.
0933425|PAO|We have a signal, right on the money.
0933450|CDR|Hello, Houston; America.
0933454|CC|America, Houston. Go ahead.
0933500|CDR|Okay. And the burn was good on all counts, 22-second burn. It was on time, Vgx, 1982; roll after the burn, 357, 225, and 003. Residuals were plus 0, plus 0.2, and plus 0.1. DELTA-Vc is 0.1, and that was with DELTA-V total set into the EMS. Should have been - should been zero and the residual on the EMS was plus 0.1. OXIDIZER's 305, and FUEL is 311 and an UNBALANCE of 150 DECREASE. We're in a 59.1 by 14.9.
0933555|CC|Okay, America; sounds great.
0933601|CDR|It looks pretty great.
0933614|CDR|We're getting back down among us where us plain folks belong.
0933620|CC|Roger.
0933645|PAO|Those orbital numbers are an on-board readout, we'll confirm those m a few minutes after some tracking.
0934100|LMP|Houston, this is the LMP. There seem to be two general kinds of ray patterns: those associated with a lot of secondaries and light colored, and those that have no visible secondaries. And that's independent, yet, from the irregular light-colored areas we've been calling swirls.
0934122|CC|Roger, Jack. We're copying.
0934214|LMP|Houston, there also - a lot more - there is - there is a lot more of that light-colored swirl-like irregular material, or discoloration - if - whatever you want to call it, in the back side highlands, particularly as we approach Marginis, than I had previously gathered from the available photography.
0934248|CC|Roger, Jack.
0934254|LMP|And there still seems to be no relief associated with it. Although, in many cases, it seems to follow ridge lines, or crater rims part way. In other cases, it's quite irregular in its distribution.
0934309|CC|Okay.
0934332|CMP|And bank A, that time, with the chamber pressure, was up to 95.
0934338|CC|Roger, Ron. And we got tracking data on you; has a 13.1 perigee - peri - perilune, rather.
0934349|CDR|Roger.
0934349|CMP|Okay, that's great, Bob, and we're still looking at that zero bias on the DC meter of about 5 to 7 psi.
0934401|CC|Roger.
0934407|CMP|Okay ...
0934551|LMP|Some of the boys might be interested to know that in a place where the Sun is just grazing the slope - it's a steep slope on the north rim of Crisium, I can see the horizontal lineaments that were such a controversy on 15.
0934608|CC|Roger. Understand. The north rim of Crisium?
0934609|CDR|... big one with the central peak.
0934613|LMP|Roger. There are some very steep slopes that just have grazing Sun on them now, and with the binocs, you can see that horizontal lineation pattern.
0934625|CC|Roger.
0934636|CMP|There it is. T-horizon will be good. Yes. Okay, I've got the edge of Crisium now. ... Getting hills on the side of Crisium, there. Sure a lot smoother-looking material than I thought it would be.
0934703|CC|Ron, you're about 1 minute from T-horizon.
0934709|CMP|Okay, Bob. Thank you. Oh. (Laughter) Here.
0934726|CC|And, Ron, we - we're copying you on VOX, we believe. is that affirm?
0934732|CMP|Yes, that's right.
0934733|CC|Roger.
0934734|CMP|You're not supposed to copy the other guys, though. Are you copying the other guys?
0934737|CC|No, just you, Ron.
0934740|CMP|Okay.
0934743|CDR|I may have been talking loud.
0934802|CC|Okay, Ron. You should be at T-horizon.
0934806|LMP|MARK. T-horizon.
0934809|CMP|Okay, that's pointing at the horizon all right. I don't see the crater, yet.
0934819|CMP|Okay.
0934838|CMP|Okay, I can see the rims of Microbus [sic] A and B.
0934859|CMP|Okay.
0934925|CMP|Okay, I really don't see it yet. I can see Microbus A and B, real well.
0935002|CMP|Okay, I'm going to pick out one and start marking on it.
0935008|CMP|1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. That's the wrong one. Okay, now I see what I'm supposed to mark on; okay.
0935022|CMP|1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ... 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and it's gone.
0935109|CMP|Okay?
0935122|CMP|No, the ones I just wrote in there. Right?
0935144|CMP|Okay? And, lets - now I'm going to take a look and see if it looks like a cinder cone. Hey! There's Maraldi Gamma, the mound sticking up there right beside Maraldi. Hey, you guys are going to have some good hills to run down in there. Can you see it all - at all, coming up?
0935228|CMP|... north. That crazy radar is going to be in the way - the LM (laughter). Okay, it's going through the landing site, now. The shadow is just up to - You can really see the scarp on there.
0935259|LMP|See what they mean by Sculptured Hills, Gene? See the knobby characteristics in that - -
0935302|CDR|Yes. That'll be ...
0935303|LMP|- - area down there. That's part of the Sculpured Hills.
0935304|CDR|That's a massif there, too.
0935312|LMP|Now, we're just over the rim of Serenitatis, looking over the Graben Plains - -
0935319|CMP|Yes, I can just see. I'm going to switch to 17-1. 3, 4, 5, 6 - just got six of them on 17-1 and then the other three were were on F - F Crater; 17-1 was just barely in the - Sherlock was just barely beyond the shadow.
0935346|LMP|This is all supposedly covered with the dark mantle, Gene, what you're seeing down there.
0935350|CDR|Yes, the Sun angles are so that you can't tell the difference in albedo.
0935353|LMP|And look at those mare ridges, though.
0935357|CDR|I tell you, that's looking out into the gray -gray desert down in there.
0935359|LMP|That's the old Littrow site.
0935408|CDR|I think so. I think we're just about ready to climb.
0935411|LMP|I think the terminator is giving you the feeling of that, maybe. Ain't nothing out there.
0935417|CC|Jack, Houston. Can you see any albedo difference in the landing site area between the dark massif and the light area?
0935428|LMP|We can't see any difference between - in the low areas, between the dark mantle and other materials right now. We're right at the terminator.
0935439|CDR|Yes, but Jack and I weren't really looking at the landing site. I think Ron was.
0935443|CC|Roger.
0935453|CMP|Gerry, you could really see a difference between the - the South Massif and the - the mantle material around through there. The mantle is not nearly as dark as it looks on the pictures, though. But the massif, South Massif especially, looked almost a whitish color. I guess it's because the, partly the Sun was shining on it. But then - -
0935519|CDR|Could you see anything that looks like the slide?
0935520|CMP|Oh, yes. You can see the slide on the thing and definitely see the scarp going across through there. I was primarily concentrating on looking for the various craters so I didn't spend that much time, you know, concentrating on how the thing looked. But in the marks on the thing, the first about four or five marks were on F Crater and then I saw Sherlock about halfway through it and I got about five marks on the Sherlock for 17-1.
0935600|LMP|... Gene.
0935623|LMP|Houston, in crossing Crisium and Marginis, it looked fairly clear that with the small fresh craters, and I don't have a good size estimate right now - I think I'm looking in terms of 100 or 2 meters. You can distinguish where blocks have been thrown up by them, or not - possibly giving depth of the local regolith from the pictures you'll get in there.
0935705|CC|Roger, Jack.
0935712|LMP|And, also, on that lineation question, not only, where the Sun grazes a - a slope do you see the horizontal lineations, but they're at the southern end of the shadowed area on a slope. You get a couple other lineations showing up at least in a couple places I saw. One would be parallel to the slope - that is cross-contour, and the other was at a - an angle to that direction - oh - say of about 30 degrees.
0935802|CC|Roger, Jack. We're copying you loud and clear and no problems with comm at all.
0935810|LMP|Okay. We just had sunset.
0935815|CMP|And, Houston; America. On mag Bravo Bravo, 75 to 70 percent were utilized on J-3 and F Crater and 17-1 through the sextant.
0935833|CC|Roger. Just want to confirm, Ron. You started on J-3 and then you went to F Crater and -
0935843|CMP|Yes. I went to F Crater and then back to Sherlock or 17-1.
0935848|CC|Roger.
0935851|CMP|Actually, on J-3, I took four marks on a crater that was to the west of J-3 and then I finally saw J-3 and started marking on it.
0935901|CC|Roger, Ron.
0935906|LMP|Okay, Houston. Mag Oscar Oscar is 85.
0935913|CC|Roger, Jack. Thank you.
0935915|LMP|And, then - okay; and there's a number of pictures - Now, just a minute, let me try to give you a general feeling for where they were taken. Stand by 1.
0935951|LMP|Okay; a number of the last pictures that were taken on that series, or that rev, were taken between - say about 115 east, and - oh, about 100 east and they show several examples of the light-colored or swirl - -
0940027|CMP|Coming up now.
0940028|LMP|- - alterations to the surface. And that's in highland country where that is a distinct gray against the tan-gray or tan highland background - general highland color.
0940045|CC|Okay, Jack. I got that.
0940103|CMP|And, all my pictures, Jesus (laughter).
0940113|CC|Ron, Houston. We'd like you to move up and do the waste water dump starting now and the O2 fuel cell purge.
0940124|LMP|Okay, we'll get to that and mag Quebec Quebec is on frame 50.
0940131|CC|Roger. Copy.
0940134|CMP|Okay, you want to dump the waste water on the front side?
0940139|CC|That's affirm, Ron. We'd like to get a third dump now, so we have it dumped prior to the camera pass.
0940148|CMP|Oh, okay.
0940148|CC|We want to get a dump prior to the UV work there, Ron.
0940156|CMP|Okay, that's right - I'm sorry, I forgot about that.
0940202|CMP|... how ... going to go, with BATTERY VENT to - Okay, BATTERY VENTED, BATTERY VENT is CLOSED and going to DUMP A.
0940330|LMP|PAN CAMERA POWER going OFF.
0940422|LMP|Okay, Houston. Beginning the fuel cell purge - O2
0940428|CC|Roger, Jack.
0940514|CDR|Bob , any objections to making that VERB 49 maneuver, now?
0940532|CC|Stand by on that, Gene.
0940536|CDR|Okay.
0940554|CC|America, no objection to going to VERB 49 maneuver any time. Just do not open the UV door until the 94:45 Flight Plan time.
0940606|CDR|Okay. We're with you.
0940850|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 94 hours 8 minutes. Apollo 17 now is maneuvering to the attitude from which the ultraviolet spectrometer and the infrared scanning radiometer experiments will be performed. The start of those experiments on this pass will be after LOS, behind the Moon.
0940923|CDR|Hey, Gordo. I think we're still in LM PRESSURE up there in the tunnel. You want us to go back to LM/CM DELTA-P?
0940936|CC|Okay, Gordo's off. I'll have to wait a minute here, Gene.
0940949|CDR|For a Sunday night, you're - you're hard to get along with.
0940956|CC|Oh, come on.
0940958|LMP|Wise Marines - wise Marines end up in Antarctica.
0941006|CC|Roger. Can't do that. They don't have any gates down there.
0941015|CDR|That sounds like a job you could probably handle.
0941019|LMP|Listen, after that answer, I'll build one down there for you.
0941022|CC|Thank you, sir. Hey, you can go to LM/CM DELTA-P.
0941028|CDR|Okay, thank you. (Laughter)
0941228|CC|America, Houston. The fuel cell 3 purge can be terminated.
0941234|LMP|I beat you.
0941248|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 94 hours 15 minutes. Apollo 17 is just south of the Oceans of Storm, Ocean of Storms now. Shortly, we'll be coming up on the crater Grimaldi again. That's where Jack Schmitt saw a flash on the last pass. We're showing an orbit of 58.9 by 14.3 nautical miles at the present altitude of 28.1 nautical miles.
0941734|CDR|Hey, Bob. Who you talking to us with, Honeysuckle or Goldstone? Honeysuckle, I'd guess.
0941750|CC|We're talking through Goldst - Goldstone, Gene.
0941759|CDR|Okay, looks like about a tossup from here. I'll tell you, there is really one heck of a big low-pressure area developing somewhere off the coast of California, Washington, or Canada, out in the Pacific Northwest part of the country.
0941817|CC|Roger. We copy.
0941826|CDR|We were watching it earlier today, but I tell you, now, it's really dragged in some other clouds with it. It must cover an enormous distance and it's got some real spectacular circulation.
0941839|CC|Just for curiosity, are you using a monocular on that?
0941849|CDR|No, I'm using a binocular.
0941852|CC|Roger.
0941933|CDR|Bob, it's - it's got a trailing front. I can't really see the States, or even the North American continent, because - -
0941940|CC|Stand by, Jack - or Gene. We'd like for you to terminate - -
0941943|CDR|- - pretty well covered - -
0941944|CC|- - waste water dump.
0941947|CDR|Okay.
0941949|CC|Sorry about that. Go ahead.
0941954|CDR|Okay, I was just going to say, it's got a - looks like a tremendous trailing front. Roughly, north-northwest, south-southeast, and it looks like it may just sweep up the western coast. It's hard to tell how far off the actual center rotation or even a front is. I just remember from earlier this morning, when I could see landmasses, that it appeared to me to be off the Pacific Northwest out in the ocean.
0942025|CC|Roger.
0942221|CC|Jack, Houston here. We've just been kicking around with Farouk, and if you get - if you want to, during your - any of your free time, if you have any, you might look at Copernicus with your binoculars and see if the dike goes all the way - all the way across. He would recommend using the binoculars. Don't take any of your eat or sleep time at all, but you might get a chance on this one eat pass to, as you go by there.
0942254|LMP|Okay. I'll give her a try. You might give me a couple minutes' warning the next time around.
0942306|CC|Okay, Jack.
0942310|LMP|I'm not sure the attitude is too good for that. I wish I'd thought of it this round.
0942315|CC|Roger. Well, we were pretty busy coming up on it this time. I think the - that's why we mentioned the attitude may be okay during the eat period. We don't want you to break away from your eat period unless you see you can spare the time.
0942404|LMP|Just looking at the southern edge of Grimaldi, Bob, and we probably have it covered on photos, but there's a nice tangential to slightly circumferential graben along the southern wall and climbs out over the western rim and off the eastern rim, and that graben is premare - premare.
0942440|CC|Okay, I copy on that, Jack, and as long as we're talking about Grimaldi, you might just rem - we'd like to have you brief Ron exactly on the location of that flash you saw. We'll probably ask him to take a picture of it, maybe during one of his solo periods.
0942511|CDR|Hey, Bob, before we get awfully involved, just let me tell you what our motive is here in the next couple of hours. That's to eat and get done what's in the Flight Plan, and come our rest period, we're probably going to turn out the lights and make sure everything's done by then so we can start it on-time tonight.
0942532|CC|Yes, that's a definite - we concur with that definitely, Gene. Don't want you to work into your sleep period.
0942544|CDR|Okay.
0942719|CC|Gene, Houston.
0942725|CDR|Go ahead.
0942727|CC|Gene, last night you didn't use a tone booster, and the work you gave us was that it had - it wasn't working, and we're just wondering if you want - we're thinking about working up a test board to see if - did you test it out thoroughly to make sure it wasn't working, or was that just your desire not to use it?
0942746|CDR|We tried it, Bob, and it did not work. The only reason I'm reluctant on a test is I just don't want it to take much time.
0942757|CC|I don't think it would take much time. The only thing I could say is it would - you know - two obvious things I'm sure you checked them, Gene, would be the utility power and make sure you had the right lamp tests on when you tried it, and that's the only - I'm sure you did it, and that's the only obvious thing - maybe a circuit breaker or something like that.
0942819|CDR|Well, we checked it both on the left side and on the right side with two separate UTILITY POWERS and verified that the MASTER ALARMs came on with the test on both sides, and nothing ever happened.
0942833|CC|Roger. I was sure of that, Gene. Just wanted to make it - put everybody at ease that it's just not working. That was essentially the test. Just forget anything we said about tests.
0942851|CDR|Okay.
0942855|LMP|What test?
0942857|CC|Roger. Got you guys trained up there, finally.
0942907|LMP|Arf, arf.
0942913|CMP|Houston, America.
0942914|CC|Roger. Go ahead, Ron.
0942919|CMP|If I don't find my scissors here one of these days, I think it takes about four bolts on either side of the - you know the optics, where they stow the optics? it looks like there are four little tool E bolts that'll come out. And I think maybe they might be back behind there, I don't know. See, there's a great big slot up at the top of that - oh, it's at least an inch - inch between the top of the optics thing and the top of the spacecraft. I looked back in there with a flashlight and can't see anything, but it's a big hole back there anyhow.
0943007|LMP|I think the commander might have something to say.
0943012|CDR|Hey, Bob, just ignore everything he said. We'll leave him a pair of our scissors, and he's just worried about being hungry.
0943021|CC|Roger. Those are your EVA scissors, too, aren't they?
0943024|CDR|But, he is not - Yes, but we can handle - we can handle it with one down there. He is not taking the spacecraft apart to find his scissors, and I will not let him go hungry.
0943035|CC|Roger.
0943039|CMP|Okay, either way.
0943546|LMP|Hey, Bob, before we lose you, how did the Oilers do today? (Laughter)
0943557|CC|9 to 3. Steelers over the Oilers.
0943602|LMP|9 to 3?
0943604|CC|That's affirm.
0943609|LMP|9? 09 to 03?
0943612|CC|That's affirmative. Played one of their better games, I guess.
0943621|LMP|How about the Chicago Bears? You got their score handy?
0943625|CC|Hey, Jack, how about if we pick you up during the eat period. While you're eating, we'll brief you of the whole NFL situation for today. Okay?
0943636|LMP|Well, we are eating. I guess we wait until we come around next time. Okay.
0943639|CC|Oh - I - well, the Bears were ... losing but - -
0943648|LMP|Bob, we'll wait and you can get up the late evening news prepared for us here the next time around.
0943655|CC|Okay. Have your gourmet dinner and I'll give you the news.
0943700|LMP|Okay.
0943813|CC|America, Houston. We're going to lose you here in about 2-1/2 minutes. We'll see you at 95:28, according to the Flight Plan, and you're looking good. We don't have anything, any anomalies or anything against you right now. You're looking great.
0943833|CDR|Thank you, Robert. We'll see you coming around the horn.
0943836|CC|Roger.
0943846|CDR|Hey, Bob, if you could, it might be appreciated with a word or two from our home fronts.
0943854|CC|Yes. You didn't let me do it. I was going to give them all a call while on this LOS here, Gene.
0943902|CDR|It's that thing again. I bet you were concentrating on the dot.
0944015|CC|Hey, guys. The Bears 21 to 12 over Philadelphia.
0944023|CDR|Thank you. We're going to watch your signal get cut off here.
0944028|CC|Roger. Was touch and go on that because at one time they're losing that game.
0944031|CDR|I ...
0944108|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 94 hours 41 minutes. We've had lost signal on the 3rd revolution. Ron Evans performed some landmark tracking on the front side of the Moon during this pass and we got some earth weather reports from lunar orbit, believed to be a first, in the Apollo series. And spacecraft is in the attitude now to perform the ultra-violet spectrometer and the infrared scanning radiometer experiments. We - we expect to acquire Apollo 17 next at 95 hours 28 minutes. Will come back up then, at 94 hours 42 minutes this is Mission Control, Houston.
0952707|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 95 hours 27 minutes. We should be acquiring Apollo 17 on it's fourth revolution of the Moon in about 45 seconds. We'll stand by for the first words.
0952825|PAO|We have a signal and are receiving data.
0952859|LMP|Hello Houston, America.
0952903|CC|Hello America. Reading you loud and clear.
0952909|LMP|Bob, the flight plan is complete to 95:30.
0952913|CC|Roger.
0952922|LMP|And Bob, the IR cover came open about 1 minute late.
0952927|CC|Okay, Understand. Might be interested, the lasted tracking data has you at about 14.1 perilune. It's coming up closer to your CMC data. And, America, we'd like to have the H2 tank, H2 tank 1, fans off. We'll be letting that pressure decay on that. We'll be bringing them back on prior to sleep period.
0953004|LMP|Okay, that's OFF.
0953008|CC|I've got a number of pads and flight plan update any time you're ready for them, if you want or you can hold off it awhile.
0953028|LMP|Why don't you start with flight plan updates Bob?
0953029|CC|Okay, At 97:30, 97:30.
0953041|LMP|Okay.
0953042|CC|You should have a pen and ink change there that says UV cover CLOSE. After that add UV OFF.
0953103|LMP|Okay, got it.
0953104|CC|Okay, now, just a note, or you can jump way ahead to 106:51, where it says delete, see where it says UV off, just delete that, or else make a verified, because it will be off during that whole period.
0953122|LMP|106. Yes, I'll just put a verified by that. 106:51.
0953127|CC|Roger. The next thing I've got are the pads. The TEI 12 and TEI 19 pad.
0953142|LMP|Okay. Go ahead.
0953144|CC|The first one is TEI 12, SPS G&N 38570, plus 0.49 plus 0.92, NOUN 33 times 111:54:42.86 plus 2543.8 minus 1765.6 minus 7950. Roll is 186, 109, 328. The rest of the pad is not applicable. BREAK - BREAK Jack, we'd like an ACCEPT on the computer please.
0953251|LMP|You got it.
0953253|CC|Okay. The set stars are as always, Sirius and Rigel, 133, 200, 030. Four Jet, 12 second on the ullage. Three notes: Burn undocked, assumes no CIRC, longitude of the Moon at TIG will be minus 140.19 degrees. Over.
0953356|LMP|Bob, give me note two again please.
0953400|CC|Okay, Jack, the three comments are: assumes burn undocked, assumes no CIRC burn, and the Moon at TIG, the longitude will be minus 140.19 degrees. Over.
0953426|LMP|Okay, I got everything, but number 2. All right, here's your readback. TEI-12, twelve that is, SPS/G&N 38570 plus 0.49 plus 0.92 111:54:42.86 plus 2543.8 minus 1765.6 minus 0795.0. 186, 109, 328. Rest of the pad is NA. Sirius and Rigel 133, 200, 030. Ullage is 4 Jets for 12 seconds. Remarks: (1) burn undocked, (2) assume no CIRC, (3) longitude, lunar longitude at TIG minus 140.19 degrees, .19 degrees.
0953522|CC|Roger. Good readback, Jack, and I've got the TEI-19 pad, if you're ready.
0953543|LMP|Okay, go ahead.
0953544|CC|TEI-19, SPS/G&N 38023 plus 0.49, plus 0.86; the TIG time, 125:46:47.22; plus 2456.3, minus 1925.3, minus 0731.3; 186, 108, 325. Rest of the pad is not applicable. All the notes are the same as on the TEI-12 pad, except the longitude is minus 147.62. Over.
0953706|LMP|Stand by 1.
0953750|LMP|Okay. Here's your readback. TEI-19, SPS/G&N; 38023; Plus 0.49, plus 0.86; 125:46:47.22; plus 2456.3, minus 1925.3; minus 0731.3; 186, 108, 325. Rest of pad is NA. And the remarks are the same as for the TEI-12; that includes set stars. And the only change is the 3, which is the lunar longitude at TIG of a minus 147.62. Over.
0953840|CC|That's a good readback Jack. I've got a LM DAP read-up here for you. They recommend this be copied on page 1 of the LM Data Card Book, Jack.
0953900|LMP|Well, strangely enough, the LM Data Card Book's in the LM.
0953904|CC|Yes, I figured as much.
0953904|LMP|We'll put it in our Activation Book. Let me find the right page.
0953908|CC|Okay.
0953908|LMP|Let me find the right page.
0953910|CC|Roger.
0953915|CC|And, Jack, the computer's yours.
0953921|LMP|Okay.
0954027|LMP|Go ahead, Bob.
0954029|CC|Okay. LM DAP information: LM weight, 36714; CSM weight, 38078.
0954055|LMP|Okay, the DAP load is LM weight 36714, CSM weight 38078.
0954102|CC|Roger, Jack, and I'd like to correct one call on my, the TEI pads. There is one other difference between the TEI-19 and the TEI-12 under notes. And the TEI-19 assumes the circ burn, over.
0954136|LMP|Okay, that's corrected to assume circ on the TEI-19.
0954141|CC|Roger, Jack. I'm sorry on that. I've got some notes from the flight - -
0954145|LMP|That's alright, Bob.
0954150|CC|Got some notes for Gene from the Flight Surgeon. He promised an update to you on some meal recommendations here on food. You might want to copy this into a supplement.
0954209|LMP|Okay. Just standby one, please.
0954212|CC|Roger.
0954325|LMP|Bob, let us take a look at the landing area and will be right back with you.
0954330|CC|Okay. Just whenever you want it, there's no hurry on this at all. Jack, you just might put a little note there somewhere for yourself that Copernicus is at 96.03 if you want to look at it.
0954344|LMP|Okay. 96.03.
0954545|PAO|Apollo 17 is coming up over the Taurus Littrow landing site now.
0954627|LMP|Now we're getting some clear - look like pretty clear high-water marks on the - -
0954631|CMP|There's high-water marks all over the place there.
0954633|LMP|- - on the north part of Tranquillitatis in here - mare onto the highlands.
0954641|CC|Roger.
0954711|CMP|Yes, there's high-water marks all over that - that - I think that's Maraldi there, isn't it? Are you sure we're at 13 miles up?
0954728|CC|You're at 14.1, to be exact, Ron.
0954734|CMP|(Laughter) Looks pretty low.
0954738|CDR|Gee, I wonder what it feels like to be at 8 to 10.
0954745|CC|You're going to find out, I think.
0954817|LMP|I tell you there's some mare ridge or scarps, very sinuous - just passing one. They not only cross the low planar areas but go right up the side of a crater in one place and a hill in another. And it's not at all like a fault scarp. It looks very much like a constructional ridge. And it has the sinuousity of a, pardon the expression, rattle snake.
0954842|CC|Roger. Does it look like that one we saw on the track the other day?
0954849|LMP|Yes, very much like that one that you almost caught. Look at that. There's a tongute - there's a tongue depressor - several of them - grabens in here. We must be out on the edge of Serenitatis now, right?
0954908|CC|Yes, we show you on the edge of Serenitatis, Jack.
0954915|LMP|Roger. I just - we didn't get a view of the site, though, going over this time. I think it was off to the north of us just a tad. That's the best example of a mare - mare-like ridge that was as clearly constructional as I would want to see it. Out on the mare, it's never quite that obvious. But there, it climbed up over a hill and then back down again.
0954943|CC|Roger.
0954950|LMP|And that was just east of the - an area just east of the edge of Serenitatis and probably a little bit south of the landing site.
0955005|CDR|Say, Bob, rather than copy specific recommended changes or deletions to a diet, can you have a general comment that's any different than what I already understand?
0955018|CC|Right. It's no problem.
0955019|CDR|If not, I would rather delay it.
0955020|CC|No, it's no problem, Gene. Two quick comments: the next couple of days, delete the peach ambrosia and the mixed fruit bar, and don't delete anything from the LM menu. And make sure you get all the water in for rehydration, and take - bias it if you think you get 30 percent gas, then put in 30 percent more so you get all the water that is required. And take two anti-gas tablets after each meal instead of one. That sums it up.
0955053|CDR|Okay - Okay. Very good. I'll - I'll handle all those words according to their needs.
0955100|CC|Roger.
0955102|CDR|Appreciate them, though.
0955115|CMP|Houston, America.
0955119|CC|Go ahead.
0955119|CMP|We're shooting magazine QQ, frame 50 - frame 50, 51, and 52. We're taking - looking south at the terminator.
0955136|CC|Ron, we need to get looking at the pan camera here, per the Flight Plan.
0955145|CMP|Thank you.
0955214|LMP|Okay, Bob. POWER on the PAN CAMERA now.
0955223|LMP|MARK it.
0955233|CC|Roger. We got it.
0955237|LMP|Okay. And has my biomed been looking all right?
0955243|CC|That's affirmative.
0955252|LMP|Okay.
0955342|CC|America, you can turn the PAN CAMERA, OFF.
0955349|LMP|Okay. PAN CAMERA going OFF.
0955352|LMP|MARK.
0955521|CDR|... the up-link.
0960029|LMP|Okay, Bob. Let's see. Will Copernicus - will be north of our track. is that correct?
0960039|CC|I believe so, from my charts here, but let me doublecheck that. That is affirmative. Tommy just gave me the up on that one.
0960122|CC|If you guys got time to listen, I can update you on the homefront while you're wor - looking out the windows.
0960134|CDR|Go ahead, Bob.
0960136|CC|Let's see. For the CDR, they're eating beans and combread over at Nassau Bay tonight. Probably a good thing they're eating beans there, Gene, because you're feeding 25 tonight. And the horse is getting fed, also.
0960155|CDR|Beans and combread? it's a good thing I'm eating up here.
0960200|CC|You better believe it. And, of course, everybody sends their love. And over in El Lago, they're -
0960210|CDR|Well - -
0960211|CC|Go ahead, Gene.
0960216|CDR|I was Just going to ask you to return mine for me, would you?
0960220|CC|Oh, you better believe it. They're listening to the squawk box. You don't have to say anything to me. And over in El Lago, Jamie's saying - is saying her prayers ending them with, "God bless America and Challenger from now on." And John is saying, "There's Daddy's rocket - makes it go pitch, light out." And of course, everybody sends their love - -
0960242|CMP|They're great.
0960246|CC|And they're all listening right now if you'd - -
0960248|CMP|Tell John, though, that I shaved the other night.
0960251|CC|Roger. He'll be listening, hearing that. They're all over at the - in Nassau Bay at a big meeting of the Flight Plan. The Parkers are briefing the Cernans and the Evans on the Flight Plan tonight. And out in Tucson, for the LMP, it's kind of cloudy and cold out there today. It's colder than normal. Everything's working fine on the speaker out there, Jack, and they're just listening, and Mother - your Mother is really tickled and just pleased as all get out.
0960323|LMP|That sounds like Mother. And I just got a real good view of Copernicus, but I'm afraid I can't help you out on that structure in the central peak. Just a little too dark.
0960336|CC|Okay.
0960340|LMP|But it's a fantastic sight at this altitude. It is a big crater. It looks like it's about 80 kilometers in diameter.
0960354|CC|I'll drink to that.
0960359|LMP|And put down a verify on those dark deposits in the wall. And also on the southeast wall, there's one right on the rim. I think we mapped that one, too, but I'll have to go back and check.
0960420|CC|Okay.
0960422|LMP|That one looked like it had a crater in it. However, they all tend to be elongate radially, with respect to the crater. But that's about all I can add now.
0960446|CC|Okay.
0960458|LMP|Bob, I'm glad, the squawk box is fixed. And, of course, send my love and best wishes out there to Tucson.
0960508|CC|That's a Roger, Jack. You guys might also be interested, here in the Houston area, all of the ground voice or air-to-ground is being carried on FM stations a hundred percent of it. And KUHT, the television station, will cover the - educational TV station - is going to cover 100 percent of the EVAs, all three of them, for all the time.
0960541|CDR|That sounds great. We hope we can provide them with as much education as we can entertainment.
0960549|CC|We're counting on it.
0960555|CDR|I guess Parker's all we had left down there to brief them on the landing site, huh?
0960607|CC|vl won't even comment on that one.
0960612|CDR|(Chuckle) Okay. I figure he will later.
0960627|CDR|I'd like, also, to send my best up north to the Bellwood - the Bellwood area up there, because I think there's a squawk box up there, too.
0960639|CC|Beautiful.
0960645|CDR|And, Bob, it's - all in all, it's been a pretty exciting day. I think a pretty accomplishing day, and certainly a rewarding day on our part. It's also been a long day, but we're hoping that it can only be superseded by tomorrow. And judging from what we've got in store, it might very well be.
0960707|CC|I think that sums up the day. It's a day of anticipation for what's going to happen tomorrow. Everything's gone off real well here, and we're just glad you're in the orbit you're in and ready for tomorrow.
0960721|LMP|My goodness, Bob. This is Jack. It's awful hard to spend much time up here anticipating. The events come so fast and certainly are exciting and rewarding, each one, one at a time. But obviously, tomorrow is going to be the biggy.
0960739|CC|Roger.
0960750|CC|Ron, we're watching your 52; and just be advised you do not have to do the option 1.
0960759|CMP|Okay. Real fine, Bob.
0960926|LMP|Bob, I'm not sure whether it's entirely proper, being a bachelor, but I'd like to send my regards to everybody - all the families listening to squawk boxes tonight.
0960942|CC|Roger.
0960955|LMP|Bob, we're going right over the Procellarum Ridge now, if I'm not mistaken, out in the middle of Mare Procellarum. And we're low enough now that you can see some of the terrain.
0961009|CC|Okay.
0961012|LMP|That is - that is, some of the hills and rilles and valleys associated with that ridge system.
0961024|CC|Roger. BREAK - Ron, we've got the 52, and it looks good. You can torque.
0961031|CMP|Okay. I'll torque it 10, 3, 0.
0961108|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Gene Cernan's remark about up north in Bellwood is a reference to his mother, Mrs. Andrew Cernan, who is following the course of the mission at her home in Bellwood, Illinois.
0961204|CMP|Houston, America. You want an E-memory dump?
0961208|CC|Roger. We're standing by. We're ready for it.
0961214|CMP|Okay. VERB 74 - sync
0961303|CMP|The GDC is aligned, and we verified that the LM valve is in LM/CM DELTA-P.
0961313|CC|Roger. We got you.
0961326|CC|The E-MOD is finished, Ron.
0961332|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
0961421|CC|Ron, we're ready to up-link the jet monitor program and one of the burn constants.
0961430|CMP|Okay. You have CMC and ACCEPT.
0961433|CC|Okay.
0961434|CMP|P20 and ACCEPT.
0961628|CC|While you're eating or getting ready to eat, I can update some of the news for you tonight, if you're away from the windows. Or are you all still looking out?
0961638|CDR|No. Go ahead, Bob.
0961639|CC|Okay. There's not a whole lot of news on the wire tonight, matter of fact. President Nixon received a firsthand report on private Vietnam peace negotiations today from a key member of the U.S. negotiating team, General Alexander Haig, Jr., Henry Kissinger's Chief Lieutenant. Haig flew back from Paris to report to the President, while technical experts from both sides held an unusual Sunday meeting in the French capitol. Presidential Assistant Kissinger will resume his talks with North Vietnam's Le Duc Tho on Monday after a 1-day recess. And former President Harry Truman continued to show some signs of improvement late today after he was earlier removed from the critical list at Research Hospital up - up in Kansas City. His cardiac situation has improved, and this improvement included a slower and stronger pulse and a stable blood pressure. The football scores are as follows in the National Football League today: The Bears defeated the Eagles 21 to 12; the Detroit Lions and the Buffalo Bills played to a 21-21 standoff; Dolphins extended their undefeated streak 23 to 13 over the New York Giants; the Patriots defeated the New Orleans Saints 17 to 10; Green Bay sewed up the Central Division of the NFC by defeating the Vikings 23 to 7; the Cardinals upset the Rams today 24 to 14; Denver defeated San Diego 38-13; Kansas City upset Baltimore 24 to 10; the 49ers defeated the Falcons 20 to nothing, 20 to 0; and Pittsburg defeated Houston 9 to 3, and they - they took the Central Division of the AFC. So the playoff picture is becoming a little clearer. You've got - in the NFC, you've got Washington, Dallas, and Green Bay. And the fourth team will either be San Francisco, Los Angeles, or Atlanta. That will be decided next week. In the AFC, Pittsburg, Miami, and Oakland are in it. And the fourth team will be either the Jets - and another team. They've got the Giants listed here, but it can't be the Giants because that's the wrong division. So we'll - we'll check that one out. Cleveland; okay, Cleveland. The fourth team is either going to be Cleveland or the Jets.
0961949|CC|And did you get a spurious MASTER CAUTION and WARNING?
0961956|CDR|No. Ron was retesting our bleeper again.
0962001|CC|Okay.
0962002|CDR|And it's one of those that works in lunar orbit, I guess. It doesn't work during coast because it's working now.
0962010|CC|Good show.
0962016|CDR|Sounds like there's going to be some good football games coming up.
0962019|CC|Yes, indeed. You really can't call - -
0962024|CDR|Who is playing tomorrow night?
0962030|CC|Stand by.
0962052|CC|That's the Oakland - Oakland and the Jets.
0962059|CDR|Okay.
0962216|CC|Ron, the up-link is complete. The EMP is running, and the computer is yours.
0962225|CMP|Okay, Bob. We got it back.
0962410|CC|Ron, we'd like the H2 TANK FANs on and that will be the sleep configure. H2 TANK 1 fans ON, and leave 3 in AUTO.
0962423|CDR|You want H2 TANK 1 - You want 1 and 2 ON?
0962430|CC|Negative. TANK 1 ON.
0962436|CDR|Okay, that leaves us with TANK 1, ON; TANK 2, OFF; and TANK 3 in AUTO. is that what you want?
0962445|CC|Roger. If you're calling fans; that's what we want.
0962453|CDR|Yes, H2 FANs, Bob; I'll say it again. H2 FANs: 1 is ON, 2 is OFF, and 3 is AUTO.
0962501|CC|That's a good configuration, and that will be the sleep configuration.
0962506|CDR|Okay.
0962527|CDR|Hey, Bob, it looks like we might make - getting to sleep on-time tonight, and - well, we will make it. And I think it goes without saying, we definitely want to get up on time tomorrow.
0962542|CC|Roger.
0962555|CMP|I'm going to have the tone booster plugged in, and also I want to make sure the suit power and audio power and all that stuff is on.
0962603|CC|Roger.
0962932|CC|Ron, Houston.
0962937|LMP|Go ahead, Bob.
0962939|CC|If Ron's listening, just some words about the mapping camera extend/retract times. We came up with slightly different times than what he'd called and we were wondering if his were just ballpark or whether he had timed it? in either case, the times are a little bit long on extend/retract which is a little cause for worry about that - the mapping camera may fail and later on downstream we may want to change our operating mode on that mapping camera and he might want to time it a little closer. If he - if he can - the chance should come up.
0963015|LMP|What - what times - -
0963015|CMP|Hey, Bob, that's a good point on the thing. Those weren't exact times and, as matter of fact, we looked - kind of looked away and it was about in -y ou know, somewhere around that - that period of time. We looked away and when - when we looked back, it was gray again, so - next - -
0963031|CC|Okay - -
0963031|CMP|- - next time we extend them, I'll get a good accurate indication.
0963036|CC|Okay. Well, no problem.
0963038|CMP|... - -
0963038|CC|We'll believe the strip chart. We'll take the strip chart data. We've got 01:24, 1 minute 24 seconds for extend and 01:51, 1 minute 51 seconds for retract. And both those sire a little bit on the high side.
0963102|CMP|Okay. I would believe the strip chart.
0963106|CC|Roger, Ron. You all are about 4 minutes from LOS.
0963120|CC|Okay, we might lose you a little bit earlier than that. INCO.
0963141|CC|Okay, we may lose you a little early due to the SIM bay attitude and we'll pick you up at 97:22.
0963153|LMP|Okay, Bob. Once more around at 97:22.
0963153||BEGIN LUNAR REV 5
0963422|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 96 hours 34 minutes. Apollo 17 has turned the corner a little early, about 50 seconds early. We've lost contact with the antenna because of it's attitude, about 50 seconds early. During this 4th pass on the front side of the Moon there was considerable description of the Lunar surface and photography was accomplished. The mapping camera experts will continue to study the extension and retraction times of the camera. If those times continue to grow, they will probably revise the Flight Plan somewhat to reduce the number of times that camera must be extended and retracted. At the present time though they are just keeping a close eye on those times to see whether they will continue to grow. We'll next acquire Apollo 17 on it's 5th revolution of the Moon at 97 hours 22 minutes.
0972125|PAO|This is Apollo control at 97 hours 21 minutes. We're 50 seconds away from the time Apollo 17 should be within communications range on it's fifth revolution of the Moon. We'll stand by for the first contact.
0972245|PAO|We have a signal now.
0972333|LMP|Houston, 17.
0972335|CC|17, Houston. Go ahead.
0972340|LMP|Roger. We're just about ready to finish up here. I have a couple of questions. Do you want us to cycle the cryo fans or just leave them alone now?
0972354|CC|We'd like them just left alone, left in your configuration you are now, Jack.
0972401|LMP|Okay, there will be no cycling then.
0972407|CC|Roger. We have one question. Who's got the duty tonight or will he be wearing a headset?
0972420|LMP|Yes, he - Ron has the duty. He will be wearing the headset, but I will be on the biomed underneath.
0972426|CC|Understand that. And one note for Gene. It's an addition to that Flight Surgeon's note. When you rehydrate your food, make sure that you go the - let it rehydrate for the maximum amount of time. I know you miss it on this one, but the next - like tomorrow morning, make sure it rehydrates the maximum amount of time.
0972449|LMP|Okay, I'll tell him.
0972451|CC|Roger.
0972500|LMP|And we got the star crater stereo trio.
0972507|CC|Roger.
0972509|LMP|And the - we're - mag - Oscar Oscar is on 93 now. The last three pictures were that trio.
0972820|PAO|This is Apollo control at 97 hours 28 minutes. We're showing -
0972825|LMP|Bob, we're ... complete on the presleep checklist. And except for computing communications configuration and Ron will take care of that.
0972839|CC|Roger.
0972857|LMP|And, Bob, while we're gradually getting in configuration here, let me reiterate something that I've been watching this rev as we did a lot of other things. And that was this relationship of the light-colored or light gray swirl patterns on the surface to patterns - associated pattern - parallel patterns that are darker than the average of the surrounding area. And this is true both in Mare Marginis and in most cases on the back side.
0972948|CC|Roger, Jack. We'll get that to the PI.
0972954|LMP|Roughly, although they're very irregular patterns - roughly it's concentric zoning of dark to light within a intermediate albedo surface. Now there are variations on that theme; sometimes you don't get the symmetry quite as good, but it's common enough that I think it's worth noting.
0973020|CC|Roger.
0973035|LMP|Also, there's a sequence of different kinds of crater filling on the far side, and I think that, as the orbital stay progresses, we may be able to pin down the relative age relationships and the characteristics of those crater fill - filling episodes. Whether they are single episodes that happen in a variety of crater or they're a function of the age and characteristics of the craters in which you find them is not clear right now, but the - they seem to form fairly distinct groupings of crater-fill material.
0973120|CC|Roger. Jack.
0973207|LMP|One of those crater-fill materials that you also see in other kinds of depressions other than craters is a very smooth, light, plains-forming material. And it is, although cratered, when you see it at the terminator, it is smoother than the mare; that is, it does not seem to have the swell, the sea swell characteristics or ridges or any other features other than the crater's superimposed on it.
0973239|CC|Roger. We copy.
0973312|PAO|Apollo 17's orbit now 59.2 by 13.7 nautical miles. The present altitude 17.8 nautical miles.
0973520|CC|17, Houston. You can go ahead and close the UV cover. We'd like to hold off 1 minute before you turn the UV off. We want to look at 1 minute of data with the cover closed.
0973541|LMP|Oh, okay. Roger. A walk-on. I see it now.
0973609|LMP|Okay, it's CLOSED.
0973611|CC|Okay, We'll give you a cue when you go UV, OFF, and INCO would like to know what you've got on your high gain pitch and yaw knobs. Not the dials but the knobs.
0973626|LMP|All right. The knobs are - about plus 20 and 185.
0973644|CC|Okay, PITCH of 20 and 185 on the YAW.
0973653|LMP|That's affirm.
0973822|CC|And, Jack, you can turn the UV off now.
0973838|LMP|Okay, it's OFF.
0974154|LMP|Okay, I got the landing site. We're right over the top of it, and the scarp is fantastically detailed at this - Can you see in there, Gene? Right down, right down, straight down there.
0974207|CDR|No, I can't.
0974216|LMP|Okay, well, the sli - the light mantle is ob - very obviously mantling the area. The scarp was very detailed, and, so far, could not see any structure in the massifs at all, but I haven't had any - didn't have much time to watch it on that pass.
0974247|LMP|The slide very definitely subdued the general detail in the plains area - or the light mantle, if you will, rather than slide. MOCR Crater was finally out of the dark.
0974307|CC|Roger.
0974311|CC|Jack, we'd like to know if you think you can adjust the high gain as close to plus 15 and YAW 190 as possible?
0974343|LMP|Okay, Bob, that's adjusted plus 15 and 190, and I suspect I was a little closer to 15 than 20 when I called you before.
0974351|CC|Roger.
0974358|LMP|I'll tell you, from this altitude and with that low Sun, there's no question of the sharpness of the topographic features in the landing area. The - the scarp, and even some of the apparent back - pardon - backflow features - and Parker will know what I'm talking about - that is apparent flows to the west in the light mantle area were extremely sharp, even those fronts going west were sharp. It looked even more like a mare ridge than it ever did before.
0974442|CC|Roger.
0974602|CDR|Okay, Bob, this is Gene. I had a - just a quick view of the site, and if we're anywhere near it, we'll recognize it, I think, without question. And, I think with that, we'll bid farewell and good night.
0974618|CC|Okay, gang. And looking for a busy day tomorrow - -
0974620|CMP|Never fear. Your old CM - -
0974626|CC|Go ahead; I cut you out.
0974630|CMP|I say never fear, your CMP is watching.
0974634|CC|Roger. And, just a reminder S-BAND - -
0974635|CMP|He's got the watch tonight.
0974636|CC|- - NORMAL VOICE to OFF tonight, please?
0974644|CMP|Okay, okay, as soon as I get bedded down, I'll do that.
0974648|LMP|Don't worry, he's got a batch of guys up here reminding him of that one.
0974653|CMP|And I checked out the little whistle, and it works like a charm.
0974659|CC|Roger. I was betting on - -
0974702|CMP|Just to make sure, I'm going to check it again.
0974703|CC|- - you guys to get that switch last night, and I lost my bet.
0974715|LMP|And, Robert, good night to all.
0974718|CC|Good night up there.
0974723|LMP|And that is a test. This is a test, test, test.
0974728|CDR|Good night, babe.
0974822|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We said goodnight at 97 hours 47 minutes. We'll leave the line up for a few minutes longer, to see whether there's any further conversation.
0975355|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 97 hours 53 minutes. Crew has just turned off the voice switch on the spacecraft, indicating they do not intend to talk anymore tonight, and we do not intend to put in anymore calls to them, so we'll take this line down now and come back up with hourly reports, during the sleep period, which has just started.
0985203|PAO|This is Apollo control at 98 hours 52 minutes. Flight Director, Pete Frank and members of the Orange Team, are preparing to hand over flight control duties to Flight Director, Gene Kranz and the White Team at this time. There will be no change of shift news conference. Shortly after the Orange Team came on duty, the Descent Orbit Insertion number 1 maneuver was performed. At 93 hours 11 minutes 36 seconds, this was a very good burn. Duration 22 seconds. Velocity change of 198.2 feet per second. Resultant orbit was 59.1 by 14.9 nautical miles. Apollo 17 crew since that time has been performing landmark tracking through the sextant, a great deal of photography, and performing the ultraviolet spectrometer and infrared scanning radiometer experiments, and providing surface descriptions, the geology reports and some Earth weather reports from lunar orbit. The infrared experiment will be continued throughout the rest period that the crew is now in. The ultraviolet experiment has been terminated for tonight. The mapping camera is taking longer to extend and retract than expected. And the last operation took 1 minute 24 seconds to extend and 1 minute 51 seconds to retract. Each of these operations should be accomplished in 1 minute 12 seconds. The camera experts will continue to watch this and if the delayed operation continues, they may reduce the number of times that the camera is extended and retracted. Crew said goodnight at 97 hours 47 minutes. They're anticipating a big day tomorrow, landing, first EVA. 7 hours 49 minutes remaining in that rest period. Apollo 17's present orbit is 59.1 by 13.5 nautical miles. And a short time ago the flight dynamics officer gave the flight director the latest impact coordinates for the S-IVB which impacted the lunar surface today at 89 hours 39 minutes 40 seconds. Coordinates for that impact: 4.21 degrees south latitude, 12.31 degrees west longitude. At 98 hours 55 minutes this is mission control Houston.
0991606|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 99 hours 16 minutes. We're about 1 minute from reacquiring Apollo 17 now in its 6th revolution of the Moon. We said goodnight to the crew on the last revolution at 97 hours 47 minutes and the Flight Surgeon reported that it appeared Jack and Ron were both dozing off before we lost radio contact with the spacecraft as it went around behind the Moon on the fifth revolution. Here in Mission Control, Flight Director Gene Kranz has been reviewing the status of the mission with his oncoming team of flight controllers. No problems of note to be reported. The service propulsion system engine, it was reported, looks to be in very good shape as a result of the, or based on the data that we received during the LOI and DOI, the Lunar Orbit Insertion and Descent Orbit Insertion maneuvers performed earlier. The Flight Dynamics Officer, during this shift, is going to be following the spacecraft trajectory very closely looking for any cross range or down range errors which would need to be compensated for prior to the lunar landing. We don't expect any conversations with the crew. We have had confirmation of acquisition of signal now and we'll stand by for a short period of time to get a look at the systems and to assure that we're not going to get a call from the crew.
0992912|PAO|This is Apollo Control. No sign of any activity from the crew. The Flight Surgeon reports that Jack Schmitt and Ron Evans, both of whom are wearing their biomedical sensors during the sleep period, appear to be sleeping soundly at this time. Apollo 17 is currently in an orbit 59.1 by 13.5 nautical miles and we have about 52 minutes remaining before the spacecraft again goes behind the Moon and we lose radio contact. We'll come up with a status report shortly prior to loss of signal. At 99 hours 31 minutes this is Apollo Control Houston.
1002205|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 100 hours 22 minutes. Apollo 17 has now gone behind the Moon and before we lost radio contact the Surgeon reported the crew appeared to be sleeping soundly. We have about 6 hours 22 minutes remaining in this sleep period before the crew awakens to a very busy day which will include landing on the Moon for the Lunar Module Crew, Jack Schmitt and Gene Cernan, and the first Lunar Surface EVA. Shortly before losing radio contact Gene Kranz checked with each of his flight controllers, got a report that everything was in order, no problems as Apollo 17 went behind the Moon. We'll be reacquiring the spacecraft in its seventh revolution in a little less than 45 minutes. At 100 hours 23 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.
1011002|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 101 hours 10 minutes and we are standing by now to re-establish radio contact with Apollo 17 at the beginning of its seventh revolution of the Moon. We anticipate the crew will be sleeping soundly as they were when we last had radio contact with the spacecraft some 45 minutes ago. In fact, the 2 crewmen on whom we have biomedical data, Ron Evans and Jack Schmitt, appeared to have gone to sleep almost as soon as they said goodnight. Very shortly thereafter the surgeon noted the slow down in heart rhythms typical of sleep. And that is the condition they were in when we last saw them at the end of the sixth revolution. And we have reacquired radio contact with Apollo 17 and getting good data from the spacecraft at this time. The crew is scheduled to end this 8 hour rest period in a little over 4 and one half hours from now. And it appears that everything is quiet aboard Apollo 17 and no signs of any crew activity. We will take the lines down and continue to monitor and we'll come up with another status report just prior to Loss of Signal as the spacecraft goes behind the Moon on this the seventh revolution. This is Apollo Control at 101 hours 12 minutes.
1021602|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 102 hours 16 minutes. The sleep watch going very smoothly and very quietly here in Mission Control. We now have 3-1/2 hours until the scheduled crew awakening time. And we've just loss of signal from Apollo 17, now going behind the Moon on its seventh revolution. We'll be reacquiring in about 40 minutes. At the present time we show Apollo 17 in an orbit roughly 59 by 13 nautical miles. And it appears that the crew is continuing to get good sound sleep with 3-1/2, as we said, remaining in the sleep period. At 102 hours 18 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
1030402|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 103 hours 4 minutes. We're standing by now to re-establish radio contact with Apollo 17 as the spacecraft comes around the eastern limb of the Moon and reappears on the front side in it's eighth revolution of the Moon. The crew now, a little more than 5 hours into their sleep period, about 2 hours 40 minutes remaining before we send them the wakeup call. And all spacecraft systems continue to perform normally. No outstanding problems at this time. We are showing Apollo 17 in an orbit of about 59 by 13 nautical miles, and we should be seeing telemetry data shortly now. Radio from the spacecraft being received at the 210 foot dish antenna at Honeysuckle Creek, Australia, near Canberra. And we're once again receiving data from the spacecraft. We, of course, do not expect any activity from the crew and we'll have the lines down during this front side pass, should there be any unexpected conversations we'll bring up the lines immediately. We'll have about 1 hour and 5 minutes before Apollo 17 disappears around the back side of the Moon on the eighth revolution. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
1041000|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 104 hours 10 minutes. Apollo 17 has just gone behind the Moon now. The spacecraft on its eighth revolution of the Moon and we'll be reacquiring in about 45 minutes as Apollo 17 comes back around the eastern limb of the Moon on its nineth revolution. During the nineth revolution we'll be sending the wakeup call to the crew, getting them ready for one of their busiest days on the mission which will include LM seperation from the Command Module and the powered desent to the lunar surface followed by the first period of lunar surface exploration in the valley of the Taurus Mountains. The flight surgeon reports the crew has been getting, apparently, a very good night's sleep. They are now six and one half hours into that scheduled 8 hours sleep period with about an hour and a half of sleep remaining. Apollo 17 in an orbit 59 by 13 nautical miles and if everything goes according to the Flight Plan undocking will occur about 11:20 Central Standard Time on the twelveth revolution with powered descent to the lunar surface coming at about 1:55 PM. At 104 hours 12 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.
1045801|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 104 hours 58 minutes and we're standing by to reacquire radio contact with Apollo 17, spacecraft now in it's nineth revolution of the Moon, and will shortly be coming around the eastern limb of the Moon and back out on the front side. During this front side pass CAPCOM, Joe Allen, will be putting in a call to the crew getting them up and started on a very active day which will include landing on the lunar surface in a valley of the Taurus Mountains near the Sea of Serenity. Our last look at the spacecraft's lunar orbit showed it to be maintaining an orbit fairly close to 13 nautical miles by 59 nautical miles, actually dropping down somewhat below 13 on the pericynthion to about 12.6. And we should have radio contact with the spacecraft shortly, and we'll begin getting telemetry data on all of the spacecraft systems. We have 46 minutes showing until scheduled crew wakeup time. And we've had the AOS call, Acquisition of Signal, getting good high bit rate data at this time. And the flight dynamics officer's orbit display shows Apollo 17 to be in an orbit of a high point of 59.9 nautical miles. The low point or pericynthion of 12.5. We'll come back up a few minutes before the scheduled crew awakening time, about 45 minutes from now, and follow live from that point on as the crew begins preparations for LM activation, seperation, and the landing on the lunar surface. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
1054001|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 105 hours 40 minutes. We're about 5 minutes away now from putting in a call to the crew, getting them up for breakfast, and ready to start a day that will culminate with landing on the lunar surface and the first EVA at the Taurus Mountain site, Taurus Littrow, near the Sea of Serenity. CAPCOM, Joe Allen, will be putting in a call to the crew in about 4-1/2 minutes from now and we'll stand by for that wakeup call to the crew of Apollo 17. Here in the control center the landing shift, landing team of flight controllers, is beginning to come on duty, after a very quiet uneventful night monitoring Apollo 17 in lunar orbit. The spacecraft now on its nineth revolution of the Moon completing the front side pass and we'll be losing contact with the command module as it goes behind the Moon on the nineth revolution in about 22 minutes.

1055354|CMP|And a big eight-wheeler.
1055407|CC|And, America, you're 10 minutes from LOS, and the spacecraft looks great.
1055419|LMP|Okay, Joe. That's good to hear. And we're starting to move now, and we'll be ready for you when we come around.
1055426|CC|All righty.
1055433|LMP|How long are you with us this morning?
1055437|CC|Oh, not too many more minutes.
1055443|LMP|Hope we didn't keep you up last night.
1055449|CC|The pleasure was ours, Jack. We devoted our 8 hours to selecting your wakeup call this morning and got a little help from the news room pool on that suggestion.
1055510|LMP|Well, that was a good suggestion. I had forgotten all about that song. That's a good one.
1055534|LMP|You ought to find the "Golden Rockets" for us some morning.
1055545|CC|You'll wish you hadn't asked.
1055655|CC|17, this is Houston. You'll be pleased to hear that the IR in the SIM bay is returning some beautiful data to us here.
1055708|CMP|Hey; great, Joe. That's good to hear, by gosh.
1055711|LMP|What are you learning, Joe?
1055715|CC|Hotspots on the Moon, Jack.
1055725|LMP|Well, we know we had one going around it. We didn't know we had any on it.
1055735|CMP|Houston, the LM/CM DELTA-P is 0.4.
1055741|CC|Copy that.
1055750|LMP|Where - where is your big anomalies, Joe? Can you summarize quickly?
1055757|CC|Jack, we'll get - get that for you next pass.
1055804|LMP|Well, don't worry about it. I think we're going to have a lot of things on our mind the next pass. But we're just passing over Orientale again, Joe, and in earthlight it's probably one of the most spectacular sights in nature.
1055834|CC|Copy that, Jack. I can imagine.
1060039|LMP|Joe, can you imagine waking up anywhere else?
1060057|CC|17, we'll think about that until you go LOS.
1060110|LMP|Roger.
1060138|CC|17, about 30 seconds to LOS. We'll see you on the other side. It's boing to be a good day.

1060147||BEGIN LUNAR REV 10
1060240|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've now had loss of signal as Apollo 17 goes behind the Moon on the ninth revolution. We'll be reacquiring in about 45 minutes - a little bit less, as the spacecraft comes back on the front side on the tenth revolution. And by that time the crew should have completed breakfast. They'll be getting the pressure suits unstowed and begin preparations for entering the lunar module, for the separation, landing on the lunar surface, and the first EVA, all scheduled to occur this day. The IR data which Joe Allen advised the crew we're getting in such good form back here on the ground from the spacecraft's service module, is from the IR scanning radiometer. This is an instrument carried in the CSM SIM bay, Scientific Instrument Module bay. And it's obtaining surface temperatures under the groundtrack of the spacecraft from which scientist will be able to construct a temperature map. From this information they hope to be able to characterize such lunar surface physical parameters as the general conductivity, the bulk density, and the specific heat. Apollo 17 at the present time is in an orbit about 59 nautical miles at it's high point and about 12-1/2 miles above the lunar surface at the low point. At 106 hours 5 minutes this is Apollo Control Houston.
1065046|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 106 hours 51 minutes. We're about 2 minutes now from reacquiring Apollo 17 as the spacecraft comes back around on the front side of the Moon on the tenth revolution. And when we again establish radio contact the crew should have pretty well finished breakfast and be getting suited up, ready for Jack Schmitt and Gene Cernan to enter the lunar module and begin preparations for separation, powered descent to the lunar surface. Here in the control center we're in the process of a shift handover. Flight Director, Gerry Griffin, and the team of flight controllers who will be on during today's powered descent are now coming on to replace the Gene Kranz team. Flight Director Neil Hutchinson will be in charge of CSM activities once the two vehicles separate. CAPCOM for the lunar module will be Astronaut Gordon Fullerton and Astronaut Ken Mattingly is moving in taking up position at the console to handle CSM activities. And we're now about 30 seconds away from reacquiring Apollo 17.
1065317|PAO|INCO reports acquisition of signal. We'll stand by for a call to the crew.
1065436|LMP|Okay, Houston. We're with you and we're in the process of getting the tunnel pressurized and moving right towards probe and drogue removal.
1065449|CC|Okay, Jack. Good morning.
1065454|LMP|Good morning, Gordy. Welcome aboard.
1065458|CC|Thank you.
1065513|LMP|I take it you're going to pick up the - the reports - post-sleep reports later. is that correct? From Ron?
1065523|CC|Any way it's convenient to you.
1065529|LMP|Well, we're moving towards getting the suits on. Unless you want me to take 5 minutes here, we'll leave it alone and let Ron give it to you.
1065539|CC|That'll be fine.

1065659|CC|Okeydoke, Ron.
1065712|CDR|Gordy, how does America look to you this morning?
1065718|CC|Beautiful, as it has all the way to date.
1065729|CDR|Okay.
1070040|CMP|Okay, Houston; America. The old probe is underneath the couch.
1070048|CC|Okay.
1070345|CMP|Houston, America.
1070348|CC|Go ahead, America.
1070353|CMP|Okay. How are Jack's EKGs and stuff. He's going to tape them now.
1070359|CC|Let me get a check.
1070400|CMP|(Chuckle) Wait a minute, he's not plugged in. But, you know, he's had them on all night. Were they good?
1070410|CC|Stand by.
1070416|CC|Yes, when he was plugged in we had good signals.
1070423|CMP|Okay; good.
1070804|CC|America, Houston. If someone's near the telemetry switch, if you go to ACCEPT, we'll give you a state vector.
1070820|CMP|Okay. You have ACCEPT.
1070824|CC|Okay. And as we're supposed to update your trajectory, which is looking good - predicted perilune at PDI without DOI-2 would be 11.9, a little lower. So that means that DOI-2 will be a little less, in terms of DELTA-V, than nominal. But, otherwise, looking good.
1070852|CMP|Okay. Did you say 11.2 for perigee, now - without DOI-2?
1070858|CC|I might have said that. It's 11.9 predicted at PDI time without DOI-2.
1070909|CMP|Oh okay, 11.9 predicted without - at PDI time without DOI-2.
1070914|CC|That's right.
1070917|CMP|Okay, so DOI-2 will be a little less than predicted.
1070920|CC|Affirmative.
1070926|CMP|I'm repeating it to these guys that are getting suited here, see.
1070930|CC|Okay.
1071027|CC|Okay. I have your vector now. You can go back to BLOCK.
1071033|CMP|Okay. We'll go to BLOCK.
1071311|CC|America, Houston. You owe us a reverification of docking tunnel index angle.
1071322|CMP|Okay. Let me check it.
1071334|CMP|Well, I kept ... thinking it might move back to zero, but it hasn't moved - plus 1.2.
1071340|CC|Okay; plus 1.2. For your information, Ron, on consumables this morning, we're running 6 percent above the Flight Plan line on RCS. On the hydrogen, we're about 8 percent above the line on TANK 2; right on the lines on the other two hydrogen tanks. And on the O2, we're running our standard 4 to 5 percent below the line on oxygen TANK 1; TANK 2 is right on; and TANK 3 has now gained to about 3 percent above the line. All looking good.
1071426|CMP|Okay, Houston. Hey, that's mighty fine.

1072253|CMP|Okay. Here we go on the LMPs food.
1072256|CC|Okay.
1072301|CMP|Okay; two bacon squares, scrambled eggs, two apricots, cocoa, and a coffee. Meal B: fruitcake, cit - citrus beverage, hamburger, and a coffee. Meal C: lemonade, beef and gravy, ambrosia, cereal bar, and tea. I guess that's it.
1072402|CC|Okay.
1072432|CMP|Hey, Houston. Why don't I give you LMPs menu this morning too - day 5?
1072438|CC|Okay.
1072438|CMP|Then I won't have to get back in their pages. Okay. It's a sausage patty for LMP - sausage patties, cinamon-toasted bread, instant breakfast, coffee with K, and a grape drink, and a vitamin. Okay, for the commander on day 5: spiced oat cereal, sausage patties, instant breakfast, and vitamins.
1072523|CC|Roger.

1072715|CMP|Okay, Bacon squares, scrambled eggs, cornflakes, orange juice, two coffee, three caramel candies - that's three sticks of caramel candy. Meal B: chicken and rice, meatballs, butterscotch pudding, orange PA drink. I missed the vitamins up there in A, too. Okay, Meal C: potato soup, beef and gravy, chicken stew, orange GF drink, tea, chocolate bar, and a package of pecans.
1072904|CMP|Okay; CMP medical log: PRD 15034, and about 5-1/2 of good sleep; a little trouble getting to sleep last night, and I woke up early this morning. I took a Seconal; didn't seem to have much good - much effect, and I had four cans of water.
1072935|CC|Roger.
1072945|CMP|I think I was on the biomed all the time last night, too, so you can check out that sleep.
1072953|CC|Okay, Ron, While you've got that book with you, I can give you a one-line change to the E-memory load as a result of our changing the short-burn constant.
1073010|CMP|Okay. Stand by 1 here.
1073116|CMP|Okay, Houston; America. I've got the right page now.
1073119|CC|Okay. It's page 1-43. It's load Delta. Identifier number 5; the old value is 01606. Change that to 01637.
1073144|CMP|Okay. It'll be load Delta, and the octal identifier 05, and its new value is 01637.
1073155|CC|That's correct.
1073234|CMP|Okay. The LMP has got his suit on. They're connecting up the LCG water connection, and he's still unzipped.
1073245|CC|Okay, Ron. In the Flight Plan, you're coming up on a VERB 45 and then going to P00 prior to the P52. After going to P00, we'd like you to change to B/D ROLL from A/C. Over.
1073303|CMP|Okay. We'll change the B/D ROLL. Looks like we're going to run into a problem on our P52 down here, with these guys getting suited. is it really necessary now?
1073319|CC|There's no time criticality on that. When they're out of the way, go ahead with it.
1073328|CMP|Okay. Good.
1074244|LMP|Okay, Houston, how do you read the LMP?
1074247|CC|LMP, you're loud and clear.
1074252|LMP|Okay, Gordy, I'm opening the hatch.
1074255|CC|Okay.
1074305|LMP|And the light's still on.
1074309|CC|Roger.
1074336|LMP|Okay, Gordy. Index 1 plus - or plus 1.2.
1074342|CC|Roger.
1074549|CMP|Okay, Houston, I'm going to skip the P52 for a while and maneuver to the docking attitude - undock attitude, that is.
1074600|CC|Roger. - Stand by on that one, Ron.
1074612|CMP|Wilco.
1074614|CC|We want to be sure we can get some stars - good stars in the undock attitude.
1074714|CC|Ron, this is Houston. We didn't see you do a VERB 45. Over.
1074722|CMP|You're right. Good one.
1074726|CC|And if there's any - if you - if there's no reason why not, we'd just as soon you go ahead and do the P52 now. Finish that off and then start the maneuver. Over.
1074741|CMP|Okay. The big reason is that Gene's getting into his suit right now.
1074748|CC|Okay.
1074748|CMP|As soon as he gets out and gets in his suit, well, I'll do a P52 maneuver.
1074752|CC|Okay.
1074834|CC|Ron, Houston. Can you give us AUTO on the HIGH GAIN?
1074845|CMP|Okay. Just a second, Houston.
1074922|LMP|We're transferring to LM POWER, Houston.
1074924|CMP|Okay; OFF, RESET, back to OFF.
1074930|LMP|Okay. We have LM POWER.
1074932|CMP|Okay. That was 107:49:28.
1074939|CC|Roger.
1075016|LMP|LM WATER is OPEN, and O2 is OPEN.
1075020|CC|Roger.
1075055|LMP|Okay; 3-4, Houston, in the LM. And step 1 is good.
1075105|CC|Okay.
1075231|LMP|Okay. Step 2 is complete.
1075234|CC|Okay, Jack.
1075238|LMP|And I'm going off of CSM comm, and I'll be coming at you before long on S-BAND, if I can.
1075250|CC|Okay.
1075615|CC|Ron, Houston. We've taken a look at stars available in the undock attitude, and they don't look too good. We suggest you use the present attitude for your 52 and then maneuver. Over.
1075630|CMP|Okay. I'm just about to get Gene out of the way here, and then I will.
1075633|CC|Okay, and we're less than 3 minutes to LOS now. So when you finish that 52, we'd like you to copy down the NOUN 5 and 93s for us.
1075645|CMP|Okay; will do.
1075823|CC|America, Houston. About 1 minute to LOS. Nothing further for you. We'll see you on the other side.
1075833|CMP|Okay, Gordo. We're hustling like hell. We might make it. (Laughter)

1075838||BEGIN LUNAR REV 11
1075932|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 107:59 Ground Elapsed Time into the mission of Apollo 17. We've had loss of signal at this time as Apollo 17 coasted behind the Moon on the tenth lunar orbit. Approximately 47 minutes until the spacecraft both come around the far side as the crew prepares to transfer into the lunar module; that is, Cernan and Schmitt prepare to transfer into the lunar module. Get it powered up in preparation for today's activities of the Descent Orbit Insertion maneuver number 2 and ultimately the landing at Taurus-Littrow and the first extravehicular activity. As they come around the Moon on the eleventh revolution, they will have checked out the lunar module with a few exceptions such as they will deploy the landing gear after acquistion of signal. Also at that time, both spacecraft, Challenger and America, though still docked, will be on separate air to ground links. The lunar module will be on the normal channel; the command service module link, with Ron Evans, will be piped into Room 161 in the News Center building for those newsmen covering the mission who prefer to listen to the command service module orbital science activities. As Apollo 17 went behind the western limb of the Moon, the orbit measured 12 nautical miles at pericynthion and 60.2 at apocynthion. Some maneuvers coming up - the next major maneuver for the lunar module will be the descent orbit insertion number 2 which at this time is predicted, or is calculated to take place at a Ground Elapsed Time of 112 hours 1 minute 59.1 seconds. Total burn time of 21.8 seconds. For a Delta V or velocity change of 7.6 feet per second, which will change the orbit to an apocynthion of 60.4 nautical miles and a pericynthion, or nearest approach, which is just uprange of the landing site, of 6.7 nautical miles. The big maneuver of the day, of course, is Powered Descent and Landing, which at this time is calculated to take place at a Ground Elapsed Time of 112 hours 49 minutes 27 seconds, lasting 11 minutes and 57 seconds, plus whatever hover time is available as they get down to the landing site. Total Delta V, or velocity change, to get out of orbit and break into the descent path and ultimately the hovering and touchdown at Taurus-Littrow is 6,693 feet per second. Some 43 minutes now away from acquisition as Apollo 17, America and Challenger, come from behind the Moon on orbit number 11. And at 108:04 Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
1084456|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 108 hours 44 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Less than 2 minutes away from acquisition as America and Challenger, the spacecraft of Apollo 17, come around from behind the Moon on lunar orbit number 11. At that time the voice downlinks from both spacecrafts will be separated. For those newsmen in Houston who wish to listen to the voice from Ron Evans in the command service module, this will be available in room 161 in the Newscenter Office Wing. At the time the spacecraft reappears from behind the Moon, the crew should have completed most of the lunar module checkout procedures, and be prepared for deploying the landing gear, and a series of communications checks with the ground. Just before loss of signal on the eleventh revolution, the crew will be given a GO / NO-GO for undocking and separation, which will take place during the time when the spacecraft is behind the Moon near the end of revolution number 11. In other words, when they reappear again, they will be flying separately on the twelfth revolution. We should have acquisition any moment now, we've counted down to zero on the acquisition of signal clocks here in the Control Center. It takes a few seconds for the ground to lock up solidly with the downlink signal with the spacecraft. Network reports acquisition of signal, let's bring up the line and listen for the first call.
1084734|LMP|There we go. Should have done that in the first place.
1084755|LMP|Okay, Okay.
1084802|CC|Challenger, this is Houston. How do you read?
1084812|CDR|Hello, Gordie, this is Challenger, we read you loud and clear.
1084815|CC|Okay. You're readable. Lots of background noise at the moment.
1084824|CDR|Okay. We'll update you in just a minute.
1084830|LMP|Okay, Gene, that's locked.
1084839|LMP|Okay. Another one is verify locked. The band was up. So you're locked here; the red thing is in.
1084847|CDR|Okay.
1084848|LMP|And I'll ... you up.
1084852|CDR|Okay, and I got it over here.
1084855|LMP|Okay. Okay. Comm checks.
1084902|CDR|Let me give them an E-memory dump. I can press on. Gordy, Jack will update you in just a second. And I've got some words for you, but I'd like to give you an E-memory dump as soon as you get the steerable.
1084912|LMP|... they got the steerable. Okay.
1084916|LMP|Okay, Gordy. How do you read the LMP? This is your S-BAND T/R in secondary power amp check.
1084923|CC|Okay, LMP. You're clear. Lots of background noise though.
1084931|LMP|Okay. I'm going to bring up the steerable.
1084933|CC|Okay; go ahead.
1085021|SC|Okay, steerable ...
1085113|CDR|... going to make it?
1085117|LMP|... switch here, I have to wait for this one.
1085135|CDR|Pitch is good. ...
1085152|LMP|Okay. YAW minus 0.2.
1085157|CDR|Yaw is good.
1085230|CDR|Do you know where our scissors - -
1085231|LMP|Okay, Houston. How do you read?
1085233|CC|Okay. You're loud and clear, Jack.
1085236|LMP|Yes, they're in the - -
1085238|CDR|Okay. Okay.
1085239|LMP|... data file.
1085243|LMP|Hey, Ron. We need to check out that VHF. You ought to get that done before you close up, Ron. Houston, we'll be right with you. We're going to check out our VHF. Let me finish this part of it, and then - we'll get that.
1085305|LMP|Okay. You want to read that to me, Gene - the S-BAND?
1085310|CDR|Okay. Where are you now?
1085312|LMP|I'm right here in the middle of the page.
1085315|CDR|Okay. S-BAND PM.
1085317|LMP|PM.
1085318|CDR|Secondary - -
1085332|LMP|Houston, How do you read the LM?
1085334|CC|Loud and clear, Jack.
1085340|LMP|Okay. We're in step 2, and - we're giving you your second S-BAND check. And I'm going TRACK MODE AUTO.
1085348|CC|Okay. You sound good.
1085405|LMP|Okay, Houston, I can hear the antenna rumbling up there, but - I still have not peaked. Still reading 3.7.
1085416|CC|Okay. You're loud and clear, Jack. It looks like a good lock to us.
1085422|LMP|Okay. We'll leave it - Okay. I'll leave it there, and I'm going BIOMED RIGHT.
1085431|CC|Roger.
1085435|LMP|Okay. SQUELCH is OFF. How do you read?
1085438|CC|Still loud and clear.
1085444|LMP|Roger. Okay ...
1085510|LMP|Hello, Houston. I'm ready to give you an E-memory dump.
1085513|CC|Okay. We're ready to take it. Go ahead.
1085515|LMP|Okay, Ron, how do you - Ron, how do you read on SIMPLEX Bravo?
1085523|LMP|I do not read you. Coming at you.
1085535|CMP|Okay. I don't read you at all, Jack.
1085537|LMP|Hey, Ron, I do not read you. Check your VHF switch.
1085547|CMP|Okay. I'm down to SIMPLEX Bravo.
1085554|LMP|Yes; go ahead.
1085559|CMP|I'm talking on B now. How do you read?
1085603|LMP|I do not read you. Do you read me?
1085605|CMP|No, I don't read you at all either, Jack.
1085610|CMP|No, I don't read you.
1085626|CMP|Okay. I've got everything on in my AUTO panel. Let me try the other one for backup.
1085649|CMP|Yes, I'm on LEFT. On what? Let me go to BACKUP.
1085654|LMP|Okay. I've got you; I got you.
1085656|CMP|I don't have you, yet.
1085659|CMP|Okay.
1085701|LMP|Okay. How do you read on VHF Bravo? You're loud and clear.
1085704|CMP|Hey, I finally got you.
1085706|LMP|That was my fault, Ron.
1085707|CMP|Okay. You were kind of clipping there for a little bit. I got the last part of your transmission.
1085713|LMP|Okay. It was just warming up. You're loud and clear now.
1085717|CMP|Okay. I heard it - I just missed - I just missed it. It was just warming up, but I got the loud and clear.
1085722|CDR|Okay, Houston. I've got a couple I want to pass out to you.
1085725|CC|Go ahead, Gene.
1085731|CDR|Okay. When I first put in the - -
1085734|LMP|Okay, Ron, how do you read now?
1085735|CDR|- - LGC breaker -
1085736|CMP|Okay. I read you loud and clear; that's VHF B.
1085740|CDR|Stand by, Houston.
1085744|LMP|Am I clipping now, Ron?
1085746|CMP|Yes, I didn't hear you at all that time.
1085748|LMP|Am I clipping now?
1085750|CMP|Yes, you're still clipping. All I got was "now."
1085759|LMP|Okay. How do you read now?
1085801|CMP|Okay. "How do you read now?" I got that.
1085803|LMP|Okay. I guess we're okay. It was the squelch.
1085807|CMP|(Laughter) Then I missed that part of it.
1085816|CDR|Ron, how do you hear, Gene?
1085819|CMP|Okay. Loud and clear, Gene.
1085820|CDR|Okay; very good.
1085822|LMP|How do you read the LMP now, Ron?
1085826|CMP|Now, you're still clipping, Jack. Can you move your mikes a little bit closer or something?
1085834|LMP|Okay. How do you read now?
1085836|CMP|No, I didn't read you at all that time.
1085840|LMP|How do you read now?
1085841|CMP|Not clear.
1085843|LMP|Okay. I've got the SQUELCH to full decrease.
1085849|CMP|Well, you're going to have to yell or something. I still - you're still clipping yourself out, Jack.
1085853|LMP|Okay. Do you read Gene, Ron?
1085857|CMP|No, I didn't read you that time.
1085858|CDR|Okay. We're going to press on and get these VHF checks GO. We can cut them.
1085903|CMP|Okay. Okay; switching to Alfa.
1085912|CMP|Bravo is off; SIMPLEX Alfa is on.
1085920|LMP|Okay, Ron. How do you read on Alfa?
1085924|CMP|Don't read you.
1085927|LMP|How do you read on Alfa, Ron?
1085929|CMP|Don't read you.
1085933|LMP|How do you read the LMP on Alfa, Ron?
1085940|CMP|Okay. I don't read you guys at all, except through the tunnel.
1085949|CDR|How do you read on Alfa, Ron?
1085951|CMP|Okay. Got you loud and clear that time. And, Gene, can you verify the capture latches are all engaged?
1090000|CDR|Okay. How do you read me?
1090002|CMP|I didn't read you at all, Jack.
1090004|CDR|This is Gene. How do you read me on Alfa?
1090006|CMP|Didn't read you.
1090007|CDR|Okay. Let's press on. You're getting us intermittent. We can get it.
1090010|CMP|Okay. I got you that time, and check the capture latches.
1090017|CDR|Okay, Houston. I'm pretty sure the VHF - -
1090020|CMP|Okay?
1090020|CDR|- - is all right. It seems to have something to do with the SQUELCH setting, and it's probably because we're so close.
1090028|CC|Okay. We concur. We'd like you to press on and not worry about the VHF any more for now.
1090035|CDR|Okay, Gordo. We are. Here's a couple of quick ones. When I pushed the LGC DSKY breaker IN, I did not get a restart light. The keyboard came up with 400 in R-2. The LGC light was already on, and it went off as prescribed. When I did a VERB 35, I got all the proper lights except when the LGC and isS lights came on, the entire CAUTION and WARNING dimmed. One more item. In our DAP setting, we are reading in our checklist for R-l plus 645 and for R-2 plus 641. The DSKY DAP came up plus 641 and plus 645. It just reversed those numbers. And I'm going to deploy the landing gear.
1090135|CC|Okay.
1090151|CDR|Okay, Houston. MASTER ARM is on, and B light is on.
1090154|CC|Roger.
1090157|CDR|Roger. Are you ready for a landing gear?
1090157|CMP|Yes, I'm up in the tunnel, but go ahead.
1090203|CDR|Ron, if you read, the landing gear is coming on my MARK.
1090207|CMP|Okay. I read you. Go ahead.
1090207|CDR|3, 2, 1 -
1090211|CDR|MARK.
1090214|CDR|Hey, Houston. We got a good one out front.
1090217|CC|Sounds good.
1090217|CMP|(Laughter)
1090221|CC|We show them all deployed.
1090223|CDR|And the flag is gray. Okay. The flag is gray.
1090227|CC|Roger.
1090227|LMP|Okay, Houston. The PRIMARY EVAP FLOW time, 108 - EVAP FLOW time 108:16:55. And I'm ready to copy your abort constants and a DOI-2 pad.
1090241|CC|Okay, Jack. Here come the abort constants. 224 is - 6 - -
1090248|LMP|Stand by, Gordy.
1090251|CC|Okay. Stand by.
1090258|CDR|Ron, when you get the tunnel closed out, I'll need you for an IMU coarse align.
1090306|CMP|Okay. I'm getting the probe umbilicals installed now.
1090315|CDR|Okay. I'll need your NOUN 20s, when you get a chance.
1090318|LMP|Okay, Gordy. You can go ahead, and you have DATA on the UPDATA LINK.
1090327|CC|Okay. We'll have the up-link in a minute. 224 is 60470, 29364, 60386, 00594, 32772, 54404. Go ahead.
1090400|LMP|Okay. 60470, 29364, 60386, 00594, 32772, 54404.
1090418|CC|Okay. That was a good readback. Ready with DOI-2 when you are.
1090429|LMP|Okay, Gordy. Go ahead.
1090432|CC|Okay. The - it's DOI-2; TIG time is 112:02:40.92; NOUN 81 is a minus 0007.5, DELTA-Vy plus all balls, and DELTA-Vg is plus all balls.
1090454|CMP|Okay, Gene. Can you look at the capture latches? I've got it preloaded here now.
1090500|CC|NOUN 42, 00615 - -
1090504|CMP|Okay. Preload the - it's pushing on by, so I'll going to - ... preloaded.
1090504|CC|- - plus 00067 - -
1090512|CMP|Okay.
1090512|CC|- - 00075; burn time 0:22, 000, 074 - -
1090530|CMP|What do you mean; probe locked?
1090530|CMP|Yes, it was locked. Oh, the dorgue. Yes. Yes, it's locked in there.
1090530|CC|And 373 is a 0122.7.
1090536|CC|The AGS DELTA-Vs are NA.
1090543|LMP|Okay, Gordy. 112:02:40.92; minus three zeros 75, plus all zeros, plus all zeros; 00615, plus three zeros 67, three zeros 75; 0:22; all zeros, 074; 0122.7; rest of pad NA.
1090614|CC|That's correct, Jack.
1090628|CDR|Okay. Stand by - I've - let's see. Okay.
1090633|CDR|Okay. I need your numbers then. NOUN 20.
1090639|LMP|Okay, Gordy. I'm going to start the lunar batt check, and it'll be silent.
1090647|CC|Okay. We're watching.
1090648|CDR|Ron, I need your - your NOUN 20 numbers.
1090707|CDR|Okay. I got 356.95, 106.34, and 001.49.
1090714|CMP|Right?
1090717|CC|Challenger, we want to get the attitude tweaked back up closer to the normal before doing the coarse align.
1090717|CC|America, Houston.
1090734|CDR|Hey, Ron, they want a more normal attitude for you You're not quite nominal.
1090752|CDR|If you're talking to me, it's about 0 - 104.7 and then 0.
1090805|CC|Challenger, the up-link's in there. It's your computer.
1090811|CDR|Okay, Gordy. Thank you. And, Ron, let me know when you're tweaked up, and then go MIN DEADBAND ATT HOLD.
1090822|CMP|Okay, Houston; America. 0105 and 0, correct?
1090825|CC|Yes, sir.
1090843|CMP|That's interesting. I don't know how it got off attitude.
1090851|CC|Yes, I was going to ask you the same thing. You might have knocked a - a stick or something while everybody was flailing around down there. Could you - -
1090902|CMP|Maybe - maybe I hit the stick or something. Yes.
1090905|CC|Yes.
1090914|CMP|Okay, Gene. We're MIN DEADBAND ATT hold at 0105 and 0.
1090918|CDR|Okay. Read out NOUN 20.
1090923|CMP|Okay; VERB 6, NOUN 20: 000.32, 104.40, 359.55
1090944|CDR|Okay. I got all those.
1090946|CMP|Okay.
1090950|LMP|Okay, Houston. I skipped a step on LUNAR BAT, OFF/RESET; I'll go back.
1090958|CMP|Okay, Houston. I forgot to release the docking latches. Okay. I'll go up and release the docking latches 1 and 7.
1091005|CC|Okay.
1091008|CMP|And if I just put the - No, I won't that.
1091013|CC|Jack, we need the - we think you missed a step. We need to -
1091014|CMP|I was going to say you could read the probe temp if I put the circuit breakers in.
1091019|CC|CDR, LUNAR BAT, OFF/RESET.
1091021|LMP|Yes. That's right, I'll go - that's affirm; I'll go back. Stand by.
1091028|CC|Okay.
1091035|CMP|Okay. There's number 1. One releases; two releases, and it's free - -
1091040|LMP|Okay. I'm back to LUNAR BAT - LMP LUNAR BAT OFF/RESET.
1091043|CMP|- Seven.
1091051|CC|Roger.
1091058|CDR|Okay, Gordy. For the LM, I've got 300.88, 284, and three balls 45. How does that sound?
1091059|CMP|One release, two releases, and it's free.
1091110|CC|Stand by. We're checking.
1091136|CMP|Okay. DOCKING PROBE circuit breakers; two of them are going CLOSE. MAIN A. MAIN B. PROBE EXTEND/RELEASE is going to RETRACT. Ah ha, I've got two barber poles.
1091152|CC|Okay, Geno. Those angles are okay.
1091156|CC|That's a good sign.
1091157|CDR|Okay, figured they were. They're going in.
1091201|CMP|Okay. The docking probe circuit breakers are going to open. Okay. EXTEND/RELEASEs, and they went gray, of course, when they went open. Okay. EXTEND/RELEASE to OFF. Verify probe extend latch engage indicator not visible. Well, I'll go back - it wasn't awhile ago, but I'll go look again. Only if you hit EXTEND with the circuit breakers in. Mighty fine. It's still back inside there. Extend latch is still engaged.
1091334|CDR|Okay, Ron. On my mark, I'd like an 06 20.
1091337|CMP|Okay. Standing by. Go ahead.
1091344|CDR|Okay, 3, 2, 1 -
1091346|CDR|MARK it.
1091348|CMP|Okay. 000.44, 104.63, 359.69.
1091409|CDR|Okay. Got those.
1091421|CC|Okay, Challenger. We've got those angles here on the ground - -
1091424|LMP|Okay - -
1091424|CC|- - for both spacecraft.
1091429|CDR|Fine, Gordy.
1091430|LMP|Okay, Houston, ED bat, 37.2, 37.2 at 109:14:00.
1091439|CC|Roger.
1091447|LMP|And all battery indications onboard were normal, once I got started.
1091452|CC|Okay. They looked good to us, also.
1091500|CC|America, Houston, in order to get on and stay on the time line, I'll remind you about the lithium canister after PDI; we can let that one go. And if you'd like to let the camera business slide until after your suit check and we'll get those things. I'll come back and remind you of those, too.
1091504|CDR|Ron, I want you to stay in that MIN DEADBAND ATT HOLD. I'm going to do a P52.
1091521|CMP|Okay. I've got the - the cameras all set. I got them out, anyhow. I don't have the - the right values on the lenses yet; but, anyhow, the camera are out and they're loaded.
1091535|CC|Okay.
1091536|CMP|I've got mag OO on the Hasselblad.
1091536|LMP|Houston, this is the LMP a couple minor things on the back-side checkout. The secondary glycol pump, when I started it, the sound and the pressure was ragged, oscillated around - 20 psi, and then stabilized. After about 15 seconds, it sounded smooth. It had a sound as if it was cavitating a little bit; but, after that, it was smooth. Over.
1091611|CC|Copy that, Jack.
1091613|CMP|Okay, Houston. Why don't I go ahead and get the PGA ver out of the way, and then we can get some of the - data, or would you rather get the data up first?
1091616|LMP|And on step 3 on page 3-15 - -
1091622|LMP|- - When I went to SUIT FAN 1, I got a MASTER ALARM - -
1091624|CC|No, it's your choice. Why don't we go ahead and get the PGA, and I'll just sit on these pads, and could you tell me if you ever got around to playing with the squelch on the VHF?
1091625|LMP|- - but all other indications were okay, and the MASTER ALARM reset.
1091633|CC|Okay.
1091640|LMP|Okay. I'm sorry. I misinterpreted the words there; I should have gotten that. Forget that one.
1091640|CMP|Man, I did. And, let's see, we're at SQUELCH A now. I've even got it all the way down to 1, and I still don't hear them.
1091646|CC|Roger. We concur.
1091656|CC|Okay. You did get a satisfactory check on your side, didn't you?
1091700|LMP|Okay, Geno. You need some help?
1091704|CMP|Oh, yes.
1091705|CC|Okay.
1091707|CMP|I got a satisfactory - Every once in a while I can hear them now; they're cutting in and out somewhere, I don't know where.
1091712|CC|All righty.
1091739|CMP|Okay. SQUELCH A is set at about 4.
1091752|CC|And, America, we'll give you a state vector if you give us ACCEPT.
1091801|CMP|Okay. You have it.
1091803|CC|Thank you.
1091848|CDR|... what star you got, 30? Or no, what star?
1091854|LMP|Loaded it? Okay. Okay, and those are the numbers, Hey, that's good. Okay. You ready to mark? What do you want first? ...
1092030|CC|Jack, we'd like to take a look at the glycol pump pressure. Can you close the GLYCOL PUMP SECONDARY pressure breaker?
1092038|LMP|Better finish this.
1092109|LMP|Gordy, you want the secondary?
1092112|CC|That's affirmative; panel 16, GLYCOL PUMP SECONDARY breaker - third row, in the middle.
1092220|LMP|Okay. We've got a GLYCOL light, and the temperature is 50.
1092228|CC|Okay. The pressure looked good there. We'd like that breaker back open. The MASTER ALARM you have is normal.
1092246|LMP|Roger. Understand it.
1092413|CMP|Houston, America. How much time to AOS, yet - LOS?
1092416|CC|Oh, about 29 minutes.
1092421|CMP|Oh, okay. Got a little time for the PGA ver then, I guess.
1092431|CC|And it's your computer, anytime you want to get it, Ron.
1092437|CMP|Okay.
1092446|CMP|Ah ha, I got the old helmet and gloves on.
1092507|CMP|More cables all over the place here than I know what to do with.
1092514|CC|Well, this place looks like a pigpen - you've run the same course everyone else has, I guess.
1092522|CMP|(Laughter) I got cables and hoses and -
1092641|CMP|Son-of-a-muck - I hit the stick again. Now I got to unlock it.
1092648|CDR|Ron, keep in MIN DEADBAND ATT hold. I've got to finish the P52.
1092654|CMP|Okay. You want me to maneuver back to attitude, Gene?
1092655|CDR|No, just stay where you are.
1092701|CMP|We're out of attitude just a little bit. Well I'm MIN DEADBAND, but I maneuvered out of attitude. You want to go back to regular attitude?
1092702|CDR|Just stay where you are, and put it in MIN DEADBAND.
1092710|CDR|No! N O, no.
1092751|CMP|Okay, Houston. ... flow return is ... SUIT FLOW valve. The other two are closed; mine is open, and I got the inner connect in between the other ones.
1092804|CC|Sounds good.
1092805|CMP|How's the old suit pressure? Okay. Looks like pretty good. Okay. O2 flow is lower limit. Okay. Let's go up to PRESS. Here we go. That's going up to PRESS, and it feels like it's going up.
1092845|CMP|And terminal direct O2 on air to ... O2 FLOW HIGH.
1092852|CDR|Hey, Ron. This is Challenger. We're going to be off your loop for awhile, so we can finish the mark.
1092858|CMP|Okay. Wait a minute, Jack. I'll just go to RECEIVE on the VHF. I'll just go to RECEIVE on the VHF, Jack.
1092928|CMP|Okay. Let's see, and there's a DELTA-P of about - 6-1/2 - Now we're going to cycle suit circuit return air. Okay. It's out; it's back in. Okay. Now we can squirt a little more O2 flow in.
1093003|CMP|Whoo hoo! - There we go. Man, oh man!
1093019|CMP|DIRECT O2 is off.
1093028|CMP|That's coming down. Shoot! I'm reading 4.5 in my suit. is that right?
1093037|CMP|5.
1093041|CC|Looks like about 4 on our meter, Ron.
1093048|CMP|Well, I'll be darned. The old suit gage read 4.5.
1093101|CMP|... that close in there. Let's say at maybe nine or something like that. That's closer to four. Can't tell for sure what it feels like. Anyhow, the O2 flow is down. It's not leaking very much. I'm leaking about 0.3. Something like that.
1093141|CC|Okay. We're - we're showing 4.2 to 4.3 on our pressure spread, and you're cabin and suit pressure gages probably show something similar. And we show that the flow rate is down. -
1093154|CMP|Oh, okay. That's not too bad. That's pretty close.
1093157|CC|Yes. And the O2 flow is staying pretty good.
1093158|CMP|... let's go to DEPRESS on this thing, huh?
1093201|CC|Sounds good.
1093203|CMP|Okay; so it looks like it's sta - stable there, isn't it?
1093207|CC|Yes, sir.
1093213|CMP|Okay. Let's go to DEPRESS.
1093229|CMP|And my ears are pretty good. Of you guys are okay I'm going to go to OFF. Save a little time here.
1093302|CC|America, I don't know if I copied you correctly. You don't want to go to OFF on that SUIT TEST valve until the pressure are back down to normal. If that was what you asked.
1093314|CMP|(Laughter)
1093316|CDR|Hello, Houston.
1093317|CC|Are or you already there?
1093319|CMP|I changed ny mind.
1093319|CDR|That looked to be a pretty good alignment from where I saw it. There's 07 for you.
1093324|CC|Okay. We copy.
1093330|CMP|Yes. My ears are popping to beat the band - I changed my mind, I'll let it go down slowly.
1093335|CC|Okay.
1093338|CC|Okay. And we've got about 20 minutes before LOS, so there's no hurry on those pads. I've got them standing by when you're ready, and didn't know what you - what you had in mind about working on these things. We might get - you might get started on the hatch integrity check, if you get to that point, and I can give you the pads while you're waiting for it to bleed down or whatever it turns out to be convenient.
1093403|CC|Okay, Challenger. Torque them.
1093412|CMP|Okay. Let's see, I guess it's about time to - Integrity check; okay.
1093433|CC|Okay. And I guess the LM is going to be asking you for a NOUN 20 pretty soon like, here.
1093434|CDR|Hello, America; Challenger. We no longer need your MIN DEADBAND.
1093444|CMP|Okay, Challenger; America here. I'll go back to CMC.
1093448|CDR|Okay. But I would like a NOUN 20 from you on my mark.
1093452|CMP|Stand by. Okay, go.
1093458|CDR|Okay; 3, 2, 1 -
1093501|CDR|MARK.
1093503|CMP|Okay; 002.15, 104.36, 359.69.
1093521|CMP|Okay.
1093536|CC|Okay, Challenger, we've got the NOUN 20s, both spacecraft.
1093546|CMP|And Houston, do we want to release those docking latches before they do their hot fire? I don't think so. Do we?
1093554|CC|I'll check. Stand by.
1093622|CC|Challenger, Houston, we're ready anytime for the RCS pressurization. You might turn the data switch off.
1093622|CC|You're right, Ron, we'll - we'll just hold up on that release on the latches until the hot fires are over. So, when you get your copying hand ready, why, we'll give you some pads. We'll clean that one up.
1093633|CDR|We just got that, and we're going.
1093634|CC|Okay.
1093640|CMP|Okay. Let's see.
1093654|CMP|Reading 2 SCS. Integrity check - Okay, it didn't -
1093704|CDR|MASTER ARM is ON; I've got one good light - SYSTEM A.
1093708|CC|Okeydoke.
1093710|CMP|Okay, Houston. Let's see - where are we going to start on the pads?
1093713|CC|Okay. And you might go to BLOCK on the computer, too.
1093720|CMP|Okay.
1093720|CDR|Okay. On my mark; 3, 2, 1 -
1093724|CDR|MARK it. We heard it.
1093728|CC|Okay. The first thing I'll give you is the SEP pad.
1093735|CMP|Okay. Let's go.
1093735|CC|And that is on page 113.
1093742|CMP|Okay.
1093743|CC|Okay. NOUN 33 is 110:27:55.00. Roll is 0, 0, 105 pitch, and yaw is 0.
1093806|CMP|Okay. NOUN 33, 110:27:55.00, and roll, pitch, and yaw as depicted: 0, 105, and 0. Right?
1093806|CC|Okay, Challenger. We saw it, and it looks good. RCS looks good.
1093814|CDR|Looks good onboard, Gordo.
1093818|CC|That's affirm.
1093823|CMP|Okay; got it.
1093827|CC|Okay. The next thing I have for you is a P24 pad that goes on page 115.
1093838|CMP|Okay. SUIT TEST valves in OFF now. On page 115 - Okay; got it.
1093847|CC|Okay. It'll be 17-1; 110:58:13; T2 is 111:00:30; 01:00:01 - -
1093903|CDR|Okay, Houston. Verify high bit rate - and, Ron, we need you in WIDE DEADBAND ATTITUDE/HOLD.
1093907|LMP|Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
1093910|CMP|... hold it. Okay, WIDE DEADBAND  ATT/HOLD, that's what I'm on. And Amer - Houston; America, I missed T2 on.
1093922|CC|Challenger, we verify high bit rate.
1093926|CC|Okay. Are you ready to go back to it now?
1093931|CMP|Okay; ready for T2.
1093933|CC|All right, sir T2: 111:00:30; 01: - -
1093941|CDR|Okay. Here we go, Houston, with the cold fire check.
1093941|CC|- - 00; 01:26; Roll 015, 297, 000; North 02. Over.
1093943|CMP|Shoot!
1093944|CC|Okay. All set.
1094005|CMP|Okay. I'll read back what I have. T1 110:58:13. I missed T2. TCA is 01:00; is 01:26; Roll 15, pitch 297, and 0; North 02. I presume 17.1.
1094023|CC|Yes, sir. And T2 time is 111:00:30.
1094035|CMP|Okay. 111:00:30.
1094038|CC|That's correct.
1094040|CMP|Challenger said something every time you talked on that one.
1094042|CDR|Okay, Houston. PGNs RATE COMMAND (Cold Fire), AGS pulse (Cold Fire) check.
1094047|CC|Okay; press on.
1094049|CMP|Hey, Jack, could you go to RECEIVE only on the VHF for a little bit?
1094054|LMP|Sure, Ron.
1094055|CMP|Okay.
1094100|CMP|And, Houston; America. You can go ahead on the next pad.
1094103|CC|Okay. On page 113, I've got a DAP load for you.
1094116|CMP|Okay.
1094118|CC|Okay. The weight: 37983; plus 0.40, plus 0.91.
1094137|CMP|Okay, CSM weight is 37983; pak to off, plus 0.40; yak to off, plus 0.91.
1094149|CC|Okay. That's correct. And the last one comes up on page 121, and it's a LM P76.
1094159|CMP|Ah ha; okay.
1094202|LMP|All right, Houston. Step 4. AGS RATE COMMAND (Cold Fire), 4 JET SECONDARY COIL (Hot Fire) check.
1094204|CC|Okay, NOUN 33.
1094206|CMP|Okay,  121 - Got it.
1094208|CC|Okay. Go. We're looking good so far.
1094210|CC|All right, sir. 112:02:51.92; minus -
1094210|LMP|Hey, Ron. We're going to have some hot fires here. We're going to have some hot fires here in a minute.
1094215|CMP|Okay. Wait a min - Hold it. America, ... Challenger. The hot fire - you want FREE, Challenger?
1094225|LMP|That's affirm. Go CMC MODE FREE.
1094230|CMP|Challenger, America. You want FREE for the hot fire?
1094235|CDR|That is affirm. We want you FREE, Ron.
1094238|CMP|Okay. Going to FREE now.
1094244|CMP|And, Houston; America. You can try that one again.
1094247|CC|All righty. NOUN 33 is 112:02:51.92; minus 0007.5 and all zips for Y and Z.
1094253|CDR|Ron, go RECEIVE ONLY.
1094308|CMP|(Laughter). Okay, say that NOUN 33 again.
1094327|CMP|Houston, America. We're cut out on NOUN 33 again, and I've got minus 0007.5 and X, Y, and Z are 0.
1094340|CC|Okay. And the time, 112:02:51.92.
1094345|CDR|Houston, hardover looked good from here.
1094349|CC|Okay; looked good down here.
1094350|CMP|Okay, NOUN 33 is 112:02:51 - 112:02:51.92.
1094353|LMP|All right, Houston. PGNS MINIMUM IMPULSE (Hot Fire) check.
1094358|CC|Okay.
1094403|CC|That's correct.
1094422|LMP|Okay, Houston. We had a sticky talkback red on SYSTEM A, QUAD 4. And it went to gray with a tap.
1094435|CC|Okay, Jack.
1094603|CDR|Okay - Ron, the hot fire checks are complete. You can go into WIDE DEADBAND ATT/HOLD.
1094611|CMP|Okay, Challenger; America. ... get that far off that time either.
1094616|CC|Challenger, those all look good here.
1094618|CDR|And I think we got them all.
1094619|CMP|Okay.
1094621|CDR|Okay, Gordo. Understand.
1094649|CDR|Okay. We're on the top of 3-28, Gordo.
1094650|CC|Roger. We're with you.
1094709|CMP|Okay, Challenger; America.
1094717|CDR|Go - go ahead, Ron.
1094718|CMP|Okay. I'm going to turn off B3 and also my roll jets, and then I'm going to undo the docking latches.
1094725|LMP|Okay, you want to verify your - your transponder is OFF as well as B3?
1094730|CMP|That's - verified TRANSPONDER is OFF.
1094732|CDR|Okay. And you did get the umbilicals. Right?
1094736|CMP|Say again about umbilicals.
1094737|CDR|You did get the LM-to-CM umbilicals, right?
1094741|CDR|All I get is umbilicals. I didn't get the question.
1094745|CDR|Did you disconnect the LM-to-CM umbilicals? Verify.
1094750|CMP|Verify. I have those down here.
1094752|CDR|Okay. Very good.
1094803|CMP|And jet Bravo 3 is OFF.
1094814|CC|Okay, Ron, we're about 5 minutes from LOS. And the only thing that you wouldn't be able to do following right down your checklist is to get the VHF data on and check the tape recorder at LOS. The rest of that stuff you can follow right on through, and we'll remind you on the lithium change after descent. So it looks like we're caught up again.
1094818|CC|Challenger, Houston. We cannot completely explain the startup indications you had on the PGNS, but they are of no great concern. It looks good so far. The DAP gimbal trims are no problem. Don't bother changing them. And there will be no PIPA bias update yet, anyway. Over.
1094839|CDR|Okay. Understand. Was the checklist written backwards on that?
1094846|CC|It was a Cape problem on their tape, and they had it reversed. But it's in the noise level, anyway. No problem.
1094855|CDR|Okay.
1094938|CC|Challenger, Houston. You have a GO for undocking and sep.
1094944|CDR|Roger; understand. A GO for undocking and sep.
1095020|CMP|Okay, number 5. One , two - and it's fully released, and the hook is off of the docking ring. Okay. Number 6 is - one, two - and it's fully released, and the hook is off of the docking ring. Okay, 7 is released, and the hook is off of the docking ring. O2 flow still okay?
1095059|CC|Yes, sir. Looking good.
1095104|CMP|Okay, here's number 8. Here's one, two. And the chute's fully released, and the hook is off the docking ring.
1095122|CMP|Okay, here's number 9. One, two, and she's fully released; the hook clears the docking ring. Okay, number 10. Here's one, two - fully released, and the hook clears the docking ring. There's one ... 11. Okay, handle's free; J-hook clears the ring. I've only got one more to go. There's the first latch there's two latches ... came over. And the hook stays clear; the handle is free. And, by golly, they're all off. Hey, Challenger; America. You're hanging on those three little bitty things.
1095235|CDR|Okay. Fine, Ron.
1095237|CMP|Okay. I put the old - hatch in.
1095238|CC|Challenger, Houston. About 1 minute to LOS, and we'll see you when you come around the other side, independently.
1095248|CDR|Okay, Gordo; understand. I'm in step 4, RENDEZVOUS RADAR mode ... to AUTO.
1095249|CC|Okay, Ron, we're within a minute of LOS. Your O2 flow still looks good, and the rest of the stuff that you can get on the VHF is going to be just fine. You're right on schedule now.
1095253|CC|Roger.
1095300|CDR|And the radar has come out, and I'm in RADAR TEST now.
1095305|CMP|Okay. I'll get that VHF stuff and then put the hatch in.
1095308|CC|Jack, just a friendly reminder to do the LOS procedures on the steerable.
1095318|LMP|Okay.
1095322|CMP|Okay, we're in RECEIVE ONLY to B DATA. Hey, Challenger; America. I'm going to RECEIVE ONLY the B DATA.
1095338|CMP|Hey, Challenger; America.
1095348||BEGIN LUNAR REV 12
1095348|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had Loss of Signal as America and Challenger pass behind the Moon on the - toward the end of the 11th Lunar Orbit. When they reappear again, in approximately 47 minutes, they will be undocked. Stationkeeping, flying along adjacent to each other. At Loss of Signal the orbit measured 61.2 nautical miles pericynthion by 12 miles even nautical - pericynthion. Velocity at that time was 5,313 feet per second. During the next frontside pass, as the Challenger continues in preparations for the Descent Orbit Insertion, we'll have a checkout of the descent propulsion system. The tanks will be pressurized and telemetry readouts here on the ground will be prepared to those onboard, to make sure that system is preforming as advertised. An alignment - a realignment of the inertial measuring unit, part of the lunar module's guidance system will be run during that - also during that frontside pass. And toward the end of the 12th revolution, just prior to Loss of Signal the crew aboard Challanger will be given a GO/NO-GO for the Descent Orbit Insertion Maneuver number 2, which is at this time still scheduled for a Ground Elapsed Time of 112 hours 1 minute 59 seconds. There's a carton of book matches on top of the flight director console here in the Control Center which was bought by a group of flight dynamics officers on all the ships. Bill Boone, Jay Green, Jerry Bostick and others. It's a blue match cover, it says The Trench. Traditionally the trench is the front row here in the Control Center where the flight dynamics people operate. It says on the front, "The Trench, Mission Control Center, Houston." On the reverse of the match book it says, "Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Skylab, Apollo Soyuz Test Program Shuttle." Mercury, Gemini and Apollo have a check by them indicating they're complete. And at the bottom it says, "roll them out, we're ready." At 109:57, up live at next Acquisition of Signal as America and Challenger come around on the 12th revolution, this is Apollo Control.
1103918|PAO|This is Apollo Control. 110 hours, 39 minutes Ground Elapsed Time in the mission of Apollo 17. Less than 2 minutes remaining now until America and Challenger, separated and flying a few feet apart at this time will come around the front side of the Moon on the 12th lunar orbit. Slightly over a minute now until we should start attempting to lock up on the downlink signal from America and Challenger. The two way communications from spacecraft communicator for the command-service module, Ken Mattingly, and Ron Evans aboard America will be on a separate loop as it was the last revolution. These conversations can be heard in room 161 in the Houston News Center. Early in this revolution we'll have the pressurization of the descent propulsion system and checkout of that system. Some 6 - 5 seconds from acquisition we'll stand by until Network advises the Flight Director that they do have firm lock-on. We have AOS in lunar module, let's see what we hear.
1104134|CDR|Hello, Houston. ... Challenger ...? Hello, Houston. ... Challenger ...?
1104158|CC|Hello, Challenger; Houston. You're very, very weak. Over.
1104204|CDR|Okay, Houston. Challenger ... checkout is complete ... and we're looking at America, the beautiful.
1104217|CC|Okay, Geno, I understand you're undocked. But we're not reading, but about 10 percent of what you're saying. Standby ...
1104249|CC|America, Houston; standing by.
1104255|CMP|Okay, Houston. This is America. We're floating free out here. The Challenger looks real pretty. The residuals on the P41 were plus 1.9, minus 0.2, and 0. Undock and sep was on time.
1104317|CC|Sounds good.
1104319|LMP|Houston, this is Challenger. Won't hold on the steerable antenna yet. It looks like I'm getting oscillations in my up-link signal strength, and then it gradually drops off to zero.
1104335|CC|Okay, Jack. We're reading you better now. Understand.
1104344|CDR|Okay, Gordo. If you're reading, you got the words. We are undocked. Landing radar self test is GO. We're ready to press on to the DPS throttle check, and we've been looking at America, the beautiful. It's rare form.
1104400|CC|Okay, Geno. We've got that. It sounds good.
1104405|CDR|Okay, and the residuals on P47 at undocking were 0, minus 0.1, and 0.
1104414|CC|Okay. We copy that. We'd like you to try the steerable again.
1104435|LMP|Okay, Houston; we've got it.
1104438|CC|Okay. You sound real good; loud and clear.
1104442|LMP|Okay, let me give you some NOUN 20 angles, if you want them.
1104445|CC|Go ahead. Ready to copy.
1104449|LMP|The LM: plus 301.09, plus 284.53, plus 359.48; the CSM: plus three zeros .35, plus 104.67, plus 000.52; the time: 110:24:00. Over.
1104520|CC|Okay, Jack. We got that.
1104525|CDR|Okay, Gordo; we're ready. DPS throttle check. I'm ready to hit ENGINE STOP.
1104530|CC|Stand by. Okay; we're ready.
1104539|CDR|Okay. And the light is on. The REG light is ON.
1104551|CC|Roger. We're showing the ENGINE ARM circuit breaker may be out. Would you check that?
1104617|LMP|Okay. I'm sorry, Gordy. A little - We missed that here. Okay, we'll try it again.
1104630|CC|America, Houston. When you have an opportunity, how about cycling the HIGH GAIN to WIDE and back to REACQ?
1104644|CMP|Okay, Can do.
1104646|CC|Thank you, sir.
1104716|CC|Okay, America. How about going back to NARROW on the antenna. And could you verify what you loaded on NOUN 34? it went by so fast on the down-link, we didn't get it a chance to look at it.
1104721|CDR|Gordy, if the throttle test looked okay, I'll go ENGINE ARM OFF.
1104726|CC|Okay. It looked real good. Go ahead.
1104743|CMP|There, you got it?
1104752|CC|Okay. That looks good.
1104753|CMP|Does that look okay?
1104754|CC|Yes, sir. Sure does.
1104758|CMP|Okay. No update then, huh?
1104800|CC|That's correct.
1104804|CMP|Okay.
1104922|CDR|Okay, Gordy, the MASTER ARM is coming on.
1104925|CC|Roger.
1104928|CDR|I got two good lights.
1104930|CC|Two lights.
1104936|CDR|Okay; on my mark. DESCENT PROP isOL VALVE. 3, 2, 1 -
1104940|CDR|MARK it. We heard it.
1104944|CC|Roger.
1104951|CC|Okay; looks good.
1104952|LMP|Gordy, there was a slight upward - Gordy, there was an upward fluctuation in pressure in the manifold when we fired that. It's back to where it was prefiring.
1105005|CC|Okay. That's what it should have done, Jack.
1105024|LMP|Okay, HELIUM PRESS, DESCENT START. 3, 2, 1 -
1105029|LMP|MARK it. We got it.
1105043|LMP|Okay; looks good onboard. About 240 both sides.
1105049|CC|Okay; looks good on the ground.
1105059|CDR|Say, Gordy, this thing sounds a little bit like my stomach sounded a couple of days ago.
1105106|CC|Roger that.
1105124|LMP|AGS coming on to STANDBY.
1105142|LMP|Okay. MASTER ALARM and AGS light.
1105206|LMP|Okay, 10 ... 110:52:00 for the time on the AGS.
1105214|CC|Roger, Jack.
1105247|CC|Geno, we show Jack's SUIT isOL valve in SUIT DISCONNECT. Should be in SUIT FLOW. Would you check that for - for us, please?
1105258|CDR|Yes. He's in SUIT FLOW now.
1105301|CC|Okay. Thank you.
1105304|CDR|I'll tell you - I'll tell you, this LCG sure makes a world of difference up here.
1105310|CC|Roger.
1105319|CDR|Hey, America; Challenger.
1105331|CDR|Hey, Ron; listen. This ridge you're coming on over - just stick your hand out the hatch and grab a rock.
1105335|CMP|Looks like it's pretty low down there.
1105339|CDR|Well, when you're up here looking at where you are, it even looks lower.
1105343|CMP|(Laughter) I'll bet.
1105652|CC|Challenger; Houston. I have a new AGS K factor for you.
1105658|LMP|Stand by a second.
1105742|LMP|Go with the K factor.
1105744|CC|Okay; it's 109:59:59.94. Over.
1105759|LMP|109:59:59.94.
1105804|CC|That's right.
1105806|CDR|Gordo, this is spectacular. It is absolutely spectacular looking at that command module, America, down there coming across the surface. We're just tracking him at about a 30-degree dive angle.
1105820|CC|Sounds great.
1105830|CDR|Okay, babe; have a good time, and go get that landmark. Don't forget - No TEIs. See you in about 3 days.
1105927|CC|Geno, Houston, with a couple of items.
1105934|LMP|Go ahead, Gordo.
1105936|CC|Okay. Your perilune seems to be - -
1105938|CDR|Hey, we got the landing site, Gordo.
1105942|CC|Okay. I'll hold - -
1105942|CDR|Gordo, we got the landing site. We're coming right over the front of it. Stand by a minute. You can see the Slide. I think you can see the Great Cross.
1105954|CC|Roger.
1105957|CDR|We'll get a picture of America coming right across it.
1110000|CC|All righty.
1110004|LMP|Super targeting.
1110006|CDR|Gosh, we've got Family Mountain; we've got - of course - the Massif; we can see the Scarp; we can see the light mantle; I've got the Great Cross, Camelot, Sherlock.
1110019|LMP|Believe it or not, Houston, they're all there.
1110023|CC|How about that.
1110024|LMP|I see possible structure - possible structure in the upper part of the South Massif, little bit east of Station 2. It's subhorizontal, dipping to the southeast.
1110040|CDR|Houston, I can even see Poppy, right where we're going to set this baby down.
1110045|CC|Very good.
1110047|CDR|As a matter of fact, I can see Rudolph. I can even see the triangle: Rudolph, Frosty, and Punk. Man, Gordo, this is absolutely spectacular.
1110109|CC|Sure sounds like it.
1110111|CDR|We can watch Ron track - we can watch Ron track right on through the landmarks. I don't know what kind of results he got, but he sure had a nice smooth track from here.
1110125|CC|Roger.
1110137|LMP|Gordo, you can go ahead and update us with those words.
1110140|CC|Okay. Your perilune is shifting west. PDI will be a little higher than nominal: 10.7 miles or 65,000 feet; should be no problem. And, from the time you first came around until we had a solid lockup on the steerable on this acquisition was about 3 minutes. We're going to try to speed that up some on the next time around. We'd like you to just keep trying the steerable until we come to you - and say, "stop trying." Over.
1110213|LMP|Okay, Gordy, understand that; and apparently this time, had I let it - had I waited a little longer, it would have dropped to zero and then come up, because that's what happened when I finally got you. I'll give it more time next time.
1110228|CC|Okay.
1110238|CC|And, Jack, I've got lots of pads for you whenever you're ready.
1110337|LMP|Okay, Gordy; go with the pads.
1110339|CC|Okay. The first one is a P76 with a CSM circ.
1110349|LMP|Go.
1110351|CC|Okay. NOUN 33 is 111:57:30.09; NOUN 84: plus 0070.5, plus five zeros, and minus 0000.5. Go ahead.
1110426|LMP|Okay. 111:57:30.09; plus 0070.5, plus all zeros, minus four zeros 5.
1110437|CC|Okay. Good readback. Next one I have is the no PDI plus 12 abort, item Echo.
1110446|LMP|Go ahead.
1110447|CC|Okay. Echo is 113:02:00.00; Foxtrot, plus 0103.4, plus five zeros, minus 0050.0; NOUN 42: 0142.0, plus 0005.4, 0114.9; burn time is 0:48; 000, 272; 373 - -
1110543|CDR|Okay. Just a second. Give me a transponder, and we'll start with the radar. Jack's tied up right now.
1110550|CC|373 is 0182.0; AGS DELTA-Vs: plus 0103.7, plus five zeros, minus 0049.3; Golf, 113:57:00.00; Hotel, 11 - I'll start over - 115:36:45.00; and the no DOI-2 DELTA-Vx., 0096.6. Two remarks: throttle profile is 10 percent for 26 seconds, 40 percent for the rest of the burn. Over.
1110714|LMP|Okay, readback. 11 - no PDI plus 12 - 113:02 all zeros; plus 0103.4, plus all zeros, minus 0050.0; 0142.0, plus three zeros 5.4, 0114.9; 0:48; all zeros, 272; 0182.0; plus 0103.7, plus all zeros, minus 0049-3; 113:57 all zeros; 115:36:45.00; 0096.6; remarks: throttle profile 10 percent for 26 seconds; 40 percent for the remainder.
1110806|CC|Okay, that's a good readback. Item India: 112:49:52.35 - -
1110819|CDR|Say, Gordo.
1110820|CC|Go ahead.
1110821|CDR|Gordo, Gordo. Hey, Gordo; stand by. We want to finish the radar VHF test; and when I go to P52, you can finish the PADs.
1110829|CC|Okay.
1110845|CDR|Okay. We're in VHF RANGING, and I've got you on radar, Ron. We'll be quiet for a second and see if you can get a lockon.
1110907|CMP|Ah-ha! it works! Point - 0.50 miles.
1110909|CDR|Okay.
1110916|CMP|Okay, 0.50 or 0.49 miles.
1110934|CDR|Okay, Gordo. The VHF ranging and radar checks out very well.
1110940|CC|Okay, sounds good. Tell me when you're ready for item India again.
1111002|LMP|We cut you off, Ron.
1111005|CMP|Okay, I'm going to turn the RANGING, OFF, then. Comm's a little better that way.
1111010|LMP|Go ahead, Gordy.
1111011|CC|Okay. India is 112:49:52.35; 11:01, plus 0002.2; attitude is 002, 108, 290; plus 56900, Juliett: 115:36:45.00; Kilo: 117:35:45.00. Go ahead.
1111113|IMP|Okay. It's a PDI pad; 112:49:52.35; 11:01, plus three zeros 2.2; 002, 108, 290; plus 56900; Juliett, 115:36:45.00; Karen, 117:35:45.00. Go ahead.
1111144|CC|Okay, that's a good readback. Lima is 113:14:24.91; Maytro, 119:34:30.00; and November is 114:57:19.09; And your T-2 at PDI - T-2 will be at PDI plus 24:33.
1111238|LMP|24:33?
1111240|CC|That's affirmative.
1111248|LMP|Okay, Linda is 113:14:24.91; Mary is 119:34:30.00, and Nancy is 114:57:19.09.
1111305|CC|That's a good readback.
1111315|CC|Okay, one thing left, Jack, is the SHe pressures on the PDI page.
1111328|LMP|Go ahead.
1111330|CC|Okay; at Tig., the pressure will be 1310; plus 1 minute, 1410; 2 minutes, 1400; 3 minutes, 1310; and 4 minutes, 1230. Over.
1111359|LMP|Okay, I got those. Thank you.
1111401|CC|Roger.
1112124|CMP-CM|You're loud and clear.
1112456|LMP|Roger, America. Have a good burn. You look just as pretty in earthlight as you do in sunlight.
1112535|CC|We see that. Looks like a good job.
1112545|LMP|Yes, but it's not an easy one, Gordo.
1112558|CMP|- to RECEIVE only. Hey, Challenger; America.
1112604|LMP|Go ahead.
1112605|CMP|Okay, Jack, can you go to RECEIVE only on your VHF there? I've got all these pads to pick up now. I'll call you when - when I'm all through.
1112615|LMP|Okay, RECEIVE only. We got your GO, Gordo?
1112619|CC|That's affirmative, torque them.
1112728|CC|Challenger, we need AFT OMNI and select the steerable to SLEW. And LOW bit rate.
1112812|CC|Challenger, select FORWARD OMNI, please.
1112900|LMP|Okay, Gordo, the COAS alignment's good and the DAP is retracking.
1112905|CC|Okay, and like the rest of the spacecraft, the platform's beautiful, there's no drift compensation or PIPA bias update. Over.
1112917|LMP|Beautiful. It's ... kind of like a ...
1112931|CC|Want to give you one update, you can write it in the Timeline, page 8; the T-1 time is PDI plus 17:00. Over.
1112951|CDR|Okay; T-1 is PDI plus 17:00, we got it.
1112955|CC|Roger.
1113029|LMP|Okay, Houston, you got P00 and DATA.
1113033|CC|Okay.
1113135|LMP|Gordo, can I start maneuvering to the AGS cal while you're getting those updates - up-links ready?
1113145|CC|Okay, we'd like the steerable back again. Try PITCH of minus 25, and YAW of minus 72.
1113224|LMP|Okay; you got the steerable.
1113227|CC|Okay, we need HIGH bit rate.
1113248|CC|If we start on the up-links now, we'll get that in before we go to the AGS cal attitude. Over.
1113257|LMP|Okay, Gordo, I've got - I've got the Earth and the direction I have to maneuver is nothing but good for the high gain, so I'll start over slowly.
1113306|CC|Okay.
1113559|CC|Challenger, Houston. It's your computer. Up-data link off.
1113611|LMP|Roger.
1113631|LMP|Still with you.
1113635|CMP|Okay, I got something like "yup".
1113652|LMP|Say again, Ron.
1113654|CMP|Okay, I just wanted to make sure - voice check if we still have the VHF comm.
1113659|LMP|Okay, I'll have to give you another one here in a minute.
1113721|LMP|Okay, how do you read?
1113724|CMP|Okay; loud and clear. How me Jack?
1113733|CMP|Challenger, America. Read you loud and clear. How me?
1113757|CC|Okay, America, we show you inside of 20 minutes, saying you have a GO for circ.
1113806|CMP|Houston, America. Roger. We'll do our best.
1114218|CC|Challenger, Houston. You're GO for DOI-2.
1114224|LMP|Thank you, Gordo, We're GO here for DOI-2.
1114548|LMP|Okay, Houston, did you get the AGS cal numbers?
1114554|CC|Challenger, that's affirmative.
1114559|LMP|Okay, it all looks pretty good to me. 546 may have been a little more than specs, but it looks pretty good.
1114609|CC|Okay, looks good here.
1114627|CC|Jack, have you gone through an OMNI? If you have, go LOW BIT RATE.
1114645|LMP|Okay, We've got you on an OMNI and LOW BIT, RA -
1114652|CC|Okay.
1114804||BEGIN LUNAR REV 13
1114804|PAO|This is Apollo Control, we've had loss of signal as America and Challenger coasting along near-by each other, passed behind the Moon on revolution number 12. Some 47 minutes until they come back around again, on the 13th lunar revolution. Behind the Moon this time, the command/service module, piloted by Ron Evans, will do CSM circularization maneuver which will place the spacecraft back up into an almost circular lunar orbit, measuring 69.7 by 54.5, those are the targeted measurements of that orbit. Ignition time, again which will be behind the Moon and out of contact is Ground Elapsed Time of 111:57:28. The lunar module DOI, or Descent Orbit Insertion burn number 2 also will be behind the Moon before we reacquire the spacecraft. That is scheduled for 112 hours 2 minutes 40 seconds. It's a fairly small burn 7.6 feet per second which will lower the pericynthion of the Challenger down to 6-1/2 miles - nautical miles with apocynthion staying at 61.5 nautical miles. During the next front side pass, comes the moment of truth with powered descent, and touchdown at Taurus-Littrow landing site as Challenger lights off the big descent engine at 112 hours 49 minutes, 52 seconds Ground Elapsed Time. The ignition countdown clock in the control center is counting down to PDI some 59 minutes 17 - 16 seconds until ignition with landing shortly under 12 minutes later, depending on the amount of hover time available. The broadcast line will be brought up again just prior to acquisition of signal as America and Challenger come around on the front side again on revolution 13, and at 111 hours 51 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
1123334|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 112 hours 33 minutes Ground Elapsed Time in the mission of Apollo 17. Coming up on acquisition of signal of both spacecraft, America and Challenger, coming from behind the moon on the 13th lunar orbit. Some 1 minute 32 seconds away from acquisition of the command module and slightly under three minutes on the lunar module, Challenger. Challenger, during this revolution will descend to the surface of the moon and land at the Taurus-Littrow landing site. Ignition time currently is Ground Elapsed Time of 112 hours 49 minutes 52 seconds. During the descent to the surface the spacecraft onboard computer will be generating numbers on the display which the Lunar Module Pilot will call out to the commander and which - angles at which the commander should be able to see the landing site through a grid etched on the left hand window of the lunar module. Here, we have AOS. AOS of the command service module and the circulars - the circularization burn was good. This is Apollo Control on the air-ground 2 circuit. Command module pilot, Ron Evans, is giving the CAPCOM all of the residuals. Here comes Challenger. Back to the lunar landing sequence as the lunar module pilot reads out the angles that the commander ought to be able to see the landing site. The commander is able to run through an operation called redesignation by using a pitch hand controller to rotate the spacecraft.
1123613|LMP|Hello, Houston. How do you read Challenger?
1123613|CC|Challenger, you're loud and clear.
1123613|LMP|Hello, Houston. How do you read Challenger on an OMNI right now?
1123703|CC|Okay, Challenger, you're loud and clear on the OMNI. How did it go?
1123712|LMP|Okay, The burn was GO. We're in a 7-mile perigee on the PGNS, and we had 0, plus 0.1 and plus 0.1 residuals.
1123721|CC|Okay, sounds good.
1123725|LMP|Ok - Okay, Gordy, I'm going to try the high gain I had you locked up once, and then I lost you. Let me try it again.
1123732|CC|We concur. Go ahead, Jack.
1123801|LMP|Okay, Gordy, that's my fault. I didn't know you were up-linking. You've got the OMNI, and I'll leave it.
1123807|CC|Okay, we'll stay on the OMNI for the up-link.
1123852|LMP|Okay, Gordy, ED BATs are 37.2, both batteries. The ascent battery ON time was 112:19:00, about 4 minutes late.
1123906|CC|Okay, Jack. Copy.
1123911|CC|Jack, we want BATTERY 3 OFF for preconditioning.
1123919|LMP|Roger.
1123930|CC|Challenger, we'd like you to verify that the - -
1123931|LMP|And we did ..., Gordy.
1123933|CC|... is egress.
1123941|LMP|That's verified.
1123944|CC|Roger.
1123955|LMP|And do you have a 231 update?
1123959|CC|Stand by. Negative. No change, Jack.
1124014|LMP|Roger.
1124015|CDR|Okay, Gordo, how do you read CDR on VOX?
1124018|CC|CDR, you're loud and clear on VOX.
1124023|LMP|Okay. How do you read the LMP on VOX?
1124026|CC|Loud and clear, Jack.
1124033|CDR|Okay. Gordo, up until this time, the bird has looked beautiful - perfectly plain. All the check's have come out just as advertised.
1124044|CC|Okay, sounds good.
1124048|LMP|And we're looking at 9 minutes and 5 seconds from PDI.
1124055|CC|Challenger, do you see a VERB 33 out of DSKY? If you do, ENTER it.
1124103|LMP|Okay, it's there, and I will ENTER.
1124105|CC|Roger.
1124105|LMP|Okay, it took; and I'm showing P00.
1124110|CC|Okay. your computer; the up-link's in.
1124120|LMP|Okay, we've got a tone on the up-voice backup.
1124126|CC|Roger.
1124127|CDR|VERB 47 coming in at you, Jack. Okay, hit it. Okay, I got it. 240 - wait - 231, 569, 00, that's supposed to be. Okay, 569, 00 ... 240s are the same - 569, 00.
1124216|LMP|Okay.
1124219|CDR|Okay, 254 is plus 01944.
1124225|LMP|Okay.
1124226|CDR|Okay, 262 is minus 00143. Okay, 400 plus 3, and I'll watch it.
1124241|LMP|How's it look?
1124244|LMP|It's - it's had that all the way along - a little bit of roll bias.
1124245|CDR|Okay. That's good. 400 plus 1.
1124253|LMP|400 plus 1 is in.
1124254|CDR|Okay, and we do have your needle. We do have your needle.
1124258|LMP|Okay.
1124259|CDR|Okay, and there's VERB 83 looking at you.
1124303|LMP|My CROSSPOINTERS are LOW MULT for you.
1124306|CDR|Okay, and there's VERB 83. Give me a 317 and a 440.
1124310|CC|Challenger, Houston. We'd like you to try the high gain once more. PITCH is minus - PITCH is zero and YAW plus 59.
1124324|CDR|Are you happy with this, Jack? Let me ... 63.
1124328|LMP|Yes. Go ahead.
1124329|CDR|Okay.
1124329|LMP|That's good.
1124332|CDR|Gordy, understand no NOUN 68 prior to P63 or NOUN 69, right?
1124338|CC|That's affirmative.
1124344|LMP|... you need to ask him anything, I'll try the high gain.
1124346|CDR|No. Go ahead; try it.
1124347|LMP|Try the high gain, Gordy.
1124350|CC|Okay.
1124352|LMP|Okay, it's locked up in AUTO.
1124355|CC|Roger.
1124401|LMP|And, Gordy, be advised that you're clipping on your first word.
1124407|CC|Okay, Jack. We'd like you to set 410 in the AGS to all balls. Plus all balls.
1124419|LMP|That's 410, 410 not 400. Check that again.
1124426|CC|That's affirmative; 410.
1124433|LMP|Thank you, Gordy.
1124434|CDR|You better go back and check 400 now.
1124438|LMP|It's okay. I fixed it.
1124440|CDR|Okay.
1124446|LMP|Oh, man, are we down among them, babe! Whooh! ...
1124449|CC|Challenger, Houston. I have a PDI Tig update. It's 112:49:51.87. And NOUN 61 cross range should be a plus 2.8. Over.
1124510|LMP|Okay. Say the seconds again on the PDI.
1124513|CC|PDI seconds are 51.87. Over.
1124521|LMP|Okay. And the cross range?
1124524|CC|Cross range is - is a plus 2.8. Over.
1124533|LMP|Okay, Gordy. That clock checks with - with our time out of P63. The LANDING RADAR breaker's IN, I've got altitude, velocity, power. We're coming up on 4 minutes.
1124548|CDR|I'll give you the final trim at 4.
1124549|LMP|Okay.

1124616|CDR|Hello, America. Do you read Challenger?
1124626|CMP|Yes, that's a good point, I'll go ahead and get it.
1124631|CDR|Hey, Jack, you can check your watch.
1124636|LMP|Okay.
1124637|CDR|At 2 minutes, I'll get the MASTER ARM.
1124639|LMP|All right.
1124640|CDR|30 seconds, I'll get the ENGINE ARM; and we'll watch the PGNS tapemeter pick up average G. If you give me a GO on the ullage, I'll back up the ullage.
1124651|LMP|Okay.
1124652|CDR|And I'll back up the START.
1124655|CC|Challenger, should we lose the steerable, - -

1130219|LMP|Okay, Parker valves - Boy, you bet it is, Gordo.
1130228|CDR|Boy, when you said shut down, I shut down and we dropped, didn't we?
1130231|LMP|Yes, sir. But we is here; man, is we here. How does that look?
1130236|CDR|That looks good.
1130236|LMP|Pressure - pressures look great. Tank 2 is down just a little from before.
1130241|CDR|The ENGINE OVERRIDE is OFF ... --
1130242|LMP|Manifold is great. Manifold is right on. Get - go to JETS.
1130246|CDR|Okay. I am JETS.
1130248|LMP|Okay. That side's complete.
1130250|CDR|Houston, you can tell America that Challenger is at Taurus-Littrow.
1130255|CC|We'll do it.
1130300|CMP|Great.
1130302|CDR|Ron, I had the meatball all the way.
1130304|CMP|Beautiful.
1130307|CDR|Jack, are we going to have some nice boulders in this area.
1130309|LMP|Okay. The old camera's off.
1130312|CDR|Okay.
1130315|LMP|LANDING RADAR breaker, OPEN. Checking the water. And, Gordy, ascent tank 1, we started out a little low. It's still - same place. That's water.
1130330|CC|Roger, Jack.
1130330|LMP|Batteries look good.
1130338|LMP|Oh, man. Look at that rock out there.
1130342|CDR|Absolutely incredible. Absolutely incredible.
1130347|LMP|I think I can see the rim of Camelot.
1130350|CC|Roger.
1130350|CDR|Epic moment of my life.
1130351|LMP|Where'd you land? You never let me look outside at all. Hey, you can see the boulder tracks.
1130401|CDR|Okay, Gordy. We're standing by for your GO. We look good - we're looking good onboard.
1130406|CC|Okay. You're looking great here so far.
1130407|CDR|There are boulders all over those massifs. God, look at that propellant. We could have gone all around and looked around.
1130415|LMP|We should have hovered around a little bit; gone and looked at the Scarp.
1130418|CDR|No, thank you.
1130419|LMP|(Laughter)
1130419|CDR|I like it right where we are.
1130421|CDR|Okay, Gordy. While you're - while you're waiting on that GO, I had to - I - I shot for a spot, around 2 o'clock from Poppy. There's a number of boulders out at 12 o'clock from Poppy, and I really think I'm probably not more than about 100 meters out in front of it - and slightly to the north. Actually, I may be a little bit closer to Trident than I expected Poppy to be. I - I think I've got Trident right out the left window. And our first cut at the mobility around here in the Rover. It ought to be super.
1130456|CC|Okay. Sounds good.
1130503|CDR|And I tell you, the massifs and Bare Mountain are two different products.
1130513|LMP|Sure look it, don't they? Of course, they're different slopes, too.
1130516|CDR|I think you're looking - probably - that may be Rudolph, right there, Jack, out your window. I was looking more at those boulders and trying to stay in the spots in between them them I was - -
1130528|LMP|Yes, you did great, Gene.
1130529|CDR|- - relationship to that crater.
1130530|LMP|Man, there was practically no dust, just a little bit of a film; you had the ground, all the way to the ground.
1130536|CDR|Yes. I could call touchdown on the shadow. Look at that. Really here.
1130543|LMP|(Laughter)
1130546|CDR|Okay, Gordy. We're hanging in for your GO. It better be a GO. I'll check everything again. Let's just doublecheck.
1130554|LMP|Okay. That hasn't changed.
1130557|CDR|Okay, that's good.
1130558|LMP|Those - the manifold hasn't changed. The RCS hasn't changed. Ascent water hasn't changed. The batteries haven't changed.
1130610|CDR|Oh, my golly.
1130611|LMP|Only we have changed.
1130613|CDR|You know the - you can't see into Camelot, Jack; that rim is - is Camelot out in front of us.
1130618|LMP|Yes.
1130618|CDR|You ... - -
1130618|CC|Challenger, you'll be glad to hear you're STAY for T-1.
1130624|CC|And, America; we have a STAY for T-1.
1130624|CDR|Gordy, you're a smooth talker, you know it?
1130626|LMP|Very good.
1130628|CDR|We are STAY for T-1.
1130630|LMP|Okay. You can forget all I told you about VERB 22 NOUN 46.
1130631|CMP|Challenger - understand a STAY for T-1. Good.
1130634|LMP|What was that? (Laughter)
1130639|CDR|Okay. Let's find out where we are. Engine stop is reset.
1130645|LMP|Okay. The AGS is ready for us if we need it.
1130647|CDR|Okay. I need a P12 time as soon as I get 60 - -
1130649|LMP|Okay.
1130704|CDR|Okay, Gordy. You're looking at NOUN 43. Copy that down, Jack, right here.
1130711|CC|Okay. We've got it.
1130713|CDR|20 21 and 20 21 and 30 75, and I'm going to P12. Okay. I need a P12 time from you.
1130730|LMP|Okay.
1130731|CDR|For T-2.
1130733|LMP|For T-2, the time is 113 - -
1130738|CDR|Okay.

1130741|LMP|24.91.
1130744|CDR|4.91.
1130746|LMP|Yes, sir.
1130748|CDR|I can't feel any difference between 1/6g and anything else right now.
1130750|LMP|Well, you still got your restraints on. (Laughter)
1130753|CDR|Okay. 113:14:24.91. You happy with that?
1130757|LMP|That looks good, sir.
1130759|CDR|Okay. I got to change these numbers. You didn't get an update on NOUN 76, did you? I don't think so.
1130813|LMP|No. No. No.
1130813|CDR|Okay.
1130819|CDR|Okay; 5515. Hello, Gordy. How would you like me to handle R-3 of NOUN 76?
1130828|CC|Stand by. I'll come back to you.
1130833|CDR|Okay. Oh, that radar performed super.
1130843|LMP|How was the view on the way down, Gene? (Laughter)
1130845|CDR|You know, after we pitched over, I was just looking for a place to land. I'm not sure, I just didn't want to hit one of those boulders out there which would have been as easy - and look at that. Look at right in front of us. I didn't want to land there either.
1130858|LMP|I see that one right in front of us.
1130859|CDR|You see that? ... a boulder, a hole.
1130900|LMP|Where's the hole? I can't see the hole - -
1130900|CC|Challenger, Houston. R-3, cross range, is okay as is.
1130908|CDR|Okay.
1130912|LMP|Okay. We're coming up - -
1130915|CDR|We're in posture for a T-2, Gordy.
1130919|CC|Roger.
1130922|LMP|Okay. I can see the Scarp. I can see Hanover. Good thing we didn't plan to go to Hanover. (Laughter) it's steep.
1130934|CDR|Look at the boulder - halfway up the hill.
1130935|LMP|Yes.
1130936|CDR|Not halfway, just enough - -
1130937|LMP|Yes, the boulder tracks - they're beautiful.
1130939|CDR|It's sitting right there in the end of the tracks.
1130940|LMP|There are tracks all over that hillside.
1130940|CDR|There's a boulder came right down to the surface there. See it?
1130945|LMP|Yes.
1130945|CDR|That one right through that little crater -
1130946|LMP|Yes.
1130946|CDR|- - sitting right there for us to sample. Look at it.
1130950|LMP|Yes, sir.
1130954|CDR|I'll bet Bear Mountain and the Sculptured Hills are the same.
1130956|LMP|Yes. They - Well, the slope's different. We'll have to look at it from outside. You may be right. Now I see why they call them sculptured. My god, they're so hummocky that there's shadow all over them.
1131007|CDR|Yes. God, there are some holes and rocks around here. Who told me this was a flat landing site?
1131011|LMP|It is flat. For crying out loud. What do you want, an airtight guarantee?
1131017|CDR|Let's see, we got about 2 degrees left and about 5 degrees pitchup.
1131022|LMP|We're about what - about 100 meters from Trident?
1131027|CDR|Yes - yes, less than that, I think Trident's right here.
1131031|LMP|Our shadow's about 100 feet, Geno, I think.
1131034|CDR|Yes, we're only about - yes, less than 100 meters then. It doesn't look that long, but it ... there are some holes I'm glad I didn't land in around here, I'll tell you.
1131050|CDR|Now, if you look at the massif, Jack. I don't know if you can see it over here. You see, they're almost like a series of linear boulder tracks, but they come crossways down the slope. So it looks like there may very definitely be some - some jointed - There's outcrop on top the massif, too.
1131105|LMP|Oh, it sure looks like it, gray outcrop - -
1131108|CDR|And there's -
1131109|LMP|- bluish gray compared to the - the brown or tan gray of the massif side.
1131115|CDR|And a lot of that boulder is - a lot of that outcrop down on the bottom is boulder.
1131119|LMP|Yes.
1131120|CDR|Do you know what that reminds me of, way up on top - that outcrop? it reminds me of sunset where you could just get a little piece of outcrop around the corner.
1131120|CC|And, America, I have a pan camera photo pad whenever you're ready for it. It'll go on page 129.
1131125|LMP|That's right.
1131128|CDR|Okay. Let's see what we're doing. We got 3 minutes for T-2. Let's take another check.
1131133|LMP|Okay. I just looked at them.
1131134|CDR|Okay. Ascent looks good.
1131139|CDR|Gordy, I noticed something ever since we've landed. The oxidizer quantity went from - from 7 or 8, and now it's down to 2, and the fuel has stayed constant.
1131152|CC|Roger.
1131153|CDR|And the QUANTITY light came on somewhere, I believe, after we landed.
1131158|LMP|Yes, it did. I noticed the QUANTITY light also. I was thinking reg light, though, when I saw it.
1131210|CDR|Oh, man.
1131213|CC|Challenger, we'll have a story on that for you later. We don't think we were really low level.
1131222|CDR|Okay. It doesn't make any difference now, Gordy, except to talk about when we get home.
1131227|CC|Roger.
1131230|CDR|And we're 2 minutes and counting to T-2.
1131234|CC|Roger.
1131235|LMP|We better hurry if - you're going to give - they're going to give us the GO.
1131303|LMP|How about some water?
1131306|CDR|Yes, you can zap me.
1131310|CDR|Oh, I tell you. That's something everyone's got to do once in their life.
1131316|CDR|I want to - We're not going to have much time for T-2 - -
1131321|CC|Challenger, Houston. You're STAY for T-2, and GO for the DPS vent.
1131329|LMP|Okay.
1131329|CDR|Okay. Understand. STAY for T-2, and GO for the DPS vent. Let me get out of - Okay, we can't hack that. I'm going to get out at 12.
1131338|LMP|Excuse me, Gene.
1131349|CDR|Okay. You can unzap that water, if you'd like. And let's go off VOX. Let's go on PTT.
1131427|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We mark the unofficial landing time at 113 hours 1 minute, 52 seconds Ground Elapsed Time. And, from the description, the unofficial landing site is about 100 meters beyond the crater Poppy -
1131446|CDR|Okay. REG 1 is CLOSED, Houston; OXIDIZER FUEL VENTS coming OPEN.
1131449|CC|Roger.
1131449|CDR|MASTER ARM, ON. MASTER ARM's coming ON. Okay, Gordo. I got two good lights.
1131457|CC|Roger.
1131457|CDR|DESCENT VENT, FIRE. Okay -
1131504|CDR|MARK it. Now we did not hear anything on that one, Gordy.
1131509|CC|Roger.
1131512|CDR|... pressure's coming down, though. Pressure's coming down.
1131520|LMP|Okay. MASTER ARM, OFF. Okay, we'll monitor oxidizer pressure until 20 to 40, and then OX VENT, CLOSED; fuel pressure to less than 8. FUEL VENT.
1131531|CDR|DESCENT QUANTITY light - REG light. Excuse me.
1131539|CDR|Okay. MODE CONTROL, two to ATT HOLD. Well, we just keep going, I guess.
1131550|LMP|Yes. Hey, we can press on. Okay. Okay. Now wait a minute. Here we go. Let's get that. Go up here first, because I haven't selected it.
1131607|LMP|Okay. ECA CONTROL is CLOSED. Three is back on.
1131615|LMP|BATTERY 5 is OFF/RESET, and it's off the line.
1131621|LMP|BATTERY 6, OFF/RESET, and it's off the line. INVERTER number 2 breaker is IN. INVERTER 2. Let me check the voltage. Voltage is great. Okay. Keep going.
1131644|LMP|DESCENT ENGINE OVERRIDE'S OPEN. ASCENT ECA CONTROL'S OPEN. CWEA cycling, cycled; both lights are out. Okay. Cabin pressure is good. Okay.
1131706|LMP|And then, A and B going to CABIN. A is to CABIN. B is to CABIN. PULL-EGRESS. RETURN is EGRESS. REPRESS going to AUTO. Stand by for a noise.
1131732|LMP|There you go. It's in AUTO. Okay. Now it's your turn. Verify - Wonder where it's going? (Laughter) Out, I guess.
1131755|LMP|INVERTER 2 is selected. Okay. And DECA POWER, OPEN. And guess what? Take your helmet and gloves off.
1131904|CDR|Okay, Gordy. We're in 1-1. Helmets and gloves are off, DIVERTER VALVES are IV.
1131912|CC|Okay. We're right with you.
1131920|CDR|And you're looking at NOUN 20.
1132003|LMP|Window shades are going close. I just - I'm using it instead of a light switch because I've got it covered up.
1132028|CDR|Gordy, you got NOUN 20?
1132030|CC|That's affirmative. We copy NOUN 20.
1132035|CDR|Okay. Jack's going to pick up the AGS - on the right side of that page, and I'll part the antenna
1132042|CC|Roger.
1132301|CDR|P20's in work. Correction, P57's in work.
1132314|CC|Challenger, Houston. Your DPS OXIDIZER PRESSURE is 40 or less. You could close it.
1132323|CDR|Thank you, Gordy.
1132329|CDR|Gordy, while the P57 is doing its gravity work, let me say that the L&A and the landing site, from a relief point of view, I - I think, are identical. I couldn't say enough for the L&A. I actually didn't look around nearly as much as I thought I would, or as I wanted to, because I had fixation on - on a reasonable spot to land. They're not all reasonable in that there's some very subtle hummocky-like craters right in and around where we are. And there's not a - a lot of boulders laying on the surface, but there's a lot of what appear to be boulders that are covered up by some of the dark mantle. Numerous enough that you would not like to take a chance at putting a - a pad down on one of them or in one of those hummocky subtle craters. As a result, I really didn't have a chance to look all around at where I wanted to except to put the bird down where I wanted it.
1132438|CC|Okay. We've got no complaint with that.
1132450|CDR|I guess the thing that probably - probably surprised me most about the site, as far as landing is concerned, is the fact that there were these - these - I hesitate to say they're outcrops but certainly they're buried massive pieces of rock, whether they're boulders or not we'll have to find out, out here in the plains area, partially covered and filleted by the dark mantle. And I expected to find a number of craters, but I guess I really didn't expect to find - to find the - the rock types around. And we're talking about anywhere from 1 to 2 meters down to - oh, 2 or 3 feet, which when they're sticking out and on the sides of some of these subtle craters look pretty menacingly. But that probably is the one thing that surprised me most.
1132544|CC|Roger, Gene.
1132548|CDR|The visibility prior to pitchover was such that I could see Nansen. I could see the Scarp. I could see Lara. I could not see Camelot until after pitchover. However, once I had pitchover, if I could have froze it right there like we do in the simulator occasionally, I could have picked out everything there was to see. Even at 6000 feet, the small triangle with Frosty and Rudolph and Punk were visible to me. I had - I had Poppy from orbit, as a matter of fact, so it was easily - easy to see. Barjea was a very sharp round crater just as depicted on the L&A. The thing I really didn't get a good look at, because I didn't pay too much attention to it, was from Trident on to the south.
1132639|CC|Roger.
1132640|LMP|Gordy, this is the LMP. Let me say - Gordy, this is the LMP. Let me say that the inside of the spacecraft looked just like the simulators.
1132651|CC|Very good, Jack.
1132706|CDR|Another interesting thing, Gordy. All the way through PDI prior to pitchover, Jack and I had - had the real America, the other America - right out - smack out the front window all the way down, which was pretty spectacular.
1132723|CC|I'll bet it was. And you can consider yourself STAY for T-3.
1132730|CDR|Thank you, sir. You're getting smoother all the time. If you're happy with NOUN 22, I'll PRO.
1132740|CC|Stand by 1.
1132746|CC|You're clear to PRO.
1132842|LMP|Okay, Gordy. I had the angles matched on the steerable and went to SLEW, and they - it held for a few seconds and then dropped off.
1132854|CC|Okay. It looks pretty good. You might try to peak it up just a little more.
1132903|LMP|No, we're on an OMNI now.
1132907|CC|Roger.
1132913|LMP|I'll try the steerable one more time here.
1132923|CC|Okay, you should be - -
1132924|LMP|Okay. We're on the steerable, and I'm not going to touch it.
1132936|LMP|It's steerable and SLEW, and I got 3.8.
1132942|CC|Okay. That looks good to us, Jack.
1133005|CC|Jack, we'd like you to verify the TAPE RECORDER, OFF.
1133013|LMP|Yes, that's verified, Gordy.
1133058|LMP|Gordy, how does the fuel vent look to you?
1133104|CC|Okay. Looks like 8 to us. You can go ahead and close it.
1133107|LMP|Anyway, it - Okay. I already did.
1133830|CDR|Gordy, I - I guess I'm puzzled on that one. I had the right star. You see anything we did wrong?
1133842|CC|Stand by. We're checking.
1133955|CC|Gene, our only guess is that you might have loaded NOUN 88 wrong. We'd like you to start over, and we'll watch you real close again.
1134007|CDR|Gordy. Listen, I think we know what we did. We loaded SPRL for CRSR, and CRSR for SPRL. How would it be if we went through the P57 again and - Yes - we'll - I guess we got to do it all over. Those old numbers are no good anymore.
1134028|CC|Okay.
1134033|CDR|I - you can - I'm sure that's what we did. We loaded CRSR for SPRL, and SPRL for CRSR.
1134040|CC|Okay. And it's our fault, too. We should have watched that.
1134153|CC|Jack, this is Houston. We do have the pre-PDI AGS cal numbers. You won't need to read them to us.
1134204|LMP|Okay.
1134208|CDR|Gordy, you going to want a recycle on this gravity measurement? I doubt if it'll need it.
1134216|CC|Stand by. No, no recycle necessary this time through.
1134227|CDR|Okay.
1134234|LMP|Gordy, ED BATs are 37.2.
1134251|CDR|Gordy, let me comment about the handling of the bird. After you once fly it around in orbit a little bit, you get accustomed to the thrusters, and it - it came back to me quite a bit from 10, anyway. And you get a feel for acceleration and deceleration as well as the attitude hold capability. And it really - the response, even with a heavy descent - descent stage near the surface, is phenomenal. Responded exactly in the direction I wanted, held attitude very good. And, let me tell you, the LLTV plays no small part in this landing as far as I'm concerned.
1134335|CC|Roger, Gene.
1134347|LMP|Okay. NOUN 22 again. I'll go ahead and torque them.
1134352|CC|Okay. Go ahead.
1134426|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 113 hours 44 minutes Ground Elapsed Time in the mission of Apollo 17. Some refined numbers on the landing site for Challenger: in degrees minutes and seconds, the latitude has been pinned down to 20 degrees 9 minutes 50.5 seconds north, longitude 30 degrees 46 minutes 19.3 seconds east, which is about 639 meters east of the designated landing point - the premission landing point. For those newsmen who have the landing site with the grid coordinates on it, that corresponds to DN.0 by 84.2. At 113:45 Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
1134859|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 113 hours, 48 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We're estimating a change of shift, if you will, Press Conference with the landing team flight director, Gerry Griffin, in the small briefing room at 3:00PM, To repeate estimated Press Conference in about 20 minutes, approximately, 18 minutes to be exact, in the small Briefing Room in Building 1. Some 42 minutes away from acquisition as the Command Module, America, comes around on revolution 14. Meanwhile on the surface, to repeat: the estimated landing site is right down the line on the Ground Track. However some 369 meters east or short of the predesignated, premission landing point.
1135020|CDR|Okay, Gordy. It's a little better.
1135026|CC|Roger. Looks good.
1135031|LMP|Computer is NOUN 93.
1135052|CC|Okay. Torque it.
1135142|CC|Challenger, Houston. We're standing by for the dumps.
1135144|LMP|Okay, Gordo. I'm ready to give the E-mem - Coming at you -
1135149|LMP|MARK it. It's on the way.
1135302|CDR|Gordy, one other thing about the landing. I saw the light, I think. And I heard Jack call it - the CONTACT light. I think I waited about a second and - and hit the stop button. She shut down immediately. And, of course, you could feel the fall. I don't really feel we fell that much, but it was quite a change in acceleration at that point.
1135337|CC|Roger, Gene.
1135341|CDR|And I guess I had, from what I would guess, a foot or 2 for - per second forward on that one.
1135350|CC|Okay. Sounds good.
1135412|CDR|And let me know when I can have the computer, please.
1135417|CC|Okay. It's your computer. And I'm standing by with parking angles when you're ready to load them.
1135425|CDR|Okay. We'll be ready in a second.
1135502|LMP|Go ahead with the angles.
1135505|CC|Okay. These are the IMU parking angles. Plus 295.86. I see you're loading the radar. Do you want to just load these or write them down?
1135532|LMP|Go ahead. I'm writing.
1135533|CC|Okay. Y will be plus all zeros. And plus 084.14, Over.
1135548|LMP|Okay. NOUN 20 will be plus 295.86, plus all zeros, plus 084.14.
1135555|CC|That's correct.
1135619|LMP|Okay, Houston. I'm going to power down the AGS, if you're willing.
1135631|CC|Not yet, Jack. We'd like you to read out 047 and 053 to us.
1135640|LMP|Okay. You want the new ones.
1135650|CDR|Okay, Gordy. If you're happy with NOUN 22, I'll ENTER them.
1135656|CC|We're happy.
1135700|CDR|Okay. And it just dawned on me. I'm sorry about the zero on the NOUN 69. (Laughter)
1135709|CC|That's okay. You're forgiven.
1135713|CDR|I appreciate that.
1135727|CC|Okay, Jack. We got 047 and 053.
1135736|LMP|Okay. Am I GO to PULL the breakers?
1135802|CDR|Okay. Are you happy with NOUN 20?
1135819|CC|Okay. We're happy with NOUN 20, and you're clear to power down the AGS.
1135819|LMP|Okay.
1135941|LMP|Gordy, the breakers are coming OPEN on 1-4 and 1-5
1135946|CC|Roger.
1140139|PAO|This is Apollo Control. To repeat, there will be a change in shift press conference with the Flight Director, Gerry Griffin, in the small briefing room in approximately 5 minutes. At 114 hours 1 minute Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
1140216|CDR|Gordo, we're on 1-6.
1141110|PAO|This is Apollo control at 114 hours 11 minutes Ground Elapsed Time into the mission of Apollo 17. Commander Gene Cernan's heart rate during the descent and landing ranged from 102 average during the descent portion of the landing to 128 at actual touchdown. There is a change of shift briefing that will start momentarily in the small briefing room in building 1. We'll take down the broadcast line at this time and tape any conversation during that period and play it back at the conclusion of the briefing which starts now. This is Apollo control out.
1141119|CC|Okay, Thank you.
1141137|LMP|Okay, Houston. We're at the bottom of 1-8, and I'm standing by for your lift-off times.
1141143|CC|Okay, Jack. Lift-off time for rev 15 is 116:55:51, 16 is 118:54:28; 120:53:04; 122:51:40; 124:50:17; 126:48:53. Over.
1141230|LMP|Okay. Starting with rev 15, 116:55:51; 118:54:28; 120:53:04; 122:51:40; 124:50:17; 126:48:53.
1141250|CC|That's a good readback.
1141511|CDR|Gordo, the PLSS is against the hatch, and we're installing the BRA.
1141517|CC|Roger on that.
1142822|CC|Challenger, Houston. We've got three questions for you to help pin down your exact position, any time it's convenient. Maybe when you're taking the out-the-window pictures. Over.
1142836|CDR|Okay, Gordo. I think we can give it to you. Why don't you wait? We're just getting the - the mag bag out and jett bags out from behind the engine cover here, to give you an idea where we are.
1142848|CC|Okay. No hurry at all.
1142854|CDR|I had it pinned down for you, until I got to about 500 feet, when I changed my mind.
1142903|CC|Roger.
1143017|CDR|Gordy, we're not going any further, and we'll answer your questions here when we get some time, my best guess is 150 meters from Poppy at 1 to 2 o'clock.
1143034|CC|Okay. We copy that.
1143038|CDR|And I'll bet on that one. But we'll get with you in a minute.
1143043|CC|Okay. 150 north-northwest of Poppy.
1143049|CDR|Yes. Mostly west, but slightly north.
1143054|CC|Roger.
1143100|CDR|I'll tell you the - we're abeam, I think, just about abeam of Trident 1. I can see it out there, but I can't really define Trident 1 from Trident 2. And the thing that is a little different is that I appear to be closer to it than I normally would have expected to be.
1143122|CC|Okay.
1143127|LMP|That's probably as close as the Navy Captain could ever guess where he is anyway.
1143133|CC|Roger. (Laughter)
1143135|LMP|Okay, Houston. We're just starting our eat-period. Sorry to be a little behind, DRD readings are 17037 and LMP is 24117.
1143150|CC|Okay, Jack. We got that.
1143155|CC|Would you verify your BIOMED, RIGHT?
1143202|LMP|Yes, that's verified. How does it look?
1143205|CC|Looks good.
1143602|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 114 hours 36 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. During the just ended Press Conference with the off-going flight director Gerry Griffin, some four minutes of air-to-ground tape with the crew of Challenger has been accumulated, compressed somewhat from the actual real-time. That four minutes of tape will be played back and we'll rejoin the conversation with the Crew of Challenger at Taurus Littro Landing Site at the conclusion of that tape. Roll the tape.
1144111|CDR|Okay, Gordy. We're starting to cut into a little lunch here and, if you've got any questions, why don't you come up with them now?
1144121|CC|Okay. We're wondering if you can give us estimate of the angular position, clock position of Rudolph. And can you line up Rudolph with a horizontal feature out beyond it?
1144136|CC|I - I should say horizon feature - out in the distance, not horizontal.
1144146|CDR|Okay. I thought Rudolph was right out there at 3 o'clock. Jack's looking at it and he said, yes, that is Rudolph right at 3 o'clock out his right-hand window.
1144159|CC|Okay.
1144203|CDR|I don't know if it'll mean anything to you, but the shadow of the LM, the rendezvous radar antenna is pointing about one-third of the way down from the peak of Family. And that, I know, is pretty gross. And, Gordo, I - I must be right here abeam of Trident 1. The only reason I hesitate is that I'm so close - but it's probably, well I guess it's close to 100 meters - 80 meters anyway - to where the - where the rim of Trident 1 falls off. And I am abeam of the center of Trident 1, and that's the only possible thing it could be. And that would put Poppy just about where I expected it to be.
1144301|CC|Okay.
1144305|CC|We just want to confirm. You're referring to Trident 1 as the easternmost part of Trident, is that right?
1144317|CDR|No, sir, Gordo. It's always been the westernmost part of Trident. The - the landing site was on a line between Trident 1 and Rudolph and judging from what Jack's got on his right-hand window and what I got on my left-hand window we're right there, except possibly a skosh further south on that line.
1144340|CC|Okay, understand.
1144345|LMP|And the target point that was in the PGNS was right up where we all had expected it to be about halfway between here and what we're calling the rim of Camelot. We can't see into Camelot; we can just see the rim of it. It's several - oh, at least 200 meters - 2 to 300 meters up there, I expect.
1144410|CC|Okay, what o'clock position is the west - the nearest part of the rim of Camelot? Or maybe if it's better defined - -
1144421|LMP|12 o'clock.
1144423|CC|- - Define the south rim. Can you see the south rim of it?
1144429|CDR|Yes, Gordy, but it - it blends in so well; all we're seeing is a - an undulating high as the rim. And to the best of my knowledge, we've got the south rim at - or correction, the east rim right at 12 o'clock. Hey, Gordy, right at 12 o'clock also is a boulder that's at least 3 meters and maybe 5, and I wouldn't be a bit surprised if you can find it. It's on a line between us and the intersection of the South Massif and the Family Moun - Mountain horizon. Just slightly left of that line or south of that line. And that boulder ought to show up on your best photography.
1144516|CC|Okay, Jack. We'll take a look. One other question - -
1144521|LMP|And it's at - it's at least - that boulder's at least 200 meters away.
1144529|CC|Okay. Can you see the west rim of Trident, and can you give us a clock position on the west rim of West Trident?
1144546|CDR|Okay, Gordy. The west rim of Trident, which, by the way, is full of outcropping-looking boulders, is at 10 o'clock.
1144602|CC|Okay, Gene - -
1144602|CDR|Okay, I can look back around the corner now and I can - I can see where the east - where Trident 1 rose up to its rim on the east side, and I would say we're abeam of a point - abeam of a point one-third the way from east to west up the center of Trident; that is, we're - we've covered one-third of Trident 1 and we're abeam of a point of a line that goes through the one-third point from east to west of Trident 1.
1144649|CC|Okay, Gene; that's very clear. I think we've got you pretty well nailed down. And you're pretty close to the - the planned landing site.
1144702|CDR|Yes, I think it's very close to our planned landing site and I - I'm (chuckle) - I'm anxious to see where Poppy is, because I think what I said earlier is true.
1144713|CC|Okay. That's all the questions now. Enjoy your dinner.
1145024|LMP|Houston, I have calmed down, but be advised that our dinner is corn chowder.
1145035|CC|Roger.
1145042|CDR|He went to captain's mast for eating that the other day.
1145609|LMP|Gordy, Houston; 17. How do you read - or Challenger or whoever we are.
1145615|CC|Whoever you are; you're loud and clear.
1145621|LMP|I took the binocs and looked at some large boulders at our 12 o'clock position. They're probably on the order of a half meter to 2 meters, buried but without strong filleting. And most of them that I could see had the same mottled light-gray and medium-gray texture, and it looked like there's a lineation in it. And whatever the mottling is, it's on a frame size or fragment size of a - or a few centimeters, and it looks as if it's very uniform in that mottling; that is, there's one -one fragment size.
1145711|CC|Okay.
1145714|LMP|There are, a few near one crater out at 12 o'clock, dark-gray rock that may be glass coated. Matter of fact, one of them looks like it's right at the rim and might have been part of a projectile that made the crater.
1145735|CC|Roger.
1145748|LMP|The large boulder that I mentioned that's several meters in diameter - I'm not even sure it's a boulder - it does have a well-developed fillet. It's highly fractured. It looks like the fractures generally are north-south. At least you can't - we can't see end on into the fractures. And it's too far away to be sure, but it looks like it's mottled also, although there did appear in the bin - in the monocular to be a more heterogeneous mottling. It might be a breccia.
1145828|CC|Okay.
1145832|LMP|That boulder ought to be very close to the ALSEP site.
1145838|CC|Roger.
1145847|CDR|Gordo, in reference to these boulders, everywhere I can see out of my left window and out ahead of me in referring to that boulder Jack's talking about which is just a little bit on my side at 12 o'clock, it appears that the dark mantle has filleted and, for the most part, covered - or it has covered part of or is up on top of some of the crevices and the crannies in the boulders themselves, with the exception of - Well, I'll take that back - even the very small ones. I'd say from a population point of view, boulders of the size Jack's talking about that are visible through the surface anywhere from 1 to 2 to 3 meters - a very small percentage, but when you look at them at our level, it looks like they are quite populous. I'd say there are maybe about 25 of them in view between myself and the - where the horizon falls off down away from us towards the South Massif. The area back towards Station 1, at least the other side of Trident, looks like it's more heavily strewn with some of these filleted and partially mantled large fragments.
1150018|CC|Roger, Gene.
1150023|LMP|To say that there is a boulder, as such, actually sitting on the surface, I can't - I really can't find one, unless they're along - around something very small and possibly younger craters. But I think for the most part everything is somewhat mantled.
1150041|CC|Okay.
1150049|LMP|Gordy, I think maybe the predictions of a fairly thin regolith were good. I have a crater at about - oh, 130 feet. It looks like it's not more than a meter deep. It's very fresh, has a bright halo around it, and it's very rocky in its interior and has some rocks that are at least 10 or 20 centimeters in diameter on the rim. It looks like it's penetrated into some rockier - much rockier substrate than what we're seeing on the surface. The surface itself looks like a - oh, probably 15 percent fragments greater than half a centimeter.
1150156|CC|Okay, Jack.
1150157|LMP|I don't see any general si - I don't see any general size, Gordy. I do have a crater out here that's - maybe a meter in diameter that - fairly fresh, although not bright halo - that has not penetrated to blocky material. And it looks like that the saturation crater size is very small in the area we can see; that is, there don't seem to be any old or very subdued craters - Well, let me - let me think about how to put that again. They're - it's obviously saturated with craters a few centimeters in diameter, but when you get bigger than that, there seems to be more of a - a clear distribution rather than a saturation.
1150257|CC|Okay.
1150303|CDR|Gordy, let me give you a quick far horizon. At 12 o'clock, I've got Family Mountain. It's a - it and South Massif are a replica from their plane form where I - up from where I am, except that Family Mountain is much more symmetrical and rounds off to a very more definite peak. The South Massif, in turn, has got a high plateau, a high flat peak on top. My far horizon then, at 12 o'clock, from about - to 11:30 is dominated by Family Mountain. It's - Well, I hate to use the word anorthosite without getting out of the spacecraft, but it sure is white. It sure is white, but its varied shades of white - with - sort of a - a tendency on its southern or southeastern slope to sort of be marble caked with a darker material much the same color as the mantle that we're - we've landed on. The Family Mountain disappears just about at the level of the rim of Camelot on my far horizon and just in front of it - it starts up - that's at about 11 o'clock - it just - just there is where the South Massif starts up very abruptly - I'd say - well, I'll try not to overestimate, but certainly 30 degrees, I'd say - very abruptly to a very impressive altitude. I know I was at 13,000 when I said I was at their level, but - it sure looked it from there. It - it plateaus off from about 10:30 to about 9:30, and then it starts sloping back down towards the east at about the same angle. Very symmetrical. There are several places where you can see what appear to be outcrops. I say several - about a dozen anyway, where you can see relatively large areas of outcrop on the South Massif. That outcrop is a - of a darker gray color than the white-gray of the Massif itself. The one most domin - dominant outcrop is right at the change in slope to the west, where it goes upslope and then plateaus off, and there is a definite outcrop. And you can see several boulders on all levels of the Massif that have come apparently from outcrops and I feel certain we will be able to get to some of those - that have come all the way down. South Massif, too, is a - appears to be in areas marbly caked dirty, such as if it was sprinkled with a dirty or a darker covering, and that covering is more evident as - as it slopes back here towards the - towards the east. As the far horizon now, I can see - I can see - South Massif all the way to 9 o'clock, but then behind it, there's just a little breadloaf-type dome of a much darker, much more hummocky mound back there, relatively big. It's probably, from where I stand, at least 10 percent the - the size of the Massif, the South Massif. Gray in texture. There appear to be some lineations running - well, as I'm looking at them, they're dipping down into the west at about 20 degrees, but that may be a Sun-angle problem. But they're definitely there. And then, contrasting that is - is Bare Mountain which is also much darker gray, much different than the Massif from where I stand, much more hummocky surface. It appears to be to me what I would expect Sculptured Hills to be like. One other thing about the South Massif is that - as I look at - as I look at it - at about 9:30 to 10:30, there is a little knob of the South Massif that sort of - oh flows toward - towards the east or slightly towards the northeast. That's the one that tends to be a little bit more heavily covered with the - darker dusty material - -
1150808|CC|Challenger, Houston, over.
1150812|LMP|There are. Go ahead.
1150813|CC|Okay. We're about 12 - 13 minutes behind the timeline for starting cabin preps. And backroom is enjoying your descriptions, but we think we'd rather you press on with the preps and get ready to get out for a really good view. Over.
1150834|LMP|Okay, Gordy. We're - we're doing this and eating too - We're trying to do them both at the same time, and we are pressing. Just want to say one other thing about the Massif. I can see a couple of places where craters have - have penetrated very small craters and penetrated the Massif -craters maybe a meter or 2 in size, some 5 meters, and there's a lot of rock debris around them, which tends to believe that there is very little, if any, soft covering on that Massif.
1150906|CC|Roger.
1150908|LMP|Gordy, just a couple more words about the North Massif. It looks like a good distribution of boulder tracks. Many of the boulders are accessible. They are - the tracks can be traced up, at least to midslope. That's at my 3 o'clock position. And occasionally, at that midslope position, particularly northwest of Henson, you can see abundant boulders suggestive of outcrop. That's something that we had missed seeing on the pre-mission photos. But - And it isn't as abundant as on the South Massif, but there are apparent ledge formers about midslope.
1151010|CDR|Yes, let's make ... I don't know ... a lot of ... No way it could be 1.
1151049|CDR|Give me that ... throw away.
1151104|LMP|Okay, Gordy. There's also a few very bright spark - sparkles from the surface - not abundant, but a few.
1151118|CDR|Well, let me - I - I need these.
1151353|CC|Challenger, Houston. I'm going to hand you over to the good Dr. Parker here. Have a good trip outside there.
1151401|CDR|Gordy, thank you. You do outstanding work and we sure do appreciate it, babe.
1151408|CC|My pleasure.
1151618|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 115 hours 16 minutes. Mission Control at presently is using these coordinates as the landing point. We will continue to try to refine that landing point further. But, as of now, we're saying the landing point is 20 degrees 9 minutes 50 seconds north, 30 degrees 46 minutes 19 seconds east. This would correspond to - on the map, for those of you who have grid maps, DM 8 and 82.7. This -
1151712|CDR|Bob, we'll give you a call in a minute. We just made a couple of suit adjustments.
1151718|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1151725|PAO|It's estimated that the lunar module, Challenger, is on the planned north south line and approximately 1 to 200 meters east of the planned landing point.
1151835|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 115 hours 18 minutes. We want to distinguish between the targeted landing point and the planned landing point. It had been the crew's intention all along to land approximately 200 meters east or short of the targeted landing point, the point at which the computer was targeting the Challenger. So, we believe that Challenger is approximately 300 meters east of the targeted landing point, which would put it about 100 to 200 meters east of the planned landing point.
1152038|CC|Apollo 17, Houston.
1152045|CDR|Go ahead, Bob.
1152046|CC|Okay, Challenger; we've just lost about 16dB on your high gain signal strength there. We're wondering if you happened to hit the switch there, has it moved, or could you give us a check on it?
1152102|CDR|We're nowhere near it. Stand by 1.
1152122|CC|Okay. And, Challenger, that should be a PITCH of 21 and a YAW of minus 45.
1152132|CDR|Plus 21 and minus 45; Roger. Bob, about 2 minutes here.
1152138|CC|Okay.
1152630|LMP|Bob, this is Jack. On that high gain, I'm up close to 39 now, which is better than when we landed. Do you want me to do anything to it?
1152643|CC|Stand by on that.
1152649|CC|Leave it alone. It seems to have gone away, Jack. It may have been a ground problem.
1152657|CC|Did you guys adjust it, Jack?
1152704|LMP|Yes, Bob. We had to fix the drink bags and a couple other things.
1152710|CC|No. Did you guys adjust the high gain antenna?
1152716|LMP|No. I didn't touch it.
1152718|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1152720|CDR|Buddy SLSS's in there?
1152723|LMP|No. That's over there. Oh, did they? ... In there? I don't - I thought it was over on your side. Okay? Okay, that's over there. Bigger than it used to.
1152752|CC|And, Challenger, we have your hot mike.
1152759|LMP|Well, because I - -
1152905|CC|Challenger, Houston. Over.
1152910|CDR|Go ahead, Bob.
1152911|CC|Okay. When you guys get to the top of page 2-5, and I assume you're down still in the - ETBs from what your comments were on the hot mike there. When you get to the top of page 2-5, we'd like you to put both DEMAND REGs to EGRESS. Over.
1152928|CDR|Okay, Bob. Will do. We'll give you a call as we go along.
1152931|CC|Roger. Thank you.
1152936|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 115 hours 30 minutes. Ron Evans in America has about 14 and a half minutes left before loss of signal on the 14th revolution. He's -
1153055|CDR|Hey, Bob, while I'm thinking of it, we're - we're working with one pair of scissors down here. We're going to take them out with us in the ETB. You might make a point of reminding us to bring them back.
1153105|CC|Okay. I copy that. Never did find Ron's, huh?
1153112|CDR|No, sir, and I couldn't just leave him up there starving to death.
1153119|CC|Roger on that.
1153125|CDR|By the way, how's he doing?
1153128|CC|Stand by.
1153142|CC|Challenger, Houston. Your buddy is doing great, and the sounder is also doing great, which is a surprise, I guess.
1153151|CDR|I'm glad to hear that.
1153157|LMP|That was no surprise, Bob. We wouldn't have taken it if it wasn't going to work.
1153204|CC|I thought about that after I said it.
1153310|CDR|Bob, I just turned the URINE LINE HEATER, ON.
1153314|CC|Copy that.
1153327|CDR|And the physical status of the crew is excellent, by the way.
1153332|CC|Beautiful, The Surgeon's happy.
1153436|CDR|Say, Bob, we're at the top of 2-5, and I forgot what it was you wanted me to do up there.
1153443|CC|Okay. We'd like you to have DEMAND REGs, both of them, go to EGRESS, please.
1153449|CDR|Yes, sir. Okay, they're EGRESS now.
1153453|CC|Okay, thank you.
1153634|PAO|Ron Evans has just reported seeing a light flash just to the east of crater Orientale.
1153736|CDR|Okay, Bob, we're in the middle of the first paragraph on - at 115:15 in the time line.
1153744|CC|Okay; copy that.
1154125|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 115 hours 41 minutes. Neil Hutchinson who has been the Flight Director for the CSM America during this past shift will be in the MSC News Center in approximately 15 minutes for a news conference for those men who would like to discuss the CSM with him.
1154230|PAO|This is Apollo Control. This upcoming news conference will not be carried on the Public Affairs release line. We will continue carrying the air-ground from Challenger on the lunar surface. The CSM press conference will not be carried on this PAO release line.
1154412|CDR|CDR's OPS ... 5800.
1154418|CC|Okay; we copy 5800.
1154446|LMP|LMP's OPS is 6000 plus.
1154451|CC|Copy that, Jack.
1154457|LMP|Okay, eng.
1154515|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 115 hours 45 minutes. We've just had a loss of signal with America, which has now gone behind the Moon. We'll next acquire the command module at 116 hours 30 minutes. All going well with Evans in America.
1154531|CDR|Okay. Both regulators are reg - regulating slightly under 4.0.
1154540|CC|Copy that, Challenger.
1154948|CDR|Okay, Bob. The URINE LINE HEATER is OFF and the URINE LINE BREAKER is OPEN, and we are down to applying antifog.
1155003|CC|Okay. Copy that, Challenger.
1155118|PAO|This is Apollo control at 115 hours 51 minutes. The crew of Challenger, Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt, are running approximately 20 to 25 minutes behind the timeline at present - 20 to 25 minutes behind the timeline. We'll continue to keep you updated as we go along.
1155644|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 115 hours 56 minutes. We have an update on the location of Challenger. Coordinates 20 degrees 9 minutes 41 seconds north, 30 degrees 45 minutes 25.9 seconds east.
1155712|LMP|Okay, Bob, the BRA is stowed.
1155717|CC|Okay. Copy that, Challenger.
1155730|PAO|Map grid coordinates DM 682.1. This location is about 80 meters south, 220 meters east of the targeted landing point.
1155833|PAO|This location would make it very close to the planned landing point which was approximately 200 meters east of the targeted landing point.
1160015|LMP|Okay. We're at "Starting PLSS donning on LMP."
1160020|CC|Roger. Copy that.
1160058|PAO|Donning of the Life Support System, the back pack, was scheduled for 115 hours 40 minutes, so we're about 20 minutes behind at this time.
1161017|LMP|Okay, the LMP has got the RCU connected to the PLSS.
1161024|CC|Copy that, Jack.
1161143|CDR|Okay, Bob, I'm going to get on the PLSS, now.
1161148|CC|Okay, Geno. Copy that.
1161234|CDR|Sublimator exhausts.
1162218|CDR|Okay, Bob. I've got my PLSS on. We're picking it up with verifying the powerdown configuration on the upper right-hand corner.
1162225|CC|Roger. Copy that.
1162301|CDR|Circuit breakers are configured.
1162308|CC|Houston copies.
1162524|CDR|Okay, I'm in VOX. VOX SENSITIVITY is MAX, A is T/R and B is RECEIVE. Okay. You can open your breaker and connect to the PLSS comm. Houston, I guess you heard that.
1162540|CC|That's affirm. Loud and clear.
1162549|CDR|... just AUDIO breaker. Your AUDIO breaker, that's all. Want some help with that?
1162608|CDR|Yes. Do it while you're facing that way. Just hang them up. Best time to do it. All you've got is water.
1162619|CDR|Okay, Bob. We're getting Jack up on PLSS comm, and we'll be picking it up - the comm check here on left-hand column of the bottom sheet.
1162634|CC|Roger. We're following you.

1163330|LMP|Right.
1163331|CDR|Okay. Connect OPS O2 hose to PGA, blue to blue.
1163334|LMP|Okay. Where is it?
1163335|CDR|Okay. It's sticking - right - Turn around. No, that's not right.

1163419|CDR|Okay. We're right here. Okay. And I'm going to connect OPS hose to put it blue to blue, retrieve PURGE valve. Let me give you purge valve, and I'll pick that up, Jack. The cockpit's just as small as the mockup. Okay. Here you are. You verify it's in LOW, LOW.
1163438|LMP|Okay. It's in LOW.
1163440|CDR|Slip to the right just a skosh.

1163504|LMP|Okay. It's in.
1163505|CDR|Okay. My PURGE valve's LOW, locked, and the pin's in. Want some help with that? I want to take a look at it.

1163531|CDR|I don't know why, but -
1163533|LMP|Why don't you check mine, too. That's it. I'm going to have to check you anyway. Let me turn this way.
1163540|CDR|Okay.
1163556|LMP|That's why; because it wasn't locked.
1163559|CDR|Is that where you want it; facing down or in? You don't want it there, do you?
1163602|LMP|No, I don't want it there. Must have had it in the wrong - ... Thank you.
1163611|CDR|Is that where you want it?

1170037|CDR|Okay. Here it comes. I can see daylight through it.
1170041|LMP|Okay, it's coming down. Okay. That's 4 - Stand by.
1170047|PAO|Cabin pressure is coming down now.
1170053|LMP|MARK. 3.5.
1170054|CDR|Okay. It's off.
1170056|LMP|Okay. And your cuff gauge should not be below 4.6, and mine's at 5 - mine's at 5.0.
1170104|CDR|One? Okay.
1170112|LMP|Okay, The suit circuit is locked up at 4.5. We're at 3.5 and holding.
1170123|CDR|And I'm decaying.
1170126|LMP|Okay. I'm below 5.
1170127|CDR|So am I.
1170128|LMP|Verify that; okay.
1170132|LMP|Okay. I'll start my watch.
1170137|CC|Okay. We verify and we're counting.
1170138|LMP|Watches started.
1170141|LMP|Okay. OVERHEAD or FORWARD DUMP VALVE, OPEN.
1170144|CDR|Okay. Here it comes.
1170146|LMP|And it's going down.
1170149|PAO|Unofficial start of EVA 117:01:35.
1170152|CDR|You going to want me to put this in AUTO afterwards or not? So, I can turn around. Jack.
1170158|LMP|Stand by.
1170202|CDR|... open - -
1170202|LMP|... - -
1170203|CDR|- - leave it open.
1170204|LMP|Leave it open.
1170204|CDR|No, we don't, because then we don't want that hatch to get closed.
1170211|LMP|You got to turn around here. Oh, boy!
1170223|PAO|Cabin press below 1 lb per square inch now.
1170235|LMP|Boy, you sure get heavy at 5, don't you? Okay. Where are we? Right here, huh? What that was -
1170258|CDR|What's cabin, Jack.
1170305|CDR|Do you read, Jack?
1170307|CC|Jack, this is Houston.
1170308|CDR|Wait a minute.
1170309|CC|CDR, we're not reading the LMP either.
1170311|CDR|Now, how do you read?
1170313|CC|We read you - -
1170314|CDR|Now, how do you read, Jack?
1170315|LMP|Okay. You're loud and clear. Okay.
1170318|LMP|We got a switch in the wrong place as usual, Bob. I just hit the MODE SELECT; that's all.
1170325|CC|Okay. We copy.
1170326|LMP|Okay. Partially open the forward hatch, when we can. Okay. Can you zap over to the left as much as you can?
1170333|CDR|To the right, you mean?
1170334|LMP|Yes.
1170334|CDR|Yes. To the north.
1170335|LMP|To the north.
1170336|CDR|The north.
1170336|LMP|The north. (Laughter) Okay, it's about 0.2, Gene.
1170344|CDR|Okay. Let me -
1170344|LMP|You going to be able to get to it?
1170345|CDR|Yes. You bet you. I've come this far. I'm not going to miss getting that hatch open.
1170357|LMP|Hey, something just flew out.
1170359|CDR|It's open now.
1170401|LMP|Gosh, look at those trajectories (laughter).
1170404|CDR|Yes. Put just enough air in here, we're - Okay; it's open, babe. Okay; it is open.
1170412|LMP|Good. Okay; final prep, PLSS primary H2O. I've got to figure out how to open that now.
1170422|CDR|Okay.
1170431|CDR|When you're at 5 psi, it's - We never did really train for this in the right way.
1170440|LMP|Yes, we did. Okay. My water is OPEN.
1170447|CDR|And my water is OPEN.
1170502|CDR|Okay. Well, let's see, rest until cooling sufficient; 3.7 to 4.6. I'm to 4.9; coming down.
1170511|LMP|Yes, I am, too. Coming down.
1170512|CDR|CWEA status.
1170514|CDR|PREAMPs and ECS. Can you see that?
1170517|LMP|See a PREAMPs, and I see ECS.
1170519|CDR|Okay. Water SEP component light, on.
1170523|LMP|Water, excuse me, water SEP. Well, the next thing it says that Gene gets out.
1170531|CDR|I don't see that.
1170534|LMP|That's what it says on my checklist.
1170535|CDR|Okay. Good heavens! That means you got to get out of the way so I can open the hatch.
1170546|LMP|Well, I'm going to have to turn around a little, I think, so I can help you.
1170549|CDR|Okay. Boy, beware of that corner.
1170554|LMP|It's high pressure (laughter).
1170556|CDR|Yes. I tell you at 4-1/2, you're really pretty heavy.
1170559|LMP|What was that that came shooting up here? A piece of bread? (Laughter) Would you believe that?
1170605|CDR|Yes, I'd believe it.
1170609|LMP|Why is our hatch open? Somebody opened our hatch. Are you getting cooling?
1170614|CDR|I'm beginning to, I think.
1170617|LMP|I still got a water flag. Not hot. Stand by. Okay. Well.
1170640|LMP|How does the water pressures look, Houston?
1170646|CC|Challenger, they're looking just a little bit low. We're still expecting it to build up. It's going to take a little while.
1170655|CDR|Okay. I'm getting down on my knees out here. How am I looking, Jack?
1170700|LMP|You're just fine. I'm holding you away from the DEDA, the ... DSKY.
1170706|CDR|Okay. I'm going to put this visor down now, I think. How does that look to you?
1170717|LMP|What?
1170718|CDR|How are my legs? Am I getting out?
1170719|LMP|Well, I don't know. I can't see your legs.
1170722|CDR|Oh, okay (laughter).
1170724|LMP|I think you're getting out though, because there's not as much of you in here as there used to be. Oh, hey; Gene, when I get down there, I got to fix your tool harness. Hold it.
1170735|CDR|Okay. Can you reach it?
1170736|LMP|It's come off the bottom again.
1170739|CDR|Can you reach it?
1170739|LMP|Well, I can't do it now, because it's come off from the bottom. I'll have to - -
1170743|CDR|Oh, the bottom of the PLSS, huh?
1170744|LMP|Yes.
1170746|CDR|Okay. Well, my legs are out. Keep that hatch open.
1170750|LMP|Can you squat down any further, because you're hooked on - you're making it worse. Okay.
1170805|CDR|How's that?
1170806|LMP|Okay. Now, I think I - Be careful because you might hook it on something down there.
1170810|CDR|Oh, the tool harness?
1170811|LMP|Yes. The back. It's loose on your back; on the back of the PLSS.
1170816|CDR|Oh, man, I don't like that. Okay. I'll watch it.
1170818|LMP|Well, I'll fix it when I get out there.
1170820|CDR|Okay. I'm still reading 4.0. Houston, Commander is on the porch of Challenger.
1170830|CC|Roger. We copy you, Commander, and your feed water pressure is looking much better - -
1170839|CDR|Okay. Everything else look good to you?
1170842|CC|That's affirmative.
1170847|CDR|Okay, Jack. I'm going to get the MESA.
1170850|LMP|Okay. And I'll have an ETB ready for you.
1170852|CDR|Oh, man; oh, man; oh, man.
1170900|LMP|Deploy MESA.
1170901|CDR|Okay. Here it comes.
1170908|CDR|There she goes, Babe.
1170910|LMP|Yea, hey!
1170911|CDR|There she is. All the way down; it looks like. Okay. I jettisoned - Oh, you want an ETB?
1170920|LMP|That's up to you.
1170921|CDR|Yes.
1170923|LMP|You're the commander.
1170925|CDR|I got it. I got it. And, the pressure looks like it's started to stabilize at 3.8. I don't know whether I'm getting cooler or not, but I feel pretty good.
1170941|CC|Okay. We copy that.
1170943|LMP|How about a jett bag, too?
1170955|CDR|Okay. Oh, Jack, I could swing it over the - Won't be any problem. Over the strut. Okay; and the jet bag is springing free - swinging free.
1171015|LMP|You mean the ETB.
1171016|CDR|ETB. Oh, man. This looks like a Santa Claus bag.
1171021|LMP|It is.
1171023|CDR|Oh, boy. There it goes. The Rover looks in good shape. ETB is down there. Okay. I've got all my visors down. Jack, I wouldn't lower your gold visor until after you get on the porch, because it's plenty dark out here.
1171040|LMP|Okay.
1171042|CDR|Okay.
1171042|LMP|Tape recorder - -
1171043|CDR|I'm on my way.
1171044|LMP|-- is off.
1171047|CDR|Sensitivity, max and max.
1171057|CDR|Okay, Houston, The Commander is about three-quarters of the way down.
1171110|CDR|I'm on the footpad.
1171113|CDR|And, Houston, as I step off at the surface at Taurus-Littrow, We'd like to dedicate the first step of Apollo 17 to all those who made it possible. Jack, I'm out here. Oh, my golly. Unbelievable. Unbelievable, but is it bright in the Sun. Okay. We landed in a very shallow depression. That's why we've got a slight pitch-up angle. Very shallow, dinner-plate-like dish crater just about the width of the struts. How you doing, Jack?
1171213|LMP|Fine. Getting the circuit breakers verified.
1171222|CDR|The LM looks beautiful. Oh, do we have boulder tracks coming down. Let me see exactly where we are. I think I may be just in front of Punk.
1171246|CC|Okay. We copy that, Gene, and are the boulder tracks - -
1171249|CDR|I'm beginning to - -
1171249|CC|- - to both the north and south?
1171253|CDR|Okay. On the North Massif, we've got very obvious boulder tracks. A couple of large boulders come within 20 or 30 feet of the - Looks like where we can get to them, but there's a couple - there's a couple I know we can get to. Well, the Sun angle is such that, what I saw on the South Massif earlier I can't see very well. But, I know there were boulder tracks over there. The - Bare Mountain - Boy, it's hard to look to the east - Bare Mountain and the Sculptured Hills have a very, very similar texture on the surface. The Sculptured Hills is like the wrinkled skin of an old, old, 100-year-old man - is probably the best way I could put it. Very, very hummocky, and - but smoothly pockmarked. I do not see any boulders up by the Sculptured Hills from here. But it's awful hard to look to the east and to the southeast.
1171404|CC|Okay. We copy that, Gene. Have you got an LMP with you yet?
1171410|CDR|Well, here come his feet. Jack, let me make sure. We didn't have an awful lot of dust on landing; but I can dig my foot in 8 or 10 inches, and I know we're at least that thick. There's a small little 1-meter crater right in front of us with a whole mess of glass right in the middle. Right smack - That's right in front of the MESA, as a matter of fact. Right where I want to park the Rover. Jack, you're looking good.
1171439|CC|Beautiful, guys; beautiful.
1171443|CDR|I'm going to take a quick look back. I think this is Poppy, and I can give you a real better idea where we are.
1171450|LMP|Hatch is closed, barely.
1171452|CDR|Hey, Jack, don't lock it.
1171454|LMP|I'm not going to lock it.
1171455|CDR|We've got to go back there. You lose the key, and we're in trouble.
1171502|LMP|Oh, I'm on the porch. Who said this place was smooth?
1171509|CDR|Oh Boy, there's a lot of local depressions here I didn't figure existed.
1171517|LMP|Hey, who's been tracking up my lunar surface?
1171521|CDR|Hey, Bob, I'm east of the LM now. I'm east of the LM, and the back strut of the LM is - Well, the LM straddles this crater I talked about, and that's where we get the pitch angle; the back strut is probably right down in the eastern one-third of that crater. Just a little - very subtle crater.
1171547|LMP|Hey, man; you had some forward velocity.
1171551|CDR|That's what I wanted to have.
1171558|CDR|Boy, I look at some of these rocks that are filleted here, Jack, and there sure are a lot of sparklies in them. Awful lot of sparklies.
1171607|LMP|You landed in a crater!
1171610|CDR|That's a pretty good shot.
1171615|CDR|Okay. I'm going to get to work in a minute, just as soon as I take a look at Trident.
1171618|LMP|Why don't you come over here and let me deploy your antenna.
1171622|CDR|Okay. Just walk around for 1 second.
1171625|LMP|(Laughter) Hey, man, put your visor down.
1171630|CDR|And, I'll be over there, and you can fix my tool harness. I don't like that thing loose.
1171636|LMP|I don't like it loose, either. What are you doing over there? We're supposed to be working.
1171639|CDR|I was just going to give them a fix. All these little craters, Jack, have got glass in the bottom of them. Here's another one.
1171646|LMP|There's very clear sweeping of the surface by the descent plume out, oh, about 10 meters - no, 15 meters. Come over here, and I'll fix your antenna.
1171711|CDR|Okay. Hey, Bob, how big is Poppy supposed to be?
1171715|CC|Stand by. It looks on the map - -
1171720|CDR|I didn't hear you. You cut out.
1171721|CC|Okay. It looks on the map like it's about 75 meters in diameter. Fairly subtle.
1171728|CDR|Okay. Okay, I tell you where I think I landed - oh, about 100 meters from Poppy at 10 o'clock.
1171740|LMP|You think that's Poppy, huh?
1171741|CDR|I think so - I think - -
1171742|LMP|That's an awful big hole.
1171743|CDR|Well, I know. I got to look around a little more. It sure is not Trident.
1171748|LMP|Bend over and I'll - -
1171748|CDR|It might be part of Trident.
1171750|LMP|- - get your antenna. Get your antenna. Oh, a little more.
1171756|CDR|God, it's beautiful out here.
1171759|LMP|Well, hang on.
1171800|CDR|Yes.
1171805|LMP|Okay. The immediate surf - -
1171807|CDR|Not yet. Yes, go - you talk to them. I don't want you to stand up yet.
1171811|LMP|The surface is moderately cohesive, which holds a pretty good bootprint - very fine grain. Gene's ... looks very much like previous soils. You got her?
1171827|LMP|Yes. You got a hole behind you now.
1171829|CDR|Well, I'll stand in it, and you can get at it better.
1171831|LMP|Well, you got me right in the Sun. Can you come around this way? Ho-ho. (Laughter) I'm going to have to get upstream of you.
1171843|CDR|Look, you get up on the hill, and I'll get in the hole.
1171845|LMP|Yes. There you go. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
1171848|CDR|Don't move too fast. Boy, your feet look like you just walked on the Moon, you know.
1171857|LMP|Well, I tell you Gene, I think the next generation ought to accept this as a challenge.
1171908|LMP|Let's see them leave footsteps like these someday. Got another - there, that'll be all right.
1171913|CDR|Okay. What can you do with my tool harness?
1171916|LMP|I'm going to work on it; that's what I'm going to do. Whoa; hold still.
1171923|CDR|Okay. Boy, I tell you, looking to the east, you might just well forget it.
1171934|LMP|Well, let's see. How's this thing - I'm going to have to loosen it.
1171938|CDR|Well, if you could just stretch it around.
1171940|LMP|I can't.
1171941|CDR|You can't huh?
1171942|LMP|But I will be in a minute.
1171943|CDR|Don't loosen it to the point where you can't get it back on.
1171950|LMP|Okay. You're almost reconfigured.
1171954|CDR|Okay.
1172001|LMP|Okay. Somebody tied you on wrong, too. They've got the strap reversed for the Velcro. Okay, Gene. I think that will hold.
1172017|CDR|Okay, and I'm going to - -
1172018|LMP|If it doesn't I'll fix you again.
1172021|CDR|Man, there's sparklies in the soil, Jack. You can just look at it. See them all over? Very fine grained. It's sparkly, that's all. Bob, I'm going to min cooling - or, intermediate cooling.
1172034|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1172037|LMP|Boy, that sure -
1172039|CDR|See the soil sparkle?
1172042|LMP|Yes, I think that's a little glass.
1172045|CDR|There's - Let's go back here and get to work, and I'll show you that crater that's got nothing but glass in the bottom.
1172049|LMP|That's a vesicular rock of some kind there, Geno. It almost looks like a mono crater - pumice, but don't quote me.
1172102|CDR|Bob, I have to reiterate. Even the small - even the very small - the 1 and 2-inch - 3-inch fragments that are laying around here have been dusted and filleted - -
1172115|LMP|Do-tu-doo.
1172115|CDR|- - with the dark mantle.
1172117|LMP|And that sweeping by the descent stage goes all the way out there, Houston, to where we were, which was about 50 meters, I guess. Hey, man - whuh, whuh, whuh, whuh - hey these rocks - they almost have a pink - very light pinkish hue to them, and they are not - they're not obviously breccia. Now, that - that's a - like a breccia there. But this stuff is something else again.
1172153|CDR|Yes. I don't think there is any place you could land around here where you wouldn't have one foot, in the crater.
1172157|LMP|Looks like a vesicular, very light-colored porphyry of some kind; it's about 10 or 15 percent vesicles. I'm right in front of the LM. They - Quite a few of the rocks look of that type. Sort of a pinkish hue to them. The texture is coarse, but I'm not sure how crystalline they are, yet. Okay; back to work.
1172227|CDR|Jack, when you put up the ETB, the - check down there below it.
1172232|LMP|Oh-ho-ho (laughter).
1172235|CDR|Okay, let's take a look at the Rover.
1172237|LMP|Let's don't forget those.
1172238|CDR|Yes.
1172239|LMP|That's my fault; I guess.
1172240|CDR|Yes.
1172242|LMP|Okay.
1172245|CDR|Oh man, I tell you, we came down at just a little forward velocity. Look at that - right there. About a foot slip on the pad. I tell you, there's craters all over here. Okay, baby. I'd sure like to think that that wheel is where it's supposed to be. It looks good to me.
1172307|CDR|Our next little vehicle to work.
1172335|CDR|Okay. Bob, so far, the Rover looks pretty good.
1172339|CC|Roger; sounds good, Geno.
1172344|CDR|Hey, let me ask you. When I was behind the LM, I could look right into an area and see the bell of the ascent stage. I never realized that before, but I guess that's normal, huh?
1172355|LMP|Yes. We saw it on the pad. Remember.
1172358|CDR|Barely.
1172401|LMP|Remember when we went out there?
1172405|CDR|The only reason I asked, Bob, I'm sure it's normal, and it doesn't look anything's missing, it's just right - right into the Sun.
1172413|CC|Yes. The consensus of opinion down here is that you can, also.
1172421|CDR|Well, that's probably the best place in the world to get a consensus of opinion from. Okay, Jack, it's about work time. I've got this Rover about ready for - your pull up there.
1172435|LMP|I got a little delayed here.
1172437|CDR|Okay. I'm sure glad those guys made us train so hard.
1172450|LMP|Okay. The MESA's up. Let me know when you're ready to deploy.
1172457|CDR|Okay. Babe, I am - I am ready for you. Everything I can see looks pretty good. The walking hinges, you will be glad to know, are intact. They did not drop.
1172514|CC|Roger. That's a first.
1172515|LMP|You want me to go up there and do that, huh?
1172518|CDR|Yes, sir. The beginning.
1172523|LMP|You ready for me to deploy?
1172525|CDR|Okay. Let me just doublecheck. Drape, contingency, unstow aft deployment cable, verify walking hinge, forward and aft chassis parallel. They are.
1172534|LMP|MESA insulation is not coming off as easy as in training.
1172537|CDR|Okay. Outrigger cables are taut. Looking good to me. Yes, Jack. You can go on up. Go on up.
1172548|LMP|Okay.
1172549|CDR|I'm ready for you. God, that LM is a pretty sight. Challenger, you're a beauty.
1172558|LMP|Well, let's see how good I am.
1172559|CDR|Don't drop that. Let me get that thing again.
1172607|CDR|Yes, sir. (Laughter) Yes, sir. You're pretty agile there, twinkle toes.
1172616|LMP|You bet your - life I am.
1172619|CDR|All I asked you to do was pull that handle up there. Man, anything you grab, Jack - I just grabbed this lanyard that was in the dust - is really black.
1172629|LMP|You ready?
1172630|CDR|Go. She fell, Houston. She's open.
1172633|LMP|Okay. You've got parallel chassis; the wheels look good on this side.
1172639|CDR|Okay. They're good on this side. Let's get done. Let's get it out.
1172646|CDR|I'll wait for you to get the deploy cable. I'll tell you, Jack, this place is not locally level.
1172649|PAO|Deploying the Rover now.
1172654|LMP|You - you're right.
1172657|CDR|Okay. There's not - there's not many places you could put the LM down and have it be zero, zero, zero. Okay. I'm ready if you are.
1172710|LMP|I don't know how much help I'm going to be.
1172712|CDR|Well, I'm starting; you pull. It's coming. It's coming. It's coming, baby. How's your wheels on that side? Can you see them: Mine look good.
1172725|LMP|Wheels? They looked good a minute ago. I got the Sun, so I can't tell much - -
1172729|CDR|Okay.
1172737|CDR|Eeee. The only way to do it.
1172741|LMP|I'm putting all my weight (laughter).
1172743|CDR|Okay. Wait a minute. I'm coming down now. She's going to pop here.
1172746|LMP|Okay.
1172747|CDR|Wait a minute. Stand by.
1172748|LMP|I may pull a Jim Irwin here.
1172750|CDR|Wait a minute. Watch out. Here she goes.
1172753|LMP|Got her.
1172753|CDR|Okay. Beautiful, Houston. The aft chassis's out.
1172758|CC|Roger. Beautiful.
1172759|CDR|Beautiful. Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait.
1172804|LMP|Tried to get off the hinge there.
1172805|CDR|Yes, yes. She's on, though. She's all in. She's in the walking hinges. I wish you could see it. Jack, those wheels did not lock all the way up though. We ought to pull them up before we - Well, there it goes. By itself.
1172821|LMP|Okay.
1172823|CDR|Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Okay. Let me pull it until the outriggers cables get slack.
1172830|LMP|Okay. Walk away from it. Easier.
1172839|CDR|That tape up there - on the reel.
1172840|LMP|Yeah, it's all -
1172842|CDR|It's coming.
1172843|LMP|It's free reeling.
1172844|CDR|Yes. Let me - let me - don't pull it until I - Okay. Now I've got it.
1172856|CDR|Man, I'd walk and fall into that crater if I went to the end of this line.
1172901|LMP|Houston, I do think we've got a different -
1172904|CDR|Well, we're deploying it at an angle. Okay. The outrigger cables are free, Jack.
1172907|LMP|Okay. Got a different breed of rock up here. The stuff's sticking through this thin regolith - or regolith, period. I don't know whether it's thin or thick yet (singing). Okay. Mine's free.
1172925|CDR|Let me get this - let me get all this cable out of the way. Otherwise, I'll - is that enough of this stuff? I don't like all that over there. ...
1172939|LMP|A geologist's paradise, if I ever saw one. Boy, you certainly are changing the color of that cable, sir.
1172948|CDR|Yes. Just tried a John Young trick.
1172952|LMP|Did it work?
1172952|CDR|Yes. (Laughter).
1172954|LMP|You're getting dirty.
1172955|CDR|But, I'm still getting my balance. I didn't touch the ground. Just got to get some of this cable out of here.
1173004|LMP|I'm not sure my pockets are going to be accessible.
1173015|CDR|Man, I'll tell you, I don't know how long this line to pull the Rover out is, but -
1173025|CDR|Well, I'll tell you, it sure is easy to get dusty, but that's nothing new to anybody. Okay, Babe, let me get - Whee!
1173034|LMP|I think it's safe to say this surface was not formed yesterday. There is a regolith; it looks classic. Area distribution of particles up to 3 or 4 centimeters, anyway. Then, you start to get maybe a selective distribution of large fragments. Got that cable?
1173054|CDR|Yes.
1173056|LMP|Okay. I'm going to walk away with this one.
1173057|CDR|Okay; outrigger cable.
1173059|LMP|You ready?
1173059|CDR|Okay. When forward wheels on surface; okay. Let me - let me pull.
1173109|CDR|Okay, Houston. She's continuing to come.
1173117|LMP|Here's a couple of different looking rocks. One's very white; one's quite dark. But we do have a general rock type, I think, in the area - of the big boulders. Jesus, how much cable is there?
1173131|CDR|There's a lot of it Jack. Keep going.
1173133|LMP|(Laughter)
1173133|CDR|You're going to be a long way away. We're not there yet. Keep going. Okay. We've got the front wheels on the surface, but keep going, I don't think you've got it up there.
1173150|LMP|I never thought I'd do geology this way.
1173154|CDR|Okay. I think you got it. Let me see.
1173201|LMP|Is it slack?
1173203|CDR|I'll get up there and take a look. Okay. It's slack.
1173212|LMP|Longest cable in the world.
1173213|CDR|It's slack.
1173216|CC|Wait till you get to the ALSEP package.
1173217|CDR|Okay. By golly, those wheels did lock.
1173220|LMP|(Laughter) I never knew that cable was that long, Bob. Oh, a glass bottom - a glass bottom crater with a little bench. Looks like one of the Flagstaff explosion craters except for the glass in it. Right out at 12 o'clock. That's the one I was talking about, about having a bright halo. I don't know whether it's easier to walk out there or to do what I did in training - that I wouldn't do on the Moon. Somebody's going to get tangled up with this thing.
1173256|CDR|That's why I'd get it all under the LM somewhere. I'd - what I'd - took me 5 minutes to do and get it all out of the way. Okay, Bob, the front wheels locked in. I had to pull the rear wheels - rear wheels back to get them to lock in.
1173312|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1173317|CDR|At least no one let any air out of the tires. Man, I look like I've been on the surface for a week already. Holy smoley. Okay. Pull pins on deploy cable and fittings - move LRV from LM.
1173331|LMP|Wait a minute. I haven't ... the - -
1173332|CDR|Okay.
1173333|LMP|- - my other pins. It's going to take awhile. Think we can avoid that cable?
1173339|CDR|Why don't you set it there, pull this pin, and then you can go back and get it; that is, it's better to use the Rover contingency tool, because - -
1173345|LMP|Yes, but that's off over there on the ground now, somewhere or another.
1173346|CDR|Okay. Pull that pin. Until we get that saddle loose.
1173353|LMP|Loose.
1173354|CDR|Awe Beautiful. Okay, we're going to have to move that thing - that line, Jack. You ready?
1173359|LMP|I'll move it.
1173400|CDR|Okay. Let's find a - back over here. See that?
1173401|LMP|Yes.
1173406|CDR|Oh, man. Face a little more east, so I don't have to run into the ... Okay, how about here?
1173420|LMP|That's - You're the driver.
1173421|CDR|Okay; right there.
1173422|LMP|You like it?
1173423|CDR|Like it.
1173424|LMP|Okay. You got it.
1173426|CDR|Not yet. You got some fenders and stuff for me - -
1173428|LMP|I was going to get my cable. I thought you said I could work on the cable.
1173430|CDR|Ohh.
1173431|LMP|You're putting me farther and farther behind.
1173435|CDR|Oop.
1173435|LMP|Don't forget your post.
1173437|CDR|Okay.
1173437|PAO|The crew's right on the EVA timeline.
1173441|LMP|Okay. Pull pins. I can see a little yellow ... inside.
1173448|CDR|Okay. The post is up.
1173453|LMP|Hinge pins.
1173454|CDR|Okay. Yours is in, but mine is not.
1173457|LMP|Well - neither's my outboard one.
1173459|CDR|My outboard is in, but my inboard ... not.
1173506|LMP|And my outboard isn't.
1173508|CDR|Well.
1173510|LMP|That's supposed to do it. But it didn't. Let me get the contingency tool and try and push those things closed.
1173518|LMP|Okay. Be care -
1173530|CDR|There's a piece of glass I picked up. I'm going to set it right on the floor of the Rover. Jack, let me get that tool. We got to get those pins in, I think.
1173554|CDR|Bob, you got any words on the yellow pins on the rear chassis?
1173557|CC|Roger. The best way to put those in, if you've tried bouncing the chassis, would be to push them with the contingency tool. ... I think, what you're going to do.
1173609|LMP|That's affirm. Can you get that, Geno?
1173622|LMP|Need some help?
1173626|CDR|Nope. Well, I found how to get up.
1173645|LMP|Did you fall down?
1173645|CDR|Well, this thing was in the mud down here. We'll find out in a minute.
1173655|CDR|Okay, Jack. Got an out one here, huh?
1173659|LMP|Yes. Let me try to push it in.
1173706|CDR|Okay. Yours is in.
1173709|LMP|Good.
1173714|CDR|Can I get mine in?
1173719|LMP|Want me to get it?
1173720|CDR|Well, yes. Can you reach it from there? it's a nice firm ... on it. Almost. A little more. Wait a minute. Let me get it - let me get it right - Okay; push. It's in. It's in.
1173736|LMP|Very good. Why don't you put that between the seats ?
1173738|CDR|Yes, Okay. Bob, they're in.
1173742|CC|Copy that.
1173746|CDR|Okay. Now where was I? I got my fender, got the post, got to get the seat.
1173756|LMP|Ready?
1173756|CDR|I'm going to take it a little slower here in a minute.
1173758|LMP|Yes.
1173801|CDR|Just a little bit slower in a minute.
1173805|LMP|The blush is off the rose. Okay, your front pin is in. And both of mine are in.
1173814|CDR|Okay. ...
1173826|LMP|Not quite as easy as in the training building.
1173829|CDR|Well, it's a case of knowing how to play in 1/6 g, is what it amounts to. Okay. Okay. I'm ready on the - that locked?
1173843|LMP|Yes. It's locked.
1173844|CDR|Let me get the seat down. Okay. I got the console.
1173849|LMP|Okay; and I got the handle.
1173851|CDR|Okay; mine's pulled.
1173852|LMP|Mine's pulled.
1173853|CDR|Come on down, baby. Here it comes. Stiff, but come on.
1173857|LMP|There it is.
1173858|CDR|Okay; make sure your T locks.
1173900|LMP|I'm not - you're not all the way down yet, Gene.
1173901|CDR|Yes. I'm locked. There you go.
1173905|LMP|Okay. Okay, I'm locked and secured. Okay.
1173921|CDR|Oh, Jack, I put a little piece of glass I picked up right by the Rover, here.
1173924|LMP|Yes. Okay.
1173925|CDR|Just a little piece. I'm going to leave it right behind your footstool. It just - just sparkled at me. I had to pick it up. Okay?
1173931|LMP|That's yours. Your sample for the day.
1173936|CDR|I doubt that. Man, I tell you, zero g is a piece of cake if you - or 1/6 g, if you'd play it right.
1173946|LMP|Okay, Gene, you've got - fenders, your pin was good. I checked that. I could see mine too. Mine are okay, and you'll have to check your outside ones.
1173959|CDR|Okay. My two pins are good here.
1174001|LMP|Yes. And mine are good.
1174002|CDR|This one isn't quite flush. Almost. It's good.
1174006|LMP|I'm going to pull your flags. Oops, I bent that one - that one. And your attitude indicator is free.
1174012|PAO|BTU expenditure for each crewman averaging 1,300, surgeon reports.
1174019|CDR|Man, look at that stuff go, will you?
1174019|CC|And, Jack, this is Houston. We're seeing - Looks like your water temperature's getting pretty high. You might want to go to intermediate cooling or slow down or something. Looks like you're getting a little warm.
1174039|CDR|You hear them, Jack?
1174040|LMP|Yes. I got it. Thank you, Bob.
1174043|CDR|Okay, Jack, get that cable, because I tripped over it coming back.
1174047|LMP|Yes. I'll get it.
1174048|CDR|Okay. Let's see. Verify hinge pins and seal. Erect seat, seat - seatbelt. Armrest is lowered, pull T-handle, console's lowered. Tripod apex is gone both sides. Tool behind footrest; that's done. Front hinge pins are in. Erect footrest. Extend front fenders; they're down. Verify batt covers are closed. They are closed. And let's keep them clean. Man, do these gloves fit good.
1174121|CC|Okay, and 17 you're right on schedule.
1174123|CDR|Okay. Thank you, Bob. Did you tell Captain America we're on the surface?
1174140|CC|Roger. We broke the news to him awhile ago.
1174148|CDR|Okay, next spacecraft to powerup is going to commence right now.
1174159|PAO|Rover test drive coming up soon. And then we'll get to television after that.
1174204|LMP|Okay. That takes care of that little job.
1174208|LMP|How's my cooling look now, Bob? Oops.
1174211|CC|Roger. It's come down quite a bit. You were 86, and now it's down to 75. Looks much better. We didn't want you to sweat.
1174220|LMP|Well, I'm just a hot geologist; that's all.
1174223|CC|Or something.
1174243|CDR|Somebody kicked dirt all over the MESA. Let's see if there is any life - in this here baby.
1174306|CDR|Okay. Getting up and on.
1174313|LMP|Give me a yell when you start to go, and I'll try to be sure to be there with the camera.
1174316|CDR|Okay.
1174325|CDR|Big bag is deployed.
1174329|CC|Copy that.
1174344|LMP|Well, the seat belt fits perfect.
1174349|CDR|Shoot. I thought I was going to get to drive. Man, I got so much dust over my visor already, I got to wipe it off. Get that lens brush; I want you to dust me off a little later, Jack.
1174403|LMP|The lens brush?
1174405|CDR|Well, I've got to dust wy visor off with something
1174407|CC|Roger. Don't use your glove or dust brush there.
1174409|CDR|Okay; when I was bringing that -
1174413|LMP|No, we'll use the lens brush, Bob.
1174415|CC|Roger.
1174416|CDR|Okay. Let's try to see if I can read in this Sun now. Rotate the hand controller. Let's wipe it out a couple of times to make sure we got all the the steering. She's wiped out. She goes forward and she goes reverse. She's back in forward; she's wiped out, and she's in park. Reverse is down. Okay, here we go. Stand by for life. It ought to be on this one. There's life in this here baby. Beautiful.
1174510|LMP|I don't know who's responsible for packing this ETB, but I think it was me. You didn't by any chance pick up those scissors, did you?
1174520|CDR|No, sir.
1174521|LMP|They're going to be hard to find, but I think we can do it.
1174525|CDR|Well, they were right down there, unless you picked them up. That's exactly where the Rover tool was, too, and I picked it up, so it's - they're probably there. I didn't see them though. Okay.
1174537|LMP|Okay. I got my camera.
1174539|CDR|All the breakers closed except NAV.
1174544|LMP|The old 4 o'clock pan.
1174547|CDR|Okay, Houston. Amp-hours, I'm reading 115, Amps are 0. Volts are 82 and 82. Batteries are - 95 and 110. FORWARD MOTORS are off scale low, off scale low, and REARS are off scale low, off scale low. Houston, you with us?
1174625|CC|Roger. We copy that.
1174629|CDR|Okay.
1174635|CDR|DRIVE ENABLE, FORWARD ... time-1. Take it nice and easy. Here we go at time-2. And that is BOTH; I know that. That's SECONDARY. Okay; STEERING, go FORWARD to A - -
1174700|LMP|Boy, it's hard to see in that Sun.
1174702|CDR|-- and REAR to D, and REAR to D. DRIVE POWER FORWARD is going to A. I didn't feel any Earth-shaking rumbles like I do in the - in the trainer, but let's see what happens.
1174724|CDR|Okay, Jack. I'm going to find out in a minute.
1174731|LMP|Okay.
1174734|CDR|Okay. Here we go. Okay. The runt - the fright - the front wheels turn. I can't see the rear ones.
1174743|LMP|I'll verify them in a minute.
1174744|CDR|Okay. I can't see the rear ones, but I know the front ones turn. And it does move. Hallelujah! Hallelujah, Houston! Challenger's baby is on the roll.
1174801|CC|Roger. Copy that. Sounds great.
1174806|CDR|And judging - judging from the way it's handling, I think the rear wheels are steering too.
1174818|CC|That's a first.
1174820|CDR|What do you see, Jack?
1174824|LMP|Well, I - you're wrong angle. Yes, they're turning.
1174827|CDR|How does that grab you?
1174828|LMP|They're turning.
1174828|CC|How about that?
1174830|LMP|Come towards me, baby. Looks like it's moving.
1174838|CDR|Oh, boy. Keep moving.
1174850|LMP|Don't run over me.
1174851|CDR|Don't worry. Man, if they don't like this.
1174858|CDR|How's that?
1174859|LMP|Let me - Let me move back.
1174900|CDR|Okay. How's the time line, Bob?
1174909|CC|As far as I can tell, you guys are right on within a minute or 2.
1174916|LMP|They're just a little high for me, Geno.
1174918|CDR|Okay.
1174920|LMP|I'm not sure I can get it without getting way away.
1174922|CDR|Okay. Don't worry.
1174924|LMP|Somebody said it was going to be just behind the south end. (Laughter)
1174928|CDR|Okay. I'm going to take a little spin around here, and I'll meet you at the front end.
1174932|LMP|Okay.
1174935|CDR|Boy, there's a lot of static, though, everytime I start driving.
1175010|LMP|I know what that was over there, I think. Let me see. Whee! Okay, Houston. The basic material around the LM is just what I said, a fine-grained, medium-gray regolith-appearing material that is the standard area's population. The craters, though, bigger than about a meter in diameter, seem to - get to - rock fragments, which I haven't yet learned how to pick up.
1175105|CDR|Okay, Jack. I'm going to give them our position here. I think I know exactly where we are now.
1175112|LMP|Well, once you get them dirty, just like the boys say, it's hard to tell what they are.
1175119|CDR|Okay, Houston. I'm - I'm parked right next to Barjea. And we are, from Barjea, 12 o'clock - Jack, how far - oh, you can't see. You're looking, at the Sun. I guess about 150 meters due west of Barjea. And that's why we looked so close to Trident. I'm coming right up on Poppy. No question about where I am now. I've got Trident, and when I get up there - We are abeam of Trident 1, just where I said we were. I'm right at Poppy. We're about - oh, 100 meters just about due - due west of Poppy, which is almost in line with Barjea, of course, but basically, on that line, I think, between Rudolph and Trident 1. And, as I look at it in the cross section, about 100 meters - about 100 meters north of Trident 1. That's the landing point.
1175241|CDR|Sure get dirty fast. Jack, that is Trident right here that I - that we walked over to. (Laughing) I just got my first initiation to getting very dirty.
1175252|LMP|You sure did (laughter). Where are you? Are you ready to go?
1175256|CDR|I'm coming right around the front now. Houston, did you get that position?
1175300|CC|Roger. We copied that, Geno.
1175304|CDR|And Bob, I'm - I'm - I'm very firm of that now. I'm almost positive, unless I'm awfully mistaken about Trident. And I don't see how I could be from here. At the sacrifice of my cleanliness, Houston, the basic bright-colored rock type in the area looks very much like a cristobalite gabbros of the - I didn't see cristobalite, but it looks like the gabbros in the mare basalt sweep. The coarsegrained clinopyroxene plagioclase rocks.
1175348|CC|Okay. We have that.
1175351|CDR|Okay, I'm going to park - How about along side - Am I gonna screw up that little crater with glass in it if I park there?
1175400|LMP|Well, we will eventually.
1175403|CDR|Well, there's that one anyway. Let me park right here.
1175406|LMP|I'm sure we'll find some more.
1175407|CDR|Yes - Jack, where you been?
1175412|LMP|I fell down.
1175414|CDR|Okay, that's about close enough. isn't it.
1175416|LMP|Yes.
1175417|CDR|Okay, she is locked.
1175418|LMP|Here, let me get the 15-volt supply.
1175421|CDR|I think this camera is probably a little dirty on the lens. Okay, Houston. We're parked. No, the lens is okay. When you uncover one of those lens brushes, I want to use it on my visor. Oh, boy.
1175441|CDR|It just takes a little getting used to the 1/6 g, Jack.
1175444|LMP|I want to put this camera over here right now, because it's pretty dirty to put back in that bag. Okay, get to work.
1175456|CC|Roger. We copy that guys. You're about 7 minutes behind right now.
1175456|CDR|LRV front configure. Whoops. Hold it. Hold it.
1175503|CDR|What!? Okay, we'll catch up.
1175510|LMP|I haven't quite learned how to pick up rocks with my hands yet, Bob, or I would of had you a sample. That's why I fell down. My day will come (singing). Oh, oh! it's an old blue traverse gravimeter.
1175532|CDR|Okay. On the plains of Taurus-Littrow. What a valley. I'd like to cut down here, through here, with a T-38 sometime.
1175545|LMP|That'll be the day.
1175547|CDR|Yes, it will.
1175549|LMP|Whoa there.
1175551|CDR|You never know.
1175553|LMP|Friend of mine - -
1175554|CDR|Install LCRU, lock posts; I'll get that. Okay. That's the next big hooker, the LCRU.
1175603|LMP|Okay, geopallet's off the LM.
1175606|CC|Copy that.
1175609|CDR|You know, you just got to take it easy until you learn to work in 1/6th g.
1175613|LMP|Well, I haven't learned to pick up rocks, which is a very embarrassing thing for a geologist.
1175618|CDR|Yes, I look like an elephant stumbling around here.
1175626|CDR|Careful with the LCRU. One dust cover came off. Careful with this baby. That's the real one.
1175644|LMP|Boy, you sure move that Rover around when you do that.
1175657|LMP|Hey, the geopallet is locked on.
1175702|CC|Copy that.
1175727|LMP|I'm getting pretty good at throwing things; already.
1175758|CDR|Man, that thing won't want to go on. That's because it's not in there. Put it in right, and it goes on.
1175807|CDR|Okay, the power cable's on to TCU, Bob.
1175810|CC|Got that.
1175824|LMP|TGE is on. 22 - oh, you just want the last ones. Okay, 07.
1175834|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1175835|LMP|07.
1175842|CDR|God, the dirtiest checklist in the world. (laughter)
1175847|LMP|Doesn't take long, does it? Doesn't take long.
1175904|CDR|Manischewitz, look at that go! Did you see that?
1175907|LMP|I wish you'd be more careful.
1175909|CDR|What?
1175910|CDR|No, no, no! Not the television camera! (Laughter)
1175920|LMP|Okay.
1175922|CDR|It's warm out here, you know?
1175925|LMP|I'm certainly glad I got cool.
1175927|CDR|Okay, the TCU is locked in.
1175933|LMP|Houston, I've seen an awful lot of rocks, as I worked here. They look just like those pyroxene gabbros that I mentioned. The pyroxene's iridescent in the bright sun. The grain size is about - oh, between - maybe the mean is 2 millimeters, with max maybe up at 3 or 4. And it looks like predominantly a pyroxene plagioclase rock - clinopyroxene, but I haven't looked at it real closely.
1180012|PAO|Cernan mounting the television on the Rover now.
1180017|CDR|Okay, Jack. I set the rake on the - -
1180019|LMP|Beautiful.
1180020|CDR|- - on the seat. I just haven't learned - I'm getting more finesse now. I think you can overwork yourself, instead of making use of the 1/6 gravity.
1180033|LMP|Yes.
1180033|CDR|It's going to take a whole EVA to get familiar.
1180036|LMP|Well, I hope it doesn't.
1180039|CDR|I find I'm using my arms almost as much as I ever did. I remember the last time I was on the Moon - about 2 hours ago.
1180052|LMP|Okay, guess what? That old hammer goes to the gate top. The blue-handled hammer. What more could you want?
1180101|PAO|Schmitt is loading tools onto the Rover.
1180111|CDR|Okay, Bob. I'm getting a low gain out now.
1180115|CC|Okay. Copy on that.
1180134|LMP|... like the Rover, huh, Geno?
1180135|CDR|Beautiful.
1180135|LMP|I just couldn't feel it murmur when I pressed the breakers in. I could feel life in it, but - -
1180141|CDR|Hey, you let me down, sport. You let me down. There's a pin you didn't pull.
1180144|CDR|Okay, I'll let you get that; keep you honest.
1180149|LMP|Not only keep me honest. There.
1180206|LMP|Okay. Where am I? Okay. Gnomon's an island. Actually, up here, it's a geometric reference for photogramat - grat - photogrammetry.
1180222|CDR|Would you believe that the doggone antenna - here - Jack. When I bend this, pull the -
1180233|LMP|Okay.
1180234|CDR|Pull the antenna.
1180235|LMP|Rather awkward.
1180236|CDR|Pull the - pull the antenna. I got to open it up to get it out.
1180239|LMP|Okay. Big connector, you know.
1180241|CDR|Yes, connector was wedged in there.
1180244|LMP|Well, that's probably the way it was designed.
1180247|CDR|Boy, don't drop any of those connectors on the - -
1180250|LMP|Look at that go.
1180252|CDR|- - in the dust. We'll never clean them out.
1180258|LMP|Dum dee dum dum dum. (singing)
1180305|CDR|Good thing we're well coordinated human beings.
1180308|LMP|Man, I can't believe - yes I can.
1180311|CDR|Okay, let's see. Do it right now.
1180313|LMP|Yes, I can.
1180317|CDR|See that?
1180319|LMP|Yes.
1180320|CDR|Which way are you going to put it on?
1180322|LMP|Well, I thought maybe I would put it on that way, so I will put it on this way, because that's probably right.
1180327|CDR|If you put it on right, you're going to disappoint me.
1180337|LMP|Oh, I hate to touch - touch the old gnomon. I'll do my best, to please.
1180348|CDR|Very bad general - -
1180350|LMP|Okay, Bob the low gain is - -
1180351|CDR|- - will never forgive me.
1180352|LMP|- - low gain is hooked up.
1180356|CC|Okay. We copy the low gain hooked up.
1180403|PAO|EVA has been underway an hour and 3 minutes, now.
1180421|LMP|Dum da dum dum (singing) The rake - the rake is on the extension handle.
1180436|CC|Roger, 17.
1180440|LMP|My king - my kingdom for a scoop.
1180448|CDR|The scoop is on the extension handle. Different extension handle's of course.
1180454|LMP|Go ahead Bob. Were you calling?
1180457|CC|Roger. And your exuberance is showing up on the BTUs. You're running a little high on those.
1180505|CDR|Okay.
1180507|LMP|Exuberance! I've never been calmer in my life ...
1180513|CDR|Okay, let's get - we'll take it easy, Bob. I think it's a great deal a part to just get accustomed to handling yourself in zero gravity, the only vice on the Moon.
1180524|CC|Roger. I thought you were at 1/6 g.
1180529|CDR|Yes. You know where we are, whatever.
1180535|LMP|Okay, old sample bag -
1180541|CDR|Sample containment bag, sample collection bag, or whatever. ... What is this thing called crazy (singing). Come on. Okay, that's there. Some of the simplest things in the world you forget. Okay, let's get this one right this time.
1180627|LMP|You did a great job of parking, so I was standing in a hole.
1180632|CDR|Don't want to mess up all those good looking craters around here.
1180644|LMP|Oop! Hang on there accessory staff. Accessory staff, huh? Most staffs are accessory I've learned.
1180654|LMP|Okay, Bob the high gain is up and connected.
1180657|CC|Okay. Copy that. Beautiful.
1180659|LMP|And raised.
1180703|CDR|Okay.
1180703|LMP|Cable is to staff. See if I can't get your TV camera.
1180708|CC|We're waiting with breathless anticipation.
1180711|LMP|Ah, let's keep them in - -
1180715|CDR|Well, how is my cooling doing? I'd like to stay on intermediate, Bob. I feel pretty comfortable. I'm not cold but I'm pleasant.
1180723|LMP|Pleasant, ha! He thinks he's pleasant.
1180724|CC|You're fine, no problem; your option, Geno.
1180726|CDR|Okay, I just don't want to run out of consumables about 6 or 7 hours.
1180736|LMP|You're about as - Oh well. Okay. I don't think it makes any difference. You got to use the heat. Matter of fact, that's one of the little known facts of this business, Gene.
1180749|CDR|Okay, here we go. Coming up. I've got the TV camera in my hand, Bob. Oh man. Hey, Jack, just stop. You owe yourself 30 seconds to look up over the South Massif and look at the Earth.
1180806|LMP|What? The Earth?
1180809|CDR|Just look up there.
1180810|LMP|You seen one Earth, you've seen them all.
1180812|CDR|No you haven't, babe. When you begin to believe that. Come on camera, go in there ...
1180822|LMP|I'll look in a minute, Gene. But I tell you, once I start this little operation, if I don't finish it, it never gets done.
1180831|CDR|Okay, get in there. Okay, that's in there. That's in there.
1180839|CDR|Camera is locked down. Okay, ..., TCU, sunshade the camera and then the cable. Okay, let me get the sunshade.
1180854|LMP|Woo! That's always more of a job than it ought to be. However, SCB-3 is on the handhold.
1180907|CDR|I think I'm getting smarter about 1/6 g.
1180914|LMP|That gate works great. Snaps in, snaps closed with the slightest flick of a coordinated wrist. Where is that camera anyway?
1180923|CDR|Oh, it's over here. Oh, boy. I just still barely see the scissors.
1180932|LMP|I ought to get those.
1180935|CDR|Yes, but when we go hungry.
1180936|LMP|I'm not sure I can.
1180937|CDR|Okay, don't. Okay, we'll - we'll get them when we get the tongs out, Jack.
1180940|LMP|Yes.
1180940|CDR|There are some tongs in the Rover, and I'll come over and get them in a minute.
1180944|CC|Roger, Challenger. And we refrained from mentioning that to Ron.
1180951|CDR|Tell him - Tell him I hope he's enjoying our scissors. Okay, Bob, the TV is connected to the TCU electrically. The sunshade is on. I've got to deploy the high gain.
1181009|LMP|Okay, now, well let's see how smart you are. That was a pretty good attitude you parked at.
1181018|CDR|Okay, Jack is the high gain away from my antenna. Can you see?
1181024|LMP|Let me turn around. Yes. You're clear.
1181030|CDR|Okay, it's locked. Locked. Now let me see if I can find beautiful big dot up there. I know what I'm going to have to do. I'm going to have to get the, oh, I got it right there. Might be able to peak that but I got that.
1181057|LMP|You hit it, huh?
1181101|CDR|Put my hand over it, so I could see it.
1181104|LMP|Hey, that's an interesting problem. Your seat won't stay up.
1181109|CDR|How about that piece of Velcro there.
1181111|LMP|That's just what I'm working on there. Great minds think alike. Okay, that goes in there. The trouble is to reach it, I've got -
1181146|CDR|Okay, I'll bet you it says put MAG Bravo.
1181149|LMP|Oh, yours is in a circle.
1181151|CDR|Okay, check LCRU. Deploy LCRU with antenna. Okay. Deploy the LCRU with antenna. Blanket's open 100 percent.
1181214|LMP|Come on, baby, open. Ponna, it goes.
1181220|CDR|Oh, are those mirrors nice. I hope they stay that way for a while.
1181224|LMP|They won't. John and Charlie know exactly what we're talking about. Mark my words.
1181237|CDR|Okay, I'm going to close the circuit breaker, Bob.
1181243|CDR|Okay, circuit breaker is CLOSED.
1181246|CC|Copy that.
1181246|CDR|POWER switch is INTERNAL. POWER switch is INTERNAL. Okay, let me give you some - some numbers. AGC is 3 point - about 3.4; temp is about 1.8; and power is about 2.1. Okay; POWER to EXTERNAL.
1181318|CC|We caught those, Geno.
1181322|CDR|Okay, POWER is EXTERNAL. MODE SWITCH is going to two FM/TV. Okay. Man, did you peak out at signal strength of 40.
1181334|LMP|I can't see right now, but I think I've still got you right in the center.
1181340|CDR|Okay, POWER switch on to TCU. Okay, it's on to TCU. Okay, AGC and POWER. Yes sir, Bob, I'm verifying at 40. That's a good Navy term, 40 on the AGC.
1181359|CC|Copy that.
1181402|CDR|And the TV is all yours.
1181403|PAO|We've got a picture coming in.
1181404|CC|Roger. Have you got a power reading there for us there Geno?
1181406|CDR|I hope. Okay, I'll give you a power reading, EXTERNAL, if you want it. I'll give you - TEMP is still about 17 and POWER is about 18 on EXTERNAL.
1181420|CC|Hey, we have a picture, 17. We have a picture.
1181423|CDR|You have? Beautiful, babe. It's all yours. I hope it moves now.
1181429|CC|It does.
1181430|CDR|I hope it moves. You'll find out - hey! it moves. It's alive.
1181436|CC|And.
1181436|CDR|Okay, Bob, I'm going to get SRC 1.
1181439|CC|Okay, could we have a EMU check on you fellows when convenient?
1181445|CDR|Okay. Commander is 3.8 plus. I'm - I must be 80 percent and no flags and no tones.
1181456|CC|Copy that.
1181458|LMP|Okay, LMP is - LMP is about 80, let me see - 75, about 80 percent, and no flags, no tones. I've got 83 percent.
1181521|CC|Okay, copy that. And you've sure got a lot of stuff on the Rover already.
1181528|LMP|Yes, MAG Helen has just gone into the bag - into the seat.
1181533|CC|Copy that.
1181539|PAO|That was Jack Schmitt on the screen.
1181544|LMP|MAG Cynthia is in there.
1181552|CDR|Okay, Bob, SRC 1 is open.
1181557|LMP|Gail is in.
1181608|CDR|Jack, watch these SRCs. I don't like the lock on this cable very well.
1181611|LMP|They never have.
1181624|CC|Okay, and Jack. You did get that mag?.
1181625|LMP|Okay.
1181626|CC|Charlie as well?
1181630|LMP|That's affirm.
1181631|CC|Okay. And we did not copy your cuff gauge reading down here.
1181638|LMP|Oh, you didn't? Well, maybe that's because I didn't give it to you. 3.9, no wonder that's so much work.
1181645|CC|Go ahead. Copy that.
1181654|CDR|Okay, Bob, SRC 1 is - She sure won't stay in the MESA ...
1181704|LMP|Let me try that. Okay, that will stay there.
1181708|CDR|Okay, Bob. It's closed. It sure doesn't seem like it wants to stay there, though. And the organic sample has been sealed.
1181716|CC|Copy that.
1181716|CDR|I guess you believe we're here now, huh?
1181718|CC|Now we believe you're here. We see you in person.
1181720|CDR|Okay. Bob, the - Bob, the SRC cover will not stay closed. It just slowly springs up. There's nothing I can seem to do for it. I might be able to set something, a blanket, on top or something.
1181735|CC|Okay, stand by on that. We'll get back with you.
1181739|CDR|Okay. I'm putting - yes, it just flops open. I'm taking SCB 1 to the Tool Gate.
1181748|CC|Copy that.
1181749|CDR|I'll get me a hammer, and I'll give you a gravimeter reading.
1181752|LMP|No, you won't. Not until you're done. I'll go get the flag there. Guess what? We're here again.
1181804|PAO|Cernan has the red band around his arm.
1181808|LMP|The Buddy SLSS is on the Rover. Okay, ETB. Okay, CDR's camera film magazine I had to work on a little bit to get it to work but it's working.
1181829|CC|Copy that.
1181832|LMP|If I get that camera, you can punch the gravimeter, I think.
1181837|CDR|Okay. Get the camera, and I'll give them a gravimeter reading. is that all you need? Because I'll go get the flag.
1181844|LMP|Okay, you'd better let that - yes, but why don't when you go - let me get some tongs, too. We need to salvage those - -
1181854|CDR|Okay.
1181855|LMP|- - scissors.
1181903|CDR|Okay.
1181904|LMP|Okay. Let me steady the Rover ...
1181907|CDR|Okay, Bob.
1181909|CDR|MARK: Gravimeter and the light is flashing.
1181913|CC|Okay. We copy that.
1181924|LMP|Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie. Where the coyotes howl, and the wind blows free. (Singing) Okay.
1181936|CDR|Okay, where am I?
1181938|LMP|You're doing a gravimeter, getting the flag. I've got your camera. I'm going to salvage the scissors.
1181942|CDR|Okay, get the scissors, and I'll be putting the flag in. And don't no near the Rover.
1181949|LMP|Don't go near the water. That reminds me of a good book. Oh boy. I can't go near the Rover.
1182011|CDR|Let me tell you.
1182012|LMP|No, I can't go near the Rover.
1182014|CDR|Why don't you set them - -
1182015|LMP|How about you letting me stick these in your pocket with your - -
1182018|CDR|No. Set them up there. Just set them in there. We'll get them when we come back in.
1182022|LMP|Okay. I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
1182025|CDR|Just set them inside the - put them in the -
1182030|LMP|I'm going to hang them here on the hook.
1182031|CDR|Okay, that's good.
1182033|LMP|Right there.
1182035|CDR|Okay, Jack. How about the flag right over here in this little mound?
1182043|LMP|Which mound?
1182043|CDR|Well, let me take a look around.
1182044|LMP|How about right up there on that little high point. Right up in here where I'm going.
1182047|CDR|Yes. Of course, your idea of a high point might be different than mine.
1182052|LMP|I meant the North Massif. (Laughter)
1182055|CDR|That's probably the best place in the world for the flag, is right up on the top.
1182100|LMP|Okay, let me come over and help you. How about right - how about right? Well, we'll find out ...
1182106|PAO|The flag they're deploying is the flag that has been in the mission control center here during past missions.
1182113|CDR|Yes. Hey, you're in the edge of the crater though, That's no test.
1182116|LMP|Well, that's all right. Move right over here near your tire tracks.
1182119|CDR|Yes. This is a high point right here.
1182121|LMP|Yes, that's good. Right there.
1182124|CDR|Well, that wasn't too good.
1182126|LMP|Okay, let me give it a few whacks. Oh, baloney.
1182134|CDR|Okay. Watch your fingers. Now that wasn't too bad. Want to make sure it stands up. That's getting pretty - I can - I - well - we'll - we can probably - what we could do - I don't know how far we could drill - -
1182147|LMP|Boing! I think you hit something solid with that one.
1182151|CDR|No, it was still going.
1182152|LMP|Yes, but did you ever see it vibrate like that?
1182153|CDR|No, I've never put a flag up on the Moon before.
1182157|LMP|What? Pull that end.
1182202|CDR|(Laughter) You'll have to get it down to my level. Tall guys are all alike.
1182208|LMP|Wait, I'm not through.
1182212|CDR|Okay. How about getting it stretched out?
1182218|LMP|I will. I Just can't start forward as fast as I would like to. Hate to touch it, my hands are so dirty.
1182236|CDR|Okay?
1182239|LMP|Well, it's going to want to curl. Maybe it'll - it sort of looks like it's waving in the breeze.
1182246|CDR|Yes sir. How about right there?
1182254|LMP|Take a couple this way, and we'll take a couple that way. How's that?
1182257|CDR|Oh, I ought to get - let me get over to the other side - you can get the Rover in the background.
1182259|LMP|Yeah, and the LM.
1182304|CDR|It does wave when you do that.
1182309|CC|We've got a beautiful picture of you guys up - down there.
1182315|CDR|Let me tell you, Bob. This flag is a beautiful picture. You see that?
1182320|LMP|Okay, you're - it's partially covering the Rover, but I think it's a pretty good shot. How's that? Let me get the focus right.
1182336|LMP|I don't know where to put it.
1182337|CDR|There you go. Wait a minute.
1182340|LMP|It's all right I got you reaching for the flag.
1182343|CDR|How's that?
1182347|LMP|That's very good, Gene. Let me get it in stereo.
1182351|CDR|Houston - -
1182353|LMP|That's beautiful.
1182355|CDR|This has got to be one of the most proud moments of my life. I guarantee you. Let you get a close in one and we'll trade cameras. Houston, I don't know how many of you are aware of this, but this - this flag has flown in the MOCR since Apollo 11. And we very proudly deploy it on the Moon, to stay for as long as it can, in honor of all those people who have worked so hard to put us here and to put every other crew here and to make the country, United States and mankind, something different than it was.
1182452|CC|Roger, 17 - And presuming to speak on behalf of some of those who work in the MOCR, we thank you very much.
1182505|CDR|Back right where you were. Step to the right. Right there.
1182519|LMP|Yes, that's alright. I'll keep it down.
1182535|LMP|Stay there. Get closer. I'm going to get on the other side.
1182546|CDR|Well, I want to get something here.
1182549|LMP|What's that?
1182550|CDR|I want to get the Earth.
1182552|LMP|Okay. Let me get over here.
1182554|CDR|Get around on that side.
1182557|LMP|I don't - I don't think it's going - you're a little close, maybe. Get them both in focus.
1182610|CDR|That might do it. Try that one time, then we'll give up and get to work.
1182628|LMP|Higher up a little - yes.
1182634|LMP|Let me try it again, okay? I don't know, Geno, okay? Let me get over here closer to you. Okay. That might have got it.
1182649|CDR|Okay, very good.
1182651|LMP|Okay.
1182653|CDR|Alright, let's do it. You think your gravimeter's ready so I can go back there?
1182702|CC|Roger, 17. The gravimeter's ready and a couple of words here. One, I presume you found the scissors, right?
1182711|LMP|Yes, sir.
1182712|CC|Okay. Two -
1182712|CDR|Not Ron's, we found ours.
1182715|CC|Roger. And the second thing is we do want the SRC closed. And if you can partially latch it, I'm not sure tha't easily done, that would be one solution. The other would be to put something on top of it to hold it closed.
1182731|CDR|Okay, Bob. I'll find something.
1182732|CC|Okay, copy that. One of the brackets off the MESA would be something, or a rock that's nearby; that's another possibility.
1182744|LMP|Okay. Gene, what are you going to be up to now?
1182748|CDR|I'm going to go get the - -
1182749|LMP|... pallet?
1182750|CDR|- - pallet.
1182751|LMP|Okay, why don't - why don't I give the old - the old inspection here - bit. And I really ought to have my camera, shouldn't I?
1182802|CDR|I need a - -
1182803|LMP|Yes.
1182804|CC|Roger. That's affirmative.
1182804|CDR|... on this.
1182806|LMP|What would you just -
1182808|CDR|Well, I'll find something.
1182810|LMP|I'll take the old CDR's camera. Not a bad camera to take.
1182816|CDR|Jack, I'm going to take the old gunny sack here, and put it over. That'll hold it down.
1182826|CC|I presume you're talking about the big bag, Gene.
1182831|CDR|Yes, the big bag that was on the ladder. That's all it needs. It's just a little bit. There's just enough spring force in it. Okay, Houston. I think you've had all the good words about the LM. We have never flown a better LM. I guess that's safe enough to say. T he quads look great. The old steerables are aimed right at you. Rendezvous radar's in good shape. It's parked - looks like parallel to Z. Just about perfectly. There's no visible - I'm on the 3 o'clock position, plus Y. No visible contamination. There's a little bit of discoloration of the plume shield below the thrusters. The engine bell never touched the ground. It's about - 15 centimeters off the ground.
1182929|CC|How's that for coming down gentle?
1182930|CDR|That's what you call okay number three wire, Jack.
1182935|LMP|Hey, we never heard what our landing parameters were.
1182939|CC|We'll worry about that later.
1182940|CDR|... now that we're here.
1182941|LMP|Oh, but they always - they always give them to us in the simulator. Hey, Bob, judging from what I see on my clock, we're not but about 5 minutes behind.
1182959|CC|That agrees more or less with the way we read it.
1183004|LMP|Gene had a little forward motion as I think you heard his call. And that shows up in the forward footpad at any rate or did. It looks like he may have hit tail first a little bit. That's embedded to the full pad depth. I see no - By George, Gene, you may have had a first. I think you stroked that thing.
1183032|CDR|I stroked what?
1183033|LMP|The rear - the rear landing gear.
1183038|CDR|Well, we can measure it and find out.
1183040|LMP|I'll take a picture of it.
1183046|CDR|May have stroked it. The Mylar, the lower orange Mylar, is folded a little bit.
1183053|CC|Roger. There's words floating around down here about a typical Navy landing, but I'm not sure whether we believe it or not.
1183100|LMP|He caught his tail hook. Say, Bob - -
1183103|CC|That's the best way.
1183112|LMP|- - Just behind the LM in that very fresh crater, I picked up an example of the kind of gabbro I was talking about. And I'll stick it in the big bag, except the big bag has disappeared.
1183135|CDR|Okay, I've got to give you a reading, Bob, if you're ready.
1183137|CC|Ready.
1183139|LMP|You put the big bag up - -
1183141|CDR|670 003 101. That's 670 003 101.
1183149|CC|Okay. We copy that.
1183152|CDR|Jack, I put that there to hold the SRC down.
1183156|LMP|That's alright, I just put our sample in it. It's in the bottom of the bag. It's about 8 by 5 centimeters by 3 centimeters. Slightly tabular.
1183207|CC|Okay. We copy that. It's in the big bag.
1183211|LMP|Yes sir.
1183218|CDR|Okay, okay, Bob. A MARK on gravity.
1183222|CC|Copy that.
1183224|CDR|And the light is flashing.
1183226|CC|Copy that.
1183240|CDR|I've got to tell you, Bob. I haven't done everything there is to do in the Navy, but deploying that flag has got to be the most proud thing I'll ever do in my life. If you could see, and you could see it from where we are, I know you'd feel the same way.
1183257|CC|Roger on that, Geno.
1183258|LMP|Woo! (Laughter)
1183259|CDR|God, he's pretty up there. God, you're pretty up there over the South Massif. Beautiful.
1183307|LMP|Hope nobody saw that.
1183309|CDR|Beautiful.
1183309|LMP|Oh, they were watching me. (Laughter) Those finks. Okay, you weren't doing anything with this gravimeter on here, I hope.
1183317|CDR|No, its on the deck.
1183318|LMP|Okay.
1183318|CC|Okay, you might grab me a ... when you set it on there, Jack.
1183325|LMP|Too late. Bob.
1183326|CC|Okay.
1183326|LMP|I'll get it later.
1183327|CC|We'll get it later. No hurry.
1183332|CDR|Okay, now if I can figure how to get this off. You've got to educate us again.
1183338|LMP|We may not remember those. Whoops.
1183343|CDR|Bob, the sceptre's in hand.
1183345|CC|Roger on that.
1183358|LMP|Okay. I'll give you a temperature. Let's see whether it fits. I'll bet it does.
1183414|PAO|They're unloading the surface experiments, now.
1183419|CDR|Come on. Lock, baby. Okay, it's ON -
1183424|CC|Copy that.
1183425|CDR|It's LOCKED.
1183426|CC|Roger.
1183427|LMP|Okay, Bob. Here's a temperature for you. Forty degrees.
1183435|CC|Say again.
1183436|LMP|40.
1183437|CC|Copy that.
1183443|CDR|Both covers. Okay, number 1 - something over here. Never did figure out what. Okay, Bob, the shade is deployed facing deep space.
1183507|CC|Oh, Copy. Roger. Understand the cosmic rays.
1183514|CDR|Okay, Bob. The antenna is deployed. It's not on the post yet, but it's deployed.
1183544|LMP|Oh, oh, come on. Don't get - don't get all caught on something. That's better, that's better. Okay, Bob. I think - just about got a - the sunside deployed, just as perpendicular to the Sun as I think anybody could do.
1183610|CC|Okay. Copy that. Good enough.
1183615|LMP|Okay, I don't have any pictures yet, so you might put that down as something to get later.
1183619|CC|Yes, we'll catch that in the PAN with the next EVA or something like that.
1183622|LMP|Man if that - Boy, if that antenna doesn't get some noise from outer space, I don't know what will. If they are out there, and they are I'm sure. They'll see that one. That is even weirder looking out here than it is in the high bay. Hey, Bob, before I leave the ALSEP, remind me to check the cosmic ray. I might hit it here in the process of deployment.
1183655|CC|Okay, try not to.
1183657|LMP|I got a little close.
1183658|CC|Okay.
1183700|CDR|Oh, I will. Okay, the doors are open, beautifully.
1183719|LMP|I don't know what talent you have for landing in holes, Cernan, but once again I'll be doing all the ALSEP work in the hole.
1183730|CDR|Okay.
1183730|CC|Are you saying we should have kept the pulleys there, Jack?
1183737|LMP|Okay. Yes, I need the pulleys.
1183740|CDR|You know, Bob, I've got a little bit of a problem here. I've got the SEP connector on. (Laughter) But it - it - it'll - it'll - it'll slide - slide down in, but the locking cover just won't go over.
1183758|CC|Roger, Geno. Understand. It slides in far enough, you think it's aligned, huh?
1183805|CDR|Yes, I'm positive it's aligned. It just - it didn't appear to lock over, well not appear, it just won't lock over. I'm shoving it home. Okay, I got it.
1183816|CC|Okay. Copy.
1183816|CDR|I got it. Makes everyone happier.
1183818|CC|I'm glad we have the right solution to that one, Gene.
1183823|CDR|The right solution is the fact that you've got a man here doing it.
1183827|CC|Laughter.
1183828|CDR|Okay. Hey, Bob. The ECA TEMP MONITOR switch is ON.
1183834|CC|Copy that.
1183838|PAO|Cernan working with the surface electrical properties receiver on the Rover.
1183903|LMP|There's an easy way and a hard to do everything. Don't know why we don't do it the easy way. Payday. RTG is on the surface.
1183928|CC|Copy that.
1183928|LMP|Central station is ... Gene's little pitch-up makes these things slide out by themselves almost.
1183939|CC|Better thank him next time you see him.
1183950|CDR|Okay. Hey, Jack, you notice there's none of those guys up there holding those hoses as we go around the LM.
1184002|LMP|What do you mean? I saw one just a minute ago.
1184005|CDR|Okay, Bob. You want 4, 5, 6, and 7?
1184009|CC|That's affirmative.
1184009|CDR|Okay, 4, 5, 6, and 7. It's coming off.
1184015|CC|Roger on that.
1184019|CDR|Okay.
1184024|PAO|That was a reference to the help they have during simulations.
1184038|CDR|Just took time out for a snack and a little water.
1184042|CC|Okay.
1184045|CDR|Okay the - How's the TV working?
1184055|CC|Beautiful - To coin a phrase, it's a panoramic scene of beauty.
1184105|LMP|Oh, come on now, Bob.
1184108|CDR|Say, Bob, what do you think of the terrain?
1184111|CC|Looks flat. Looks very flat and smooth.
1184119|CDR|That's why you're an astronomer.
1184121|LMP|That's why you're - (laughter). Oh, well.
1184124|CDR|Okay, I'll give you a reading on the TGE if you're ready.
1184128|CC|Roger, ready.
1184132|CDR|Oh, don't kick dust on it. Hope I can read it down here. Okay. Oh Bob. Bob, you're going to have to bear with me. When I leaned over to punch it, I hit GRAVITY instead of READ, so I guess I got to wait it out.
1184158|CC|Okay. We'll set the timer again.
1184202|CDR|Okay, I'll - I should have been more - more careful. Okay. Orient pallet to the Sun. If you can see it, it's directly at the Sun so that ought to be good.
1184214|CC|Okay, copy that.
1184222|CDR|The SRC doesn't have to be all the way closed does it?
1184225|CC|No, Not all the way. Just as long as it's most of the way closed. You can have a crack there in the top.
1184233|CDR|Okay, that's what it is. Man, I'll tell you. This - this thing got low all of a sudden. How are you coming, Jack?
1184249|LMP|Great.
1184251|CDR|You get it fueled yet?
1184252|LMP|Oh no. Okay, coming soon though.
1184256|CDR|Let me know if you have any problems with that.
1184259|LMP|Oh, I will.
1184300|CDR|Okay. Come on bag. You're all I got. Man, I - there we go. (singing) Bob, that gravimeter went right to steady. It blinked once and went right to steady, so I don't expect it'll be too long.
1184324|CC|Okay, I'll give you a call in a couple of minutes there. Ought to be done.
1184331|CDR|Okay.
1184332|CC|And Jack. I understand you have the RTG fueled?
1184338|LMP|Negative.
1184339|CC|Okay.
1184340|LMP|I'm supposed to call you when I have it fueled.
1184344|CC|Okay.
1184345|CDR|Jack, do you have a - am I missing a map I should have up here?
1184350|LMP|There should be two maps. They're under the seat. I put them in there so they wouldn't bounce off. I'm sorry. I forgot to tell you.
1184356|CDR|Okay, I got them.
1184403|CDR|Hello, Houston.
1184408|CC|Hello, Challenger.
1184420|LMP|I wish I could go back and make that landing about 6 or 7 times so I could take in all that I missed.
1184426|CDR|So do I. I might as well have stayed at the Cape. Okay. Let's see. Core bore neutron flux, and I'll get the drill and I'll go back and ...
1184439|CC|Okay, and Geno, you know you might wander by the gravimeter. I think it might be done by now. You might just check the light and see if it's steady, or on or not.
1184450|CDR|Okay. I'll go by there right now, Bob.
1184528|LMP|For future reference Bob, the dome removal tool doesn't - it'll turn. Shoot.
1184552|CDR|Okay, Bob, let's see. It's not lit. Can I take a reading?
1184556|CC|Roger. If the light's out, give us a reading.
1184601|CDR|Well, let's see if I can push the right button this time. Okay, it's 670 017 201, 670 017 201. And it was about 75 percent in the shade of the Rover.
1184619|CC|Okay. I copy that. And now we're ready for bias.
1184624|CDR|Now, you want - okay, a bias coming at you on the ground, correct?
1184628|CC|Roger.
1184631|CDR|It's blinking - it's blinking, Bob.
1184633|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1184634|CDR|I've got the core bag and the neutron flux, and -
1184635|LMP|Gene, I need your hammer.
1184637|CDR|Okay, you need my help? Okay, coming over. What's the problem?
1184647|LMP|Well, the dome removal tool never latched into the dome, but it turned it. I think it's pretty badly chewed up. I'm not sure what happened.
1184658|CDR|Oh, boy.
1184659|LMP|So, let me have your hammer because I'm going to have to pry off the dome.
1184702|CDR|Can't you - -
1184704|LMP|No. I - I, you see I - I've stripped it, I think. I didn't think I could do it.
1184712|CDR|No, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Let me -
1184714|LMP|See, it's stripped. See, but it's open. Wait a minute. See, no wait, see? Just put your blade in there. Don't touch it. Put the blade in there and pry. It'll come, I hope.
1184733|CDR|Be careful. Here, let me get it once from this side. Can I -
1184738|LMP|Gene, don't get so close. Move your hand - There, you got it. Nice work.
1184747|CDR|Okay, it's off. It's off.
1184750|LMP|Nice work.
1184751|CDR|Whoo.
1184752|CC|Roger. Once again we have the right solution.
1184757|LMP|I'm not sure, Bob, what happened. You might ask them that if you only partially get the dome removal tool on, if you can strip the whole thing out?
1184808|CC|Okay, we'll look at it ...
1184808|LMP|It won't make much difference any more.
1184810|CC|We'll make sure of its change on the next dome removal tool.
1184823|CDR|Bob, I'm just taking a breather.
1184825|CC|Okay, we're watching you.
1184827|LMP|That was a strange one, Gene. Did you see how I mangled that thing?
1184831|CDR|Yes.
1184832|LMP|Okay, RTG is out.
1184834|CDR|Don't trip.
1184836|LMP|Wouldn't think of it.
1184837|CDR|Okay, where was I? I've got to go back and get the drill, if I'm not mistaken. Yes sir, and then I'll be caught up with the TGE. Okay, Houston. The RTG is inserted. The element, that is -
1184855|CC|Okay, We'll copy that.
1184902|CDR|Bob , I'll - I'll give you my word. Before we leave here, I'll make sure that the SRC is closed.
1184908|CC|Okay. Copy that. As long as it's got only an inch or two showing there, should be no problem. That looks fine ...
1184917|CDR|Man, I've got to put something on it to get it down to that far.
1184920|CC|Okay.
1184922|CDR|Okay.
1184926|CDR|Oh, that came out like a dream. Man, is this MESA low when you go - Come on, baby.
1184932|LMP|SEQ bay doors are closed.
1184934|CC|Roger. Copy that.
1184935|LMP|And I'm checking out the cosmic ray. Cosmic ray looks good.
1184942|CC|Beautiful.
1184946|LMP|Oh! I snuck a queek - quick peek at the drill, and it does work. What in the world is that?
1184956|CDR|That's Ron.
1184959|LMP|Ron?
1185000|CDR|That's Ron. Got his VHF on, that fink. Hey, you might tell Ron we can hear him.
1185011|PAO|The command module is over the landing site.
1185016|CDR|Okay. Drill - LMP seat. With seat belt - Bob, you still with us?
1185026|LMP|Okay, the ALSEP is put together in the barbell mode. And Charlie Duke, I have checked it - and it is locked.
1185038|CDR|Hello, there, Ron. If you read, we're reading you.
1185051|CDR|Well, (singing) "We're off to see the Wizard."
1185055|LMP|Hey, do you need me, Gene?
1185057|CDR|No.
1185058|LMP|I'm going to go deploy an ALSEP.
1185100|CDR|Have at it.
1185101|LMP|First, I've got to find an ALSEP site.
1185105|CDR|Don't fall into Camelot.
1185110|CDR|Okay, Bob. I'd like to read a TGE.
1185113|CC|Roger. You're ready to read the TGE - we are.
1185119|CDR|Oh, you won't believe it.
1185123|LMP|You did it again.
1185124|CDR|Ah - there goes a fender. Oh, shoot!
1185129|LMP|Say, Bob, I'm moving down-Sun.
1185133|CDR|Well, I'll get that in a minute.
1185135|LMP|I'm moving down-Sun, and where we've walked, we stir up darker material - just slightly, but it's darker. The same old thing, the most mature - that most regoliths have.
1185149|CC|Okay, copy that. Have you got a bias reading there, Gene?
1185154|CDR|Yes, I'm giving it to you right now - 337, 454, 001 - that's 337, 454, 001
1185205|CC|Okay, we copy that.
1185205|CDR|And I hate to say it, but I'm going to have to take some time to try - I'm going to have to - I'm going to have to try to get that fender back on.
1185212|CC|Okay. Was it the rear fender, Geno?
1185216|CDR|Yes. Caught it with my hammer, and it just popped right off.
1185223|CDR|Bob, for future reference - it's a piece of cake putting the TGE on and off.
1185227|CC|Okay, copy that.
1185235|CDR|Jack, is the tape under my seat, do you remember?
1185237|LMP|Yes.
1185238|CDR|I may need it. Okay. Let's set my hydroxide canister to middle - I'm in MAX - MAX cooling. Man, you're romping around like a - how are you doing?
1185253|LMP|Oh, fine. It's just - it's work going out here.
1185256|CDR|Yea, I'll bet it is. Just take it easy.
1185258|LMP|I am.
1185259|CDR|I'm going to be a little bit behind you if I have to work on that fender, anyway.
1185302|CC|Yes, you can walk a bit more slowly than you're walking, Jack.
1185304|LMP|Okay, more and more - What's that?
1185309|CC|I said that you can walk more slowly than you started out, anyway.
1185317|LMP|Bob, texturially, same of these rocks that I believe - gabbros - have a texture not unlike a - a welded tuff. But I don't think - I know they're not. But they've got some mottled characteristics to them that I haven't yet figured out.
1185347|PAO|Schmitt carrying the ALSEP about 100 meters east of LM.
1185412|CMP|Yes, if it wasn't for that fender, I'd be ready to go. Makes me sort of mad.
1185419|PAO|Gene Cernan will drive out to the ALSEP site in the Rover.
1185435|CC|I say there, Jack, that looks like a big rock there beyond you.
1185442|LMP|That's the one we were talking about. Earlier.
1185445|CC|We believe you now.
1185454|CDR|Well, I've done this in training. I can't say I'm very adept at putting fenders back on. But I sure don't want to start without it.
1185527|CDR|Well, shoot!
1185543|LMP|Okay, Bob. I think I'm going to move a little bit to the northwest of my present position in order to get a little farther away from that big rock.
1185555|CC|Okay, Jack.
1185556|LMP|And to get out of the shallow depression - -
1185600|CC|Roger.
1185600|LMP|- - get out of the shallow depression that's here.
1185603|CC|Roger. It's not so shallow. You disappeared out of sight from the last ...
1185610|LMP|Well it's shallow relative to other depressions I've been in. You know, this ALSEP is almost as heavy as what we had at the Cape. Uh oh, I lost one of my blocks. Oh well, I'll - I'll get it on a rock.
1185640|CDR|Or I'll retrace your steps.
1185642|LMP|Don't worry about that. I'll be able to - there are enough rocks around. I can use it.
1185647|CC|Copy that, Jack. And Gene, if you're having trouble with that fender and you think it might be easier with two guys, you could wait until you get out to the ALSEP site.
1185657|CDR|No sir, I got it on, but a little piece of the rail is cracked off. And I'm just going to put a couple of pieces of good old-fashioned American gray tape on it - see whether we can't make sure it stays. Because I don't want to lose it. Except good old-fashioned gray tape doesn't want to stick very well.
1185729|LMP|I've not seen any sign of layering in any of the craters. In their walls.
1185739|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1185740|LMP|The rocks still seem to be the pinkish-gray - the pinkish-gray gabbro out here.
1185756|PAO|Gene Cernan taping the fender on.
1185804|CDR|Good old-fashioned American gray tape doesn't stick to lunar-dust-cover fenders. One more try. I think it'll stay, for an indefinite period of time, right now. Not bad for EV gloves.
1185837|LMP|Do you see me, Bob?
1185839|CC|We're watching Gene, right now. You disappeared out of sight a long while ago, Gene. Hey, you just came into sight again, Jack.
1185855|CDR|Hey, leave me enough room to deploy the heat flow.
1185857|LMP|I'm going to, I'm looking for a place. Away from craters and rocks.
1185905|LMP|That's why I didn't land up there.
1185913|LMP|Okay, I think I've got a place. And I think it will also give you a spot for the neutron flux that's sheltered from the RTG.
1185922|CC|Okay. You say you have a place like that, Jack?
1185928|LMP|Well, - pretty much, I think, Bob.
1185932|CC|Okay.
1185933|LMP|Let me work on it here a little more.
1185936|CC|Okay, and right now you're about 10 minutes behind the timeline, Jack.
1185948|LMP|Okay.
1185948|CDR|Bob, I'm only going to spend another minute or two on the fender.
1185953|LMP|We'll catch up.
1190000|CDR|I never thought I'd be out here doing this.
1190004|LMP|Boy, I'll tell you, Geno - Okay, I'm going to go back this way. Central Station can be near a crater. It will be pretty good, that'll put the LEAM right out over there, which is probably all right. The graviometer out over there, which is probably all right. Going to put your drill holes a little too close to that rock, though. Bob, ask Mark if he's worried about rocks as much as craters.
1190039|CC|Okay, stand by.
1190039|LMP|I've got a rock about 2 meters in diameter, partially buried - that one of the probes may be near.
1190050|CC|Stand by, and define near.
1190055|LMP|Well, it could be 10 feet.
1190058|CC|Okay.
1190106|LMP|Well, I can move a little more south, I guess.
1190109|CC|Okay. And Jack, it seems like about - if you're about 3 meters from the rock, that's no problem.
1190117|LMP|Okay. Okay, this is it.
1190124|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1190125|LMP|I tell you the block - the - let's see, the Sun's south, this way. South of east. Okay. Well, shoot!
1190159|CDR|What's wrong?
1190201|LMP|Well, it's just about impossible. Bob, it looks like the probes are going to be in a shallow depression. I'll try to improve that a little. It's not a real crater - it's just a shallow depression.
1190217|CC|Stand by. Stand by on that, Jack, a minute. That may be okay. Okay, shallow depression's all right, Jack, don't worry about it.
1190223|LMP|It's not more than a meter deep.
1190225|CC|That's okay, Jack.
1190226|LMP|Okay.
1190227|CC|Stay there.
1190231|LMP|All righty. It looks pretty good to me.
1190234|CC|Okay. Good enough.
1190236|LMP|It's just - Bob, it's really, in detail - The meter and half-meter scale relief is a little more than we can stand here for a good site. But I think - I think this will be all right.
1190254|CC|Okay, copy that. We're ready to press on with ALSEP INTERCONNECT. And Geno, how are you doing on that fender?
1190302|CDR|Bob, I am done. If that fender stays on, I'm going to take a picture of it because I'd like some sort of mending award. It's not too neat, but tape and lunar dust just don't hang in there together.
1190318|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1190325|CDR|Well, let's hope. Keep your fingers crossed, and I'll be more careful around the fenders.
1190330|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1190335|CDR|Whoops. Bob, I'm going to do one other thing real quick here. I've got to dust my visor off.
1190346|LMP|Gene, do you want me to do that?
1190347|CDR|No, I can do it. I'll just do it right here. Only have to do it in a couple of places right in front of me. That didn't do much good, did it. Someone should have told me that. That just really screwed it up. Okay. Bob, you might ought to be thinking of a good way to clean that visor when I get in the cabin.
1190415|CC|Okay, we'll put someone on that.
1190420|CDR|Okay, LRV equipment check. Blankets are open 100 percent; TV/sunshade is on; SEP receiver/antenna - nav cable; we've got 4, 5, 6, and 7 on the charges; TGE - I've got three measurements complete, I've got the drill, the bag, and the neutron flux. The TV camera - I'm taking it away from you.
1190439|CC|Okay. Roger.
1190443|CDR|Sorry about that, Ed. Okay. MODE switch is going to 1.
1190449|PAO|We'll loose the picture while Gene Cernan drives the Rover out to the ALSEP site. Get a picture back very shortly after he's parked the Rover.
1190449|CC|Roger.
1190450|CDR|Okay. MODE switch is 1. I'm ready to drive to the ALSEP site. Still want to park 60 northeast - east and north.
1190500|CC|Okay, Geno. And before you leave the LM there, how about giving me another BAT TEMP reading. Those were a little high and we'd like to try and verify some of that stuff.
1190513|CDR|Boy, oh boy. Yes, I get you Bob. Boy, oh boy. You just got to be careful where you kick dust.
1190527|LMP|That's right.
1190528|CDR|Boy! Don't do that again.
1190549|CDR|Yes, Bob, I thought they were a little high, too.
1190552|CC|Roger.
1190558|CDR|Okay. BAT TEMPs are 100 and 120 - right now.
1190608|CC|Okay. How about tapping the meter a little bit for us?
1190615|CDR|Yes, I think the meter's been tapped since we've been working on the Rover. Yes - 100 and 120.
1190625|CC|Okay.
1190633|CDR|Okay. Get this baby started.
1190648|PAO|We're 2 hours and 5 minutes into this EVA.
1190648|CDR|Okay. I'm going to be heading west. The low gain - is 270.
1190703|CDR|Okay, Jack, I'm on the way.
1190704|CC|Okay, and Geno, we'd like to vary the parking a little bit because of this. We'd like to try and get those batteries cooled down. We'd like to have you park about 60 feet north of the Central Station.
1190716|CDR|Park about 50 feet from Central Station ...
1190717|CC|And facing east and down-Sun. And then we'll open the battery covers - -
1190732|CDR|Okay, Bob, I can't read you, but facing east and down-Sun are not the same.
1190737|CC|Well, approximately there.
1190743|CDR|Jack, you need your block? I got it right here.
1190745|CC|Facing - -
1190747|LMP|You're on the Rover, aren't you?
1190749|CC|Facing - -
1190750|CDR|I got it, wait a minute.
1190753|CC|Hey, Geno, we mean up-Sun. Sorry about that.
1190812|CDR|I got your block coming, Jack.
1190814|LMP|Okay.
1190833|CDR|Boy, it doesn't take much to get those battery covers dirty.
1190839|CC|Okay, Gene, did you copy me that we meant facing up-Sun?
1190849|CDR|Yes, Bob.
1190855|LMP|What did you do, get ...
1190907|LMP|Bob, the shorting plug meter is 90 percent scale to the right.
1190916|CC|Okay, copy that.
1190921|CDR|Okay, Bob, give me that parking heading again, would you?
1190924|CC|Okay, we'd like you to park facing the Sun. How's that for being definite.
1190931|CDR|Okay.
1190933|CC|About 60 feet north of the Central Station.
1190937|CDR|Sixty feet north of Central Station - I can't park a little northeast? Now, okay, and you want the battery covers open?
1190944|CC|That's affirmative, Gene. And that means you will have to dust them before you open them.
1190951|CDR|Yes, I guess so. Man, am I glad I didn't land up here, Jack.
1190956|LMP|So am I.
1191003|CDR|Okay, ALSEP is connected, RTG is connected. is that where you're going to have the Central Station, huh?
1191010|LMP|Well, Geno, that's the best I can do without spending a lot more time.
1191014|CDR|Yes.
1191015|LMP|And let me - let me talk to you about it. Say, I asked them about this depression.
1191024|CDR|Yes.
1191024|LMP|You probe's all right out in here. And if you get in the bottom of it for the - either this one, or go out there - especially in the straight line between you and me now, another depression would be good for the neutron flux. You need to be over that way - you're just a - -
1191044|CDR|Yes, they went - they want me to park about here where - -
1191047|LMP|You need to be over here.
1191048|CDR|Where's Central Station, right there, huh?
1191051|LMP|You need to - -
1191052|CDR|Yes, I've got to park in the Sun for the batteries
1191054|LMP|Oh, okay.
1191055|CC|Okay, 17, for your planning -
1191056|CDR|Okay, about 60 feet northeast. How does it look behind you.
1191100|CC|Okay, 17, for your planning, we're - we're now about 20 minutes behind the time line -
1191103|LMP|That's good.
1191106|CDR|You're cutting out, Bob. You'll have to wait.
1191112|CDR|What are you, Bob?
1191113|CC|Roger, we're about 20 minutes behind the time line, two-zero minutes.
1191120|CDR|Okay. Yes, I guess it could be worse considering a couple of things. Okay, about time I got those batteries. Okay, Jack, let me give you this first, so I can get to work.
1191139|LMP|Oh, the block.
1191140|CDR|Yes.
1191141|LMP|I'm sorry, I forgot you had it. Thank you.
1191204|CDR|Okay, where are we?
1191207|CDR|MARK. Sixty north heading, okay, 15 VOLT is OFF. Let me double check that while I was thinking of something. Wouldn't want this Rover to go rolling over the terrain without me. Okay, it is OFF. MODE switch, position 3. Dust TV/TCU, and the whole works, huh? There is TV REMOTE.
1191254|CDR|Okay, Bob. You're aligned on the high gain-
1191257|CC|Okay, we copy that.
1191302|CDR|And you're in position 3.
1191304|CC|Copy that.
1191305|CDR|Okay, let me get these covers dusted.
1191322|CDR|Well, that's a consolation. It's not as hard to get at the covers as one might think.
1191335|PAO|We've got a black and white picture now.
1191407|LMP|I'm working on the LEAM connection now, Bob.
1191410|CC|Okay. I copy that, Jack. Understand you - -
1191415|LMP|Say, it's hard to hit that garbage pile.
1191420|CC|Roger. Understand you almost have the heat flow connector connected by now?
1191425|LMP|Yes, sir.
1191437|CDR|I'm a little late, Jack, until I get these battery covers opened.
1191440|LMP|Okay. I got the heat flow for you.
1191441|CDR|Okay.
1191448|LMP|Well, the old LEAM connector doesn't connect, just like usual, or lock.
1191455|CDR|Okay. I'm not going to touch the batteries. The covers are clean, and the batteries themselves are clean. The LR - LCRU has been dusted and - -
1191508|LMP|Okay.
1191508|CDR|- - so has the TV.
1191510|LMP|It's locked. - -
1191511|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1191512|LMP|- - LEAM's locked on.
1191519|CDR|Okay. I'm going to use this.
1191546|CDR|Okay, Bob. The battery covers are in the shade.
1191550|CC|Okay. Copy that, Geno.
1191606|CDR|Well, well, well, well, okay; I hope that helps. Whoo! I'm going to go to MAX for a minute here. Do you buy that?
1191620|CC|Okay, Geno. We copy.
1191621|CDR|It seems hot in the valley of Taurus.
1191623|CC|Okay.
1191628|CDR|Okay. Oh, man, - Whoo! Yes, I'm going back to INTERMEDIATE.
1191635|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1191637|CDR|Okay, Bob. I'm ready to go to work.
1191639|CC|Good.
1191642|CDR|Okay. I'm going to push the gravimeter.
1191643|CC|Roger -
1191644|CC|MARK.
1191651|CDR|Okay. You have a mark.
1191656|CC|Copy that.
1191656|CDR|- - it's blinking, and remember what I said, it's a piece of cake to take on and off.
1191700|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1191706|CDR|Okay. This is north over here, huh? Okay, load old heat flow, 10 ... northwest. You connector connected. Carry heat flow 30. on ground, experiment up; okay. I'm going to do that Jack. Keep your eye on cables.
1191748|LMP|Oh, man, all I could do is go down hill over here.
1191755|CDR|Jack, do you read?
1191756|LMP|Yes.
1191756|CDR|Okay.
1191757|LMP|I'm just trying to level - -
1191759|CDR|Are you going to move that very much?
1191801|LMP|No, I'm just - I'll be working with it to try to level it. It's - that's going to be a major task.
1191806|CDR|Okay, there's 30 feet, I'll just - I'll get this thing squared away when I - Okay, Boyd bolt time.
1191818|PAO|Jack Schmitt working with the lunar surface gravimeter.
1191824|LMP|Ha, whee! That really went. Man, these things are just like they are at the Cape. You can feel every one of them.
1191843|CDR|Hey, Bob, has Ron been able to see the LM?
1191847|CC|Stand by. I'll find out.
1191904|LMP|Oh! oh!
1191905|CC|Watch it, Jack.
1191908|CDR|First cable - first cable hooked. Jack, you all right?
1191912|LMP|Yes. I'll straighten it up in a minute. Okay. The LSG is going out.
1191923|CC|Okay. Copy that, Jack.
1191924|LMP|I hope it does the things that we want it to for us.
1191931|PAO|This is the experiment.
1191935|LMP|Bob, I'm not doing too badly on keeping things clean. The - the base of the central station and - got some stuff on it, but - otherwise it's pretty good.
1191949|CC|Okay, Jack. We appreciate your efforts, and we understand you got the LEAM connected eventually.
1191956|LMP|Yes, and it locked; just took some diddling. Okay. Sun's over there. Oops, I forgot my Boyd bolts. Let's see.
1192008|CDR|Yes, I never drilled a hole where there's not a can.
1192018|LMP|Boyd bolts are OFF. Bob, does it bother him that the base of the LSG is touch - touching soil? Because this is pretty soft.
1192106|LMP|Bob, did you give me an answer?
1192108|CC|Roger. Ron thinks he has seen it. We haven't had a confirmation on the last orbit when you were talking to him, but he thinks he saw it the previous orbit.
1192116|LMP|Hey, hey, Bob. Hey, Bob.
1192120|CC|Go.
1192121|LMP|Can the LSG - the base of the LSG, be touching the soil?
1192125|CC|Stand by on that. Roger, Jack.
1192131|LMP|Well, it's very soft and it's going to be very hard to level for it.
1192134|CC|Roger, Jack. The base can be touching the ground.
1192139|LMP|Okay. It's level, aligned, the sunshield is shaded inside. The level bubble is just touching the outer circle; the one circle. And I improved that. It's perfectly centered now and I'm going to uncage. Whoops. I moved - the experiment moved. It's still pretty good level. Okay, it's uncaged; the gimbal is swinging.
1192226|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1192227|LMP|The gimbal is swinging.
1192228|CC|Copy that. And Jack, you're still in MAX - -
1192230|LMP|The bubble is back just touch - Yes, I know - -
1192236|CC|Okay.
1192236|LMP|I've been working, man.
1192237|CC|Okay.
1192241|LMP|Okay. I went to "pseudo intermediate," between minimum and intermediate. The bubble is just touching the - its circle, and the alignment - Sun alignment is good.
1192257|CC|Roger. Copy that. Thank you.
1192305|LMP|Okay, Gene. You've got some good slack here, if you can leave it that way. You shouldn't have the cable draped across anything, that's good.
1192313|CDR|Okay. I want to try and get this thing in there. It won't - there it is.
1192351|LMP|Can I help you, Gene?
1192353|CDR|No. I got a little dust in this mirror, though. I'm not sure I - Bob, I got a little dust on the white surface, not on the mirror - of the heat flow. You got any recommendations?
1192407|CC|Stand by on that, Jack - Gene. Is that the - on the heat reflector?
1192415|CDR|Yes. Yes, it's on the north side.
1192416|CC|Okay. As long as it's not on the mirror, it's okay, Gene.
1192422|CDR|Well, let me take another look. I'll double check.
1192429|LMP|Watch it. You're pulling pretty hard.
1192431|CDR|Yes, I'm watching - -
1192432|LMP|You're pulling - -
1192433|CDR|I'm watching; I'm not pulling. Okay. The mirror's clean.
1192436|CC|Okay; then, it's good enough.
1192437|LMP|Give me some more slack up here, you're draped.
1192439|CDR|Okay.
1192440|CDR|Okay. Okay. That's where it's going, Jack, right there.
1192445|LMP|Can you - okay.
1192447|CDR|How's that?
1192448|LMP|That's good.
1192450|CDR|Got enough?
1192452|LMP|This way just a little, Geno. That's good. Doesn't take much.
1192458|CDR|Man, we sure didn't need blocks or anything out here. There's enough soil here to level almost anything.
1192504|LMP|But that's so soft, though, it's hard to get a fast level. Whoops! That's strange. I think I did something wrong.
1192532|CDR|What's that?
1192537|LMP|Pulled the pin at the wrong time ...
1192540|CDR|Okay. The heat flow is level; the gnomon is good. And, Bob, I verified that that dirt is not on the mirror. It's on - on the white stuff that - that, you know, is horizontal to the surface of the box.
1192555|CC|Okay. Copy that, Gene; that's okay.
1192557|CDR|The mirror - mirror's - the mirror's clean.
1192601|CC|Roger. Thank you.
1192602|CDR|Okay. Okay, I'll give you a TGE reading.
1192609|CC|Roger. We're ready.
1192618|CDR|Okay; 670 002 601 - 670 002 601.
1192628|CC|Okay. We copy that.
1192632|CDR|Bob, was that with the camera - with the camera running?
1192636|CC|Roger. The camera's been running all this time.
1192640|CDR|That's beautiful. Okay. Your temperatures are down to a hundred - and maybe a sukosh 120 under, so maybe those batteries are cooling off.
1192649|CC|Okay; good.
1192655|CDR|It's sure good. I don't want to walk on that third EVA.
1192701|CC|Roger.
1192703|CDR|I'm getting to like driving this machine. Okay, pull pin 2. Pin 2 always comes after - goes before pin 1.
1192714|LMP|I think that's in the NASA documents now.
1192718|CDR|What's that?
1192719|LMP|Pin 2 comes before pin 1.
1192721|CDR|(Laughter) Okay.
1192724|LMP|Reel 3 comes before reel 1 and 2, also. I think I overdid that one.
1192733|CC|Yes, it went clean out of sight; but by all means, watch reel 2.
1192742|LMP|(Laughter) Oh, you think you're so clever. Believe it or not, Bob, I'm anchoring the geophone module.
1192758|CC|Hey, Jack, it looks to us on the TV as though you're m - anchoring the geophone module with a flag.
1192806|LMP|Yes, that's what I'm doing. I'm anchoring the geophone module with a flag.
1192815|CDR|Okay; one leg, two legs, three legs. And none of them - none of them -
1192828|LMP|Hey, Bob, remind me to police the garbage pile.
1192831|CC|All right.
1192832|LMP|The garbage pile is turning out to be - just like every other ALSEP deployment. It's hard to control.
1192842|CC|And I understand all your legs came out okay, Geno, or didn't come out.
1192845|CDR|Okay. Yes, sir; they all came out okay.
1192852|LMP|Okay. LMS ring is pulled.
1192858|CC|Copy that.
1192905|LMP|Amazing. Amazing.
1192917|PAO|Jack Schmitt working with the lunar surface profiling experiment.
1192927|CDR|Okay, Bob. I've got my tools of the trade right here. I'm ready to go to work. Now I put a mark in the deck - Here it is; right there.
1192951|LMP|Hey, Bob, what have I forgotten? The package won't rotate.
1192953|CC|Try rotating the UHT.
1193001|LMP|No, I'm serious. Oh, rotate the UHT, huh?
1193008|CDR|Yes, remember that one?
1193009|LMP|No - that's right. I'm sorry. I knew it, I knew it would happen.
1193018|CDR|Where's your garbage pile, Jack? Well, I - I can't find yours.
1193022|LMP|Well, don't worry about my garbage pile. It turns out it looks very much like the ALSEP.
1193029|CDR|Okay. I made a mark over here that says - that says that should be about cable length.
1193037|LMP|What am I doing over here? You're awfully - you're awfully close.
1193041|CDR|No, my - my - I'm going right in here, Jack. Right here.
1193048|LMP|Okay.
1193049|CDR|I can move it further - -
1193050|LMP|No. That's all right.
1193051|CDR|- - further north.
1193052|LMP|No, this will be all right. I just want to keep away from you there.
1193106|CDR|We shall soon see how tuned we are. I'm anxious to see what's under this mantle.
1193115|CC|So are we.
1193122|CDR|Well, Bob, I hope I can drill you a couple of good holes.
1193125|CC|How about three?
1193127|CDR|And I know you do, too.
1193130|LMP|Okay, Bob, the arrow is east/west, pointing west. The bubble is in the center. If I'm lucky, it'll stay there. I'm not - I'm more like east/northeast I'm trying to keep a little further away from Gene.
1193159|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1193203|LMP|Break seal is OPEN.
1193211|CDR|Okay, that was my MARK. Let me see. Double check that cable length. I'd sure hate to drill a hole that was outside of the - length of the cable.
1193223|LMP|Okay, Bob, the LMS is deployed. I'm policing the site. The screen is over the port.
1193235|CC|Copy that.
1193235|LMP|I'm going to move - one big rock. What am I doing down in here?
1193250|CDR|What were you doing down in there?
1193252|LMP|(Laughter) Okay. And, Bob - -
1193256|CDR|Here we go.
1193257|LMP|- - Bob, there's a little bit of dust adhering to the - sides of the LMS. And a few particles less than - half a percent of the surface on the top. But, of course, you're going to clean that one off; so that's all right.
1193319|CC|That's affirm on the top.
1193321|LMP|The - the north side has about a - 10- or 15-percent dust cover.
1193331|CC|Copy that.
1193332|LMP|...
1193332|CC|- And, Geno, you're leaning pretty heavy forward on that drill.
1193339|CDR|Okay, Bob. She went in - she's going in like she's in some pretty dead stuff, and then I hit some rock here. I'll watch it - I won't lean forward. I'm not putting too much pressure on it.
1193352|CC|Okay.
1193352|CDR|It sounds to me like she's chippering away through rock. May be just a little longer drilling hole than it was at the Cape.
1193412|PAO|Cernan drilling two 8 foot holes for the heatflow experiment.
1193516|CDR|Bob, she's going in - but not without a little bit of resistance.
1193520|CC|Roger. We're observing that, Geno.
1193523|CDR|Every once in a while - every once in a while, she breaks through a soft spot.
1193529|CC|Good.
1193548|LMP|Bob, I'll tell you, this central station's a bear - bear to get level. Well, I just got dust on it now.
1193617|LMP|It's just too soft.
1193642|CDR|Boy, that sure was drilling in hard stuff because it took a lot to get it off.
1193700|CC|Okay, Jack. And we could certainly stand a little bit of dust, at least on top of that central station sunshield.
1193708|LMP|Yes, I guess the level's important.
1193712|CC|Roger.
1193717|CDR|I can just see what John's thinking right now. That's what makes the difference. That's where you expend your energy.
1193736|LMP|Bob, I don't know that I'm going to be able to do that without a lot of time. It's hanging against the south edge.
1193748|CC|Say again there, Jack.
1193753|LMP|I don't know whether I'm going to be able to level it - the central station.
1193807|CDR|Anything I can do, Jack?
1193814|LMP|Okay. I got it off the edge.
1193818|CC|Okay; maybe we better just leave it there.
1193833|LMP|Well, I'm making it worse by getting dust on the top.
1193839|CC|No, the dust on the top is not as important as getting it leveled, Jack. But if you get it broken off the edge, that ought to be good enough.
1193902|CDR|Bob, I'm riding at about 382. I've got - oh, I guess, about 80 - Well, no, there's half - I guess, 60 percent; no flags and no tones.
1193917|CC|Okay. Copy that, Geno.
1193924|LMP|Okay, Bob. It's touching the second ring; the gnomon is aligned, and I'm going to leave it alone.
1193931|CC|Roger on that.
1193936|LMP|Yes, I think I lost all the time I might have made up.
1193940|CDR|Hey, Bob, it's obvious that I'm going through some pretty stuff - tough stuff. Consolidated material, like rock fragments, and then it breaks through; and then it jumps for about 3 or 4 inches and then I hit some more fragments.
1193954|CC|Roger. We're seeing that Geno. Looks interesting.
1194010|LMP|Oh, me. I got too low on that one. I thought I had that gaged.
1194024|CDR|If you deploy that geophone, you go out of sight.
1194118|CDR|Bob, there would be absolutely no way of breaking this drill from that - those bores without that tool, I guarantee you that.
1194128|CC|Okay. We copy that, Geno.
1194141|CDR|I think I found a way to get this off, though, with a little help. Okay, number 3 coming up.
1194148|CC|Roger. The third and last one on this hole.
1194153|CDR|Yes, sir. Oh, boy. Time out.
1194207|CC|Okay.
1194208|LMP|Don't work too hard.
1194209|CC|Roger.
1194213|CDR|My fender's still on, which makes me happy. I'll tell you, if you could come and sprinkle the whole area with water and get rid of some of this dust -
1194231|CC|Okay, Geno. And can you remember if those heat flow cables are not crossed as they come out of that box?
1194239|CDR|Yes, sir. I very definitely made a point of not crossing them.
1194242|CC|Okay; very good.
1194244|CDR|They are not - they are not crossed.
1194248|CC|Good.
1194308|LMP|(Laughter) Where do we find such men?
1194312|CDR|How's it coming, Jack?
1194315|LMP|Oh, slow. This leveling is really throwing me behind the power curve; but I know they - they're serious about it, so - If I can keep it where it is now, I'm in like Flynn. It's perfectly centered, Even the gnomon is aligned within a shadow width.
1194349|CDR|Man, is that thing biting.
1194353|LMP|Really working down there, huh?
1194354|CDR|Oh, you betcha, man. I'm in something tough down there now. Whew.
1194359|LMP|Well, what - what bore are you in?
1194402|CDR|Number 3. If I let go of that drill and it kept running - If that drill kept running and I wasn't anchored to the ground - -
1194410|LMP|(Laughter)
1194411|CDR|- it would throw me over a massif - in tangential turns.
1194429|CC|Okay, Geno - -
1194429|CDR|I think I'm in the mother lode down there.
1194431|CC|Gene, if its getting really tough and you're not making much progress, we'll be happy with it where it is.
1194438|CC|Well, looks like you really - -
1194438|CDR|No, sir, you're going to be happy with it where it's supposed to be; and that's where it's - -
1194443|CC|You were hiding it from us - -
1194443|CDR|Yes, sir.
1194444|CC|- we couldn't tell how deep in you were.
1194448|CDR|I wanted to surprise you. They're going in all the way, and they're both going to work. It's a little tough looking into the Sun.
1194500|LMP|Yes.
1194510|CDR|Oh, Manischewitz! I don't know where I picked that word up, but (chuckle) it's better than some, I guess. Now if I can use my little lean-tool here. Oh, man, that works great. That works great. Put this out of the way. Bob, I'm into the white mark; it depends on what you want to call the surface. You know, it's - I can - I can give you 6 -or give or take 6 or 8 inches.
1194612|CC|Yes, something like that will do, Gene, I guess. You can measure it ...
1194617|LMP|Gene, is the dust coming up changing color on you at all?
1194621|CDR|No, Jack. It isn't changing color. I can't even tell - I can't even tell where it's coming up.
1194631|LMP|(Laughter)
1194633|CDR|I don't think it is coming up, I think I'm just pushing it aside.
1194635|LMP|oqy, I'll tell you - -
1194636|CC|I saw something come up then just then, Jack.
1194638|LMP|- - the old ALSEP central station - -
1194641|LMP|Yes, it deploys itself; it turns out.
1194644|CC|Roger on that. That was - -
1194646|LMP|Bob--
1194646|CC|- - pretty amazing.
1194653|LMP|Okay. When I - I finally leveled it in a bull's eye. I don't know whether you heard me or not, but it was - it was perfect. So it's okay. It's just got a fair - it's got about 20-percent dust cover on the top.
1194709|CC|Okay.
1194714|CDR|Sure ... glad you've got that probe covered.
1194720|CC|And, Jack, ALSEP says that that's okay, the 20 percent's no problem.
1194731|LMP|Okay. I put a rock under the northwest corner. Oops - guess what happened. (Laughter) Just like in training, Geno.
1194748|CDR|What happened?
1194749|LMP|The old geophone cable caught on the corner.
1194757|CDR|Okay. Oops, I'm not ready. That says F4B on that; that's an airplane.
1194826|CDR|Houston, there's no dust on the probe except that which was on my hands.
1194832|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1194838|CDR|That must be solar wind.
1194847|LMP|Sorry not to be more talkative, but - this is taking all the concentration I got. I'll have to push this down, I can see that. Yes, this ... doesn't hold any better here than it - did in training.
1194914|CDR|Oh, don't - don't lose that - Geno, don't lose that - don't lose that. Notice how you talk to yourself out here?
1194923|LMP|Who, me? (Laughter)
1194930|CDR|Help. I says - you is getting farther and farther behind.
1194938|CDR|Well, I've had my one for today.
1194945|LMP|Your one what?
1194946|CDR|Well, I just did my "whifferdill."
1194949|LMP|Oh, did you fall?
1194950|CDR|No. It's funny how for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction, isn't it?
1194957|LMP|Hey, I've heard that before. Okay, Secure thermal curtains.
1195004|LMP|Thermal curtains are secured.
1195007|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1195014|CDR|How far behind am I, Bob?
1195016|CC|Stand by. Roger. We're showing - Gene, just about 20 minutes; and Jack, just about 25 -between 20 and 25 minutes for both of you.
1195038|CDR|Okay.
1195044|LMP|- How are our consumables?
1195047|CC|Stand by.
1195058|CDR|Oh, if this thing isn't going to work better than that -
1195132|CDR|Bob, just like the book says, it's down to Papa 1; and it hooked.
1195136|CC|How about that.
1195153|CDR|Oh, boy, the old fingers really suffer on these.
1195200|LMP|Take it easy.
1195202|CDR|Okay. Now this one down to F1. Would you believe F1?
1195213|CC|Yes, I believe you, Gene.
1195232|CDR|Bob, in this soil, best number I can give you is about an inch below the white spots - or Bravo 1.
1195241|CC|Okay. Copy Bravo 1.
1195247|CDR|I got a - I got a better way of putting that last thermal shield on now.
1195257|PAO|Jack Schmitt working on the ALSEP central station aligning the antenna, it looks like.
1195338|CDR|Okay, Bob, you're looking at it - coming out to the south, but I don't expect it'll stay that way unless I put some dirt over the cable. How does that grab you?
1195352|CC|Stand by, Gene.
1195357|CDR|You like that thermal shield the way it is? Okay. That's coming out south. That's in good shape. I'm pleased with that.
1195405|CC|Dirts okay, if you want to put it on there, Gene.
1195406|CDR|... happy with it. I'm moving on.
1195408|CC|Okay.
1195412|CDR|Now the thermal shield is on there, Bob. I got them all on there.
1195415|CC|I was talking about - If you want to put some dirt on there to hold it down, that's okay.
1195420|CDR|Oh, okay. Well, I got it down without the dirt.
1195424|CC|Okay. Good enough.
1195426|CDR|I'm just finding all sorts of good ways to make life easier out here.
1195436|LMP|Stay away from the cables.
1195441|CDR|Bob, and I didn't forget the last measurement either.
1195444|CC|Roger that.
1195449|CDR|Hey, can you see this big mound that I just walked - it's just to the north - not a mound - the depression that's just to the north of me?
1195458|CC|Roger, 17 -
1195459|CDR|It's probably behind the Rover. Okay. Well, how's - how's that look for the core?
1195509|CC|Standby.
1195526|CC|Geno, can you give us a distance estimate to that? Does it look like it's 80 feet or so?
1195533|CDR|Yes.
1195533|CC|Okay. Then that sounds good.
1195536|LMP|Oh, shucks. Hey, Bob, is there any way a level bubble can fail (laughter)?
1195545|CC|Hey, Jack, remember that's on top of those wobbly legs and - or wobbly springs there. And with the thing not being straight, you shouldn't really expect the level bubble to be level after the thing's been deployed. That happened at the Cape a couple of times, remember?
1195600|LMP|Yes, but Bob, I've - I've moved this practically all the way down the full throw and it - That bubble won't move, and I can't get it to move by tilting it; and I was level. And the bubble on the top of the central station is still level.
1195615|CC|Okay. You're talking about the level on your other one, huh? Stand by on that.
1195620|LMP|The gnomon, yes - Both of them? I can't get it to move to the other side of the - fluid.
1195632|CDR|Keep working. That - that thing shouldn't fail.
1195643|LMP|Well, I've gone full throw - That's not level.
1195646|LMP|That bubble's stuck in there, somehow. In both of them. That's not even pointing close to the Earth. Okay, I'm going to have to tweak it up and let them see the signal strength - and tweak it.
1195703|CC|Okay. Why don't you try and manually point it - try and level it and see if we - see what you can do toward getting it towards the Earth.
1195717|LMP|I will, Bob. That bubble's just not working. I - I can't figure that one out.
1195718|CC|Okay. Just go ahead and use the - -
1195720|LMP|Okay. Maybe I jarred it loose here.
1195722|CC|Okay.
1195726|LMP|Okay, I think I jarred it loose.
1195728|CC|That's another first - -
1195729|LMP|Don't ask me how.
1195729|CC|- - Okay, we won't.
1195747|LMP|Okay. I got the other one loose. That's very strange. A sticky level bubble. (Laughter) Never heard of it.
1195758|CDR|Hey, Bob.
1195800|CC|Go ahead, Jack - Gene.
1195800|CDR|If you're looking at me, what I'm talking about is this depression - is this depression in here for the core - oh, maybe 15, 20 meters out in here. Jack, what did you have in mind for the neutron flux?
1195813|LMP|Either the one you're in - you're down in there, or next one over behind that rock in front of you over there.
1195819|CDR|Hey, I can go way over there. That's not too far probably for - -
1195822|LMP|Well, either way I think is fine, Gene. But I would suggest behind the rock.
1195827|CDR|For a neutron flux, huh?
1195828|LMP|Yes, sir; and the core.
1195829|CDR|Well, I wanted - I thought they wanted a core in that depression.
1195833|LMP|Well, that - there's also one over there.
1195838|CC|Okay, and - 17 - -
1195838|LMP|... a choice.
1195840|CDR|I'll go behind that rock; that looks good from here.
1195842|CC|And, 17, we think you guys are in far - by far the best position to judge that - far better than we are. You know what the requirements are on shielding and - -
1195850|CDR|Okay.
1195850|CC|- - greater than 50 meters - 25 meters.
1195900|CDR|Okay, Bob. Okay. The long - long bores in.
1195914|CC|Okay. Copy that, Gene. Looked like that one went in fairly well.
1195920|CDR|Well, probably about like the other one did. Not - not too bad.
1195924|CC|Okay.
1195925|LMP|Oh, I must be getting old.
1195929|CDR|I expect the next two are going to be a little harder.
1195935|LMP|Bob, I'm not very happy with this level. But I'll turn it on and - Have me come back a little bit later, when they've warmed up some more, and let's see what it looks like.
1195948|CC|Okay. We'll do that. Give me a mark when you turn it on, and we'll see what kind of signals we get.
1195956|LMP|Okay. The shadow gnomon is - aligned; I'm going to turn the shorting plug on.
1200000|CC|Copy that.
1200005|LMP|It's on.
1200006|CC|Roger.
1200011|LMP|And - the needle is fullscale left.
1200019|CC|Copy that.
1200124|CDR|I can't believe that.
1200126|LMP|What's your problem?
1200127|CDR|Well, that whole bore turns in the - in the ground, it's so loose. I got - and I got that - You know how those threads sometimes stick on you a little bit. I got one stuck halfway down and the whole bore is turning, so now I've got to use a wrench on it.
1200145|CC|Okay, Jack. And we have - -
1200147|LMP|Bob, I've got a - I've got a - rock about 10 feet southeast of my LEAM location. I can move - I can move a little more north and get, oh - get 15 feet from that. That okay?
1200211|CC|How big is the rock there, Jack?
1200215|LMP|Oh, it stands - it's a meter wide and stands about a third of a meter high.
1200222|CC|About a third, and about a foot high?
1200224|CDR|Bob, how's that for - -
1200229|LMP|A third of a meter.
1200231|CC|Okay.
1200233|CDR|Bob, how's that for soil mechanics? I pulled the first bore right on out trying to get this thing on right.
1200240|CC|Well, put it in - put it in before your hole fills up there, Geno.
1200245|CDR|Yes. Right now I'm interested in getting this second bore on. Now, let's see if I can get it back in. Well, not quite as far, but high enough for me to reach the - it still feels, Bob, like there's a lot of fragmental material down there.
1200316|CC|I copy that, Geno. Good luck.
1200318|CDR|That was an interesting little - exercise. Well, I got the bore on right, anyway.
1200330|LMP|Well, shoot.
1200343|CC|Okay, Jack. As long as it's only 1 foot high and 10 feet away, that's satisfactory.
1200353|LMP|Okay.
1200454|LMP|Okay, Bob, the LEAM's deployed, aligned; and the level bubble is - just touching the inner ring.
1200508|CC|Copy that.
1200513|LMP|Hey, Bob. Did you get anything from the ALSEP yet?
1200514|CC|Watch that cable, Jack. Roger. We started to tell you that when you had the question, and we're getting a good lockup on the data.
1200524|LMP|Well, keep an eye on it, because I'm not happy with the level.
1200527|CC|Okay. We'll get back with you on that.
1200529|LMP|I'll check. ... checking.
1200537|PAO|The LEAM is the Lunar Ejecta and Meteorites Experiment.
1200547|LMP|I found a way to get over cables.
1200550|CDR|(singing)
1200553|LMP|(Laughter)
1200607|CDR|Oh, Manischewitz. Whew.
1200611|LMP|There you go again.
1200612|CDR|I know. Let me get this one off and take a take a bite of candy here.
1200622|LMP|I'm kind of having trouble with UHTs today. They just don't want to lock in when you get dust in there.
1200629|CDR|Hey, Jack. Be careful with that UHT on the heat flow because it was aligned - real good.
1200636|LMP|It was what?
1200637|CDR|The heat flow experiment electronics, when you go over there for that UHT, was aligned.
1200641|LMP|Oh, yes.
1200645|CDR|Bob, I'm going to take a zap of cold water.
1200647|CC|Okay. Sounds good to me.
1200653|CDR|Whee. Almost looks like it's getting dark out. is it? Guess not.
1200703|LMP|(Laughter) Hope not, or we is in trouble.
1200712|CDR|I think I may have gone the wrong way. I did. I went to MIN instead of MAX. Here it comes. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Man. Watch it. Okay, Jack. You're all right. Still deploying.
1200728|LMP|Huh?
1200729|CDR|Still deploying. Nothing; you're all right. It's coming out a little - hard.
1200741|LMP|Wouldn't you know it?
1200743|CDR|Okay. I'm back in MIN, Bob.
1200748|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1200755|CDR|By any chance have any heat flow data yet?
1200801|CC|No, Geno. We don't have the heat flow turned on yet.
1200804|CDR|All right. Oh, that's right. Okay. I think that's right. Okay. I'm about to give you your number. Oh, God darn it. (Laughter) Crank it a couple of times. Clean as a whistle. Clean as a whistle.
1200843|LMP|Well, just like I thought; antenna doesn't want to go in.
1200855|CC|Is that the number 3 section there, Geno?
1200858|LMP|Yes, it's in.
1200901|CDR|Yes, sir, Bob.
1200903|CC|Roger. Beautiful.
1200908|CDR|Well, it's the last one I've got. I guess we'll find out when I put the probe in. I think they're all in there.
1200922|LMP|Okay. I'm about ready to deploy some geophones.
1200925|CC|Okay, Jack. Did you get the antenna into that pallet okay, eventually?
1200932|LMP|Yes.
1200933|CC|Good enough.
1200940|CDR|Bob, I occasionally hit stuff and it - it spits this whole drill back at me. Knocks it back about a half an inch or so, and then it will bite - bite through it.
1200954|CC|Okay.
1201001|CDR|My general impression is that there is an awful lot of fragments I'm busting up down there.
1201008|CC|Okay.
1201033|CDR|I tell you Bob, That last 6 inches, I really came into something hard; but it's down all the way.
1201039|CC|Beautiful, Geno.
1201044|LMP|Oops, there's a heat flow probe.
1201046|CDR|What happened?
1201048|LMP|(Laughter) I - I messed up -
1201050|CDR|Man, don't hit that. Give me heart failure after all that drilling.
1201053|LMP|No, I just walked too close to it. I apologize for that.
1201056|CDR|I don't care how close you walk to it -
1201057|LMP|Well, Mark does, Mark does.
1201102|CDR|Just don't step on it.
1201109|LMP|I do that ...
1201121|CDR|(groan) Hey, Bob, just out of curiosity, what kind of heart rates has this drill been producing on me?
1201132|CC|Stand by. Okay, you've been running at 120 flush, Gene, with peaks of 140 to 150 from time to time.
1201157|CDR|Okay.
1201202|CC|And there goes the last heat flow hole on the Moon.
1201205|CDR|Oh. Yes, sir. I tell you, if you learn how to use your instruments in this 1/6g, you take your time and you get around; it's frank - phenomenal. But if you try and bend over without some help; not so phenomenal.
1201251|CDR|Boy, what a ride that Challenger gave us coming down. What a ride.
1201328|CDR|Oh, you dummy - you dummy. Jack you still with me.
1201342|LMP|Yes,
1201343|CDR|Okay. Boy, I'm getting dropsies now. Getting dropsies.
1201350|LMP|Don't push it.
1201352|CDR|Getting dropsies.
1201353|LMP|Take a rest.
1201436|CDR|Unbelievable - unbelievable.
1201458|PAO|Gene Cernan putting the second heat flow probe into place.
1201512|CC|Okay, Geno. And the heat flow is on and looking good.
1201520|CDR|That's good news, Bob. Let me give you another one here. While it's dirty; I'll tell you I'm in to the bottom of the white marks, and that's - oh, about Bravo 1 again.
1201543|CC|Okay, I copy. Papa 1, Foxtrot 1, and Bravo 1?
1201549|CDR|No, sir, Bob. Now the - the bore stem is in to the top of the white marks; I'm still putting the probe down.
1201559|CC|Okay, copy that. - -
1201600|CDR|And the top of the white marks is about bravo 1.
1201603|CC|Copy that.
1201603|CDR|About bravo 1. Okay. Here go - here goes the probe. Pick a number you'd like to hear. How about Papa 1?
1201625|CC|How about Papa 1 there, Geno.
1201630|CDR|Bingo, babe, you win; and it locked in.
1201633|CC|Roger. I think Mark won on that one, too.
1201635|CDR|Papa 1.
1201636|CC|Roger. And, Jack, I gather you are probably traipsing across the landscape with a geophone about now, right?
1201652|LMP|That's firm.
1201653|CC|Okay. And let me ask you - -
1201655|CDR|Good gravy! You know how big that rock -
1201657|CC|Stand by. Go ahead.
1201702|LMP|Go ahead, Bob.
1201705|CC|Okay. I gather - you said that the heat - the LEAM was leveled and aligned, and I gather that meant it was on the black decal on top. Do you happen to remember what number was on that?
1201719|LMP|Well, I'll check it. But I think you know where that decal is.
1201723|CC|Well, okay. Good enough.
1201730|CDR|Okay, Bob. The little thermal shield went to F1.
1201736|CC|Hey, that's another bingo.
1201738|CDR|And it's coming out to the south. I'm coming out to the south.
1201743|CC|Roger.
1201807|CDR|And the thermal shield is in place.
1201812|CC|Roger. Copy that.
1201828|CDR|Well, it was until I moved it. Do I need my javelin anymore?
1201840|LMP|You might.
1201842|CDR|Yes, I might.
1201842|CC|One never - one never knows, Geno.
1201843|CDR|I think I'll save it until after - I think I'll save it until after I drill the core. Oh, me oh my.
1201854|LMP|Take it easy, Geno. You sound like you're -
1201855|CDR|No, I'm doing fine.
1201857|LMP|Okay.
1201858|CDR|That Sun is just bright. I ought to put those visors down, I suppose - those other visors. Okay. Let me take a look at my list and see whether I've got everything. Measured, measured; height, height; you've got all the shields; you're coming out south; verify heat flow is level and aligned - it is aligned and gnomon was good; UHT to the LRV LMP seat; and then what do I do? Let me see. Deep core prep. Jack, I'm going to leave the UHT in the heat flow in case you need it.
1201930|LMP|Okay.
1201932|CDR|Okay. I'm going to go behind a rock over there -
1201935|LMP|Now, now.
1201938|CDR|In that depression. Bob, you do want the core in a depression, right?
1201946|CC|Roger. That's affirmative, Geno.
1201951|CDR|Okay, nobody touch my heat flow; the prettiest job I've ever done. Okay, I'm going behind a boulder over here. Bob, I've got about 385; and, I guess, about 50 percent. I can't see it too well.
1202017|CC|I copy that, Geno.
1202017|CDR|And no flags and no tone; and I'm on - I'm on intermediate coolant and I feel great.
1202026|LMP|Likewise; and I'm - -
1202026|CC|Roger.
1202030|LMP|- - and LMP is - LMP is 56 percent.
1202033|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1202033|LMP|What are you, Geno?
1202035|CDR|Well, I can't see it. The Sun was - I don't know, Jack. I can't - it was about 5 - yes, about 55 or 54.
1202048|LMP|Okay.
1202049|CDR|Now, this ought to shield that thing from the doggone -
1202056|LMP|Pressure's 385 on the LMP.
1202108|LMP|Bob, one comment on - getting the geophones within a few degrees of vertical - in this undulating terrain (chuckle), I think they're pretty good; but it's not real easy to tell what vertical is.
1202123|CC|Roger, Jack.
1202129|CDR|Well, this is right in line with the shallow depression; and it's right in line with the - RTG, with a rock in the middle.
1202139|CC|Okay, Geno. As long as you're drilling behind the rocks from the RTG, that's great.
1202148|CDR|That's where you're going to get it. Let me see what I need. Drill, rack, core bag - drill at 1 IPS. Okay. Let's go do it right.
1202218|PAO|Gene Cernan preparing to drill another hole - these cores will be brought back to Earth and the neutron flux experiment will be placed in that hole.
1202229|CDR|Okay. Let me see, I'm going to put it right in this depression. Right in it.
1202234|LMP|There, get the middle of that.
1202236|CDR|It's a shallow one. If I go over there, I'm not shielded, Jack.
1202239|LMP|No, that's good. Get in the middle. Get it in that place.
1202243|CDR|Right in this little - it's only about a 4-meter depression.
1202246|LMP|Oh, wait a minute - oh, you're on the other side of the rock. Okay.
1202248|CDR|Yes, yes. Yes, I want to get back here.
1202252|LMP|That's good. Oh, man, go slow.
1202321|PAO|We're at 3 hours 21 minutes into this EVA.
1202335|LMP|Bob, the - all of these big boulders around here that I've looked at, are the same - same rock type.
1202348|LMP|Oh - who pulled over the geophone module?
1202353|CDR|Can't imagine.
1202357|LMP|Okay. That sounds like the title of a book.
1202422|CDR|Uh oh. There it went.
1202425|LMP|What happened?
1202426|CDR|Oh, I lost my vice. I see it. I see it.
1202437|LMP|Hope I took number 1 in the right direction. Yes. Okay, number 4 will be a little hard to pick up.
1202447|CDR|Boy, all these little craters are filled with glass. Come on back here. I've got to chase this thing over the lunar surface.
1202457|LMP|I've seen glass covers. Oh, about out towards there, I guess.
1202518|LMP|As I was saying, Bob, all these big blocks that I've looked at look like the gabbroic rock that I was talking about - possibly upwards of 50-percent plagioclase rather than 30 like the mare - but an intermediate gabbro of some kind. And one big block there had very sharply defined - parallel parting planes. I think there is a foliation of minerals that parallel that parting, but I'll have to check it out.
1202609|CC|Okay. Copy that, Jack.
1202614|LMP|Those parting planes go over the - go through the whole boulder on the order of at least 3 meters long and outcrop.
1202641|PAO|Jack Schmitt deploying the geophones of the lunar surface profiling experiment in a large T shape.
1202703|LMP|How is it going, Gene?
1202705|CDR|Fine. I'm on my second stem, here - or I'm starting on it. How are you coming?
1202713|LMP|Okay. I'm just about ready to - pick up - old the biggy, geophone 4.
1202724|CDR|(Laughter) Have a good time.
1202727|CC|Okay. And Geno, how are you doing? We've been watching Jack traipse back and forth across the -
1202736|CDR|I'm getting there, Bob. I'm trying to fit -
1202739|LMP|Talk about seven league boots.
1202743|CDR|Put stem number 2 on.
1202752|CC|And, Jack, how's the visibility back at the center geophone ...
1202759|LMP|How's the vis?
1202801|CC|Yes. Are you - -
1202802|LMP|Not bad.
1202803|CC|Okay. You're not having to worry about the photos yet?
1202808|LMP|No, I've been checking it. Bob, my biggest problem is that the flags don't anchor.
1202819|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1202825|LMP|In general, the lines are following the contours. Whoops - whoops - whoops.
1202924|CDR|Well, try another one. Doggonit.
1202929|CC|What's the problem, Geno? it won't screw on?
1202934|CDR|Oh, yes. It's no problem. You know, it's the same problem you always have. You get these threads - get a little side force on them and - you know, with the helmet and gloves and what have you - it's just - you can't - Sometimes they go on easy; sometimes they don't.
1202952|CC|Copy that.
1203004|CDR|Okay. I got this one on now.
1203006|CC|Roger.
1203028|LMP|Boy, do I have a ball of spaghetti here. But the geophones are going in the right direction. I hope you don't have an EMI problem. Can the geophone lines cross, Bob?
1203041|CC|Stand by on that. Okay; no problem, Jack.
1203058|LMP|Okay. Hey, if you see me start to pull over that module there -
1203107|CDR|Hey, don't do that.
1203108|LMP|No, I mean - oh, I won't hurt it. It's just that it - it stretches the other geophones tight.
1203117|CC|Okay. Well, right now we're watching Gene.
1203122|LMP|Okay. Don't worry about it. I'll watch it. The anchors are completely unsuccessful - on the module, anyway.
1203148|CC|That looks pretty good, Geno.
1203153|CDR|Not too bad, Bob. The first core was awful loose. I think I could have pulled it back out with my hands.
1203201|CC|That's not the idea.
1203302|CDR|Oh boy, oh boy. Speaking of boy, oh boy - are you a long way off.
1203506|CDR|Okay, going to stop for a second, Bob.
1203510|CC|Okay. We've observed your problem there getting the wrench off, Geneo.
1203516|CDR|Well, I had to get down to get that - to get that - third - third stem aligned and get it on there. This is the easy part, but I just got myself behind the power curve for a second.
1203529|CC|All right.
1203541|LMP|How's the time, Bob?
1203543|CC|Stand by. Okay. Presuming you're taking photos now on geophone 4. Having to finish geophone 4, Jack, you're about - right now, looks like about 15 minutes behind.
1203603|LMP|Okay.
1203609|CC|And no problem on the time line so far.
1203613|CDR|Darn it. You know, Bob, one of the problems is I'm working in a small crater; and it's just a little difficult to work on these slopes. Okay. It's on. I'm ready to put the drill in.
1203631|CC|Okay, Geneo.
1203636|CDR|Okay. Let me get the dust out of the bit by blurping it. Oh, man; okay. How am I doing, Bob, on the time?
1203804|CDR|Jack, do you read me?
1203805|LMP|Yes.
1203806|CDR|Okay, because I don't see you.
1203808|LMP|I'm out by the big rock.
1203810|CDR|Oh, okay; I got you.
1203844|CDR|Man, I hope that hole doesn't collapse. I'm going to be awful disappointed. I think I could drive that heat flow flux - or heat flow - or neutron flux in, at least for one probe, without any problem. Okay, Bob, if all goes well in the next few short moments, you'll have the final - unleaded(?) - cores stem - automatic - in this area - on Apollo 17.
1203933|CC|On a Monday evening, Roger.
1203938|CDR|Yes, on Monday evening. That is what it is, isn't it? Hey, who's winning the football game?
1203946|CC|Stand by; we'll find out.
1204016|CC|Okay; and, Jack and Gene, the score is 10 to 10 at the half.
1204026|CDR|Yes, that's Oakland and - and who?
1204029|CC|Jets.
1204038|CDR|... Kansas City. What am I thinking of?
1204132|PAO|The duration of this EVA will be 6 hours and 45 minutes. The oxygen supply in the backpacks is being used at a slightly higher rate than anticipated. We are 3 hours and 40 minutes into the EVA now.
1204314|CDR|Hey, Bob, would you settle for about 8 inches out of the ground? it's about as low as I can get.
1204322|CC|Okay - -
1204323|LMP|I haven't heard from them recently.
1204324|CC|Okay - Okay, Geno. We'll give you A minus for that one.
1204325|CDR|I know.
1204326|LMP|There he is.
1204327|CC|But it's still an A.
1204330|CDR|Well, I'll go lower if I could get an A plus. But I am going to accept an A minus, because I'll never get the wrench on it if I go any lower.
1204339|CC|Roger there, Gene.
1204339|CDR|I'm - I'm within an inch of the white stripes. How's that?
1204343|CC|That sounds great to me - -
1204344|CDR|An inch of the white stripes, Bob.
1204346|CC|Roger. And they're worried up here that you didn't clear the flutes, Geno. You want to tell them that so they'll be happy?
1204352|CDR|Yes, sir. I'll tell them I did clear the flutes.
1204355|CC|Okay. And, Jack, where are you lost on the plains.
1204401|CDR|Yes, I did. But if you want me to do it some more, I will.
1204403|CC|No, if you cleared, that's sufficient. And, Jack, where are you lost on the plains of Taurus-Littrow, there?
1204412|LMP|I'm over here.
1204416|CDR|He's 180 from where your camera - from where I am.
1204420|CC|Okay.
1204421|LMP|Right across the Rover.
1204422|CC|Okay. Are you getting ready to take geophone photos or ALSEP photos?
1204428|LMP|I'm getting ready to enable the old geophone.
1204432|CC|Okay. I take it that means you've taken the geophone photos.
1204437|LMP|Oh, yes, sir; and I forgot the gnomon (laughter).
1204440|CC|(Laughter) Hey, Jack. How about giving me a couple of quick readings here to satisfy some people. One, was there a decal on the LEAM that you aligned it with? There's some controversy down here that there's no decal there; and the question is, if there isn't, they want a reading out of the degrees, but we keep saying that the LEAM decal - we can't prove it.
1204503|LMP|I'll go prove it, Bob. I'll go by there. Stand by.
1204507|CC|Okay.
1204508|LMP|What's the other question?
1204509|CC|And the second question is, is there a decal and was it aligned on the ... the 20-degree decal on the LSG. Was that also aligned?
1204520|LMP|Yes, sir.
1204521|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1204522|LMP|The orange one.
1204523|CC|Roger. Agree.
1204524|LMP|As per drawing.
1204526|CC|Roger, sir.
1204527|LMP|As per drawing.
1204529|CC|Roger. You don't have to prove it to me.
1204534|LMP|Yes, I do.
1204537|CDR|Okay. Okay, Bob, I was able - -
1204544|CC|Okay; and, Jack, how far - -
1204544|CDR|- - to pull the core out - -
1204545|CC|Okay, go ahead.
1204546|CDR|- - with the drill. I was able to pull the core out with the drill, about 3 inches. And it's all jacking material from there out.
1204556|CC|Okay, copy that, Geno. And we finally got some word from the Cape to prove to people that there's a decal on the LEAM, so you don't have to go back by that, Jack. Just at the right time.
1204606|LMP|I already have. It's reading - it's reading 30. And here's the decal.
1204614|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1204624|LMP|Okay. I guess I'd take ALSEPs word on it.
1204630|CDR|Good.
1204640|LMP|One more, Once more I tempt the fate of the god of the cables.
1204645|CC|Okay; and, Jack, we're getting ready here to try and save a little bit of time. And we're saying that why don't we just take two stereo pans for the ALSEP photos. First stereo pan will be in the vicinity of the original stereo pan; and the second one, they suggested, will be to the northwest - of that original one.
1204711|LMP|Northwest. Okay.
1204712|CC|Yes, and I suggest that you go far enough so that you can see the LEAM past the central station.
1204718|LMP|Yes, sir.
1204723|CDR|Hey, Bob, (laughter) you'll be interested to know I just put a - I just put a plug in the top of that core; and it disappeared from sight down the center - center of the core. I'll put a cap on it, too; but I want to plug it first. I want to - I want to get the rammer to plug it down.
1204744|LMP|Hey, Bob, where do you want the focus on the pan to be?
1204747|CC|Stand by on that.
1204749|LMP|About 15 feet?
1204754|CC|Stand by.
1204810|CDR|Where's my rammer? There it is.
1204817|CDR|Hey, Bob, that's strange. That plug was too small for the core.
1204838|CC|Hey, Jack. You got a focus that's somewhat short of 7 - Well, between 74 feet and - just a little short of 74 feet?
1204848|LMP|I've already taken it at 15, Bob. I think that's pretty good.
1204853|CC|Okay; that's - Okay. We couldn't get an estimate.
1204859|LMP|It's not a calibrated detent, but I don't think you need it here.
1204904|CC|Okay.
1204942|LMP|How far northwest?
1204948|CC|Go ahead, 17.
1204951|LMP|About the same - about the same position as the heat flow down-Sun - or up-Sun?
1205000|CC|Stand by.
1205007|CDR|Okay, Bob, I - I was able to - -
1205011|CC|Yes. That sounds pretty good to me, Jack.
1205013|CDR|- - to get. Bob, I ran that plug three-quarters - two-thirds of the way down the rammer, and it - it hit solid paydirt.
1205024|CC|Okay. That sounds good.
1205026|LMP|And I'll put a cap on it for you, too.
1205027|CC|Okay. That'll make people happy. Did you copy me, Jack, that ... 6 o'clock to the - -
1205032|LMP|I knew it would. And that - -
1205034|CC|And -
1205041|LMP|Roger, Bob.
1205046|CC|And, Jack, would you confirm for the ground that you got the LSP enabled?
1205049|LMP|That's cap Alfa. No, I didn't. You interrupted me. Good boy. I was on my way, and the LEAM interrupted me. I'll get it.
1205058|CC|Roger.
1205102|LMP|Keep after me.
1205121|PAO|Gene Cernan will use a jack to get the core stems out of the -
1205129|CDR|Bob, that's cap Alfa - that's on the - that's on the - the core.
1205139|CC|Say again there, Geno.
1205147|CC|Jack, you're taking your second pan, right?
1205149|CDR|I'm not sure they're hearing us all the time.
1205156|LMP|Yes, but the camera just stopped.
1205211|CDR|Oh, man!
1205213|CC|Okay, what - -
1205213|CDR|Oh!
1205214|CC|- - was your question, Geno?
1205218|CDR|I just said that was cap Alfa on the core. And let me tell you it's coming, but this thing is really in something. Oh.
1205233|LMP|Would you believe I'm out of film, Bob?
1205238|CC|Okay. I'm afraid I'll have to.
1205243|LMP|Why didn't I look at the number?
1205245|CC|You want to give me a frame count, Jack?
1205246|LMP|Mag Alfa is empty.
1205248|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1205250|LMP|It's 158.
1205255|CC|Copy, 158.
1205312|CC|Okay, Jack, we're recommending magazine Hotel, and we also suggest you take the second pan, when you retake it, at 74 feet.
1205324|LMP|Okay.
1205327|CDR|Man, it didn't feel like this stuff was that hard.
1205338|LMP|What's the problem, Geno? You need some help?
1205340|CDR|No, nothing you can do. Just - just jacking away. See if I can get this thing out of the way. See if I can get it out, is what I'm really saying. I may be jacking the treadle down into the surface
1205403|LMP|Change hands.
1205428|CC|Okay, Jack, if you haven't put magazine Hotel on, we want to recall that amd make it magazine Golf - Gail.
1205438|LMP|Well, Bob, I've already got it on.
1205441|CC|Okay. Sorry about that.
1205442|LMP|Is that okay?
1205444|CC|Leave it on.
1205446|LMP|I know what you want. You want color.
1205449|CC|That's affirm.
1205450|LMP|Well, anyway, it's black and white all...
1205453|CDR|Gail is not - you mean Charlie.
1205502|PAO|That jack applies about 5 to 600 pounds of pressure.
1205510|LMP|Do you want color, or do you want Charlie?
1205514|CC|Stand - stand by, Jack, if you're still at the Rover.
1205520|LMP|Well, I'm still here, but I got Hotel on.
1205524|CC|Okay. Leave Hotel on. That's - we - we goofed. We'll just accept it.
1205531|LMP|Well, okay. We don't have much time; otherwise I'd change it. I should have thought of that myself.
1205539|CC|Well, couldn't get ... there - -
1205540|CDR|We got a little time because I've got a lot of jacking to do. Man!
1205549|LMP|Let me - let me finish the pan and come and help you.
1205552|CDR|Well, there's not - not a lot you can do, Jack.
1205555|LMP|I'll get the neutron flux ready.
1205557|CDR|Well, thanks a lot.
1205601|CDR|Okay. Come on, baby. I'm going to get this thing out, now that I got it.
1205614|CC|Boy, Geno, that's what you call getting down into your work.
1205624|CDR|Bob, I'll save my comments until later. I hope this core is appreciated.
1205635|CC|Roger, Gene. And I have word from the back room that it is appreciated.
1205641|CDR|Yes, that makes me feel warm. I'll get it. You're going to have to bear with me. Man, I don't know what it's in.
1205658|LMP|I was afraid that would happen - with all those rocks.
1205704|CDR|Yes, but it didn't go in that hard.
1205708|CC|Hey, Geno, how about slacking off for a minute there. You got pretty - going pretty hard.
1205716|CDR|Okay. One more turn, I'll get up. I've got to hit an easy spot sooner or later.
1205727|CC|It seems that way.
1205734|CDR|You're right, Bob. I'm going to take a rest. You bet you. Man, I hate to say it, but I - I had that 25 percent of the way there. I can feel it ticking now. I'm going cold.
1205800|CC|Okay.
1205819|LMP|Okay, Bob. I got your pans and a couple pictures of the heat-flow probes.
1205828|CC|Okay - -
1205828|LMP|Now, let's see - -
1205829|CC|- - okay, Gene - Jack. If you've got the two separate pans there, we're suggesting that you - in the - since the CDR is still working on the core recovery, we suggest that you sample the large boulders and loose material on top of some of the smaller large boulders in the vicinity. I would look through some sampling here while Geno's pumping on the old jack. Unless you guys see that - -
1205854|LMP|You want me to help him?
1205855|CC|Well, unless you guys - Okay. If you'd let me finish. Unless you guys think that two guys can do that better than one, I'm not sure.
1205904|LMP|Gene, you want me to spell you a little?
1205906|CDR|Jack, I don't think there's a lot you can do. Come on over here 1 minute. Let's see if I can - -
1205910|LMP|Well, I can use up some of my water.
1205913|CDR|Let's see if I can't get a bigger bite - you on one end, and let me stand on the treadle and we might be able to get a bigger bite. See, I can't get a very big bite. That's one of the problems.
1205928|CC|And, Jack, could you verify we have the LMP ENABLE on ... - -
1205930|CDR|I just hope that jack doesn't break.
1205934|LMP|No, I'll get it. I knew there was something I needed to do.
1205936|CDR|Get the jack end over here - other side. Let me - let me put some weight here. See if you can - see - what - what kind of bite you can get.
1205951|LMP|Oh, man.
1205952|CDR|Yes, that's what I've been doing. See if you can get a bigger -
1210005|LMP|Oh, no.
1210009|CDR|It's coming, though. See, just - Here, let me get my foot down there and you get - you get - jack. See, that's the key. No, I think I can -
1210023|LMP|Okay. If I do it that way -
1210025|CDR|Get her way down there.
1210026|LMP|Okay. Now try it.
1210028|CDR|See, we got a couple of inches there to throw. We're all right. There you go. Do that for a little bit.
1210034|LMP|Okay. Let me put my foot on it.
1210037|CDR|Okay, ready?
1210037|LMP|Yes.
1210038|CDR|It's got to loosen up sooner or later.
1210041|LMP|Okay. That's another good one. When you're tired, I'll do that and you can do this. See, this way, I can - you can get a bigger throw. Okay. Let me know when and I'll do that.
1210057|CDR|Oh, that's all right.
1210103|LMP|Does it feel like it's loosening up at all?
1210105|CDR|Yes.
1210107|LMP|(Laughter)
1210108|CDR|Excuse me. Yes, go ahead. (Laughter) Okay, okay, okay (laughter).
1210118|LMP|Stay there. Stay there. Okay, back. Thank you. Fell on my UHT, among other things. Okay. Let's try that again.
1210135|CDR|You want to get over here and I'll do that for a while.
1210136|LMP|Oh, that's all right. I'm - I just lost my balance. Let me - can I hold there?
1210140|CDR|Yes. You can hold there, and I'll hold, too.
1210147|LMP|That seems like a little easier.
1210149|CDR|Yes. That looks to me like it should be getting easy. Just hold on to me and -
1210153|LMP|What was that?
1210153|CDR|Huh?
1210157|LMP|I had a tone. It was probably a -
1210159|CDR|You still got it?
1210202|LMP|Gone, momentary. I probably got a -
1210208|CDR|You get over here. Get over here, Jack.
1210210|LMP|This is all right.
1210211|CDR|No, let me get over there.
1210211|LMP|It's coming now.
1210219|CDR|Why don't you come over here?
1210222|LMP|Come on, one more. I think we're going to get it.
1210226|CDR|Okay. Come on over here and hold your foot against that thing. Just hold that - that little thing down. That's the main thing. Ready?
1210238|LMP|Yes, we're getting it now.
1210247|CDR|I need your foot on that thing. See if - -
1210249|LMP|There you go. I don't know what kind of hole we're going to have.
1210258|CDR|Okay. Put it - get your foot down on that thing again.
1210304|LMP|Wait a minute. Let me - Okay. I jacked the treadle down about 6 inches. Okay. It's loosening up a little bit. I keep saying that, don't I?
1210317|CDR|No. It - it didn't change while I had it there.
1210333|CDR|I can get it. Why don't you go get your - your pan.
1210335|LMP|You got that?
1210335|CDR|Yes. Why don't you get your pan and your - -
1210337|LMP|I've got that. I got - -
1210338|CDR|- - LSPE, and I'll - -
1210340|LMP|I'll get that and a few samples, I guess.
1210341|CDR|Okay. Go ahead and do that. I can get it.
1210348|CDR|Whee. Let me tell you, Red Rover, let me tell you.
1210401|LMP|I know whose face is smiling back there.
1210408|PAO|Ron Evans is coming up over the crater Copernicus in his 17th revolution of the Moon. He's right on the flight plan. Everything going good. Sounder data coming in good.
1210410|LMP|You don't suppose this is why we didn't have much dust from the LM, do you?
1210411|CDR|I think it is (laughter).
1210420|LMP|(Laughter) I saw all the way to the ground during landing.
1210425|CDR|Yes.
1210426|LMP|Okay, Houston.
1210429|LMP|MARK it, enabled.
1210430|CC|Okay, finally. Thank you.
1210431|LMP|Whoops, I moved your an - your central station. I've got to realign your antenna.
1210438|CC|Stand by, Jack. Wait a minute.
1210448|LMP|Well, the gnomon's still aligned. I thought I moved it.
1210453|CC|Okay. Well, let it be.
1210453|LMP|Yes. We should have raised the flag on this thing. It looks just the same as when I left it, but I thought I moved it.
1210502|CC|Okay, Jack.
1210509|LMP|Is it okay, Bob?
1210517|CC|Okay. Leave it alone for right now, Jack, and we'll get a reading on it.
1210521|LMP|Okay.
1210521|CC|For a minute or so. And, Jack, I guess right now, you might get some fairly rapid samples in the area, since you're probably almost ready to leave. And can you tell us what you saw there in the vicinity of the - you were giving us a description of the boulders there and plateness of the - and alignment of the crystals - the plag. You want to amplify that a little bit?
1210546|LMP|Okay, then. I will as soon as I get back over there with a sample bag. Bag 10 Echo - 10 Echo - is a sample of a very large boulder that's just beyond geophone 3. Just west - just south.
1210606|CC|Copy that, 10 Echo, and boulder east of which geophone?
1210613|LMP|South of geophone 3 - southwest. And I got a few photos to docu - document the boulder. I'm not sure I documented the sample, though.
1210626|CC|Okay, copy that.
1210626|LMP|It - it's a - it's the - the same kind of rock - the same kind of rock I saw near the LM - and the gabbro - I'm beginning to lean towards 50 percent plagioclase, though.
1210649|CC|Okay.
1210715|CDR|Bob, I had to remove the treadle from the hole and I'll tell you later why.
1210724|CC|Okay, go ahead.
1210726|CDR|Oh, me. No, I'll tell you later why. I'm just figuring, oh me, how am I going to get all this stuff now? I'm going to lose my hole. Okay, it was right there. In our fiasco over here, we knocked everything over.
1210743|LMP|Did I ruin something?
1210744|CDR|No, I've just got to stoop over to get things and that's a major - major - effort these days.
1210751|LMP|Can I help you?
1210752|CDR|Nope, I got it here. I've got a delicate core in one hand, and I'm trying to get some core caps in the other. You'd be glad to know it's full, Bob. And while I'm the only one to see the bottom end right now, I'm going to tell you, it - it looks like - it looks like what I'm walking on, but it's obviously now powdery. It's obviously very - very cohesive, because it - it - The bottom of the core is not smooth, it's very jaggedy, and fragmental-like.
1210830|CC|Okay, copy that, Geno. Very good.
1210835|CDR|Yes. I'm - I'm being very careful with your core here, but I've got to do a few - little housekeeping chores first.
1210841|CC|Okay. Have you got that neutron flux over there in the vicinity, or is it still back at the Rover?
1210848|CDR|No, sir, I already got it.
1210849|CC|Okay, good enough.
1210851|CDR|Yes, I've been looking.
1210852|CC|And Jack, in your travels there, while you're doing some sampling, if you hap - happen to wander by in the vicinity - approximate vicinity of the double core - the deep core, you might get us a Rover sample of the soil there.
1210907|LMP|Okay.
1210909|CDR|Bob - Bob, and - the core is filled to within a - an eighth or certainly less than a quarter of an inch from the - from the bit.
1210918|CC|Okay. Sounds good to me. Sounds like a good - good candidate for a cap.
1210925|CDR|Yes, sir, and it's got Bravo on and the plug has been discarded.
1210929|CC|Copy that.
1210935|CDR|Now, let me see what else I can get here, before I get too upset. I need my - my - the - the - the drill, besides performing admirably, is a tool of necessity to lean over and pick things up with. Except when you let it fall down.
1210954|CC|Okay. And our next priority is to put the neutron flux down the hole, we hope.
1211006|CDR|Well, we shall see. Man, I don't even know if I can find the hole. It's in the shadow now. I guess I can see it down there. There it is. Okay. You asked, and with a little bit of luck, you shall receive.
1211034|CDR|Listen, I'm earning my three and a quarter a day today. Oh, boy, I don't want to lose the rammer either. Let me get that before that gets lost in the shuffle. We don't want to lose that for sure.
1211109|CDR|I bet you all think I'm stepping on that hole, don't you?
1211114|CC|I don't. John doesn't, either.
1211125|LMP|Bob, I see no - no clear alignment of plagioclase or pyroxene in this rock. That's the one with the parting in it. It looks as if - integrating what I've seen here and over at the big rock - the geophone rock - I - that the layering or the foliation or the parting, whichever it is, is the result of variations in vesicle concentrations. The sample 10 Echo is a sample of the more coarsely vesicular rock. I could not get one of the finer - more finely or nonvesicular fragments. But I got pictures of it.
1211212|CC|Okay, copy that. And do you see any - any - -
1211215|LMP|I'm having trouble - -
1211216|CC|Go ahead.
1211220|LMP|Go ahead.
1211221|CC|Can you see any evidence of soil on top of some of these medium-sized boulders?
1211227|LMP|There's soil. A little bit of dust in some of the holes. But I - there's not enough to sample at this point. I may find some later.
1211240|CC|Okay, copy that. He's picking up ...
1211251|LMP|Vesicle walls do not seem to be as shiny. Most of them seem to have dust in them.
1211302|CC|Copy that.
1211302|LMP|The vesicles; are not cleanly spherical - they're spherical but they have fairly rough outlines. They look as if there's been some recrystallization.
1211316|CC|All right.
1211319|CDR|Bob, I will ver - verify that the lower section is on.
1211322|CC|Okay, thank you, Geno.
1211337|LMP|I picked the wrong rock to sample with a scoop, I'll tell you that.
1211356|CDR|Boy, I'll tell you, housekeeping is the key to the world right now.
1211359|CC|Okay, Geno and - let's - -
1211401|CDR|Okay, another key to the world is one of - -
1211403|CC|Geno, stand by. Hold it.
1211406|CDR|Yes.
1211407|CC|Okay, make sure that the top of it doesn't go down through the hole, too, and disappear, either by putting it through the treadle, or if you're sure this the - or whatever.
1211422|CDR|Boy, Bob, that sure is a good thought. You know, I had to take the treadle off because the jack wouldn't go down and no way I could put that treadle - Well, let me turn it on first. That was a good thought. It may - it may go down that hole. That would be terrible.
1211439|CC|How big's the hole look, Geno?
1211441|CDR|See, the jack wouldn't - Well, looks big enough to put this down. Let me - let me use my judgment on it. And a little ingenuity.
1211514|CDR|I verified the top was on, by the way.
1211517|CC|Okay, thank you.
1211530|CDR|Shazam!
1211531|CC|How about that, loud applause, loud applause.
1211539|CDR|See what happened, here, to that treadle, Bob? I couldn't get the jack to go down and it - it - it made the hole oblong when I - but it's all right now.
1211547|CC|Okay; beautiful, beautiful.
1211548|CDR|And it ended up all right.
1211550|CC|Okay. And why don't we get you two guys together again, now, and break down the core and press on. And we've got a little revision here to the EVA. I'll get with you in just minute on, as soon as I find out what it is.
1211609|CDR|Bob, I feel pretty good about that - that - that makes me feel pretty good.
1211616|LMP|Bag 174 - 474, 474, soil from next to this big rock, it's the fillet. I can't get a chunk of the rock.
1211626|CC|Copy; 174 fillet beside the big rock. And, Jack, while you coming back here to the Rover, why don't you get one more Rover sample in the vicinity of the deep drill, while you and Gene get ready to take on the core stems. And because of being a little bit behind here, what we're doing is, we're getting prepared to drop Station 1 in favor of doing Steno. Over. And I'll get with you on more details on that in a minute.
1211700|LMP|Well, how far behind are we?
1211702|CC|Stand by. You're about - between 35 and 40 minutes. And part of the problem is that we're a little short on oxygen on Gene's PLSS. It looks like it's a 6 minute and 4 - 6 hours and 45 minute EVA from that point of view, which means that we have to - we'd have to leave Station 1 too early, which is another - which is the reason to curtail Station 1 apart from just behind which is what the hooker was.
1211742|CDR|Okay, Bob, I'm approaching the rear of the Rover. I've got the core, the cap, the wrench, and the rammer.
1211749|CC|Okay-
1211759|CDR|I didn't mean to breathe up all that oxygen.
1211803|CC|Well, there's something you can't help. Even the Surgeon agrees with me on that one. And for your thinking, Jack and Gene, what we're doing is planning on going to the west side of Steno and that boulder field that's part way out to Station 1.
1211825|LMP|Okay, you want me to get a - you want to break that and I'll go get this sample, Gene.
1211829|CDR|Yes. I'll - I'll break this Jack; no sweat.
1211835|LMP|Gene has pretty well chewed up the ground. I helped him. Do you want me to get a little ways away from it?
1211842|CC|Stand by. I don't think we're interested in a surface sample in the last top little bit ring, it's just a - in the top - just a surface sample. Stand by 1.
1211859|CC|Anything there in the dirt, Jack. It doesn't have to be a skim sample of any sort.
1211911|CDR|Okay, Bob, I'm breaking down the core at the tail end of the Rover, here.
1211915|CC|Okay, congratulations.
1211921|CDR|Well, don't do it yet, I haven't gotten it broken down yet. But I got it out of the ground with a little help.
1211948|CDR|Okay, first piece of three sections - Bob, it's full.
1211951|CC|Okay, beautiful.
1211952|CDR|And I have to tell you which end I'm taking it from. I don't remember which end I've got here.
1211957|CC|That's all right, since we got the cap and Alfa on one end and Bravo on the other end - Bravo.
1212007|CDR|Man! There's a cap that's going to be tough to get on. I put that on with a hammer. Oh, boy.
1212015|LMP|Okay, Bob, there's a mixture of soil and rock in 475.
1212020|CC|Okay, copy 475 -
1212022|LMP|The soil came from about - the soil came from about 5 centimeters - 0 to 5 centimeters.
1212032|CC|Okay, copy that. Beautiful.
1212034|LMP|And it's about 3 meters - 3 meters - 3 meters from the hole. Well -
1212044|CDR|Hey, Bob, cap Charlie is opposite Alfa, that was the first 3-section.
1212052|CC|Okay, copy that.
1212059|LMP|Bob, it's about 3 meters from the hole. I got stereo before with - at 11 feet and one after at 11 feet.
1212108|CC|Okay, copy that. And how about a frame count there, Jack.
1212114|LMP|Stand by.
1212133|CDR|I tell you.
1212141|CDR|No - no, I can get it. Boy, this system works good.
1212155|LMP|Okay, let me see. Let me configure the old LRV sampler, here.
1212223|CC|Jack, when you - -
1212224|CDR|Oh, boy, oh, boy; oh, boy; oh, boy.
1212224|CC|Jack, this is Houston. Over.
1212227|LMP|Go ahead.
1212228|CC|When you took those two pans off the ALSEP, was one at 15 feet and one at 20 feet?
1212236|LMP|One was at focus for 15 and 74.
1212239|CC|Okay.
1212240|LMP|There's a partial pan - there's a partial pan on mag A, which was taken at 15.
1212247|CC|Okay. Understand.
1212255|CDR|Okay, Bob - I can't see what it is - I guess Delta and Echo is the - the 2-section core. Delta being adjacent to the first section of 3.
1212312|CC|Roger. Copy that, Gene.
1212323|CDR|Okay, baby, just go on there - nice. The last - the last one is Foxtrot. And it's on tight.
1212355|CDR|Ouch.
1212357|LMP|Arm's tired?
1212358|CDR|That hurts. Oh, me; oh, my. I'm going to take a big drink of water here. We got three cores; we got the neutron flux down; and we got two heat probes, and an ALSEP. I don't care if we are 30 minutes late. Bob, did I give you the last cap?
1212425|CC|That's okay, Gene. We don't really need it - the way they're broken down, there's no problem. The 323 stands out and the Bravo on the bit end - there's no problem there.
1212436|CDR|Hey -
1212439|LMP|What do you need, babe? Okay, pull that off. Pull this off. Here.
1212445|LMP|Rotate it 180, there.
1212447|CDR|No, no, no, just the - the total thing. That's good. There you go.
1212451|LMP|Like that?
1212451|CDR|Yes.
1212455|CC|Okay, and, 17 - -
1212457|CDR|Now you'll have to line it up.
1212458|CC|Go ahead.
1212458|LMP|Okay. I'll hold it. You do it.
1212502|CDR|I got it.
1212503|LMP|Okay.
1212505|CDR|... give you a reading, Bob, before you speak. Wait a minute, let me - let me get it over with. It's 670, 002, 601. That's 670, 002, 601.
1212521|CC|Did you punch GRAV a second time? That's identical to the first one.
1212529|CDR|I just did to read it. That's what you want, isn't it?
1212532|CC|Yes, is that - but you - did you punch GRAV after the first reading you gave me there at the ALSEP? Or are you just reading me the same measurements you did before?
1212542|CDR|Bob, I called them out every time - Bob, I'm reading it right here. Everywhere I've punched GRAV, you've got it written down somewhere.
1212553|CC|Yes, and I didn't copy your punching GRAV, but the one - -
1212555|CDR|Bob, I did not - when I went back - Bob, I did not - when I went to get the treadle and the neutron flux and rammer, I did not punch GRAV.
1212604|CC|Okay. So that's the same as the first one. Never mind, thank you. And guys - we're ready for you guys - as you go along here, to do the geo prep and press on. As I say, we'll go to Steno and come back from there and do the SEP. Over. Any questions about that? We'd also like to know if you have the gnomon, back of the Rover?
1212627|CDR|No, we're just - -
1212629|LMP|Yes, we do.
1212630|CDR|Okay, lay cores in. Okay - -
1212632|LMP|Can you - can you put that in that sampler tool bag, there?
1212636|CDR|Yes, sir. We're configuring for geology, now, Bob.
1212641|CC|Okay, copy that.
1212647|CDR|Bob, right now, 10 Echo is in my suit pocket, I hope.
1212653|CC|Okay.
1212657|CDR|Okay, my 20-bag dispenser is SCB 1. Let me get at them.
1212701|LMP|I've got mine on.
1212702|CDR|Okay. Oh.
1212709|LMP|This probably goes under the seat, doesn't it?
1212718|CDR|The camera - where the devil mine is - where the devil mine is. Excuse me. Oh, I see the gnomon.
1212733|LMP|I put it there so I wouldn't forget it.
1212735|CDR|(Laughter) Okay, I tell you, dexterity is the key. We might leave - Look at those cover gloves.
1212749|LMP|I guess we can take those off. I don't know whether we ought to or not.
1212751|CDR|I'm going to leave mine on for a while. I changed my mind. I want to look at my gloves before I take them off. Okay, where are we? You got your camera, obviously. This is my camera. I got the bag dispenser on it. It's not a bad day's start. Bob, is the ALSEP working good?
1212819|CC|The last we heard, it was working great, guys. We'll check again, though.
1212826|CDR|Okay. You got your camera. My camera is in the floor pan. Cap dispenser, SCB to Gate 1. Let me get that. Jack?
1212835|LMP|Yes?
1212835|CDR|You haven't been on the Rover yet. It's real easy, but it's also very easy to kick dust all over those battery covers, so don't even get on it until I put those bat covers down.
1212844|LMP|Yes - Hey - I guess - I should - we ought to press on as if we're going to Station 1.
1212849|CDR|Yes, you've got to walk - you got to walk back to the LM anyway - I got to - we got to - -
1212853|CC|Roger. Guys, we are going to play it per the checklist. Jack will carry the things back. Gene will get the thing aligned. We'll go out to the SEP site. And then we'll press on from there down to Steno. Over.
1212907|CDR|Okay, very good.
1212910|CC|And right now -
1212911|CDR|Okay. Stow LMP - you want to come over here and I'll stow your PLSS?
1212913|CC|Go ahead. Never mind.
1212915|LMP|Yes.
1212921|LMP|My camera's under my feet.
1212925|CDR|Okay, you can turn around. Oh, man, what have you been in? Hallelujah.
1212943|CDR|I'll keep the hammer, I'll give you this. Can you reach the rammer? it's right in front of you. On the - -
1212951|LMP|Oh, yes.
1212952|CDR|Let me - I haven't got that cap in, yet - there it is. Okay, the caps are in. If we ever come  out here again, I want to get your hammer, here ...
1212958|CC|... you might give us a frame count on Hotel.
1213005|CDR|Okay, Bob.
1213008|CC|And we're going to hand over stations. You might get a dropout.
1213009|CDR|Yes, it's under the seat right now. I'm - Okay, rammer - I got the hammer. Turn around. I'll give you a SCB 2.
1213021|LMP|Okay.
1213023|CDR|Okay. Now, guess who's watching to see how these hooks are going to work?
1213035|LMP|Oh, man. Like a charm, so far.
1213037|CDR|Oh, except your doggone harness of off, too, Jack.
1213041|LMP|Is it?
1213042|CDR|Yes.
1213042|LMP|Okay, you've got to undo the strap - -
1213044|CDR|Let me - let me get at it.
1213046|LMP|You got to loosen that strap and then just put her underneath, and tighten it up again.
1213051|CDR|This one here?
1213052|LMP|The one on - the one on my right. Yes.
1213054|CDR|Now - let me turn around then. I got to get on your - oh, on your right. Right here.
1213056|LMP|I think it is - Yes. That's where it is on yours.
1213059|CDR|Yes, I'd like to make sure the other side is all right, though.
1213101|LMP|Oh, okay.
1213103|CDR|Let me - Yes, it's all right. Turn around. Let me just get it underneath.
1213114|LMP|I got it so tight now, the Rover - Okay, now.
1213117|CDR|I got it on.
1213118|LMP|Okay?
1213119|CDR|Okay, now, I'll get this hook. That hook's going to be a piece of cake, Jack.
1213133|CDR|Keep it in, and it's all on and locked.
1213135|LMP|Okay, you got a SCB 2. You got the rammer. You got a cap dispenser.
1213139|CDR|Okay. You can secure SCB 1. Doesn't this go under your - -
1213142|LMP|Not yet, I don't think. I think it stays there.
1213146|CDR|This does. No - -
1213147|LMP|That does. Yes. That goes under the seat.
1213150|CDR|And this goes here.
1213151|LMP|Yes.
1213152|CDR|Okay.
1213154|LMP|Bob, the long can's going under my seat.
1213157|CC|Okay. Copy that, Jack.
1213158|CDR|They got a handover, I think.
1213202|CC|Handover's complete, guys.
1213205|CDR|Okay.
1213213|PAO|4 hours 30 minutes into the EVA.
1213213|LMP|*** which way it unlocks, though.
1213214|CDR|Okay, you can pull it off.
1213217|LMP|It's unlocked.
1213218|CDR|It's unlocked. There it is. It's usually stiff. Okay. For once, I have my camera off.
1213235|CDR|Did you get the heat-flow pictures, by the way?
1213237|LMP|I got most of them. Not all of them. They revised the whole camera.
1213242|CDR|Hey, Bob, is it going to hurt to leave the UHT in the heat-flow electronics?
1213247|CC|Stand by.
1213250|LMP|Wait a minute. I ought to get that, I guess.
1213301|LMP|One - tall.
1213305|CDR|Here, let me lean down.
1213308|LMP|Two, and the hook's still hooked. Check for sure here. Those hooks weren't designed for new bags.
1213328|CC|Okay, Jack - -
1213330|LMP|Okay. I think that will ride all right.
1213331|CDR|Okay.
1213331|CC|They don't want us there. If you - if one of you guys can get to it and pull it out.
1213337|CDR|I'll get it right now.
1213338|LMP|Okay.
1213338|CC|Thank you.
1213339|LMP|Watch the alignment, as you said.
1213341|CDR|Yes. I sort of thought you might like it out of there. Let's stay away so I don't get a cable and I don't get dust in the mirror. The alignment is still good.
1213352|CC|Okay.
1213354|LMP|Now, if I can get it out. Okay, I'm going back to the LM.
1213402|CDR|Okay, Bob, the alignment's good on the heat flow, and I've got the UHT out. Jack, do you need this?
1213408|LMP|You better leave - save it. Save it.
1213410|CDR|I'm going to leave it right here by the ALSEP.
1213412|LMP|Save it. Careful.
1213416|CDR|Jeeminy, I just threw it right here in this little - little ditch.
1213419|LMP|Yes, right. Okay, the other UHT is by the ALSEP. We probably ought to have it with us, Geno. For the sampler.
1213430|CC|Have you got one - -
1213431|CDR|Well, you've got one - -
1213431|CC|- - UHT sampler?
1213431|LMP|Yes. That's all right. Keep it on the ...
1213436|CC|Okay, we gather you're on the way back to the LM with the core stems there, Jack.
1213443|LMP|Yes, sir.
1213444|CC|Okay.
1213448|CDR|Okay, Bob, I'm going to take the TV away from you and get these battery covers squared away before I put the tongs and the camera on.
1213457|CC|Okay, Geno, and you guys have the gnomon in the little quiver, right?
1213504|CDR|Yes, sir. The temperatures on the batteries are 96 and 110.
1213508|CC|Okay, thank you.
1213510|CDR|Can I close the covers?
1213511|CC|Roger.
1213512|CDR|Can I close the covers?
1213513|CC|Roger; Roger.
1213518|CDR|Hey, you're turning our voice around, Bob.
1213522|CC|No, I said - -
1213523|CDR|We're getting a repeat.
1213524|CC|I said, "Close the covers, please."
1213530|CDR|That's right. I heard what you said, but you're turning our voice around.
1213542|PAO|Jack Schmitt on his way back to the lunar module.
1213548|LMP|(Singing) I was strolling on the Moon one day -
1213554|LMP|- in the merry, merry month of December -
1213554|CDR|- in the merry, merry month of December -
1213557|CDR|No, May.
1213558|LMP|May.
1213559|CDR|May's the month this year.
1213559|LMP|May - that's right.
1213601|CDR|May is the year of the month.
1213603|LMP|(Singing) When much to my surprise, a pair of bunny eyes - be-doop-doo-doo - -
1213610|CC|Sorry about that, guys, but today may be December.
1213612|CDR|Okay, the battery cover - -
1213617|LMP|(Humming) Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-dee-da-dee - -
1213621|CDR|Okay, Bob, the battery covers are closed. I'm ready to go MODE switch 1. I guess I'll just wave goodbye. You look pretty clean, so I won't touch you.
1213635|CC|Okay, thank you.
1213640|CDR|Oh, man. It's even hard to move you counterclockwise. Here we go. Counterclockwise, facing aft. Okay, I'm going to go MODE switch number 1 - -
1213655|CC|Roger. We can confirm that.
1213655|CDR|- - and you want me to leave the LCRU blankets open 100 percent, right?
1213659|CC|Roger, That's affirm.
1213704|CDR|Okay, now I got - now I got to mount my camera and tether my tongs.
1213712|PAO|We'll lose TV while Gene Cernan drives the Rover to the Surface Electrical Properties site, about 100 meters east of the Lunar Module.
1213713|CDR|Boy, Jack, I can bare - I can't see you at all. Looking into the east is terrible. All I can tell you is that there's a LM there.
1213724|CDR|Okay, mount camera, tether tongs. See if my camera's going to work. Bob, I'm on - on Bravo - mag Bravo and frame count 19.
1213739|CC|Okay; copy that, Gene.
1213743|PAO|Jack Schmitt has carried the core stems back to the lunar module where he will pick up the transmitter for the Surface Electrical Properties experiment and carry it out to the site where it will be deployed.
1213757|CDR|And for EMU status, I can give you about 36 percent, no flags, 3.85, and I'm on - I'm still INTERMEDIATE cooling.
1213808|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1213810|CDR|Okay, inventory. Camera, tongs, gnomon. Okay, I'm ready to get on. Ready to get on.
1213818|LMP|Okay, you want us to take the - Ouch! That rock by your front porch is really a major nuisance.
1213832|CDR|Oh, doggone it.
1213835|LMP|What's the problem?
1213836|CDR|Oh! Every time I get on, I get dust around. I still haven't learned how to get on yet. You'd think after three times, I'd know better. I know better, but it's - -
1213854|LMP|Okay, I've got the transmitter. I'm heading west - or east. (Laughter) Heading east. Sorry about that. (Humming)
1213911|CDR|Okay, I'm PRIMARY. Okay, you want a nav initialise here, huh, Houston?
1213918|CC|That's affirmative.
1213923|CDR|By the way, Bob, Station 6 is pretty obvious up on the hill. It's fairly high up. I don't know if we'll get to drive up there or not.
1213933|CC|Okay. I think you can see the boulder and that's how you can tell, right?
1213939|CDR|Yes. And the crater. A shame not to - Well, maybe that's the wrong one. I'll have to check the map. A shame not to go to Station 1. Sure is a shame. Why don't you consider Station 1 as a possibility? Okay, Bob, let me give you some numbers.
1214012|CC|We're ready.
1214013|CDR|Sun shadow is zero. I am rolled right 4 degrees. I am pitch zero. I can't be rolled right 4 degrees. That indicator can't be right. I question that. If the roll indicator's right, I might be rolled left a couple of degrees.
1214054|CDR|Are you happy with that, Bob? I'm - roll indicator is indicating - make it 3 degrees right - 3 degrees right.
1214101|CC|Okay, and I copy - Okay, torque to 279 will be the heading - 279.
1214118|CDR|Okay.
1214132|CDR|Okay, the heading when I put the NAV POWER breaker IN, Bob, was 23 - 234.
1214140|CC|Okay, I copy that. We'll torque that to 279.
1214147|CDR|Okay. I'm waiting for my minute and a half here.
1214150|CC|Roger that.
1214207|PAO|Steno is a crater about 1 kilometer south and east of the Lunar Module. Station 1 was -
1214220|LMP|By the way, Bob, LMP is at 39 percent, 3.88, and no flags, no tones.
1214234|CC|Okay. Copy that, Jack.
1214238|LMP|I'm at the SEP site, and I found a place I think we can lay out a pretty good grid.
1214246|CC|Okay, Jack, and when you lay it down there, we want to put it down with the gnomon side, the side you're going to face, you want to put that facing away from the Sun. We found out a thermal constraint this evening, just as the EVA started.
1214305|LMP|Okay. Away from the Sun. Gnomon - you want the gnomon side or corner?
1214314|CC|The gnomon side away from the Sun. That's those - the side with the solar panel has to be away from the Sun. The sides with the solar panel ... to be in the shade.
1214322|LMP|Okay.
1214332|CDR|Bob, everything's working fine so far. She's zeroed and I'm torqued. And I'm ready to press on. RESET is back OFF. Okay, Jack, here I come.
1214344|LMP|Okay. You see me?
1214346|CDR|No, I'm facing the other way.
1214402|CDR|Boy, I tell you - just about all you can see in that direction is the LM. Boy, that's tough driving into the Sun!
1214408|LMP|Go right to the LM, and then a little bit to your left, to the left of the LM.
1214417|CDR|... Yes, I've got to go to the LM and give them a reading here.
1214421|LMP|Okay.
1214423|CC|That's affirmative, Gene.
1214423|CDR|You get that - that shadow up there and you're all right.
1214427|CDR|Say again, Bob?
1214428|CC|That's affirmative. We want the range and bearing at the LM. I'm glad you remembered.
1214434|CDR|Yes, sir, I'll give it to you. I even got - Oh, oh, don't get in there. Whoo! I even got the low gain working for you. I don't know if you're using it.
1214452|CC|I think we're using the LM right now.
1214501|CDR|Boy, that LM is pretty. Whoo!
1214517|LMP|Bob, everything I've seen so far indicates that the so-called subfloor boulders, if we have gotten that deep, are this gabbro. I'm out here at the SEP site, and the large blocks are still the plagioclase pyroxene - -
1214543|CDR|Jack, let me give them a range. I'll be on my way out.
1214545|LMP|Go ahead.
1214546|CDR|Okay, bearing 292, 0.2, and 0.2. I'm standing right in front of the MESA.
1214553|CC|Okay. Beautiful, Geno. Thank you.
1214559|CDR|Okay. I'm coming, Jack.
1214607|LMP|The zap pits are nice white halos, although, for the most part, the rock's too coarse to show them very well. Some of the larger ones have white halos. We may not be down to the subfloor, but - it's hard to say.
1214629|CDR|Hey, Bob, making 8 to 10 kilometers, and I'm barely moving.
1214638|CDR|Where've you got the SEP, Jack?
1214640|LMP|Right out over there.
1214643|CDR|Okay, let me give them a bearing, distance, and range, and some numbers here. Meet you over there.
1214650|LMP|Okay.
1214654|CDR|Oh!
1214703|LMP|Bob, I did see a dense gray rock that's different than the others on my traverse out here. We'll try to find some of that, too.
1214712|CDR|Okay, Bob, I'm reading 278, 003, and 003 at the SEP site.
1214723|CC|Okay. Copy that, Geno. And how about giving me amp-hours and batteries just as long as you're there?
1214730|CDR|Yes, sir, it's coming at you. Amp-hours are 112 and 110; batteries are 9 - 92 and about 1 - about 112.
1214746|CC|Okay, copy that, Geno.
1214747|CDR|Motors are all off scale low.
1214749|CC|Yes, okay thank you.
1214753|CDR|NAV is going to RESET.
1214756|CC|Say again there, Gene. You're going to go to RESET, right?
1214803|CDR|Yes, sir; going to RESET.
1214804|CC|Okay. Jack, you can be getting on. You won't need a bomb, and I guess you won't need the LMP camera unless you want it. We'll be deploying the bomb at Steno.
1214822|LMP|(Laughter) I thought we were playing it by the checklist, Geno. Here's the bomb.
1214826|CDR|Okay, give it to me.
1214827|LMP|The charge.
1214829|CDR|I've got it.
1214829|CC|Yes, it just happens that the station is at the place we're going to deploy the charge.
1214836|LMP|Okay, well, we got it off.
1214838|CDR|Okay. Do you know which side of Steno he wants us to go, Jack?
1214841|LMP|Not yet.
1214842|CC|Yes. We're going - Okay, let me fill you in on the plan, guys. We're going to go to the west side of Steno, - which is where you would have driven by anyway, and the stop is - will be at the 340/1.2, which is where you've got the little Delta for EP 6, in your checklist. And we will plan on spending about 30 minutes there sampling primarily boulders.
1214918|LMP|Okay, Geno, west side of Steno there.
1214920|CDR|Okay. I got it here. Okay - -
1214927|LMP|You got a good feeling on how to head out of here?
1214929|CDR|Yes. I want to get around the back side - now that I'm down there, on the back side of Trident, and make sure that that's what I'm looking at, is Trident over there.
1214942|LMP|Okay, let me try to get on this thing.
1214945|CC|Okay. And, 17, just to fill you in a little bit more here. We're looking at a 6 plus 45 EVA. We've given you 15 minutes to drive to Station 1; 30 minutes at Station 1; and 15 minutes to drive back to the SEP, and then deploying the SEP for 22 minutes. And then a 40 minute closeout at 6 plus 45.
1215011|CDR|I'm sorry, Bob. After 30 minutes at Station 1, what did you say?
1215015|CC|Okay. Then we're going to drive back. There's a 15-minute return to the SEP site, and then 22 minutes at the SEP site to deploy the SEP, and then return to the LM in 45 minutes for the closeout.
1215030|CDR|Okay. Understand.
1215035|CDR|Okay, you strapped in?
1215036|LMP|Yes, sir.
1215038|CDR|Yes, we've got to start getting on this Rover facing 90 degrees to the seats, I think. I did the same thing.
1215044|LMP|Did I kick dust?
1215045|CDR|Yes, we both did.
1215046|LMP|I tried to knock it all off my feet.
1215048|CDR|Yes. That's impossible. Okay, Jack. Let's see if we can't get around - around Trident East over here.
1215055|LMP|Well, I don't - I wish I didn't have this charge. If they played it by the checklist - I wasn't paying attention. Okay - -
1215102|CDR|We're on the move, Bob.
1215105|LMP|Okay, this is Trident, isn't it? So we're starting out - -
1215109|CDR|Well, it's got to be.
1215111|LMP|Yes. So, you're starting out on the - You really want to hit about 29 - -
1215119|CDR|No, no, no.
1215119|LMP|No, wait a minute. Where are we?
1215120|CDR|We want to go southeast.
1215122|LMP|181 - -
1215125|CC|17, we'll start out on the same general traverse that you've been on. It's just that we'll stop it sooner.
1215136|LMP|Yes, we understand.
1215137|CC|Okay.
1215137|LMP|We're just getting our bearings, Bob.
1215140|CDR|This has got to be Trident East, right, right here, Jack. See that? That's got to be Trident East. That's the big one.
1215147|LMP|On the right or the left?
1215148|CDR|On the right.
1215149|LMP|Yes.
1215150|CDR|And we - and Poppy - and was just over about where - -
1215155|LMP|Watch your -
1215155|CDR|Yes. I just want to get our bearings here. You can't look to the east.
1215200|LMP|Okay. I've got to - That's an awful big depression over there, isn't it? Says go along this way.
1215214|CDR|Boy, it sure is. Whee!
1215220|LMP|Watch it. Ho - ho - ho hold it, hold it, hold it!
1215223|CDR|Got it, got it, got it ...
1215229|LMP|Boy, I tell you I've got to get out of east.
1215231|CDR|Stand by.
1215233|LMP|Gene, I think - I'm going to head about 120 out of here.
1215237|CDR|Well, it's a -
1215240|LMP|You've got another hole on your right here.
1215241|CDR|I got it.
1215243|LMP|Whoa, whoa. I'm not sure what's wrong. Why don't you go left there?
1215248|CDR|Okay.
1215249|LMP|Go left around this thing.
1215251|CC|And, 17; Houston. For your advice, we're trying to use the low gain antenna on this traverse also. Might try and be good guys and turn it for us when you have to.
1215305|LMP|Okay. Bob.
1215306|CC|That's general reminder number 1.
1215314|LMP|Gene, I think we need to head south.
1215318|CDR|Yes. We've got to go out here southeast. What's that big map look like in relation to Bare Mountain to you?
1215326|LMP|You mean the - I'm not sure I can get through it. Okay.
1215335|CDR|Okay, I want - it calls for 116 at 0.62 - -
1215339|LMP|...
1215339|CDR|- ... near the SEP.
1215343|LMP|I ended up with this charge in my hand. There's a big - What are you headed now, south pretty much?
1215351|CDR|Yes.
1215353|LMP|I think you're getting - That must be station - that must be Emory over there. See with all the blocks in the wall?
1215402|CDR|Where you looking? Which way?
1215405|LMP|Southeast. Way over there.
1215407|CDR|Yes.
1215408|LMP|That may very well go - this is very easily Steno right over here. Let's - let's see, we're between the two big ones - that would be - -
1215414|CDR|That would be Powell.
1215415|LMP|That would be Powell on the right.
1215417|CDR|You think?
1215419|LMP|Certainly doesn't look like the L&A yet.
1215422|CDR|No, it sure doesn't.
1215424|CC|How about a range and bearing, guys, I think we can help you.
1215429|CDR|Okay, 330, 0.3.
1215436|CC|Okay, it sounds like you're probably just driving by the East Trident or Trident 3.
1215446|LMP|You think all that right there is Trident?
1215449|CDR|By god, if it is, that's incredible. I - I - That's hard to believe.
1215453|LMP|Well, ... - you're going to go in a hole with your right - No problem.
1215457|CDR|I can't see the lip too well because of the - -
1215500|LMP|Well, if that's Trident -
1215503|CC|Okay. And, Jack, if you - do you have your camera on - -
1215505|LMP|Boy, I wish ...
1215505|CC|- - If so, could you give me a frame count some time?
1215511|LMP|Bob, I got my hands full with this charge.
1215513|CC|Oh, okay, forgot about that one. Sorry about that.
1215514|LMP|It's - Looks like 45.
1215524|CC|Okay, copy that. Thank you.
1215534|LMP|Boy, if that's Trident, whoo!
1215538|CDR|Hey, you know that is - don't you suppose that's Trident?
1215540|LMP|Well, it sure looks like it, doesn't it?
1215542|CDR|Yes. We were quite a ways from Trident.
1215546|LMP|I bet you it is.
1215546|CDR|If that's true, we're at 342.4. That's about right; we're half a mile - that's about right. Boy, what I was looking at Trident isn't nearly that - any where near that big.
1215557|LMP|Okay, if that's true, then we want to go - -
1215559|CDR|Yes, sir.
1215601|LMP|- - we want to go 181.
1215603|CDR|Yes, sir, we're all right now. That's got to be Trident. What we were looking at before - I've got to stop and see what that is. I've got to look at those maps when we get in.
1215612|LMP|Well, it's a triplet all right, with some septar between. Well, wish I could take pictures. Take a few, but - -
1215627|CDR|Well, let me get a few here.
1215628|LMP|No. You keep pressing. We can get them coming back.
1215636|LMP|Take a few, but it's not continuous. My hands are giving out. I wish I hadn't said follow the checklist. Okay, we're at 0.5 and 346. And the surface has not really changed except slightly more hummocky and rolling, because of a larger number of irregular depressions, or craters. The - boom! - the rocks at first glance from the Rover look very much like what we had around the LM. That's the big ones.
1215721|CC|And, 17, you might be - -
1215721|LMP|There are occasional - -
1215724|CC|- - Jack, you might be expecting WATER flag and a tone in a couple of minutes, to go to AUX.
1215731|LMP|Okay.
1215735|CC|And CDR will be about 5 minutes after that.
1215737|CDR|I'll get stopped here in a minute, Jack - as soon as I get -
1215742|LMP|Okay. I think maybe that might be Steno over there -
1215745|CDR|I don't think we're too far off.
1215748|LMP|Okay, there's my - I've got to go to AUX.
1215751|CDR|Can you reach it?
1215751|LMP|I hope so.
1215809|LMP|Okay, Houston, do you see me in AUX?
1215812|CC|Stand by. Roger. We see you in AUX.
1215821|CDR|I'm going to hit some of these broadside, Jack, and then we won't get any roll angle.
1215830|LMP|Okay, how far have you come?
1215832|CDR|I've got to go 0.7 - about another 0.7 mi - kilometers. I may be coming up on the edge of it. I don't know, I may - I'm on the right bearing. Yes. We're all right. Steno has got that dimple on the north. Boy, this is a heck of a way to start out our navigation because it's into the cross-Sun here - not cross-sun - but Sun. Now, that's got to be Powell, wouldn't you say?
1215900|LMP|Yes. Must be. Must be.
1215905|CDR|Listen, you - -
1215905|LMP|Then that's Steno with all the blocks in it.
1215908|CDR|Boy, an I glad we didn't land out here! Whew!
1215910|LMP|See this high point up here coming ahead?
1215913|CDR|Yes.
1215913|LMP|That should give us our bearings, I hope. I can't hold that bomb any longer.
1215918|CDR|What are you going to do with it?
1215919|LMP|I'm going to drop it at my feet.
1215922|CDR|Okay.
1215923|LMP|Okay, it's there.
1215924|CDR|Keep it between your feet.
1215925|LMP|It will, My hands aren't going to be any good for sampling.
1215932|CDR|Okay, that's Powell, huh?
1215947|LMP|Yes.
1215953|LMP|Okay, if that's Powell. Quite a ways over there, but I think the thing to do is get up on that little ridge there.
1220003|CDR|Yes. I think we may end up looking right into Steno when we get up there. Bob, we're 342.9.
1220013|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1220018|CC|340 and 1. - -
1220019|CDR|Are you reading the low gain, by the way?
1220020|CC|Yes. Roger. Beautiful. 340 and 1.2 is what we expect the station to be.
1220037|CC|And it should be up on the top of a little bit of a rise. That you see coming up there. Almost to that rise. You ought to be in the vicinity of some very large boulders.
1220047|CDR|Houston, there's a - there are certainly a lot of big boulders - Whoops! ... Let me take a look into the Sun here. That doesn't look what I thought Steno looked like. There's no dimple there. 1.2 he said. All right. This is it over here, though, I guess.
1220108|CC|Yes, Steno ought to be at - right at your 9 o'clock there, Gene.
1220117|CDR|At my 9 o'clock. Yes.
1220120|CC|Either that or your 3 o'clock. I forgot which one it is.
1220122|CDR|How do you know where we are?
1220128|CDR|I think, you're probably right, although it doesn't impress me as what I saw in the L&A. How much time have we got to drive now, Bob?
1220135|CC|Okay, stand by.
1220137|CDR|I think that's probably Emory up there.
1220142|LMP|That's Steno, I guess.
1220144|CC|Yes, yes, seven - Gene and Jack, we'd like you to - If you're in the vicinity, we think you're just about there. We were planning on you leaving the SEP and getting to this place at about 4 plus 58 and we're showing about 5 plus 00 right now so you're right on time. And if you're at 340 and 1.2 in that vicinity, you must be at the station or very close to it where you can see. Over.
1220210|LMP|Well, it doesn't look real familiar, Bob, as far as Steno is concerned. Okay, I got - I think they can locate us if we work that block field right there.
1220220|CDR|Let me get my water.
1220221|CC|Okay, on the map we're showing, Jack, that you're probably looking at, you're seeing that there's a couple of boulders at - just above - at about the - With north being 12 o'clock, there are a couple of boulders at about the 09:30 position on Steno. And then there's a couple of more at about the 9 o'clock position on Steno. And we're putting the station right in the midst of all those boulders. Over.
1220248|LMP|Well, Bob, I don't know. It's hard - hard to follow that that's where we are. I'm not sure. It doesn't look like what I expected Steno to look like - -
1220257|CDR|No, me neither.
1220258|CC|Okay. What's the range and bearing one more time?
1220303|CDR|Okay, 346, 1.1. I think it would almost be worth - I bet that's Emory up on that hill. It's got to be.
1220325|LMP|Yes.
1220327|CDR|Okay, well, let's - -
1220328|LMP|We better park in this boulder field here.
1220332|CDR|... boulder field.
1220334|LMP|... Wish we could have gotten near one of the big ones, but let's do it. We're going to run out of time.
1220338|CDR|Yes.
1220339|CC|That's affirmative, guys - -
1220340|CDR|... big one anyway.
1220341|LMP|Okay. You want me - -
1220341|CC|- - There's no point in deviating around and spending 15 minutes trying to get to a particular spot or down to a bigger boulder. You must be in the near vicinity. If you're really worried about it, I guess you might drive a little bit to the east to the rim of the - -
1220353|LMP|Okay. We got - -
1220354|CC|- - crater, unless you're there. Over. Your judgment.
1220357|LMP|No, we're okay. We got a good place.
1220400|CC|All right.
1220402|CDR|Okay, I'm parked - I'm parked 180.
1220408|CC|Roger. Stand by on that a minute.
1220414|CDR|You want us to get off? What do you mean?
1220414|CC|Okay. No - -
1220415|CDR|What heading?
1220416|CC|- - Okay. I was just wondering about where you were going to park. Go ahead and park 180. There was a question on whether they wanted us to park into the Sun, but don't worry.
1220423|CDR|Okay, I'm heading - -
1220425|CC|180 is a good heading.
1220427|CDR|Okay, I'm headed - I'm headed - I'm headed 182, 346, 1.2, 1.1, 110, 108, 100, and 118, and off scale low on all of the bo - motors.
1220453|CC|Okay. I copy that.
1220455|LMP|Bob, can we deploy - Okay. You want this charge deployed here?
1220512|CC|That's affirmative, Jack.
1220514|LMP|I'll deploy it now.
1220515|CC|You can deploy it right now. That's good.
1220524|PAO|That's a one-pound charge for the lunar seismic profiling experiment.
1220525|LMP|Okay, the fenders are still on, thank goodness.
1220528|CC|Beautiful. We'll give you the Taper of the Year award.
1220535|CDR|Boy, you're going to have to give me the Dust of the Year Award after this.
1220539|LMP|Pin 1, ... two -
1220543|LMP|MARK, SAFE.
1220546|LMP|Pin 3 -
1220547|LMP|MARK, SAFE.
1220551|LMP|That will be in the pans, Geno.
1220554|CDR|Okay.
1220554|CC|Okay, I copy that.
1220556|LMP|Bob, you got MODE ... - -
1220558|CC|Just to confirm that is EP-6, right?
1220611|CC|17, Houston. Do you read?
1220615|LMP|Okay, Bob; we're about 15 meters from a 20-meter blocky rimmed crater. It's about 3 - 3 to 4 meters deep. All the blocks on the rim look like the pyroxene, plagioclase gabbro - the vesicular rocks seen at the LM. At least all that I've seen so far.
1220651|CC|Okay. I copied that, Jack. And is this crater to the east or west?
1220701|LMP|It's to the northwest of the Rover.
1220704|CC|Okay; copy that.
1220706|LMP|The vesicu - visicle popula - the vesicle population varies from about a 2 milli - a millimeter to 1 centimeter. It forms about 15 percent of the rock - 10 to 15. And I've given you grain size and - for the rocks near the LM and that goes well for this one.
1220736|CC|Okay, I copy that, Jack. Very good.
1220743|LMP|There is - the parting that I mentioned, still of somewhat unknown origin, and we'll try and get a sample along a parting plane. It's clearly evident in one of the bigger blocks.
1220803|CDR|Hey, Bob, just as we stopped the Rover, I went on AUX water. Do you want me to turn my primary water off - I don't have to, do I?
1220814|CC|No, no, no need to.
1220819|CDR|That's what I figured. Just wanted to cover all bets. Okay, Jack. I think, I've got my housekeeping done.
1220829|LMP|Okay. Hey, get your hammer. We're going to need it.
1220836|CDR|I've been carrying it all day, it's about time I used it. Okay.
1220840|LMP|Bob, you're going to want a core at this site?
1220842|CC|Roger. We'd like to get - number 1 priority will be some block samples, including any dirt that was on the blocks, If there is such. And then the second priority is a rake soil sample; the third priority is a double core. Then, also in there, the pans, of course, and other documented samples. But the double core is there although it is third priority.
1220906|CDR|Okay.
1220910|LMP|Gene, do you think - Got you gnomon, huh?
1220911|CDR|Yes, I've got my gnomon, and I've got to give a TGE. When you said, bring a hammer, I came -
1220916|LMP|I'm sorry.
1220917|CDR|No, no problem.
1220919|LMP|Well, I shouldn't have -
1220920|CDR|The two go hand-in-hand.
1220921|LMP|Nothing disrupts your thought patterns more than somebody saying something.
1220925|CDR|Well, listen, this is my first geology stop. I guess I'm entitled to do that; Bob, you ready for a mark?
1220931|CC|Roger.
1220935|CDR|Okay.
1220937|CDR|MARK it. The light's flashing.
1220939|CC|Copy that.
1220944|CDR|Okay, you got one picked out?
1220947|LMP|Yes, let's hit this - see if we can work on that one, it's at the edge, but it's got - we can chip at the parting plane. And that's one of the things that's come up that I think is of interest that we've got to figure out why they have that foliation in them.
1221001|CDR|Boy, that rock is one of the more vesicular ones I've seen around.
1221003|LMP|Well, they're all about that, Gene. They're too - they're either that or mixed with that variety. In the same boulder, you'll see a - see a nonvesicular - a relatively nonvesicular. Okay, that's the - -
1221020|CDR|Watch your shadow.
1221021|LMP|- - that's the down-Sun. Ooh. Okay, right into the Sun.
1221033|CDR|Okay.
1221034|LMP|Right at that overlapping fracture, huh?
1221038|CDR|Yes.
1221039|LMP|Let me get where I can maybe save the rock. If you can hook your -
1221043|CDR|That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to try and get it right - right up on top is where I'd like to -
1221047|LMP|If you hit it - if you hit it on the right side, it'll go this way, maybe. There you go. Good man.
1221053|CDR|Piece right there.
1221055|LMP|I can get another one, too. Try another one; don't lose that one.
1221059|CDR|Let me get that one for you.
1221101|LMP|I can get it.
1221102|CDR|Got it? Whoops. Can you keep it in sight here for a minute? is that it?
1221114|LMP|Yes. Go ahead. Try hitting - There you go. Can you use the other end against the right side of the Rock?
1221132|CDR|I'm pressing.
1221132|LMP|Oh.
1221135|CDR|It's coming.
1221144|LMP|That's all right.
1221145|CDR|I'll get that one, wait a minute.
1221148|LMP|Be careful down in there.
1221150|CDR|The whole thing is going to fracture off here, in a minute.
1221154|LMP|That's why -
1221202|CDR|Trying.
1221204|LMP|It's trying to fall. Don't wear your hand out. That's good, Gene.
1221211|CDR|Wait a minute. Let me give one more whack. The whole thing is - No, that's too tight. Let me get that other piece -
1221221|LMP|Okay. Bag 476 is the rock sample with a little bit of the soil near it - with a chip - chip off the rock, and it's the - Watch it, Gene.
1221241|CDR|Here's your other chip. If I go down there, that thing is about 15 feet deep.
1221250|LMP|Right. Got it.
1221256|CDR|Okay.
1221256|LMP|Now, do you think you can chip off the other side of that plane, up on the edge?
1221302|CDR|Yes. Yes.
1221303|LMP|Then we'll get the soil, and maybe just a small rock, one nonchipped.
1221310|CDR|Let me tell you - my hands from that drill - -
1221312|LMP|Yes, I'm sure they are.
1221312|CDR|- - Really know I've been out here today.
1221320|LMP|476, Bob.
1221322|CC|Copy that, Jack.
1221323|LMP|It's from the southeast - southeast side of the parting plane -
1221329|CDR|There it is - a whole big slab, right there.
1221330|LMP|Okay, very good.
1221331|CDR|Oh, look at those dark minerals in there. Are those dark black?
1221334|LMP|Yes, they may be ilmenite or fresh pyroxene. We'll look at it. Gives the impression of pyroxene.
1221345|CDR|Okay, you want my bag? I tell you, if you work on any kind of slope, like this little crater - Okay, I'm going to leave it open for a minute.
1221402|LMP|Okay.
1221404|CDR|While we get that one.
1221405|LMP|I'm going to have to - you're going to have to use your tongs on that one, I think.
1221408|CDR|Okay. I got it.
1221413|CC|And, 17, a reminder to factor into your thinking, this is only a 30-minute stop, and there's about 20 minutes remaining.
1221422|LMP|Yes, sir. But we got to sample something.
1221425|CDR|Here's a big one. Get him the bag number, too.
1221427|LMP|Bag 454. Okay, and the flashes are from inside of vugs and recrystallized vesicles. They looke like pyr - pyroxene flashes; they could be ilmenite.
1221446|CDR|I'll get my after picture.
1221448|LMP|Okay; let me - and let me get in there and get some soil.
1221452|CDR|Okay, let's get it first.
1221453|LMP|From the north side. Whoops. Okay, the bag tore around that; it's pretty jagged rock, but I think it'll hold.
1221500|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1221500|LMP|... In yours. Okay? it's in Gene's sample collection bag. And a scoop sample. You got a bag handy, Gene?
1221517|CDR|Okay, bag 455, Bob. It's from the west side of the rock. It's under a slight overhang of the rock - in a shadow, anyway. Okay, that's from about 1 centimeter down - deep, 1 to 2 centimeters. And the next one is down to about 5 - 5 or 6. And it's got some chips in it.
1221552|CDR|That's bag 456, Bob.
1221555|CC|Copy that.
1221606|LMP|Okay. (Laughter)
1221608|CDR|I know. I know.
1221613|LMP|Oh, shoot. 1.2 kilometers is a long way from the LM. Look at the Challenger down there. Makes you get a feel for how big this valley really is.
1221628|CDR|I'd rather not.
1221630|LMP|Okay. I'll help you.
1221634|CDR|I got it.
1221635|LMP|Turn around and let me help you get these in your bag.
1221636|CDR|I learned now. You learn of necessity out here. Okay. See if we can't fill this up for Christmas. Okay, let's - You happy there?
1221651|LMP|Yes, let's - get your after -
1221654|CDR|Okay.
1221654|LMP|And if we can, we might get just a block instead of breaking on it, and then we'll go to the rake. Let's go around to the -
1221704|CDR|Bob wanted a core here, too, huh?
1221708|LMP|Yes, but the rake's next, as you might imagine. Geno, now this - this looks - this stuff here looks a little less vesicular. Why don't we try that one?
1221722|CDR|Hey, here's - ro - look at this rock, where the vesicularity changes from a hummocky vesicularity to a very fine vesicular. Look at this. Let me try and crack - get a - See that? The change?
1221734|LMP|Yes, that's what I'm after; that's it.
1221735|CDR|Let's see if I can't crack - -
1221736|LMP|That's it. That's what I saw in that other boulder.
1221738|CDR|Let's see if I can't crack the corner and get that contact.
1221741|LMP|Yes. And get a piece of both - I think you can get - if you can reach down there.
1221746|CDR|See if I can't get a -
1221754|LMP|That's a contact in a rock.
1221757|CDR|Yes.
1221759|CC|Beautiful. And you guys - do you guys see any 2-meter blouders around there?
1221805|CDR|We just sampled one. ... - -
1221809|CC|Well, if that one showed up in the photos, I wonder why those down near the ALSEP didn't show up.
1221818|LMP|No, we're not where you think we are. We're not sure where we are. Gene, can you get down into that? Need some help?
1221828|CDR|Yes, just - give me the shovel to hold myself with. Give me a shovel.
1221837|CC|I don't know.
1221842|LMP|How about that one?
1221843|CDR|Yes.
1221844|LMP|Get that little piece.
1221845|CDR|Okay, I see it. It's pretty hard. See if I can't - it's low and hard to hit.
1221856|LMP|How about - how about coming around from this side?
1221859|CDR|Well, I got the gnomon in the wrong place really.
1221901|LMP|Let me see your -
1221902|CDR|Can you reach it?
1221903|LMP|Well, I'm going to lean on the - on the rock maybe. I got that other little piece in sight.
1221915|CDR|Okay, I got that piece in sight, too. Let me -
1221918|LMP|Get them both with your -
1221919|CDR|Let me get them both right now.
1221922|LMP|You can stick that in the ground if you -
1221925|CDR|Okay, this is a sample of the - of the more coarsely vesicular rock.
1221936|LMP|You got it in your hand?
1221938|CMP|I got them both. I think, actually, we got a sample of both sides; but I wouldn't bet on it.
1221946|LMP|Okay, I just got a chunk of that side.
1221959|CDR|Okay, I got both of these.
1222001|LMP|See that rock right over there on the little mound, just projecting out of the edge of it?
1222005|CDR|Where are you looking?
1222006|LMP|Right over there.
1222006|CDR|Here?
1222007|LMP|No.
1222008|CDR|Here?
1222008|LMP|Where I'm pointing.
1222008|CDR|There?
1222009|LMP|There you go; you just about touched it. Right there, that piece.
1222012|CDR|Okay, let me get these in a bag here.
1222025|LMP|Well, I'll get that piece; and that's the samples from either side of the contact anyway. Can you get a bag - -
1222034|CDR|They're pretty small.
1222035|CDR|Give me a hammer, and get a bag and I'll - -
1222037|LMP|You take the hammer.
1222038|CDR|I got these in my hand I want to put there.
1222040|LMP|Okay. Bag 477 is the coarsely vesicular rock.
1222045|CDR|Are two of them there? I hope two of them fell in.
1222048|LMP|No, I only got one.
1222051|CDR|Okay, here's that other one. It had to fall right here.
1222058|LMP|I don't think it ever - is that - There it is; get your tongs.
1222102|CDR|Right here?
1222102|LMP|Now you're full of dirt in the scoop; you just covered it up.
1222106|CDR|Got it; I got it.
1222108|LMP|Here, put it in here with the dirt. That's good.
1222112|CDR|A little dirt never hurt anybody.
1222115|LMP|Got it.
1222117|CDR|Okay.
1222118|LMP|477 are two chips of the - They're small, but I think they'll give you the - if there's any compositional difference.
1222126|CDR|But these two are the ones you saw - that right there? That's what you pointed at.
1222133|LMP|Yes, I think you got it.
1222134|CDR|Okay. I'm going to take a - a closeup stereo on that contact.
1222138|LMP|Yes, definitely.
1222140|CC|Okay; and, Jack and Gene, when you get done with that boulder, we'd like you to move on to the - the rake soil sample, please; and that'll be a kilogram sample, please.
1222150|CDR|Yes, sir; we're going to. We're going to.
1222154|LMP|In bag 478 is the chip from the finely - more finely vesicular rock. Both of them are coarse. It's a small chip; but it'll tell the story, I think.
1222210|CDR|Dust, dust, dust, dust. Here you are. I'll go ahead and get a closeup stereo - -
1222214|LMP|Get a closeup, and I'll get the rake. I'll get started on the rake.
1222218|CDR|Okay.
1222223|LMP|Gene, if you can pick up one more rock in that picture, with your tongs, let's bag it.
1222230|CDR|I'll get it.
1222233|LMP|As you come back.
1222237|CC|And, 17. We'd like to have you guys - -
1222239|CDR|Sure wish I could read this.
1222240|CC|- - driving in 10 minutes, please.
1222245|LMP|Nag, nag, nag.
1222248|CC|That's right, that's right, that's right.
1222249|CDR|Boy, I can't see my camera setting, it's so full of dust.
1222255|LMP|Okay. I guess you want to sort of - out in nothing's land here, huh?
1222309|LMP|I can bag it for you, Geno.
1222311|CC|Roger.
1222313|CDR|That's all right. I want to get this closeup here.
1222318|LMP|Okay, I've moved about - 5 meters - 5 to 8 meters northeast of the Rover. And - as soon as Gene gets here with the gnomon -
1222339|CDR|Coming, coming.
1222350|LMP|Bob, I've got a - a sample that was laying next to that boulder. I did not get an after picture of it, but it's - as I was taking my closeup pictures, it - is on my side of the boulder just about 4 or 5 inches, covered with the dark mantle.
1222408|CDR|I think we - I think we probably disturbed that one. It'll probably show up in the befores.
1222414|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1222414|LMP|Okay, we want a rake.
1222421|LMP|And that's in bag 479.
1222426|CC|Okay.
1222428|LMP|Gene, let's rake - let's rake right out there.
1222432|CDR|Look, let's go ahead and bag that one; and I'll get the gnomon out there.
1222436|LMP|Okay.
1222437|CDR|Bob, as you might have seen from the camera, up towards where we think Emory is you get a pretty high concentration of boulders up there.
1222446|CC|Okay. And I think that that's where we thought we were a little bit closer to Emory than you are.
1222455|CDR|Well, we thought about going on up there; although - we're in a pretty good area here, too, from the standpoint of boulders.
1222503|CC|Yes.
1222503|CDR|Again, I think - Face the Sun.
1222504|LMP|I think for the most part, large and small, all the fragments seem to be - seem to be filleted or even mantled by the dark material.
1222520|LMP|Let me get out of your way.
1222521|CDR|Boy, I've got to clean my camera; I can't even see. What area are you going to rake?
1222526|LMP|To the - your left of the - well, ahead of the - ahead of the gnomon and to your left, there.
1222532|CDR|Okay, I got it.
1222534|CC|Okay, Gene, we copy that. That's a good observation. And I also gathered that most of the rocks look pretty much the same.
1222543|LMP|That's what I said.
1222544|CDR|Yes, except a change in vesicularity - -
1222549|CC|Roger.
1222550|CDR|- - in terms of the size of vesicles, where I described one as being a more hummocky vesicular-type rock. The first time I've noticed any of the dark minerals was when we took that one big flat chip off that boulder.
1222606|CC|Okay; copy that.
1222607|CDR|I didn't look at it that close to see what it was.
1222612|CC|Copy that, guys.
1222616|CDR|I'm going to get a pan, Jack, while you're doing that.
1222618|LMP|Okay.
1222619|CC|Good idea, Gene.
1222642|CDR|Man, are there some good targets for the 500 around here. We've got to get those massifs with the 500.
1222657|PAO|The double core will be eliminated at this stop. When it gets started back toward the -
1222707|CC|And, 17; again, we'd like - -
1222709|LMP|Bob, I'm really only penetrating - I'm only penetrating about, at the most, 3 centimeters into this area with the rake. I've picked up a very good sample of bla - of boulders but most of them were - were in that distance of the surface and projecting out of it.
1222730|CC|Okay; I copy that.
1222733|LMP|You ready, Gene?
1222734|CDR|A couple of more. Jack. Okay, coming at you. Bob, the pan is complete. I'll give you a frame count shortly.
1222746|CC|Copy that, Geno.
1222747|CDR|There's two bags, I think.
1222749|LMP|Two bags full. First bag is 457 - -
1222755|CC|Copy that.
1222756|LMP|- - 457.
1222757|CDR|Let me, don't let me - don't let me lose them. That's enough. Give me a couple of small ones.
1222806|LMP|Okay.
1222807|CDR|Okay, that's good. That's good. Okay.
1222818|LMP|Here, ... They are.
1222823|CDR|Okay, in bag 458 is the rest of the - the rake sample. They're all fragments.
1222833|CC|Copy that. Now we need the kilogram of the soil.
1222839|CDR|... Yes, sir.
1222841|LMP|Okay, Bob. All the fragments, of course, are - are completely covered with - the mantle; and they are slightly - oh, maybe 20-percent vesicular. I just took a glance at them. But, for the most part, they appear to be rounded and subrounded fragments.
1222901|CDR|Okay. Let's get the kilogram.
1222915|LMP|Okay.
1222920|LMP|Oh, well, shoot. Start all over.
1222924|CDR|Try it again. 459 will get the kilogram, Bob.
1222929|CC|Copy that.
1222937|LMP|Get some more.
1222939|CDR|Okay, fill it up.
1222952|LMP|Can you close it?
1222953|CDR|Yes, yes, I can close it.
1222955|LMP|That's a good kilogram.
1223004|CDR|Well, I just can't even read my camera anymore. I've got to learn how to control the dust. Okay, that's in.
1223010|LMP|Okay; you get the answer?
1223012|CDR|I tried to blow the dust off my camera - -
1223014|LMP|If we could get a - I think it's going to be hard to get a double core here. We could try a single right there. Bob, we got time to get the core?
1223023|CC|Negative. The core has been deleted. We'd like for you to get your second pan, Jack, and then we'll press on.
1223031|LMP|Okay.
1223037|LMP|I'll get it over here where our two sample sites are in view.
1223041|CC|Copy that.
1223054|CDR|Well, now I know why I felt that we were much too close to Trident than what I thought. We weren't really too close to Trident because Trident is way out here. That makes me feel better. A guy would know if he landed 100 meters from a big set of craters like that. You know, on a landing site like this, you ought to know exactly where you are. Anyway, I landed where I wanted to. Okay, Bob, here's a reading for you.
1223134|CC|Okay. Ready for it.
1223148|CDR|670, 012, 901; 670, 012, 901.
1223156|CC|Okay; copy that, Geno.
1223204|CDR|Okay, and we - no more charges to deploy back - going back, right?
1223207|CC|No, we will deploy charge number 7 on the way back.
1223214|CDR|On the way back. Okay.
1223215|CC|Roger. It will be deployed at the same location we were originally planning on deploying it, which was in the checklist there.
1223225|CDR|Okay. Very good, sir. We'll get at it.
1223238|LMP|Okay. I'm taking your camera.
1223245|CC|Okay. And, Jack, you got the pan or getting it?
1223252|LMP|Yes, sir.
1223254|CDR|And, Bob, CDR is on frame count 60.
1223301|CC|Okay.
1223307|LMP|Which one? And the LMP is on 95.
1223314|CC|Copy, 95.
1223318|LMP|Okay, Gene.
1223320|CDR|We need EP-7, Jack.
1223321|LMP|You got the gnomon?
1223323|CDR|Got the gnomon.
1223324|LMP|And the rake and the scoop?
1223325|CDR|The rake and the scoop are back on. Okay, get the charge. I'll set the low gain, and we'll be - ready to do it.
1223335|LMP|Bob, my impression right now is that the dark mantle may just be a - a - well, at least in here, it's indistinguishable from a regolith that might be derived from these other rocks. It seems to be a little dark for that, but that might be the answer.
1223356|CC|Okay. We'll - -
1223357|LMP|EP-7?
1223357|CC|We're ... to do on that again tomorrow. And EP-7 is the charge, right?
1223358|CDR|EP-7.
1223408|CDR|Jack, I figured out if you - if you mount the Rover at 90 degrees, when you kick up your feet, you - you'll miss the dust.
1223421|LMP|Let me hook you in before I do that.
1223423|CDR|Okay.
1223428|LMP|Just put your seat 90 degrees to it.
1223431|CDR|Yes.
1223433|LMP|Well, you certainly ride high.
1223435|CDR|Do I?
1223436|LMP|Yes. I'm surprised the belt fits.
1223439|CDR|Yes, it fits fine. Okay. I'm in.
1223444|LMP|Okay.
1223452|CDR|Oop -
1223453|LMP|Not too good, huh?
1223456|CDR|Yes. We're learning. I hope my bag was closed. Yours was. Did you get it?
1223502|LMP|Yes - yes. I - as a matter of fact, I did. I thought that.
1223507|CC|Okay, we mark you underway.
1223509|LMP|Hey, you ought to put that sampler d - -
1223512|CDR|Not yet.
1223513|LMP|It's not the sampler - it's these bags with memory.
1223518|CDR|This thing is too high for you. You're hitting it all the time. No, we're not on our way, Bob.
1223523|CC|Okay.
1223528|CDR|Okay. And you want the - charge deployed at 320.7, huh?
1223539|CC|Roger. It will be 0.6. We'll change that to 0.6 on EP-7 but - and it will really be just wherever you cross 0.6 on the range.
1223553|CDR|Okay.
1223554|LMP|Well, it fit once.
1223602|CDR|Did you twist it, Jack? 180, that took out some of your - Wait a minute - here.
1223608|LMP|Which way?
1223609|CDR|Well, I can't see. Your left hand's in the way now. Away from you. Twist it away from you 180 degrees.
1223616|LMP|Like that?
1223618|CDR|Yes, now the other 90. Okay, now try it.
1223625|LMP|Well, let me see.
1223628|CDR|You got it?
1223629|LMP|That should - that should do it. Okay.
1223636|CDR|Okay?
1223637|CDR|Whew. Here's your charge. I think you're learning. That's half of the first EVA. Okay, Bob, we are rolling.
1223647|CDR|MARK it.
1223647|CC|Okay, copy that, Jack - Gene.
1223654|PAO|EP7 is a half-pound charge.
1223655|LMP|Okay, what was it - where did they want it deployed?
1223658|CDR|Six-tenths of a kilometer.
1223701|LMP|Back, huh?
1223702|CC|Roger. It'll be at a range of 0.6, guys.
1223708|LMP|You've got a block right ahead of you.
1223711|CDR|I got it.
1223712|CC|Okay. And remember you'll be taking photos coming back here, Jack - -
1223715|LMP|Okay.
1223716|CC|- - if you get a chance.
1223720|LMP|Yes, sir. Thank you. I got a few going out, Bob, but they weren't too well spaced.
1223727|CC|Okay. And I assume you've got the low gain antenna aligned.
1223732|LMP|Yes, sir; it's aligned. Okay.
1223739|CDR|That's got to be Trident, Jack, because that's too big for anything else.
1223752|LMP|Okay, Houston. There's - the classic raindrop pattern over this fine debris. I'd say that the surface definitely is sorted, the fine regolithic material forming one fraction and then the blocks another. The blocks are prob - those blocks are greater than a - 2 centimeters in diameter. In general, make up less than 10 percent of the surface. But there are some big ones. And it - fairly uniformly distributed. There are blocks a meter in diameter.
1223835|CC|Copy that.
1223836|CDR|Hey, Jack, that big crater out there at 2 o'clock has probably got to be Sherlock. That's got to be Sherlock over there.
1223844|LMP|Yes, probably. I think the only place I've really identified that we can go to is to Station 6.
1223850|CDR|Yes, but you can't - we've got to get on a high vantage point here one of these days.
1223853|LMP|Yes.
1223856|LMP|Well, I think we'll find Camelot without any problem.
1223858|CDR|Yes. Okay, watch. I'm going through it.
1223902|LMP|Okay. No problem.
1223906|CDR|No, I'd rather straddle or go through those little ones.
1223908|LMP|Okay, Bob, here's another crater about the same size we sampled - the last station. And it doesn't have as many blocks, but it does have blocks. And from this distance, their vesicular texture and their light color shows up very well. I suspect they're the same general kind. There's a glass-bottom crater.
1223928|CC|Okay. You got a range and - -
1223929|CDR|...
1223929|CC|- - bearing, there, guys, please.
1223931|CDR|Okay, 341/0.8.
1223936|CC|Copy that.
1223936|CDR|Did you take a picture, Jack?
1223936|LMP|Yes.
1223937|CDR|Okay.
1223947|LMP|You're pointed right at Station 6, I think, Gene.
1223949|CDR|I think you may be right. There's that boulder. I just want to get up here where I can ... - -
1223952|LMP|Not the one on the track but the one over there to the right of that.
1223957|LMP|Unless the one with the track - I'm - I've got mixed emotions which is 6.
1224002|CDR|That's - that's probably - look over there to the left. You see that.
1224007|LMP|Yes.
1224009|CDR|That's Trident. Man, I'll tell you.
1224011|LMP|Look at this thing. That looks like the same kind of rock except it doesn't have any vesicles.
1224018|CDR|There's some white stuff in that rock. Just let me take a quick peek ...
1224022|CDR|See that one right in front of it? Take a picture of it.
1224026|LMP|Oh, you mean this one, here.
1224028|CDR|Oh, that's a - that's a big zap pit, isn't it? Take a picture of that?
1224035|LMP|Yes, they're big zap pits. Same rock with big zap pits. I got to change the - well, ... Okay. Although there are - I think those are zap pits. It's a little hard to say.
1224046|CDR|Looks like a big chip out of the rock.
1224049|LMP|They're white halos; it just has more of them.
1224051|CDR|But it's a big one; it's about an inch and a half or 2 inches across.
1224053|LMP|Yes.
1224059|CDR|I tell you, I've got to go and get my size and geometry squared away.
1224104|CC|Okay, 17, how about - -
1224106|CDR|Did you see this one?
1224106|CC|- - range and bearing?
1224107|LMP|Yes.
1224111|CDR|Okay. 341/0.7. Bob, we're moving at about 11 clicks right now.
1224118|CC|Copy that. Beautiful. Remember the charge goes off at 0.6.
1224122|LMP|Doesn't sound like - Okay.
1224134|LMP|Okay, we want to - -
1224136|CDR|Oh, there's the mantle - there's the white mantle Jack, look over there. Can you look to your left?
1224139|LMP|Yes, it does. Yes.
1224141|CDR|That's the white mantle.
1224142|LMP|Swing around that way.
1224143|CDR|Call it a slide or not, but that's the white mantle. Whoo! That's my first real good picture of it. That is something.
1224151|LMP|Okay, I got some of that. Okay, how are we doing?
1224157|CDR|I don't want to go in that crater, that's what I don't want to do. Okay. We're at 0.6; how about 339/0.6 -
1224203|LMP|Okay. I got a couple of shots right out in there.
1224207|CDR|Okay. Coming right around to you.
1224208|LMP|Oh, that's good. Hold that heading. Whoa. That'll be good.
1224213|CDR|Right here?
1224214|LMP|Yes, whoa.
1224215|CDR|Okay. Let me get my - Okay, I got my locator.
1224223|LMP|Okay, now this one we want me to get a partial pan until something's identified.
1224228|CDR|Okay. We'll do that. We've got to turn that way anyway.
1224232|LMP|Okay, pin 1, pull, SAFE. Pin 2, pull, SAFE. Pin 3 -
1224242|LMP|MARK it, pull, SAFE.
1224243|CC|Okay. And I copy that as charge number 7.
1224249|LMP|That's affirm.
1224254|CC|Okay. And we'd like a frame number when you get done there, Jack, after you get it on the ground.
1224303|LMP|Okay, stand by. Okay. I think we'll miss that.
1224310|CDR|Okay. Bearing is 339//0.6.
1224312|LMP|Okay, start a - a pan around it, Gene - -
1224316|CC|Copy that, Gene - -
1224317|LMP|Okay, let me get it out - Okay, I'm going to start slowly ... Okay.
1224323|CDR|Going to miss it?
1224324|LMP|Yes, by a lot.
1224328|CDR|Okay, taking your pictures?
1224329|LMP|Yes, sir. Wheels cleared it by - it's got to be a lot. is my low gain dropping out?
1224341|CDR|How much are my wheels missing it by - going around?
1224344|LMP|Lots. About a meter.
1224346|CDR|Okay. Okay, we're on our way. The low gain is set again.
1224352|CDR|Okay, we're heading on back to SEP.
1224354|CC|Okay, and a frame count there, Jack.
1224355|LMP|Okay, pan - was more - the pan was more or less complete at 146.
1224404|CC|Copy, 146 on Hotel.
1224414|LMP|Bob, you know, the more I look at this - Watch out for those babies there - at this - at this dark dust, if you will, the more it doesn't seem like the kind of thing you'd expect to have been derived from the underlying bedrock. But I think you're going to have to play that game in the lab right now.
1224438|CC|Okay, I copy that. Can you - -
1224440|LMP|We'll see how it works out later.
1224441|CC|Roger.
1224447|LMP|It just seems dark and much too fine grained. You don't have the impression that you're getting the size distribution you'd expect to get by having all these blocks around.
1224506|CC|Okay, I copy that.
1224506|LMP|Definitely, I think, at least in my mind, ... population - size population - -
1224514|CDR|Jack, that almost looks like bedrock over exposed in there. See that?
1224518|LMP|Yes, why don't you take a pass over that way. Get through there?
1224522|CDR|Yes, I can get through there.
1224524|LMP|Do you know where you are?
1224525|CDR|Yes.
1224526|LMP|In Trident?
1224527|CDR|Yes, no - no, we're not in Trident. That's awful - that's pretty steep down in there. I'd walk down there. I'm not sure I want to drive down there yet.
1224535|LMP|No, I didn't mean down in there. I meant right over there.
1224537|CDR|Well, here's some right here too.
1224538|LMP|Yes. ...
1224539|CDR|Take a picture of that?
1224539|LMP|Yes.
1224541|CC|And how about a range and bearing when you've stopped taking pictures?
1224546|CDR|Okay - -
1224547|CC|We need a - -
1224547|CDR|336/0.4.
1224550|CC|336/0.4. Roger.
1224559|CDR|Bob, I get a distinct impression that - Jack says it's going to be hard to tell whether this is regolith composed from the rock field we see around, but - I get a distinct impression - you can see that dark mantle on top of almost all the rocks. Except we have fresh glass, possibly, in the bottom of some of these small craters.
1224620|CC|Okay.
1224621|CDR|Everywhere else there is actually mantle, I believe, in and around some of the crevices and in the vesicles and what have you.
1224630|CC|Okay, I copy - -
1224631|CDR|It's all material though, that could be - it's material that could be knocked in there by the local impact.
1224643|CC|Okay; but I gather you find a lot of material on top of the rocks.
1224649|LMP|I think we lost them.
1224651|CDR|Not a lot, Bob. Not a lot. It's there, though.
1224654|CC|Okay; copy that.
1224655|CDR|They're not nearly as covered with dust as they - as they get when - when you drop one. It's just a - it's really a salting or a scattering of debris in the depressions - -
1224709|CC|Okay.
1224710|CDR|- - on the rock. The projections of the rock are perfectly clean.
1224712|CC|Okay. I copy that.
1224714|LMP|Yes, but most of all - most of all the craters are - have relatively ..., except where the rocks are showing the boulders on the sides, or - within the craters are evident - are subtly covered over with this mantle. You don't see any good sharp ridges - walls on some of these craters. Even the small ones.
1224740|CC|Okay. Roger on that.
1224746|CDR|Man, I tell you, you could lose the rear end of this thing in a hurry, if you'd like.
1224749|LMP|I think you have lost a fender. I keep getting rained on here.
1224753|CDR|Oh, no.
1224754|LMP|Look at that rooster tail - look what's ahead of us here.
1224759|CDR|Yes, that's probably it. It probably didn't stay. I can see it in a shadow.
1224805|LMP|Sure, look at it.
1224806|CDR|Oh boy, that's going to be terrible. That is really going to be bad.
1224813|LMP|I didn't see it. We probably lost it. I think I know when because I just started to notice it. Bob, I'm going to state what Gene said slightly differently. There just aren't a lot of very sharp, bright craters, but there are some. All the craters seem to be pretty well formed. It isn't an extensive mantle. Matter of fact, for example, hasn't filled the base - Are we due to deploy that thing now?
1224843|CDR|Yes, I - want to - want to - come in at a -
1224847|LMP|Hasn't filled the bottom of the craters.
1224849|CDR|I'm going to come in at a heading here and see if I can get on it for you.
1224853|LMP|Okay, drop me off there.
1224857|CDR|Look at that fender. Look at the dust it's produced. Look at the LCRU.
1224903|LMP|Yes, it's going to make - -
1224904|CDR|I don't know how to keep that thing on.
1224910|LMP|Make it west.
1224912|CDR|Okay, I'm rolling west right now.
1224914|LMP|That looks good. That looks good. Hold that heading.
1224919|CDR|Boy, I don't like losing that fender.
1224929|LMP|We're back at the SEP, Bob. I'm starting to lay out my first track.
1224933|CC|Roger. Copy that.
1224943|LMP|How's our time, Bob?
1224947|CDR|Okay?
1224949|CC|Roger. You're about 5 minutes behind on the - the arrival time at the SEP. But we're - we're - No real problems. And I assume that the range and bearing, when you got there, was about zero.
1225003|LMP|Okay, get - Let me leave my camera.
1225007|CDR|Well, let me read it. 252, 2.5, and 0. I'm resetting.
1225011|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1225012|LMP|And the LMP frame count is 19 - 197, and it was still turning.
1225019|CDR|Amp-hours are 108, 105, and batteries are 100 and 120.
1225027|CC|Okay. Copy 100 and 120.
1225029|LMP|Okay. Oh, wait a minute. I need my camera, don't I?
1225033|CDR|Yes, sir.
1225035|CC|I don't think it's much good to you with a 197 there, Jack.
1225038|LMP|No, I don't. I don't need my camera.
1225043|CC|Roger on that.
1225044|LMP|We're deploying it. No, you take the pictures. I don't need it. Go ahead, play it out.
1225051|CDR|Okay; you're right. Okay, here we go. I'm headed out.
1225055|LMP|Okay, Houston. The location is in about the least cratered area I could find, between a large crater or a large depression that's about - oh, ranges from maybe 50 to 150 meters behind the LM. That's maybe - south - or east-southeast; and it's between that depression and another large depression that is really a doublet with a blocky septum between them. That's to the northeast of the LM about 200 meters; that's the start of that second depression. I think we can get a nice layout, although there'll be a general slope, I believe, towards the LM - of about a degree.
1225208|CC|Okay, that's no real problem, Jack.
1225218|CDR|Jack, am I about abeam of you? I can't see.
1225221|LMP|Yes.
1225222|CDR|Okay, I'll turn in around this crater.
1225229|LMP|Hey, if you come right ... -
1225253|LMP|That depression to the northeast is at least a couple hundred meters in diameter, and it's joined with one that's probably of comparable size just to the northwest of the first depression.
1225313|CC|Okay, I copy that too, Jack.
1225317|CDR|Okay. How's that look, Jack?
1225323|LMP|Great.
1225325|CDR|Far enough?
1225326|LMP|Yes. Yes, come back.
1225333|CDR|... we head on up to Station 2 without that fender and are we going to be full of dust.
1225342|LMP|Okay, there's no special -
1225345|CDR|I can park 180 but -
1225403|CDR|Okay, Bob, I've stopped - back at the SEP.
1225406|CC|Copy that, Gene.
1225414|CDR|Dropped the - One came out, Jack.
1225416|LMP|Oh, yes. This thing is a lot harder to turn than it was in training.
1225434|CDR|Oops. Okay, that's the first two we've got to deploy. Can you bring your tongs?
1225439|LMP|Yes.
1225440|CDR|Bob, ... do you want me to dust here? I'll dust back at the LM. We're going to deploy the SEP. God bless.
1225456|CC|Okay. They all say to dust, Geno.
1225502|CDR|Okay. You're going to have to wait for me, Jack.
1225507|LMP|Well, I've got antennas all over the place here.
1225509|CDR|Yes, as a matter of fact, you do. Stand by one second. I'll make it a quick one.
1225514|LMP|That's all right. No, I can handle it, I think, here. But we're going to need your tongs to pick them up and not get them all confused. Okay, where's the - where's the shadow graph? There it is. Sun quadrant - that's the Sun quadrant.
1225538|CDR|For sure we lost that fender.
1225553|LMP|Okay, I'll deploy number 2 and 4. And, let's see, that's number 1. This one must be number 2. It is.
1225634|CDR|Okay, I'm almost there, Jack. Let me run around and dust. Let me tell you, this dust isn't going to be fun tomorrow.
1225652|LMP|Okay, I won't bore you with details on why you see the antenna all over the ground (laughter) but it has to do with 1/6 g.
1225711|CC|Roger, Jack. Understand you dropped a couple of the antenna reels.
1225714|LMP|You know, Bob, they're very - more accurately, I dropped three of them. Bob, you know this fine-grained dust that we're in could be ground-up pyroclastic. It might grind more easily than other things, and the blocks are just the - those blocks that have been excavated from below that pyroclastic by the larger craters and some of the smaller ones in the area.
1225747|CDR|MARK, gravimeter reading.
1225748|CC|Okay; mark that. Roger, Jack. That would make a nice story, wouldn't it?
1225755|LMP|... Well, you'd think glassy pyroclastic might turn into regolith a little bit faster than some of these other things. But we'll check that one out.
1225812|CC|Okay.
1225813|CDR|You want 2?
1225814|LMP|Two, and you get 1. Right there.
1225816|CC|And, Jack, did you get the reels straightened out again?
1225822|LMP|Yes, they're okay.
1225824|CC|Thank you.
1225825|LMP|How can you stop a crew like this?
1225828|CC|I don't know any way.
1225831|LMP|In all modesty, I mean. Okay, Geno, I'm on my way. Pull gently on that thing because I - it's awful easy to knock it over. I had that geophone module all over the place.
1225847|CDR|I can't tell whether I'm pulling gently or not.
1225850|LMP|Any time you feel a tug, stop.
1225855|PAO|This antenna's being deployed in tracks that have been made by the rover.
1225902|CC|Careful, guys.
1225904|CDR|At least we're pulling at the base. I better watch what I'm backing into. There's a lot of holes around here.
1225930|LMP|Well, it happened, Bob. I'm glad we Velcroed those - tabs.
1225943|CDR|Okay, I'm at the end, Jack. Are you having -
1225946|LMP|Well, I - What happened was which we thought might happen. It twisted on my - I'll be there in just a second.
1225958|CDR|Okay, I want f/11 at 250th and 74 feet. Well - ah, ah, ah, ah. Ah, ah, yes; you're pulling it over.
1230020|LMP|I'm not. You are.
1230022|CDR|No, I'm not. I've got all sorts of slack in here.
1230025|LMP|Okay, it's okay.
1230029|CDR|All right. Are you out there?
1230031|LMP|Yes.
1230032|CDR|Okay, let me back up - a skosh and take the slack out. And I would say, offhand -Oh, boy, what have you got a - that's about as close to a 1/6th g orthogonal - at least, not orthogonal yet, but straight lined. That's it Jack, here.
1230105|CDR|Stay there, and I'll take a picture.
1230106|LMP|I thought you did.
1230109|CDR|No. Okay, I got it now.
1230114|CDR|Hey, if you try and stick that thing in, Jack, you're going to fall over. Just set it down, and we'll stay away from it.
1230120|LMP|Yes. You talked me into it.
1230124|CDR|That was a good idea, but - that's a good straight line.
1230129|LMP|(Singing) We were strolling in the park one day - Well, we've had lots of good ideas in our time.
1230143|CDR|Oh, boy; the thing that makes me sick is losing that fender. I can stand a lot of things, but I sure don't like that.
1230157|LMP|Okay, I get number 4, which - 
1230201|CDR|Where is it? is that the one on the ground?
1230202|LMP|It's probably the one on the ground. Got it? Is that the right one?
1230216|LMP|Well, 3 - No, this is yours.
1230219|CDR|No. Take it; doesn't make any difference.
1230220|LMP|Okay, I'm deploying the - the LMP's deploying reel 3 for your photography purposes.
1230229|CC|Roger. Copy that.
1230230|LMP|Oh, - Hey, push that in.
1230234|CDR|Roger.
1230234|LMP|Ha, ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha. Serves you right.
1230243|LMP|This doesn't push.
1230251|CDR|Okay, I'm ready to stroll.
1230323|LMP|(Humming)
1230328|CDR|I found a brown rock that I'm going to bring back.
1230331|LMP|Please do.
1230334|CDR|I think it's the back side of a piece of glass, but it's brown.
1230339|LMP|Well, I think I'm more or less on your track. It wiggled a little bit.
1230345|CDR|Well, we're - Oh, oh, oh, ooh, stop, Geno.
1230348|CDR|Okay, Jack, wait a minute. That looks orthagonal to me. 
1230402|LMP|Got your picture?
1230404|CDR|Will have in a sec. Wait a minute. Every time I do something, I change the setting. Okay, I got it. I straightened the line out a little bit better after I took the picture - a few kinks in it. Now where's my brown rock? I saw it when I was driving with the Rover. I knew I'd be able to come back here because of the tracks. Looks like an old piece of bread.
1230440|CC|Is that the one that came out of the hatch?
1230443|CDR|What the heck is that? Huh? Oh, it's a piece of - Well, it's a piece of glass, all right - crumbled - part of it crumbled but - I got to get that in a bag. Oh, man, is that a nice piece of glass. Just laying out there all by itself. Jack, well - you got a bag handy while I take my pan. I can't reach a bag; I got this sample in the wrong hand.
1230517|LMP|I don't have a bag.
1230519|CDR|You don't have - well, take one off of mine and give it to me. I'll take it back to the Rover. Wa, wa, wa! Watch it; you've got a wire under your foot.
1230530|LMP|Bag number 460.
1230534|CC|Copy that. 460 has brown glass.
1230535|CDR|I'm halfway out on the north course - -
1230541|CC|Sorry about that.
1230542|CDR|- - I'm halfway out on the north course of the - of the SEP.
1230548|LMP|It's brown vesicular glass. Sort of a yellow-brown, as a matter of fact.
1230601|CDR|Okay, it says - take locator photo to LM. I thought I took a pan here. The LM wasn't - Okay.
1230618|CC|Yes, the locator is really all you need; but a partial pan to show the area would be appreciated.
1230625|CDR|Yes, I'm here. I'm going to get a partial pan, Bob.
1230628|CC|Okay.
1230633|CDR|The only reason I'm doing it is I know it would be appreciated.
1230700|CDR|Okay, take locator to photo LM; I got it. Bob, I'm on - if I can get where I can read it - on about 71 on my frame count; and let me give you - Boy, we got to stay out of this area, Jack. We'll pick up these cables just as sure as the devil. Oh, that fender. Boo - boo.
1230731|LMP|Hey, Houston, will you look at your solar panels?
1230735|CC|Roger. We see some solar panels.
1230740|LMP|You notice how they flop up?
1230744|CC|We noticed that, too.
1230745|LMP|I think we need some gray tape.
1230749|CDR|Okay, 670, 010, 101; that's 670, 010, 101.
1230800|CC|Okay, I got that one, Geno.
1230802|CDR|The wires have memory. Okay, let me - -
1230806|LMP|I need gray tape.
1230807|CDR|Let me put this in your bag, and I'll get the gray tape.
1230809|LMP|Okay.
1230815|CDR|We didn't exactly break any records collecting samples, but at least we got an ALSEP deployed. That gray tape, Jack, is not going to stick on anything with dust.
1230823|LMP|I know; that's what I was thinking.
1230829|CDR|I've just been there with that fender.
1230833|LMP|Well, let's try it. You have a -
1230838|CDR|I don't need the scissors. I can cut it without it. Come on. Once we - Don't back up in that wire - Just like the cover of a - of the -
1230854|LMP|Got it?
1230858|CDR|... that?
1230900|LMP|Yes, I guess. Okay.
1230908|CDR|Get this side?
1230909|LMP|Yes.
1230910|CDR|Keep from falling over. You want to take those polar - solar panels off?
1230914|LMP|Let me hold on to you.
1230915|CDR|Okay, lean on me.
1230919|CDR|If not, let's take them off and hold them.
1230922|LMP|No, I think it's going to be easier this way.
1230924|CDR|Okay, try it. I don't think they're going to be much problem the way they are, anyway.
1230931|LMP|You holding?
1230933|CDR|Yes, go ahead and lean if you want.
1230943|LMP|I don't know how long it will stay.
1230944|CDR|No, I don't know. Okay, there's one.
1230947|LMP|Give me another one.
1230949|CC|It's only going to stay for 2 days, guys.
1230951|CDR|... pull the whole thing over.
1230952|LMP|This will be a - this will be a test. If it holds - holds until we see it again -
1231002|CDR|... Don't knock the whole thing over.
1231008|LMP|Okay, I'm leaning on you.
1231010|CDR|Okay, lean.
1231017|LMP|The piece of tape is so dusty - it may not work.
1231020|CDR|Try it somewhere. Okay, are you happy with the alignment?
1231028|LMP|I was. is the gnomon the zero mark?
1231033|CDR|Gnomon is right up to zero mark.
1231035|LMP|That's where it's supposed to be.
1231037|CC|Beautiful guys.
1231038|CDR|Okay, and the level bubble is just touching the - the inner circle.
1231045|CC|Okay, copy that. And we have the transmitter switch in STANDBY, right?
1231052|CDR|Bob, there's just a couple little bows around the transmitter, is that -
1231056|LMP|It will be, yes.
1231059|CDR|Oh, those are all right - those are okay.
1231102|LMP|Let's forget those.
1231104|CDR|Jack, looking where the LM is, if I were you, I'd just walk down.
1231107|LMP|Come here, Gene.
1231108|CDR|What do you need?
1231108|LMP|I need same support.
1231110|CDR|Yes; boy, that's the key around here.
1231112|LMP|Everything on this SEP is coming off harder than it did in the - when we deployed it at the Cape. See that? it just lifts it. It may not be harder, but it lifts it.
1231127|CDR|Okay.
1231128|LMP|Now, I got to reorient it.
1231130|CDR|Now, let me see. You're STANDBY - now let me look at it - The gnomon's right at zero.
1231134|LMP|Okay, right at zero.
1231136|CDR|It's just the same - it settled back just the same. Zero gnomon and inner circle.
1231141|CC|Okay; beautiful.
1231142|LMP|Let's go.
1231144|CMP|You want to walk back or ride?
1231146|LMP|Let's see -
1231148|CDR|It's up to you but -
1231149|LMP|Oh, I'll walk back.
1231152|CDR|Man, I hate this dust. I got to make a new fender tonight.
1231159|LMP|Well, let's see, I guess I'm supposed to -
1231201|CC|Hey, Gene, I presume that the fender that came off is the fender that came off before, right?
1231208|CDR|Yes, same one. My tape didn't hold; it was too dusty.
1231211|CC|All right.
1231214|CDR|Okay.
1231216|LMP|Hey, watch out for this antenna line I found out here.
1231219|CDR|Yes. Okay, travel to LM, Okay, Bob, I'm not going to change anything right now except get in and travel. All right?
1231232|CC|That's affirm. Time to go home.
1231238|LMP|How's our time, Bob?
1231244|CC|You'll have a nominal closeout, guys, as soon as you get back. We're right about on the time that we've been figuring on for you guys to get back there on. Right now, you are 6 hours and 11 minutes into the EVA.
1231306|LMP|Boy, here's a big boulder.
1231312|CDR|Yes, I discovered something - I learned a lot today, let me tell you.
1231321|CDR|Okay, you're going to lose TV because the high gain is going to be out of whack here in a minute.
1231339|LMP|Okay, I got a football-size rock of this vesicular - coarsely vesicular gabbro, Bob. It's off a large 3 - to 4 meter buried boulder to the north - oh, let's say, northeast of the LM about 30 meters.
1231410|LMP|Do you read, Bob?
1231412|CC|Roger, Jack. Read you loud and clear on that one.
1231418|LMP|Okay. It'll be in the big bag.
1231422|CC|Okay, ...
1231423|LMP|Undocumented, it's about - it's roughly tabular, 15 by 25 centimeters, and about 5 to 7 centimeters thick. One - one face is very flat; looks like it was off of a parting plane, which were in that rock.
1231448|CC|Okay, and if it fits in the SRC with all the other samples, you might put it there because the SRC's going to be kind of empty.
1231455|CDR|Got any new parking angles for your batteries or anything?
1231500|CC|No, it will be a heading of 013, which is hardly a change at all from the 012 in the checklist.
1231510|CDR|Okay, I'll buy that.
1231528|CC|Jack, did you copy my comments about putting that thing in the SRC perhaps?
1231536|LMP|Well, it was pretty big. It's in the big bag now. We can do that.
1231543|CC|Well, I'd get*the other samples - the small ones and particularly soils in the SRC first.
1231551|LMP|Okay.
1231601|CDR|Are you through?
1231602|LMP|No, I'm going right - right about here. Now I'm done.
1231607|CDR|Okay.
1231608|LMP|Right there.
1231611|CDR|Okay, Bob, 086, 0.5, 0.1, 108 - Oh - oh, 102.
1231628|LMP|Stand by 1.
1231629|CDR|Okay, Amp-hours are at 108, 102; volts are 74 and 75 - Batteries are 108 and 123. Motors are all off scale low, all four of them.
1231648|CC|Roger, Gene. Understand 108, 102 on the amp-hours, hub?
1231656|CDR|That's affirm; 108 and 102.
1231659|CC|Okay; copy that.
1231703|CDR|I can't read this thing, because it's full of dust, so I've got to get off and dust it.
1231707|LMP|Okay, the SEP receiver temp is 45, 45 -
1231712|CC|Copy 45. Beautiful.
1231719|LMP|You know, I think they left some Velcro off of this thing, Gene. There's no Velcro holding those flaps down.
1231727|CDR|Isn't there?
1231727|LMP|No.
1231733|CDR|Okay. I've got to get the brush and dust that thing - a minute or 2.
1231742|LMP|Okay, let me get the high gain.
1231803|CDR|I feel like taking some core tubes tomorrow.
1231808|CC|I have a feeling you've got a couple left over, don't you?
1231811|CDR|Bob, you got -
1231813|LMP|Yes.
1231814|CDR|Bob, you got the high gain?
1231815|CC|Okay, thank you.
1231819|CDR|Is that - is that my bag, Jack, you got?
1231821|LMP|Yes.
1231822|CDR|That's pretty good.
1231823|CC|Okay, let's put all the stuff in that bag, Jack -both the stuff that's in yours and the stuff that's in Gene's.
1231833|LMP|Okay. ... Samples - two samples from under the LMP's seat.
1231851|CDR|Put these under the seat. Clean you up here while I'm at it. Oh, man, I tell you, it's going to take us half - a dozen Sundays to dust. Look at that fender; that's terrible.
1231910|LMP|Okay, you want to get my bag off?
1231913|CDR|Yes. If you're ready.
1231914|LMP|Yes.
1231915|LMP|I've got to put your - those samples in the SRC, in your bag; and we'll save this one, I guess.
1231923|CDR|Wait a minute. Let me clean you up.
1231924|LMP|Okay.
1231926|CDR|Did you get me cleaned up?
1231927|LMP|Yes, you've lost your - -
1231929|CDR|Wait a minute.
1231929|LMP|- - your strap though, here.
1231932|CDR|Wait a minute, now, ... Okay, you get my hook back up over here.
1231937|LMP|Okay, - my - turn around. Your hook's up, but I'm not sure I closed your - your other one. Take a look at it. Yes, it's all closed. Okay, you're good. There you go.
1231953|CDR|Okay, you're filling which bag, the -
1231956|LMP|Putting them in the bag that goes into the SRC -
1231958|CDR|That's SRC - SCB 1.
1232001|CC|Roger.
1232002|CDR|Okay; let's see, offload LM - PLSS - core cap dispenser tools. Okay, as soon as you get that, I'll take that SCB 1 from you, and I'll close the SRC 1.
1232017|CC|Okay; and I gather you didn't have any Rover samples today, did you, Jack?
1232020|CDR|I've still got my tongs here. I got - -
1232023|LMP|No, I have one sample bag in my pocket that has a rock in it.
1232028|CC|We'll have to take that out when we get in the Rover, I assume.
1232032|LMP|Okay. Gene, where's that - you want to put that little rock?
1232041|CDR|Yes, is it there?
1232043|LMP|Well, what did you do with it?
1232044|CDR|It was on the floor on my side.
1232045|LMP|Your side?
1232047|CDR|There it is; let me get it.
1232049|LMP|We can put that in one of the core tube slots here.
1232058|CDR|Boy, that one fender just - just is an order of magnitude more of a dust problem. Here can you reach it?
1232107|LMP|Okay, the rock that Gene picked up - early - right at the start, is in a core tube slot in the SRC 1.
1232116|CC|Okay, I copy that.
1232121|LMP|Okay. Gene, you want this one?
1232126|CDR|Yes, I want the full one.
1232128|LMP|Yes. Latched.
1232133|CDR|Okay.
1232136|LMP|Bob, that's almost full of samples, and I think that big rock would be - probably wouldn't fit in there.
1232143|CC|Okay, then we'll put that in the big bag.
1232148|LMP|It's in the big bag.
1232150|CC|Good enough. And I gather there's no Rover samples today, right?
1232154|CDR|Okay - No Rover samples; sorry.
1232234|CDR|Okay, the seal is clear, like I promised I'd make it, coming over the top. Bob, the seal is clear.
1232253|CC|Beautiful.
1232259|CDR|I don't know if it's beautiful, but it's clear.
1232303|CC|It's clearly beautiful.
1232306|CDR|Okay, okay, that big mamou is locked. I got a lot of oxygen. I still got 22 percent.
1232323|LMP|I expect our feedwater may be getting a little low.
1232328|CDR|I'm going to leave this right here until I take it up to you. Okay, close ... verify good seal, place in plus-Z. Okay, LRV circuit breakers: LRV LCRU power OFF. Dust - well, let me get at that dusting first.
1232343|LMP|Give me a yell when you need a spell there.
1232345|CDR|What, dusting?
1232347|LMP|Yes.
1232348|CDR|Well, I need a fender, that's what I need. Figure out something we can make a fender with.
1232355|LMP|How about one of the others that's not as critical?
1232357|CDR|Yes, but I wouldn't ever take one of those off. You know, getting it - I had one to put on and it didn't stay, which is what I figured.
1232404|LMP|I thought you said it was broken, though?
1232405|CDR|Well, it was. But these aren't supposed to come off, either, unless you break them. I broke that one. My hammer got caught underneath it. It wasn't the fender's fault.
1232418|LMP|Okay, the core tube is packed.
1232453|LMP|Every time I read containment bag, it fools me; I can't figure out what it is.
1232459|CDR|Every time what?
1232500|LMP|I read containment bags.
1232503|CDR|(Laughter) You've been thinking of the other kind too long. You've been living in the command module too long.
1232523|CDR|That's a pretty good day's workout, you know. You know, I don't think we need an exercise period. We get back in there. I don't think we have to apologize to anybody. I'm sorry we didn't get out to Station 1. One of the main reasons is, I think, we could have got our navigation bearings a little bit better.
1232543|LMP|Well, I'll tell you. That new ALSEP had more to it than met the eye.
1232552|CDR|This hole out here - you know, this is just such an easy site to find out and to identify yourself on and to land in. But, I tell you, all of a sudden there is so many local holes that I can't think big enough.
1232604|LMP|Does that sound familiar?
1232605|CDR|Okay, Jack, ... rest of my dusting until - -
1232611|LMP|Am I in your way?
1232611|CDR|Yes, I'd like to get over there to get the - this last battery cover. I can. That's good enough. I can get over there now. I want to make sure these things stay clean because I don't want to walk.
1232636|LMP|I agree. Okay, Bob, containment bags and two cameras are stowed in the ETB.
1232650|CC|Copy that. And don't forget the scissors, guys.
1232655|LMP|Don't worry. I've got them right here.
1232657|CC|Beautiful - don't want to go hungry.
1232700|LMP|It's a good call, Bob. That's right.
1232703|CC|And, Jack, give me your consideration - or Gene - on that question of bringing back the big bag into the cabin. The people down here are saying they want to bring it in, and then we'd end up bringing it back out in the second EVA. What do you guys think about that?
1232719|LMP|That's all right; we can do that.
1232720|CDR|Yes, we can do that - I guess just because that rock's in there, huh?
1232723|LMP|I'd like to do that - look at that rock with a hand lens.
1232727|CC|All right; so then we'd be taking it back out in the second EVA, if you guys are agreeable to that.
1232734|LMP|Yes, we'll do that, Bob.
1232736|CC|And, Jack, do you think it'll go in the SCB?
1232743|LMP|Say again.
1232743|CC|Do you think it'll go in the SCB number 2?
1232750|LMP|What would - the bock - the rock?
1232752|CC|Yes, that's right.
1232757|LMP|Well, it'll go in there. It's not that big.
1232759|CC|Okay, why don't you put it in SCB - why don't you put it in SCB 2 and bring that in, instead. Leave SRB out, and then we'll just leave SCB 2 in forever.
1232811|LMP|Okay.
1232814|CDR|Okay, verify SRC plus-Z pad. What are those things going over? What is that, Jack? Hey, something just hit here! What blew? Hey, what is that?
1232828|LMP|Oh, your antenna - your - it's that styrofoam off the high-gain antenna package.
1232837|CDR|On the LM?
1232839|LMP|No, the one you deployed. The Rover high-gain antenna.
1232843|CDR|My gosh, it blew up!
1232845|LMP|Yes.
1232846|CDR|I thought we'd been hit by a - by a - Look at that stuff just keeps flying over the top of our heads. I thought we were the closest witnesses to a lunar meteor impact. I wonder if ... that's the same glass I picked up?
1232905|LMP|Oh, I don't know.
1232906|CC|John says it blew up on his mission too, guys.
1232909|LMP|Isn't that what you thought it was? isn't that what you thought it was? Huh? I thought you were kidding.
1232915|CDR|No, I've never seen that before.
1232917|LMP|Oh, I'm sorry. I thought that was -
1232919|CDR|No - you just - you just - Well, you saw that stuff coming. I didn't see that at all. Holy Smoly!
1232927|CC|Roger, 17. And John says that it blew up on his mission, as well.
1232935|CDR|Okay, Bob, I guess I'm going to take the TV away from you.
1232943|CC|Okay. And, Gene, one thing we'd like before you guys leave the Rov - One thing we'd like before you guys leave the Rover is a farely good description of what happened to the rear fender when it came off. is the damage primarily to the piece that you've lost, or is - or are the rails on the piece that's remaining fairely bad?
1233006|CDR|Okay.
1233011|LMP|Mag - -
1233013|CDR|The - -
1233014|LMP|- - Romeo.
1233018|CDR|Well, a piece of the rail on the - on the aft - aft inboard side here - the rail isn't missing - it's just a piece of the flange - the rail that fits against the fender - but that doesn't hold any part of the fender on. I don't remember what I saw on the fender - The rails look pretty good, Bob. And I had one of them completely on, and I just couldn't get the other one on. If I had known what that dust was, I would have tried an awful lot harder.
1233045|CC|Okay, do you have any feeling that - -
1233047|CDR|I heard John telling me, but - -
1233050|CC|Do you have any feeling that you could get away with putting a front fender on?
1233059|CDR|Well, I have done it before, but it's not easy.
1233105|CC|Okay, as far as you can tell, so that we can look at it over night, the rear fender - the part that's remaining - looks in fairly good shape, right?
1233120|CDR|Let me take a good look at it. Yes, the part you need, I think, to hold that fender on -
1233138|LMP|Let's see - we better take those dustbrushes up there.
1233141|CDR|Yes, there's enough here to hold the fender on, Bob.
1233145|CC|Okay, we'll take a look at it here while you're sleeping.
1233152|CDR|Okay, let me get some breakers here. LRV breakers Alfa, Bravo, Charlie, and Delta.
1233158|LMP|Hey, Bob, while you were talking, I got all the mags - Romeo, Alfa, Bravo, Charlie.
1233207|CC|Hotel.
1233212|LMP|That's on a magazine. That's on a camera.
1233214|CC|Okay. Got you on that one; you're right.
1233219|LMP|Is it not?
1233220|CC|You're right; my fault - you've got the maps, too.
1233223|LMP|Okay, I need those maps, Gene. Could you hand me the maps?
1233228|CDR|I don't know. Pretty good clip, splitting apart a bit, too, aren't they?
1233242|LMP|Getting hot.
1233243|PAO|That'll end the television until EVA 2 tomorrow.
1233247|CDR|This thing keeps falling out of your clip, in case you're interested, or I keep knocking it out.
1233256|LMP|Put it - put it down, yes. Okay, I've got the maps, the 500 mag, yes - and the three - two cameras.
1233306|CC|Okay, we'll have to get the contamination bags, too, there.
1233316|CDR|Huh?
1233318|LMP|Say that again, Bob.
1233319|CC|Roger. We've got the contamination bags to get, too - out of the MESA.
1233326|LMP|I've got them.
1233327|CC|Okay; copy that.
1233328|LMP|Mentioned that earlier.
1233329|CC|Sorry about that.
1233330|LMP|They're in there.
1233333|CC|Okay; and Geno, when you're brushing LCRU, we'd like the blankets left at 100 percent rather than 65 percent - we'd like them all left open; and it's been a little warm, also.
1233348|CDR|Okay, Bob, I've already dusted everything. And it all looks pretty good. The bay - the breakers are OPEN; the LCRU power is OFF. I'm going to - Where do you want the TV camera? Do you want it tilted down and aft?
1233406|CC|Roger. Down and away from the Sun, like we talked about. Think that's what you mean by aft.
1233412|CDR|That's what I thought. Okay. It's down - yes, it's there.
1233418|CC|Okay; can you confirm that that's 100 percent on the LCRU blanket rather than 65 percent as per the checklist?
1233427|CDR|Yes, sir; I sure can.
1233436|CDR|Okay, I'm opening all the battery covers. The batteries are not dirty. I've been dusting the covers every stop.
1233442|CC|Okay; good.
1233445|LMP|Are you through with the - are you through with the SRC?
1233449|CDR|Yes, I just left it there.
1233450|LMP|I've got to get to the table.
1233451|CDR|Okay.
1233457|PAO|Ron Evans in America, began an 8 hour rest period about 10 minutes ago.
1233502|CDR|Okay, the batteries look pretty good. Bob, you got - you got - The left-hand forward reflector on the batteries is about 10 percent in the shade. The others are in the Sun. is that what you want?
1233517|CC|Stand by. Okay; that sounds right, they say.
1233527|CDR|Okay, the LCRU has been dusted; everything is dusted. Our blankets are open 100 percent. ... I'll recheck. Battery covers, open; LCRU blanket is open 100 percent; samples off. You got them all off, Jack?
1233539|LMP|Yes.
1233540|CDR|And anything else? Let me look around. I got to get the TGE.
1233544|LMP|Check it one more time.
1233547|CDR|Samples off; let's look under here. There's nothing under here. This bag is empty. Those are sample bags.
1233556|LMP|Okay, we do not bring up the LM ECS canister. is that correct?
1233602|CC|That's correct, 17.
1233607|LMP|Okay.
1233613|CC|And, Jack, confirm you have the scissors in the ETB. Roger.
1233615|LMP|Just a second. (Laughter) Yes, sir. Thank you, again.
1233624|CDR|Okay, ... the old blanket.
1233630|LMP|Okay, that pin's green; that pin's green. Both pins are green.
1233638|CC|Copy that.
1233641|CDR|Boy, that's dirty.
1233646|LMP|Okay. Okay, I'll take some stuff up. SCB 2, we don't have. Oh, wait a minute. What did we decide to do - -
1233701|CC|SCB 2 for the big rock there, Jack.
1233703|LMP|Put that big rock in the - Oh, okay.
1233710|CDR|How's our time, Bob?
1233713|CC|No problem on time.
1233715|LMP|A little in on those ... Can I sneak in and get a bag?
1233724|CDR|Yes.
1233729|PAO|We're at 6 hours, 36 minutes in this EVA.
1233734|LMP|See you later, Rover.
1233744|CDR|Okay, the SEP blankets are open; it is dusted. Okay, and I verify that the DSEA is OFF, and the power's OFF.
1233801|CC|Copy that, Gene; thank you.
1233806|CDR|Okay, you want the TGE, right side of the MESA, but in the shade. Okay.
1233812|CC|That's affirm.
1233820|CDR|Boy, did it get covered with dust, too.
1233842|CDR|Bob, no trouble with the TGE in the TV, huh?
1233848|CC|None so we can tell. We'll get another reading here when we see it on the ground here.
1233901|CDR|Hey, Jack, if I set this here, we'll - Jack?
1233909|LMP|What?
1233910|CDR|Okay, I just want to set it here so you don't knock it over.
1233913|LMP|What's that?
1233914|CDR|The TGE, right where you left foot is.
1233916|LMP|Oh, well.
1233917|CDR|I'm afraid we'll knock it over if I set it anywhere else.
1233919|LMP|Well, stand by; I've got a lot of stuff here.
1233921|CDR|Okay.
1233925|LMP|You should have volunteered to take the big bag in.
1233928|CDR|Why? You having trouble getting that thing in?
1233930|LMP|Well, it's just ... Yes, I'm having trouble.
1233941|CDR|Well, here; let me help you.
1233941|LMP|Hold this big bag, please.
1233944|CDR|Just don't back up if you can help it.
1233947|LMP|Hold the bag. This big one, this one. No, the other one, the other one; don't.
1233952|CDR|I can't ...
1233954|LMP|I got it. That's a big rock.
1234000|CDR|Want to fit there? it's long ways.
1234002|LMP|Okay, there should be another one in there. is there? Feel it, squeeze it, hit it.
1234008|CDR|... the box, see if there's any in there. ... yes, there is. Okay.
1234017|PAO|America has just gone behind the Moon.
1234020|LMP|Well, let's leave it. ... let's get it out. Here, pick it up. We'll get it out.
1234024|CDR|Hold the top.
1234030|LMP|Shake it. Well, I thought there was one in there.
1234035|CDR|I don't think there's anything in there.
1234036|LMP|I thought I put one in there.
1234038|CDR|Okay.
1234039|LMP|Well, I guess not. If I did, it's gotten out. Okay, got away.
1234044|CDR|Okay, I'm going to leave the TGE right here. I'll put the TGE right side of MESA. Okay, I might give them a gravimeter reading, believe it or not. Boy, I'll tell you, the only thing bad about putting this thing on the ground - it's like everything else - you have to bend over to get at it. And you need support to get back up. Okay.
1234110|CDR|MARK, gravimeter.
1234111|CC|Roger. MARK.
1234113|CDR|And she's flashing, Bob.
1234115|CC|Thank you.
1234123|LMP|Okay, I'm supposed to take this and the core stem bag up there.
1234126|CDR|I'll get it for you.
1234128|LMP|Can you get the core stem bag?
1234129|CDR|Yes, I'll get it for you.
1234208|LMP|Okay, you got a core stem bag?
1234211|CDR|Yes, let me give it one zap with the brush.
1234214|LMP|Okay. I didn't mean to drop that, but I did.
1234223|CDR|Yes, we got to - we got to keep from dropping everything. I'll tell you, the big lesson today - -
1234229|LMP|Dropped.
1234230|CDR|Dropped, I guess.
1234231|LMP|The big lesson is that it's going to get dropped if your hands get tired.
1234233|CDR|Yes.
1234235|LMP|... come down. Got it.
1234246|CDR|Okay. ... me see. Okay, the TGE is reading. We got to stow our antennas and ... dusting down here. I'll make a check of what you've got up there. What have you got up there so far?
1234306|LMP|Just the SRC 2 and the core stems.
1234310|CDR|Okay, SRC 2 and the core stems. Okay - Where's EVA pallet?
1234320|LMP|It's on the MESA table.
1234321|CDR|Okay, that's good; that's ready. Where's ETB? That's ready to go up.
1234325|LMP|Yes.
1234327|CDR|Okay, core stem bag, SRC 2; SRC 1 is in the - SCB 1 is in SRC 1. ... it's there. Big bag is not required. Okay, any more room up there? If not, why don't -
1234342|LMP|No, I think - -
1234344|CDR|Why don't I dust you here.
1234345|LMP|Okay. This rock you landed on here.
1234349|CDR|Watch your foot; you're caught in that thing.
1234350|LMP|Yes.
1234350|CDR|Pick up your right foot. Jack, you're just going to have to get up on that ladder somewhere so I don't - don't get the dust all over this thing.
1234358|LMP|Well, I've got to dust you, too.
1234403|CDR|Well, okay. Go ahead and get me.
1234406|LMP|Yes, where's your brush?
1234407|CDR|Right on the hook.
1234410|LMP|Right; see what I can do. Kick most of it off, I hope.
1234413|CDR|You have to go anywhere else, now?
1234415|LMP|Just right around here; no place but right around here. Man! That's a - that's like a super-endless task.
1234435|CDR|Get the top of that thing if you can.
1234440|LMP|Oop - oop. It landed on a slope.
1234444|CDR|Yes.
1234448|LMP|Okay. That's good.
1234451|CDR|... about the arms?
1234453|LMP|Yes, hold them up and shake them, too, in case there's anything down in them?
1234456|CDR|Let me just - Yes.
1234502|LMP|Let me get lower so you can get at me. Okay, how's that? At best, it is going to be bad but we want to get as much off as we can.
1234522|CDR|How about this one?
1234525|LMP|Guess I can come around on the other side, if you want.
1234527|CDR|Yes, I can hold on better that way.
1234553|LMP|Just take some of it off.
1234554|CDR|Yes.
1234555|LMP|Hold still.
1234557|CDR|I'll get up on that ladder and you get a whack at my legs, best you can. And I'll kick my boots clean.
1234611|LMP|That fender is really going to be a nuisance.
1234617|CDR|... gone.
1234625|LMP|I'm going to have to get you to bend over, too, so I - not now. Know there's a lot on the OPS.
1234636|CDR|I just will stow my antenna, if you're up there. ...
1234645|LMP|Oh, boy. That's really putting the finishing touches on the old arms, isn't it?
1234649|CDR|Yes.
1234703|LMP|How'd you get so dirty?
1234704|CDR|Wait until I show you the picture I took of you.
1234712|LMP|Didn't. Okay, Gene. Most of what's left is up on your - get your antenna. Oh, you're going to go up there, first.
1234725|CDR|You want -
1234727|LMP|Okay.
1234728|CDR|I don't know how you do that.
1234729|LMP|Just - just really spring. You got it. Beautiful.
1234737|CC|Okay, 17, do we copy - -
1234737|LMP|Okay.
1234738|CDR|Better get my legs, then I'll ...
1234739|CC|- - both antennas up?
1234743|CDR|No. No, sir, Bob. I'm still getting dusted. We're trying to go over this thing pretty thoroughly.
1234748|CC|Okay.
1234804|CDR|Pocket is probably full of dirt.
1234806|LMP|That brush does pretty good, though.
1234811|CDR|Want me to move, or anything now?
1234813|LMP|No.
1234814|CDR|Okay. I'm just a mess. Course, when I do this, I get dirtier.
1234822|LMP|Yes.
1234824|CDR|Once I get you this far, I'm just going to shove you on up that ladder and not let you get in the dust. Whoo!
1234857|CDR|Okay?
1234858|LMP|No. You're not okay. You're awful dusty, but I don't know that I can - -
1234905|CDR|Okay.
1234905|LMP|- - do too much more.
1234906|CDR|That looks pretty good. I'll walk -
1234907|LMP|Hit your boots real hard when you come up.
1234909|CDR|Yes.
1234911|CDR|Okay. I've just got to stay on my feet here for a while.
1234917|LMP|Want me to -
1234919|CDR|Stand in - stand in the pad; yes. Stay there and I'll get your back and your PLSS while I'm at it - to start with. Stoop down, if you can. Stand on the bottom of the pad - there you go.
1234935|LMP|How's the old ALSEP, Bob?
1234939|CC|It's looking great, guys.
1234948|CDR|Don't forget, Jack; you'll have to stow my antenna yet.
1234952|LMP|Right.
1234954|LMP|Okay, while I'm up here, let me get the top of your OPS and I'll stow your antenna at the same time.
1235000|CDR|Okay.
1235000|LMP|I - You're going to have to get further down. I can't reach it.
1235004|CDR|That's good. I feel like I'm praying. I guess I am.
1235012|LMP|Now, maybe I can get some dust off you, if you stay there. The antenna will be stowed in half of a jiff.
1235031|LMP|Oh, my fingers. They do not have the dexterity that they once had.
1235053|CDR|Okay.
1235059|LMP|Make sure you don't have anything hanging on you. Wait a minute.
1235107|LMP|Okay. You can stand up. I'll work on your arms.
1235141|LMP|I'll come around that side and get the other one. No, maybe I won't either. Maybe I'll get it - hold onto the ladder some. It'll give me stability, too. Okay, I'll get the backside of your arm from the other side. Let me get to around your waist here now.
1235214|LMP|Getting there - kilter. Ah.
1235228|LMP|Here, let me try your left arm.
1235247|LMP|Okay.
1235248|CDR|Okay?
1235255|CDR|Why don't you go - up the steps.
1235257|CDR|Okay. You're there.
1235306|CDR|Oh, boy. Hallelujah. Yes, do that. That gets a lot off, Jack. Keep doing that. Keep doing that. Boy, that gets it off your shoes.
1235322|LMP|Okay. Okay. Put this foot out here.
1235336|CDR|We're still at it, Bob.
1235341|CC|Yes. It seemed to go a lot faster down there in the clean room at the Cape.
1235348|CDR|Boy, you bet you. And I know why we didn't do it. It was just as tough down there as it is here.
1235350|LMP|Okay?
1235357|CDR|No, not yet. I want to get - the other leg. And then I want you to lean over and get my antenna.
1235413|LMP|Roger. Right. I need to brush off the top, too. I'll stow your antenna first.
1235421|CDR|Okay, babe. That's about all I can do for you. Okay, get my antenna. Oh, I think all the dust I took off you went on me.
1235435|CDR|Can you reach it from there?
1235442|LMP|Well, yes; I think I can. There. Oh, whew.
1235503|LMP|I have 7 hours from the time I looked at my watch. That's got to be pretty close.
1235509|CC|You guys have got 6 hours and 53 minutes and 40 seconds.
1235512|LMP|Okay, Gene, you're stowed. Let me -
1235516|LMP|Okay. Let me see your brush.
1235517|CDR|Okay. Here it is.
1235529|LMP|Okay. That's the best I can do.
1235530|CDR|Okay. Let me get the top of this pocket.
1235535|CDR|Okay. Go on up; stay clean.
1235538|LMP|Well - you've got - let's see -
1235543|CDR|I'll hand you something.
1235544|LMP|You've got to bring stuff up I guess, huh?
1235545|CDR|Yes.
1235547|LMP|Okay, Bob - I need the EVA pallet.
1235549|CDR|Okay, I've give you that and then I'll get to work. I've got some work I've got to do for Bob. Ah. Okay, everything on the EVA pallet?
1235557|LMP|Yes. Just hand it to me and I'll start unstowing it up there.
1235600|CDR|Okay. Man, I forgot I had my visor up. Zowie! See if I can get back in the shade.
1235614|CDR|Got it?
1235615|LMP|Yes.
1235628|CDR|Okay, Bob. I'll try giving you one at a time. LMP's got the EVA pallet. Let me give you a MESA reading, then I'll tidy - or - reading, and I'll tidy the blankets.
1235641|CC|Okay.
1235645|CDR|Okay. The reading is 000, 133, 201, and I can only assume that one of us hit it. I think I've got time to give you another one.
1235659|CC|Okay. Quickly.
1235704|CDR|Well, that's the way it'll be, because it's already punched.
1235707|CDR|MARK it.
1235708|CC|Copy that.
1235713|CDR|Okay, I'm tidying up the MESA blanket. That's pretty tidy.
1235718|LMP|I did that.
1235719|CDR|Okay, MESA blankets are tidied. Okay. Open TGE - I'll do that. Brush to ladder hook. Final transfer, Jack. I'm going to - Okay, I'll tell you what I'm going to do. You've got the - I'm going to - I'm going to inventory here. You got the pallet. ETB is here, and you got the corestem bag. SR - SCB-2 is there; SRC-1 is here; big bag is not required. Bob, I think we got everything. The two things on the surface yet are the ETB and the SRC and me.
1235804|CC|Okay, we copy that. But, of course - -
1235805|CDR|Jack, get down a little bit more, and you've got another 2 or 3 inches.
1235813|LMP|I can't get any lower, Willie, me buttons are in the way.
1235815|CDR|Okay. Keep going. Get your pockets over the sill - There you go. There you are - you're in. Kick off your feet if you can - kick them right there. That's good. That got a lot off. Okay, go on in. You're over to the right - Okay, there you are. You've got all the room you want now.
1235837|LMP|That's not as easy as in the J-bird.
1235839|CDR|Okay. I think I'll give this rockbox a quick dust in here.
1235850|LMP|Your hoses - we've got to have a better way to store your hoses.
1235853|CDR|Yes, I don't like them there either. I saw that when we went out.
1235903|LMP|(Heavy breathing) Whew, boy.
1235909|CDR|You in?
1235910|LMP|Yes.
1235913|CDR|Sounds like it.
1235919|LMP|Oh, come on get up there.
1235921|CDR|Okay, Jack, coming up with the rockbox.
1235924|LMP|I'm not ready.
1235926|CDR|Well, I've got to - I've got to -
1235929|LMP|You ... put it on the porch?
1235931|CDR|Well, I only got one more thing to do and that's taking out there - just clean up the TGE. Okay. I've got to come up there anyway.
1235958|CDR|God speed the crew of Apollo 17.
1240003|LMP|Who signed it? I forgot to read it.
1240007|CDR|I'm not going to tell you, but I like the message. Probably shouldn't tell you.
1240023|CDR|Okay, that ought to stay up there.
1240030|CDR|Okay, I can!t hand you anything in anyway. I'm going down and clean up the TGE.
1240036|CC|Roger. It should be ready to read by now.
1240037|CDR|Oh! That last step down again. Okay? Bob, before - well, let me get this for you.
1240102|CDR|Okay, Bob, 670, 021, 501 - 670, 021, 501.
1240111|CC|Okay. Got that, Gene.
1240112|CDR|And the cover is up. Cover is up, if I can keep it up. If I can keep it up. That'll keep it up. It's been dusted. And I'll get it to STANDBY.
1240138|CC|Okay. Copy that. And did you dust the radiator?
1240143|CDR|Yes sir, I dusted that a little earlier. Okay, it is STANDBY, Bob. Radiator is up.
1240150|CC|And dusted.
1240153|CDR|Cover is open. Okay. I'm going up to the porch. All I've got down here is ETB, and it's on the LEC.
1240203|LMP|I'm ready for you.
1240204|CDR|Have you got anything else?
1240206|CC|Negative.
1240207|LMP|I'm ready for you up here.
1240211|CDR|Let's see what kind of dusting job I can do on myself.
1240239|CDR|Okay, Jack, come up.
1240240|LMP|Okay.
1240246|CDR|Whee! Okay.
1240301|LMP|A little higher. ...
1240306|CDR|I got it.
1240307|LMP|Watch the seal.
1240309|CDR|Okay. Okay, here's an SRC.
1240317|LMP|Okay, put her in here.
1240321|CDR|Oh, me. Well, I'll get it up for you.
1240323|LMP|No. That's all right.
1240326|PAO|Handing the rockbox into the LM.
1240327|CDR|Ah. I think you got the ticket right there. Ah.
1240332|LMP|I'll watch that.
1240334|CDR|No sense making it hard. See if I can't stand this one up. Okay. Okay. There come the core tubes. Boy let's - protect that core tube. Man, that was - that was the turning point today.
1240413|CDR|Got it?
1240413|LMP|Got it. Yes, we had a lot of turning points.
1240420|CDR|Do you want the LEC in there? You don't, do you?
1240424|CC|Negative, you can leave the LEC outside.
1240429|LMP|No, just the bag.
1240431|CDR|Where are the scissors, by the way?
1240432|LMP|They're in the bag.
1240433|CDR|Okay. I hope they don't come out this time.
1240434|LMP|Well, I stuck them down in there. I hope they don't.
1240438|CC|Yes, Jack - -
1240438|LMP|We'll have to figure out something else if they do.
1240439|CC|- - You guys put the tools in the ETB?
1240444|LMP|I think so, Bob. I'll take a peek down there. If they fell out, they'll be right on top. Okay.
1240456|CDR|Mama me.
1240501|CC|Okay, Gene. And you got the SCB number 2 in and the pallet out, right?
1240509|CDR|Right. Here it comes, Jack. Take that. There are no scissors on the ground beneath where the ETB was. So I would say that they're probably in the ETB.
1240547|CC|Well, good enough.
1240548|LMP|Okay. You got everything, now?
1240549|CDR|Yes sir.
1240552|LMP|Okay, let me get out of the way.
1240615|CDR|Okay. Whoops, that's me dusting. Well, I guess I got about - 25, 20, 15 - I guess 13 percent oxygen, 3.8. Okay, babe.
1240640|CC|I copy that. Fifty percent oxygen, Geno - that's
1240641|LMP|Come on in.
1240642|CDR|... comes through that hole. No; 13 - 13 percent, I think.
1240649|CC|One, five [sic].
1240702|LMP|Okay. Put your but - put your buttons down. You're great. Now your head up. You're right against the top, right against the ... 27. Come towards me. Okay, now up.
1240723|CDR|Okay.
1240725|LMP|Tight fit.
1240726|CDR|What am I caught on back there?
1240728|LMP|You're just getting - you're just scraping against your PLSS.
1240731|CDR|Okay. I'll just bend.
1240732|LMP|Watch your - - your - your pockets. Your leg pockets might be part of the problem.
1240736|CDR|Okay.
1240738|LMP|Okay, come on in. Just hug as close as you can. Okay, you're there.
1240758|LMP|Okay?
1240759|CDR|Yes, let me just get on my feet here. Oh - oh - Wait a minute. Got to turn one way or the other. Does this look better?
1240812|LMP|Yes. I'd turn towards your right.
1240815|PAO|We marked Cernan in at 124 hours 8 minutes. Schmitt in at 123 hours 59 minutes.
1240815|CDR|Well, can't do that.
1240820|LMP|Try the other way. Get your PLSS back in there towards the circuit breakers. Move your right - your left arm.
1240826|CDR|(Laughter) Where? Okay.
1240831|LMP|There.
1240833|CDR|Okay. Let me make sure there's nothing in that hatch.
1240835|LMP|Well, there's dust. That's one thing that's in there.
1240837|CDR|Well - Take one quick peek.
1240841|LMP|I can't - From where I stand, all I can see is dust.
1240845|CDR|Okay, it's clear. Did it. Now what do we do next?
1240849|LMP|Pockets - your pockets.
1240855|CDR|Okay.
1240855|LMP|Okay.
1240858|LMP|Primary water, CLOSED. Forward hatch - Turn our WATER OFF.
1240911|CDR|Do you have to turn the PRIMARIES or just the SECONDARY, Bob?
1240913|LMP|Primary.
1240914|CC|Primary only. That's why you don't turn your PRIMARY WATER, OFF, when you go to AUT.
1240925|CDR|Okay. I've got them both OFF. is that all right?
1240927|CC|That's okay, too.
1240931|CDR|Well, wait a minute. Got yours?
1240934|LMP|No, I can't quite reach it.
1240935|CDR|Well, if you can roll to the left, I'll get it for you.
1240937|LMP|Yes, I can.
1240938|CDR|Let me get - let me get back here. I've gotten bigger since I've been out there. You've got to go more. You've got to go more.
1240955|LMP|Yes. There's something keeping me from going more.
1240958|CDR|Okay. Okay, let me see if I can't -
1241009|LMP|... to be awfully far inboard for what I - fitted it.
1241013|CDR|Okay. Your PRIMARY WATER is OFF.
1241017|LMP|Okay. LMP's WATER is OFF.
1241020|CDR|Now you're going to have to move way over there, so I can get the hatch.
1241022|LMP|Yes, I have to go back the way I was.
1241025|CDR|Back up against the circuit breakers.
1241027|LMP|Yes.
1241030|PAO|The EVA clock will continue counting until the LM is repressurized.
1241030|CDR|Can you see what I'm catching on, upward?
1241032|LMP|Yes. You're just hitting the rail over there.
1241035|CDR|Okay. Now.
1241038|PAO|It shows 7 hours and 9 minutes 14 seconds now.
1241042|CDR|... I can't - Close and lock forward hatch, huh?
1241047|LMP|Yes. Can you do it?
1241051|CDR|Yes. Can't see it. Okay.
1241058|CDR|Forward HATCH is CLOSED -
1241101|LMP|Locked?
1241102|CDR|And LOCKED. Which one of those dump valves is - That one up on top. I can get that one.
1241108|LMP|Okay. Take it easy.
1241111|CDR|Oh, whew!
1241113|PAO|Hatch closed at 124:11.
1241125|CDR|It's AUTO, and it's locked.
1241130|LMP|You're sure? is that locked there?
1241132|CDR|Yes, sir.
1241133|LMP|Okay. And it is AUTO. Okay.
1241136|CDR|Okay.
1241137|LMP|Okay, I got a tone and a - and I got an H2O flag.
1241142|CDR|Okay.
1241143|CC|Roger, Jack; we saw it.
1241144|CDR|Okay, PLSS O2 is not less than 10 percent.
1241148|LMP|Yes. Okay.
1241151|CDR|Okay, let's go.
1241153|LMP|If we're not less, go to manual control repress. Okay. I've got to turn -
1241158|CDR|Okay. Let me get out of your way.
1241200|LMP|Okay.
1241201|CDR|About as far as I can go. Okay. I'll read it to you, when you get there.
1241209|LMP|I think part of our problem is - is this - slope. There's no purchase - as my Father used to say - no purchase.
1241219|CDR|Okay, are you ready? Are you ready?
1241222|LMP|Wait a minute.
1241226|CDR|I need you on CABIN REPRESS, AUTO; and then on 16 I need you.
1241230|LMP|Okay.
1241230|CDR|Okay, CABIN REPRESS, AUTO.
1241233|LMP|Going AUTO.
1241235|CDR|Okay. ECS CABIN REPRESS, CLOSED.
1241237|LMP|Okay. Stand by - for repress.
1241240|CDR|I'll try and get cabin ... master.
1241243|LMP|Okay, there's the MASTER ALARM, Heck, I can't get it.
1241250|CDR|I'll catch it.
1241252|LMP|Okay.
1241253|PAO|Cabin pressure coming up, half a pound.
1241256|CDR|Cabin is coming up. ... closed at 1 psi.
1241258|LMP|Okay.
1241301|CDR|Okay. Verify cabin pressure increasing. PRESS REG A and B to CABIN.
1241306|LMP|Now?
1241307|CDR|Now.
1241309|PAO|A pound and a half now.
1241310|LMP|A's CABIN; B's CABIN.
1241311|CDR|Okay, and I want your PLSS O2, OFF - when I give you a call. That's when we get greater than 2.5.
1241323|CDR|Okay, now. We're at 3- Can you get it? If you can't, I'll reach it for you.
1241324|PAO|Two and one half pounds.
1241329|LMP|It's OFF.
1241331|CDR|Okay, CABIN warning light OFF. Verify cabin pressure stable at 4.6 - Okay, it's coming up. It's 3.6. And you use the PURGE valve to depress.
1241345|LMP|What's our pressure?
1241347|CDR|Cabin pressure is 4. Let me just take a look here at 4.6. Okay. I'm coming down. She's coming down. Cabin's up to - Cabin's up to 5, Jack.
1241358|LMP|Okay, it's 5. It shut off.
1241400|CDR|Okay. Okay, I'm about depressed.
1241403|LMP|So am I.
1241404|CDR|Okay. Post-EVA configuration. White dots out and EVA decals. Okay. Checking.
1241413|PAO|EVA clocks show the duration of 7 hours 12 minutes 13 seconds.
1241414|LMP|White dot.
1241418|CDR|Okay. Give me a chance to turn around and look. Okay. White dots are out - out - all the white dots. Okay, they're all out here.
1241421|PAO|It counted until the pressure reached 3-1/2 pounds in the LM.
1241433|LMP|Boy, does this feel good to get soft suits. Oh, my hands. Okay, they're all out here.
1241438|CDR|Okay. Okay, on 16, SUIT FAN number 2, CLOSED.
1241444|LMP|SUIT FAN 2, CLOSED.
1241447|CDR|And SUIT FAN DELTA-P, CLOSED.
1241448|LMP|CLOSED.
1241449|CDR|ECS caution and WATER SEP component lights on [sic].
1241452|LMP|Okay, ECS - I think it's on. It's hard to see it.
1241504|CDR|Okay. Doff your gloves. Stow on comm panel. Hallelujah! Cabin's stable, Houston. How's it look to you?
1241517|CC|Looks good to us, 17. And I'd like you to know you had a 7-hour and 12-minute EVA, from 3.5 to 3.5.
1241530|CDR|Well, until I get out of this suit, I'm still EVA.
1241539|CC|Roger.
1241539|CDR|Oh, doesn't that feel good. Whoo!
1241540|CC|And I think it's a tremendous job for what we might call a "challenging" EVA.
1241551|CDR|Bob, that's no pun. It really was. It really was.
1241556|CC|I know it, men. I know it.
1241603|CDR|I tell you, I really wish you guys could have been here with us. You worked as hard at it as we did, if not harder.
1241613|LMP|Harder, I think. Until today. Oh! You don't have a tub of hot water I can soak my hands in, do you?
1241632|LMP|Wait until that dust hits the sweat of your hands. Oh! I tell you.
1241644|CDR|Man! Okay. My gloves are off. Doff helmets with visors, lower shades, and stow in BRA. Well, I guess the first thing is to get this thing off. Boy, let me tell you.
1241702|CC|Okay. And 17 - or Jack and Gene, I'm going to turn you over to Joe now. I'll be back in a while.
1241712|CDR|Okay, Bob. Thank you for a job well done.
1241716|CC|Well, job well done on your side, guys.
1241731|CDR|Oh, I can't do it. ... - How about getting my glove off?
1241741|LMP|Can you handle it?
1241743|CDR|I'm not sure.
1241746|LMP|Thank you.
1241800|CDR|Jack, the big one's out of the way. What we really had to get out there on. Boy, look at that visor. No wonder I couldn't see.
1241829|CDR|Jack, do you read?
1241830|LMP|Yes.
1241830|CDR|Okay, I thought you knocked your thing to AR - -
1241831|LMP|No.
1241832|CDR|- - or to A or something. There's a lot of noise in the background. That's why I was wondering. Need some help?
1241855|LMP|Stow the visors, huh? What is it?
1241859|CDR|Yes, stow them in the BRA.
1241902|LMP|No, but I mean - Keep the protective visor down.
1241904|CDR|Keep the protective visor over it, and stow the whole thing in the BRA.
1241924|CDR|Verify safety on the dump valve. I guess I can do that now -
1241928|LMP|Again?
1241929|CDR|That one's still safe. And that one's still safe.
1241936|LMP|That was like gunpowder, just like the boys said.
1241939|CDR|Oh, it does, doesn't it?
1241943|CDR|Okay, DESCENT WATER valve, OPEN. Oh, boy. I ran out of water out there. I mean the drinking kind.
1242000|LMP|Okay, what's next?
1242003|CDR|Okay, DESCENT WATER valve, OPEN.
1242010|LMP|Okay. Coming OPEN.
1242015|CDR|Okay, and then you get your purge valve out.
1242018|LMP|Not too hard ...
1242020|CDR|... (Laughter)
1242022|CDR|(Laughter) ... If they say anything, just say, "I told you so." Okay. Remove your purge valve - -
1242031|LMP|(Laughter)
1242032|CDR|- - and disconnect your OPS hose.
1242034|LMP|Yes, sir (laughter). If I can. Okay.
1242042|CDR|I tell you, I haven't seen anything - Drilling those holes was a piece of cake until I couldn't get that core tube out. I thought that whole - -
1242049|LMP|I'm glad there were - -
1242050|CDR|I thought that - -
1242050|LMP|I'm glad there were two of us.
1242051|CDR|I thought that whole thing was going to break. It was bending about - at about (laughter)
1242056|LMP|Well, next time we have to do it -
1242058|CDR|Yes.
1242059|LMP|Let's see, OPS. That must be this one.
1242101|CDR|Disconnect OPS hose. Connect LM hoses - red to red, blue to blue.
1242104|LMP|I don't want LM hoses yet. I'll just get on water right away.
1242106|CDR|Let's put -
1242108|LMP|I'm going to - DIVERTER valve, horizontal.
1242113|CDR|SUIT isOL, both. I'm going SUIT FLOW, get some flow in this cabin. Okay.
1242121|LMP|Here, you want me to get it?
1242124|CDR|I tell you, my hands, after working - at - picking up little things.
1242129|LMP|I feel the same way. I think you had the worst of it.
1242133|CDR|Hey, let's keep as much dust out of those connectors as we can (laughter). Wise guy.
1242138|LMP|Okay. Let's wait on these.
1242142|CDR|Okay, your diverter valve horizontal?
1242146|LMP|Yes. And if we - -
1242148|CDR|Okay, and if you can get to the SUIT FLOW, you can go SUIT FLOW. In the meantime, get your FAN - your PUMP OFF.
1242156|LMP|FAN's OFF. PUMP's OFF.
1242159|CDR|Joe, are you still reading us down there?
1242201|CC|Loud and clear, Gene. We're following you close and - -
1242207|CDR|Okay. I just wanted to see whether you were there.
1242208|CC|Roger. Following you close here.
1242213|LMP|Keep us honest.
1242214|CDR|Okay, we're just looking at 5 psi and all the hatches are battened down, and the safeties are on. You can keep a look at the rest of it for us.
1242222|CC|Copy that. And we're seeing the same thing -
1242224|CDR|Okay, disconnect your PLSS water. Now what I do, Jack, is - I was going to say put your cover on, but we're going to stow those.
1242232|CDR|Okay, guess we've got to go off the air for a little while. We're both going O.
1242238|CC|Okay.
1242238|CDR|And we'll get on our LM comm here, shortly.
1242242|CC|Roger. Check back in.
1242248|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 124 hours, 23 minutes. We've completed a shift handover here in Mission Control. Our flight director Gene Krantz and his team of flight controllers are replacing the Pete Frank team. Our spacecraft communicator on this shift is Astronaut Joe Allen. And aboard Challenger on the Lunar Surface, Jack Schmitt and Gene Cernan, are in the process of getting the Lunar Module reconfigured, ready for their sleep period, which the flight plan calls for them to begin at 128 hours or about 3-1/2 hours from now. After they complete the reconfiguration of the Lunar Module and get the cabin more or less ship shape, they'll have an evening meal, eat period before retiring. And aboard the Command Module, we said good night to Ron Evans on the last revolution, the 18th revolution of the Moon for the CSM, and we're just about to reacquire the Command Module, now on its 19th revolution, presuming that Ron Evans will be asleep. During the EVA, Evans was primarily involved with running the lunar sounder experiment. This was one of the major activities aboard the Command Module. That experiment appeared to be functioning well, obtaining surface and sub-surface data on the lunar stratigraphic sequences and structure. We have a change of shift briefing, which will begin in a little less than 15 minutes in the News Center Briefing Room, Building 1.
1242443|LMP|... Okay, we got to do some more switching, yet.
1242451|CDR|Okay. Connect the - Okay. Now in - AUDIO circuit breakers CLOSED. Now, both panels, VHA - VHF A, RECEIVE; B, OFF. Okay. MODE ICS/PTT.
1242601|CDR|Hello, Houston. Do you read Challenger on LM comm?
1242605|CC|Okay, Challenger. This is Houston. Reading you 5 by.
1242611|CDR|Okay, we're going to go ahead and charge up the - let's see, the LMP's PLSS.
1242626|CC|We copy.
1243256|LMP|Hello, Houston. The recharge on the LMP: 95 percent.
1243301|CC|Copy that.
1243334|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 124 hours 37 minutes. The participants for the Change of Shift Press Briefing are now on their way to the briefing room in Building 1. That conference should begin shortly. Here in Mission Control, Flight Director Gene status - or Gene Kranz rather has gotten a status from his Flight Controllers on both vehicles, both Challenger and America and both spacecraft appear to be in very good shape at this time. Aboard Challenger on the lunar surface, Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt will now be involved in getting out of their space suits, getting the spacecraft cleaned up and ready for their sleep period and we expect to debrief them on the first EVA in about 15 minutes. Ron Evans now into his scheduled rest period. America in the 19th revolution of the Moon at the present time. And, during our change of shift briefing, we'll be recording any conversation with the crew on the lunar surface for playback immediately following that briefing. At 124 hours 38 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
1243938|CDR|Hello, Houston. It's CDR with a recharge of 93 percent.
1243943|CC|Sounds good, Geno.
1244425|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 124 hours 44 minutes. Our post EVA press briefing is ready to begin at this time, so we'll switch to the MSC News Center Briefing Room.
1244818|LMP|Okay, Houston. OPS pressures: LMP, 6100, and CDR, 5900.
1244829|CC|Thank you, Jack.
1245801|CDR|Joe, we're changing a cartridge out in my PLSS. We've got the battery changed.
1245809|CC|Okay, Geno; thank you.
1245814|CDR|You don't have a cold something or other, do you?
1245819|CC|I'm sorry you even mentioned it.
1245824|LMP|We can think about it, can't we?
1245828|CC|Mercy, yes.
1245833|LMP|Hey. Does Captain America know all about this?
1245839|CC|Roger, Jack. He does. He's been fully advised, and his response is - he's sound asleep, now.
1245849|LMP|Yes. I forgot. He was going to bed before we did today.
1245855|LMP|Did he have a good day up there?
1245858|CC|He surely did. Fine day. And I want to make the observation - as a casual bystander. It was a real pleasure to watch your EVA unfold down here.
1245913|CDR|Thank you, Joe. I think you are more than a casual bystander though.
1250723|CDR|Hey, Joe. We've got - 1 and 3 - or correction, l's replacing the 3s and 2's replacing the 4s on the PLSS.
1250734|CC|We copy.
1250937|LMP|Joe, we're in the right-hand column of 3-3 now.
1250942|CC|Roger.
1251000|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 125 hours 10 minutes. Jack Schmitt and Gene Cernan aboard Challenger on the lunar surface have been involved in getting the portable life support systems recharged for tomorrow's EVA. And we're planning to debrief them on the first EVA shortly. They are then scheduled to continue getting the LM cabin configured for sleep and they have some time set aside to eat and we hope to get them into their sleep period at the time called for in the flight plan, which is a littles less than three hours from now. During the change of shift and we accumulated a small amount of taped conversation with the crew. We'll play that back now and continue to stand by live.
1251301|PAO|That completes our tape playback. We'll stand by live now.
1251524|LMP|Joe, bag - collection bag 2 is 16.
1251530|CC|Thank you.
1251551|LMP|And the SRC is 32 pounds.
1251558|CC|Copy; 32 pounds.
1251703|CDR|Okay, Joe. The HEATER is ON for the dump.
1251710|CC|Okay.
1252151|CDR|Okay, Joe, the circuit breakers are verified, about 11 and 16 with exception of the line heater.
1252208|CC|Okay, copy that. Thank you very much.
1252409|LMP|Okay, Houston, we're going to turn the BIOMED, OFF
1252415|CC|Okay.
1252747|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Gene Cernan's report that he was disconnecting his biomedical harness tells us that he and Jack Schmitt are in the process of getting out of their pressure suits, and that puts them about 25 minutes behind the Flight Plan Timeline. However, there is a fair amount of pad built into the Flight Plan during this period of time, up through the eat period and beginning with their sleep period, and we do expect to get them to bed on time. We also, earlier, got a report from them on weights - sample weights in sample collection bag number 2 and also in the sample return container, the rock box that was brought back aboard the lunar module. They reported 16 pounds for the sample collection bag, 32 pounds for the rock box. These are the gross weights, and we'll be coming up with net weights based on the estimated weight of the containers and other equipment. They are usually packing equipment stowed on the rock boxes. As soon as we have a net weight for the samples we'll be passing that along. The next activity scheduled in the Flight Plan is the EVA debriefing and we expect that that will be occuring in the next 30 to 45 minutes.
1254644|LMP|Houston, Challenger. We'll both be off the air briefly here as we swing into getting our suits and LCGs off. The Commander presently has his suit off, and I'll start on mine.
1254644|CC|Roger, Jack.
1255201|PAO|This is Apollo Control. It now appears that the crew aboard Challenger on the lunar surface, Jack Schmitt and Gene Cernan will be ready to begin the EVA debriefing in about 20 minutes. We're estimating that they'll reach that point in the Flight Plan at about 126 hours 10 minutes. And, the debriefing will run 15 to 20 minutes. Ron Evans aboard America has been asleep now for about an hour and a half. We'll be waking him up at the Ground Elapsed Time of 131 hours 20 minutes after about 8 hours of rest. America is presently in an orbit of 69.9 by 53.5 nautical miles, on the backside of the Moon in its 19th revolution, just about to cross over to the 20th revolution the beginning the 20th revolution, and we'll be reacquiring contact with that spacecraft in about 30 minutes.
1260943|CDR|Hello, Joe; you there?
1260949|CC|Waiting patiently.
1260955|CDR|Okay, if you're keeping score on the bottom of 3-4, we're both out of our suits. And does that feel good.
1261003|CC|Roger, Gene. Thank you.
1261008|CDR|Okay, I'm out of icy LCG, if you want to turn the page.
1261012|CC|Okay, Geno, and how are your hands doing?
1261019|CDR|Oh, they're a little tired. On both sides, here.
1261028|CC|Can't imagine -
1261030|CDR|But I think they'll pull through.
1261041|CDR|Do I read this that the - that the LMP sleeps on bio tonight? is that right?
1261053|CC|Stand by. Roger; that's affirm.
1261102|CDR|Okay, so I can take mine off, huh? My sensors?
1261111|CC|That's affirm, Gene.
1261116|CDR|Okay.
1261124|CDR|Well, we'll - we'll be up to the EVA debriefing time here very shortly.
1261132|CC|Roger.
1261153|CDR|Joe, do you know how much time has elapsed since we initially charged our PLSS's with O2?
1261205|CC|Geno, it's time to charge them again, if you want to.
1261213|CDR|Okay, I just might pick that up.
1261217|CC|All righty.
1261224|CDR|We'll let you know where we are, though.
1261227|CC|Okay.
1261348|CDR|Say, Joe, I guess the home front was probably listening in. Any one talk to them?
1261402|CC|Haven't talked to them today, Geno. I haven't at least.
1261410|CDR|Hello, boss, how are you doing down there?
1261412|CC|Just fine. Waiting for you guys to go to sleep so we can do the same. Had a great day up there, guys.
1261421|CDR|Oh, you don't have to wait for that. We're - it was super from here - it's quite an experience, Deke, and quite a challenge.
1261431|CC|Yes, it looked beautiful from here.
1261439|CDR|I tell you it makes you feel - feel like you had a good day's work behind you, though.
1261444|CC|I can believe that.
1261451|CC|We're about to give you the rest of the day off, Gene.
1261459|CDR|Thank you, Joe.
1261525|CC|Geno - While you troop are -
1261528|CDR|Hey, it's 3 o'clock in the - -
1261530|CC|Go ahead.
1261532|CDR|Go ahead, Joe I was just going to say, it's 3 o'clock in the morning back there.
1261537|CC|We know it.
1261540|CC|It's 3 o'clock in the morning up there, too.
1261547|CDR|Yes (chuckle) and we know that too.
1261552|CC|Troops, while you're in a listening mood up there, we're going to be coming at you with a number of items here, not too many, but the first will be some surface block data. Then we're going to read up to you a LEVA cleaning procedure which is fairly simple, a real short geology debrief, a one-line change in the Lunar Surface Checklist. And then, we've been doing some thinking down here about how to fix the fender. And it's going to involve, we think, although we'll work on it while you guys are getting some rest, it's going to involve using utility clamps, from inside your LM there, instead of tape, to fasten some sort of stiff material onto the Rover in place of the missing fender. And we'll go with either with one of your - your cue cards, or possibly with part of insulation that was the flame blanket protecting the Rover during the landing. Or perhaps part of the packing material that was between the Rover wheels, and is probably lying on the ground underneath the LM there.
1261716|CDR|Joe, you couldn't be reading our mind more. We were talking about that, and there is a piece of it right outside my window. I saw it after we got in here. Either that or back of a part of a data book or something - I hate like the devil to tear one of those other fenders off. And the reason tape won't stick is that everything's got a fine coating of dust, and the only way I could finally get it to stick was to put tape on it -rip the tape off - or take the tape off - which took some of the dust off and then tape would tend to hold it. But it just won't hack it up here.
1261748|CC|Roger, Gene. That's exactly what we're thinking. And what we're going to do is run through the fix in a pressure suit a few hours from now. And if it looks like we can do it, and it won't cost you any more than say 10 minutes, we're going to have you go through with it. If it takes longer than that, we're going to go back to the drawing board and see what else we can do here.
1261818|CDR|Well, you know John and Charlie can tell you just had bad it is. I wouldn't have believed it - I guess I didn't believe it, or I would have worked a little harder to make sure that fender was going to stay on. But it - Man, just that short trip back from where we lost it, and we were just covered. The whole - I couldn't even read the parts of the panel on the Rover, plus all the battery covers and everything.
1261846|CC|Roger, Gene. What we really need, I think, is some white mud flaps up there.
1261900|CDR|That's a little too old fashioned, Joe.
1261917|CC|I guess we'd know wouldn't we?
1261926|CDR|I'm afraid so.
1261956|CDR|Okay, Joe.
1261957|CDR|MARK. I'm giving my PLSS a second charge right now.
1262006|CC|We're watching.
1262009|CDR|You ... You should be getting LMP biomed.
1262031|CDR|And Joe, give me a hack after about 10 minutes in case I forget on that PLSS recharge.
1262037|CC|Roger.
1262048|CDR|Can I do both the - I can do both the water recharge and the O2 recharge at the same time, can't I?
1262058|CC|That's affirm.
1262103|CDR|Okay.
1262111|CC|Gene, I caution not to tilt the PLSS while you're doing that.
1262119|CDR|Yes, good idea. Mine's in the station.
1262125|CC|And, Gene, if - if you want to get the geology debrief out of the way anytime, just give us a whistle on that.
1262235|LMP|Joe, why don't you give - give me the block data, and then we can go on that geology brief?
1262245|CC|Okay, are you ready to copy?
1262253|LMP|Go ahead.
1262304|CC|Okay, Jack surface block data; lift-off times, T21, 128 plus 47 plus 12; T22, 130 plus 45 plus 44; T23, 132 plus 44 plus 18; T24, 134 plus 42 plus 50; T25, 136 plus 41 plus 28. Over.
1262400|LMP|Okay, Joey, 21, reading in order 128:47:12; 130:45:44; 132:44:18; 134:42:50; 136:41:28. And what's the present rev?
1262428|CC|Present rev is 20, and readback is correct.
1262530|LMP|Okay, Joe, you can go ahead and fire away at the LMP.
1262537|CC|Okay, Jack, and for the geology questions. I'm going to turn the console over to the well-known geologist of the Seifort Galaxies.
1262549|LMP|Can't hack it, huh? You've all forgotten everything I taught you.
1262555|CC|I draw my sword.
1262557|CC|Okay, guys, you want me to address first those to Gene - those to Jack, and then address them to Gene later on, or you guys both, want to answer them at the same time?
1262609|LMP|Well, we're both listening. We can answer them.
1262612|CC|Okay, the way you asked that, I wasn't sure.
1262614|CC|Okay. Question number 1 is - concerns the Rover mobility rates. The Rover mobility rates over the short span you drove, which is hardly representative, are slower than people had anticipated. Do you think this is due to visibility, terrain, or what? Do you think you can still hack a 7.3 or 8 kilometer minimum or average to Station 2 tomorrow?
1262642|CDR|The answer to that is yes, Bob. I think it's partly - partly fam, but it's also the fact that we did a lot of circling. We didn't drive in many straight lines. Trying to find, for the most part, our bearings, and tried to pick some high spots so we could look around. So I think straight-line navigation out in the area we're going is going to be easily 8 kilometers.
1262707|CC|Okay, great. Okay. Another question here, Gene, that you should be able to answer with a simple yes or no. Was there any spillage of the material in the drill core while you were breaking it down?
1262727|CDR|Simple no.
1262727|CC|Okay. And - -
1262728|CDR|Spillage out of it?
1262729|CC|- - Yes, you know, when you broke the sections, did you lose much material out of it?
1262735|CDR|No, sir; I didn't lose any.
1262737|CC|Okay, next simple question. When you were drilling the deep core where the neutron probe was, could you see the RTG over the rock?
1262750|CDR|Yes.
1262753|CC|Okay. You have any feel for how high the rock is or how low - how deep the thing was with respect to the - with respect to the RTG? Where you down in a level that was below, even without the rocks being there?
1262811|CDR|Yes, I think I - yes. I was in a - in a slump. There was a ridge between us and the RTG, and I had the rock in a line of sight between it and where I put that core. And I'd say the rock was certainly near the ridge and it was - what, Jack? - I don't know was it meter to - meter high for the most part. And it sloped off, and I'd say at least a half a meter high in the line of sight from where the neutron probe is to the - to the RTG. Plus, there's a lot of undulations - I think it'll be below the line of sight, anyway.
1262851|CC|Okay. And a somewhat more general question, here. It says - and I'll read it. We're still puzzled as to whether there is a dark mantle. Could you say something more about the dark regolith surface? There's a lot of discussion, today, about whether or not it could have been a regolith derived from the intermediate gabbro which you were sampling as boulders.
1262920|CDR|Bob, I - I think I don't have too much to add to what I said, near the end of the EVA, is that I do not have an intuitive feeling that the regolith has been derived from most of the boulders that we're seeing. But - because those boulders are fairly light-colored, they look like they're probably 50 percent plagioclase. The - it could be that the regolith is derived from some other material that has blanketed the area. I don't think we have that answer, yet.
1262955|CC|Okay. I copy that.
1262957|CDR|Bob, the boulders - the boulders we are sampling - I think Jack, and I both feel that it's probably - we feel we sampled the subfloor because we saw on the sides of the craters where some of these boulders were exposed almost as if they were bedrock down there. In driving back from what we called Station 1, we - we could definitely see the light mantle out in the area where the potentials of a slide are.
1263026|CC|Okay, very good. Yes, I think that the - At least, it's a going bet around here that we're sampling the subfloor when we're sampling - at least the top of the subfloor when we're sampling the intermediate gabbro there. The rocks and the boulders.
1263040|CC|Okay. We also - -
1263042|CDR|Yes, the -
1263043|CC|Go ahead.
1263045|CDR|Bob.
1263046|CC|Go.
1263048|LMP|It is sort of strange that we don't see a good population of fine - of finer-grained rocks. These rocks look very much like igneous rocks, but they're considerably coarser than comparable -well, they're about the grain size of some of the coarse-grain Mare basalts that tend to differentiate the crystallobalite and tridymite - but we didn't see any of the finer-grain versions. If it's an intermediate crystalline rock, we have not seen any fine-grain equivalents yet. At least not in abundance.
1263132|CC|Okay, I copy that.
1263135|CC|We get - we gather that there's no color change in the dark-mantle material at depth. In other words, the footprints, wheel tracks, and the rake sample, et cetera, were sort of uniform in color.
1263149|LMP|No, there's no major change, but looking out the window and I think I commented on it, the disturbed regolith is darker. Oh, I don't know, maybe by 10 percent albedo, something like that, than the undisturbed surface.
1263214|CC|Okay, I remember your commenting that when you were walking to the ALSEP, I think, Jack, in fact.
1263219|CC|Okay, during drilling of the heat flow holes, Gene - -
1263221|CDR|That's right.
1263221|CC|- - was there change in color of the cuttings as they piled up - as you went down in depth? Do you remember any of that?
1263236|CDR|Yes, Bob, both in the core and the heat flow holes, it really didn't - didn't seem to pile it up like you're accustomed to it at the Cape, and I guess maybe that's because I was kicking so much dust around there. But I looked specifically when I cleared flutes, and what have you, and I didn't see any difference in terms of color, texture, or anything else coming up.
1263303|CC|Okay, copy that.
1263306|CC|On the - outcrops you think you see in the North and South Massifs, do they appear to be linear horizontal, or subhorizontal? Can you see layers, and do you have any feel for the thickness or the attitude or the continuity of them? Can you discuss these outcrops?
1263328|CDR|Bob, the - going over yesterday, I thought I could see a - a structure dipping off to the southeast, apparent dip anyway, on the eastern side of the South Massif. Or northeastern side. We haven't examined them in detail because we were in a rush to get out. We'll put the binoculars on them and try to examine that question. There's nothing very obvious, any more than you can see on the photos, that the ledges were concentrated in the upper portion (cough) - excuse me - in the upper portion of the Massif's units.
1263407|CC|Okay, copy that. Here's a short one that I'll ask Jack since he did it. Again I guess we'll have to prove this - the shade portion of the cosmic ray experiment. The question is, and I repeat - I quote - "Are you sure that the detectors, not the decals, were facing out?
1263432|LMP|I am, Bob, because I said I was sure, and I called you on it.
1263437|CC|Roger. I was sure, too, but I had to ask the question.
1263440|LMP|I - I under - I know. I understand why it was asked, because I did it wrong at the Cape. But that's why - that's why I mentioned it when I deployed it.
1263448|CC|Roger.
1263451|CC|And ready to - Okay, and we can go and recharge the other PLSS whenever you're ready there, guys.
1263510|LMP|Okay.
1263514|CC|Okay, the next question which calls for a little bit of discussion is: The layers of lineaments that you remarked on in the Sculptured Hills, can you say anything about them?
1263533|CDR|Yes, Bob, I did. I think I said - and I commented, I'm not sure whether it was the Sun angle or not, but see, I was not looking at the Sculptured Hills. I was looking back at Bare Mountain, I believe. And, to me it looked like there was some organization that was dipping back to the east, somewhere between, oh, 20 and 25 degrees maybe. And it was very obvious to me but I'm a little - a little hesitant because of some of this Sun-angle stuff.
1263609|CC|Okay, I copy that. I gather we didn't get any 500-millimeters of these lineations, that right?
1263616|CDR|No, but I think we will. I - they were on the western side of Bare Mountain back there, and I think I commented that I thought that Bare Mountain is probably what the Sculptured Hills look like.
1263632|CC|Okay, I copy that. is there a scar above the light mantle material? in other words the slide, is there a scar above that on the South Massif? Can you see anything up there to indicate that it might have come off of there?
1263647|CDR|Nothing obvious yet, Bob.
1263652|CC|Okay, copy that. On the way back from Station 1, you described a small crater with light material on the bottom. Can you say anything more about that crater?
1263713|LMP|Bob, I don't remember saying that, or Gene doesn't either.
1263719|CC|Okay. You talked about something that was light I don't remember - I thought it was a boulder, but the question's about a crater.
1263728|LMP|You're right. You're right, there was a large zap pit in a boulder that was very white. It must have been - the crater for the zap must have been 2 centimeters diameter anyway. And it had about that, or maybe 3-centimeters worth of crushed minerals around it, that gave it a white, very bright white appearance.
1263751|CC|Okay. Well that was indeed a small crater, so I guess the question was right.
1263801|CC|Let me change the mode here and ask you three or four simple ALSEP questions again, to verify for various people, exactly what happened. Just to make sure that they're clear on it. When - Jack, when, you were laying out the geophone leads, you mentioned and asked me if it was all right if the geophone leads crossed one another, if there was EMI problems. And so that made people wonder whether or not it was possible the geophone positions were reversed; i.e., geophone 1 was laid out in geophone 2's direction, et cetera.
1263839|LMP|No, that was just a geophone 4 problem. The geophones are in the right directions.
1263845|CC|Okay.
1263845|LMP|Geophone 4 fell out of the module and rolled under one of the other lines, or vice versa, I don't know which, and it was - it's crossing one of the other lines, geophone 1, I think.
1263859|CC|Okay, no problem. Was the - When you went to put the LSPE antenna in the heat-flow socket, you didn't have - weren't able to do it at first, was it because of there was a lot of dust in there?
1263916|LMP|No, I think it was the same old problem of that piece of - of aluminum foil, or whatever it is, going down in the socket and jamming briefly.
1263927|CC|Okay, I copy that. Did you clear out that foil when you did it, or did you Just push it on through?
1263935|LMP|I forced it.
1263936|CC|Okay. When you taped the SEP solar cells down, did you - how much of them did you cover with tape?
1263947|LMP|We taped the back.
1263949|CC|Ah, very good thinking. And, Geno, a question for you on the Rover when you parked it. Do you have any feeling for the roll angle it was parked at the LM? The roll angle?
1264009|CDR|Here let me look. Bob, it's pretty flat. If I had to guess, I'd say zero. And you can bias that by a degree or so, but basically zero.
1264022|CC|Okay, is the pitch scale still on it, or did it fall off yet?
1264028|CDR|No. I was going to comment on that. It's still there.
1264033|CC|Okay, very good. Okay, when you went to Station 1A, we're calling the new Station 1, Station 1A, were the blocks there as well-filleted as those near the LM and the ALSEP? Do they all look the same?
1264054|CDR|Bob, they - All the boulders had filleting to a slight degree, but not an extreme amount. I think it no more than what is being caused by the redistribution of the darker, fine-grained regolith.
1264118|CC|Okay, I copy that.
1264121|LMP|Bob, if had to answer - -
1264123|CC|Go ahead.
1264124|LMP|- - if I had to answer that question, I'd say yes. Yes that the fillet - boulders are filleted over there about like they are over here. That would be my impression.
1264135|CC|All right. is there any indication that the fillets are directional, in other words, that the fillets sire heavier on one side than the other?
1264147|CDR|Bob, haven't noticed that.
1264151|CC|Okay, I copy that. Do you have the feeling that some boulders are more rounded -
1264155|CDR|Well that's a good - that's a good -
1264159|CC|Roger. I agree with that.
1264202|CDR|That's a good re - that's a good reminder, Bob.
1264208|CC|Okay, do have any feeling that some boulders are more rounded than others? Apparently this looked this way in some of the TV pictures.
1264218|CDR|Some of the big ones that are just barely exposed above the regolith looked quite well-rounded. Most of those around the craters are sub-angular. I think - I got the impression that it's just purely a function of how long the same material's been exposed; but some of the big boulders, like the one out near the geophones, is quite angular in part and quite rounded on other parts. It's quite variable.
1264249|CC|Okay, do you want to say any more about that boulder? Did it seem to have more or less the same morphology, in addition to the variation in vesicle size that the other rocks in the vicinity of the ALSEP, and the other rocks out at Station 1 had?
1264308|LMP|It's very comparable to the ones that we saw at Station 1, as a matter of fact.
1264313|CC|Okay, I copy that.
1264314|CDR|Both types of rocks were there, both variations.
1264324|CC|Do you have a feeling for where the big blocks in the LM ALSEP area came from? Do you think they were from Camelot, like I've been saying?
1264336|LMP|Don't have an idea yet - I'm really not sure.
1264342|CC|Okay, and as you drove along on the traverse from the SEP to Station 1, did the size of the small craters with blocky rims vary? in other words, what we are looking for here is the variation in the thickness of the dark mantle?
1264358|LMP|I can't answer that one yet, Bob.
1264400|CC|Okay. Let me sum up by saying, that I guess as I indicated before, our best guess is that the vesicular crystalline rock, probably gabbro, or I think you've been calling it intermediate basalt or gabbro, forms at least the upper part of the subfloor. I don't think we've been close enough to a large crater rim to say that it's a - what the deep sections of the subfloor form, but we think that this intermediate gabbro vesicular rock, at least medium-grained, perhaps coarsegrained rock, forms at least the upper layer of the subfloor. Over.
1264448|LMP|Yes, Bob, I think that's pretty safe, right now. Once again, I'm surprised that it's as coarse as it is, that being the upper portion of a plains unit.
1264500|CC|Roger.
1264501|CDR|Say, Bob, driving back from Station 1, driving back from Station 1, where we did some of our circling and what have you. We didn't have time to get off, but we did see down in - I don't remember whether it was in the slopes of some craters, or down on the slope itself, but I'd say several meters down below the mantle where there was what we almost agreed to, might be bedrock at least, a deeper portion of the subfloor.
1264536|CC|Okay, well, I think we'll get to it tomorrow. I think I might just give you a clue to our thinking for tomorrow. But, I don't think we've seen, or done anything today that is going to make us change very much from the nominal station of - nominal EVA-2 plans. The fact we didn't get the station -to the EVA-1 at the large boulders at Emory is probably going to mean that Station 5 might be shifted a little bit to the boulders on Camelot. But certainly Station 5 on the subfloor and also to Station 10 have assumed a higher priority than they originally had. Other than that I, don't think we'll see an awful lot of changes to EVA-2. Over.
1264623|LMP|Okay, Bob. I think that's safe. I suppose somebody's thinking about the possibility of going down to Emory. Maybe you just said that. Going down to Emory late in EVA-3.
1264636|CC|I think at the moment they're thinking primarily they're going to Station 10, and not going to Station 1.
1264700|CC|Okay, Jack, I've wrested control -
1264702|LMP|Some of your experts might - -
1264703|CC|Go ahead.
1264708|LMP|- - some of your experts might think about what they might expect to happen to put the regolith on a bigrain pyroclastic would look like.
1264723|CC|Okay.
1264724|CC|We'll tell them. I'll see you tomorrow, guys.
1264729|LMP|Sleep well, Bob.
1264730|CDR|Okay, I've just got one question, Bob, before you run off. Did the TGA perform okay, with the - with the camera on?
1264740|CC|As far as I could tell, Geno, it did, matter of fact, I didn't see the Gravimeter people afterwards to talk to them. But as far as I could tell, it did. We had one funny reading back at the LM very early when it was on the ground, which I'm at a loss to understand right off. But, other than that everything seems to have gone very well. The readings were quite uniform, in fact, which is what makes you think they went well.
1264805|CDR|Okay, well, I'd like to leave it - You know it's a little change in my thinking - I'd like to leave it on the Rover if we can, although it's a piece of cake to take off. It's very difficult to lean over that bar without losing your balance and take your - your readings and what have you. So if we can leave it on it would be far better.
1264822|CC|Roger. I was noticing that. And I also noticed the only three - three-ball reading we got was whsn it was on the ground.
1264832|CDR|Yes.
1264838|CC|Gene and Jack, if you'll get Lunar Surface Checklist 3-5, I've got an easy change to read up to you.
1264857|CDR|Go ahead.
1264901|CC|Okay. After the line: "Empty ETB As Follows," change the first line which reads, B&W Mag Golf in Forward RHSSC to read, B&W Mag Hotel in LCG Compartment. And then go into the next column, which begins, "Stow in ETB." Change the second line, which reads: LMP's Camera With B&W Mag Hotel to LMP's Camera With B&W Mag Golf. That's Mag G, ETB. Over.
1264959|CDR|Got you. Hotel, stow it; and go out with Golf.
1265006|CC|That's got it. And I've got a LEVA-cleaning procedure which maybe you could pencil in there. It's an easy three-step procedure. And I'll go ahead and read it step-by-step here. Step number 1 is tap LEVA base to remove loose dust. Step number 2 reads: If excess dust still remains, use a towel from the LM tissue dispenser, which has been wetted with water, and gently wipe the visor from the top to the bottom; that is, in one direction. And fold this towel after each wipe to keep the contact surface clean. There's a note. "Take care not to wet the inside that is, the concave surface of the gold visor." And the last step is: Allow it to air-dry. And that's it on the LEVA cleaning.
1265122|CDR|Okay, Joe, we got that. The Commander's PLSS has had its final charge, and we're in the process of working on the LMPs PLSS now. I guess there's no way to verify how much water you've got in there except to go through the procedure.
1265145|CC|That's right, Geno. And we think you fellows have earned a good meal now, and maybe you can take the rest of the day off.
1265201|CDR|Okay, Joe. Thank you.
1265237|PAO|The CAPCOM during the EVA Geology debriefing was Astronaut Bob Parker, who was CAPCOM during the EVA. Joe Allen is now handling the CAPCOM duties once again.
1265412|PAO|Ron Evans, aboard America, now in his 20th revolution of the Moon, just passed over the landing site a few minutes ago, and appears to be sleeping soundly. Ron has been asleep for about 3 hours now. And telemetry data on America shows the vehicle to be functioning normally, as are all of the scientific instruments with a couple of relatively minor exceptions, the mapping camera has not been retracted, it is somewhat slow to retract the last few times that that maneuver was performed and the camera has been left in the extended position, which is the normal operating position for the mapping camera. And we expect, as you heard CAPCOM Joe Allen advise the crew, that Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt will begin eating shortly, and we hope to get them tucked in for bed by about 128:00 hours or about 1 hour from now.
1265736|LMP|Okay, Joe. Just to bring you up to date on magazines. Mag Bravo has 77 frames.
1265748|CC|Okay.
1265756|LMP|Mag Hotel has 83 frames.
1265803|CC|Roger.
1265912|CC|Jack, on your mag Hotel, we'd showed you all the way up to 183 at one time, on that. Did you miss the 1, this time?
1265932|LMP|I may have clipped it out, Joe. 183, yes.
1265935|CC|Okay, yes, you did clip it out, clipped it out cleanly. So thanks for verifying that.
1270229|LMP|Joe, mag Romeo has 21 frames. And I took a few, random, and probably not very good 500-millimeter of the North and South Massifs - North and South Massifs.
1270248|CC|Okay, Jack, Thank you.
1270302|LMP|And, Joe, verify that you want mag Charlie substituted for Mag Bravo on the CDRs camera.
1270317|CC|Stand by.
1270444|LMP|Don't get me wrong. I think it's a good idea, Joe. Don't let everybody work all night on that one.
1270454|CC|Jack, I think the answer to that is yes. Per the checklist, by the way. That's the way we show it in our checklist here.
1270505|LMP|Roger. We just have - probably have a - about 100 frames left on Bravo, so we'll just keep track of that.
1270512|CC|Jack, it'll go out later on - Bravo will - it's - apparently, it's kind of your backup magazine there.
1270531|LMP|Okay.
1270537|CC|The reason being, we want to start that EVA-2 with a fresh mag.
1271045|LMP|Hey, Joe. Bob told us earlier, the sounder looked like it was working.
1271113|CC|Gene and Jack, just a general comment on that. SIM bay's cooking along beautifully. We are getting lunar sounder data. It looks quite interesting. We've only got one or two annoying problems with it, nothing major, that is with the SIM bay, not with the sounder. One of them being that we have our usual mapping camera extend problem. And we've just decided to leave it extended and it will serve it right if it gets a little contaminated with an occasional dump. And, I guess there's a minor problem with one of the big antennas. It didn't pass its retract check properly, so I guess it may have to be jettisoned when we do a plane change. Otherwise, things are working beautifully. Over.
1271206|LMP|That sounds great, I'm glad to hear that.
1273310|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 127 hours 33 minutes. The CSM America has just gone behind the Moon now on the 20th revolution. The spacecraft looking very good. When last we had telemetry data on it. And, Ron Evans continuing to sleep soundly. He's been asleep now for about 3-1/2 hours. On the lunar surface, Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt aboard Challenger are eating at this time, and we hope to get them to bed by about 128 hours or about 27 minutes from now.
1274300|LMP|Houston, Challenger.
1274306|CC|Go ahead.
1274312|LMP|We're sort of around 27:30 in the checklist, more or less, and you want the POWER AMP and TM to high?
1274335|CC|Ready when you are. And, troops, are you raiding the pantry up there yet?
1274354|LMP|Yes sir. We've been hitting it as hard as we can. Okay, POWER AMP is going to PRIMARY and PCM to HIGH. And, while we're waiting for Gene to look at this computer, shall I do the battery management?
1274431|CC|Jack, stand by, until we get the high bit rate, on that battery management. And, a reminder, are you recharging that PLSS number 2 there, or have you taken that off the line?
1274447|LMP|No, we're - we're through with that. We caught it with 10 minutes.
1274457|CC|Okay. We've got high bit rate now. Go ahead with battery management.
1274509|LMP|Okay, we'll play it - Gene'll work the computer, and I'll work the batteries. And the ED volts are 37.2, both batteries.
1274521|CC|Thank you.
1274557|LMP|Okay, you got P00 and DATA, Joe.
1274608|CC|Thank you.
1274739|LMP|Okay, Joe, the battery management complete. How does the rest of the spacecraft look, what you can see of it?
1274756|CC|Okay, Jackie. Copy the battery management complete, and the Challenger's looking beautiful from down here.
1274810|LMP|I guess you don't have telemetry on dust yet, huh?
1274819|CC|Negative on the dust. And the computer's yours. Sounds like you've got hay fever sensors, as far as that dust goes.
1274833|LMP|It's come on pretty fast just since I came back. I think as soon as the cabin filters most of this out that is in the air, I'll be all right. But I didn't know I had lunar dust hay fever.
1274852|CC|It's funny they don't check for that. Maybe that's the trouble with the cheap noses, Jack.
1274904|LMP|Could be. I don't know why we couldn't have gone and smelled some dust in the LRL just to find out.
1274911|CC|Goodness knows we've tried.
1274934|LMP|Okay, I'll wait for your cue on the rest of it.
1274947|CC|Okay, Jack. TELEMETRY PCM - LO, and your POWER AMP - OFF, please.
1274958|LMP|Roger.
1275044|CC|Challenger, this is Houston requesting DOWNVOICE BACKUP, and then configure your ECS for sleep at your convenience.
1275056|LMP|Okay, we're working in that direction. DOWNVOICE BACKUP, now.
1275104|CC|Okay, Jack and Gene. And, unless you've got questions, or we can help you out in some way, we'll say good night to you.
1275117|CDR|Good morning.
1275131|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 127 hours 51 minutes. Cernan and Schmitt are now completing the items in their presleep checklist.
1275143|CDR|The reason I say that, Joe, it's going to be another 30 minutes or so anyway before we - probably more like an hour before we actually close our eyes.
1275204|CC|Roger, Gene. You think you'll be able to use about 30 more minutes of sleep tomorrow morning? What's your wish on that?
1275216|CDR|Yes, I'd like to try to get the full amount. As I recall, tomorrow's a little bit flexible. If we get up 30 minutes late, it doesn't really hurt us.
1275228|CC|Sounds like a good way to proceed. We'll give you the full 8 hours. Good night, Geno. And, you do have a time pad in there, so it shouldn't hurt a thing.
1275242|CDR|Yes, as long - the big object tomorrow is to get out, and get back in, and the same thing with the next day. I don't think we're really that time critical either day that we can't go an hour either way. And I think we'd prefer to have the full 8 tonight.
1275259|CC|Roger. We couldn't agree with you more. And if there's anyway we can be helping you now, just speak up.
1275311|CDR|No, you've been doing - doing fine. We just got a little housecleaning we got to do that's going to take us - I expect we'll be an hour late, Joe.
1275754|PAO|This is Apollo control at 127 hours 58 minutes. And the crew aboard Challenger on the lunar surface are now getting configured to begin their sleep period. Among the things in the checklist that they have done is to turn off the power amplifier which accounts for the somewhat noisier communications that we're getting. This is a normal presleep configuration and we don't expect to be communicating with the crew a great deal in the next hour and of course, none while they're in their sleep period. As you heard in the last exchange between CAPCOM Joe Allen and Gene Cernan, the crew will probably be getting the sleep period about one hour later than the flight plan calls for. At around 129 hours rather than the nominal flight plan time of 128 hours. We plan to allow them the full 8 hours for their rest period which means that they will be waking up just prior to 137 hours about 136 hours 55 minutes will be the wakeup time. And this would also slip the start of EVA-2 by about one hour giving us a start time for EVA-2 of 140 hours 10 minutes or about 5:03 p.m. central standard time. There is a one and a half hour pad following EVA-2 and EVA-3. This is identified in the flight plan as MCC conference and amounts to one and a half hours that can be used to make up loss time after the second EVA and third EVA. We would expect to make up the lost hour after the first EVA; however, if we are again running somewhat late after the second EVA rather and if we are running somewhat late after the second EVA we still have the hour and a half pad after the third EVA and would of course expect to be back on the nominal flight plan in time for an on time liftoff from the lunar surface. But, again, based on the one hour late beginning of the sleep time and our plans to give the crew a full eight hours of sleep. We would expect the EVA-2 to begin one hour late. At 140 hours 10 minutes or about 5:03 p.m. central standard time. We'll continue to leave the communication circuit, PAO release Line up live until it appears Cernan and Schmitt have begun their sleep period - have actually gone to sleep. We'll be reacquiring the command module in about 21 minutes. That vehicle now on it's 21st revolution around the Moon. And Ron Evans now about four hours into his scheduled eight hour sleep period. At 128 hours 2 minutes, this is Apollo control, Houston.
1280201|LMP|Hey, Joe.
1280205|CC|Go ahead.
1280209|LMP|Some ambiguity in your statement. You want us to use a tissue or a towel on that visor cleaning?
1280223|CC|Jack, they call it - they call it a towel, but it comes from the LM tissue dispenser, so I would interpret that to mean tissue.
1280241|LMP|Well, you and I are thinking alike. But can you ask back there and find out?
1280253|CC|Asking right now.
1280350|CC|Jack, our guess was right on the cleaning of the visors there. We're to use a tissue from the LM tissue dispenser. And I've got an unrelated question for you. We're tracing water usage down here. Could you tell us, please, if you filled your drink dispensers - refilled the drink dispensers in the suit already? Over.
1280420|LMP|That's affirm. We have.
1280442|CC|Okay. Thank you.
1280453|LMP|We have been drinking quite a bit of water, Joe.
1280502|CC|Okay. Thank you.
1280752|LMP|Houston; Challenger. How do you read?
1280758|CC|You're loud and clear. Go ahead.
1280806|LMP|Joe, I just took a - quick look with the hand lens at that large rock I brought in, and I'll - I don't think there's much more than 30 percent plagioclase. I'll go back - could be more of a standard basalt or gabbro. It has a fair proportion of ilmenite in it, I believe. There are some bright platelets - in the vugs or vesicles - of ilmenite. Now it could be that it's a glass - if the soil is very glassy, that it's developed the darker color from the contribution of the - of the basic minerals through the glass, particularly the iron and the titanium.
1280901|CC|Roger, Jack. Copy that. Sounds interesting.
1280910|LMP|All it means is that we don't yet know the origin of the dark mantle.
1280920|CC|Roger.
1280930|LMP|That rock - looks I may have, by accident, sampled the front side of one of the parting planes that I mentioned. Very, very sharply bounded on one side by a planar surface.
1280956|CC|Roger, Jack. Say again. You may have sampled by accident the side - the side of what?
1281012|LMP|No, I didn't. I mentioned when I sampled it, it had one very planar surface, and looking at it more closely, it looks like one of those parting planes that I talked about even earlier in the EVA.
1281024|CC|Roger. Copy. Parting planes, thank you.
1281031|LMP|It's like a parting shot.
1281040|CC|Of which you've been known to have an overabundance, by the way.
1281050|LMP|Oh, I didn't know that.
1281056|CC|All us fast finishers do.
1281105|LMP|That's right. You got to figure out what race you're in though, first, Joe.
1281115|CC|I'm sure that Sherlock Holmes would have a suitable quotation to answer that, Jack. I just can't come up with it right now. Something like "therein, Watson, lies the problem" - -
1281128|LMP|That, in itself, is a singular event.
1281152|LMP|But the dog did nothing in the nighttime, Joe.
1281206|CC|And when you've examined all possibilities and eliminated all but the very improbable ones, then the improbable one must mean the truth.
1281223|LMP|I told you, he was a good geologist, one of the experts on the soils of London. Not to mention their relationship to all kinds and brands of tobacco.
1281307|CC|Jack, maybe we better get off onto another vein. Surgeon's giving me a puzzled look over here. We may be getting in trouble.
1281320|LMP|You want to talk about veins - now that's something an old ore geologist could talk about all night.
1281336|CC|Ore geologists and cardiologists alike.
1281351|LMP|Thou strikest for the jugular.
1281403|CC|Jack, we running a contest down here to come up with a reply to that. We're getting a request, many requests, for a weather report. We've been missing your weather reports and wonder what the weather is on the Moon right now.
1281425|LMP|Well, the Moon's weather is clear and sunny. It's only scattered clouds, and all of those seem to be attached to the Earth.
1281445|CC|Except for a cloud of dust around the right rear wheel of the Rover, we've noticed.
1281456|LMP|Yes, but dissipates in the morning warmth. Believe it or not, Joe, I'm going to be off the air briefly.
1281518|CC|So far, I don't believe that.
1281525|LMP|Well, if you don't get any heart beat for a little while, don't worry.
1281537|CC|Okay.
1285410|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 128 hours 54 minutes. Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt aboard Challenger on the lunar surface have turned off the voice subcarrier, we don't expect to hear from them any further. However, we do not believe at this time that they have begun their sleep period. Cernan reported about an hour ago that it didn't look as if would actually begin their sleep period until about 129 hours. So we expect that they are probably very close to beginning and will actually get to sleep within the next 10 or 15 minutes. Ron Evans aboard the Command Module crossed over the landing site some 10 or 15 minutes ago. America is now in it's 21st revolution of the Moon. And Evans has been sleeping soundly for nearly 5 hours. we do plan to let Cernan and Schmitt sleep a full 8 hours which means that they will be getting up about an hour later than the flight plan time which will also slip the start of EVA 2 by about 1 hour. Because of the noise on the air-to-ground line, with the lunar module operating with it's power amplifier OFF, which is the normal configuration for sleep period, we are going to take the relief line down. We'll record any conversations we get with the crew. Also, we would have a pretty good chance of getting the lines up in the event they plan to give us a call because we'll see the voice subcarrier come on first. But in any event either live or play-back we'll come up very shortly after any conversations with Challenger on the lunar surface or America in orbit around the Moon. At 128 hours and 56 minutes this is Apollo Control Houston.
1293000|PAO|This is Apollo Control with 129 hours 30 minutes. About 28 minutes we had one brief transmission from Challenger on the lunar surface. Gene Cernan called to say that he and Jack Schmitt were beginning their sleep period and would see us in the morning which will be at a Ground Elapsed Time of 136 hours 55 minutes. We plan to give them the full 8 hour sleep period called for in the flight plan. Also, Ron Evans, continuing to sleep soundly aboard the orbiting command service module America, completing it's 21st revolution of the Moon. And we're about to lose radio contact with the command module as it goes behind the Moon on that revolution. Both vehicles continuing to perform normally and good solid data from both the command and service module and the lunar module. Wakeup time for Evans aboard America is 131 hours 20 minutes. 31 minutes, this is Apollo Control Houston and we'll replay that very brief segment of tape from the lunar module Challenger.
1311000|LMP|Joe, we're asleep. There's no need to answer. See you in the morning.
1311000|PAO|And that was the full extent of the communications from Challenger. we do not expect to hear from them until 136 hours 55 minutes at which time we will be sending a wakeup call to them if they don't call us first. This is Mission Control Houston.
1311532|CMP|Roberta?
1311532|CC|Hey there, Ron. I heard some signs of life there.
1311532|CMP|Let's see. I - got ngr DUPLEX, OFF, there so I won't talk to those guys on the surface.
1311532|CC|TOiat's a good idea. We don't want to wake them up.
1311532|CMP|(Laughter)
1311532|CC|Ron, we're going to be going LOS here in about 3 minutes. Just wanted to get you up. We're letting the LMies sleep over - sleep in an extra hour this morning. Over.
1311532|CMP|Oh, okay. I'll get my Flight Plan out here and see what I'm supposed to be doing. Probably just eating though, I think isn't it?
1311532|CC|That's right. Get up, turn the VHF A, OFF, change your canister, and have breakfast.
1312549|CMP|Okay. Sounds good. That's what we'll do then.
1312549||BEGIN LUNAR REV 23
1322305|CC|Hello there, America. How's breakfast this morning?
1322305|CMP|Scrambled eggs and bacon. Not bad at all.
1322305|CC|Sounds better than what I had.
1322305|CMP|It's really not bad. Cocoa and orange juice along with it. Even have four toasted bread cubes.
1322305|CC|Very good.
1322305|CMP|Hey, Gordo. Do you have any sort of - some kind of a ground truth wrap-up of the first EVA as far as the type of material they ran across down there and things like that?
1322305|CC|Ron, I kind of personally - on and off. Let me work on a good summary, and I'll come back to you on that.
1322305|CMP|Okay. Nothing elaborate but just - you know -
1322305|CC|Okay. Talking about the America though, your consumables - You're 3.8 percent high on RCS quantity. On the O2, well - all the points of the three tanks have fallen between the - the two sets of lines on your graph with a total result as on 02 you're about 10 pounds below the average quantity expected. However, your trend is paralleling the lines and that's of absolutely no concern. On hydrogen, by best guess is you're probably a little bit high, total. Your Tank 1 is right on the line; Tank 2 is - oh, about 6 or 7 percent high; and Tank 3 is about 4 percent high, so you're fat on hydrogen. Over.
1322305|CMP|That doesn't sound too bad then, does it?
1322305|CC|No. It sounds great.
1322545|CMP|Sounds good, I think.
1322856|CMP|Houston, America. I can give you the old CMP's medical log, if you want to do it.
1322856|CC|Okay, Ron. Go ahead.
1322856|CMP|Okay. PRD is - You didn't cut out on me (laughter). My orange juice is leaking. Okay. PRD is 15038. Had about 6 hours of good sleep. Took me about an hour to get things squared away last night. Then I woke up early this morning. Didn't take any medication. And I had four cans of fluid.
1322856|CC|Okay.
1322856|CMP|Okay, on the menu. Did I give you day 5, meal A, yesterday or not?
1322856|CC|I guess you did not.
1322856|CMP|Okay. Spiced oat cereal, sausage patties, instant breakfast, coffee, and a half an ambrosia. Okay. Four frankfurters, ate the pears, chocolate pudding, grape drink, and, in addition, I had a grape punch, package of brownies, package of graham crackers, and two gingerbreads. Yes, for the bottom one there, I had turkey and gravy, and an orange beverage, and if I find my chocolate bar, I'm going to eat it today* But I didn't eat it yet. Oh, yes, and I had the vitamins yesterday too.
1322856|CC|Okay, Ron.
1323209|CC|Ron, if you'd like, I could give you a summary of the EVA-1. I'm just sort of editing the report put out by the back room on that.
1323209|CMP|Sure. Go ahead, Gordo; Appreciate it.
1323209|CC|Okay. I'll read a few selected excerpts here. The surface around the landing site is generally an undulating plain, which was somewhat rougher and had a greater abundance of blocks than was expected by the astronauts. It is saturated with small craters not exceeding a few centimeters in size but not with larger craters. Small craters commonly have glass on their floors. Boulders ranging from about 1/2 meter to 4 meters are common. All of them are partially buried or covered with the dust of the dark mantle. In one locality, a crater of about 1 meter deep pentrated the relatively fine dark surface material and excavated small blocks. Other shallower craters in this area did not fully penetrate the mantle. This fact, together with the abundance of small boulders on and near the surface, indicates that the dark mantle is relatively thin. A minor amount of dust noted upon landing suggested a thin layer of fine grain unconsolidated material. Footprints and LRV tracks left firm impressions in the fine grain material when darker material was kicked up from underneath. At the ALSEP site, the drill encountered harder material several times and definitely seem to reach harder material at about a 7-foot depth. The deep drill core apparently also bottomed in harder material. In the core, the material was noted to be cohesive, and it contained more fragments than did the surficial material. Predominant rock type between the LM and Steno Crater is medium grained, vesicular or nonvesicular basalts or gabbro. They contain about equal amounts of plagioclase and pyroxene along with less abundant opaque material. The guys took a total of - well, they took a lot of pictures. They had 229 color and 197 black-and-white during EVA-1. And they got 17 samples in addition to the deep drill core. Three were large, unbagged rocks, and the total, excluding the core, estimated to weigh about 13 kilograms so far, and they traveled about 3 kilometers in the Rover. As a summary conclusion, the observations made on the first EVA support the premission interpretation that at least the upper part of the subfloor materials consist of basaltic lava flow. The overlying dark mantle may be part of the regolith on subfloor material, but the possibility that it is an independent unit remains open and will be tested by observations on second and third EVAs. Both the dark mantle and upper sub floor units contain remarkably little foreign material between the ALSEP site and Steno with suggests comparatively young ages. Over.
1323209|CMP|Hey, that sounds like a good report there. They -sounds like they got a lot of stuff done and also getting a lot of good information out of it already.
1323209|CC|Yes. I think that's a safe conclusion. They're going to get a lot more today.
1323552|CMP|Oh, you bet.
1323801|CC|Ron, for your information, the ALSEP seems to be working pretty well. The central station and all the experiments with the exception of one are working normally. The one that's giving them trouble is the LEAM, and the data on the LEAM doesn't seem to want to sync up properly. They're thinking that one over and maybe have something for them to try to get that to - to work right. Over.
1323833|CMP|Oh. Okay. Mighty fine.
1325145|CC|America, Houston. I have a couple of Flight Plan updates to give you. We suggest you take them down before you start the P52, at your convenience. Just so we don't interrupt your preparation for tlie zodiacal light.
1325145|CMP|Okay. Got mag XX from the camera, finally. Something about the zero g - it kind of pulls that crazy little cassette back out of the way, and you have a heck of a time getting the lid closed on that.
1325145|CC|Roger.
1325145|CMP|Okay. Ready for updates.
1325145|CC|Okay. Your T-start time for zodiacal light, goes in there at 133:25, is 133 - -
1325145|CMP|Okay. Have it.
1325145|CC|-- 28:03.
1325145|CMP|T-start, 133:28:03-
1325145|CC|That's correct, and then flip the page over to 134:35.
1325145|CMP|Okay.
1325145|CC|And write in "Charge Battery A."
1325145|CMP|Charge Batt A at 134:35-
1325312|CC|Affirmative. At bottom of the same column, at 134:54, delete "MAPPING CAMERA, RETRACT." And also a couple of lines later, delete "MAPPING CAMERA/LASER ALTIMETER COVER, CLOSED."
1325312|CC|That's affirmative. Above that whole sequence, we have some verifies for you. You can write this in about 134:50. Actually, you better start -start a little higher to have room. "Verify all VHF OFF for sounder pass." And here are the -the steps. "VHF AM, A and B, OFF. VHF AM, RECEIVE ONLY, OFF. VHF BEACON, OFF. And VHF RANGING, OFF." Four steps there. Over.
1325446|CMP|Okay. We'll just verify that all VHF is OFF for sounder operations. VHF, A and B, OFF. RECEIVE, OFF. And RECEIVE ONLY, OFF. BEACON, OFF. And RANGING, OFF.
1325446|CC|Okay. That's all you got - -
1325500|CMP|RANGING is OFF. BEACON has been OFF. RECEIVE ONLY is ON. Okay.
1325500|CMP|Hey, Gordy. How's the fidelity on my transmissions with the way I got the microphone set now?
1325500|CC|Okay, Ron. You sound pretty good to me.
1325500|CMP|Okay. I don't have this comm carrier on very tight. I just wanted to make sure I was still coming through all right.
1325500|CC|Yes, think it's perfectly adequate.
1325500|CMP|Okay.
1325822|CC|Ron, we'd like HIGH GAIN to AUTO.
1325827|CMP|HIGH GAIN to AUTO. You have it.
1325827|CC|Thank you.
1325827|CMP|(Cough)
1325827|CC|Looks like another good one, Ron.
1325827|CMP|Okay.
1325827|CC|Was it good? Torque them up.
1325951|CMP|... at 133:01.
1325951|CC|Okay.
1330558|CC|America, Houston. Give us ACCEPT, and we give you a vector.
1330607|CMP|Okay. You have ACCEPT.
1330814|CC|America, Houston. It's your computer now.
1330814|CMP|Okay. Back to BLOCK.
1331136|CMP|Okay. I'm going to enable jets Charlie 3 and Dog 3 Disable Bravo 3 and Alfa 3.
1331136|CC|Okay, Ron.
1331136|CC|Ron, just for general information on your platform drift rates. Not too bad. X is minus 0.007 degrees per hour, Y - min - plus 0.002, and Z is really hard to believe. It's a minus 0.0003 degrees per hour.
1331136|CMP|(Laughter) Hey, that's beautiful.
1331136|CC|That's got to be some kind of record.
1331136|CMP|Boy, I gues s.
1331136|CC|We may just cancel all further P52s.
1331136|CMP|(Laughter) Yes, they're kind of easy here in lunar orbit. All except that one that I didn't get done on time yesterday. By the time I got around to doing it, I was pointing right at the Moon. Roll and pitch. It was daylight, and I couldn't see any stars. Finally got to the right attitude, so that the PICAPAR would work.
1331136|CC|Roger.
1332130|CMP|Well, Gordo. Looks like I'll lose you right in the middle of this zodiacal light sequencer.
1332130|CC|That's right. We aren't going to be able to be much help. I'll give you a little warning before T-start. But you're on your own after that, I guess.
1332130|CMP|(Laughter) Okay.
1332731|CC|Ron, you have about 30 seconds now until T-start.
1332731|CMP|Ah, hah. Okay. 28:03, we'll start the clock.
1332731|CC|That's affirm.
1332849|CC|Ron, it's about time - coming up on time to start the 90-second exposure.
1332849|CMP|Okay.
1333019|CC|Coming up on time to close the shutter now.
1333019|CMP|Okay.
1333019|CC|Okay, America. We're just about LOS. See you on the other side.
1333143|CMP|Okay, Gordo. Thank you much.
1333143||BEGIN LUNAR REV 24
1341757|CMP|And out on the - on the sides of the wall, also, there's another fresh impact just south of ... I guess it's more west really.
1341757|CC|Hello, America.
1341757|CMP|Okay, Houston. America's here. The - the zodiacal light sequence worked real well. Oddly enough, I ended up right (laughter) on the right setting with the right times and everything. The only thing is on the 8-minute - on the 8-minute picture, for some reason, I didn't notice that the shutter shut as soon as I took it instead of 60 seconds later. So we just missed that picture altogether.
1341757|CC|Okay, Ron. Understand.
1341757|CMP|But the time we worked out good. It was about 2 seconds after the 14:50 - sequence. Not 2 seconds - about 1 second after the 14:50 sequence. And the Sun came up.
1341757|CC|Okay.
1341757|CMP|It's going to be hard to - to determine any real relief around the vicinity of Saenger right in there, because it's right at the zero phase point now.
1341757|CC|Roger.
1342314|CC|Ron, here's some words on what we've been seeing in the sounder and the optical recorder when you get a free moment.
1342314|CMP|Okay. I'm just kind of looking out the window now, Gordo. Go ahead.
1342314|CC|Okay. According to our rather crude read-out on film remaining, it looks like we're using more film than we should be in the recorder, and -it's - if you add up the amount of film used according to that telemetry compared to some times when the RECORDER has been ON and also in STANDBY, it looks like there's a possibility they jive to show that we might be pulling film through the RECORDER in - while we're in STANDBY. This is unlikely because it takes a couple of failures that we don't think are really likely at all, but we're going to try to run a little test at 134:50, during that sequence of getting set up with the VHF sounder pass.
1342314|CC|It will just involve a couple of switch throwings by you to try to conclusively prove that this is or is not the case. Over.
1342314|CMP|Oh, okay. Mighty fine. Sure. When you get to it there, just holler out the switches because I'll be over at the panel at that time.
1342314|CC|Okay.
1342651|CMP|I kind of hope our telemetry is wrong.
1342922|CMP|How'd you like to have the PAN CAMERA POWER, ON, here?
1342922|CC|Okay. We're ready.
1342935|CMP|Okay. MODE is to STANDBY; PAN CAMERA POWER is coming ON.
1342935|CMP|You know, Houston, just west of Condorcet and on the edge of - -
1342935|CC|Okay. We need the PAN CAMERA, OFF now, and then go - -
1343114|CMP|- - the hills down in there. Oh, okay. PAN CAMERA is OFF.
1343114|CC|Roger. Go ahead.
1343114|CMP|But you get the same vertical - you get the same vertical streaking that we do on the edge of Serenitatis , off in the Massif units.
1343114|CC|Roger.
1343114|CMP|Coming up at Picard now. Looking at it - a little bit from a distance, there's a darker albedo that goes about a half a crater in diameter from it. And then, on top of that darker albedo - it only goes out maybe a fourth of a crater diameter - there's a lighter type material - that seems to be covering it up. The lighter type material though only goes in a generally westerly - well, from the south around to the west side and then kind of from the northeast around to the northwest side, and it leaves the dark material draping down in the side of Picard on the east side of Picard.
1343114|CC|Roger.
1343114|CMP|It looks like it's a - fairly easy to - When you
1343114||go around the south to the west side, it has a light material on it. You can pretty well carry a light layer in the top portion of the wall all the way around to that - that part where it stops - where the light part stops. And then you come to a dark layer again - and then - as you continue around from the west to go on around to the north side. It's a little bit in shadow on the east side, so I can't tell for sure whether that light layer's in there or not. But starting on the south side, boing around to the west again, you can see a layer of dark - dark material, although it - there doesn't seem to be a change in the slope - in the slope or the inner wall of the crater.
1343114|CC|Okay.
1343114|CMP|And then just below - just below the dark layer, again a change in slope a little bit. It maintains that a slope throughout the - all the way down to the crater floor, where you get into the slump blocks. And then in the center of the crater, it looks like a maria-type film with -Yes, I'm about to lose sight of it again, but with something comparable to a central peak: in it. And I'll have to get the rest of that a little bit later on.
1343114|CC|Roger.
1343114|CMP|You know right west of - I think it's Yerkes or Yerkes or whatever it is - between there and Proclus, there's a real small crater I'm looking at with the binocs. And the reason it stands out is because it's a fresh - fresh crater and yet it's a dark - dark halo all the way around it.
1343114|CC|Roger.
1343114|CMP|And it's also dark down on the inside of it. I still don't have a feeling for the relative size of things. I'll try to get that one in the next - next pass around through here. But that's what I would call a small, maybe even in the - thousand-meter bracket. Probably somewhere in there.
1343114|CC|Roger, Ron.
1343114|CMP|Am I suppose to charge battery A here somewhere?
1343114|CC|That's affirm when you get a chance. And also, you are due tc turn some switches on panel 230.
1343729|CMP|Okay. Let's see, BATTERY VENT VALVE is s+.ill on VENT, and we're not tied together. BA1- RELAY BUS BAT A is OUT. Okay; 32 volts. Go to BAT CHARGER BAT A. About 2-1/2 - 2 - 2-1/4 amps.
1343729|CC|Okay.
1343729|CMP|And 34 volts on the charge.
1343729|CC|Okay.
1343729|CMP|This work gets interesting. After that, I got to go to 230, huh?
1343729|CC|Right.
1343819|CMP|Okay; let's - You want to get that lunar sounder stuff, now? Sounder's STANDBY; RECORDER is ON. RADAR is ON. RECORDER is OFF. MODE vent to VHF.
1343819|CC|Okay; sounds good.
1343850|CMP|And all the VH - all the VH switch - VHF/AM switches are verified, OFF.
1343850|CC|Ron, I got one more update for the Flight Plan, unless something interesting at the window. There is no - no hurry on that update.
1343850|CMP|Okay; let me take another look at the landing site, and then I'll get it. Okay?
1343850|CC|Okay; fine.
1343957|CMP|Okay, the Sun's getting a little bit higher now. And as I look at the landing site and the albejo - differences in the color in there - the color in the Maraldi Gamma is the same as in the landing site itself. And, also, it looks like the type of material that we say is essentially covering the whole area - goes on out to and includes the annulus of Serenitatis.
1343957|CC|Roger.
1343957|CMP|Let's see. Did I mention that - that it looks like - the flow out of Maraldi has gone on around it and down to, and almost encroaches on the Vitruvius A. But, it's breached out of the side of Maraldi. Gone around that depression and up to the side of Vitruvius A.
1343957|CC|Roger, Ron.
1343957|CMP|You still get that same bluish - bluish-type tint from the area in the landing site. At station number 2, on the landslide - it's going to be a pretty good - pretty good little depression there. The scarp itself - it looks like they had picked the least-slope portion to go up it. And, that's kind of between Lara - I think Lara's the one, right - the crater just to the west of the scarp.
1343957|CC|Roger. I haven't been on all your revs. You ever had any - anything you'd call a visual on the IM?
1344236|CMP|No, I really haven't looked that much, Gordo. See, my optics are always pointing up in the air; so I can't use the sextant. The binocs - I'm having a heck of a time holding them still enough to - to concentrate on anything very small.
1344236|CC|Roger,
1344236|CMP|Oh, when we're coming around the dark annulus , follow it around, by Menelaus and Tacquet, and then - it kind of changes - seems to change colors a little bit when we get up to the Sulpicius Gallus.
1344236|CC|Roger.
1344236|CMP|I guess the only thing you can say is that - the southern part there, in the Tacquet region, has a more of a bluish tint. And, then to me, this has more of a brownish tint to it when you get to the Sulpicius Gallus region.
1344236|CC|Roger.
1344236|CMP|Hey, wait a minute. I'm just now passing Menelaus now. So, it changes color right at the - Tacquet and then - at about Tacquet and Menelaus. Sulpicius Gallus is just now coming up.
1344236|CMP|You know, I think Sun angle has got a heck of a lot to do with that, because this whole thing -in the Sulpicius Gallus region looks kind of brownish to me.
1344735|CC|Okay.
1344735|CMP|I'll have to check that when the Sun gets a little bit higher when I'm coming across there again.
1344735|CC|Roger.
1344735|CMP|Okay, Gordo. I guess I'd better get some work done here. (Laughter)
1344735|CC|Okay. I would like you to go through all those switches as shown on the Flight Plan. And, when you finish all of those with SM/AC power OFF, I have a couple more for you.
1344735|CMP|Okay. I forgot to turn the lights on in hare. I can't see in the dark.
1344735|CMP|Okay, MAPPING CAMERA - is that the right time? Let's see - 49? No, wait just a second on the mapping camera, there. It takes good terminator pictures, too, doesn't it?
1344735|CC|Ron, go ahead and turn the mapping camera off. Just a minute or 2 ago, it started acting up. We'll turn it off now and troubleshoot it later.
1345038|CMP|Okay. The MAPPING CAMERA is OFF right now. Eight, 30 seconds.
1345038|CMP|Okay, MAPPING CAMERA is STANDBY. IMAGE MOTION is OFF.
1345038|CMP|Okay, there we go - STANDBY. Now, IMAGE MOTION is OFF. We got a barberpole ... - a gray, okay. Now MAPPING CAMERA to OFF. LASER ALTIMETER to OFF. Okay, you want the RECORDER to ON, huh? All right. IR is going OFF. PAN CAMERA, SELF TEST is going OFF.
1345214|CC|Wait until sunset on the next one.
1345214|CMP|And, the o - oh, okay. I can really tell sunset because the - that EVA pole that sticks out here by window 5. Looks like it's lit up now the way the Sun's shining on it.
1345214|CC|Roger.
1345214|CMP|Hey, Gordo. How good is that VOX? Could you hear me chewing?
1345214|CC|No, I can't hear you chewing. Hear you talking fine.
1345214|CMP|Okay. That's good, then.
1345214|CMP|That has to be sunset.
1345214|CC|About the right time.
1345629|CMP|Okay, V is OFF. Now, I'm gonna close the IR COVER, barberpole, gray; UV COVER, barberpole and gray. Okay, turn the old SM/AC POWER, OFF.
1345629|CC|Okay, Ron. Now - now we want LUNAR - LUNAR SOUNDER OPERATE switch to OPERATE.
1345629|CMP|Okay. Go to OPERATE -
1345715|CMP|Now.
1345715|CC|What we're doing this for is to get a readout of the film quantity.
1345715|CMP|Gh, I see.
1345715|CC|Okay, we got her. You go back to LUNAR SOUNDER OPERATE switch to STANDBY, now.
1345715|CMP|Okay, LUNAR SOUNDER is in STANDBY.
1345715|CC|Okay, that completes that test. I have a couple more additions to the Flight Plan for - for 136: 35, is the first one.
1345715|CMP|Okay, I'm there.
1345715|CC|Okay, 136:35, add VERB 48 (11102) (01111).
1345715|CMP|Okay at 136: 35, VERB 48, (21102) and (01111).
1345715|CC|Okay, that first one is three ones - 02.
1345715|CMP|Okay, three ones - 02 and a zero, four ones.
1345715|CC|Right. What we're doing here is making a 20-degree roll by keeping P20 going, to allow them to cal the VHF - I guess they had some unexpected noise on the VHF sounder and they want to - slip this in as another check on it. So, the next step is 136:44 and at that time put in VERB 22, NOUN 78 (plus 072.24), then VERB 58 ENTER. Then some words, "When maneuver complete, wait 20 seconds." Then, a VERB 22, NOUN 78 (plus 052.25). That's plus 052.25. And follow that with a VERB 58 ENTER. And, then one more line - you still with me?
1345715|CMP|Yes, still with you. Got it.
1345715|CC|Okay, at 136:47, write in "VERB 48" and we go back to (lllOl) and zero and four ones.
1345715|CMP|Okay. At 44, we - VERB 22, NOUN 78 [sic] - that changes to 72.24 degrees. And VERB 58. Okay, then we - we're going to stay at that attitude for 20 seconds. Then change it back to plus-X forward SIM bay attitude again. And as soon as we get back, we'll change our DAP back to two tenths of a degree per second.
1345715|CC|That's right and what this will do is stick the VHF antenna right straight down at nadir for a count.
1345715|CMP|Okay.
1345715|CC|Hey, at your convenience, we need AUTO and HIGH GAIN.
1350234|CMP|You have AUTO.
1350234|CMP|Pretty convenient when you're laying in the center couch. (Laughter)
1350234|CMP|(Humming)
1350234|CC|Ron, I got the morning news, if you're interested and I can watch the clock there for that DATA SYSTEM ON time. Or OFF time, rather.
1350234|CMP|Okay, sure. Go ahead.
1350234|CC|Okay. - -
1350234|CMP|... setting up the camera.
1350234|CC|Front pages around the country; they're headlining last night's EVA, as you might expect, with photographs taken from TV monitors showing Ceman and Schmitt doing their tasks. And by the way, their TV camera is spectacularly clear and sharp. It's almost like a regular studio TV. In other news, South Vietnam's President Thieu is - -
1350547|CMP|Outstanding.
1350547|CC|-- is suggesting that all prisoners of war be released before Christmas. He's also asked that all Vietnamese parties be included in peace negotiations. South Vietnam and the Viet Cong are not directly represented in the secret talks now underway in Paris, Meanwhile, Henry Kissinger met for more than 4 hours, yesterday, with Hanoi representative Lee Due Tho. The two negotiators are expected to meet again this afternoon. The former President Harry Truman is still resting quietly although his condition remains serious, according to his doctors. American poet, Mark Van Doren, died at the age of 78. He was a professor of literature at Columbia and a winner of the 19^0 Pulitzer Prize for his poetry. President Nixon announced, yesterday, that he wants to extend wage price control beyond the scheduled April 30 expiration. He also plans to freeze new hiring, promotions, and pay increases for executives of the Federal Government. I guess that doesn't include us. The Republican National Committee has a - -
1350659|CMP|(Laughter) I don't think it does either.
1350659|CC|- - a new chairman - George Bush of Houston, who is now ambassador to the United Nations. He will continue his UN post through the present session of the General Assembly. Both national political parties are now headed by Texans. I simply mention to you, Robert Strauss of Dallas became chairman of the Democratic National Committee last Saturday. And, when you see Jack again, you can tell him he has been replaced by the Nimbus 5 weather satellite which is operating in orbit after being launched from Vandenburg very early Monday morning.
1350741|CMP|(Laughter) Outstanding.
1350741|CC|Joe Namath - I think you might have heard the football score last night - the Oakland Raiders got to Namath and the Jets in a - in the fourth-quarter and beat them 24 to 16. Namath passed for more than 400 yards, but only scored one touchdown. And Houston weather, we've had two kinds of weather since you've left: it's been either cold and rainy, or chilly and rainy. And, it's foggy and drizzly here again today and temperatures are expected to rise to the mid 40's and go down to a low of 32 tonight. There you have it.
1350741|CMP|Gee, whiz. I thank you.
1350741|CC|Any time. You need to get to the DATA SYSTEM switch. And turn on the sounder at - in about a minute.
1350741|CMP|Okay.
1350948|CMP|Okay. DATA SYSTEM is OFF, 58, 59 - oops.
1351003|CMP|MARK it. Okay, went to OPERATE.
1351003|CC|Okay.
1351003|CMP|All talkbacks are still gray.
1351003|CC|Roger.
1352816|CC|America, Houston. About 3 minutes to LOS. Spacecraft looks good and the sounder's filling the Moon with RF energy, just the way it's supposed to. Over.
1352816|CMP|Hey, outstanding. Trying to consolidate all of my trash. Man, I didn't realize you had so much junk.
1352816|CC|Roger.
1361722|CC|Hello, America. Houston. Over.
1361728|CMP|Hello, Houston. This is America; loud and clear.
1361728|CC|You, too.
1362650|CMP|Houston, America. Magazine Lima Lima will be starting with frame 54.
1362658|CC|Okay. We copy that, Ron. The sounder still looks good, perking right away. And the mapping camera funny I mentioned earlier - we haven't nailed down exactly what it is. Most likely, we think it's just an instrumentation erroneous indication. And so, we're going to continue with the normal schedule of activities on the mapping camera, except, of course, for the deploy and retraction.
1362730|CMP|Uh-huh. Okay. Well, hey, that - let's hope that's what it is then.
1362735|CC|Roger.
1362922|CMP|I'd like to change that instruct to frame 55 instead of 54. I just took a picture of the crater on the - well, I guess southwest of Crisium.
1362937|CC|Okay, Ron - -
1362937|CMP|- - ... different. It's got a light-color -light-colored dike or something through the central peak in the bottom of the small crater. The crater's about - oh, 30 to 50 kilometers, I guess, in diameter.
1362957|CC|Roger.
1363003|CMP|The small crater vest of Condorcet.
1363010|CC|Okay.
1363328|CMP|You know, the Crater Peirce has got that same dark halo around its crater, and it extends out - again, you can see it real well out to about a half a crater diameter. You don't see any of the light-colored ejecta on top of it though, like you do on Picard.
1363349|CC|Okay.
1364030|CMP|Boy, that Scarp sure looks like a flow boundary to me.
1364037|CC|Roger. On the landing site Scarp?
1364041|CMP|Yes. I don't know how you get it to go up the North Massif, but it sure looks like it runs that way - just from the shadows and everything.
1364245|CMP|Gordo, does this go all the way out to Bessel? Does it cross the annulus ridge there?
1364256|CC|It doesn't go all the way to Bessel. It stops short of Bessel. About halfway across Serenity from the Taurus-Littrow to Bessel.
1364308|CMP|Oh, okay. Forgot to look where it stopped.
1364413|CMP|Okay. I ended up on frame 92.
1364417|CC|Okay. We copy that. Frame 92.
1364422|CC|Okay. Ron, HIGH GAIN to AUTO when you get a chance.
1364622|CMP|Okay. There's our 20 seconds or so.
1365404|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 136:54 GET. We have now shifted over to air-ground 1 for the first wake-up call to the crew of Challenger at the landing site, Taurus-Littrow. We have dropped the Command Service Module circuit air-ground 2. Live and listening on the lunar module circuit at 136:54 this is Apollo Control.
1365503|CC|(Music: Ride of the Valkyries)
1365639|CC|Good morning, Challenger.
1365645|LMP|Sounded like Parker has the duty. Both monumental and epic.
1365651|CC|Jack, that's supposed to take you back to Cal Tech final's week.
1365702|LMP|(Humming)
1365740|LMP|How's everything look, Gordy?
1365742|CC|Couldn't look better. How's it look to you?
1365751|LMP|Well, it's nice to have rested some.
1365757|CC|Roger. I'm sure of that.
1365813|LMP|How do our consumables look today?
1365818|CC|They look good, as expected. Right on.
1365911|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The wakeup music this morning for Challenger was the "Ride of Valkyries" from Richard Wagner's Opera Die Walkure. Apparently, Jack Schmitt, when he was at Cal Tech had his roommates sitting bolt upright in bed in the morning by playing this on the stereo system, and this was the appropriate choice of music for waking him up this morning. Thirty minutes from -
1365952|LMP|Be through in a jiffy.
1370035|LMP|Stow your sleep restraint up there. I mean, your - hammock. Either way. I'll - I'll just stuff my - I'll stuff all mine in this compartment here, if you'll just get yours in there. Otherwise, we can rearrange it. See how it looks first.
1370158|LMP|Gordy, you guys held comm pretty well last night, I only remember one - one break.
1370205|CC|Roger, Jack.
1370240|LMP|Take you off biomed for a minute.
1370424|LMP|We have ...
1370431|LMP|Well, how about it, Gordy? Are we STAY or NO STAY for EVA-2 prep?
1370437|CC|You're STAY. Never any doubt.
1370443|LMP|Thank you, sir.
1370542|LMP|Have any medication?
1370550|CDR|My report to ...
1370559|LMP|Okay, Gordy. Status report is excellent. No medication for either one of us. CDR slept 6 hours pretty good; I slept 6 hours intermittent, but generally good.
1370617|CC|Okay, Jack.
1370622|LMP|And we've eaten well, I think. The food's a little bit confused since we had our little - minor explosion in the cabin, but - I think you can just say it's good. We've had a lot to drink, a lot of juices. We ate the frankfurters. We're sharing a lot of the stuff because it's not symmetrically packed. If you want more details, it will take time.
1370706|LMP|Huh? No.
1370713|LMP|And, Gordy, we did not eat the corn chowder.
1370717|CC|Okay. Roger. You did not eat the corn chowder, but most everything else on the menu. is that right?
1370726|LMP|Yes, we got just about everything else. We got into - maybe mixed up two meals, but essentially - meal B and C for yesterday were eaten, except for the corn chowder.
1370745|CC|Okay, Jack. We copy. We're wondering if you could come up with a quantitative estimate on the water you've each drunk - drunk and also your PRD readings.
1370823|LMP|Stand by, Gordy. That may be difficult. ... Yes, we'll get the PRD a little bit later when we start suiting up.
1370837|CC|Yes; okay. That'll be fine. My mistake.
1370843|CDR|Hey, Gordy, on this water. We saturated ourselves before we went out. I finished my drink bag out in the suit on the surface. Jack finished about better than three-quarters of his. We've had water and tea and then the juice, and we have been drinking water constantly - post-EVA. And to give you a quantity is almost impossible.
1370911|CC|Okay; that's fine.
1370917|CDR|If the water is down, it's probably because we've been drinking it. And I'm ready for your lift-off pad data.
1370925|CC|Okay. For rev 26, lift-off time is 138:40:15; 27 is 140:38:49; 142:37:22; 144:35:55; 146:34:29; 148:33:03. And the last one, rev 32, is 150:31:37 Go ahead.
1371029|CDR|Okay; rev 26. is that the first one, Gordy?
1371034|CC|That's affirm.
1371041|CDR|Okay. Rev 26 is 138:40:15; 140:38:49; 142:37:22; 144:35:55; 146:34:29; 148:33:03; 150:31:37. And what's our present rev?
1371109|CC|Okay, I'll have to check that myself. We're on rev 25. He's about three-quarters of the way across the front side. Coming up back side will start 26.
1371136|CDR|Okeydoke.
1371136|CC|And, for your information, he's running the VHF SOUNDER, and it's working fine.
1371148|CDR|That's good to hear. By the way, good morning, Gordy.
1371152|CC|Good morning, commander.
1371157|CDR|How does America itself look?
1371159|CC|Just as good as ever. I added on the consumables. No problem on the spacecraft systems. Only minor funnies in the SIM bay, but even it is almost 100 percent.
1371220|CDR|Okay. And I guess from - I didn't hear your comment, but I guess Challenger is the same way.
1371226|CC|That's affirm. That's the way it looks here, anyway.
1371316|CC|Challenger, Houston. We've been working while you've been sleeping on a fix for the missing fender. John Young has been over working it out in the suit with the mockup Rover, and we have about probably 5 to 10 minutes worth of words on how do you want to go about that. Whenever you have that much time to listen - it'll be mostly listening on your part - let us know.
1371342|CDR|Okay, Gordy. Will do.
1371412|LMP|No. Well, I did but ...
1371533|LMP|Gordy, you've implied that we may be a little behind on water, is that correct?
1371547|CC|No. That's - that's not the problem, Jack. I think our concern was more that you - that you were taking enough - enough onboard internally.
1371610|LMP|Our water.
1371611|CC|That's right, that you were drinking enough. That's what we were worried about.
1371620|LMP|Okay; we'll keep pushing it.
1371700|LMP|...
1371734|CDR|Oh, a ...
1371801|LMP|And cold scrambled eggs. ...
1371913|CDR|Gordy, we're going to start to eat here. Why don't you talk to us about that fender?
1371919|CC|Okay; let me round up - John Young. He stepped out - for a second. We'll have him here in a minute. Might as well let the resident expert on fenders talk.
1371957|CC|Okay; I'll now turn the microphone over to Captain Young.
1372004|CC|Hey, Geno. This is John. We spent - -
1372010|CDR|Hello, John. How you doing?
1372011|CC|Oh, just fine. You guys are doing a superb job; really beautiful. Hey, we spent some time on this - fender problem and worked out a pretty simple-minded procedure, which involves essentially taking four of those chronopaque pages out of your lunar surface maps, ones which are not going to be used for discussing the site, taping them together with gray tape so that you end up with a piece of paper about 15 inches by 10-1/2 inches, and then using the AOT lamp clamps, preposition them full opened, and taking them out, and taking that piece of paper out, laying it on top of the fender guide rails and - and clamping the edges of it with the AOT lamp clamps. It's simple and straightforward, and the beauty of it is you're only spending about 2 minutes in the clamping operation, and it could save you up to about 12 dusting, I think maybe. What do you think?
1372141|CDR|Yes, John. I - I - I think we ought to try something because you told me, but I - I guess you can't appreciate it until you see it happen yourself. That - that dust without that fender is just almost unacceptable. It - this sounds pretty good. How do you want those things taped together?
1372204|CC|You just take four pages and allow - Well, I've got the detailed procedures here, if you're ready to copy. Over.
1372215|CDR|Well, no. I'm not ready to copy yet, but what do you do? Tape the four squares into a bigger square about16 by 20.
1372221|CC|Yes. Allow about an inch of overlap, and tape both sides of them.
1372227|CDR|Okay.
1372230|CC|And then you get the AOT clamps off the utility lights and open the clamp jaws to max. And you stow the clamps, and you roll up the paper - roll up the - roll up your fender shortwise and put a gray tab over that and stow it in the ETB. You got both the clamps and the paper fender in the ETB. And then when you get out to the Rover, you lay the edge of your fender over the inboard guide rail and clamp it, and then you lay the other edge of the sheet over the outboard rail and clamp it. And the only thing you're - really have to worry about is making sure that the inboard clamp is right over the shock strut so that you don't get any interference with the LRV structure when you turn the wheels.
1372337|CDR|Yes, that's the type of thing I was going to ask about, some of those subtle points. There - there really should be quite aways - Well, I'll look at it - but almost vertical over the hub. Right?
1372347|CC|Yes, on the inboard one. On the inboard one. On the outboard one, if you put it a little further back aft on the wheel, it - it allows you to - it allows you to give your paper fender a little more rigidity.
1372410|CDR|And you just say lay them over the guide rails, so the clamps - put the clamps - so the clamps are also over the guide rails. They're not trying in linw that - the makeshift fender in the guide rails itself, huh?
1372427|CC|No, it - Just clamp the thing right to the rails. Just allow a little overlap, and clamp that rascal right down. And I know you can tighten those clamps down so good it'll never get loose. I know - I know you can do it if I can do it.
1372446|CDR|Okay, John. I think I know what you're talking about, and I'd sure like to give it a stab. The only hooker is I hope that tape holds the fenders together well enough - -
1372459|CC|Yes, they - -
1372459|CDR|- - the pieces together well enough.
1372502|CC|Roger. One of the things - when you're taping the - the pages together that you want to be careful of is that you - is that you make sure and get the air bubbles out so when you get in a vacuum, it doesn't open up by itself. And maybe you can put an X across there to - to make sure that you - if you get any separation - that's it's still held together pretty good. We think the tape will work - -
1372531|CDR|Okay.
1372534|CC|- - think the tape will work because back about in 13, we were using it just sort of incidentally in the thermal vacuum chamber, and it worked okay there for some reason.
1372548|CDR|It would seem to stick on the surface okay if I could find a dust-free spot when I put that other fender on earlier.
1372556|CC|Yes, I agreed.
1372559|CDR|As far as - as far as how much of the new fender to overlap on the present fender, just make it about symmetrical with the other side, and that probably ought to give me plenty of overlap, huh?
1372611|CC|Well, if you - are you talking about over the dovetail part of it, or are you talking about off the aft end of the - of the vehicle?
1372625|CDR|I'm talking about - about the present fender that's on there, the aft end of that fender. About how much overlap do you want with this makeshift fender? Just give me an idea. I think I could figure out when I get there, but I'd rather have your feelings before I do.
1372643|CC|We think if you get it out about 4 inches past that fender - You understand what this looks like when you get it put on the fender. It just looks like sort of a roll, and you end up with a sort of a straight fender right at the back end of the - of the - of the Rover - a sort of a straight - about half a pipe straight out there. And, if you get it out 4 or 5 inches, that will keep the dust from coming back over the vehicle.
1372720|CDR|Yes, that's the answer I wanted. That would be about 4 or 5 inches grace.
1372724|CC|Yes, it's just sort of like a - a horizontal fender, like on a - a old automobile.
1372736|LMP|I thought I understood what he was talking about. ...
1372741|CC|Say again, Geno.
1372748|LMP|Hey, John. This is Jack. Did you say pipe there a minute ago? P-i-p-e?
1372756|CC|Yes, but it doesn't roll up into a circle; it's sort of a - a hemisphere. I mean it's half of one.
1372807|LMP|Oh, okay, I thought I was reading you until you said pipe, and then you lost me. Okay, I think I understand, too.
1372813|CC|You know the problem I have with communications.
1372821|LMP|Hey, thank you, babe. We'll give it a try. I think we can get something to work.
1372827|CC|Okay. And we can watch you on the tube - and make recommendations if - I think you've got the idea of it. And, you know Terry Neil thought of these AOT clamps, and that's a great idea because you can - you can clamp those things - on that - that old dog tail, you can put a force on there, that - those pages - that chronopaque pages will never get loose.
1372858|CDR|Yes, on those other clamps we had, I was thinking about - paper clip type clamps would never hack it.
1372906|CC|We tried that - they just don't have - they don't have the push.
1372913|CDR|Sounds good, babe; appreciate it.
1372920|CC|Okay. We've got a detailed procedure here if you're - if you want to copy it; just in case.
1372934|CDR|Yes. Stand by 1, though.
1372936|CC|Okay.
1372942|CDR|Hey, you know, after thinking and looking at the map last night, and recalling what I saw during landing and where I was planning on putting it down and everything, I still think, to the best of my knowledge, that we are about 1 or 2 o'clock, and I'll increase up to about 200 meters or so west and slightly north of Poppy.
1373014|CC|Okay, Geno.
1373036|CDR|... ahead of you ...
1373045|CDR|Hey, Gordie, the thing that fooled me yesterday is this depression out at - out at 9 o'clock here, which I - is greatly undersized for Trident, really isn't Trident, and I said yesterday, I didn't think how we could be that close. Well, we really aren't Trident is way out there, and I'll still hold to my 200 meters at 1 to 2 o'clock of Poppy.
1373109|CC|Okay. We're thinking you might have, on the way to the geology stops, driven between a couple of the Trident craters then.
1373131|CDR|Yes, we may have coming back - I think I went all the way around to the east of the last one going out, though.
1373140|CC|Okay.
1373157|CDR|If you had asked me at 3 or 4 thousand feet where we were going to land, I could have told you exactly. But, once you decide where it's going to be, then you decide where in that where it's going to be if you forget everything else around you.
1373210|CC|Roger.
1373247|CDR|Besides, Gordy, when you land on a boat, all you're worried about is that the boat's there. You let the captain worry about where it is.
1373256|CC|Roger.
1373403|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 137 hours 34 minutes. America with Ron Evans is behind the Moon. We'll acquire in 40 minutes on the 25th revolution.
1373450|CDR|Gordy, while we're eating, have you got a short synopsis of the news?
1373455|CC|Yes. Sure do. Stand by 1. We'd like BIOMED, LEFT, please.
1373517|CDR|I don't have any sensors on, Gordy.
1373525|CC|Okay.
1373530|CDR|You have to wait until I start putting my suit on.
1373546|CC|Okay. As you might have expected, front pages around the country are headlining last night's EVA with photographs taken from TV monitors shoving you and Jack going about your tasks. And, I might add, that the TV camera is really spectacular. It couldn't have been a clearer or more beautiful picture, both for fidelity and color. In other news, South Vietnam's President Thieu has suggested that all prisoners of war be released before Christmas. He has also asked that all Vietnamese parties be included in peace negotiations. South Vietnam and the Viet Cong are now not directly represented in the secret talks now under way in Paris. Meanwhile, Kissinger met for more than 4 hours yesterday with Hanoi representative Le Duc Tho. The two negotiators are expected to meet again this afternoon. The former President, Harry Truman, is still resting quietly, although his condition remains serious according to his doctors. American poet Mark van Doren died at the age of 78 - He was a professor of literature at Columbia and a winner of the 1940 Pulitzer Prize for his poetry. President Nixon announced yesterday that he wants to extend wage price controls beyond the scheduled April 30 expiration date. He also plans to freeze new hiring, promotions, and pay increases for executives of the Federal Government, which doesn't affect us, I guess. The Republican National Committee has a new chairman.
1373730|CDR|How about me?
1373731|CC|George Bush of Houston, who is now Ambassador to the United Nations. He will continue his UN post through the present session of the General Assembly. Both national political parties are now headed by Texans. As you recall, Robert Strauss of Dallas became Chairman of the Democratic National Committee last Saturday. And Jack, I'm sorry to say but you've been replaced. The Nimbus 5 weather satellite is now operating after its launch from Vandenberg early Monday morning.
1373808|LMP|Can it talk?
1373813|CC|Joe Namath tried mightily to lead the Jets to the play-offs, but the Oakland Raiders grounded the Jets in the fourth quarter, 24 to 16. I think you have already heard that score. Namath passed some more than 400 yards, but he was only able - New York only scored one touchdown. And the last item concerns the Houston weather, which has been - there's been two kinds of weather since you all left us: That's cold and light rain and cold and heavy rain, and it's still doing it. Fog and drizzly rain are here now, and we're only supposed to get up to the mid-40s and probably down to 32 tonight. Over.
1373908|LMP|Holy Smoly. That doesn't sound too good on the weather. I'm going to take a look, right here up the overhead window.
1373954|LMP|Gordy, you're right. There's a band of clouds that comes right up the coast of Mexico. Looks like it comes ... Old Mexico and then gets very dense as it comes up into the Texas area and southeastern part of the United States with a - with a counterclockwise rotation which gets very dense down over the Atlantic, I believe, off the east coast - southern east coastal states and from about, oh, I'm guessing, maybe the center of Texas straight north, straight east. It looks like the whole country's cloudy.
1374036|CC|Roger.
1374044|LMP|Baja looks nice; west coast of Mexico looks nice.
1374048|CC|Roger.
1374054|LMP|At Taurus Littrow, the weather's great.
1374403|LMP|Hey, Houston; Challenger.
1374406|CC|Go ahead.
1374412|LMP|Roger, Gordy. How's the ALSEP doing and in that light I hope you people will take as close a look as you can at the signal strength and its variation and see if you get some idea whether, when I go after the neutron flux tomorrow, if I ought to work on that antenna alignment again. I'm still a little bit concerned about it.
1374438|CC|Okay, Jack. We'll consider that, although they've been getting good performance out of the central station, as I understand, and a couple of problems with the experiments. One was the LEAM data isn't syncing up like it should. I'll have to get a further, more complete story on that. And we're thinking that's - -
1374506|LMP|I told you.
1374506|CC|- mostly a ground software problem. The other one is the LSG isn't leveling up properly, and we'll cover this further in the pre - the planning briefing for the EVA here, but we're probably going to let you off - I mean have Geno let Jack off at the Rover - I mean at the ALSEP. Let him off the Rover at the ALSEP and take another look at the leveling on the LSG. That'll be at the end of the EVA.
1374548|LMP|Roger. I may just run out there and let Gene pick me up after we - after I turn - well - while he fixes the fender maybe - We'll work that out, Gordy. I'm joking, but maybe I could go kick the LEAM - that might help it.
1374606|CC|Let's make sure we've got all our problems solved down here before you do that.
1374614|LMP|Okay, hey, Family Mountain, the northeast facing slopes, although lower has boulders and outcrops. I mean, belay the outcrop. It has boulders from local block concentrations. Looks very much like the South Massif does.
1374638|CC|Roger
1374732|CDR|... the old sinuses ...
1374831|CDR|I've about had it, I think.
1374837|LMP|... chocolates?
1374840|CDR|Huh? No, I've had two.
1374842|LMP|Oh. ...
1374947|CDR|Hey, Gordo, we're still eating, but let me give you a few observations. That outcrop I talked about that was way at the top of the South Massif at the break in slope - at the very top of the break in slope - almost looks - it's hard to tell that it's inplace outcrop up there. It's hard to convince myself that it is. Looks like there's some very large and many, many small fragments of large - like 3 and 4-meter rocks up there and a lot of smaller fragments. I've seen that type of of thing in a number of places over the South Massif. However, I - do see - they also, they all seem to be sitting on top of the South Massif surface, but I do see one other area that it looks like there is a - it is protruding from within some sort of mantle on the South Massif. So conceivably some of that could be a place [?]. An additional impression I got is - is that at least with the monocular, that those fragments - those boulders look much more angular than what we've seen here. And, for the most part, they appear to be - if covered at all - very little by any mantle except the one I just mentioned.
1375119|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1375124|LMP|And, Gordy, through the monocular, they - in contrast to the tan gray of the South Massif, those large blocks up there look blue - very distinctly blue-gray. Not unlike Gene mentioned yesterday, anorthosite - anorthosites look in certain terrestrial environments.
1375149|CC|Roger, Jack.
1375153|CDR|And, Gordy, now that I get my - my three-dimensional eyeballs working, I can look up on the scarp - out to 9 and 10 o'clock. It's practically the same color as the South Massif. It just looks to be very undulating. I see no outcrops evidenced from here in the scarp. I think I can just about see where Hole-in-the-Wall is, but it's so subtle that I can't really tell you much about it. And the local terrain, which I think is the southern rim of Camelot, just about blanks out where Hole-in-the-Wall should be - just about covers it up. But what I can see in a small little saddle to our local horizon here in front of us - I can see out there just about - oh, I'd say a 100 meters or so to the south of Hole-in-the-Wall and it just looks like a subtle undulating slope. We can't really tell too much the steepness from here.
1375256|CC|Okay, Geno, we're - Stand by 1.
1375306|CC|Okay. I had something for you, but we just decided to cancel the call. Although, when you do get out the prep and post card, I have one write in for you so just holler when you're - when it's handy.
1375324|CDR|Okay.
1375403|CDR|We're wrapping up our eating and drinking, here now, Gordy. We'll be ready to go in a minute.
1375412|CC|Okay.
1375506|PAO|This is Apollo Control, at 137 hours 55 minutes. The crew of Challenger is 1 hour behind their timeline. This is a hold over from EVA 1. We will continue to run this hour behind so unless, we get further behind during the EVA preparations, we would anticipate EVA 2 to begin around 140 hours 10 minutes elapsed time, versus the 139 hours 10 minutes in the flight plan. 140:10 would be a few minutes past 5:00PM Central Time. America is still out of range. We expect acquisition in 18 minutes.
1375719|LMP|Gordy, Challenger. Could you ask somebody there in the FAO console to - where the hiking kit is - is stowed?
1375731|CC|Okay. Will do.
1380000|CC|Jack, take a look on the right-hand side stowage compartment there, on the forward lower corner under the LEC kit compartment.
1380029|LMP|Gordy, you broke - broke up with the changeover or something. Say again.
1380058|CC|Okay, Jack. You're right. I got caught right in the middle of a site handover. Look on the right-hand side stowage compartment, the forward lower corner, under the LEC kit compartment.
1380115|LMP|Fantastic. You picked the one place I'd never look.
1380558|LMP|Houston, Challenger.
1380600|CC|Go ahead.
1380604|LMP|One quick thought about the gravimeter. And. I'm sure it's been mentioned, but I'll say it. During the CF squared we asked about that bundle of wires that has contact with the gimbal - and when I deployed it, that bundle was - it still had contact with the gimbal and everybody at the CF squared said that was okay. But, you might think about it. I don't know what I could do to help if that is the problem. But that might be causing the problem here that it wouldn't cause on Earth.
1380639|CC|Okay, Jack. I'll make sure the experts hear that.
1380658|CDR|Gordie, everthing okay at home today?
1380704|CC|Yes, everything is fine here.
1380711|CDR|Well, thank you.
1380717|CC|I'm not sure I copy your question precisely. Haven't talked to - to your home today, at all.
1380730|CDR|Okay. Don't - don't worry about it. I just thought you might have heard.
1380935|CDR|Well, if you hear, Gordie, just tell them they're missed.
1380940|CC|Okay; I'll sure do that.
1380950|LMP|Gordie, has anybody heard from Tucson recently?
1380955|CC|Check on that, Jack. Just a minute.
1381037|LMP|And, Gordie, if you have any updates to the EVA-2 checklist, give me a yell.
1381047|CC|Okay. The update I do have - I think the EVA checklist changes we'll just call you real-time. But, I do have one for the prep card.
1381106|LMP|Go ahead.
1381107|CC|Okay. On the front side there, middle column, lower half at 138:45 OPS CONNECT, half-way down, it says install PURGE valve in PGA, red to red. Mark that LMP serial number 211; CDR, 208. This is to maximize the OPS operation, should you have to use it.
1381143|LMP|Okay. Give me the numbers again, please.
1381145|CC|LMP, 211; CDR, 208.
1381156|LMP|I take it those are serial numbers.
1381158|CC|That's right, the serial numbers on the purge valve.
1381305|CC|Okay, Challenger. This is Houston. Would you like to have a little update on the EVA plans?
1381314|LMP|Do you want me to take notes?
1381317|CC|No, I don't think there are essentially any notes required. I'll make a few real-time callups to you; but, I don't think there's anything you really have to write down.
1381329|PAO|Bob Parker is CAPCOM now.
1381332|LMP|Okay, Bob, I - I realize that things were getting a little hectic yesterday. But, if we end up making any changes where I don't need to get a charge in my hands - that's an awfully good thing to call, because not only does it tire your heart - your hands out holding it, but it means you don't get as many pictures or Rover samples or anything else.
1381357|CC|Roger. You guys are just ahead of us there. We were trying to get that up to you. Okay. No, I don't think there is anything here that really needs to be written down. I'll go through with you first, and we can talk about details and writing in, if you want to on any of them. But, I don't think there is anything that really needs to be written in. The EVA - it is going to be essentially nominal, with two minor exceptions. One is the - we've allowed about 5 minutes extra at the LM before leaving for the Rover fender fix; and, John, we'll be talking to you about that in a minute. And the second big change, is that we're also extend - allowing 5 more minutes at the end of the EVA so that we can have extra time for dusting. And I suspect that if the Rover fender fix works and we aren't getting as dirty as we did last night, then we may gain back that 5 minutes. We're also allowed - well, what we've done is we've taken the time here out of some of the tasks at Station 3 and Station 4. And along with the fact that we think you're a little bit farther east than planned - and we're allowing 4 minutes additional driving time. But again, that's all real-time, and if we're doing well on time, we can reinstitute all those tasks, and get rid of the 5 minutes that we are allowing here, there, or elsewhere. So that's just sort of to keep in your thinking.
1381524|CC|There is a possibility that we'll have some additional overhead at each stop, depending on what the Rover battery temperatures are when you get out this morning. If the Rover - if they're high again, then we'll have to probably park at least on some of the stops, if not all - with the up-Sun heading and dusting the battery covers and then opening them to let them cool. But, again, that will depend upon what we find on the Rover batteries when we get out this morning.
1381552|CC|The variations that we found on the surface of the South Massif indicating a possibility of layering - I guess you saw those mostly with the monocular - and the observation of boulder tracks and the size of the Massif emphasizes the importance of sampling boulders that can be traced to sources at various elevations of the Massif. And I guess we should say that's hopefully. And we'll just have to see what happens when we get down to Station 2 on that. But, if we see boulders with tracks, I'm sure you guys remember, that they obviously will have a higher priority. Since we didn't get to Emory, and since we didn't really get to the rim of Steno itself, the question of sampling of the actual subfloor is still somewhat ambiguous although there is a large consensus opinion that says that we've sampled the subfloor when we sampled that intermediate Gabbro that we sampled yesterday at both the ALSEP and Station 1. The - there is a possible alternative conclusion which says that the subfloor has not been sampled, but that these blocks that we sampled and the surface are both parts of a later flow. And, in that line, we're still looking for specific observations which will help us distinguish between whether or not the dark mantle is a - whether the dark mantle is a separate unit from the intermediate gabbro that we're seeing or, whether it's the - Stand by.
1381735|CC|Okay. Whether or not the dark mantle is an entirely separate unit from the intermediate gabbro you were sampling yesterday or whether it just represents the top of very well churned up layer of a flow that was later than the subfloor - if you see what I'm saying there. All this says is that we're very interested, of course now - -
1381754|CDR|Roger, Bob.
1381756|CC|- All this says that, we're very much more interested in Station 5, as you might expect, than we were before. And I guess, for this reason, we'll be trying to keep the timeline a bit tighter than usual to guarantee that we've got some time left over at Station 5. And, we're also interested in moving perhaps - in perhaps moving Station 5 from its present location there in the southwest of Camelot over to the southeast or east or some location where we have a feeling that we've got big boulders up on the rim. This would be so we could sample, hopefully, some of the light material and some of the boulders together and get a better confirmation that the materials from deep in the subfloor unit is this intermediate gabbro, as opposed to just material from the upper part of the subfloor. It's just a matter of proving to ourselves whether or not the boulders we sampled yesterday are from deep within the subfloor, or only at the surface of the subfloor; or, perhaps, as I said, the other alternative being that the intermediate gabbro is part of the dark mantle, and we're seeing a churned-up regolith on top of it - sort of being the gaseous upper part of the flow having been broken down rather rapidly into the dark mantle. Okay, stand by a minute.
1381915|CC|Okay. To summarize that again, reading - I guess I got ahead of myself here in the little spiel they wrote up. At the present time we have two working hypotheses for the dark mantle, the gabbro - and the gabbro relationships to each other. One: the crystalline rocks that we found in the gabbro are an upper unit of the subfloor with their dark mantle cover unrelated to them in time. Key observations that they suggest here, are stratigraphy at Camelot, Station 5, and other steep craters. Especially, perhaps, the trench and sheltered spots which are unguarded - ungardened, as in plowed - for an older regolith underneath the dark mantle, if such a thing could be found. We don't think we found that yesterday. Or, look at the superposition relations between dark mantles and boulders are the mantles - instances of the mantle on the boulders or, inversely, of small boulders on the mantle?
1382007|CC|The second working hypothesis is that - is that the dark mantle is regolith derived from a vitreous, vesicular, flow tops of the crystalline rock flow beneath. And, it again goes to say that perhaps the re - gabbro that we sampled yesterday was indeed the late flow; and what the regolith was, was derived from the vitreous, vesicular flow tops as it were. Again, many of the same observations are called for. In particular, they'd be interested then in looking at the coarser fines as they define as from a millimeter to 20 millimeters, for some sort of transitional lithologies and textures. In other words, what do the small walnut-size rocks look like, if you can in hand specimens?
1382055|CC|If I can get more specific in terms of EVA mechanics, let me say that we'll call out in real-time the deletion of - of the tasks at Stations 3 and 4, if they become necessary. And what we're planning on doing is, deleting the trench in the base of the scarp at Station 3, and also, deleting the radial sample of the - on Shorty at Station 4. That's provisionally what we're planning on. And depending on how the time is going, we'll call that out real-time.
1382128|CC|We also have - The experiments remain pretty much the same: We'll deploy the charges at the same locations as we're planning in the checklist at the present time. We also don't - for your planning further ahead, we don't anticipate any significant changes in EVA-3. The charge number 5, which we were going to deploy at Emory, will not - but didn't, will not be deployed during EVA-2, but we'll deploy it on EVA-3 out at Station 10. And, what we're going to do there, is when you take the 8-pounder and put it between the seats, we'll then have the 3-pounder left over, and we'd like to put that on one of the footpads in the Sun - that's probably either the minus-Z or minus-Y footpad. And, we'll leave it there in the Sun until the start of EVA-3, in which case we'll put in the Rover underneath the LMP's seat. And, thermally, that looks okay.
1382222|CC|There is a probability that we're going to play the "return to the ALSEP" game, and we're going to do this for a couple of reasons. One, we're going to go back and look at getting some more ALSEP photos. I guess Gordy says you've got that. And, that will probably be at the end of EVA - in fact, it will certainly be, if it happens, at the end of EVA-3 when you go back to get the neutron flux probe. I might also say with regard to EVA-3 that, obviously, we're more interested in Station 10 than we were before. Another "return to the ALSEP" goodie that we're looking at - if we have the consumables today when you get back from finishing Station 5 - is that the Lunar Surface Gravimeter has been unable to level itself over the night, and they sent, you know, some thousand commands trying to get it straightened out, and they say it looks as though it's not level. And, so, we'd like Jack to go back with his practiced hand-on-bubble levels and recheck that at the end of - after Station 5 today, if there's sufficient consumables. And, we've planned for Gene to just let Jack off and let him walk back to the LM, after he gets off and looks at that.
1382332|CC|And, that's about everything we have. As I say, in summary, that the big changes are going to be extra time at the beginning, taking care of the fender extension, and the probability of extra time at the end. Although we'll have to see how well the fender works and how things go. The probability of extra time at the end to allow for dusting and the time spent on those particular activities we'll probably end up taken out of the tasks at Station 3 and Station 4. Over. Comments?
1382410|LMP|Okay, Bob. We copy all that. Obviously, you're going to have to catch us in real-time on some of the details there - on the charges and the task deletions. One question, did you say we were going to delete the trench at Station 3?
1382428|CC|Roger. The trench at the base of the Scarp, in other words, some of the stuff that you would be doing while Gene was taking the double core.
1382438|LMP|What do you gain by that?
1382441|CC|Well. No comment on that, Jack.
1382450|LMP|If you haven't deleted Gene's tasks, then what am I supposed to do?
1382455|CC|You're supposed to help Gene, I guess.
1382500|LMP|Well, but that's not the way we worked it, Bob. Let's play that one in real-time.
1382504|CC|Roger. That's why I said there's no point in marking up the checklist on that, Jack. Let me hit you with one more thing concerning the battery temps. An initial reaction down here is that the battery temps were high on deployment because of particularly unfavorable heat soaking on the way out. And the Marshall people are hopeful that they'll be back to normal this morning. However, we're obviously anxious, as I'm sure you are, to get an early reading on the battery temps - that's number 1. And number 2, just for the off chance that the meter's not working, I think we've pretty much discount that, because of the way the meter worked yesterday. But, on the off chance that the meter's not working, you might just lean over and see if the meter is reading zero before you punch in the circuit breakers, because that would give us at least a partial confirmation in that direction, that there's not something wrong with the offset. If they're reading - sitting there reading 30 to 40 degrees, then that probably says something about the offset. And, beyond that - -
1382600|LMP|Ya, that's ...
1382602|CC|Go ahead.
1382607|CDR|I'll look at that, Bob, what the meter has indicated in terms of a temperature change. I'll look and see if there's a bias on them at all.
1382613|CC|Roger. We - we again also think that that's probably not too likely.
1382626|LMP|Bob, I think, based on what I saw yesterday, that the chances are pretty good that all the big blocks out here in the dark mantle area will be pretty much the gabbros. By the way, I looked at that with a hand lens last night, and I don't know that you got the report, and I'm back to saying that it's probably closer to 30 - 40 percent plagioclase. It's very - it's a good gabbro, a final pyroxene gabbro, and it apparently has a fair amount of ilmenite in it. There's some bright shiny flakes within the vugs and some dark minerals in the matrix that are probably ilmenite. And one other additional possibility then, is that the mantling we're seeing here, is the - is just dark fine glass - darker than usual, because of the iron and the titanium in the rock itself. Also, the probability, I think, still has to be considered, that you're dealing with a true mantle that has been gardened enough that at least where we're seeing it now, in the first few tenths of a centimeter that it is unrecognizable as a mantling unit yet. The relationship to the large boulders is, I think, one right now, of just filleting and a small amount of covering because of the local gardening process. We haven't seen any clearly mantling relationships between the dark mantle or the surface materials here and the large boulders.
1382818|CC|Okay. Copy that. And, we'll be anxious to see what else you find out today. And one last word for your interest; the Marshall people have decided to allow us to go to 140 degrees on this EVA with the batteries, if necessary.
1382836|CDR|Okay.
1382837|CC|Okay, now. John would like to talk to you about the fender fix.
1382844|LMP|Okay. Hold on for 30 seconds.
1382923|CDR|Hey, while John's talking to me, why don't you check my biopad out. We're going left.
1382929|CC|Okay, fine. We'll take a check, Geno. Let me ask you one question here on the - on Jack's water - on his PLSS water cell. We're showing about 3 pounds too much water in the LM system, and we're wondering if you got the AUX tanks filled up in Jack's PLSS. Two questions. Did you - were you sure to have the AUX valve open and did you see good clear water in the sight gage with no bubbles after the fill? Over.
1383010|LMP|I guess we'd have to say yes to those questions, but if you've got a question on it we can go through it again. I'd rather do that than take a chance.
1383019|CC|Let me make sure we want to do that. While we're making sure, I checked with both homefronts and Nassau Bay and Tucson are both in good shape. Geno, Tracy upstaged you for about 30 minutes last night on local TV during her own interview there and drew everybody away from watching EVA during that time. She did very well.
1383047|CDR|Yes, that sort of - that sort of figures. Key, Gordo, why do you say Jack's PLSS? Did you see the water drop in the LM when we charged mine?
1383058|CC|It was the profile of the water quantity as you were filling both PLSS's, and it was the fill - during Jack's fill that looked suspicious like just maybe 3 pounds less than there should have been flow when you were filling Jack's.
1383119|CDR|Yes, well, you know there - it's all - it's only ... to know whether or not you've got it filled. I sure don't want to go out there and have him just have some partial water. So let's do the conservative thing.
1383131|CC|Okay. I'll - I'll verify that. There was some drinking water going - going out at that time, too, which muddles up the data a little bit, so we're not absolutely certain on that.
1383146|LMP|Okay. We weren't drinking water while we were filling the PLSS, however.
1383152|CDR|Okay. You come up with what you think best on that, and I going to copy John.
1383157|CC|Okay, Geno, I don't think you need to copy this. Sort of just - ad-lib it. With your four chronopaque maps, tape two maps and allow about a 1-inch overlap to a 15-inch by 10-1/2-inch configuration. That's an estimate. And then repeat with two other maps, and then tape both the two maps - now four maps - tape them together, and you'll end up with a sheet that's about 15 inches by 19 inches, a sheet of chronopaque. And then tape both sides of it - the overlapping edges to strengthen it. And you can further strengthen it, if you tape an "X" of tape across both sides of it. And then, on the roll up, on the long axis, and secure it with a strip of tape and put it in the ETB. And on that strip of tape you secure it with - be sure and leave a tab on the end of it so you can get it off with your gloves. And then remove clamps from both the utility light units, and open the clamp jaws to max. And then tighten the mounting bracket that you've got on it so it won't be swinging around; and stow the clamps in the ETB, You got that, Gene?
1383338|CDR|Yes, sir.
1383340|CC|Okay. And then - now you've got everything you need. And it's all put together and all ready to - to be fastened to the - to the Rover. And then when you get the ETB in the seat, you unroll the chronopaque sheet and you locate the front edge with the long axis fore and aft, even with - even with the axle. And you lay the edge of the sheet over the inboard guide rail and you clamp it. And you lay the other edge of the sheet over the outboard guide rail and clamp it. And, as I said, the inboard clamp must be directly over the axle to avoid interference while steering. And tighten the clamps securely, both of them. And then while you're driving around out there by yourself, it would be good if Jack could take a look at it and see if you're getting any unusual dynamics. And at Station 2, you should inspect the fender for any unusual wear that might have been caused by this mass out there on the fender, of those clamps bouncing up and down. One thing about it, doing it in a suit, Gene, you have to push in with your leg and hold - and it's sort of a two-handed job. And I'm not sure in 1/6 g if you can position the fender, the pseudofender, on there without Jack, say, holding on to the long end behind the Rover so that won't - won't fall off. It works okay in one g for one man. But I'm not sure it's not a 2-g proposition - a two-man proposition in 1/6. Over.
1383529|CDR|Okay. We'll take a look at it, babe.
1383531|CC|Okay, and you really have to bear down to get those - -
1383534|CDR|I just - -
1383535|CC|- - things on a dovetail there.
1383539|CDR|I just want to make sure of the geometry now. We want to put the - take two of those pages and put the 10-inch sides together overlapping, right?
1383552|CC|Yes, sir.
1383556|CDR|Then take two more and put the 10-inch sides together overlapping, right?
1383559|CC|That's true.
1383603|CDR|And then take those two pieces you've got now and put them end to end, so you've got the long - a long fender. Sounds right to me. Sound right to you?
1383616|CC|Well, you end up with - you end up with four - you end up with all four pieces in a big rectangle. See what I'm - you see what I'm saying, you've got a 15-inch by 19-inch sheet of paper.
1383639|CDR|Yes, we got it - we got it, John. And I copy the overlap and everything. If you had no overlap, I guess you'd have about 16 by 20.
1383647|CC|That's correct. But you need to overlap, and taping both sides of it gives it more strength, which you need in that situation. You just want to make sure it's not more than an inch, or you won't have enough to cover up those dovetails.
1383713|CDR|Okay, babe, we're going to work on it right now.
1383725|CC|Jack and Gene, this is Gordo again. On the PLSS charge, we're recommending you hook up Jack's according to the decal. Go right ahead and - stand by 1. Okay. Go by the decal and do the full 5-minute fill on Jack's PLSS. It'll take that long to get the AUX tanks filled up, if it was indeed empty. And maybe that's something you can start and then work on the - the paper taping. Over.
1383807|CDR|Okay.
1384030|LMP|Okay, Gordy. I started - I'm on step 4 on the decal - step 5 on the decal.
1384037|CC|Okay, Jack. John Covington advises that the sight gage is not a certain indicator that you're filled, and so we're just going to go by time to be sure, and kind of disregard the sight gage readings as a positive indication anyway.
1384100|LMP|Okay, understand that from the past, and we went exactly by time before. We'll try it again here.
1384106|CC|Okay.
1384540|CDR|Okay, Gordy. is that about 5 minutes?
1384546|CC|Stand by. See if anybody timed you here. That's affirm; 5 minutes now.
1384640|LMP|Okay. Step 7 is complete.
1384646|CC|Okay. And we did not see any water flow to speak of, so it probably was full.
1384659|LMP|Yes, the condensate indications here were that it was full.
1384704|CC|Okay that's - better to be sure.
1384712|LMP|No question.
1384938|CC|Geno, this is Houston - we want to be sure to have one look at your BIOMED before you get into the suit in case something is wrong with it. And if you go right by the checklist, we'll miss that look. So when you get to a convenient point, if you can go to LEFT and have us take a look at it, we'd appreciate it.
1385001|CDR|Gordy, apparently you - Okay. Stand by. I called it out. I didn't give it to you. Stand by one.
1385027|CDR|Okay. Now it's yours.
1385029|CC|Okay.
1385045|CC|Okay. That looks good, Geno. You can press on with the suiting operation, there.
1385053|CDR|Okay.
1385106|CDR|Call me the little old fender maker.
1385111|CC|Roger.
1385200|CDR|S-BAND VOICE going to VOICE.
1385204|CC|Roger.
1385847|CC|Jack, Houston. With respect to the PLSS water fill, last thing we heard you say was doing step 7. We just want to verify that you did go ahead and do step 8, which is connect the waste management system to the PLSS AUX vent for 10 seconds. Over.
1385904|LMP|Yes, that was all done, Gordy. We just got sidetracked, and I didn't call you.
1385908|CC|Okay, Thank you.
1385957|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 138 hours 59 minutes. America is in it's 26th revolution over the Ocean of Storms now. All going well with Ron Evans. The lunar sounder experiment being performed and Ron taking a lot of pictures.
1390248|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Bob Overmeyer is the America CAPCOM. Stu Roosa is sitting there with him. Bob Parker will be the Challenger CAPCOM for the EVA. Gordon Fullerton has stayed over a little from his shift, getting ready to leave now, and John Young is at the CAPCOM console also. Chuck Lewis is the Flight Director for America. Pete Frank the Flight Director for Challenger.
1392008|CDR|Okay, Gordy, Jack's coming up and I'm going off the air.
1392016|LMP|Okay, Gordy. LMP is suited, and - stand by. 24128. PRD is 24128.
1392044|LMP|Hello, Houston. Did you copy the LMP?
1392050|CC|Roger. Copy. 24128.
1392058|CC|How come you guys aren't on "flight director" like I am?
1392122|CDR|And, Bob, 17040 is Commander.
1392126|CC|Say that again please, Geno.
1392132|CDR|The last two digits are 40.
1392136|CC|Copy that.
1392140|CDR|17040 --
1392140|CC|Thank you. Thank you.
1392150|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We estimate that Challenger's crew is about 1 hour and 20 minutes behind the Flight Plan timeline.
1392542|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Brigadier General Tom Stafford and Colonel Charlie Duke have joined a half dozen or so other astronauts at the CAPCOM console.
1392901|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 139 hours 29 minutes. We've had loss of signal on America. As the spacecraft has gone behind the Moon on it's 26th revolution.
1393056|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 139 hours 30 minutes. America's orbit now 69.8 by 53.4 nautical miles. We'll reacquire America in 42 minutes.
1393140|LMP|Bob, how do you read the BIOMED on the LMP?
1393143|CC|Stand by, Jack. It looks beautiful, Jack. I think that means loud and clear.
1393201|CC|And, Challenger, have you changed your ECS LiOH can?
1393220|LMP|Bob, we did not. I guess we missed that in the checklist.
1393224|CC|Okay. That's sort of towards the end of 3-9.
1393259|LMP|Bob, I guess we're not quite there yet.
1393305|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1393916|CDR|Okay, Bob. The canister's changed.
1393918|CC|Roger. We saw that. Thank you.
1394025|LMP|Okay. BIOMED's LEFT.
1394028|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1394030|CDR|Bob, how do you read me?
1394032|CC|Loud and clear, Geno.
1394036|CDR|Okay.
1394036|LMP|Bat - battery management going.
1394039|CC|Roger.
1394045|LMP|37.2, both batteries.
1394048|CC|Okay, Jack. Just like always.
1394052|LMP|P - PCM is HIGH.
1394104|CDR|Is he ready for the batteries?
1394107|CC|Stand by. We're still picking up - trying to acquire the HIGH BIT RATE.
1394141|CC|Okay. And, Geno, we have good data from you on the Surgeon. And we have HIGH BIT RATE.
1394151|CDR|Well, that's good to hear. I got good data up here.
1394217|CC|Yes, we're GO to do the battery management now, Jack. Pick up the HIGH BIT RATE.
1394227|LMP|Roger.
1394233|CC|And a thought for the day. We're not sure if there is going to be any need for the scissors outside today. And if you guys wanted to keep from picking them up off the ground and worrying about them, you might just leave them inside if you haven't packed them already.
1394247|CDR|Bob, you never know. We're going to take them out with us. So just make a note that we bring them back in, would you?
1394252|CC|Okay. I'll make a little note again.
1394257|LMP|Okay. Battery's complete, and your cue on the LOW BIT RATE.
1394304|CC|Okay. You can go LOW BIT RATE again. We've looked to us too.
1394450|LMP|LMP is 6 - 6100 on the OPS.

1394513|CC|And you guys got the word about which purge valves to use?
1394522|LMP|That's affirm.
1394547|CDR|CDR's OPS is GO.
1394550|LMP|LMP - LMP is GO.
1394552|CC|Okay. Copy that. Good.
1395244|LMP|Okay. Bob, the forward hatch is unlocked.
1395248|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1395752|LMP|Bob, the LMP has his OPS on. And, would you believe the PLSS?
1395800|CC|Say again there, Jack.
1395806|LMP|The LMP's PLSS is on.
1395809|CC|Okay. Good enough. And I bet the CDR is doing his now.
1395817|LMP|You're right.
1400426|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 140 hours 4 minutes.

1400751|LMP|A.
1400752|CDR|Okay. You'll get a tone, a vent flag, a press flag, and an O2 flag.
1400756|LMP|Press flag, tone, vent flag.
1400758|CDR|Okay. Give Houston a call, and give them your - your oxygen reading.
1400805|LMP|Okay, Houston. This is the LMP with 93 percent, 93 perc -
1400811|CC|Okay, Jack. We read you loud and garbled just like last night when the antenna was stowed.
1400818|LMP|Okay. And 93 percent.
1400821|CC|Copy the 93 percent.
1400824|CDR|Okay, Houston. You got 93? Okay. He got that, Jack. Okay. We'll leave the antenna in. Okay. On mine, I'm going to OPEN my AUDIO, and connect to the comm, Jack.
1400835|LMP|Okay.
1400928|LMP|Okay, Houston. ... on ECS. Cabin pressure may be high. I picked out a little pumping in the ECS system - in the hoses.
1400951|CC|Roger. Stand by on that.
1400954|CC|Okay, Challenger. We're seeing it at the WATER SEPARATOR.
1401001|CDR|Yes, we can see that.
1401002|CC|You can pull the WATER SEPARATOR circuit breaker - -
1401004|CDR|You don't have a bleed on yours. Hit your - hit your disconnect.
1401010|LMP|Okay.
1401013|CDR|Okay. That's better.
1401014|LMP|That should do her. I think we've fixed it. I had the hoses in my storage box.
1401024|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1401027|LMP|What was the press ...?
1401029|CDR|Let me give them. Houston, CDR is reading - 90 - 91 percent.
1401038|CC|Okay. Copy 91.
1401046|CDR|Did they get that, Jack?
1401047|LMP|Yes, they got it.
1401048|CDR|Okay. LMP comm check - okay. You did them?

1401122|LMP|Yes, and I got mine, too.
1401125|CDR|You got an O flag and a vent flag, press flag and a - -
1401127|LMP|That's affirm.
1401129|CDR|Okay. Houston, how do you read CDR?
1401131|CC|Loud and clear, CDR.
1401136|LMP|And how do you read the LMP?
1401138|CC|Loud and clear.
1401141|CC|Okay. And we have - -

1401303|LMP|Oh, here it is, now. MASTER ALARM and ECS light; WATER SEP light.
1401318|CDR|Okay. It is locked, ... is on.
1401323|LMP|Okay.
1401324|CDR|Now, you want 211, right?
1401327|LMP|Roger. 211.
1401328|CDR|Okay. Bob, LMP is getting purge 211.
1401333|LMP|And out to the side - there you go.
1401335|CC|Okay. We copy that. Thank you.
1401343|CDR|Here, I'll lock it. Okay. And you are LOW and you are in and you are locked.
1401349|CDR|Okay. Purge valve is in. And you're vertical.
1401352|LMP|Okay. You get to do the same. Okay, get my hose?
1401358|CDR|Water hose.
1401359|LMP|Come around behind my shoulder.
1401402|CDR|It won't fit in there.
1401411|CDR|Okay, it's in there and it's locked, vented, and the dust cover is on.
1401419|LMP|Okay.
1401421|CDR|And now, we get to put your PURGE, in 208.
1401424|LMP|Make sure it's in LOW.
1401426|CDR|It is, and LOW, and the pin is in. Okay. And you'd like it where? Down a little bit?
1401434|LMP|No. Same place just - no, let me show you.
1401443|CDR|Right there?
1401444|LMP|Yes.

1401457|LMP|Okay.
1401457|CDR|Okay. That's good.
1401458|LMP|Let's get another zap of water here.
1401523|CDR|If I have any more water I'll float out there.
1401525|CDR|(Laughter)
1401526|CDR|Good Navy man.
1401529|LMP|Be a good place to fill with water, you'd make a nice rec site out of this valley. You could put some cabins up on the side of the massif. Nice flat bottom, no trees. Both mags up. The fishing ought to be pretty good if you stocked it.
1401550|CDR|Have a bear island and a family island.
1401552|LMP|(Laughter)
1401555|LMP|We're going to fill up the other end though, so it doesn't drain out.
1401600|CDR|Looks funny like that.
1401601|LMP|Lock it and turn your DESCENT WATER OFF.
1401613|CDR|Snaps, snaps, snaps, snaps; the whole world is held together with snaps!
1401619|LMP|Okay, I've got my hand lube. You can position your mikes.
1401622|CDR|Water is going off.
1401623|LMP|Okay.
1401626|LMP|Fasten your mikes now, before we turn the fans on you'd better -
1401630|LMP|Well let's just look ahead; we've got helmets ready to go - big bag position you happy with.

1401638|LMP|Make sure you've got the plug out.
1401641|CDR|Okay. Plug is out. My end's red now, but that's all you can get it out.
1401647|CDR|Feel a little pressure in there. You might let out.
1401652|LMP|Okay. And then we'll lower our protective visor and secure tool harness and self doff straps.
1401659|CDR|Okay, and that's ...
1401700|LMP|That's already stowed. Okay. Let's start with you first. You can turn your - let me get your ... then you can get it over your head and turn your O2 - your fan on rather.
1401710|CDR|Okay.
1401718|LMP|Okay, you ready?
1401724|CDR|Okay, check all that -
1401726|LMP|Wait what is this right here? Okay, now let me make sure it's in front of everything.
1401736|CDR|Okay.
1401739|LMP|The alignment is way over here.
1401740|LMP|Let me -
1401741|CDR|That's good. Okay. That's aligned right there.
1401745|LMP|Oh, boy.
1401748|CDR|That will never do. With that down in there. Okay. You're still clear. Starting.
1401806|CDR|Manischewitz.
1401815|LMP|I think it's caught on the food stick. I think you ought to open it up.
1401819|CDR|I think you're right.
1401821|CDR|Okay. Get it all the way off.
1401824|LMP|Okay. Now let's try it. Looks like it's going to be much better. Getting it back.
1401840|LMP|Just want to make sure that thing is on.
1401844|LMP|No, not happy yet. Not happy yet.
1401900|LMP|Guess what now. I tell you, I got my fingers on it all the way around.
1401912|CDR|Okay. Okay. It's locked. It's aligned. Better put your fan on here pretty quick.
1401920|CDR|Okay. Fan's on.
1401922|CDR|Okay, let me get you dressed up back here. If that center doesn't work, you're going to keep this thing -
1401929|LMP|And I'm vertical.
1401933|CDR|You are vertical alright. Okay. You're covered down there. You are locked. Okay - whoo! Okay?
1401952|LMP|This is my turn.
1402001|CDR|Let's verify all these things.
1402004|LMP|Okay. Go ahead.
1402005|CDR|Okay. Got your comm. That's you OPS, that's your inlet, that's your oxygen or your exhaust and your purge valve.
1402018|LMP|Okay.
1402019|CDR|And your water.
1402019|LMP|Okay, let me take a look at all yours. Okay. That's locked - locked, that's locked, you're vertical. That's locked. That's locked. That's locked. Okay. Get my helmet on. The main thing is to get this stuff back over here.
1402049|CDR|Yes.

1402113|CDR|Okay.
1402128|CDR|Got it. You're locked.
1402131|LMP|Feels good in the back?
1402132|CDR|Yes. And it's locked.
1402142|LMP|It's hard to see with that visor on there.
1402148|CDR|Okay. That's latched down. You're locked again.

1402242|LMP|Okay.
1402243|LMP|You want me over here?
1402244|LMP|Let me turn the page. Don our EV gloves.
1402249|CDR|Okay. In work.
1402303|CC|Geno, we don't see your fan on. If you've got your helmet on, you ought to have your fan on.
1402310|CDR|Thank you, Bob. Good call. The royal MOCR "we". Boy, grease and lunar dust really make a nice mobile graphite material.
1402401|LMP|Okay. I'm locked on the right, verified. The old gauntlet's coming on. Okay, and I've got my cover on over here. Get yours?
1402420|CDR|Yes, I'm getting one of them anyway.

1402553|CDR|No, mine's all on. I can't figure that out. Must be easier in 1/6 g.
1402559|CDR|(Laughter)

1402617|LMP|Okay. Where did we leave off?
1402619|CDR|Right up here.
1402620|LMP|Okay, PGA is not biting, LCG's cold, let's leave it cold.
1402624|CDR|Well, I guess you've got to open it now. We've got to disconnect the water.
1402627|LMP|You ready?
1402629|CDR|Yes.
1402630|LMP|Let's do it then. (Laughter)
1402635|LMP|Okay. It's disconnected.
1402636|CDR|Okay, and did you disconnect your -
1402638|LMP|Let me come around - okay, let's turn around and let's help each other. Let's get the -
1402643|CDR|It's still 3 degrees. Pitch up 5 degrees.
1402647|LMP|Pitch up yours - its an awful nuisance, Cernan.
1402649|CDR|Hold that for a minute.
1402650|LMP|I don't know why you don't learn how to land one of these things.
1402654|CDR|Hold that for a minute - it was a pitching deck. Okay, that is in. Boy, it's in. Locked - took a lot to "in" it, though.
1402711|LMP|Okay. Dust cover is covering it.
1402715|CDR|Okay. You know those chamber runs we had were probably some of the best training we ever did. I hate to say that, because it was some work. Push that thing on. There you go. Good. Keep trying. It was just a little sluggish. Let me verify it.
1402747|LMP|Lock?
1402751|CDR|Yes, won't turn.
1402752|CDR|Oh, every time you do that, my stomach gurgles. (Laughter) Okay, let me turn around to stow.
1402801|LMP|You can stow that? And mine's over here.
1402808|CDR|Okay. Okay. Attach our PLSS water hoses. PLSS diverter valve, MIN. Want to verify that?
1402821|PAO|We estimate the crew may be ready for depressurization in approximately 5 minutes.
1402828|LMP|And, connect PLSS water hose, verify lock, PLSS diverter valve MIN, and PLSS pump. Okay?
1402837|CDR|Wait a minute. I want to make sure this is out of the way when I come in.
1402904|LMP|Okay. Watch my diverter MIN.
1402908|CDR|Watch your diverter -
1402910|CDR|It's MIN.
1402910|LMP|It's MIN? Your pump's on and PRESS REGs A and B egress.
1402916|CDR|Okay. Pump's on.
1402920|LMP|Man, I'm getting a little bite ...
1402921|CDR|Okay. The next thing is to turn your PLSS O2 on, anyway.
1402925|LMP|Oh, okay.
1402926|CDR|Then we go to egress.
1402928|LMP|Egress.
1402929|CDR|Egress on the REGs.
1402930|LMP|The REGs are egress.
1402931|CDR|Okay. You ready on my mark.
1402933|LMP|Wait a minute.
1402934|CDR|Tell me when you're ready.

1403017|LMP|Do you need me to watch the panel or you got it?
1403019|CDR|No, no sweat I've got that.
1403021|LMP|Okay.
1403022|CDR|We'll have to get the PLSS O2 OFF. I'll get mine; I can reach yours real easy. I can get it in a minute. As soon as we get up I'll get it. Yes, I can reach it, I think, now. And we're going up to HIGH PRESSURE here when we start dumping the cabin.
1403048|PAO|The EVA clock will start when the cabin pressure reaches three and a half pounds.
1403107|CDR|I've gone through 3.5 now - 3.4 really.
1403111|LMP|Just off the peg here. My press flag didn't clear.
1403118|CDR|There's mine.
1403119|PAO|Crew is checking suit pressurization. They have not yet started depressing the cabin.
1403125|LMP|Turn mine off. Okay. Mark it. It's off.
1403134|LMP|Where are you?
1403136|CDR|At 385.

1403141|CDR|Okay. Mine's off.
1403142|LMP|Okay. Check your pressure.
1403144|CDR|38. I went at 20, you went at 30.
1403200|LMP|It looks like it's a little tighter.
1403203|CDR|That was the suit loop we were checking yesterday up in orbit, though.
1403207|LMP|Yes, but you know we got two tenths.
1403210|LMP|Yesterday, too, I did.
1403212|CDR|Okay, I'm coming down 20 more seconds, you got 30 more seconds.
1403217|CDR|I'm over about a tenth I guess.
1403231|CDR|Okay; 1 minute for me Houston; 8.5 to 7 - about 7.2.
1403239|CC|Copy that, Geno.
1403240|CDR|Okay. That it?

1403328|LMP|Okay, I'm over as far as I can get. I can turn around and give you more room.
1403331|CDR|Yeah, turn around and you'll have to look at the CABIN.
1403334|LMP|Watch yourself there. You went awful weak all of a sudden. Are you - Hello. How do you read?
1403341|CDR|Very weak. You better call again.
1403342|LMP|Very weak?
1403343|CDR|Okay. My volume got tang -

1403519|LMP|Okay. I believe it.
1403520|CDR|I get a tone and an H2O flag, and you should pop your RELIEF, I think.
1403525|PAO|Clock started at 140:34:49.
1403527|LMP|Yes, I'm at my relief pressure now.
1403540|CDR|What's CABIN now?
1403541|LMP|Cabin is one - a little 1.2. One.

1403718|CDR|Yes, I unlocked it earlier.
1403722|LMP|Still 0.2.
1403728|CDR|It's unlocked. It's on again.
1403739|PAO|America is over the landing site now.
1403744|CDR|Here it comes.
1403746|LMP|There goes all the junk out there again. Guess that's ice.
1403754|LMP|Yes.
1403754|CDR|Okay.
1403756|LMP|Probably cleaned some of the dust out, I hope.
1403758|CDR|Yes, there goes a lot of junk. Sure wish it would clean the dust out. But it isn't. It's cleaning everything else out.
1403803|LMP|Okay, Geno. We turn our PLSS water on.
1403808|CDR|Okay. We can get to it.

1404227|LMP|Tape recorder's off.
1404231|CDR|Big hook, that's a legacy of Gemini 9.
1404234|LMP|Mags.
1404242|LMP|EVA decals. ETB is hanging.
1404305|CDR|That all I need?
1404307|LMP|I think so. You hit your comm again.
1404313|CDR|No, I didn't; I'm okay.
1404315|LMP|What happened to the static? Did we lose Houston?
1404317|CC|We read you loud and clear.
1404319|LMP|Hello, Houston. Oh, you must have switched to - Oh, I don't know.
1404326|CDR|Okay. I'm going down the ladder.
1404328|LMP|All of a sudden, all the noise is gone; that's very good.
1404338|CDR|God speed the crew of Apollo 17. I think I'll read that every time I come down the ladder.
1404343|LMP|Okay. All the circuit breakers are verified. Noise is back. Okay -
1404351|CDR|Okay. My visor's coming down; utility lights are off. We're not going to use the camera?
1404401|LMP|Hey, I get to get out.
1404404|CDR|Okay, Houston. On this fine Tuesday evening, as I step out on the plains of Taurus-Littrow, Apollo 17 is ready to go to work.
1404417|CC|Roger, Geno. Good deal.
1404423|CDR|And the first thing I'll do is give you a TGE. Let me turn it on. And you want a reading. Okay. It's on. Bob, and the reading is 222, 262, 207; that's 222, 262, 207.
1404451|CC|Roger. We copy that, Gene.
1404459|CDR|Looks good from here, Jack. Keep coming. Come on, hatch. Oh, what a nice day. (Laughter) Funny, there's not a cloud in the sky. Except in the Earth. Take it nice and easy today and get accustomed. Whee!
1404523|LMP|Okay.
1404525|CDR|I'll be right there, Jack, to get the antenna, as soon as I turn the LCRU on.
1404530|LMP|Okay. I'm on the ladder. Door is closed.
1404541|CDR|Okay, POWER switch is INTERNAL. I'm in MODE 3. LCRU blankets are open 100 percent. AGC is 4.0 plus, and power is about 1/8. Sensors are about 1/6 or 1/4.
1404603|CC|Okay. And we have a good picture there, Geno. Thank you.
1404611|CDR|Already, huh?
1404612|CC|Already.
1404614|CDR|Well, let me just tweak you up a little bit. Okay, I've got you tweaked, right in the middle.
1404619|CC|Thank you. And, Gene, after you set both those - -
1404623|CDR|Okay.
1404624|CC|- - battery covers - up front there, why don't you go back and give us that temperature reading and then put the breakers in and then give us another temperature reading on the batteries.
1404633|CDR|Yes sir, I'll do that. Jack, here, let's get the antennas.
1404647|LMP|You want to get - you want to hang on the Rover?
1404649|CDR|I guess - well, okay.
1404650|LMP|I think it's easier.
1404654|CDR|Now, I'm below, so get mine, now. I'm in a hole.
1404713|LMP|Okay; you're up.
1404715|CDR|Okay,
1404739|CDR|... get down there yet. Got to secure the flaps. Okay, you're all right.
1404748|LMP|Okay, you're up.
1404748|CDR|Okay.
1404754|LMP|Okay, POWER switch is going to STANDBY. And the temperature is 80. And I'll close the blankets.
1404805|CC|Copy 80 on the SEP.
1404809|LMP|That's affirm. You know what happened? The Velcro came unbonded. That's why those don't hold down. We probably ought to get a piece of tape on those. Because they've got to set and it's going to get dusty. The blankets - there's no Velcro left to hold the SEP blankets down, Bob.
1404837|CC|Okay, I copy that, Jack.
1404842|LMP|Do you have a reading on the gravimeter?
1404844|CDR|Yes, I took a reading, Jack.
1404844|LMP|Okay.
1404844|CC|It's measuring right now, Jack, we'll get it later.
1404847|CDR|All right.
1404850|LMP|Okay. I hope I didn't hit it with some dust.
1404852|CDR|Hey, it is not regis - measuring, Bob - -
1404854|CC|Oh, that's right. Sorry about that.
1404856|CDR|- - All I did was take a reading. I turned it on and took a reading.
1404858|CC|Yes, you're right, you're right, and I'm wrong.
1404904|CDR|Okay, Bob.
1404906|LMP|Hey, Bob.
1404906|CDR|The battery temperatures are 0 and 0.
1404910|CC|Copy that. Okay.
1404914|LMP|Bob, there's your pendulum [?].
1404918|CC|Okay.
1404919|LMP|It's not a very good one. I'll work on that.
1404922|PAO|That's Jack Schmitt with the equipment transfer bag.
1404929|LMP|Are you going to be there for a minute, Gene?
1404931|CDR|Just putting these batteries in. I'm done on this. Oh, you'll be glad to hear this. We got 70 on battery 1 and about 92 on battery 2.
1404939|CC|Beautiful. Beautiful. 70 and 92. I copied.
1404945|LMP|Yes sir.
1404947|CDR|Let me just verify this Jack, and I'll be all done.
1404951|LMP|Okay. You've got it.
1404952|CDR|I'm all done.
1404953|LMP|Okay. Okay, here's your old fender.
1405004|CDR|Yes, I'll work on that shortly.
1405012|CDR|Well, I think I'm going to INTERMEDIATE cooling to start with here.
1405019|LMP|Okay. I think I will, too. Good idea.
1405021|CDR|One zap of cold to see If it's working. It's working, and back to INTERMEDIATE.
1405102|LMP|Okay. lots of mags.
1405120|LMP|Okay; mag.
1405126|CDR|I'll have the same problem with this SRC, I'll bet.
1405129|LMP|Mag Romeo is going to go on the - the old 500 in a minute. Mag India is in there. Mag Kilo, Mag Juliet, Mag Bravo, Mag Delta.
1405219|CDR|Okay, Bob, the SRC organic sample has been sealed. And the SRC lid is staying almost closed, about 2 or 3 inches open; if that's fine, I'd like to leave that.
1405234|CC|Okay. Go ahead and leave it, Gene. If it's not we'll get back with you on it.
1405237|CDR|Okay. I'm going to hit your gravimeter here.
1405245|LMP|Polarizing filter - -
1405249|CDR|Torque it - -
1405249|LMP|- - ... light clamps.
1405250|CDR|- - and the light is flashing.
1405252|CC|Copy that.
1405256|LMP|Scissors.
1405317|CC|Okay, and Jack you can - ready to take care of it - Sarge, remember EP4 goes within the rover seat and EP5 we're going to put on one of the footpads in the sun probably wither the minus Z or the minus Y footpad, whichever is more convenient probably the minus Z is. Just as long as it is sitting in the sun that's the important thing on a footpad.
1405341|LMP|Okay.
1405412|CDR|Boy, oh boy. Going to be a - Why won't that come out? Yes, Bob, I'm having a little trouble getting the LCRU battery out. I'll have to - I'll have to go back and use two hands.
1405446|CC|Okay. That sounds like a familiar problem.
1405452|CDR|Well, you got any familiar answers?
1405458|CC|Someone who's been there before says you just got to work it back and forth until it comes loose.
1405505|CDR|Okay. I can get that, Jack. I've got to - -
1405519|LMP|... hang it up?
1405520|CDR|Yes. I've got to work here anyway.
1405525|PAO|The explosive in those charges is hexonitrostilbein or HNS. It's a pliable, semi-solid.
1405602|LMP|Okay, Bob, it's on the minus-Z and the - One corner is facing directly into the Sun.
1405612|CC|Okay; copy that.
1405617|LMP|That was - that's EP-5.
1405619|CC|Roger that. And I copy number 4 was put - was put between the seats.
1405627|LMP|Yes, it's - a - yes, it's between the seat, or will be very soon.
1405631|CDR|Boy, this is ridiculous. Ridiculous.
1405638|LMP|Whoops, I need that other track.
1405649|CDR|Well, it's nothing worth getting upset about it, but it sure makes you start out - But, you shouldn't have to this way.
1405656|LMP|Come on, just don't wear your hands out now.
1405658|CDR|Yes.
1405659|CC|Hey, Geno - Geno - -
1405700|LMP|Need a little help?
1405700|CDR|No, I think I can do it, just got to wiggle - -
1405703|CC|- - jiggle it gently and sort of let it come free there. It's a matter of it wedging itself in, of course, on the parallel rails.
1405710|CDR|Yes. I - I see what's happening, Bob. Still ridiculous.
1405749|CC|Okay - -
1405750|LMP|Bob, did you hear my comment about the - about the SEP receiver?
1405758|CC|Roger. That the blankets won't stay closed. We're talking about that down here.
1405817|CDR|Boy; a bag of peanuts. Whew. Man in space. Without him we'd be lost.
1405831|LMP|Without them we wouldn't have the LCRU and the MESA probably.
1405836|CDR|(Laughter) Manischewitz. Okay. Let me see what I can do for you while I'm here. Okay. LCRU battery under seat, dustbrush to LCRU. Okay. I'll go get that; then I'll get to work.
1405905|LMP|Hey, Bob, what's my shadow length right now?
1405908|CC|Stand by. I'll ask. We'll get it for you momentarily.
1405929|CC|Okay, Jack. We've got 4.5 meters or 15 feet.
1405938|LMP|4.5 meters, huh? Hmm.
1405942|CDR|15 feet? is that how long I am on the ground? No wonder I've misjudged distance. Zap! Hello there, Houston.
1405959|CC|Hello there. Okay, Jack. And do we have the new charge transporter on the pallet?
1410016|LMP|I'll say yes, but you could have looked for yourself.
1410019|CC|Well, we just looked away.
1410022|CDR|Yes, it's here. It's here, Bob.
1410024|CC|Copy that. I won't ask if we got the LCRU battery. That one, I did see.
1410036|CDR|Yes, we got it.
1410037|LMP|You don't think I'd leave it here.
1410040|CDR|Okay, 7.
1410058|CDR|Boy, this gate's working like a charm.
1410129|CDR|Okay. Transfer from 5 to 7. Okay?
1410134|CC|Okay and - -
1410135|LMP|Okay. The pan's complete.
1410138|CC|Okay, Jack. Copy that.
1410141|LMP|And, Bob, those pans around here have more pictures because I'm having to be sure I get the massifs - I'm having to take extra pictures.
1410153|CC|Okay. Copy that. And I guess we'd suggest that, if you haven't talked about it already, that you work on the fender before you do the geo prep, so you don't have your cameras and bags to worry about at that point.
1410206|CDR|Okay. Would that be a good time for Jack to go to the ALSEP, do you think? Or do you think we both have to do this fender?
1410213|CC|No. The ALSEP work - we're not going to do until the end of the EVA.
1410214|CDR|I heard John's words.
1410219|CDR|Okay.
1410219|CC|And, Jack, if Gene's working there on unstowing SCB, whatever it is, 5 - yes, 5. Maybe when you put the camera down, you might want to shoot off a few 500-millimeter frames of the North and South Massifs, if they look interesting. I - I can't tell from the TV. That might be an opportune time to grab a couple.
1410240|LMP|If they look interesting! If they look interesting! Now what kind of thing is that to say?
1410300|CC|Then, when Gene gets done configuring that SCB-5, we'd like to get on with the fender fix. Then, we'll do the geo prep after that.
1410310|CDR|We'll get on with it, Bob.
1410319|PAO|SCB is Sample Collection Bag.
1410340|CDR|My god, we got a lot of loose stuff in SCB-7.
1410350|CDR|Okay, Bob. I got three core tubes - well, wait a minute - only got one core cap dispenser. Let me get the other one. Okay. Well, it's all on wide. Okay; three core tubes, two 20-bag dispensers, one ca - that's one core cap dispenser, and a short can.
1410417|CC|Okay. Copy that, Geno.
1410422|CDR|Jack - -
1410422|LMP|Yes.
1410423|CDR|- - Are you ready to work? See this right here?
1410424|LMP|Yes.
1410425|CDR|I'm going to put that right - there.
1410427|LMP|Okay.
1410431|LMP|Are you ready to work?
1410432|CDR|Just let me turn my page here. ... Stand by. Okay; I already got one on the gate. That didn't count.
1410506|CDR|Okay. Want a couple 20-bag dispensers?
1410511|LMP|Well, I - Okay, - waiting for you to -
1410515|CDR|Well, let's get this done.
1410517|LMP|You want to -
1410518|CDR|Here.
1410519|LMP|Well, what are you doing now?
1410520|CDR|I was just getting this gear out now ... to work on the fender.
1410523|LMP|Okay.
1410523|CDR|I'm not to geo prep yet.
1410525|LMP|Okay.
1410526|CDR|Here you are.
1410527|LMP|Wait a minute.
1410529|CDR|We'll just set these here.
1410532|LMP|And there's another one.
1410541|CDR|Okay; SCB-7 goes under your seat.
1410546|LMP|Okay. I'll get that. The camera has the - bags on it. You might - just put it there, and I'll come over and get those maps and everything.
1410603|CDR|Okay. That goes under your seat. Let me get 4 - Okay, we got 4 and 6. I'm going to start on a - We got SCB-4, goes to you, and SCB-6 goes on the gate yet Jack, but let's pick that up with geo prep, and let me get that fender gear. Where's the -
1410619|LMP|It's in your seat pan.
1410620|CDR|In my seat pan? Okay.
1410623|LMP|I should have put it over here. That was just where it ended up.
1410631|CDR|You already used the 500?
1410633|LMP|No, I didn't get a chance to.
1410634|CDR|Okay. You might do it while I try the fender, and then you're here to help me in case I need it.
1410639|LMP|No, it's all - all your stuff's right there, Gene.
1410641|CDR|Oh, okay. I see it. Well, let's hope it does the job.
1410732|LMP|Okay, SCB-7's in my seat. And I put the return-to-LM map in there, too; it's just going to be in the way anywhere else.
1410743|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1410752|LMP|Let me check something, though. On the way to the Hole-in-the-Wall, we want to drive ...
1410804|CC|... notch.
1410808|CDR|Okay. Hope this thing gets stiff. It's just a flapper. Sure isn't stiff like I want it to be.
1410823|LMP|You want me to hold it there?
1410824|CDR|Yes, you're going to have to, I reckon. But, that may do the job. Let's see, does it come over the - I want it about right above the axle - let me - move your hand a minute. Let me align it. Okay. Hold it right there. Let me get the -
1410839|LMP|Okay.
1410840|CDR|Let me move it up just a little bit. Right there. Okay. Hold it right there. Let me see how much room I've got coming out. I want to turn this around. We can tape that other end, Jack. There you go.
1410856|LMP|It's tending to fold a little bit -
1410857|CDR|I think - Yes, but the dust will be coming up from under us. Let's see.
1410903|LMP|Temperature; I think is making it fold.
1410905|CDR|How, that'll give us plenty of room down there, that - Yes, I just don't want to interfere with the steering.
1410911|LMP|You think - you think that'll stop the dust that way?
1410914|CDR|Well, it'll stop some of it if it stays on.
1410917|LMP|Well, what I mean, it's not projecting outward at all. It's curling back under.
1410921|CDR|Well, when I - when I put a clamp here, and a clamp here, see what will happen?
1410925|LMP|Oh, okay.
1410926|LMP|Is that about how - where you want it?
1410946|LMP|Lean against me, if you need to.
1410952|CDR|Trying to figure out - No, I've got to clamp it right in that rail; it's not much to clamp it on the inside.
1410958|LMP|No. Keep the knob up. There, you got it.
1411002|CDR|Hold it right there. We got it all folded up on this side?
1411004|LMP|Why don't you try the outside.
1411005|CDR|Let it go a minute. Okay.
1411007|LMP|Okay. Why don't you try the outside, first? Fix it -
1411010|CC|Inside first; probably be better, guys.
1411021|LMP|Got enough overlap there.
1411022|CDR|No, I want a little more.
1411024|LMP|Okay.
1411024|CDR|And, I am going to try this side because I can get my overlap over here.
1411034|PAO|As you can see, it's only a paper fender, but the Moon is real.
1411036|CDR|Okay. Wow, hold it right there while I clamp it down.
1411056|CDR|Well, that paper isn't going to come off, and the clamp's not going to come off, I'll say that. I don't know how much we're going to get out of the fender but -
1411105|LMP|Okay, that's fixed?
1411107|CDR|Yes.
1411109|LMP|Can you fix that at all?
1411113|CDR|Yes.
1411114|LMP|That ought to give us a little strengthening, stiffening.
1411117|CDR|Yes.
1411119|LMP|Pretty tight.
1411121|CDR|Yes. Tighter for the road. I don't want to lose that. Man, that's tight. Now, let's see if I can get this one. Jack, why don't you come on this side and hold the fender down right there. Hold it right about there.
1411158|LMP|Okay. You want to get it outboard a little more - I mean aft?
1411202|CDR|No, I want to keep it above this - this center - The - the hub here.
1411207|LMP|Yes, Okay.
1411208|CDR|For steering purposes. See this - -
1411210|LMP|Is that - is that fixed for the - well -
1411212|CDR|I'll take a look at it. I'm going to tighten it down so it stays, then I'm going to take a look at it. I might turn this thing down too.
1411218|LMP|Yes. I was just going to suggest that.
1411227|CDR|Let me take a look before I get it too tight. Well, I'll tell you, that's going to help some.
1411232|LMP|Yes. It may do the trick.
1411235|CDR|I can't see what's under this rail too well, but I know that clamp is on. It's on tight.
1411240|LMP|Gene, it looks -
1411242|CDR|Let me move this -
1411243|LMP|Move your left hand a little. Okay. Tighten that now.
1411247|CDR|Get this out of the way.
1411251|LMP|Looks as if -
1411255|CDR|Let me loosen it, and get it a little straighter.
1411255|LMP|Yes, I think you need to straighten it.
1411259|CDR|Well, I had it tight.
1411301|LMP|Well, but you know you've got another piece in there so -
1411304|CDR|Yes, that's why it's crooked, it's over those pieces.
1411305|LMP|Yes. Well, you might want to move it - if you could move it this way about a - an inch, you'd be past the ridge you got.
1411312|CDR|Well, I'm just taking John's word on the steering. I - I - -
1411315|LMP|Okay.
1411315|CDR|- - keeping above the hub here.
1411316|LMP|Okay, tighten her down then.
1411322|PAO|The crew's using maps to make that fender. The clamps are from the optical alignment telescope lamp.
1411333|LMP|I think that'll stay.
1411333|CDR|I think it'll stay.
1411339|LMP|Why don't I turn this one - -
1411339|CDR|Okay. You won't get that any tighter.
1411341|LMP|No, I mean, why don't I turn that down because it'll keep - that much less to run into. There you go.
1411350|CDR|No, not too close to that wheel.
1411354|LMP|Okay? I think that's good.
1411358|CDR|Too bad we don't have one more clamp - well, one more clamp would probably interfere with the steering.
1411404|LMP|I think that'll stop the rooster tail, because that' s - -
1411406|CDR|I think that'll stop a lot of it, Houston.
1411408|LMP|- - that's swinging forward. Okay. Let's go.
1411409|CC|Okay. It's - -
1411410|CDR|The maps are configured.
1411411|CC|- - That sounds like a good attempt, men. We'll hope it works.
1411415|CDR|Does that look - does that look good to John, from what he did?
1411420|CC|It looks exactly what his did, he says.
1411422|LMP|That tape will keep it -
1411426|CDR|Yes, but he didn't run in the dust, so I guess we'll have to give it a trial run.
1411429|CC|Roger on that.
1411430|CDR|That ought to help some - -
1411431|CC|We're anxiously waiting.
1411433|CDR|Okay, Jack. Let's - I'm going to HIGH for a little bit. Okay. I need S - S - oh, shoot. Now I want 4.
1411443|LMP|I took 8 off.
1411444|CDR|No, sir. I want 4 and 6. Why don't you just substitute - -
1411448|LMP|Hey, I just took 8 off. Can we use 8 instead of 6?
1411453|CDR|Yes, we can.
1411454|CC|Yes, I don't see there's any reason why you shouldn't be able to use that, Jack. Go ahead. We'll just mark it down.
1411459|CDR|Okay. Turn around, Jack. Hey, Bob, we'll use 8 instead of 4.
1411505|CC|Okay. Understand 8 will be on the - -
1411506|CDR|8 instead of 4.
1411507|CC|- - 8 will be on the LMP.
1411510|CDR|That's affirm; 8 will be on the LMP.
1411520|CC|Geno, you went to MIN instead of MAX.
1411525|CDR|I think you're right. I just realized that.
1411534|LMP|Got it?
1411536|CDR|Yes, let me go to MAX here for a minute.
1411540|CDR|We need 6 off of there, Jack.
1411543|LMP|Oh, your 5 stays back here, huh?
1411545|CDR|We need - we need - we need 6 to the gate.
1411550|LMP|It's probably behind 4, isn't it.
1411553|CDR|Well - -
1411553|CC|Well, put 4 on the gate - -
1411554|CDR|Yes.
1411554|LMP|Probably.
1411555|CC|- - then put 5 on the commander.
1411559|CDR|Yes. Okay, 4 is going on the gate and 5 on the commander.
1411603|LMP|Okay, Bob, a little paperwork for you, but that's all right. Okay.
1411611|CDR|Now, I got to do some more stowing on you when you get that on.
1411620|LMP|Okay.
1411624|CDR|They're in the -
1411631|LMP|Where do you want me?
1411633|CDR|Your left side.
1411636|LMP|I mean where do you - which way are you going to turn?
1411645|CDR|Oh, man, does that - that Velcro get tough.
1411702|LMP|Here you've got a core cap dispenser.
1411705|CDR|Stand by; let me fix these for you while I'm here. Okay. Here's your doffing harness on this side. Don't move yet, I've got to - I've got something I've got to do to you.
1411717|LMP|Okay.
1411720|CDR|Okay, okay. Turn around, I'll get your harness on the other side.
1411729|LMP|Let me get yours too.
1411730|CDR|Okay. Okay, there you go. Okay, you've got a cap dispenser, you've got a rammer, and you've got - well, I guess SCB-8, if I'm not mistaken.
1411742|LMP|Yes, that's all right, they got it. Okay. That's 1.
1411749|CDR|Okay. You can give me SCB-5 then, and -
1411754|LMP|Yes. Can you move - move a little bit? There you go. Okay. There you are.
1411824|CDR|You got it?
1411825|LMP|No - no, I'm sorry. In fact, I've got to tighten up your -
1411833|CDR|We've got to take a picture of that fender if it works.
1411836|LMP|Wait a minute - No, if you weren't so tall - and you - you are always saying - you just invariably stand so I have to get in a hole. Okay. Now let me tighten up your whole shooting match here. It's loose again. Hang on. Okay. Between Velcro and snaps, the world could never fall apart.
1411910|CDR|Okay, all set?
1411911|LMP|You're set.
1411912|CDR|Okay. I'm going to get a hammer, and then I'll get the TGE.
1411916|LMP|I'm going to get my camera, and I'll go to the SEP site.
1411919|CC|Okay. Why don't you start to the SEP site - -
1411920|CDR|Hey, Jack, when you start running I'll - -
1411921|CC|- - and, also, I presume that the dustbrush is on the Rover now.
1411928|CDR|It is.
1411929|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1411930|CDR|It is. Jack, when I drive out there why don't you watch the rear wheel.
1411935|LMP|I will. Give me a yell when you start to drive.
1411937|CDR|Okay. Both the steering and the rooster tail - Oh, I hope it's not all zeros. Okay, Bob. 670, 017, 701; 670, 017, 701.
1411958|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1412005|CDR|Okay; and the SCB is good. It's closed. It's in the shade. The rest ... I guess.
1412016|CC|Okay. And, Jack, when you get out to the SEP site, you might give us a reading on what the solar panels look like - how they survived the night with the tape on them.
1412029|LMP|I wouldn't think of not doing that. I'm curious myself.
1412043|CDR|Okay. The TGE is on the LRV.
1412048|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1412048|CDR|Okay. I'm making an inventory. I've got the LCRU battery. Okay. We got 1, 3 and 2 and 8; LCRU blankets are open 100 percent. Battery covers are CLOSED. Dustbrush is on the LCRU. TGE is on the Rover. Jack, can you verify we got the right mags and a polar filter? Polarization.
1412111|LMP|Yes sir. I verified that.
1412112|CDR|Okay. Very good.
1412113|LMP|You better put that 500 back under the seat.
1412115|CDR|Yes. That's where it's going.
1412118|LMP|Well, Bob, it looks like - it survived. There is a - as I stand behind the panels - the left-hand panel may be tilted at about - well, less than 5 degrees, probably about 2 or 3, but that's all. Looks pretty good right now.
1412138|CC|Okay; beautiful. Thank you. Good fix.
1412143|LMP|Okay.
1412144|CDR|Okay, Bob, I'm going to take the TV from you.
1412146|CC|Okay. Copy that, Geno.
1412147|LMP|And the transmitter's going on.
1412150|CC|Copy that, Jack.
1412151|LMP|(Laughter) If I can do it without destroying it.
1412155|CDR|Yes. That's hard to do out there, Jack. Okay. TV camera going POSITION 1.
1412203|LMP|Transmitter's on and -
1412208|PAO|We'll loose the TV while Gene Cernan drives the rover to the surface electrical property site.
1412208|LMP|... fix the level there. Okay. The level is on the inner ring again. And - well, the gnomon has moved a little bit, but not much. But you would expect that, I guess.
1412223|CC|Yes. Seeing the other end of the gnomon up there in the sky it's moved a little bit.
1412230|LMP|Yes. That's what I said.
1412233|CDR|Okay. Camera, tongs, and I'll drive. West leg, heading 270.
1412244|PAO|That site is 100 meters east of the lunar module - Jack Schmitt has just walked out there and turned on the SEP transmitter.
1412248|LMP|Camera is on. Bob, I'm on. I guess 26.
1412304|CC|Okay. Copy - -
1412305|CDR|This here's frame 27, mag Charlie.
1412307|CC|Copy that. Charlie 26 - 27.
1412313|LMP|I had to relearn how to document samples, Bob. I just have. The first part of my roll will have a lot of random exposures and focuses.
1412326|LMP|Okay. We're back in business. And I'm - while I'm waiting for Gene, getting a rock - it looks a little finer grained than the others we've seen in the LRV sampler, along with some soil. And that's done. Man, that's a neat sampler. Only way to fly. Okay, and that's in bag 22E. It has the stereo documentation and a locator to the LM, and it's about 2 meters from the S - from the SEP.
1412407|CC|Okay, Jack.
1412408|LMP|22 Echo.
1412410|CC|Roger. Copy that. Did you ever find any sign of that brown fine-grained rock you saw on the way out to the SEP yesterday?
1412417|CDR|Bob, let me give you some readings, so I can get going.
1412419|CC|Okay. Go ahead, Geno.
1412420|CDR|Okay. Amp hours, 108, 100; volts are 68, 68; batteries are 80 and 102; and motors are all off scale low. I'm on the way. On the way, Jack.
1412447|LMP|I'm waiting.
1412448|CDR|Oh, there you are over there, huh?
1412503|CC|And, Jack, how's the rooster tail look on that fender?
1412509|LMP|Looks like it's going backwards. I don't see any coming up over the top. Looks like a good fix.
1412516|CC|Beautiful.
1412524|CDR|Okay, Jack, I got to come around - I'm going to come on this side and head west.
1412530|LMP|Okay. Watch for - You got the antennas?
1412532|CDR|I've got one over here.
1412535|LMP|Okay. I'll - give you a line on the other one.
1412548|PAO|That rooster tail is a cloud of dust that the Rover's rear wheel throws up.
1412555|CDR|Okay. I'm getting close.
1412559|LMP|Okay. Turn.
1412602|CDR|Where is it?
1412603|LMP|Right here. I'm on it.
1412613|CDR|Okay. Okay. And I see the other one - let me parallel that line.
1412623|CC|Low gain, Gene, please; after you get stopped.
1412633|CDR|I guess that's about 2 or 3 meters, huh, Jack? You can better see where it - is at.
1412637|LMP|Yes, that's good, Geno.
1412640|CDR|Okay. Heading 270.
1412643|LMP|You want to - -
1412643|CDR|Am I 10 meters from the transmitter?
1412646|LMP|Probably not, huh? You're pretty - no, you need to go about 5 meters.
1412653|CDR|How far am I? See if it's okay.
1412654|LMP|You're about 3 meters - 4 meters.
1412657|CDR|Hey, Bob, I'm 3 meters to the west of the transmitter and about 2-1/2 meters south of the line going west - -
1412705|CC|There's no problem there, Gene.
1412706|CDR|- - is that okay?
1412706|CC|Don't move. It's just they had to be less than those numbers.
1412711|CDR|Okay. That's where I am.
1412714|LMP|I'm getting your photos.
1412716|CDR|Okay; and let me give them a voltage reading, and I'm still reading 68 and 68.
1412721|CC|Okay; copy that. We don't need those, we just got them. And - -
1412727|CDR|I know, I just wanted to keep you honest.
1412727|CC|- - give me the nav numbers. And give us some nav numbers.
1412733|CDR|Okay. 265, 0.2, and 0.1.
1412740|CC|The - that heading - we want heading, pitch, roll, and sun dial there, Gene.
1412748|CDR|Okay. I'm sorry. Bob. Okay; you want a nav update here?
1412755|CC|Nav initialized, Geno.
1412756|CDR|Yes, sir; you do.
1412757|CC|Roger.
1412800|CDR|Yes, sir; I'm sorry.
1412801|CC|Go to the next page.
1412802|LMP|Let me - let me change my position here, just a sukosh. Let me change my position a sukosh.
1412807|CDR|I knew you'd -
1412822|LMP|Bob, what was that last LRV sample number I gave you?
1412825|CC|22 Echo, 22 Echo.
1412831|LMP|23 Echo, if that followed in sequence, is another rock about - near the SEP documented in the same way.
1412839|CC|Okay; copy that.
1412841|CDR|Okay, Bob. 265 - 265, 0.3, 0.1; roll is 1 right, pitch is 0, and the sun shaft device is 0. I'm heading 281 degrees.
1412855|CC|Okay; copy that. Stand by.
1412902|LMP|Okay. The recorder is ON - -
1412905|CC|Copy that.
1412905|LMP|- - and the RECEIVE POWER switch is on.
1412909|CC|Copy that.
1412912|LMP|And, I guess you're going to hand me EP-4. Get rid of this.
1412921|CC|Okay. 282 is the preferred but that's too small to bother torquing, Gene; you're good as is. We're ready for you guys to go.
1412930|CDR|Okay. That looks good because I have to come left just a sukosh there to proceed parallel down the west line.
1412936|CC|Okay. We're ready for you guys to go. We presume you have the SEP photos, Jack.
1412945|LMP|Yes, I do.
1412946|CC|Okay. And get your frame - we don't need - you can give us a frame count if you want. Remember to pick up EP-4 when you get in the Rover.
1412957|LMP|Okay. We got it, and the frame count is 17.
1413001|CC|Copy 17 for the LMP, and we need a nav reset to verify there, Gene.
1413008|CDR|I did nav reset; I'm reading all balls.
1413011|CC|Okay. And did you happen to check the - -
1413012|CDR|And it is back off.
1413012|CC|- - SEP temperature when you turned it on, Gene? Jack? The receiver?
1413020|LMP|No. I didn't; I didn't. Doubt if it changed much since I called you.
1413025|CC|Okay. We'll catch it at Station 2.
1413030|CC|Okay. Low gain - -
1413030|CDR|Okay, Jack, we got transmitter and receiver both on, huh?
1413030|CC|- - antenna is 240 and we're ready for you guys to leave.
1413034|CC|Give us a mark on the leave.
1413038|CDR|Okay. Here you go, Jack; we need - The SEP antenna receiver - receiver, transmitter, both on, huh?
1413046|LMP|Yes, sir.
1413047|CDR|Okay -
1413047|CC|Okay. And, Gene, remember we want a mark when you pass the end of the antenna.
1413055|CDR|Okay.
1413057|LMP|Can drive fairly slowly, huh?
1413059|CDR|Yes, until I get past the end. I got to get my heading changed about 10 degrees to parallel. We're still in the same relative position, Bob.
1413106|CC|Okay. Very good.
1413107|CDR|Okay.
1413109|CDR|Okay. We are moving right now.
1413112|CC|Okay. We're marking that.
1413114|CDR|Slowly. Okay, Stand by, Bob.
1413136|PAO|The crew has started for Station 2 the most distant of the stations. More than 7 kilometers away.
1413148|CDR|MARK it,
1413149|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1413154|CDR|Okay, We want to go past LM at heading 260, Jack.
1413156|LMP|Well. we want to get at 080 and 0.4 and get rid of this charge.
1413202|CDR|Okay. ... - -
1413203|CC|Okay. And - -
1413205|LMP|Yes. I want to ... - -
1413206|CC|- - 17 a couple of words there as you drive along. Let me give them to you early here. One, we didn't bother to change all the numbers on the checklist, but, by and large, because we think we're 200 meters east of where we were, you should probably increase all those numbers except for the explosive package numbers by about two-tenths to get the distance at which you will come across these areas. Again it's about 0.4, 0.5, and we expect to deploy EP-4. The more important number though is that it's 0.2 west of the ALSEP. As you pass the ALSEP, you might know what the range and distance are reading at that point.
1413242|LMP|Okay. Range - range is the one that changes - on No, wait a minute, that -
1413247|CDR|I got it.
1413248|LMP|I'll get it. Which is it? Range changes every half - on the half kilometer.
1413252|CDR|Yes.
1413255|LMP|Distance.
1413256|CC|Roger, Jack. The range is - -
1413258|CDR|... go around ... - -
1413258|CC|- - what changes in the middle at 0.50 meters and 150 meters.
1413304|LMP|Okay. We - The fender fix is working so far.
1413307|CC|Beautiful.
1413308|CDR|Let me get around your flag. There's your flag way out there, isn't it?
1413312|LMP|Yes.
1413313|CDR|Let me get around that. Man - That's really giving the ALSEP some room.
1413317|LMP|Yes. Okay, Bob. We're still seeing - the light-colored gabbroic rocks. I think the reason I said 50 percent was because in this light they look light-colored, and that's probably largely because of the zap pit halos.
1413332|CC|Okay. I copy that, Jack.
1413333|LMP|But, in the hand-lens, it looked like the standard - standard gabbro.
1413337|CC|Okay.
1413337|CDR|And, Bob, I'm - I'm full out at about 11 - -
1413340|LMP|Okay, you can - you can turn right, now.
1413341|CDR|I'm full out at about 11 clicks right now.
1413344|CC|Beautiful.
1413346|CDR|Oops. ... (Laughter)
1413348|CC|You can give me a call as you pass by the ALSEP as you get ready to deploy the charge, please.
1413355|CDR|Okay. We're almost due south of the ALSEP now.
1413400|CC|Okay - -
1413400|CDR|... that. I've got to work my way through here.
1413400|CC|- - copy that. Go about 0.2 kilometers further than that.
1413413|LMP|It's a little rocky out here.
1413414|CDR|Yes, it sure is.
1413416|LMP|Every - in the area we are now - you get a distance that was -
1413422|CDR|Okay. We just clicked to 4. I want to move over this way just a sukosh.
1413425|LMP|Yes.
1413427|CDR|Okay, I can - I'm just south of my geophone 2 flag now.
1413433|CC|Okay. If you just clicked to 4, let's go to 6 then, just past the click on 6.
1413443|LMP|Okay. And you want about 080?
1413447|CDR|Plenty good enough. I got to start heading right out here, right toward my - upper graphic - -
1413452|LMP|Okay. Hole-in-the-Wall should be just to the left of the notch.
1413455|CDR|Yes. That's exactly where I'm heading.
1413458|LMP|And I think we're coming up closer to the rim of camelot. It's starting to look like a crater now.
1413504|CC|Okay; very good.
1413505|LMP|Looking down-Sun, I see no major albedo changes except for the very fresh craters which are brighter. By a few - by a - maybe 20 percent. The surface - -
1413519|CDR|How are we doing.
1413521|LMP|5 -
1413523|CDR|Okay, Bob. Here's your charge. Pick a spot, Jack.
1413526|LMP|Okay; can you swing right out over there - -
1413528|CDR|Yes.
1413528|LMP|- - about 10 meters ahead?
1413530|LMP|Okay. Give me a shallow turn.
1413535|CDR|How's that?
1413536|LMP|Okay. And I'll set it right there on that - in that - Can you move forward, and I'll get it in that little depression.
1413541|CDR|Okay.
1413542|LMP|You see on the other side of the rock.
1413543|CDR|Yes.
1413549|PAO|This charge is one-eighth of a pound.
1413551|CDR|Okay, Bob; 083, 0.6, and 0.5.
1413557|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1413601|LMP|Okay. Pin 1, pulled and safe; Pin 2 is pulled and safe; Pin 3, pulled and safe. Ever stop and ask yourself what I'm doing.
1413617|CC|I copy that, Jack - -
1413619|CDR|Yes (laughter).
1413620|CC|- - if you can give us a frame count, we'd appreciate it. And I might remind you two to both check that - -
1413624|CDR|Don't fall over.
1413625|CC|- - you're at MIN cooling since you've got a long drive ahead of you there.
1413632|LMP|Hey, I lost my sample thing.
1413634|CDR|Threw it in the floor?
1413636|LMP|I hope so.
1413644|PAO|That charge due to detonate 90 hours 45 minutes after it was deployed.
1413648|CDR|That look good?
1413649|LMP|Yes, it's going to stay.
1413650|CDR|Okay. Have you got anything to ... If not, I'll do a partial for you.
1413655|LMP|Yes. We got to do a partial. I'd like to know where that sampler is. Well, we can do without it, I guess.
1413705|CDR|Yes. Sure be nice to - What did it do; come off the end?
1413707|LMP|Yes, I think I can check it though.
1413708|CDR|Getting your pan?
1413709|LMP|Yes. If you go around to - to seeing that big block there by the ALSEP, then you can forget it.
1413717|CDR|Okay. Okay. I'll just come on around, and I'll pick up my tracks. Do you want to get that sampler? Can you see it?
1413724|LMP|I think I'd better look.
1413728|CDR|All right. Take a look. Bob, one stop here for about 2 seconds.
1413733|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1413741|LMP|Okay. It's down there.
1413742|CDR|Why don't you put it on real quick and -
1413744|LMP|I don't know why - it was hard to put on. Surprised it came off. Here let me - let me hold the end.
1413753|CDR|You got to - got them retracted?
1413756|LMP|Retracted.
1413759|CDR|They'll retract. And let me know when.
1413803|LMP|Okay. Okay. It's - it's loose.
1413806|CDR|Retracted. You want it - how you want it?
1413808|LMP|Retract it again.
1413809|CDR|Okay. Retracted.
1413814|LMP|No - Let go, let go - no, it's just hooking.
1413817|CDR|Okay. Try it - push it in once more.
1413819|LMP|Okay. The best I can do. I'll just lock - I'll twist it down on there and maybe it'll hold.
1413826|CDR|Okay. Twist it tight. I got the rod.
1413838|LMP|Okay. I'll just have to be careful. Okay. I've got it.
1413842|CDR|Okay. Oh - oh.
1413844|LMP|I've got it.
1413845|CDR|Okay.
1413849|LMP|You don't have to put it in - push down.
1413852|CDR|Okay.
1413859|LMP|Okay. Okay. Let's go. Every time you pick your seatbelt up - there it is, it's untwisted now.
1413910|CDR|Okay?
1413911|LMP|Okay.
1413911|CDR|All set?
1413913|LMP|Just about.
1413917|CC|Okay, Jack, a reminder. We're still seeing you in intermediate. You probably will want to go to min before you get back on.
1413926|CDR|He's back on now.
1413928|LMP|And we're rolling.
1413929|CC|Okay, copy. You're moving.
1413929|LMP|Okay. Let's go to Hole-in-the-Wall.
1413932|CDR|Yes, sir.
1413934|CC|Okay. One other thing I might mention to you guys as you're driving here, Jack, before you start talking again, is that - as you go by Camelot, you might keep an eye out for blocks along the rim there, because remember - we may be wanting to come back and move Station 5 to an area where there's blocks, unless there are blocks at the present nominal Station 5. So you might keep an eye for that and plan for the way back. A second thing a reminder, if you do stop for Rover samples or one thing or another along the way, give us a call and keep us informed, because we're timing you on the way out and the assumption is, of course, that driving time out equals drive-back time. And we're under a 63-minute limit to get you from the LM out to the Station 2 because of OPS drive back. So, keep us informed so we can keep a good tab on you.
1414021|LMP|Okay, Bob. Okay. We'll keep you informed.
1414027|CDR|Bob, I got the thing two-blocked, and I'm averaging probably 10 to 11 clicks. It's not exactly straight-line navigation, but I think I can hold most of it.
1414037|CC|Roger. Beautiful.
1414039|LMP|Watch the crater - there you go.
1414042|CC|And, Jack, a reminder - -
1414044|LMP|I tell you, when Gene decides to turn - whoo!
1414047|CC|And, Jack, a reminder on photos yesterday. You apparently took quite a few on the way back from Station 1 to the SEP, and we're right nominal on budget now. But, considering the fact that we didn't do much sampling if you continue to use them at the rate you did yesterday coming back from Station 1, at least as we understand it, you'll be pushing us pretty hard in the budget. Should be every 50 meters or every 100 meters.
1414114|LMP|Bob, okay. And you want to hear something?
1414116|CC|Roger. I'll listen now.
1414122|LMP|Okay. The surface is not changing in terms of the detail. The surface texture of the finegrained regolith still is - has a raindrop pattern. We're more - the blocks still look very much like what we sampled yesterday around the LM. They're light colored, apparently gabbros, with zap pits - zap halos. Occasional craters show lighter colored ejectas both all the way down to - say half a meter in size. Other craters that are just as blocky as those with bright halos have no brightness associated with them. Most of the brightest craters have a little central pit in the bottom which is glass lined. The pit is maybe - a fifth of the diameter of the crater itself. It's a fairly standard thing for most of these fresher craters, is that little central pit.
1414226|CDR|Okay, we're just south of the rim of Camelot. There is a light mantle on the other side. Look at that crater. Whoo!
1414233|LMP|We've got the ... - oh, and there's Camelot.
1414235|CDR|Oh, Whoo! Manischewitz. Take a couple of pictures looking at that.
1414239|LMP|Okay. Can you swing a little?
1414240|CDR|Yes.
1414241|LMP|Okay, I got them.
1414242|CDR|That is a 600-meter crater.
1414246|LMP|Okay. I - I - -
1414247|CDR|And it is very likely we won't have any problem finding blocks on the rim of Camelot.
1414247|CC|Hey, how about a bearing and range there to help us pick out the LM ... Roger. How about bearing and range to help us pick out the LM location.
1414254|CDR|Okay. 08, 31.2, and 1.0.
1414258|CC|Okay. Thank you. Thank you.
1414259|LMP|Bob, listen -
1414305|LMP|Okay. There's a little -
1414308|CDR|Man, are there blocks there.
1414309|LMP|Now that - that little crater in the ejecta did not - of Camelot, at least the rim of Camelot, did not bring up blocks on the rim. It may have been an old depression. Bob, there is extremely blocky area. This would - I think Station 5 was over there where that block area is. The light-colored areas on the photos are essentially - blocky. They're probably 30 percent blocks. All of them are in the - many of them are in the 2 to 3 to 4-meter size range. All of them look light colored, look like the gabbro we sampled from a distance. They have light-halo zap pits on them. I see only occasional grayer varieties, which I believe are the nonvesicular ones like we also sampled.
1414404|CC|Okay. Copy that, Jack. Very good.
1414405|LMP|But the light-colored gabbros are dominant.
1414408|CC|Thank you.
1414412|LMP|Okay. Station 5 would have been - rather than in a light-colored area would have been in a very blocky area. Station 5 is probably still very good for blocks.
1414424|CC|Okay. Thank you.
1414426|LMP|There is probably as big blocks there as anywhere on the rim that we've seen.
1414432|CC|Copy that.
1414433|LMP|Okay. We ought to be going be - really between Horatio and Camelot now.
1414437|CDR|No. I'm going to give them a call when we're due south of Camelot and see if they can't get a position on us.
1414444|CDR|Hold it, Jack.
1414445|LMP|Oh, watch it.
1414446|CDR|Hold it; hold it.
1414447|LMP|You can go around that one.
1414448|CDR|You bet you (laughter). Whoo! That slowed the speed up a little bit.
1414456|CDR|You can unwrinkle your toes now. Okay.
1414459|LMP|Oh. I wasn't worried, Gene. Watch that block there; it's probably more than 14 inches. And got a fairly close look at the rock, and it is the vesicular - looks very much like the vesicular clinopyroxene gabbro.
1414516|CC|Thank you.
1414517|LMP|Now, the surface of Camelot is mantled - or the rim - is mantled with the same dark-gray material, and it has the same surface texture - a very fine raindrop pattern. The saturation crater size does not look bigger than a half a meter, if that.
1414534|CDR|Okay, Bob, I'm going to give you 081, 1.6, and 1.4. We're south of the center of Camelot.
1414541|CC|Okay. Thank you, Gene.
1414543|LMP|One crater - Okay. We ought to see Horatio here pretty quick. I think it's right up in front of us.
1414550|CDR|Yes, I think you're right.
1414556|CDR|We can definitely see the light mantle as it comes out over the valley here, and we're looking at Hole-in-the-Wall, although it's still too subtle. We're looking right at Lara, as a matter of fact.
1414607|LMP|Yes. There's Lara, very clear; and Hole-in-the-Wall, you can see it.
1414610|CDR|Yes, yes.
1414613|LMP|Yes.
1414613|CDR|There's Horatio way over there where those blocks are. See it?
1414617|LMP|Yes, that's Horatio. We're right on course, sir. There's a little depression we didn't talk about, though, between Horatio and Camelot. But it's a depression and not a blocky crater at all. As a matter of fact, the total block population has changed out on the - once we get away from the rim of Camelot the block frequency is quite a bit smaller. It's down - maybe to only - less than 1 percent of the surface.
1414644|CDR|Much easier driving with the Rover. Boy, am I glad we got that fender on. Very obvious that the Rover navigation - because of the blocks and because of the smaller ... craters, and very subtle type craters are in this area.
1414708|LMP|There are up to 2-meter, bright-halo, blocky craters - and that's blocky wall craters that may be incident rock rather than - I think it is rather than bedrock - in the rim area of Camelot.
1414731|CDR|Horatio has got to be - there's Horatio, right there.
1414733|LMP|Yes. That's Horatio.
1414734|CDR|Let me give another mark on the southern rim of Horatio.
1414739|LMP|Okay. The scarp looks very smooth from here - no obvious outcrops at this time. Don't seem to be penetrating to any bedrock in the area we're traversing now, just to the southeast of Horatio. Horatio has a blocky wall; however, the upper several tens of meters, probably, of rim look as if it's either mantled or composed of - the light-gray regolith material we've been driving on. The blocks do not come to the rim of Horatio.
1414825|CC|Okay. Copy that, Jack.
1414826|CDR|- - know if I want to take you down there or not. Yes, Jack, hold on ... take you down there.
1414832|LMP|Horatio has quite a different appearance than Camelot. It is - and that's the main one - the rims - the blocks do not get to the rim.
1414839|LMP|What's your roll? (Laughter) I know it's not much, but it seems like a lot.
1414846|CDR|... go around that crater.
1414848|LMP|Yes. The - it looks like - if Horatio is any gage, the rim thickness of maybe, and this is a wild guess, Bob, but maybe an average of 20 or 30 meters stratigraphic thickness lies above the exposures of the subfloor; exposures being blocks in the wall. And some of those blocks, again, are several meters, if not 5 to 10 meters in diameter. And they're concentrated on the west rim that I can see. There are very few blocks on the east - excuse me, the west wall - there are very few blocks on the east, north, and south walls of Horatio.
1414943|CC|Copy that, Jack.
1414945|CDR|Okay, Bob. We're on the southern rim; 078, 2.3, and 2.0.
1414951|LMP|Yes. We're maybe 100 meters south of the rim. Actually, we're on the rim crest. We're 100 meters south of the break in slope into the crater.
1415002|CDR|There's a lot of - it's an undulating, hummocky traverse terrain in there, Jack.
1415007|LMP|Yes.
1415007|CDR|These little craters make it bumpy; but, other than that, it's really smooth sailing.
1415010|LMP|That's right. This is what I sort of expected dark mantle to look like, rather than what we landed on. Not more than 1 percent of the surface, and that - and that percentage continues right over the rim crest of Horatio down onto the wall until you hit the big blocks.
1415027|CDR|What's this depression? That's not - No, we're not to Bronte yet.
1415030|LMP|No, I don't have any - No, we're not at Bronte.
1415033|CC|Okay, 17. And how about an amps and a mobility - a speed reading.
1415041|CDR|I've been pushing aywhere from 9 to 11 clicks, and most of the time that's full out, and amperes are bouncing around 100 apiece.
1415055|LMP|Hey, watch these down-Sun craters. They're hard to see.
1415058|CDR|I know they are. We're climbing, Jack. Because I've been full bore most of the time, and all I can get out of it is 10 clicks; and when I decelerate, she decelerates in a hurry. What's our next stop here, a sample at 3.9?
1415112|LMP|A - 080/3.9.
1415118|CDR|Well, I'm sitting on 080 right now and 2.6. I think we've got to add a little bit to that ...
1415125|CC|Okay. Stand by. We'll get a new correction for you guys on that shortly.
1415133|LMP|Okay, Bob. The surface is not changing. We see no craters that seem to penetrate into bedrock out in here - that is with blocky rims, and that's quite a contrast to the area we sampled at Station 1A yesterday. I see - I cannot see in my field of view any blocky-rim craters. There are slight craters with - with fragmental walls and rims, but it looks like incident rock rather than the subfloor materials.
1415208|CDR|Jack, can you see over there to the left? I'll turn a little bit - on the - on the dark area of the South Massif where you get those - those impressed lineations. See them going from left upward to the right?
1415217|LMP|Yes. I see what you mean; right.
1415219|CDR|That's what I saw out my window.
1415220|LMP|Yes - lower left they - they go obliquely up the slope.
1415225|CDR|They're more like wrinkles, they're - linear wrinkles.
1415228|LMP|Yes, Crenulations, you might say, in the slope that look something like those I saw from orbit - looking in the shadowed area - at the edge of the shadows. Bob, we've seen craters as much as - 20 meters, maybe 30 meters in diameter without blocky rims.
1415248|CC|Copy that. ... Thank you.
1415249|LMP|The rim block population is not much dif - The rim block population is not much different than the average for the terrain in here.
1415306|CDR|Boy, I'll tell you. If we can't recognize a change in that albedo when we get onto that white mantle, I'm going to be surprised.
1415311|LMP|Mark my words. Okay. The light mantle is just what Gene has said, it's a - that's it, right now - there are some very bright craters in it - they stand out, bright-haloed craters scattered over it, that - seem to be quite a bit brighter than anything we have out here on the dark mantle. See those blocks over there? That's the first different colored blocks I've seen; they're sort of gray looking.
1415341|CDR|Where are you looking?
1415342|LMP|Over to the right a little bit.
1415343|CDR|Darker gray, a little bit.
1415344|LMP|Watch yourself here. Okay. There's a crater with a big mass of block in the bottom. It looks like there - it might be a secondary fragment from somewhere.
1415353|CDR|Do you want to get a photo as we go by?
1415354|LMP|Yes, let's - can you swing a little bit to the right?
1415356|CDR|Yes.
1415400|LMP|That might be worth a - How's our time for traverse, Bob? Do we have time for an LRV sample?
1415406|CC|You're doing great, so far. We're looking for that first LRV sample at about 4.2 - that's in the light mantle, if you can do it quickly. But it's - we weren't planning on it.
1415417|CDR|Want one here?
1415418|LMP|Yes , let's get -
1415418|CC|Target of opportunity there, Jack.
1415420|LMP|Can you get -
1415422|CDR|Go ahead.
1415423|LMP|Okay. Swing a little bit to the right now.
1415425|CDR|Okay.
1415426|LMP|Right up across that little ray.
1415428|CDR|Okay.
1415429|LMP|And I'll try to get a chunk of whatever - okay, I want - keep going - keep going -
1415434|CDR|Look at that big ... - -
1415434|LMP|Whoa, whoa, whoa.
1415435|CDR|Okay.
1415436|LMP|Let me get the switch off.
1415438|CDR|082, 3.0, and 2.6. And, Bob, I've been making - 10 to 12 clicks coming across the surface; and, as I say, for the most part, that's full bore except where I have to do some rapid changes.
1415455|CC|Okay. And, by and large, the back room is interested in you guys pressing on to Station 2.
1415504|CDR|Okay, we are. Just watch the batt - or the - LCRU.
1415508|PAO|That's 10 to 12 kilometers per hour.
1415512|LMP|Okay, Gene. That's a pretty big rock in there.
1415515|CDR|Okay.
1415515|LMP|And, Bob, I think there's -
1415516|CDR|Hold it. Hold it down farther - down. It's got quite a bit of dirt in it.
1415523|LMP|I think this is a sam - this is a block from a linear-strewn field of very irregular and jagged rocks that are - that are southwest of the - of a crater that's 10 to 15 meters in diameter. If - if - if - it looks like the material that may have formed the crater, and you can look at some of the pictures and make up your own decision.
1415549|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1415550|LMP|Can you get it in there? Okay. You got it.
1415554|CDR|No, no. No, I didn't.
1415554|LMP|No?
1415555|CDR|Okay.
1415556|LMP|The bag's not open.
1415557|CDR|Well, okay. Yes, that's bad.
1415603|LMP|Can you push it in? Pull down.
1415605|CDR|Okay. It's down. 26 Echo, Bob. We're on our way.
1415608|CC|Okay. Copy that - -
1415609|CDR|Go ahead.
1415609|CC|- - And, you got a frame count, Jack?
1415613|LMP|Oh, yes. Let me -
1415616|CDR|And I did get my locator here.
1415617|LMP|Okay. I got mine.
1415618|CC|Thank you, Jack, Gene.
1415620|LMP|And the frame - the frame count is 95.
1415627|CC|Copy that.
1415628|LMP|Holy cow! I'd better slow down my picture-taking.
1415633|CC|Roger, Jack.
1415636|LMP|Okay. We're in a little area where the fragment population may be up to 3 percent. It's getting a little more like what we saw around the LM. In fact, I would say it was comparable now.
1415649|CDR|I'm going down this slope and up the other side, Jack.
1415651|LMP|But nothing like Station 1.
1415653|CC|Okay. Copy that. And the next planned Rover sample will be at a distance of 4.2; so, 080 and 4.2. And it will be in the light mantle if - -
1415704|LMP|Okay. We got it, Bob.
1415704|CC|- - that disagrees with those numbers.
1415710|LMP|Okay. It's in the first fall of light mantle, as I recall. is that right?
1415714|CC|Roger; the thumbs.
1415718|CDR|Okay, Bob. Your heading at 260 looks like it's right on, by the way, from what I see on the skyline.
1415724|CC|Okay. And how's the low-gain antenna holding up?
1415725|LMP|Look at that ...
1415729|CDR|Well, I'm moving it, so I guess you're getting it.
1415732|CC|Yes, we're getting it - just checking.
1415737|LMP|Bob, I'm still - the blocks I see still seem to be the gabbro, the - except for that one sample we took, which I hope was what I thought it was -
1415749|CDR|Gee, it's blocky here.
1415750|LMP|Let's see - -
1415750|CDR|Oh, that's a big crater. We got to get around here.
1415752|LMP|Okay. That must be Bronte.
1415755|CDR|My god, is that big.
1415756|LMP|That's bigger than I expected.
1415758|CDR|Whoo! I got to go around this thing.
1415759|LMP|Yes, yes. There are some very - -
1415803|CDR|I got to go back here.
1415804|LMP|(Noise) ... blocks, greater than the normal gabbro we've seen, that are very - have very large, egg-sized vesicles in them.
1415823|LMP|Watch it - you got one on your right there - Here you go.
1415824|CDR|Yes. I got them.
1415826|LMP|Okay. I - don't mind me, Gene.
1415828|CDR|No. No problem. That's all right, because some of those down-Suns are hard to see. I want to get off this slope.
1415834|LMP|I wonder if I took a picture of that block field. (Laughing) I hope I did. Getting to be so automatic that I'm not sure what I'm taking any more.
1415843|CDR|Okay. I'm going to go through this niche between - on a high point in the saddle here.
1415851|LMP|Okay. How does it figure, Bob? I think we're just north of Bronte. Does that figure?
1415857|CC|Roger. That seems to be about where you should be on the map here. We gather you're circumnavigating a little bit. Comm's dropping out from time to time.
1415904|LMP|Yes.
1415906|CDR|0.8, 3.5, and 2.9; and we're on the north side of Bronte.
1415912|LMP|And it looks like Bronte has penetrated the dark mantle in here. It got to subfloor, but there's not an awful lot of blocks around the rim - There are just some small ones - compared to what we saw around - Watch it.
1415927|CDR|Yes. Yes.
1415928|LMP|What we saw around Horatio or in the walls of Horatio and around Camelot. Nothing, also, like what we saw yesterday at Station 1. Bob, that characteristic little dimple in the bottom of the craters is still with us, and it's invariably glass-lined in the fresh ones.
1415953|CC|Okay. Very good.
1415955|LMP|Now, that's not a complete lining. It just - there seems to be glass agglutinates, if you will - that's holding the fragments in the bottom of the crater together. There's one on the side of an older crater. We're back into about a 1-percent coverage. I suspect that the reason we - our block population went up there was because of Bronte.
1420021|CDR|An awful lot of these ... glass-lined little craters around.
1420023|LMP|Yes, and you notice, Gene, what I was saying about the little dimple in the bottom?
1420028|CDR|Yes.
1420028|LMP|Watch the fresh ones, and they all have that little dimple as if that - You see, there's one right there.
1420033|CDR|Yes, right there.
1420033|LMP|Man, you can predict it.
1420038|CDR|Jack, you know, I think the white mantle is starting right over there. See on your right?
1420042|LMP|Yes, that's the first -
1420043|CDR|The place you can really see it is where it's reflected off the slopes of the - or the - -
1420047|LMP|Yes.
1420047|CDR|- - Of the cliffs out there, but I think - I hate to say it, but Charlie may be right.
1420053|LMP|Well, but you know, one thing that may distinguish it is the - the bright-halo craters are brighter.
1420100|CDR|But I can see it from here - -
1420101|LMP|Yes.
1420101|CDR|- - On the floor of the valley here.
1420103|LMP|Yes.
1420105|CDR|On the scarp it really shows up.
1420108|LMP|Okay. Block population is unchanged; still appears to be the - when I can see large enough blocks - appears to be the gabbro, although there's not as - not as much to look at now in terms of blocks. The surface characteristics have not changed. There are no craters that we see that are bringing up clear, blocky rims. There's a - most of the fresh craters have incident rock around them. The craters are the same size. They are older and more subdued. That incident rock is apparently broken down. I suspect a small zapping breaks that down fairly quickly.
1420153|CC|Okay, 17. Copy that. You still making about 9 to 11 kilometers?
1420201|CDR|No, sir. I've been making from 10 to 12, Bob, mostly 12.
1420204|CC|Okay. Can you give me a reading on the amps this time, Geno.
1420204|CDR|Okay. You're getting - Stand by. I've got a little navigating to do.
1420212|CC|Okay; standing by.
1420214|CDR|Okay. I'm read - I'm reading - I'm reading 100 - bouncing - around 100 on both of them.
1420219|CC|Okay. How about amps and not amp-hours?
1420219|CDR|... up-and-down, hummocky terrain, I think with - Oh, I'm sorry.
1420227|LMP|Watch your - you got a hole in front of you.
1420229|CDR|Yes.
1420230|LMP|Oh. There you go. Spun out a little bit.
1420237|CDR|Here, let me get up here.
1420247|LMP|Good vehicle you got here.
1420249|CDR|Yes. It takes a little getting used to, though.
1420251|LMP|Yes.
1420251|CDR|I'm not sure I want to go through many of those.
1420253|LMP|No.
1420256|CDR|Okay, Bob. I'll give you an amp reading as soon as I can. Just stand by for it.
1420300|CC|All right. There's no hurry. No hurry.
1420301|LMP|Would you believe my camera handle's coming off?
1420308|CDR|The terrain gets a lot more locally hummocky with some - with some well-rounded rims but very - very large-aspect-ratio craters, which you got to get around in here - in the 4 or 5-meter size.
1420330|CDR|Charlie, that - Charlie - I was thinking of white mantle. That's the white mantle we're coming up on right up here.
1420335|LMP|Yes.
1420336|CDR|See that on your right?
1420337|LMP|Yes.
1420338|CDR|That's it, there's not going to be that much difference .
1420341|LMP|Oh.
1420346|CDR|Not going to be that much difference, but - look where you're going.
1420351|LMP|I got to watch I don't lose my camera. It's - come loose.
1420358|CDR|See, now you can look where we're going to come up on the white mantle. It's dusted with that light - light - look at it.
1420404|LMP|Yes.
1420405|CDR|We're only 100 meters from the light mantle.
1420407|LMP|Well -
1420408|CC|Okay. How about giving us the range and bearing when you get to it.
1420409|CDR|Look at - look at this crater in here. We're coming right up on it now.
1420411|LMP|Yes. There certainly is a change in the general albedo, particularly in the craters. The craters are much brighter in their walls than we've seen before.
1420423|CDR|Yes. That's a -
1420425|LMP|Although there still is a brown - a light gray dusting over the top of it in here, but it's clearly different - no question about that.
1420433|CDR|You can't see the contact as you cross it but we're just - we know we're coming into something lighter - You can - obviously see it.
1420439|LMP|Yes. We ought to sample the rim of one of these craters when we get our LRV sample, because that's what's distinctly lighter.
1420445|CC|How about a range and bearing, guys?
1420446|CDR|We're at 3.8 here, and we can sample that rim - -
1420450|CC|Copy the 3.8.
1420451|CDR|083, 4.4, 3.8, and I've been ... - -
1420453|LMP|How about right over there, Geno? Can you get on the rim of that crater?
1420455|CDR|Right here?
1420456|LMP|No, right to the right there. Right here - that light stuff. See the big crater here - -
1420502|CDR|Yes.
1420502|LMP|- - and the light material right on the rim?
1420502|CDR|Yes. I can get there. But I'm going to have to not give you much of a turn because it's - -
1420506|LMP|That's all right. I got the pictures. Now, if you can swing to the left a little bit and then back - whoa. Now, back right. Okay. Hope my camera stays on there.
1420516|CDR|You like that?
1420517|LMP|Whoa. Yes. Whoa, whoa.
1420519|CDR|Okay, Bob. We're 083, 4.4, and 3.8; and I've been running about 20 to 25 amps, I think, on both.
1420528|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1420535|CDR|We are in the light mantle. It's not a contrasting light like you might expect, or like we're looking at on the scarp as the Sun shines on it, but I don't think there's any question.
1420546|CC|Okay. Beautiful.
1420546|LMP|Yes. The craters are definite - that penetrate into it are definitely different. However, the surface texture is unchanged. There may be fewer blocks.
1420604|CDR|Okay; bag 27 Echo, 27 Echo.
1420607|CC|Copy that. And frame count, Jack.
1420609|CDR|Hold your bag? We don't want to lose it.
1420612|LMP|Stand by.
1420613|CDR|Hold it up.
1420618|LMP|Okay. It's in there.
1420620|CDR|Is it in? Okay. Oops, that bag won't stay open.
1420623|LMP|Yes. It will after we get a couple of samples in there. Okay; my locator.
1420628|CDR|And my locator.
1420629|LMP|I hope I don't lose my camera.
1420631|CDR|I can't reach it, or I'd help you.
1420633|LMP|Okay; 110.
1420636|CC|Copy that, Jack.
1420641|LMP|I guess I never - - I guess I didn't do what I wanted to do and that's get that thing really cinched down.
1420651|PAO|We're an hour and 32 minutes into this EVA.
1420651|CDR|Boy, Bob, one of the remarkable things is the Sun-angle difference on that light mantle when you're looking at the slopes of the Scarp versus what we're on. I hate to use a familiar term, but my impression right here is there is more of a raindrop influence than back at the LM, or in the darker mantle.
1420716|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1420717|LMP|Yes. Might - might be.
1420720|CDR|I think so.
1420721|LMP|I think the big thing is, though, that each one of these little craters is much light - much more lightly colored. But we're still not - there's no crater in view that does - that has a blocky rim. There's fragmental rims based on, almost certainly, incident rock, but no blocky rims.
1420741|CDR|You know, one of the reasons those craters look lighter is because of their Sun angle. Walls of some of these little craters - it's the same material we're driving on, I'll bet. Yes, there is incident rock right there, Jack, you're right.
1420752|LMP|Yes.
1420756|CDR|Oh, boy.
1420757|LMP|The fragment population is certainly less than 1 percent in here.
1420802|CDR|Yes.
1420802|LMP|Right now. When I say fragments, I'm talking about rocks that are - are greater than a centimeter in grain size.
1420810|CDR|You know, it may be me, Bob; but it - it also seems to be a little bit more difficult to drive down-Sun in this area.
1420817|LMP|Yes, I think it is brighter, Geno. I was thinking that a minute ago, but it's hard to make a - I think your normal albedo is - is greater. Here's some rocks now starting ... - -
1420830|CDR|And the little craters still have the central pits.
1420832|CC|Okay. We're losing your comm a little bit, guys.
1420853|CDR|... Well, a couple of them looked to me like they had some very light ... crystals in them. See that?
1420856|LMP|I'm afraid those are zap pits.
1420857|CDR|They could be.
1420859|LMP|I got - I think I've been fooled by that, too, and that's why I estimated the ... time.
1420905|CDR|Whoo! I just want to keep you out of those slopes, and I'll tell you, I get you in some to - -
1420911|LMP|That's all right.
1420911|CDR|- - keeping you out of them.
1420916|LMP|Okay. We're getting a little more blocks in here. Of course, we're approaching the dark mantle again. Now, you can see the difference. You got to look hard for it. But, you see those craters out in there are not white anymore.
1420930|CDR|I got to get around that slope.
1420932|LMP|Yes. Okay, You still got Hole-in-the-Wall picked out over there, don't you?
1420940|CDR|Yes, I got it. I'm just - - And, I'm trying to keep comm with them as I'm turning here.
1420944|LMP|Yes.
1420945|CDR|And, I've been keeping the thing on. I don't know if they're reading us, but I've been moving it.
1420949|CC|Read you loud and clear, guys.
1420952|LMP|Okay. Looking up on the South Massif, we've got real good views of the block-strewn fields. There's one that - there seems to be two dominant colorations of the rocks. The light-colored ones, very - very light tan and to white, and then there are the blue-gray rocks. There's one major outcrop of blue-gray about a sixth of the way down the slope, the center of the field of view we have; and it looks very much like similar blue-gray rocks, right at the crest, the highest point from our vantage point.
1421035|CDR|Bob, you want another sample of the dark mantle here? Could you use that?
1421035|CC|Okay, Gene. A range and bearing please.
1421038|CC|Yes, we want - As soon as you get into the dark mantle - We're estimating it's something like 4.34, 4.5, somewhere in that vicinity.
1421048|LMP|We're there.
1421049|CC|Okay. We're ready for another one, then.
1421050|LMP|We're there. Now, let's - If you can - Okay, right over there, and maybe I can get a rock with it; See that batch of rocks there?
1421058|CDR|Right here?
1421058|LMP|Whoa. Yes. Swing it. Whoa, now swing back over. Little more, little more. Whoa. Little more.
1421105|CDR|Can you - can you reach it?
1421106|LMP|Now, if you go forward.
1421108|CDR|Can you reach it?
1421109|LMP|Hold it. Right there.
1421110|CDR|Okay, Bob; 082, 5.0, and 4.3.
1421117|CC|Copy that.
1421122|CDR|And CDR is 3.85 and about 70 percent and no flags.
1421131|CC|Okay. Thank you, Geno.
1421147|LMP|I got it.
1421149|CDR|You got it? Okay?
1421150|LMP|I got the rock. I got the rock, and there's some dirt in there. Maybe I'd better get a little bit more dirt.
1421156|CDR|Yes.
1421157|LMP|You don't have any trouble getting dirt. Can you see in there? is there - -
1421202|CDR|Yes.
1421204|LMP|- - Much soil?
1421205|CDR|Oh, a little bit - -
1421206|LMP|Okay. I'll get - I'll get this soil.
1421208|CDR|Couple teaspoonfulls. Twenty-eight Echo, Bob.
1421211|CC|Say again there, 17.
1421215|CDR|Twenty-eight Echo,
1421217|CC|Copy that.
1421225|CDR|And that's primarily a rock fragment. Jack's getting a soil fragment - soil sample with it.
1421231|CC|Copy.
1421232|CDR|Jack, look at the wrinkles over there on the North Massif.
1421236|LMP|Yes, there's no question that there is apparent lineations all over these Massifs, in a variety of directions. Hey, look at how that Scarp goes up beside there. There's a distinct change in texture.
1421247|CDR|Okay.
1421249|LMP|As a matter of fact, lineations are not present on the Scarp, that we can see, where it crosses the North Massif. There is no sign of those lineations on there.
1421301|CDR|Oh, man; yes. I can see what you're talking about now.
1421302|LMP|Look over by Hanover.
1421304|CDR|It looks like the Scarp overlays the North Massif, doesn't it?
1421307|LMP|Yes.
1421308|CDR|Okay. This last one was 29 Echo.
1421313|CC|Okay. Copy that. And that's the soil.
1421315|CDR|Okay, now I need to get in that bag. That's affirm.
1421321|CDR|Here's another one. You're going to - don't lose those.
1421325|LMP|I won't. I'll put it down.
1421330|CDR|Okay, Bob, we are rolling.
1421331|CC|Copy that.
1421333|LMP|And pray for me, Bob, that I don't lose my camera. Okay. Hanover is very - quite a ways up the slope. I don't think we'd have gotten to it, as we've planned, that time. But the appearance you have of the Scarp - North Massif contact is one of the Scarp being smoother textured, less cratered, and certainly less lineated. And I wouldn't be a bit surprised if it's, as Gene says, younger.
1421416|CC|Okay, Jack. Copy that.
1421416|CDR|But that goes - it's not just the - it's not just this slope, it's the materials on the other side of the Scarp, on the west side.
1421432|LMP|Okay, I'm going to have to really ease up on pictures. I forgot to give them a frame count.
1421436|CC|Yes. We didn't get a frame count. You want to give us a frame count there, Jack?
1421442|LMP|Well, Bob. The problem is I - if I - every time I take my hand off, my camera loosens up again.
1421451|CC|Okay; I copy that. And our estimate is that if you kind of go between 50 and 100 meters between frames, We'll make it.
1421504|CDR|Boy, I tell you. Are those Massifs getting to look big now. Holy Smoly.
1421510|LMP|That frame at the LRV sample was about 115.
1421515|CC|Copy that.
1421521|LMP|I'll tell you, that Scarp looks nice over there, too, doesn't it?
1421524|CDR|Yes.
1421526|LMP|Okay, we're back down in our old friend, the dark mantle. And I think the zero phase point is not as bright as it was. Passing a small crater, but the block population is still way down there in about - Whoops, watch that one - 1 percent.
1421549|CC|And, 17, for your benefit, we're showing you with very good net mobility rates here; and things looking quite good.
1421558|LMP|Thank you. Gene's doing a great job.
1421603|CDR|I'll tell you, it takes all your time to drive, though. You look around, and you're in a hole.
1421613|LMP|Okay here's another small crater - instant rock, with the same little pits and a spattering of glass holding the pit materials together. None of these - none of the glass linings look very coherent, Bob. They mainly just seem to be a sprinkling of glass that's - some - helping or coating the instant rock.
1421644|CC|Okay, I copy that, Jack.
1421649|PAO|We're in contact with America on the 28th revolution.
1421655|LMP|We still don't have - The craters at about 10 to 15 meters in diameter seem to have somewhat more blocky material in their rims. But they're not clearcut blocky rim craters. And here's one that's probably 50 meters across that has a - a fair number of blocks in the bottom. Looks like it might have just about gotten down to where the gabbro is - starts to be abundant again.
1421726|CC|Okay's I copy on that one, Jack.
1421727|CDR|... start ... 12 o'clock - 12 o'clock; and I'm going to work my way up to Hole-in-the-Wall and from there on up.
1421734|LMP|I think that's good.
1421735|CDR|Take a long, easy turnout.
1421736|LMP|Yes.
1421739|CDR|Got Hole-in-the-Wall, Bob. It's a very long, very subtle, very gentle slope. We'll just have to get some more words when we get there.
1421748|CC|Okay; we're anxiously awaiting them.
1421752|CC|How about a range and bearing while you're at it?
1421752|CDR|Yes. I've been taking 10 or 12 clicks most of the time.
1421758|CDR|Okay, ... .2, 5.6 and 4.9
1421803|CC|Copy 4.9 on the range.
1421805|CDR|And about - 20 to 22 amps most of the time.
1421812|CC|Okay, we're losing a little bit of LOW GAIN there, Geno.
1421815|CDR|Yes.
1421818|LMP|I think you need to tilt it up a little. Probably undershooting the Earth. I don't know.
1421823|CDR|Well, our pitch angle changes all the time. That's the problem. Bob, I have been within 10 to 20 degrees of you the whole time.
1421832|LMP|Okay. Bob, we're not in light mantle, I don't think.
1421839|CDR|Maybe we are. I think we are, yes
1421841|LMP|I think we are.
1421842|CDR|I think we are. According to my geology map ...
1421844|LMP|I guess we are. Gosh, I was going to say the craters are white - whiter than they have been. So, we're back in it. And - -
1421851|CDR|I think - -
1421851|LMP|- - even the phase point's brighter, too.
1421854|CDR|I think that place where we had those small, blocky craters was in the dark mantle. I - They're not evident here in the lighter stuff.
1421859|LMP|Yes, yes.
1421901|CDR|Boy, is that getting big. Whoo-ee!
1421906|CDR|Hold on. Whoooee!
1421908|LMP|Oh, boy, that really gives me a strange feeling (laughter).
1421912|CDR|Gives me a strange feeling too. Those are not intentional.
1421919|LMP|I understand.
1421921|CDR|I'm not sure I've got enough guts to make them intentional. Man everything's getting to look big the closer you get. Hole-in-the-Wall looks more promising, though, Bob.
1421937|LMP|Yes, I don't think that's going to be any problem.
1421938|CDR|Until we get up and look back. Oh, man, what a trip this is going to be. Golly.
1421947|LMP|That vent cooling is just about right, isn't it.
1421949|CDR|No, it's just about warm for me.
1421951|LMP|Yes.
1421954|CDR|Bob, is my PLSS cooling working all right?
1421958|CC|Roger. It looks like it's working to us.
1422003|CDR|Okay.
1422005|LMP|Bob, I'm not - The rock fragments look - still look like gabbro. The craters tend to have white walls and white rims, which they don't have in the dark - mantled area. The block population is way down, 1 percent or less. However, the bigger craters do have more blocks; but nowhere does that population seem get above about 5 percent. And that's on the walls and the rims of the craters, say bigger than 15 meters. There's one probably 20 meters in diameter that has some blocks on it.
1422046|CDR|Have you seen Nemo? I think Nemo is right over there, if I'm not mistaken. It's - I don't know.
1422054|LMP|Nemo will be hard to see. But, yes, it's probably that one right in there. Or back here. There's one back here.
1422101|CDR|Well, it's pretty - -
1422102|LMP|Yes, well. Yes, that's closer to Scarp. You're probably - it's probably right off your wing there.
1422108|CDR|Okay, I'm going straight ahead and then I'm going to make a left turn.
1422111|LMP|Okay. We're looking at Lara - Now, Lara - I can see blocks in the northwest rim of Lara. At least, it's rugged terrain; and it looks like blocky terrain. One spot - is all I see. It looks like it may be a couple hundred meters in average diameter. On - it starts about - maybe three-quarters of the way up the wall and goes right up to the rim.
1422143|CDR|Hey, Bob, Hole-in-the-Wall seems to be a - -
1422146|LMP|Hey, look at that. Look at that crater!!
1422148|CDR|Right there? Yes.
1422150|LMP|That pit - that central pit goes down about half the depth of the crater, and the crater is a fresh 3-meter crater. That's - it almost was a cylindrical pit. Hey, Bob, Hole-in-the-Wall is a - is just a step - headed down to the south or southeast on the Scarp. It's a - Scarp is just about what I think we all expected it to be. It's very rolling and relatively smooth. I don't really see any outcrops exposed anywhere out here to the - to the south.
1422226|LMP|No. You see, now there's Station 3 area right up there.
1422230|CDR|Yes.
1422234|LMP|Looks like maybe that - set of - see that bright bigger crater over there to the right of Lara? That's probably a good place for Station 3.
1422243|CDR|Yes, way over there. Yes. Okay, we're going to find out something very shortly.
1422249|LMP|It doesn't look very rocky, Gene.
1422251|CDR|No.
1422252|CC|How about a bearing and range guys?
1422257|CDR|Bob, I'll give it to you just as soon as I make my turn. It's not too far - 100 meters -
1422301|LMP|Are - are you - are you going to turn over that or go on closer - -
1422303|CDR|No, I'm going right up straight ahead and then go on to the inside of that place.
1422306|LMP|Yes. That's more than 100 meters.
1422309|CDR|Yes. I'll - 081 and 5.6.
1422312|CC|Copy that.
1422316|LMP|There's the - Now the craters are getting very, very light colored - in their rims and walls.
1422324|CDR|You notice when we're in the light mantle looking at the scarp, at this angle, it loses some of its high albedo?
1422329|LMP|Yes. Yes. I think we're getting - -
1422333|CDR|We've got a long depression to go around.
1422334|LMP|Your eyes get used to it.
1422337|CDR|Okay, Jack, we got to watch it because I got to go around a long depressions. That's a crater over there.
1422342|LMP|On the right, yes.
1422343|CDR|I don't know how - can get over there to -
1422344|LMP|Well, I think - -
1422345|CDR|I may have to go up over there. I can't go down that hole. That one's not going to make it.
1422350|LMP|What's your pitch?
1422351|CDR|Let's go back here. We can't get there. I'm going to go over here.
1422355|LMP|What was your pitch then, Geno?
1422358|CDR|Oh, ... primarily. I can't go there.
1422401|LMP|Yes, I think you're right.
1422404|CDR|We'll go up this gentle slope. See what's on top.
1422410|CDR|Okay. Let me get my ...
1422415|PAO|In lunar orbit Ron Evans is right on the flight plan.
1422418|LMP|We made a turn to the south a little bit at 081 and 5.7. Are you going to try to drive up there?
1422427|CDR|I don't think we're going to have any choice.
1422430|LMP|Okay. Looks to me like right on the - just to the left of that - -
1422432|CDR|Yes.
1422432|LMP|- - white crater is a - or even right like you're headed now and then bear off to the right.
1422437|CDR|Yes.
1422443|CDR|Find out how this climbs in a minute.
1422446|LMP|Oh, I think you're all right. That - -
1422448|CDR|And, Bob, I'm starting up the scarp at 081, 6.6, and 5.7.
1422453|CC|Okay. Copy that, Geno.
1422454|LMP|This is the first tongue of the scarp.
1422458|CDR|I don't even think the Rover knows it's going uphill. I've got about 3- 7 or 8 amps. See what's on top here.
1422508|LMP|You're making about 8 - 8 clicks.
1422510|CDR|And I'm full bore.
1422514|LMP|(Laughter)
1422516|CDR|Well, I'll tell you, this Rover doesn't know it's going up the hill.
1422521|LMP|Looks to me like you may be able to head just like you're going.
1422523|CDR|Yes. Hey, Bob, we'll make it.
1422525|LMP|And get down - -
1422526|CDR|Yes. We will make it. Get my antenna adjusted.
1422541|LMP|Okay. Whatever makes up the light mantle is - in - at least, the instant rock that it forms is much lighter than anything we see. Those fragments probably - are 30 percent lighter than any fragments we see on the dark mantle. And that's around the fresh craters. But it is not blocky. Bob, are you still reading?
1422620|CC|Roger. Read you loud and clear.
1422623|LMP|Okay, I just wanted to make sure my antenna's working.
1422626|CC|Roger.
1422627|CDR|We're doing a little zig-zag navigation. I'm - literally came up a slope at about a heading of 240. We couldn't get through the actual turn to the south because there is a big crater right at the foot of it. So we're just making our way through some relatively local undulating slopes that get pretty steep, but it seems to be no problem.
1422649|LMP|Yes, I think we're in good shape. Bob, I can't - there are not any blocks big enough to really make a statement about what the rock is. But it - it really doesn't look like gabbro anymore.
1422705|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1422706|LMP|It doesn't have that - -
1422706|CC|And a reminder that eventually you're going to have to turn to the south a little bit to pick up - the final thing at the - Station 2.
1422716|LMP|We're not on top of that scarp, yet. We're still in the Hole-in-the-Wall rim.
1422720|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1422726|LMP|Bob, as far as lineations in the soil or on the surface that are observable at this range, I don't - I don't see any. I think there may be a finer raindrop pattern on the light mantle than maybe there was out on the dark. But that's an awfully hard judgment to make.
1422750|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1422755|LMP|How you doing, Geno?
1422757|CDR|Doing fine, Bob. We've slowed down between about 5 to 8 - maybe 5 to 10 clicks most of the time. I'm going to head right up there, I think. Get around this crater.
1422807|LMP|Pretty healthy roll you're going to have here.
1422809|CDR|Yes, I'm going to head more straight up the hill. Once I get up on top, I'll be alright. I'm going to head down in this hole and then up that way.
1422816|LMP|Yes, I think -
1422816|CDR|I don't mind pitch, but I sure don't like roll.
1422819|LMP|I don't either.
1422827|CDR|Now I'm going to head straight up - I'm going to head straight up that slope right there. Okay?
1422848|PAO|Ron Evans performing infrared, ultraviolet, laser altimeter experiments.
1422852|LMP|Bob, I still - it looks like maybe the large fragments in here are still crystalline. They have white zap pits on them. But they do not yet really resemble the gabbro.
1422909|CC|Okay, Jack. Copy that. Give us a hack when you get up on top of the scarp there.
1422915|LMP|Okay.
1422916|CMP|Let me tell you, Bob, I've got to go cross-slope some of the time because the Rover is really working to go uphill now.
1422924|CC|All right.
1422925|CDR|But we're almost there.
1422928|LMP|As I look up the scarp to the west, there are some big blocks scattered around on the horizon; but, again, I would guess that we're not dealing with more than - 2 or 3 percent total coverage of blocks in here, at that.
1422947|CDR|Well, I think, for the most part - for the most part, we're on top ... - -
1422951|LMP|Yes, we're - we're on top.
1422955|CDR|Bob, we're at 7.8 - correction 078, 7.2, and 6.2.
1423001|CC|Copy that.
1423003|CDR|Jack, where was Nansen with respect to those tracks up there?
1423007|LMP|Well, they never really had any good tracks pinned down, I don't think, on that - You'll be able to see Nansen, I think soon as you get over this hill.
1423015|CDR|Boy, I tell you, when we look back, that's going to be quite a sight if we can see into that Sun. We have been coming uphill. Well, I'd say this is the - this is the last straw to the top. And is she working! Come on, baby.
1423036|LMP|Okay. I think you bear -
1423039|CDR|I'm going to try to get over along the base of the massif now.
1423041|LMP|Yes. Head towards that track area there, anyway. There are a lot of boulder tracks coming down from the blue-gray rocks, Bob. We'll see whether or not we're going to get to those tracks at Nansen, or we might want to move over to the track and see if we can find the boulder that made them.
1423102|CC|Okay; if they're in the vicinity, it might be a nice idea - -
1423104|LMP|But there's no question where those tracks come from.
1423107|CC|And we gather you're slowing down to about 5 clicks now, coming up this last rise.
1423114|CDR|Yes, I'm back up to about 7 to 10 now, Bob. That'a the slowdown - is because that's about all it will take.
1423122|LMP|Bob, I have the impression that there is a dipping zone of blue-gray outcrops, or block concentrations up there on the Massif, that trends from the high point just beneath the Earth - cross-slope - and probably is - at least the apparent dip is - oh, I don't know, 10 or 15 degrees to the east. It looks like those outcrops may match up along that trend.
1423200|CC|Okay.
1423200|CDR|Jack, I'm going to head right along this ridge because I think that's the depression we were talking about.
1423204|LMP|Yes, That's Nansen down there.
1423206|CDR|Right - Where are you looking?
1423207|LMP|I think, right below -
1423209|CDR|I think you're right. I think that's it. Let me get over here, and then I'll head a little bit to the south.
1423216|LMP|Yes, we're a little more west, I think, than we intended to be.
1423219|CDR|Yes, I think you're right.
1423220|LMP|Bob, 7 - Wait a minute - 7.8 and 6.5.
1423239|LMP|Bob, I've had an impression, and I can't prove it yet, that we're dealing with more heterogeneous rock. Possibly there are breccias in here. But it's - it's - awfully hard to tell right now. They're very light-colored rocks - I think even lighter colored than the gabbros.
1423308|CC|Okay. We'll soon find out.
1423315|LMP|I'm afraid those - I think we can follow those tracks - the pictures, maybe, or -
1423323|CDR|Yes, I think we can see some of those coming down.
1423325|LMP|I think the ones from the big outcrop of blue-gray rock, though, are the ones going into Nansen.
1423330|CDR|Bob, my best guess - let's see - 077, 7.7, 6.6 - is that we're coming up on the northern side of Nansen.
1423341|CC|Okay. We copy that, Geneo.
1423345|CDR|And, let me tell you, this is quite a Rover ride.
1423349|CC|It sure sounds like it.
1423355|CDR|But it's quite a machine, I tell you. I think it would do a lot more than we'd let it.
1423406|LMP|(Laughter) That's right. I think that big crater up there on the side is the one that you can see in the photographs, just above Station 2.
1423419|CDR|Yes. I think if I come up here, do a hard left turn; you unbuckle your belt, you'll roll right down into the bottom of Nansen.
1423425|LMP|I'm afraid you're right. ...
1423426|CC|Okay. And remember we're going to about 068 and about 7.4 will be Station 2. At least that's our estimate.
1423434|LMP|Bob - -
1423435|CDR|Okay, there's Nansen over there, huh?
1423438|LMP|Well, I think so.
1423439|CDR|Yes. I think you're right. It's got to be it. Got to be it.
1423447|LMP|Yes, Bob, I think we're into a breccia population now. I think the blocks in the light mantle are largely breccias. They're mottled in their characteristics. The white zaps do not seem to be nearly as apparent. They tend to be chalky when they get hit. At least, in the large craters, the walls are chalk - chalky looking. Oh, yes. We've got boulders in Station 2.
1423521|CDR|Yes, they're there.
1423522|LMP|Yes, sir. Boy, I tell you, if I hang on to this camera until you stop and can tighten it up, it'll be a miracle.
1423533|CDR|Bob, how long have we been driving?
1423535|CC|Stand by. We estimate you've got about a kilometer and a half to go - a little over a kilometer, anyway. Stand by, we'll check on the time. You're doing great.
1423542|CDR|How long in - -
1423545|PAO|We're 2 hours into the EVA.
1423549|LMP|Man, this has been a trip.
1423551|CDR|Man, I tell you. You know, we're really up on top of this thing. Whoo!
1423554|CC|You guys have been driving 64 minutes, and that counts the time to stop and deploy the charge and pick up the Rover samples.
1423604|LMP|Hey, Bob. We're very clearly going downhill now, into the trough area that - that surrounds the Massif where - or between the mantle and the massif. But the trough is much greater in extent than just Nansen scale. It's probably a kilometer wide. I never realized that it was so - so much of a depression in here.
1423632|CC|Okay. How about a range and bearing readout.
1423633|LMP|I'm not sure we're going to be able to see the LM.
1423637|CDR|074, 8.2, 6.9.
1423641|CC|Copy that.
1423641|CDR|We won't be able to see the LM from down here. We'll be too low to see it. Fact is, I don't think I can see that far.
1423657|LMP|The surface patterns are still the same, Bob. The main difference being that we're getting probably a gradual increase in block population, and the blocks seem to be of a different character. They - they may be breccias.
1423717|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1423718|LMP|And around the crater here that's maybe 75 meters in diameter, the - there's probably 5 percent blocks - fragments, I should say - greater than a centimeter.
1423733|CDR|Boy, look at all the dust around that fender. I hate to think of what it would have been like with that fender gone.
1423737|LMP|Yes. There's a good-sized block, sort of blue-gray.
1423744|CDR|Looking up there, Jack, I ought to get some 500s looking right up that hill, but - -
1423747|LMP|Well, you may want to do that way out a way, a ways.
1423751|CDR|It's - some of that stuff is mantled - or buried in the massif material. Some of it just seems to be laying on it, of course.
1423801|LMP|Yes. Well, I think it has to do with how long it's been there. You'll tend to get the downslope movements forming uphill fillets, and that's what a lot of it looks like.
1423812|CDR|Most of it is uphill fillets. Most of it is pretty sharp. But my guess, from back at the LM, that those blocks on the massif were much more angular, I think is a good guess because that's what they look like to me here.
1423831|LMP|And looking up into our blue-gray outcrop urea, I still have even more the impression that there's; a - a planier (?) orientation that dips off to the southeast - maybe just fracturing, but I - pretty clear up there, I think. It may - it may be shadows.
1423853|CDR|The LM is now 50 percent away from the massif - let's see, 50 percent of the massif height away from the massif. How's that? I think we will keep that on top.
1423903|LMP|That is a high mountain.
1423905|CDR|Gemine Christmas!
1423907|LMP|Listen, if the Earth goes behind it, we're changing Station 2. (Laughter) it'll be nip and tuck, pardon the expression. Okay. As we get closer, actually, we're out of the very - the block area. And that blocky region of 5 percent may have been just associated with that crater. I still see no lineations although - -
1423934|CDR|Look at these wrinkles, though, Jack - -
1423936|LMP|Yes. I mean on - I was talking about the mantle.
1423938|CDR|Oh.
1423938|LMP|But you're right about on the massif.
1423941|CDR|The same wrinkled lineations we saw trending - sloping uphill to the west on the eastern half of the massif are still very evident at this Sun angle.
1423955|CC|Okay, 17; And we're estimating that you should be there within about 5 minutes to meet the walkback constraints.
1424003|CDR|Well, we're - Bob, we're almost ready to park.
1424006|CC|Okay. Beautiful.
1424015|LMP|Well, I wouldn't have gone so far as to say that.
1424017|CDR|Well -
1424019|LMP|We're getting close.
1424022|CDR|I'll give them their 5 minutes. We'll make it by then.
1424026|LMP|Bob, the boulder tracks are really just chains of small craters, for the most part.
1424047|CC|Okay; copy that. That's interesting.
1424049|CDR|I don't think we can tilt that television - I don't think they can tilt the television camera high enough to see the top of the massif. Jack, we're on the edge here, but I don't know - is that that - Well, let me go up here.
1424109|LMP|No, you're doing great.
1424111|CDR|Brazil 71, 8.9, and 7.4.
1424116|LMP|See, there's Nansen off to my right now.
1424117|CDR|Yes, I just want to make sure that I'm not driving down a hole here, which I am, but - I don't want to drive down Nansen.
1424127|LMP|No, I - you won't. The saddle - the end of Nansen is over there near those blocks. Right over there.
1424142|LMP|Look at those blocks. Unfortunately, the boulder tracks - good boulder tracks are over into Nansen.
1424153|CDR|Going out of here very slowly.
1424157|LMP|I think station - just about anywhere near the big blocks - -
1424202|CDR|Yes.
1424203|LMP|- - would be a good Station 2.
1424204|CDR|That's where I'm going to put it. We could try to -
1424214|LMP|Let's see.
1424217|CDR|Yes, that's where we're going to make Station 2; right up there.
1424220|LMP|What? Straight ahead?
1424221|CDR|Yes.
1424222|LMP|Yes. Okay.
1424224|CDR|Boy, you're looking right into Nansen.
1424227|LMP|Yes. We're right where we wanted to be for Station 2. And it looks like a great place. Big blocks. It looks like quite a bit of variety from here. Different colors, anyway. Grays and lighter colored tans.
1424245|CDR|Hey, Jack, I'm going to do a 180 and park the Rover at 045.
1424254|LMP|Those are two good - there's a blue-gray rock and a lighter colored tan rock.
1424258|CDR|See where they can look in here.
1424300|PAO|We'll have television shortly after they've parked. Station 2 is right at the face of the South Massif.
1424302|LMP|How about - Are you going to park it?
1424304|CDR|Right on the other side of this little crater. ... heading ...
1424306|CC|... heading.
1424307|CDR|... 45
1424321|CDR|Hey, Bob. You want to hazard a guess? It is 0. ... 9.1, 7.6. Are you reading, by the way?
1424335|CC|Roger. Reading you loud and clear.
1424340|CDR|Okay. Let me get undone here. Amp hours are 98, 98. Batteries are 90 and 112, and the motor forward left is OFFSCALE LOW, and right is 340. Forward rear is OFFSCALE LOW, and right is 240. I expect we've got a bad meter.
1424408|CC|Okay. Copy that on the 340. And you want to give me the bearing one more time there, Gene. All I got was the distance at 9.1 and the heading - and the range.
1424421|CDR|Yes, sir. 0.1, 9.1, 7.6. We are right at Station 2.
1424429|LMP|Look at Nansen.
1424432|CC|Okay. We copy that. When you're at the station, here's a couple of things - -
1424434|CDR|My goodness gracious -
1424435|CC|- - we'd like for you guys to look at in the overhead. In addition to them. We'd like the TV lens to be dusted, in addition to the regular dusting. That'll take the lens brush, remember.
1424444|LMP|Can you try to tighten that?
1424446|CC|You might check the low gain antella - antenna elevation to make sure it's at 45 degrees. We'd like - we think you commented on that. And I think you're right now looking at tightening Jack's camera handle.
1424500|LMP|I'll work on that, Gene. You go ahead with the other - -
1424502|CDR|Okay. Yes, we are at 45 degrees, Bob. Let me check it. I'll lose the comm on you a second. I've got to turn it towards me.
1424517|CDR|... at 045.
1424524|CC|And, 17. Jack, we'd like you to check the SEP for us. I suspect we'll have to turn it off and open the mirrors and dust them.
1424538|CDR|Boy, when you get this picture -
1424550|PAO|TV coming in now.
1424551|CDR|You got HIGH GAIN.
1424553|CC|Roger. Thank you. We have TV.
1424605|CC|Geno, we did not get a good bearing from you guys.
1424606|CDR|Oh, Manischewitz!
1424609|CC|We might also check the LMP's camera.
1424610|CDR|Okay. I'll give it to you again.
1424615|LMP|That's fixed. Oh, you mean for pictures?
1424619|CC|Roger. ... - -
1424619|LMP|Okay, LMP -
1424628|CDR|Okay, 071 - 071 is the bearing.
1424633|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1424635|LMP|142 on LM - 142 on the LMP's camera. The temperature is 105.
1424648|CC|Roger. Let's turn off the power and the recorder, open the blankets, and dust it.
1424657|LMP|Power's off, blankets are open; and, Gene, you'll have to dust it.
1424706|CDR|I'll get it. I've got a lot of dusting to do here, Jack.
1424711|LMP|Okay. Let's see what we've got to do.
1424714|CC|And, Jack, I presume when I told you, you turned off the receiver, didn't you? Not just the DSEA?
1424721|LMP|That's affirm. I turned off both switches.
1424724|CC|That's what I thought. Thank you.
1424726|LMP|Oh, my scoop. My scoop just came off. That's interesting. I'd better check the rake. Vibrated loose, I guess.
1424754|CDR|I'll get the battery covers.
1424755|CC|Okay; and Jack, we'd like to get an EMU check on you.
1424801|LMP|Stand by.
1424815|CC|And, Jack, we'd like to go to India on the magazine for you.
1424829|PAO|Gene Cernan in the foreground.
1424836|LMP|Okay, magazine India. My goodness, we'll never get started.
1424842|CDR|Man, we are down in a dep- Look at where we came down, Jack.
1424845|PAO|Jack Schmitt in the picture, now.
1424847|CDR|And that was just one of the hills. Got to go back up and then down some. Hey, thank you for that fix on the fender, by the way, because I'd hate to see what it would look like without it.
1424909|CC|Okay. And John suggests that we might just check it momentarily while you're here to make sure it's still holding on good and tight. Both the clamps and the tape.
1424917|CDR|Yes, that's on my - that's on my list. If it stayed on through that ride it may never come off. Okay. Have you got a lens brush in there, Jack?
1424941|LMP|Yes.
1424942|CDR|Well, hold it a minute. I've got to get this SEP. Do you want me to brush the SEP, is that what you said?
1424945|LMP|Yes.
1424948|CDR|Do you want the covers open?
1424951|LMP|They should be open and dusted.
1424957|CDR|Okay. The SEP is open. It's about 100 degrees.
1425000|LMP|105 ...
1425001|CDR|105? Okay. And it's dusted.
1425011|LMP|Here's your lens brush; if you need it.
1425012|CDR|Okay, thank you. That camera look all right to you? Let me get yours; lean over here, and I'll get yours. Okay. I'll get mine, too.
1425038|CC|And, Jack, we're suggesting that you're getting a little warm - maybe intermediate might help.
1425044|LMP|Bob, I feel the same way, but I want to get this camera fixed.
1425048|CC|Okay.
1425050|LMP|I mean the film changed.
1425051|CC|Okay.
1425057|CDR|Can I change your oil?
1425101|CC|Oh, thank you, Geno. It looks much better.
1425113|CDR|How about Any other service I can be?
1425118|LMP|Okay. Okay, Houston, the number of blocks plotted on the map are not nearly enough. In the greater than 1-meter range, there are many hundred blocks on the flank of - on the massif flank of Nansen, and up around Station 2, where we are. There are only one or two blocks on the light mantle side of Nansen. It looks as if the material in the bottom of Nansen is overriding the light mantle materials of the north wall. That's just an impression. There's slightly lighter albedo than the north wall of Nansen.
1425212|CC|Okay. Copy that, Jack. Looks fantastic up there.
1425216|LMP|And I suggest that we - I suggest that we do our raking - That's right. I just told you everything you can see - fairly close to the Rover to get some of the general population of talus material coming off the massif.
1425244|CDR|Bob, on my mark - I've got everything - hammer, gnomon, film. Okay.
1425254|CDR|MARK, If you have a gravimeter measurement going.
1425256|CC|Roger. Copy the mark.
1425301|LMP|Okay, Bob. The blue-gray rocks are breccias. They're multilithic, gray matrix - matrix breccias, I guess. There are fragments in them, but it doesn't look like more than about 10 or 15 percent fragments. Some of the light - the light-colored fragments seem to have fine-grained - very finegrained dark halos around them. The zap pits do not have white halos, so I suspect they are not crystalline. They might be glass - they might be the vitric or glassy breccias. At least, the one big rock we have here.
1425352|CC|Copy that.
1425353|LMP|There's a rough, very rough, foliation in them - that - that and I'm not sure - it's shown by the elongate knobs on the surface - it looks like a fracture foliation of some kind.
1425411|CDR|Jack, that rock has almost got to have come down, don't you think?
1425412|LMP|Oh, no question about it. I'll bet you - I'll bet you it's the same as the blue-gray rocks we see up higher. Here's some more blue-gray ones over here.
1425420|CDR|Let's - let's start taking - Oh, yes. Look at the size of some of these light fragments in here.
1425425|LMP|Yes, but it still - I don't - it looks like they're dominantly matrix breccias. There - there are light-colored fragments, and they may be crystalline.
1425438|CDR|Okay -
1425438|LMP|Yes, they are. They're very light colored; they look like the shattered anorthosites. They have white halos - I xhink that's what those fragments are.
1425452|CDR|Jack, let's get a piece of this one right here.
1425454|LMP|Okay.
1425455|CDR|Biggest one here.
1425456|LMP|Get her up. This is the blue-gray variety, Houston.
1425504|CC|Okay. Copy on that.
1425511|CDR|I'm going to take that little knob off up there.
1425513|LMP|Okay; well, you can sample - you can work that block over.
1425516|CDR|Yes.
1425517|LMP|We can get several examples. We ought to sample across that layering, actually - that foliation.
1425524|CDR|One comment. When you look down into the bottom of Nansen, it looks like - like, I guess - which sounds obvious - that some of the debris that has rolled off of the South Massif covers up the original material there that covers the north wall of Nansen. There is a distinct difference. You've got that very wrinkled texture in the north slopes of Nansen, and you've got the South Massif - debris in the south slopes of Nansen. And the debris, of course, overlays the - the north slope. And all the rock fragments, all the boulders that have come down are all on the west side of the - of the - correction, on the south side of the slope of Nansen.
1425612|CC|Okay; got that.
1425613|LMP|Okay, Houston. I take back what I said about no halos. There are light - not very sharply light - but light halos around zap pits in the matrix. The matrix glass is dark, and it seems to have a greenish cast; but it's very dark.
1425632|CDR|Oh, look at that blue.
1425634|LMP|Oh.
1425635|CDR|Look at the white fragments in there.
1425642|LMP|Let me come and help you there.
1425643|CDR|Man, there's some boulder rolling rocks here, Jack.
1425646|LMP|(Laughter) Okay, don't wreck the fillets. There's an overhang we've got to get into.
1425656|LMP|Okay. 514 is the - Okay, I'll take it back. On the fresh surface, these look like fragment breccias although the fragment size is fairly small. There are dark gray framgents and the light fragments we talked about. The gray ones are very fine grained and dense, although I see flashes that indicate they may be crystalline. The light-colored fragments are as I described them earlier, I think.
1425727|CC|Copy that.
1425730|LMP|514. ... - -
1425734|CC|Okay; Jack. If you could tear yourself away in the middle of that sometime to give us an EMU read-out, we'd appreciate it. We haven't gotten that from you yet on the EVA.
1425742|LMP|Okay. I'm - Stand by. Gene's got a rock to go. That's from up higher?
1425751|CDR|That's a little higher. See that shelf up there?
1425752|LMP|Okay. The first rock was from about a - 514 was from a meter above the base of the rocks; 515 is from about a meter and a half.
1425803|CDR|Here, can I get this in your -
1425808|LMP|Can you get some on either side of those two now?
1425811|CDR|Yes.
1425817|LMP|Okay. You're open. I'll leave you open for a minute.
1425820|CDR|Well, okay. Just so they don't fall out. Am I in?
1425823|LMP|No. Let me get this other one.
1425824|CDR|Okay.
1425830|LMP|Okay, go ahead.
1425834|CDR|Let me try from back here.
1425837|LMP|Of course, that's a north/south overhang.
1425839|CDR|Yes. That one?
1425842|LMP|Yes, you're facing right into the east.
1425843|CDR|Yes, yes. I don't know if I can get a piece back here or not.
1425846|LMP|How about right where you ... yes.
1425848|CDR|Right here? I can get that.
1425850|LMP|Yes, that's good.
1425852|CDR|Oh, beautiful. Hit the gnomon.
1425853|CDR|Well, I'll re - -
1425855|LMP|It didn't move. It just tilted it.
1425856|CDR|This it?
1425857|LMP|Yes, that's it right there.
1425905|LMP|Let me set my working tool down here.
1425910|CDR|Got a bag?
1425911|LMP|Coming right up. Boy, that dust. Once you get it on there, you might as well forget it.
1425919|LMP|494. 494 is from a half a meter above the base of the rock.
1425925|CC|Understand, 0.5 meters up.
1425925|LMP|And these are samples from across the layering - or the - These are samples from - across the - foliation. I missed that, Bob.
1425938|CC|Okay. Copy that now.
1425940|LMP|What do you think? Can you get that - can you get that one up there?
1425945|CDR|Yes. I might either get that or this other piece up here. Without busting my butt.
1425950|LMP|Well, don't take any chances.
1425950|CDR|Yes, I'm not going to. How about this one? Here's a whole big piece.
1425958|LMP|Okay. That's a good - good representative fragment. Did you get it?
1430003|CDR|I can't reach you without my camera hitting.
1430005|LMP|That's a football-size fragment. Okay, this next sample - Can you get a bag out, and we'll try to put it around it. Around the end. Bob, it's highly variable. This is a light matrix breccia; whereas the other three fragments were dark-matrix or dark-fragment breccias. The big rock is a light-matrix breccia with dark fragments, and it's the one that has the halos around the - around the light fragments. And that's in 495 barely. It's not even in it. It's just - 495 is wrapped around it.
1430053|CDR|It's not going to stay.
1430054|LMP|It's not going to stay, is it?
1430056|CDR|No. Well -
1430058|LMP|It's a football-size fragmental rock. Let me - Why don't you just stuff it. See if you can stuff it in there with that - with the bag down - -
1430109|CDR|Yes, it'll - We'll be able to identify it when we get - 495 when we get back. Okay, it'll stay.
1430114|LMP|Is the bag on it now?
1430114|CC|Okay; we copy that, Gene. And do you guys see any tracks coming down to these boulders? Do have any feeling that these - you can place these that way?
1430115|CDR|Well, yes, - it's ...
1430116|LMP|Great.
1430126|LMP|Bob, unfortunately, no. The main tracks are out into Nansen, and we - I don't think we can get over there.
1430132|CC|Okay; that's those biggies that we see on the left, huh?
1430134|LMP|But the visual resi - Yes. Coming up, I was looking; and there are no obvious tracks coming down here.
1430144|CDR|Watch your shadow, Jack.
1430144|LMP|Yes, I'll get it. Wait a minute; that gnomon is probably not - Well, that's right; you got stereo earlier.
1430149|CDR|Yes, I reset it.
1430150|LMP|The gnomon was moved a little between the samples.
1430153|CC|Okay. We copy that.
1430154|LMP|Do you need to take a vertical pan?
1430156|CDR|Yes, I've gotten it all. I'm getting it all.
1430158|LMP|You getting the flight line? I'll get a flight line this way. Postsample, flight line.
1430215|CDR|Okay, Bob. I'm on frame count 42.
1430218|CC|Copy, 42.
1430222|CDR|Did you get a locator from here, Jack?
1430223|LMP|Yes.
1430224|CDR|Okay.
1430232|LMP|Okay. I got flight line on the north/south trend; Gene got east/west.
1430238|CDR|You going to get that sample under there?
1430240|LMP|Yes, we got to get the soil.
1430242|CDR|There may be an overhang. And look at that frag - that rack - rock is fragmented; let's see, but it's east - it's southeast/northwest. There's a split.
1430254|LMP|Yes, that one right over there is okay. You want to get - hey, did you want to get this?
1430258|CDR|Yes, I'll get that.
1430258|LMP|This fillet?
1430259|CDR|You got it?
1430302|CC|And, 17 - -
1430303|LMP|This is a fillet from underneath the rock.
1430305|CC|Roger. And an update on the rake samples when you get around to it. We'd like to get one up on the massif slope as much as you can, if you can get over to it. And then the second one down near the Rover.
1430318|CDR|Okay.
1430320|LMP|Okay, Bob. This fillet is up underneath an overhang. I got it from about -
1430330|CDR|I got to get uphill from you.
1430334|LMP|It's about - -
1430337|CDR|That's good.
1430339|LMP|- - oh, a third of a meter under an overhand. And it's the upper 3 centimeters of soil.
1430349|CDR|And it's bag 496.
1430351|LMP|Now let me get one out away from the overhand a little bit.
1430356|CDR|- Okay.
1430357|CC|Okay. You think that's permanent shadow?
1430359|LMP|And a one away from - - No.
1430402|CDR|No. It's facing east.
1430404|CC|Okay.
1430406|LMP|Okay. And a sample down to a depth of about 5 centimeters, about two-thirds of a meter from the - boulder - the south side - is in 497.
1430425|CC|Copy that.
1430428|LMP|Now let me - let me get a skim sample, Geno.
1430430|CDR|Okay. I've got to take a set of pictures after that, by the way. Show where they are.
1430441|LMP|I can piece them into my flight line stereo.
1430444|CDR|Okay. They were in both of the before pictures on those rocks.
1430449|LMP|Okay; about a centimeter deep - skim.
1430456|CDR|Careful. You're in a hole. Can you - you better come out.
1430500|LMP|Yes.
1430507|CDR|Boy, that's hard on the hand even in 1/6 g.
1430510|LMP|Okay.
1430512|CDR|And that was - -
1430515|LMP|Okay.
1430517|CDR|And I didn't park that Rover in a very good spot for them to watch what's going on, I guess; but that was the heading.
1430522|LMP|Oh, shoot. They're missing all of it.
1430524|CDR|We didn't work in the right spot; that's all.
1430527|CC|Every now and then we get a peek at you guys. But only every now and then.
1430530|CDR|Okay, I - Sorry, Bob.
1430540|LMP|Oh, wait a minute.
1430543|CDR|You know, that's the way it happens.
1430545|CC|Give sample bag number, please.
1430546|CDR|Okay. It's back on.
1430549|LMP|Okay, Bob. I missed that. I didn't give it to you; but I think - well the next bag I take out, you can check the num - Well, wait a minute, I'll do it for you.
1430602|CC|No. That's okay. I suspect it's 498.
1430603|LMP|I'm almost positive it was 498.
1430605|CC|Okay. We'll put that down.
1430607|LMP|Yes, I did, too.
1430616|LMP|Okay, Bob, the - looking at the blocks directly down-Sun, there are - the light gray, or the gray-matrix breccias seem to be fragments, or ... anyway, within the white-matrix breccias.
1430641|CC|Okay. I copy that.
1430645|LMP|And I got a couple pictures down-Sun to show that texture.
1430649|CC|Okay. And one thing we'd like to do would be to sample a variety of blocks, in terms of looking at differences in the blocks - from block to block.
1430659|LMP|Roger. We're going to do that. We're going after a gray - I mean a lighter-colored block, now. Are you going up there?
1430705|CDR|Yes.
1430706|CC|Okay, and if you're going up the massif, why don't we try and get the rake sample up there now, when you finish these rocks.
1430713|CDR|Hey, Jack - Jack, don't come up here unless you bring the rake. It's a long trip. No sense coming up here twice. I can go get this sample. I'd get the rake, If I were you. Don't walk back up twice.
1430726|LMP|Well, I don't - I'm not sure they're going to gain anything by coming up to the top.
1430731|CDR|Okay.
1430733|LMP|You're not going to gain a thing, Bob.
1430736|CC|Stand by.
1430736|LMP|You're still on the talus. You guys - Oh, well. The rims of the small craters in the talus are - are softer than the - normal terrain. My foot goes in maybe 10 centimeters where normally it only goes in a centimeter.
1430759|CC|Okay. As long as it's above the break of the slope, Jack, we don't have to get very far up the slope.
1430805|LMP|That's right.
1430806|CC|And, Jack, if you're back at the Rover, how about giving us a grav reading when you - before you leave.
1430814|LMP|Because I'm late sampling, that's why. But I'll do it, anyway.
1430818|CC|Roger.
1430823|LMP|Okay, 670 155 201; 670 155 201.
1430832|CC|Okay. Copy that, Jack. Press on.
1430837|CDR|Okay, Bob, I'm at another boulder up the slope here. It's - looks quite similar to the one we just sampled, except there is a lot of flake fractures on it. Non-uniform, nondirectional, but quite - quite different, at least from that other rock, in terms of the fracture patterns. The texture looks to be quite similar. Boy, I'm glad I don't have to walk to the top of this thing.
1430909|LMP|Hey, look, Gene, on these rake samples, there is just no point in carrying a rake all the way up here - -
1430915|CC|Negative, Jack, as long as you're above the break - -
1430916|LMP|- - because all we needed was a break in the slope.
1430918|CC|As long as you're above the break in the slope; that's right.
1430921|LMP|Well, that's all right. It's being done; but let's watch those kind of calls please.
1430928|CDR|They can't appreciate the - toughness of going up this slope, though. We can; we've got to tell them that.
1430933|LMP|Well, we did.
1430934|CC|Yes, that's what we were saying. Don't go above - just at the base of the break in the slope, Jack. Don't climb all the way up there with it.
1430940|LMP|Oh, relax.
1430942|CDR|Okay, we're all set, Bob. No problem ...
1430954|LMP|We want to get away from that big rock because it's probably shedding. Hey, that's a different rock, Gene.
1431000|CDR|Yes. Well, it looks like the same texture, but it's got that flaky fracture pattern all over it. I'm going to get a stereo while I'm at it.
1431012|LMP|Yes.
1431016|CDR|This ought to cover any samples I take off of that thing.
1431025|LMP|I'm going to get myself a zap of cold water.
1431036|CDR|Man, we've got to be a million miles away from the LM.
1431041|LMP|Okay, this is a crystalline rock, Houston. It's got nice white halos around the zap pits. The zap is - the zaps are not - dense black glass, but a dark greenish - very dark greenish-gray.
1431059|CDR|Are those halos or fragments?
1431101|LMP|No, they're halos. Well, they are fragments, I think, also. But, right now, it's fairly crystalline, but it is heterogeneous. Matter of fact (laughter) there's a big fragment of a porphyry caught up in this thing, I think.
1431117|CDR|Did you get a locator, by any chance?
1431118|LMP|I haven't done a thing.
1431119|CDR|Okay. Well, I want to start taking some - -
1431122|LMP|Yes, we got to get some of that.
1431123|CDR|That's what I want. That's where I'm going right now.
1431126|LMP|And there's a chunk there we can get. That's a big fragment within this crystalline rock - -
1431130|CDR|Take a picture of that - -
1431131|LMP|- - inclusion.
1431133|CDR|Take a picture of that and then - and then - your locator, I'll get it.
1431138|LMP|Go ahead. I've got it.
1431158|LMP|Get it?
1431159|CDR|Yes, I've got it.
1431201|LMP|Beautiful. Looks like a porphyry.
1431203|CDR|Boy, it does look like a crystalline rock.
1431204|LMP|Looks like an anorthosite porphyry is what it looks like.
1431207|CDR|The ... has got the very large crystals in there. They're very - they're very reflective, elongated crystals.
1431217|LMP|It's a relatively angular inclusion about - it's about a half a meter in size, and it's a square cross section. Well, it's irregular; but generally square cross section. It's in bag 516, and it looks like a - well it's a high feldspar rock. It may be an anorthositic gabbro, but it is - it does look like a porphyry.
1431257|CDR|There's a big chunk where I've got - I can't get it out, though; it's buried in a rock - a very - oh, half an inch elongated - I can't see whether they are colorless or not, but they are certainly reflective crystals. See that up here? See right there?
1431318|LMP|Yes.
1431319|CDR|And then in the big rock, you've got massive things like this big - this big fragment here, that's 5 inches across.
1431324|LMP|Well, it - that may be a spall point, Gene, that's a lighter color, in general, because of a zap or something.
1431332|CDR|Let's get the - let me get some more samples of it.
1431333|LMP|Yes, we need to get some of the host rock here.
1431335|CDR|Okay. We'll get a piece here.
1431337|LMP|Okay now, you're still sampling the one we just got. So we'll get another one.
1431345|LMP|Okay. The same kind - or the contact of that rock looks very much - looks like it might be finer grained - but it's about the same - in 517. That's the contact in the - the inclusion side of the contact. Keep going after the other one, Gene, I'll get this in you - your bag.
1431411|CDR|Bob, you could probably see this rock if you look over this way. We're high enough.
1431415|CC|Yes, we saw it, Geno. Quite a sight - quite a goodie.
1431419|CDR|Okay. Let me see if I can't get this one here. There it is.
1431426|LMP|Okay. The host rock for the inclusion, which appears to be also crystalline, but may be a recrystallized rock of some kind - -
1431434|CDR|Can't see it too well.
1431435|LMP|- - metamorphic - also looks like a high plagioclase - high feldspar, anyway. That's in bag 518 - and that was a loose frag - fairly loose but in place fragment along the fracture zone.
1431459|CC|Okay. - -
1431459|CDR|Will you hold this a minute? I'm going to try to get the rest of it up there.
1431502|CC|Okay, 17. And for your thinking in the next few minutes, you might also factor in the guestion the backroom raises about taking 10 minutes out Station 4 and adding it into this station, given the wealth of interest that seems to be occurring here. You might think about that. You never - haven't been to Station 4, so it's a little hard to judge. But if you think 10 minutes can be very profitably spent, you might as well do that.
1431526|LMP|Okay, Bob, we'll think about it. This is a medium-green anorthositic gabbro, and it looks like it has some pastel-green allovane (?) crystals in it. Did you get it?
1431539|CC|We copy that.
1431540|CDR|I can't get any more of it, Jack, up there. I can't reach any more.
1431541|LMP|Okay, and that small chip of that is in 519. It's the same host rock, much like the previous sample.
1431552|CDR|There's a good sample for you.
1431553|LMP|Okay. And another - chunk of the host -
1431559|CDR|Oops, be careful.
1431600|LMP|Yes.
1431601|CDR|It's still there.
1431601|LMP|Yes, I've got it. I need to get this - rid of this - -
1431607|CDR|Okay?
1431608|LMP|It's in there. I haven't closed your bag yet. And we've got to get a - get one soil sample up the hill here. Oh, we didn't get the rake -
1431621|CDR|We ought to get a soil sample, though, up here, so - -
1431623|LMP|We'll get the rake sample right over here on this slope.
1431624|CDR|Where did that thing go, Jack?
1431627|LMP|Right here.
1431628|CC|Okay. Was that last sample in 518, as well?
1431629|CDR|There it is. That's it right there.
1431634|LMP|No. We haven't put it in yet.
1431636|CC|Okay.
1431638|CDR|Bob, that will go in 499?
1431639|CC|Copy that.
1431643|CDR|You get it?
1431649|LMP|Okay. Bob, this is a fairly uniform-looking rock. It does have some - widely spaced fractures across it. It's - clearly crystalline and has crystalline Inclusions in it.
1431708|CDR|Hey, Jack - -
1431709|CC|Copy that.
1431709|CDR|Might get the soil from around that thing.
1431712|LMP|Both rocks look like they might be in the anorthositic class - -
1431716|CDR|Your bag is still open part way, too.
1431718|LMP|- - of rocks. It's just that it - one is - has the appearance of being a por - finer grain matrix. Looks like a porphyry in - in the boulder.
1431729|CC|Okay. And a reminder, as you photograph it, to remember that the photograph in the southwest quadrant there will be the best ones, around the corner on two sides there will be the best ones to show the structure through the whole rock.
1431742|LMP|Yes, sir. On the southwest?
1431745|CDR|South and west.
1431746|CC|Roger.
1431746|LMP|South and west. Yes.
1431747|CC|Roger.
1431748|LMP|No, the west's in shade. No, no. You mean the -
1431753|CC|Southwest -
1431753|LMP|South and east.
1431754|CC|Roger. The southwest face - or it faces not quite south.
1431802|CDR|Okay. I've got a stereo - I'll just continue my stereo around here. Hey, Jack, you can get way under there, and I know you could get soil. I don't know how long it's been shadowed, but it's been shadowed as long as this rock's been here.
1431813|LMP|Okay. I'll do that.
1431814|CDR|Way out under there.
1431817|LMP|I've got to stereo this one.
1431819|CDR|I've already got it.
1431820|LMP|Well, I'm getting it from this way, and they like that. Did we kick any dirt in under there?
1431825|CDR|No. I don't - no, I don't think so. Go way down in there. Let me get a couple of after pictures. Yes, we want to get two sides of these rocks, and you can see their - their structure.
1431852|LMP|I've got that, Gene.
1431854|CDR|Okay.
1431854|LMP|I took those. I took that stereo.
1431901|CC|Okay, and if I could remind you guys to get a pan from up there before you leave the high uphill area there. There's no point in climbing up there twice. ...
1431911|CDR|Yes, sir, Bob. How much time we got here now?
1431914|CC|Stand by.
1431921|LMP|Okay. You got your bag?
1431923|CC|Okay. We got 12 or 13 minutes left at this station; unless you take that extra 10 minutes that we were offering you.
1431931|CDR|Let's take it, Bob.
1431933|LMP|We got to get the rake.
1431934|CDR|Let's take it; we'll need it.
1431935|LMP|Okay. Let me try again.
1431940|PAO|That's the Earth in the picture.
1431941|CDR|Okay.
1431941|LMP|I don't know whether I can or not.
1431942|CDR|Do you know how far under you're getting, by any chance?
1431943|LMP|Yes. I got in a - I got under an east-west overhang about - 20 centimeters - way back - By the way, ... it goes even farther, but that's about as far as I can reach back for the sample.
1431957|CDR|That's enough, Jack let me -
1432000|CC|Okay. I copy that.
1432001|LMP|That's in bag 500.
1432003|CC|And, 17, if you want to just take a minute, you might look up in the sky and notice that our camera is taking a beautiful picture of Mother Earth.
1432014|CDR|Isn't that pretty over - Can you see the Massif, too?
1432018|CC|Now we're coming down to look at the massif. isn't that a beautiful picture of the Pacific there? Ed finally found it. Now we see the massif.
1432030|LMP|Okay.
1432032|CDR|And, Bob, I took an after picture of - of where Jack just got that soil sample under the rock from; and I'm on 60.
1432041|CC|Copy that.
1432042|LMP|Are you through with the gnomon?
1432043|CDR|Yes.
1432043|LMP|I'll set it up for the rake.
1432044|CDR|Okay, I'll go up there and get a pan, Jack.
1432046|LMP|Okay. You get that pan - -
1432047|CC|I - didn't get that soil bag number, Gene - or Jack.
1432050|CDR|We've been here - -
1432052|LMP|500.
1432055|CC|Copy that.
1432057|PAO|We're 2 hours and 46 minutes into this EVA.
1432109|LMP|We're on a pretty good slope, Geno.
1432110|CDR|You bet you. And do I know it. Hey - Bob, how long have we been at this station?
1432119|CC|Stand by. You've been here about 40 minutes right now. Can you believe it?
1432127|CDR|Is that right? Is that - all ready? Jack - -
1432130|CC|And we're going to give you that extra 10 minutes there.
1432133|CDR|I can't believe we've been here.
1432137|CC|That leaves you about 20 minutes; then you'll have to be moving.
1432139|CDR|Boy, this pan may be looking - Okay. This pan may be looking right smack in the sides of the Massifs. Only way you can get it is to lean back - and I can't lean downhill.
1432156|PAO|Jack Schmitt taking a rake sample.
1432201|CC|Hey. Watch out for that crater behind you there, Geno.
1432207|CDR|I'm standing in the crater so I can get level.
1432209|CC|Yes, we see that.
1432210|CDR|Well, I have some good pictures of Nansen, anyway, and -
1432230|CDR|You know, I look out there, I'm not sure I really believe it all.
1432236|LMP|Bob, my down-Sun pictures on the rake were taken at f/8. I'm sorry.
1432241|CC|Okay, copy that ... We'll take it into account.
1432246|CDR|This isn't an easy -
1432252|LMP|Okay, I got to get out of my shadow or I can't see what I'm doing.
1432323|CDR|I'll be right down there to bag that rake for you.
1432326|LMP|I got to get it first.
1432329|CDR|(Laughter) Man, I tell you; can you come downhill in a hurry. Going uphill is a nice job. Bob, I'd say we can meet our walkback constraints, if anyone's interested.
1432344|CC|Okay. I expect it's all downhill from here.
1432349|CDR|Well, no, sir. Not exactly.
1432352|CC|Can you guys see the LM or are you down too far to see the LM?
1432354|CDR|... our walkback constraints. Oh, no. The LM is over about three rises in the Scarp before we can even see it.
1432402|CC|Okay, I thought that might have happened.
1432403|CDR|You're looking - I'm not even at a lev - I'm not even at a level of the last - the last hill we came over.
1432412|CC|Okay.
1432413|CDR|I don't know if you've looked up that way.
1432416|CC|Roger. We had a feeling for that. I was just checking.
1432424|CDR|We can meet them, but I wouldn't stretch them.
1432427|CC|Okay.
1432438|LMP|Not many small walnut-sized fragments in here, Bob. Gotten about seven or eight.
1432444|CC|Okay. I copy that.
1432456|LMP|Gene, you got a bag?
1432457|CDR|Yes, sir. Right here. How you doing?
1432501|LMP|My hands are getting tired.
1432502|CDR|Yes. Bag 501.
1432511|CDR|No, there aren't a lot; but that'll fill up a bag.
1432515|LMP|This kilogram of sample site 2?
1432517|CDR|I'll have to look; I think so. I think they all are, aren't they? Practically.
1432522|CC|And this is the one that we would like to get the kilogram of soil from, Jack.
1432527|LMP|Okay. I'll use my scoop for that.
1432530|CDR|Bag 501.
1432532|CC|Copy that, Gene.
1432539|LMP|Okay, what do we have left here?
1432542|CDR|We want to get a - I got the high pan.
1432550|CDR|... let me look. They want it - -
1432553|LMP|I don't know how we used up all the time, but we did.
1432556|CDR|Okay, my pan, by the way, I got extensive vertical coverage down into Nansen, Bob.
1432603|CC|Okay. Copy that, Gene. Thank you.
1432605|LMP|... getting to my ...
1432607|CDR|I don't know where the hour went that it took to drive here.
1432613|LMP|Maybe time's different in space. Adventures in space and time.
1432619|CDR|We changed 2 hours and 40 minutes. I don't know whether that makes us older or not, but - -
1432626|LMP|Ooops -
1432629|CDR|Awrrrrrr -
1432631|LMP|Try again. I got half of it. I got three-quarters of it.
1432635|CDR|502, Bob, will be the kilogram.
1432637|CC|Copy that.
1432638|LMP|And that's sample down to about 5 - about 4 centimeters - Don't get too close to the camera. Okay.
1432647|CDR|Oh, that's a big bag full. Want to put it in mine?
1432651|LMP|It's all right. I can't feel it. You might as well -
1432656|CDR|How's your cooling, okay?
1432658|LMP|Cooling's fine. My hands are tired.
1432700|CDR|Well, that's natural.
1432702|LMP|Okay, ...
1432703|CC|Okay. And guys - do you see any more different blocks up there that are worth sampling before you go on down on to the flats and sample the light mantle?
1432714|LMP|We haven't had a chance to look around any more than you've heard.
1432717|CC|Okay.
1432718|CDR|You want a rake and a light mantle here?
1432719|CC|We want a rake and a light mantle. You might as well get that down by the Rover - later on and -
1432723|LMP|Get an after - get an after, Gene. Gene, get an after.
1432727|CDR|Yes. Got it, got it, got it, got it.
1432731|CC|Then you might look around - -
1432732|LMP|I'm sorry, Bob. Go ahead.
1432733|CC|- - ... documented samples there - up on the slope of the massif, before you move down the flatter light mantle areas by the Rover. Just do the other sampling.
1432742|LMP|We - we will.
1432746|CDR|Okay, Bob. Jack got the befores on the rake and I got the after.
1432749|CC|Okay; we have that.
1432758|CDR|Okay, Bob, here are two rocks side by side, a meter or two in diameter. And one is the anorthositic gabbro, if I can use the term; and the other is the - is that two-cycle breccia.
1432816|CDR|Oh, that's the way to come downhill.
1432819|LMP|Just don't stub your toe.
1432821|CDR|Man, that's the way to come downhill.
1432823|LMP|Hey, Gene.
1432824|CDR|Yes.
1432825|LMP|Set up right there. Let's get that - let's get that big clast.
1432828|CDR|There's a fram - a fracture right in there I want to get near. Oh, the clast. Yes.
1432831|LMP|Yes, sir.
1432832|CDR|Good eye, good eye.
1432834|LMP|Big white clast - in the two-cy - in the gray-mat rix breccia.
1432839|CDR|Good eye. Man, that's a prize. Let me get this over here so I can ...
1432843|LMP|I think you can even get it.
1432845|CDR|I can get both sides. I want to get this big - Yes, I think I can get that. I'm going to try. Oh. I can't believe the trouble I have with f-stops.
1432903|LMP|Okay.
1432906|CDR|Now, I want to try and take this piece off first.
1432913|LMP|Pretty hard, isn't it? That boulder's going to roll.
1432917|CDR|Man, that is hard. There's the same clast over there.
1432926|LMP|Well, we get - -
1432928|CDR|That clast is soft.
1432929|LMP|Can you use your - your blade end?
1432932|CDR|Yes. Yes, let me get that little piece, anyway, to start with. Got it. There's two more pieces.
1432942|LMP|Okay. Before we cover them up, let's get them.
1432946|CDR|I got to get a sample of that mother rock.
1432949|LMP|Okay, there you go.
1432951|CDR|The other one's right there.
1432955|LMP|Okay.
1432956|CDR|Now, I'm going to see if I can't get a sample -
1432957|LMP|Want to try to hit that one more time. I think we've got another one coming there. There's another little one.
1433012|LMP|That looks almost like a rhyolite from here. I don't believe it, though.
1433018|CDR|No, that's not - -
1433019|LMP|I think that's it. Got a bag? Okay, this is a fine-grained - but crystalline white clast - in the gray breccia; and it's mixed with soil. We had to pick up a little soil. 503.
1433039|CDR|I guess they're all there, aren't they?
1433040|LMP|I think they are. There are three clasts, anyway - or three fragments that we got off. Chips.
1433047|CDR|Let me get a piece of the rock it's in. And I'm going to take a closeup stereo of that.
1433052|LMP|Okay, don't get it - Okay.
1433107|CDR|See it?
1433108|LMP|Yes. See it? You hit me with it.
1433113|CDR|Well - -
1433114|LMP|I tried to catch it.
1433116|CDR|Bob, you still there?
1433117|CC|Roger. Still there. Listening with great delight.
1433122|CDR|I believe ... the piece that came off there, though, Jack.
1433125|LMP|I got another piece of it up here.
1433128|CDR|And I'd roll that downhill - -
1433130|LMP|Okay, the - the host rock for that - that inclusion of white material will be in bag - What is it?
1433142|CDR|504.
1433142|LMP|504. Two chips with soil. Okay.
1433147|PAO|Heart rate is running in the 90s.
1433151|CDR|Getting heavy?
1433152|LMP|What? The bag?
1433153|CDR|Yes.
1433153|LMP|No. Just the scoop.
1433155|CDR|Just make sure they're closed so they don't - -
1433158|LMP|I wore my hand out holding that camera together coming out here.
1433201|CDR|We're getting some samples this time. I want to get a far - an after, and I want to get a closeup stereo of that. And I'm going to get some pictures around this block, too.
1433210|LMP|Okay.
1433212|CDR|There's an after and now I'm going to get - sort of a closeup stereo around it. That ought to do it.
1433221|LMP|Hey, Bob, while he's doing that, there's a real good example of pit-bottom crater up here even on this talus slope. I'll try to take a stereo of it.
1433237|CC|Okay, Jack, that sounds great. I guess there's always a problem of getting the in-place, glass, if you think that's appropriate at this point. Word along those lines, though, is we'd like your Rover moving in 11 minutes; so it's probably not appropriate at this time on that.
1433252|LMP|Okay, there isn't any glass in this - this crater - you can see it with your TV.
1433255|CC|Okay; copy that.
1433257|LMP|It's just bigger - it's bigger than the average crater. And it still has that pit, the pit being about a third of the diameter of the - the inner diameter of the crater - third of the - make it a fourth of the rim diameter, that's easier.
1433316|CC|Copy that.
1433318|CDR|Jack, can I look - can I look at that closely?
1433321|LMP|Look at what?
1433321|CDR|Hold the rake a second. We got to be moving in how many minutes, Bob?
1433331|CC|We'd like to have you moving in 10 minutes, which means - allow about, you know, the - the usual 3 or 4 or 5 minutes for closeout - before that time.
1433341|CDR|Okay, we'll get hustling.
1433344|LMP|Okay, Bob. That white-colored inclusion we sampled looks like a strange -
1433351|CDR|Look out, Jack.
1433357|CC|It's the old boulder-rolling trick.
1433359|CDR|How about getting a soil sample under there?
1433402|CC|Don't hit the Rover.
1433406|CDR|Get that - get that sample under there, Jack. Under that rock.
1433410|LMP|Okay. Got a bag?
1433412|CDR|Got a bag.
1433415|LMP|The soil from right underneath the rock - down to about 4 centimeters - in 505. And I'll try to skim it here a little, too. Get the upper - centimeter.
1433444|CDR|Bob, this big white clast - I'm not sure there aren't - some smaller ones in some of those other big boulders. That's just an intuitive guess.
1433451|LMP|Oh, there are.
1433451|CDR|But we never saw any as obviously big, as gross as this one. Such as this particular boulder I photographed, I had three of them other than the one we sampled. And that's 505 - and 506, in that order.
1433509|CC|Okay; we copy that.
1433511|CDR|On the -
1433513|CC|And by now, probably the best thing for you guys - -
1433515|LMP|Bob, that rock - -
1433516|CC|- - to do is to go back to the Rover and pick up the rake samples. Go ahead, Jack.
1433524|LMP|That - -
1433526|CDR|I'll get it.
1433527|LMP|Okay. That rock - that clast - white clast - I looked at it, and it has a light, pastel-green - fairly rounded crystals in a fine-grained white to light pinkish-tan matrix. And you can figure that one out. Looks like olivine and something.
1433553|CC|Roger on that. Sounds like a rainbow.
1433555|LMP|It might be a - No, it's not those - the colors aren't that distinct, Bob. I was just giving you shades.
1433604|CC|Okay; Roger.
1433609|CDR|Hey, Bob, have you panned - down into Nansen and seen this rock that's - oh, 30 or 40 meters from us? To give you an idea of the kind of upslope filleting you have on some of those boulders.
1433621|CC|Okay, We'll - -
1433622|CDR|It's down to your right.
1433623|CC|Okay. We'll send Ed over there to look at it.
1433627|LMP|Yes, I'll help him.
1433629|CDR|I don't think you got enough time.
1433632|CC|Okay, we'd like you guys to get going on the rake sample. We'd like a handle on the rake there.
1433638|LMP|Okay, We're going to - I'm going to have to move out here a ways, Geno.
1433644|CDR|Okay.
1433649|LMP|Coming right there.
1433649|CDR|Right there is what I'm looking at.
1433651|CC|Okay. We're going to check it out; thank you.
1433700|CDR|And there's no sense trying to get 500s up. Well - Let's see what happens.
1433706|CC|Okay. Also, we're running out of - there's no time to get 500s either, unfortunately. We're planning on Station 4, which will be a better perspective distance anyway.
1433716|LMP|Yes, I was going to say there's no sense in trying to get them up the massif; I don't think you'll see anything up there.
1433720|CC|Okay.
1433725|LMP|Gene. You getting your pan?
1433727|CDR|Yes. I said where do you want it?
1433728|LMP|Well, right over there where there's some fragments. And you get the -
1433731|CDR|I'll get the before and the locator.
1433733|LMP|Okay, and then I'll get the down.
1433807|LMP|Okay. (Laughter) ... to take pictures.
1433818|CDR|Yes. Let me tell you, you just got to think an order of magnitude bigger than what you're normally are accustomed to thinking.
1433825|LMP|Okay, pan's complete.
1433826|CDR|Okay, let's get the rake sample so we can move on. Bob, I couldn't get those 500s anyway. It would require me to pitch up too far, and there's no way I could do it.
1433842|CC|Okay. No, we're definitely not in favor of that, Gene, at this area.
1433848|CDR|I know, I'm just mulling it over, but there really isn't any way I could get them.
1433852|CC|Okay.
1433855|LMP|Boy, I tell you -
1433856|CDR|How are your hands? Let me rake that a little bit.
1433857|LMP|Well, it's all right; there just aren't any rocks. Should have brought the scoop and used the old shovel trick.
1433905|CDR|There's a couple, keep going. There sure aren't, are there?
1433917|CC|Okay, do you have any feeling - do you have that hard layer underneath there like you did yesterday, when you raked at Station 1, Jack?
1433924|CDR|There's one under the gnomon you can get.
1433928|LMP|Several I thought were rocks turned out to be clods.
1433930|CDR|Yes, that's what most of them are is clods. How do you get clods if it's never been wet? You're not getting any. You've had three in there ever since the last four scoops.
1433941|LMP|Yes. There just aren't many.
1433943|CDR|507.
1433945|CC|Okay, copy 507, very few.
1433947|CDR|Three rocks. Yes, you got about four rocks - about 2 inches and smaller.
1433954|LMP|And let me get the down-Sun which - -
1433958|CC|Okay, let's just get the soil and press on. We'd like to move in 3 minutes, 3 minutes.
1434006|CDR|Okay, you got it?
1434007|LMP|Yes.
1434008|CDR|Okay. Let me put this in your bag and we'll ... forget the soil.
1434011|LMP|Forget the soil?
1434012|CDR|He wants us moving in 3 minutes. So let's go.
1434016|LMP|Well -
1434017|CC|No, get the soil, guys. Get the soil. Don't, forget the soil; get the soil.
1434021|LMP|Yes, we want it.
1434024|CDR|I'm sorry, I thought you said to skip it.
1434027|CDR|Got your bag?
1434028|LMP|Yes. Maybe a little messy.
1434032|CDR|That's all right.
1434044|LMP|One-scoop-Schmitt, they call me.
1434046|CDR|That's good. That's bag 508.
1434048|CC|Copy that.
1434053|CDR|You'll have to start putting some of these samples in my bag. You're getting a full bag for Christmas here.
1434100|LMP|Is it so full we ought to change it?
1434101|CDR|Yes. Let's do that after we get to the next station, though.
1434106|LMP|Well - okay.
1434108|CDR|We ought to start moving out of here.
1434109|LMP|Yes, let's go.
1434110|CDR|Let me get one after of the area that we messed up.
1434126|CC|Beautiful station, guys; just simply beautiful. Almost deserves a Falcon code.
1434134|LMP|Man, I'll tell you. (Laughter) Falcon 109. I couldn't help that, Bob; it's just too beautiful.
1434148|CDR|Hey, Jack, will you look where we kicked up this stuff. There's some light - the light - well, I can't see it now, I'm looking in - -
1434153|LMP|I can see. There's a light-colored fragment I think we break into.
1434156|CDR|Yes, we kick it up.
1434157|LMP|They are light-colored clods.
1434159|CDR|And when I was walking uphill, I really wasn't sinking in probably more than an inch or two.
1434204|LMP|Why don't you - can you - want to take this bag off of me?
1434206|CDR|Yes, sir.
1434207|LMP|I'll get one out. We can use this one.
1434210|CDR|Yes. Because we want to get rolling.
1434215|CC|Okay, 17, there's a couple of things here, while your getting undone there. There's our housekeeping to close out. Change those bags. We'd also like to get the SEP turned on, and you might read us the temperature when you turn it on. And other than that, stowing the TV and low gain antenna and you're on your way. We've taken care of the gravimeter already.
1434240|CDR|What do you think? Did our reading change much, Bob?
1434244|CC|Which one?
1434245|LMP|Make sure that's locked on there.
1434247|CDR|Yes, it is locked; make sure the cap's locked. Okay, bag 8 is on the gate, and Jack's getting bag 4.
1434254|CC|Okay; copy that. Copy that.
1434302|CDR|Boy, I know my camera's going to be - -
1434304|CC|You copy on the SEP receiver turn on and temperature?
1434309|LMP|Right. You want that closed?
1434314|CDR|Yes.
1434314|LMP|Mag.
1434315|CDR|We got that, Bob.
1434317|LMP|It's closed.
1434317|CDR|Okay.
1434319|LMP|Okay.
1434319|CC|Okay. 17, take all that back, we've just had a change of heart back here. And we're not going to turn the SEP on, just cover it up. And you might give us a temperature reading as you go by; that'll help us think what to do with it.
1434332|CDR|It's about 98.
1434334|CC|Copy 98, then leave them both off.
1434341|CDR|Okay.
1434343|CC|17, John and Charlie are kind of advising you to put that SC - that full SCB underneath the seat to keep - make sure the top doesn't bounce open and lose some of those rocks.
1434356|CDR|Well, you can't take better advice than from those who have been here.
1434359|CC|Roger on that.
1434401|CDR|Their advice has been pretty good so far.
1434406|CC|I won't pass that on to them, I think they -
1434419|CDR|These locks are clamming up, Jack. I can't unlock that one now.
1434428|LMP|Can you lock that one?
1434434|CDR|They all get sticky.
1434438|LMP|That one just didn't want to work any more.
1434442|CDR|Let me see. It isn't moving either way. This one - this one was sticky, too. Let me see.
1434453|LMP|OUT's open, right?
1434454|CDR|Huh?
1434455|LMP|OUT is open - -
1434456|CDR|OUT is OPEN, yes. Let me try once more if I have to - Here I got it.
1434503|LMP|Okay, those are really getting dusty. I'll hit those with a dust brush next time around.
1434513|CDR|Charge that time up to John and Charlie!
1434525|LMP|Okay. What haven't we done?
1434529|CDR|Okay. I got to get the camera. Okay, Bob, I'm taking your camera.
1434536|CC|Okay, looks like it's in the right place, as long as it's turned around. Good coordination.
1434542|CDR|Yes, sir. Okay. We read the TGE, I'm going MODE 1.
1434550|CC|Roger on that. Okay; we lost the picture.
1434552|CC|And give me a call when you guys get rolling.
1434558|LMP|Okay.
1434559|CC|And we'd like frames when it's convenient on you guys.
1434605|PAO|We'll be without a picture until the crew gets to Station 3, which is at the base of the scarp about half way from Station 2 to Station 4 which is near the crater Shorty.
1434605|LMP|Okay, Bob.
1434616|LMP|Okay. LMP is at 46.
1434620|CC|Copy that.
1434622|CDR|And CDR, is at, if I stop long enough, 113.
1434630|CC|Copy. 113.
1434635|CDR|Oh, look at that. Boy, I tell you. 
1434648|LMP|Okay, Geno, why don't I follow our tracks back; well, until we get over the big hump and then we can start picking our way to 3. I've got 3 pretty well spotted.
1434703|CDR|Okay. Okay, low gain is set, and heading about 035 - oh, let me set this thing out of the way again. This has been giving me more trouble.
1434720|LMP|What's that? The hammer?
1434722|CDR|Yes, the handle.
1434723|LMP|Oh, getting caught in there? Okay.
1434726|CDR|Okay, Bob. We're ready, we're rolling. You need any readings?
1434733|CC|No, no readings called out. And when you get going, I'll give you a little advice on what we're going to do on the way to Station 3.
1434742|LMP|Well, let me tell you a few things first, Bob.
1434745|CC|Okay, start telling me.
1434746|LMP|I think those two - -
1434749|CDR|We're rolling!
1434751|LMP|All right. Those two major kinds of blocks that we sampled there - it was about the two varieties we saw in the area, it's a long extrapolation I realize, but they do resemble in color, and I believe in texture, the blue-gray rocks and the light tan rocks up on the Massif. So I feel confident that - fairly confident that we sampled at least the two major units visible from a distance in the South Massif.
1434827|CC|Excellent, excellent.
1434830|LMP|I think that there is some - a lot of post-mission work to be done on correlating the angularity and possibly even the albedoes of the rocks we sampled with those on the Massif. We should have good - good pictures of them - of both from a distance and up close.
1434852|CC|Okay. I'm reminding you - -
1434854|LMP|So we may be able ... - -
1434854|CC|- - That extrapolation is the nature of our art.
1434859|LMP|(Laughter) And, Bob, I'm not going to - How am I on the film?
1434909|CDR|Oh, my golly! Look at that valley!
1434911|CC|Stand by. I'll get that for you, Jack - -
1434913|CDR|I think there's a - -
1434913|CC|- I think you're doing fairly well, now. And before you guys get too far, a couple of comments we want to do on the way. If - there is a Rover sample stop in your checklist, it used to be at the 073 and 6.3; it's the first thing there, halfway out to Hole-in-the-Wall. And we're now going to have that Rover sample stop at 078 and 7.0. That should be along your tracks going home. So, about 078 and 7.0, we'll have the Rover sample stop. And the gravimeter people have won today, and we're going to stop and get off the Rover and get a gravimeter reading at that location. We're taking out another stop, I'm not sure quite where. And right now, Jack, you're right on on the film says a little note in front of me.
1435001|LMP|Okay. I'll take pictures, then.
1435004|CDR|Bob, we're on the top, coming off the highest lobe of the scarp looking back into the valley. And it's quite a scene back there, but we still cannot see the LM. That may be it - I don't know.
1435017|LMP|Hey, turn a partial pan, I know it's into the Sun. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
1435023|CDR|Okay. Let's take one from right here. I want - I want the whole thing.
1435027|CDR|You ready to start?
1435028|LMP|Yes, I got it.
1435029|CDR|Start taking. Well, that's -
1435032|CDR|Take the whole thing.
1435033|LMP|Go ahead.
1435035|CDR|Get around this crater.
1435036|LMP|I got a pan down in the valley. This is just going to be right into the -
1435040|CDR|Yes. Don't take that one. Get it up as we come around. You get it? There we go.
1435044|LMP|Okay.
1435045|CDR|That's the one we want. And you got the valley?
1435048|LMP|Yes. Keep going. Okay. Keep turning around over there, and I'll get that scarp. That's beautiful.
1435054|CDR|Isn't that something? Man, you talk about a mysterious looking place.
1435105|LMP|They can cut some frames - some parts of those pictures out and make a nice photograph. (Laughter) TV camera, maps -
1435114|LMP|Okay, looking at the north man - the light mantle. No more comments except that by that rake sample and just looking, there's certainly is - are fewer fragments than we saw at Station 2. The main thing that we can tell about the light mantle and when we're on it, of course, is the light-colored craters. The fresher craters all appear to be light colored. As they get older, they seem to -the albedo goes down and potentially have been dusted with material from the dark mantle or from other sites. Either that or it's just the lunar patination that we're all familiar with.
1435130|CDR|You know, it's a shame. They could have had TV coming down here because my heading isn't going to change much at all. The high gain could have been on the whole time.
1435200|LMP|Bob, none of the craters out here in the light mantle appear to show - they've got new bedrock. Almost all of them are instant rock craters.
1435221|CDR|Say, Bob. Give me that bearing and range again for the - -
1435224|LMP|70 right here.
1435224|CDR|What is it?
1435224|CC|078 and 7.0
1435227|CDR|- - up on the hill. How about 071 and 7.0? Will that do?
1435234|CC|Yes. I think that that will be enough to hack it.
1435239|CDR|Well, if not, we can go down there.
1435241|CC|No, no, no. Stay on the road - stay on the road you're on.
1435248|CDR|Well, I'm not on any road, but I'm stopping here.
1435252|CC|I thought you guys were making a road -
1435253|CDR|071.
1435254|CC|Roger.
1435254|CDR|Let me turn it off.
1435257|CC|Yes, also - -
1435257|LMP|... 98 and 7.0.
1435303|CC|Okay. And the Rover ... should be fairly flat for the ole gravimeter.
1435311|CDR|Uh oh.
1435312|CDR|Well - That means we have to change here.
1435315|LMP|Hey, right over here to my right - -
1435317|CDR|Okay.
1435318|LMP|Maybe it's the best we can do, but it's still going to be on a slope.
1435321|CDR|Well, I'll level it off on a local - -
1435322|LMP|On it?
1435323|CDR|Yes. Go ahead. I'm on. Do you see -
1435327|LMP|Yes, I see it. Right there.
1435328|CDR|On the rim of that crater that's builded up a little bit? Right up here. What's your - can you tell your roll? Okay, now that's about aero right there. What's your roll?
1435342|LMP|Let me turn this off.
1435346|LMP|What's your roll indicator ...
1435347|CDR|Oh zero.
1435348|LMP|Zero?
1435349|CDR|Yes.
1435350|CDR|I'll punch it.
1435351|LMP|You'll change it as soon as you get off.
1435355|CDR|Oh, it's zero.
1435356|LMP|Oh, you got to get off anyway?
1435357|CDR|Do I have to get off for this?
1435358|CC|Roger. Both of you get off.
1435400|LMP|... gravimeter reading.
1435401|CDR|Why should I have to get off?
1435403|CC|So you don't move the ole gravimeter.
1435404|LMP|Think you can hold still?
1435404|CDR|Yes. I'll hold still.
1435406|CC|Negative on that, Gene.
1435407|CDR|Okay, Bob. Give me your sampler cause that's the other thing I have to do.
1435411|CC|Yes. We'll get bag samples here - Rover samples, at least.
1435413|CDR|But you need me off to sample?
1435415|CC|Roger. We want Jack - Gene and Jack both off.
1435417|CDR|Well, if you need me off; Jack, just punch it.
1435420|LMP|Okay. Hold still. They don't know anything about your PLSS noise.
1435423|CDR|We'll get off.
1435424|LMP|Ya I think ...
1435424|CC|Gene, we'd like both of you off.
1435427|LMP|07 - 071, 9.8, and 7.0, Bob.
1435433|CC|Got that.
1435450|CDR|Don't push it yet - did you?
1435451|LMP|No.
1435459|CDR|Okay. Go ahead. Push it.
1435502|LMP|Let me wait until it settles down here.
1435508|CDR|This thing is off tape START, isn't it?
1435512|LMP|Huh?
1435513|CDR|If this thing doesn't change.
1435514|LMP|Oh, that should be good - -
1435516|CDR|Yes, it does change.
1435518|LMP|Cycle it a couple of times.
1435520|CDR|Huh?
1435521|LMP|Cycle it a couple of times.
1435521|CDR|No, the settings.
1435522|LMP|Oh, I don't know - yes, they'll change.
1435527|LMP|Okay. Quiet Rover. Gravity.
1435530|LMP|MARK it.
1435531|CC|Copy that.
1435532|CDR|Say, Bob, I need a quick f-stop for the 500.
1435536|CC|Standby.
1435538|CDR|It's the same - it's the same film.
1435543|CDR|Hey, Bob, can I punch it again?
1435547|CC|Oh yes. Go to STANDBY and then punch it again.
1435548|LMP|... wait for it to time out, do you?
1435551|CDR|Stand by.
1435552|CDR|Stand by, Jack.
1435554|PAO|Ron Evans in America is on his 29th lunar revolution. We'll be acquiring him in 14 minutes. In addition to the experiments that he's been performing he's been doing a considerable amount of visual science descriptions. Ron is on his flight plan.
1435554|CDR|Okay.
1435554|LMP|MARK it.
1435554|CC|Copy that.
1435610|CC|Okay. And, Geno, f-stop for the 500 millimeter should be the same as - for the 70.
1435617|CDR|Okay.
1435637|CC|And, Jack, I presume you're getting some Rover samples here off the Rover.
1435658|LMP|Bag 30 Easy.
1435704|CC|Copy. 30 Easy. Are you guys finding much in the way of rocks here?
1435716|LMP|I'm looking. I can get you some instant rock out of a small pit crater - pit bottom crater.
1435726|CDR|Bob, up to frame count 36 is the outcrop on the - or boulders at the top of the South Massif.
1435736|CC|Okay.
1435744|LMP|Bag 31 Easy. Instant rock out of a 2-meter pit bottom crater - off the inner wall.
1435756|CC|Copy that.
1435756|LMP|Well, let's make it 30 centimeters down from the rim.
1435803|CC|Okay.
1435828|CC|Okay, and 17, we've got about 30 seconds left for that gravimeter reading. You want to be finishing up the task and getting back toward the Rover.
1435844|LMP|Okay.
1435850|CDR|Okay, Bob. And through frame count 57 are the North Massif and - from part of the western portions to part of the eastern portions.
1435901|CC|Okay, now; and what was that frame count?
1435913|CC|Okay. Copy the 57, there.
1435917|LMP|Here's something different - here's a little - -
1435926|PAO|EVA time 3 hours 24 minutes.
1435931|CC|And, guys, we're ready for the gravimeter reading. And we'd like a frame count from you, Jack. I guess if you'd prefer - -
1435936|LMP|A chunk of yellow - yellow-brown rock that apparently has several spots behind it, probably indicating direction from which it came - Oh, no, what is that? That's a reflection (laughter). That really fooled me. A reflection off the mylar (laughter). Crazy. Well, what the heck, I'll sample it anyway.
1440008|CDR|Okay. Let me get my antenna set so - it's not quite - -
1440012|LMP|Is it through reading?
1440014|CDR|Yes, it's through reading. I'll - Probably read it better by now, Bob. I've got Family Mountain and some of the hills way off to the right of Family Mountain. I'm at 67 on the - on the - 500 and I'll give you the reading on the gravimeter.
1440032|CC|Okay. Copy. 67 on Family Mountain.
1440036|CDR|Did you get the other words on the 500?
1440039|CC|Roger. Copied them all.
1440044|CDR|Well, you were reading at probably a 90-degree low-gain angle.
1440048|CC|Roger. We've been reading them on the LM also.
1440049|LMP|32 Easy is another - just small - another small fragment.
1440054|CC|You know what I need?
1440056|CDR|Okay, 670, 123, 501 - 670, 123 501.
1440102|CC|Okay. Copy that, Geno. And we're ready for you guys to go on at your earliest convenience.
1440108|CDR|Do you want me to load the LRV sampler?
1440111|LMP|Go ahead. Yes.
1440130|CC|And, Jack, is that your last LRV sample bag?
1440135|LMP|I only had one left, but it's loaded now.
1440138|CC|Okay.
1440147|CDR|You did get the reading, right, Bob?
1440149|CC|Roger. Got the reading.
1440154|CDR|Okay. We're buttoning up.
1440156|CC|Okay. And if you've got something - If you don't have one left for that sample at Hole-in-the-Wall, Jack, we'd like you to get a new set of sample bags.
1440206|LMP|We've got it.
1440206|CC|Okay. Got it. And still understand that 32 Echo was your last sample.
1440216|LMP|32 Echo. Got three here.
1440219|CC|Okay.
1440220|CDR|Oh, oh.
1440222|LMP|Okay?
1440224|CDR|Yes.
1440225|LMP|Need some help?
1440227|CDR|No. I've got the Rover.
1440230|LMP|Was that me?
1440230|CDR|No.
1440234|CDR|That was interesting. Bob, about 2 inches below the surface here, you ran into that very - that blue-gray material down there and it just - it's in little clods, and it breaks apart in your hands.
1440251|LMP|Yes, that's right.
1440252|CDR|Did you get some of that in your Rover sample?
1440254|LMP|No, but I got it out of that instant rock crater.
1440258|CDR|Just grab a quick Rover sample and we'll take off.
1440259|LMP|That's why - that was a pretty interesting (laughter) episode.
1440306|CDR|Yes. Well, you know, we haven't been trenching like we should or we would have - -
1440311|LMP|... really those trenches - those craters are giving us the same information. That there's a light-colored material underneath.
1440324|CC|Okay, 17. We're ready for you guys to move on and we'd like to eliminate the Rover sample at Hole-in-the-Wall.
1440336|CDR|Okay, Bob. We're getting on now.
1440339|CC|Copy that.
1440343|CDR|We got on a minute ago (laughter)
1440348|CC|And, do I understand that these Rover samples, Jack, are in your pockets?
1440355|LMP|No. They're in the bag on the Rover.
1440358|CC|Okay.
1440359|LMP|40 Yankee.
1440401|CC|Copy that.
1440404|LMP|That's light-colored soil from a depth of about - it's mixed with a little of the upper surface, but mostly light-colored soil from a depth of about 15 centimeters.
1440420|CDR|Wonder what would I do for an encore?
1440428|LMP|It looks like the light mantle in here is covered with dark to a depth of about 5 or 10 centimeters.
1440442|CDR|You might want to go MIN, Jack, on your diverter.
1440445|LMP|Right now, I'm sort of warm.
1440447|CDR|Okay. When we start driving, you might want to go.
1440448|LMP|I'm going to zap myself with a cold. I can do it on here.
1440455|CDR|Did you take any pictures at all while you were there?
1440457|LMP|Oh, yes. I didn't take a pan. Why don't you turn right to a -
1440503|CDR|Okay, Bob. If you read, we're rolling.
1440508|CC|Okay. Mark that.
1440509|CDR|Making a right-hand turn for a pan.
1440510|LMP|Left. Let me see where we're going. I guess ... again. You know, a little more and that hole would have been in the way. We left some of our litter.
1440532|CDR|Not a complete pan but it will show the location.
1440540|LMP|Okay. LMP frame count 80.
1440544|CC|Copy that; 80.
1440546|LMP|Okay. Geno, you're heading for a spot that's about 080/5.5, approximately. And -
1440554|CDR|Okay.
1440555|CC|Yes, you guys following your tracks home, or not?
1440557|LMP|Do you have an update?
1440559|CDR|No.
1440601|CC|Okay; and - Roger. The Hole-in-the-Wall should be at about 080 or maybe 5.7. And we're not going to stop and get a Rover sample at Hole-in-the-Wall.
1440614|CDR|What about Station 3?
1440617|CDR|Okay, that sounds reasonable because it's just nothing but lots of rolling terrain.
1440625|LMP|Okay. Bob, I - I think we have a good sample of only partially contaminated light mantle in that last Rover sample that Gene accidentally discovered was right under our feet. It's almost certainly the light-colored material that's the crater - we've been talking about in the walls of the craters. And, as a matter of fact, that instant rock sample I took was light-colored and probably represents the same stuff, indurated slightly.
1440657|CDR|Light-colored mantle has that bluish tint that you saw in those rocks.
1440700|LMP|Yes.
1440703|LMP|I still don't think there's anything. We ought to - we ought to get a core in this light mantle sometime; and probably Station 3 is going to be the place. I hope that's still in the agenda.
1440719|CC|Roger. It's still in the agenda.
1440723|CDR|Say, Bob, can you update the mileage on Station 3?
1440728|CC|Okay, you want mileage to it or do you want the range and bearing at it?
1440734|CDR|Well, range and bearing at it.
1440737|CC|Okay. Stand by.
1440741|CDR|The Hole-in-the-Wall is fairly nebulous.
1440744|CC|Okay, we're going to say about 089 and 6.1 for Station 3.
1440752|CDR|Okay.
1440801|CC|Do you want to hear another range and bearing right now?
1440801|CDR|Do you get the feeling that we're the only ones out here, Jack? Looking around - 073, 10.3, 6.6.
1440810|CC|Copy that.
1440816|LMP|Bob, I have a feeling that whatever darkens the - Ooh, there's a beautiful little glass-lined crater, pit bottom crater - whatever darkens the light mantle is not a - a one-time-only mantling of darker material. It's something that happens over a period of time, continually, because craters of all sizes and apparent degradation are dark - darkened and there are lighter craters that are light to varying degrees, there seems to be a continuing - continuum of albedo change.
1440908|CDR|You know that little crater on the side of the North Massif that we're thinking about going to doesn't look nearly as light-colored or haloed as it does in pictures, does it?
1440920|LMP|You mean - Yes - no.
1440932|CDR|Now, let's see where we are, I don't want to run into that big crater at the foot of the - -
1440938|LMP|I think you're almost to the rim.
1440940|CDR|Yes, I want to go down here if I can. My tracks are over there to the left, I haven't crossed them yet.
1440945|LMP|073, 6.3.
1440949|CC|Copy that.
1440952|LMP|LMP frame count is 86.
1440958|CC|Copy 86.
1441009|LMP|Boy, that's a sight, isn't it?
1441012|CDR|That's spectacular.
1441013|LMP|I don't know why something that's all approximately the same hue should -
1441020|CDR|The lack of color has got to contribute to the inability to judge distance.
1441026|LMP|See the lobes coming out - looks like lobes out from the Scarp. The Scarp rather being a line in there on the, on the plain, appear to be lobes. I got a couple of shots of that. Whereas when it gets up on the Massif, it's a fairly continuous curve; although it does appear to be younger, at least - at least there's less relief on it for the first few kilometers of that bend there.
1441102|CDR|We're going to have to go down like the way we came because there's that big crater down at the bottom, I'm afraid.
1441106|CC|Yes, I think we agree with that suggestion, too.
1441114|LMP|Bob, the Scarp, so-called Scarp, impresses me as less of a scarp than a series of - of lobes which roughly have a north-south trend. And we've been driving over various hummocks within those lobes.
1441143|CC|Okay, copy that.
1441148|CDR|I think we made a gross mistake in not trying to let them get TV, my heading hasn't changed much at all here. They would have a spectacular view. Look at it out in that valley, Jack.
1441158|LMP|Yes.
1441201|CDR|Good lord. I still don't know where the LM is - I see it, I think. The shadow or blob - that's the only sharp shadow out there right in the - because you sure can't make out the craters from here, can you? Okay, hold on. Over the hill and down the rale. Man, I tell you, this machine is fantastic.
1441235|LMP|Yes; Watch it. (Laughter)
1441238|CDR|Quite a machine.
1441239|LMP|Likes to spin when you turn going down hill.
1441242|CDR|Quite a machine.
1441247|LMP|But - I think you've got something right ahead of you. Here -
1441250|CDR|I got it.
1441251|LMP|See the instant rock.
1441252|CDR|I got it. You know, the crater doesn't look nearly as bad from here, but it sure is deep when you get up there. We'll just - I'll meander around it over next to this next little lobe then I'll head down that next one - the first lobe we came up - and then along it.
1441306|LMP|Okay, there's Lara, and I think we can see station - Watch it, watch it, watch it.
1441317|CDR|Okay, I'm going through it slow.
1441325|LMP|Beautiful. (laughter) I figured we'd buckle the LCRU with that one.
1441332|CDR|I'll bet they can watch this road. My heart rate just dictates the kind of terrain we're going over.
1441344|LMP|Okay - Houston, we're navigating and not talking. Sorry. But the light mantle is a fair - is a uniform surface and I think you've heard just about everything we've had to say so far.
1441405|CC|Roger. Your comm's great and you guys are doing good work.
1441408|LMP|The fragment population is not - the fragment population hasn't changed, nor has the crater population, as near as I can tell. I hope the LRV photos will give you more details than that. Okay, Gene, do you have the target over there, that set of - -
1441429|CDR|Yes. Yes, I got to get over to this next knoll and I'm going to be off the Scarp. We're about three-quarters of the way down.
1441439|PAO|Heart rates while on the Rover are in the 80s.
1441440|CDR|Isn't that sharp shadow out there the LM? See it way out there? Almost under the Sun. It's got to be. It's the only sharp shadow out there. Right under the Sun, straight down there.
1441454|LMP|Probably.
1441455|CDR|Okay, I'm going to try to make it down this. Hold on.
1441459|LMP|This is what?
1441500|CDR|This is the one we climbed up.
1441502|LMP|Oh, there's Nemo over there to my right.
1441503|CDR|Yes, sir. This is the one we climbed up. Would you believe that?
1441506|LMP|Well, I don't know.
1441507|CDR|Yes, I would.
1441510|LMP|The problem is if there is any crater on the side - -
1441513|CDR|I don't want to give it the roll, are you - -
1441517|LMP|I think you're all right.
1441519|CDR|We're all right. I don't know, that's got, - -
1441522|LMP|Keep your speed down because if you have to turn, it doesn't like it on a downhill slope.
1441527|CDR|Man, that's got to be a - pitch-angle's pegged, I don't know what that means. Okay. Right on time - -
1441542|LMP|... scarp.
1441545|CC|You guys cut each other out but I take it that means you're at the edge of the Scarp.
1441551|LMP|We're off.
1441551|CDR|We're off, we came down.
1441553|CC|Roger. You're down the Scarp.
1441554|CDR|Hey, will you look at the hill we came down same way we went up?
1441557|LMP|No. I'd rather not.
1441601|CDR|Oh, I don't know, I'm impressed.
1441604|CDR|Okay, now where we got to go. 345 roughly. And we want to go to 087, 6.1 - -
1441610|LMP|Okay, you're - I think you're headed right - right for where we want.
1441614|CDR|Yes.
1441614|LMP|It's that bright - see that bright crater? You can just start to see Station 3 over there now.
1441619|CDR|Okay, navigation says I've got more than 9 degrees - I should be increasing range. Bob, we're at 079, 11.5, and 5.7.
1441625|CC|Okay, beautiful, guys. Really going smooth.
1441628|CDR|And I'm headed - and I'm headed northwest.
1441633|CC|Roger. In fact, we understand it's been going so smooth down here that they haven't even spilled any coffee in the SPAN room yet this mission.
1441644|CDR|Thorson must not be on duty. I'm glad we don't have any sitting on the LCRU.
1441654|LMP|Right over there is Station 3, I think.
1441658|LMP|Oh, actually, I guess - I guess they would want it - is there - I can just start to see two craters - -
1441707|CDR|You know what the problem is?
1441708|LMP|- - and they're closer to Lara.
1441709|CDR|I got a full planar view of the high gain and I can't see a thing out there.
1441714|LMP|That's right.
1441715|CDR|Full planar view. All I can do is see underneath it.
1441718|LMP|Well I -
1441721|CDR|Going to take it broadside. See, I can't see a lot of craters now that I'm out in front. Oh, I guess I can see most.
1441730|LMP|Here's a nice sharp little hole; look at that. Bob, the texture of the light mantle - surface texture - is really no different on the Scarp, on its flank, or out here to the east of the Scarp. Fragment population, crater population, everything looking about the same. If there is such a thing as a light mantle, it seems to be uniform across the Scarp.
1441800|CC|Okay, I copy that, Jack.
1441802|LMP|Here are your tracks - Hey! We crossed somebody's tracks - well, we sure did ... we made a loop.
1441808|CC|Hope they look like yours.
1441813|CDR|That was at 081/5.7.
1441817|CC|Okay, copy 081/5.7. Do they look like your tracks?
1441823|LMP|Well, here's another set.
1441825|CDR|Yes, this is where we went to the big crater and I came southeast in order to get around it, remember? We saw that hole?
1441831|LMP|Yes.
1441835|CDR|Look at that big turn I made, ha ha! That was a quick change of mind when we came over that ridge.
1441843|LMP|Yes, sir.
1441845|CDR|Okay, we're still headed northwest, Bob.
1441852|LMP|Here - I -
1441852|CDR|Okay, Bob, I guess one thing we don't have a handle on yet is what are the - I think we sampled them - once in a Rover sample, but what are the fragments out here mixed with the light mantle?
1441909|CC|Okay, I copy that.
1441910|LMP|I think I got one at our last - our last gravimeter stop, a small one, and I guess there's one other Rover sample, but - Station 3, we probably ought to make sure we get a representative suite of those fragments.
1441923|CC|Roger. Agree to that.
1441927|CDR|Hey, Bob, how long have we been out?
1441930|CC|Say there again, Gene? How long have you been out?
1441934|CDR|How long have we been out?
1441935|CC|3 plus 45.
1441942|CDR|Thank you.
1441946|CDR|We're at 083/5.7.
1441957|LMP|Well, it certainly doesn't look like the geology of Norway, but it certainly is interesting.
1442002|CDR|That must be Lara right there, huh?
1442003|LMP|Yes.
1442003|CDR|On the left. You can see the blocks on the other side of her.
1442006|LMP|That's right. I told them about those earlier. That's the only no - I think, Gene, you want to bear a little bit - Hold on - a little bit to the left. See those two craters, two bright craters, that are just this side of Lara?
1442020|CDR|Now - well - I'm not -
1442021|LMP|You're pointed right - almost right at them, now.
1442023|CDR|Okay, I can barely see them now through that high gain.
1442025|LMP|Okay.
1442026|CDR|But I can see - I know where we're going now.
1442027|LMP|Those are the two I think they wanted us to be at, and I think that's a good choice if we can get up there.
1442032|CDR|I want to get some 500s the way that scarp flows up on top of - well, it looks like it flows up on top of the North Massif. Now if may look like the North Massif may drape material down upon it. Look at that.
1442046|LMP|Well - not really. The texture is so different. It just doesn't look like as old a surface.
1442054|CDR|But definitely different.
1442055|LMP|Yes.
1442103|LMP|Wish they had never said anything about pictures, because I've tended to not take enough - to do better.
1442106|CC|Okay, but, Jack, you're doing quite well in the picture department - you're not getting too far behind or ahead. Copy that, Gene?
1442114|LMP|No, but I mean I'm not getting the coverage I've - I'm not sure I'm getting the coverage I should.
1442118|CC|Okay. Okay. We'll look at the frame counts when you get to Station 3.
1442124|LMP|Oops, oops! Oh, there's another big crater with a pit in it.
1442134|CDR|What was it, 17-1/2 or 18 clicks we hit coming down the Scarp, Jack?
1442139|LMP|I don't know (laughter).
1442145|LMP|I'm in MIN cooling now.
1442155|CDR|Oh, look at that - wait until you get over and look, at that South Massif. is that -
1442204|LMP|Well, I don't know where we're going to get a good - Well, let's see. You know, that big block up there might be worth going to.
1442215|CDR|087 at 5.9. I think that's the best station we've got right here.
1442219|LMP|Well - -
1442220|CDR|Let's see what's over on your right. Let's see if we can get at that scarp over there.
1442224|LMP|I've sort of lost track - -
1442226|CDR|We're about there.
1442227|CC|I think we expected you guys to be a little bit farther north. We were getting a heading of 080 for the bearing which really kind of says you said you were going a bit farther north than this.
1442239|CDR|Well, there's that first crater, there, Jack.
1442241|LMP|080?
1442242|CC|Roger. 080 is where we think -
1442244|LMP|All of a sudden I've lost track.
1442247|CC|Stand by.
1442249|LMP|There's nothing wrong with that except that -
1442251|LMP|Hey, I think we ought to go back to that big block.
1442253|CDR|Heading 080 is - heading north is not going to - -
1442257|CC|Roger. I just realized that, Geno.
1442258|CDR|I'm 087 now.
1442259|CC|Yes, I realize that, Gene; my mistake. Somebody's got a wrong thing down here. That's the Hole-in-the-Wall. My mistake.
1442308|LMP|Gene, I think - I think we need to go - go back there a little bit.
1442314|CDR|Yes, we're at 087/6.0. I think that's probably about right. Why don't we stop here?
1442317|CC|Okay, 17, that's a great stop. That was my mistake, I was reading the Hole-in-the-Wall coordinate.
1442325|CDR|All right, Bob, we've got some boulders over here that are in the light mantle.
1442331|CC|Okay, now, let me brief you on Station 3. It's going to be a very brief station to make up for the - -
1442336|CDR|We can see a little bit down into Lara now too.
1442338|CC|Okay, it will be a brief station to make up for the time we added on at the - first of all, remember we want to get the nav update. Let me go into a heading, of 270 more or less and give us the nav read-out so we can start that here.
1442359|CDR|Can you get where you want from here? No, this is no good. I wanted to get a high spot.
1442406|CDR|Yes, let's - let me park down here, Jack.
1442410|LMP|Well, you should have stayed up there. This is good right here.
1442416|LMP|It's not going to be very level for the gravimeter.
1442416|CC|Okay, Gene, and remember, we want to first head for the west so we can get the nav update.
1442426|CDR|We'll park right out here and we can work those blocks right up behind us. Okay, you want a nav update here?
1442432|CC|Roger. That's affirm.
1442433|LMP|You need to get your antenna.
1442439|CDR|Why don't you get off, Jack. Oh, I was looking at the wrong dang - oh, no, I'm not. Okay. I'll get a nav update. Get off and look around. I'll give them a nav update, Jack, and we'll press on.
1442502|CDR|Yes, sir, you're right, Bob. Hey, get your -
1442506|LMP|I will.
1442520|CDR|Okay?
1442522|LMP|Go ahead.
1442522|CDR|What do you need? Take your scoop or whatever you need.
1442525|LMP|Oh, you're going to move?
1442526|CDR|Yes. I want to give them a nav update real quick.
1442527|LMP|Oh, I'm sorry, I -
1442531|CC|Okay. And, Jack, ... for you. We're going to want you to do some document sampling on your own. I'll get with you guys on the rest of the station plan shortly. Go ahead, Gene, we're ready.
1442547|LMP|Okay, I ought to get the gnomon, I guess.
1442550|CDR|Okay, let me find a level spot; I'll come back towards you.
1442554|LMP|I'll get it. There is no.
1442600|CDR|Well, okay, if you got any -
1442601|LMP|No, go ahead, make your park.
1442604|CDR|Yes, I'm looking for a level spot, but my god, there sure aren't very many.
1442609|LMP|That's probably pretty good.
1442614|CDR|It will be in a minute.
1442614|CC|It doesn't have to be all that level, Jack - Gene.
1442628|CDR|Okay, 087 and 12.6, 6.0.
1442631|LMP|I got your gnomon.
1442633|CDR|Sun shadow is zero. Pitch - if I can get it over to read it. Pitch is - pitch is zero. Roll is zero. About - about 1 left, Bob?
1442658|CC|Okay, copy. And how about heading?
1442701|CDR|About 1 left.
1442702|CC|And how about heading?
1442705|CDR|Heading is 282.
1442708|CC|Okay, go ahead and park. We'll give you an update when you get done.
1442710|CDR|What else do you need?
1442712|CC|That's all we need. Go ahead and park on your 045. We'll give you an update when you are done.
1442723|CDR|Jack, is it worth coming right there?
1442728|LMP|Looks like a pretty good location - -
1442730|CDR|Okay.
1442731|LMP|- to sample the rim materials of this crater.
1442737|LMP|Bob, I'm at the south, let's say the east-southeast rim of a - oh, 30-meter crater in the light mantle, of course; up on the Scarp and maybe 300 - 200 meters from the rim of Lara in a northeast direction.
1442811|CC|Okay, I copy that.
1442812|CDR|It's body shows up as a bright crater - a bright crater on your map. There's only about a half a centimeter of gray cover over very white material that forms the rim.
1442827|CC|Okay. And, Gene, give me a call when you get parked and I'll give you an update on what we want to do.
1442837|CDR|Okay, I am parked.
1442839|CC|Okay, good. We'll take the Rover read-out first.
1442845|CDR|Okay. 087, 12.7, 6.0; 105 and 100. On the battery temps 100, 120. The rear motors are off scale low and the forward motors are 0 and 240.
1442903|CC|Okay, we copy that. Understand that 240 now instead of a 340. And what was your heading, 045?
1442912|CDR|Heading is 043.
1442914|CC|Okay. We copy that.
1442915|CDR|Hey Bob, did I ever give you a - if I ever gave you a motor temperature of 340, that figure was erroneous.
1442922|CC|Okay; Roger. And what we'd like you to do, Gene, is we'd like you to get the CSVC by yourself, that will essentially be your sole task at this station. We'd like Jack can do some solo sampling and we'd like to get one pan and the gravimeter, and then we'll leave this station. We're going to absorb some of the time we spent with the extra gravimeter reading and some of the time we absorbed at Station 2 in the longer stay time in sampling at Station 3. That's our plan. So it will be CDR for the CSVC for the long cans, excuse me, and LMP for solo sampling and then a pan by Jack, I presume, and then the gravimeter and then leave. And, Jack, you might check your film. We aren't quite sure where you are right now, before you get too far from the Rover.
1443017|CDR|Okay, Bob.
1443035|PAO|TV coming in now.
1443047|CDR|Bob, you got any - any preference up in this area where do you want that long can?
1443055|CC|Negative. That's something that was sort of near the scarp, but you're parked so near the scarp and that something, remember we do it in solo, we only did it with the Rover, so you'd have to stay right there beside the Rover and do it. No expectations of doing otherwise.
1443109|CDR|Well, that's what I figured. ...
1443110|LMP|Gene. Yes, I think you're in good shape. Yes, I don't have any other choice. Matter of fact, if there is a scarp, and if it is a fault, I'm right - right on it because the projection of it would be uphill a little bit.
1443122|CDR|Yes, I'll be right on the side of it. I'm parked on the side of it if it exists.
1443126|CC|Okay, and, Jack, what's your frame count?
1443135|LMP|Well, 1 - 122.
1443144|CC|Okay, copy. You ... Go ahead, Gene.
1443145|LMP|Bob, I've dug the trench and the - What do you need, Gene?
1443152|LMP|Oh, yes. Bob, I've dug a trench in the side of this crater. I've got down-Sun pictures of it. There's quite a marbling of light and dark soil or fine grain material. It looks as if there's a uniform, about 3-centimeter layer of light material over that marbled light and dark. O n the very top surface, there's a half centimeter of light gray, and when I say dark, I mean a medium gray.
1443235|CC|Okay, copy that. Sounds like a great sample site.
1443240|CDR|Okay, I'm going to start sampling the soils, and then I'll get you the fragments.
1443245|CC|Okay, I presume that we'll at least have the single upper core which we can use to sample of that stuff in the soil, and rem -
1443258|CDR|Oh, that's - there's no guarantee that this is a crater rim.
1443302|CC|Okay. And, Gene, are you still near the Rover?
1443309|CDR|Yes, I am.
1443310|CC|Okay, we'd like to get the SEP blankets opened, Gene, and dusted if they're dirty, so they can cool some more.
1443320|CDR|Oh, boy.
1443321|CC|Yes.
1443323|CDR|Okay, now I can't give you the gravimeter reading while I'm working on the Rover, so I'll have to time it when I get away from it.
1443331|CC|Okay. Roger on that. I think you'll be pounding on the hammer for a long while while you can take the Rover - gravimeter reading.
1443339|CDR|Yes. Well, we'll see. Let me get your brush back.
1443353|LMP|Okay, bag 520 has a skin sample of the upper light-gray soil. Don't know where I'm going to put these things, I've got to come down and get a bag.
1443413|LMP|Have you punched the gravim - No.
1443414|CDR|No, I can't punch it until I get out of here.
1443429|LMP|These switches are on OFF, STANDBY, right?
1443433|CDR|They should be.
1443433|LMP|Okay, that's where they are and the temperature is 100, about 104 and - -
1443438|CDR|No, they should be OFF. isn't it OFF?
1443439|LMP|No, it was STANDBY.
1443442|CDR|No, push it OFF.
1443443|CC|Okay, it doesn't matter whether it's STANDBY; it won't be heating at that temperature anyway, but put it OFF.
1443449|CDR|Okay. It might have gotten hit when I changed the blanket there. Now I have to go to INTERMEDIATE cooling here.
1443509|LMP|Zap me with a cold. Imagine those PLSS got charged okay last night. ...
1443527|CC|Yep, 17, those PLSSs look great.
1443532|CDR|Okay, back to INTERMEDIATE. How's Ron doing?
1443536|CC|They're both looking - Stand by, I thought he said both fine. Ron's doing great, too. He's sitting here busily - -
1443542|CDR|No, no.
1443544|CC|Go ahead.
1443546|CDR|I mean Captain America.
1443549|CC|Yes, I'm just inquiring of Bob. I think he's doing great. He's just passed a little bit north of you a couple of minutes ago and took some pictures of you.
1443622|LMP|Okay. I do my work around the LMP seat here.
1443631|CDR|That's lock. That must be unlock.
1443635|LMP|Okay, unlock. Brake is off. Four is coming in. Okay, Bob, the upper - the upper 5 centimeter - 3 centimeters mixed with that upper half centimeter, is the next sample.
1443714|CC|Copy that.
1443722|CDR|Okay, Bob, I guess I'm going to go pound away and, Jack, I'm going to hit the gravimeter.
1443729|LMP|Okay.
1443734|CDR|Okay -
1443734|CDR|MARK it.
1443736|CC|Copy that.
1443739|CDR|And 521 is the sample bag.
1443745|CC|Copy that.
1443802|CDR|Well, the first core has gone down pretty good, Bob.
1443805|CC|Okay, great.
1443808|LMP|Oh, you're not going - you won't have any problem in here coring.
1443817|CDR|Oh, man, I tell you, I wish I was putting a drill hole in here. Looks pretty nice.
1443825|PAO|Each of these drive tubes is 16 inches long.
1443835|LMP|Okay, Bob. The next sample is mostly the medium gray fraction of the marbling. It's mixed, though.
1443922|LMP|That's in bag 522.
1443939|CC|Copy that, Jack.
1443942|LMP|Okay, I think I got it. I think I got it, Bob.
1443945|CC|Okay.
1443950|CC|And, Jack, when you get done with this trench you might hit one - two of those blocks there, but then we'd - since we're really trying to cut this station down to a minimum, after that you'd probably get - better get to the pan.
1444007|CDR|Bob, what do you think, can I read a gravimeter?
1444009|CC|Yes, if it's not flashing - -
1444012|CDR|The light's out.
1444013|CC|Yes, it should be just done.
1444019|CDR|670, 049, 701; 670, 049, 701.
1444026|CC|Okay, I copy that.
1444029|LMP|Bob, the - the white marble in the - the white fraction in the marble zone in 523.
1444039|CC|Copy that.
1444046|CDR|Bob, I forgot to give you the core numbers, but I will.
1444050|CC|Okay. And don't forget to put your little note in the long can there.
1444100|CDR|Oh, I'll get the note in there. I'll get it in there. Nobody will ever know.
1444130|PAO|Gene Cernan extracting the drive tube.
1444143|CDR|Okay, Bob, our 524 is what I think is a blue-gray rock probably the breccia. It's got a little dust cover.
1444153|CC|Copy that.
1444154|CDR|From just off the rim of this little crater.
1444202|CC|Okay, copy that. It's a blue-gray rock, it's not part of the trench, right? You finish with the trench?
1444209|CDR|Yes. If you see, Bob, it's full. See that?
1444214|CC|Roger. We see a long thing in your hand there, Gene.
1444230|LMP|Well, I didn't think that was supposed to happen.
1444236|CDR|And I'd know, Jack? Shoot! Thought I had them on the Rover.
1444243|LMP|What?
1444244|CDR|Oh, the core cap covers. I'll get them.
1444246|LMP|No, you got some there in that little ca - in that little pocket.
1444250|CDR|Yes, but there are so many bags in here, I can't get at them.
1444252|LMP|No, I mean the pocket on the Rover, on the bag. Remember?
1444257|CDR|No, they're not. I took them out and put them on you.
1444259|LMP|Oh, okay.
1444300|CDR|The rest of them are in this bag. I'll come and get them.
1444309|CDR|See, the other - this other - but I don't want to get into your seat. We got those bags pi - packed in there like gangbusters. How are you doing there by yourself?
1444317|LMP|Well, it's hard.
1444319|CDR|Your hook came off. If you wait a minute, I'll hook it on this bag. See. See.
1444329|LMP|I never - I didn't think the sample bag could come off the camera. But they can.
1444337|CDR|Yes. Doggone it.
1444340|LMP|What's your problem?
1444343|CDR|Just as well fix this bag now. Let me get this bag - it's going to come off at the bottom if we don't. It's going to come off again. I don't think the harness is tight enough now.
1444400|LMP|Want to tighten the harness?
1444404|CDR|Yes, I got to, Jack.
1444405|LMP|Okay.
1444406|CDR|Let me get your harness - I might just as well do it, so it's right. If it's worth doing at all, it's worth doing right. Now, let me try getting that bag back on. No, don't bend over, I can't get down there.
1444430|LMP|Okay.
1444431|CDR|You're plenty short enough.
1444433|LMP|Thanks - thanks a lot. (Laughter)
1444435|CDR|This bag now, that hook - or something changed the geometry.
1444441|CC|Okay, don't worry about it too much, guys; I'm sure the bag will stay on without the hook.
1444448|CDR|Yes, it will; the conclusion I just came to.
1444450|LMP|You through?
1444451|CDR|Yes, go ahead.
1444505|PAO|EVA time 4 hours 10 minutes.
1444542|LMP|Okay, Bob, what I know is a blue-gray breccia is in bag 525.
1444551|CC|Okay, copy that. And, Jack, you just skipping up - scooping up little rocks along the ... here - in your little xenolith mode? Go ahead, Gene.
1444607|LMP|Yes, ... you read my mind. I do want to get one of these light-colored rocks, though.
1444618|CC|Go ahead, Gene.
1444622|CDR|Bob, the - when I broke the cores apart, there's just a lot of dried clods and - and the bottom core's full, the top core about - oh, I got to look - it's dark down there, but about an inch -inch and a half of the core is just - just zero g to 1/6 g'd itself right out.
1444648|CC|Okay, we copy that. I guess we still just cover it, and see what we got. Might just again trying compacting it after that's through; after you're done with the lower core.
1444700|CDR|Yes. I'll do that.
1444726|CC|And, Geno, how about - -
1444727|LMP|Bag 526.
1444730|CC|Copy; 526.
1444732|CDR|Okay, in a long can - I'll give it to you; wait a minute.
1444737|LMP|And that may have been a piece of gabbro. But again, I can't be completely sure.
1444743|CC|Copy that. Go ahead, Gene.
1444747|LMP|It's either that or anorthositic gabbro we saw up on the front. Up on the massif.
1444756|CC|Okay.
1444757|CDR|And my bags aren't staying on my camera worth a darn.
1444800|CDR|Forty-six, Bob, is going into the long can.
1444803|CC|Copy that.
1444820|LMP|Boy, another exercise in dexterity. Okay, LMP has gone to INTERMEDIATE.
1444840|CDR|And, by the way, I'm at about 49 percent and 3.85 and INTERMEDIATE cooling and no flags.
1444847|CC|Okay, copy that, Geno. Have you got a number for the upper core when you done - I guess you're probably putting the other one in the long can, aren't you, right now.
1444856|CDR|Yes, yes, yes; that's right.
1444900|CC|And somewhere here along the line, Jack, I guess maybe when you get those, you ought to stop and take the pan.
1444909|LMP|Okay, Bob.
1444911|CDR|Okay, Bob, the long can is sealed and I guess nobody knows what's in it but me.
1444917|CC|No one ever will, probably.
1444922|CDR|I may not - I may not even tell. It does not - none of the material in this core, in either the top section or the bottom section, look unlike that - that stuff just beneath the surface that we sampled at that special stop back there. It's a bluish-gray, and it tends to clod and break up in your hand. And that's core 31 - the number is 31.
1444951|CC|Okay. Copy. Thirty-one on the ...
1445000|CDR|Oh, man. Bob, you've got better than - oh, you've got two-thirds of a core after I packed it down a little bit.
1445024|CC|Okay, thank you, Geno. Copy that.
1445031|LMP|Okay, that little set of 4 samples is in 527, barely.
1445039|CC|Okay, we hope it was worth the effort.
1445044|LMP|Oh, it's all worth the effort; it just hurts.
1445048|CC|Okay. We're ready now for your pan and don't forget your scoop.
1445054|LMP|I won't - Ahh! - You don't mind a little dirt here and there, do you, gang?
1445118|CC|No.
1445130|PAO|Jack Schmitt having a few problems.
1445149|LMP|Oh, dadgummit. Well - -
1445156|CC|Hey, Gene, would you help - would you go over and help Twinkletoes, please?
1445203|LMP|I tell you - you fix that camera bracket so the bags stay on and I'll be a lot better off.
1445208|CC|Roger.
1445209|CDR|Want some help, Jack? I'll be there.
1445210|LMP|No, I don't need any help.
1445212|CDR|Okay.
1445213|CC|Hey, Jack, you might worry about whether - you might worry about whether your camera lens is dirty or clean, Jack. I don't know what you do about it.
1445221|LMP|I'm very worried about that.
1445222|CC|I don't know what you do about it, but you might worry about it.
1445224|LMP|I don't have a thing to do - it's clean.
1445239|CDR|Well, I'll be a son of a gun.
1445241|LMP|What's your problem?
1445242|CDR|(Chuckle) can't get this thing locked on.
1445245|LMP|What the - -
1445246|CDR|The rake!
1445247|LMP|The rake?
1445249|CDR|Yes. That should lock. I turn that like that - there it comes.
1445255|CC|Jack, have you ever started your pan, so we get an EMU check from you?
1445303|LMP|Well, it's about 50 percent. About 385.
1445308|CC|Okay, copy that.
1445309|LMP|And no flags. ... Come on. Get back in there.
1445337|PAO|Jack Schmitt taking a 360 degree panorama now with the camera.
1445343|CDR|Okay, that's all put away. That goes back on your back. I'll get it.
1445351|CC|Why don't you go over and - over towards Jack, Gene, and then the two of you can pick up the scoop and the bag together and get back towards the Rover after that?
1445404|CDR|Yes, I'm cleaning up this seat here - I'll do that I think I can hack it.
1445409|CC|And then, at that point, we're ready for you guys ... and, at that point, we're ready for you guys to leave.
1445416|CDR|Whew - Okay. Jack, I've got the rammer I've got to put on you. I'll just leave it on your seat right now?
1445432|LMP|Okay.
1445436|CC|We're watching you, Jack.
1445441|LMP|What's that?
1445442|CC|I said we're watching you, but don't let that inhibit you.
1445448|LMP|I don't - Bob, I don't let anything inhibit me - and I don't stay mad very long.
1445456|CC|That was very good.
1445504|LMP|(Laughter) Well, there's an easy way to do everything. The question is can you hang on to it once you've done it?
1445522|CDR|Let me get those, Jack. Don't get down there. Let me get those.
1445527|LMP|Where are you? They don't stay on my camera anymore.
1445533|CDR|Well, we'll fix it.
1445535|LMP|There's no reason why they shouldn't, according to this. But there are a lot - -
1445539|CDR|Okay, Those - the samples from that - Oh - I need - I gotta go up there - Wait! Take an after - cross-Sun, from over to the north of the gnomon.
1445549|LMP|You didn't get an after, huh?
1445550|CDR|No.
1445551|LMP|How come you're cleaning up the Rover?
1445552|CDR|Oh, I got it - I'll get it.
1445554|CDR|If you'll mount this thing.
1445556|LMP|Just set it there. Just set it there. I'll take four deep breaths.
1445602|CDR|Bob, what else do you want us to do here?
1445604|CC|Nothing. Get on the Rover and leave. Get the heck out.
1445606|CC|Don't forget the gnomon.
1445608|LMP|Okay. No, we're going back to get that after - and we won't forget it.
1445619|CDR|I think you might be able to decipher this station, Bob.
1445626|CC|That's the general idea. And be advised that the switchboard here at MSC has been lit up by calls from the Houston Ballet Foundation requesting your services for next season.
1445640|LMP|I should hope so.
1445645|CDR|Well, we can't use that one. The right-hand gate lock is - -
1445651|LMP|How's that?
1445652|CDR|- nonfunctional and the left one is almost nonfunctional.
1445659|CC|Okay.
1445706|LMP|We - once you get it open, you can't get it locked. I'll dust them if I get a chance, but it's locked on the left side.
1445713|CC|Okay, well, we'll keep those bags under your feet, anyway.
1445715|LMP|Here, I'll work on it.
1445716|CC|I think the samples are safer under there, anyway.
1445721|CDR|We don't have any room. ... we can take bag 7 out.
1445726|CDR|That one is locked - in good shape.
1445728|CDR|Let's press on. We got the reading? Let me put the rammer on your back and see if we can't get this on your camera.
1445747|LMP|Are we going to run the SEP this time?
1445749|CDR|I don't know; he hasn't said anything. I expect he will.
1445751|CC|No, we will not turn the SEP on, Jack. You might cover it with a blanket as well as you can. And how about a temperature reading before you leave, when you do that?
1445801|CDR|It's 100.
1445803|CC|Copy that, 100, and understand both switches are OFF and the covers are closed.
1445807|CDR|Okay. Well, the covers are closed now. They weren't.
1445812|CC|Okay. Roger. That's what I mean.
1445815|CDR|Okay. Turn - turn the other way, left. I think it might just put you there.
1445821|LMP|Well, I don't know why it isn't staying on, but it certainly isn't.
1445824|LMP|... Move over there.
1445824|CDR|Okay.
1445827|LMP|Is that the same one? I may have bent it.
1445832|CDR|I think you did now.
1445833|LMP|Yes. I just bent that, didn't I?
1445839|CDR|Yes, that's not going to stay on. Yes, you bent it (laughter) very well.
1445845|LMP|... how I did that.
1445846|CDR|I don't know ... You'll lose these bags.
1445850|LMP|Okay, well, We'll - -
1445851|CDR|I got bags.
1445852|LMP|We'll revise our procedures.
1445854|CDR|I got bags.
1445855|LMP|I guess I bent my camera mounting brack - point, the camera point.
1445903|CDR|Turn around.
1445908|LMP|We may have to - think about a fix there.
1445913|CDR|We might be able to fix that in the cockpit.
1445914|LMP|Yes.
1445916|CC|Okay - -
1445916|LMP|Okay, are we all through, have you got - -
1445918|CC|- - worry about that right, when you get back in.
1445919|PAO|Jack Schmitt waving.
1445931|LMP|Okay. Okay, where are we here?
1445933|CDR|I'll get on.
1445935|LMP|Okay. Oh, I guess I need to get another film mag, huh?
1445939|CC|Okay, how about the frame counts on both you guys before you start?
1445946|LMP|152 on the LMP -
1445951|CC|We suggest magaline - magazine Juliett, please.
1445957|CDR|(Laughter) Okay, we'll get magaline Julieing. The CDR's on 118.
1450005|CC|Okay, copy that, Geno.
1450011|LMP|Fire fire, two frames. You know, I'd enjoy this if it weren't so much fun.
1450021|CDR|Okay, you going to change your mag.
1450023|LMP|Yes.
1450024|CDR|Shoot a 500 while you're doing that. (Laughter)
1450027|LMP|Listen to me - -
1450028|LMP|Yes.
1450028|CDR|Look at my thumb.
1450029|LMP|I know.
1450030|CC|17, we'd really like the - -
1450031|LMP|Any time you want to do something, though.
1450033|CC|- - we'd like to press on as quickly as possible.
1450036|CDR|I got it.
1450037|LMP|Got it?
1450038|CDR|Got it.
1450038|CC|In case you didn't get.
1450039|CDR|Take a portion of the scarp over there you can see.
1450042|CC|17, do you copy? Houston.
1450047|CDR|What?
1450048|CC|We'd like to press on - -
1450049|CDR|What?
1450049|CC|- - as soon as possible, please.
1450052|CDR|Yes, we are, Bob, but - but he's got to change his mag.
1450058|CC|Roger.
1450059|CDR|I'm going to stand here and look around.
1450101|CC|Okay.
1450110|CDR|Okay, I'm picking up with mag - or with frame 56 and I'm going to try to get a little bit of where the scarp overlaps the North Massif. I can't see much of it.
1450131|CDR|All I could get was three frames of that. Now I'm picking up the South Massif.
1450145|PAO|Jack Schmitt, changing the film magazine in his camera.
1450230|CDR|Okay, how are you coming, Jack?
1450232|LMP|Okay. Oh, I ought to put that in there so you've got room for your camera.
1450239|CC|You got a final frame count there, Gene?
1450246|LMP|Okay, I'm all set.
1450255|CDR|Okay, Bob. When I finished with South Massif, I was on 94 and I took - now I'm on 99 - I took five more pictures back over to the northeast.
1450307|CC|We copy that. And we assume you guys are ready to go by now.
1450313|CDR|And, Bob, they were all with the lens - Yes, sir - they were all with the lens cap off.
1450322|CC|Splendid.
1450330|LMP|Okay.
1450332|CC|Okay. And, Jack, what's the headings say? And we'll - -
1450334|LMP|Why don't you fix that high gain so you can see?
1450336|CC|We'll - we'll get the reading we need for the nav update. Do you think you can give us the heading right now?
1450345|LMP|Okay, heading is 41 - I think. I'm at a little bit of an angle. Better let Gene do it for you.
1450356|CC|Okay. We're waiting.
1450357|LMP|I got some - Gee, I've got some parallax. I think it's 41, though.
1450405|CDR|What you looking at?
1450406|LMP|The headings.
1450407|CDR|43 - 043 is what I gave them earlier.
1450412|CC|Yes, we were wondering if it drifted while you were there, because we're going to give you now a - -
1450415|CDR|Bob, let me - -
1450416|CC|- - going to give you one to update it if it has drifted at all.
1450420|CDR|Okay, it did drift, 041 is a good number.
1450423|CC|Okay. Stand by.
1450429|PAO|We'll get a picture back at Station 4 which is the crater, Shorty.
1450433|CC|Okay. That's fine. No torque necessary, Geno.
1450436|LMP|I'm strapped.
1450439|CDR|You liked the drift, huh?
1450441|CC|Great.
1450442|CDR|Okay, I'll - Dadgummit.
1450446|PAO|Estimated driving time 16 minutes.
1450446|LMP|What's wrong? Oh, the hammer?
1450447|CDR|Yes. Every time. Okay, let's go.
1450451|LMP|All right, sport.
1450453|CDR|I'm going to head -
1450455|LMP|We didn't really do all the things we wanted do, but I think we did everything we could.
1450458|CC|We did everything we wanted to ... timeline ...
1450459|CDR|Okay, let's get ready to roll.
1450500|LMP|Flight line stereo.
1450504|CDR|Okay, Bob - Oh -
1450507|LMP|You got the TGE ... on and the low gain is 060.
1450511|CDR|You get the gnomon in?
1450513|LMP|Didn't you get it? Wait a minute.
1450515|CDR|You took the after. It's not sitting out there.
1450518|LMP|No, I thought I handed - didn't you stick it in -
1450520|CDR|Yes, I stuck it in. I got it. Okay. We can look back (laughter).
1450531|CDR|... Bob.
1450535|LMP|I sure thought I handed it to you, Geno.
1450536|CDR|You did, and I put it in.
1450539|LMP|Okay, that's good. Okay, whoo-boy, rest the old hands.
1450601|CC|Okay, we've recommendations for MINIMUM for you. Gene - Jack.
1450603|LMP|... ejecta. It's double -
1450609|CDR|I think I am in MINIMUM.
1450611|CC|Jack, that was, sorry - Jack.
1450611|CDR|I am already.
1450612|LMP|Yes, I'll go to MINIMUM. Yes, I will.
1450621|CC|And give us a mark rolling, please.
1450626|CDR|Yes, Bob, I gave you one. We've been rolling for about 30 seconds.
1450629|CC|Copy that.
1450630|CDR|We're at 087 - 087 and 5.9 on that range.
1450636|CC|Copy that.
1450640|CC|And the drive to Station 4 will be nominal and we'll get a Rover sample at about 094/5.1 but it will be the track as indicated on the map and the cuff checklist.
1450657|LMP|Okay. Going to Shorty.
1450708|CDR|Okay. On our way.
1450710|LMP|You got your checklist there?
1450712|CDR|Yes, I got it in front of me.
1450714|LMP|Okay.
1450715|CDR|And, we're heading - heading is 069, around - Well, up - I got it -
1450720|LMP|Yes, that's pretty close.
1450722|CDR|I know we're next to that band but I know where we're going, next is 094/5.1 is what I want for that sample.
1450729|LMP|Yeah. Zero what?
1450732|CDR|I think he said 094/5.1.
1450734|LMP|He meant - 052 is what's nominal. What's the sample again, Bob?
1450739|CC|5.1; 094/5.1.
1450751|LMP|Oh, okay, that's the heading.
1450753|CDR|All right. You got 094/5.1.
1450755|LMP|Yes, got it. Just drive by this big rock.
1450803|CDR|Want to look at it. Can't see it. I can't see when that LCRU shines into my eyes. Looks like one of the gray breccias.
1450824|LMP|Big 3-meter - 3 to 4-meter block out here all by itself on the light mantle - I got some pictures it was at 088/5.6.
1450837|CC|Okay, copy that.
1450838|LMP|And it looked like a gray breccia, I'm not sure though, all I could see was the surface texture, and it had the modular or elongate modular texture that those breccias had up on the South Massif.
1450854|CC|Okay, copy that, Jack.
1450900|LMP|Where are you, Shorty?
1450902|CDR|And the battery temperatures are 100 and 130.
1450908|CC|Copy that.
1450911|LMP|Okay, Bob, as far as any of the things we talked about trying to see at the surface, dynamics or a variation of the light mantle, I think you've heard it all, there isn't much to say about the dynamics right now. I have a feeling that the surfaces are old enough that all those kind of detailed relationships have been obscured. Filleting is just about the same all over here, it varies, but there are no systematics that I've seen.
1450947|CC|Okay, copy that. Do we ever see a Rover flag come up when you've got high temperatures there on the battery - have you seen the flag up yet?
1450955|CDR|No, you didn't. No, you did not, you did not.
1450958|CC|Okay, that may be telling us something, we hope. Press on.
1451007|PAO|And Ron Evans in America are about 13-1/2 minutes away from loss of signal on the twenty-ninth lunar revolution. Ron will be getting his evening meal within a few minutes, and in about an hour and a half will begin his rest period.
1451015|LMP|Okay. LMP is in MINIMUM.
1451020|CC|Copy that, thank you.
1451024|LMP|Okay. Ought to cut left up here a little bit.
1451028|CDR|Yes, I think so. Ooh!
1451034|LMP|Don't - Keep her going. (Laughter)
1451039|CDR|Good lord! Was that a - ... aspect ratio of that little thing.
1451041|LMP|Yes, that's what they call a pit crater. Can you swing a little bit and let me get that fragment crater - see that one on your left there?
1451056|LMP|Quite a scene up here. Got your pictures? Pictures?
1451107|CDR|Yes, I got them.
1451108|CDR|Okay, Bob. We're at 090/5.3 for a quick Rover sample of a very, very fragmental crater. The ejecta is about 50-percent small angular fragments much different than we have seen before in terms of the type of patterns.
1451128|CC|Okay, copy.
1451128|CDR|Okay, and that's in bag 41 Yankee.
1451140|CDR|And we're on our way.
1451142|CC|Great.
1451147|CDR|Get your picture, Jack?
1451148|LMP|Yes. LMP frame count is 15.
1451156|CC|Copy that.
1451157|CDR|About a 30-second stop. Okay, 094 - I'm 090, 5.3 now, Bob. We're heading toward your stop.
1451204|CC|Okay, 090, 5.3.
1451206|LMP|See Shorty out there yet?
1451207|CDR|Well, I -
1451218|LMP|Bob, I couldn't tell whether that was just - it looked like that that might have been a crater that had got to bedrock. There may have been a high point, or let's say a thin point in the light mantle, and it got down to bedrock. But I can't - it's the most blocky-rimmed crater we've seen for a long time.
1451237|CDR|Yes. All these others are nowhere near that - look at that.
1451240|LMP|No. It was about 15 meters in diameter.
1451254|LMP|Bob, there - there are no obvious lineations, at the scale we can observe, on the light mantle. I think the pan photography and the metric stuff may be what you'll have to use for any directional trends out in here. Depending on what we decide the origin is.
1451330|LMP|Bob, are you still reading?
1451332|CC|Roger. We're still reading you, Jack.
1451337|CDR|Okay. Are you reading us through the LM or through the low gain?
1451340|CC|As far as I can tell, we're reading you through the low gain. It's been working just great tonight, Geno.
1451347|CDR|Okay, that's great - -
1451349|LMP|Tonight?
1451349|CDR|- - because I just scraped bottom on the LCRU. If it's still working, I'm glad to hear that.
1451355|CDR|Okay, we're 093 and 5.2. We're almost there.
1451401|CDR|Going to be right on the rim of that crater.
1451409|CC|Okay. And, 17, the word from the backroom is - with that last Rover sample you got, we'd like to go straight to Station 4 - and we won't get the one here at 094 and 5.3 - 5.1, excuse me.
1451426|LMP|Bob, I thought the purpose was to sample the light mantle?
1451431|CC|I - We talked to them about that, but they - -
1451433|LMP|We didn't sample light mantle at that last one.
1451435|CC|- - I agree. I talked to them about that. But they are so anxious to get to Station 4, I guess they don't want to do it.
1451444|LMP|Well, how about it, Gene? A little real time -
1451447|CDR|I think we got to, right here.
1451448|LMP|I think we got it.
1451449|CDR|094, 5.1. You got your picture?
1451453|LMP|Yes. Okay, that's good enough.
1451455|CDR|You happy?
1451456|LMP|We'll get the sample - anyway.
1451459|CDR|Okay. 094, 5.1.
1451501|CC|Copy that.
1451503|CDR|That's good, Jack, Sample is in 42 Yankee.
1451510|CC|Copy that.
1451514|CDR|And we are rolling. And give me a bearing and a range to Station 4.
1451522|CC|Roger. It will be bearing of 100 and range of 4.6.
1451529|CDR|Okay. We're now at 5.0 - 094 and 5.0.
1451535|LMP|LMP frame count is 25.
1451539|CDR|Was that 100, 4.6?
1451542|CC|Roger, Gene.
1451611|LMP|Houston, there aren't very many rocks that just sit on the surface. All of them seem to - to be slightly buried to moderately buried. That one looked like it might be vesicular. There's a trench - linear set of craters.
1451644|CDR|Hold it, babe. We got to do a little detouring.
1451649|LMP|Okay, what we're looking for is 101 - -
1451654|CDR|Yes. 100, 4.6, I'll detour. I'll just get down this slope. I don't see Shorty though, do you?
1451702|LMP|Wait a minute, is that it? Is that it out there straight ahead?
1451711|CDR|Well, let me get down this slope.
1451712|LMP|Something's dark out there. I think that's it.
1451714|CDR|The - the dark - it might be right over there to the left a little bit?
1451718|LMP|Your left, yes.
1451718|CDR|Yes, right over there. I think I can cut it right across there. That's going to be about the right place.
1451722|LMP|Seems a little far from here - but - maybe not.
1451741|LMP|Oh, I forgot to take pictures again. Trying to shade my eyes. That Scarp certainly is spectacular going up there by Hanover, isn't it?
1451755|CDR|It just rolls over the side, doesn't it?
1451757|LMP|Yes.
1451800|LMP|I don't know what else we can say about it, though (chuckle). Okay, we're getting a good view of the North Massif, and the cross-hatched lineaments that Gene has talked about are over there, also. They seem to be a set that - that plunge about, oh, 30 degrees to the east and another set that plunge about the same to the west. Plus the boulder tracks, which we see occasionally over there. And there are areas - boulder fields up on the Massif itself, such as we saw on the South Massif. As a matter of fact, it looks like there's one just above where we may - where Station 6 may be. Straight ahead of us there, Geno.
1451901|CDR|Uh-hmm.
1451902|LMP|About bearing 060 from our present position, which is 098 and 4.8.
1451926|CDR|If I change that heading, that LCRU comes right in on me.
1451933|LMP|I don't see any - anything like layering up there. Although the upper boundary of those boulder fields on the North Massif, and, as a matter of fact, on the South Massif - -
1451949|CDR|That's Shorty straight ahead of us, I think. Yes, yes, that's got to be it.
1451954|LMP|- - all tend to have a linear boundary. That's the upper portion of the field; the lower portion is strung out downslope. That looks like it might be Shorty. Yes.
1452008|CDR|We're at 9 - 099, 4.7, Bob.
1452011|CC|Okay, great. Sounds like you're just about there.
1452017|CDR|Yes, I think we got it in front of us.
1452018|CC|Okay.
1452027|LMP|Bob, looking at the Sculptured Hills, I think Gene's comments the other day about Bare Mountain would apply. There's a small relief - or small amplitude hummockiness to the surface. It's formed by cross-hatch of - Let's say the slope I'm looking at is sort of west-facing slope. So on the other side of Wessex Cleft, it's formed by lineaments going - plunging about 10 degrees to the north and about 10 degrees to the south. And the combination gives some hummocks that are quite distinct.
1452114|CDR|Well, you know it's hard to see a blanket here, but that's got to be Shorty right there.
1452119|LMP|Okay - -
1452120|CDR|It's the only large - real large -
1452121|LMP|We want to park. I don't think we'll see a blanket down - -
1452124|CDR|I don't either.
1452127|LMP|It - Well, I think - At least we're going to see where the break in slope is for the rim. My goodness.
1452135|CDR|Oh, look at the boulders sitting on that rim.
1452138|LMP|It's different.
1452140|CDR|It is darker.
1452141|LMP|Let's go over there.
1452142|CDR|No question. We're at 101, 4.5-
1452148|CC|Copy that.
1452151|CDR|Okay - -
1452151|CC|Let us know when you stop and where you're - -
1452153|CDR|Which rim do you want to park on?
1452154|LMP|Well, I think we ought to park over here near that big boulder.
1452158|CDR|Yes - yes, if I can get up there. I think I can.
1452201|LMP|You can swing in, you know, and just park parallel to the - Of course, that will put them looking back. What - Can you park any direction?
1452210|CDR|Well, yes, but 045 gives me a good - Let me - I'll work on it.
1452214|LMP|Okay.
1452215|CDR|Let me get up there slowly. I'll put them on this low saddle here. 045 will give them a good heading.
1452223|LMP|Shorty is a crater, the size of which you know. It's obviously darker rimmed, although the fragment population for most of the blanket does not seem too different than the light mantle. But inside - Whoo, whoo, whoo!
1452238|CDR|Man, are you going to get a picture now.
1452240|LMP|Oh, yes.
1452242|CC|We can hardly wait.
1452243|CDR|That's about as far as I want to take it.
1452246|CC|Okay. And when you stop and get off, give me word and I'll read you up some revised plans for Station 4.
1452257|CDR|Okay, Bob, we're heading 041; bearing is 102; distance, 5.1; and 4.4 on the range. Amp-hours are 92, 90, 102, and 128 on the batteries. Off-scale low on the fronts, and off-scale low on the rears.
1452323|CC|Copy that. And did I understand 4.2 on the range, Gene?
1452332|CDR|Yes sir!
1452333|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1452335|CDR|I don't know whether you're wrong, or we are, but - -
1452339|CC|Sounds like an interesting crater, in any case.
1452340|CDR|- - this is an impressive one.
1452343|CDR|Wait until you see the bottom of it.
1452345|CC|Okay.
1452348|LMP|Okay, Houston. Shorty is clearly a darker rimmed crater. The inner wall is quite blocky over - but except for the western portion of it, which is less blocky than the others. The floor is hummocky, as we thought it was in the photograph. The central peak, if you will, or central mound, is very blocky and jagged. And the impression I have of the other mounds in the bottom is that they may - they look like Scarp masses that may have come off the side.
1452438|CC|Okay; copy that and - -
1452440|LMP|That's just what they look like. I'm not sure that - They have a - they have a bench appearance.
1452446|CC|- - Okay, and the primary priority - number 1 and 2 priorities - at this station will be samples from the crater rim and the pan from the crater rim. Over.
1452459|LMP|Okay, we've got a large boulder of very intensely fractured rock, right on the rim, right near the Rover. It looks like - it looks like a finely vesicular version of our clinopyroxene gabbro. It's obviously crystalline and has generally that same appearance. There is, in one spot here, some inclusions of a darker gray rock also intensely fractured. The fracture systems, I think, will show up well in the flight line stereo.
1452549|CDR|Bob, do you have TV?
1452551|CC|Roger. We have TV, and you might brush the lens for us before you run away.
1452557|CDR|Yes, I'll get it. I've got to get my battery covers cleaned.
1452602|LMP|Okay, I'm going to take a pan while I'm waiting for you.
1452604|CC|And we're going to want the SEP opened and dusted as well here so we'll be - switches turned off.
1452615|CDR|Ooo-kaay. Ooo-kaay.
1452622|LMP|Oh, hey - Wait a minute - -
1452627|CDR|What?
1452629|LMP|- - Where are the reflections? I've been fooled once. There is orange soil!
1452632|CDR|Well, don't move it until I see it.
1452635|LMP|It's all over! Orange!
1452639|CDR|Don't move it until I see it.
1452640|LMP|I stirred it up with my feet.
1452642|CDR|Hey, it is! I can see it from here!
1452644|LMP|It's orange!
1452646|CDR|Wait a minute, let me put my visor up. It's still orange!
1452648|LMP|Sure it is! Crazy! Orange! I've got to dig a trench, Houston.
1452659|CC|Copy that, I guess we'd better work fast.
1452700|CDR|Hey, he's not - he's not going out of his wits. It really is.
1452707|CC|Is it the same color as cheese?
1452708|CDR|Temperature on the SEP is about 100 and - temperature on the SEP's about 102.
1452715|LMP|It's almost the same color as the LMP decal on my camera.
1452722|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1452723|CDR|That is orange, Jack!
1452734|CDR|Boy, this brush is getting harder to get on and off too. But I sure don't want to lose it. Man, I may start putting that under my seat. Well, zap me with a little cold water. Okay, the SEP has been dusted. I think I gave you 102 or something like that.
1452816|LMP|Fantastic, sports fans. It's trench time. You can see this in your color television, I'll bet you.
1452826|CDR|How can there be orange soil on the Moon?
1452833|CDR|Jack, that is really orange. It's been oxidized. Go around and get the lunar sounder over here.
1452841|LMP|It looks just like a - an oxidized desert soil, that's exactly right.
1452848|PAO|Total stay time here 30 minutes.
1452851|CDR|Well, I'm going to clean their glasses so they don't - so they know we're - Can you wait a minute on that - on that pan you're taking?
1452857|LMP|I already took it.
1452859|CDR|No, I mean the television camera. I'll put you back where I had you.
1452911|CDR|Wow, I'll let you put your - right where you finished your pan.
1452917|LMP|You know - that orange - that orange is along a line, Geno, along the rim crest -
1452928|CDR|To follow - what? Circum - circumferential?
1452931|LMP|Yes. Man, if there ever was a (chuckle) - I'm not going to say it. But if there ever was something that looked like a fumarole alteration, this is it.
1452940|CDR|Okay, let me give you a gravimeter - -
1452943|CDR|MARK it.
1452944|CC|Okay, mark the gravimeter.
1452945|CDR|And she is flashing. Oh, never mind, Bob. I'm going to go to STANDBY. I've got to get my gnomon.
1452959|LMP|Hey, I think we hit one of those things we've got to reconsider on, Houston.
1453008|CC|Yes. The problem is we're looking at PLSS constraints right now, as luck would have it, of course.
1453015|CDR|MARK it. Gravimeter.
1453017|CC|Roger. Copy that.
1453022|CDR|What's wrong with the TV? Aren't you watching it?
1453029|CC|It seems to have died slowly there.
1453033|PAO|We're having tilt problems with the TV.
1453037|CDR|Well, stand by. Now, I'm going to give you another STANDBY and another MARK.
1453048|CC|Okay.
1453056|CDR|STANDBY, ON, and -
1453101|CDR|MARK it.
1453102|CC|Copy that.
1453105|LMP|Okay, Bob, I've trenched across the trend of the yellow - or the orange. There is light gray material on either side.
1453118|CDR|Oh, man, that's incredible.
1453120|LMP|Say, Gene, we're going to have to - -
1453122|CDR|That's incredible.
1453122|LMP|You need to get a down-Sun color - -
1453125|CDR|That's incredible.
1453126|LMP|- - as well as - I'll get my black-and-white.
1453129|CDR|I'll get it.
1453146|LMP|We also got to get that rock up there - that's - -
1453149|CDR|Yes, we'll get that. Okay, let's start sampling that trench. We've got to get - that's - -
1453155|LMP|Okay.
1453156|CDR|- - That's phenomenal. Look at where the contact between the gray and the -
1453158|LMP|Yes. Right, and it's on both sides - -
1453200|CDR|Before you disturb it, let me just get a couple of closeups of that.
1453203|LMP|Hey, can you get a down-Sun? I think your color will be best down-Sun.
1453206|CDR|Okay.
1453207|LMP|Go to f/11. Get a little closer, Geno, if you think you're minimum.
1453216|LMP|Come up. There you go.
1453222|CDR|Let me get one more. Hey, you want any of this bagged in a - in the can, Bob? Canned in the bag - or whatever it is?
1453233|CC|Stand by. They're debating that right now.
1453236|CDR|Are they?
1453238|CC|Roger. Let's get the short can for some of that and - -
1453240|LMP|Okay, the color is - -
1453243|CDR|Okay let us get the - let us sample it first, then we'll get it.
1453254|LMP|It's quite - it's - it's indurated.
1453302|LMP|Aah - Go back and get that one.
1453306|CDR|Go get a new chunk.
1453307|LMP|I'll go get a new chunk.
1453307|CDR|Give me that, and get a new one. Give me that. Get some more.
1453311|LMP|I'm going to slow down here.
1453312|CDR|Yes, just take it easy.
1453315|LMP|I can't see into this.
1453316|CDR|I can't see when your shadow is there.
1453318|LMP|Can you get around on the other side?
1453319|CDR|Yes.
1453320|LMP|Because I can't see to sample.
1453332|LMP|Oh. Well. Yes, that's it.
1453344|CDR|See if you can get a sample right across that contact too.
1453346|LMP|I will. Okay, bag that one.
1453349|CDR|Bag 509 has got the - the orange material from, oh, about 2 to 3 inches down.
1453403|CC|Copy that.
1453416|CC|Okay, we're suggesting INTERMEDIATE for you, Jack.
1453425|LMP|Okay, the light gray, which is on either side - we sample the - the - Want me to get some more?
1453438|CDR|Yes, a little more.
1453443|LMP|It's - all of this is getting mixed a little bit with a - about a half-centimeter thick light-gray or a medium-gray covering over the whole area.
1453456|CDR|Bob, the gray material that is adjacent to the red material is in at 5 - how would I say 510.
1453505|CC|Copy that.
1453506|CDR|I had it, and I can't see it now.
1453508|LMP|And the LMP is INTERMEDIATE.
1453509|CC|Copy that.
1453510|CDR|510, Bob.
1453511|CC|Copy that.
1453512|CDR|And that - and that orange band is about a meter wide, I think.
1453516|LMP|About a meter.
1453517|CDR|You can't get to the end of it - bottom of it though, can you?
1453519|LMP|I haven't been able to yet.
1453522|CC|Okay.
1453522|LMP|Just to be sure, why don't we sample this side of it, too?
1453526|CDR|Then I'm going to go get the can.
1453529|LMP|Okay - one.
1453532|CDR|If I can remember where we put it. Bob, where did we put the small can?
1453534|LMP|It's in the - it's in bag 7 under my seat.
1453537|CDR|Okay. That's good. 511 has the gray from the other side of the orange band. And the other side happens to be the crater side.
1453549|LMP|That's right. North side.
1453555|CDR|Okay. Why don't you look around a minute, and I'll get that can.
1453558|LMP|Okay. I'm going to see - see if this goes on down here as a zone.
1453614|CDR|It looks like it's - ellipsoidal area if my footprints are any indication.
1453618|CC|17, Houston. We'd like to get the double core here instead of the small can. - Double core, please, instead of the small can.
1453627|CDR|Okay.
1453628|LMP|Did you want it in the orange?
1453631|CC|Roger. That affirm. We can put cores in gray soil all the time.
1453639|LMP|Well, it's a vertical stratigraphy. Do you want to go sideways a little with it? Or you just want to get it as deep as you can, huh?
1453652|CC|I expect we want to get - let's go as deep as we can in the orange, please, there, Jack. And the one problem at this station, Jack, is not that - -
1453658|LMP|All right.
1453659|CC|- - we can ... decide priorities between this station or any other station. It's the fact that we're running up against the walkback constraints here in just a very few minutes, about 20 minutes.
1453712|LMP|Okay.
1453715|CDR|Okay, Bob, and the bottom will be 44, and the top will be 35.
1453722|CC|Copy that. And after the core, we'd like for you to go over and sample some of that - some of the big rocks there on the rim, if you could very quickly. That'll be the next order of priority after that.
1453741|LMP|We will.
1453741|CDR|Yes, sir.
1453741|CC|And I'm not sure whether your pan will look down into the crater or not, Jack. But if it didn't, we'd like to get another one from there. Hey, there's the crater.
1453749|CDR|It did. Yes - yes - look into it yourself and - and then, I'll also get you a stereo pan before we leave. I can do that.
1453758|CC|Roger. That's some crater.
1453803|LMP|Got your hammer?
1453804|CDR|Yes. I've practiced too long on taking stereo pans of craters, without getting one here.
1453811|LMP|I got mine from right - just right down there, Gene. So -
1453817|CDR|What is that right there?
1453819|LMP|What?
1453821|CDR|That right there.
1453822|LMP|I don't see - Oh, it's a piece of glass, probably.
1453827|CDR|Boy, it sure is.
1453829|LMP|Hey, how about right up here?
1453842|LMP|You know that - we were almost - we just about got (laugh) to the upper edge of this little ellipsoid zone. I think we're going to have to - we've messed up most of it. Let's try right over here.
1453900|CDR|I've got a little piece of glass in my pocket.
1453903|LMP|Bob, the upper portion of the core is going to be a little bit disturbed, because we've walked around the area so much.
1453911|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1453916|CDR|There was a little piece of black glass - -
1453920|LMP|You may want to get up here - -
1453921|CDR|- - solid black glass.
1453922|LMP|Okay. That - did you get a - hold it, and I'll get a shot.
1453926|CDR|Take your picture. That's about as far as I could shove it in.
1453933|CC|Okay. And, 17, while you're doing that, was the gray mantle over the top of this, or was this showing all the way through to the surface?
1453943|LMP|No, it was over the top. It was about a half a centimeter over the top.
1453946|CC|Copy that.
1453948|LMP|He's getting about - about 3 centimeters a whack.
1453952|CC|Very good.
1453954|CDR|I'll tell you, it's a lot harder going in than that double core was back there. It's pretty hard.
1453959|LMP|It acts like it's inherently cohesive. It breaks up in angular fragments.
1454006|CC|Copy that.
1454007|LMP|An essential portion of the zone is - actually has a crimson hue, or red hue. Outside of that it's orange. And outside of that, it's gray.
1454020|CDR|Wait a minute, Jack.
1454021|LMP|That's all right, take it easy. I'd offer to hit it, but I don't think I can, my hands are so tired.
1454030|CDR|I'm going up to max here for just a minute or 2.
1454034|CC|Copy that.
1454034|CDR|Okay, let me hit some more. Ready?
1454037|LMP|Yes, go ahead.
1454039|CDR|Watch it - I'm afraid. Jack, it's stable enough. Why don't you get out of the way? I'm afraid if I leave go of this thing, you'll get it in the head.
1454043|LMP|Okay. Have at it. He's still getting a centimeter a whack, P00r guy. Let's see. I didn't get a locator, I better get a locator. Oh, it's in the - No, it isn't.
1454105|CDR|The only thing I question is our ability to get it out. Man, that's really hit bottom.
1454118|LMP|Has it?
1454119|CDR|Yes.
1454120|LMP|Okay, do I have core tubes on me now? I mean caps?
1454122|CDR|Yes.
1454123|LMP|Caps.
1454124|CDR|Yes, sir.
1454126|LMP|And the rammer.
1454127|CDR|Yes.
1454127|LMP|Okay - only -
1454129|CDR|That's all the way down. But, I really - -
1454131|LMP|That's it. Thanks, Geno.
1454132|CDR|- - I really wonder about getting it out.
1454133|LMP|Well, we'll give it the old college try.
1454135|CDR|Yes, we ought to be good at getting cores out by now.
1454137|LMP|It'll come out.
1454139|CDR|Whew - Okay.
1454141|LMP|It wouldn't dare not come out - wait a minute - -
1454145|CDR|Is there enough to hold on to?
1454146|LMP|Whoops - Which side you got?
1454149|CDR|I was just getting this out for you. Let me - I can get this side better.
1454152|LMP|Okay.
1454155|CDR|Ready?
1454156|LMP|Okay.
1454156|CDR|Go. Okay, pull slowly. Slowly so I can cap it all right. Let me get a cap.
1454201|LMP|Okay.
1454202|CDR|Okay. Hold it - hold it - let me get a cap.
1454204|LMP|... get the cap.
1454206|CDR|Okay. Now, wait a minute.
1454209|LMP|Are you ready?
1454210|CDR|Okay, very slow. Even the core tube is red!
1454214|LMP|Look at that!
1454215|CDR|Even the core is red! The bottom one's black - black and orange, and the top one's gray and orange!
1454222|LMP|The fact is, the bottom of the core is very black compared to anything we've seen.
1454227|CDR|Hey, we must have gone through the red soil because it's filled, but it's filled with a black material.
1454232|LMP|Let me see, Gene.
1454233|CDR|Dark gray, almost a very very fine grained - -
1454236|LMP|That might be a magnet - magnetite.
1454239|CC|Fantastic.
1454239|CDR|... I got it.
1454240|CC|Fantastic.
1454241|LMP|Go ahead.
1454242|CDR|Okay.
1454245|CDR|But it, it, it -
1454247|LMP|Let me - god, it is black isn't it?
1454250|CDR|Yes. I've got to get it so I can get the - Boy, it is black and is it contrasted to that orange stuff. Very black. Well, not very black. It's a good dark gray. Very dark bluish gray.
1454304|LMP|Yes - contrast.
1454305|CDR|Okay, turn that thing so I can push this cap a little bit. Just turn -
1454308|LMP|Which way?
1454308|CDR|Either way. Just turn the whole tube.
1454310|LMP|Oh, okay.
1454311|CDR|It's just easier to turn the tube than my hand - -
1454313|LMP|(Laughter)
1454313|CDR|- - some more. I don't want this cap to come off. Okay. I'm going to INTERMEDIATE cooling. Okay. Now you don't have any caps, so let's take this back to the Rover.
1454325|LMP|Where's the hole?
1454326|CDR|Why don't you take a picture of the hole, while you've got a camera there?
1454330|LMP|Be careful with that.
1454331|CDR|Yes.
1454332|CC|The caps are in SCB-7. They're under the LMP seat.
1454335|LMP|Well, the hole's most - the hole's mostly in shadow.
1454341|CC|And, 17 - -
1454343|CDR|Yes, I got them Bob.
1454344|CC|- - And, 17, so you're at a spot - we'd like - We have to be leaving here - not like - we have to be here in 14 minutes on the move because of walkback constraints. And we'd like to get a quick sample of the basalt up there on the rim, and Gene's stereo pan, and then press on. And I emphasize that the walkback constraint we're up against in 14 minutes - 13 now.
1454408|LMP|Okay, Bob, I'll get a sample - I'll doc - I'll sample it by hand. But it'll be documented. And I'll get it in a bag in a minute since I don't have any.
1454418|CDR|Come back this way when you do. I need that rammer again.
1454422|LMP|Oh, okay. Well, I better come there first, I guess.
1454426|CDR|Well, I don't need it right this second - -
1454428|LMP|Okay.
1454428|CC|Why don't you leave the core there Gene, and you can take the stereo pan while Jack's getting that sample. And then you can get together and ram the core home.
1454440|CDR|Okay. Bob, the bottom of the upper core is also dark.
1454446|CC|Copy that. Sounds a little thin.
1454514|CDR|And, like you might expect, the top of the bottom core is dark, too.
1454518|CC|How about that.
1454518|CDR|... It - if I ever saw a classic alteration halo around a volcanic crater, this is it. It's ellipsoidal. It appears to be zoned. There's one sample we didn't get. We didn't get the more yellowy stuff, we got the center portion -
1454544|CDR|Let me get those caps, Jack. What's - That's what's holding it. Holding it from coming out.
1454557|LMP|Steal a bag.
1454558|CDR|Okay.
1454609|LMP|Okay, the - I got it. Basalt is in bag 512.
1454620|CC|Copy that.
1454637|LMP|I'm getting in your bag here Gene. Got it. Okay.
1454652|CDR|Jack, our lock is on the outside here, so we ought to watch this gauge.
1454658|LMP|What happened?
1454659|CDR|Not going to worry about it. This lock is on the outside of that lever lock - out there. You'll see what I mean when you look at the lock. Okay, I'm going to go get my pan.
1454713|LMP|Okay.
1454715|CDR|The cores are not rammed yet. You want to ram them while you're here?
1454718|LMP|What did you do with my extension handle? Oh, it's -
1454720|CDR|Here. And If you want to ram them - -
1454722|LMP|Okay.
1454723|CDR|- - there you are. They're not rammed.
1454724|LMP|I'll get them.
1454730|CDR|Okay, Bob, I'm going several meters around to the east and towards the south to get this pan.
1454738|CC|Copy that.
1454742|CDR|And I - I'm going upslope. I'm circum - I'm - on the circum - Oh, you know, on the rim. And I'm up. Oh, that ought to be a beautiful shot, if I could see what my settings are.
1454757|LMP|Okay, the lower core is chucky-jam full. I don't think I've budged that thing.
1454807|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1454822|CC|Okay, and, Jack, I copied - aside from three trench samples, I copied one single rock - one single bag of basalt samples. is that correct?
1454834|LMP|That's right. 512.
1454836|CC|Copy that.
1454836|CDR|Hey, Bob, from where I am, about 100 meters around the west side of the rim of this crater, the mantle on the inside of the rim turns from this gray material we've been sampling - sampling in here, to a very dark gray material. And there's a lot of orange stuff that goes down - radially down into the - into the pit of the crater.
1454903|CC|Okay. Copy that. Outstanding!
1454909|LMP|Hey, Bob, those cores didn't feel like they - the follower went down at all.
1454915|CC|Okay.
1454916|LMP|Shouldn't it have gone a little bit?
1454918|CC|Not necessarily, if it's pretty compact stuff. You were having a hard time getting it in.
1454925|LMP|Well, I thought there was a little space up there, but maybe I just didn't feel it.
1454929|CC|Hot very much - -
1454930|LMP|I don't think there's much danger of them coming apart.
1454932|CC|Okay. Great.
1454937|CDR|I got to take a couple of more pictures at that contact slope over there. I know - you can't see it from where you are, Jack, but I guess we got to leave. Otherwise it would be nice to sample that dark stuff up on top.
1454947|CC|We need you guys rolling in 7 minutes.
1454953|CDR|We can get a spool - oh, I bet I'm out of film! Well, I got them all anyway, Bob. I'm at 162. I'm out of film. That stuff - and you're looking at me with the camera - that stuff is up toward that boulder, around that - about as far away from that boulder on the other side as we are on this side. And we want a hack at that boulder, too. Jack, let's see if we can't get that boulder, anyway.
1455025|CDR|But I don't have any film.
1455027|CC|Guys, we don't have that much time.
1455032|CDR|I know, Bob, I know. There's a lot of little pieces - not a lot - but enough that I've seen five or six of them. Little pieces of obsidian-like glass. I got one in my pocket. Unbagged. Undocumented. This boulder that you were looking at with the TV. I'm going to take a sample undocumented.
1455059|LMP|I got it! I got it!
1455100|CDR|Oh, you got it?
1455101|LMP|Yes.
1455101|CC|Yes.
1455102|LMP|Let's go.
1455103|CDR|I'm sorry, I didn't know you got that. Bag 461 has another sample of the - of basalt that I picked up right near where we dug the trench.
1455120|CC|Copy 561 [sic].
1455122|CDR|Okay, Bob, I'm going to give you something with the - I'm going to give you something with the TV. I want to show you where that dar - dark material starts.
1455133|LMP|Hold still, now.
1455133|CDR|As you - okay. As you look at the inner rim as it goes down (cough) to the right - you see a lot of boulders - a lot of rocks that are protruding out. Where that rock pattern thins out, just beyond that, is an orange - a visible orange radial pattern, and then beyond that is a definite change in albedo where you get the gray material, and a definite change in the number of - of rocks on the slope.
1455207|CC|Gene, Roger.
1455209|CDR|And that particular - -
1455210|CC|Copy that.
1455210|CDR|- - material can - -
1455211|CC|And if - -
1455211|CDR|- - and that particular material - that par - Let me finish, Bob! That particular rim material there continues around to the due north, and then there's a drastic change again where you see the - the inner rim completely terraced with this boulder fill.
1455234|CC|Okay, copy that, Gene - -
1455235|CDR|And I can't bet on it, but I can see it - -
1455235|CC|- - and you can talk about it when you get home.
1455240|CDR|Okay. As long as you're happy, I am.
1455242|LMP|Wait, Gene. Wait, wait, wait.
1455244|CDR|I got to get the film changed, Jack - -
1455246|CC|All right, Gene, change the film at the next - -
1455247|CDR|- - ...
1455248|LMP|Okay.
1455248|CC|- - station. We can save time that way.
1455252|CDR|All right.
1455253|CC|And we would like the SEP turned on before you leave -
1455255|CDR|We did that.
1455255|CC|- - and we'd like EP number 1 taken, Jack, so you can deploy that at Victory.
1455300|LMP|Okay. Okay.
1455305|CDR|I'll get - I'll get your scoop for you. Have you been leaving it cocked like that?
1455310|LMP|Yes.
1455311|CDR|Of course, we haven't been taking any SEP measurements, and I don't know what difference it makes.
1455332|CDR|Okay, everything is locked on, I guess - How are you reading, Bob?
1455338|CC|We've been reading you loud and - -
1455339|CDR|It's 70, 012, 501; 670, 012, 501.
1455346|CC|Okay, we copy that, Geno, and -
1455349|CDR|Okay, got the -
1455351|CC|Charge number 1 and - -
1455352|LMP|We got the gnomon, we got the rake - -
1455353|CC|- - we need the SEP on - -
1455359|CDR|SEP on, Jack? I'll get charge number 1 for you.
1455400|LMP|Okay. I'll get the SEP on.
1455402|CDR|I'll just hand it to you.
1455403|CC|And what's your frame count, Gene - Jack?
1455405|CDR|Charge number 1.
1455406|LMP|Okay, power - power's on, recorder's on, the temperature is 112.
1455417|CC|I copy that.
1455426|LMP|Can you get it, Geno?
1455427|CDR|Yes.
1455433|CDR|You get in - I'll hand it to you.
1455435|LMP|Okay,
1455436|CDR|And then I'll offer to get the TV.
1455438|CC|And, Jack, what's your frame count, please?
1455443|LMP|Wait, Bob, I can give you that on the Rover.
1455445|CC|Okay. I thought you were on there.
1455447|CDR|Okay, camera MODE switch is 1. Camera's going AFT - camera's going AFT. Well, I guess that's the breaks of life. Low gain on SEP when I get on, I'll give you - this when you're ready. First thing I got to do, Bob, is change film at the next station.
1455517|CC|That's affirm.
1455521|LMP|And, Bob, LMP is at 75.
1455525|CC|Say again, there, Jack, I - I missed that.
1455529|LMP|75.
1455531|CC|Copy that. Thank you.
1455536|CDR|I must be getting fatter, you know it.
1455539|LMP|Fatter?
1455541|CDR|Well -
1455543|LMP|Depends on how you get in. Where's your hammer?
1455546|CDR|Okay, we got a flag on the Rover.
1455549|LMP|Your hammer's caught again.
1455551|CDR|That's all right. We got a flag on the Rover, and I'm reading 136 on battery number 2.
1455559|CC|Say again on that one, Gene.
1455603|CDR|I'm reading 136 - make that 132 on battery number 2, and we did get a flag.
1455610|CC|Copy that.
1455615|CDR|Okay, Jack, I'm going to make a very sharp right turn here because I do not want to go down that hill.
1455625|LMP|Okay. We're moving, Houston.
1455627|CC|Roger. You're moving exactly 37 seconds on - early.
1455635|CDR|Early? I could have got - gotten that dark mantle on the side of that crater. That's all it would have taken me.
1455642|LMP|So you saw a radial orange, huh?
1455644|CDR|Yes, it was radial, Jack. You could see it very - It'll be in the pictures. Oh, man, I can't drive into that heading. Let me get my - -
1455652|LMP|That was on the inside of the crater?
1455654|CDR|On the inside rim of the crater.
1455656|LMP|Yes, that's where the surface ... keeps slumping off so it's exposed, probably.
1455702|CC|Quite a station, men. We thought - -
1455703|CDR|I'm going to get my ... Okay. I'm MIN.
1455703|CC|- - Station 2 was a good station.
1455711|CDR|Okay, I'm MIN. Man, I'll tell you, that - that heading is going to put us right - Okay, Bob, give me a - Dang - wait a minute.
1455722|CC|The heading you should be generally taking - -
1455723|CDR|Where we at?
1455723|CC|- - toward Victory is 090, Gene.
1455729|CDR|Okay, can you give me a bearing and range at Victory?
1455732|CC|Okay. Stand by.
1455734|LMP|Did you get the TGE read?
1455736|CDR|Yes, I did - I get it read. They got everything, that station - but not everything I'd like to give them.
1455742|CC|Okay, it's going to be - -
1455743|CDR|Houston - -
1455743|CC|- - 105 and 3.1.
1455747|CDR|Okay. Man, I tell you that LCRU is terrible, when it lashes into you.
1455755|LMP|Well, you can always zigzag.
1455757|CDR|Yes, that's what I've got to do. I've got to tack into that Sun.
1455809|PAO|Station 5 is at the crater Camelot.
1455810|LMP|I got it.
1455811|CDR|Okay. We got to go to Victory.
1455812|LMP|Houston, I don't know what exa - I didn't have time to really think at that station but that could - I think based on having found the alte - If I hadn't seen that alteration, and all I'd seen is the - is the fractured block on the rim, I might have - which looked like the stuff in the bottom - I might have said it was just another impact. But having all the color changes and everything, I think we might have to consider that it could be a volcanic vent.
1455848|CC|Roger. It surely was different, anyway.
1455850|LMP|I'm not sure how we - I'm not sure how we prove it. We didn't have time to prove it.
1455858|CC|We noticed. I guess that's the breaks of the game, sometimes.
1455903|CDR|Hey, Bob, I forgot your numbers at - I forgot your numbers at Victory. How about giving them to me, again?
1455909|CC|Okay. 105, 3.1. And it'll be a heading of 090 - -
1455915|CDR|Okay. Thank you.
1455915|CC|- - that's the general heading in that direction.
1455920|CDR|Okay. 105, 3.1.
1455924|CC|I guess we always have Station 9 to look forward to, guys. That may be the same thing - We'll probably be out of time when we get to that one, too.
1455937|PAO|A six pound explosive charge will be deployed near Victory on the way to Camelot and Station 5. This is the largest of the charges for the lunar seismic profiling experiment.
1455938|CDR|Nobody likes a pessimist.
1460011|CDR|Hey, Bob - I note on those radiators - I have been dusting the covers at every stop, whether that's any help or not.
1460019|CC|Okay; we copy that.
1460027|LMP|Okay, sports fans. We're still about on the - well, I think we moved - yes, we moved - we moved out into the Tortilla Flat area, I guess. Not very flat.
1460043|CC|That's affirmative.
1460051|CDR|Those kind I can go through, if I can see them coming.
1460054|LMP|102/3.8. And where's Victory?
1460101|CC|Dead ahead.
1460102|CDR|Boy, Victory is going to be subtle, I'll tell you. Bob, how long we been out?
1460112|CC|Stand by. 5 plus 26, 5 plus 26.
1460116|LMP|Hey - hey, Bob, I recommend that if we ever do this again they let me get off and pick the charge off when we want to deploy it. It really adds to the fatigue of the hands.
1460136|CC|I tell you - -
1460137|CDR|Couldn't you just hook it onto your fingers?
1460138|CC|We - we copy that, Jack. And Charlie's got a big smile on his face here.
1460150|LMP|Mark my words.
1460154|CDR|There's Victory over there, I bet. See that's the long edge.
1460157|LMP|Yes, yes. I can't see over there, but - -
1460159|CDR|Okay.
1460159|LMP|- - got too much Sun in my eyes.
1460202|CDR|That's the right way to go. That'll be about it, too.
1460209|PAO|Charlie is Charlie Duke the backup LMP.
1460210|CDR|Man, I haven't seen - I don't think I've really seen the LM, except ... - -
1460213|LMP|... big rock in front of you.
1460214|CDR|I got it.
1460215|LMP|Okay. Well, you can't tell much about the countryside going into the Sun, can you?
1460223|CDR|Put your upper visor down. That's what - that'll give you a whole different perspective.
1460228|LMP|It doesn't vise very well. It's stuck.
1460243|CDR|That's got to be Victory over there, Jack.
1460245|LMP|Yes.
1460302|CDR|We're at 103, 3.4.
1460306|CC|Copy that.
1460312|CDR|That is Victory.
1460316|LMP|We're still seeing the pit-bottom glass - the glass-lined, pit-bottomed craters. How's that?
1460330|CC|Otherwise known as - -
1460330|LMP|That's geology-ese if I ever heard it.
1460331|CC|-- the GLPBC.
1460336|LMP|Took you a while, didn't it?
1460342|CC|It's 11 o'clock down here, guys.
1460348|CDR|It's 11 o'clock up here, too, Bob. There's a square boulder - look at that one!
1460356|LMP|Yes, it's square all right - or at least one side of it is.
1460359|CDR|No, three sides of it are square. It just fractured that way - that's by accident, looking at it. So how do we get over here?
1460406|LMP|Go left, probably. And along the rim.
1460408|CDR|Yes, that's where I'm going to go. Hold on.
1460412|LMP|I'm holding. Oh man! If Charlie is smiling because my hands are tired, why did he let you give me - get the charge off? Fine backup crew we got.
1460440|CC|You guys didn't really mean to say that, did you?
1460446|LMP|106/3.2. We're approaching the rim of Victory.
1460458|LMP|And the LMP frame count is somewhere around 7 - well, 85, maybe.
1460504|CDR|That's Victory; look at it go to the left and look at it go to the right. That's Victory; we're right on the ridge.
1460508|LMP|Yes. Yes.
1460509|CC|Okay; and we're picking - -
1460510|CDR|We're at 106, 3. - -
1460510|CC|- - on a Rover ..., you guys - Copy that.
1460515|CDR|1 - 106, 3.2.
1460519|LMP|Okay, let's see.
1460521|CDR|Tell me where you want that thing and we'll get a pan around it.
1460523|LMP|Okay, let's - I tell you what - you see right ahead of you -
1460525|CDR|Yes.
1460525|LMP|There's - it's - looks like a place you could spin a profile on.
1460530|CDR|Yes, I could do it - right up in here.
1460532|LMP|And deploy the charge. Tell me where you're going.
1460536|CDR|I'm going, right here; you could put it in that hole. No, you don't want to do that.
1460540|LMP|That's all right.
1460541|CDR|Just pick a spot and take your photos.
1460543|LMP|Okay, I've got them. Now, go just beyond there. Little bit more. That's good.
1460552|CDR|Okay. Okay, Bob, we're at 106, 3.2.
1460557|CC|Copy that.
1460603|LMP|Okay, pulling pin 1 is pulled and safe. Pin 2 is pulled and safe. Pin - Boy, these are stiff this time around. Push it in - try again.
1460624|CDR|That's a - that's a big black box. Don't pull it too hard.
1460629|LMP|(Grunting)
1460632|LMP|Stand by on pin 3, gang.
1460634|CC|Copying that. Remember to push it all the way back in, Jack, and start from scratch.
1460639|LMP|I did - I did - I did. I remembered - I remembered.
1460642|CC|Good, good, good.
1460645|LMP|But now I can't get to the -
1460653|CDR|Your hands are tired. Let me try it once.
1460655|LMP|No, it's - it's not that. It's just - it's coming. Got it.
1460700|LMP|Pin 3 is out and safe.
1460702|CC|Copy that.
1460707|LMP|And look at the orange flag. Zowie!
1460711|CC|That's what you guys were sampling at Station 4, I bet.
1460717|CDR|Huh? Yes - it's about that orange, only a little - not quite as bright. Same - same shade. Okay. Okay, let me turn my switch on. Hey, Bob - -
1460726|PAO|The crew's about 12 minutes behind the EVA timeline.
1460729|LMP|Wait a minute, wait a minute. Let me get that out a little more.
1460731|CDR|Bob, there's no question but what that we're at Victory.
1460736|CC|Say again there, 17.
1460737|CDR|It's the first crater that looked like I thought it would.
1460740|CC|Okay.
1460742|CDR|Okay. You ready?
1460745|LMP|Let me change my setting here.
1460748|CDR|Okay. Okay.
1460750|LMP|Good.
1460751|CDR|Okay, let's get a nice Rover pan here.
1460755|LMP|Okay, turn the other way first.
1460757|CDR|Yes.
1460801|LMP|Take her slow.
1460802|CC|And we'll get a Rover sample here before you guys leave, too, after the circular pan.
1460809|LMP|We will.
1460813|CDR|Low enough?
1460814|LMP|Yes.
1460820|LMP|Look at the light mantle over there.
1460823|CDR|You can sure see it now, can't you now?
1460824|LMP|Yes.
1460839|CDR|Getting your - your setting changed fast enough?
1460841|LMP|I got it; yes.
1460847|CDR|Okay. Okay, let's get our Rover sample.
1460850|LMP|Okay.
1460900|CDR|And the Rover sample will be from the same locality. Boy, it's just a couple of meters from the charge, isn't it?
1460911|LMP|Yes. I hope I didn't put too much soil in there for you. Wait a minute.
1460919|CDR|Okay.
1460922|LMP|Rover sample works just as advertised.
1460925|CC|Copy that.
1460926|LMP|Not bad. That - bag 43 Yankee.
1460933|CC|Copy; 43 Yankee. And how about a frame count after - right now, Gene - Jack.
1460939|LMP|I will. Stand by. You're jumping the gun occasionally but not very often. 106.
1460952|CC|Copy - -
1460952|CDR|..., Jack. Okay?
1460953|CC|- - 106.
1460956|LMP|Okay. I guess we're ready to leave here, huh?
1460958|CDR|Well, if they don't want us to stop here, I guess we leave.
1461001|CC|Roger. We're ready for you guys to leave there - -
1461002|LMP|So, there's nothing else here now.
1461003|CC|- - and we're pressing on toward Station 5.
1461006|CDR|Okay -
1461008|LMP|Gene?
1461010|CDR|Okay, and I want to go about 120.
1461012|LMP|Gene.
1461012|CDR|Yes?
1461012|LMP|Gene, when you - can you swing out there and give me one look down east - or north into Victory?
1461018|CDR|Yes, I can do that, we can - I've got to go by that way anyway.
1461022|LMP|North. Well, you know, just swing and point north so I can look in there.
1461026|CDR|Yes.
1461027|LMP|I never got a good look at it. Well, it's a - it's a series of three craters. There's some boulders on the - on the Talus slope of the easternmost - eastern slope of the west - eastern slope of the southernmost crater, the one we're closest to.
1461048|CDR|Now how does that look to you?
1461052|LMP|Well, it looks like - and see, there's the other - I don't know what it looks like. The northwest end of the V has a white block - white blocks on it - boulders - on the inner wall and right at the rim. And the northeast end of the V looks like it has somewhat darker rocks.
1461114|CDR|Yes.
1461115|LMP|Part of that is shadowed, but I think they are darker. And they look like about the same as down here near the tip of the V on this - -
1461123|CDR|Got to be careful on that one, because there's one sloping away and one sloping towards us.
1461126|LMP|Yes, I know. I've qualified it.
1461129|CDR|Okay; we are rolling, by the way. And we're at 106 and - Well, we're still 3.1.
1461137|CC|Yes. Copy that. Thank you.
1461142|LMP|In the rim itself though, Victory is - is not blocky. There a little - there is an - some increase in fragment size, but that seems to be the result of some craters in the rim that have gotten below the debris that's covering it. I'd say that Victory's somewhat like Horatio in that it has blocky inner walls but essentially a normal block population on the rim.
1461210|CC|Okay. And we've got a Rover sample going toward Station 5 at about 103 and 2.5.
1461222|LMP|Okay. 103 and 2.5.
1461225|CC|Roger. And that'll be just a grid sample.
1461233|LMP|They're - none of them just grid samples, Bob (laughter).
1461242|CDR|You see, you can't tell how deep they are until you get up to them.
1461244|LMP|Yes.
1461244|CDR|That one I could have gone through.
1461245|LMP|Yes. Okay; Station 5 is Camelot. Good old Camelot. (Humming)
1461324|CDR|Look at the size of that one. That's another one of those -
1461326|LMP|Yes.
1461327|CDR|... - there's another one on the right. Lookit.
1461329|LMP|Some of them have -
1461331|CDR|Well, that one doesn't have any fragments in the bottom of it.
1461333|LMP|No.
1461334|CDR|It looks like someone walked across it.
1461335|LMP|Yes.
1461335|CDR|I think that there's quite a variability in the thickness of the dark mantle in here. Did you - I for - I didn't notice us crossing the - that one tongue of light mantle.
1461345|CDR|No, I didn't either.
1461346|LMP|I - we obviously did - -
1461348|CDR|I think we did.
1461349|LMP|Right at Victory, but it didn't show up.
1461350|CDR|Looking into the Sun, you can't tell any difference anyway. However, I tell you, I certainly get the impression there is a mantle. I would say that -
1461404|LMP|Oh, I think so. I don't know what it is, but the dark mantle exists. They're just - the craters - these craters are just too big not to have thrown up blocks. And they're either subdued by the mantle or they haven't penetrated it.
1461431|CDR|And a lot of - and these blocks - -
1461431|LMP|And I think you probably have both. Excuse me, Gene.
1461435|CDR|And I - I'd say they've been subdued by the mantle. That - that really imposes an impression on me.
1461440|LMP|Yes. There are those that appear that way, like Horatio, for example, or the big ones. But others, I think, are too young. They just don't penetrate. Particularly those that are big and have bright halos.
1461450|CDR|Well, now - yes, but the only ones that look fresh and not enough to penetrate are these little cnes with the glass in them.
1461455|LMP|Well, there's been some big - big fresh ones. We'll - we'll look for one.
1461459|CDR|Now there's one with glass in it, probably.
1461502|LMP|Yes. I think that one - that's one - -
1461503|CDR|And without any blocks on it. That - that may not have penetrated.
1461505|LMP|Yes. Yes, that just has the - mostly the shock-indurated rock - ... rock.
1461512|CDR|We're coming up to 103 at 2.6 now, so we need a sample up here.
1461519|LMP|Okay.
1461520|CDR|Okay. 103, 2.5, anywhere.
1461523|CC|Roger. That's affirm.
1461524|CDR|Okay, let me - good. Let me slowly go to the right here.
1461528|LMP|Okay. Right out in that little inner-crater area, right out in there is good. If you let me guide you a little, I might get a rock sample. Whoa, whoa, whoa - well, that wasn't quite enough.
1461540|CDR|Okay. Pick a point.
1461543|LMP|Move - move ahead about - yes, right. Just - no, that's good. Straight ahead. Straight ahead. Good, good, good, good, good, good, whoa! Now we'll give it a try.
1461554|CDR|Okay, 103, 2.5.
1461558|CC|Copy that.
1461559|CDR|And that battery is still at about 132.
1461601|CC|Okay. Copy that. We're allowed to go to 140, tonight.
1461610|CDR|I don't expect we'll make it. I think we'll get done before that. Save that for tomorrow. I'll tell you those batteries deserve any temperature they want today, after going - going up that - -
1461622|LMP|That's - that's the soil.
1461625|CDR|- - that Scarp.
1461626|LMP|Okay. The soil is in 44 Yankee.
1461630|CC|Copy; 44 Yankee.
1461644|LMP|That block's too big. I can't get it. Too big. Okay.
1461649|CDR|Get your picture?
1461651|LMP|No. Okay, got mine.
1461701|CDR|Okay. What's the - well, we'll find Camelot.
1461703|LMP|And the - 125's the LMP frame count.
1461708|CC|Copy that. And just press on the same heading you've been carrying there, Gene, and that will get you to Camelot.
1461717|CDR|We want the southwestern edge, huh?
1461720|LMP|Do you want to go where Station 5 is, Bob?
1461723|CC|That's my understanding, Jack. So press on towards there unless I tell you otherwise.
1461729|LMP|Well, but you were talking about changing Station 5. I think Station 5 is a pretty good spot.
1461735|CC|Roger. And I think that's where we want to go - I'm just trying to verify that. You can go in that direction, though. I'll get with you if it's not.
1461743|LMP|Okay. It's probably the most concentrated boulder field on Camelot.
1461749|CC|Okay. You know where it is, and we think it's about 092 and 1.6.
1461757|CDR|092 and 1.6. You know this country - -
1461759|CC|Roger. But you know where it is, so you'll find it when you get there.
1461802|CDR|- - is rug - is undu - it's different.
1461810|LMP|Wonder where Horatio is?
1461813|CDR|Well, we're going to run into something in a minute if it's - it's probably right over that rim on the right, Jack. Right off your right hand at 2 o'clock.
1461821|LMP|Right. I guess so.
1461823|CDR|You know, it doesn't have boulders on it. It should be over there. That should be it right over that rim. You know, I see why Al and Ed had trouble walking up Cone Crater. You - you could stand right on the edge of the rim of a crater and not know it's there.
1461836|LMP|Yes.
1461847|CDR|Man, that was spectacular. It's color on the Moon!
1461850|LMP|Whooo!
1461851|CDR|It was really orange! Can you see that color on the television?
1461857|LMP|No answer.
1461900|CDR|I'll bet they couldn't.
1461903|CC|No, we couldn't see it, Gene. ... guys - -
1461905|CDR|Look at the - look at the Sculptured Hills. Okay. I'm sure glad I went up to take that second pan to see that stuff go radially down into the center of the crater at that contact.
1461915|LMP|Yes, that's good.
1461917|CDR|Hope that comes out.
1461919|LMP|Doesn't make any difference, it's there - comes out or not. Okay. Sculptured - -
1461927|CDR|Okay. Look at - look at up - up the cleft over there. You can see definite change in albedo now between the North Massif and the Sculptured Hills. Lookit, right at - right up the - the valley. Well, you can't see it - let me -
1461938|LMP|(Laughing) You're right.
1461939|CDR|You got - you got to see this. See that?
1461946|LMP|Yes. There - but, again, that may be your photometrous effects.
1461949|CDR|Yes, one's an upslope and one's a downslope.
1461951|LMP|Yes. Yes. Just about right, but it's supposed to be darker in the - in the cleft you know.
1462004|LMP|Well, I guess ... I've been on - LMP's back to MINIMUM.
1462011|CC|Roger. Thank you.
1462016|CDR|Oh, whoop, whoop, whoop! I wish I had a movie picture of us driving.
1462024|LMP|You're doing it - you're doing the driving.
1462027|CDR|That would be the classic - -
1462028|CC|Who you plan on taking it?
1462030|CDR|- - of the century. You're doing - Well, there must be somebody out there.
1462038|LMP|Bob, the fragment population - We're at 099, 2.0 - is still about the 1-percent category of - And it's hard to tell, going into the Sun, what kind of blocks you're dealing with. But - my - my guess is most - well, more than a guess - most of them look like they're slightly vesicular. And, in that regard, resemble the gabbros.
1462118|CC|Okay, copy that.
1462119|LMP|Many - there are - now there is some that - there's a class of boulders that is flat topped and fairly well rounded that is just about completely buried. Only the - the - oh, not more than 5 centimeters of it projects above the surface. We've seen those off and on, both days. Remember, Geno?
1462143|CDR|Yes.
1462144|LMP|And they seem to be quite distinct. At least you notice them. Now, whether it's just a continuation of the mantling, I don't know. But - the - most other boulders - the big ones seem to be - project above the surface more than just that 5 or 10 centimeters.
1462209|CDR|I tell you, the Sculptured Hills just have that wrinkled old-face feeling.
1462212|LMP|Yes. There are blocks over there though, aren't there?
1462217|CDR|There's blocks, but I don't see any concentrated outcrops - -
1462219|LMP|No.
1462219|CDR|- - or concentrated masses of blocks up on the slope anywhere - -
1462222|LMP|Possibly - -
1462222|CDR|- - like you did on the Massif.
1462223|LMP|Possibly due - -
1462225|CDR|Oh. Do you think that's Camelot or not?
1462227|LMP|I think that might be Camelot.
1462228|CDR|Look at that.
1462229|LMP|Nice shot.
1462231|CDR|Look at that. Right on the southeastern - -
1462234|LMP|Now, wait a minute.
1462235|CDR|- - southwestern rim.
1462236|LMP|Yes, yes.
1462237|CDR|Yes, because Horatio's got to be on our right. Well, wait a minute, doggone it.
1462240|LMP|It's not Horatio, is it?
1462242|CDR|Well, we're at 094, 1.7.
1462246|CC|Stand by.
1462252|LMP|No, I think, that's Camelot. Horatio didn't - -
1462254|CDR|That's too - that's too - -
1462254|LMP|- - have blocks that far up the rim.
1462255|CDR|- - let me - yes, let me look - look at the bottom I'll tell you. I remember.
1462259|LMP|Yes.
1462300|CC|That kind of sounds like Camelot to us.
1462302|LMP|... these blocks ...
1462303|CDR|Yes, I remember. Yes, that's it, Bob. We're coming right up at Station 5 - Right at it.
1462308|CC|Okay.
1462312|LMP|Only way to fly. Okay. You want to park up on the rim so they can have a good panorama?
1462321|CDR|Sure. I'd like to get a little on the other side of those blocks, if I can.
1462326|LMP|Yes, you better. Then they can look with the Sun on them.
1462329|CDR|Yes.
1462329|LMP|Because, otherwise, they can't see that other rim over there.
1462336|PAO|We've said goodnight to Ron Evans.
1462337|CDR|Same heading. So, I'll be all right, there. Yes. I'll get to the other side. Then they can look at these blocks and those across the way. I got to go around this block field, though.
1462351|LMP|I should hope so. ... seeing Druid.
1462402|CDR|Then you really - There's Horatio back there. I can see Horatio now. Okay?
1462407|LMP|Looks just like it did before.
1462409|CDR|So, we came right where we were supposed to.
1462412|LMP|All the blocks look very much the same in the wall of Horatio.
1462417|CDR|There's a path through -
1462418|LMP|Watch it. Watch it.
1462422|CDR|Okay. Well, that's a test.
1462425|LMP|That was a good one.
1462426|CDR|That was a good test. Didn't let any air out of that tire, did it?
1462431|LMP|No, I don't think so.
1462434|CDR|Talk about a block field!
1462438|PAO|America in its 30 revolution, coming up in the vicinity of the landing site, now.
1462440|LMP|I think my guess of 30 percent was reasonably good before. I - Where are you going to park. Right over there?
1462445|CDR|I'll park right over here, so that they can look in it.
1462447|LMP|Okay.
1462451|CDR|Okay. Yes. I got to head 045, so I head right into those blocks.
1462508|LMP|Oh, you still got to turn, remember?
1462510|CDR|Yes, that's why I want to leave myself a little room over there.
1462513|LMP|Woah.
1462514|CDR|Okay, Bob. We're stopped. 086 and 1.4.
1462520|CC|Okay.
1462526|LMP|Not very level for the gravimeter. What's their limit?
1462532|CDR|I don't know, but it's taken a couple better than this.
1462539|LMP|Hey, I got to change film.
1462543|CDR|Let me get things going here.
1462544|PAO|We're at 5 hours, 50 minutes. We want to leave Station 5 at 6 hours, 15 minutes.
1462546|LMP|I think I can get by this station without it.
1462549|CDR|How's our time, Bob?
1462550|CC|Stand by. We're talking about that now. You've got - Stand by. You've got 25 minutes at this station, guys. We've given you somewhat of an extension here. You're using up some of it back at the LM, but we've given you - I've given you somewhat of an extension. You've got 25 minutes at this station. The primary priority will be subfloor documented samples, and then subfloor rake soil. As you can imagine.
1462621|LMP|Okay.
1462621|CC|As you get off, we'd also like to open the SEP and again get back to COOL.
1462630|CDR|Okay. You wanted to turn it OFF.
1462634|CC|That's affirm - -
1462634|CDR|Turn it off.
1462635|CC|- - Turn it OFF, open, dust - -
1462636|CDR|You want it off?
1462636|CC|- - the same thing we've been doing to it all aft - all evening.
1462642|LMP|Well, it's midday here, Bob.
1462650|CDR|Leave it open and I'll dust it, Jack.
1462652|LMP|Okay. Oh, the temperature - they'd like to know.
1462659|CDR|Temperature is still about 112.
1462702|CC|Copy that.
1462704|CDR|You know, the thing I - you know the thing I dread most? About closeout?
1462710|LMP|What's that?
1462710|CDR|Is dusting you.
1462711|LMP|Yes, I'm not going to be able to do much today, I don't think.
1462714|CDR|Well, you know, we don't have nearly as much dust on - because yesterday we were wallowing around in it. Today, we're -
1462719|LMP|Who? Me!
1462721|CC|Okay, and Gene, if you're not off the Rover, how about the rest of the Rover readouts?
1462727|CDR|Okay, Bob, I'm off, but I'll get them for you. I'm sorry. I look at them, and they all look good to me. And it - you know. I keep forgetting to give them to you.
1462739|LMP|Bob, I have 135 frames. I think I can finish the station, don't you?
1462745|CC|Yes, probably.
1462806|CDR|You know that SEP isn't get much - well, it's getting a little on it, but those mirrors don't clean off as nice as the - as the LCRU mirrors.
1462826|LMP|Okay, Bob. This looks just like our old friend, the pyroxene gabbro with the shiny ilmenite platelets in the vugs and partially recrystallized vesicles. The textural variations are planar, and they're primarily - or subplanar in the concentrations of vesicles.
1462908|CDR|Jack, I'm going to put this brush under my - my seat. It's just getting too hard to get off that place up there.
1462913|LMP|Okay.
1462916|CDR|Bob, what magazine?
1462919|CC|Magazine Delta.
1462923|LMP|Wa - watch yourself through here, Geno.
1462925|CDR|Yes. Delta, huh?
1462928|CC|That's affirm.
1462930|LMP|Okay. Delta - Bravo. There's Delta. Boy, this is certainly a uni - subfloor, as we mapped it. It's certainly a uniform - uniform rock type. I'll tell you. The only variation - are those gray zones which are - just seem to be either finer or the absence of vesicles. Boy, I'm nose to nose with a piece of it right now.
1463015|CDR|Say, Bob, where can I get a new set of bags?
1463019|CC|Okay, you want - The new bags, they'll be under Jack's seat.
1463022|LMP|There's some under - Under my seat, there's some, Geno.
1463026|CDR|Okay. Just loose?
1463028|LMP|Yes.
1463035|LMP|Here I am, folks, in the middle of a boulder field. Just minding my own business. There - I don't know whether I mentioned it. The texture - mineral texture - is - appears to be subophitic to - sort of like - like a good diabase, although a little coarser. But it's unquestionably organized with that variation in vesicle concentration.
1463130|CDR|Starting on frame 4, Bob.
1463132|CC|Copy that, Gene.
1463140|CDR|Jack, I've got to get new bags. I've only got one left, and you don't have any, I don't believe.
1463144|LMP|I don't have any.
1463150|LMP|Bob, there - I have the impression that these blocks are buried up here. That the mantle does exist, even on Camelot. There are a few blocks that are lying out on the - looks like they're lying more less on the surface, but you might - you can attribute those to - to craters that have disrupted the block field.
1463221|CC|Okay; good observation, Jack.
1463222|LMP|The big ones seem to be projecting out of the - the big ones seem to be projecting out of the mantle.
1463231|CC|Okay. Do you see any such mantle on - -
1463232|LMP|Although I can't see how the mantle in here could -
1463236|CC|- - on top of them?
1463238|LMP|It's not as - No, I don't. What's there seems to be what could have been knocked up there.
1463247|CC|Okay. Understand.
1463249|LMP|I see a place where - I see a place where I think we can skim some off the top of a rock, which I think we probably ought to do.
1463257|CC|Okay.
1463257|LMP|But it - I don't have the impression of draping, so much as I have just of burial. And I have a feeling that the zap-pitting process just has cleaned these boulders off, of anything that may have been on top of them, in excess of what's around them, right now.
1463321|CC|Okay, you're talking about - -
1463321|LMP|Also, like Horatio, the - Go ahead.
1463327|CC|You're talking about mantle - blocks - then mantle - and then cleaned off by zap pits, in other words.
1463335|LMP|That's right. Most of the rocks seem - that seems to be what has happened all over the Moon that we've looked at. But the rocks are always cleaner than the - than the surface, of course. The - the far rim of Camelot - you can see - fact is, everywhere but where we are and on the rim near the LM -the - there seems - the rim seems to be completely covered or, at least, the blocks don't show through. They show up in the wall but not at the rim. That's much like Horatio, but not to the extreme that we saw at Horatio. I'd say, at Camelot, the mantle is - oh, maybe - at the most - the rim thickness, if that's mantle, is on the order of a half of what we saw at Horatio.
1463433|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1463434|LMP|The pan should let you measure that - Well, we didn't get a pan at Horatio, but we got some Rover shots of it. But you may be able to come - quantify that a little bit.
1463445|CC|Okay.
1463452|LMP|How coming, Geno?
1463453|CDR|Oh, I've got new bags. I've got new mags. I've got everything cleaned up and -
1463457|CDR|MARK, gravimeter.
1463459|CC|Copy. Mark that.
1463500|LMP|Here's a - here's a nicely structured rock that we probably ought to work on here. Structured again in the vesicle concentrations. And then I think we ought to try to get - right over there, we can get mantle.
1463518|CDR|Hey, I'll tell you what impresses me about some of these rocks. There's a lot of - they may be zap pits - I guess you looked at them closer than I did, but there sure is a lot of - lot of lineation in some of that white - white material, Jack.
1463530|LMP|But at what scale?
1463532|CDR|Well, on a - on a - on a - on a visual-obvious scale.
1463537|LMP|Well, I mean the - Okay.
1463540|CDR|I'll show you. If you don't - Let me see if it's up here.
1463546|LMP|The crystal grains are - seem to be linear, but they are more or less random. is that what you mean?
1463553|CDR|No, they're linear, though. I can't - -
1463555|LMP|Yes.
1463556|CDR|- - can't be really linear and random. There's some rocks here that are - -
1463558|LMP|No, I mean - -
1463559|CDR|- - that are highly vesicular and there's others that are not.
1463601|LMP|That's right.
1463602|CC|Okay, and a reminder, 17 - -
1463604|LMP|Gene, if this is what you mean, it's - -
1463605|CC|- - you guys, that the primary priority is the blocks and then a rake soil of the - of the white subfloor soil there. And you've only got 15 minutes before we want you driving back to the LM. Over.
1463619|LMP|Okay. We'll get to work.
1463622|CDR|Okay - -
1463623|LMP|Let's sample this.
1463624|CDR|Okay.
1463625|LMP|Let me get these two first and then we'll go get that one, because there's two different kinds here - at least apparent kinds.
1463629|CDR|Okay.
1463630|LMP|One's a relatively new fracture.
1463632|CDR|Well.
1463632|LMP|Boy, I tell you, watch when you back up. ... you already - -
1463634|CDR|... told you.
1463635|LMP|- - learned that.
1463640|CDR|I've already cycled film.
1463641|LMP|We need to sample the structures, though, in this thing. We haven't really done that.
1463645|CDR|We'll try and get a around-the-corner - -
1463648|LMP|And we've got to get - -
1463649|CDR|- - picture.
1463649|LMP|We need to get that stuff on the mantle, too. I mean on the blocks.
1463656|CDR|Yes. Okay, we want to get an around-the-corner picture of one of those big ones, too. See if we can get the structure of it. Okay, you get your picture?
1463703|LMP|Yes.
1463717|CDR|Here's a piece right here.
1463719|LMP|Okay, can you hand me a bag, or I'll pick it up with a scoop, whichever you prefer.
1463727|CDR|Get the bag? Let's see if we can fix your bag thing tonight.
1463740|LMP|Okay, I got it. Okay, that looks like our - our old friend, the gabbro, all right.
1463759|CDR|That for a piece.
1463800|LMP|462 is Gene's fairly freshly fractured rock. Okay, you can put it in the bag.
1463817|LMP|Okay.
1463817|CDR|Okay, here's another one right here. That one.
1463821|LMP|Yes.
1463823|CDR|I can't squeeze these things anymore. Here you go. Got a bag?
1463827|LMP|Not yet.
1463830|CDR|Okay. You in there?
1463850|LMP|Okay, 463 is another of the same variety. Wish we'd started on that structured rock because we're going to run out of time. Let's go over there and get at least one off of it.
1463910|CDR|Yes, we'll get it.
1463910|LMP|Get the after. Whoops - Got it?
1463923|CDR|Got it.
1463945|LMP|Okay, why don't we -
1463948|CDR|What did you have picked out?
1463949|LMP|This - this - this in here with the layering in it.
1463954|CC|Okay, guys - -
1463955|LMP|I'll get a - -
1463955|CC|- - looks like you'll be going in about 10 minutes.
1463957|LMP|- - a flight line photo. Yes.
1464006|LMP|Why don't you get a flight line -
1464008|CDR|I'm going to get that from here.
1464010|LMP|Sort of northeast. How you going to go?
1464013|CDR|I'll come around from this end and go around to that side.
1464015|LMP|Okay, I'll go perpendicular to you more or less.
1464051|LMP|Boy, that one right behind you is just vesicular, by comparison, to a high degree - like three times as much.
1464101|CDR|Oh, I hope those bags weren't in the way of every one of those pictures. Okay. Boy, I tell you there ought to be a lot of permanent shaded samples in here, Jack.
1464124|LMP|Okay, I got the down-Sun. Man! That's a hard Moon.
1464137|CDR|Just a little piece but that's - see -
1464140|LMP|How about this chunk down there, Gene?
1464142|CDR|Where you looking?
1464143|LMP|That'd -
1464144|CDR|I don't think that'll - that plate - piece?
1464146|LMP|Yes.
1464146|CDR|I don't think that'll come off very easy.
1464149|LMP|Let's see here.
1464149|CDR|I'll try - here try it - you're over there. You know I've worn the RTV off that hammer already.
1464156|LMP|Yes, I saw that.
1464159|CC|Roger, 17. Copy that.
1464200|CDR|There you go, beautiful call. Beautiful call. Beautiful call.
1464207|LMP|That's why - -
1464208|CDR|I wore the RTV - -
1464209|LMP|That comes from 15 years as a trained - trained hammer bearer.
1464215|CDR|By golly, your geology training did come in handy. You learned where to hit rocks.
1464218|CDR|Bob, 3 - well - 464. It won't all to in there, but -
1464234|LMP|That's all right, you can wrap it around it.
1464239|CDR|I get it - no, I get it, babe. It's in there.
1464242|LMP|Okay.
1464248|CC|Okay - -
1464249|CDR|Okay, let's - -
1464250|CC|- - Jack, and now - -
1464252|CDR|Bob, what do you - can we - -
1464252|CC|- - if you could get that rake soil and maybe also get the soil off the top of one of those boulders that you thought you saw.
1464301|LMP|Yes. Whew. I've got to have Gene with me since my - can't carry sample bag, you know.
1464309|CC|Roger.
1464309|LMP|I probably can if I'm careful; but I keep dropping them.
1464312|CDR|These rocks here have an awful lot - a much greater density of the white - white minerals in them, or crystals, than I've ever seen before, Jack. Where did we see these kind before?
1464324|LMP|Well, you know, when I looked at them right at first, that's what I thought - but I think that the zap pits are making the white stand out more. They're fooling you a little bit.
1464333|CDR|They might.
1464334|LMP|Because when I looked it with the hand lens, it looked like a fairly normal gabbro - like some of those that have crystallized with the mare basalt.
1464341|CDR|Where are you? You ready to take them -
1464343|LMP|I'm back over here. What I want is a sample of this soil off one of these rocks.
1464347|CDR|Okay, let's get that now and then let's get the rake sample.
1464352|LMP|But it looks to me like it's soil that's been thrown up there rather than - This rock is about 3 meters in diameter and it - but it's one of the flat surfaced rocks. It only stands about - at the most - one-third of a meter high.
1464419|CC|Copy that.
1464426|LMP|But we can get up about a meter from the - the soil/rock interface and get soil off the rock, I think.
1464444|CDR|Okay. See what you can do.
1464449|LMP|Whoops, oh, yes; I got some soil.
1464452|CDR|Don't kick up anything new.
1464453|LMP|No, that's all right.
1464454|CDR|455 is that bag number, Bob.
1464456|CC|Copy that.
1464457|LMP|Okay, this is soil from a half a meter in. It's about a centimeter deep and a half a meter in.
1464517|CDR|Let's take that chip there that's lying on top with the next scoop.
1464520|LMP|No, I'm going to - -
1464521|CDR|Let's take the soil on that. No. I was taking - No. Okay, take that one then. Well, that's another bag. Put this - before you pick that one up, pick that little chip up -
1464528|LMP|Well - I don't - I don't want to get the chips. I want the soil. Either that or a coherent rock.
1464533|CDR|Okay, there you go.
1464534|LMP|I think we better leave it at that.
1464539|CDR|Okay, 465. Pick that other one up and I'll bag it real quick.
1464541|CC|Copy that.
1464546|CDR|That's the soil from on top the rock. And we're taking a piece of the rock itself, which looks pretty much like the other one, Bob. It might be a little bit more vesicular.
1464556|CC|Okay, and that'll be in 466, right?
1464602|CDR|You're right again. Here we are and I'll be able to grab it with my hand. Put this away.
1464613|LMP|Okay.
1464619|LMP|Okay, the soil came from a half a meter in from the soil boundary. We need to get a - let me get over here and try to get a - one bag of soil that's away from the boulder. I'm going to get my after while I'm here.
1464635|CC|Okay, 17 - -
1464637|LMP|Could you - could you - -
1464637|CC|Roger. And the present time, we drop the rake soil, we'd just like to get the kilogram of soil somewhere between the boulders - as open as you can.
1464648|CDR|My scoop in that?
1464650|LMP|It will be. ... Okay, it is now.
1464657|CDR|Oh, you want a kilogram?
1464659|CC|Roger.
1464700|CDR|From between the boulders?
1464706|CC|Roger. That'll replace the rake soil sample we were going to get. And we'd like you moving in 3 minutes.
1464708|CDR|Okay.
1464710|LMP|Let's do it right here.
1464712|CDR|Yes, right there. Let me -
1464713|LMP|Oh, okay.
1464718|CDR|This'll go - this will be a matched pair with our soil sample, too.
1464725|CC|Roger.
1464727|CDR|Okay, bag 467 is where your kilogram is coming from.
1464731|CC|Roger.
1464745|CDR|Another scoopful.
1464746|LMP|Yes.
1464747|CDR|That's - I'm sampling down to about 5 centimeters.
1464751|CC|Copy.
1464758|LMP|Get your hand down, please. I'm coming down to you.
1464802|CDR|Oh, okay.
1464808|LMP|Okay.
1464808|CDR|That's full. That's 467.
1464813|LMP|Pinch her down tighter or that will leak out.
1464824|CDR|Now let me get your big bag tight. Okay, let me try to get a - Jack, you got a shot of where my scoop was, didn't you?
1464835|LMP|Yes. Let me get an after of it, though.
1464837|CDR|Okay.
1464839|LMP|Okay, Houston, we sampled about 3 meters southwest of the gnomon that was set up for the top of boulder soil sample. So it's a match pair, really, in that regard.
1464900|CDR|Don't forget your gnomon.
1464902|LMP|I'm not.
1464903|LMP|Now I need to get a pan - are you in a pan?
1464905|CDR|I'm - I've already started it.
1464906|LMP|Okay, I'll go over near the Rover and get one.
1465000|LMP|Okay, I got the gnomon.
1465002|CDR|When do you want us to leave, Bob?
1465018|CDR|Jack, do you read me?
1465019|LMP|Yes.
1465021|CDR|Hello, Houston.
1465022|CC|Hello, 17. Loud and clear. We'd like you to leave immediately, if not sooner.
1465038|CDR|Hippity-hoppity, hippity-hoppity, hippity-hopping over hill and dale. (Singing) Hippity-hopping along. Okay, by golly, this time goes fast.
1465109|CC|That's affirm. Okay, and when you leave here - -
1465111|CDR|Where did it go?
1465112|CC|- - 17, remember that we want to pick up - -
1465114|CDR|I'm giving you readings.
1465114|CC|- - EP number 8. Roger. We're ready.
1465119|LMP|Go.
1465119|CDR|06 - 070, 031, and 401. 670, 031, and, 401.
1465129|CC|Copy that. And when we leave we want to take EP number 8 with us, guys. We'd like the SEP turned back ON and the blankets closed. Okay, Jack, I guess that's your option, you may - -
1465146|LMP|Let me ...
1465147|CC|- - stop and take the charge off when you get to the distance or, if it's only a short one, you might like carrying it in your lap.
1465154|CDR|Jack, I can hold it in my left arm on the seat.
1465156|LMP|No, I'll get it. I'll get it.
1465158|CDR|Okay, you want the SEP ON?
1465159|CC|That's affirm.
1465203|LMP|Okay, both DSEA and the other switch.
1465209|PAO|Explosive package number 8 is a quarter pound charge.
1465210|CDR|You want the blankets open?
1465211|CC|No, closed.
1465214|CDR|Closed. Well, closed is - What happened to the Velcro on that other side? I thought they mounted that thing, so that - -
1465224|LMP|It came off, Gene. It stuck to the Velcro.
1465226|CDR|That thing they ... it. Okay, you got the TG. We'll get EP-8. The camera's gone.
1465237|LMP|We made a mistake earlier and it's too late to rectify it in carrying these charges.
1465243|CDR|Oh, I don't know - -
1465244|CC|Negative, Jack.
1465245|LMP|We did. I wouldn't want - -
1465246|CC|If you don't have it off, we could stop and get off and get it, if you want to? Bur this is a short distance. You might want to carry this one.
1465258|LMP|That's right, that's right. I say the mistake was made earlier. There's no problem now.
1465302|CDR|Okay, traverse to LM, low gain 100.
1465305|LMP|Did you turn this on?
1465306|CDR|It's all on, all squared away.
1465307|LMP|Okay.
1465308|CDR|Push that thing down and it'll stay. ... Well, sometimes it will. Okay.
1465315|CC|And how about a frame callout before you get back on, guys.
1465318|CDR|Got it.
1465322|LMP|Yes, I need some new - Do you want me to get it here?
1465331|CDR|CDR's at 50.
1465333|CC|Copy that.
1465334|LMP|170.
1465336|CC|Copy 170.
1465337|LMP|LMP's 170.
1465338|CC|And, Jack, it'd be my opinion, since you're just going back over the same path, that you came up this morning, it's probably not necessary.
1465349|LMP|Okay, I'll use it until it runs out.
1465350|CC|Okay.
1465351|CDR|I am out of film anyway.
1465352|LMP|But when you leave me at - Okay.
1465356|CC|Yes, We'll let - We'll let Gene take some of the photos near the bomb, on near charge, ...
1465406|CDR|Just jump up again and get your bottom - there you go. You got to come this way quite a bit.
1465413|LMP|Yes. Up this slope.
1465417|CDR|This seat is rising with you, for some reason. There it is, I guess. You're all right.
1465435|CDR|Up closer to you.
1465442|LMP|Okay.
1465444|CDR|Okay.
1465445|LMP|Let's go.
1465516|CDR|Okay, the switch is coming ON.
1465526|CDR|Okay, traverse to LM: 12 minutes, 085/1.4. That's - Man, that says 086/1.4 to the LM, and my checklist 085/1.4. We must have landed where they wanted us to.
1465541|LMP|Just about.
1465543|CDR|Hey, Bob.
1465544|CC|Roger.
1465544|CDR|You know where we landed yet?
1465547|CC|Well, we think so. We've been transsecting ... positions tonight.
1465551|CDR|It must be - -
1465557|LMP|It must be pretty close.
1465559|CDR|You bet your life. I'm reading 085/1.4, and that's what my checklist says.
1465604|CC|Roger.
1465612|LMP|Okay, Bob, I guess my impression and it's purely pure interpretation right at this stage - that Camelot is mantled by whatever has formed the dark mantle.
1465627|CC|Copy that.
1465632|LMP|It does not seem to be mantled to the degree that Horatio is.
1465636|CC|Okay, copy that, too.
1465652|CC|And give us a mark when you're going.
1465656|CDR|Oh, I'm sorry, Bob - -
1465658|CC|And we don't have - -
1465659|CDR|And we've been going about - a minute.
1465700|CC|Okay, copy that. And we don't have battery temperatures there, if you could quickly give them to us.
1465708|CDR|Okay, I never did give you that. It's 110 and 136.
1465714|CC|Copy that, good enough. Thank you.
1465719|CDR|Never did get that for you.
1465722|CC|That's okay.
1465723|LMP|But I tell you, the inner wall of Camelot is - the inner wall of Camelot to the east is certainly blocky.
1465733|CC|Well, there were a few blocks where you guys were, too.
1465735|CDR|... mantle, too, Jack. Yes, well, I don't know, you could see the other wall, too. It's - Hey, here's some Rover tracks.
1465746|LMP|Hey, somebody's been here before.
1465751|CC|Okay, and, 17, what we're looking for is deploying charge number 082 and 0.4 on the range.
1465806|LMP|Okay.
1465807|CDR|Okay, we're at 083 and 1.1. We're just about abeam the eastern rim of Camelot. And there's Challenger.
1465819|LMP|Hey, hello, Challenger. You can even see the ALSEP.
1465826|CDR|I think I'll go this way. (Laughter)
1465840|LMP|Gee, it seems like a short day. (Laughter)
1465844|CDR|Well, I'll tell you, the time went fast.
1465848|LMP|Okay, you've heard about this country. Hey, looking over there, though, there's no - we're about - oh, 50 meters from boulders at - in Camelot. And their appearance from this distance is the same as what we sampled at 5. I think we've pretty well identified the subfloor, Bob.
1465910|CC|Okay, sounds like we have and sounds like even from the very deepest - even from the bottom of Camelot - it looks like it's about the same.
1465920|LMP|It sure does. I can't say I understand it. But that's the way it appears right now.
1465929|CC|You can't say what, Jack? Okay, understand that.
1465934|LMP|I can't say that I understand.
1465938|CC|Copy.
1465939|LMP|Whatever filled this valley - it certainly was different than the Massif. I think we've proved that. And it, presumably, at least everything I see indicates that it was an igneous extrusion of some kind. Either that, or we're - the whole valley's been tilted and we're looking at a - some strange cross section, planar more or less - relative to the other mountains, of a crystalline body that was formed at depth. But I don't think that's likely.
1470020|CC|Okay.
1470028|CDR|Man, we've covered 19.3 kilometers, Jack.
1470031|LMP|Is that what we planned to cover?
1470032|CC|That's outstanding.
1470033|CDR|I don't know. What did we plan to cover, Bob?
1470036|CC|Stand by. But we've been everywhere we've planned to go, so, we must have gone just about as far as we've planned to go.
1470043|LMP|Yes, but it's a straight line. I don't know what the wander factor was, but I'm sure it was pretty high.
1470050|CC|17.6, they're telling me. So we went a little bit out of our way.
1470058|CDR|Well, it's all mileage.
1470100|LMP|0.7 and what was the bearing? 08 - 083?
1470105|CDR|082, I think, but we want 1.4.
1470108|CC|0.4 - 0.4, guys.
1470114|CDR|Oh, 0.4.
1470117|LMP|Yes, that's the range.
1470118|CDR|Yes, that's what I said, 0.4.
1470120|LMP|But you want - you want to bear north, don't you, a - little?
1470122|CDR|Yes, I want - what'd you say, 082, didn't you, Bob?
1470124|CC|That's affirm. That'll be close enough. It's probably be right on your tracks there.
1470128|CDR|Okay. Well, I don't make a habit of following myself. I like to cover new ground.
1470135|CC|Okay, copy that.
1470136|LMP|Watch out for that new ground there looks like in the - look at the italian flag.
1470141|CDR|Hey, there is one there. I saw the box before I saw the flag. No, I didn't, I saw the flag first, I've got to admit it.
1470150|LMP|Come on now.
1470151|CDR|I got to admit it, I saw the flag first.
1470153|LMP|The boss said you saw the flag first.
1470156|CDR|I'm 082 and I'm 0.5. I'll just head right in towards the LM. Man, I want to stay away from ALSEP, I see the big boulders, so I'll - -
1470204|LMP|Okay.
1470205|CDR|I'm going to go around - -
1470205|LMP|0.5. Okay, you'll have to swing right after we deploy, probably.
1470210|CDR|Yes. Whee.
1470225|CDR|Did we ever get any glass out of the bottom of those craters?
1470226|LMP|No, we haven't, we've got to try to do that before we leave. There haven't been any good - -
1470232|CC|Sometime you'll have time to do that, I guess, guys. I'm not sure when - -
1470240|LMP|Four.
1470241|LMP|Okay.
1470242|CDR|Okay, 08, well, she just went to 1. Okay, 081/0.4.
1470247|LMP|Okay, let's put it in that little depression there. See right ahead of us to the right?
1470252|CDR|Okay.
1470253|LMP|Can you - -
1470254|CDR|Got your pictures?
1470255|LMP|I'm getting them.
1470258|CDR|Okay.
1470259|LMP|Now just swing into that depression and I'll put it there. Beautiful.
1470307|CDR|Okay.
1470307|LMP|Whoa, Whoa.
1470310|LMP|Okay, charge number 8.
1470313|CDR|You didn't get a picture to the LM then, did you?
1470314|LMP|Yes, I did. I got several of them.
1470317|CDR|Well, we don't have to take any more, do we?
1470319|LMP|No.
1470322|LMP|Okay, antenna is deployed. Pin 1 is pulled and SAFE. And, let me check that. It's dusty. Yes, it's SAFE. Pin 2 is pulled and SAFE. Pin 3, pulled and SAFE.
1470341|CC|Copy that.
1470342|LMP|I guess as long as it didn't go off, it's safe.
1470346|CDR|Ooh, don't bang it.
1470348|LMP|(Laughter)
1470350|CDR|I don't care what they say, that's a charge.
1470356|CDR|You're having great luck with those. ... Okay.
1470402|LMP|The LM was in the - approach shot, I believe, let me -
1470407|LMP|Go ahead and turn around - -
1470408|CDR|Yes, I got to go around anyway.
1470411|LMP|This was I can get a running shot of ... - right in the middle of it - let me get you - get them both in it.
1470419|LMP|Okay, I ran out of film, too.
1470421|CDR|Oh, boy.
1470421|LMP|Now that's pretty well located.
1470423|CDR|Where is it?
1470423|LMP|When you come around, take a picture of the LM on your camera.
1470426|CDR|I will. I'll take it right out the front looking right at the thing.
1470428|LMP|Yes, and give them a frame count. At about a 56 -
1470439|CDR|Fifty-six.
1470441|CDR|Bob, I've got the locator of the charge and the LM all in the same order here, and I'm one more than what I just gave you. I can't look at it now.
1470450|CC|Okay, one more than what you gave me at Station 5, understand.
1470453|LMP|..., Bob. You want me to go to the gravimeter now.
1470500|CC|Roger. And if you guys will start out, we'll drive you by the ALSEP, Gene - Jack, and if you'll get out at the ALSEP, we'll have you take a look at the surface gravimeter and Gene can press on home to the LM.
1470519|LMP|Okay.
1470519|CDR|Jack, I'm going to drive you in this way, and then I'll drive all the way back around that one geophone.
1470524|LMP|Okay. Shall I - -
1470526|CC|While you're to the north, you could drive in toward the heat flow, towards that big rock, if you can see that.
1470533|CDR|Yes, well, okay; that's as good as anything.
1470536|CDR|Bob, you want me to get some ALSEP pictures?
1470541|CC|Negative.
1470547|CC|Okay, and Jack, you can stand by - -
1470547|LMP|Okay. I got a flag.
1470548|CC|- - for a feedwater dump very shortly. Okay, FEEDWATER, go to AUX, please.
1470552|LMP|I just got it.
1470559|CDR|Man, look at that mess of cables. I hope that thing's working, Bob.
1470604|CC|Every - Well, a lot of it's working, we've just got to try and see if we can't level this thing tonight. When you get off there, Jack, I'll talk to you a bit about procedures for that. And in the meanwhile, it's my understanding - -
1470616|LMP|Okay; that's good, Gene - -
1470617|CC|- - that the second UHT is not in the immediate vicinity, where it's accessible, is that right?
1470623|CDR|No, it is, I can get it.
1470624|CC|Okay; if you can - -
1470625|CDR|Okay, and watch my heat flow over there, don't trip over them.
1470636|LMP|Okay, I'm going to take a pair of tongs - -
1470638|CDR|Do you have any film at all?
1470640|LMP|No, I want your camera.
1470641|CDR|You want my camera?
1470652|CC|Okay, Jack, you won't need - we aren't planning on taking the ALSEP photos right now.
1470700|LMP|Okay.
1470704|CC|Okay. And, Jack, we're not sure you went to AUX on your water yet.
1470710|LMP|I thought I did.
1470713|CC|Okay, it's coming up, now, we see it coming, Jack, don't worry.
1470715|LMP|Gene, can you - Okay.
1470721|CDR|You got what you want?
1470723|LMP|Let me take the set of tongs in case I drop something.
1470725|CDR|Can you reach them?
1470726|LMP|Yes.
1470737|CDR|You got everything you need?
1470738|LMP|Yes.
1470739|CDR|Okay, Jack's got my camera and tongs, and I'm on my way.
1470744|CC|Okay, copy that.
1470746|LMP|Okay, I got a tone again, Bob. I got a tone again.
1470750|CC|Okay, what's it say? Probably just your water -... been building up - -
1470754|LMP|I can't - I can't read my gages. Want me to take - -
1470807|CDR|Well, we better take a look. Okay, I'm coming over there.
1470811|CDR|I just - I think I just got my water tone, Bob.
1470814|CC|Okay, that's right, also.
1470818|LMP|Okay, AUX water's ON. We got our tones - our tones yesterday. Can you see anything?
1470826|CDR|Well, not unless - Let me see, let me brush your - Bend over. You don't have a brush to brush off. Okay, no flags.
1470835|LMP|Hey, wait a minute.
1470837|CDR|Okay. You got no -
1470838|LMP|Huh?
1470838|CDR|You got no flags.
1470840|LMP|Okay.
1470840|CC|You look good to us, Jack.
1470841|CDR|Once more - a good look.
1470842|CC|Jack, you look good to us.
1470844|CDR|No flags. All right, no flags, Jack.
1470847|CC|Okay, and, Gene, I think you need to GO AUX - -
1470849|CDR|Okay.
1470850|CC|- - if you didn't.
1470853|CDR|Yes, I just did, Bob, and my water flag cleared.
1470857|CC|Okay, copy that - -
1470857|CDR|No, it didn't - not yet.
1470859|CC|Yes, it's probably still coming up.
1470900|CDR|Okay, Jack, just be careful of the cables.
1470908|LMP|Okay, you want me to get a UHT, huh?
1470910|CDR|It's right over there by the - -
1470911|LMP|Yes, I know where it is - -
1470913|CC|If it's quite close, but if it's not, don't bother, I think we can probably try this by hand.
1470920|CDR|No, it's there, Bob; he'll get it.
1470921|CC|Okay.
1470926|CDR|You got a heading for me at the Rover, is 017 good?
1470932|CC|018 - 018.
1470936|CDR|Okay.
1470937|LMP|You don't want me to kick the LEAM yet, huh?
1470941|CC|Negative.
1470954|LMP|Okay, Bob, I've got a UHT.
1470957|CC|Okay, when you go back to the LSG, Jack, we first of all would like a reading of where the bubble is in the circle, whether it's in the center. And what we're going to have to have, unfortunately, is to have the bubble centered in the inner circle because the - this is, apparently, a requirement, even though we didn't train to it, apparently it's something that came up, and it's going to have to be within the inner circle of the bubble. The first thing we need to do is, when you go up there, is to see whether the bubble is in the center of the circle.
1471039|LMP|Okay, Bob. That bubble is centered.
1471047|CC|Okay. Okay, the next thing we want you to do is put the UHT in the socket there, and move the - -
1471053|LMP|Hey, Bob.
1471053|CC|- - LSG from side to side - -
1471054|LMP|Bob - -
1471055|CC|- - do not pick it up. Okay, go ahead, Jack.
1471100|LMP|I did not have to touch it, it is centered.
1471102|CC|Okay, but now they're worried that it's stuck like your gimbal thing was last night and, also, the thing is that maybe - we maybe - something's hung up inside, and by moving it we can jostle it free. They do not want it picked up, but they'd like to have UHT put in there and sort of have the instrument rocked from side to side to again see the bubble moves. And once that is done, to then press it down into the ground and again realign it and put the bubble within the inner circle. Over. They would also like to see if the gimbal is free.
1471133|LMP|How much do you want me to - how much do you want me to rock it? How far should I let the bubble travel?
1471143|CC|Basically, we just want to see it move. You - you go up to the outer circle, that's - that's plenty. And again, you ...
1471156|LMP|There's only one circle. Okay.
1471158|CC|Oh, I mean the outer rim, the - the rim of it.
1471204|LMP|Okay, I did that. It's still centered and gimbal is swinging.
1471209|CC|Okay, we copy the gimbal is swinging and we copy you moved the bubble out to the edge of the bubble level and come back into the inner circle.
1471218|LMP|That's right.
1471223|CDR|Okay, Bob, I'm reading 089, 20.1, 002, 92, 88. Volts are 65 and 66. Batteries are 1 - 14 and 138. Rear motors are off scale low. Forward left is off scale low and right is 210 degrees.
1471256|CC|Copy that. What's the first battery temperature there, Gene?
1471301|CDR|First battery temperature is 114.
1471305|CC|Okay, Jack. They apparently don't believe you when you said you aligned it last night and they're concerned the shade is not on 20 degrees. Copy 114 on that battery temperature, Gene.
1471314|LMP|It is on - it's on 20, Bob.
1471318|CC|Okay. Okay. In that case, I guess you're free to come home.
1471326|LMP|Well, what is basically the problem with it?
1471329|CC|They haven't been able to level it for some reason, and they were afraid that the thing wasn't leveled. They were hoping also maybe by moving it that you might jostle it a bit and it would come to level, but I think we'll just have to think about it some more. The first presumption - the easiest solution was to have it unlevel, which case we could fix it this way. But I guess that's not the case. We'll have to see what happens overnight. Give us a chance to follow the tradition of coming back to the ALSEP tomorrow.
1471358|LMP|Well, do you want me to change it's posi - it's level a little bit - put it off level a little and see if you can work it.
1471405|CC|I don't think so, Jack. That doesn't sound very good to me - -
1471411|LMP|Well, it might be air in the level bubble or something.
1471411|CC|Why don't you just leave it there if it's centered with the level bubble within the inner - within the inner circle there. That's the requirements as far as we can tell, and we'll just have to leave it overnight again. And why don't you come on back to the LM.
1471441|CC|Okay, Gene, are you at the Rover?
1471444|CDR|Okay. Yes, sir. I'm parked.
1471447|CC|Okay - -
1471448|CDR|Gave you my readings.
1471448|CC|Okay. You gave me my - your readings and when you get done, let me know, because the first thing we want to do is work on the SEP a little bit.
1471500|CDR|Okay. Stand by. Got TV. Okay. What do you want to do to the SEP?
1471519|CC|Okay, Geno. When you go back to the SEP now, and let's do this first and get it out of the way, it'll - you can probably do this anyway while Jack's coming home. When you opened the blankets, remember that at the back of the SEP there was a piece of Velcro on the case and a piece of Velcro just above the - just inside the rear hinge on the covers, and this is what you sort of peel back when you go to remove the back end there so you can get the DSEA out. You remember that piece of tape there?
1471548|CDR|Yes. That came off.
1471549|CC|Okay.
1471550|CDR|That came off.
1471551|CC|Okay. This is on the side away from you as you stand facing it. Right?
1471558|LMP|Oh, no. That's the side - Go ahead, Gene, I'm sorry.
1471602|CDR|Okay, go ahead.
1471603|CC|Okay. Gene, I'm - if you stand facing it, in the back away from you is this - there's a strip of Velcro on the case and there's another strip of Velcro on the blanket itself and this is the Velcro you have to tear off or to unhook, as it were, when you come to tear the blankets down to get the DSEA off. Remember that piece?
1471626|CDR|Yes, but that's on the - yes, that's on the side away from me. I'm on the LMPs side and that's on the other side.
1471631|CC|Right. That's on the other side of the top. And what we're interested in, number 1, is that piece of Velcro still mated or when you open the blankets to cool it, does that Velcro come open? Over.
1471649|CDR|Well, that's the Velcro that's so full of dust it comes open, Bob.
1471651|CC|Okay, and so what happens - -
1471653|CDR|Trying to stay - it's hooked - it'll stay.
1471657|CC|Okay. Well, the feeling - -
1471658|CDR|I don't know if you can see that but it's - Well, you can't depend -
1471704|CC|Okay, well, feeling is that - -
1471705|CDR|Bob, I swung the covers and - they will stay open about 150 degrees.
1471716|CC|I - Stand by on that. What you're saying is that the cover actually stands up a little bit in space.
1471727|CDR|Now, if you want the cover open, I can open it and normally it should swing 180 degrees parallel with the top of the SEP.
1471735|CC|Okay, but does that Velcro in back stay mated? - -
1471736|CDR|Well, the Velcro holds - the way that we've been opening it - it holds. Yes, it's being mated but it - but it and probably it holds the covers open 150 degrees.
1471749|CC|No. That's okay. What we're - talk - what the concern originally was was that when this - -
1471752|CDR|The Velcro - -
1471752|CC|- - happened, the front light was getting down in the back there and warming up the back of the SEP. That's apparently not the case. Over.
1471802|CDR|No, that's not the case. The Velcro that came off is the Velcro that helps the - keeps the covers closed.
1471808|CC|Okay. We were concerned about both pieces of Velcro since the one had come off.
1471815|CDR|No. The other one is still on and it still holds in the back part of the SEP where the DSEA is in the shade.
1471822|CC|Okay. I copy that. Okay. While we're talking about this and I'll get back with you, turn the DSEA and the receiver both to OFF, please. And read me a temperature, please.
1471836|CDR|112 degrees.
1471837|CC|Copy that. And I mark them both off, right?
1471844|CDR|Yes.
1471849|CDR|Bob, I just dusted it as clean as it'll get.
1471851|CC|Okay. Thank you.
1471945|LMP|Hey, Bob.
1471947|CC|Go ahead.
1471947|LMP|I cheated on you.
1471949|CC|I was sure you would. What did you do?
1471952|LMP|I just sampled the glass in the bottom of a crater. I documented it by shooting the LM across the crater at infinity and then shooting the crater with stereo at 11 feet and in that cross-Sun pair at 7; and then I sampled it.
1472013|CC|Okay.
1472014|LMP|Then I took a cross-Sun pair at 7 after.
1472017|CC|I guess - I guess now gnomon is a LM.
1472020|LMP|It's very fragile. That's right. It's very fragile, and I double bagged it. I don't know whether we can keep it or not.
1472030|CC|Okay. We'll hope.
1472030|CDR|You may think about how to preserve it.
1472032|CC|Okay.
1472042|LMP|While you're thinking, I'll put it on my floor pan, I guess. Okay. What do I have to do here?
1472050|CDR|Get this bag off me to start.
1472051|LMP|Get that bag off you to start with.
1472054|CDR|Be careful of that sample there.
1472101|CDR|Those are the cleanest battery covers in existence on a Rover right now, I tell you. Oh, you don't believe me - look at that.
1472110|LMP|What?
1472110|CDR|They don't believe me.
1472113|LMP|Excuse me. Move forward just a little. And I'll get your bag. Here you go.
1472121|CDR|Now you're stuck down there, aren't you? No you're not. Seems like you - I may be going nuts talking to that moving machine over there.
1472135|LMP|Boy, I - we don't need any hooks; I'll tell you.
1472137|CDR|I know it.
1472138|LMP|Can you stoop just a little bit.
1472140|CDR|Yes, all that stuff is getting - There, it's fixed.
1472142|LMP|Get your hook back.
1472144|CDR|Okay. I hook my harness back up so I don't forget that.
1472149|LMP|Velcro's closed. Okay. You know as you look at those little sparklies in the soil we're walking on and they change colors on you - -
1472159|CDR|Yes.
1472200|LMP|- - Greens and purples, iridescent. Iridescent sparklies.
1472205|CDR|Okay. I'll come over, and I'll unload.your stuff.
1472207|LMP|Okay. Now, we got more samples than we've got sense - I think. Let's see here - you got - you're taking care of the SEP.
1472221|CDR|Yes, don't - that's all right. Okay. Hey Bob, the battery covers - or the covers are open on the SEP, rather.
1472227|CC|Roger. Copy that.
1472232|CDR|Oh, why did I do that?
1472234|LMP|Hey, Bob, you think that glass sample would be better off in the SRC?
1472240|CC|We're still talking about that.
1472245|CDR|Wait a minute. Your core cap assembly is empty. Up and away it goes. And that's all closed. Check your bag. Okay. Now, Bob, you've got to tell us which one of these you want in the SCB and which one you want just taken in, because we got our numbers sill confused.
1472317|CC|Okay. Go ahead. What we would like to do here are the closeouts, guys. Let me read this to you first of all. In the SRC, we'd like the following stuff along with - let's see - Stand by.
1472344|CDR|Is this 9 or 6?
1472345|CC|Okay, guys. We're going to follow an Apollo 16 mode and put stuff in loose, because they'd like to segregate stuff in the following way. We'd like to put the long can and four core tubes in the SRC. I guess it's going to take a long - going to take a while just carrying stuff back and forth. But they'd probably like to get this in, because it's the volatile stuff. They'd like to get the long can and three core tubes in the SRC number 1. And then we'd like to get all the SCB-4 samples in the same SRC. Over.
1472423|LMP|Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
1472424|CDR|Yes. You want - -
1472425|LMP|Okay.
1472425|CDR|- - Three - three - three plus the long can; that's four cores all together.
1472429|CC|Right. Put those in the SRC -
1472430|CDR|All samples from 4.
1472432|CC|All the samples from SCB-4.
1472434|CDR|Okay.
1472437|LMP|These are 4. You want to get the core tubes in first, though.
1472439|CDR|Yes. I want to put these in. If you'd give me the - Yes, I only got two hands. I'll come back by the time you pick them out.
1472455|CC|Okay, and then - 17, do you guys remember where the trench samples - the three trench soil samples - which bag those were put in - from the Station 4? Over.
1472512|CDR|Yes, let's see. I'm the only one who had bags, so I bagged them and put them in whatever bag Jack had. I think.
1472519|LMP|Yes.
1472519|CC|Okay, then that'll be SCB-4, so we'd like those in SCB-4. And that - those are the ones that will go in the rock box and that's in agreement with what we want to do.
1472531|CDR|Okay, give me those other two cores, if you've got them, Jack.
1472534|LMP|Okay.
1472535|CDR|Long can.
1472553|LMP|The long can. Here's a - oh. Got it? it's slippery.
1472559|CDR|Yes, and we need one more core.
1472602|LMP|One more core.
1472604|CDR|Okay. That right now? Three core tubes and a long can?
1472608|CDR|Yes, got them all.
1472609|CC|And then - Roger that. And then SCB-4 - all the samples in SCB-4. We won't bother to try and sort them out, and then beyond that we'll fill them up with samples from SCB-5. Over.
1472625|CDR|Which one's that? That's 5. Let me get 4, first.
1472627|LMP|Here, hold this. I'll get it.
1472628|CDR|Well, it's on the gate right there, just hanging. I just put it there.
1472635|CDR|Four is the one I had on there at Shorty? Or you had on at Shorty? Yes. You had it on. I don't know, but they should have that logged. That's - I don't remember who had it on.
1472650|LMP|Well, now wait a minute. I - I took the trench. You held the bags, and I put them in you.
1472655|CDR|You put them on me. Did I have 4 on at Shorty?
1472656|CC|Yes.
1472656|LMP|That's what they said.
1472659|CC|That's affirm. That's why we want SCB-4 put in the - or dumped into the thing. But it's a dirty bag, so we just want to dump the samples in.
1472709|CDR|Okay.
1472711|LMP|Okay. And you want 5 to fill it up. Okay, Bob -
1472728|CC|Okay. And, Jack, it probably would protect the glass a bit better if you put it in the SRC gently with the other rocks there. But particularly if you don't fill the SRC too full. But, again, We'll be putting SCB samples in there to more or less flesh it out if there's not too many SCB-4 samples.
1472755|LMP|Leave a space for a sample, I guess, Gene.
1472800|CDR|Well, you'd better give it to me. There's not much space, it's going fast. You really - -
1472805|LMP|Well, can you leave one -
1472809|CDR|Where is the sample?
1472810|LMP|Well, it's over here.
1472811|CDR|I'll get it.
1472813|LMP|No, I'll bring it to you. I just - There's some way to -
1472822|CDR|Just set it in there. ... I'll be delicate with it. Take this bag back. Okay. It's in the right-hand back corner of the SRC.
1472838|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1472841|LMP|You're just about full - you - you got some left in there?
1472844|CDR|I got some small ones and some big ones, too.
1472847|LMP|Don't fill it too full.
1472849|CDR|No. Hey, we got some big rock samples.
1472857|CDR|Okay, Bob. SCB-6 and SC - wait a minute - what's in 6?
1472902|CC|Six - probably nothing. But tell us - -
1472903|CDR|No, there's samples in 6.
1472904|CC|Okay. You should also have SCB-8 under your seat with samples in it.
1472909|CDR|This is what I sampled at - -
1472912|CC|At Station 3, maybe.
1472914|CDR|Six has the samples from - from - Yes.
1472921|CC|Okay. Let's take up SCB-8 - -
1472923|CDR|We have more samples today than Carter - -
1472925|CC|And let's take up SCB-6 with a ... and why don't you dump out the Rover samples into SCB-6?
1472936|LMP|Well, one reason not to take 6 is I don't know if I can get it off.
1472942|CC|Okay. And let's save SCB-4 because I think you may need that tomorrow.
1472954|CDR|Four is on the rack, empty.
1472956|CC|Okay. How about SCB-5? is that only partially emptied, or is it totally emptied?
1473003|CDR|Oh, it's about half full, Bob.
1473004|CC|Okay. We'll take that up with us.
1473008|CDR|Bob - Bob, I've already - Let me tell you what I've done. I've got SCB-8 full.
1473018|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1473019|CDR|Let's take it up.
1473020|CC|Roger. On that.
1473027|CDR|It's got Rover samples in it.
1473029|CC|Okay.
1473031|CDR|But I can't get them all. They won't all be in there.
1473034|CC|Okay, 8.
1473038|CDR|Okay. Bob, the seal was clean. It was clear, and I got - I got your four cores - three cores, plus a long can. I got Jack's glass. I got SCB-4 and a couple of samples out of SCB-5.
1473056|CC|Copy that. Sounds great.
1473103|CDR|Okay. Now where was I? You got me all out of whack, here.
1473109|CC|That's affirm.
1473109|CDR|Core cap dispenser - Okay, you're clean cosmic ray is done. SCB-5, yes, okay. Now, Jack, we've got SCB-5 that's half full. What have you got over there?
1473118|LMP|Bring it over here, and I'll put it into 6. Six is half - is a little more than half full.
1473127|CDR|Well, this is a little less than half full.
1473128|LMP|Okay.
1473129|CDR|That ought to make one full bag. Hey, these are big rocks so they'll come out easy. Where's that big, big rock we got? That's in one of those bags, too. Picked up a big rock - here let me see if I can't dump it. How's that for a lunar dump, huh?
1473155|LMP|Perfect.
1473201|CDR|I want to see if I can't dust - did you lock this one over here? - No.
1473204|LMP|Hey, don't lock those - -
1473205|CDR|No, I'm going to see if I can dust them and make them work easier.
1473207|LMP|Boy, I'll tell you - I really had to pull. I pulled harder than I like to in a pressure suit.
1473212|CDR|See if I can -
1473216|CDR|Okay, Bob. SCB-8 and 6 are going up.
1473222|CC|Okay, and I understand 5 will be - -
1473224|CDR|... go up.
1473224|CC|- - on the gate.
1473228|CDR|Yes, sir, Bob. It'll be there.
1473231|LMP|And 7 under the LMPs seat.
1473233|CDR|4 and 5 sill be on the gate. You know, here's a problem for you tonight. You got any way of freeing up these gate hinges that lock the bags on? They're - I'm dusting them, but they're not going to lock - any of them. They're frozen tight, just about.
1473251|CC|Okay. Copy that. We'll talk about it.
1473253|CDR|If you do get them locked - if you do - if you do get them locked, you may never get them off.
1473259|CC|Okay. We'll give them something to work on overnight.
1473304|CDR|Okay, I'm - I'm dusting them right now. But - I still can't free them up.
1473313|LMP|Man those are heavy bags.
1473313|CC|Jack, have you got the top of the bag closed?
1473320|LMP|Yes, what do you need?
1473322|CC|Okay. No. John thought maybe you were still open. We were worried.
1473328|LMP|Oh, no, I latched them. I'll check them again before I go up.
1473331|CC|Okay, and we got no FSRs underneath the seat. We understand. Roger.
1473338|LMP|No, if - I just checked and it's - it's all - they're all in the bags. And the Rover sample bag is empty.
1473352|CC|Copy that.
1473353|LMP|Not nothing left.
1473355|CDR|Bob, Bob, neither one of these bag latchers are going to latch on the back. I dusted them, but - -
1473402|CC|Okay.
1473402|CDR|- - They're not going to work. I can't free them up -
1473405|CC|We'll talk about it tonight - -
1473406|LMP|We'll use the seat.
1473406|CC|- - Don't worry about it now.
1473409|CDR|Yes, we can probably - we can probably use the seat. We've got a little more room than we had. Okay. Let me get something else done.
1473417|LMP|I wonder if I ought to take a sample bag holder up there to see if I can fix that, to see if it fixes.
1473424|CC|Roger, Jack. I'd suggest that.
1473425|LMP|Probably ought to, huh?
1473430|CDR|Okay. Receiver's been dusted and blankets are open; power is OFF and OFF. Okay. I'm going to take the TGE off now, or dust it and then take it off, and then just leave it there. Hey, congratulate Jose on that fender will you, because I think he just saved us an awful lot of problems. He and whoever else worked on it.
1473456|CC|He mumbled something very humbly about a thousand guys.
1473503|CDR|Well, tell him - tell him that's going to be my bring home present to him - a picture of his fender.
1473513|LMP|Okay, Bob. Unused gear, which you have an inventory on is in the - under the LMPs seat.
1473535|LMP|Okay. Where am I?
1473539|CDR|I'm bringing the TGE over here, but I'm not pushing it yet.
1473543|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1473544|LMP|Cosmic ray's deployed. Man, I got the sorest hands in the world, right now.
1473557|CC|How about on the Moon?
1473559|CDR|(Singing) Nothing's in the big bag, is it?
1473604|LMP|I just can't compete with you astronomers.
1473607|CC|Just keep trying.
1473608|CDR|Nothing's in the bag, is it? Big bag?
1473612|LMP|Nothing's in the big bag.
1473614|CDR|Okay.
1473616|LMP|Unless there's one rock that disappeared yesterday I don't know what happened to it.
1473621|LMP|Hey, we forgot the polarizing filter work.
1473624|CDR|No, I saw it on the checklist, and I mentioned it to Bob, and he didn't come back with anything. And there was -
1473632|CDR|Okay. I guess I'm going to go ahead and - -
1473635|LMP|Put those in the - under that seat, please.
1473637|CDR|Yes, there's only one left.
1473640|LMP|One? No, there's three or four - -
1473642|CDR|There's three left.
1473642|LMP|Just put them under there. Who knows, we may need them at the rate we're going.
1473646|CC|Okay. And, Jack, while you're unloading there - -
1473649|CDR|Dust TV before I pull those breakers.
1473650|CC|- - on the 500 millimeter, you might squeeze off a few shots of the North and South Massif there, if there's any lineations visible.
1473702|LMP|Okay. I'm - I'll give it a try. Why, are we ahead of time?
1473709|CC|No, we're working right on time.
1473713|LMP|Okay.
1473714|CDR|Why don't you give it to me while you're packing the ETB, Jack; I'll do it.
1473717|LMP|Am I - am I behind you, now?
1473718|CDR|Yes, I - I just - I'm going to start inventorying the Rover and pulling the breakers so -
1473724|PAO|We're at 7 hours 2 minutes and anticipate ending the EVA at 7 hours 30 minutes.
1473730|CDR|Man, we are so far off nominal on what bags. (Laughter) I sort of didn't think - The checklist is going to have to be updated, I guess.
1473740|CC|Totally.
1473754|LMP|Oh, I should call - mag Charlie.
1473758|CC|Copy that.
1473758|LMP|Mag Kilo.
1473800|CC|Copy.
1473801|LMP|Mag Bravo.
1473810|PAO|That's Gene Cernan using the camera with the 500 millimeter lens.
1473817|LMP|Mag Golf.
1473821|LMP|Mag India.
1473823|CC|Copy all those. And tell Gene that we can confirm that his lens cover's off.
1473836|LMP|Okay. They confirm that your lens cover's off. The scissors are in.
1473841|CC|Copy that.
1473847|LMP|Lens brushes.
1473852|CDR|I hope that's at the right setting. It is (laughter).
1473857|LMP|Hey, try f/5.6 directly down-Sun or up-Sun at that Sculptured Hills there in the - in the distance. See where I mean?
1473919|CDR|Yes I get it.
1473921|LMP|Okay, Bob. What else do I need Here? Let's see. 500, mag R, need mag R - as soon as you're through.
1473931|CC|Yes. I think we've got enough of those now, Gene. You got the maps?
1473940|LMP|Yes, got them.
1473947|CDR|Some of these won't overlap, Bob, because I'm hurrying.
1473949|LMP|Don't - Don't smear them.
1473950|CC|Don't - Don't hurry and smear them.
1473952|CDR|They're not smeared, but I just didn't overlap some of them.
1473955|CDR|Okay. Everyone agrees to that. Don't hurry and smear them (laughter). I'll get those others, Jack, tomorrow.
1474003|CC|Okey. You got the maps in there, too, Jack?
1474005|CDR|Frame count, Bob, is -
1474008|LMP|Yes.
1474010|CDR|Frame count is 152 on the 500.
1474012|CC|Copy that.
1474015|CDR|(Laughter)
1474016|LMP|Let go of it. There.
1474018|CDR|Okay.
1474019|LMP|Dynamic. Did you cycle it twice?
1474022|CDR|No, I'll cycle it twice.
1474024|CC|Do you have the maps there, Jack?
1474025|CDR|Okay. I guess I'll go in and pull some Rover breakers.
1474029|CC|Okay. And - Roger. Copy that.
1474035|CDR|Oh, boy - Oh, boy. Pulling - pulling breakers is not going to be much fun.
1474043|LMP|You want me to - you want the scissors or something?
1474046|CDR|No. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
1474059|LMP|Mag Romeo.
1474102|CC|Copy that. You got the maps, Jack?
1474105|LMP|No. (Laughter) You ask me that one more time partner, and I'm going to get mad at you.
1474115|CDR|Oh, I got - What have you got over there - you got the scissors?
1474122|LMP|Yes, you want them?
1474124|CDR|I got three or four breakers. Let me try this other one one more time. Okay. I got it - with the old fingers.
1474135|CC|Okay. Copy that. All four of them out, Gene.
1474137|CDR|Okay; Alfa, Bravo. Yes, sir. Alfa, Bravo, Charlie, Delta are OPEN. I'll get the LCRU power.
1474146|CC|Okay. And, Gene, when you leave the camera, a reminder to face it away from the Sun and tilt it down.
1474158|CDR|Okay.
1474206|CC|Hey, Gene. That's not quite away from the Sun. Really it ought to be, you know, down-Sun.
1474212|CDR|...
1474218|PAO|And that will end the TV until EVA 3 tomorrow.
1474226|CDR|Bob, are you reading?
1474228|CC|Roger. Loud and clear.
1474234|LMP|I read you, Gene.
1474235|CDR|Yes. See, I just turned LCRU power off; they got to go through the LM.
1474239|CC|That's right.
1474242|CDR|Bob, do you read?
1474243|CC|Loud and clear.
1474250|LMP|Is this gravimeter working?
1474252|CDR|No, it's not. I didn't push it yet. Hello, Houston, come on - in other words, I'll turn this power back on.
1474259|CC|Read you loud and clear, Gene. Do you read Houston?
1474300|CDR|Well, let me turn it on and talk to them.
1474302|CC|We read you loud and clear, Gene.
1474307|CDR|Well, I just turned the LCRU back on. Are you reading us through the LM, now?
1474311|CC|Yes, we came through the LM that time.
1474316|CDR|Okay. I'm turning it off and the - and the camera is pointed down and it's pointed effectively to the west - down-Sun.
1474323|CC|Okay. Copy that. Very good. Thank you.
1474324|CDR|LCRU POWER'S going OFF. Okay, LCRU POWER is OFF. Battery covers - open battery covers. They're all dusted already.
1474344|CC|Copy that. Roger. They're reading us. 17, you read Houston?
1474358|CDR|Uh-ooh, I got to - got to work on one battery.
1474410|CC|17, you read Houston?
1474421|CC|17, you read Houston? Over.
1474430|CDR|Hey, Bob - -
1474432|CC|Roger, 17. Do you read?
1474435|CDR|Still there? Well, they're supposed to be going through the LM ...
1474443|CC|17, do you read Houston?
1474444|LMP|Got something fouled up. Maybe we got the switches wrong, or something, up there. ... think so, though.
1474453|CDR|No.
1474455|LMP|They talked to us first.
1474457|CDR|Let me give them a call.
1474504|CC|17, do you read. Houston? Over.
1474505|CDR|Bob, you want to try again. We're on the LCRU. Yes, we read you, but I'm on the LCRU again. We're not reading you through the LM.
1474512|CC|Yes, I don't understand that. Stand by. Press on with the rest of the closeout.
1474518|CDR|Well, I'll leave you on the LCRU, here. And we're pressing on. Okay. For the first time, I've got to dust the center battery cover. All the others are good.
1474527|CC|Okay. Roger, 17. Do you read Houston now?
1474533|CDR|Well, yes, but I'm on the LCRU. I don't know.
1474536|CC|No, now they say we're going back to the LM again. Press on with the closeout.
1474541|CDR|Okay, Bob. I'm going to go turn the LCRU POWER, OFF. And for the first time, I've got to dust the center radiator on the batteries.
1474552|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1474552|CDR|... until this time, they've all been real clean.
1474555|CC|Copy that.
1474559|CDR|Okay. Give me a short count. And in the interim I'm going to turn the LCRU POWER, OFF.
1474603|CC|Okay. Roger. 1-2-3, 3-2-1. Okay, Houston, or 17, do you read Houston? Over.
1474610|CDR|Okay. We've got you.
1474612|CC|Okay; very good.
1474618|CDR|Yes. We got you, Bob.
1474620|CC|Okay. We've got about 20 minutes before we have to be inside the LM there, fellows. Let's hustle on.
1474629|CDR|Oh, I think we'll just sort of take it easy, Bob. Okay. The MESA's tidied.
1474637|CC|Thank you.
1474637|LMP|I've got the canisters; pins are green.
1474641|CC|Copy that.
1474642|LMP|The LM canister's in the pocket.
1474644|CC|Very good.
1474646|LMP|And, let's see. I think I'm ready to dust. Could I help you?
1474651|CDR|No, I'm leaving here right now.
1474653|CC|Okay. And, Gene, as you go by, how about giving us the SEP temperature readings.
1474654|CDR|... I got to take these bags up. Oh, me. I will.
1474749|CC|17, Houston. It's awfully quiet.
1474755|CDR|Okay, Bob. Here's your reading. About 100 and - about 108 to 10 degrees.
1474805|CC|Okay. Copy that. Okay. We'll leave it there, as is, overnight. Thank you.
1474814|CDR|And I'll give it one good little smack with the brush. And it's as clean as it'll ever come.
1474820|CC|Okay. Thank you.
1474827|CDR|Jack, you might just as well go cold water. There's no more use for it now, if you're warm.
1474831|LMP|No, I'm not warm I'm just - want to hand me that other SCB there.
1474840|CDR|Oh, man! (Laughter). Oh, the - The cover's open on this one.
1474845|LMP|You wonder why it's hard to get up the ladder.
1474848|CDR|Don't hold it by the cover.
1474849|LMP|What do I want these tongs on for?
1474851|CDR|Give them to me. I'll take them out.
1474853|LMP|Just noticed them.
1474856|CDR|Don't want them.
1474859|LMP|Okay. Thank you.
1474901|CDR|Don't take it by the cover. The cover's going to come open. Take it by this.
1474904|LMP|Wait a minute.
1474906|CDR|Got it?
1474906|LMP|I got it.
1474907|CDR|Okay.
1474911|CDR|Probably got tongs on for the same reason I've got them on.
1474951|CC|And, 17, we're ready for a grav measurement.
1474957|CDR|Yes, sir, Bob. Just cleaning up the Rover. Getting our tongs out of the way.
1475002|CC|Okay.
1475004|CDR|And for your information - for your information, at this heading, the - the western-most battery cover, like I talked about yesterday, is just starting to cover the - just started to cover the radiators.
1475020|CC|Okay; cover that - copy that.
1475028|CDR|(Humming) You know, I think another good day's work.
1475032|LMP|Yes. Okay. I dusted all that. I just knocked as hard as I could, on my feet, several - several times.
1475044|CDR|What you're going to say is you want me to brush you, huh? Well, let me keep this out of the way so it doesn't get dusty.
1475049|LMP|Okay.
1475100|CDR|Wonder if our bouncing around that gravimeter is going to disturb it like this.
1475105|LMP|Shouldn't.
1475107|CDR|Got to do - well - -
1475108|LMP|... Want me down.
1475108|CDR|You got to do me first.
1475109|LMP|Yes. Plink.
1475112|CDR|You're not nearly as dusty as you were yesterday; you're just dirty, that's all.
1475116|LMP|Well.
1475116|CDR|1 think I can get everything off my shoes by banging, if you'll just get ny arms. I didn't really fall in much today, except maybe my left arm. But - -
1475126|LMP|I tell you, we saw some of the things I think we saw today. We both fell in (laughter).
1475130|CDR|Don't. Oh!
1475133|LMP|What? I hurt you?
1475135|CDR|Yes, you're hitting.
1475136|LMP|Well, you're right. Sorry. I don't have much control (laughter).
1475141|CDR|(Laughter) I know it. That's the way mine feel. That's dirty. There.
1475155|LMP|I'm glad they can't see this.
1475204|CDR|Oh, I stand out here and I look at that flag, and I look at the Rover, and I look at those massifs. It's still hard to believe.
1475211|LMP|What did we deserve to do - do to deserve being out here, huh?
1475222|CDR|Okay. That's not very good. Let me get your - some - your PLSS, here. Keep - go forward just a little. ... There you go.
1475232|LMP|I think your sharp turns are - Hey, that fender is - is really a classic. One might say it's a - a Young fender; just put it on.
1475249|CDR|Do we need, do we really need those clamps? clamps?
1475252|LMP|No. No.
1475254|CDR|I can't think of anything we need them for. That - that light - but you can tie that light somewhere - -
1475258|LMP|We don't - well -
1475259|CDR|I might bring one back.
1475301|LMP|Yes. We ought to leave one in tribute - Dr. Young.
1475316|CDR|Oh, that orange soil was something.
1475319|LMP|Huh?
1475319|CDR|And the way it went radially down that - down that crater. Let me turn, and then take another look, and then I'll - then you get up there.
1475327|LMP|You got quite a bit around your hoses here.
1475329|CDR|My hoses?
1475331|LMP|Okay, and I don't know what I can do about it, Geno.
1475335|CDR|Oh, just give it a swap ...
1475337|LMP|Well, I got it the best I could. Let me get the top of your LCRU there.
1475341|CDR|Mine's pretty good.
1475343|LMP|... RCU.
1475344|CDR|Yes, mine's good. Okay. Let me get to your front
1475347|LMP|No, I didn't get your other arm here.
1475348|CDR|Oh, okay.
1475350|LMP|I don't know that I can.
1475352|CDR|It's the inside arm. I don't have anything on it.
1475354|LMP|No, that's right. You don't. It isn't - it's about the same.
1475357|CDR|When you fall out - you fall out on your other arm.
1475359|LMP|I've got - there is some on that leg there.
1475401|CDR|Okay.
1475406|LMP|Don't know what I'm going to do about it. I think we're Just going to have to make do.
1475418|CDR|Let me see what I can do with you. Just look at me.
1475423|LMP|What is this rock, right here, by the pad.
1475425|CDR|I don't know - I. Did I just turn your comm? Do you still hear me?
1475429|LMP|Yes. I've just been intending to mention that several times. Anybody that lands on a rock ought to have their head examined.
1475438|CDR|Put their ladder - Boy, where have you been again today?
1475442|LMP|Oh, I played some games there around Station 3. I'm sorry.
1475449|CDR|Boy, oh, boy!
1475450|LMP|Wasn't intentional.
1475451|CDR|Whoo - But I - lot of your turns - -
1475453|CDR|Hold your arm up. Hold your arm up.
1475454|LMP|Lot of your turns threw dust - -
1475459|CDR|Yes, I noticed that (chuckle).
1475500|LMP|- - on me.
1475502|CDR|God dang that rock! If I was strong enough, I'd move it. Hey, I am strong enough. That's one we ought to bring home.
1475510|LMP|Well, if we can't fill up the LM with anything else.
1475512|CDR|That's about the size of the S - SRC. Stand up on the pad. Oh, shoot! First time that's happened.
1475528|LMP|Here, hold on to me.
1475547|CDR|You know, by rights, that should happen more. I want to get around back and then I want you to get up on the ladder some. Oh, man, let me get the back of your PLSS. What did you bump against? I guess that's from the Rover seat.
1475602|LMP|I think it is.
1475603|CDR|No, I mean you got a couple abrasions right on through the - -
1475606|LMP|So do you. I wasn't going to mention them.
1475610|CDR|Well, these are only a pin-hole thick, but - -
1475619|LMP|All I can say is it's better than walking.
1475621|CDR|Oh, man, I'll tell you, we covered over 20 kilometers today, babe. You like to walk up and down those hills and ditches at 20 kilometers? Okay. Can you - turn towards me? I want to get the front of your legs one time (laughter). Come back.
1475643|CC|Okay. And, 17, Houston - how's the dusting coming?
1475645|LMP|Man, you've had your day of dusting, haven't you?
1475650|CDR|Well, we're almost there. I'm going to send the LMP in in about a minute.
1475657|CC|Okay. We're getting to a point where we need to be inside in less than 10 minutes, with the thing closed up.
1475659|CDR|Oh, I tell you, I've ... more hours ... dustbrush - -
1475706|CDR|Yes, sir. We're on our way, Bob. That takes care of it. Knock your feet off, Jack. Knock your feet off on the ladder.
1475714|LMP|Okay.
1475715|CC|And don't forget the antennas, guys.
1475717|LMP|Okay. I need the pallet.
1475720|CDR|Oh, Bob, you're a beauty. How did you think of that?
1475724|CC|John suggested it.
1475729|CDR|John who? (Laughter) He strikes again. You'd broke yours off sure, because I wouldn't have seen it as you went up unless I took inventory with my book, which I'll do here in a minute. Open battery covers, taken care of; dusted LCRU; blankets open 100 percent. They've been open 100 percent all day.
1475754|LMP|Okay.
1475759|LMP|If I can just get up here. Oh, shoot. I forgot a snap up there.
1475803|CDR|Now, let's make sure we got all of those. I don't want to get hung up on anything.
1475806|LMP|Yes. I mean I forgot to put the antenna under the snap - under the other thing.
1475825|CDR|... get the snap.
1475835|CDR|Okay. Get it.
1475855|LMP|Okay. You're set.
1475857|CDR|Okay. Go on up, Jack, and I'm going to read the gravimeter.
1475900|LMP|I need that pallet before I go.
1475903|CDR|Okay.
1475906|CC|Okay, and, Gene, we don't think you've punched the grav reading yet.
1475912|CDR|Yes - Yes, I did, Bob. I'm going to read it for you in a minute.
1475916|CC|Okay.
1475917|LMP|Okay.
1475925|CDR|The reading is 670, 023, 501; that's 670, 023, 501.
1475934|CC|Okay. We got that. Go to STANDBY. Open the cover and dust the radiator if it needs it. Or dust the radiator, period.
1475947|CDR|It's dusted already - it's dusted already, I took care of that. And I'm in STANDBY.
1475951|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1475953|CDR|Okay. Final check - LRV. Blankets open 100; battery covers, open; samples off. We checked under both seats. Equipment stowed. Okay. You're all clean to go in. Okay. Dust SEP, blankets open; verify POWER, OFF; RECORDER, OFF; TGE, that's read, that's where I dusted. Tidy the MESA blankets - they're okay. Okay, and I've got this box to bring up when I go. Okay, let's see - Oh, man, that's bright - no PLSS antenna, brush the ladder hook, EVA pallet to LMP - you got it - the pins are green and reading, STANDBY, open TGE thermal cover lid and dust - that's done. Final check; we got the pallet, ETB is on the hook, you inventoried the S-IVBs [sic], Mr. Parker, and I guess you're happy we got them all.
1480052|CC|Roger.
1480052|CDR|SRC-2 is in my hand. The big bag is not required.
1480055|CC|Roger that. And we're ready to call you all in as you go through the hatch.
1480100|CDR|Okay. Jack's going in with the -
1480105|CDR|Okay, Jack's halfway through it now, and I'm going on up the ladder.
1480108|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1480116|CDR|Oh, my; oh me. How you coming?
1480123|LMP|Just about there.
1480128|CDR|Oh, that's a nice one-handed first step. Godspeed the crew of Apollo 17. I'm going to keep reading that. I like that message. How's Captain America, speaking of Apollo 17.
1480149|CC|Captain America is sound asleep - just about to come around to AOS. We think he's sound asleep.
1480156|CDR|Hey, how does that always happen? That happened yesterday.
1480209|CC|He got up before noon this morning, too.
1480215|CDR|Oh, okay. Just take it easy, Jack, it'll - here you go - -
1480229|LMP|Pip pin didn't work.
1480232|CDR|Lot of things don't work when your hands get tired; that's the problem. Wasn't a bad day. How long we been out, Bob. Of course, we're still out.
1480241|CC|7 plus 27, so far.
1480246|CDR|7 plus 27?
1480248|CC|How does that grab you?
1480252|CC|But we're getting anxious to get you in and get the hatch closed.
1480258|LMP|Well, we understand that.
1480259|CDR|Jack's unloading the pallet and as soon as it comes out, I'll shove this stuff in, and we'll be gone.
1480312|LMP|Just takes a certain amount of time.
1480314|CC|Okay, Gene. Are the three SCBs inside the hatch already?
1480323|CDR|No - Bob, I don't think any of them are inside. Let's see I've got - -
1480327|LMP|No.
1480327|CDR|- - I've got 8 here and 6 here and - and we emptied the contents of 4 into the - -
1480337|CC|Roger.
1480338|CDR|- - SRC, and we emptied the contents of 5 into one of these other two bags. So we've only got two of them here, plus the SRC.
1480344|CC|Roger that.
1480345|CDR|Five went into 6.
1480347|CC|Roger that.
1480351|CDR|And we've got two of them hanging on the tail of the Rover. And I don't know what it is under Jack's seat right now.
1480355|LMP|Seven is under my seat.
1480356|CC|We copy that. Don't worry about it.
1480404|LMP|One more battery, Geno, and it's yours.
1480406|CDR|Okay.
1480415|LMP|You always used to stand and watch me do this, anyway.
1480422|CDR|Yes, but we had some long EVAs at the Cape, but -
1480430|LMP|There you go.
1480432|CDR|Okay. Just be careful of the - let me get up there a little farther. Careful of that hatch. Getting to look like a regular garbage dump down there.
1480446|LMP|Okay. Ready?
1480449|CDR|Sorry, babe.
1480457|LMP|It's all right.
1480502|CDR|Now, this one's going to come open if we're not careful. Let me see if I've got one more step to go up. No I think that's the last one. I'll just hold it here until you get it. I could shove that in if I push it with the SRC. Jack, the cap'll came open. Be careful.
1480528|LMP|Okay. We got big silver box.
1480542|CDR|Can you push on that a little bit?
1480544|LMP|Yes.
1480546|CDR|Okay.
1480611|CDR|Okay. Okay, Bob, you've got the two SR - two SCBs -
1480619|LMP|I'll push it in.
1480620|CDR|- - SRC, and there goes the ETB.
1480624|CC|Copy that. Now how about a CDR?
1480628|CDR|There's only one thing left - that's right, that's the only thing left out here.
1480634|LMP|Are you on a checklist?
1480635|CDR|No, I'm not even on my checklist, but I guess - Yes, I am, it says INGRESS. Let me knock some more dust off.
1480647|LMP|Okay. Let me get behind the door.
1480651|CDR|Well, I'm going to take what dust I got in with me. Oh!
1480712|LMP|There you go. Keep your buttons close. You're good. Beautiful. Just float in. Hanging up a little on the purse, but that's all right. There you go.
1480744|CDR|Oh!
1480747|LMP|That's my arm I'm getting in the way, there - Let me get out of the way -
1480750|CDR|Let me just check that seal before we close that. Okay. Can you get your arm off?
1480800|LMP|Okay.
1480802|CDR|There's no big rocks in it, that I can see. Lots of dust on the floor.
1480809|LMP|Yes, I think it's okay. Okay, the hatch is partially closed - -
1480815|CDR|Let me get it. I think it says to lock it, doesn't it?
1480817|LMP|Well, we're supposed to close our water first.
1480819|CDR|Okay, FORWARD HATCH, CLOSE and LOCK; dump valves both AUTO, okay; confirm our water CLOSED. Let me see if I can't get my ... here.
1480830|LMP|Here, why don't I get yours and you get mine.
1480833|CDR|Okay. I just got mine. And if you'll turn, I'll get yours. You'll have to - your PLSS - your right arm high; pick it up high.
1480847|LMP|Oh, wait a minute.
1480848|CDR|No, I can't reach you, Jack, unless you turn -
1480850|LMP|Don't move yet; don't turn around.
1480851|CDR|Okay.
1480852|LMP|Move over to the corner.
1480859|CDR|Okay. ... sure I got the right ones. Far right, far left, secure oxygen. Okay. Your water's OFF.
1480913|LMP|Okay. Water's OFF.
1480917|CDR|Now, stay there and I'll lock the hatch.
1480919|LMP|I've got to get into position to do the other good things. You go ahead.
1480925|CDR|Am I - Do you have enough room or do I need to turn? No, let me get down there. Now, why can't -
1480941|LMP|Okay. Let me turn back; get out of your way. Got it?
1480947|CDR|Okay. Hatch is closed and locked.
1480950|CC|Okay. And remember, I think it's the overhead valve that you have to position to OPEN.
1480958|LMP|That's right.
1480958|CDR|Yes, you'll have to move over, Jack, so I can reach it.
1481003|CC|And you ought to verify both, I guess.
1481006|CDR|You're going to have to wait, then.
1481009|LMP|Can you reach it now?
1481011|CDR|Okay. No, you got to - got to swing left - -
1481014|LMP|Well, I'll have to -
1481016|CDR|- - Right.
1481016|LMP|I'll have to turn around, then. How's that? Any better?
1481027|CDR|No, you've got to - Okay.
1481028|LMP|Gene, for some reason I can't put my PLSS toward you.
1481031|CDR|No, you can't. Just face front, if you can, and move as far forward as you can.
1481034|LMP|Well, if I get my - I'm going to have to go all the way around, I guess.
1481039|CDR|Well, just -
1481040|LMP|Look, I've got to get the PLSS against the circuit breaker -
1481042|CDR|Wait. I've got you just where I want you. Now stay right there, and shift your weight as far to the right as you can.
1481049|CDR|Okay, it's AUTO - -
1481050|LMP|Okay.
1481051|CDR|- - and it's - and it's locked. Okay?
1481058|LMP|All right.
1481059|CDR|Now, CABIN REPRESS - AUTO. Can't get it. I'll have to turn left, here.
1481108|LMP|Huh?
1481109|CDR|Okay. Let me turn left.
1481110|LMP|No, I can get it.
1481111|CDR|Okay. CABIN REPRESS, AUTO.
1481114|LMP|AUTO.
1481115|CDR|And at 16, CABIN REPRESS breaker, CLOSED.
1481119|LMP|CLOSED.
1481119|CDR|MASTER ALARM and CABIN warning lights. Cabin's coming up, Bob, 0.5.
1481124|CC|Copy that.
1481132|LMP|I've still got 15 percent oxygen.
1481137|CDR|Okay. Cabin pressure's increasing - go PRESSURE REGs A and B, CABIN.
1481148|LMP|A CABIN.
1481149|CDR|Okay. And you PLSS O2 OFF at cabin greater 2.5. It's there now. And you're probably getting talked to.
1481208|CDR|Mine's OFF.
1481209|LMP|Mine's OFF.
1481210|CDR|Okay, cabin's up to 3.5, cabin's up to 4.0.
1481227|CDR|Okay. Next thing, Jack, you can start verifying your white dots are out.
1481231|LMP|Okay.
1481231|PAO|We mark the end of EVA at 148 hours 12 minutes 10 seconds. Total EVA duration 7 hours 37 minutes, 22 seconds.
1481232|CDR|And you can lose your PURGE valve to depress , if you have to.
1481235|LMP|Well, I don't think I have to. Okay; white dots.
1481240|CDR|Wait a minute. White dot's plus for you, EVA decals
1481247|LMP|Okay, I'm good here, here, here.
1481257|CC|And, 17, congratulations. That was two EVAs and a half.
1481307|CDR|Thank you Robert, but until I get my helmet and gloves off, I won't say anything.
1481313|CDR|Okay, Jack. On 16, ECS SUIT FAN 2 CLOSED.
1481316|LMP|CLOSED.
1481317|CDR|SUIT FAN DELTA-P, CLOSED.
1481318|LMP|CLOSED.
1481319|CDR|Okay. MASTER ALARM just came on. Okay. And the HEATERS, MESA, OPEN. You can OPEN your MESA HEATERS. We're getting a MASTER ALARM, Houston. I don't know why.
1481333|LMP|I think that's the - -
1481334|CDR|You did get SUIT FAN number 2?
1481335|LMP|-- got the SUIT - SUIT FAN DELTA-P ...
1481337|CDR|Okay. You've got SUIT FAN number 2 and me - and DELTA-P. Okay. - -
1481342|LMP|MESA is OPEN.
1481343|CDR|Okay. ECS cau - That's why it came on. ECS CAUTION WATER SEP light - component light should go out after that fan comes up. You can doff your glove.
1481350|CC|Roger. We think that's what happened.
1481351|CDR|Okay.
1481352|LMP|Oooh.
1481408|CDR|Well, I never thought I'd wear my EV cover gloves through two EVAs.
1481415|LMP|Oh, I forgot all about them.
1481416|CDR|No, I didn't. I thought about taking them off until I started chipping those boulders. And I'm glad I wore them.
1481423|LMP|Yes, I think it's a good idea.
1481425|CDR|As hard as it is on your hands, mine - these cover gloves are just ripped to a nub. Glad it's not my gloves.
1481445|LMP|I might consider taking them off tomorrow.
1481451|CC|Roger, 17. You talking about your cover gloves?
1481457|CDR|Yes. We're still wearing them, Bob. And, I swore I'd take them off after the drill, but I used a bit of real-time common sense.
1481506|CC|Okay.
1481506|LMP|Okay. Gloves are off. LMP's gloves are off. Need some help?
1481516|CDR|... Yes. I think you just about - -
1481523|LMP|No, you went the other way.
1481524|CDR|Did I go the wrong way? Yes, I did.
1481535|LMP|What's wrong with that one?
1481537|CDR|I don't know.
1481538|LMP|Shouldn't have done that.
1481541|CDR|Hey - you - Let me get this.
1481545|CDR|My hand!
1481547|LMP|Yes, I'm sorry.
1481549|CDR|Well, you get that one, and I'll get these two. Get that one.
1481554|CDR|I'll get this one.
1481606|LMP|I'll take that off. (Laughter) Hold this thing. Okay. Let me try that one, now.
1481644|CDR|It wants to go.
1481649|LMP|Let me try that. Yes, that one ... off. Got it?
1481654|CDR|Yes.
1481656|LMP|It's usually easier when you do it yourself. The angle's wrong.
1481700|CDR|Oh, boy. It's starting to get a little stiff. Oh, they came off. Wow, they came off. Oh, ho, ho, ho. Okay. Doff helmets, with visors. Here I'll get yours for you. Turn my way, if you can.
1481729|LMP|Yes. Do the - I know how you feel.
1481734|CDR|I don't know how they're so wet. I don't know whether it's - they're just soaking wet.
1481752|CDR|Everything is just twice as hard.
1481758|LMP|Now comes the old hay fever, again. That went up and that went down.
1481807|CDR|Stow in BRA. Let's get mine off though.
1481822|LMP|... now that these things are off.
1481827|CDR|Oh, man. Does that smell, doesn't it? You sure can pick that up.
1481830|LMP|Okay. You got yours?
1481831|CDR|I've got mine.
1481836|CDR|Okay, Bob. Now (laughter) helmets and gloves are off.
1481843|LMP|Pressure looks good, still.
1481905|CDR|Hello, Houston. Do you read?
1481907|CC|Roger, 17. Read you loud and clear, Challenger.
1481914|CDR|Very good, Robert. The helmets and gloves are off.
1481917|CC|Absolutely outstanding crew, there.
1481919|CDR|Why don't you go home and get some sleep, Bob?
1481920|CC|Absolutely outstanding. I can't say more than that. And I mean it from the bottom of my heart or the bottom of my soul or something, my conscience.
1481929|LMP|Thank you, Bob. Well, it's all ours.
1481935|CDR|Bob, it's all your good training and help - -
1481938|CC|777 plus 37, from 3.5 to 3.5.
1481947|LMP|As mission scientists, you're totally responsible.
1481949|CC|And the backup crew says that you are even better than outstanding.
1481952|LMP|Remember, it's in your contract (laughter). Well, thank you. We enjoyed it. Oh boy.
1482003|CC|Hey, I'll turn you over to Little Joe, here, while I go talk to some people.
1482009|LMP|Thanks again, Bob. We - -
1482009|CC|We've got a 9-1/2 hour EVA scheduled for you tomorrow. We're planning to spend 2-1/2 hours extra over there at Station 4.
1482016|CDR|(Laughter) I hope those gloves that you've got packed in the back have got something in them. (Laughter) Oh, let's read the checklist. See if we can go to bed on time tonight.
1482033|LMP|Oh, man.
1482034|CC|Okay. That might be a change.
1482035|LMP|I feel better them I did last night, as a matter of fact.
1482037|CDR|Do you?
1482037|CC|I'm turning you over - I'm going to turn you over to Joe.
1482041|LMP|That didn't do very much good.
1482042|CC|See you guys tomorrow.
1482043|CDR|Okay. Verify safety on dump valve. Yes.
1482046|LMP|Okay, Bob. Get some sleep, huh?
1482048|CDR|Yes, I verified them both.
1482049|LMP|Sorry to be touchy, occasionally.
1482051|CDR|DESCENT WATER valve, OPEN.
1482055|LMP|Okay. WATER valve's OPEN.
1482101|CDR|Okay. Then you can take your purge valve off.
1482109|CDR|There's a little dust in that tonight. Little stiffer. ... again. Remove purge valves, stow in purse. Disconnect OPS hoses.
1482121|LMP|Oh, man. That is dusty.
1482123|CDR|Yes, let's - let me disconnect yours; you disconnect mine. It's easier with the - the - -
1482129|LMP|I think I can get - What did you say?
1482131|CDR|- - OPS hoses.
1482132|LMP|Oh, yes.
1482133|CDR|Or whatever it said.
1482134|CDR|Yes.
1482135|LMP|Disconnect - disconnect OPS hose. is that what it said?
1482142|CDR|Yes.
1482147|CDR|Man - maneuver my fingers in here a little bit better.
1482154|LMP|They are all showing a little bit ... stickiness. Mine were in this in pairs. (Laughter)
1482200|CDR|Well, just everything's, you know, harder to -
1482203|LMP|Yes.
1482204|LMP|Okay. There, you're disconnected.
1482205|CDR|PGA diverter valve, horizontal.
1482208|LMP|Okay. Horizontal.
1482213|CDR|And SUIT ISOL, both to SUIT FLOW.
1482216|LMP|All right - -
1482216|CDR|We don't have the IM hoses on. So don't - Put mine to SUIT FLOW to get some air in here.
1482223|LMP|Yes. ... In the dust.
1482230|CDR|PLSS pump, off, and fan, off.
1482233|LMP|Okay.
1482235|CDR|Man, that's hot. Feel that.
1482239|LMP|Out in the Sun.
1482241|CDR|Yes.
1482243|LMP|Pump's off. Fan's off.
1482245|CDR|Okay. Oh - Disconnect PLSS H2O from PGA. Okay.
1482253|LMP|And connect LM water. That's what we want.
1482257|LMP|... the ... and ... flags.
1482301|CDR|Yes, and LM water - water hose, here.
1482309|LMP|I'm sorry that's so complex, there.
1482311|CDR|Oh, that's perfectly fine.
1482312|LMP|But it was easier to start.
1482314|CDR|It had to be. Smells like someone's been firing a carbine in here.
1482322|CDR|I'm just standing here pushing that - -
1482324|LMP|I will ...
1482325|CDR|- - hot breaker - When you get it.
1482329|CDR|Hey, little Joe? Are you there?
1482336|CC|17, this is Houston. And - -
1482339|CDR|Little Joe, are you there?
1482340|CC|Roger. How do you read Houston? Over.
1482345|CDR|Joe, we're reading you loud and clear. We're - the left-hand column and we're both going PLSS mode to O and we'll be off the air for a skosh.
1482353|CC|Roger, Geno. I've been following you real close, and you two are mighty smooth. Boy, was that nice today.
1482401|LMP|... feel how hot that is.
1482404|CDR|Yes, the whole thing.
1482441|PAO|Astronaut Joe Allen has come on to relieve Astronaut, Bob Parker, at CAPCOM. We're in the midst of a shift handover here in Mission Control. Flight Director, Gene Kranz and his team relieving the Pete Frank team. We anticipate the change of shift press briefing will begin at about 1:30 AM in the MSC News Center briefing room.
1482745|LMP|Okay, Joe. LMP's PLSS is getting O2.
1482749|CC|Thank you.
1483124|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 148 hours 31 minutes. The participants have left for the news center. And we anticipate the change of shift press briefing will begin in the next 5 or 10 minutes in Building 1. At present time the CSM, with Ron Evans aboard sleeping, is passing over the landing site. That second EVA ended at 148 hours 12 minutes 10 seconds with a total duration of 7 hours 37 minutes 22 seconds. And at present time the LM crew is in the process of getting the - getting out of their suits. They'll begin doing that shortly and then getting the LM cabin reconfigured and ready for their sleep period. And in the control center, tonight, while the crew is asleep, we'll be making plans for the third 7 hour EVA scheduled for tomorrow.
1483145|LMP|Joe, O2 is off.
1483146|CC|Roger.
1483300|CDR|Hey, Joe? This is Gene.
1483304|CC|Go ahead.
1483308|CDR|Hey, Challenger has been holding at about 5.5 ever since we got in here. Are you all happy with that?
1483321|CC|Looks good to us, Geno. We have been watching it and everyone is happy down here.
1483330|CDR|Okay. Well, this morning, when we were getting ready, we saw it at 5.5 and part of that has been at 5.0 all of the time. Just so we are not venting anything, that's all.
1483405|CC|Geno, we hear you on that and we'll - we'll be watching it.
1483419|CDR|Joe, we're about 2 minutes into the CDR's O2 charge.
1483426|CC|Thank you.
1483551|LMP|Joe, LMP has 96 percent on his gauge.
1483558|CC|Thank you, Jack. We copy that.
1483656|CC|Geno, with regard to your observation made to us a few moments ago, I guess we will ask for the CABIN RETURN to the AUTO position and your SUIT DIVERTER valve to CABIN, please. We are about 0.2 of a psi from CABIN RELIEF. Over.
1483720|CDR|Okay, we're getting that now.
1483800|CDR|Joe, CDR is reading 94 percent on the O2 charge.
1483806|CC|Thank you.
1484119|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 148 hours 41 minutes. The Change of Shift Press Conference is ready to begin at this time, we'll take down the live air-to-ground release lines, record any conversation with the crew for play back following the press conference.
1484152|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 149 hours 11 minutes. During the change of shift press briefing the major activity aboard Challenger on the lunar surface and here in mission control has been to get the spacecraft in the proper configuration for the crew to begin their eight hour sleep period. The crew reported and we confirmed through telemetry here on the ground that the spacecraft cabin pressure had come up just a little bit above what we would normally expect - normally runs around 5 pounds per square inch. And we're seeing a pressure of about 3/4 of a pound higher than that about 5.73 pounds per square inch. This is not particularly unusual. we'did see a pressure rise following rep ressurization after the first EVA where the cabin pressure came up somewhat above normal. The pressure relief valve in the cabin would operate at about 5.83 pounds per square inch. In the taped conversations with the crew that we obtained during the change of shift briefing, you'll hear some conversation about the cabin pressure and some instructions to the crew to have them looking for any sources in the cabin that might be putting extra oxygen into the cabin such as the PLSS fill valves that might not have been closed fully or something like that. At this point the cabin pressure has stabilized it looks like and we've found nothing amiss. We'll replay the tape conversation for you and then standby live.
1484447|LMP|Okay, Joe. LMP's OPS pressure is 6300.
1484453|CC|Thank you.
1484757|CDR|Commander's OPS pressure is 6100.
1484801|CC|Copy, 6100.
1484902|LMP|Say, Joe, our cabin pressure is riding even higher, now. About 5.7.
1484910|CC|We copy that.
1484914|LMP|Joe, Joe, we had the commander's hoses stowed, but in SUIT FLOW. That might have done it. is that right?
1484924|CC|Sounds very plausible, Jack. We'll look at it a little more here.
1485314|CC|Challenger, this is Houston. Requesting you move demand REGs A and B to EGRESS, please.
1485328|LMP|They're EGRESS.
1485331|CC|Okay.
1485341|CC|17, Houston. We noted down here that your SUIT DIVERTERS went to EGRESS and we want the demand REGs to the EGRESS position, please.
1485355|LMP|That's right, but the SUIT GAS DIVERTER extends when you go to EGRESS.
1485401|CC|You're right, again.
1485704|LMP|Houston, do you figure we're relieving?
1485709|CC|Jack, we don't think so. It looks like you're pretty steady at between 5.5 and 5.6. We're watching it very closely, however.
1485719|LMP|Okay, you know when we had that problem this morning, I hope I didn't - the backflow did not hurt something when I had the LMP's hoses stowed in the isol valve and SUIT FLOW.
1485743|CC|Jack, just for your information, we saw about the same thing last night. The only difference was the pressure didn't climb quite so high. So, we think whatever it is, it really doesn't involve the problem - small problem you had this morning.
1485804|LMP|Okay, Joe.
1485935|CDR|Okay, Joe. We got the commander's PLSS back in the recharge station. We got a new battery in it, odd numbers, and a new - and a new canister in it and we are working on - on Jack's right now.
1485955|CC|Okay, Gene. Sounds good.
1490244|CC|17, Houston.
1490249|LMP|Go ahead, Joe.
1490252|CC|We are still watching your cabin pressure down here. Could you check for us, please, if the PLSS fill valve is securely closed?
1490305|LMP|Yes, it was closed.
1490308|CC|Okay.
1490310|LMP|Joe, do you want me to check out the regulator?
1490344|CC|Stand by.
1490345|LMP|Houston, Challenger. Do you want me to check the - Okay. ED BATs are 37.2.
1490354|CC|Copy that.
1490358|LMP|PCM's going HIGH.
1490403|LMP|Let me know when you're ready for the battery management.
1490406|CC|Roger.
1490531|CC|17, Houston. Stand by on the battery management for a few minutes, please. And, in the meantime, could you check the low pressure PLSS fill valve, closed, please? Over.
1490548|LMP|Joe, I checked that. It's closed.
1490553|CC|Thank you.
1490558|CDR|Houston, Challenger.
1490601|CC|Go ahead.
1490605|CDR|Yes, your - does you telemetry and our gauge come off the same telemetry on that? Same transducer?
1490615|CC|That's affirm. It does. And, Challenger, we've got a communications problem at one of the sites and are going to ask you to go to panel 12 and turn the POWER AMPLIFIER to PRIMARY, please.
1490827|LMP|Okay, it's PRIMARY.
1490845|CC|And, Challenger, we're ready for battery management, at your convenience.
1490852|LMP|Okay, stand by.
1491203|CDR|Hey, Joe.
1491204|CC|Go ahead.
1491208|CDR|Okay, this is Geno. I just dug a rock out of my pocket. You - no one back there probably remembers, but when we were at Shorty, fumbling around, trying to get everything done, I said there was a piece of very shiny black glasslike-looking material that reminded me of - of obsidian. Well, it's not. It looks like a very fine-grained gray rock. But, it's a fractured piece and it looks like it - I've picked up fractures of about three or four vesicle faces on it. The vesicle faces are very shiny and that's what reflected and caught my eye. I think the unique part about it is - Jack may want to tell you something else about it - the unique part about it is - I picked it up at Shorty. Undocumented, halfway between the Rover and where we were sampling that orange stuff. And it will be in bag 12 Echo.
1491306|CC|Okay, Geno. Copy, 12 Echo. And, I was assured by the folks here when I came in - -
1491312|CDR|That'll go in it.
1491313|CC|- - that - that you did indeed have shiny sample of some kind in your pocket and would probably find it later on. So, we called that one. Could you turn OFF the POWER AMPLIFIER - -
1491326|CDR|Okay, we'll put in it in SCB-8.
1491328|CC|Okay, go ahead.
1491333|CDR|Okay, it's off and we will put that rock in that sample bag and put in SCB-8.
1491339|LMP|Joe, this - rock looks very much like 12008, 12008. It's a fine-grained, coarsely - very coarsely vesicular gray rock - probably basaltic.
1491357|CC|Okay, Jack. Real fine. We'll - want LOW BIT RATE, POWER AMPLIFIER, OFF, and LOW BIT RATE and we can maybe label that one 17008. How does that sound?
1491413|CDR|No, you got to label Gene-rock. I was going to tell you those other things, but I thought I'd let Jack.
1491419|CC|Okay, thank you.
1491425|LMP|The vesicles, if I may project the size of them, probably were up to 4 or 5 centimeters in diameter. They're irregular in shape, but they're clearly vesicles and it looks like they are lined with either glass or very fine-grained crystals. They're very shiny.
1491447|CC|Roger.
1491452|CDR|And for our next act -
1491455|CC|Jack, we're going to ask for your next act that you check for us both PLSS valves OFF and both OPS valves OFF. Over.
1491651|LMP|Joe, they're both verified OFF.
1491657|CC|Okay, Jack. We understand that all four valves are verified OFF.
1491705|LMP|That's affirm, Joe.
1491710|CC|Okay, thank you. I'm sure that you realize that we're still showing that pressure increasing very, very slowly and are pretty well convinced that nothing is leaking in from the outside. So, we are looking around on the inside here.
1491728|CDR|Joe, is our oxygen consumption abnormal at this point?
1491733|CC|No, not al all, Geno. Everything looks pretty normal, except this - this slow creep in the cabin pressure.
1491744|LMP|Well, the - I guess the possibility is a creeping REG or a transducer, is that right?
1491750|CC|Yes, either that or it may be we're just watching some of the effects of the thermal shock that your tanks took when - from the repress itself. We're not worried about it at all, but we are still watching it.
1491808|LMP|Joe, you might make a note that my two SEP area samples went into bag 8 also.
1491819|CC|Roger, Jack. That's noted.
1491823|CDR|Joe, got seme numbers, if you'd like them?
1491827|CC|Go ahead.
1491832|CDR|SRC is 41.5. Bag 6 is 24, bag 8 is 35.
1491842|CC|Copy, 41.5 and 24 in bag 6; 35 for bag 8.
1491852|CDR|That's it.
1491855|CDR|Joe, how many samples did we get today?
1491857|CC|Stand by.
1491902|CDR|Don't start a big investigation. I was just curious.
1491908|CC|Let me ask around, Gene. We will see in a minute.
1491914|CC|17, we think you have 54 samples from this EVA, plus some cores.
1491925|CDR|Thank you, Joe. Just curious.
1491929|CC|That's not half bad.
1492156|CDR|And, Joe, we're on 5-5 and I am going to start doffing.
1492203|CC|Okay, Geno. Copy 5-5, and before you get started there, would you put both demand REGs to CLOSED, please? As we continue to watch this pressure.
1492217|CDR|Okay, Joe. Demand REG A, going CLOSED. Demand REG B going CLOSED.
1492229|CC|Thank you. And we verify them both CLOSED.
1492521|PAO|This is Apollo Control, that completes our tape playback. We're standing by live now. And the LM Cabin pressure reading at this time 5.77 pounds per square inch. There's no particular concern over the higher than normal cabin pressure. However, it is something we don't understand at the present time. Now, there are a limited number of sources of oxygen that can be getting into the cabin to raise the pressure. And, as Joe Allen mentioned to the crew, there's not much chance that anything is leaking in from the outside. We've been systematically checking 1 by 1 the potential sources of the oxygen flow into the cabin. And at some point, if all of the potential sources are eliminated, we begin to reach the conclusion that perhaps the sensor is at fault. However, at this point, it's not possible to say what the - what the cause of the slightly higher than normal LM cabin and pressure is.
1492754|CC|17, this is Houston. We'd like SUIT DIVERTER back to CABIN, please?
1492806|CDR|CABIN.
1492810|CC|Okay.
1493147|CC|Gene and Jack, you'll be interested to hear that the cabin PRES is dropping down, very slowly now. So, we think we have a tiny leak in one of the cabin regulators, one of the demand regulators, and we'll run a check after you get squared away there a little better.
1493216|CDR|Okay, Joe. We'll be at your beck and call.
1493227|CC|I'll only smile at that.
1493329|PAO|The demand regulators, which Joe Allen was describing to the crew and suggesting that they might be the source of the small oxygen leak into the cabin, are used to control the flow of oxygen from the storage tanks in the lunar module to the cabin. The procedure that we're going to follow here is to let the cabin pressure continue to drop. It's come down from 5. - from a high of 5.81 pounds per square inch to 5.73 and we're going to let it get down a little closer to 5 pounds and then run some checks to determine which of the two regulators is leaking. The procedure after this was determined - after this is determined would be to simply use the good regulator and turn off the regulator which has the small leak.
1494754|CDR|Houston, Challenger.
1494757|CC|Go ahead.
1494802|CDR|Joe, we're going to air out the suits. We're going to go to SUIT FLOW on the Commander's ISOL valve now.
1494813|CC|All righty.
1494819|CDR|Say again.
1494824|CC|That sounds good.
1494926|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The crew aboard Challenger, Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt, running about 2 hours behind in their presleep preparations at this time. And, we do expect to give them a full 8 hour rest period, which would mean that we will have a slip in the start of EVA 3, probably somewhere between an hour and 2 hours. We won't be able to pin that exact start time down until sometime after the crew has gotten to sleep, and we see how their sleep period is working out, but again 1 to 2 hours delay in the start of EVA 3 looks likely at this time.
1495704|LMP|Joe, I guess you guys are tired of looking at ny heart beat. So, I'm gonna turn the BIOMED off as I get out of my suit.
1495714|CC|Okay, Jack.
1495752|CDR|Hey, Joe. This is Geno. How do you read me?
1495754|CC|Geno, you're 5 by.
1495759|CDR|Okay, we're going to get Jack out of his suit. I'll be - I'll be monitoring.
1495807|CC|Roger. From the way the two of you worked today, I'd think you could just about turn him upside down and pour him out.
1495834|CDR|Yes, if he'd fit through that little hole in the end of his wrist.
1495845|LMP|Joe, the day they can pour me out of anything, they'll call me slim. Talk to you later.
1495853|CC|Okay. Among other things.
1495859|CDR|Remember those nice white suits?
1495910|CC|The Clean Room will never be the same again.
1495917|CDR|You'd never believe it.
1501836|CC|Challenger, this is Houston.
1501842|CDR|Go ahead, Houston. Challenger here.
1501844|CC|Geno, we're going to start to investigate which of your demand regulators is leaking and we're going to ask you to put DEMAND REG Alfa to CABIN now. And, as we watch, it, please do not make any urine dumps. Over.
1501904|CDR|Okay, we will not make any urine dumps and we'll go to CABIN now. Okay, Alfa's in CABIN. And we'll be ready for your debriefing here in about 5 minutes.
1501924|CC|Okay, Geno. And, it's going to be a short one.
1502023|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 150 hours 20 minutes. We're looking at a LM cabin pressure now of between 5.61 and 5.65 and you heard CAPCOM, Joe Allen, instruct the crew to turn back on one of the cabin oxygen regulators which supplies O2 to the cabin from the storage tanks. REG A is the one that's online right now. We'll watch the cabin pressure and see if it begins to rise again, and if so, we would conclude that Regulator A has a small leak. However, if nothing happens we'll then turn Regulator A off and turn REG - Regulator B on, and watch it to see if the cabin pressure begin to go up with that regulator. The LM Environmental Systems Officer made one point to Flight Director, Gene Kranz, and that is that very very small amounts of additional gas in the cabin will show up in our telemetry readings. Now, we're talking ab out tenths to hundreths of a pound per square inch of pressure and there are a number of possible things at the end of an EVA that could contribute to this kind of a pressure rise, such things as moisture in the suits when the suits are removed, evaporating carbon dioxoide, or the temperature rise - small temperature rises in the cabin due to the heat stored in the rocks brought in. All of these things could have contributed to causing the pressure rise that we saw and it may well turn out that neither of the regulators has any problem. In the event that there is a small leak in one of the two regulators the Lunar Module functions perfectly well, the cabin atmosphere would be maintained perfectly well with one regulator and the procedure would be to simply shut down the regulator that was leaking. It, of course, could be brought back online if needed and would perform it's function. And it still appears that we are approximately 2 hours behind in getting the crew ready for their sleep period. We have a clock in the control center counting down to our best estimate at this time as to when the sleep period will begin and it now shows 2 hours 36 minutes.
1502718|LMP|Okay, Houston. We're going DOWNVOICE BACKUP.
1502723|CC|Stand by on that.
1502730|LMP|And okay, we are ready for your EVA-2 debriefing.
1502749|CC|Okay, 17. To begin with, we want you to delete that step going to DOWNVOICE BACKUP. And I've got a surface block data to read up to you. A few minor changes in your Lunar Surface Checklist. And a couple of very quick questions for the debriefing when you're ready. Over.
1502818|LMP|Go ahead, in the stated order.
1502825|CC|Roger. Moving right along now to the surface block data. Lift-off times, T-33, 152 plus 30 plus 01; T-34, 154 plus 28 plus 33; T-35, 156 plus 27 plus 05; T-36, 158 plus 25 plus 37; T-37, 160 plus 24 plus 09. Over.
1502928|LMP|Okay, Joe. Starting with 33: 152:30:01, 154:28:33, 156:27:05, 158:25:37, 160:24:09. And what's our present rev?
1502954|CC|Rev 32, Jack.
1503008|CDR|Hey, Joe, for pantry purposes, what day is this?
1503020|CC|We've checked around the room here and the consensus is that it's Wednesday morning. Over.
1503032|CDR|Oh, okay. I really wanted to know whether it was irridated [sic] ham or frankfurter morning, and I guess we can work that out.
1503055|CC|Roger, Gene. Apparently, the Surgeon is happy with either of those days. And we want you to turn to - right now, to 5-7 in the checklist and perform that - one particular step at 150 hours, which will prevent the computer clock from overflowing. And that's the "PROCEED, VERB 37 ENTER, 06 ENTER, PROCEED" step. We'll stand by for that. Give us a mark as you start it. Over.
1503135|CDR|Okay, we're starting.
1503137|CDR|PRO. PROCEED, VERB 37 ENTER - VERB 30 -
1503201|CDR|Okay, Joe. You don't want me to go on the VERB 90 - You're not going to give us an update, huh?
1503208|CC|No update required. That was just to prevent an overflow. And then I'm ready for the quick changes in the Lunar Surface Checklist when you are.
1503246|LMP|Okay, Joe, go ahead.
1503252|CC|Okay. Begin by putting the demand REG Bravo to CABIN position and leave the demand REG Alfa in the - in the CABIN position where it now is. And I'll continue on with the changes in the checklist here. Page 5-6, left-hand side, where it reads "Configure ETB." The - the fourth line down that starts out "Four B&W mags," they should read, "Hotel, India, Juliet, and Romeo in LCG compartment." Then going up to the right-hand side under "Stow in ETB," change the line "One B&W mag Romeo" to read "One B&W mag Kilo." Over.
1503419|LMP|Okay, Joe. I changed the mags in the "Empty" from Kilo to Romeo and the mag in "Stow" from Romeo to Kilo.
1503434|CC|Okay, that sounds like the thing to do. And a note on your demand regulators. We're showing that the demand regulator Alfa is - has good integrity and we're now in the process of checking the demand regulator Bravo. I've got a couple of fairly quick questions here when you're ready for those.
1503458|CDR|Okay, Joe. Go ahead with your questions, and integrity is certainly what we need around here, right?
1503515|CC|Okay. Jack, a question for you to begin with. Is your gold visor sticking halfway down? Apparently, that's based on a discussion earlier. Over.
1503541|CDR|Yes. Apparently his visor is sticking.
1503543|CDR|Which one? The gold visor? No, he said his sunshade is sticking halfway down, but his gold visor's not.
1503551|CC|Okay, that answers the question. We couldn't tell from the TV whether it was the visor or the sunshade. That's fine. We also heard some discussion about possible wear in the seats of the suits when you were dusting each other off. We want to know if you could see the - any hint of the aluminum layers showing through in the suits. Over.
1503617|CDR|No, Joe. Not to worry. It's just a few scars on the PLSS thermal blanket in back where you probably rub the seat when you get in. Nothing on the suits.
1503628|CC|Okay, Geno. Now two real quick geology questions that will help us do the planning for your EVA tomorrow. The first one has to do with Station 4. And you called out some material on the rim there -the crater at Station 4 - which looked like bedded spatter. And we're wondering if that resembled things that - that you'd seen in Hawaii? Over.
1503704|LMP|Hey, Joe, I think they misheard. I think I may have said shattered and you might of said - thought spattered. No, I didn't - neither one of us intended to leave that impression. The rock - the big rock we sampled was - looked like shattered - intensely shattered gabbro, such as we've had around the LM. The rocks, probably more significantly, that Gene - one of which Gene picked up was a fine-grained vesicular basalt - corsely vesicular basalts. And we didn't have any time to really examine the interrelationships of those rock types there, but those were the two fragment types we saw.
1503750|CC|Okay, Jack. That's quite clear to us now. Also a question about Station 4 - -
1503757|LMP|Joe - Joe.
1503758|CC|Okay, go ahead.
1503805|LMP|The bottom of that crater, now, had material that was extremely disorganized in its aspect and, really, we didn't have time to examine it in detail in order to decide why it was disorganized. It did not necessarily look like the boulder that we sampled at the rim.
1503836|CC|Okay, Jack. Understand that. A question about the boulder you sampled at the rim. Would you compare the basalt in this boulder to - which I - which you may have called a gabbro, I'm not sure - in any case the basalt - to samples which you collected at Camelot and at ALSEP. Over.
1503903|LMP|Well, ny impression was that they were the same rock types.
1503907|CC|Okay, that's our impression, too. Thank you. That's - that's it for us on the questions. And for information, we're showing your cabin pressure is holding fairly steady even with both those demand regs on.
1503928|CDR|Okay. Keep watching it for us, would you, and let us know. I expect one of them is probably leaking pretty slow.
1503935|CC|You have no - no worry about that, Gene. We're looking at it real close.
1503945|CDR|How's - how's America looking to you?
1503949|CC|It is just as clean as a whistle.
1504001|CDR|It may not be when we get back there, judging from the looks - looks of us. That's good to hear, though. It's a good bird. So is this one.
1504023|LMP|Joe, is there any - You got any more debriefing questions?
1504028|CC|Negative, Jack. And we're interested that you move right along so we can get you - get you turned in there and get some rest.
1504039|LMP|We're moving. We're eating now, and we're - we're - we feel the same way, I think.
1504112|CC|Troops, enjoy your meal there. And at your convenience, you can go ahead with the feedwater recharge. We want you to hold off on the oxygen recharge until we watch these regs for about another 10 minutes. And give us a mark if you do start the water recharge, please. Over.
1504136|CDR|Okay.
1504146|CC|And if there are any ways we can cut corners on the time here, it'll be helping us, because we're still looking at - at being down a couple of hours nearly.
1504202|CDR|Okay, Joe. We're working at it as fast as we can. Best place in the world to make it up is tomorrow night.
1504220|CC|Right, Geno, and we - actually, we're going to pick up a good one shortly, because we're coming up to a pad in the time line. So, as long as we don't waste too much time, we're doing pretty well.
1504235|CDR|Okay; be assured we're not. There's just a certain amount of housekeeping we have to do. But, very seriously, day after tomorrow is a very short day, and I think we ought to look at making up any time. I'm a hold-faster on sleep periods but tomorrow is the one that I think is flexible.
1504257|CC|Roger. We hear you.
1504612|LMP|Hey, Joe. This is Jack. We're eating here. Won't be too long at it, but if you've got any significant news or anything, why don't you give it to us?
1504647|CC|Jack, I don't know if it's significant news, but at least I know you will be interested. Both your demand regs look good now. We show no evidence of a leak there and it may have been that just recycling them reseated them and solved whatever problem we had. You can go ahead with the O2 recharge on the PLSS and the water recharge at your convenience. And let me poll the room here for other news items. Over.
1504821|CDR|Okay, Joe, we're starting an O2 charge of the CDR's PLSS, 10 minutes.
1504827|CC|Okay.
1505330|CC|Challenger, this is Houston.
1505337|LMP|Go ahead, Joe.
1505342|CC|Roger. This is a news report to eat by. I'll combine an orbital science report with a sports report, an unusual combination here. I'll start out with a sports report on Monday night football, which you may not have heard yet. Joe Namath tried mightily to lead the New York Jets into the American Football League playoffs, but the Oakland Raiders grounded the Jets in a fourth quarter 24 to 16 blitz. Namath passed for more than 400 yards but, in spite of it, New York scored only one touchdown. Moving along to the successes of Captain America, I'll run down different items in the SIM bay here, beginning with the UV spectrometer. In general, the data has been excellent. We're getting indications that the hydrogen atmosphere of the Moon is much less than expected. In fact, I don't think we're detecting any, but rather setting a limit on the amount of hydrogen around the Moon. There was an Aerobee launch - or an attempt at an Aerobee launch - from White Sands on Monday to calibrate solar UV radiation, but this launch failed because an instrument viewing port in the rocket failed to open. A second launch - let's see - was scheduled, I think, for today, and I don't know whether that was successful or not, I guess it'll be launched later today. The infrared scanning radiometer is performing beautifully. Indications are that subsolar-point surface temperatures are higher than we've detected from our Earth-based observations before. We're seeing many thermal anomolies, particularly in Procellarum and in the Procellarum area west of Copernicus. And we're seeing also a few unusual cold spots, which apparently are indicating areas of very fine soil with a few or no blocks in and on the soil. The lunar sounder data is beautiful, and the power monitor signals we find correlate with the surface features. And the HF data indicates to us that we are detecting a variety of layers in the mare areas.
1505653|LMP|Joe, this is Jack. Do you know where specifically they're seeing the hot spots west of Copernicus?
1505704|CC|Jack, I don't have it on the page in front of me here. We're going to check into it and I'll get back to you in a second.
1505845|CC|Jack, this is Houston. With regard to your questions on the hot spots, apparently they've not yet indexed the - these warmer sources that they're detecting to the CSM ephemeris, and - and so they don't know exactly what they correspond to as far as the surface features themselves go. So I can't help you on that right now.
1505918|LMP|Okay, Joe. Just curious.
1510105|CC|And, Jack, TELMU handed me some numbers which I think you will be interested in. From the EVA-2 EMU summary, the elapsed EVA time was 7 hours plus 37 minutes plus 22 seconds for a new outdoor record under international rules. The rest of the sheet looks free from problems in a comforting way. Let's see, average metabolic rates - for you, Geno, 855; and, Jack, you're running at around 920, And that, relative to premission averages of around 850. And you have a grand total EVA time now of 14 hours 49 minutes and 35 seconds.
1510220|LMP|Very interesting numbers, Joe. Do you have any idea how the metabolic rate compared to yesterday?
1510227|CC|Good question. Let me ask on that one. Yesterday you were running at 1045 and 1090. So you're down considerably from your work rates of yesterday, which is good news. Maybe you're learning how to do it more easily or something like that.
1510300|CDR|Yes, but we spent a lot of time riding today and a lot of time working yesterday.
1510305|CC|That's true. But I guess that's not taken into consideration of the average here. It's certainly true. We can ask for the metabolic rate of the Rover. I bet that is pretty impressive for today.
1510320|CDR|Well, don't - don't get me wrong. Driving that Rover is ... But I'll tell you, it keeps your attention.
1510331|CC|I'm sure it does.
1510332|LMP|It keeps the passenger's attention, too.
1510335|CC|I'm sure it does. We noted some comments when you were rolling along today - and reading between the lines from time to time.
1510359|CDR|Actually, Joe, for good long spans on the run up to Station 2, except when we had to pick our way up the Hole-in-the-Wall, I was running full bore at anywheres from, I guess, what'd I say, 10 to 12 to 15 clicks. I didn't hit 15 going up very much.. Coming down I did, but it's - it's really a "stand by for turn and watch where you're going" type of run. Because the small craters, - of course, are the ones that can really jolt you. But the trouble is, you can't - you can never see what's just over the next ridge, and the next ridge may be 20 meters away, and you just can't see it until you're there, and you don't know whether its a dish crater or pit crater.
1510457|CC|Roger, Gene. We copy that.
1510501|LMP|Joe, that des -
1510502|CC|Go ahead.
1510505|LMP|That description - that description fits the geology up in there, because we weren't seeing blocky rimmed craters and otherwise you would have been able to tell more easily about the old versus new craters, which would be the ones you could either go through or not go through, respectively.
1510525|CC|Roger.
1510535|CDR|That's a super machine to drive though, Joe, I'll tell you. If you had enough time you could really learn to - to take it all the way. But you don't really do that, just the second time around.
1510554|CC|Geno, was it spraying dirt at you today? Could you - did you notice that you still missed the real fender and that the patch fender wasn't quite doing what - what maybe it could?
1510611|CDR|No, sir, I don't think we missed it at all.
1510617|LMP|Fact is, we're recommending a design change, Joe.
1510627|CC|That'll be for next year's models.
1510633|CDR|That's right.
1511021|LMP|Hey, Joe. is it all right to use the waste management system?
1511028|CC|Roger. We're happy with those demand regs now. And you can proceed on with that and including all the - the - the PLSS recharges that you'll need to do as well.
1511323|LMP|Joe, we're filling my PLSS with water now. You might check on the water quantity.
1511330|CC|Roger. Thank you.
1512312|CDR|Joe, that should take care of my PLSS for tonight.
1512318|CC|Okay, Gene. Thank you. Out of curiosity, have you packed, or are you packing the ETB now?
1512328|CDR|Yes. Jack's doing it right now.
1512330|CC|Okay; we've got a last minute change. We show that you - your mag Bravo is at about 77 frames, and we'd like for you to leave it in the ETB - it is already in the ETB - and take it out with you tomorrow. We can shoot up the remaining frames if we run out of film, otherwise.
1512356|CDR|Okay; fine. That goes along with our thinking.
1512428|CC|Geno, apparently you made some comment earlier in the day about being bothered by comm noise during your egress from Challenger. Did that go away right away, or did it just cease to bother you, or what - what was the story on that?
1512450|CDR|I don't remember; so, it must have gone away, because the comm was great.
1512457|CC|Okay; that's what we kind of assumed.
1512524|CDR|Okay; we're charging Jack's PLSS with oxygen.
1512534|CC|Sounds good.
1513944|CDR|Houston, Challenger. The O2 is complete on - O2 FILL is complete on the LMPs PLSS, and we're working on the water.
1513957|CC|Roger.
1514219|CC|Challenger, for your information, we're coming up on comm handover in about a minute and a half.
1514231|CDR|Okay.
1514610|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 151 hours 46 minutes. Jack Schmitt and Gene Cernan appear to be completing the last few items on their checklist before getting to sleep. We hope to get them to bed within an hour or maybe even a bit less, which would put them about an hour behind the nominal flight plan. Ron Evans aboard America is now in his 33rd revolution of the Moon. That spacecraft currently in an orbit 69.3 by 53.6 nautical miles. Evans began an 8 hour sleep period at 146 hours 40 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, which is right on the flight plan. And he's scheduled to end that sleep period at 154 hours 40 minutes. The pan camera - mapping camera, and laser altimeter in the CSM scientific instrument module bay, have been turned off. The infrared scanning radiometer - the ulraviolet spectrometer are both in the operating mode during the sleep period. And data indicates nominal performance for both.
1514733|CDR|Hello, Houston; Challenger. The LMPs PLSS is charged.
1514739|CC|We copy it.
1514756|CDR|Joe, how's the weather got down there? Any better?
1514801|CC|Geno, the weather is better. We were really socked in yesterday. That front's moved on through the Houston area, and it is cold and clear tonight, I suspect. It's been a while since we've been out, but they are calling for it to go down right near freezing.
1514828|CDR|Okay. Thank you.
1521612|LMP|Hey, Joe; Challenger.
1521617|CC|Go ahead.
1521623|LMP|They succeeded in leveling the gravimeter, yet?
1521633|CC|Jack, we'll check it, update our information on that, my understanding at the moment is that they've not, but - but they're thinking that the unit's just too cold and they're in the process of warming it up by dumping heat into it by running some of the equipment around it and in it, and they've by no means given up - given up hope for that unit.
1521704|LMP|I figure that means that my fooling around with it didn't help them.
1521709|CC|Apparently, it - it didn't do too much for them, but what it did do was convince them that it's probably somehow locked up because its temperature's not right yet. And they're not worrying about whether it's level or not level now. They're - they're confident that it's been set up okay, and now they're just biding their time to bring that temperature up. We'll get some more words to you sometime tomorrow on it as you make your traditional visit to the site again - ALSEP site again, probably. How are you coming along with your sleep prep?
1521747|CDR|We're just about there, Joe. We picked up some time somewhere in here. Couldn't be much more than 1 hour behind.
1521758|CC|No, that's just about right. You're looking pretty good on that.
1521804|CC|If you get to sleep in the next 5 minutes, you're 1 hour behind.
1521811|CDR|Yes, sir; we're - I'm putting ny hammock up now, as a matter of fact.
1521818|LMP|What are you doing up so late?
1521825|CC|Well, somebody's got to sit up and keep you guys honest. I think we're getting more sleep down here than you are.
1521847|CDR|... bother me.
1521849|CC|I might add that not only do we have to stay up late; we have to get up mighty early to keep you honest, too.
1521900|LMP|Okay; you going to let us sleep 8 hours or what?
1521905|CC|That's affirm, Jack. We're - we're looking good on the time, and we're - Not only will you get, we hope, 8 hours of good sleep, but you'll have a full EVA tomorrow. So, it's not costing us anything there.
1521925|LMP|Sounds great, Joe. I - I fully expect it won't be much longer now.
1521951|CC|And, Gene, just for rough planning purposes, we'll start to figure your sleep period starting around 152:30. And We'll be looking at your getting up around 8 hours from that time.
1522014|CDR|Okay, Joe; I'll buy that.
1522023|CC|Might add, also, that there are a lot of us looking forward to that third EVA tomorrow. It's going to be the last one on the lunar surface for some time.
1522040|CDR|I tell you, if it's anywhere near what the first two were like, we're looking forward to it, also.
1522103|CC|Gene and Jack, we're still marveling at the beautiful television pictures that we're getting from your TV camera there. It's fun, in fact, to watch the - the tracks that you're leaving behind in - in the - the lunar soil, both footprints and Rover tracks. And some of us are down here now reflecting on what sort of mark or track will someday disturb the tracks that you leave behind there tomorrow.
1522143|CDR|That's an interesting thought, Joe, but I think we all know that somewhere, someday, someone will be here to disturb those tracks.
1522156|CC|No doubt about it, Geno.
1522157|LMP|Don't be too pessimistic, Joe. I think it's going to happen.
1522203|CC|Oh, there's no doubt about that. But it's fun to think about what sort of - of device will ultimately disturb your tracks.
1522217|LMP|Well that device may look something like your little boy.
1522223|CC|Boy, he'd make short work of them.
1522236|LMP|Joe, I'll tell you it's also a pretty philosophical thought to think that you're riding around out here on what is really undisturbed - undisturbed everything, you know. If there was someone here, way back when sometime, they didn't leave much - much sign of their whereabouts, but that's an interesting thought, too, as you drive around and all of a sudden cross your own Rover tracks and figure out those are the only ones that have maybe ever been here.
1522311|CC|Very true.
1522313|LMP|And with that, I'm rolling out my hammock.
1522414|LMP|Okay, Joe. I'm waving goodnight to you. I'm rolling up my overhead window cover.
1522428|CC|Okay, Gene and Jack. We'll say good night to you from down here, unless there's some other way can help you.
1522443|LMP|No, sir. If there is, we'll give you a call, though.
1522456|CC|Just want to end by saying what a terrific job you did today, and really looking forward to tomorrow. Have a good 8-hours rest.
1522510|LMP|Thank you, Joe. Tomorrow we answer all the unanswered questions. Right?
1522520|CC|If not more.
1522606|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 152 hours 26 minutes. The goodnights with the crew aboard Challenger were exchanged at 152 hours 25 minutes, and we plan to give them a full 8 hour sleep period which puts wakeup at 160 hours 25 minutes. That presumably would move the start time for the EVA 3 back 1 hour. We'll be getting conformation on that shortly. And both the CSM and the Lunar Module continuing to perform almost perfectly as planned. Based on the telemetry that we're getting here on the ground and at this moment our large scribing plotter display in front of mission control, shows the Command Module, America, to be passing almost directly over Challenger on the lunar surface in the Valley of Taurus Mountains. America now on its 33 revolution of the Moon. And Ron Evans well into his scheduled 8 hour sleep period. Evans is right on the planned time for sleep. Sleeping right on the - on the flight plan times. During the sleep period we'll have the air-to-ground lines down. Normally that circuit gets rather noisy after the crew has gone to sleep - configured the lunar module to sleep. The power amplifier is turned off, the transmitter output power of the Lunar Module decreased from about 18 watts down to about 1 watt and that accounts for the noise that we frequently have on that circuit during sleep periods. For that reason, we will have the circuit down configured to record any conversations with the crew for subsequent playback. At 152 hours 29 minutes, this is Apollo Control Houston.
1522616|LMP|...
1532708|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 153 hours 27 minutes. We have heard nothing from the crew aboard Challenger on the lunar surface, Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt, for the past hour since we said goodnight to them. And we now have a little less than 7 hours until their scheduled wakeup time. We plan to wake them up at a GET time of 160 hours 25 minutes which would be 8 hours after we said goodnight to them. Ron Evans aboard the Command Module, America, is about to begin his 34th revolution of the Moon, and on this revolution we'll be sending Ron a wakeup call. Wakeup for him is 154:40, 154 hours 40 minutes. It'll be about 35 minutes before we regain radio contact with the CSM as it comes back around the eastern limb of the Moon on its 34th revolution. Both vehicles continuing in very good shape. One minor problem appeared to crop up with the Lunar Module following the repressurization after the 2nd EVA. The cabin pressure went up to about 5.8 pounds per square inch. This is about 8 tenths of a pound above what we think of as the normal LM cabin pressure. However, it is not unusual to see the cabin pressure spike up a bit on repressurization and then drop back down. However, this rise was getting fairly close to the pressure of which the cabin relief valves would open and relieve the pressure. One consideration when the pressure goes up in this manner is that perhaps one of the several sources of oxygen in the LM cabin might be leaking. Such things as the portable life support system fill valves or the portable life support system itself, or one of the oxygen purge systems, or even the the main regulator valves that control the flow of oxygen from the LM supply tanks in the cabin. After isolating these possible sources one at a time, and still watching the pressure rise gradually, we elected to shut down both of the oxygen regulator valves and see what happened to the pressure, keeping a flow of oxygen through the cabin to remove carbon dioxide buildup, and on shutting down both regulators, the pressure did, in fact, begin to drop. The assumption at that time was that possibly one of the regulators was leaking slightly, allowing a small amount of oxygen above the needs of the crew and for replenishment, to flow into the cabin. And as the pressure dropped back down, we brought one regulator at a time online. However, the pressure continued to fall back to its normal level of about 5 pounds per square inch even with both regulators on. So, at this point, the assumption is that nothing is the matter. There are a couple of possible explanations for the rise in cabin pressure. One is - one explanation is that one of the regulators was, in fact, leaking, and when they were recycled and reseated, the seal held properly and the regulators are now performing properly. The other possibility is that moisture from the suit circuits - the temperature rise caused by bringing things from outside the LM into the lunar cabin - rocks and other equipment that had been exposed to the Sun on the lunar surface - causing an increase in water vapor, carbon dioxide, and the slight rise in the cabin temperature, which would, in turn, bump the pressure up. Those are probably the most likely possibilities. In any event, the situation as it now stands is that the LM cabin's pressure is at 4.9 pounds per square inch, which is within the normal range, and there's no indication of any leakage either through the regulators or through the other sources of oxygen. It appears that everything is functioning normally. During this shift in Mission Control, Flight Director, Gene Kranz has his flight control team reviewing the situation for liftoff. This team of flight controllers will be in charge of the lunar liftoff, and they are considering such things as the ideal time to conduct the plane change maneuver with the Command Module, to put it in the proper orbit for subsequent rendezvous with the lunar module; also, looking at LM weights and performance characteristics, assuring that all that data is in proper form for the liftoff which we expect will occur at the flight plan time. EVA 3 will be, it looks like now, delayed 1 hour from the published flight plan time. This reflects the late sleep time for the crew, the fact that they began their rest period one hour late. And we expect this will translate to a one hour late start for EVA 3, and the EVA is planned for a full 7 hours duration. At 153 hours 33 minutes, this is Apollo Control Houston.
1543509|PAO|This is Apolio Control at 154 hours, 35 minutes. We're about 5 minutes away from putting in a call to Ron Evans aboard Amarlca, now on its 34th revolution of the Moon. Ron, completing an 8 hour sleep period, and flight surgeon reports he has been sleeping soundly during virtually all of that sleep period. And Ron Evans, right on the Flight Plan. The command module performing very well. During the sleep period, the pan camera, the mapping camera, and the laser altimeter back in the scientific instrument module bay have been turned off. We have been gathering data from the infrared scanning radiometer and the ultra violet spectrometer. And the telemetry data that we have received indicates that they're performing normally. For Ron Evans - or for rather for Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt aboard the Lunar Module Challenger, they now have about 5 hours 53 minute remaining in a scheduled 8 hour sleep period, and the surgeon reports that Gene Cernan who is wearing the biomedical sensors during sleep period is sleeping soundly at this time, so the lunar module crew also appears to be getting well into their rest period. We show America in an orbit at the present time with a high point or apocynthion of 69-1/2 nautical miles and a low point or pericynthlon of 53.4. No signs of activity, aboard the Command Module at this point. We'll stand by for the wake up call to Ron Evans.
1544023|CC|Good morning America, how are you?
1544117|CMP|Hey, Houston. This is the Command Module Pilot of the United States spaceship America, and we're ready to participate in another day's activity.
1544128|CC|Glad to hear it, Ron. Good morning.
1544133|CMP|Good morning.
1544152|CMP|I slept with my lightweight headset on last night so didn't have to have that cap on. Is the fidelity of this thing any good, at all?
1544202|CC|Pretty good, Ron. Pretty good. And as you start your morning's activities, you can be aware that we were watching the spacecraft through the night, and as Flight puts it, everything is swinging.
1544221|CMP|Outstanding. That's what we like.
1544626|CMP|Hey, it's still dark outside.
1544635|CC|We start work early around here.
1544641|CMP|Well, I guess.
1545234|CMP|Hey, Houston; America.
1545239|CC|Go ahead.
1545244|CMP|Joe, I'd just be kind of curious how the old heart rate compares to those sleep tests that we did - preflight? Is it about the same when I'm soundly asleep or is it lower or what, you know?
1545304|CC|Stand by, Ron, and I'll ask the men on my left.
1545311|CMP|Okay. You know, maybe they'll have that information.
1545314|CC|Roger. They think maybe 5 minutes. And we'll be back to you.
1545321|CMP|Okay. No problem. Curiosity more than anything.
1545408|CMP|I didn't get quite as much sleep last night. I took a bath and changed my underwear, and all those good ... things, you know. Probably only got - oh, maybe 7 hours at the most. Probably closer to 6-1/2 of good sleep.
1545430|CC|Roger.
1545435|CMP|And I'll give you the rest of that in just a jiffy when I get it squared away.
1545439|CC|Okay.
1545821|CC|America, this is Houston.
1545826|CMP|Go ahead.
1545830|CC|Roger, Ron. Apparently in your preflight database, they show you with a rate of in the low 60s or high 50s, that's a sleeping rate. And we're showing you now, during your sleep periods, of heart rates of about 10 beats lower per minute. And with heart rates that show less variation than the preflight data shows.
1545911|CMP|Ah ha, okay. Well, thank you much. The heart does slow down a little bit up here, then.
1545917|CC|Apparently so - they assured me however, that it would not be approaching zero. So you can relax there.
1545927|CMP|(Laughter) Okay.
1545938|CC|And, Ron, in the meantime, Gordo's arrived here and - I'll turn the console over to him. Be talking to you later perhaps.
1545951|CMP|Okay, Joe. Hey, we thank you much. Appreciate it.
1545954|CC|Enjoyed it. Have a good day; and we'll all be watching you close.
1545959|CMP|Okay.
1550113|CMP|Okay, Houston; America. Here's my medical log.
1550120|CC|Okay, Ron. Good morning and go ahead.
1550122|CMP|I just noticed ... day off (laughter). Okay, Gordo. Glad to have you aboard with us. Okay. PRD, 15041; and the sleep, I mentioned, probably about 6-1/2 or 7 good hours. I took a Seconal last night, and I had four cans of fluid.
1550152|CC|Okay.
1550213|CMP|Okay, here's the old chow for day 6.
1550219|CC|Okay.
1550222|CMP|Scrambled eggs, bacon squares, peaches, cinnamon toasted bread cubes, orange juice, cocoa with potassium, and a vitamin pill. Okay. Lobster bisque, all the peanut butter, all the jelly, three pieces of bread, citrus beverage, a tea, a chocolate bar, and a package of pecans. And I had a beef steak, butterscotch pudding, and an orange drink.
1550317|CC|Okay, got that.
1550318|CMP|I think that was it. Hey, today I get sausage, grits, fruit coctail, orange beverage, and coffee.
1550344|CC|Roger.
1550410|CMP|And, Gordo, if you have one of these preflight, not preflight - but, what do you call it -geology summarys of EVA-2, like you had yesterday. I thought that was great.
1550424|CC|Okay, Ron. I just picked it up. Let me read it over and then I'll give you a summary.
1550432|CMP|Oh, okay. Sure; no problem.
1550840|CC|Hello, Ron. I'll give you a little summary here of the EVA. It's going to be a little rambling, because I haven't had time to organize it, but it was a very interesting night last night on that second EVA.
1550855|CMP|Sure. No problem. Go ahead.
1550858|CC|Traverse lay over terrain of extraordinary geologic diversity and yielded a far greater variety of information than ever obtained on any other lunar traverse. Systematic descriptions and samples of four of the six main units of the area, massifs, subfloor, the light mantle, and the dark mantle were obtained. In addition, detailed descriptions were given of a variety of craters, including exciting discoveries that the crater Shorty, and descriptions of the Lee-Lincoln Scarp and lineaments in the hilly terrain. The South Massif is composed of two main varieties of breccia; blue-gray and tan-gray blocks of both varieties were abundant at station 2 up on Nansen. I won't go into the geologic details on those breccias. But, they then found samples of the subfloor unit exposed as blocks in the ejecta around larger craters that had been partly buried by the dark mantle. Stand by.
1551016|CC|Okay. They are going to take the antenna away from us, Ron. I'll have to finish this next time around. Spacecraft's looking good, we'll see you in about 45 minutes or so.
1551031|CMP|Okay. Mighty fine Gordo. Thank you.
1551123|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 155 hours 11 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Even though there are some 4 mirutes and 25 seconds remaining to actual disappearance of the spacecraft America behind the Moon, the network has taken down the uplink to the spacecraft so, for all practical purposes, we have had loss of signal to Ron Evans aboard spacecraft America. We'll see him again in about 48 minutes. Meanwhile the crew of lunar module Challenger is still asleep at Taurus-Littrow. To reiterate the new wake-up time for the Challenger crew it's Ground Elapsed Time of 160 hours 25 minutes with the start of EVA 3 coming at 163:40, which is approximately 1 hour later than the Flight Plan. Current orbit measurements of spacecraft America: 69.6 by 53.5 nautical miles. As the spacecraft disappeared behind the Moon, the velocity in orbit was 5372 feet per second. The Gold Team of Flight Directors or Flight Controllers settling in for a fairly short day shift ending at 2:00 p.m., just after the surface crew has been wakened. Gerry Griffin in charge of the LM or Lunar Module flight controllers and the CSM group headed up by Neil Hutchinson. At 155:13 Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
1560000|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 156 hours Ground Elapsed Time in the mission of Apollo 17. Coming up on acquisition of signal in about 50 seconds the Command Module, America, coming around on her 35th lunar orbit. Command Module Pilot, Ron Evans, awake at this time, should be completing his breakfast and ready for a days work in lunar orbital science. Meanwhile the crew of Challenger on the lunar surface still asleep. About 4-1/2 hours until they're awakened for the third and final EVA of this mission and of the Apollo program. Waiting for confirmation in about 5 seconds or perhaps a few more seconds that network has indeed locked onto the signal from spacecraft, America. We do have acquisition. Let's join the air-ground 2 circuit for any conversation during this 35th front-side pass.
1560310|CMP|Houston, this is America. I see you tried to come in there.
1560315|CC|Yes, Ron. You're loud and clear.
1560322|CMP|Okay. I'm just finishing up my fruit cocktail.
1560327|CC|Okay. While you're munching there, let me give you a few status reports here. First of all, your RCS is hooking right along there 4 percent above the Flight Plan line; however, we have some plans for that 4 percent, which I'll go over with you later. On the oxygen, you've gained a little on it, since I was last on anyway. O2 tank 1 is a little low, but it's balanced by tank 3 being a - a little high, and tank 2 is right on the redline, so I think they all balance out to be about on the redline on the Flight Plan line. And they all three balance out to be right on the Flight Plan line, as close as I can tell. On hydrogen, you're probably up about 4 percent in tank 1, and the other two are right on the line, so you are in good shape there, still.
1560431|CMP|Very good.
1560441|CC|Okay, while you're - I've got some words on - on your orbit here, which won't require anything - writing down anything - but for some reason you're missing the mascons or something, and your orbit's not degrading like we expected it to. It's not degrading down into a circular orbit. It's - I think it's staying just about the way it was, and so we're looking ahead to a plane change, and we're - we're thinking about an extra maneuver prior to plane change - about 1 hour prior to plane change on the back side. There was some discussion here about what to call that maneuver. Somebody wanted to call it a HAM, Height Adjustment Maneuver, and someone else said, well that one's already used in the rendezvous sequence. Maybe we ought to make it "bacon". And even "lox" was was suggested, considering the FDOs objected to "bacon" because of his religion. So the "lox" was eliminated because we already used that for the S-IVB.
1560605|CMP|How about "mascon adjust?"
1560610|CC|Anyway, what the maneuver's going to be - whatever we call it - is about 11 foot per second RCS burn, 1 hour prior to plane change so that'll be on the back side. And, that'll just about use up your RCS overage and put you back on the Flight Plan line. That will adjust the height when you get around to the plane change, and then the plane change will be a little bigger than originally planned, showing about 365 feet per second, SPS, of course. And, looking at the consumables, that will put you down right - right on the rescue red-line on SPS, so we're still in good shape - consumable-wise. Further tracking will refine this, of course, so we'll have updates on the plan. Any questions on that? Over.
1560713|CMP|No, it sounds like you all thought it out. I appreciate your letting me know about that. I think - Is the timeline worked out good enough in there to work in a P41? I guess it does - an hour before, huh?
1560725|CC|Yes, well - we'll make it. I haven't looked at it myself, but we are - FAO has - and I haven't heard exactly what needs to be changed, if anything. Okay, on the SIM bay. Basically there's nothing new to report. And all the people down here appreciate your timely operation of the SIM bay, and it's responsible for really maximizing the data return. In general, we're pretty happy. The problems that we're have - having with it are ones that have already been mentioned to you. On the - on the HF antenna retract problem that we have, if we have it, here's the plan. We're - Well, first of all, the consensus on that is that we really think the antennas are retracting okay. That it's a malfunction in the limit switch that drives the talkback that's really the problem. But we have devised an alternate method, utilizing timing and stall current, and actually the signature of the motor stall current down here in the data, to determine proper retraction. And just prior to 168 hours in the Flight Plan, you're supposed to retract those antennas, and we're going to check the data at that time, and say "yes" or "no"; they are retracting or they aren't. If they don't, then the alternate plan we'll swing into at that time is to reschedule the HF targets that are now scheduled on rev 55. Reschedule them and do them on rev 42. After which, we'll try one more time to retract the antennas, and if it still looks like they indeed are not retracting - I guess it's just the one that's in question - then we'll go ahead and jettison them at that time. And we'll still have gotten most of the - of the at least - priority HF targets with that alternate plan. Over.
1560942|CMP|Yes, that sounds like - sounds like a good plan to me.
1560946|CC|Okay, we got one request from EECOM here. Can you turn the H2 tank 2 FANs, OFF, please?
1561001|CMP|H2 tank 2 FANs are OFF now.
1561004|CC|Okay. And when you get between courses on breakfast there, I have some pencil work for you in the way of Flight Plan updates. Not too much, really.
1561031|CMP|Okay. Contrary to the way I eat breakfast on the ground, I always end up leaving my orange juice to last. I guess that's because you like to eat the hot things first.
1561044|CC|Roger.
1561046|CMP|What I'm saying is the only thing I've got left to eat is orange juice, and I'm ready to copy.
1561051|CC|Okay, 156:22 - which is coming up here - like to, at that time, verify all Command Module VHF off. It's now 11 after - You have to terminate the jet-on monitor and then get the sounder operating. I can break this off at any time if you think we're pressing that. Just interrupt me. At 156:50, lunar sounder pad. T-start is 156:51:05, and T-spot is 156:56:09. Over.
1561147|CMP|Okay. T-start, 156:51:05, 156:56:09.
1561153|CC|That's good. Flip the page - flip two pages and copy the next sounder pad, which is for 158:40. T-start is 158:49:35 and stop time is 158 - -
1561213|CMP|Wait a minute; wait a minute. I'm not with you.
1561215|CC|Oh, okay.
1561220|CMP|Okay. I got it (chuckle).
1561222|CC|Okay. T-start - -
1561223|CMP|Go ahead, now, very sorry.
1561224|CC|- - 158:49:35, and stop is 158:54:38.
1561241|CMP|Okay. Start 158:49:35, 158:54:38.
1561247|CC|Okay, that's correct. Now at - that same page - 158:13, after "PAN CAMERA - ON," add a line that says, "V/H OVERRIDE - HIGH ALTITUDE."
1561314|CMP|Okay, at 158:13, "V/H OVERRIDE to HIGH ALTITUDE."
1561319|CC|Okay, and at 158 - -
1561320|CMP|I think it's still in HIGH ALTITUDE from yesterday. Yes, it is.
1561324|CC|Okay. 158:21 is another, "Verify all Command Module VHF, OFF."
1561347|CMP|Okay, 158:21, "Verify all VHF, OFF," and I know what that means.
1561352|CC|Okay, and the next two are easy. Next page, at 159:01. Just draw a line through "MAPPING CAMERA, RETRACT", and at 159:05 - -
1561406|CMP|Okay, I got it.
1561406|CC|- - draw a line through "MAPPING CAMERA LASER ALTIM - LASER ALTIMETER COVER, CLOSED."
1561415|CMP|Okay, got it.
1561417|CC|Okay, I think we're caught up. We're ready for HIGH GAIN, AUTO.
1561425|CMP|Okay, I'll go back and see where we are in the old Flight Plan. Okay, you have AUTO.
1561433|CC|Okay.
1561453|CMP|Okay. I don't think this lightweight headset is quite as good as the - the other one, and I'm going to change as soon as I get a chance here.
1561501|CC|Okay.
1561502|CMP|Okay, VHF A is OFF, B is OFF, RECEIVE ONLY, B DATA is OFF, BEACON is OFF, RANGING is OFF. That's all (chuckle).
1561514|CC|Okay.
1561526|CMP|I was looking at - Aitken when they came that side. Aitken is almost right in the terminator, right now. So when they come up on terminator photos there - The only thing is that, even though it was down in the shadow, down in the bottom of the crater, I could still see the bottom of the craters ... when they come around there for the near-terminator photography. I'm going to open the camera up and take a picture down in the shadow itself and see if that works.
1561601|CC|Okeydoke.
1561602|CMP|And there was quite a bit of backlight - quite a bit of backlight reflection from the northeastern side of it and also the eastern side of it, I guess. Funny, down in the eastern rim - -
1561618|CC|Ron, if you give us ACCEPT, we'll give you a vector while you got it.
1561618|CMP|- - the only way I can describe it - Okay. You have ACCEPT.
1561627|CC|Roger.
1561631|CMP|And the DSKY is clear. With the shadow effect on the eastern - I guess the east and southeastern interior rim of the crater, it reminds me a lot of some eroded hills. Like if you've got a valley that maybe has a 20-foot - it's bigger than that - but say you got a 20-foot drop on the thing where it's been - just rain erosion down the side and it kind of washes little - little valleys down it here and there. And it leaves mounds and humps in between that haven't eroded away yet. And that's the way the side of that crater works. And then the other side of it, the northeastern rim of it and the interior rim, looks just like a - one of the massif units. That is, it's a very fine texture, no real erosional processes, just a smooth, gentle - gentle slope.
1561752|CC|Roger.
1561808|CC|Okay, Ron; it's your computer. Go gack to BLOCK.
1561814|CMP|Okay, we're in BLOCK.
1561944|CMP|You know that Skylab drink bag has really been a pretty good deal because you can use the nipple that's on the end of that thing and use it for all of the beverage packages. And that way, you don't have to cut open the end of it and let it drip out all over the place.
1562007|CC|Hey, I'll pass that along to the Skylab - -
1562007|CMP|- - you can use the nipple.
1562026|CMP|I'm not sure if they have any of our beverage packs or not. I think they are all packaged in these expandable little things we're using for water - water cans.
1562037|CC|I see.
1562212|CMP|Hey, Gordo, what day is this?
1562216|CC|Out of sync there myself. It's Wednesday. It's about 9:15 in the morning, Wednesday.
1562228|CMP|Ah ha! Thank you. I guess I could have figured it - up, but -
1562241|CC|That's why we're here. Answer important questions.
1562247|CMP|(Laughter) That's right.
1562250|CMP|Hey, getting ready for LUNAR SOUNDER to STANDBY. That's a "verify."
1562301|CC|Roger.
1562310|CMP|And RECORDER is - RADAR is ON. RECORDER is OFF, not heaters. I see the old MODE is still in VHF. Ah ha! I get to control the spacecraft again. ... Takes about five minimum impulse blips to get -a tenth of a degree per second.
1562405|CC|Roger.
1562817|CMP|The dark annulus around Serenitatis - As you look north - the dark variation there, and I'm kind of looking back - looking a little bit backwards now - but that dark has no continuity with the ridge at all. Goes right down the middle of the ridges. As you look directly east of Littrow - east - I mean directly west of Littrow, the wrinkle ridge is there, and then there's - it comes out, and you have the light tan, tannish, tannish - there's a dark, I guess - you call it a dark tannish-gray. And then you get out to the light tan of the Mare Serenitatis, itself.
1562918|CC|Okay, Ron.
1563309|CMP|You know, I'm looking almost directly into the Sun and you can still see a topographic expression - topographic high, around the rilles in the Tacquet area, and also the grayness has disappeared out of that - out of the dark material, and it's just - looking into the Sun now - it looks more of a tan - a darker tan than the Serenitatis area. And you can all see - also see the topographic rise to it now - I'm looking quite a ways away from it and looking down on it.
1563350|CC|Roger.
1563424|CMP|You know, that's kind of funny now, looking back at Sulpicius Gallus and just to the north of that, there's a crater that's about - well, it's right at the end of those rilles that go north from Sulpicius Gallus. And you can really see the ejecta blanket. The ejecta blanket looks very dark, around it now in this Sun. Now you look out across the Mare Serenitatis now and you're getting toward the sunset, looking back into the Sun, and the color is disappearing all except in that one spot. Now that must be a - either a fresh ejecta - and you lose the brightness of it or something - or either that or it's dark. It's sure a dark - it's a dark ejecta blanket around it. The blanket itself goes out maybe two or three crater diameters, and it looks like it has kind of a ray-type pattern to it. I'll mark that crater. I don't even know if it has got a name or not, but I'll mark it on my map.
1563529|CC|Okay.
1563536|CMP|I got a ding. Let's see. It must be time to do something.
1563539|CC|Yes, it's time to turn the recorder on.
1563544|CMP|RECORDER, ON. RECORDER'S ON.
1563551|CC|Okay.
1563705|CMP|Just - I don't know where I am right now, I'll be honest with you. I just looked out window 3, and I'm right on the terminator. And, let's see, I'm going west, so we've got some arcuate - There's kind of a - little bit of a mare area down there. Okay, I think it is. And you can see lava tongues sticking out through there. And lava flow fronts with the high side on the east side because you got a shadow all the way along the front. And they're about - in the one area - you might consider a scalloped area - an ejecta scallop. Coming out of that one area you can see a crazy lava flow coming out from it.
1563811|CC|Roger on that.
1563813|CMP|At least the flow -
1563908|CMP|Hey, those are Apennines I'm just going over, aren't they?
1563911|CC|That's right. That's what they ought to be. We need the IR, OFF.
1563920|CMP|You look back out across Seren - Okay.
1563925|CC|We need the IR COVER, CLOSED, please.
1563927|CMP|Say again, Gordo.
1563929|CC|We want the IR COVER, CLOSED. Right away.
1563935|CMP|Okay, it's going CLOSED. Okay, it's CLOSED. How about the UV?
1563955|CMP|IR COVER is CLOSED.
1564006|CMP|I was just going to say, looking back across Serenitatis into the Sun now, there must be Bessel that has an ejecta pattern out there. When you look at the ejecta patterns into the Sun, they all look black with respect to the mare. I think it must be a shadow effect or something that you get off of the - the raised ejecta that comes up across it.
1564039|CC|Roger.
1564243|CC|Hey, Ron, that frantic call there was because the Sun had started to get in the IR and hadn't really thought that would happen, but started to see it get in there. But you caught it in time; the cover saved it.
1564300|CMP|Okay. Real good. I figured that's probably what it was.
1564310|CC|And you can go ahead with the rest of the steps in there with the UV off after sunset.
1564323|CMP|Okay. MAPPING CAMERA is going OFF. COVER's CLOSED on the IR so then we'll turn it off. PAN CAMERA, SELF TEST, OFF. And let's see, I don't see the Sun shining up a light out there. It must be sunset. Couldn't be yet, though. Yes, it sure enough is, though. Okay, UV's going OFF. You want the IR COVERs back OPEN just to keep things straight here?
1564441|CC|Stand by on that.
1564448|CMP|They're just - I - next time we use the IR, let's just remember to open the cover.
1564503|CC|Okay. Just open it up the next time we use it, which is in about 15 minutes. We'll - we'll remind you on that if you forget.
1564515|CMP|Oh, okay. That's right. Okay. That's right, these are just short sounder passes now, aren't they?
1564524|CC|That's right.
1564545|CC|Ron, I can finish up my description of the last night's EVA if you like, since nothing to look at now. I'm watching the clock on the sounder start for you.
1564559|CMP|Okay; hey, appreciate it.
1564602|CC|Okay, think I left off, or was cut off there without mentioning two varieties of breccia in the South Massif they found. Blue-gray and tan-gray and, without going into the geological details, those are the two types they found up there at Nansen. The subfloor unit was exposed as blocks and ejecta around larger craters had been partly buried by dark mantle. And craters apparently had penetrated thin parts of the light mantle. Especially good samples were obtained from the rim of Camelot where the same textural characteristics which are banding caused by variations in vesicle concentration, coarse-grain size, and mineralogic features, as reported in EVA-1, were found. So apparently this unit is quite uniform over the distances that they have covered so far in the traverses. The prominent east-facing scarp, crossing the valley floor from north to south about 5 kilometers west of the LM, was traversed twice near the crater Lara, near Hole-in-the-Wall, although Hole-in-the-Wall appeared to be pretty subtle. No change in the surface characteristics or lithology of the mantle was discernible where the astronauts traversed the Scarp. Outcrops of boulders were observed farther to the north where the northward extension of the Scarp crosses the face of the North Massif, it forms a notably smooth and relatively young-appearing surface. Elsewhere, the surface of the North Massif is prominently furrowed and textured, and the crew described it as a cross-hatched pattern on the surface that they could see with one set of lineaments dipping eastward and the other westward at about 30 degrees. Some of the most interesting observations made during the EVA were related to craters. Many small craters within the dark mantle have glass-coated central pits. Jack called them dimples. Some of the pits are nearly cylindrical and maybe half again as deep as the crater itself. Other small craters occurring in both the dark and light mantle have bright halos, but these halos appear to be noticeably brighter on the light-colored material. This bright material is not blocky or fragmental ejecta derived from a subfloor layer, but rather appears to consist of "instant rock" or soil breccia which has been partly consolidated by the impact shock itself. The most interesting eureka during the EVA was at station 4, Shorty Crater, where Jack found some bright red or orange, he described it, orange dirt within the gray to dark-gray rim material. The colored banding is circumferential to the crater and resembled alteration halos, which occur around many terrestrial volcanic vents. So you can see why the geologists are excited on that one. The morphology of Shorty, however, is similar in some respects - -
1564922|CMP|You bet you.
1564922|CC|- - impact craters have definitive interpretation of its origin may depend on sample analysis. And I got about a minute and a half to start the sounder. You might be close to 02:30 there, if you aren't. They took a total of about 850 pictures. They've taken a total of 1270, would you believe, pictures ... on the lunar surface. Including about 150 with the 500-millimeter camera, mostly of the North, South, East Massifs, and Family Mountain. They got 56 samples, two double cores, probably about 36 kilograms worth, and they traveled a total distance of 20 kilometers. Over.
1565022|CMP|Okay, sounds like a good summary. They're finding all kinds of things up there. Which is the reason you explore, I guess, to find - to see what you can find.
1565034|CC|Yes, they - they were really in their element last night. About 30 seconds to T-start time. I'll let you call it yourself, though.
1565043|CMP|Okay. I'll get it.
1565106|CMP|DATA SYSTEMS are OFF. OPERATE, 05.
1565113|CC|Okay.
1565134|CMP|Hope this thing's in Reiner Gamma. Then you can find some sort of a topographic expression, to that light-colored material around there. It looks to me like there is - right around the Reiner Gamma itself anyhow.
1565153|CC|Roger.
1565204|CMP|Maybe the lunar sounder will collaborate my moonlight investigations here - or earthlight investigations, I'm sorry.
1565213|CC|(Laughter)
1565230|CMP|While we're waiting here - I decided - decided to sleep last night without being tied down or anything. So I slept in the old - What do you call them in the Navy? -
1565248|CC|Hammocks, I think.
1565249|CMP|Well, anyhow, sleeper strings, we call them up here. Yes, sleeping bags - or some kind of sack. And the last 2 or 3 nights, what I'd do is put the lap belt on loosely. And you know, it just kind of keeps you from rolling all over the cockpit. Then last night, I didn't put it on at all and stayed in the sack. And I really didn't go too far anyhow. One time I woke up and I was crossways in the couch up here. And then when I woke up this morning my feet were up in the tunnel, and my head was kind of still in the center couch, more or less. So you really don't roam around too much that way anyhow, even if you aren't tied down. And you can get the "huggy pillow" effect by being inside that sack and laying your head on the outside of the sack. It just about fits me, except that if I stretch my feet out - then I get a little bit of a pull. Little bit of a pull - on it and it feels like a huggy pillow that way.
1565410|CC|Kind of a security blanket effect, huh?
1565415|CMP|(Laughter) Yes, right. That was the biggest problem the first 2 or 3 days here - what do you do with your head when you go to sleep. I'm used to sleeping with a pillow. And I'm used to sleeping on my side. And it's amazing the psychological effect that you can get from - for me it's hard to go to sleep just laying on my back. So you can turn on your side and you go right to sleep (laughter). What's your side and what's your back - I don't know, but anyhow, it works.
1565454|CC|That's got to be psychological.
1565459|CMP|(Laughter) It sure is.
1565610|CMP|5, 6, 7, 8 -
1565614|CMP|MARK it. LUNAR SOUNDER to STANDBY.
1565617|CC|Okay.
1565717|CMP|Okay. RECORDER is going OFF. ... the heaters.
1565721|CC|Roger.
1565727|CMP|DATA SYSTEMs coming ON.
1565744|CMP|Okay. SM/AC POWER is ON.
1565841|CMP|I guess we need to open the old door. IR, OFF, barberpole, gray bar. I get to mess with the old optics again.
1565923|CC|We're getting some of that, Ron. Sounds like the mike might have slipped away from your mouth, though.
1565933|CMP|Okay. That's a good point - let me change my headsets here. Anyhow, I went right through the Flight Plan with all that stuff.
1565943|CC|Okay, and - -
1565943|CMP|... got the IR COVER, OPEN.
1565948|CC|Okay. Great memory there.
1570118|CC|Ron, if you like while you're getting ready for the 52, I can summarize the news real rapidly. There wasn't a whole lot.
1570128|CMP|Okay. Sure, go ahead, I've got a different headset now. Is that okay?
1570132|CC|Yes, you're loud and clear. Former President Truman is still hanging in there. His heartbeat and breathing became unstable yesterday, but then improved again. Of course, the big headlines were about the discovery of the orange dirt at Shorty Crater. And there was a picture of Jan, John, and Jaime in the paper, watching the EVA on TV. The only thing new on the peace talks is that Kissinger will probably be coming back to the United States today and there's a rumor, the French press said that the compromise is in the work on the withdrawal of the North Vietnamese troops from the south. The Rockets lost - the Aeros, the hockey team, won last night. They beat the Alberta Oilers. The Rockets lost to Buffalo. And the weather finally cleared out. The cold front cleared out the wet stuff and last night I think was the first time since you guys launched that we've had a look at the Moon, so we had a direct look at you last night. It's just high cirrus and sunny this morning when I came to work. Over.
1570252|CMP|Hey, thanks for the news and I guess those three guys that went up to the Moon - you know, they probably cleared that weather up there in Houston.
1570301|CC|It sure took you awhile though.
1570307|CMP|(Laughter) Right.
1570435|CMP|Okay, 14 is Canopus again, the same ones I had last night I think. That's Canopus. Canopus looks about as bright as Sirius, but not quite.
1570512|CC|Roger.
1570520|CMP|My sextant - is good and everything like that, but you just can't quite get the reticle in focus.
1570533|CC|Roger.
1570536|CMP|It's kind of the way they said it was going to be.
1570610|CC|Okay, Ron. We copy those. Clear to torque them.
1570616|CMP|Okay, let's see; we'll torque at - oh, make it 06:30.
1570623|CC|All righty.
1570703|CC|Ron, we've got still about 5 or 6 minutes until LOS, but in case we drop off on your maneuvering there - just want to tell you that everything's looking good. In fact, the IR is pumping out good data, so with that fantastic teamwork, we saved it back there, and we'll see you next time around.
1570727|CMP|Hey, okay. Sounds good, there's little old Aldebaran in there. Saturn still must be out of the - There it goes into the -
1570856|CMP|(Humming) Okay, got to align the old GDC here. (Humming)
1571400||BEGIN LUNAR REV 36
1571450|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of control from the spacecraft America, going behind the Moon, nearing the end of the 35th lunar orbit. That orbit measuring, at this time, 69.5 nautical miles by 53.6. There is a plan under consideration now for a small trim maneuver just prior to plane change maneuver. Some 12 feet per second with the RCS thrusters to tune up the orbit a little bit. This currently appears to be around 181 hours 33 minutes, with the plane change approximately an hour later. Command Module Pilot, Ron Evans continuing to operate the scientific instrument module experiments in the service module of his spacecraft. All systems apparently operating nominally. Three hours 13 minutes remaining until crew of Challenger is awakened at Taurus-Littrow landing site. And at 157:16 Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
1580023|PAO|This is Ap - this is Apollo Control. We've acquired the command module, America coming around on the 36th rev. He's on a bad omni antenna at the moment, just barely readable, but we'll stand by here until the communications improve and Gordo Fullerton can continue the two-way communication.
1580210|CC|Hello there, America. We hear your scratchy-sounding OMNI.
1580217|CMP|(Laughter) Probably so.
1580225|CC|You're readable but noisy.
1580233|CMP|You're cutting in and out on the OMNI. I thought I couldn't get you.
1580239|CC|Roger.
1580248|CMP|Looks like we get the high gain here pretty quick. ...
1580253|CC|Roger.
1580730|CMP|...
1580851|CMP|Okay, Houston this is America. We probably have pretty good comm now, huh?
1580857|CC|Yes, Ron. We're getting you now, and you sound good.
1580907|CMP|Okay. I don't have any observations to report from the back side. About time for blue bag number 4. Somebody has got to develop a better mouse trap.
1580923|CC|Roger on that.
1581208|CMP|Okay, the old PAN CAMERA'S in STANDBY.
1581216|CC|Roger, Ron.
1581218|CMP|Power's coming - power's coming on and V/H is the HIGH ALTITUDE.
1581229|CC|Okay.
1581242|CC|Okay, Ron, we're ready for SELF TEST.
1581248|CMP|Okay, going to SELF TEST -
1581251|CMP|Now. Barber pole.
1581257|CC|Roger.
1581556|CMP|Okay, by the way, mag Lima Lima is empty. 165 frames showing there. Started mag Mike Mike with frame number 95. Finished the orbital science at 142. Took the crazy camera at f/5.6 at 1/125. When I got ready to change to f/5.6 at 1/250, I looked at the crazy thing and it was setting at f/11. Maybe those first frames in there, maybe they can develop them a little different or something and still bring - get them to come out.
1581700|CC|Okay, Ron. We got that.
1581709|CMP|I think what happens is I must have been holding the thing by the lens or something or I bumped the - the f-stop thing somehow.
1581728|CC|Ron, we're ready for PAN CAMERA POWER to OFF. And did you go to HEATERS after you set the SELF TEST switch to SELF TEST, when we started this?
1581743|CMP|No, I just went back to to OFF. Was I supposed to go to HEATERS?
1581753|CC|Okay, we'd like it in HEATERS, now.
1581759|CMP|Okay, it's going to HEATERS. Now it's spring-loaded to OFF, and I just left it there. Okay, going to HEATERS, and now it's going to - power is OFF.
1581809|CC|Okay.
1581813|CMP|Okay, let's see. Are we ready for Lunar Sounder? Need a clock down here by panel 230 (laugh). Not really. I can look back and see the LEB one. Okay, it's about time. Okay. LUNAR SOUNDER's verified in STANDBY. The RECORDER is going ON. RADAR is going ON. And the RECORDER is OFF, not the heaters. If antenna 1, verify they're out, eh? EXTEND. No barber pole. Back to OFF. Number 2 EXTEND. No barber pole. Back to OFF. Okay, MODE is going to HF and let me take a look at - Alfa is OFF; Bravo is OFF; B DATA is OFF; BEACON is OFF; RANGING is OFF. Okay, let's see. Two, two. 250 lens.
1582028|CMP|Okay, 5.6 ... fifth and infinity. Mag QQ.
1582047|CMP|Mike goes in the temporary stowage bag; QQ goes on with 104 frames.
1582114|CMP|That's going to be window 3.
1582157|CMP|Somebody had - had his nose up against window 3, here Got to wipe it off. Boy, these windows have really been great though. They haven't - you know - don't have any coatings or anything like that on them.
1582218|CC|Roger, on that.
1582305|CMP|I'll be darned. I'll bet that's a little micro-meteorite pit in window 3. Right in the middle of it. It looks like two of them out there. It's about - much smaller than a 1/32 - 1/64 - 1/64 in diameter probably.
1582331|CC|Gotcha.
1582331|CMP|It's a little, round - Doesn't seem to have any - It's just a pit, you know.
1582346|CC|Ron, you said that was window 3?
1582352|CMP|Window 3, yes.
1582354|CC|Okay.
1582555|CMP|Oh, it scared me for a minute there. I was configuring for terminator photos, and I looked on the near-side terminator, and I didn't see any. It's on the far side.
1582608|CC|Yes, Stu and I were looking at the same thing. We're just about a - 30 seconds ahead of you.
1582615|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. One's of Aitkin on the far side. Okay. Aitken and Ibn Hyan [sic], I think, or something like that. Debber [?], Ibn Hyan [sic].
1582708|CMP|You know, going to come across - come across the Tacquet area again, and there doesn't seem to be any - it - there's a bright crater - a recent crater in the annulus - in that dark annulus, in the southern part of Serenitatis, it shows up again as that kind of a blue-gray brightness, as opposed - as opposed to the tannish - tannish brightness of the - of the bright craters in Serenitatis. There's still is no apparent wrinkle ridge - there's no color tone or differentiation in the winkle-ridge area, in this part of it. The only differentiation, and - It looks like - South of Tacquet you get the same color tone variation occurs on over into Tranquillitatis. When you get to the Tacquet area, from Tacquet up to Miller or something - I wish I could remember the name of that crazy crater.
1582828|CC|How about Menelaus.
1582833|CMP|Menelaus. That's it. Yes. From Tacquet up to Menelaus now, the - that's got to be a buildup of material and it's more on the tan side than it is on the - more of a dark tan than it is to the tannish-gray. So it's a different type of material than - than on the annulus down below the crater, Tacquet.
1582908|CC|Okay, Ron. You're saying this is sort of a annular plateau, then, that stretches across between Tacquet and Menelaus?
1582919|CMP|Yes, it is. It's an annular plateau in there, and the plateau is got to have been coming from those rilles down - that are down in there.
1582934|CC|Okay, do those - Maybe you've already said this - do those wrinkle ridges cross the color boundaries?
1582945|CMP|No, I can't find the wrinkle ridge that crosses the color boundary. The wrinkle ridges are out in Serenitatis itself, and there is no color boundary on the western edge of Serenitatis. It's all the same.
1583005|CC|Okay. Those sound like supergood observations, Ron.
1583006|CMP|Passing over - Sulpic - and - I'm just passing over Sulpicius Gallus, now. And just beyond Sulpicius Gallus - Sulpicius Gallus is out in the Mare Tranquillitatis, itself, and it looks like you could - it's either a talus slope - you know, you got a gentle slope of the - of the massif coming down and then it changes slope a little bit, and the - it looks like you have finer-grained material. And that might be what we have at one time or another called the high-water mark, but I kind of believe that's just a talus change in the slope. As you go on down there in the fine-grained material, somehow developing down there in the bottom. But as soon as you cross that area - we're going west now from Sulpicius Gallus - again we've got kind of the same tannish - a dark tan material that essentially covers the highland - this highland-type of an area here. It's a hummocky-type material. There are a few rilles just north of Sulpicius Gallus; those rilles, again, have - have the dark tan material on it. About the same as the tan - same color tones that you pick up from Tacquet to Mele - Meleneis [sic].
1583155|CC|Okay sounds great. Keep talking, we'll cue you as the Flight Plan events come up.
1583204|CMP|Okay. D - D-Caldera is sure fascinating. I'll try and take a quick look with the binocs on that one. - binoca and I can't find it there. There it is.
1583256|CMP|I hope the pictures will kind of confirm a little bit of a - of a topographic rise around the D-Caldera, just a slight one, and it's about half the width of the - if you - As you look at the "D" it's a half a width of the "D", not the height, but the width. And it seems to be a raised, kind of a raised, flat rim around it. The color of the raised bumps down in the D-Caldera are the same as the surrounding material, around there. The de - the bumps that are raised up are smooth looking and the depression for it has to be a caldera, I guess, or at least, the part of the depression, anyhow, is a light bluish gray; I'll call it that way, very light bluish gray.
1583415|CC|Hey, Ron I'm not suggesting you do, because it's probably trouble to find. Have you tried the color wheel, comparing it on any of this stuff?
1583427|CMP|(Laughter) No, I haven't. Let me try. That's a good idea, though. I'll try that and see what I can come up with on that thing.
1583436|CC|Well, don't don't go to a lot of trouble. I never got around to it, but you might - you might peg down some of these colors a little better. Particularly when you were talking last night about - on the back side - -
1583448|CMP|That's a good point.
1583448|CC|- on one of those passes about the green.
1583454|CMP|Yes.
1583455|CC|Okay, you're about 7 seconds away from where we're wanting the recorder on, Ron. Any time here's fine.
1583505|CMP|Okay, RECORDER - let's see -
1583510|CMP|Is ON. Verify RADAR is ON, remove HF, okay.
1583633|CMP|You know, to me, the Moon's got a lot more color than I'd been led to believe. I kind of had the impression that everything was the same color. That's far from being true.
1583653|CC|Okay.
1583711|CC|I guess, maybe we could say, perhaps, color is in the eye of the beholder.
1583720|CMP|I think there is a considerable amount of truth to that.
1583828|CMP|(Whistling)
1583854|CC|Okay, Ron. We'll take the MAPPING CAMERA, OFF, now.
1583900|CMP|Okay, the old MAPPER is going OFF.
1583947|CC|Ron, you're clear to go to STANDBY on the MAPPING CAMERA.
1583953|CMP|Okay, MAPPER's going to STANDBY. MOTION is up, barberpole. CAMERA is OFF. PAN CAMERA SELF TEST, OFF. Okay, turn the old SM/AC POWER, OFF, again. SERVICE MODULE AC POWER is OFF.
1584340|CMP|(Whistling)
1584352|CMP|Okay, must be sunset. IR is coming -
1584400|CMP|OFF. ... OFF. Okay, I'm going to go to plus-X Plus 52.25. There is an UP-LINK. VERB 58 ENTER. Ah, 141. That's pretty close. 228.
1584507|CMP|Ah - plus 66641. ENTER, there at 48 07. ... at 49 35. That's about right.
1584810|CC|Ron, about a minute and a half to T-start, now.
1584816|CMP|Okay. Cue release, ENTER.
1584835|CMP|OMNI Bravo.
1584859|CMP|Power OFF. Okay, data systems - -
1584905|CC|Okay, 30 seconds to T-start.
1584908|CMP|- ... five. Okay, at 40 minutes - Okay. I got the HIGH GAIN, OFF. Got my finger on the DATA SYSTEMS. Okay. DATA SYSTEMS are going OFF; OPERATE at 49:35. OPERATE. 54:38. Give me a call on that, Gordo. I'm going to look out the window here for a bit.
1585002|CC|Sure will, Ron.
1585004|CMP|A minute before that or so.
1585013|CMP|I had the lights up. I may not be light adapted.
1585055|CMP|Sure is ...
1585152|CMP|I was trying to think if there was anything else I could add to the Reiner Gamma observation there. I'm right over that - the light albedo of that type of material that goes perpendicular between Reiner and Reiner Gamma. It's kind of a crooked type - Well, you know, it goes for a little ways, and then it breaks off into a dark-albedo-type stuff; and then breaks off in another direction a little bit. So, it doesn't look like a straight ray at all.
1585227|CC|Roger.
1585231|CMP|You know - you can see crater holes, and this type of thing. You look right down on Reiner now, you've sure got that dark annulus - the lighter-albedo-type stuff is essentially in the middle of it. And the annulus is - let's see, maybe 30 kilometers wide by twice as long - that's a relative size, anyhow - by twice as long, and that's the dark ann - dark area. And then around that, the light albedo stuff is about half of the width, and it's lighter on the outside than it is on the inside. The inside is not quite as light as the - I'd call it the rim, I guess. It's very hard to see any - -
1585333|CC|Okay.
1585333|CMP|- - great, great, great topographic expression to it, though. The reason I say that is because it kind of blends in with everything, whereas if you look at a crater, out here in the middle of the mare, or a hill, you get a brighter - part of it's brighter than the surrounding territory. You can actually see the demarcation. So that's the way you get your depth perception out of it.
1585405|CC|Okay, about 30 seconds now until T-stop.
1585412|CMP|Okay. T-stop is 54:38 and we'll go to STANDBY at that time. Tape switch. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7; STANDBY.
1585449|CC|Okay. I'll give you a call in a minute.
1585454|CMP|Okay.
1585539|CC|Okay, Ron. It's been a minute.
1585548|CMP|Okay. RECORDER is OFF - not HEATERS. RADAR is OFF. DATA SYSTEM goes back ON. HIGH GAIN ANTENNA POWER to ON. And we're about minus 44, I guess. And select the old HIGH GAIN. There we go. REACQ ... AUTO. ... in NARROW. INCO's going to do some commanding. ... goes. Tape motion is going. Continue on here to the SM/AC POWER. Okay. SM/AC POWER is ON.
1585704|CMP|MAPPING CAMERA is STANDBY. IR ... CAMERA SELF TEST ... ... is ON. H2 PURGE LINE HEATER. Do a hydrogen purge, here, shortly, I guess.
1585743|CMP|Well - Leave that cover open there, and let the Mendall Mendall get some data for a while; or Dr. Low, or whoever happens to be there. And I'll step ahead and sample the old BUSS.
1585821|CC|Okay.
1585923|CMP|(Singing).
1585959|CMP|Houston, America. You might tell the medics not to pay any attention to those sample numbers on those busses. Pay attention to the GET time, because when you take them out of the buss storage bag, the right one never comes out. So I don't think it makes any difference, Just pay attention to the GET time.
1590025|CC|Okay, Ron. I'll pass that along.
1590115|CMP|(Singing).
1590139|CMP|Where are the guys on the Challenger? Are they going to go out the regular time, or are they getting a little extra sleep period here or something?
1590148|CC|I think we're letting them sleep in again today. They're getting up 1 hour later than the Flight Plan shows; however, there's enough pad downstream that we're planning on ascent at the scheduled time.
1590215|CMP|Okay.
1590312|CMP|(Humming and whistling)
1590519|CMP|(Humming)
1590620|CMP|I think I'll ... the STOWAGE VENT, ON, just for a little bit.
1590637|CMP|(Whistling)
1590642|CC|America, Houston. We've got a couple of - couple of items of general information, as you come up on AOS here - LOS. The - we want to remind you to CLOSE the IR - -
1590755|CMP|Okay.
1590755|CC|- - and UV COVERS, before you do any dumps. After LOS, you'll have to - -
1590802|CMP|Okay. Will do.
1590802|CC|- - reconfigure the comm.
1590806|CC|And suggest you wait on the dumps, as per the Flight Plan, until after the photos. And, we estimate the waste water dump will take 10 minutes. Over.
1590820|CMP|About 10 minutes on the waste water. Okay.
1590835|CMP|Okay. Let's see - must be ... LOW BIT RATE. Okay, LOW BIT RATE, with DATA SYSTEMS, so no DSE voice. I'll write everything down.
1591128|CMP|Okay, ... hoses and stuff all tucked down there.
1591308|CC|Just about LOS, Ron. See you later.
1591313|CMP|Okay, Gordo. Thank you much.
1591313||BEGIN LUNAR REV 37
1591326|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 159 hours 13 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We've had loss of signal, as Ron Evans, flying the spacecraft America, passed behind the Moon nearing the end of revolution number 36. An hour and 16 minutes until Cernan and Schmitt, aboard Challenger are awakened for the third - for preparations for the third Moon Walk. America, now in an orbit measuring 69.1 by 53.7 nautical miles. We'll come back up at next frontside pass by the spacecraft America in about 48 minutes, and switch over to the wakeup call to the Challenger partway through that 37th revolution. At 159:14 Ground Elapsed Time this is Apollo Control.
1595713|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 159 hours 57 minutes Ground Elapsed Time in the mission of Apollo 17. Less than 1 minute away now as the command module America, Ron Evans doing his orbital science tasks and orbital photography. As he comes around on revolution number 37; less than a half hour until the wake up call is made to the crew of Challenger on the lunar surface. At that time, we'll switch over to the air/ground 1 circuit and eavesdrop on the conversation between Cernan / Schmitt - Cernan and Schmitt and the CAPCOM here in mission control. We should have acquisition of signal from command module America. We'll come up with that line now.
1595915|CMP|(Humming)
1595922|CMP|Well, I've got AOS with you. Okay. ... HEATERs OFF. (Singing) ...
1595947|CC|Hello, America. Are you there?
1595952|CMP|Okay. We got REACQ and NARROW now.
1595956|CC|Okay. You're loud and clear.
1600034|CC|Ron, when it's convenient - -
1600035|CMP|Okay. I just finished mag - -
1600036|CC|- - I have a couple of updates to the Flight Plan - -
1600040|CMP|Okay. Go ahead.
1600043|CC|Okay. On your present page, there - the UV solar atmosphere pad, at 160:38.
1600053|CMP|Ah-ha. I have it.
1600057|CC|Okay. It's T-start of 160:41:22; T-stop is 161:26:47. And the remark that goes with that - you don't need to write this down - but the T-start time is biased 10 seconds prior to when we really think sunset will occur. If you see, visually - Okay, my mistake, it's 10 seconds after sunset. But if you see sunset visually, you can go ahead and proceed with UV cover open as soon as you see it. But we'd like you to close the UV cover exactly on the T-stop time as written. Over.
1600159|CMP|Okay. Let's see. I'm with you. We'll make sure it gets closed at 61:26:47, but we can open it as soon as sunset comes, okay? Even though we haven't started pitching yet.
1600223|CC|That's correct, and do you want to read back the start time?
1600230|CMP|My start time is 160:41:22. Is that correct?
1600234|CC|That's correct; 41:22.
1600239|CMP|Okay.
1600243|CC|Okay. Go to 161:34.
1600256|CMP|161:34, okay.
1600258|CC|Okay, and the old standard "MAP CAMERA/LASER ALTIMETER COVER, OPEN" cross that out. A couple lines below, at 36, cross out "MAPPING CAMERA, EXTEND" and then turn the page - -
1600316|CMP|I got them.
1600321|CC|In fact, turn two pages to 163:31.
1600331|CMP|31, okay,
1600332|CC|At 163:31, write in "verify all command module VHF, OFF."
1600352|CMP|63:31, verily all VHF, OFF, okay?
1600357|CC|Okay. That completes it.
1600407|CMP|Goody, I've got a zodiacal light coming up there sometime; blue filter, no less. Oh, I started to say, when I was coming across Aitken - Of course Aitken itself was down in the shadow, and the Sun was really shining on window 3. I took the first one at f/5.6 and a 1/15. the second one 56, 5.6, I mean, at a - at a 1/30; and a third one at a 1/60; and then a fourth one at a 1/25; and the fifth and sixth ones I took off to the north - looking off to the north - out of window 4.
1600512|CC|Okay.
1600513|CMP|And they were 5.6 at 1/125. I kind of doubt if - It might work, but there's sure a lot of glare on the window. If it can get through that glare, well then we've got it made.
1600528|CC|Roger.
1600710|CMP|Oh, the other thing I was going to tell you was that magazine Quebec Quebec - I finished that one on 114.
1600718|CC|Okay.
1600720|CMP|On that pass there.
1600731|CMP|I don't know who took my water jug, but it's gone.
1600816|CMP|Okay. Overboard drain is purged enough, I guess, I'll turn that off.
1600837|CMP|That big filter on here - here. I always leave the hose and everything disconnected and stick it back behind this rock bag. I'm afraid I'll kick it, break it off. You know - you know those rock bags. I unzip those and blow the air out of them every night, wake up the next morning, and they're full of air again; just like two big balloons down there.
1600908|CC|How about that.
1600913|CMP|(Laughter) I don't know ...
1600919|CC|You can use one for the pillow you've been missing.
1600925|CMP|(Laughter) Yes, that's an idea. I could use that.
1601023|CMP|And, Houston; America. If FAO's got his finger on the next magazine - next Hasselblad mag, I'm going to use - save me looking it up, here.
1601039|CC|Okay. I'll ask him.
1601109|CC|Ron, I - You're scheduled to use Mike Mike next.
1601111|CMP|There's the water - Go ahead. Mike Mike. Okay. Thank you.
1601123|CMP|Did you hear me sucking all the bubbles out of the - out of my teeth?
1601138|CC|No, we've missed that pleasure.
1601144|CMP|Good. Didn't want this VOX to be too good.
1601252|CMP|Okay. We go to P00 in about 2 minutes.
1601409|CMP|Zero phase is going to go right over Proclus, I mean Picard this time. Just as that darkness disappears there, if I can still see the change in the color on it.
1601426|CC|Okay, Ron. You can put the HIGH GAIN to AUTO next chance you get and FAO advises there's no more optional film left on Mike Mike. Everything that's left on Mike Mike is scheduled up. Over.
1601444|CMP|Okay. I'll buy that. You know you could even - as zero phase went right across Picard there, you could still see the - the darkness on the west - let's see east - on the east from 9 o'clock around to 6 o'clock, if north is zero.
1601510|CC|Roger.
1601515|CMP|And. if north is zero as you look at the crater, then over about 1 o'clock there's some kind of a fault area in the side of the rim, and that's another spot where the dark material drapes down into the rim and also out on the outer - outside - outside of the rim. And then you have that same type of impression at about 11 o'clock. You've got a black streak going dcwn inside the rim, and then it widens out, going out toward a little crater out there, on the outside of the rim.
1601603|CC|Okay,- -
1601605|LMP|Now, let's see - -
1601605|CC|- - you're scheduled to get a VERB 49 going now.
1601611|CMP|Thank you. Okay. Pitch is plus 120.55 ENTER, plus 341.00 ENTER, and a plus ENTER for 0 yaw 622. Press on. 50 18. CMC caged. Proceed.
1601718|CMP|Okay; let's see. We're in AUTO, so we can ...teen. 26 on the dial.
1601834|CMP|Okay, we'll change 07 to 8 plus 9 - 1 -
1601856|CMP|... VENTS OPEN. ... waste water dump. Must have been some stuff that's just frozen on the - the dump or something and then when the - when the jets fired too - that kicked it loose.
1601931|CC|Roger.
1601937|CMP|Maybe that's the particles of combustion - burning.
1602012|CMP|Minus 0.05 - degrees per - half a degree dead band.
1602029|CMP|Five up - Got zero, zero. Stay there ...
1602313|CC|Ron, this is Houston. Check NOUN 79 again. We think you might have loaded R1 and R2 negative. That's the way it locked down here, anyway.
1602326|CMP|Okay, I'll check that.
1602402|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 160 hours 24 minutes switching now to Air-Ground 1 for the initial wake up call to the crew of Challenger, asleep at this time on Taurus-Littrow. Command module America still has some 47 minutes remaining in this frontside pass. We'll stand by for the wakeup call which should be beamed up in about a half a minute or so.
1602503|CC|(Music: Texas Aggies Fight Song)
1602634|CDR|I want you to say it first.
1602640|CC|Hello there, Challenger. The Gold Team Flight Director picked out the morning's selection, and he said that if you can find some maroon dirt, today, instead of orange, you'll probably get a lot more cooperation out of him.
1602702|CDR|I figured the Gold Team might do that. You know, I've woke up to a lot of pleasant thoughts, but never to an Aggie before.
1602714|CDR|Hey, Gordo, don't forget I'm a gold - I'm a Boilermaker.
1602722|CC|Roger.
1602727|CDR|I feel like one right now. Tell the Gold Team Flight Director we'll find about - just about anything he wants today.
1602742|CC|Okay; I'll do that. The Challenger looks as good as ever. No problems at all through the night.
1602752|CDR|That's outstanding. How's America?
1602755|CC|It's in the same shape. Just clicking along. Ron's been up for a few hours now and really gathering up the data.
1602806|CDR|Outstanding, Gordo,
1602820|CC|Challenger, the name of the game today is to stay with the - the EVA prep timeline. We're not going to talk much to you - We'd like - except to bug you a little and stay on your back to keep with the timeline, if at all possible - We'd like to get out on time. Over.
1602842|CDR|Okay, Gordo. That's been our motive all along, and we will stay with it. As of right now, - we're 1 hour behind. is that correct?
1602852|CC|That's affirmative. Although, if you stay on the normal timeline, that's fine with us. We don't need to gain any, but we just don't want to lose any - from where we're starting now.
1602906|CDR|Yes. Understand. Understand.
1602916|LMP|Good. How are you this morning?
1603003|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The reference to Aggie has to do with the fact that the Flight Director, Gold Team Flight Director, Gerry Griffin is an alumnus of Texas A & M University. The wake-up music this morning was the Aggie war hymn, E Pluribus Gig-Um, and Gerry proceeded to gig the crew with his own brand of music.
1603452|CDR|Houston, Challenger.
1603453|CC|Go ahead, Challenger.
1603503|CDR|Okay, Gordy. Crew status is good, in case you hadn't noticed. And again I'm not going to - We haven't kept an itemized accounting of the food - burning up blanks on the paper to do that. But we have ate - have eaten, pardon me - We have eaten just about everything in the various meals. I guess the shrimp was the only thing we didn't really eat. And we've been drinking a lot of water and all the juices and tea and stuff, so I think we're in pretty good shape there. The commander had a Seconal last night, and he slept 3 good and 3 intermittent hours. LMP had no medication and had 6 good hours of sleep. If you've got some lift-off time data, well, I'll copy it.
1603602|CC|That's affirm. Okay; start with - for rev 38. Time is 162:22:52. Rev 39 is 164:21:24; 166:19:55; 168:18:27; 170:16:59; 172:15:31. That should have been rev 43, and read back starting with rev 38.
1603705|CDR|Okay; rev 38: 162:22:52; 164:21:24; 166:19:55; 168:18:27; 170:16:59; 172:15:31. And what is our present rev?
1603724|CC|That's a good question. Let's see here. We're working on rev 37. Ron just went by you about 10 minutes ago on rev 37.
1603756|CDR|Okay.
1604131|CDR|Gordy, we're pressing on, but if you've got any good words, like news or what have you, while we are, we'd appreciate it.
1604139|CC|Okay. There hasn't been a lot of news, but I'll read you what we've got. President - former President Truman is still holding on. His heartbeat, breathing, and temperature all became unstable yesterday, but then he improved again. A Methodist minister in Kansas City said, "He's a rugged guy who's hanging in there and he's going to make it." The headlines were full of reports of the find of orange dirt and the rest of your adventures yesterday. Internationally, the U.S. and North Vietnam held intensified secret peace talks, and Henry Kissinger prepared to return to Washington probably this afternoon, I understand, after a final session with Le Duc Tho. The French press said a compromise was in the works on the withdrawal of North Vietnamese troops from the South. The Houston Rockets lost to Buffalo up in Buffalo last night, but the hockey team, the Aeros, took a 6 to 4 win over the Alberta Oilers. In - Really, that's about it on the news, except maybe for the weather, which finally broke. The cold front cleared out the drizzly rain last night, and for the first time since you've launched - that I can remember anyway - we've been able to look up and see the Moon, directly. It's a pretty sight as always. That's not much of a report, but that's about all we have. Over.
1604333|CDR|Okay; thank you. What's the date today?
1604337|CC|It's Wednesday - let's see - Wednesday, the 13th of December.
1604347|CDR|Thank you.
1604348|CC|Right now, it's about 01:35 in the afternoon.
1604400|CDR|Okay; just take a quick peek up there. I can't really see too much of the North American continent. South America looks pretty good. And it might be my eyeballs rather than the - the clouds up there, but it looks like most of the clouds are up into the north-central part of the southwestern or southeastern United States.
1604424|CC|I have a satellite picture here, and that's about the way it looks.
1604433|CDR|Well, it's sunny and pleasant on the valley of Taurus-Littrow. And, Gordo, what is our Sun angle going out today?
1604452|CC|I'll get you an answer on that. Couple of questions. First of all, the Surgeon would like a biomed right. And they were wondering how your hands feel this morning?
1604508|CDR|Hands are in good shape, Gordo. No problem.
1604513|CC|Okay; that sounds good. Sun is getting up there about 33 degrees now.
1604620|CDR|Okay; we'll go a biomed left, and both PLSSs have been topped off.
1604638|CDR|Gordy, the LMP isn't hooked up right now. He will be shortly. So stand by on the biomed.
1604644|CC|Okay. Say, I have a few words on the Command Module trajectory that might be of interest, although it doesn't affect your procedures any.
1604702|CDR|Go ahead.
1604704|CC|Okay. The com - the command module orbit somehow is missing all the mascons, and it's not de - degrading into a circular like we thought it would. It's just staying where it was, about a 70 by 50. And so what we're planning on is an extra little maneuver about 1 hour prior to the normal plane change, which will lower the Command Module altitude at the plane change node to - to 60. This will be about a 11 feet per second RCS burn. And then Ron will do the plane change at the normal time, but it'll be little bigger than - that we had planned. I think the last half was about 365 feet per second for plane change. And we've checked the consumables. That puts the RCS right on the preflight line. He's been running about 4 or 5 percent above it. That will use up that pad there, put him back to nor - nominal on RCS, and on the SPS, that puts you right down on the CSM rescue redline; so, really no problem. In good shape, consumablewise. Over.
1604836|CDR|Okay. Sounds like a good rendezvous posture.
1612131|LMP|Okay, Houston. You got any updates to the EVA cuff checklist?
1612131|CC|No, I don't think there is, Jack. Although I do have a wri - write-in for the Lunar Surface Checklist, and one that you really don't need to write in on the prep card. Over.
1612131|LMP|Go ahead.
1612131|CC|Okay. Page 5-10 on the Lunar Surface Checklist. The reason for this change is to prevent cabin pressure from increasing. It got up to 5-7 yesterday. And it also - will also prevent water sep spindown like happened yesterday, if you happen to have the hose - the return hose blocked against the wall outlet there. The change is to write in on the upper left corner of 5-10, just prior to "SUIT isOL, ACTUATOR OVERRIDE (SUIT DISCONNECT)." Write in "PRESSURE REGS A and B to EGRESS." And then down five lines, where it says "CABIN GAS RETURN, EGRESS," change it to "CABIN GAS RETURN, AUTO." Verify. Over.
1612131|LMP|Okay, Gordy. At the top of the page, "REGS A and B to EGRESS," and then five lines down, "CABIN GAS, RETURN, AUTO. Verify."
1612131|CC|That's right. And the only other change I have is - has to do with matching - just like yesterday, - matching the purge valve to the OPS to maximize the OPS capability. And we can just call you when you get to that point. It's - Or if you want to write it down, you need 211, and Geno needs 208.
1612131|LMP|Okay. We've got that.
1612131|CC|Okay. That's all.
1612131|LMP|Okay, Gordy. I guess we play the cuff checklist just as planned, with the exception of the bag numbers which have changed, the collection bag numbers. I have more or less repaired the -sample bag holder on my camera. It's taped on there pretty well with good tape, believe it or not, off the fruit bag. I - I don't know that we have any other outstanding hardware problems. I think in terms of sampling, Gene and I will try
1612131||to shift the emphasis in the mantle area to fragments that are different from the gabbros that we've sampled fairly well, I think, up to now, that presumably are subfloor materials. You might pass that word on and see if they agree with us.
1612131|CC|Okay, Jack. We copy that. And, Jack, if you guys are at a convenient place, sit and listen while you're doing some of your stuff. Let me read up the planning for EVA 3 and the summary of what we think we have so far.
1612131|LMP|Go ahead.
1612526|CC|Okay. I'll read here from this thing just verbatim. It says, "EVA 3 continues to follow essentially the nominal premission plan. Main objectives continue to be the North Massif; Station 6, J; Sculptured Hills; and Van Serg Crater. In view of the extensive observations of the dark mantle and main - and plains subfloor unit on EVA 1 and 2, particularly there before Station 5, the relatively - the relative priority of Station 10 is reduced, so that Station 10 becomes a flexible station as time allotment is a reserve, possibly providing more time at the earlier station, if desired. However, mantle and block sampling at Station 10 are still important objectives. Block pack constraints are not nearly as tight as they were yesterday, guys, and so we can be more flexible in reshuffling station times if we need. We probably won't be coming up against option walkbacks like we did at Station 4. Closeout time at the LM has been increased by 20 minutes to make the closeout less rushed and to allow for potential ALSEP troubleshooting. It is currently planned to take this time from Station 6, 7*"
1612627|CC|But if 6/7 requires more time when we get there,we can borrow it from one of the other stations; I guess, in particular, station 10, probably. As the initial activity then, we are going to have to take explosive package 5 with us, and we'll stick it under the LMP seat, and I'll remind you in real time when we get down on the ground on that one. And number 5, 3 pound, will be deployed at station 10, and again I'll remind you about that in real time, so don't - you don't have to bother to write it in on your checklist. Planned traverse proceeds as normal. We're expecting to spend about an hour and 20 minutes at stations 6 and 7, and the suggestion is that we may end up wanting to spend that totally at the split boulder at station 6, hut, of course, the option still exists to visit more than one place and sample other boulders if it seems feasible and attractive and desirable. They are suggesting additional 500-millimeter photographs, especially if it seems that we can use those to document tracks and sources of docu - of the sampled boulders; for instance, at stations 6 and 7. We are continuing to hold the nominal 47 minutes at station 8 - that is, 8A, and we still think that's as good a place as any to sample the Sculptured Hills. Station 9 is still nominal 30 minutes, but in view of the similarities to the in - to station 4, we're anticipating a possible desirability to remove time from station 10 to enlarge station 9, but that will have to be a real-time decision, based upon what we find at station 9. Station 47 - station 10 continues nominal. We're still interested in sampling the blocks and also interested in - in trenching to try and see - if we can say something about the dark mantle - light area relationship and, perhaps, the nominal coring. We're going to - we're going to deploy EP 5 there; and, other than that, they're basically the same. If we have the time during that closeout, and you'll know if we have enlarged the closeout somewhat, of the LM, based on our experience the last two nights, particularly for dusting; but also, if time permits, in that time we might try and get the - use up the extra double core, if there is one, in the dark mantle near the IM or do some trenching near the IM. But that's only if time permits at the very end, depending upon how the consumables run out. They want to call attention to two particular things here. One, since you guys really haven't gotten any very big rocks so far, they're recommending, they say here, and I quote: "The value of large individual samples has been demonstrated. We recommend that several football-sized samples of a uniform igneous rock be collected at Station 9 or 10." I'll pass that on as that. Another point of interest is the 1- to 20- millimeter size section of the regolith, the dark mantle, the lithology. Then, any observations or collections you can make pertinent to that would be of interest in trying to determine the relationship of the dark mantle to the subfloor units of gabbro underneath. Two short questions which I'll ask, which I hope - hope you can answer in just a very few words. One of them is a yes and no answer. One, we - they can't find the geophone photos specifically called out in the transcript. There is probably a little bit of garble at that point, and the people in the back room will be very happy if you could say once and for all, Jack, that, yes, you did get the geophone photos. Over.
1613003|LMP|Yes.
1613003|CC|Roger. And the second one concerns the 1/4-pound charge which we deployed on the way in last night. Two questions on that. It appears to us from your voice transcript that we weren't fast enough on it at the time that that may be deployed closer to the ALSEP than the one you deployed on the way out. And we'd like an impression on that. And, number 2, you mentioned that you placed it in a depression. We'd like some feeling for that depression in terms of how much of a danger that bomb - charge might play to the AISEP when i t i'oc-j off. If it's in a depression of any sort, thcy'ri' probably pretty well protecting the ALSEP. Any comment on those two questions? Over.
1613047|CDR|Well, the second one. It's not in a major depression. But it is a - maybe a - it's a little ditch, maybe a third of a meter deep. I imagine it will help a little bit. That's why we picked it. Just a second.
1613047|LMP|I'm not sure we understand your first question very much.
1613047|CC|Okay. We have a feeling that when you - -
1613047|CDR|Bob, don't you have the mileages?
1613047|CC|Roger. But there's again some confusion on that.
1613047|CDR|Can't you - can't you pinpoint that?
1613047|CC|Yes, and those mileages also seem to indicate that we had that callout. Remember, you drove back by and you said you saw the flag, and then you said you actually saw the charge inself first. And it was some time after that you said you deployed the charge. And we have the opinion from both that and the mileage that you probably deployed the second charge closer to the ALSEP than the first one. Do you have a - any sort of a feel for that?
1613143|CDR|Oh, yes. I remember saying that, but that's when I did a big 360, and Jack was out of film. And I just lined up to take that picture with him up in the background. And when I said, hey, I saw the charge first. I was really - Don't take that comment too strong.
1613143|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1613143|CDR|As far as position of it, Bob, I - I - we're looking for them out there now. As a matter of fact, we can't see them from here.
1613143|CC|Okay. We'll let it go at that. And that's all the questions and comments we have on today's traverse. We'll have a few real-time things on the surface, which I won't bother you with. A possible fix to the surface electrical properties and a possible trip back to the surface gravimeter, which is still having its problems. But I'll talk with you guys in real time on those when you pet on the surface, rather than bothering you with them now.
1613143|CDR|Hey, Bob. How far should that last charge be from the ALSEP?
1613143|CC|They want it about 300 to 400 meters.
1613143|CC|And, Gene, you ... 0.2 for range when - -
1613143|CDR|Bob, I ... - -
1613143|CC|- - ... got back to the LM. And I guess the question would be, Did you ever go through zero on the way back to the LM? If you are at 0. -if you were at 0.2, and we think 9 - 092 was the bearing, then the LM is right where we thought it was, and we were just a little confused by our distances. Just doesn't quite - they don't quite hold together.
1613143|CDR|No, I don't think I ever went through zero, because I initiated at the SEP.
1613143|CC|Okay.
1613143|CDR|And, no, I didn't go through zero.
1613143|CC|Okay.
1613143|CDR|I'm positive.
1613143|CC|We copy that. Okay. We'll work on that.
1613143|CDR|Is this something to think - Yes, this is something to think about. It's not that far out there. You know, if there is any question about that damaging the ALSEP, it - it's Jur,t hard for us to recall how close they were. And we sort of thought you had them pinpointed for us. But, if you want it 3 to 400 meters, you might think about a late ... - -
1613143|CC|No. We thought about that. We don't - we don't want to do that. No, we don't want to do that. So we'll take care of it. Don't worry about it now. That's all we have. Press on with the prep.
1613143|LMP|Bob, I can - Hey, Bob; this is Jack. I can see the charge with the binocular. It's out almost behind a rock that's between us and the LM, but I can see it. I (laughter) - I mean, a rock between it and the LM. I can't give you any idea, though, how far it is.
1613143|CC|Okay.
1613454|LMP|No, it's the one off to the left. It's the ... -Hey, Bob. Let me say again, I think we ought to emphasize the exotic looking fragments on the dark mantle. And we ought to try to make sure that we look at a variety of rocks from the North Massif. I think we saw the major rock types on the South Massif yesterday, but we really didn't spend a lot of time ranging along the front there to verify that completely. The other comment on the 1- to 20-millimeter size fraction. There isn't an awful lot of that in the dark mantle. That's one of the striking things about it.
1613454|CC|Okay. Copy that. And we'll talk - -
1613454|LMP|But we'll keep our eyes open.
1613454|CC|- - I'll talk with the back room about stations 6 and 7* We'll get with you on that when you get there. And press on.
1613738|LMP|Houston, Challenger. I was BIOMED, RIGHT, there for about 10 minutes, in case you're curious.
1613738|CC|Okay, Jack. And it looked good.
1613738|CDR|Okay, Bob. I've got them both. And the last one we deployed, which I think is the eastern one -easternmost one, is definitely farther out than the first one we deployed. And you know, at this distance, it's awful hard by looking at Jack's geophones. What1s your - I got to give you at least 300 meters, Bob.
1613738|CC|Okay, Geno. Bob's in the back room. I'm sure they're listening, and we got that'.
1613738|CDR|Yes, I - I've got both of them with the monocular now. And the - the second one, the last one we deployed, is quite a bit farther out than the first one.
1613738|CC|Okay. I think that's what they want to hear.
1613738|CDR|Gordo, I guess it's half again or maybe even twice as far away as - as the first we deployed. So we're going to forget it.
1613738|CC|Okay, Geno. That sounds good.
1613738|LMP|And, Gordo, ITm going off the air also here for about 10 minutes. It'll speed things up a little bit.
1613738|CC|Okay. Fine.
1615250|CDR|Houston, Challenger. CDR's now back on.
1615250|CC|Okay, CDR. You're loud and clear.

1624931|CC|We copy that, Geno. And we copy the forward hatch unlocked, right?
1624931|CDR|Yes. Sure did.
1625336|CC|Challenger, Houston. We've lost down-links with you guys. We've got a very weak signal. You might check your configuration up there, please.
1625336|CC|Challenger, Houston in the blind. We've lost down-links with you. Please check your comm con-fi gurat ion. Over.
1625406|LMP|Roger, Bob. We're checking.
1625406|CC|Okay, Challenger. We have you back loud and clear.
1625406|LMP|Okay, Houston. That's - Okay. It looks like I might have hit the YAW knob on the steerable with the PLSS.
1625406|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1625511|CC|Okay. And, Jack, if you want to check those again for numbers, it's PITCH of 14 and YAW of 8, 08.
1625529|LMP|Bob, that doesn't jive with what my needles say. I've got a 20 and - and 50.
1625529|CC|Leave them there. We'll check with you.
1625529|LMP|That's minus 50.
1625820|CC|And, Jack, this is Houston. What's your SIGNAL STRENGTH meter reading there on your high gain, next time you get around to it?
1625820|LMP|We're at 3.8. It's not quite as good as it was. We had about 3-9j I think.
1625820|CC|Okay. Ed thinks maybe you want a side ..., and he's suggesting a PITCH of 14 - 14 - and a YAW of plus 8. Over.
1625846|LMP|Okay. I'll try it.
1625846|CC|Okay, we noticed that. Let's just leave her there, please. Go to SLEW, please.

1631653|LMP|You can feel that rim all the way around. Wait a minute.
1631657|CDR|What?
1631658|LMP|Well, let me - you just ...
1631718|CC|And, Geno, we don't see your fan on yet.
1631723|CDR|It - it'll come on, Bob.
1631725|LMP|There, it's locked.
1631726|CDR|Okay, are the engage marks marked.
1631728|LMP|Well, they are now.
1631730|CDR|Okay.
1631731|LMP|That's in alignment only.
1631733|CDR|Okay, Bob, my FAN's ON. It is locked? Look good to you?
1631737|LMP|It's locked.
1631737|CDR|Good. Okay.
1631740|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 163 hours 17 minutes. We've picked up about 10 minutes on the timeline. Now estimate EVA starting at - in elapsed time of 163 hours 30 minutes, approximately 4:23 Central Standard Time.
1631745|CDR|Get the LEVAs locked. The curtain down and back?
1631802|LMP|Yes. Velcro - Okay. Looks good. Okay, where are we here? Verify white dots plus EVA decals and then - you can don your gloves.
1631807|CDR|Okay.
1631809|LMP|Okay. Why don't you turn that way and let me turn this way?
1631814|CDR|Okay, Jack, I'm going to turn these lights off.
1631816|LMP|Okay.
1631816|CDR|We don't need those.
1631819|LMP|Okay. EVA decals, white dots.
1631825|CDR|Okay, URINE LINE HEATER's going to come off, and the breaker is OUT. Okay.
1631837|LMP|Okay, I'm ready, except for TC pump - LCG pump.
1631843|CDR|Okay, leave it on. We can don our gloves now.
1631845|LMP|Okay.
1631951|LMP|Okay, right glove's LOCKED and verified. Okay, and the wrist cover is on there. On. ... Air is very dirty. Boy, do I need a shave. (Laughter) Okay. I got all mine down.
1632038|CDR|You all set?
1632039|LMP|Well, I got my left hand. Got the left hand. Now, let's see what I can do with the right hand. Almost tempted to take those cover gloves off today.
1632057|CDR|I might take a look at that, too. I hate to argue with success, but I need that dexterity today. Bob, I don't know if you caught it yesterday - a little interesting facet of the whole 2-EVA exercise was the fact that I've already worn -
1632141|CC|Gene, you dropped out there right in the middle.
1632155|CC|Challenger, Houston. We - you dropped out there.
1632217|CDR|Okay, Bob. How do you read now?
1632219|CC|Loud and clear, Gene.
1632223|CDR|Okay, I hit the VOX switch on my audio panel.
1632225|LMP|You did?
1632233|CDR|Yes, when I picked up my glove. Okay, Bob, the only thing I said - little point of interest, I wore the RTV off the - not all of it - but right through the bare metal on the hammer - someday - some time in the previous 2 days. No problem; it just interests me.
1632249|CC|Okay, copy that. And copy that you still have you cover gloves on today, right?
1632255|CDR|Yes, sir. I'll tell you, we have become very respectful of the dust.
1632300|CC|Copy that.
1632302|LMP|Oh, yes, cover gloves, yes - We've also got the - we've also got the wrist dust - dust covers on, too.
1632308|CC|Roger. Strike a blow for Mason jar rings.
1632311|LMP|What's left of the - and what's left of the cover gloves.
1632317|CDR|Okay, Jack, you're on?
1632318|LMP|I'm on.
1632318|CDR|And locked?
1632320|LMP|And locked.
1632320|CDR|Well, I just - I got my thing on - I want to make sure I'm locked again. Yes, I am. I took it off again. Well, I was. Talking and you just do things - Okay. Don EV gloves. Cover, okay. PGA biting? No. Okay. LCG cold as required, and LCG PUMP, OPEN. I guess you can open it.
1632345|LMP|Yes, and disconnect the LM - -
1632347|CDR|Okay. LCG pump, water hose. And I got a tone but that's because I turned my oxygen on briefly. Okay. Okay, PUMP's OPEN. Turn around here and help you.
1632401|LMP|You can - you can take the water off.
1632403|CDR|Water's off.
1632404|LMP|Are the pumps off?
1632407|CDR|Okay, your water's off. ... that there for a minute. Okay, hang on. Okay, you're in and locked. ... over nicely. Okay?
1632430|LMP|Okay.
1632435|CDR|You're off. I'll lay that there. Where's your water? Here it is way over here.
1632457|CDR|Hold on. Okay, I'm locked and your cover's on. I got to zap my PGA. Wait a minute, I'm biting here.
1632517|LMP|Okay.
1632519|CDR|Let me try and stow this. Okay.
1632535|LMP|Okay, verify your PLSS is - WATER'S MIN when you get a chance.
1632541|CDR|Okay, that's verified. Did that a minute ago.
1632544|LMP|And mine's verified and your pump on.
1632549|CDR|Okay, PUMP's going ON.
1632554|LMP|Mine ON. PRESSURE REG A, B, to EGRESS.
1632557|CDR|Okay, they are EGRESS.
1632600|LMP|Okay, pressure integrity check. Ready?
1632606|CDR|Let me ...
1632608|LMP|Okay.
1632615|CDR|Awful lot of line there, isn't there?
1632617|LMP|Um hmm.
1632621|CDR|- exactly what to do with it. ... Okay.
1632633|LMP|All right. You happy?
1632635|CDR|Yes.
1632635|LMP|PRESSURE REGs A, B, to EGRESS.
1632637|LMP|They are EGRESS.
1632638|CDR|Okay; Put your PLSS O2 water - No.
1632644|LMP|ON, now. MARK it.
1632646|CDR|PLSS O2 ON.
1632647|LMP|PLSS O2 ON.
1632648|CDR|Right?
1632649|LMP|Okay, it's on.
1632650|CDR|Okay, and mines on. We'll wait till it builds us up. Press flag should clear at 3.1 to 3.4, O2 flag you're clear at 3.7 of 4.0.
1632717|LMP|Okay, I'm coming up. Hope the old suit integrity is just as good as it has been.
1632732|LMP|I don't see why not.
1632751|CDR|Coming up?
1632752|LMP|Yes.
1632759|LMP|About 3.5 now.
1632804|CDR|Yes, me too. Okay, let me know when you are up.
1632812|LMP|I think I'm up; I'm 3.8.
1632813|CDR|Okay, let's see if we can't get these -
1632823|CDR|I can't get yours.
1632824|LMP|I can't -
1632826|CDR|Okay, mine's OFF.
1632827|LMP|Mine's OFF -
1632828|CDR|MARK it.
1632831|LMP|We want to decay for 1 minute.
1632832|CDR|Okay, I started at 3.83.
1632834|LMP|Okay. That's about exactly where I was. Another 45 seconds to go.
1632843|CDR|Okay. So far, it looks as tight as it was yesterday.
1632904|LMP|Another 30 seconds. Maybe lunar dust is a good sealant.
1632927|CDR|Houston, CDR ... at 3.82 to 2.70.
1632932|LMP|2.70? 3.70.
1632934|CDR|3.70.
1632935|CC|Understand 3.70.
1632935|LMP|Okay, LMP was - LMP was - .83 to .70.
1632948|CDR|Okay, Jack. You can get your O2 on.
1632951|LMP|It's on.
1632952|CDR|Okay. Can you move to the left a little bit - to your left? I got to get in front here.
1632956|CC|Okay, you're GO from here -
1632957|CDR|Okay, let me turn this over.
1632959|CC|17, you copy - ...
1633000|CDR|Okay, stand by. Okay, it's a heck of a time to have to turn the checklist over. Okay, we've got a GO for depress, On 16, CABIN REPRESS, OPEN, and CABIN REPRESS valve, CLOSED.
1633015|LMP|Okay.
1633015|CDR|The breaker open and the valve closed.
1633018|LMP|Okay, stand by, Can you give me a little room -
1633022|CDR|Let me - Okay, how's that?
1633024|LMP|Okay, Okay, REPRESS is OPEN.
1633031|CDR|Okay, now, why don't you face the wall over there and move in as close and I'll get the overhead valve.
1633036|LMP|Wait a minute, I've got to close the REPRESS valve. You got it all right. Okay, it's CLOSED and I'll get where I was yesterday.
1633046|CDR|Okay.
1633047|LMP|How's that?
1633054|CDR|We'll find out in a minute.
1633057|LMP|Okay. I've got to get my PLSS.
1633101|CDR|Can you get it?
1633105|LMP|Well, can't ... I can turn with my back to the wall and you might have a little more -
1633115|CDR|Well, I think - I feel like I'm hooked on something. Wait. I can't turn either way - stay where you are. There - Okay.
1633134|CDR|Okay, the safety - Oh, boy, I'm glad I'm not an inch shorter. Okay, coming down, Jack. You ready?
1633143|LMP|Go ahead, to 3.5.
1633146|CDR|Okay, it's OPEN.
1633147|LMP|Okay, 4.5, 4, Stand by.
1633152|LMP|MARK.
1633154|CDR|AUTO.
1633154|LMP|Okay, at 3.5.
1633157|CDR|Can you read - the checklist?
1633159|LMP|Okay, I can. Okay. OPEN, AUTO 3.5 cuff checklist - cuff gage does not drop below 4.6, it hasn't.
1633211|CDR|Mine's good.
1633213|LMP|... you put your hand down. I can't read it.
1633214|CDR|Okay.
1633215|LMP|Cabin is holding at 3.5. And suit circuit's locked up at 4.5 and PGA is decaying greater than 4.5 - 4.6, okay.
1633234|CDR|Okay, Bob, I'm starting my watch.
1633239|CC|We're GO.
1633241|LMP|Okay. You can go to - go to OPEN.
1633248|CDR|Okay, it's OPEN.
1633248|PAO|EVA start time, 163 hours, 32 minutes, 36 seconds.
1633249|LMP|Okay, and pressure is gone up. And the next step is, when you open the forward hatch.
1633258|CDR|Okay, my suit's relieving.
1633304|LMP|Down to almost 1.5 now.
1633317|LMP|... psi. Okay, my relief valve just seated at 5.3.
1633336|CDR|Okay, where are we?
1633337|LMP|We're at 0.5.
1633340|CDR|I guess the next thing is to open the hatch, huh?
1633342|LMP|Yep.
1633348|CDR|I've got to get down out of 5.2 here before I can turn too well and open the hatch. I'm going to let it come down a little bit this time so I don't get down there unnecessarily.
1633357|LMP|Yes. It's got a ways to go yet.
1633410|LMP|About 0.3 now.
1633434|LMP|0.2.
1633434|CDR|I've got a tone and it's water tone. Okay, I'm going to go after that hatch. Can you slip to the right as far as you can? Got it.
1633457|LMP|Got to hold it until the pressure decreases. All sorts of junk going out there. Ice.
1633512|CDR|Okay, now. Okay. It's partially open.
1633516|LMP|Okay, get your water if you can.
1633521|CC|Okay, Jack. We'd like you to close REG A, please.
1633527|LMP|Oh, close REG A, huh?
1633531|CC|That's affirm.
1633532|LMP|Okay, stand by. That's not an easy task.
1633545|LMP|REG A is CLOSED. Gene, can you get my water?
1633549|CDR|Yes.
1633608|LMP|Did you get in there?
1633612|CDR|Okay, it's OPEN.
1633613|LMP|Okay. LMP's WATER is OPEN. You got yours.
1633615|CDR|Yes, I got mine. Excuse me. Well, let's see.
1633623|LMP|Okay, you got it open, so I need to turn around. See if I can back in and out of the way of the door.
1633629|CDR|Say, Rob - Bob, what did you see in REG A?
1633634|CC|Stand by, Gene. We're seeing high suit pressures, stand by.
1633640|LMP|High suit pressure?
1633644|CC|Okay, and about your - -
1633645|CDR|... Yes, I'm seeing about your -
1633646|CC|Challenger, Gene, you're GO to go out, and once you get out, maybe Jack can turn around and work on those a bit better. We're seeing, I guess, the suit loop's a little high in pressure.
1633655|LMP|Okay.
1633658|CDR|Okay, I'm looking at 4 - at about 4.7 on the suit loop right now.
1633703|CC|Okay; we copy that.
1633704|CDR|Okay, Jack, You're a - there you go.
1633720|LMP|I'll get it.
1633729|CDR|Okay, turn.
1633744|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The reference is to the suit loop in the Lunar Module - not to the pressure suits themselves.
1633752|CDR|Okay. What does it look like to you?
1633756|LMP|Well, you're - you're doing great; keep down. Just a little hangup on the DSKY.
1633804|CDR|I need to get my arm down there.
1633806|LMP|Okay, you need to go to your left a little to clear the purse and your harness. There we go.
1633817|CDR|Jack, you see this? This is one of those cards that - -
1633820|LMP|Yes, I saw that, Gene -
1633822|CDR|I'll put it right there.
1633824|LMP|... Can you come forward just a little?
1633827|CDR|Forward?
1633829|LMP|That clip got away. Come towards - in the cabin - there.
1633834|CDR|Okay?
1633834|LMP|Wait a minute. Okay, I got it. Okay, you're in good shape.
1633848|CDR|Okay, I'm on the porch. Whew - I'm still at 4.3.
1633857|CC|Roger. on that.
1633857|CDR|Okay, I'm on the porch, Bob.
1633858|CC|Copy that.
1633859|LMP|Okay, what do you want? What can I do for you, Bob?
1633904|CC|Stand by Jack. We'll get a word to you in one minute.
1633911|CDR|Okay, Jack, in that - Well, I guess that'll wait. Get my LEC ready for you. Okay. And everything looks normal on me, right now. Let me get the pressure down a little bit.
1633942|CDR|Things norm, except a part of my nose itches I can't get to.
1633949|LMP|I'll give you the jett bag anyway, Geno, while they're thinking. I guess that's part of - R&D. Oh, yes, the jett bag.
1634003|CDR|Santa Claus' bag again.
1634004|CC|Okay, Jack. We'd like to have you stay in just a minute or so longer. We're trying to keep track here of the suit circuit pressure and see if it stabilizes or starts to drop. The one reg which has been intermittently leaking - we still haven't isolated it. And we think we've got it shut off, but we're still watching it. So bear with us just a minute or so.
1634026|LMP|I'm bearing, Bob.
1634028|CDR|Hey, what else - -
1634029|LMP|I thought you isolated it last night. Okay. Let me give you the ETB.
1634035|CDR|Yes. Give me that and I'll be on my way - working on the TGE. Okay, got it.
1634047|CC|Okay, Jack, and how about taking the SUIT CIRCUIT RELIEF valve - cycle it just to OPEN and then back to AUTO.
1634100|LMP|Okay, Bob, stand by.
1634107|LMP|SUIT CIRCUIT RELIEF going OPEN, then AUTO. That's done.
1634116|CC|Okay, we'll watch it for a minute here and let you know.
1634123|CDR|Okay, Bob. I'm going down the ladder.
1634125|CC|Roger, Geno.
1634140|CDR|Well, still there, Jack. "Godspeed the crew of Apollo 17."
1634146|LMP|Good.
1634148|CC|Amen there, Gene. Amen.
1634152|CDR|Okay, Bob, I'm on the pad. And it's about 4:30, a Wednesday afternoon, as I step out on to the plains of Taurus-Littrow, beautiful valley. The first thing I'll do is I'll turn the TGE on, and I'll give you a reading.
1634212|CC|Okay; we're ready.
1634214|CDR|And I'm very much interested - very much interested in my Rover batteries.
1634218|CC|And, Jack, you're GO for exit and looks like we've got it taken care of.
1634226|LMP|Okay, and I'm checking the circuit breakers.
1634240|CDR|It's on and reads - Bob, it reads 222, 262, 207; 222, 262, 207.
1634252|CC|Okay, I copy that, Geno.
1634303|LMP|Okay, get the visor down, Geno.
1634307|CDR|Get the visor down - Holy Smoly. Think it'd be better to leave it up. Beautiful out here today, Bob. We can look to the east for a change - a little bit, anyway.
1634321|CC|Okay, copy that, Gene.
1634322|CDR|A higher Sun angle. Okay, I'll get the LCRU battery changed out.
1634331|CC|Okay. And as you walk by there, if you walk by in the right side of the Rover, how about giving us a SEP temperature read-out, please.
1634348|CDR|SEP temperature is 103 degrees.
1634353|CC|Copy, 103.
1634355|CDR|103, and the mirror is still clean.
1634357|CC|Copy that.
1634404|CDR|Well, let's see if I can change this little baby now. Supposed to be simple. Bob, we have no use for the old battery, right?
1634422|CC|That's affirm.
1634450|LMP|Okay. I'm on the porch and the hatch is CLOSED.
1634502|CDR|Oh, don't step into that.
1634506|LMP|Are you talking to me or you?
1634507|CDR|I'm talking to me.
1634536|LMP|Okay, that sounds familiar and looks familiar - the old plain. The valley of the Taurus-Littrow.
1634551|LMP|You want to get your antenna?
1634553|CDR|Yes, let me get that -
1634553|LMP|I'll come over there.
1634555|CDR|I'll get the TV on. I've already got the battery changed.
1634615|LMP|There's the Earth right in the middle of the antenna. Okay, verify MODE 3 - I am in MODE 3; LCRU blankets are open 100 percent, battery covers I'm closing, the battery - let me close it. Yes, you can probably get my antenna.
1634633|LMP|Wait a minute. Let me set this down.
1634634|CDR|Yes, okay.
1634644|LMP|Okay, stay there.
1634648|CDR|I was just try - I'm trying to.
1634656|LMP|Okay.
1634710|LMP|Okay, your antenna's up. Wait a minute. Come here and I'll snap the snap.
1634718|CDR|Okay.
1634733|LMP|Didn't mean to do that.
1634734|CDR|That's all right. I can't get close enough to you.
1634736|LMP|Here you are.
1634739|CDR|Lean a little more. Antenna's up. Let me get the snap.
1634752|CC|And, 17, if you guys are interested, your shadows will be 8 feet long tonight.
1634801|LMP|How many meters is that, Bob?
1634804|CDR|I'll draw it out - I'll step it out for you. You can measure it. (Laughter)
1634808|LMP|Well, I don't know. Should I take my gloves off? I mean my cover gloves.
1634813|CDR|Why don't you leave them on for a while and see where we're going. See what the boulder field looks like up there.
1634817|LMP|Well, I know what it's going to look like.
1634820|CDR|No, you don't.
1634821|LMP|The point is my hands will be much better off without them.
1634823|CDR|Take them off, then. Okay, battery covers are closed and tight. High gain is already oriented. Oh, they've even got TV, I guess.
1634849|CC|That's affirm.
1634855|CC|And, Geno, when you push the Rover circuit breakers in, how about giving us a battery temperature reading on the Rover batts.
1634901|CDR|Tell them what my batteries are reading if I can.
1634904|LMP|Well, let me see if I can do something else while I'm waiting.
1634906|CDR|No, I'm done, Jack.
1634912|LMP|I'll get the old SEP receiver.
1634914|CDR|Well, Bob, the - battery 1 is 95 degrees and the - battery 2 is reading zero. So we got a gage failure. No, it's not reading zero; it's off scale low.
1634936|CC|Okay, read that - copy that. That's a real cooldown, isn't it? Okay, Jack, if you're going to worry about the SEP, stand by and don't do the SEP until after you worry with the ETB, and we'll get to you on that. When you get the ETB to the seat, I'll talk to you about it.
1634952|LMP|Okay, it's - 1 - 1 - 102 is the temperature.
1634957|CC|Okay; copy that.
1634959|CDR|Okay, Bob. Mark.
1635001|CC|MARK.
1635003|CDR|MARK gravimeter; it's flashing.
1635005|CC|Copy that.
1635011|CDR|Okay, we'll take the big bag. I hope we can keep it on.
1635019|LMP|...
1635019|CC|Okay. A couple of things on that, Geno. You might try tapping the thing to see if that loosens the dust. There's also the hook business on the inside of the pallet that you could hook it on. Caution: if you open the pallet, be careful not to knock the clamps off the fender. But you can also reach over the pallet to put the big bag on.
1635044|CDR|Okay, Bob. We - I brushed it and tapped it yesterday, I'm not sure we're going to have much luck with them.
1635049|CC|Say again there, Gene.
1635054|CDR|I brushed them and tapped them yesterday.
1635057|CC|Okay; copy that. You might want to put the big bag on the inside of the pallet there, if you can't operate them.
1635105|CDR|Okay.
1635110|LMP|Okay, mag Kilo goes on the 500; is that correct?
1635115|CC|That's affirm.
1635121|LMP|Okay, I've got Mary and Franny and Nancy - and Donna - and Bobby and - -
1635143|CDR|Jack, I'm also going to keep this in there.
1635147|LMP|- - Karen.
1635147|CDR|Because it's too hard to get off the front end. We'll find a place for that in there.
1635154|LMP|Well, okay.
1635156|CDR|It's just too hard to get off the front end. Okay, let's see. Big bag to gate, dustbrush to - Let me get that big bag on the inside of the gate if I can. Inside the gate or the pallet, Bob?
1635209|CC|Inside the pallet. My - My fault there.
1635212|LMP|That - that's - the pallet, the pallet -
1635216|CDR|Yes.
1635216|CC|And if you open the pallet, be careful of the clamp. Probably, if it's feasible, we suggest you reach across in front of the pallet - reach across the pallet to do it. Instead of opening it because of the clamp on the fender.
1635233|CDR|It's not feasible. It's not feasible to do that. I got to open it, plus our hook is - overcenter. Let me get something to work on that with. You know, Bob, how that pallet locking hook can - can be out of the little C-shaped - release in there? it is.
1635300|CC|Oh, boy.
1635304|CDR|I noticed that yesterday.
1635316|CC|Jack. When you get done with the ETB, then you might save the gray tape out. We're going to use a little bit of that on the SEP when you get done.
1635345|LMP|When are you going to do that?
1635348|CC|We'll turn the - -
1635350|LMP|What am I supposed to do, stand - well -
1635351|CC|We'll turn both switches on when you're out at the SEP transmitter.
1635356|LMP|Well, the tape is in the CDRs seat, and it'll still be there.
1635400|CC|No, we'd like to take the tape from the CDRs seat and use it on the SEP, right now.
1635407|LMP|Okay. You want me to do it or Gene to do it?
1635414|CC|Why don't you do it since the tape is there. No, let's - let's let Gene do it. Doesn't really matter. Whoever wants to.
1635426|LMP|Okay, We'll get it.
1635429|CDR|Okay, Bob, the big bag is on the inside of the - of the pallet.
1635441|CC|Okay; we copy that.
1635443|LMP|Why won't it close?
1635448|CDR|The - And I know why. This is a ... that's on the way, Jack. Get rid of this thing. We don't need it anyway. Okay, opening and closing of the pallets didn't interfere at all with those fenders.
1635514|CC|Okay; copy that.
1635516|LMP|These aren't clamped down - Now the tape.
1635520|CDR|Okay. The big bag is on the inside, though.
1635525|LMP|Yes, but it's - also in the way. Okay, I got it.
1635528|CDR|Sure is. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't close it.
1635531|LMP|Want me to get out of the way?
1635532|CDR|I'll open it. See, it drags over that locking device. Okay, let me just see what we got to do here. Okay. Big bag, dustbrush, SCB-7 to gate, mount 20-bag dispenser on commander's camera, 20-bag dispenser to the LMP, core cap dispenser to the gate.
1635611|CC|Okay. And, Jack, are you going out to take the pan now?
1635617|LMP|Well, as soon as I finish up here.
1635620|CC|Okay.
1635620|LMP|I'll do that.
1635621|CC|And after you take the pan, we'd like you to retrieve the cosmic ray experiment. They're expecting a little solar storm, and before the rain gets on the cosmic ray experiment, they'd like to retrieve it. We'll leave it in the ETB during the traverse.
1635640|LMP|Okay, after the pan. All right.
1635642|CC|Roger. It will just be a nominal retrieval and we'll put it in the ETB. Copy the gate.
1635650|LMP|Okay.
1635703|CDR|Okay.
1635725|CDR|Okay, SCB-7 - 20-bag dispenser goes on my camera when it gets back. Short can under the LMP's seat. Okay. Jack, I'll just go ahead and mount some of these bags on your camera while I'm here.
1635745|LMP|Okay. Thank you.
1635758|CC|Okay. And, Gene, if you got time there with the camera, why don't we - when you get done with the camera, how about getting some gray tape and we'll put you to work on SEP for about a minute.
1635812|CDR|The SEP receiver?
1635813|CC|That's affirm. And if you get - -
1635818|CDR|Stand by. Let me finish with SCB-7 here.
1635820|CC|Okay. And did you get Jack's camera fixed last night? I didn't hear.
1635825|CDR|Yes, we did. Okay, there is already one on the gate. Leave that one there. Okay, SCB-7 to gate, 20-bag dispenser on commander's - camera, we'll do it when I get back - 20 bags on the LMPs camera, core cap dispenser to gate - there's one there, there's one under the seat - short cans under the LMP's seat. Okay, I got to put that cap dispenser on him, I got to get my rammer, hammer - Hey, Bob, what bag do you want on the LMP? Do we ave 8 here?
1635913|CC|Stand by. I think 8 went in, either 4 or 6. No, excuse me; either 5 or 4.
1635923|CDR|Okay. We'll put either 4 or 5 on there. Okay. I'll have to wait until he gets back. What do you want? Or let me give you TGE reading and get that out of the way and then I'll work on your SEP.
1635933|CC|Okay; copy that.
1635947|CDR|Okay. 670, 027, 001; that's 670, 027, 001.
1635957|CC|Okay; copy that, Gene. Thank you.
1640016|CDR|Fender wrinkled up in the Sun a little bit last night.
1640019|LMP|Okay -
1640020|LMP|MARK it. The cosmic ray is terminated.
1640024|CC|Copy that.
1640027|LMP|And, Bob, I took two 5-foot stereopairs of the configuration.
1640034|CC|Copy. And we'll stick it in the ETB and just hang it there.
1640043|LMP|Yes. And in case you're wondering, and so you don't confuse it with a rock, it's in bag 106.
1640053|CC|Copy that.
1640057|CDR|Okay. What do you want done to the SEP?
1640101|CC|Okay. Take some gray tape over to the receiver, Gene. And with reference to the fact that the - there is some Velcro missing on the front there which hold the covers down, we'd like to tape the two covers together - on the - in the middle there - you know, where the two - two sides overlap in the middle of the box. Tape those two together. A short piece about an inch long should do it if they are clean.
1640127|CDR|Well, I doubt if the tape will stick because it doesn't on dust, but I mlight be able to go over it with one piece to clean it and another piece to tape it.
1640134|CC|Okay. And the question beyond that, is there Velcro to hold one of those flaps down or not?
1640142|CDR|No.
1640144|CC|Okay, so both pieces - the Velcro is missing from both flaps, I take it.
1640150|CDR|Yes.
1640150|LMP|Bob, what happened was that the tape that held the lower Velcro on there apparently came loose, and it stuck to the upper Velcro.
1640200|CC|Okay. I understand that. In that case, we'd like to take a piece of tape and tape the cover down to keep it closed when it's not - when it's supposed to be closed. The feeling is that if the cover flaps partly open, you may get specular reflection off the inside of the Mylar down onto the mirrors causing it to heat up during the drive when it's supposed to be closed.
1640224|CDR|Okay, we'll give it a try.
1640225|CC|Okay; thank you. And, Jack, if you're done you might go rescue EP number 5 from the footpad, and we'll put it under the LMP's seat.
1640245|LMP|Well, be a lot of other things under there. Okay. I'll rescue it; we'll see where the best place to put it is.
1640252|CC|Okay.
1640253|LMP|Hey, I got - I got bags on you - I got bags on your camera, Geno.
1640258|CDR|Okay; thank you.
1640306|LMP|Okay, we're going to put those two bags on the rear there on your PLSSs?
1640312|CC|One of them will go - -
1640313|CDR|... those two on.
1640315|LMP|Okay.
1640315|CC|The one under LMPs seat will go on the CDR, the one with all the stuff in it.
1640322|CDR|Yes, I got core tubes in 7 here, Jack. We'll put either one of those - -
1640325|LMP|Okay. So I can't put the charge under my seat.
1640331|CC|That's affirm, I think, Jack, once you get SCB-7 out of there.
1640336|LMP|Yes, I feel like a kid stuck in taffy.
1640402|LMP|Sure is strange not to see some fine-grained rocks out here. Seen a couple but certainly not very many.
1640409|CC|Copy that.
1640419|LMP|That rock that you picked up at - What are you doing up there? Okay.
1640432|CDR|Bob, that'll hold it down. I hope it solves the problem.
1640436|CC|Roger. And so does Dr. Strangelove.
1640448|PAO|The storm reference is a minor solar flare which represents no danger to the crew, but could affect the very sensitive cosmic ray experiment.
1640459|LMP|Okay.
1640459|CDR|Well, probably not any more than we would like to see it solved.
1640506|LMP|Bob - Nothing. Gene, your bag's going to have two lowers and one upper.
1640520|CC|Did you re-sort things there, Jack?
1640525|LMP|What's that?
1640526|CC|Did you re-sort things in SCB-7? I was told - -
1640528|LMP|I said I got - Bob, I - Go ahead.
1640541|CC|Okay. Our understanding was there were two uppers and one lower in bag 7, and two lowers under the LMP seat. Did you re-sort things there?
1640551|LMP|Do you want - how do you want them?
1640552|CC|It doesn't matter to us. I just wanted to make sure that we know what you are so we don't let you get away too far with two uppers and a lower. Two lowers and an upper is certainly better than two uppers and a lower. As long as we know what it is.
1640606|LMP|Okay. It's two lowers and an upper.
1640608|CC|Got that.
1640610|LMP|Two lowers and an upper. Man, I'm confused.
1640613|CDR|Okay. When you're ready, I'll configure you.
1640615|LMP|Okay, here, let me - let me get this on you first since I got - -
1640618|CDR|Okay.
1640622|LMP|And I'm going to ask you to turn a - 180 degrees because you're up on a hill. I'll never be able to do it.
1640630|CDR|How's that? I'm down in a hole now.
1640632|LMP|That's beautiful.
1640658|PAO|Jack Schmitt attaching traverse equipment to Gene Cernan's backpack.
1640659|LMP|Okay, ... Can't get this fixed.
1640708|LMP|Tallest man on the Moon right now. Okay, that's done.
1640713|CDR|Okay?
1640714|LMP|Just a second. Let me close the cover. Not a very good cover. Okay.
1640720|CDR|Okay, Bob, I'm going to put SCB-4 on Jack.
1640729|LMP|Go ahead.
1640730|CC|Say again there, Gene. SCB-6? SCB-4; copy.
1640736|CDR|SC - SCB-4 will go on Jack. Okay, Jack, I got to get these PLSS straps too. Did you get mine?
1640744|LMP|No.
1640745|CDR|Those harness release straps?
1640747|LMP|Oh, no. Let's do that. I saw them as you go out, and then I forget about them.
1640750|CDR|Yes. Okay, yours is on over here. Probably a better time to do them, anyway, rather than when we go out. Okay, let me get the bag. I'll get the other one when I configure your other side. Okay, you're on. Okay, want to get my PLSS straps? Then I'll be cleaned up, and then I finish your other side.
1640831|LMP|Let me get the other one. Warmer out here today. ... treatment on the hands. Okay.
1640847|CDR|Okay, stay right where you are so I can get this.
1640852|PAO|EVA time, 36 minutes.
1640913|CDR|Okay, Now come over here, and I'll get you a core cap dispenser, which I left here. Okay, you got SCB-4, you got the cap, you got the rammer, I'll take the hammer. You got the - That's all you need. TGE is on the LRV. Okay, what transport what charge you got there, Jack?
1640945|LMP|Five is under my seat.
1640947|CDR|Five, okay, You got 5 there, we got 2 and 3 on the Rover, LCRU blankets are open 100 percent, battery covers are closed. I want to - Push that battery cover over there down just to make sure it goea down.
1641002|LMP|The warning flag is up ...
1641004|CDR|It's probably that - Already, huh? Yes. ... down on there.
1641008|LMP|Rover - Rover warning was up.
1641012|CDR|Get one right there.
1641013|LMP|It's down.
1641014|CDR|I'll take a look at that gage again, but the gage on the high battery looked like it may have failed. Okay, LCRU blankets are open, battery covers are closed and pushed closed, dust LCRU -
1641028|LMP|I'm going to the SEP.
1641029|CC|Okay, Jack.
1641029|CDR|Wait a minute before you do. You got a second? Just come over here by the left front wheel. I know you got a second. Just a little bit closer to the left front wheel, towards me. Oh, that's good, anywhere in there. Wait a minute.
1641108|CDR|Can you do that likewise? Or can you hold it with that other camera? It's already set at 30.
1641118|LMP|Okay.
1641119|CDR|And you might want to take a couple - -
1641149|CC|17, Houston. We think somebody lost their comm there. Jack, it's probably Gene going to zero.
1641202|LMP|You read us, Bob?
1641203|CC|Roger. Read you now.
1641207|LMP|Bob, do you read Gene?
1641210|CC|Reading you, Jack. I haven't heard Gene yet.
1641215|LMP|Well, Gene's calling you.
1641218|CC|You read me, G - 
1641219|CDR|How do you read me, Bob?
1641219|CC|Okay, read you now.
1641224|CDR|Okay, I didn't do anything. I Just jiggled my MODE switch here. Okay, we got 2 and 3 on the EPs, plus one under Jack's seat. LCRU blankets are opened 100 percent; battery covers are closed; dustbrush. I've got; TGE, I've got; mags and polarization filter is taken care of; and I'm ready to traverse to the SEP.
1641245|CC|Roger. We understand TGE stowed and you're taken care of in the comm. And you might give us a Rover read-out either now or when you get to the SEP.
1641256|CDR|Okay; we'll see which is convenient.
1641258|CC|Yes. SEP is probably more convenient while you're sitting there waiting for the nav to warm up or initialize - waiting for us to give you the readings.
1641309|CDR|Okay, taking your TV. MODE switch is 1.
1641327|LMP|Hey, Bob, are you watching LMP?
1641330|CDR|Not anymore he isn't. I took the TV.
1641333|LMP|Okay.
1641337|CDR|Bob, you still read?
1641339|CC|Roger. Read you loud and clear. We're now watching the LMP.
1641344|CDR|Okay, I just wondered because I just took the TV. I just want to make sure we got comm here.
1641349|CC|Yes. We're reading you in MODE 1.
1641353|CDR|And, for your information, we both got our cover gloves off.
1641400|CC|Copy that.
1641407|CDR|Okay, that's in, that's in, that's in. Should have dusted my checklist on the Rover. I can't read down there.
1641415|LMP|Bob, the old tape fix on the SEP's still working.
1641418|CC|Beautiful.
1641420|LMP|There's a little - both mirrors have a little angular displacement but not more than 5 degrees.
1641431|CC|Sounds like that's the least of the SEP's problem, but we have hope.
1641500|LMP|Okay, you're going to be over there, huh? I'm over here.
1641511|CDR|I don't believe this.
1641513|LMP|What's the problem?
1641514|CDR|Oh, nothing. That roll indicator isn't worth a dingdong, says I'm rolled 10 degrees.
1641519|CDR|Okay. Roll zero, pitch is zero; heading is 291; distance, 001; range, 000; amps hours are 90 and 85; volts are 65, 65; Sun shadow device, by the way, is 0.
1641545|CC|Copy that.
1641545|CDR|Batteries are 100 and off scale low, and motors are all off scale low.
1641555|CC|Okay, and, Gene, we'd like to torque to 287, 287.
1641604|CDR|Okay; in work. Let's see, 287. That's a heading from Cross City to Tindall. Okay, 27 28, 287 right on the money.
1641620|CC|Copy that, Geno. And - -
1641622|LMP|Bob, 45 - 45 Yankee is a sample - sample from near the SEP.
1641639|CDR|Boy, I tell you, Jack. That was all cut out.
1641646|LMP|Oh, well. I got the sample anyway.
1641650|CC|We copied 45 Yankee near the SEP. That's all we have. If you give us a frame count when you get done, and give us an approximate location for the Rover, at least crosswise from the Y, we'd appreciate it. And we also need SEP receiver power and DSEA both on. And we'd like the cover taped back -taped down when you get done, Jack.
1641721|CDR|Okay, Jack, keep me honest on those reels.
1641725|LMP|Okay, you're okay now. Let me get over on the reel. I don't afee -
1641732|CDR|See me?
1641733|LMP|Come on. You're good.
1641734|CDR|Oh, there's the SEP. Wait - did I miss this other reel?
1641737|LMP|Yes. There's the - I'm on the antenna.
1641743|CDR|What about the one coming west?
1641744|LMP|That's what I - No, you're okay on the one west - you're way away from it.
1641748|CDR|Okay. Going to look back.
1641756|LMP|You want to look - head towards the SEP. You're okay.
1641800|CDR|Oh, I see it now. Okay.
1641801|LMP|Head towards it and then turn - then make your turn.
1641803|CDR|I see it. I'll go over to it.
1641805|LMP|Matter of fact, turn on these tracks.
1641806|CDR|Yes. I'm in good shape. I see it. I see it.
1641815|LMP|Bob, that 45 Yankee was a fine-grained basalt, I think. One of the few around here. That's why I picked it up.
1641827|CC|Copy that.
1641835|LMP|Okay, you stopped?
1641837|CDR|I'm stopped and I'm ready to go. I'm 2 meters to the west of the north line.
1641844|CC|Copy that.
1641847|CDR|And I guess I'm certainly within 5 meters of the transmitter.
1641851|CC|Okay, we'll get that in the photos. And Gene, how's the low gain located - oriented?
1641903|CDR|It's oriented 355 and my heading is 352.
1641908|CC|Okay, copy that.
1641914|CDR|Okay, you want the receiver on - -
1641919|CC|Roger. Both - -
1641919|CDR|- - and taped down again, huh?
1641920|LMP|Yes, ... put ...
1641920|CC|Roger. Both the receiver and the recorder on, both switches on and then tape the cover down.
1641931|LMP|Okay, good luck.
1641936|CDR|I don't know if that tape is going to hold. Okay, ON and ON. Okay, it's taped down more or less.
1641953|CC|Thank you. Thank you.
1641955|LMP|And then I guess I'm supposed to get on, huh?
1641957|CC|Roger on that.
1641958|CDR|Okay, Bob, the NAV RESET has been - NAV RESET is now OFF and I'm all zeroed up.
1642007|CC|Okay. Copy that. And we're ready for you guys to roll.
1642015|CDR|Okay, what's the first range and bearing to the Rover sample, past Jones?
1642022|CC|Okay, it will be 185 and 1.5 on the range.
1642031|CDR|Okay, 185 and 1.5. 185 and 1-1/2. Okay.
1642042|LMP|Excuse me, Gene.
1642044|CDR|No problem.
1642052|LMP|Well, shoot. I've forgotten how.
1642101|CDR|Boy, that Challenger looks pretty from here, you know it.
1642104|LMP|Yes. Okay, I'm on.
1642112|CDR|Okay.
1642113|LMP|Did I want a chart?
1642114|CDR|No.
1642115|CC|No charts, Jack; no charts.
1642116|LMP|Okay.
1642119|CDR|Got it. Got it; 185 and 1.5 and I'm going to head on at about 012. We ought to go right through Jones. Oh, baby - Jones.
1642127|CC|Okay, and, Gene, remember the driving fairly slow - or fairly well controlled the first 300 meters, and a mark at the end of the antenna.
1642139|CDR|Watch that, Jack, watch that antenna lean - -
1642141|LMP|Uh-oh. Keep going.
1642150|CDR|Look like to you?
1642151|LMP|Okay so far; keep going.
1642154|CDR|Okay, let's do that again - -
1642155|LMP|Yes.
1642156|CDR|- - but a little different. I'll pick up that same spot, I can see right where I was.
1642208|CC|Okay. Give us another mark when you start up on that side.
1642213|CDR|Okay. We'll give you a hack, Bob.
1642219|LMP|Okay. You're a little - -
1642228|CDR|Yes, I'm right on the track. Same tracks exactly.
1642231|LMP|Well, okay.
1642232|CDR|That's exactly - I just came right over. Okay, we're starting Bob -
1642235|CDR|MARK it.
1642236|CC|Copy that.
1642242|PAO|The crew is on the way to Station 6 at the base of the North Massif. Station 7 is nearby to the east of Station 6.
1642254|CDR|We can't go too far in this heading. We've got a big hole up here.
1642258|CC|Okay.
1642259|CDR|Like a big one.
1642302|LMP|Wonder if that's Rudolph?
1642307|PAO|Station 6 is at the foot of what's believed to be a long boulder trail up the North Massif.
1642308|LMP|Well, let's see, this is east - looks awf - it's a double crater but it's much bigger than I thought Rudolph would be.
1642314|CC|No, if you're where you think you are, you're beyond - you're east of Rudolph quite a ways.
1642325|CDR|Hey, I think you ought to know where we are by now, Bob.
1642328|CC|Roger that.
1642328|LMP|Maybe that's Lewis and Clark.
1642332|CC|After you give me a mark there, we'll give you - I'll talk to you about it.
1642338|CDR|I'm sorry, Bob. I guess you - you didn't hear it. I - we're passed the end of the antenna and we're headed south or north - northeast.
1642347|CC|Okay, I - -
1642348|CDR|That screw you up?
1642348|CC|Did you give me a mark when you started or a mark when you passed the antenna?
1642354|CDR|I gave you a mark when I started and it took about 20 seconds to get to the end.
1642400|CC|Okay, copy that.
1642404|CDR|Is that good enough or do you want me to go back?
1642406|CC|No. No. Press on. And, Jack, if you look at your contour map there, we think you are located right now at approximately where the P in SEP is, Just below the P in Poppy. In which case you're probably driving through that little crater that's just to the northeast there.
1642425|LMP|Okay.
1642427|CC|That's probably the one you came upon.
1642431|CDR|Not very little, though.
1642438|PAO|Distance to Station 6 is 3.3 kilometers.
1642440|LMP|Okay, Bob. Boy, I wish I could see a little bit better.
1642445|PAO|Estimated driving time 28 minutes.
1642456|LMP|The major boulders still look like the - the pyroxene gabbro. Surface texture has not changed. There is a - there is a granule population, now that I look at it more closely, with the shadows. But I have a feeling that most of those are - they look like they're just small, very small clods. That should show up in some of the bulk samples we've taken. It is remarkable to me the - only a small number of fine-grain rocks. There's one at about halfway between the SEP and the LM that I'd like to pick up, it's a fairly good sized one. Maybe we can get it when we get back. It looks like a fine-grained basalt. I may have sampled one in 45 Yankee there.
1642555|CDR|Well, I tell you, it's not exactly the greatest place to navigate through.
1642559|LMP|I think you ought to bear left, don't you?
1642601|CDR|Yes. That's where I'm going here. I just want to get across this mound of boulders.
1642605|LMP|There's still - there's a crater we're just passing at 207/0.4, about 20 meters in diameter, with the pyroxene gabbro blocks on the rim, few of them. It's not an exceptionally blocky rim crater, but we are in an area where the block population is up to about 5 percent in contrast to most of the area we traversed yesterday.
1642636|CDR|I tell you, going is a little bit rough; there's a population of blocks as Jack said and there is an awful lot of small craters.
1642645|LMP|Yes, I was just going to add that the frequency of craters in the 10-meter size range is quite a bit higher than we were used to yesterday. Oops, there's one.
1642702|CDR|Yes.
1642703|LMP|Snuck up on you. And they all - although not exceptionally blocky rim - they all have a slightly, maybe 2 or 3 or 5 percent more blocks in their walls and on their rim than do the - does the normal terrain.
1642726|CC|Roger, Jack. Copy that.
1642729|LMP|Still no - still no obvious structure within the dark mantling material itself.
1642738|CDR|Bob, you said 185/1.5?
1642741|CC|That's affirm.
1642743|LMP|What do you want? For the Rover?
1642746|CDR|Yes, for a sample.
1642748|LMP|Oh, they changed it on us. Okay. Okay - there's - still seeing the little pit-bottom craters with the glass in them. I've forgotten the acronym already, Bob, I'm sorry. And you asked me for an LMP frame count awhile back and I believe it was 5. That was at the SEP.
1642818|CC|That was after the SEP photos, right?
1642823|LMP|That's affirm. Negative; that was before the SEP photos.
1642833|CC|Copy that.
1642838|LMP|Okay, Bob, looking up at the North Massif, we see the scattered, strewn field of boulders, that generally seem to start from a - more or less, from a line of large boulders, which might indicate some structure. And those lines are roughly horizontal across the face that we're looking at. The boulder tracks are irregular in shape, obviously downhill, but you'll see in the pictures that they - that they are curved in places, but they're all - that I see - tend to be aggregates of little craters - where the boulder was obviously tumbling and bouncing a little bit. We're out in population of fragments now in the immediate area at 1 - is that 188?
1642950|CDR|188/0.9.
1642952|LMP|It's generally about 1 percent between craters. But at the crater rims, it's up to about 5 percent.
1643000|CC|Okay. Copy that, Jack. And how far down the North Massif - -
1643002|LMP|And these craters - -
1643003|CC|- - is the line of boulders?
1643009|LMP|Oh, there are several of them, Bob. What I'm talking about is about 100-meter-long lines where the boulder trains initiate. And they are - there's one about - looks like about halfway - maybe two-thirds of the way down in perspective. Another one that's probably about halfway - they're just sort of scattered around on the Massif.
1643034|LMP|I think we're getting close to - No, we couldn't be.
1643038|CDR|I've got to move over here a little.
1643040|LMP|That must be Jones.
1643042|CDR|Where are you looking?
1643043|LMP|Off to the right.
1643044|CDR|Yes, our heading that they're sending us down here, it really should put us to west of Jones. So that's about right. A lot of static in the background today.
1643055|CC|Yes, I think we are talking to you guys through the LM right now, and how about a speed reading?
1643103|CDR|Okay. We're at 12 clicks and we're FULL BORE.
1643107|CC|Copy that.
1643120|LMP|Okay.
1643121|CDR|187/1.1.
1643126|CC|Copy that.
1643135|LMP|Bob, I wish I could give you more on that structure in there, but I think those lines of boulder sources are about all we can see right now. Talked about the lineaments yesterday and they're not nearly as obvious today in the higher Sun. Looking up Wessex Cleft - even with the Sun in the flat area there, it looks darker than where - than the North Massif side. But again, the Sun angle may be fooling us but I recall it was darker on the photos. The old man wrinkled face on the - -
1643216|CDR|Sculptured Hills.
1643217|LMP|- - Sculptured Hills, though, is evident as soon as you come out of the Wessex Cleft.
1643221|CDR|Yes.
1643222|LMP|And it looks like there are boulders up on the side of the Sculptured Hills except that they aren't nearly as big as those on the North Massif. The areas where the boulder sources look like their made up of fine - boulders no bigger than a meter maybe whereas the North Massif boulders are up to several meters. Those boulder sources all seem to be up within a third of the height of the Sculptured Hills just south - or just east of the Massif - of the Wessex Cleft. There's a boulder track that crosses slope. See that Geno?
1643305|CDR|Yes - yes. I sure do now.
1643307|LMP|It looks like it goes, rather than perpendicular contours, it probably is crossing them in a fairly straight line on an angle of 60 degrees, maybe.
1643318|CDR|Back to the east.
1643319|LMP|Yes, to the east. That one may be fairly near - -
1643324|CDR|Jack, see that big boulder with that big track - it looks like it's an elongated rolled-up boulder. Look at that.
1643329|LMP|Yes, it does. Looks like it's - may be broken now.
1643333|CDR|Okay. Here we are - 1.5 and 185.
1643337|CC|Okay; copy that.
1643338|LMP|Okay, is this a Rover sample?
1643340|CDR|A Rover sample.
1643340|LMP|Okay - -
1643341|CDR|Tell me where you want it.
1643342|LMP|- - see that little pit right over there about 30 feet ahead.
1643345|CDR|Yes, I think so.
1643346|LMP|Okay, I've got two pictures there.
1643355|CDR|How's that?
1643357|LMP|That's great. Okay, this is soil sample - Hey, Geno.
1643417|CDR|Okay, and I just took a locator; and CDR is on frame 41.
1643422|LMP|Got it?
1643424|CDR|Oh, not yet.
1643425|CC|Copy that.
1643426|CDR|Right now. Bag 40 - 46 Yankee.
1643431|CC|Copy that.
1643440|CDR|Your bag open?
1643441|LMP|Yes.
1643441|CDR|Okay, it's in.
1643444|LMP|We ought to tape that bead down if we can remember it next stop. It's in the way of - it's sticking up.
1643454|CDR|Okay, I'll get it. That thing came down - came off that piece of Velcro. I'll get it when I get. back.
1643459|LMP|Okay. And LMP's frame count is 35.
1643510|CDR|Okay, Bob, I'd like a - bearing and range.
1643514|CC|Okay. Bearing and range for the large block, just beyond - let's see, it's just beyond the crater Henry. The large clock there near the break of the slope, which is our next aiming point. The bearing and range there is 188 and 2.8.
1643532|CDR|188 and 2.8. Roger.
1643535|CC|Okay. And, Jack, do you - what do you see in the way of boulders coming down the base of the Sculptured Hills, in terms of sampling opportunities of Station 8 and in terms of any boulder tracks that we might - might lead down to boulders that might just possibly be accessible at Station 8.
1643553|LMP|Watch it, Gene. Boulder tracks are not obvious on Sculptured Hills at all. It looks like there are fragments over there that would have had their sources higher up the slope. I think we can get boulders there.
1643610|CC|Okay; copy that. We'll see - -
1643612|CDR|We'll have to get a little closer, Bob.
1643614|CC|We'll find out in a couple of hours.
1643618|LMP|Yes, I will give you a reading on that before long. I wouldn't eliminate Station 8 for the world - or the Moon, whatever's available today.
1643628|CDR|Bob, what did you say? 188/2 point something.
1643631|CC|2.8.
1643635|CDR|Okay, thank you. See that big boulder, Jack, with those tracks?
1643639|LMP|Yes, it looks like -
1643640|CDR|That's funny looking boulder.
1643641|LMP|It looks like it may have stopped rolling because it broke up.
1643645|CDR|Looks broken to me now.
1643652|CDR|Boy, they've got the low gain right on. But, I tell you, we still got static.
1643656|LMP|I don't have any, Gene. You may - -
1643657|CDR|Well, I sure do.
1643701|LMP|Don't like the sound of your ... Okay, you've got yourself in some holes here. You've never - I've read you all along, though, so there's no problem. Okay, there's a big crater. I haven't recognized Jones yet. Looks like you're getting up on the rim of Henry here.
1643727|CDR|Yes - no, Henry should be to - I'm well - should be well west of Henry, I think. I wouldn't be surprised if Henry isn't right over that little rise on the right.
1643738|LMP|Bob, the surface structure hasn't changed texture. We're on a little bit of a rise in here now and still about 1 percent of the surface - -
1643747|CDR|There's Henry right there, Jack.
1643749|LMP|There's Henry.
1643750|CC|Okay, how about a range and bearing.
1643751|LMP|I thought you were close to Henry.
1643753|CDR|Yes. 188/1.8.
1643757|LMP|And we're just southwest of Henry.
1643803|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1643803|LMP|On the rim. Oh, Prince Henry the Navigator.
1643809|CDR|Watch that foot.
1643812|LMP|It's called a wheel, I think. And Henry looks much like Horatio did. Has boulders on its inner wall - not as many. They look light colored - a light albedo gabbroic appearance. There may be some right down there, though, that are fine grained; they look a little grayer.
1643833|CDR|Jack, there's our target - there's - either one of - that's one right down there on - on ... break in slope.
1643838|LMP|See the one we've got over there has a boulder track. That's the one, that's cross-slope.
1643843|CDR|Yes, if we could get up high - -
1643844|LMP|Can we get up there?
1643845|CDR|We'll see.
1643846|LMP|That's the one - That's Station 6, and that was the - the turning boulder.
1643851|CDR|Yes, that's it.
1643852|LMP|The one right there.
1643854|CDR|Station 6 - we can probably get up there.
1643856|LMP|I think we can; it doesn't look too bad. At the break in slope, right now, doesn't show anything obvious, except that's where the boulders start.
1643907|CC|Okay, we hope that's fairly obvious.
1643909|LMP|And on up the hill you have ... -
1643918|LMP|But as I was saying, Henry just looks like somewhat more mantled Horatio (laughter). Getting to be ridiculous.
1643927|CDR|Say, Bob, I'm navigating - headed northwest now - to get around the western rim of Henry.
1643933|CC|Okay.
1643934|LMP|Okay; And on that west rim, we've got about 10 or - 10 percent boulder cover.
1643942|CC|Okay; And a reminder, Jack, to keep taking your Rover photos.
1643948|LMP|Yes, sir. And when I - By boulder, I generally mean fragment, Bob, in this case. When I say 10 percent, I'm looking at stuff greater than about a centimeter in diameter. I'll try to say fragment from now on and be more precise. Okay; Here's a little area where there's - This part of Henry - this is the one part of the rim of Henry I see that has fairly large fragments, or boulders, on them up to 2 or 3 meters. But, again, they all appear to be buried. There are very few, except small ones, sitting out on the surface.
1644032|CDR|And, you know, the fragment population out here only goes out to maybe 200 meters, I expect.
1644039|LMP|Okay. Now this concentration of boulders is because of a 50-meter crater in the rim of Henry.
1644046|CC|Okay, say that sounds like Locke. How about a range and bearing?
1644047|LMP|I think that was one that we -
1644050|CDR|Take a picture in here, Jack.
1644051|LMP|No. Locke, I can see. I'm getting a picture.
1644058|LMP|Okay. Locke's right ahead of us -
1644059|CDR|Yes.
1644100|LMP|This is one on the - about 50 meters right on the rim crest of Henry, almost due - the west rim - due west rim. Now Locke is just ahead of us. It also has boulders in its walls but has relatively few on the rim.
1644117|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1644118|LMP|Characteristic of both Henry, Locke, and Horatio is a re - essentially no change in the average frequency of boulders on the rim. The increase comes in the walls.
1644134|CDR|We're at 184/2.3. We're just about between Henry and - -
1644142|LMP|Locke.
1644142|CDR|Locke. Yes; right between them.
1644144|CC|Okay. I copy that. And you guys are heading for that big boulder, which must be just dead ahead of you there, about half a kilometer.
1644153|LMP|Well, we're - Gene's sort of headed for Station 6 now.
1644156|CDR|I'm going to take a tour around that boulder and get a case on it.
1644159|LMP|Okay. Go ahead.
1644200|CC|Yes. That would be a good mark to give us a range and bearing on, since that's a pretty good straight point.
1644207|CDR|Yes, we are.
1644209|LMP|Bob, the boulder concentrations in the wall of Henry have their upslope start at about - oh, I would guess an average of 30 meters down from the rim crest. The rim crest of Henry is not very well defined, but it's there. And they - from that initiation of boulders, they stream down the slope to the break in - in slope down at the floor. Still no obvious change in the dark mantle, as we're just to the east of Locke now. There's some - there's a 30-meter crater, fairly subdued b ut still quite deep - subdued rim, again, it looks as if it were mantled, that - has no significant increase in blocks on its rim. That crater, in any other place, would have been a very blocky-rim crater. It has - it's maybe 30 meters and - by 5 meters deep. Man, that is a big rock up there. Turning Point Rock is a split rock - has a - looks like a northwest-southeast overhang, with another block just this side of it - just to the south of that overhang. It's a pyramid shape in cross section - triangular shape in cross section. And it looks like it is pretty well fractured, although not pervasively like the rock at Shorty was.
1644404|CDR|Okay, Jack, I know I can get up to that - to Station 6.
1644408|LMP|Yes.
1644408|CDR|I can drive up there.
1644409|LMP|Yes. Now, Bob, Station 6 rock - one of them - is from that boulder track that runs obliquely across the contours.
1644418|CC|Okay. I copy that, Jack. Sounds like good news.
1644423|LMP|And there's - the pictures ought to be able to - the pictures ought to pin down its - at least the end of the boulder track pretty well.
1644431|CDR|Boy, this is a big rock, Jack. Whew.
1644434|LMP|As I recall - as I saw it, the boulder tracks stopped about halfway up the slope of the North Massif. That is a big rock.
1644441|CDR|We're at Turning Point Rock. And it looks like it's - I don't know if it's mantled on top, but it's certainly filleted. There's a - a lot of the dark mantle up and on some of the shallower slopes of the boulder. And it's on a little mound itself, as if much of it might be covered up.
1644456|LMP|Yes. Okay. It looks like a breccia from here.
1644501|CDR|Can you get a sample of it right here? You see these little chips?
1644504|LMP|Yes, I probably can.
1644507|CDR|Okay, Bob. I'm 3 meters from Turning Point Rock on the east side, and I'm reading 186 and 2.8.
1644515|CC|Roger. Copy that. Sensational.
1644520|LMP|Okay. You got to - can you drive up - -
1644523|CDR|Yes.
1644524|LMP|- - to the - right there, let's see - no, I can get them. The thing is, I don't know what it is.
1644530|CDR|Well, but ... it's part of these fragments around here. I guess Turning Point Rock is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, - 6 meters high anyway. It's a - Well, I'd say it's a very rough subrounded type of rock - by the face - let me get this, Jack. Okay. There are two fragments in that sample.
1644559|CDR|47 Yankee.
1644601|LMP|Plus some dirt. And it's about 4 meters from the - Turning Point Rock on the north side.
1644615|CC|Okay. Copy that. And presume you got some good photos of the rock.
1644621|LMP|Yes, I got a couple. I hope they're good.
1644626|CDR|Well, I'll tell you what I'm going to do here, real quick.
1644628|LMP|And my locator is - -
1644630|CDR|I'm going to do a - -
1644631|LMP|- - 56.
1644632|LMP|Copy that.
1644634|CDR|Jack, let me spin around this little crater here to the left.
1644636|LMP|Bob, it looks - it's very coarsely vesicular; but, at first glance, it did not look like the pyroxene gabbro - although the rock - that rock does. I - It looks like it might be fragmental, although I'm suspicious that I'm looking at zap pits. That'd be a - Oh, yes - Getting them. I got them. Pick one. That's a nice view.
1644709|CDR|And we're on a little rise looking at this boulder. That's incredible.
1644715|CDR|Okay. We're on the roll, Bob.
1644717|CC|Copy that.
1644718|LMP|You know that - Bob, my guess is, right now, is that Turning Point Rock is a big piece of subfloor gabbro.
1644730|CC|Okay. I gather you changed your opinion.
1644732|LMP|What looked like fragments is just - yes, what looked like fragments is just big spalls - spalls of where the zap pits have cleaned off the rock.
1644749|CC|Okay. I copy that. And, guys, you might be happy to know that we think we've finally found the LM, because we were calling that for 188 and 2.8, and you got there at 186 and 2.8.
1644804|LMP|That's not bad. Okay - -
1644811|CDR|It's a split one up there, Jack. I've had ray eye on it. There's some big boulders down here.
1644824|LMP|Got it. I sort of lost track of Station 6.
1644831|CDR|No, I got it. I've had my eye on that boulder. You can't see the track from here. I'll bet you can. I can see it now. We'll see it - we'll be looking right up it - looking right up the old boulder track. Man, I tell you, this navigating through here is not -
1644854|LMP|Okay. We're in a region where the really - the general fragment population's no different. We're up on the - off the break in slope, although you wouldn't notice it - but we are quite a ways. And - but the fragment population is not much different than that on the plains. The big difference is that there are these scattered blocks that are from a meter to probably 10 meters - no, 5 meters in diameter. Hard to say, maybe 8.
1644924|CDR|See that track coming down? We'll be looking right up that track.
1644926|LMP|Yes, yes, you got it. I didn't realize you were that far upslope.
1644929|CDR|Yes, we're way upslope.
1644930|LMP|Yes. Hit it.
1644931|CDR|Not very uncomfortable for me on this side. (Laughter) How do you feel?
1644935|LMP|Oh, I feel fine. I just - until I looked down there and saw the slope we're on.
1644938|CDR|Yes, I know it.
1644942|LMP|And I can't see any obvious change in albedo, like we could see with the light mantle yesterday. You - you - You got a - don't - There you got a nice nice nice place. Oh, oh, you don't want to go over that way.
1644958|CDR|Yes, I can make it. I want to park right - -
1645001|CC|And 17, we want you to park at a heading of 107. We're going to open the battery covers and let them cool at this station. So a heading of 107.
1645014|CDR|107, huh? Okay. I'll get it up here.
1645019|LMP|Hey, that's going to be moderately level right there.
1645021|CDR|Yes.
1645023|LMP|Trouble is, they're looking into the shady side of the block.
1645027|CDR|Well, if I park on the other side, they won't be able to - I can go right upslope a little bit.
1645031|LMP|That's all right. We can work in there. No, that's all right.
1645034|CDR|Yes, I can't go up there. Let me just - This is going to have to be good. I can't go up there.
1645046|LMP|I think you're all right.
1645048|CDR|That's not very level, but - -
1645050|LMP|Oh, not too - not too hard. Watch that turn.
1645056|CDR|That's not very level, but we're not going to get much more level than that.
1645059|LMP|No, that's good.
1645101|CDR|Let me - they wanted 107. That's the best I can do. That's not very level for the gravimeter, but - Let me see if I can get comm. Hey, Bob, how do you read?
1645119|CC|Loud and clear, 17. How do you read?
1645124|CDR|Okay. We're parked on a heading of 107. Are you happy with that?
1645130|CC|Roger. Sounds great.
1645130|LMP|(Laughter) You parked on a slope, too.
1645132|CDR|There's no level - there's no level spots to park, here, though.
1645138|LMP|You want me - some help getting off?
1645140|CDR|I've got to go uphill.
1645142|LMP|I just about ended up down at the bottom of the hill.
1645145|CDR|Okay; 192/3.8, 3.1; 88 and 80; 108 and 0 on the batteries. The forward motors are 220 and about 270, and the rears are 0 - off scale low and 220.
1645213|LMP|You want me to block the wheels? (Laughter) You got the brake on, I hope.
1645219|CDR|You betcha. I don't know if I can lean uphill or not. (Laughter) I can't. Holy Smoley. Boy, are we on a slope!
1645234|LMP|You okay?
1645236|CDR|Yes, Let me get this thing set again.
1645238|LMP|I don't think you can ...
1645239|CDR|Boy, are we on a slope!
1645243|LMP|Okay. I'm going to stay out from between the rocks. It's a beautiful east-west split rock. It's even got a north overhang that we can work with. And let me see what it is. We're right at Station 6. You wouldn't believe it.
1645307|CDR|I would. Oh, man, what a slope!
1645310|LMP|And this boulder's got its own little track, right up the hill, cross contoured. It's a chain of craters track, and it looks like it stops ... where it started. It starts in, what looks to be, a lighter colored linear zone - trying to give you perspective; it's probably only about a third of the way up the North Massif.
1645336|PAO|TV coming in.
1645344|LMP|Bob, are you reading this?
1645345|CC|Read you loud and clear; and we got a picture.
1645350|CDR|Oh, man, I tell you, are we parked on a slope! I don't know whether your TGE's going to hack it.
1645358|CC|Okay. It'll pick up to 15 degrees.
1645359|CDR|Bob, this is a - Well, it is going to have it.
1645406|LMP|It's a coarsely vesicular, crystalline rock - finely crystalline. Looks like a - probably an anorthositic gabbro - trying to see the zap pits, for glass color, I don't have a good one yet.
1645432|CDR|Say, Bob, you want both the recorder and the - and the other switch off?
1645437|CC|Roger. Both of those off, and ...
1645444|CDR|Oh, man, it is hard to get around here.
1645449|LMP|Bob, it looks like the glass is fairly light colored. It's not white. Well no - it's black. It's anorthositic gabbro, rather than gabbroic anorthosite, I think. Yes, that's black glass in the pits.
1645512|CC|Okay. And, Gene, did you happen to notice the temperature on the ... when you dusted it?
1645518|CDR|I didn't dust it yet.
1645520|CC|Copy that.
1645521|LMP|Bob, some of the vesicles are - they're flattened. All of them are flattened. There's a strong foliation of vesicles in the rock. Most of them are flattened, and they are up to 15 or 20 centimeters in diameter and about 5 to 6 centimeters thick - or wide.
1645551|CC|Outstanding.
1645556|LMP|And there's some beautiful north overhangs all around the block. Well, (laughter) on the north side of the block.
1645605|CC|Okay. That's the best place - that north overhang; and I guess that means one of you guys might grab the SEC - the small can - before you leave the Rover.
1645616|CDR|Okay, Bob. It's going to take me awhile to dust. I tell you - -
1645619|LMP|Okay - -
1645620|CDR|Hard to get around here.
1645621|CC|Roger.
1645622|LMP|Bob, now let's get it straight. You w - let's get it straight, you want the north overhang sample in the SEC - or the short can?
1645639|CC|Miracle of miracles, they don't want the short can. I'm not sure I understand that, Jack, but they don't want the short can here, they say, I guess they're looking for volcanic today.
1645651|LMP|Okay, we'll put them in bags. Oh, man -
1645652|CC|They're looking for volcanic today, Jack.
1645657|LMP|Oh, they are, huh? We found those yesterday.
1645700|CC|Well, they're hoping again at Station 9.
1645705|LMP|This is - Now, that foliation I mentioned does not go all the way through the rock. There are variations in texture. One zone was strongly foliated. There's another - it almost looks like a large - it is - a large inclusion of nonvesicular rock within the vesicular rock. There may be some autobrecciation involved in the formation of this thing. It really looks mineralogically like the light-colored samples from the South Massif. But I - I tell you, that's only because it's light colored, and I - I can't give you anymore than that right now, until we get a fresh surface.
1645759|CDR|110 degrees on the SEP and you want the tape - the cover closed, right?
1645803|CC|Cover open, please. Cover open. Both off.
1645809|CDR|Okay. Cover's open.
1645812|CC|Okay. And did you get the batteries - -
1645814|CDR|Oh, my golly.
1645815|CC|- the LRV battery covers open. We didn't copy that, Gene.
1645820|CDR|No, I didn't copy that you wanted them open. I just got 107. I was about to ask you that.
1645825|CC|Okay. We'd like them open. And, Jack, while I'm interrupting everybody here, how about a frame count, if convenient.
1645832|PAO|That's Jack Schmitt at the rock.
1645837|LMP|Oh, shoot! Bob. I gave you one at the rock. It's now 68.
1645842|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1645848|CDR|Man, I never - (Laughter) You can't believe how tough it is getting around this Rover, on this slope.
1645858|LMP|I think I'll - -
1645859|CDR|Man, that - I think we're probably pitch 20 and roll 20.
1645909|LMP|I think I'll get over here and get a pan while we're ... sample.
1645915|CDR|Oh, I got to dust those radiators. I can't leave them like that. I tell you, this is not a very good place to dust them, though. Let me try one time. Oh, boy.
1645931|LMP|Be careful, Geno. Need some help?
1645934|CDR|No. I need a little finesse, though. It's one thing to reach over - here and do this on level ground. I don't know if I can do that without falling on the battery.
1645955|LMP|Well, I found a place to stand where I can take a pan.
1650000|CDR|Bob, I'm going to have to give you a good battery brushing at the next site. I can't get - I get half of them, but I can't get the other half. It's too slopey.
1650014|PAO|EVA time 2 hours and 15 minutes.
1650014|CC|Okay. We copy that.
1650018|CDR|But the covers are open. What are you working on, Jack?
1650026|LMP|I'm taking a pan.
1650028|CDR|Very good. I'm coming right now. I bet you a dollar to doughnuts that you don't get a TGE reading.
1650034|CC|Yes, Gene. If you're - if it's easy enough to take it off, why don't you take it off the Rover; and we'll try and level it in the stuff.
1650045|CDR|Oh, come on. (Laughter) I'm not sure there's any place to put it on the ground level.
1650053|LMP|No, you have to dig a place.
1650057|CDR|Yes, I'll do it. Okay. It's coming off. Well, I'll set it right up here.
1650112|LMP|It's going to fall down the hill. You'd better stomp off a good place.
1650118|PAO|Jack Schmitt shooting panoramic photography.
1650125|CDR|Yes. That looks level to me. Can you see it from there?
1650128|LMP|Well, I can see it.
1650129|CDR|I mean, does it - -
1650131|LMP|I don't know. I have no perspective anymore.
1650133|CDR|I don't either.
1650134|CDR|MARK. Gravity.
1650136|CC|Copy the mark - -
1650138|CDR|It's flashing. Okay; now let me get to work. Okay ... My fender got a little kinked here, which isn't going to help us.
1650155|CC|Hey, Jack. And we see your gold visor's up. You may want to put it down out here in the Sun.
1650204|LMP|Well, I think I might - I can't see with it down; it's scratched. Bob, I'll use it.
1650211|CDR|I think I can monitor that one.
1650213|LMP|Hey, I'm standing on a boulder track. How does that make you feel?
1650219|CDR|That makes me feel like I'm coming over to do some sampling. Think how it would have been if you were standing there before that boulder came by.
1650233|LMP|I'd rather not think about it.
1650235|CDR|Okay, let's go. You got a spot picked while you're here?
1650239|LMP|Well, the big thing is, let's get those - let's get the boulder and then get in that east-west split. Bob, I got an undocumented sample from the middle of the boulder track.
1650258|CC|Copy that. Soil sample?
1650300|CDR|Whew!
1650302|LMP|Soil sample. Gene, if you hit them off in there, it's going to be awful hard to find them, that's the problem.
1650315|CDR|Did you pick a spot - a good spot while you were over here?
1650319|LMP|No, I didn't. I just was looking at it. I think we need to get in the light, though.
1650323|CDR|Well I - I can see with my gold visor.
1650326|LMP|Let me put a sample in your bag.
1650328|CDR|Okay. Go ahead.
1650329|LMP|It's bag - shoot - it's 534.
1650339|CDR|This boulder looks fairly uniform from top to bottom.
1650342|LMP|We've got to get a reference sample out - this soil.
1650345|CDR|Let's get where we can get that 90-degree picture, too; so we want to get on the - really ought to get on the Sun side. Let me get that slab right there, though, to start with. I can get that one off. Well, there's no - let's go over on the Sun side because we can't really photograph it.
1650359|LMP|Okay. I got to get out of here first.
1650402|CDR|Let's go through the split.
1650404|LMP|Well, okay. Be careful, though. Why don't we sample the split first so we don't - -
1650413|CDR|Look at that overhang. Man, I tell you, if you can get your shovel down there, you'd have a ball.
1650417|LMP|Yes, let's sample in the split first so that we don't get it too messed up. And then we can sample some of this stuff. Not - we want this overhang over here, Geno - the north facing one.
1650430|CDR|Right here.
1650431|LMP|Yes. I got to get - sneak by over there. Whoops! Don't shuffle too much dirt in there.
1650438|CDR|Okay. You by me so I can set the gnomon down.
1650440|LMP|Not quite. Don't think I can make it - without hitting you. I can't.
1650445|CDR|Okay. Now try it.
1650448|LMP|Okay.
1650453|CDR|Ready?
1650454|LMP|Okay.
1650455|CDR|Let me set the gnomon down - -
1650456|LMP|Set it down just outside the shadow here. Right - Whoa - right there. That's good. There's still some clean ground there. Okay.
1650504|CDR|Okay. I can get back far enough to take these pictures. I want to go get a stereo pan around the comer anyway. Let's see if I can't start here with about 5.6. I'm so close.
1650520|LMP|Okay, I'll get a -
1650523|CDR|I must have a boulder ...
1650524|LMP|I'll get it. Let me - -
1650526|CDR|- I'm going to go around the cor - I got it now.
1650536|LMP|Okay. You got a bag?
1650537|CDR|All set.
1650540|LMP|Okay. I'm going to get the shadowed material.
1650549|CDR|It's in bag 312, Bob.
1650551|CC|Copy 312.
1650555|LMP|And it's - it's from - I think you saw where I got it. It's about a half a meter back of the limit of the overhang. Put it down. Put it down.
1650605|CDR|Okay. Can you reach it?
1650607|LMP|I will in a minute. You can turn it a little bit towards me. Okay; 312. And the soil outside the overhang will be next.
1650634|CDR|Okay. Go get it.
1650641|LMP|And the first one is from the upper 2 centimeters.
1650649|CDR|Bag 313.
1650651|CC|Copy 313.
1650657|LMP|And the second one is from probably down - from 2 centimeters down to about 8.
1650708|CC|Copy that.
1650714|LMP|Bob, it looks like the fragment just to the - or the boulder just to the south of us has some inclusions in it - light-colored inclusions.
1650726|CDR|Bag 472 on that.
1650729|CC|Copy 472 on that. You mean the south half of the split boulder?
1650735|LMP|Yes. I haven't seen inclusions in the other half.
1650742|CDR|Okay? Okay. Now we need boulder stuff.
1650745|LMP|You happy with that, Houston? Let's get - you got your hammer?
1650752|CC|Yes, we're happy with that ...
1650804|LMP|That's a little hard, huh? I think - -
1650809|CDR|I've got to find a corner I can get at.
1650811|LMP|Yes.
1650813|CDR|Let me get an after picture down in this hole.
1650816|LMP|Oh, that's right. You almost stepped on the - I forgot the after, too.
1650830|LMP|Hey, there are chips up here on top. Also, that's been spalled off.
1650836|CDR|Yes.
1650836|LMP|We can get some of those, but - -
1650837|CDR|Looks like somebody's been chipping up there.
1650839|LMP|Looks like there's been a geologist here before us.
1650842|CDR|Let me get the gnomon. I think I can get some of these pieces over here. I want to get that 90-degree angular flight line around this boulder, too.
1650852|LMP|Bob, the more I look at this thing - here's the piece that fell off. Here's the piece that was knocked off up there.
1650858|CDR|Yes.
1650859|LMP|Look at that.
1650901|CDR|We ought to bring a big piece of that home. That's obvious it's obvious - -
1650903|LMP|How about this one up here? Take your picture. I think we can just lift that off. See that?
1650910|CDR|Stand by.
1650916|LMP|I'd better get - -
1650918|CDR|I'll get a locator from here.
1650920|LMP|Okay. I was going to get my down-Sun, but I'm afraid I'll -
1650926|CDR|You may be down-Sun if you do.
1650927|LMP|Yes, we'll get some. You get it?
1650932|CDR|Yes, will it come off?
1650933|LMP|Let me see. Yes.
1650938|CDR|Yes. Just throw it in my bag. It's broken, but it's in place. That's a nice, big piece, too. It's about the size of a - -
1650946|LMP|Why don't you put it in mine. I can't get a thing in it.
1650949|CDR|Okay. Got it?
1650952|LMP|Yes, I got it.
1650954|CDR|Don't move.
1650956|LMP|Okay, Bob, there's a big spall lying on the ground here that has been knocked off up there, from right on top of the boulder. And, I tell you, the more I look at this - the south half of this boulder, the more heterogeneous in texture it looks. It looks as if it may be either a recrystallized breccia of some kind, or you had a gabbroic anorthosite - magma catch up an awful lot of inclusions. I guess I prefer the latter explanation because of the extreme vesicularity of the rock.
1651036|CC|Okay; very interesting.
1651041|LMP|Now, some of the - a few of the inclusions are - well, they're all subrounded to rounded, and a few - and a few of them are very light colored. I'm going to try -
1651053|CDR|I'm coming around the corner ...
1651055|LMP|Are you going to do it now? Okay. Well, you know, I ought to get one shot back here with a black and white. I'll get this half-black and white.
1651102|CDR|Okay, if we could get -
1651105|LMP|I think we ought to pick up a piece of that spall there by the gnomon -
1651109|CDR|I can break it off.
1651111|LMP|There's one right by the gnomon we can just pick up. It's a finer-grained vesicular rock than - wait - where - oh, geez.
1651120|CDR|Oh, oh, oh, oh -
1651123|LMP|I thought I was going to get this half.
1651124|CDR|Okay. I don't care. I've started down, Jack.
1651128|LMP|Well, they like to have some of it in black and white, you know.
1651133|CDR|I'll get that rock.
1651141|LMP|I forgot to look at the objectives for this station. I hope we're meeting them.
1651147|CDR|Well, we want to get 500s of that boulder track. I know I want to get that.
1651156|LMP|Okay. A piece of that spalled rock that was sitting by the gnomon - Ooh, watch out gnomon. How about that? - is in - bag 535.
1651218|CDR|You got one in there already?
1651220|LMP|Yes.
1651221|CC|Okay. We copy that one, Jack.
1651223|CDR|You won't be able to reach - you won't be able to reach my bag.
1651226|LMP|No, but you can put it in mine. Can you reach it?
1651236|CDR|Looking at it.
1651238|LMP|Bob, one of the light-colored inclusions looks like it may be anorthositic - gabbroic anorthosite - let me get my terms straight. The host rock has dark enough zap pits that it's probably gab - anorthositic gabbro, if I didn't say that. Some of the light-colored inclusions have slightly lighter colored glass, and they may be the gabbroic anorthosite.
1651313|CC|Okay, I copy that, Jack.
1651314|LMP|... like like like this one and that one.
1651317|CDR|Some of those inclusions get to be bigger than the size of a baseball. There's one here and a couple up there.
1651322|LMP|Let be borrow your hammer.
1651323|CDR|Yes. Jack, try a little higher. See that one right on the - right there. Right -
1651343|CDR|Yes, that's a hard rock.
1651349|LMP|Yes, that's a hard rock. You might be able to do it; I can't.
1651353|CDR|I can't get down there. Okay, we need some of the soil outside the shadow here.
1651401|LMP|Yes. How about over where your bag went? Let's move around here - I think there is some - oops! Get on this slope over here. Okay. How about out over here? Are we supposed to get a - Where are we here?
1651424|CDR|I don't know. I'd like to get - When you face uphill, your camera faces down.
1651432|LMP|We want to get a rake on the rim of that little crater down there, I guess.
1651437|CC|Okay, 17. Roger. You were asking about objectives. Of course the primary objective is docu - documented samples of the blocks; and then, also, we'd like to get some of the rake and soil samples out in the surface, namely, the rim crater there, if that's available. And one of the things, of course, we're looking for is the variety of rocks here, if there's more than just the one boulder. You can sample the boulder for a while, but we would be interested in seeing if there is more than just the single type of rock. Probably, also, samples from both sides - both halves of the rock. What we said this morning in terms of combining Stations 6 and 7 to an hour and 20 minutes -
1651519|LMP|Come on up here, Geno.
1651520|CDR|Okay.
1651521|LMP|If you can.
1651522|CC|And so it's sort of your option as to how much time you spend here and how much you go on to Station 7 and spend. If you feel that it's worthwhile, we could spend essentially all that hour and 20 minutes at this station. But if we did that, we'd like to get a fair variety of blocks, if they're available.
1651539|LMP|Okay. Geno, we sampled some of the light colored group - as a matter of fact, this block looks different.
1651545|CDR|Well, so does that big one - -
1651547|LMP|It's grayer.
1651547|CDR|That's why I've been photographing it.
1651549|LMP|See, what it is, I think - it's a blue-gray. It's a big blue-gray rock - itself is crystalline, I believe. The inclusions are much more sharply defined, and it's nonvesicular; and it's included, or at least it's in contact with the very vesicular anorthositic gabbro - right up there. See that?
1651614|CDR|Yes, the whole big one. I just ...
1651616|LMP|Did you get some pictures of it?
1651617|CDR|As I bounced around there, I took pictures of it.
1651618|LMP|Okay. Look, we can get some of that light-colored stuff in there, along with the blue-gray.
1651622|CDR|We ought to get as big a piece of that inclusion as we can. There's - -
1651625|LMP|See it up in there.
1651626|CDR|Yes. I think we're out of line of sight with them. We're behind a boulder.
1651632|LMP|Yes, sorry about that. But - -
1651634|CC|We can hear you loud and clear. We're just looking at rocks right now.
1651641|CDR|Okay, Bob, the boulder downslope is more of a light-gray vesicular boulder. The one Jack just talked about with some of the larger white inclusions is less vesicular, and it's a - more of blue-gray rock. And if I don't fall on my tail here, I'll get -
1651703|LMP|The locator is of Henry.
1651706|CC|Copy that.
1651711|CDR|Okay, let me try and get up there. Henry? We must be high enough to see something. I haven't even looked back.
1651724|LMP|Let me get a closeup before you start pounding.
1651729|CDR|No, I might go from this angle too. That will give them something a little different up in there too, Jack.
1651745|LMP|Yes.
1651747|CDR|We ought to try and sample that. Okay. Let's get the -
1651751|LMP|You want me to get my scoop under there? Probably won't fall out.
1651758|CDR|Okay. Get as many of these pieces as we can. I don't know how many are going to come out.
1651820|LMP|(Laughter)
1651820|CDR|Outstanding! Outstanding! This whole thing will come out here in a minute.
1651827|LMP|I'll watch it. I'll watch it. Got it?
1651830|CDR|Move your arm up or down. Okay. I got it in case we don't get another one.
1651855|CDR|Hey, we're getting good at that.
1651857|LMP|Yes. Can't hold that much longer.
1651901|CDR|Yes. Let me get up on this - up here.
1651905|LMP|Why don't we get a - get a bag out. Let me put these in a bag.
1651907|CDR|That's why I'm getting up here so I can - -
1651909|LMP|Oh, okay.
1651909|CDR|So I can get my balance. Bob, 556 is one of the light-colored inclusions in the blue-gray rock.
1651920|LMP|It's chips.
1651920|CDR|Chips of it.
1651923|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1651925|LMP|I think we lost that other one. That's good enough.
1651927|CDR|I got it; I know where it is.
1651929|LMP|That's all right. It's not a lot of sample, but it's representative, I think. It looks a lot like that sugary rock I sampled yesterday, doesn't it? Found in the - that we sampled in the - -
1651944|CDR|Yes, it's pretty easy to break up; it's really not very coherent at all.
1651947|LMP|You know, I thought last night, Bob, that I should use the word aplitic for a texture that we saw in that inclusion yesterday on the South Massif.
1651955|CDR|If I could keep from falling on my tail.
1651958|LMP|Can you get a - -
1651959|CDR|I want to - -
1652008|LMP|Okay, you going to get some of that?
1652009|CDR|Yes, that's a different kind; that's a more beat up inclusion of some sort. Oh, there's a nice piece coming out. Oh, wait a minute - don't lose it.
1652024|LMP|I got it. I've got it.
1652025|CDR|Got it.
1652026|LMP|Okay.
1652029|CDR|Okay. We have another inclusion that, on the surface, has a more reddish-brown texture. Interior looks pretty much the same; it's a very light gray.
1652042|LMP|This looks like a piece of breccia. Looks like a fragment briccia that got caught up in this thing.
1652049|CDR|Yes, well, the whole thing is obviously a breccia. I'd sure like to get that - -
1652052|LMP|Well, I'd say - I'm not sure; it's obviously a breccia. I think it may - may be an igneous rock with breccia inclusions.
1652059|CDR|Well, okay, but -
1652100|LMP|Which is sort of in the same class.
1652102|CDR|Sort of makes a breccia - -
1652104|LMP|Well - -
1652104|CDR|- - out of the big rock.
1652106|LMP|Okay.
1652106|CDR|Except you can - -
1652107|LMP|I can't get in there, Geno, you'll have to.
1652108|CDR|Okay.
1652109|LMP|No way -
1652109|CDR|Let me -
1652111|LMP|Watch it. Hold still - opps. I think it's easier for you.
1652121|CDR|Did I give them a number on that? - No.
1652123|CC|Negative.
1652125|CDR|It's - 5 - 536.
1652131|LMP|Squash it - cramp it a little bit, if you can; a little more.
1652138|CDR|Did you get that 536, Bob?
1652140|CC|Roger. 536 for the last one.
1652143|CDR|Let's get a - -
1652144|CC|And -
1652144|CDR|Okay. Let's go get the host rock here.
1652147|LMP|How about that - How about that - whew - how about that piece?
1652153|CDR|How about this one, with the inclusions here. Maybe I can get this one.
1652156|LMP|Okay.
1652158|CC|Okay; and, 17, we'd like -
1652201|LMP|That may have been a little optimistic.
1652205|CC|Do you guys have a feeling that the two halves of the big boulder are different rocks? Or is it the same rock split?
1652213|LMP|No, they're - they're two - they were all one boulder, I think. They are just two major rock types in the - whatever they came from. And I tried to describe that to you. We have the contact in the central boulder. They're really three big boulders. The central boulder had the contact between the light-gray rocks - or the blue-gray rocks and the vesicular anorthositic gabbro.
1652241|CC|Okay. And you guys have that pretty well photodocumented, right?
1652246|LMP|Yes, it's in pretty good shape. We're working on it still.
1652249|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1652253|LMP|Try going on the side there, Geno.
1652256|CDR|Just went from the side, Jack.
1652258|LMP|That's enough. You got a piece of the - -
1652301|CDR|... host rock.
1652303|LMP|I think you can get this one up here, can't you?
1652304|CDR|I wanted that one cause it had that inclusion wrapped in it. Let me go to high here for a minute. Which one are you talking about? This one here?
1652321|LMP|Yes, I just - it's about to come. Oh - oh - oh, okay. I've got it. I've got it.
1652342|CDR|Okay.
1652343|LMP|... bag.
1652344|CDR|They're both host rocks; we can put them in the same bag.
1652346|LMP|No, let's don't. No, they're different places. 537, is a chip of the blue-gray rock; and the host - the blue-gray host rock - and let me get that other one.
1652412|LMP|Oh -
1652414|CDR|Oh - Be careful -
1652423|CDR|Pick the rock up while you're there. It's right at your hand.
1652425|LMP|I will.
1652439|LMP|Okay.
1652442|CDR|... hammer somewhere.
1652447|LMP|Okay. And 538 is another sample of that material - a little dustier.
1652455|CC|Okay. We copy that.
1652458|LMP|That's the blue-gray - that's the blue-gray Bob, with the inclusions in it. Now the blue-gray, the more you looked at it, it looks like a - -
1652506|CDR|Give me your left - your right hand.
1652507|LMP|Huh?
1652508|CDR|Give me your right hand. Turn it over. Turn it over. Turn it over.
1652514|LMP|Well, I did. How do you want it over?
1652515|CDR|You kept turning it over in the same direction. Like that, so I can fix that. Okay. Now give me your bag, and I'll get it in there.
1652526|LMP|It - the blue-gray rock, on closer examination, looks like a partially recrystallized fragment breccia. It's very hard.
1652541|CDR|And I'm going to - -
1652543|LMP|Are you going to get the afters in there?
1652544|CDR|Yes, I'll get them. I want to do a little bit better documentation on this thing. Bob?
1652548|LMP|I'm going to go over and look at that contact.
1652549|CDR|I got a few closeup stereos of the inclusion that we tried to sample, and I'm going to see if I can't give you a little ... stereo around thia thing - if I can stay on my feet.
1652632|CDR|Do you read me, Jack, okay?
1652633|LMP|Yes, I hear you.
1652634|CC|And, Houston reads you loud and clear, also.
1652645|CDR|You can see where we've been pounding on this rock. We didn't succeed in getting samples everywhere. And I'm giving you a 90-degree corner.
1652700|LMP|Bob, it looks to me like there are inclusions of blue-gray in the gabbro - in the anorthositic gabbro.
1652710|CC|Positively outstanding.
1652711|CDR|Are you saying you think this whole big - You think this whole big blue-gray thing is an inclusion?
1652718|LMP|Yes, sir. And there's some little ones over here.
1652720|CDR|Yeah, but then within the blue-gray, we've got all these other fragment.
1652723|LMP|Well, that's right. It's just several generations of activity; and it looks like the gabbor though, picked up the fragmental breccia as inclusions. Bob, I'd - it really looks that way right now. There's a - -
1652746|CC|Okay, Charlie is here mumbling something about it looking just like house rock.
1652754|LMP|It's very crystalline. I'll tell you, it's not a breccia - not like house rock. Not to take anything away from house rock, though.
1652802|CDR|Hey, Bob, there's a lot of mantling on a very shallow slope of a fracture here on one of the upslope rocks. I would assume it's just part of the ... it picked up as its rolled down. But if it's worth sampling, you might think about it.
1652832|CC|Okay, Gene, if you can get that fairly readily, why don't you - You can perhaps just scoop it up with the bag.
1652839|CDR|That's exactly what I can do.
1652842|CC|If you can get up to the rock there.
1652843|CDR|And it will be in my - it will be in my flight line stereo, and it's going to be bag 557. And I'll take an after and show you where it came from.
1652856|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1652856|CDR|This is the easist part of the rock in the world to work. Man, here's a big - here's a big white clast. There's one on top about a foot and a half across, and here's one - must be 2 feet across - 3 feet. And that's in the blue-gray.
1652917|CDR|Feel like a kid playing in a sandbox.
1652929|LMP|Well, Bob, I think I've done the best I can. I would - I'd say that they're pretty clearly inclusions of blue-gray in the anorthositic gabbro here near the contact.
1652944|CC|Okay. And Gene, your bag is hanging by one hook there. Be careful, if you can - or LMP - -
1652952|CDR|Okay. I gave you 557, I believe. Didn't I?
1652956|CC|Roger. We have that one. And whoever is giving us 557 - -
1653000|CDR|Okay, I'll have Jack fix by bag.
1653002|CC|Yes.
1653007|LMP|Okay, Bob, by accident - I didn't think I could do it but I got a sample of the inclusions. And it's in bag 539.
1653020|CDR|Hey, Jack, that's your bag that's hanging by one hook. Let me go get it.
1653024|LMP|Oh, they're talking to me, huh?
1653025|CDR|Yes, because I didn't - -
1653026|CC|Yes.
1653027|CDR|I didn't think they could see me. I'm way up on top.
1653034|LMP|And it's blue-gray with light colored - -
1653039|CDR|Put these in my bag.
1653040|LMP|- - inclusions in it.
1653041|CDR|All right.
1653041|LMP|But the whole thing seems to be pretty well altered, or metamorphosed - compared to the major rock we sampled - to the other blue-gray rock.
1653055|LMP|This bag is terrible. I can't - it won't latch.
1653100|CDR|Man, there's a dark hole in there.
1653101|LMP|Don't let me - I'm not -
1653112|CDR|Here's another bag to put in there before you go.
1653114|LMP|Oh, okay. It won't latch.
1653121|CDR|Well - -
1653122|LMP|Not at this angle.
1653127|CDR|Put the thumb on one side, and I'll - -
1653128|LMP|It's dead or something. There, that's pretty good.
1653131|CDR|Now let me fix your bag.
1653140|CC|And, 17 - -
1653140|LMP|Okay, Bob, I think that inclusion will give you an example of what - -
1653150|CDR|That'll stay on.
1653150|LMP|- what this thing - what the anorthositic gabbro did to the blue-gray breccia.
1653158|CC|Okay. We copy that. And we're ready for you guys to leave this rock and press on and either get the rake soil and cores near that crater down below the rock just a shade, or else go on to some other different variety rocks in the area.
1653220|LMP|Well, I tell you, going down to that crater is not a problem. Getting back up is.
1653229|CC|Okay, well, find a decent area to get the rake soil from a couple of cores.
1653231|LMP|Tell you what, Gene, I could go down there and start a rake, and you could come down there.
1653235|CDR|Okay. I - Yes, I don't think you ought to try and walk back up, Jack. Let me get a pan from right here where I got this sample.
1653241|LMP|Okay. I'm going to come over and - I'll go get the rake and get the - -
1653244|CC|17, it's not that vital to get to that crater. We just need a good place for a rake soil and a double - a single core.
1653250|LMP|... Get uphill a little bit, if you can, for the pan, so that you don't - so you see my other pan station.
1653300|CDR|Where was it?
1653301|LMP|It was over there in that crater, just uphill from the Rover.
1653304|CDR|I'm going up there.
1653306|CC|Hey, and, 17, we aren't all that gung ho about that particular crater, if it's that much of a Job to get down to it and back up. Just - we just need a decent place for a rake soil sample and a single core.
1653319|LMP|Okay.
1653320|CDR|Bob, we don't move around from here too much. I tell you, these slopes are something else.
1653324|CC|Yes. We agree with that, from what we see on the television. So use your judgement, and get them where it's the best place
1653332|CDR|Well, you might take a look at me walking up. But I don't think I can get to the top. I just got to get a place I can get a pan from, right here. Right in this little hole. Okay, now I left the gnomon down there.
1653352|LMP|Okay. I'll have to go get it. I think they're set up right here near the Rover.
1653358|CDR|I think I'll go and save some water, back on INTERMEDIATE. Okay.
1653403|CC|Copy that.
1653405|CDR|Hope my lens is clean. Bob, from up here, the light mantle is not evident until you see the anglular reflection up on the scarp. Very thin-like patches might be evident out on the valley, but not nearly as pronounced as I might have thought from this altitude.
1653453|CDR|Oh, and there's Challenger. Holy Smoley. You know, Jack, when we finish with Station 8, we will have covered this whole valley from corner to corner.
1653518|LMP|That was the idea.
1653519|CDR|Yes, but I didn't think we'd ever really quite get to that far corner. Not 2, but this other one. And we're going to make it.
1653530|LMP|Bob, that blue-gray rock near the contact with the anorthositic gabbro does get some vesicles in it. I think they'll show up in Gene's pictures.
1653551|CC|Okay. We have that too, Jack.
1653557|CDR|Okay. I just ran out of film at 160. And I'm about two pictures short of the pan, and they're upslope. I think I can cover most of that with the 500.
1653619|CC|Okay, Gene. You got to go to the Rover and change your mag now.
1653624|CDR|Well, Jack's going to need some help from me.
1653628|CC|Okay. Let me know when you - -
1653630|LMP|I'm starting to rake.
1653632|CC|Let me know when you get to the Rover to change the mags after you get done with that, and I'll tell you what mag to change.
1653634|CDR|Jack, if you got - -
1653639|CC|But press on and help Jack with those first.
1653639|CDR|Jack, if you got enough film, I'll just come and help you.
1653642|LMP|Okay.
1653654|LMP|Okay?
1653654|CDR|Yes. Remind me to dust my camera, too, will you?
1653702|LMP|Don't forget to dust your camera.
1653704|CC|Okay. We'll keep track of that for you, Gene.
1653707|PAO|Gene Cernan took that tumble.
1653709|CDR|Okay. Did you get any before pictures?
1653712|LMP|I'm getting them now.
1653713|CDR|Okay.
1653715|LMP|(Laughter) it ain't easy, McGee.
1653717|CDR|Man, I tell you, these slopes are great. I wouldn't mind being up on top coming down; but - hey, that boulder track is quite a trench.
1653725|LMP|Yes, sir.
1653727|CDR|That thing must be a meter or 2 deep, huh?
1653729|LMP|Okay; the big rake. Well, I think I'll try - -
1653736|CDR|Wouldn't it be easier to rake downhill.
1653737|LMP|It would, but the stuff wouldn't stay in.
1653740|CDR|(Laughter)
1653742|LMP|Right?
1653743|CDR|Well, I don't know.
1653744|LMP|It's a thought.
1653750|CDR|Make sure you get that one by the - -
1653752|LMP|Yes, I will.
1653810|LMP|We're not really supposed to be selective about raking.
1653814|CDR|Well, you're not; you're just covering the area.
1653818|LMP|That's why I set up there.
1653834|CDR|A selective sample is better than no sample at all. Let me put some in there.
1653841|LMP|Okay.
1653847|CDR|Bag 558.
1653851|CC|Copy 558.
1653856|CDR|Bob, most of them are -
1653857|LMP|Let me go another couple of flights.
1653858|CDR|Okay. There's one a couple of inches. Most of them are an inch or so or smaller. They're angular to subrounded fragments. Some of them look like inclusions. As a matter of fact, the ones that are broken open look like some of the light-colored inclusions we saw in the big boulder. The others are too dust covered to say anything about.
1653917|LMP|A couple of them look fairly coarsely crystalline. Okay. Put these in there.
1653926|CDR|Big deal. Now we ended up with three more.
1653932|LMP|Okay. Let me get an after, such as it is. Oh, we want the -
1653938|CDR|They want the soil here.
1653939|LMP|Soil - that's right.
1653941|CC|That's affirm.
1653946|LMP|Okay. You want to put that in?
1653947|CDR|Yes, I'd better put it in before I - Okay. Let's try for the soil. 559's the soil.
1654003|CC|Okay. Copy that. And, 17, our present plans from the back room are that we'd like to get the single core, the 500 millimeter shots - and, I guess, maybe one could do one, and one could do the other - and then we'd like to press on and do a short Station 7, unless you think you've got a fair variety of rocks here. The feeling is to do that ... variety of rocks.
1654024|LMP|Yes.
1654024|CDR|Little more, little more, little more.
1654031|CDR|Okay, Bob. I'll get the core and let Jack get the 500. 559 is the kilogram of soil. I think we've pretty much covered the general, variety we've seen here. I think we've seen most of them in that boulder.
1654043|CC|Okay. And so we'd like to go on to Station 7, then, when you get the 500 and the core, in hopes of finding a variation of boulders along the front.
1654103|CDR|Okay. Let me know when you get it. Okay. The after. Okay, why don't you get the 500, and I'll get the core.
1654114|LMP|And the LMP's on 120.
1654116|CC|Copy 120 there. And, Gene, if you want to change, we recommended magazine Foxtrot or Fran, as the case may be.
1654124|CDR|Okay. Will try Foxtrot - Franny. Don't forget to get that boulder track.
1654130|CC|And while you're at it, Gene, you might remember to dust your camera when you're leaning over the seat.
1654138|LMP|Let me look at your camera.
1654149|CDR|Oh, man, if this Rover wasn't here, we'd roll downhill.
1654152|LMP|Hey, Bob, I think we could use an upper here if you want to save the lowers.
1654158|CDR|I think so, too.
1654159|LMP|Whichever you want. Do you want your - -
1654201|CDR|No, I'll get it. Why don't you get your 500, and I'll - -
1654203|LMP|Okay. But do you want a core? Watch the fender.
1654206|CDR|The core's in there, isn't it?
1654207|LMP|Well there's some under my seat if you want to use those.
1654209|CDR|I'll use those.
1654210|CC|Stand by, Jack. We have three lowers and two uppers, so we'd just as soon use the extra lower here in the single core. That'll give us two uppers and two lowers left - -
1654219|LMP|Okay.
1654219|CC|- - for doubles.
1654223|LMP|There should be a lower in there, Geno.
1654225|CDR|Yes, Bob, any special place you want that? Just out here on the slope?
1654229|CC|That's affirm.
1654229|LMP|Should have put the gnomon up. Well -
1654230|CC|Just out there on the slope. I guess if you saw a crater you might look at that, but primarily we're looking at the crater.
1654236|CDR|You don't have any ... I'll get it. I'll get it, Jack. Don't worry. Okay. We have a couple of dents in our fen - in our wheels. That's better than having a flat tire.
1654322|CDR|Did he say in a crater?
1654330|LMP|I'm not sure what he said. Thinking - How do - how do I get this doggone -
1654339|CDR|This turn to come off?
1654343|LMP|You got to unlock it.
1654345|CDR|Yes, it is unlocked.
1654346|LMP|Okay. Now push down and turn.
1654349|CDR|Okay. I got it.
1654352|LMP|How am I going to see up there to shoot this thing?
1654356|CDR|Well, why don't you lean against the rock? Go over there and lean against it.
1654401|LMP|Well, I have to do something. I was trying to get so I could lean against the Rover, but that ain't going to work.
1654408|CDR|The Rover isn't steady enough for you to lean against.
1654411|LMP|Well, it's steady enough. There's just no place to lean.
1654414|CC|Okay. And, Jack, and if you'll listen for a minute, I'll tell you some possible 500-millimeter targets the people have in mind. One, the LM, if you can see it from there. Two, Nansen, if you can see it from there. Three, Lara; and four, Shorty. In other words, I guess they're talking about looking along your traverse from yesterday. It would be mostly the back shots, apparently. And then, also, the South Massif, and I don't know what you can get of boulder tracks leading up the North Massif. And most of those will be looking downhill towards the LM, stations 2, 3, and 4. Over. Nansen, Lara, and Shorty.
1654453|LMP|I got you, Bob.
1654455|CDR|Yes, the LM is visible by the way.
1654532|LMP|Okay. I got a set of the - the - what looks like the outcrop from which the boulder came.
1654616|LMP|I'm afraid they're moved a little bit.
1654632|LMP|Oh, I can't - That's it. I got a few pictures looking up the boulder track and then off to the right - to the left a little bit - and one off to the right. And I think - I'm not sure how well they overlap; that's just an awful hard shot.
1654653|CC|Okay; good on that. And if you're done with that, have you got a frame count - or you're still taking them, I guess, it looks like.
1654705|LMP|Yes.
1654714|CDR|Okay, my camera is clean. Magazine Foxtrot - is on about frame 2, and I cycled through it. And I've got the core all set, and I'm going to go get it. And I didn't hear where you said to put it, Bob.
1654738|CC|Anywhere.
1654743|CDR|Oh, man, you're easy.
1654746|CC|And did you get your camera - -
1654747|CDR|Anywhere. Not the bottom of a small crater, huh?
1654754|CC|Any place. And did you get your camera dusted?
1654757|CDR|Yes. I got it all dusted and the mag's changed.
1654804|CC|Good.
1654805|CDR|It's core 48.
1654808|CC|Copy that.
1654811|CDR|Okay. I'll even get you a picture of it.
1654821|CDR|Oh me. Oh my.
1654825|PAO|EVA time 2 hours and 15 minutes.
1654850|CDR|Oh me. Oh my. Can you get the LM from there?
1654853|LMP|Yes.
1654856|CDR|That core went in very easy, Bob. I pushed it in about a quarter of the way. And about another five or six whacks, and it's in all the way.
1654930|CDR|Okay. Come on out now, baby.
1654937|LMP|Okay, Bob. Shorty, and Station 3, and Station 2, and what else.
1654952|CC|And any sort of outcrop you see in the South Massif.
1654959|LMP|I thought we shot those.
1655001|CC|Okay. If you got those, fine.
1655005|LMP|No, I mean the other day.
1655008|CC|Well - -
1655008|LMP|I'll try again.
1655009|CC|Stereo is stereo is stereo, I guess.
1655010|LMP|Okay, and I got you a little soil me - Well, but it's not stereo; it's right along the same line. Little soil mechanics of the hole, which stayed intact; very nice and round.
1655022|CC|Okay. We copy that.
1655027|LMP|Okay. Oh, man.
1655038|CDR|Yes, sir, we got a couple of dented tires.
1655043|LMP|Okay, my hands have had it.
1655046|CC|Okay; good enough.
1655046|LMP|You aren't going to get anything else out of me if I keep taking pictures.
1655049|CC|And, Gene, what's a dented tire?
1655055|CDR|A dented tire is a little - oh, a little golfball size or smaller indentation in the mesh. How does that sound to you? Doesn't hurt anything.
1655107|CC|That sounds like a dented tire; that's how it sounds.
1655109|LMP|Frame 31, Bob.
1655110|CC|Cappy - copy frame 31.
1655112|CDR|That's sort of like what it is.
1655119|LMP|Okay. LMP was what? 120? I guess we can get to the next station with that.
1655125|CC|Yes, Roger.
1655126|CDR|Yes, I got a brand new mag out.
1655127|CC|And we'd like to get you guys rolling as soon as feasible there.
1655133|LMP|Yes, sir. It's our policy.
1655136|CDR|Okay. I'll need your rammer, so if you'll just turn right.
1655144|LMP|Good timing. Pin's out; core tube is safe. In full.
1655157|CDR|I knew it was. Okay. You take this and put this under your seat, if you want, Jack. And I'll get the TGE. Oh, let me put your shovel back on for you. I'll get it.
1655214|LMP|Get that?
1655214|CDR|Yes.
1655229|LMP|Don't lose that. Boy, if you do -
1655232|LMP|Okay. Did you give them the number?
1655234|CDR|Yes, they got the number.
1655235|LMP|Under the LMP's seat.
1655235|CC|Roger. We got it. Copy that - under the LMP's seat.
1655241|LMP|(Laughter) I'm sneaking up on the TGE.
1655246|CDR|You need some help?
1655247|LMP|No. No, I was - just sneaking up, that's all.
1655251|CDR|... let you lean on me.
1655252|LMP|No, I got it.
1655256|CDR|670, 109, 801; 670, 109, 801.
1655305|CC|Okay. We copy that.
1655313|LMP|I wish we - the one thing I didn't do. While you're doing that -
1655325|CDR|...
1655327|LMP|Didn't get pictures of those foliated vesicles. I don't think the ones you had were in that kind of rock.
1655340|CDR|I don't want to lose that thing, so I guess - -
1655343|CC|Okay, 17, when you get back on here, we don't need any charges, and we'll leave the sets turned off.
1655354|LMP|I'm not sure. Did you turn it off, Gene?
1655356|CDR|Yes, I turned it off. I turned it off. Okay. Let me see. We want to move on to 7 here. Rake, talus, documented core, you got your stereos, we got two pans, TGE, camera. Okay, we're going to head east and look for Station 7 - block variation, contact change, and get a different sample of rocks. Okay, I sure want to get one or two of those nice ones in the big bag while you're over there.
1655431|CC|Okay - -
1655431|LMP|Open the gate, and I'll bring one.
1655432|CC|- - Seven - Okay. And let me know when you get ready to get back on the Rover there, 17.
1655446|CDR|Guess what isn't opening again. Should, though. It's all set right.
1655456|CC|You could put them under Jack's seat if it's easier.
1655513|CDR|Okay. What do you want done to the SEP while I'm here? Do you want the blanket stayed - left open?
1655515|CC|Okay, we'd - Negative. We'd like the blankets closed and taped down again, if possible, and both switches left off. We won't touch it again until Station 8.
1655528|CDR|Oh, tape's not going to stick anymore, I'm afraid.
1655531|CC|Well, try.
1655532|LMP|Big bag open?
1655533|CDR|Yes, it's all open. All set.
1655535|LMP|Get me a - I need a normal sample bag for one here. It's pretty fragile.
1655540|CDR|Okay. Oh, that doggoned thing's not going to - That tape is full of dust now. Okay. Wait a minute, Jack.
1655549|LMP|Here, let me get this big one. I'm about ready to drop it. It looks like a gabbro.
1655600|CDR|There's sample bag 560.
1655605|CC|Copy 560.
1655605|LMP|And 560 has an undoc - undocumented except by the pans - very white - looks like a crushed anorthosite. It looks like the - some of the inclusions in the breccia - in the gray breccia - gray and recrystallized breccia.
1655624|CC|Okay. We copy that.
1655624|CDR|Jack, when you get around, and we close this gate, you might try and hit that - top of that SEP down again.
1655629|LMP|I will.
1655634|CDR|Hey, Bob, you're staying keyed an awful long time. We can hear a lot of what's going on back there. Wait a minute. Let me get this out of the way. Okay. Close it. Yes. That's got it.
1655653|LMP|... it's -
1655654|CDR|That's got it. Okay.
1655655|LMP|Oop, oop, oop. Why'd that come off?
1655657|CDR|Well, because it's not locked. It's ... that never was locked.
1655659|LMP|(Laughter) We lucked out.
1655714|CDR|Okay. We're moving. Sort of.
1655720|CC|And, before you get on, remember to close the battery covers if they -
1655726|CDR|Yes.
1655733|LMP|Your camera lens looks all right, Geno.
1655736|CDR|Yes, I dusted it already.
1655737|LMP|Oh.
1655741|CDR|Okay. Cover closed -
1655744|LMP|Okay. Do they want it on or off? Leave it off, huh?
1655747|CDR|Leave it off, but try and close that cover as best you can.
1655750|LMP|Well, I'm afraid the tape has had it.
1655753|CDR|I know it.
1655754|LMP|You want us to tape it again, Bob? What did you do with the tape?
1655759|CC|If you can grab the tape right off, but don't spend a lot of time on it.
1655806|LMP|What did you do with that tape?
1655809|CC|Let's worry about - let's worry about it at Station 7, if we're going to worry about it. Press on.
1655815|LMP|Okay.
1655817|CDR|Yes. Let's - let's forget it now. It's too hard, to work on there, and it's not going to take just a minute. It's going to take too much time. I'm not sure I can get back on here.
1655824|LMP|Well, let me give you a hand. We need any a - we don't need any -
1655828|CDR|No.
1655829|LMP|Nothing. As a matter of fact -
1655831|CDR|I can drive, Jack.
1655832|LMP|Why don't you drive down and get - so you're not - You can get on -
1655835|CDR|You can go downhill very easy.
1655837|LMP|Yes.
1655838|CDR|Okay. Let me get the TV; The battery covers are closed - Let me carry - -
1655843|LMP|Why don't you just go down there.
1655844|CDR|- - I'll carry the Rover samples just in case.
1655847|LMP|Got it?
1655847|CDR|Okay. I'll get that out of your way, too.
1655854|LMP|Okay. I'll head down to that, ... that side hill over to those boulders right over there and then see if that's any change.
1655909|CDR|Okay. You might, if you get another sample - a large sample, you might grab it, and we'll throw it in the footpan here - and - and I'll see if I can't find a level spot to - -
1655919|LMP|I sort of ought to have my scoop, too.
1655920|CDR|- - help you get on. No, don't take too much; just take that. That's all you need.
1655925|LMP|How about letting me have your hammer, then?
1655927|CDR|Well -
1655929|CC|Okay; and, IT, can you verify that the - that the gnomon is back in the Rover?
1655937|CDR|Gnomon is on the Rover. The TGE is on the Rover.
1655941|LMP|The rake.
1655942|CDR|The rake is on the Rover. The scoop's on the Rover. We got the - you put the core under your pan, right?
1655948|LMP|Yes, that's right.
1655949|CDR|Okay. I'm going to power up and see if I can't come down and get you.
1655955|LMP|It's fun walking downhill. Boy, that boulder track is impressive.
1660006|CC|Okay; and, 17, when you get moving - when you get moving we want to get, and I quote, a maximum variety of hand samples with a minimum amount of documentation, in a minimum amount of time at Station 7. It's just an attempt to see what kind of variety we can get along the face of the front. Over.
1660028|CDR|Roger. Okay. Well, I'm not sure I can get down without ending up in your seat.
1660038|PAO|Station 7 is 8 tenths of a kilometer east of Station 6, still along the base of the North Massif.
1660040|LMP|Need some help?
1660041|CDR|No ...
1660042|LMP|I shouldn't have left.
1660045|CDR|No, no. I don't need any help. I'll get on.
1660100|LMP|I probably ought to turn my water off of MAX if that's where it is. It's cold. I don't want to run out today.
1660156|CDR|Well, the roll indicator says 15 degrees; and the pitch indicator says about 12. I don't know if I believe all that. Bob, you with us?
1660206|CC|Go ahead. Right. We're with you.
1660210|CDR|Okay. I'm rolling.
1660212|CC|Copy that.
1660235|CDR|Man, this is still a slope. Jack, I'm going to pull around and in the front of the way you're facing.
1660244|LMP|I can go down - There's a crater over here. Don't drive through it. Oh, there you are.
1660256|CDR|This is much better. How is this?
1660257|LMP|That's great.
1660301|CDR|We ought to be able to pick up lots of those fragments out in that field out there.
1660307|LMP|Be right with you.
1660308|CDR|Okay. Bob, I just came downslope reading 193/3.1 - just about 100 meters to pick up Jack.
1660319|CC|Okay, copy that.
1660323|LMP|Okay. Bag 48 Yankee has a sample of about a half - one-third-meter boulder that was lying in - that's sitting right smack dab in a little crater of it's own.
1660347|CC|Copy that.
1660348|CDR|Oh, Jack.
1660349|LMP|What?
1660350|CDR|Oh, you Just kicked a snowstorm of dust across here.
1660352|LMP|I'm sorry. I just fell, too.
1660355|CDR|Did you? You all right?
1660356|LMP|Yes. Watch your hammer.
1660358|CDR|Yes.
1660400|LMP|Okay.
1660403|CDR|I got to drop it in the pan here. Hold on to it, I think.
1660410|LMP|Couldn't help that one.
1660413|CDR|Yes. I think we can get some more level spots. I can dust this thing back there.
1660416|LMP|Am I really on?
1660420|CDR|You're high. You're twisted. Go away from me one twist.
1660424|LMP|Okay.
1660428|CDR|Is it caught in something? Yes, it is. You're - oh, wait a minute - get up, get up, get up. You've got - you're sitting on - get up.
1660433|LMP|What am I sitting on?
1660434|CDR|Get out. You didn't put this away. Wait a minute. Get up, out - all the way.
1660440|LMP|Oh, that thing.
1660441|CDR|Yes, this thing.
1660442|LMP|That's right. That's why you're sitting high. I knew I'd forget that. Okay. Now, let me get this thing out. Okay. Okay. Let's press. Better get latched.
1660522|CDR|Okay. All set?
1660524|LMP|Yes.
1660525|CDR|Okay.
1660536|CDR|We're rolling, Bob.
1660538|LMP|LMP frame - is 130.
1660547|CDR|You got a lot of static now?
1660549|LMP|Yes.
1660550|CDR|Okay.
1660552|LMP|Hey, you got a rock on your right. I guess you - -
1660553|CDR|Yes. I got them.
1660553|LMP|...
1660558|CDR|I got the low gain set. Hello, Houston. Do you read?
1660602|CC|Roger. We read loud and clear.
1660606|CDR|Okay.
1660610|LMP|Okay; how about that field, not this block but there's sort of a collection of them - -
1660615|CDR|Yes. Way out there - -
1660616|LMP|- - way out there, about 300 meters or so.
1660619|CDR|Oh, at least. Yes.
1660622|LMP|Oh; going into the Sun, I can't see a thing to tell you about Wessex Cleft.
1660627|CC|Okay. Station 7 is nominally 208 and 3.3, but it's any group of any significant boulders you want to stop at in reality.
1660637|CDR|Understand.
1660644|LMP|Oh, easy.
1660648|CDR|You feel like you're on a downslope over there?
1660649|LMP|Yes. I feel like you're about ready to spin out downhill any minute.
1660652|CDR|Do you? I don't feel that at all up here.
1660700|LMP|Bob, it's hard to give you much, looking into the Sun the way we are.
1660706|CDR|We must be about 200 meters up the slope, looking at that little valley down there, Jack. Am I right?
1660710|LMP|Yes. I think you're right. The pattern on the slope really doesn't look much different than on the light mantle. Matter of fact, it looks very much like light mantle, except for these large blocks that are in it.
1660723|CC|Okay. Copy that. And you guys may still have your visors up. We can't tell, but you might be better off with them down, if you've forgotten they they're up.
1660733|LMP|Well, boy, I can't see. My hands work just as well as my visor, as a matter of fact.
1660741|CDR|No, I can't believe - mine could be up.
1660743|LMP|You've got a crater right in front of you.
1660745|CDR|Yes. I got it.
1660747|LMP|Okay. That looks like a pretty good pile to work on.
1660749|CDR|Yes. Let's go over in there.
1660750|LMP|Hey, wait a minute. Okay.
1660751|CDR|Bob, what heading are you going to want me to park on? I want to get in that flat area, Jack, sol can dust the radiators.
1660757|LMP|Yes.
1660757|CC|We have no constraints, Gene. This is going to be a very short station. Probably not more than 10 or 15 minutes. But just to grab, as I say a maximum variety of hand samples with a minimum amount of documentation and a minimum amount of time.
1660812|CDR|Okay. We do a pan, and pick up a lot of those small ones, Jack.
1660815|LMP|Yes.
1660817|CDR|Rather than trying to chip.
1660822|CC|Okay. We would like to have the - -
1660824|CDR|I'd like to see us a little more level.
1660825|CC|- - TV camera and its mirrors and stuff dusted there, however. But we won't do anything to the battery.
1660830|LMP|I thought you were going to stop back there.
1660833|CDR|Well, okay. I was going out - out here around this big one.
1660838|LMP|I'm sorry. I misunderstood you.
1660840|CDR|Yes. See, there's a lot of little ones up in here I want to -
1660851|CDR|Okay. Do not do anything to the batteries. Understand.
1660853|CC|Roger.
1660854|LMP|I can't figure out where you're going to stop.
1660856|CDR|Right in here - right here to give you as much of a level spot as I can. That's about as level a spot as I can find. I'm inside the slope of a crater.
1660904|CDR|Bob, I'm at 200/3.3.
1660907|CC|Copy that.
1660922|LMP|You want me to help you with it - that thing, Geno?
1660924|CDR|No, I'll get it. Only one guy can do it.
1660931|CDR|I just - we'll take - you take a pan before, and we'll start picking up some of those samples, and I'll take a pan afterward.
1660940|LMP|Well, let's see here.
1660948|CDR|See what kind of variety we can get here.
1660950|LMP|There is another one of our blue-gray breccias, I think, over there; recrystallized breccias with some of that crushed anorthosite in it. I think right in here I'm going to take the pan at about - -
1661008|CC|And, Jack, what's your frame count?
1661012|LMP|131.
1661014|CC|Okay. Press on.
1661022|LMP|Bob, I'm going to take the pan at 11 - feet, so you can see the fragments that we are going to pick up here. Then we can take another one at - for location work.
1661040|CC|Copy that.
1661100|PAO|The picture's coming in now. EVA time 2 hours 38 minutes.
1661111|CDR|Should have it, Bob.
1661113|CC|We've got a TV. And, I repeat, we'd like to get some dust both on the mirror - dusting of the mirror and the lens of the TV; TCU and the TV.
1661126|CDR|Let me get you - let me get you out of the Sun.
1661139|CDR|I wouldn't do this for anybody but you, you know that.
1661144|CC|Okay. Looks good, Gene. Thank you.
1661207|CDR|You know what? I'm getting tired of dusting.
1661228|CDR|My primary tool, the dustbrush and the hammer - and my head. Okay. You ready to start picking?
1661243|LMP|Picking.
1661244|CDR|Okay.
1661251|CC|And - -
1661251|CDR|You notice the temperature difference with that high Sun angle?
1661256|CC|Roger. You're probably letting in a lot of infrared through that - without having that gold visor down, too. That's sort of an infrared shield.
1661305|CDR|Yes, but mine's been down all the time, Bob.
1661307|CC|Copy that.
1661307|CDR|Except in the shade.
1661312|LMP|Okay, 540 is the first bag of selected samples.
1661319|CC|Copy that.
1661323|LMP|Okay. I'm going to leave it open, but don't let me - let me get -
1661325|CDR|Here, put that one in there.
1661328|LMP|Wait a minute, let's get a bag on it. We're getting too many rocks, and we don't know where they came from.
1661339|LMP|I don't think it will fit, will it?
1661342|CDR|Yes, we'll wrap it a little bit. ... it will fit. ... fit.
1661407|LMP|Okay. Bag 541 is partially around another big rock in Gene's - Gene's collection bag.
1661427|CDR|Did you get pictures of this thing here?
1661429|LMP|Yes; well, not the big rock yet. Not in focus anyway.
1661433|CDR|I got to do that.
1661436|LMP|I was just collecting in this area.
1661438|CDR|Why don't you keep grabbing a few, and I'm going to -
1661442|LMP|That's what I'm doing.
1661443|CDR|That's one of the blue-gray rocks, Bob. And it's got a light-colored fragment that runs the full height of it, about a meter and a half thick. And then it's got the gray or blue-gray rock on the other side. As a matter of fact - Let me look at it closely. It's a fragment in it all right.
1661518|CC|Okay. Copy that, Gene. And remember to document around the corner if you're trying to get some photo documentation of the boulder.
1661535|CDR|Bob, I wouldn't be absolutely positive, but it sure looks like I see a dikelet in here that's in the inclusion. And I'm going to get a closeup stereo of it. I'd call it a dikelet, if you pinned me down.
1661548|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1661551|LMP|Pin him - pin him down.
1661610|CDR|I wish I could break a sample right off. Here's another one. It is a dikelet! There's three or four of them.
1661621|CC|Okay. Copy that, Gene. Very good.
1661629|CDR|Oh - me; oh, my. The material in the dike looks - Yes, it is, it is, it's not covering it. It's between the - it's between the - lighter colored rock, and it's the blue-gray rock.
1661709|LMP|542 is another bag of goodies.
1661713|CC|Copy that.
1661714|LMP|Gene, let me get rid of this.
1661715|CDR|Oh, wait a minute. I got - I got - Well, maybe it isn't a dikelet. Maybe it's just a screen covering, a flow covering.
1661723|LMP|No, you got - They're - they're dikes.
1661724|CDR|Let me - let me -
1661725|LMP|They're little veinlets of -
1661727|CDR|Let me get this whole thing in a bag.
1661731|CDR|I got a - I got a rock, Bob. It's fractured, primarily around the dike. It's in several pieces, but we're going to put it all in one bag.
1661739|LMP|543.
1661742|CDR|Some of the men are going to have to assemble that.
1661742|CC|Copy, 543.
1661750|LMP|Here.
1661750|CDR|Here, I got - I got - Let me get it piece by piece.
1661757|LMP|Okay. We need to get a - put one of those dikes in another bag. Bob, it looks like some fraction of the blue-gray material has obviously - -
1661812|CDR|Not too full. That's all right.
1661813|LMP|- - intruded. Huh? Now, can you get that dike there?
1661817|CDR|Piece of it?
1661818|LMP|This thing.
1661819|CDR|Yes.
1661819|LMP|Can you get that?
1661820|CDR|I can get it right here.
1661822|LMP|No, I think - No, get the piece with the - you get more of it, right there.
1661825|CDR|Yes. It's this soft, white inclusion again. It breaks pretty easy.
1661835|CDR|Oh, it's got to be a dike. Look at that.
1661837|LMP|It is. It is.
1661842|CDR|Okay.
1661843|LMP|Okay, 544.
1661845|CC|Copy that.
1661845|CDR|Oh, yes, it is because I just broke into it.
1661847|LMP|Yes.
1661847|CDR|I'm looking - -
1661848|CC|And we'd like to have you guys moving again in 5 minutes to get to Station 8 on time.
1661856|LMP|Yes, sir. Looks like - although the blue-gray up on the hill looked like a fragment breccia, if this is still related, then it's - been some partial melting at some time.
1661916|CDR|There's a preserved contact between the dike and the - -
1661917|LMP|That's what I wanted.
1661919|CDR|- - white material.
1661920|LMP|That's what I wanted.
1661920|CDR|Why don't we get this big piece of dike now?
1661921|LMP|See if you can get - Whoa! Don't hit it again. There, you've still got some - still got some contact there.
1661931|CDR|Now, there's some good contact. Man, that'll do it.
1661934|LMP|Okay.
1661935|CDR|That'll do it.
1661936|LMP|Dike and intruded rock in 544. Now, these dikes are a dark bluish-gray. And it looks like there are some - it looks like they're very finely crystalline - maybe with some - -
1661951|CDR|Get my bag. I'm taking some closeups.
1661952|LMP|- - very fine phenocrysts.
1661955|LMP|Okay.
1661958|CC|Okay. We copy that.
1661959|LMP|We ought to get - Well - we ought to get a piece of the normal gray that the dikes are coming from. You got your hammer handy still?
1662009|CDR|Yes. I want to - I want to get - -
1662012|LMP|Go ahead.
1662013|CDR|- - finish documenting this thing.
1662020|LMP|Hey, over here on this side, it looks like the vesicular anorthositic gabbro.
1662030|CDR|I got to get some regular pictures on this set. Okay. Here's the - if that one won't come off, this one will. Got it?
1662041|LMP|And - Yes. 561. That's a sample of the gray, looks like recrystallized breccia that the dikes are continuous with.
1662057|CC|Okay. And a -
1662059|LMP|And a - Bob, that's my turn to say "and a." And the - the vesicular rocks -
1662118|CDR|Let me finish the stereo around the corner here.
1662122|CC|Okay. And you guys have dropped the scoop there on the ground. And we're ready for you guys to leave.
1662130|CDR|I know you are.
1662134|CC|And you might grab one FSR on the way out.
1662141|CDR|Okay. We'll do that.
1662142|LMP|Okay. There's that one. The vesicular anorthositic gabbro is in 5 - What is it? 62.
1662154|CDR|62.
1662155|CDR|I'll get this in there, and you take the -
1662158|LMP|I got to get the scoop.
1662158|CDR|Scoop, and I'll get the hammer. Then make sure your bag is closed.
1662202|LMP|Yes, I've got to check yours, too. Let me get uphill from you, though.
1662204|CDR|Wait a minute. Give me the hammer. Hows that? Can you get it now?
1662212|LMP|This is one of the worst bags we've had ... It just doesn't stay down. Probably - If we get time somewhere, we ought to change that out.
1662234|CDR|Two of the corners are - -
1662235|LMP|Yes. Well -
1662237|CDR|How's she doing?
1662237|LMP|It's okay. It'll hold for a while.
1662252|LMP|Okay.
1662256|CDR|Okay. Here's an FSR that's about -
1662300|CC|And, Jack, you're untied on one - one side of your bag is undone again.
1662307|LMP|Oh, I'll get it - for you.
1662313|CDR|Here's a football-size rock that was 50 percent varied.
1662316|LMP|Can you grip it? I got the gate open.
1662326|CDR|I'm going to get your bag. Hey! Did you see the way I handled that hammer?
1662329|LMP|Yes.
1662329|CDR|Tell you what, I'm getting accustomed to things.
1662338|CDR|That gate's a little sluggish, too, Jack.
1662346|CDR|Boy, I think everything is so full of dust, nothing wants to move anymore.
1662354|LMP|Okay. That one looked like a piece of the gray rock, I think.
1662357|CDR|Yes. I'll bet I didn't push the gravimeter here. Did I, Bob?
1662400|CC|No. We'll get it at Station 8.
1662402|LMP|No. They didn't tell us to.
1662405|CDR|Okay. Jack, you're going to have to close the gate, and I'll have to hold the big bag over the top.
1662409|LMP|Okay.
1662410|CC|Okay. And, Jack, before you leave, we'd like you to change mags before you get to - before you leave this station.
1662418|LMP|Yes, sir. I'll do that. No. ...
1662423|CDR|Wait a minute.
1662424|LMP|I've got it.
1662425|CDR|Yes, but don't push.
1662426|LMP|I won't.
1662426|CDR|One of those little ... strip - Okay, now you can push. Okay, that's locked. Well, it's in. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Let me see what's going on in there. Oh, - we - this thing isn't - didn't - isn't released all the way. Pull it out this - that's ... Push. Okay, now -
1662455|LMP|There, you got it. It went in.
1662456|CDR|Okay, that's the dust again. Now, the bag's in the way. Let me get the bag out.
1662501|CC|Okay. And, Gene, you might get the -
1662503|CDR|Okay. Now shove it. That's too much. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Let me - Okay. Let me lift it up and do it. Well, wait a minute, I've got to tweak this thing. Okay, now shove it in. Right now.
1662525|LMP|That got it. No? Why don't you play with it, and I'll see if I can change a mag.
1662541|CDR|Well, dadgummit! That latch is -
1662548|LMP|... ?
1662549|CDR|I'll lock it. I'll just push that latch - that latch is just sticking, that's all. It's just dust again. I don't know what you do about those problems.
1662556|LMP|Okay, what magazine did you want, Bob?
1662558|CC|Magazine Mike, as in Mary.
1662600|CDR|Okay. It's latched.
1662604|CC|Gene, you might spend your time taking a - -
1662607|CDR|It's latched.
1662607|CC|- - standard 74-foot pan while Jack is changing his mag, if you got a chance there.
1662615|CDR|That's a splendid idea, sir. And that's exactly what I'll do. I don't mind going uphill, because it's so much fun coming down. Down in my little hole here. Oh! That's stability. That's stability.
1662707|CDR|Boy, Challenger looks a long way away. That's 3 kilometers, huh?.
1662720|LMP|Yes.
1662729|LMP|Okay. Mag's changed.
1662732|CC|Copy that.
1662740|LMP|Bob, those two bags with the goodies in them will have enough soil to be representative of the area we sampled, too, I think.
1662750|CC|Okay, copy that. And did you guys get your bags fixed up there, Jack? We were concerned about your SCB for a while.
1662758|LMP|No. We have to do that.
1662800|CDR|We'll do it.
1662801|CC|Okay.
1662801|LMP|Look at my camera lens and see how dirty it is.
1662814|CDR|Now it's the other hook that came - turn a little more left. No, it didn't - it didn't come off, I don't think - unless it - the bottom's off, but the bottom is not going to stay on. And it's not - you're not going to lose it. The tops are so tight you'll - Your bottom's loose, but that - that's because your harness shrunk a little bit.
1662833|LMP|Okay.
1662834|CC|Okay. It looked like, from time to time, guys, that only one of Jack's hooks was hooked. On the top.
1662841|CDR|Yes. They're both on, and they're both tight. And - -
1662845|CC|Okay. We copy.
1662846|CDR|- - I got the bottom hooked again, too.
1662851|LMP|Yes. Okay.
1662851|CDR|Bottom - but his bottom is not going to stay.
1662853|LMP|Okay. Check my lens.
1662856|CDR|Oh, your lens is beautiful!
1662857|LMP|... What's mine look like? Can you see it?
1662859|CDR|Yes, I know it's clean. Let's forget it.
1662901|CC|Okay; and, 17, as you get around to the front there, Gene, would you dust the LCRU; we don't think you did that here, and the top of the TV camera. And, Jack, would you take a peek at the SEP temperature for us?
1662915|CDR|I'm sorry, Bob. I already did that when we stopped at the station.
1662919|CC|Okay. It's ... - -
1662921|LMP|SEP temperature is about 115 -
1662927|CC|Copy. 115.
1662938|CC|Okay, then. Press on.
1662950|PAO|The television has been shut down while the crew travels south-east to Station 8, along the base of the Sculptured Hills. It will be up to crew discression just exactly where to sample along the base of these hills.
1662955|LMP|Okay.
1662956|CDR|Jack, this is tied down everywhere. You're just going to have to watch it.
1663012|LMP|I will. Okay, I'm in.
1663019|LMP|Hey, we seem to do an awful lot of down-Sun driving for - or up-Sun driving for all the planning we did (laughter).
1663026|CC|Yes. Wait until we come home from Station 8, then we'll take care of it.
1663031|CDR|Okay.
1663031|CC|And, Gene, as you get started there, we'd like a couple of Rover battery temperatures; at least one, we know what the other one says. And, Jack, we might get a frame count from you - Oh, excuse me, we already got that. Thank you, because you changed.
1663047|CDR|Well, okay, 110; and CDR, by the way, is about 73 on the frames.
1663054|CC|Copy that.
1663100|CDR|Okay, Bob. I'd like the range and bearing to the - We're roll - we -
1663104|LMP|How did you get in reverse?
1663105|CDR|I don't know.
1663108|CDR|Okay. We're rolling, and I'd like the range and bearing to the next -
1663114|CC|Okay. We want a heading of around 1 - we want a heading of around 125, and there's going to be a short - some - a small turn, and I think it's just at crater - the SWP Crater at 225 and 3.4, there'll be a slight turn. That's a heading of 125 is what you should start out on.
1663133|CDR|That's what I'm looking for.
1663135|CC|And 225 and 3.4 -
1663136|CDR|I though we were bypassing -
1663140|CC|No, we just do that - -
1663141|CDR|I thought we were bypassing SWP.
1663142|CC|- - through the mission planning stages.
1663148|CDR|225 and 3.4. Okay.
1663152|LMP|That's pretty close to nominal.
1663154|CDR|Yes. ... got my - Man, I tell you, this little navigation map I've got on my hand - cuff checklist is - is unquestionably the greatest thing that I've ever - done.
1663210|LMP|Sure hard to tell where north is on it, though.
1663217|CDR|Trying my best to keep you out of those slopes.
1663219|LMP|That's all right. I'm learning to tolerate it.
1663226|LMP|Okay, Bob. We're pretty close now to - no, really not. We're still about 100 meters, I think, from where the break in slope is - with the flank. And - but we're away from the block population except for scattered - two great big blocks out ahead of us, this side of the SWP Crater. And - but the average population is down to the 1 percent or less, again.
1663258|CDR|That average population really never changed up in here. Just the big blocks were around. I saw some little -
1663308|PAO|We estimate driving time to be 20 minutes. Distance about 2.3 kilometers.
1663313|LMP|Half-meter to one-third-meter, glass-lined, pit-bottom craters. Look at the size of those things!
1663327|CDR|Boy, aren't they big mothers - mamoos (laughter).
1663333|LMP|(Laughter) And it looks like they're probably the same thing that we sampled. They have the inclusions in them, white inclusions. They look like a mixture of gray and the - sort of a tan-gray of the - the gray of the recrystallized breccia, and the tan-gray of the anorthositic gabbro.
1663401|LMP|That must - Hey, look! There's Van Serg, blocky rim crater. That's the other side of Cochise there. See it?
1663412|CDR|Yes. Way over there.
1663415|LMP|Yes. Cochise is certainly a shallow crater, although we knew that. It doesn't have any - it only has one place I can see that has any blocks on the inner wall of Cochise. Otherwise, it has a surface much like what we're driving on for walls and for the floor. One place on the south - southeast wall there is a concentration of blocks much like we saw in Henry or in Horatio. But the rest of the crater seems to be pretty well mantled. Van Serg is a very blocky rim crater, big blocks up on the rim.
1663452|CDR|Do you have a lot of static, Jack, or is it just me?
1663454|LMP|No, I think it's just you. People are always giving you static.
1663502|CDR|Bob, if you still read me, I'm looking at the Sculptured Hills, and I still have that - that old man wrinkled face appearance, even up close at this Sun angle. And those wrinkles go from, generally, upslope at the west to downslope at the east.
1663521|LMP|Hey, are you - No, you're right at the edge of Cochise. Aren't you?
1663527|CDR|Where? Right here?
1663529|LMP|Yes. Aren't you?
1663529|CDR|No, we're not that close. Uh-uh. Cochise is up at - see that rim where those blocks are?
1663533|LMP|No, that's a small crater.
1663535|CDR|Oh, I'll bet you that's Cochise up there. We've got to go quite a ways yet to get to -
1663539|CC|How about a range and bearing there, guys?
1663540|CDR|This sideslope driving is really a tough - -
1663544|CC|How about a range and bearing?
1663545|CDR|Okay. It's 210/3.4.
1663548|CC|Copy that. 210/3.4. And you should be somewhat north of Cochise there, as per planning, although you may be cutting south to try going directly up-Sun.
1663603|CDR|I guess that's some other - That's Just a depression. I think Cochise is over that rim.
1663608|LMP|That's just a depression. Yes, yes. Those are getting warm.
1663614|CDR|Boy, I tell you that. Every bump you go over on that sideslope is just accentuated.
1663628|CC|Yes, we don't think you're anywhere near Cochise.
1663632|LMP|Yes. I agree.
1663634|CDR|Yes. I think it's over that rim up there.
1663636|LMP|That's just a big, shallow depression.
1663641|CDR|All I'm doing is flying the 3.4-kilometer arc right now.
1663649|CC|Say again there, Gene.
1663650|LMP|There's another one of those deep craters that's not - that doesn't have a blocky rim.
1663656|CDR|Okay. 214/3.4.
1663700|CC|Copy.
1663702|LMP|That's one of the more striking characteristics of the mantle are these craters that look, as far as the diameter-to-depth ratio is concerned, like they ought to be fairly young. But there's no blocks on the rim, and they seem to be - have this mantled appearance, just like some of the large craters.
1663726|CDR|As I look up Wessex Cleft from just about abeam of it - Let me get over here - it still shows me an albedo change and a surface wrinkle-texture change.
1663743|LMP|And - yes, I think so. I've got it at the same Sun angle more or less, or part of it there.
1663748|CC|Okay. Copy that. You guys may be getting just a little far north.
1663751|CDR|It's sort of a perfectly formed ...
1663751|LMP|Yes.
1663753|CC|You may want to head just a little south to avoid running right into the middle of SWP Crater.
1663759|LMP|Yes. I think we see it now. Is that SWP?
1663802|CDR|Well, I don't know. I don't -
1663804|CC|SWP will be at 22 - SWP will be at 225 and 3.4.
1663811|CDR|Yes. That's my - that's what I'm shooting for, Bob.
1663814|CC|Okay.
1663815|CDR|I'm just flying a 3.4 mile - or kilometer arc.
1663819|CC|Roger. I was going to suggest that.
1663821|LMP|Bob, there's something I haven't mentioned, but if one had time on the next program - -
1663831|CDR|I think that's SWP right there, Jack.
1663831|LMP|- - you can sample secondary craters, and they tend to have blocks either in them or on one rim, suggesting that you could tell directions if you put your mind to it. Directions of the - where the secondaries came from. These are small ones.
1663851|CDR|Did we ever get a piece of glass in place?
1663852|LMP|Yes, I did yesterday.
1663853|CDR|Documented in place?
1663854|LMP|Yes.
1663854|CDR|Okay.
1663855|LMP|That's what I was trying to protect in the SRC yesterday.
1663859|CDR|Here's SWP, Jack. It's coming right up, and I'll go along the southern rim.
1663905|LMP|I wish I wouldn't lose - start concentrating. I'm forgetting to take my pictures.
1663910|CC|Roger, Jack. Don't forget to take your pictures.
1663910|CDR|I'll tell you, if we don't concentrate, we end up -
1663915|LMP|Okay. I'll quit thinking and just take pictures.
1663924|LMP|There's a crater, that double pit-bottom crater. That's the first one of those I've seen.
1663928|CDR|Right here, Jack, you're going to be able to peek right over the top of SWP.
1663934|LMP|Right.
1663935|CDR|Right here. How's that grab you?
1663939|LMP|That's SWP, all right. SWP's a bigger hole than I thought it was.
1663949|LMP|Might - SWP even has some blocks in the wall.
1663954|CDR|Yes, but the eastern and southeastern rim of SWP are just continuous - Ooh - they're just continuous with the slopes of the Sculptured Hills.
1664006|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1664015|CDR|How does 238/4.2 sound for the beginning of 8?
1664019|LMP|Hey, you're -
1664023|CDR|I'm going to take these slopes just the most comfortable way we can.
1664027|CC|238 and 4.0 we're expecting for Station 8, the beginning of it. 238/4.2 - 4.0, excuse me; 4.0.
1664040|CDR|Roger.
1664043|CC|And remember again, Station 8 is a very flexible area. You just get to a place where it looks like it's feasible to sample Sculptured Hills.
1664053|LMP|That's right.
1664054|CDR|Yes.
1664102|CDR|Let me tell you, this Rover is a machine. I don't know if it saw that hill we're climbing, but I did.
1664127|LMP|How's your - how're you doing?
1664129|CDR|Doing fine. I'm trying to get around SWP over here and start hitting that -
1664135|LMP|East Massif has outcrops on it. I can see now on the north side. And they also tend to have linear to upper terminations. And some of those line up as if there's roughly horizontal structure within the upper one-half of the East Massif.
1664203|CC|Okay. Copy that, Jack. Stop thinking and take pictures.
1664212|LMP|Go by that little dark crater over there. There's a very blocky-rim small crater that's a dark-rim crater instead of a bright rim like we'd seen some around that looked fresh. It partly may be the angle at which we're approaching it.
1664216|PAO|The crew is about 20 minutes behind the timeline.
1664234|CDR|Bob, we're on the southeastern rim of SWP at 226 and 3.6.
1664241|LMP|Why don't we get some samples of that material in there.
1664242|CC|Copy that.
1664244|CDR|Right here.
1664246|LMP|Okay. Keep driving toward the rim and then just - a shallow curve. Okay. Now, curve it.
1664253|CDR|That your spot?
1664254|LMP|Okay. Right. Just keep going, and I'll stop you.
1664258|LMP|Whoa, straight in. Good, good.
1664302|CDR|Okay, Bob. 226/3.6. There's a - there's a highly fragmental, small crater about 40 - 30 or 40 meters across, right on the southeastern rim of SWP. And at - there's a - most of the fragments are football size and smaller, and they're very angular. And probably the inside of that rim is -
1664326|LMP|Turns out that they'll break. They're clods.
1664329|CDR|Are they clods?
1664329|LMP|Yes.
1664330|CDR|I guess that's going to be about 70 percent covered on the inside of the rim with these things.
1664334|LMP|It's all instant rock, but the crater rim looks dark compared to - to other fresh craters like this that we've seen.
1664347|CDR|50 Yankee.
1664349|CC|Copy. 50 Yankee.
1664350|LMP|And the frame count is 26. LMP frame is 26.
1664357|CC|Copy that. Press on.
1664400|LMP|Yes, you're - We are, we're rolling.
1664404|CC|And, 17, we're hoping to go to Station 8a - -
1664404|LMP|Yes. Your wheels are just chewing those things up.
1664407|CC|- - the northernmost section of Station 8, if we can, of course.
1664414|LMP|Yes. I think - I think we ought to head just about - -
1664418|CDR|Yes. We'll get there.
1664419|LMP|Well, the most - I think we ought to get below the highest peak up there because that seems to have the rocks on it.
1664427|LMP|I only see one rock so far - -
1664428|CDR|... straight ahead, in there. See that one. Of course, I don't know where that came down. Doesn't look like it may have came down from the top.
1664439|LMP|Certainly aren't many rocks. It's certainly not like the old North and South Massifs. Yes. There's one big rock over there. That doesn't look like it might be -
1664501|CDR|Well, let's head that way. That's about where the station is, anyway.
1664504|LMP|... I think we're starting to see blocks. That one is so - so unusual -
1664514|CDR|That's about the station. That's the northernmost station anyway. There's another one there.
1664520|LMP|Well, this probably is - We can get the other smaller population around it. I'm worried about that one being exotic to the Sculptured Hills.
1664528|CDR|Yes, it doesn't look like it rolled -
1664529|LMP|No.
1664529|CDR|But I don't see any others, do you?
1664531|LMP|Well, there's some small ones up in there. Off to about the 2 o'clock position. But I think that's all. We're going to have to be satisfied with small ones. Big ones don't get down. There's some big ones way up on the slope.
1664544|CDR|Yes, I see those.
1664549|LMP|Watch it; crater. You're ...
1664558|CDR|Yes, let me get it for them. Okay. We're at 227/3.9.
1664605|CC|Copy. 227/3.9.
1664611|CDR|I think it's worth - There's smaller ones around here, too, Jack.
1664617|LMP|Yes. That looks like subfloor from here.
1664622|CDR|What's it look like? If it doesn't look worthwhile stopping, I'll move on up over there.
1664625|LMP|Yes, it looks like subfloor. I would recommend that we - -
1664628|CDR|All right.
1664628|LMP|- - try to get up to some of those. I don't know whether we can or not. How's your - what's your pitch indicating?
1664635|CDR|Oh, that doesn't mean anything.
1664639|LMP|See that - those two up there would be reasonably well up the slope.
1664645|CDR|Bob, no parking constraints on the battery?
1664648|CC|Roger. No parking constraints. We'll park at 045, Gene. Or wherever you like, really.
1664656|CDR|I have to park about 045 because I've got to be pointing uphill so we can get out.
1664701|CC|Okay. Either - any place you want to. 045 is fine.
1664703|CDR|Jack, I'm going to park - -
1664706|LMP|How about just that rim of that little crater there?
1664709|CDR|Well, this is so level right here, Jack, I'm going to just park it -
1664711|LMP|Well, I was just thinking on top of that crater is closer to the - That's level, too, on the rim. It'll give them a view of the - a good view of the sampling area. I think we can - if we work on those blocks there and we're in pretty good shape.
1664727|LMP|Bob, we're directly downhill, and that is from the highest point that I could see up on this first mass - first Sculptured Hill.
1664739|CDR|Bob, I'm parked at 026; bearing is 226; distance, 6.6; range, 4.0; amp-hours, 85 and 80; battery is 1 - I think it's 115; and motors are all off scale low.
1664804|CC|Okay - -
1664804|CDR|Not really, but - Okay - -
1664808|CC|And here, we would like - -
1664809|CDR|- - 0 - 230 on the - on the forward and off scale low, and 220 on the right rear.
1664821|CC|Okay. We copy that. We'd like to get the usual dusting here. Up front.
1664828|CDR|Yes. And I'm fairly level.
1664831|LMP|Not really.
1664833|CDR|I'm not, huh?
1664833|LMP|(Laughter) I just about rolled downhill again.
1664838|CDR|Oh, man. (Laughter) I am pointing uphill, aren't I?
1664841|LMP|Yes.
1664843|CDR|Well, at least we don't have a sideslope.
1664847|CC|And, 17, we'd like - -
1664848|CDR|Battery covers stay closed?
1664849|CC|Battery covers stay closed. But we do want the LCRU, and the TV camera, and the TCU dusted.
1664908|CDR|Okay.
1664917|CC|And, 17, we'd like the SEP blankets opened and dusted one more time.
1664926|CDR|I think you're a dreamer, Bob, but I'll do it.
1664931|CC|Roger. We keep hoping.
1664945|CDR|Start doing your thing, Jack. It's going to take me a little while to get this dusted.
1664951|LMP|Bob, the first block I looked at here looks like subfloor gabbro.
1665001|CC|Okay. We copy that.
1665013|CDR|Should have it, Bob.
1665016|CC|Okay. We've got a picture.
1665021|CDR|You even sound better. Battery covers are awful dirty, but I will not dust them as long as you're happy.
1665033|CC|Yes. I don't think dusting the battery covers gives us any cooler batteries.
1665040|CDR|Well, I know; but it keeps the batteries from getting dust in them. I've had pretty good luck with them. They've been pretty clean.
1665047|CC|Roger on that,
1665107|CDR|You are dusted; and you're shiny bright, all over.
1665111|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1665115|CC|We thank you. Ed thanks you.
1665121|CDR|And we all thank you. Listen, if Ed thanks me, that's enough. A man couldn't ask for any more than that. Okay. I've got my ... - -
1665140|CC|I think your LMP just ran away.
1665146|CDR|Where'd he go? Jack?
1665147|LMP|What?
1665147|CDR|Oh, there you are. I thought maybe you fell in that crater I'm looking at. Okay. I'm going to give you a TGE reading.
1665149|CC|Roger. Give us a mark.
1665158|CDR|Our fender's beginning to fade and, uh-oh, the clip came off on the inside; that's what's wrong. We'll have to fix that before we start. The outside ones hold but the inside one's not.
1665210|LMP|Bob, all - all the blocks bigger than 20 centimeters that I've looked at up here are subfloor gabbro in appearance.
1665221|CC|Copy that.
1665223|LMP|I've looked at about five.
1665231|CC|Did we get a mark there on the gravimeter, Gene?
1665237|CDR|Thirty seconds to go, Bob.
1665239|CC|Roger. I copied it. Just wanted to check.
1665247|CDR|Okay. Jack. You find anything up there?
1665251|LMP|Gene, I'm going to go up and look at this one rock. Why don't you set up and sample any one of these other big ones. They're all the same. Like the one near the Rover. And I'll go up and try to get this big one down there.
1665307|CDR|Well, okay.
1665309|LMP|It's the only one left to look at, but right now we're dealing with subfloor material, I think.
1665314|CDR|What about some of these little fragments that seem to be sitting more on the surface?
1665317|LMP|Yes, we're supposed to rake here. We'll get those with the rake.
1665319|CDR|That one up there, by the way, is sitting on the surface. These others are submerged.
1665323|LMP|Yes. That's why I want to look at it.
1665326|CDR|If you - you won't - you don't have a hammer, but if you need me, I'll come up there because I think that may be worthwhile.
1665331|LMP|I'll roll it down to you.
1665333|CDR|Yes. Thanks a lot.
1665354|CC|A reminder, 17. We'd like to have you leaving here in 30 minutes to make up some of the time we spent at stations 6 and 7, a little extra. And we'd also remind you that we'd like a rake soil sample here, too. That may be the only way we try and pick up seme stuff other than subfloor if that, indeed, has come down from the top of the Sculptured Hills.
1665418|LMP|Okay, Bob. This rock is a big chunk of shattered, but still visible, bluish-gray anorthosite. It's glass-coated, and it actually looks like it's vesicular. I'm going to roll it downhill so we can work on it. Well, I'll document it first.
1665459|LMP|Did you copy that?
1665500|CC|Roger. I copy that. We'll be watching it coming.
1665505|LMP|Okay. But the point is, as Gene said, it's the only rock, big one anyway, in the area that I see that's perched on the surface as if it might have rolled here.
1665523|CC|Okay. Copy that, Jack.
1665533|LMP|But I don't see a track.
1665538|CDR|Man, this one here is tough as a -
1665542|LMP|Well, we can get some small ones.
1665543|CDR|Yes. That's what I'm going to do. I tell you, this one is so -
1665547|LMP|I thought you might be able to break it up.
1665549|CDR|Well, there's no - there's no corners on it.
1665624|LMP|You ready for this?
1665627|CC|We're ready.
1665629|CDR|Bob, 563 is the sample.
1665632|CC|Copy, 563.
1665633|CDR|Over here to the - ... -
1665636|LMP|Are you ready? Are you ready for this?
1665639|CDR|I'm not sure I am, but go ahead.
1665651|LMP|Go! roll! Look, I would roll on this slope, why don't you? Five-sixths gravity that's missing. Hey, I'll bet you they would like, if I didn't step on it, sample out of the bottom of that thing.
1665717|CDR|Yep.
1665732|CDR|These others all look - You're right, Jack, they look like what we've been sampling. And they're all pretty well mantled except the ones you got up there. There's one more piece I see on the side of that crater that may not be.
1665745|LMP|Bag 545 will be soil from under that anorthosite boulder. Bob, the only thing that bothers me about that boulder being subfloor - I mean Sculptured Hills - is that it's glass-coated.
1665815|CC|Copy that.
1665816|LMP|It may have been thrown in here by an impact. Oh, you're here.
1665826|CDR|Thought I'd sample it, and then roll it down.
1665828|LMP|Well, okay. I never would have moved it if I thought you were coming up.
1665831|CDR|Well, I wasn't coming up; but I looked at some of those others, and there's only one more -
1665835|LMP|Okay. Well, I got it documented up in place. Let's - That's not the - I think that's the side that was down. Let me roll it over -
1665843|CDR|Well, let me get a piece of that side since it was underneath. Then We'll roll it over and get a piece of the other side.
1665846|LMP|Good thinking. Oh, okay, yes. Let's do it again. Except I got dust all over it.
1665857|CDR|Well -
1665858|LMP|The albedo - the down-Sun picture's not going to mean much. Let me get this sample in your bag. I think we ought to change your bag because the stuff's going to start flying out.
1665913|CDR|Okay.
1665913|LMP|It won't stay closed.
1665914|CDR|Jack, after this one, there's only - there's one more in that crater. It may be from that crater, but I don't know.
1665922|LMP|How's your hand for hammering?
1665924|CDR|Ohhhh -
1665926|LMP|This will be easy. This will be easy.
1665927|CDR|The old hammering hand -
1665929|LMP|This will be an easy one, Gene.
1665942|CDR|Two pieces for you.
1665943|LMP|Okay. Let me - -
1665944|CDR|Oh, that's a pretty one inside!
1665946|LMP|Well, it's stained by the glass coating.
1665948|CDR|Oh.
1665949|LMP|It's stained by that glass coating.
1665951|CDR|That's a pretty one inside.
1665954|CDR|Can you get that? Here, take my hand.
1670002|LMP|Thank you.
1670003|CDR|While I'm at it, I'm going to chop another piece off right here.
1670006|LMP|Yes, get more than that.
1670011|CDR|Piece right there. You've got three pieces laying around. Let's get those before we lose them.
1670028|LMP|Bag 564. Maybe. I - Okay, I got it.
1670040|CDR|Have you already got them in the bag?
1670041|LMP|No.
1670043|CC|Copy. We copy; 564 from the bottom of the boulder.
1670051|CDR|Sure that's the bottom, huh?
1670053|LMP|Yes, it's got - mixed with local soil. I'm pretty sure. Let's turn it over. I think I'd recognize the top, although it's got dust all over it now.
1670106|CDR|I think I'll get one more swap off there. I don't want to seal this. Let me get another swap off there. I can get it.
1670111|LMP|Okay.
1670133|PAO|That's Gene Cernan hammering.
1670136|LMP|Well, that disappeared. Get it this way.
1670140|CDR|One time. That disappeared, too? That probably went into orbit.
1670154|LMP|Yes.
1670156|CDR|Boy, is that pretty inside. Whoo! We haven't seen anything like this. I haven't. Unless you've been holding out on me.
1670202|LMP|No, this is a nice crystalline rock.
1670206|CDR|Okay, I see that one.
1670206|LMP|Where did that one go?
1670207|CDR|That's a good one. I'll go get it with my tongs. That's a good one. That one I worked too hard to get. Hey, I see how it makes boulder tracks. I just made one - it just - it just skipped along, made those little pothole craters as it went.
1670230|LMP|Hey, Houston. This is a - about a 50-50 mixture of - what looks like maskelynite or at least blue-gray plagioclase, and a very - let's say yel - light yellow-tan mineral, probably orthopyroxene. It's fairly coarsely crystalline.
1670258|CC|Copy that. Okay. When you guys get done with that rock, we'd like to get to the rake sample, please. And that's probably just as well done by the Rover as anyplace else. We don't seem to see anything worthwhile here doing besides that.
1670320|CDR|Did you get it?
1670320|LMP|Yes.
1670330|CDR|Okay. That went in the same bag, Bob, as the other - rest of the chips from the bottom. All the chips from the bottom are in 464.
1670338|CC|Copy.
1670346|LMP|Here, let me roll it over. Go ahead. Want to put it in?
1670348|CDR|Yes.
1670349|LMP|Okay.
1670356|CDR|Oh, boy.
1670400|LMP|By coarsely crystalline, it's - probably, the average grain size will turn out to be about 3 or 4 millimeters, maybe - maybe half a centimeter. Hold this, and I'll - -
1670409|CDR|Well, I got to go get a couple of pictures.
1670413|LMP|Yes. Yes, we really got that one messed up.
1670415|CDR|Yes, I -
1670416|LMP|That's all right.
1670417|CDR|If you'd hold your scoop where that one came off, it'd help.
1670420|LMP|Yes, I was just going over there.
1670421|CDR|On that other side.
1670423|LMP|Just going over there.
1670423|CDR|This side is clear. That last one I took off. Okay.
1670428|LMP|Right there.
1670430|CDR|Okay, that's good. Let's move the gnomon, and we won't roll it over on the gnomon.
1670447|LMP|Watch it. Watch it. Oh, yes. That other side is the one that was up. Well, I'm not sure now. It's got so much dust on it. But let's -
1670519|CDR|It's not going to roll down that hill unless we got it on edge.
1670522|LMP|No. Did it come up here?
1670528|CDR|Oh, look at that glass on it. That's what you said, huh?
1670531|LMP|Yes.
1670532|CDR|Well, which side was the glass on when you looked at it?
1670534|LMP|It's on all sides. It's on all sides.
1670536|CC|17, there's probably not much point in spending a lot of time out here trying to decide which is the top. It's not big enough, anyway, really to worry about - -
1670544|CDR|We're not.
1670544|CC|- - the top and bottom samples. They're radiologically significant.
1670550|LMP|Well, let's - If you don't want another sample, then we can go ahead.
1670553|CDR|Well, let me get a piece of this glass.
1670557|LMP|Righto.
1670611|LMP|There it is. Okay. Let me try to get them. Put them in here.
1670630|CDR|Okay; a piece of the glass from it, Bob, is 546.
1670633|CC|Okay. We copy 546.
1670633|CDR|With a little of the local soil.
1670641|CC|And now we're ready for you guys to rake - -
1670642|CDR|Okay. We'll rake.
1670643|CC|- - and I guess they suggest the crater rim if possible. Probably over there near the Rover.
1670651|LMP|Okay. Now you got a sample of that big block down there, huh?
1670658|CDR|Yes.
1670658|LMP|Okay. Don't forget your gnomon. Whoo! Oh, boy.
1670710|CDR|Bob, on my frame count; 85.
1670715|CC|Copy, 85 for the commander.
1670722|LMP|Too bad I don't have my skiis.
1670724|CDR|Jack, did you get a pan up here?
1670726|LMP|No.
1670727|CDR|I'll get one.
1670727|LMP|Good, I forgot. I got interested in skiing, Whoo! Can't keep my edges. Little hard to get a good hip rotation.
1670759|CDR|Let's see, I must be looking back at - well, there's SWP. Golly, I don't know. I'm looking back at the complex, Cochise and Shakespeare, and I can see the LM.
1670837|CDR|Hey, Bob. One interesting thing up here, you can see the erosional pattern of the talus, the mantle that - I call it a mantle, but the talus that's on the Sculptured Hills, there's little - little boulder tracks of all sizes from all these little clods. And they all, of course, point downhill or nearly downhill.
1670902|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1670907|LMP|Hey, Bob. In the interest of time, I'll document this without the gnomon.
1670914|CC|Okay. I presume Gene's got the gnomon up there.
1670918|LMP|Yes. I should have brought it, but - -
1670920|CC|Okay. Don't forget the gnomon, Gene.
1670920|LMP|- - I didn't think about it.
1670924|CC|And we concur - -
1670925|LMP|Don't forget the Gene, gnomon!
1670925|CC|- - with documenting without the gnomon.
1670932|CDR|Whee! Boy, when you do this, and you go downslope, that first step is a long one.
1670942|CDR|I'm having - This is the best way for me to travel. Uphill or downhill.
1670952|LMP|What's that?
1670953|CDR|Like this. Two-legged hop.
1670956|LMP|There seems - Yes.
1670957|CDR|And on level ground, I can skip. I don't like that loping thing.
1671002|LMP|Oh, the loping's the only way to go.
1671004|CDR|Well, when I'm on level ground, I can skip. But this two-legged thing is great. Man, I can cover ground like a kangaroo. Oh, okay. You documented already; I was just going to put this in the field of view anyway.
1671027|LMP|Yes. Here on the after ... right out there.
1671057|CDR|Well, what do you think about that? There's not much in here worth - Man, there's just nothing - Either this has been totally mantled with talus. Well, it is, because that - that downhill pattern goes right down the slope of this crater, and, actually, it goes upslope of the crater. This may be on a ray somewhere. Because it goes right downhill - this little bitty boulder trail pattern goes right up the slope.
1671136|LMP|I think those are later than the crater by a long ways.
1671139|CDR|Did you - did you sample anything over here?
1671142|LMP|No, I haven't done anything - -
1671143|CDR|I'm going to pick up the piece out of that little - -
1671145|LMP|Yes, get this - -
1671146|CDR|- - crater.
1671147|LMP|Want your gnomon over there?
1671149|CDR|No. I'll just take it to it. Let me know when you're ready for a bag.
1671157|LMP|Well, I'm about ready.
1671207|CDR|You about ready?
1671208|LMP|Yes.
1671208|CDR|Okay.
1671219|LMP|I went - I raked about a 2-meter square area - maybe - yes, about 2 meters, and down to 4 or 5 centimeters for these. Pretty good population. They all going to go in?
1671238|CDR|They're all in; 5 - -
1671239|LMP|Wait, wait.
1671239|CDR|- - 5 - 565.
1671241|CC|Okay. Copy that - -
1671242|CDR|565.
1671242|CC|Sounds great. Sounds like a good rake sample for a change.
1671248|CDR|Yes, sir.
1671250|CC|And this is a kilogram soil locations, fellas.
1671254|LMP|Yes, sir.
1671256|CDR|Jack, your bag is full; we're going to have - No, it isn't, but we ought to change it when we get back there anyway. And that one ought to go under your seat.
1671304|LMP|Oh, okay.
1671305|CDR|Get your kilogram. I'll be ready to take it.
1671318|CDR|The kilogram is in 566.
1671321|CC|Copy that. And, remaining here, we'd have primarily a trench. If you fellows think it's feasible, we'd like to be moving in 1 - 1 minutes, 11 minutes. And we could use a pan from this lower location also, probably.
1671341|CDR|Why don't you go back and dig a trench at the Rover?
1671343|CC|Roger. That sounds good to us.
1671346|CDR|Okay.
1671347|CC|And we also remind you of getting - -
1671348|CDR|Once you get a trench at the Rover - -
1671350|CC|- - a pan at the lower section there.
1671350|CDR|- - we just scoop this out. I'll get the sample here that I got documented now and - -
1671358|LMP|Did you? - is that - is that all going to go in there?
1671401|CDR|Yes, it'll go.
1671401|LMP|Can you twist it?
1671402|CDR|Yes.
1671404|LMP|That ... rock may have been too much. Take that rock out, and - -
1671409|CDR|No, it'll stay. We're going to have to put it in mine, though. Well, let me try. Since we're going to unload your bag, this may be the last - the last one. That's the last one for your bag.
1671425|LMP|Okay.
1671427|CDR|Okay.
1671429|LMP|Did you get anything out of that little crater?
1671430|CDR|No. But I'm going to right now.
1671432|LMP|Okay.
1671432|CDR|Why don't you get your after picture over there and go down and get that trench. I'll come down -
1671437|LMP|You don't want a bag? Okay.
1671438|CDR|I can - I can back it - I can do it -
1671441|LMP|...
1671507|CDR|Boy, almost pure white and very friable. Oh, boy, is it. Pure white. Right out of a small little pit crater on the side of this crater I just walked in, Houston. And it's pure white, very friable. I got about - well, one big piece and several small in 567.
1671533|CC|Copy that.
1671540|LMP|Bob, the walls of these craters, the big craters around here, that is, the ones that are, say, 15 meters in diameter, tend to be a little bit lighter albedo than ones down in the mantled area. I'm afraid those pictures on that rake may be a little bit made - be through a - a dust-colored lens.
1671616|CDR|Yes, they were also in my documented sample here, too.
1671635|CDR|Okay. Where do you want this trench? On the side of this crater?
1671638|LMP|Well, - -
1671639|CDR|I'll drop my gnomon.
1671639|LMP|- - I don't know. I don't - I was just thinking about that. I think - I think we - we - we ought to get out in the inner crater area to see if there's any stratigraphy to the - to - to whatever the talus is.
1671658|CDR|Okay, Jack. I'm going to leave the gnomon right here.
1671705|LMP|I'll get it.
1671707|CDR|And, while you're digging that trench, we've got to pan to get, but I want to fix this fender.
1671711|LMP|I guess this - The pan's mine, isn't it, this one?
1671712|CDR|Yes, it is. And I want to fix the fender before - -
1671715|LMP|Okay.
1671716|CDR|- - before we leave. ... - -
1671717|CC|Okay. We agree with that, and you might get us a - -
1671718|CDR|- - ... one, and I'll tighten - -
1671720|CC|- - you might get us the gravimeter reading there, Gene, while you're at it. And if you have time, you might drop the gravimeter on the ground, and we'll get a reading with it on the ground as well.
1671734|CDR|Holy Smoley.
1671735|LMP|Gravimeter is coming up.
1671737|CDR|670, 096, 001 - 670, 096, 001.
1671747|CC|Copy that.
1671752|CDR|You want it dropped on the ground, huh?
1671753|CC|Gently.
1671757|CDR|Gently. I can't find a gentle level spot, but I'll level it. If it takes pictures - or does it's thing on the Rover, it'll do its thing here.
1671815|CC|Yes, this is just to get a check - -
1671816|CDR|Okay.
1671817|CDR|MARK. ...
1671818|CC|Copy that.
1671833|CDR|It's fender-fixing time, it's camera-taking-off time. And I think I'll zap myself with a little cool water.
1671845|CC|And how's the trench going, Jack?
1671851|LMP|Oh, down.
1671859|CDR|Oh, man, I tell you. When you call for cold water, does it come in nicely. Whew! I'm really happy with this fender, really happy with it.
1671927|LMP|Bob, I have dug - have gotten a wall, now in one place that's standing about 25 centimeters high. And it shows no apparent change in the texture of the soil to that depth; except possibly at the lower 5 centimeters, there's some zones that might be slightly more granular. Particle size may be up a little bit.
1672006|CC|Okay. I copy that. Probably just three samples then will be sufficient, then.
1672012|LMP|I think - I think so. Maybe four.
1672018|CDR|Be there in a minute, Jack.
1672020|LMP|Oh, that's all right. I can probably get started.
1672034|CDR|Oh, oh, oh, boy.
1672035|LMP|Need some help?
1672037|CDR|No. Boy, we're sure giving this suspension system a workout. Whew! I can even see it. Well, everything's getting awful dusty. Boy, everything is stiff. Everything is just full of dust. There's got to be a point where the dust just overtakes you, and everything mechanical quits moving.
1672126|LMP|Like scoops.
1672132|CDR|I'm not sure whether Detroit would like the fender, but it will sure buy the fix. Okay, it's fixed.
1672141|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1672142|CDR|And I'm happy; I like it.
1672144|CC|Roger. We copy that. And copy it again. And we'd like to have you guys moving in about 3 minutes.
1672156|LMP|Good luck.
1672158|CDR|You need any help you get - bag those samples, huh?
1672200|LMP|Yes, sir. I think I do. I can't adjust my scoop to my belt-bagging method.
1672206|CDR|Let me get back on some lighter cooling here to - to save some water. Okay, now.
1672214|LMP|Okay - the bottom 10 centimeters - -
1672217|CDR|Let me get your bags - I left my camera off when I -
1672219|LMP|- - of a - Well, shoot! I didn't take a picture of the trench after I dug it. Let me take one - one shot.
1672230|CDR|What's this, the bottom?
1672232|LMP|That's the bottom.
1672233|CDR|Okay. The bottom is in 548. It's very cloddy. Looks very much like the surface we're standing on except it clods up quite a bit more. Can you tell them anything from the trench itself?
1672247|LMP|I told them - I talked to them a little bit about it.
1672248|CDR|Okay.
1672249|LMP|It looked a little more - a little coarser grained, but that's all.
1672254|PAO|EVA time, 3 hours 50 minutes.
1672301|CDR|Okay. It sure holds a nice wall, though.
1672303|LMP|Yes.
1672305|CDR|That's the kind of wall I expect those core tubes held.
1672309|LMP|You got another one?
1672311|CDR|Okay. Skim of the upper - We'll see - how well I do - skim sample of the upper - half centimeter. Maybe a centimeter deep.
1672335|LMP|Okay. Can you hold this?
1672337|CDR|I'm going to put it in your bag.
1672339|LMP|Is it going to fit in there?
1672340|CDR|Well, there's no choice, right now. Let me see if these little ones will fit in there. Stand by. I want to put this one in there, too.
1672348|CDR|That's in bag 549.
1672351|CC|Copy that.
1672406|CDR|Okay. Let's try again. Okay. The upper - Below that skim, the next 5 centimeters.
1672427|LMP|Put it down, Geno.
1672428|CDR|... put over.
1672430|LMP|Well, I can't turn it.
1672436|CDR|550.
1672439|CC|Copy that.
1672442|CDR|And the next 10 centimeters down -
1672448|LMP|Can you get this one too?
1672449|CDR|Yes. Now, I got to get your bag.
1672500|LMP|Okay.
1672501|CDR|Okay. That was the next 10 centimeters, and then the first sample, of course, was the 10 centimeters below that.
1672508|CC|Roger. Copy that.
1672509|CDR|And that last bag was 551.
1672511|CC|Okay. Copy that. We're ready for you guys to move out.
1672518|LMP|Okay.
1672520|CDR|You didn't get a pan here - while I clean up the Rover, you can get a - get your after of the trench in the pan.
1672526|LMP|I will.
1672527|CDR|I'll get the TG and clean up the Rover.
1672530|CC|That's affirm. We agree with that.
1672532|LMP|What's the key that keeps - I keep getting keyed.
1672536|CDR|It sounds like Bob's stepping on his foot mike.
1672538|LMP|Yes, he's so excited - -
1672540|CDR|Okay - -
1672540|LMP|- - he can't stand it.
1672541|CDR|- - You done with the gnomon?
1672542|LMP|Yes. Okay. I'll get the pan.
1672546|CDR|You get your pan, and I'll get the TG and clean up.
1672548|LMP|You took a pan up the hill there?
1672550|CDR|Yes. I took it way up there, somewhere.
1672551|LMP|Okay. I'll take it right here, then. Uh oh.
1672601|CDR|What?
1672602|LMP|Sample came out.
1672604|CDR|A sample came out?
1672605|LMP|I'll pick it up.
1672606|CDR|Yes, your - your top came open. It's awful full, Jack. If you can't get it, I'll get it with the tongs.
1672611|LMP|Go ahead and go to work, and I'll get the pan first. I lost two of them, I guess.
1672618|CDR|Yes, those are the last two I put in there. They just - your bag is so full they won't stay. Let me give them a reading here. Hey, Bob, can I move it on the Rover and then give you a reading?
1672627|CC|Yes. As long as you're careful not to hit the button while you're doing it.
1672633|CDR|I won't hit the button. Just easier to do it that way. I don't know why I asked you; I know I can.
1672647|CDR|Even this thing doesn't want to go on; it's so dusty. Okay. It's on and it's locked. And here's your reading. 670 - 670, 117, 301 - that's 670, 117, 301.
1672710|CC|Okay. We copy that.
1672712|CDR|I've got to dust that thing the next time around. Jack, we've got to do some bag changing here.
1672720|LMP|Yes.
1672722|CDR|I'll get those things with my tongs. You can't get them - You'd have to bend over. Every time you jump around, you come close to losing something. I'll just take them back there and put them under the seat.
1672748|LMP|Okay. You want me to take that one?
1672753|CDR|No, I got it.
1672754|LMP|Okay.
1672810|LMP|Damn.
1672811|CC|You got another one dropped there, Gene - Jack got it.
1672816|CDR|Another one?
1672817|CC|Jack's getting it.
1672818|CDR|Okay. Jack, we've got to make a place in here for your - that full bag. Let me put this small can over there, and core tube over there.
1672833|LMP|Have a sample.
1672839|CDR|Okay. Let me take your bag off first.
1672843|LMP|Okay. Well, you might as well fill it as full as you can.
1672845|CDR|Yes, I am. Holy Smoley.
1672849|LMP|(Laughter) Turn - turn to the left.
1672857|CDR|Okay. It's off. Let me fill it.
1672911|LMP|Your bag isn't in much better shape.
1672912|CC|Roger. We'd like to have you check the commander's bag. You might put them both under the seat there.
1672921|LMP|Well, we're running out of bags, aren't we?
1672923|CC|Okay. We've got one bag left - we should have there. It was on the gate, right?
1672932|LMP|Okay. Yes. We - we could have put it under the seat.
1672936|CDR|Okay, bag number 4 - bag number 4 is - is absolutely full - and it's under Jack's seat.
1672949|CC|Okay. I suggest that you take the other bag that's on the gate there, and put that on either you or Jack. And also, the commander's bag is pretty full also, we suspect.
1673000|LMP|Why don't you put it on me? Mine gets full faster, somehow.
1673005|CC|You might - you might check Gene's bag anyway.
1673007|CDR|Stay there. Stay there, stay there. I'm trying to get the bottom off.
1673011|LMP|Oh, I'm sorry. I checked it. He's got about six samples to go.
1673018|CC|Okay. And - -
1673019|LMP|And I just want to be sure that it's locked down.
1673025|CDR|Okay. Well, turn to the left so I can get this other hook.
1673033|LMP|Okay.
1673035|CDR|That's not coming out; I guarantee you that. Now ... take your - -
1673036|CC|Okay. And SCB 5 is one for the LMP if you want to take it off the gate.
1673043|CDR|I got it.
1673043|LMP|SCB-5 is on the LMP.
1673045|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1673046|LMP|There is nothing on the gate.
1673051|LMP|Well, I think, that'll stay down, but it's not very good - -
1673054|CDR|Okay. I've got one more loose sample I'm going to throw in the big bag back there.
1673058|LMP|A local one, you mean?
1673100|CDR|Yes.
1673101|LMP|Well - -
1673102|CDR|Well, let me leave it under your seat.
1673103|LMP|Now, let's - Can I put a "bag a round it?
1673105|CDR|No, it's got a bag around it - it's all bagged.
1673108|CC|Okay. Jack, while Gene's doing that, why don't you read the SEP temperature, or somebody read the SEP temperature anyway, and close the blankets.
1673117|LMP|Okay. I'll do that.
1673123|CDR|Okay, Bob. Let's see, you got your readings - -
1673128|LMP|120, Bob, 120.
1673131|CC|Copy. 120.
1673135|LMP|Those blankets just aren't staying closed.
1673142|CDR|Okay. I guess we're ready to head on out. Do you agree?
1673146|CC|Okay. And, Gene, when you go to change the - when you go to change the LCRU, we'd like you to turn it to OFF - O-F-F, on the POWER switch, the INTERNAL POWER EXTERNAL switch. And we'll be reading you through the LM. It will give you a chance to cool down the LCRU on the way home to Station 9.
1673207|CDR|All right.
1673209|LMP|And, Houston, what's the temperature limit on the DSEA?
1673218|CC|Stand by, Jack.
1673228|CDR|Do you read us, Bob, through the LM?
1673230|CC|Roger. We read you through the LM. Do read us through the LM?
1673235|CDR|Yes. Not as well, but we're reading you.
1673237|CC|Okay. And the temperature limit, Jack, is 160. We'll just leave it as is until we get back to the LM.
1673245|LMP|Okay. I was going to say, we could take it out and put it under the seat or something, but that sounds all right.
1673250|CDR|Okay. An EMU status check. I'm at 3.88, and I got 48 percent, no flags, and I'm INTERMEDIATE cooling.
1673304|CC|Copy that.
1673305|LMP|And the LMP - is at 47 percent, no flags, 3.86. Hey, Gene?
1673318|CDR|Yes.
1673319|LMP|What - Well, Bob, I guess - remind us to change the LRV sampler at the next station. It's almost out of bags.
1673326|CC|Okay.
1673326|CDR|Well, let's do it next time around.
1673328|CC|Okay. When you get on, Jack, you can give me a frame count as you start moving.
1673334|LMP|Yes. Hang on. Need some help?
1673344|CDR|Nope.
1673346|LMP|Go downhill. Get your feet downhill.
1673348|CDR|Yep.
1673355|LMP|Okay. Let me help you.
1673357|CDR|(Laughter)
1673401|LMP|Now watch it, there's a crater right behind you.
1673403|CDR|I got it. I got it.
1673409|LMP|Here, here. Grab my hand.
1673413|CDR|Okay, now, just push up on my head.
1673416|LMP|Okay. I'm not going to do it too hard. Going backwards.
1673421|CDR|All right; just push up.
1673424|LMP|Okay.
1673425|CDR|Okay.
1673426|LMP|Boy, are you - you got your pockets completely filled with dirt.
1673430|CDR|Well, extra samples.
1673431|LMP|Do we throw those pockets away this time around?
1673432|CDR|Extra sample.
1673436|LMP|Are you a mess!
1673437|CDR|Well, that one was coming for a long time.
1673441|LMP|My hand's are already tired from dusting you.
1673444|CDR|That one was coming. I keep trying to blow the dust off my camera, which is very frustrating.
1673449|LMP|Very ineffective, too.
1673457|CDR|Okay. Do we try that trick again? You know that happened on that upslope getting on the Rover. Okay. I'm all locked in. Let me know when you are.
1673523|LMP|How come we aren't deploying any charges? I guess the last one - I remember when that one is.
1673527|CDR|Okay.
1673528|CC|We'll deploy one at Station 10.
1673533|CDR|Okay. We're heading to Station 9 pointed about 267. Okay, and they're reading us through the LM, so I won't worry about the low gain. We're powering up. The switch is on. Okay, I'm going to make a turn to the right.
1673551|CC|Okay. And the updated headings, since you're at the north end of Station 8 will be something like about 240.
1673603|CDR|Okay, Bob. 240.
1673607|LMP|Bob, I think your rake sample here at the Sculptured Hills is going to have to tell a tale combined with the observation that most of the blocks we saw were, like Gene sampled, looked like subfloor gabbro. It's conceivable that the Sculptured Hills could be the same kind of material. I think it's fairly clear that the boulder population does not resemble the massif population at all.
1673644|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1673651|LMP|(Laughter)
1673652|CDR|You been riding on this downslope all the time?
1673654|LMP|(Laughter) Yes, but - -
1673655|CDR|And you hadn't said anything, huh?
1673656|LMP|Scary, isn't it?
1673658|CDR|Man, I'm glad I'm driving.
1673702|CC|Okay, and Jack -
1673704|LMP|(Laughter)
1673704|CC|- when you're don't - holding on with two hands, we'd like the frame count from you.
1673707|LMP|Wait a minute. Yes. Is that Van Serg over there?
1673713|CDR|Ahhhh -
1673716|CC|You have a bearing of 234 - -
1673718|CDR|I think it's -
1673719|CC|- - and a range of 2.1.
1673719|LMP|I don't know - no - it's - Okay.
1673727|CDR|We got to get around SWP here and then - -
1673731|LMP|Well, let's - yes.
1673732|CDR|- - and then head on more westerly.
1673735|LMP|LMP frame is at 80.
1673737|CC|Copy 80.
1673741|CDR|SWP or Bowen, I mean - Bowen, I guess it is.
1673744|LMP|Well, yes.
1673750|LMP|That's SWP over there. Bowen is out here ahead of us.
1673752|CDR|Yes. If he said two - -
1673756|LMP|Bowen - Bowen isn't much of a crater on the map.
1673759|CDR|- - 225 - What did you say, Bob? 225 what?
1673802|CC|234/2.1 - -
1673804|LMP|234 - -
1673804|CC|Heading ought to be about 240; 240 for a heading for there.
1673811|CDR|Did you hear him? I didn't hear him.
1673813|LMP|240. Are you not reading him?
1673815|CDR|But what did he say for bearing and range? That's what I'm interested in.
1673817|CC|234 - -
1673819|LMP|240. State bearing and range, Bob.
1673819|CC|- - 2.1.
1673824|CDR|Okay. I got that.
1673832|PAO|Station 9 is 2.3 kilometers from Station 8 and we estimate driving time 18 minutes.
1673844|CC|Okay. And we think you're even farther north than I was saying. Maybe it's about 215 would be your heading for there.
1673855|CDR|Okay, Bob. I'll find it. 234/2.1.
1673858|CC|Roger.
1673902|LMP|And all the big blocks still look like subfloor from the Rover. But big blocks in here are only about a - a third of a meter in diameter. And they're subrounded to subangular. Okay. We're up on the plains again now, just off the break of slope.
1673934|PAO|Station 9 is Van Serg crater which could be of volcanic origin.
1673949|CDR|That sure looks - looks like outcrop back there on the East Massif on the lower slopes, if it's here the high albedo is. Doesn't it? See it over there?
1673956|LMP|Yes - Yes. Yes. It does - it was one of my guidelines for the geophone deployment - guide points.
1674015|LMP|There's some more of the blue-gray rock here in the east end of the South Massif down low.
1674022|CDR|Yes.
1674023|LMP|It looks like it might have been a slump block or something.
1674024|CDR|Yes. You can see it's blue-gray because of its contrast with the light mantle.
1674027|LMP|Yes. It might be a slump block, or something - like that.
1674031|CDR|Oh, Jack, I'm going to go to the left.
1674033|LMP|You going to go soon? (Laughter) Need 234 - -
1674037|CDR|No, No. I'm going over here. This is closer. That's a shorter cut.
1674041|LMP|Okay, that - that's probably Bowen there, don't you think?
1674044|CDR|I think - -
1674045|LMP|Oh, well - -
1674046|CDR|Well, see, we never got too far - -
1674048|CC|How about a - how about a range and bearing, guys.
1674049|LMP|... aren't very far from SWP.
1674050|CDR|Maybe we got too far east. Okay. It's 228,3.4. And we're moving along at 10 to 12 clicks. That's all it'll hack.
1674103|CC|Copy that. How about an amps reading? We haven't had one of those for a couple of ...
1674109|LMP|Starting to rain again. Got a crater ahead of you.
1674115|CDR|Oooh, boy.
1674119|LMP|Down-Sun isn't much easier than up-Sun.
1674121|CDR|It's just easier on the eyes. You just can't see any more, that's all. You don't have that static, huh?
1674132|LMP|Nope. Hope you've still got an antenna; I haven't looked recently.
1674143|CDR|Hope there's no holes in the high gain.
1674146|LMP|Might have hit it on a rock.
1674150|CDR|Oh, boy.
1674151|LMP|Okay. The - we're back into the mantled area population of fragments is still 1 percent or so. The crater off to our left, which is at 227 and 3. - What is that?
1674209|LMP|3 point what? 3?
1674211|CDR|3.3; 227/3.3.
1674214|LMP|And a fairly good-sized depression, but it's completely mantled. There's no blocks showing in the wall at all. How do you read, Bob?
1674231|CC|Loud and clear. We're listening.
1674239|LMP|Now there's that crater in the wall of that depression or a hollow near it. And it has one big block in the side as if it penetrated the mantle and exposed some of the wall of the depression. Just about a 30-meter crater. Valley of Taurus-Littrow is not planar.
1674311|CDR|No, it isn't.
1674314|LMP|I'm glad we changed it to a subfloor instead of a plains unit.
1674320|LMP|(Laughter)
1674322|LMP|Okay. We're in the inner wall of the depression here, and the rocks still look like subfloor gabbro. Boy, there's certainly not much variety.
1674333|LMP|Okay. Generally, there are few exotics.
1674335|CDR|Ooh, now that's got to be Cochise.
1674336|LMP|Ah, look at Cochise.
1674338|CDR|That's Cochise.
1674339|CC|Roger. We think you're coming up on Cochise.
1674340|CDR|Get your self a couple pictures while you're looking right at it.
1674342|LMP|Could you swing right? Swing right.
1674345|CDR|Bob, we are on the south - or northeastern rim of Cochise. I'm going to work my way around the other side.
1674352|CC|Roger. Copy that.
1674352|LMP|And Bob, looking at the western wall of Cochise, I can see a contact within the subfloor between a - albedo units, one of which is a light tan-gray and the other is a light blue-gray. May reflect the two kinds of subfloor gabbro we've already sampled. Vesicular and nonvesicular. And that contact that looked like it was dipping - apparent dip in the wall - was to the north. And the west wall dipping to the north about 20 degrees.
1674438|CC|Okay. Copy that. What - which one's on top? Can you tell?
1674451|LMP|Yes. The blue-gray's on top. I'm sorry.
1674453|CC|Thank you. And you got a bearing and range there at the rim of Cochise?
1674455|LMP|I took a picture of it and -
1674459|CDR|Okay. We're at 228/3.0, and we're not - we're headed south and not quite on the - on the east rim.
1674508|CC|All right.
1674512|CDR|I'll give you a hack at the east rim.
1674519|LMP|Bob, I got a - a picture of that contact so, I was -
1674525|CDR|I took some pictures right into Cochise, too, when we were coming up.
1674528|LMP|Good. It'll show on yours, too, probably - I hope.
1674536|CDR|Okay. We're sort of on the inner -
1674539|LMP|Quick; give them a mark.
1674540|CDR|MARK, 230/2.9. We're on the east rim.
1674544|CC|Copy that.
1674545|LMP|Well, we're sort of inside the east rim a little bit.
1674547|CC|Well, don't get too far inside.
1674549|LMP|We're halfway between the rim and where the blocky wall starts.
1674555|CC|All right. Copy that.
1674556|LMP|Did you get that, Bob?
1674557|CC|Yes. We got that.
1674608|LMP|Cochise is much like Horatio and - actually, more like Camelot, although not as blocky in the walls, in general, in that it - it has blocky walls but a mantled rim. Again, all the blocks I see in here are big ones. And blocks down to about 20 centimeters are subangular, in general, and appear to be the - have the appearance of the subfloor gabbro, although most of the smaller rocks are not - do not appear to be highly vesicular.
1674653|CC|All right. We're copying that all.
1674707|CDR|We're at 232 and 2.7.
1674713|CC|Roger. Copy that.
1674726|LMP|Watch it.
1674732|CDR|You know why - what happened there?
1674734|LMP|What?
1674734|CDR|I was just about to take a picture, and the minute you take your eye off anything -
1674737|LMP|Yes.
1674743|LMP|Yes. I got another view of that contact, and let's put that - let's put that on the northwest wall of Cochise and dipping to the southeast. Is that right?
1674759|CDR|South and east is to our left.
1674801|LMP|No, no, no, no, no. Put it on the northwest wall dipping to the northeast.
1674811|LMP|Yes, that's right. See that, Geno, can you see that over there?
1674819|CDR|Oh, yes. I can see it now between the gray and blue-gray?
1674821|LMP|Yes.
1674822|CDR|Oh, yes. Yes, I sure do.
1674826|LMP|Can you swing in there, and let me get another shot of it?
1674828|CDR|You betcha.
1674837|LMP|Oh, this is a good view right here. Okay now, I need to have you go left.
1674844|CDR|Okay. I got two of them in there, too.
1674845|LMP|Great.
1674846|CDR|Look at that rock right in front of us. It looks like a contact between a blue and a gray.
1674850|LMP|Oh, yes, there it is. Yes, you're right.
1674852|CDR|We can't get down to it, but take a picture.
1674854|LMP|Well, I think we've done - I think we've got that relationship. I think we got it at Station 1, as a matter of fact.
1674859|CDR|But that's a big beautiful boulder on the - -
1674900|LMP|Yes, that's - -
1674901|CDR|Inner rim - -
1674902|LMP|- - that's ... a block.
1674902|CDR|- - inner south rim of Cochise.
1674904|LMP|Oooh - -
1674904|CDR|It's a single block.
1674905|LMP|That's how you bend your tires.
1674907|CDR|Well, that's what it's for. Oh, that's a - Oh, man, would that be ... - -
1674911|LMP|Well, now, that might be glass covered. That might be a glass coating; the way it sort of hangs on the outside there. Hard to say.
1674921|CDR|We're at 234/2.5.
1674928|LMP|Starting to sling dust. I wonder if we've lost our fender.
1674930|CC|Roger. Copy that.
1674930|CDR|No, they're on there tight. ... - -
1674931|LMP|You think that's Van Serg? Right over there.
1674935|CDR|No.
1674935|LMP|There it is. Bet you.
1674938|CDR|Yes. I think you're right, because that's just about the right place. Let's see, 234 - okay, is where - and 2.1 is where we want to go, and I'm at 230/2.5.
1674947|LMP|Okay, our - -
1674948|CDR|Pretty close.
1674949|LMP|- - Our block population in here now, on the south rim of Cochise and it's - and up ahead of us looks like it's up to 5 percent. And it's - all looks like subfloor - light to tan subfloor gabbro - or tan-gray. You don't see much blue-gray; not out on here.
1675022|LMP|There's a recent hit.
1675026|CDR|This Rover is getting tested for what it was built for now.
1675029|LMP|Yes.
1675037|CDR|I tell you it handles just the way as advertised, maybe even better.
1675044|CC|Okay. We think you guys are getting to the point we ought to swing a little bit west to make that 232/2.1.
1675051|CDR|Yes, I am, Bob.
1675056|LMP|I think we - We've got it. Tallyho.
1675056|CDR|Bob - Bob. That's my fix. I'm just navigating to it.
1675100|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1675101|CDR|I know where. I'll get there.
1675104|CC|Roger.
1675104|LMP|We have a Tallyho on Shorty - I mean of Van Serg. How about through there, Geno. Thanks.
1675113|CC|Let's not prejudge the crater too much.
1675115|CDR|You want 234/2.1. Okay.
1675120|CC|And remember we talked about parking on the southeast rim.
1675121|CDR|It wanders like our wander factor in here has got to be 50 percent.
1675125|CC|Copy that.
1675129|LMP|Bob, you're cut - you're being cut out. I can't tell what you're saying. Isn't that where we want to go, over there?
1675137|CDR|23 - Well, -
1675138|LMP|Well, - look, ... way to get - -
1675139|CDR|- - ... found the crater.
1675140|CC|234 or 232 - -
1675142|LMP|No, we didn't ... there on the right.
1675142|CC|- - it doesn't make much difference, 17. If you see Van Serg, that's what we want.
1675148|CDR|Well, you're - Let me wander over that way. That's where I want to get, but I couldn't go there because of that -
1675157|LMP|There's a different looking rock there.
1675158|CC|And remember, we're talking about parking on the southeast rim.
1675206|LMP|Yes, I think you're going to have to bear right.
1675209|CDR|Yes. That's why I - I've got to get through this field, though.
1675211|LMP|Yes, I know (laughter).
1675215|CDR|Okay, Bob. We're still primarily in an extreme block field here now. It's up to a 20 percent cover, and - of fragments mostly the subfloor. Some of it looks quite highly shattered. There's - I just saw one piece that looked like a white anorthositic rock.
1675243|CDR|How's this look to you? We can go farther up there, I guess. Let me go farther up.
1675246|LMP|Well, okay, if you can get up.
1675248|CDR|Get a little farther on the southeast.
1675250|LMP|A little higher is apt to overdo it.
1675255|CDR|Okay.
1675255|LMP|There are - there is some - some grayish rocks that are - -
1675301|CDR|Oops! I centered. Right, coming up here. I turn to the right and park right here.
1675307|LMP|- - That have a - somewhat of a swirl texture.
1675312|CDR|Okay, Bob, we're at 230/2.2.
1675318|CC|Copy that. Copy you parked.
1675325|CDR|Yep. What did I say? 230 on that? Yes, bearing is 230/2.2, and I'm parked on a heading of 320, which gives you a better view.
1675342|CC|Copy 320 for the parking.
1675349|CDR|Yes, 3-330.
1675352|LMP|Oh, boy. This is getting harder and harder. Got it ... also. Don't know what's wrong with it, now. I might have got it twisted.
1675416|CDR|Here, let me look at it.
1675418|LMP|Got it hooked, but not so I can get it undone.
1675421|CDR|Here let me look at it. I'd say stay put, but I don't think you have any choice.
1675430|LMP|That fender just curled under, that's where we're getting the dust - starting to warp.
1675437|CDR|Look at those other fenders, talk about warping.
1675440|LMP|Did I get it twisted or something?
1675442|CDR|Yes, you did twist it when you put it on. Okay, squanch down.
1675444|LMP|I'm squanched.
1675445|CDR|Okay. Had one twist in it.
1675451|LMP|Boy, that makes a difference.
1675452|CDR|Sure does. Here. Your footpan's down, too.
1675500|LMP|I'll get it. It's lost it's stiffness in there. Okay - okay, I guess nominal plan for Shorty, huh? ... Van Serg.
1675514|CDR|Okay, 2 POWER'S ON -
1675518|LMP|Van Serg looks like a blocky rim fresh impact crater right now.
1675524|CC|Okay. We copy that. How about scuffing your feet and seeing if it looks orange underneath?
1675526|LMP|Slight differences - Don't worry.
1675534|CC|And, Gene, before you go away, we'd like the rest of the Rover readouts, like batteries. And how about a SEP temp readout before one of you guys leave there?
1675547|CDR|Get - Can you get that on that side, Jack?
1675548|LMP|I will.
1675550|CDR|Should have TV.
1675550|CC|Roger. We have it, and I'm sure that Ed would like a good dusting Job up front.
1675557|CDR|Well, there's so much - -
1675601|LMP|I'll dust it if you can't read it. I'll get it.
1675604|CDR|- - dust. I've got it.
1675604|LMP|I'll get it.
1675605|CDR|- - Just over the gauge. It's about 12 - 125 on the SEP.
1675612|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1675613|LMP|Boy, everything is really bad now. The fender warped.
1675617|CDR|Yes, the fender cut - dug under. See if you can straighten it out.
1675620|CC|Okay, and leave the covers - -
1675621|CDR|Okay. Amp hours, 82 and 80. Battery, 122 and off scale low. Forwards are 210, 240; Rears are 225 and 2 - 220.
1675643|CC|Okay, We copy that.
1675645|CDR|That's just a sample of the kind of - kind of dust we would have got, Jack, if we hadn't of had that fender yesterday. Fender's almost worn out.
1675654|LMP|Can you get a dustbrush, and let's check our camera.
1675658|CDR|Stay where you are, and I'll give you a zappareno wherever you are.
1675716|CDR|Okay.
1675719|LMP|That it?
1675719|CDR|Yes.
1675720|LMP|Okay, how many bags do I have.
1675722|CDR|I don't know, but I've got a lot of dusting to do here.
1675724|LMP|Do you have a lot of bags?
1675726|CDR|Yes. I must have - I've got four of them is all.
1675731|LMP|I'd better change my bag.
1675735|CDR|Can't even read the Rover.
1675737|LMP|Yes. I have an empty bag on me now, right, a collection bag?
1675740|CDR|Empty.
1675747|LMP|Don't know how much time do we have here?
1675747|CC|Okay, 17 - We're looking at a nominal, Station 9 here. You've got about 25 minutes remaining.
1675804|CDR|No such thing as a nominal station anymore.
1675807|CC|This may be the first and only one of the traverse.
1675813|LMP|The geology won't let it be nominal. Hey, I've got some new bags, Bob.
1675818|CC|Okay. We copy that, Jack.
1675819|LMP|And I guess I'm pretty good on film.
1675821|CC|Okay. And you're going to get a radial sample here, and so you might check your Rover sample bag supply.
1675829|LMP|That's right. I want to take that.
1675829|CC|And you might - and you might give me frame count or check it to make sure you're okay.
1675836|LMP|I just did, and it's 123.
1675840|CC|Okay, good enough.
1675845|CDR|How do you want the SEP blankets?
1675847|CC|Leave them closed, please, Gene - -
1675849|CDR|Open or closed?
1675849|CC|- - as closed as they'll get.
1675851|LMP|CLOSED.
1675857|CDR|We been riding with this thing off?
1675900|LMP|What?
1675901|CDR|SEP?
1675903|LMP|Yes, it should be off.
1675904|CDR|Yes, it is. Doesn't seem like it'd get much data that way. Even if it's hot.
1675909|CC|Yes, but it's - it's automatic - -
1675911|CDR|I guess they're worried about getting it so hot it - -
1675912|CC|- it shuts itself off when it gets above 108, so it's no good anyway.
1675918|CDR|Are you kidding? We're - oh, boy.
1675920|CC|We've been hoping all day - it's been off all day. We've been hoping that it would - since Station 6 - We've been hoping that it would cool down so that we could get some more data, but it's not, obviously.
1675931|CDR|It's not going to make it, Bob.
1675933|CC|That's obvious by now.
1675937|CDR|That's a - that's a shame.
1675939|LMP|This is starting to look like a geological survey expedition. The vehicle's are all covered with dust.
1680000|LMP|Oh, look what's in there.
1680005|PAO|EVA time 4 hours 27 minutes.
1680018|CDR|I don't think I can read that unless I dust it with a lens brush - Okay. Get my - Okay, can I get by you here?
1680045|LMP|My - my bag look all right to you?
1680047|CDR|Yes, it's still closed.
1680049|LMP|Okay. Okay. What are we going to do here? We're going to go up there and sample on the rim, look at the walls, and the floor, and miscellaneous, and - -
1680105|CDR|Well, we are on the rim ...
1680105|LMP|- - then you're going to take 500 millimeters when you get back to the Rover while I do a radial sample.
1680115|CDR|Okay.
1680116|LMP|But the big - the first thing we do is go up to the crater. Bob, I think the mantle objective here really is immaterial and - because the - there's - blocky ejecta around the crater covers - oh, boy - Well, it looks like it - it extends several hundred meters out from the rim - say a couple of hundred meters.
1680149|CC|All right. Copy that, Jack.
1680150|LMP|We're quite a ways - we're pretty close to the rim.
1680153|CC|Yes, we can see that.
1680155|LMP|We're pretty close. I'll go up on the rim, Gene, and see what we've got.
1680223|LMP|Tiptoe through the tulips (singing) - -
1680226|CC|Okay. Let's get grabs before you guys leave.
1680229|CDR|I'm getting it right now. Let me see; anything else you want me to do while I'm here?
1680237|CC|Negative.
1680244|LMP|Sure look like shocked rocks to me.
1680253|CDR|Lot of glass splattered on some of these, Jack.
1680255|LMP|Yes.
1680305|LMP|We might even find some shatter cones. But don't tell anybody.
1680316|LMP|Well, I'll say one thing for old Van Serg, it's blocky. Whoo!
1680324|CDR|MARK. Gravimeter.
1680325|CC|Copy that.
1680330|LMP|Bob. This is about - I think this is the only clearly - well, I won't even say that. This is at least a blocky - a large blocky rim crater. But even it has the mantle dust ma - material covering the rim, partially buried rocks. And it's down on the floor, as near as I can tell, and on the walls. The crater itself has a central mound of - of blocks that's probably 50 meters in diameter - that's a little high - 30 meters in diameter. It - Many of the blocks are - -
1680431|CDR|Holy Smoley!
1680432|LMP|- - intensely shattered in that area, as the ones that are on the walls. I don't see any sign of organization of the blocks in the walls right now. There's a possibility that on the west wall, there's an indication that there's slightly darker gray rocks starting about halfway down the crater. And that's - that level is coincident with what appears to be a bench on the northwest wall. And that bench - hints of that bench - it's not continuous, but hints of it are around on the north wall and, I think, right below us - yes, on the southeast wall. The - We'll start - The rocks are pretty badly broken in many cases. And - well, I haven't seen any real glass yet. Yes. We'll start looking at them a little more carefully.
1680555|LMP|Some of them - That looks like a breccia right there in front of us.
1680556|CDR|Yes. There's some interesting patterns on the surface.
1680602|LMP|Stand by. Wait, wait, wait. I keep - Aw! Sorry, Geno, but -
1680621|CDR|Okay?
1680622|LMP|Locator. Afraid I haven't been doing my duty on locators, occasionally.
1680643|LMP|See that?
1680644|CDR|Yes. I got it.
1680649|LMP|Okay, Gene's tearing apart one of the - -
1680652|CDR|Here. There you go.
1680653|LMP|- - very intensely fractured rocks. And it comes off in small flakes. Let's get this one, because this will be the best oriented one for documentation, plus why don't you get that one you've got inside there?
1680708|CDR|Yes, I am.
1680711|LMP|Got a bag?
1680716|LMP|Bag 568 is a fragment from the surface. That's a corner, I think, off the block that Gene documented here.
1680728|CDR|Yes; it is.
1680730|LMP|We'll get - we'll get another sample - that'll be from inside the block.
1680742|CDR|Get it with this real easy. Here's a whole big - we ought to take that just as is.
1680757|LMP|Well, put it - put it in your - put a bag around if we - around one end if we can. Here the other end is smaller.
1680805|CDR|Yes. Hold this - -
1680805|LMP|Let me hold this end. Let me hold it, and you put the bag on.
1680810|CDR|That's breccia, too. That's - -
1680812|LMP|Well, it's - -
1680813|CDR|Well, see that? See the white fragments in there?
1680815|LMP|Yes. It certainly - -
1680816|CDR|It's got a lot of very small - -
1680817|LMP|It - it looks like this big one over here. You know, it might be that the - these are - might be pieces of the projectile. I don't know. Because it doesn't look like - it's not subfloor.
1680831|CDR|Okay. Pin it down.
1680838|LMP|Well, that's wrapped in - if you can put it - if you put it end down, it may stay in the bag.
1680845|CDR|I doubt it.
1680846|LMP|What's the number?
1680848|CDR|It's a 480, and it's a - a relatively tabular [sic] shape, and it's about - -
1680856|LMP|And it's going to - -
1680857|CDR|- - 10 inches long.
1680858|LMP|And it's highly friable. It breaks apart.
1680903|CDR|Oh, not so much.
1680903|LMP|In small chips. Well, you can - you did it with your hands there. I call that being friable, compared to what we've seen anyway.
1680913|CDR|Okay, and let me get in after of that.
1680914|LMP|Let me get a - soil - soil right over here. Okay. The soil next to the boulder down about 3 centimeters, is in bag 569.
1680938|CC|Copy that.
1680940|LMP|Okay. And the soil and chips - about two-thirds of a meter from the boulder - -
1680953|CDR|Get another one?
1680954|LMP|Yes - are in bag 570.
1681001|CC|Copy that.
1681012|LMP|Okay. Let me get over here. You're going to step on your gnomon there.
1681018|CDR|I wouldn't step on my gnomon. I'm going to get this one - crimped.
1681025|LMP|Okay. There, very clearly, is a central, mound. And now that we've looked at this one, the mound looks like it's composed of gray fragment breccias much like what we've just sampled - -
1681039|CDR|...
1681040|LMP|- - dark gray. And again it might be related - -
1681044|CDR|Jack.
1681046|LMP|Oh, excuse me. I didn't hear you.
1681047|LMP|Related to the projectile. Now, we've got to see if there is subfloor up here, or whether we're dealing with another unit somewhere. Got your after.
1681056|CDR|Okay. I don't see any - -
1681058|LMP|Well, the more coherent rocks - this looks like subfloor.
1681102|CDR|I don't see any orange material either.
1681104|LMP|Not yet.
1681112|CDR|This particular rock we've sampled has tabular fractures, and in one-half of the rock, they are definitely oriented.
1681129|LMP|Boy, I'll tell you, I don't - There's more dust on these rocks. It's harder to see a fresh surface. They're not as clean. That's subfloor.
1681146|CDR|Look, even the floor of the crater is mantled, down there.
1681147|LMP|You know, that seems - Yes. That seems like a - what you got? A piece of glass?
1681154|CDR|Yes, I think it is glass. At least it's glass covered - just glass covered. Houston, I've got an undocumented sample. It's about 2 meters west of where we just sampled. It's a glass-covered -oh, baseball-size rock in 571.
1681212|CC|Copy that.
1681217|LMP|A lot of these blocks up here, Houston, are - particularly the more fractured ones, but even some that aren't - are a gray matrix fragment breccia. And it looks like - really, the fragments are quite fine. There are no - On the rim anyway, we haven't seen any large fragments. The largest I've seen is about 2 centimeters. But down in the mound you can see some fragments that are probably half a meter in diameter.
1681300|CDR|Jack, are you going around that rim of the crater up there?
1681302|LMP|I was just looking at rocks.
1681303|CDR|Well, okay.
1681305|LMP|We - we - -
1681305|CDR|I want to get a pan before we leave back there.
1681307|LMP|Oh, yes. We need to see if we can get some of the subfloor. I'm not sure I understand what's happened here, yet. This should have brought up subfloor according to the theory, and it hasn't.
1681319|CDR|That looks like some of the - look at some of the breccias - the blue breccias with the white - big old slabby white - with the fracture face with the white inclusions.
1681328|LMP|Down there.
1681329|CDR|Yes, down in the floor, Jack.
1681330|LMP|Yes, it has that appearance all right. Hey, Gene. Do you see that rock - -
1681334|CDR|That's a - -
1681334|LMP|- - that rock that's fractured in sort of a pyramid shape down there? Out here on the right - the right end of - of the floor down there - that big one?
1681342|CDR|Yes.
1681342|LMP|It's sort of pointing west.
1681344|CDR|Yes.
1681344|LMP|It's really neat. That's a unique fracture, isn't it?
1681347|CC|Roger, 17 - -
1681348|LMP|And there's another one that's fractured almost in a ... - -
1681350|CC|- - And we'd like to be moving from here in about 10 minutes, so we probably better be trending back toward the Rover, unless you're seeing something really great out there.
1681357|LMP|Well. Hey, Bob, we ought to - we ought to find out whether or not we got - whether - what the rock is here, if you've got a little time.
1681405|CDR|Jack, do you want me to put this in your bag and start - I'm sorry.
1681405|CC|Roger. You got - you got 10 minutes. I'm just telling you to start thinking about getting back.
1681414|LMP|Yes. We're always thinking that way.
1681415|CDR|Okay, Bob. One thing I noticed we do uncover. There's a lot of - oh, 2, 3, 4-millimeter-size fragments of glass we're kicking up all over the place.
1681425|LMP|Yes.
1681427|CDR|Little glass balls.
1681428|LMP|Hey, Gene?
1681429|CDR|Almost like Pele's -
1681431|LMP|Gene?
1681431|CDR|Yes.
1681432|LMP|Can you come over here? I think there's some subfloor here. We ought to - -
1681436|CDR|Okay.
1681437|LMP|We ought to try to document it. But I tell you, most of the rocks are the - are the fine-fragment breccias. Let me see if I can't get one of those little - -
1681445|CDR|There's some glass.
1681446|LMP|Hey.
1681447|CDR|You see if they're like Pele's - -
1681448|LMP|Okay.
1681450|CDR|- - ... eyeballs or whatever they are.
1681453|LMP|I think we can get some over here. If you're - if you're careful coming over here, we can get glass that looks like it may have crystallized in place there.
1681500|CDR|Okay. I'm talking about those little - little balls, too. See that - -
1681506|LMP|Whoo, take it easy - Take it easy.
1681508|CDR|Where are you? Right there?
1681508|LMP|Yes, but put your gnomon right over here, and we can get that for glass and that for subfloor.
1681514|CDR|Okay. Let me -
1681515|LMP|But I'm not sure that is. I Just - it may be breccia there - Everything is covered with dust here, and it's hard to tell the types. Most of the rocks we're seeing are breccias. Make sure that glass is in your stereo.
1681547|LMP|Okay, be careful with it.
1681552|CDR|Oh, shoot!
1681608|CDR|I don't have any bags so -
1681611|LMP|Okay, the glass - looks like a glass agglutinate. Oh, no!
1681620|LMP|Did it break? Good. I think that will survive going back now.
1681630|LMP|Okay. It's a frothy - glass agglutinate is going to be in bag 481.
1681643|CC|Copy that.
1681646|LMP|And - and it looks like a - almost like a cowpie - pile-type of bomb, Bob, if you'll pardon the expression.
1681656|CC|I will. I don't know whether anybody else - -
1681658|LMP|Although it's not flattened. It's - it's - it's a - it's an aggregate of glass in - or it's a pile of about four fragments, much like the one we're sampling.
1681716|CDR|Jack, we want to get a good scoop sample here. Maybe can we get some of those little fine pieces of glass around.
1681721|LMP|And it looks like it's - it's in place from the day it was born.
1681726|CC|Copy that.
1681728|CDR|Oh, gol dig da! I'm having a hard time with this one.
1681737|LMP|A piece of that rock rigiht behind it.
1681742|CDR|If I can -
1681751|LMP|Want a bag?
1681755|CDR|Yes. I'm going to turn around. Just not going to be able to get that one in the bag, I don't think.
1681807|PAO|EVA time 4 hours 45 minutes.
1681819|LMP|Okay, Houston. My sample's in - 482 is a rock, but it doesn't look like subfloor. It looks like the blue-gray material we've been seeing - the breccia-type material.
1681830|CDR|Yes.
1681832|LMP|I don't think there's any difference.
1681836|CDR|Got it in!
1681838|LMP|Might just as well throw them in my bag.
1681846|CC|Okay, and - -
1681847|CDR|I want a scoop out of here, though, Jack.
1681849|CC|17, why don't we get that scoop sample as the first sample of Jack's radial sample, 17?
1681858|CDR|Okay. That's right. You're getting a radial sample. That's fine. I forgot you were doing that.
1681904|LMP|Oh, man.
1681905|CDR|That's all right, Jack. That won't come out. Just-put it in there.
1681916|LMP|Oh, boy.
1681919|CDR|Okay. Let's let that one be the last -
1681921|LMP|Here's one.
1681922|CDR|Well, okay. Those are the last ones that you can take. Got a lock?
1681932|LMP|No, I don't - stand by, a second on that.
1681941|CDR|Okay. Okay, before you go back - I got to go down after a picture here. And I want to get a pan of this thing. We can get a stereo pan - as you start your radial sample.
1682003|LMP|Yes. Are you going to - You - you take the after from there, and I'll go over here and -
1682010|CDR|Okay. You - -
1682010|LMP|Well, wait a minute.
1682011|CDR|- - you need the gnomon?
1682012|LMP|No.
1682013|CDR|Okay. I'm going to go over behind me and take part of the stereo.
1682016|LMP|Where are you going to take your pan? Let me see.
1682018|CDR|From - from behind me, where we were.
1682018|LMP|Well, I think I'll just take my radial right from here to the Rover.
1682023|CDR|That's great. That's great. Just do that, and then you'll be right back at the Rover.
1682027|LMP|And I'll take my pan from here, so you -
1682048|CDR|Man, there's about four or five different modes of travel out here.
1682208|CDR|I don't believe it.
1682210|LMP|What?
1682212|CDR|I think I'm out of film.
1682214|LMP|You're out of film?
1682217|CDR|150. And it stopped clicking. Jack, I - I - I didn't get the rest of that crater down there.
1682225|LMP|Okay.
1682226|CDR|I only got it 12 o'clock and around. Well, shucks.
1682234|LMP|I can get it.
1682237|CDR|Well, here's where I -
1682239|LMP|Well, I'm going to be out of film, too, here before long.
1682242|CDR|Okay. Just don't worry about it then. Just press on with your radials.
1682244|LMP|I've got - I got a good pan over here. Did you get the crater at all?
1682247|CDR|I got the right half of it and probably two-thirds of it, so we're going to - I'm just going to have to let that do. Okay. I'm going to see if I can get some 500s while you're doing that.
1682306|LMP|Hey, this isn't going to be an ideal - radial sample - but it will have to do.
1682317|CDR|Hippity hopping over hill and dale (singing).
1682343|CDR|Bob, would you tell me what your primary desires are again on the 500, based upon what we have?
1682351|CC|Okay. The primary desire will be the North Massif, the blocks, and the trail.
1682400|CDR|Okay.
1682404|CC|And while you're at the Rover, they want you to take the gravimeter off again, and we'll get another Rover and a - well another surface measurement here, as well - to check against the Rover.
1682420|CDR|Okay. Here's a reading. I think I owe you one of those, don't I?
1682428|CC|Roger.
1682430|CDR|670, 037, 801; 670, 037, 801.
1682437|CC|Copy that.
1682441|CDR|I didn't know we were going to do both of these things. I thought we were going to do one or the other. But - if we're going to do it, we might as well do it right.
1682458|CDR|MARK it. It's flashing.
1682513|LMP|Okay, bag - stand by - 52 Yankee is at the rim crest.
1682527|CC|Copy that.
1682541|CDR|Well, I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to use the Rover to steady the 500, and see what happens.
1682628|LMP|Oh, I should have let you take this scoop back. Oh, no. Oh, me. Well, shoot! This isn't working out too well, Dr. Parker.
1682647|CC|Say again there, Jack.
1682701|LMP|This isn't working out too well. I've got to get rid of this scoop.
1682705|CDR|Just set it there and take your sample. We'll get it.
1682709|LMP|I'll take the samples going back.
1682749|LMP|Just like in training, the scoop doesn't stay locked to the ...
1682831|CC|Okay, 17. We'd like you to press on. We'll abort the radial sample. We'd like to leave here immediately, if not sooner, to head for Station 10. Enough of the 500 millimeters, Gene. And we'll give you some information here on mags. We need the gravimeter put back on the Rover, if you haven't already. If it's on the ground, we didn't get the mark, but it's probably done by now. And we're going to take the DSEA out of the tape recorder here, and we'd like to get that all done pronto.
1682911|CDR|Okay. 85 is the mag count on the 500.
1682914|CC|Copy 85 on the 500.
1682915|LMP|I think that's a smart move, Bob. I don't think - I don't think the radial sample's going to tell you much here.
1682921|CC|Okay. Let's take a -
1682924|LMP|I don't under - I - I -
1682926|CC|Go ahead.
1682931|CDR|Jack, you ought to get a scoop of that dirt, though.
1682934|LMP|Well, there's - -
1682935|CDR|One scoop. We don't have a scoop of it, do we?
1682937|LMP|Look what's underneath it.
1682939|CDR|Well, I don't know what's underneath it.
1682940|LMP|It's white.
1682942|CDR|Well, I wanted to make sure we got some of those small glass balls.
1682946|LMP|Yes, we'll get a scoop of it. Upon the top.
1682950|CC|17, we're anxious for you guys to get going.
1682954|CDR|Okay. Here's your gravimeter reading from the surface; 670, 057, 101; 670, 057, 101.
1683007|CC|Copy that.
1683007|CDR|Do you want me to change my mag at the next station?
1683010|LMP|Come here, Gene, quickly. We can't - we can't leave this. This may be the youngest mantle over - whatever was - -
1683021|CDR|Take pictures of it. I don't have any film.
1683022|LMP|- - was thrown out of the craters.
1683025|CDR|Take pictures of it. Bob, we've got to take 5 more minutes. We'll be right with you.
1683031|CDR|What Jack's done is he dug a - a trench in a - the southwest-northeast direction, and he discovered about 3 inches below - 4 inches below the surface - a very light-gray material.
1683049|LMP|Possibility here - Careful, Geno.
1683051|CDR|Yes.
1683059|CDR|Take that crust.
1683100|LMP|Well, I'm trying - I'm trying to get the - the upper portion there. There we go.
1683107|LMP|The first 2 centimeters, bag 483. The next 5 - Ahhh - in 484. Augh!
1683143|CDR|Get some?
1683144|LMP|I got quite a bit.
1683145|CDR|That's enough.
1683146|LMP|I got quite a bit. Here, you got to put that away, don't you?
1683152|CDR|Yes.
1683153|LMP|And the next 10 centimeters of the light-gray material, be in - probably in 486, if we're lucky - get it off.
1683212|CDR|Okay.
1683214|LMP|I think it is 486, right?
1683215|CDR|Yes. 485!
1683218|LMP|485. Okay. What did I say 483, 484? Okay.
1683225|CDR|You with us, Bob?
1683226|CC|Roger. We're with you.
1683227|LMP|He's mad at us now.
1683230|CC|How'd you guess?
1683232|LMP|Okay. The third sample is in 485.
1683234|CC|Copy that.
1683238|LMP|Okay. Whoops, sorry. Bob, a possibility here is that the - this upper 6 inches of gray material in here is the latest mantling in the area and the light-colored debris may be what's left over from the impact.
1683259|CC|Okay, I copy. I understand. But we'd like to get you going. In case you didn't get the clue.
1683306|CDR|I know. We're going. Okay.
1683309|LMP|All right. What else? Magazines.
1683312|CDR|No, we'll change them at the next station. Isn't that right, Bob ?
1683315|LMP|No, I've got to have some. I got to get some, or I can't take -
1683319|CC|Okay, 17. We need Jack to put on magazine Nancy. And we'd like, Gene, for you to pull out the DSEA tape recorder at this station.
1683331|CDR|Okay, I need a magazine too, Bob. I don't have any film at all.
1683335|CC|Roger. That'll be Bravo if you change yours here. You could change it at Station 10.
1683342|CDR|I'll change it here. It's just as easy while we're in there.
1683345|CC|Okay.
1683348|LMP|Okay. You want Bravo, huh?
1683349|CDR|Bravo. And I'll get the tape - I'll get the DSEA. Bravo was outside there, I thought.
1683402|LMP|There you go. Let me get this - hold it one -long enough for me to get this. Then I can get rid of this all at one time.
1683408|CDR|Okay. Oh.
1683411|LMP|Well, that's all right.
1683412|CDR|I can't put that back in.
1683415|LMP|Got it?
1683416|CDR|I got - I got Bravo.
1683418|LMP|Okay. I got that one.
1683420|CDR|We lost the dark slide out of Bravo, and it's - it's in the dirt. I'm not going to pick it up.
1683427|CC|All right. Copy that. There's no point in putting it back in. It probably wouldn't go in anyway.
1683432|CDR|Well, that's dirty. Okay. I'm changed. And I don't know what the mag count is, but let me get the DSEA. If this thing is true to form, I'm going to have to get in there - I got to - oh, it tripped! Well, now what's - Hey, we got some rocks in that big bag. Okay. We're done with the SEP. DSEA is coming out. I hope there's something on it.
1683549|CDR|Oh - Jiminy Christmas - I can't even pick up that big bag to close the gate.
1683549|CDR|I've got to - I've got to trip that latch with - with tongs or something to lock it.
1683605|CC|Okay. And, Jack; Houston. Over.
1683612|LMP|Go ahead.
1683613|CC|Okay, we've - -
1683616|LMP|Go ahead.
1683616|CC|- - had a change of heart here again, as usual. And we're going to drop Station 10 now that we've heard you so much, and we're going to get a double core here. And we'd like to get the - some football-size rocks while you're doing that. But double core here, and then we're going to leave here and go back to the LM.
1683634|LMP|You don't want a - You don't want a - you don't want a double core here. I don't think we can do it, Bob. It's too rocky.
1683643|CDR|You don't think we'll get through that stuff you just trenched?
1683645|LMP|Well, I'm afraid there are rocks all through it, Gene. We can try, but -
1683650|CDR|Let's try it.
1683651|LMP|Well, I don't like to try things that there is a probability of failure on - if you can - You're just going to lose some time. Okay, mag Nancy in on the LMP's camera.
1683700|CC|Copy that.
1683709|LMP|Well, this is - you can see the rock population here, Houston. But we can try it.
1683724|CDR|Sure. If we get a single, we get a single out of it.
1683729|LMP|Oh, you're doing it, huh?
1683730|CDR|I've got it started.
1683731|LMP|Well, you're not even - okay. Not even going to debate the issue.
1683735|CDR|Well, it takes too much time debating it.
1683737|LMP|Well, let's see how much time it takes. I hope you're right.
1683741|CC|Okay. And -
1683742|CDR|Okay, and we need a - we need a lower out of my bag.
1683746|LMP|Let me get the core.
1683747|CDR|A lower out of my bag is all we need.
1683749|LMP|Watch it. You're in a crater almost.
1683750|CDR|Yes. I want to get ... for you.
1683752|CC|Okay. We have to have you guys moving in 10 minutes. And we'd like to also deploy EP number 5 here.
1683801|CDR|Okay. I'll start on the ... - -
1683805|LMP|- - ... the lower 5?
1683810|LMP|This is a lower, right?
1683811|CDR|Yes.
1683812|LMP|You got an upper?
1683812|CDR|Yes. Why don't you get 5 out, and I'll start on the core.
1683821|LMP|... And I'll put it - I'll put that right there.
1683829|CDR|Okay. The lower is 50; the upper is 37.
1683834|CC|Copy. 50 and 37.
1683838|CDR|You got 5, Jack?
1683840|LMP|Yes.
1683841|CDR|Okay.
1683849|LMP|Why don't you put it up - well - You put the gnomon away. Put it fairly near that trench. At least there is some documentation there. I'll try to have the pan going while you're doing it. Okay, Houston. Which way you going to drive out of here?
1683909|CDR|I'm driving out of here -
1683911|LMP|Left or right?
1683912|CDR|I - I've got to go right. I got to go right.
1683916|LMP|Okay. Pin 1 is pulled and safe. Pin 2 is pulled - safe. Pin 3 is pulled and safe.
1683946|CC|Okay, Jack. And we'll document it back to the Rover, I guess is the best way. That doesn't look too hard, Gene. Until just now.
1683952|CDR|... Oops, looks like you proved me wrong.
1683959|CDR|The first core was easy; the second one a little tougher; and then it got tough down at the end.
1684004|LMP|Stay there, I'm getting a picture of you.
1684006|CDR|Okay. Okay.
1684009|LMP|I got it.
1684010|CDR|You got it from here? Okay.
1684011|LMP|Yes.
1684045|CDR|Core but it wants to slide out. It's full. No rocks in it. It looks like just the same stuff we've been traveling through.
1684057|CC|Okay, Jack. I think you better help Gene with that - recovering that core there where the ... going to fall out.
1684106|LMP|You know, I think you're right. And if you'll just wait until I finish the pan, that's exactly what I'm going to do.
1684111|CC|Okay. I didn't know what you were doing.
1684113|CDR|Bob, it's capped.
1684114|CC|Got you. Okay.
1684121|CDR|You hold - just hold the handle.
1684130|LMP|Okay? I can take this one.
1684132|CDR|It's very - very loose soil, Jack. And it's - just any little movement and you'll lose some of it.
1684140|CDR|Let me cap that end. Don't move it.
1684141|LMP|Uh-oh, you're - you almost knocked some out. Get your - you know where your thing is.
1684145|CDR|Yes, but I need you - that - that cap's on you. The last one's gone off the Rover.
1684149|LMP|That's all right. I'll stay here. Go put your top in. I won't move it.
1684224|CDR|Any little movement and that stuff starts - -
1684226|LMP|Yes. Okay.
1684239|CDR|Go - turn around. I'll get the rammer.
1684241|LMP|Okay,
1684243|CDR|Oh, man! Even these pins are getting stiff. Okay, Bob. The top rammed down - oh, almost half way without any effort.
1684309|CC|Copy that.
1684310|LMP|The scoop's back on.
1684316|CDR|The bottom rammed down about an inch.
1684319|CC|Copy that.
1684326|CDR|Okay, Robert. Let's see -
1684330|LMP|Turn around and I'll get this.
1684331|CDR|- what was the last thing - let's see - we had to do?
1684334|LMP|A couple of football-size rocks.
1684335|CDR|You got the DSEA?
1684338|LMP|I got it. I got the charge. You got the double core. I got the double core. And I got one sample of a radial sample (laughter).
1684345|CC|We got a - that's a unique one.
1684348|LMP|In my pocket (laughter).
1684348|CC|And have we got the gravimeter back on the Rover?
1684354|LMP|Yes; it's on.
1684356|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1684356|LMP|And we want to get a large block. Why don't we - Why don't we - -
1684400|CC|Okay, and there's a - -
1684401|CDR|No, let's get a couple of them. I've got - I've got one.
1684401|CC|- - ... here for a SESC from the shallow trench. We'd also like to have you moving in 4 minutes. That's with wheels rolling in 4 minutes.
1684411|LMP|SESC, huh?
1684413|CC|Roger; but we have to have the wheels rolling - -
1684415|LMP|I don't know if we can do that. We can try it.
1684416|CC|We want the wheels rolling in 4 minutes, so I don't think it's practical at this time.
1684422|CDR|Bob, we cannot get an SESC in 4 minutes - -
1684425|CC|Okay. Copy that - -
1684426|CDR|- - and roll - -
1684426|CC|- - Copy that.
1684427|CDR|- - at the same time.
1684433|CDR|Now, I've got to push this latch on the - on the gate to get it locked - on the pallet to get it locked.
1684439|LMP|Need some help?
1684440|CDR|Push the pallet while I trip the latch, will you? Because I got to trip the latch. There's so much dust in that core.
1684450|LMP|Get it?
1684451|CDR|No. No. Wait a minute. Open it up. Wait a minute.
1684504|LMP|Okay.
1684506|CDR|Now - now that's where - now let me trip it.
1684513|LMP|Okay. Try it.
1684519|CDR|Locked?
1684520|LMP|Yes. Yes.
1684521|CDR|Should be locked now.
1684521|LMP|That got it. That got it.
1684530|CDR|Okay.
1684531|LMP|Got a big rock there, too?
1684533|LMP|It's a - well, you know, the thing that amazes me is that there's no subfloor around here.
1684540|CDR|I got one here.
1684550|CDR|Okay. I'm about ready to clean up the Rover here.
1684557|CC|Okay, 17. What's out there in the distance on a hillside in the field of view of the camera? The camera is pointing at it. Oh, I'll bet that's the - that's the - -
1684609|CDR|What's out there in the distance. Which hill? Let me see the - -
1684611|CC|- - that's the flag, I bet, on the charge.
1684616|CDR|Yes, but it's only - you're looking right at it, but it's only 10 meters away.
1684621|CC|Okay. It's hanging in front of the hills. That's the problem.
1684623|CDR|You're looking right at the flag.
1684624|CC|Okay. It's hanging in front of the hills. We thought we had an artifact or something like that. Okay. Press on.
1684635|LMP|Bob, bag 486 is a light-colored rock taken about 3 meters to the right of the Rover. It should be - you should be able to pick it out in that last pan, unless the focus was bad.
1684653|CDR|Bob, you got all your TG readings?
1684655|CC|Roger. We've got that. We'd like to have you climb on.
1684700|CDR|You want the LCRU off?
1684703|CC|Roger. Let's go to LCRU power off.
1684707|CDR|Okay, Jack, let's - better get going.
1684713|LMP|Yes. You know, I don't think there is any subfloor in here. The rocks are so dust covered that it's hard to be sure, but no rock I picked up looked like subfloor.
1684726|CDR|Get on there one time.
1684731|LMP|Ready?
1684735|CDR|I got three of them that time.
1684738|LMP|(Laughter)
1684739|CC|17, Houston. Do you read me through the - the LM?
1684743|LMP|You're loud and clear.
1684745|CC|Roger. Thank you.
1684748|CDR|I hope they came out. Okay.
1684757|LMP|I hope ... twisted this time, if I can get off.
1684801|CDR|Oh, let's see if old twinkletoes can do it. Jack, there's a big - a big one right there in my floor pan. That's what I did last time.
1684817|LMP|Okay. I'm on, strangely enough.
1684829|CDR|Okay. Let's see. Okay. The charge is off to the - right.
1684848|LMP|Yes, you're all - You can clear it this way or - -
1684856|CDR|Yes. I see it. I see it.
1684857|LMP|Okay.
1684900|CDR|I bet you they thought there was some more orange soil over there on the hills.
1684915|PAO|EVA time 5 hours 16 minutes.
1684916|CDR|Get out of this block field, we'll be able to move it a little bit.
1684921|LMP|I wonder where we stand on time.
1684924|CDR|Well, we've been out about 5 hours and 20 minutes or so.
1684931|LMP|Where is it - where are we headed, now that we are moving?
1684933|CC|That's affirm - -
1684934|CDR|Well, I'm trying to get around - trying to get out of the block field here, then I'll head back to the southwest.
1684946|LMP|Are we going to Sherlock at all, Bob?
1684951|CC|No, we're going ... home, follow the ... home - -
1684952|LMP|That must be Gatsby over there.
1685010|CC|And a reminder, Jack. We can get lots of photos. We've got lots of film left right now.
1685010|LMP|Okay.
1685011|CC|And, 17, Gene, I guess you're the one that took the SEP out. If you could give me - do you remember the reading of the SEP temperature when you broke it down?
1685022|CDR|Didn't even look, Bob.
1685024|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1685025|LMP|It was 125 - 125 when we started the station.
1685030|CC|Roger. Copy that.
1685035|CDR|That's Gatsby there, I guess, huh?
1685036|LMP|Yes.
1685038|CDR|It's not - it's not unlike Van Serg, though.
1685041|LMP|Hey, you know that looks like mantling. Hopefully, we can get a - watch your rock - there you go - we can get a shot looking back to the northwest - -
1685058|CDR|Yes, I'll get that when I - -
1685059|LMP|- - into Gatsby, because it looks like the mantle streams over the - the side from the southwest. Can you swing to your right - get up a little closer to the rim, there?
1685115|CDR|Hey, here's a couple fragments in spots -
1685117|LMP|Look at that. See that?
1685118|CDR|Yes.
1685118|LMP|See that structure. See how the - -
1685120|CDR|Yes.
1685120|LMP|- - See how the mantle streams over -
1685123|CDR|Yes.
1685124|LMP|- from the northwest. Can you get that?
1685126|CDR|Yes.
1685127|LMP|And from the southwest.
1685129|CDR|Got it?
1685129|LMP|Yes. Go ahead. Keep going. Good shape. Got it.
1685137|PAO|Station 10 has been eliminated, the crew will head back toward the LM.
1685139|CDR|We're 236/2.1.
1685144|LMP|Bob, what I'm looking at is the - northwest portion of Gatsby, where there's a very very concentrated block field on the inner wall, except where there are, on the southwest, three streams and on the northwest and north a continuous stream, if you will, or band, radial band, of mantle that is bur - appears to be burying that field, overlying and mantling the field. We got some pretty pictures of it, I think.
1685229|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1685235|PAO|Distance to the LM, 2.2 kilometers, estimated driving time 19 minutes.
1685235|LMP|Bob, I'm more and more convinced there's a mantle. One possibility, I guess, is that, if it's a pyroclastic mantle, that in the lunar vacuum environment and with whatever volatiles we're dealing with, the stuff becomes extremely fine upon vesiculation. We may have been on it all the time and not known it - as far as recognizing it.
1685309|CDR|As soon as we come through this draw, smooth or free of any debris or boulders it is on the other side of the upslope.
1685315|LMP|Yes. Watch it.
1685329|CDR|Bob, do we have an extra EP?
1685332|CC|No. We have two of them behind you. We're going to deploy - we're going to deploy one. I'll give you a reading soon on that.
1685341|CDR|Okay. Well, one - one I deploy at the end I know. I thought we had an extra one here somewhere.
1685345|CC|Okay. Yes, that's what I - Okay, that's the one we were planning on deploying all along, and it's there. We'll be deploying at a range of 0.1, which is just before you get to the SEP.
1685401|CDR|Okay.
1685403|LMP|I guess Sherlock's going to be right over the top over here. I saw it when we were on that other ridge.
1685412|CDR|Hey, you know, there's a lot of bad landing places around here. That old Sun angle, I think, shows most of them up.
1685427|LMP|Bob, I - -
1685427|CC|And, Geno, we were looking - -
1685429|LMP|I don't under - -
1685430|CC|- - at the map here - -
1685431|LMP|- - I don't unders - -
1685432|CC|- - and if you keep going straight to the LM, you're probably going to run into this crater area around San Luis Rey. You probably ought to head somewhat south of directly back to the LM, so we can at least tip the - western edge of Sherlock and then pick it up and go from there back to the SEP. It looks like it might be rather rough there in that dotted-lined area, if you can look at the backside of your map, Jack.
1685458|CDR|Bob, I've already been doing it. I'm at 244/1.7.
1685502|CC|Copy that. Thank you.
1685503|CDR|Already been doing that.
1685504|CC|Okay.
1685504|LMP|And, Bob, about - about 200 meters back, we crossed back into our standard mantle surface of about 1-percent fragment cover - -
1685515|CC|Okay 200 meters back ... your present location - Okay. Copy that.
1685515|LMP|- - out of this - the block field, which -
1685524|LMP|I can see the LM.
1685526|CDR|Yes, I can see the LM. And there's Sherlock, where those blocks are.
1685530|LMP|Yes, that's the block field, the Sherlock block field; that's right. That is a block field.
1685536|CDR|Some big ones there.
1685537|LMP|Yes.
1685539|CDR|Old Station 10. I might even call it 10 Alpha in honor of the Apollo Program Office. The - -
1685549|CC|10 Bravo, Apollo.
1685549|CDR|- - Apollo Spacecraft Program Office.
1685556|CDR|Oh, that's right. 10 Bravo. I knew I'd never get that straight.
1685600|CC|Do those blocks look like gabbros, you guys?
1685602|CDR|How fast do you think we're going, Jack, without looking?
1685605|LMP|I think we're going about 18 clicks.
1685608|CDR|Hey, you're just about right. Seems like the first time we've been able to go downhill.
1685618|LMP|(Laughter)
1685619|CDR|Not really.
1685623|LMP|Pull close to this big block, if you can.
1685626|CDR|Oh, yes.
1685627|LMP|And I'll try to get a reading on what it is - some pictures of it as we come up to it.
1685632|CDR|Yes. Boy that's a big one.
1685641|LMP|Watch it. ... Looks like our old friend, the subfloor - -
1685653|CDR|Subfloor, isn't it? Yes.
1685654|LMP|Yes. Vesicular subfloor. Vesicles are about a centimeter maximum size. Didn't look like they were - they look like they're fairly evenly sorted, and the rock itself seemed to be massif.
1685708|CDR|250/1.4.
1685710|CC|250/1.4.
1685712|LMP|Okay, we're back into a - we're back into about a 5-percent rock cover as we cross the edge of the Sherlock block field.
1685723|CDR|That's Sherlock over that rim over there.
1685724|LMP|Yes. Yes, Once again, all these subfloor blocks look as if they're buried. Now - not mantle, necessarily, except maybe that one. Can you swing right, just a tad?
1685739|CDR|That one's got the mantle blowing up on it, in it - -
1685742|LMP|Yes.
1685743|CDR|- - in it's fractures and everything.
1685744|LMP|That's the best example of that, I think.
1685746|CDR|Take a picture of that?
1685746|LMP|I got it. I got it.
1685746|CDR|Watch it.
1685747|LMP|Got it; got it.
1685749|CC|Okay. Now, do those blocks look like the same subfloor gabbro?
1685749|CDR|Yes, that's just got the mantle -
1685754|LMP|Watch it.
1685755|CDR|...
1685756|LMP|Yes. Everything in here so far is the tan-gray subfloor gabbro that I've seen. I haven't - Oh, there's one over there that's a blue-gray. But blue-gray is not abundant.
1685806|CC|Okay. Copy that. And, 17, as you're getting closer, we're going to want a - an LRV sample at 1.1 on the range.
1685825|CDR|Okay.
1685827|LMP|What are we now? 1.2?
1685828|CDR|1.2. Okay. We'll try to get block and soil.
1685832|CC|That'd be good.
1685834|LMP|There's a fresh little pit.
1685846|LMP|Bob, I am continually impressed by the lack of exotic fragments in here.
1685852|CDR|Hey, Jack. How about picking out a place -
1685855|LMP|... there? Okay. If you head into that little - Well that's a crater there.
1685900|CDR|Let me get around it. We can go a little bit further.
1685902|LMP|Yes. Maybe - -
1685904|CDR|I'll go up on that flat area up there.
1685905|LMP|Yes, yes. There are a lots of little fragments over there by that area - ha, ha.
1685916|CDR|Any time.
1685918|LMP|Okay. Now swing a shallow turn. Whoa. Yes, that ought to ...
1685925|CDR|- Did you get any of those?
1685926|LMP|Unfortunately, I can't see them - the shadow.
1685929|CDR|How about that one right in front of you, in front of the television camera shadow. See that little one up there? Right there. With the - -
1685939|LMP|It's a little big, I think.
1685940|CDR|Upper right, no upper right. Straight up the line.
1685942|LMP|Oh, okay. Yes. If you can get over there, I can get it.
1685946|CDR|I can get there.
1685951|LMP|Oh, I guess I had the wrong - I guess I wasn't looking at the right one. The shadow is making it impossible to see down there. Now, see what you can get.
1690003|CDR|Bob, we're at, let's see, 253/1.1.
1690009|CC|Copy that.
1690012|LMP|You're going to have to - If we do another sample, you're going to have to swing right so I can - see. I can't see this way.
1690023|CDR|Yes.
1690027|LMP|And 53 Yankee.
1690029|CC|Copy that. Is that soil or rock?
1690034|LMP|That's soil. I can't see to get a rock.
1690036|CC|Okay.
1690038|LMP|Go forward just a little bit, Gene.
1690040|CDR|Okay.
1690044|LMP|Bet you're going to get yourself in a box here.
1690047|CDR|No, that's all right.
1690048|LMP|Whoa. A little more, sorry. Little more. Okay.
1690055|CDR|You get it?
1690056|LMP|I will. Got it.
1690105|CDR|I can't see the LM anymore.
1690109|LMP|Okay. The rock fragments, that's 54 Yankee.
1690125|LMP|Ah!
1690127|CDR|Okay. You got a rock right in front of you, don't you?
1690131|LMP|I see it. Rolled over. Good old Rover.
1690147|LMP|LMP frame for that sample - Looks like about 60.
1690155|CC|Copy that.
1690159|LMP|60! Have I taken 60 pictures?
1690208|CDR|Boy, these rock fields are something else again.
1690211|LMP|Yes, 60. Looks like some of our gray variety of subfloor up here - around the rim of that little crater. You know, I'm starting to think that maybe the gray relatively nonvesicular subfloor may be deeper - deeper fraction, based on what we saw - well, actually, though, let's see - that could have been overturn, I don't know. Take that back. There just isn't much of it around here, although we saw a lot of it in the wall of Cochise.
1690300|CC|Roger. We got that.
1690301|CDR|What do you think this is, San Luis Rey?
1690302|LMP|Well -
1690305|CDR|We're at 252/0.9.
1690309|LMP|- I wouldn't doubt it at all. I'll bet that's San Luis Rey. Around the east side of it - Mariner and San Luis Rey. They're shallow - filled with rocks.
1690330|CC|As close as we can tell, you're at one or the other of them.
1690332|CDR|Boy, I tell you they're a lot - Okay. We're at 250/0.9.
1690338|CC|Copy that.
1690339|CDR|Mariner should look pretty fresh.
1690339|CC|Copy that.
1690358|LMP|Boy, I certainly don't see much variety other than the gray and the tan subfloor variety. There's old Challenger.
1690407|CDR|There she is. Pretty as a picture. (laughter). Boy, I tell you, there's no getting out of this stuff. You go from one to the other.
1690423|CC|Okay, and 17 - -
1690424|CDR|I don't know whether I said it or not - -
1690425|CC|Gene, your range is 0.1. We're going to deploy the quarter-pound charge, and that'll be Jack's getting off to deploy it like we talked about last night.
1690435|CDR|Okay. That's EP-2, Jack.
1690448|LMP|EP-2; right.
1690457|LMP|Bob, we're still - we're moving in and out of areas of say 1-percent to 5- to 10-percent blockiness. And where it gets blocky - not only is it more blocky, but we seem to have more of the medium-sized craters in the range of 20- to 5-meter-diameter craters. That may be Mariner right there.
1690543|LMP|How do you read, Bob?
1690545|CC|Loud and clear. Loud and clear.
1690550|LMP|Hey, Van Serg, let me mention again, was an unusual experience in the plains geology here. That must be part of San Luis Rey or Mariner, one.
1690606|CDR|Yes. That's pretty deep. Pretty deep.
1690611|LMP|Yes, it is. It's really big.
1690615|CDR|Yes. We're at 252 and 0.6.
1690619|CC|Copy that.
1690619|LMP|The crater on our left - that is, south of us - is a large crater. It's somewhat deeper than the craters of the same size that we've seen. And it, too, though, has - its blocks - mainly - large blocks mainly in the walls, although there are blocks - blocks up here in the rim, occasionally up to 3 meters.
1690657|LMP|Look at that string of blocks over there - that may be it.
1690700|CDR|Yes.
1690700|LMP|That's an edge of a crater, I guess.
1690702|CDR|Want a picture of that?
1690705|LMP|Got it. Look at the way that thing's fractured.
1690715|CDR|Yes, this is the San Luis Rey, Luis complex, because see how elongated it is?
1690719|LMP|Yes. Yes.
1690720|CDR|Fact is, we're going to cut right through the western half here.
1690729|CDR|We're at 244/0.4.
1690733|CC|Copy that.
1690735|LMP|Bob, I may have said earl - early - early on up there at Van Serg that I saw subfloor, but we never did sample any that I know of. And the dust was thick enough that I'm just not sure. Breccias were the most obvious thing there.
1690755|CC|Okay. Most interesting.
1690800|LMP|It might have been a window in the plains here, of some kind. But - it's strange to see it there, with so much subfloor all around it that we saw.
1690829|CC|And, Jack, you're going to get a feedwater tone pretty soon.
1690835|LMP|Got it. Hey, I should be in OFF now.
1690850|CDR|252 and 0.2.
1690854|CC|Copy that.
1690855|CDR|There she is.
1690855|CC|And as soon as we get to the 0.1, let's stop and deploy the charge.
1690903|CDR|Alright.
1690907|LMP|Okay. And then I guess - then I'll head back to the LM.
1690914|CDR|Yes, I don't go to the - -
1690917|LMP|Unless you want to go to the ALSEP.
1690919|CDR|(Laughter) I think I'm going to.
1690922|LMP|When do I go to the - Oh, you go to SEP. That's right.
1690927|CDR|No, you're SEP when I ... - -
1690929|CC|We're going to let you play the return to the ALSEP game there, Jack. We've got a few things for you to do out there, when the time comes.
1690935|LMP|Okay.
1690936|CDR|Point 1? No. We're almost to SEP. We're about - -
1690942|CC|Roger. We'll be just short of SEP.
1690943|CDR|- - 50 meters from SEP.
1690945|CC|Is it short of the antenna?
1690949|LMP|Well - -
1690950|CC|- - We'd like to have this - -
1690951|LMP|- - You see, we can get to the end of the antenna - -
1690953|CC|Well, no, no. Don't - let's have it east of the antenna. If we are there, let's deploy it right where you are.
1691000|LMP|Okay. We're about 30 meters east of the antenna. How's that?
1691004|CC|That sounds great.
1691009|LMP|Okay. And we're measuring 221 and 0.2; 221 and 0.2
1691019|CC|Copy that.
1691027|LMP|There's a rock I stood up down there, and I want to get it ...
1691029|CC|And it's EP number 2 that we're after, Jack, in case you didn't follow us.
1691035|LMP|Okay. Hey, our gate's open.
1691038|CDR|It's open?
1691040|LMP|Yes. But it looks like everything's here.
1691044|CDR|How about the big bag?
1691045|LMP|Big bag's there.
1691048|CC|Is that the gate or the pallet?
1691048|LMP|They wouldn't dare run away.
1691050|CC|The gate or the pallet?
1691054|LMP|The pallet. I'm sorry.
1691057|CC|Well, that's worse.
1691102|LMP|Seems to ride alright that way.
1691115|LMP|Boy, that dust. It's getting into everything. (Humming) Okay, I'm going to leave the gate like it is. Seems to be all right.
1691132|CDR|Okay.
1691133|LMP|Okay; EP-2.
1691138|LMP|Where is that? There it is.
1691143|CDR|Hey, Jack. You're just going to walk back from here, aren't you?
1691146|LMP|I can, yes.
1691148|CDR|Well, why don't you just go turn the SEP receiver off? Oh, we did that. The receiver's all done.
1691153|LMP|... the transmitter - but you've got to come out here anyway.
1691155|CDR|Yes, I've got to come out here. Forget it.
1691157|LMP|I can do it.
1691158|CDR|No, I was just reading ahead, but no sense - Forget it.
1691202|LMP|One thing I want you - Okay, Pin 1. Pulled and safe. Pin 2. Pulled and safe. Pin 3 is pulled and safe.
1691214|CC|Copied all those.
1691214|LMP|And I'll try to put it in a depression. I'm going to put it in a depression, if you want. Okay. And then I've got to take a pan, huh? Will a locater - yes - How about a locater to the LM?
1691244|CC|Be fine.
1691251|CDR|You going to get on, Jack, or walk back? Dealer's choice.
1691254|LMP|I'll get on.
1691255|CDR|Okay.
1691257|CDR|Okay. Locater to the LM. I'll give you a frame count, if I can read it: 90 - 92.
1691306|CC|Copy; 92.
1691316|LMP|You're going to have to go left a little, I guess.
1691321|CDR|Go left?
1691322|LMP|To avoid the antenna.
1691324|CDR|Oh - -
1691324|LMP|Yes, we don't have to worry about it.
1691325|CDR|- - we don't have to worry about it, but - but I will anyway.
1691329|LMP|Go ahead.
1691332|CDR|Okay. I'll take it easy.
1691333|LMP|Oh, that's all right.
1691340|LMP|I want to point out a rock to you I set up on end. You need to get in the bag, and you can let me off there and I'll carry it.
1691347|CDR|Okay.
1691348|LMP|But drive close enough so I can reach down and use the ... for support.
1691352|CDR|Where is it?
1691353|LMP|It's out over here. Between the - -
1691357|CDR|On which side of that antenna?
1691400|LMP|It's - -
1691402|CDR|Oh, there it is. Right there?
1691403|LMP|No. No, it's out - it's on the - it's near the LM.
1691406|CDR|Oh, okay.
1691406|LMP|Here, I can go across this thing I already did.
1691410|CDR|That bag is empty, isn't it?
1691412|LMP|Yes, that's the one I lost, I mean, I dropped.
1691419|LMP|Look's like you got over.
1691420|CDR|Yes. Yes.
1691433|LMP|I think it's that one there that's sort of dark.
1691438|CDR|Up there, straight ahead?
1691440|LMP|Yes.
1691443|CDR|Bootprints are by it. That must be it.
1691445|LMP|That's it, yes. Can you swing over so I can lean on the Rover when I put the - -
1691449|CDR|Oh. (Laughter)
1691450|LMP|That's good. No, that's good. That's perfect.
1691454|CDR|Okay. You off?
1691456|LMP|Okay. I am now - I'd hate to get run over this late in the game. Well now, what did I do that for?
1691508|CDR|(Laughter) What did you do? Kick it under?
1691510|LMP|Yes.
1691519|LMP|Need your oil changed?
1691521|CDR|Yes. While you're under there, would you check (laughter) - check my transmission, please?
1691524|LMP|(Laughter)
1691526|CDR|(Laughter) And - any bubbles on the inside of the tires? (laughter)
1691532|CDR|Okay. Have you got it?
1691534|LMP|Yes, I got it. Hey, Bob. I got my rock. It's halfway between the SEP and the LM. Wait, wait. Let me put it in the big bag - in the big bag.
1691547|CDR|Big bag. ... - -
1691548|CC|Is this that - is this that brown one you saw out here before, Jack?
1691550|CDR|Okay. Go ahead.
1691552|LMP|No, it's a gray one.
1691554|CC|Okay.
1691555|CDR|Oops - Okay?
1691557|LMP|Yes, I just lost the sample. It's in my pocket, I guess. Let me get some tongs.
1691604|CDR|Okay.
1691611|LMP|Then you can go ahead. I'll walk back. ...
1691648|PAO|EVA time 5 hours 44 minutes.
1691747|CDR|Okay, Bob. I'm back at the LM - -
1691749|CC|Roger. We have you back at the LM.
1691750|CDR|151, 12.0, and 001. Well, wait a minute.
1691804|LMP|Can you get it?
1691805|CDR|I got to get your bag - -
1691806|LMP|I got it; I got it.
1691808|CDR|Let me get your bag off.
1691818|CDR|I'm reading 80 on the amps, 78 on the amps - Correction, that's amp-hours. Voltages, 62 and 65. Battery 1 is 132, forget 0. Motor temps are 200 and 210 on the rear, 200 and 250 on the fr - forward.
1691847|CC|Okay. We copy that.
1691857|CC|Okay. And let's - let me brief you here on the closeout tonight, 17. A number of things we - we're going to do here that are slightly different. We've got some stuff for you over at the ALSEP, Jack, and I'll get with you when you go over there. Nothing we have to worry about in the meanwhile. When we unload the Rover, we're going to take the SESC out, and we're going to use that to collect the contaminated sample out behind the footpad there as per planned, and when we take the traverse gravimeter off, we're going to want to get both a grav and a bias reading, because the pallet was swinging in the breeze there. Otherwise, let's press on with the closeout, and we'll get with you as times change.
1692015|LMP|Okay, Bob. The core tubes are going in SCB-7 - I mean - Yes, 7.
1692023|CC|Okay. I copy that.
1692029|CDR|You should have TV, Bob.
1692031|CC|Rog. We have TV. Thank you.
1692041|CDR|Did you get my bag already?
1692042|LMP|Yes.
1692107|CDR|Jack?
1692107|LMP|Yes.
1692107|CDR|We'll have one more to put in here. I'm just going to lay this one over here. Yes, the big one. Man, there's some big ones in there, too.
1692111|LMP|We can get some of that subfloor.
1692119|CDR|Yes, there's one in my footpan, too. You see it there?
1692123|LMP|Yes, we'll have to - -
1692127|CDR|Why don't you leave that there for a minute? Okay What did you say about the TGE, Bob?
1692129|CC|Okay. We'd like to take TGE, of course, as we planned. Take it off, and we'll try and get both a grav and a bias reading. You might initiate one of them now. We'll initiate another one later on. We've got plenty of time while it's sitting on the ground there to - to do our thing with it.
1692152|CDR|... - -
1692152|CC|I see you've got feed water tone coming up pretty soon, Gene.
1692157|CDR|Bob, I already got it and I'm in AUTO. Just about 30 seconds ago.
1692200|CC|Okay.
1692205|CDR|Okay. How are we fixed for samples? Here's 5, and it's about 1/2 to 3/4 full.
1692212|LMP|Well, let's dump - -
1692214|CDR|We've got to carry the SECS up.
1692216|LMP|- - let's dump these - -
1692219|CDR|We got 3.
1692219|LMP|- - 3 in there, the Rover samples.
1692222|CDR|Okay. Okay. We probably ought to put the SESC in there, huh? If there's room for it.
1692242|CC|Yes, let's put the SESC someplace - -
1692243|CDR|Where do you want the SESC, Bob?
1692245|CC|Let's put the SESC someplace where it's accessible to get that contamination sample. We probably want to get it before you go off to the ALSEP, but there's no real hurry on that. We'll see what works in best. I'm not sure where the most convenient place for you - -
1692259|CDR|Yes. Why don't we get it now, and then we can - then we can have this bag - -
1692303|CC|- - to put it right offhand is.
1692303|CC|That's probably is the - -
1692304|CDR|Let's get it now. We can get the bag cleaned up. We can put it in bag 5.
1692305|CC|Roger. There's probably not very many convenient places to put it. That sounds like a good idea to me.
1692310|LMP|Okay. Let - let get me my scoop.
1692313|CDR|Get your scoop. Let's get it over with.
1692317|LMP|Say again, Bob. You want that - I don't have a scoop, I don't even have a rake.
1692325|CDR|They're both gone, huh?
1692326|LMP|Yes.
1692327|CDR|Use your - your Rover sampler.
1692330|LMP|Yes. They both fell off when that thing opened.
1692333|CDR|Yes.
1692334|CDR|Here's a full core tube we can't forget.
1692336|LMP|Yes, oh, that goes in the - -
1692339|CDR|Is there room for it?
1692340|LMP|Yes, why don't you get that scoop off, and I'll put it over here in 4. I mean in 7.
1692347|CDR|That was a good time to lose it. I'm glad we didn't lose it (laughter) any earlier. If we were going to lose it, that couldn't have been more ideal.
1692353|LMP|Yes. That's appropriate, I guess.
1692402|CDR|We got two - we've got two empty core tubes. Feel like we took a lot of them, though.
1692406|LMP|We'll get it. We'll use them, maybe.
1692408|CDR|Back here.
1692411|CC|Okay. We confirm that. Please go forward - -
1692412|LMP|Hey, I'm getting this ... - -
1692415|CC|- - and don't have to worry about bringing back, huh?
1692420|CDR|Here's your thing.
1692424|CDR|We're going to get this SESC now, and get it out of the way, Bob.
1692427|CC|Roger. We agree with that.
1692432|CDR|Okay.
1692435|LMP|Minus-Z, huh? You want it in front of the minus-Z footpad?
1692443|CC|Roger. Sort of underneath where you probably had the - -
1692445|LMP|Looks like a good place.
1692446|CC|- - solar side of the cosmic ray experiment there. Between the SES - between the footpad and the ALSEP doors there.
1692523|LMP|Full?
1692524|CDR|Oh, I've got about an inch to go.
1692527|LMP|Okay.
1692527|CDR|... me. Let's fill it up.
1692542|LMP|Looks good.
1692542|CC|Okay. And both you - your feedwaters are up, 17, so things look good.
1692550|CDR|Thank you.
1692554|CDR|Would you brush the - that white thing off for me?
1692601|LMP|Yes. Here, let me get - there, you got her.
1692624|CDR|Okay. Take a couple over here.
1692635|LMP|Let me go past the radar. Good job.
1692646|LMP|Bob, radar's built better. I'm on frame 96, and the short can sample - contaminated sample is documented by two stereopairs prior to that. And the before is the cosmic ray pictures.
1692708|CC|Copy that.
1692716|CC|Okay. And which SES - which SCB is that going in, Jack?
1692722|LMP|Number 5.
1692724|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1692726|LMP|Okay. The SCB's in - the SCB's in 5. That what you have?
1692730|CDR|Yes, short can in 5.
1692732|LMP|The ... short (laughter) SCB. Okay.
1692740|CC|Okay. And while you're doing that - -
1692741|CDR|Yes. He can ... your - let me get this - -
1692742|CC|- - remember, I want inventories of the stuff as it comes off the Rover and where you put it over there by the footpad, so we can help you keep track of it.
1692751|LMP|Okay. I've got the - we've got the big bag, bag 7,bag 5, bag 4 at the footpad.
1692809|CC|Copy that. We've also got SCB-3 with the Rover samples in it on the Rover, if there - if you have any - yes, you have some of those today.
1692817|LMP|No, we - we emp - we emptied those into 5.
1692820|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1692821|CDR|Okay, Bob. The gravimeter's on the surface. And you want a gravity reading and a bias reading, is that correct?
1692828|CC|Roger. We'll get the grav first.
1692835|CDR|Okay, Bob.
1692837|CDR|MARK it. Let's see, where am I?
1692839|CC|Copy that.
1692845|CDR|What did you do with the - -
1692846|LMP|Okay.
1692850|CDR|- - gravimeter - You've got another big rock over here from the - -
1692854|LMP|It's in my footpan.
1692855|CDR|That's from Station 9, right?
1692857|LMP|Yes.
1692858|CDR|That's what I told them. Station 9, I a football-size rock, and I've put it in there.
1692907|LMP|Well, we eventually lost one clamp. Let's see what we've got left on here.
1692925|LMP|Okay. Gene's football-sized rock looks like it might be glass coated. And it might even have a shatter cone or two on it.
1692938|CC|Okay, Jack.
1692942|CDR|Okay. I'll let you get - -
1692943|LMP|I don't know what you're focused on - -
1692945|CC|And - -
1692945|LMP|- - but here's his rock.
1692946|CC|- - and, Jack, we're making plans here, to change the camera usage at the end of EVA here. And we're going to let you take commander's camera out to the ALSEP and take a few photos that people think we need. And Gene's going to take your camera out and document the geophone. When he deploys it, we will not deploy it for the longterm experiment, however. And we'll bring both back, and carry them to the ETB when we get done.
1693019|LMP|Okay.
1693024|CDR|Okay. We've got to reverse the rolls of the camera here.
1693027|LMP|While you're getting that, we've got to doff our harnesses. Let me - before you take this - -
1693031|CDR|Are you going to start loading the ETB yet or not?
1693033|LMP|Well, I'm just about there.
1693035|CDR|Okay. I'll be right with you.
1693151|CDR|Okay, Bob. I've got the cosmic ray in the ETB.
1693158|CC|Roger. Copy that. It's been in there all along, hasn't it?
1693203|CDR|Yes.
1693205|LMP|Mag Foxtrot, or Franny, I guess, we changed it to, Mag Donna, the DSEA. Mag Echo. Mag Linda. Mag Mary.
1693303|CDR|Are you through with the 500?
1693306|CC|Roger. We're through with the 500.
1693313|CDR|Jack, where is the cosmic ray? Did you put that in the ETB already?
1693315|LMP|Yes.
1693316|CDR|Okay.
1693323|LMP|I don't think the 500's working anymore, anyway.
1693326|CDR|It was working ... - -
1693326|LMP|There it is.
1693326|CDR|- - I used it.
1693327|LMP|There it is. Okay. Film cycle. Three times.
1693352|LMP|... wait a minute ... Okay. Okay. In go the scissors.
1693420|CDR|Okay. I'm going to go get a gravimeter reading.
1693430|LMP|Now, let's see. ... There it is.
1693453|LMP|Okay. Mag Karen is in.
1693500|CC|Copy that. That sounds like all of them to us.
1693506|LMP|Okay. And there are two on the cameras.
1693509|CC|Roger.
1693513|CDR|Bob, I'm reading 670, 010, 701; 670, 010, 701.
1693521|CC|Okay. Copy that. We're ready for a bias, Gene.
1693526|CDR|Okay.
1693540|CDR|Bias, and it is flashing.
1693542|CC|Roger. Mark that.
1693552|LMP|Okay. Let me take a look around.
1693556|CDR|Jack?
1693556|LMP|Yes.
1693559|CDR|Was that bag in there?
1693601|LMP|Yes. It's over here on the MESA.
1693603|CDR|Okay.
1693612|LMP|Oh. Let's get rid of these tool harnesses We don't need those anymore.
1693618|CC|Yes. That's affirm.
1693620|CDR|Is your - You've come loose on the - you've come loose on the right.
1693625|LMP|Yes. Take a picture for you.
1693627|CC|Let me know when they come off, guys. Don't, get them tangled up in the hoses. Stand still ... - -
1693634|CDR|Let me pull it off for you. ...
1693635|CC|- - stand still ... untangle it.
1693642|CDR|Yes. Okay. Turn this way.
1693652|LMP|Now get the other side.
1693658|LMP|Okay. That's off.
1693702|CDR|Came off, huh?
1693703|LMP|Yes.
1693703|CDR|You don't have to get it around those hoses and everything? See if you can do it.
1693709|CC|Works a lot better than the simulations, doesn't it?
1693711|CDR|They won't find the other one. Stand by.
1693716|CDR|That's your only fallacy. They're not even watching this. Come over here and watch me, Ed. Oh, me. Let me have it.
1693726|LMP|Wait a minute. Move over that way. He - he can't - Okay. ... - -
1693730|CDR|Did you see me?
1693731|LMP|- - see if it comes off.
1693732|CDR|Nod your camera if you can see me.
1693734|CC|Roger. We can see you.
1693735|LMP|It's taking too long. Just take it off. is it off? ... - -
1693740|CC|That's - that's - that is almost ... at the Cape. Roger.
1693744|CDR|Jack, wait - wait - wait a minute before you - Hey, Bob, are we going to need those other core tubes?
1693750|CC|We'd like to have you leave the two core tubes and the extension handle and the hammer and I suppose the core cap dispenser here. If we get back in time from doing all our appointed tasks at the VIP site and at the ALSEP, we'll try and drive a double core here to end things up with a bang.
1693808|CDR|Don't leave it - don't - don't leave it there. Do it. No, don't leave it there.
1693811|LMP|Oh, I'm sorry. I'll leave it here. You got it.
1693813|CDR|We'll play games with the extension handle, but that's all right.
1693816|LMP|Okay. Let me set them over here. Where am I? Okay. Big bag, all those - -
1693829|CC|17, did you guys lose your - -
1693829|LMP|Don't need the LRV sampler any more.
1693831|CC|- - extension handles when that pallet came open?
1693836|CDR|Yes, but we can - I can still drive a core with the hammer if we need to.
1693840|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1693842|CDR|I think.
1693846|LMP|Yes. One went with the rake, and one went with the scoop. Okay, Bob. As I read down that page, it looks like we got it. The ETB check, I think we had four mags in there, and the DSEA, and the maps, and the cosmic ray.
1693907|CC|Roger. You've got six mags.
1693907|CDR|... and -
1693908|LMP|I guess I'm ready to go to the - -
1693910|CDR|Wait a minute. I want you to do something.
1693913|CC|Okay. One - -
1693914|LMP|Six mags, is it?
1693915|CC|- - one further question.
1693915|LMP|You want these - We don't have - -
1693917|CC|- - Did all the FSRs get off the Rover into the big bag?
1693923|LMP|That's affirm.
1693925|CDR|Yes, ... more than you need anyway. That's color. Why don't you see if you can grab a couple? Yes, right here.
1693942|LMP|Boy, are you dirty.
1693942|CDR|I know it.
1693945|LMP|Let's see. I don't know whether I can get to you.
1693949|CDR|Yes, you can.
1693954|LMP|Ed, you've got your camera in the way.
1693956|CDR|Oh, just take them straight on. That's all right.
1693959|LMP|That's sort of - ... Okay. (Laughter) Such - such a pose. Let me get a little different - focus. That looks good.
1694017|CDR|Hey.
1694018|LMP|Try one more over here. Have your pick.
1694022|CDR|One - one more.
1694023|LMP|How's like this?
1694026|CDR|Okay. (Laughter) You got that camera. That's the color camera.
1694030|LMP|Yes.
1694030|CDR|You take it.
1694031|CC|Okay - -
1694031|LMP|I've got to go get a new neutron flux probe, I guess.
1694034|CC|That's right.
1694034|CDR|Oh, yes. That's going to be easy to pull out.
1694037|LMP|Okay.
1694038|CDR|Okay. Let's see if I've got everything in here.
1694040|CC|Okay. And - -
1694040|LMP|You ready for me to go to the ALSEP?
1694044|CDR|Jack -
1694044|CC|Roger. We're ready for both of you guys, now.
1694047|LMP|Bob?
1694049|CC|Roger. Go ahead.
1694051|LMP|Hello, Houston.
1694052|CC|Hello, 17. Stand by. I think we're having a slight handover or something.
1694058|LMP|Houston, do you read? Gene, do you read me?
1694103|CDR|Yes, I read you.
1694104|CC|Okay, 17. We had a - -
1694105|LMP|... Well, I don't know ...
1694107|CC|- - slight bit of trouble there, and we've got you again.
1694114|LMP|Are you ready for me to go to the ALSEP?
1694117|CC|Roger. We're ready for both of you guys, now.
1694123|LMP|What do you mean? I'm headed for the ALSEP.
1694135|CC|Gene, are you ready for Jack to go to the ALSEP, now?
1694137|CDR|Let me see. Yes, he's gone. He's good. I'm ready to get out, and go to the VIP site. Wait a minute, Jack. Wait a minute, here. Wait a minute. Where are you?
1694152|CC|Yes. We're trying to - -
1694152|LMP|Right over here.
1694153|CDR|Come on back here a minute.
1694153|CC|- - we're trying to be subtle there, guys.
1694155|CDR|Come on back here a minute. Come on back here a minute. I didn't realize you were going out there quite so soon.
1694202|LMP|Well, I just looked to see where it is.
1694208|LMP|There. I'll - -
1694210|CDR|What did you - what did you do with that -
1694213|LMP|How about one of - how about this one?
1694214|CDR|You got it?
1694230|CDR|What was it happened to that one in my footpan?
1694234|LMP|I put in the (laughter) big bag.
1694236|CDR|Okay. Here we go, Jack. I - Here's one here. Here. All right?
1694245|LMP|Yes. Let me - let me get it, so you won't get it too dirty.
1694248|CDR|Okay. (Laughter) Very good.
1694253|LMP|You hold it.
1694254|CDR|Okay. Got it?
1694256|LMP|Yes. How about over here?
1694304|CDR|I'll put it right over here aginst that back - background.
1694315|CDR|Houston, before we close out our EVA, we understand that there are young people in Houston today, who have been effectively touring our country, young people from countries all over the world, respectively, touring our country. They had the opportunity to watch the launch of Apollo 17, hopefully had an opportunity to meet some of our young people in our country. And we'd like to say first of all, welcome, and we hope you enjoyed your stay. Second of all, I think probably one of the most significant things we can think about when we think about Apollo is that it has opened for us - for us being the world - a challenge of the future. The door is now cracked, but the promise of the future lies in the young people, not just in America, but the young people all over the world learning to live and learning to work together. In order to remind all the peoples of the world, in so many countries throughout the world, that this is what we all are striving for in the future, Jack has picked up a very significant rock, typical of what we have here in the valley of Taurus-Littrow, it's a rock composed of many fragments, of many sizes, and many shapes, probably from all parts of the Moon, perhaps billions of years old. But a rock of all fra - sizes and shapes, fragments of all sizes and shapes, and even colors that have grown together to become a cohesive rock, outlasting the nature of space, sort of living together in a very coherent, very peaceful manner. When we return this rock or some of the others like it to Houston, we'd like to share a piece of this rock with so many of the countries throughout the world. We hope that this will be a symbol of what our feelings are, what the feelings of the Apollo Program are, and a symbol of mankind that we can live in peace and harmony in the future.
1694555|LMP|A portion of a - of a rock will be sent to a - a representative agency or museum in each of the countries represented by the young people in Houston today, and we hope that they will, that rock and the students themselves, will carry with them our good wishes, not only for the new year coming up but also for themselves, their countries, and all mankind in the future. Put that in the big bag, Geno.
1694628|CDR|In the big bag.
1694630|CC|Roger - -
1694631|CDR|We salute you, promise of the future.
1694631|CC|- - Jack and Gene. We thank you for your sentiments and your interest.
1694650|CDR|And now, let me bring this camera around. To commemorate not just Apollo 17's visit to the Valley of Taurus-Littrow but as an everlasting commemoration of what the real meaning of Apollo is to the world, we'd like to uncover a plaque that has been on the leg of our spacecraft that we have climbed down many times over the last 3 days. And I'll read what that plaque says to you. First of all, it has a picture of the world. Two pictures, one of the North America and one of South America. The other covers the other half of the world including Africa, Asia, Europe, Australia, covers the North Pole and the South Pole. In between these two hemispheres, we have a pictorial view of the Moon, a pictorial view of where all the Apollo landings have been made so that when this plaque is seen again by others who come, they will know where it all started. The words are, "Here man completed his first exploration of the Moon, December 1972 A.D. May the spirit of peace in which we came be reflected in the lives of all mankind." it's signed, "Eugene A. Cernan, Ronald E. Evans, Harrison H. Schmitt, and most prominently, Richard M. Nixon, President of the United States of America." This is our commemoration that will be here until someone like us, until some of you who are out there, who are the promise of the future, come back to read it again and to further the exploration and the meaning of Apollo.
1694907|CC|Roger, Gene. We in Houston copy that and echo your sentiments, and Dr. Fletcher is here beside me. He'd like to say a word to the two of you.
1694918|CC|Gene and Jack, I've been in close touch with the White House, and the President has been following very closely your absolutely fascinating work up there. He'd like to wish you Godspeed as you return to Earth, and I'd like to personally second that. Congratulations. We'll see you in a few days. Over.
1694944|CDR|Thank you, Dr. Fletcher. We appreciate your comments, and we certainly appreciate those of the President. And whether it be civilian or military, I think Jack and I would both like to give our salute to America.
1695003|LMP|And, Dr. Fletcher, if I may, I'd like to remind everybody, I'm sure, of something they're aware, but this valley, this valley of history, has seen mankind complete its first evolutionary steps into the universe, leaving the planet Earth and going forward into the universe. I think no more significant contribution has Apollo made to history. It's not often that you can foretell history, but I think we can in this case. And I think everybody ought to feel very proud of that fact. Thank you very much.
1695053|CC|We'll see you in a little bit.
1695054|CDR|Okay, babe. Let's go to the AL - Okay, Bob. I owe you a - a bias reading.
1695101|CC|Okay. Or you can get it later. There's no hurry on that. And we're off to the ALSEP.
1695106|CDR|I'm going to give it to you right now.
1695108|CC|Okay. Ready to copy. I presume you've a UHT out at the ALSEP, Jack.
1695113|LMP|That's affirm.
1695115|CDR|337, 417, 101; 337, 417, 101.
1695125|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1695129|CDR|Are you through with this?
1695135|CC|Roger. (Laughter)
1695137|CDR|Bob?
1695138|CC|Roger. We're through with it.
1695140|LMP|Be kind. Be kind.
1695142|CDR|Well, I love it, and I'm sure it did a good job - -
1695144|CC|Well, we're not through with you, Gene, so don't throw yourself too far.
1695150|CDR|No, sir. I just don't want to hit old Challenger there.
1695203|LMP|That was unkind. You did the javelin. That was unkind.
1695210|CC|Roger, Gene. And we - -
1695211|CDR|I didn't throw it as far as I could have. I just - -
1695213|CC|- - we timed the parabola for that, and we have one excellent measurement of g on the Moon now.
1695222|CDR|Yes, I didn't get you a - I didn't get you a pendulum, but I don't know where I would, Bob. Okay. I'm going to have to take you out to the VIP site --
1695233|CC|Okay. We're ready for that, and we'll - -
1695234|CDR|- - if you concur?
1695236|CC|Okay.
1695248|CDR|Well, let me make sure I got everything. Okay. Remember, we -
1695303|PAO|We won't have a picture while Gene Cernan drives the Rover to the VIP site, the Very Important Place where the Rover will be left. He will turn the television back on after reaching that site.
1695315|CDR|Okay. Bob, I guess you're reading me through the LM, huh?
1695318|CC|Roger. Read you through the LM. You guys both read me through the LM?
1695324|CDR|That's affirm. Okay. The first thing I want to do - Tell John I'm going to do it exactly like he wants. Okay. The camera is under the seat, I hope. Let me look. Yes, camera's there. Jack, did you do something with the dustbrush?
1695352|LMP|No.
1695353|CDR|It was under the seat, right?
1695355|LMP|It was, yes.
1695356|CDR|Yes, I want to make sure it is because I'll need it out there.
1695358|LMP|No, wait a minute. I don't know that it's there now.
1695400|CDR|Well, I want to make sure that I can get - get something to dust with.
1695406|CC|Okay. And, Jack, as you go out to the ALSEP, let me cue in on your next 3 hours worth of work out there, repairing the ALSEP. All right? Over.
1695416|LMP|Oh, okay. Go ahead. I'm here.
1695418|CC|Okay. Number one, we want to retrieve the UHT. And I quote, "tap sharply" - that's "sharply" on the gimbal, which is the center section there, the little square metal piece in the middle - tap sharply on the gimbal with the UHT, and then re-verify the level on the LSG. We'll check response here in Mission Control after you've done that.
1695449|LMP|You mean tap on the thing that swings?
1695452|CC|That's what they say.
1695453|CDR|You always wanted to do that, didn't you?
1695455|CC|Yes, that's right.
1695501|LMP|Well, let me see if I can grab a clean UHT to do that.
1695507|CDR|Okay, Bob. Everything is zeroed.
1695509|CC|Okay. And I'll be talking to Jack here, Gene, for a while. You can interrupt with your comments over - talking over me, and I'll try and copy them.
1695521|CDR|One comment. I got a flag on the other battery, 139 degrees.
1695524|CC|Okay. We copy that.
1695527|LMP|How much - how much is sharply?
1695531|CC|Sharply is sharply. It's probably not heavily, but sharply. Fairly light, but sharply.
1695537|LMP|On the edge?
1695539|CC|No. You can see that little square metal piece in the middle there?
1695542|LMP|On the edge?
1695542|CC|You see that little square metal piece on there? You can just sort of rap on that - -
1695544|LMP|Oh, yes. Okay. Here goes. I did it.
1695554|CC|Okay. And then it says - -
1695556|LMP|You want me to do it again?
1695559|CC|Stand by.
1695604|LMP|That was sort of a med - moderate hard tap.
1695610|CC|Go ahead, and hit it harder.
1695611|LMP|It is level.
1695612|CC|Hit it harder, please.
1695616|LMP|Okay. Okay. I can hit it harder yet.
1695629|CC|Okay. We've observed something there. Stand by.
1695640|CDR|Bob, you might be getting TV the way the antenna's oriented right now.
1695643|CC|Okay. Jack, go ahead. We'll do some more stuff here. In the meanwhile, while they're thinking about what's wrong with it, did you just tap it again?
1695657|LMP|No, I didn't touch it. I'm over at the central station now.
1695700|CC|Okay. They're looking at it. All right. Now, we want to take some photographs at the central station and a few selected - a few selected photographs of the ALSEP. Number one, we want a 7-foot cross-Sun to the south of the ALSEP central station and then a 7-foot down-Sun of the central station. Over.
1695723|LMP|Okay, 7-foot cross-Sun to the south.
1695726|CC|That's what it says.
1695730|LMP|And then a down-Sun.
1695732|CC|Roger. A 7-foot down-Sun.
1695737|LMP|You might tell me what they're trying to get with it. I might be able to help them.
1695742|CC|Okay. I presume that what this means is looking to the south. It was cross-Sun originally. I suspect that's what happened here, the way it was written up. So it's a 7-foot looking at the - all the switches to make sure you guys turned them the right way, I suppose. And then a 7-foot looking down-Sun, so that would be facing west, that side of it.
1695804|LMP|Okay. I got it. What else?
1695807|CC|Okay. Now, there's a problem with the central station - which they think the south end of it's buried more deeply in the dirt than they had intended. And the central station is at present time getting very warm on the back side on the south side there, which is - they believe you probably buried in the ground when you were trying to tilt it to the proper alignment. They are requesting that, when you're at the ALSEP, you remove any soil buildup or debris with a convenient tool. They don't want you to touch it because it's fairly warm. But if you have a UHT or something to move it - Do you have the UHT with you or something with you that you can brush that soil aside with?
1695846|LMP|Yes, sir.
1695847|CC|Okay. You know the secton - -
1695848|LMP|It is piled up there. That's a good call - -
1695850|CC|Yes. Okay. They'd like that brushed away. And you can give me a call - -
1695859|LMP|Fortunately, I brought my handy-dandy Rover sampler out.
1695903|CC|Okay. You can brush that aside, and give me a call when you think that's cleared up the way it ought to be. That's probably one of those things we didn't think about when we decided to tilt the central station.
1695915|LMP|Well, you didn't - you couldn't anticipate the soil, Bob. It's very soft.
1695928|CDR|Bob, we are at VIP.
1695931|CC|Okay. And Ed Fendell is hard on my back to remind you that it's better to be too far away than too close.
1695944|CDR|All right. I thought I was, but I think I may move just a little bit. There's a little rise here I can give you. I think I'll give it to you.
1695955|CC|Okay.
1695958|LMP|By the way, Bob, the soil gets more cohesive with depth. I hadn't really noticed that before.
1700005|CC|Okay. We copy that. Duely noted.
1700008|LMP|It's - it's quite a bit more cohesive at - about the - feels about the same down to 3 centimeters out here, and then the cohesiveness goes up, so it's difficult to scrape with the Rcver sampler.
1700023|CC|Copy that, Jack.
1700051|CDR|Well, I think you can see almost everything from here.
1700054|CC|Okay, Geno. And, Jack, let me know when you get done scraping that soil away.
1700103|LMP|I will.
1700123|CDR|And now comes the hardest alignment of them all, but I'll get it.
1700151|CDR|Somewhere about there. See if I can't tweak it up for you.
1700159|LMP|Bob, the east-west level bubble is not quite level. The north-south is. Do you want me to tweak that up?
1700207|CC|Yes, you might tweak that up. We are getting a good signal, but go ahead and tweak it up just a little bit.
1700223|CC|And, Gene, what are you doing these days?
1700227|CDR|I'm getting the high gain set up for you.
1700230|CC|Okay. Now you know why we didn't make you park it in that orientation all the time, don't you?
1700236|CDR|Boy, I'll tell you ... it was a piece of cake up until now.
1700244|CDR|There, I got you.
1700255|CDR|Bob, you got - Bob, you're looking right down the center of my eyepiece. You - -
1700303|CC|Okay, I don't think - -
1700303|CDR|- - you should have TV.
1700304|CC|Yes, we're getting TV there, Geno.
1700309|CDR|You getting it?
1700311|CC|We've got TV.
1700311|CDR|Well, let me take a look, and clean things up.
1700313|CC|Okay. I guess you can dust and dust and dust some more for a while.
1700321|CDR|let me get this dusting problem out of the way before I do anything else.
1700324|CC|Roger.
1700325|CDR|You can look at your vantage point, and if you don't like it, let me know.
1700329|CC|Okay. I'll call Captain Video.
1700344|LMP|Bob?
1700345|CC|Go.
1700345|LMP|How close can soil be to this back plate of the ALSEP?
1700351|CC|Stand by. I'll check.
1700356|LMP|It's about 30 centimeters away, most of the places now.
1700404|CC|Okay. That sounds good. We'd like you to return to the surface gravimeter, Jack. What you did had some effect, but not - not a lasting effect. And we'd like you to rap even more sharply, more strongly on the gimbal another three times. And we're again watching it, and we'll let you know what to do. And - I might tell you that this has all been done recently this afternoon up at Bendix on the qual unit, and it survived it and so we aren't in any real danger apparently of destroying it.
1700439|LMP|Okay. Three times, huh?
1700442|CC|Roger. Or up to three times.
1700542|LMP|Bob, don't let me forget to bring a dustbrush back when I come. ... - -
1700544|CC|Okay. I'll mark that down and remind you. And, Jack, you'll be glad to know that the temperature of the back plate there has already dropped 20 degrees - 20 degrees.
1700556|LMP|Oh, beautiful.
1700558|CDR|Bob, I don't think that bubble's working.
1700600|CC|O -
1700601|CDR|How's your signal now?
1700603|CC|Stand by. I'll check. But why don't you go to the - to the surface gravimeter?
1700611|LMP|Bob, how's your TV lens? I don't have a lens brush. It looks good from here. I don't want to use this unless you think so.
1700618|CC|Stand by.
1700619|LMP|Knock three times. (Singing)
1700622|CC|Roger. Get out of the way please, Jack, and we'll take a look against some bright soil.
1700630|CDR|What?
1700630|LMP|No, that's me he's talking to.
1700638|CC|Okay. It looks pretty good, Geno. Go ahead.
1700640|CDR|I ... with the lens brush.
1700641|CC|Yes, go ahead. It looks pretty good to us.
1700646|CDR|Okay.
1700647|LMP|Okay, Bob. Here come the raps. Knock three times. Okay.
1700715|CC|Okay, Jack. That's really fighting us pretty hard. We'd like you to put the UHT in the socket, and rock it very firmly. Don't pick it up, but rock it very firmly from side to side in all four directions about - Move the UHT about 6 inches in each direction while you're doing it.
1700738|LMP|Okay.
1700758|LMP|Okay, I rocked it. It's swinging.
1700808|CC|Okay. is it reading?
1700810|LMP|And the level bubble is - better.
1700832|CC|Okay. We understand it's in good configuration again as far as alignment and leveling is concerned, Jack. Let's go on and take some more ALSEP photos, and let them think about it for a minute.
1700844|LMP|Okay. What do you want?
1700846|CC|Okay. Next, what we want is some heat flow - Okay. We just got late word. They'd like to do it one more time, and then call it quits.
1700908|LMP|The rocking bit, huh?
1700910|CC|Roger. The walk - rocking bit one more time.
1700920|CDR|Bob, I may have moved the high gain. Do you see any change in signal?
1700924|CC|Stand by.
1700927|CDR|If you're happy, I won't touch it.
1700937|LMP|Okay, Bob. It's rocked. The shadow ... - the shade is aligned to the Sun now, and it's level.
1700949|CC|Okay. We copy that, and let's go get some ALSEP photos, Jack. I think you got some heat flow photos the other night, besides the two pans. If you did, we may - these may be redundant. They're - they want the cross-Sun and down-Sun of the east hole and cross-Sun and down-Sun of the west hole. And I'm not sure what you got those earlier. You said you got some extra heat flow, but tell me if you did. They're both - all four of these are 7-foot - -
1701020|LMP|... -
1701022|CC|Go ahead.
1701025|LMP|I'll get the heat flow pictures. They - One was 11-foot, I think. And then the steropair.
1701038|CC|Yes. I think all they're asking for is the two 7-foot stereopairs.
1701050|LMP|Okay. That's one of them.
1701058|CC|Okay. What they're asking for, Jack, is a 7-foot down-Sun and a 7-foot cross-Sun, which isn't quite what we've been taking in the past.
1701108|LMP|I'm getting the standard ones, Bob.
1701111|CC|Copy that.
1701117|LMP|Okay. You got the standard documentation.
1701120|CC|Okay - -
1701120|LMP|11-footers and 7-foot stereos.
1701122|CC|Okay. Go ahead. They can't complain about that, certainly.
1701129|LMP|Okay. Now what?
1701131|CC|Okay. We'd like a 3-foot shot of the lunar mass spectrometer, including the orifice where the breccia was. And, Geno, we are observing some degradation and would like to have the high gain - -
1701144|LMP|Cross-Sun?
1701147|CC|Yes, yes, Jack; 3-foot's cross-Sun. And, Gene; this is Houston. We'd like to get the high gain reoriented a little bit. We're observing some degradation in the picture.
1701158|CDR|I'll tweak it.
1701214|LMP|Okay. Got it. Now what? LMS is complete.
1701229|CC|Okay. Copy that. Now we want to go over the neutron flux, Jack.
1701235|LMP|Okay.
1701249|LMP|How's the gravimeter doing?
1701251|CC|We're looking at it, Jack. I'm not sure.
1701328|CDR|Hey, Bob. The panel you want covered. Yes, that's the panel. Okay. You want the - the panel with the - with the ON-OFF switch and the - and the signal strength switch and so forth covered, don't you?
1701346|CC|Roger. And be sure to get the thing to EXTERNAL before you cover it there, Gene.
1701353|CDR|Okay. That was going to be a question of mine.
1701355|CC|Okay. That goes to EXTERNAL.
1701357|CDR|Okay. It's EXTERNAL.
1701358|LMP|What - what do you want me to do with the neutron flux?
1701402|CC|Okay. We want a photograph facing south, for the 7-foot. So a 7-foot cross-Sun, essentially, of the neutron flux in the soil.
1701416|LMP|Okay. Would you like to have the RTG in that picture?
1701428|CC|Oh, I suppose if you're generous, you might take a partial pan around to the RTG.
1701443|LMP|Well, it's just about that direction. Okay. Now what?
1701452|CC|Okay. Now let's remove - remove the neutron pro - probe experiment from the ground, and turn it off.
1701503|LMP|Okay.
1701511|LMP|No more on the gravimeter, huh?
1701515|CC|No, the gravimeter is looking very bad, still. And, Jack, you might note as you withdraw just how difficult it is to withdraw it. It - it - whether or not it's been seiz-ed by the soil collapsing around it or not. That's soil mechanic's goody.
1701535|LMP|Not at all, not at all.
1701536|CDR|It won't be, I'll tell you. No problem.
1701538|CC|Okay. We copy that.
1701540|CDR|Okay. The high gain is - the high gain is tweaked.
1701544|CC|Okay. We'll consider ourselves tweaked.
1701550|CDR|And I'm giving the LCRU another zap here. Boy, I tell you, I ain't going to do much more dusting after I leave here. Ever ...
1701603|LMP|Okay. Upper probe is OFF -
1701604|LMP|MARK it.
1701606|CC|Copy that.
1701612|LMP|Okay, Bob. I'm going to put bus B and D, OPEN, and AUX circuit breaker BYPASS, ON.
1701621|CC|Okay. Copy that.
1701625|LMP|And let me see. Bravo. Okay. And Delta. Okay. Bravo and Delta. Upper probe is OFF -
1701642|LMP|MARK it.
1701643|CC|Is that upper or lower, Jack?
1701646|LMP|Up - oh, lower. I'm sorry, Bob.
1701648|CC|Copy that.
1701651|LMP|AUX POWER circuit breaker is ON. BYPASS, ON. And the lower probe is capped.
1701657|CC|Okay; and, Gene, you need to close that CAUTION AND WARNING FLAG. It's a heat sink when it's open, I guess.
1701706|CDR|Okay; it's closed.
1701708|CC|Copy that.
1701709|CDR|You want me to put a bag in front of that thing?
1701714|CC|No, I don't think - -
1701715|CDR|Want me to put a bag in front of it in case it pops open again? I guess it won't.
1701718|CC|No, I don't think so. I can't imagine why it's really a problem anyway, because we got the BYPASS, ON there, and that heat's not going anywhere.
1701726|LMP|Okay; now the switch is off, except my 15 volts. Bob, you want me away from the ALSEP now?
1701735|CC|Stand by, Jack. I'll get one more word before we come back to the LM.
1701743|LMP|Okay.
1701751|CDR|Yes, I got a camera, over there. I'm going to look under the seats one more time. Nothing but a 500 - Okay. Used tape.
1701805|CC|Okay. Jack, we're ready for you to leave the ALSEP.
1701812|LMP|Well, I hate to do that, Bob. I'm sorry about this gravimeter, though.
1701818|CC|Well, you're not the only one. The word is down here there's a whole room full of people who are sorry.
1701835|PAO|EVA time 6 hours 46 minutes.
1701911|CDR|Okay. I got the LMP's camera. Nothing in here but couple old bags. We used about all the bags we had, Jack. Not many here. Bob, I have the dust brush tethered.
1701951|CC|Copy the dust brush.
1701956|CDR|Okay; let me get one parting shot of - one of the finest running little machines I've ever had the pleasure to drive.
1702021|CC|Okay. And, Geno, some people down here are concerned about whether you've opened the battery covers or not.
1702028|CDR|Yes, sir; they're open.
1702030|CC|Roger. Copy that.
1702037|CDR|Oh, what a nice little machine. Parked on a little downslope, but at the heading you want, and I guess Ed's satisfied with the TV response, huh?
1702049|CC|Roger. We're satisfied with the TV, Gene. We're ready for you to take the EP number 3.
1702059|CDR|Good old Mother Earth is right smack in the center.
1702208|CDR|Bob, while we've got a quiet moment here, as I go to de - deploy that EP charge, I'd just like to say that any part of Apollo 17, or any part of Apollo, that has been a success thus far is probably, for the most part, due to the thousands of people in the aerospace industry who have given a great deal, besides dedication and besides effort and besides professionalism, to make it all a reality. And I would just like to thank them, because what we've done here and what has been done in the past - As a matter of fact, what has been done for 200 years, you've got to contribute to the spirit of a group of people who form the aerospace industry. And I God bless you and thank you.
1702316|CC|Roger, Gene. And we thank you guys.
1702323|CDR|Well, we're just two little - two little sets of twinkletoes here. There's a lot that goes to getting this Rover running out here that we don't have much to do with. And I guess there might be someone else that has something to do with it too, and I've been reading his signs, maybe not from Him directly, but His in spirit, as we run up and down that ladder. And that's Godspeed, the crew of Apollo 17. And if He's listening, I'd like to thank Him, too.
1702425|CDR|Pin 1 is pulled.
1702427|CC|MARK that.
1702432|CDR|I'm at the end of the west SEP antenna. Do you agree with that?
1702435|CC|Roger. Exactly right.
1702440|CDR|Okay. Pin 2 is pulled. Still safe. Pin 3 is pulled, and it still safe.
1702449|CC|Copy that, and - -
1702451|CDR|Don't know what I would do if it wasn't. (Laughter)
1702453|CC|- - and now, also, do you have the SEP transmitter turned off there, Gene?
1702459|CDR|No, sir. Thank you. Okay. Bob, - -
1702504|CC|Then we're ready for you guys to get back to the LM and dust, and get in.
1702505|CDR|- - it's getting ready - it's getting right adjacent to the ring on the west end, and I'm going to go back and turn the SEP cff.
1702518|CC|Okay. And when that's done, Gene, we're ready for you and your dust brush to hasten back to the LM and dust each other and climb in.
1702527|CDR|You know what, Bob?
1702529|CC|What, Gene?
1702529|CDR|Great as an experience as it has been, I'd say we're probably both ready.
1702537|LMP|Oh, I don't know. Hey, Bob, 55 Yankee is an exotic-looking rock I found about 5 meters south of the neutron flux hole. It's another gray - possibly gray basalt. It's just that there aren't many of them around here, and so I picked it up.
1702555|CC|Copy that.
1702559|LMP|Cheating a little again.
1702603|CDR|Jack, you'll always be picking rocks.
1702607|LMP|Oh, I don't know.
1702608|CDR|Okay, the transmitter is OFF.
1702611|CC|MARK that.
1702612|CDR|I don't blame you. There's so many interesting things around here.
1702626|LMP|Just don't lose your brush, Gene.
1702629|CDR|Okay, Bob, according to my inventory I'm going to return to the LM and the camera is going to the ETB.
1702637|CC|That's affirm. We'll have - -
1702639|CDR|... we're done with the TGE.
1702640|CC|Roger.
1702643|CC|We need a bias reading if you want to use it again, Gene.
1702644|CDR|Jack, come to think of it, I - come to think of it, I guess you are, aren't you. Where are you, Jack?
1702656|LMP|I'm at the MESA.
1702658|CDR|Okay.
1702701|LMP|Trying to snap a snap.
1702702|CDR|I need a locater here to the LM.
1702718|CC|Okay; and, 17, we need you guys in the LM in 15 minutes, 15 minutes because of oxygen constraints.
1702729|CDR|Okay, Bob, my pictures are taken; I'm on the way. Oh, Boy, where else can you do this?
1702842|CDR|If I had landed 30 meters back, Jack, we'd be pitched down 5 degrees.
1702851|LMP|You're right.
1702855|CDR|Okay, what they're saying is, I don't need my hammer any more.
1702859|CC|Roger -
1702859|CDR|... dust and get in.
1702859|CC|- we want you to dust and get in. We got 14 minutes remaining before we need the hatch closed.
1702911|CDR|Okay, Bob. We'll - we're doing our best. Well, that RTV worked on the hammer, but look at it, Jack. It's worn completely to a nub. It's off.
1702936|LMP|I guess that's all right - Look at - Here - my - I don't know where I am. Oh, boy, how about that? Okay.
1702945|CDR|Okay, sir, you ready to go on up?
1702948|LMP|Well, I don't know. Got to take my camera off. I got another batch of pictures - the LM and the flag and - -
1702956|CDR|Well, watch this real quick.
1702957|LMP|Stereo, even.
1702958|CDR|Jack - -
1702959|LMP|Let me have your camera. Go ahead. Oh, there ... there. Let me throw the hammer.
1703003|CDR|Okay.
1703004|LMP|Let me throw the hammer, please.
1703006|CDR|It's all yours.
1703007|LMP|You got the gravimeter.
1703008|CDR|You deserve it. A hammer thrower - you're a geologist. You ought to be able to throw it.
1703011|LMP|You ready?
1703012|CDR|Go ahead.
1703013|LMP|You ready for this? Ready for this?
1703015|CDR|Yes. Don't hit the LM or the ALSEP.
1703022|LMP|Look at that! Look at that! Look at that! Beautiful.
1703029|CDR|Looked like it was going a million miles, but it really didn't.
1703032|LMP|Didn't it?
1703033|CDR|Okay, here, this is an ETB.
1703035|LMP|Let me - let me make sure that that's all cinched up.
1703038|CDR|Okay. And then start on up. We got to get going here.
1703043|LMP|Yes. Unfortunately, their little plan didn't count for the fact that it's hard to pack the ETB with the film magazines in it.
1703049|CDR|And I'll try and get the big bag here cinched up.
1703054|LMP|That is a major task.
1703055|CDR|Yes, that's going to be - oh, is it heavy. Is it heavy. Something in that core tube you put in there?
1703101|LMP|Yes, sir.
1703102|CDR|Okay.
1703103|LMP|Don't tell anybody, though, because they'll get mad at me.
1703105|CDR|Oh, man, is that heavy. Holy smoley. Oh!
1703119|LMP|... 252. That's about three-quarters of a core, hand pushed, half a meter inside the plus-Y footpad.
1703140|CC|Okay, copy that.
1703145|CDR|Okay, Jack ... how's that ETB coming no you can get going?
1703148|LMP|Fine.
1703149|CDR|Okay, I've got to - -
1703149|LMP|I've got to put it on a strap, though.
1703153|CDR|I can get that. You can - This is all cinched up. I think it'll hold. Why don't you start on up? Then I'll start dusting you.
1703204|LMP|Okay.
1703208|CDR|Okay. Very good.
1703211|LMP|Anything fall out?
1703212|CDR|No.
1703213|LMP|Okay. Oh - -
1703215|CDR|Let me dust you. Set that down, and I'll hand it all to you.
1703216|LMP|Okay, you'll have to hand stuff in - -
1703217|CC|Okay; and, 17, we - a reminder, we need you inside in 10 minutes.
1703224|CDR|Okay, Bob. ...
1703235|PAO|EVA time 7 hours.
1703241|LMP|I'll do a lot of jumping up here in a minute.
1703242|CDR|Your back is clean.
1703246|LMP|I'll get the legs as best I can.
1703247|CDR|Okay. Why don't you get me here before you do that?
1703248|LMP|Okay. And while I'm doing that, will you take this - I'll get it.
1703255|CDR|Okay.
1703301|LMP|Boy, you got dirty today. I think we're just going to have to live with it.
1703314|CDR|Get my top. I can kick a lot of that stuff off my legs. How do I look in back?
1703323|LMP|Terrible. Okay, turn.
1703347|LMP|Oh, man. You're going to have to - Your legs are really filthy. Not much to do about it.
1703352|CDR|Okay, I'll get them off. Why don't you start back - -
1703353|LMP|Just kick them against each other ... - -
1703355|CDR|Okay. Start on up.
1703359|LMP|You might shake the bags.
1703401|CDR|Okay.
1703402|CC|And don't forget your PLSS ant.
1703407|LMP|No.
1703409|CDR|Do what?
1703410|LMP|PLSS antennas.
1703411|CDR|Okay.
1703412|LMP|Although it doesn't make much difference anymore. That's to get them out of the way.
1703418|CDR|The big bag didn't stay closed very long.
1703421|LMP|I don't know how we can get that in.
1703423|CDR|There, I'll stand - I can hand it to you.
1703426|LMP|It never had a very good closure on it - -
1703429|CDR|That velcro won't hold.
1703431|LMP|- - but it can be closed.
1703432|CDR|I had it over - over the top. The latch was closed, but -
1703436|LMP|Oh, it won't hold with all that weight in there. Okay, I got your antenna.
1703439|CDR|Okay, let me get a high - Got to close this. You don't want that in your way.
1703445|LMP|I can't close it.
1703447|CDR|Oh, okay.
1703450|LMP|You might try.
1703456|CDR|Get all your flaps? Okay, hold your head down.
1703512|CDR|Yow.
1703513|LMP|Won't go, huh?
1703513|CDR|No. Will that bother you getting in?
1703516|LMP|I can probably make it.
1703517|CDR|Okay, get on up.
1703522|LMP|Oops, try that again. Okay, why don't you hand me the neutron flux, and I'll put it - -
1703531|CDR|Okay, neutron flux.
1703532|LMP|- - on the platform? Okay.
1703539|CDR|Why don't you start in, and I'll get some of these bags out of the way.
1703541|LMP|Well, I just - You don't want to hand them to me up here?
1703550|CDR|Okay.
1703553|CC|And, Jack, for your thoughts, we've agreed that you can delete the tracking light. We'd like to get you guys in as soon as possible - 7 minutes now. And we'll delete the tracking light test.
1703603|LMP|Okay.
1703607|CDR|Okay, Bob.
1703621|LMP|Okay, that's all I can handle up here. One more - one more and I can put it up here.
1703627|CDR|Watch your cover on this one. Got it?
1703632|LMP|Got it.
1703633|CDR|Stand it up because the cover won't hack it.
1703655|CDR|Okay. If you get on in, I'll come up to the porch.
1703742|LMP|Where's that EVA pallet that's always in my way?
1703746|CC|I think we aren't going to have one of those tomorrow, Jack, so we did away with that. We hope we're not going to have one of those tomorrow.
1703755|CDR|Bob, we're maximizing our efforts, so just bear with us. Jack's going to be in about 30 seconds, and I'm on the ladder hauling some stuff up now.
1703810|CC|Roger. Don't panic.
1703815|CDR|Well, we're not. I just don't want you to.
1703819|CC|I never panic there, guys.
1703828|LMP|Got some stuff for me?
1703830|CDR|Yes, sir. This is not the time to rush. It's the time to do it nice and slow and right.
1703839|LMP|Oh, we're all right.
1703840|CDR|Okay. You're not going to like this, but I'm going to give you this one first because I've got it in my hand.
1703852|LMP|Either one. Oh, hang in there - I've got it. Yes, that's a heavy bag.
1703907|CDR|That is heavy, babe. Let me tell you, that's heavy.
1703920|LMP|Okay, next.
1703923|CDR|Can you reach that one? If not, I'll shove it in further.
1703936|LMP|Okay.
1703937|CDR|One more coming at you.
1703938|LMP|Okay.
1703938|CDR|Tilting up right now.

1703953|LMP|Okay, next.
1703955|CDR|...
1703956|LMP|Got it.
1703957|CDR|Okay. Okay, next. Okay, Bob, we've got it - -
1704006|LMP|Up here -
1704007|CDR|- - big bag, three SRCs and a neutron flux.
1704012|CC|Okay, and we gather an ETB coming up with two cameras in it.
1704018|CDR|ETB's next.
1704029|LMP|You have an ETB? Ya -
1704032|CDR|ETB has two cameras.
1704034|CC|Okay. And as you guys say farewell to the Moon, we're looking up to the Earth down here where you guys are returning pretty soon.
1704044|CDR|Okay.
1704045|LMP|You're going to have to push that.
1704046|CDR|Okay, let me get it. That's all right - I'll wait until you're ready. Okay. Can you make it?
1704056|LMP|Yes, I've got it. Okay, let me get that other thing in here.
1704117|CDR|Bob, this is Gene, and I'm on the surface and as I take man's last steps from the surface, back home, for some time to come, but we believe not too long into the future. I'd like to just let, what I believe history will record, that America's challenge of today has forged man's destiny of tomorrow. And, as we leave the Moon at Taurus-Littrow, we leave as we came and, God willing, as we shall return, with peace and hope for all mankind. Godspeed the crew of Apollo 17.
1704212|CC|Roger, Geno. Thank you very much.
1704217|CDR|Bob, I am up on the ladder and I'm going to be going through the hatch.
1704235|LMP|Gene, I've got to get out of your way.
1704237|CDR|Yes.
1704304|LMP|Okay.
1704306|CDR|Okay, let me - Okay, babe - here I come.
1704313|LMP|Come on in.

1704315|LMP|Still looks dirty. Okay, keep her down - buttons. Come towards me a little - there you go. Okay, you've got it.
1704340|CDR|Okay, I'm inside the hatch.
1704343|LMP|Okay.
1704344|CDR|Let me look - let me see that hatch once more.
1704346|LMP|Okay.
1704348|CDR|That's the last time we want to have to - open that.
1704352|LMP|Caught in the same way again.
1704354|CDR|Let me just - I can see down there.
1704356|LMP|I can see, it's -
1704357|CDR|Does it look good to you?
1704358|LMP|It's clear -
1704359|CDR|Okay.
1704401|LMP|There is a little bit of dust but it's all in the - I don't think ...
1704405|CDR|Roger.
1704408|LMP|There you go.
1704409|CDR|If I can turn around.
1704410|LMP|Yes, I've got to get out of your way.
1704411|CDR|Yes, I'll wait for you.
1704430|CDR|Yes, now I can.
1704432|LMP|Okay.
1704433|LMP|Okay, I've got to get my hand over here. Okay, I'm out of your way.
1704439|CDR|Okay. And -
1704445|LMP|Close the hatch.
1704446|CDR|Hatch is closed. Let's see if I can lock it.
1704450|LMP|Then we've got to turn our H2O off. Oh, we've got to turn our - let's turn our water off first, before you lock it.
1704459|CDR|Well, it's locked now. Can you get your own water? If not, I'll get it - -
1704502|LMP|I doubt it. Haven't been able to before.
1704507|CDR|Okay, I'll get it.
1704508|LMP|Have you got your -
1704509|CDR|Let me see.
1704517|LMP|Mine's off. No, wait a minute. Mine's off. Well, I can't get it.
1704527|CDR|Okay. I'll get it for you. And - before you move any more, let me get over here out of the way.
1704533|CC|Okay. And pay attention here, 17, when you come on, we'd like you to leave PRESS REG A which is the one that's in OFF - we'd like to leave that closed.
1704541|CDR|Turn around.
1704542|CC|Just use PRESS REG B going to CABIN.
1704544|CDR|Okay, Bob.
1704547|LMP|Get it, Gene?
1704547|CDR|Turn some more, I can almost reach it - another.
1704550|LMP|Okay.
1704554|CDR|Okay. Your AUX water is OFF.
1704556|LMP|Okay.
1704557|CDR|Okay, Bob -
1704558|LMP|No, no. The - the PRIM water.
1704600|CDR|Okay.
1704602|LMP|Turn your PRIM ...
1704609|CDR|Your PRIM water is OFF.
1704610|LMP|Is your PRIM OFF?
1704613|CDR|Yes. It's OFF.
1704615|LMP|Okay.
1704617|CDR|Okay. PLSS PRIM water closed. Forward hatch CLOSED and LOCKED. Okay, I've got to get the upper valve, Jack. Move in.
1704625|LMP|Okay. How's that?
1704630|CDR|Oh, that ought to do it.
1704641|CDR|AUTO and I've got the lock on it. Okay, now, Bob, say again which REG A you want left.
1704651|LMP|REG A left closed, I got it.
1704654|CC|That's affirm, Jack.
1704656|LMP|Go ahead.
1704657|CDR|Okay, DUMP valves are both AUTO - CABIN REPRESS AUTO.
1704700|LMP|CABIN REPRESS, AUTO.
1704702|CDR|Okay, and I've got plenty of oxygen so we're in good shape for an AUTO REPRESS. CABIN REPRESS breaker CLOSED at 16.
1704708|LMP|Okay, CABIN REPRESS, CLOSED.
1704712|CDR|Come on, baby, there it comes. Half a psi. Okay, it is increasing - you can go to CABIN on the regulator.
1704725|LMP|REG B.
1704727|CDR|Yes, just the one regulator B. 1.5.
1704735|LMP|REG B is in CABIN.
1704736|CDR|Okay, she's coming up. There's 2.0. Your next move will be to get PLSS O2 OFF. 2.5. Okay, get your PLSS O2 OFF.
1704804|LMP|Mine's OFF.
1704806|CDR|Get it?
1704807|LMP|... shortly.
1704812|CDR|Turn around - I'll get it for you.
1704814|LMP|I think that I've got it. There I got it.
1704819|CDR|Okay. Verify cabin pressure stable at 4.6 to 5.0. We'll watch it here.
1704824|LMP|I'm watching; 5.
1704828|PAO|EVA ended at 170 hours 48 minutes 8 seconds. EVA duration, 7 hours 15 minutes 31 seconds.
1704828|CDR|Okay. 5.0.
1704830|LMP|5.0.
1704831|CDR|Boy, it got hot in here, didn't it? Okay, purge valve to DEPRESS; verify your circuit breakers.
1704837|LMP|Say again, that last one.
1704839|CDR|You don't need your ... DEPRESS but you don't need it.
1704841|LMP|Oh, yes. No, No.
1704842|CDR|Verify your circuit breakers - White Dots -... EVA decals.
1704846|LMP|The White Dots.
1704858|CDR|Okay, I'm squared away there. Squared away?
1704905|LMP|Am I.
1704906|CDR|Okay.
1704907|LMP|Looks good.
1704908|CDR|Stay at 16 now, ECS SUIT FAN 2, CLOSED?
1704911|LMP|SUIT FAN 2 is CLOSED.
1704912|CDR|SUIT FAN DELTA-P, CLOSED.
1704913|LMP|CLOSED.
1704914|CDR|Caution lights are on, that's good. Until the SEP - wait, ECS caution can still go out when it winds up.
1704923|CDR|Doff gloves, stow on comm panel. Oh, oh. Sweet music to my ears.
1704929|LMP|Have to put them on again, in a few minutes.
1704931|CDR|I know, it's still sweet music.
1704934|LMP|Come on, now.
1704937|CDR|I have never seen so much dirt and dust in my whole life. Ever. Ron's not going to be able to see out of either one of these helmet visors.
1704950|LMP|(Laughter) Yes he will.
1704953|CDR|But they sure do get scratched, if you're not careful. Okay. Hey, it's harder getting them off ... than it is getting them on.
1705038|LMP|Ah, I did it. Patience. Maximum effort. There's one. Okay, helm - gloves are off.
1705108|CDR|My gloves are off.
1705110|LMP|... right there.
1705113|CDR|Okay, verify safety on the dump valve. I'll do that.
1705117|LMP|Okay, I verify that there. And, ... there. I want to take a double look at something down there.
1705128|CDR|What's that? Locked?
1705133|LMP|Um-hum.
1705139|CDR|Happy?
1705139|LMP|Yep.
1705140|CDR|Okay. Okay, DESCENT H2O valve OPEN. Okay, DESCENT H2O valve OPEN.
1705150|LMP|That is OPEN.
1705150|CDR|Remove purge valves, stow in purse.
1705156|LMP|Okay.
1705202|CDR|Okay, disconnect OPS hose.
1705225|LMP|Oh boy.
1705226|CDR|That lock/lock is just tight on there, Jack.
1705231|LMP|It is (laughter). Got it.
1705244|CDR|Is it off?
1705244|LMP|Yes.
1705245|CDR|Okay. Connect LM hoses, red to red, and blue to blue. We've got to do that this time, because we've got to dump the PLSSs. Okay?
1705254|LMP|Okay. Let me turn around here. Let me get out of your way.
1705256|CDR|I'll get back in here. Okay, I'm out of the way now.
1705301|LMP|How would you like to get off the PLSS water and get some spacecraft water, too?
1705307|CDR|Oh, that's the next thing. Suit ISOL and suit FLOW, ON; and then We'll put PLSS pump and fan OFF. Then we'll disconnect the PLSS water and connect spacecraft water.
1705320|LMP|You might unhook that stuff up there so you can get to your hoses.
1705324|CDR|I can't reach it though.
1705325|LMP|Oh, okay. I can get it then. I can get it.
1705334|CDR|Okay, I guess.
1705339|LMP|Okay, we want red to red and blue to blue. We got to verify these too because -
1705348|CDR|Yes. Bob, you still with us?
1705358|CC|You bet, I wouldn't leave for the world.
1705404|CDR|Okay.
1705409|LMP|Okay, I'm hooked up and locked.
1705411|CDR|Okay.
1705411|LMP|You want to verify? And I'll veri - I'll do it for you, if you want.
1705415|CDR|Okay see if you can't find this one. Okay?
1705419|LMP|Yes. There, verify the red one.
1705424|CDR|Okay, in and locked?
1705427|LMP|Got the red one, locked. Locked.
1705434|CDR|Okay.
1705434|LMP|Let me take a look at yours.
1705441|CDR|Locked. Locked.
1705450|LMP|Okay.
1705451|CDR|Okay, now -
1705452|LMP|Ready for suit FLOW.
1705452|CDR|Yes sir - suit FLOW on both of them.
1705456|LMP|Okay.
1705457|CDR|Oh man, it feels great.
1705458|LMP|Yes sir.
1705459|CDR|PLSS pump OFF and PLSS fan OFF.
1705501|LMP|PLSS fan's OFF; pump's OFF.
1705504|CDR|Okay, disconnect PLSS water from PGA. Connect the LM water. Boy, I never thought air could feel so cool.
1705511|LMP|Yes.
1705513|CDR|Okay, the PLSS water is disconnected.
1705516|LMP|I think that's mine. Yes, that's mine. Spacecraft water.
1705526|CDR|Okay. Mine's connected.
1705540|LMP|How about pushing on that?
1705542|CDR|Okay. Got to see it, yes - but, I want to see it first. Watch your helmet, Jack. You're going to scratch it.
1705553|LMP|Got it -
1705554|CDR|You don't have your visor on - neither do I.
1705555|LMP|Yes, got it.
1705557|CDR|Okay, connect - Okay, PLSS mode. Bob, we're both going off the air. We'll get on LM comm.
1705603|CC|Okay. We'll be waiting for you. We're here.
1705608|CDR|Okay, go "0", Jack.
1705610|LMP|How about some cooling?
1705611|CDR|Okay, zap me with it, and go "0", and then put your audio breaker OPEN and connect the LM comm. Then an audio breaker CLOSED. Okay?
1705703|CDR|You read me, Jack?
1705714|CDR|You read me?
1705748|CDR|Read me?
1705748|LMP|You're loud and clear.
1705749|CDR|Okay. Next thing, VHF B - wait a minute. You get the audio breaker OPEN, CLOSED - Okay - VHF squelch B LMP. Okay, noise threshold, plus 1-1/2.
1705807|LMP|Yes.
1705810|CDR|Okay. AUDIO, both panels. VHF A RECEIVE, and B OFF.
1705820|LMP|A RECEIVE and B is OFF here.
1705824|CDR|Okay, mode ICS/PTT.
1710006|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 171 hours. Ron Evans, in America, 3-1/2 minutes away from loss of signal on the forty second lunar revolution. Ron, in good shape, and all systems on America functioning well. SIM bay experiments performing well, also. Even though we'll be in contact for another 3 minutes we have said good night to Ron and he, shortly, will be getting a - an 8 hour sleep shift.
1710109|LMP|Okay, Houston. We're back on LM comm.
1710111|CC|Roger, 17. We copy you loud and clear on LM comm.
1710133|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 171 hours 1 minute. The 3 EVA's of Apollo 17 totaled -
1710134|CC|And 17, Jack and Gene, we have a couple of - in fact, we have three records here to read out to you guys. On Apollo 17, two of them; one, the longest single EVA, 7 hours 37 minutes and 22 seconds. The longest total lunar surface EVA time 22 hours 5 minutes and 6 seconds. And the summary, the total lunar surface EVA time for the Apollo Program, 80 hours 44 minutes and 8 seconds.
1710210|CDR|That's quite a tribute to the people who made it possible. I'll tell you. Thank you, Bob.
1710215|CC|Roger, Geno. And I can't speak as authoritatively as some people have tonight, but for all of us around me, I'll say thank you, also.
1710230|CDR|Your words are well taken. You know how I feel.
1710255|CC|Hey, Gene and Ron, this is the CSM CAPCOM. Thought you might be interested. Your buddy up on - above you there is chugging on and about ready to bed down himself, right now. And he did take a good look at the landing site through binoculars tonight and took a good look at Shorty crater there, and noticed - plotted out some variations in color that may be the same color changes you saw in that orange soil and that, but we're trying to match it all up - Farouk and Ron are working it out - we're trying to match it all up and see if we can get a comparison there.
1710333|LMP|Excellent. Tell him we'll see him tomorrow.
1710336|CC|Yes, he's counting on it.
1710342|CDR|How's America looking to you, Bob?
1710345|CC|Well, I'll give an update. It - it's working perfect. No problems at all and we got good SIM bay data on everything. The UV, the IR, the lunar sounder, and everything that we - every data point we can see is just great. It's - it's just hardly any anomalies at all. Everything is just wonderful.
1710406|CDR|Outstanding.
1710424|CC|Gene, about this total limit of any problem there is, and it's not a problem, is we're just having to stir those tanks manually because of that limiting cycle on the - on the pressure switch there. We could go back to auto but it's easier to go manual.
1710444|CDR|I'll be back up there tomorrow and I'll stir it for you.
1710449|CC|Roger. And Jack and Gene, let me make a note here for you guys. There will be a series of references to this throughout the checklist but there's a general thing and you might even put a piece of tape across it if you want to or something - rather than go through and call out all the locations. We'll leave PRESS REG A closed for the rest of the time. Might just keep that in mind.
1710516|LMP|Okay, Bob, we'll - I think we'll handle that one okay.
1710554|CC|Gene, there's one thing you may be interested in as - as the Commander. We're going to have to do two burns tomorrow on America. The - the orbit - the mascons didn't deteriorate the orbit as much as everybody thought it was so there's going to be an RCS burn about an hour prior to the - to the LOPC burn.
1710621|CDR|That's interesting, Bob. Are you going to do a DOI 3, huh?
1710625|CC|Well, yes, I guess that's what it'll be - it's going to be an RCS burn at about 11 foot per second. It'll drop the - it'll circulize the orbit and then we'll do the plane change burn.
1710642|CC|Okay, and 17, we'd like you to press on reasonably diligently tonight. You're just about on schedule but if we can turn off this Marine, we'd like you guys to press on. We're looking at a nominal launch time and we've used up, of course, all the MCCH conference but we think you're within a few minutes of being right on. If you can press on like you did last night we'll be in great shape.
1710709|CDR|Okay, Bob. I never stopped doing what I wanted to do anyway even though a Marine was talking.
1710727|LMP|Okay, CDR's OPS 6100; LMP, 6500.
1710909|LMP|Okay, Houston this is the LMP. LMP's OPS is regulating at 4.25.
1710921|CC|Okay, I copy that.
1710923|LMP|And the CDR's is 3.9 - at 3.9.
1710927|CC|Okay that -
1710927|LMP|That might be - I started - let me bleed it off and let me see where it regulates at next time. I didn't have my hose locked, Bob, and it came off the first try. Bob, we'll take another OPS check later on when we stow them. We're pressing on.
1711003|CC|Jack, they're saying we better do that before you throw off the PLSSs because we have to verify a good one before you - before you dump the PLSSs.
1711013|LMP|Okay, we'll do that.
1711516|LMP|Okay, Houston, we rechecked the LMP's OPS and it's regulating at 4.25, again.
1711528|CC|Is that a steady 4.25, Jack?
1711533|CMP|Yes, it's done that twice now.
1711541|CC|Okay, and it's steady once you do it, Jack, right?
1711547|LMP|Right, it's open now. We've been watching it for about a minute, now.
1711551|CC|Okay, we'll go with it then, Jack.
1711556|LMP|Okay.
1711740|LMP|Okay, Bob, we're going to start the weighing process here - -
1711745|CC|Okay we're ready to copy - -
1711746|LMP|- - it might take a couple minutes to get things squared away.
1711748|CC|Okay give us a call. We're ready to copy the weights.
1711751|LMP|Okay.
1711833|LMP|Bob, sample 15 Echo has a bunch of dust and that gradually accumulated in my pocket.
1711843|CC|No fair, Jack, you can't go collecting samples after the EVA's over.
1712045|LMP|Say - say Bob, right now I can't find the sample containment bag number 5. Number 5 collection bag will be in bag 3.
1712057|CC|Okay, we note that. Thank you. Very good.
1712147|LMP|Okay, and we're going to cross out 3 on the bag, and put a 5 on it.
1712153|CC|Okay, or I think we could keep track of it otherwise; but that's fine.
1712201|LMP|That's for our reference too.
1712705|CC|...
1713632|CDR|Okay, Bob, you ready?
1713633|CC|Roger. We're ready.
1713638|CDR|Okay, bag 7 is 32, bag 4 is 31.5, bag 5 is 21, the big bag is 71. The ISA is 22.
1713704|CC|Okay, we have those five weights there, Geno. We have 32 for number 7, 31.5 for number 4, 21 for number 5. 71 for the SR - the big bag, and 22 for the ISA.
1713726|LMP|That's affirm, and we're standing by for your GO for jettison.
1713745|CC|Okay 17. Challenger, we are ready for jettison.
1713752|CDR|Roger. Understand.
1713903|CC|Okay and 17, we'd like - -
1713904|CDR|How do you read, Bob?
1713905|CC|- - loud and clear, 17. And Challenger, we'd like to keep out the original BSLSS bag, the one that you launched with. We - we think we're going to need that to stow samples in.
1713919|CDR|Okay, it's out.
1713921|CC|Okay. Or - or it's in, we hope.
1713923|CDR|Okay.
1713928|CDR|RECORDER, ON.
1713929|LMP|Whichever way.
1713931|CC|We want it kept in the cabin, right.
1713933|CDR|RECORDER'S ON.
1713937|CDR|Okay, don EV gloves. Let me - -
1713938|LMP|Okay, the recorder's not giving us any recording though.
1713943|CDR|See if I can't get a little ... out of some of these things. Don your gloves, Jack if you're -
1713955|LMP|Why isn't the recording recording?
1714001|CDR|Are we out of tape?
1714005|LMP|Be 8 hours on it. I don't think I left it on. I might have left it on. I probably did if it's on now. I thought I read it in the checklist though. Don Arabian will never forgive me.
1714041|CC|Shall we save ourselves some ascent weight?
1714047|LMP|(Laughter)
1714050|CC|Unfortunately, Owen wasn't listening.
1714052|LMP|Well it was okay up until - it was just this EVA if it was on, Bob.
1714104|CC|Okay.
1714105|LMP|Because it was working when we prepped, I'm sure of that.
1714109|CDR|Okay. Did you don your EV gloves? And we'll check each others connectors again.
1714115|LMP|I'll take my cuff checklists off.
1714125|CDR|Needless to say, you don't have to put your dust covers on, Jack. If that makes you feel better.
1714143|LMP|Oh boy.
1714150|CDR|Bob, how long were we out today, 7 what?
1714154|CC|Stand by, we got it here someplace; 7 hours and - 7 hours 15 minutes and 31 seconds.
1714210|CDR|How many kilometers did we put on the Rover?
1714213|CC|We have an approximate total of atout 36.1.
1714222|LMP|Boy this one is really getting stiff.
1714229|CDR|Probably another 1/2 kilometer on that when the nav wasn't working.
1714237|CC|I don't - yes, we didn't - we didn't get distance readouts all the time. We sort of interpolated those distances there, Gene.
1714246|LMP|Push on the button.
1714248|CDR|Are you opening or closing?
1714250|LMP|Closing, trying to.
1714251|CDR|You don't have to push on the button to close it.
1714253|LMP|Well yes - -
1714254|CDR|It's not locked.
1714256|PAO|That rover mileage is straight line distance. There would be a 10 to 20 percent variable factor for skirting around craters and other excursions of that type. The experiments support room expects to have a better on the mileage sometime tomorrow.
1714256|LMP|Now I know why I brought you.
1714256|CDR|Jack, did you put those gloves on?
1714256|LMP|I don't know. I was listening to you for one thing. Boy, it is stiff though. Never get it off. ... off.
1714330|SC|I ...
1714331|CDR|I ... this thing down there so it - -
1714333|LMP|Wait a minute. Tangled.
1714357|CDR|Okay, it just don't want to -
1714409|CDR|All we need.
1714434|SC|Okay, ...
1714439|CDR|Okay, EV gloves are donned. Let's check our PGA connectors. Do you want to check mine?
1714451|LMP|That's locked, that's not ...
1714452|CDR|Okay.
1714454|LMP|Helmet shouldn't have changed. Okay. That's locked, locked, locked, locked. Over, I can't see, locked.
1714512|CDR|Okay, suit circuits shall not be maintained at elevated pressure greater than 5 minutes.
1714516|LMP|Okay, we want to do an integrity check here.
1714518|CDR|Now, we're not going to use REG A at all.
1714520|LMP|Right.
1714521|CDR|Okay, SUIT GAS DIVERTER, PULL EGRESS, verify.
1714524|LMP|PULL EGRESS.
1714525|CDR|Now you can verily all that other stuff. CABIN GAS RETURN EGRESS, verify.
1714530|LMP|Verified.
1714532|CDR|And SUIT CIRCUIT RELIEF is a CLOSE. CLOSE it.
1714536|LMP|Okay, it's going CLOSED. CLOSED.
1714540|CDR|Okay, PRESSURE REG A - let's leave A OFF, and PRESSURE REG B to DIRECT O2 - ... 4.0, and then go to EGRESS, and we'll check on decay.
1714555|LMP|Okay, go on to - -
1714557|CDR|Wait a minute ... I should have ...
1714603|LMP|Yes. Okay, its unlocked.
1714611|CDR|Okay.
1714612|LMP|For 3 you're ready for O2.
1714631|LMP|How high do they want the suit?
1714633|CDR|3.7 to 4.0 cuff gage.
1714636|LMP|Okay, it's warming up, slowly.
1714643|CDR|Yes, could you give me some water.
1714707|LMP|Off the peg. Down off the peg.
1714725|LMP|There, you - coming up on 3.5.
1714728|CDR|Okay, when you hit 3.7, I'll be with you. So you can -
1714731|LMP|Okay 3.7. Okay.
1714734|LMP|MARK it. One minute.
1714736|CDR|Okay.
1714739|CDR|You did go EGRESS, right?
1714741|LMP|Yes.
1714741|CDR|Okay.
1714752|SC|(Laughter)
1714800|LMP|Well, it's suppose to be possible to do it.
1714803|CDR|Hope so, ...
1714822|CDR|There. Get it?
1714825|LMP|Yes.
1714826|CDR|Okay, we've got another 15 seconds to go.
1714843|CDR|Okay, MARK it. In one minute you go to SUIT CIRCUIT RELIEF, AUTO.
1714848|LMP|Okay, suit - watch your ears.
1714850|CDR|Okay.
1714852|LMP|There.
1714855|CC|And 17, we're watching you, and you look good to us. You're GO.
1714902|LMP|Okay, I had about 2/10.
1714904|CDR|And I had 2/10. 3.7 to 3.5. Okay, let's make sure we got everything. You went to 4.0, then you went to EGRESS then we monitor SUIT CIRCUIT RELIEF, AUTO; pressure is decaying at 4.8. Okay, that's good. Okay. We're GO for cabin depress.
1714922|CC|Roger. Roger, you're GO for -
1714924|CDR|Okay, 16 ECS CABIN REPRESS, OPEN.
1714928|LMP|Okay, REPRESS coming OPEN. CIRCUIT BREAKER, OPEN.
1714932|CDR|Okay. This time, I think I'll get this down here.
1714936|LMP|They want this left in auto?
1714937|CDR|Huh?
1714938|LMP|Leave this in auto?
1714942|CDR|... just all you want is - -
1714943|LMP|- - circuit breaker.
1714943|CDR|- - 16 CABIN REPRESS, OPEN.
1714945|LMP|Okay. Overhead or forward dump valve OPEN and then AUTO at 3.5.
1714950|CDR|Get that one down there, now.
1714953|LMP|Okay, you ready?
1714954|CDR|Okay, go ahead. I'll give you a call at 3.5.
1715002|CDR|Circuit relief was AUTO, right?
1715004|LMP|Yes. Had to be. Okay.
1715012|LMP|Okay, going OPEN.
1715016|CDR|Okay, it's coming down. I want your AUTO at 3.5, I give you a call my suit is going up.
1715023|CDR|MARK it. Okay, you're 3.5. Verify cabin 3.5 and LM suit circuit locked up at 4.3 and decaying. Okay, it's about 4.6 and decaying. How's it look to you, Houston?
1715040|CC|Looks good to us, 17.
1715045|CDR|Okay, Jack. Overhead - make it forward dump, OPEN. And I'll verify we lock up ...
1715057|LMP|Is decaying, the auto's working.
1715118|PAO|Challenger's cabin is being depressurized.
1715120|CDR|Locking up, and the cabin's at 1.
1715124|PAO|Hatch will be opened and equipment no longer needed will be jettisoned.
1715140|CDR|Okay, hatch opening. Downward.
1715151|CDR|When I get the hatch partially opened, you can go to AUTO on that valve.
1715204|LMP|Still no good words about the gravimeter, huh, Bob?
1715208|CC|No, there's an out - outside chance that it's been a little cold. And they're hoping that if it warms up, that it may take care of itself but, no, everybody's very sad about that.
1715223|LMP|Well, I could have sprinkled dirt on it, maybe.
1715231|CDR|Let me ... to the hatch, Jack. Still about point 2.
1715249|LMP|Okay, you want that in auto?
1715250|CDR|I can get it from here.
1715252|LMP|Okay. And a lock / lock's on.
1715306|CDR|Turn around over here, boy I wish you could take some of that dust out. Get it.
1715312|LMP|Better turn - wait ...
1715316|CDR|The hatch is open, Houston.
1715319|CC|Copy that.
1715321|LMP|Okay. Okay.
1715329|CDR|And, Danny's not out there, to hand us in the light weight PLSS's.
1715333|LMP|Okay. Here goes the old - whose PLSS is this now?
1715337|CDR|Well, look at it, if you want a memory.
1715340|LMP|That must be yours it's red. No, that's mine, no it's yours. Here goes the old Commander's PLSS.
1715348|CDR|Okay, baby thanks for doing a good job. And that was a backup PLSS too.
1715353|LMP|Well, that wasn't very good.
1715355|CDR|It walked down the ladder.
1715358|LMP|It went down as gracefully as you did.
1715400|CDR|Look at that. Okay, what's next?
1715404|LMP|Well, I can give you some of these. Here hold - okay. Everything that's in here. Okay. That's the first thing.
1715419|LMP|Okay. Okay.
1715435|CDR|Let me. Beautiful gloves.
1715444|CDR|Yes. Houston, I think we ought to probably just mention, anyway. We are jettisoning a set of - 2 sets of EVA gloves. I think that's worth mentioning. Because they did their job.
1715459|LMP|Just like everything else did its job. Can I jettison mine?
1715505|CDR|Okay.
1715509|LMP|Whoops, we didn't get them clear.
1715511|CC|Okay, we copy 2 sets of EVA gloves to the surface for the last time.
1715519|CDR|They're very reluctant. (Laughter)
1715522|LMP|What else have you got there?
1715524|CDR|IS - ISS.
1715525|LMP|... the other ISS.
1715536|LMP|Nope, one more.
1715536|CDR|Is that it?
1715540|LMP|Nope, one more thing.
1715542|CDR|No wait. Oh, is there something ... ?
1715548|LMP|Watch it. Take this, I'll get it.
1715612|CDR|Okay, that's getting thinned out.
1715616|LMP|Okay, the old LMP's PLSS. - that OPS stays where it is.
1715625|CDR|Okay. Okay, put your - get it down there and then put your foot against it and it'll probably go. The only geologist's PLSS on the Moon. Good boy. Have fun PLSS.
1715654|LMP|It'll stay there. Okay, we got everything else. Okay - -
1715700|CDR|Hatch seal clear.
1715704|LMP|Pretty good.
1715705|CDR|Pretty good from here.
1715707|LMP|Too bad we don't have a broom.
1715709|CDR|You got everything else? Nothing else here to go? Nothing behind you? Nothing here? Okay.
1715719|LMP|Hatch going closed. ... again tomorrow. I know it.
1715728|CDR|Okay, forward hatch closed. Let me see if I can't lock it. Okay, it's locked.
1715751|LMP|Okay, CABIN REPRESS, DUMP valve, both AUTO, verified.
1715755|CDR|They're - all are auto and locked. Okay.
1715759|CDR|CABIN REPRESS, AUTO. Verify.
1715802|LMP|Verified.
1715803|CDR|At 16, CABIN REPRESS, CLOSED.
1715805|LMP|REPRESS going CLOSED.
1715807|CDR|MASTER ALARM and CABIN WARNING LIGHT ON. There it is. Cabin's coming up. Okay, it's increased and you go to ca - cabin on that one reg.
1715827|LMP|One reg, Bravo.
1715831|CDR|Cabin - ...
1715924|CDR|Okay, cabin's coming it's about 5.
1715928|CDR|Okay, lights are off. Repress stopped. Cabin pressure stable. Okay, Houston, Challenger, we're going to take off our gloves.
1715948|CDR|Hello, Houston. How does it look?
1715950|CC|Roger. You look stable, and stand by.
1715958|CC|Okay, you're GO to unsuit there, guys.
1720013|LMP|Speaking of suits. These things performed super.
1720058|CDR|Okay, and we can get our helmets off.
1720101|LMP|If I can ever get unsuited. Oh, this is funny. (Laughter) That's my hand. Let me try the other one.
1720113|CDR|Oh, let me get it for you. I can free here - Yes, but I'm (Laughter).
1720118|LMP|There. The right one went easy - I think they're all really getting -
1720127|CDR|Oh, and the helmet is off and I'm throwing it in the BRA.
1720144|LMP|Well, there's no changing our mind now, the PLSSs are going to be hard to retrieve. But you could if you had to, though.
1720152|CC|Challenger, Houston. Challenger, Houston. From the old backup crew that followed you every step of the way, super job on EVA you guys.
1720210|LMP|Thank you, John. Appreciate the words Jose. But we also appreciate your helping to get us this far.
1720222|CC|Roger; Neil.
1720223|CDR|Hey, you know in - in all those things you tell people - Was that Charlie? I haven't heard your voice since - you know all those good things you tell us about dust and all those other things, you know, you believe them all just like everybody else does - but you've just got to come out here and experience it for yourself to really be a believer.
1720247|CC|Yes, well I take it back about it all looks the same.
1720253|CDR|Hey, it - it really doesn't Charlie, but all those physical things you get handicapped with - there's a lot of easy things as far as 1/6 g - but all those other things - you know there's nothing like doing it to be a believer.
1720307|CC|Well, you guys did it great.
1720314|LMP|Charlie it may all look the same but Taurus Littrow, mark my words, has some variety.
1720321|CC|Yes, we could tell that, Jack. Great job.
1720327|LMP|Thank you, Charlie and thank you for all the help.
1720332|CDR|Hey, Charlie I remember a long time ago when I said something about being down among them. I didn't know what it was until we got here.
1720345|CC|And, Challenger we have a good word from the old program managers even though you guys were pretty piggy there in bringing rocks back, we're going to let you keep them all. You only busted the red line by 40 pounds.
1720402|LMP|Okay, he's a pretty good guy anyway.
1720406|CC|That assumes your good buddy upstairs gets a good plane change tomorrow.
1720415|LMP|Oh, he will and I tell you Gene and I both have lost 20 pounds apiece on this mission.
1720423|CC|We can believe that.
1720428|CDR|Verify safetys.
1720431|LMP|Hey, we're on VOX anyway - let's go to ICS/PTT.
1720435|CC|It's safer that way.
1720440|CDR|Yes, specially when you don't know you're talking.
1720451|LMP|Okay, we came to the end of the EVA-3 prep and post card.
1720500|CC|Roger. We're following you to the surface checklist.
1720501|CDR|Hey Jack and I are going to frame this - Jack and I are going to frame this page 2-3, cut it down the middle and each take half.
1720517|LMP|I'm going to take the front half. Gene will take the back half.
1720613|LMP|Okay, Roberto, we're going to manage the old batteries.
1720621|CC|Okay, and Challenger we're ready to manage the old batteries.
1720630|LMP|The old ED batteries are 37.2 - A and B. I was just going to say I wish we had a broom.
1720845|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 172 hours 8 minutes. The Change of Shift News Conference is scheduled in the MSC News Center Briefing Room for 1:30 A.M. CST, approximately 30 minutes from now.
1721014|CC|Okay, we're happy with your battery management. We're ready for you guys to go to low.
1721023|LMP|You got - you got low.
1721025|CC|Thank you.
1721057|CC|And Challenger, it's Bob. I'm going to turn you over to Casper about now, and let him put you guys to sleep.
1721057||BEGIN LUNAR REV 45
1721115|LMP|Bob, I'm not sure what you mean. Who's your friendly ghost?
1721119|CC|I bet you can guess.
1721122|LMP|He doesn't know anything about the LM. He doesn't know anything about the LM.
1721134|CC|It's never too late to learn.
1721141|LMP|For you, I believe that; for a lot of people, I wouldn't.
1721148|CDR|Welcome aboard, Ken.
1721151|CC|You guys make a pretty interesting show to watch.
1721203|LMP|I hope so.
1721226|LMP|All I can do is hear your breathing, Ken.
1721230|CC|Yes. Just noticed that.
1721918|LMP|Hey, Ken. You can tell your friends off to the left there that I've turned the biomed off.
1721925|CC|Okay. Thank you.
1722527|CDR|Hello, Houston; Challenger. CDR's going off the air.
1722533|CC|Okay.
1723241|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 172:32 Ground Elapsed Time. They're estimating a Change of Shift Briefing with the offgoing Orange Team Flight Director, Pete Frank and the Spacecraft Communicator Bob Parker, just being relieved after completion of EVA 3. We're estimating that Press Conference to commence in approximately 5 minutes in the small Briefing Room - Building 1 News Center. 172:33 this is Apollo Control.
1723627|CC|Hey, Jack; Houston. You busy?
1723633|LMP|Say again, Ken.
1723635|CC|Are you busy? I'm sitting here looking at a couple of questions that they wanted to ask. And whenever it's convenient for you - I'm not sure just how busy you are right now - and just keep in mind I've got a few questions to ask you on the traverses, and give me a call when you're ready to talk about it.
1723658|LMP|Okay; we're suit - unsuiting, Ken. Let us get unsuited, and then we'll be back - be back with you.
1723702|CC|Okay. Just whenever it's convenient for you.
1724406|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The Change of Shift Press Conference is prepared to begin at this moment. We'll take down the Air-Ground Circuit at this time and play back accumulated tape at the conclusion of the Press Conference. At 172:44, this is Apollo Control.
1724657|CC|Challenger, Houston.
1724702|LMP|Go ahead.
1724704|CC|Hey, how about if we hit a PRO on the DSKY and get it into P00 and back into STANDBY? We're worrying about the clock registers overflowing. And we'd like to get that done before 172:50, or somewhere in that neighborhood.
1724723|LMP|Okay; stand by.
1724728|LMP|Is that what you wanted?
1724731|CC|Oh, we can't watch it, Jack. If you just tell us that you've got it into P00 and back into P06.
1724741|LMP|That's what happened.
1724746|LMP|I thought you watched it the other night.
1724748|CC|No, we don't have any high bit rate now.
1724748|LMP|That do make a difference. That's right.
1724748|CC|I understand that - that you've completed that transition. is that correct?
1724748|LMP|Which one?
1724748|CC|You did get it out of STANDBY into P00, and then back. Is that correct?
1724748|LMP|That's affirm. We completed that.
1724748|CC|Okay. Thank you.
1724748|LMP|Sorry to be so unclear.
1724748|CC|Hey, we - we also are still on your stowage. So when you get on page 7-6, where it says, "Stow Heaviest Collection Bag," down in the right-hand column towards the bottom, why don't you skip that step until after the eat period. And we're still working on the stowage locations.
1724748|LMP|Okay.
1730233|CDR|Hello, Ken. How do you read Challenger's CDR?
1730237|CC|Loud and clear.
1730237|CDR|Okay.
1730304|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 173 hours, 3 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The crew aboard Challenger at this time still unsuiting, getting prepared for bedding down for their final night on the lunar surface, final Earth night that is, in as much as they're in a middle of a 14 hour lunar day. Spacecraft America now behind the Moon on the end of the 43rd lunar orbit. There are about 55 seconds of tape from the air/ground 1 contact with the lunar module, Challenger which were accumulated during the just completed Change of Shift Press Conference. We'll play back that tape at this time and continue live with the remainder of the communications prior to the sleep period for Cernan and Schmitt at Taurus-Littrow.
1731913|CDR|Houston, Challenger. How would you feel about this canister being changed now?
1731920|CC|Stand by. Okay, change her out, Geno.
1731928|CDR|Okay.
1731945|CC|For your information, we're trying to negotiate some time for you here. We're about one and a half down. We know how to pick up 1 hour of it, but we haven't quite figured out how to gain the other half.
1731958|CDR|Okeydoke. Well, we're - we're all unsuited now, and we're about ready to talk and eat at the same time, or listen and eat here at the same time. And it won't be long and we'll be ready to hit the sack.
1732010|CC|Okay; fine. Ken's trying to negotiate the question sessions for you here.
1732352|CDR|Canister's changed out, now.
1732356|CC|Thank you.
1732604|CDR|Okay, Ken, we're - we're on and ready for that debriefing. And you should be getting Jack's biomed also.
1732611|CC|Okay. Okay, before we start cn those questions, are you prepared to copy some lift-off times in your data book, and that kind cf stuff?
1732626|CDR|In about 10 seconds.
1732627|CC|All right, sir.
1732637|LMP|Go ahead, Ken.
1732639|CC|Okay. This is rev 44. Lift-off: 174 plus 13 plus 49. TPI: 177 plus 01 plus 00. Okay; I'll give you just the lift-off times. Excuse me. For rev 45: 176 plus 12 plus 19; 178 plus 10 plus 49; 180 plus 09 plus 20; 182 plus 07 plus 50; 184 plus 06 plus 20. Rev 50 is 186:04:50. Over.
1732740|LMP|Okay, Ken. Starting with 44: 174:13:49; 176:12:19; 178:10:49; 180:09:20; 182:07:50; 184:06:02 [sic]; 186:04:50. And what's the present rev, please?
1732805|CC|Okay; we're coming up on fourty - in fact, it looks like we're in 44 right now. Okay. And, Jack, how about let's confirm that the rev 49 was 184:06:20.
1732833|LMP|Oh, I did have that wrong, in the seconds - two zero seconds.
1732837|CC|That's affirmative. Okay; and we've got your biomed coming through.
1732844|LMP|Well, one - one - Am I alive?
1732850|CC|Just barely.
1732855|LMP|Ken, I'd like to believe that you read that one wrong, because I've gone througn 50 copies on that without a mistake.
1732903|CC|Well, I'll - I'll settle that with you when you get back.
1732906|LMP|50 rev.
1732908|CC|All right, sir. And - -
1732910|LMP|Okay.
1732910|CC|- - looks like it's about time for an eat period, and I've got these questions for you. But let's keep in mind that that's secondary, and if it ever gets in the way of eating, why holler up, and we'll just drop it right there. We're about an hour and a half behind the time line, and we're going to make up no more than an hour of that.
1732938|CDR|Okay.
1732945|LMP|Well, I think --
1733010|CDR|Okay, Ken. We're cutting into the chow and go ahead.
1733013|CC|Okay. Would you like for me to just read you all the questions, and let you mull those over before you work on it, or you want to do one at a time?
1733025|LMP|One at a time's better, Ken.
1733027|CC|All right, sir. Number 1. Wanted to know if the blue-gray rocks at Station 6 are similar to those at Station 2.
1733048|LMP|Ken, I think they are. But I think you'll find that the ones in Station 6 are much more metamorphic rock, or recrystallized rock, than the ones we had at Station 2. I had the impression that the ones we were sampling at Station 6 were - were really inclusions in the - anorthositic gabbro, and had - had been probably considerably metamorphosed by it being included in it; whereas, the ones we had at Station 2 were a separate rock type apparently, as I recall it, anyway.
1733141|CC|Okay; that's good.
1733142|LMP|Ken, let me just say that I - My impression is that there was a lot more action in the rocks at Station 6 than 2, I saw a lot more; a lot more was evident, the inclusions and, some of the patterns, some of the other things we saw.
1733207|CC|All right, sir. Let's go on to the second one, and it said: Do we understand that there were no breccias at Station 8?
1733226|LMP|In the one - that parent orthopyroxene piagiociase rock - was a breccia in the sense it was fractured and was injected by dark glass. But it would be what we would call a mosaic breccia, in that respect, I think, and not the - Didn't see any Station 6, or Station 2-type breccias there at all. Other than the subfloor gabbro, that orthopyroxene piagiociase rock was the only major rock type I think we saw, unless we picked up some in the rake sample.
1733313|CC|Okay. Okay; the third one says: What are your impressions of the distribution of the - the familiar subfloor gabbros throughout the EVA-3 traverse?
1733345|LMP|Well, I don't - I don't - I think we discussed that a little bit on the traverse - quite a bit, as a matter of fact. The impression I had was that most of the traverse on the plains, with the one exception of - of Van Serg Crater, were - We were in box fields or fragment fields that were almost - well, were dominately subfloor. And visually from the Rover, I had no impression of any other significant rock type, with the exception of occasional blocks of the gray variety of the subfloor gabbro. And I don't know - Gene - I don't know what Gene's impression was. He was driving a lot, but - pass it on.
1733435|CDR|I think - we actually even commented when we hit the breaking slope coming back out of Station 6 and 7, and then back off at - coming back down at 8 - how the terrain features changed. I think that was due principally to the - to the - what we've been calling the subfloor material evident. And there again, it was, what I would say, particularly mantled, filleted, much like we nave here where the LM is, with the exception of Van Serg, where we actually saw fragmental boulders for the most part, a lot less buried sitting on the surface.
1733525|CC|All right, sir. At Van Serg, some rocks were described as gray breccias, and some contained white fragments. Was there a variety of breccias present?
1733541|LMP|I think - I think not, Ken. My impression was that there was a variety only in their - in the degree to which they were fractured. We found and sampled, I think, the two major - one extreme - extremely fractured rock that I said was - was friable. Anyway, it broke into small pieces very easily with a hammer or in your hand, if you worked at it. And the other was a breccia that was not - was much more cohesive than that. It was not fractured or friable at all, but they both were on the rim, and I think they were just varieties of - probably of shock fracturing.
1733627|CC|Okay. Could the Van Serg breccias correlate with the blue-gray material at Cochise?
1733640|LMP|That's possible, I guess. But my first guess would be that the blue-gray at Cochise was blue-gray subfloor. And, well, I don't know. That's a good question. That's a good question. We - Maybe with the pictures we have, we can work out the - an attitude - approximate attitude on that contact that I talked about in Cochise, and see if it would project over reasonably to Van Serg. I wouldn't be surprised if it would. That's a good - that's a good point. To me they looked very similar.
1733721|CC|Okay. And you guys sure you're eating?
1733724|LMP|But - but - Ken, Ken, Ken - -
1733729|CC|Go ahead.
1733733|CDR|Yes, we're eating. We're fixing and eating at the same time.
1733739|CC|You're mighty efficient. Go ahead. You were starting to say something.
1733746|LMP|You just - yes, Ken. I think from the distance we saw the blue-gray in Cochise, you couldn't make a definite correlation. But it's a good idea and ought to be considered as one of the possibilities. The other is that we just had a window in the subfloor that coincidentally - I mean one underneath the subfloor might be that breccia. Coincidentally - the Van Serg impact hit that window.
1733821|CC|Okay. Can you tell us anything about the cowpie at Van Serg. Was that a clast in the breccia?
1733831|LMP|Negative. It was a - excuse me; I have my mouth full.
1733839|CC|It's about time.
1733842|LMP|It was an ag - it was an aggregate of irregular - what looked like agglutinated glass in fragments just sitting on the rim of Van Serg. And the reason I said I thought it was in place or had - had fallen there and crystallized there, is that there were four or five similar fragments arranged in a small coherent area. Not making that very clear I don't think, but it looks as if it hit and broke apart upon hitting a little bit but didn't - didn't really splatter or - or break apart in any significant manner.
1733938|CC|All right.
1733939|LMP|There are similar things - I tell you what it looks like. If anybody'd walked up the rim of Kilauea Iki in the ash out there, and on top of the ash, there are bombs that were fairly clearly molten when they hit, and they had just - just enough spring to break as - when they hit. But they - the individual pieces didn't move very far at all. And you can see that pattern on Kilauea Iki. And it was the same kind of thing, except that there was no directional aspect of it here.
1734022|CC|Okay.
1734025|LMP|And that's not to say it's volcanic glass. That's just the kind of pattern it was.
1734036|CC|Okay. Can you tell us if the darker material in the bottom of Van Serg was similar to the collected rim material?
1734050|LMP|I think so, except as Gene pointed out, the clasts were coarser. They were coarser in the bottom than about anything we saw in the rim.
1734102|CC|Okay. Are there any distinctive features, other than color, to separate tan from blue-gray breccias, such as joining, or massive nature, continuity, anything of that nature?
1734129|LMP|Yes, we're - -
1734132|CDR|Where did we find those tan breccias?
1734139|CC|Challenger, this is Bob. I think we were talking about some of them, I think, at Station 1 the first night. We had both natures. In fact, I think we had - Didn't we have two of those in the same rock together?
1734153|LMP|They were both gabbros.
1734155|CC|Yes, excuse me - -
1734155|LMP|Bob, they were tan gabbros and blue-gray gabbros.
1734159|CC|Roger. Okay, yesterday, excuse me I wasn't reading the question. Okay, the breccias - they were tan and blue gray breccias yesterday at Station 2 were there not? You have the two types of breccias at Station 2.
1734212|LMP|Oh well, yes, yes, that's right. And now as I think back I guess that's the main difference between the tan rocks at Station 2 and Station 6, but the ones at 6 appear to be - have an igneous texture or at least a very crystalline texture and inclusion-like masses of other rocks. Whereas, the ones at Station 2 they - they seem to be fragment breccias, as I recall. That's right, although they may have been recrystallized or metamorphosed, they were clearly breccias at Station 2. I just forgot about that.
1734258|CC|Okay, copy that. Okay, and can you amplify your description going out to Station 6. In particular were there blue-gray and tan-gray bands on the North Massif?
1734317|LMP|Rather than bands, there were lines that appeared to be the upper terminus of the - of the source of the boulders that were strewn below that line. And those lines tended to be either - show a blue-gray source or a tan-gray source, if you will. ...
1734359|LMP|Oh, those ... bags.
1734405|CC|Challenger, if you - if you think you're talking to us, you're breaking up badly.
1734413|LMP|I just thought you might be interested, we just had a little spurt of dust come up by the window.
1734424|CC|Was there a sleigh with it?
1734441|LMP|Wise guy.
1734450|CC|Okay. Did you see very much of dust, or was it just one little shot?
1734454|LMP|... one little shot, it was actually just particles. Something we threw out must have popped.
1734509|CC|Okay, do you have any preliminary stratigraphic sequence for the plains?
1734522|LMP|For the plains, huh? Well, my guess would be that the Van Serg breccias were the oldest rocks. The gabbro - subfloor gabbro's the next oldest, and the mantling material's the youngest. But that's - the only good clear relationship was mantle on top of the subfloor gabbros. I - we really don't have a good relationship of the breccias and I just - I guess I lean towards thinking that that Van Serg was a window in the sub floor rather than being a bed of some kind, on top of the subfloor.
1734610|CC|Okay, and do you have an opinion on what underlies the Sculptured Hills?
1734622|LMP|Well, I think, we said - the rake sample is probably going to have to tell the tale there. My guess is from the boulder - boulders and subfloor around up there that - are of gabbro and maybe the Sculptured Hills are a version of the subfloor rocks. I don't think that the orthopyroxene anorthosite rock was necessarily indigenous to the Sculptured Hills. It was glass-coated and permeated by glass so I suspect it may have been thrown there by an impact somewhere else.
1734705|CC|All right sir, we've got one last thing for you to clean up. Back on page 7-6 of your checklist, it looks like we may have skipped some steps on the GAS RETURN valve, and like to make sure that you get to AUTO and the GAS DIVERTER PUSHED to CABIN before you stow the oxygen hoses.
1734755|LMP|Okay, Ken, we got CABIN GAS RETURN, AUTO.
1734800|CC|Okay, understand AUTO and you got the select to CABIN?
1734808|LMP|Yes, GAS DIVERTER pushed to CABIN and we're trying the PGAs now.
1734813|CC|All right, sir.
1734823|CDR|And I guess if - if you could go in - my feeling is if you go to the bottom of every one of those large craters like Camelot, you could examine some of these fragments on the walls and down into the bottom, I just get a feeling you'd find this - this blue-gray breccia down there.
1734846|CC|All right, sir.
1734853|CDR|I mean in all the big craters like Camelot.
1734857|LMP|Well we - I think maybe that's true, however, we did not see isolated fragments of it very often, if at all, out here on the - the plains themselves, away from the craters. So if the blue-gray breccia does - the Van Serg breccia does underlie the subfloor, the craters are not - it's far enough that the craters we have apparently have not penetrated and brought up much of that kind of material. Well that's it.
1734943|CC|Okay guys, it's time to press on and finish up chow time and I've got your stowage summaries whenever you're ready for that, to get started on.
1734958|LMP|Okay, Ken let us finish eating, then we'll go back to work.
1735002|CC|Okay, give me a call when you're ready.
1735016|LMP|I'll help you in just a second. ...
1735408|LMP|Okay. Okay. Ken I'd like to go ahead and hear your recommendations on stowage and I'll write it down.
1735415|CC|Alright, sir. Page 2-2. I've got some numbers to fill in at the bottom under the collection bag stowage.
1735428|LMP|Okay, I've got it.
1735430|CC|Okay, number 1 with the aft engine cover is bag 8. And then the second line, it's bag 7. The third line it's bag 6 left hand and 5 right hand. And the last line is bags 2 and 4. And you can disregard the max weights.
1735457|LMP|Okay, just so we got it straight aft of the engine cover, bag 8. Left hand side, bag 7. Left hand plus the right hand side; number 6 left land and 5 right. And the ISA bags 2 and 4.
1735512|CC|That's affirmative.
1735522|LMP|Okay.
1735855|CC|Hey, Jack, the people down here watching things noticed that your SUIT ISOL valve is still in DISCONNECT if you're trying to dry the suit out you might check that. It's your option what you want to do with it.
1735910|LMP|I'm glad somebody is watching things. Thank you.
1740757|CDR|Ken we're in the process of getting all these bags in the proper places, now.
1742803|LMP|Ken, this is Jack, why don't you take a note that mag Bravo is empty, with miscellaneous photos since the last report on it.
1742814|CC|Okay.
1743136|CDR|And, Ken, we're stowing mag Nancy at a reading 153.
1743145|CC|Okay, copy 153.
1744415|CDR|Houston, Challenger.
1744418|CC|Go ahead, Geno.
1744425|CDR|Okay, Ken we're - all we've got left to stow now is the buddy SLSS bag and that's in work. And we got all the ETB stuff taken care of. All the other bags are stowed per your recommendation. We'll be configuring the ECS for sleep and putting up the hammocks here shortly and as soon as we can get cleaned up personally a little bit, we'll be in the sack.
1744500|CC|Okay. Sounds great.
1744558|CC|Hey, Geno, the guys are looking at that buddy SLSS bag and suggested you all make sure that you're going to have room to do the equipment jettison and get the hatch open and all that. They had planned on stowing it the next day.
1744617|CDR|That's a good thought, Ken. Thank you, Ed. The fact is that probably may think more convenient - we were going to be smart and get ahead here but, thank you.
1744626|CC|The faster I run, the behinder I get.
1744632|CDR|Yes. I keep forgetting these checklists have been exercised a hundred thousand times.
1744651|CC|Yes, we keep remembering that.
1745106|CC|Challenger, Houston. If you'll just give us a call when you're ready to sack out we won't bother you and just that way we can keep track of what you're doing and when you're about ready to go to bed and we'll get you up at an appropriate time.
1745123|LMP|Okay, Ken, this is Jack. I guess I have the duty biomed tonight, so I'll give you a call when we're turning out the lights.
1745132|CC|Okay.
1745132|LMP|And it won't be too long.
1745134|CC|All right. You guys are doing pretty good. You're almost caught up.
1745237|LMP|Hey, Ken, working through this thing, we haven't been able to find instructions for the stowage of the EV gloves. Do your friends back there have any recommendations?
1745250|CC|Okay, stand by one and I'll check on that.
1745414|CC|Okay, Jack, we can stick those things on The comm panel for now, and then tomorrow on page 7-14, it's going to have you stow them in the LEVA bags. But for the time being if you just stick those up on the panel, set them aside - you'll use them tomorrow.
1745436|LMP|Okay, Ken got you. Yes, they're going to get the inside of the LEVA pretty dirty.
1745459|CC|Well, from what we've seen, Jack. I think everything's going to be about the same color by the time you get through.
1745510|LMP|Okay, it didn't bother your - your EVA, did it Ken, to have a little dust in your helmet?
1745517|CC|No, no - that's kind of nice to have.
1745524|LMP|Hey, an experienced fellow like you might have a recommendation on how to get my visor up.
1745532|CC|Yes, give it to the CMP.
1745603|CC|We were just debating down here how come you guys threw away those nice clean gloves and kept the dirty ones.
1745612|LMP|I wish you hadn't ask that Pete. (Laughter) We were just debating that too.
1745625|CC|How long are your arms, Jack.
1745628|LMP|You do all sorts of things.
1745632|LMP|Hey, they're out on the porch as a matter of fact. That's not too far fetched.
1745708|LMP|I guess there's some old friends you just hate to get rid of, Pete.
1745712|CC|Yes, that figures.
1745732|CC|Hey, you guys have had some real winners there. Don't change a good thing.
1745741|LMP|Well, they seemed to do all right for us. I guess that's the way we were half-way thinking, but not thinking very well, as was witnessed in our checklist procedures tonight.
1745754|CC|Ah, you're doing outstanding.
1750009|CC|Challenger, Houston. On your comm, your checklist will call for going to down-voice backup. And, tonight, we'd rather just leave it in the normal voice. So if you leave the configuration you have, rather than change it, that would be a good deal for us.
1750038|CDR|Okay, Ken, I only got part of that, I was scrubbing my face here. You want to save the same comm configuration we've got right now. is that correct?
1750046|CC|That's affirmative.
1750053|CDR|Okay. That's easy. Yes.
1751655|LMP|Okay, Ken. Gene just stowed the EVA antenna.
1751701|CC|Okay.
1751705|LMP|And I'll be off COMM here just for a few minutes, biomed, so I'll be back with you when I turn in.
1751714|CC|Okay. I may have misled you earlier when I said, we weren't going to lose any time. We can - we can get you 8 hours up to about 19 after the hour. After that, we're going to have to start rearranging things to get 8 hours.
1751736|LMP|Well, Gene's almost in his hammock now. And I will be shortly, so I think we're probably in pretty good, shape.
1751742|CC|Okay, that's fine. I just - I didn't want to mislead you.
1751748|LMP|That's all right, you've never misled me before. Well, let me think about that.
1751759|CC|Was going to say, you catch on awful slow, if that's true.
1751808|LMP|Right.
1751917|LMP|Ken, I'm going to take off my headset here and jump into the hammock. What - what time we getting up CET - Central Time?
1751931|CC|Well, it's going to be roughly 45 minutes past the time listed at 182:39. So - are you asking for it in local time?
1751944|CDR|Yes, I - My watch is set on Houston time. What time will it be?
1751948|CC|Be about - -
1751948|LMP|Eight hours from when?
1751950|CC|Be about 12:15, Geno.
1751955|CDR|Okay, that sounds great, Deke. It won't - We're just cleaning up a few minor things and we'll actually probably be asleep in the next 10 to 15 minutes.
1752007|CC|Okay, sleep good. You had a lovely day. Hope tomorrow's as good.
1752010|CDR|Sorry to keep - Thank you, boss. Sorry to keep you up so late. But appreciate it very much.
1752019|CC|We're enjoying it.
1752023|CC|Hey, Gene, before you unplug you might - -
1752024|CDR|Okay, I'm going off the air.
1752024|CC|- - Check your - check the Suit Flow valve. Looks like it's not flowing, if that's the configuration you want.
1752041|CDR|Yes, we've got them - we got them both flowing. And we've got good circulation in the cockpit. If it looks good to you down there, we're in good shape up here.
1752050|CC|Looks fine. See you later.
1752055|CDR|Okay, we thank you much.
1752107|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 175 hours 21 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The crew of Challenger has signed off for the night, climbing into their hammocks. The Commander, Gene Cernan in the upper berth, Lunar Module Pilot, Jack Schmitt in the lower hammock, scheduled 8 hours sleep period, wakening shortly after noon, today. Command Module America currently in a 67.8 minus 54.9 nautical mile orbit. Command Module Pilot, Evans has 4 hours and 22 minutes remaining of his sleep-period before being awakened, for plane-change maneuver and a trim maneuver, to get in the proper orbital plane for rendezvous. And at 175:22 taking down the air-ground 1 line, until somebody wakes up, this is Apollo Control.
1760701|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 176 hours 7 minutes Ground Elapsed Time in the mission of Apollo 17. Command Module America about 1/3 of the way through frontside pass on revolution 45. Fifty-two minutes remaining until America coasts behind the moon. The crew aboard Challenger, meanwhile is settling in for 8 hours scheduled sleep period which will end shortly after noon today, central time. Three hours 37 minutes remaining in the Command Module pilot's sleep period. Command Module America presently in a lunar orbit measuring 55.1 nautical miles at pericynthion by 67.7 nautical miles apocynthion. Gold team of flight controllers settled in for a 12 hour shift today, on a quick turn around. And at 176:08 Ground Elapsed Time this is Apollo Control.
1780702|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 178 hours 7 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Command module, America, at the present time on the 46th lunar orbit immediately over the Taurus-Littrow landing site where the crew of Challenger has approximately 5-1/2 hours remaining in their sleep period. Evans, meanwhile, has some hour and 37 minutes remaining in his scheduled sleep period before a wakeup call is made. For the coming day's activity, including a trim maneuver to tune up the command module's orbit and a plane change maneuver to place the command module in the proper orbital plane for the rendezvous which will take place after the lunar module has lifted off the lunar surface and is placed back into orbit around the Moon. The command module spacecraft systems are are all functioning normally at this time according to the the flight controllers here in the Control Center. Some 49 minutes remaining until America goes behind the Moon. At 178:08 Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
1794112|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 179 hours 41 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. About a minute until we have lock-on with the Command Module America on the 47th revolution around the Moon. Shortly after we have good solid lockup, the Spacecraft Communicator Ken Mattingly will call Ron Evans on Air-Ground 2 circuit for a wakeup. We'll bring that up at that time. Meanwhile the crew in the lunar module, Challenger, is still asleep at this time, with some 3 hours remaining until they're awakened. Standing by for word that we've locked onto the Command Module downlink. We've had acquisition. We'll bring up Air-Ground 2 and standby for the wakeup call to Command Module America.
1794502|CC|Good morning, America. Rise and shine.
1794614|CC|Hello, America, this is Houston. Over.
1794630|CMP|Hey, Houston, this is the Command Module Pilot on the United States spaceship, America. I'll be ready to go to work as soon as I can get untangled.
1794641|CC|Okay. We got plenty of that for you.
1794646|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. I think I woke up just about the time - just before you called, for some reason.
1794911|CMP|VHF is OFF.
1795059|CMP|Houston, at least it's daylight today. Yesterday you got me up in the middle of the night.
1795105|CC|Oh, this is a gentleman's day.
1795110|CMP|(Chuckle) Right.
1795138|CMP|Of course, I guess it's really a 2-hour day when you go around the Moon, isn't it?
1795145|CC|You don't get so tired that way.
1795149|CMP|(Laughter) Right.
1795230|CMP|Okay. S-BAND MODE is to VOICE, SQUELCH is - says "OFF"; I want to leave it ENABLED. Crew report, I'll get in a minute and wind your watch.
1795502|CMP|Houston, America. If you happen to have a summary report of EVA-3, I'd sure like to hear it.
1795512|CC|Okay. We'll do that. Let me give you a - a quick rundown on review of what we're going to do this morning. We've got the extra RCS trim burn that's going to be coming in, and I've got a pad for that guy. And I have about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 one-liners to go into your Flight Plan, to bring it up to date. The general plan is to do a minus-X RCS on the trim maneuver, in order to avoid impinging on the SIM bay. That burn will be about 30 seconds worth. And that's going to give you about 9 foot per second DELTA-V. The maneuvers have all been checked out, and it's a reasonable timeline. And so, I have both the plane change and the trim pads for you. And that may cut into your eat period just a little bit. So, you might keep that in mind, that when you get a chance to nibble; that's probably a good - good thing to be doing. And then once we finish the plane change, we - we're going to be back on the nominal Flight Plan, and pressing on in a - just like we have been. We'll be leaving the mapping camera in and taking pictures with it still retracted, in a attempt to avoid increasing the number of cycles on the camera. And we'll be running the SPS PU valve in the decreased position, in order to optimize our propellant loadings.
1795643|CMP|Ah ha! Okay. That sounds like ... good.
1795650|CC|So, when you're ready to copy some of those things, that's - Might be a good thing to get started on. Go ahead and finish squaring away your cockpit. And, while they're putting together an official summary, I can tell you my unofficial summary of EVA-3 is that that sure is super. You've got to watch those tapes when you get down. That's really a - that's really a spectacular place, as you can probably see. And they found a lot of - -
1795716|CMP|Oh, it really is.
1795716|CC|- mighty interesting rocks there. Jack, being a true geologist, is making up new geological terms as he goes along.
1795737|CMP|(Laughter) I can - yep, I bet.
1795748|CC|What you ought to do is, when he gets aboard, you ought to tell him that you saw a bunch of vertical dikelets over on the north side of the massif. Tell him they were very dark, very small.
1795801|CMP|Vertical dikelets?
1795803|CC|Yes, I think that's the word he coined on the way down there.
1795806|CMP|Dikelets? Oh, okay (laughter).
1795813|CMP|Hey, I got a Update Book here. I guess it'll be good for a trim burn - trim ...
1795821|CC|Okay. In general, let me tell you also that your RCS is 4.7 above the Flight Plan. And, just in a summary, unless you want to plot them, I'll just tell you that the oxygen and the hydrogen are doing good things. And you've got plenty of it. And I'm ready to give you a - The first pad will be a trim RCS burn and the second one will be the plane change burn.
1795856|CMP|Okay. No, that's good on the hydrogen and oxygen. And, I'm ready to copy the trim P30 pad.
1795905|CC|Okay. I'll give you the trim. RCS/G&N; 37416; GET 181:34:01.22; plus 0009-2, all zips, and all zips; roll 180, 179, 316; 0067.3, plus 0062.4; 0009.2, 0:30, 0009.2; 13, 292.3, 299. And at Sirius and Rigel, 118, 159, 349. This will be four jets, minus-X on the RCS. And, I'd like to just add a comment here about the attitude. This attitude is one that's computed after you've gone to the plane-change REFSMMAT. And when you call P41, you'll be getting a different set of attitudes computed out of it because of the P41 computing a plus-X burn. But, when you're in attitude and P41's called, and you get to the DELTA-V register, you should be able to put all of the DELTA-V in one axis.
1800048|CMP|Oh, okay. This really is a posigrade burn is what you're saying. And I really won't be able to trim it?
1800057|CC|I'm not sure I understood your comment there.
1800103|CMP|Well, in other words, we're not - we're not faking NOUN 81. You know, like we do on the SEP maneuver.
1800113|CC|Oh. That's - that's correct. You're going to see the numbers go to zero during the burn.
1800123|CMP|Okay. Real good. We just won't - ... won't be the right attitude. We'll use the VERB 29 maneuver and use that attitude.
1800132|CC|That's correct. And when you get there, that should put it all in - in the X-axis.
1800138|CMP|Okay. Mighty fine.
1800142|CC|Now I'm ready for the readback.
1800144|CMP|Oh, let me read it back. Okay, it'll be G&N/RCS for the trim burn. Weight, is 37416; TIG is 181:34:01.22. I'm not sure on the seconds. Is that correct?
1800200|CC|That's correct.
1800204|CMP|Okay. NOUN 81 plus 9.2 in X, 0 and 0, roll, 180; pitch, 179; yaw, 316; Ha will be 67.3, PERIGEE, 62.4; DELTA-V total is 9.2; burn time is 30 seconds; DELTA-Vc, is 9.2. Sextant star is 13, shaft is 292.3, trunnion is 29.9. That'll be Sirius and Rigel, 118, missed the pitch align and the yaw align is 349. It'll be four jets, minus-X, and it'll be at the plane change REFSMMAT.
1800248|CC|Okay. And that pitch align is 159.
1800256|CMP|Okay. Pitch align, 159.
1800259|CC|Okay. The next one will be the plane change, and I'll have that ready in just a second.
1800313|CMP|Okay. I'm in the Flight Plan for that one.
1800316|CC|Okay. Stand by, just a second.
1800353|CC|Okay. LOPC SPS/G&N; 37416; plus 0.38, plus 0.92; 182:33:53.00; minus 0017.9, minus 0365.5, minus 0006.9; roll, 0; pitch, 0; yaw, 315; 0062.7, plus 0062.6; 0366.0, 0:20, 0353.8: 22, 148.9, 19.5; Sirius and Rigel and the roll, pitch, and yaw aligns are the same: l18, 159, 349. This will be four jets and 12 seconds.
1800525|CMP|Okay. LOPC, SPS/G&N, 37416; plus 0.38, plus 0.92; Tig 182:33:53.00; NOUN 81 is minus 17.9, a minus 365.5, and a minus 6.9; roll, 0; pitch, 0; yaw, 315; HA, 62.7, perigee, 62.6 - that's pretty circular - DELTA-V total is 366.0. Burn time is 20 seconds, DELTA-Vc, 353.8; sextent star 22, shaft 148.9 and 19.5; Sirius and Rigel, 118, 159, 349; four jets, 12 seconds.
1800620|CC|Okay. It's a good readback. And, I've got a couple of Flight Plan things to give you when you're ready for that.
1800634|CMP|Okay. I'm with you.
1800636|CC|Okay. The first one is at 180 hours and 20 minutes. And -
1800650|CMP|Okay, I've got it.
1800651|CC|Okay. We owe you an attitude there and the attitude will be: 179, 222, 359. The HIGH GAIN: pitch, minus 39; yaw, 145. Why don't you read them back, individually as we go along?
1800714|CMP|Okay. Roll, 179; pitch, 222; yaw, 359. HIGH GAIN will be minus 39 and 145.
1800722|CC|Okay. And that's the - that's at 180:20. That's with the VERB 49 there. The next one is at 181:35 - -
1800728|CMP|Yes, that's right.
1800729|CC|- which is on the next page, and it's going to be at VERB 49, maneuver to LOPC. What we're going to do here is two separate maneuvers. We're going to do a maneuver which is a roll, so that when you do the next one, you'll avoid the gimbal lock because of the direction that the CMC would normally maneuver you. So, this maneuver is going to be in two parts. The first one we're calling a VERB 49 maneuver to the gimbal lock avoidance attitude at 181:35. That attitude 081, 181, and 317. The HIGH GAIN: PITCH, minus 19; YAW, 227, and AUTO and NARROW for AOS.
1800845|CMP|Okay, at 181:35, we'll have a VERB 49 to gimbal lock avoidance; roll 081, 181, and 317. HIGH GAIN will be a PITCH of minus 19, and YAW, 227; AUTO and NARROW for AOS.
1800904|CC|Okay. Now at 181:43, you can just skip that high gain call out. At 181:45, we want to add a VERB 49 maneuver to the LOPC burn attitude.
1800932|CMP|Okay. At 181:45, VERB 49 to LOPC burn attitude.
1800938|CC|Okay. Now on the next page, we go over to 182:15. And, I want to add a PU VALVE to DECREASE.
1800955|CMP|182:15. PU VALVE to DECREASE.
1801006|CC|All right, sir. And I have two more to give you, but before we do that - now about let's terminate the jet monitor by calling P30 - P20, and a VERB 21 NOUN 26 to all zips, and then we can up-link while we're finishing it.
1801042|CMP|Okay. You have ACCEPT.
1801049|CC|Okay. And you got the monitor terminated?
1801054|CMP|Yes. It's terminated.
1801107|CMP|I guess it went to P30 faster than it showed up down there or went into P30 not through it.
1801124|CC|Okay, why don't you put the PAN CAN1ERA to STANDBY and POWER, ON, while we're about it and we can let them look at that stuff while we're getting the rest of our Flight Plan updates?
1801139|CMP|PAN CAMERA, STANDBY; POWER is ON,
1801142|CC|Okay, thank you.
1801146|CC|All right. Let's go back to our updates and the next one should come at 182:44.
1801204|CMP|Okay. 182:44.
1801209|CC|Okay. At 182:44, I want to delete the "MAPPING CAMERA, EXTEND."
1801223|CMP|Okay. Delete the "MAPPING CAMERA, EXTEND." Wait a minute. I scratched out the opening the cover. We got to do that.
1801230|CC|Yes. You won't do that because we're going to the pictures anyhow.
1801236|CMP|Yes. Okay.
1801239|CC|Okay. Then the next thing we want to do is at 132:48 just a half inch down, I have a new attitude for you. Where it says 097, 068, 019, it's now going to be 096, 097, and 352; and the orb rate attitude is still all zeros.
1801314|CMP|Okay. The attitude after the P20 option 5 plus-X forward will be 096, 097 and 352 and orb rate is 0.
1801323|CC|Okay, that last angle was 352. I'm not sure we got that right.
1801330|CMP|Okay. 352 for Yaw. That's correct.
1801333|CC|All right, sir. And while we're about it, why don't you take the PAN CAMERA POWER back OFF?
1801350|CMP|Okay. Pan cam - pan ca - PAN CAMERA POWER is OFF (laughter).
1801355|CC|Okay, and as long as we're talking about pan cameras, let's go to 183:45,
1801409|CMP|183:45. Okay.
1801412|CC|Okay, and after the pan camera block, want to add "V OVER H OVERRIDE to HIGH ALTITUDE."
1801429|CMP|Okay. After "PAN CAMERA, STANDBY, STEREO, and POWER," put "V OVER H to HIGH ALTITUDE."
1801434|CC|That's affirmative. And the last update is on the next page - 184:27. And it says "MAPPING CAMERA, RETRACT" and since we didn't extend it you don't have to retract it.
1801450|CMP|Sounds logical. Okay, mapping camera, delete the "MAPPING CAMERA, RETRACT."
1801457|CC|All right, sir. And let's see what else we have here - how about running your paw over most of your biomed sensors? Looks like you've got some noise on there. And avoid changing them. Why don't you just kind of rub on each one and see if we can get it to come in a good signal?
1801519|CMP|Okay. I'll do that.
1801546|CC|Okay. You're making progress there.
1801551|CMP|Hey, it's working, huh?
1801636|CMP|Hey, there's old Hadley Rille out there. That's a pretty deep little trough. Hey, you really didn't get a perspective of that thing, at least I didn't from some of the pictures. Not until you had a chance to get up here and take a look at some of the other things.
1801657|CC|Okay, I'll tell you when we get through - -
1801659|CMP|Okay, that's the last of the Flight Plan things, huh?
1801702|CC|Yes, sir; that was the last of the Flight Plans, and I still need a morning report from you and things like that; and I'll keep an eye on the clock down here and try to help you stay on the timeline. The one thing that I see that may have to change is - I gave you a DELTA-Vc for the RCS burn that wasn't very useful, and we have to set it up to count in the other direction. There's a couple of things you do - like set it to 100.
1801728|CMP|(Laughter) Yes, okay.
1801734|CC|It's just a backup monitor anyhow and so it's - setting it to 100 is probably the first thing to do.
1801739|CMP|Yes, that's right.
1801751|CMP|Okay. Let me see if I've got time to put some hot water in my eggs.
1801757|CC|Okay.
1801828|CC|Okay, Ron, the computer is yours when - whenever you want to go to BLOCK.
1801842|CMP|Sleep last night was probably about 6 hours - kind of intermittent - but it seemed to me like when I was sleeping I was sleeping pretty good. For some reason, I woke up a couple or 3 hours after I went to sleep and I got to sleep about an hour late. Oh, and I was just itching like a son of a gun.
1801908|CC|What's that, the sensors?
1801909|CMP|The only thing I can think of is that - no, my arms - you know my forearms.
1801916|CC|Oh, I see.
1801916|CMP|From the wrist back to the elbow.
1801918|CC|Okay.
1801920|CMP|The only thing I can think, of is maybe the old Beta cloth itch, you know. Then I looked around and there was nothing there. You know, no hives or anything like that. So I got out some of that carry cream and put that on and that stopped it and went back to sleep.
1801940|CC|Okay. And, it's coming up on time to start our - our first VERB 49 maneuver which can be running and I'll watch the angles while you put a little hot water in your food there if you want to.
1802007|CMP|Okay, I've got a target load, I guess, in desired orientation. Okay, 2, VERB 49 ENTER, VERB 25. Plus 179.00, ENTER; plus PITCH 22 - 222.00 ENTER, YAW 359 plus 359.00 ENTER. Okay, we're still saying 2/10ths of a degree per second; PROCEED to ... keys - PROCEED.
1802057|CC|Okay, and the HIGH GAIN to AUTO, please.
1802104|CMP|HIGH GAIN is in AUTO and we'll set that at minus 39 YAW 145, just in case it breaks lock.
1802232|CMP|Hey, Ken, I'n going to be off the headset here while I change hack to my comm. carrier.
1802237|CC|All right., sir,
1802516|CMP|Okay. My PRD is 15044.
1802521|CC|Copy that.
1802528|CMP|... Those are easy to fix.
1802550|CMP|I had three jugs of water.
1802719|CMP|Okay. We're going ATT 1/RATE 2. Yes. Oh. Star number 11 - Aldebaran.
1802744|CC|You lucked out.
1802748|CMP|Yes. That's a good one.
1802810|CMP|It's a little ways off.
1802830|CMP|Okay. PROCEED, it was Aldebaran. ... Dnoces. To Dnoces. 6. Dnoces is hard to recognize through the telescope. Must be it. Yes, that was it.
1802938|CC|How about that?
1802943|CMP|Okay. ... for some torquing angles. Plus 173.5.
1803000|CC|Okay, got those.
1803004|CMP|Okay, We'll torque at 30 10.
1803007|CC|All right.
1803027|CMP|52 - 52 ENTER. We want to do an option 1 tc the LOPC orientation. Okay? Let's see, 622, 180 - that's a pretty neat - isn't that where I'm supposed - and 8179 and 316. Outstanding! Okay, it's dark out there, and I think I could find a star if I had to.
1803110|CC|Okay, I copied the angles for you if you need them.
1803116|CMP|Okay. It scares me everytime that light comes on. Ah ha! it went away. ... What the coarse align error is. ... Just barely in the sextant's field of view.
1803226|CC|Okay.
1803232|CMP|I don't know. That wasn't a very good mark. Let's try that again. Let's try Dnoces again. Pretty logical since we're in this attitude. But we didn't gauge our -
1803257|CC|Okay. And the angles I copied last time were 217 on the shaft and 33 on the trunnion.
1803310|CMP|That's close. Just in the sextant again.
1803344|CMP|Looks like 217 and 33's going to be it once you get it in there. I'll settle for that. There's the old coarse align error. I'll let you copy those down there. I don't want them up here.
1803415|CC|Okay.
1803419|CC|And you can torque any time.
1803421|CMP|And let's see - Okay; we'll torque at 3430.
1803427|CC|Okay; that's a good number.
1803521|CMP|Ah ha! Knows exactly where it is, Okay.
1803526|CC|Isn't that amazing?
1803530|CMP|Yes.
1803534|CC|And it shows we even know how to calculate the burn attitude.
1803540|CMP|Yes. That's good. ...
1803635|CMP|Okay. We're CMC, RATE 2, Here.
1803740|CMP|Okay. Count -
1803759|CC|And, Ron, I just noticed that in all our scribbling, I missed the line that said "Configure for the dump" on the previous column about 23. I don't Know if you saw it in there or not.
1803816|CMP|I missed it. I'll sure get it.
1803831|CC|And when it's convenient for you, I've got - -
1803834|CMP|Okay.
1803834|CC|- - couple of hydrogen tank fans to change and the good docs would like to hear how you're eating and pushing pills.
1803848|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. Took a Seconal last night, and I'm by the H2 fans.
1803856|CC|Okay. And that's HYDROGEN tank 3: FANs, OFF; and HYDROGEN tank 1: FANs, ON.
1803907|CMP|Okay, number 3 went from AUTO to OFF, tank 1 is going from OFF to ON.
1803914|CC|Very good.
1803921|CMP|Let's see, I got that done - at 40, next thing we got coming up, huh? Okay, I'll go down there and get some of this stuff configured. Oh, I ate just about everything yesterday, and then some other things on there, and a bunch of extra stuff too, so when I get a chance, I'll call that down. Okay?
1803945|CC|Sounds fine.
1803946|CMP|Getting ready for this urine dump. ...
1804626|CC|And Ron, we're coming up on dump time and don't forget we want to close the covers and that kind of good stuff before we start the dump.
1804638|CMP|Okay. UV cover is clo - Let's see - UV is OFF. IR is OFF.
1804706|CMP|That's. Yes, I start on old fuel call purge here. Do this O2 fuel cell purge. Okay. Now let's see, waste -
1804815|CMP|MARK it. The old waste water dump is on.
1804818|CC|Okay.
1804826|CMP|DRAIN VALVE is DUMP; BATTERY VENT is CLOSED.
1804949|CC|Okay, Ron, the EECOM's calculated about 12 minutes to go on your dump, and it, wouldn't hurt to set your kitchen clock or whatever you do to help remind yourself because that'll be after LOS. And we've taken a look at all of the systems ana everything looks pretty good there and RETRO would like to remind you that the weight has changed on your trim pad and that has some implications to the way that computes the burn arcs and you want to he superprecise. And looks like everything is GO for a trim.
1805033|CMP|Okay, sounds good. I'll set my little ding-ding here for about 10 minutes.
1805038|CC|Why don't you try about 9? Charlie swears that it's no more than that.
1805053|CMP|I believe Charlie.
1805112|CMP|Want me to configure the DSU or are you going to set it up for me?
1805117|CC|Why don't you do that one?
1805122|CMP|Okay.
1805430|CC|And, Ron, we've got about a minute and a half to LOS and I never did give you a summary of the EVA - just a few quick particulars were that they got 7 plus 15 out of EVA-3. Got almost everything done, They had to delete Station 10 in order to make up time, but that's made up for by the fact that they found some more interesting things at other stops. And there was - I mentioned the dikelets, and there's some indication that they may have seen a dike or something of that nature over on the North Massif, And Jack went out and applied all his - his physical skills to the lunar surface gravimeter and that included jumping ana kicking and pounding and it still doesn't work. Guess we'll get them up about 183:45 and the only thing we've had to do on their Surface Checklist for launch day is just to scrub the P22 that was in there. And we're just going to drop that one to make up some time--and it looks like they ought to get about 8 hours sleep out of it. So looks like everybody is in good shape. And you've got just a few seconds to LOS. Keep your eye on the waste water and we'll see you.
1805549|CMP|Good. Thank you Ken.
1805549||BEGIN LUNAR REV 48
1805613|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal from the spacecraft America, going behind the Moon and nearing the end of revolution number 47. Now Ground Elapsed Time of 180 hours 56 minutes. Two hours 48 minutes remaining until Cernan and Schmitt, aboard the lunar module Challenger, awakened at Taurus-Littrow. And approximately 48 minutes until America comes around again, coming up on two maneuvers. Spacecraft communicator, Ken Mattingly, read up the PAD's or the data needed by the Command Module Pilot for performing these maneuvers. The first is a trim maneuver to tune up the command module orbit, prior to the lunar orbit plane change maneuver. The trim maneuver will be done on the back side of the Moon when we're out of contact with the spacecraft. That trim maneuver is scheduled at 181:34:01 or 181 hours 34 minutes 1 second Ground Elapsed Time. Total velocity change in posigrade - 9.2 feet per second. Burn time RCS - that's with the reaction control system engines - 30.06 seconds. And as Mattingly mentioned to Evans, it's being done in so called minus X direction. In other words the spacecraft will pitch over engine bell forward toward the direction of flight so that Evans will see where he's been instead of where he's going. And the RCS thrusters will fire forward so that the instruments in the SIM bay will not be damaged by the exhaust plume from the rearward firing engines. The effect is the same, however the spacecraft's performing the maneuver in a pitched over attitude and actually 180 degrees away from the original land direction. On the next front side pass, then, following that the scheduled lunar orbit plane change maneuver putting the command module America back into proper co-planer path with the landing site for rendezvous later today. This maneuver is scheduled at Ground Elapsed Time of 182:33:53. Total burn time on the SPS engine of 20.07 seconds, for a velocity change of 366 feet per second. This a burn that will force the plane of the orbit back to coincide with that of the lunar module as it makes its ascent from Taurus-Littrow back into orbit for the rendezvous sequence. The orbital measurements after the trim burn will be 67.3 nautical miles apocynthion by 62.4 at pericynthion. The plane change maneuver has also some retrograde component in it. A very slight retrograde component, which will Circularize the orbit at 62.7 nautical miles. At 181 hours even, this is Apollo Control.
1813955|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 181 hours 39 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Some 37 seconds now until the spacecraft, America, comes from behind the Moon on revolution 48. One of the first items in business on this pass will be a report by Command Module Pilot, Ron Evans, on the trim maneuver, which he will have completed just prior to acquisition on this rev. Two hours and 4 minutes remaining of the Challenger crew sleep period. Waiting now for word from network that the -
1814103|PAO|We've had acquisition now. We'll stand by for the initial calls.
1814133|CMP|Ah ha! Looks like we're getting you already.
1814154|CC|Hello there. How's it going?
1814200|CMP|Okay. Just now calling the VERB 82. It's 67.4 by 62.8. Okay. Let me give you a little burn report here - -
1814238|CC|All right.
1814238|CMP|- - ... reading on the burns, so you can get that off the recorder.
1814242|CC|Okay.
1814243|CMP|Let's see. Okay. With 30 seconds of burn time, by my stopwatch there, I ended up with a plus - no, let's see - with a minus - minus 0.5 X. I think 0 in Y and a plus 0.5 in Z. Okay, so I tweaked out the plus X and roiled right 90 degrees and burned a 0.6 in a plus-Y. Okay. With final trim of - on the NOUN 85s of 0 plus 0.1 and a minus 0.1. DELTA-Vc was a minus 110.4 but we had that - not a minus, a plus 110.4. But there's no bias check at a plus 0.9 - on the bias.
1814347|CC|Okay.
1814348|CMP|Okay, the NOUN 20 values - NOUN 20 values - after the 90 degree roll there and for the final trim were 270, 179, 317.
1814405|CC|Okay. Sounds like you're way ahead of the game.
1814411|CMP|Yes. Worked real fine.
1814415|CC|Have you had a chance to get anything to eat yet?
1814422|CMP|Yes, I ate some scrambled eggs and I'm nibbling on the bacon bars, and I had a - some orange juice.
1814430|CC|Okay, I wasn't trying to fish for a report, I was just trying to find out it you were still eating or how things were going.
1814436|CMP|(Laughter) I'm a little - I'm still eating a little bit. But we're in good shape.
1814442|CC|Okay. You get a - you get a medal for not over-dumping the waste water tank.
1814451|CMP|Yes. It's amazing.
1814454|CMP|The old 9-minute mark was right on. I set it at 8 minutes, just to be sure, and 1 minute later it was 10 percent. Tell Charlie he figured right.
1814507|CC|Well, we won't be able to talk to Dumis again.
1814512|CMP|(Laughter) That's right.
1814526|CC|Okay. And I don't remember if I explained - -
1814527|CMP|... star check.
1814529|CC|Yes. Okay. And I don't know if you've got an explanation on why your angles changed for the P20 business after the burn, but, this - this plane change burn is going to have a little orbit shaping in it as well as the previous one. So that it - it is going to have some components that are both radial and tangential.
1814601|CMP|Ah ha, okay.
1814604|CC|So that meant that your REFSMMAT wasn't quite the REFSMMAT that you were anticipating earlier. And that explains the - why those angles had to change on you and also explains some of those odd-ball components.
1814623|CMP|Okay. Okay. I was wondering about that but - I'll, tell you - those guys in the trench down there know so much more about what's going on when they calculate that stuff than I do that I'll - I'll believe them.
1814645|CC|Say, Ron, are you - are you in a place where you spare a minute or 2? is it convenient?
1814656|CMP|Sure.
1814657|CC|Okay. Got somebody that would like to talk to you for just a minute.
1814703|CMP|Oh, yes.
1814705|NASA|Ron, this is Jim Fletcher. How are you?
1814711|CMP|Yes, Dr. Fletcher - mighty fine, sir.
1814714|NASA|We had hoped to catch you last night but you were behind the Moon when the ceremony was going on. Did you catch any of it at all?
1814723|CMP|Well, I - I got the briefing, or the report from it from the CAPCOM, but it sounds like it was a mighty fine ceremony and something that this nation can really be proud of.
1814740|NASA|Well, Ron, there's one thing that the President wanted to make sure that you got. And I had hoped to do it last night. We've been in very close touch with the White House and the President has been following closely what - what's going on up there and, of course, it's absolutely fascinating to us down here. But he wanted to be sure that you understood that he'd like to wish you Godspeed as you return to Earth. And I must say I'd like to add that and also add that, from everything I've heard, this is a spectacular success.
1814824|CMP|Well, thank you very much, there, Dr. Fletcher, and please convey my thinks to Mr. President. I appreciate that very much, and I - I also appreciate the opportunity to be able to do something for my country and I - hopefully, this is the one thing that I will be able to do. And I certainly appreciate it. Just the thoughts, themselves, really.
1814849|NASA|Well, very, good, Ron. I'd just like to say that I - I've never - I've never had any idea whatsoever that things would go so well in the scientific part of the - of the orbital science. It's - it's almost unbelievable when I talk to the guys in the backroom, and I just wanted to make sure that you knew that I knew it.
1814915|CMP|Yes, sir. We certainly do and they worked real hard to get the - these experiments and the equipment all squared away. I was following along with them pretty well and I had lot of confidence.
1814929|NASA|Well, very good. Thanks kindly.
1814934|CMP|Yes, sir. Dr. Fletcher; appreciate it.
1814938|CC|And, Ron, how about the high gain?
1814946|CMP|Okay. Let me reset it here, I guess.
1815014|PAO|That was NASA Administrator, Dr. James C. Fletcher.
1815020|CMP|Okay. I'm in REACQ and NARROW now.
1815038|PAO|He was passing along a similar message to the one that he spoke to the crew in Challenger on yesterday while Evans was apparently behind the Moon, or at least out of contact on that particular circuit.
1815152|CC|And how about AUTO on the HIGH GAIN when you get a chance?
1815158|CMP|Okay, I'm right there, so we've got her.
1815203|CC|Okay, and let's see we've got a few minutes. I had - I had two more magazine changes to go into the Flight Plan if it's convenient to give them to you now.
1815216|CMP|Let me get started on the other VERB 49 here, okay?
1815220|CC|Okay, just fine.
1815238|CMP|315. Plus ENTER - plus - and one more PROCEED.
1815302|CMP|Okay, we're on our way.
1815316|CC|Okay, Ron, just for your information, about 291 looks like the maximum yaw you ought to see on this. And we'll keep an eye on it for you.
1815327|CMP|Okay. 203. Okay, why don't we take some of those Flight Plan changes here?
1815407|CC|Okay. And these are real simple ones on page 283.
1815416|CMP|283. You're really looking ahead. Okay.
1815429|CC|Okay, at 187:45, you've got a magazine Bravo Brave called out and we'd like to make that Delta Delta.
1815443|CMP|Delta Delta it is.
1815445|CC|Okay, and a couple of lines below that you have a magazine November November which we want to change to Kilo Kilo.
1815455|CMP|Kilo it is.
1815457|CC|Okay, that was kind of painless, wasn't it?
1815502|CMP|Yes, that was.
1815506|CC|And that's all I've got. We want to remember to get the PU VALVE to DECREASE.
1815514|CMP|Yes, I could do that now, I guess, couldn't I?
1815517|CC|Okay.
1815522|CMP|Okay, we're setting on the minus 200-DECREASE.
1815606|CMP|Got a time here and let me bring you up to date on the - lookout.
1815814|CMP|Okay. Ready to go on the food?
1815817|CC|Yes, sir.
1815819|CMP|Looks like we're going to miss it.
1815822|CMP|Okay. Day 8: sausage, grits, fruit cocktail, orange beverage, coffee, and tea, and a vitamin. Next box: ham - couldn't find my cheese until last night so I didn't have it, one rye bread, can of peaches or sack of peaches, cereal bar, orange drink, coffee, graham cracker cubes, apricot cubes, jelly candy, sugar cookies. Supper: had hamburger and ketchup, vanilla pudding, grape drink; I guess that was it.
1815939|CC|All right, sir. We've got about 34 minutes or so until the burn. I've got a news summary I can read if you'd like to have that or if you'd like to put it off until later I can do that too.
1820003|CMP|No, why don't you go ahead?
1820006|CC|I'll just read it and if I start to bother you, why just holler at me and I'll stop.
1820014|CMP|Okay.
1820015|CC|This is put together by a - a Mr. Jim Kokowsky [?] and it looks like he's done a pretty nice job of summarizing the news, so I'm going to read it cold. And he's given us a summary of the late news. And the weather couldn't be worse in Houston. It had to be better on the Moon or in orbit around it. This morning more cold and drizzle blanketed the Houston metropolitan area. Yesterday morning it was 32 degrees. This morning a little warmer but a lot wetter, and it's getting colder on Friday. On the national-international scene: Peace talks in Paris between Dr. Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho have ended - at least for the time being. Dr. Kissinger is in Washington today to brief President Nixon on the talks. The past 3-1/2 weeks, the pair of negotiators have held 58 hours of talks. Neither side is giving out any hints. When asked about the cease-fire by Christmas, Dr. Kissinger told reporters at Andrews, "I don't want to make any predictions." The U.S. by sizeable vote has had its assessment to the fund of the United Nations reduced by a vote of 81 to 27. The U.S. will now pay only 25 percent of the cost rather than the present 31 percent. Transatlantic fares may drop beginning in February. The International Air Transport Association says all carriers will set their own prices. It appears that air travelers to Europe next year may get some real bargains. In the hotly contested and federally supervised United Mine Workers election, the insurgent candidate, Arnold Miller, has gone into a lead over incumbent President Tony Boyle. Miller has led a grass roots movement to oust Boyle who took over the union control from the late John L. Lewis. We mentioned the rather dismal weather in the Houston area this morning, but the midwest and northeast are really getting some bad weather. Ice storms seriously hampered the northern part of the nation, from Idaho to the eastern seaboard. After almost a year, troops involved in the India-Pakistani War are beginning to go back to their homelands. Truce-line maps have been exchanged and approved by both governments. Civil servants of the European Common Market, they're called Eurocrats, are on strike. The 8000 employees walked off the job due to a salary dispute. On the regional and local scene: the Houston City council has vetoed a plan to build a nev commuter airstrip in southwest Houston for the STOL aircraft. Residents of the area have been protesting. The community of Tomball, north of Houston, is looking for a new police force. The police chief and seven officers walked off the job Tuesday, after the City Council refused the officers a pay raise. In Harris County, the State Highway Patrol end reserve police have been called in to maintain police protection. That's maintain protection in Tomball. The project to expend the - expand the Armand Bayou as a park and wildlife refuge has been given a boost with a $100,000 pledge. So far $350,000 has been pledged and $750,000 is needed to gain Federal matching funds. Galveston will hold a school bond election on February 3rd. The bonds, if okayed, will be used to air-condition all schools not so equipped and to improve lighting in two schools. It's a light day in sports; the head coaching job for SMU is open, being considered are North Carolina coach Bill Dooley, and Washington coach Jim Owens. George Blanda, a living testimony for the over-40 set will become the oldest man ever to play football this Sunday. Prior to Blanda, I guess, we've had some other folks, but this ought to be a new record. In pro basketball, Houston didn't play last night. Currently, Baltimore, Boston, Milwaukee, and Los Angeles lead the divisions. In pro hockey, Alberta beat the Houston Aeros, 3 to 2. The big news in Houston sports is a City Council approval of the Greenway Plaza as a site for the 10-l/2-million-dollar sports arena. And finally in - Christmas shopping is in full swing. Christmas trees are in tents, on street corners, and supermarket sites all over the area. Private homes throughout the whole area are lighting up with decorations ranging from happy Santa Clauses in sleighs to nativity scenes. It will be a Christmas world waiting for you when you come home. And that ends our summary for this morning.
1820454|CMP|That's a good summary; appreciate it. Little bit of everything in there.
1820501|CC|Yes, it looks like Mr. Kokowsky [?] reads a lot of newspapers there.
1820508|CMP|(Laughter) He sure did.
1820529|CC|Okay, Ron. We're picking up some thermal problems on the pan camera. Would you manually roll left 30 degrees and we'll hold it until we've passed - you know the terminator - or cross the terminator.
1820543|CMP|Okay.
1820605|CC|And, Ron, that terminator crossing comes fairly close to the burn, so you might think about - if it looks agreeable to you, just go ahead and we'll use that as the burn attitude. You'll have to get a new P40 trim to take care of the gimbal offsets. So you may see a slight Pitch and Yaw attitude change.
1820628|CMP|Okay; that's no problem. I'll just roll left and then use a P41 trim. (Cough)
1820716|CMP|I hit ACCEL COMMAND to make that 90-degree roll the other day, or just a while ago. And, if you hit your stick a little too hard, you really wrapped it up to a little better than a degree a second. So, you can really get a sensation of roll, especially when you can see the Moon.
1820800|CMP|How's that? Pretty good attitude?
1820803|CC|Looks like we're going to have to go a little bit further. Why don't you give us 5 or 10 more?
1820810|CMP|Okay, I didn't let go of the stick -
1820813|CC|You're learning our tricks, aren't you?
1820817|CMP|(Laughter) Used a teacup of gas there.
1820827|CC|Okay, now - now, you're in good shape.
1820833|CMP|Okay, we'll stop it right there, then. About 35 degrees or so.
1820908|SC|Anything to make you happy.
1821021|CMP|Okay. I just made a DELTA-V check while ago and it was minus 22.2. Bias check was a mi - let's see, went from 100 to 100.9 in a minute and 40.
1821037|CC|Okay.
1821040|CMP|... RATE 2; auto RCS, a little light. And let's see - Okay, we'll turn off six ... Let's see, the DELTA-Vc is - 353.8 for the DELTA-Vc. Okay; SIM bay I checked it a while ago, 3MAGs are RATE 2, AUTO RCS SELECTS are okay. Okay. ... 7416, that's pretty good. Okay, plus 0.38 and a plus 0.92. That's all right. Okay, VERB - Load my own, I guess, it looks like, don't I?
1821250|CC|Yes, sir. When they gave you the up-link, they had to put in the - the trim burn.
1821257|CMP|Yes, that's right. Plus 180.2 ENTER. Plus - 182:33:53 ... - -
1821315|CC|Looks good.
1821315|CMP|- - all right. 25, ENTER. Okay; NOUN 81s, 15.9, minus 17. Okay; Y is a minus 365.5. Z - 9 - minus 9 ENTER. Okay; 17.9; 365.5 minus 6.9, PROCEED.
1821358|CC|Okay, they look good here.
1821400|CMP|(Cough) Okay.
1821421|CMP|The computer thinks we're going tc be circular, 63.0 by 63.0. Of course, that's impulsive, I guess. 366.0 for total, that's right. Okay. 19 - on the DET. Okay, I got the DET going. I think my sextant star check's not going to be any good here.
1821510|CC|Okay, we can give you another one here if you'd like that.
1821515|CC|They been scurrying around here, and got you some new numbers.
1821517|CMP|I don't see any reason - Oh really? I'll do it just for the heck of it.
1821523|CC|Okay - -
1821525|CMP|Got time here - let's see, 19 minutes - -
1821530|CC|Okay - -
1821531|CMP|... I'll just let you read them to me as I get ...
1821532|CC|All right, sir, it's a shaft of 237.2, when you get there.
1821552|CMP|Okay. Plus - What did you say it was? Shaft -
1821554|CC|237.20.
1821601|CMP|237.20 ENTER. Okay. Trunnion?
1821609|CC|Okay. That's 27.480.
1821622|CMP|Okay. We're CMC. Optics are - ... No, it's the wrong calculation (laughter). ...
1821657|CC|Okay, well, we're off in roll - -
1821658|CMP|What star's it supposed to be - -
1821700|CC|- - by a degree from where he calculated it.
1821707|CMP|Okay.
1821710|CC|It's supposed to be good old star number 22.
1821720|CMP|Oh, I can't see squat in the telescope. Hey, there it is. There it is.
1821724|CC|Okay, you're passing through the right roll angle so it - -
1821726|CMP|Okay; yes, that's it.
1821730|CC|Okay.
1821731|CMP|Outstanding!
1821735|CMP|Okay, VERB 37 ENTER, 00 ENTER. DIRECT and HIGH MANUAL. ... Optics zeros. Okay. Put those things up for a minute. (Humming) Okay. There. (Cough) 358 and 314, that didn't change very much Okay.
1821842|CMP|Okay, it says we're there. Set IMU.
1821934|CMP|Ah, wrong pitch. Acts just like the simulator, you can't tell, I thought when you got in the spacecraft that if you're 180 ... it's supposed to flop back and forth, but it doesn't do it. Okay; 326, 357.5, and about 315.4. Let's see, align the GDC.
1822103|CMP|(Cough) Okay. It's easy to see those lines. STAB CONTROL. DIRECT ULLAGE breakers are going IN. PITCH 1, YAW 1. Okay. ... and SPS breakers are IN; MANUAL ATTITUDE - RATE COMMAND. Okay, looks like about DEADBAND MIN RATE to LOW - ... is in RATE COMMAND. LM only. GIMBAL DRIVE is in AUTO. We're down to the 6-minute check. ... Okay, we won't have any manual starts on this one. Do not restart it. If it quits, we'll shut it down at burn time plus 1. V - Vg Y only. Back to zero and then trim Y, I guess. All axis - Y and Z just a little ... trim X. Okay, we scratched out the part - we're going to turn the tape recorder on, right?
1822349|CC|Yes, sir.
1822353|CMP|Okay.
1822401|CMP|At 12 seconds for ullage. Burn time was 20 seconds.
1822412|CC|Okay, and you're GO from this end.
1822417|CMP|Okay.
1822534|CMP|Hey, refresh my memory on the mission rules there, Ken, could you? If it doesn't start on bank A, do we start on bank B?
1822601|CC|Stand by. We're - we're making sure we're going to tell you the right thing, here.
1822608|CMP|Okay. I was a little confused about the no MANUAL STARTs. That's not a manual start to me, though.
1822638|CC|Okay, Ron. The rule says, "If no start on A, try B."
1822645|CMP|Okay. That's what I thought. (Humming) Plenty of battery juice here. Let's go to A; ON - and B, is ON and coming up - Okay, fuel cell 3, pressure is all right in 2-A; and 2-B is okay. And HELIUM VALVEs are in AUTO, we're in DECREASE; and the OXIDIZER FLOW VALVE PUGS MODE is PRIMARY. PRIMARY, DECREASED, and NORMAL. Okay. That's a lot of work. I'd like to get strapped in a little bit here.
1822804|CMP|Okay. Bus tie - I forgot the crazy tape recorder. COMMAND RESET - here we go. Okay. Helium valves, I did that. SERVO POWER 1. Okay - number 2, back to AC.
1822839|CMP|MARK DIRECTs are OFF. BMAGs are uncaged. Okay, no hardovers. Okay. Go to SCS. HAND CONTROLLER number 2 is ARMED. Okay. PITCH 1, got it; YAW 1, we got it. Okay. Trim is about set there; okay. Yaw is 0.9; PITCH is about - kazink, kazink, kazink, kazink. Okay; we have the trim. Okay. Give it back to the computer. Returns to zero. THC clockwise; no MTVC. Okay; PITCH 2; got it; YAW 2, got it. Ah ha! We have the trim plus point ... and - plus, plus, minus. Okay; give it back to the computer. No MTVC.
1822959|CMP|Okay; 3 minutes to go. THC. Okay. On the AC. DIRECTs are ON. Cage the old BMAGs. KEY RELEASE. PROCEED for the final trim. Got a 618. D-18 says we're there. Okay; we'll ENTER that. 204. Do you want a gimbal test option? Yes. Plus 2, minus 2, 0, plus 2, minus 2, 0. 3004. Okay; we have the trim with 3 minutes to go. Okay; LIMIT CYCLE'S back OFF. ... burn, we'll go RATE to HIGH (cough). DET looks good; we've got a 20-second burn. Shutdown on 21 seconds.
1823135|CMP|Okay. DELTA-V in STANDBY. Have CMC, GDC, RATE COMMAND; LIMIT CYCLE, OFF; DEADBAND, MIN; RATE to HIGH; TRANS CONTROL POWER is OFF. DIRECTs are both OFF; CMC, AUTO. Okay. There we go; missed one. ATT1/RATE 2 on the old BMAGs. RATE COMMAND; all four GIMBAL MOTORs are ON, We're CSM on the CG. ... LOGIC, ... ROLL, ROLL; Alpha; S-IVB. PITCH is AUTO; DET is working; ARMED, ARMED.
1823218|CMP|Okay; at 16, AUTO RCS SELECTs, ON; circuit breakers are still good (humming). Okay. I'm waiting for 30 seconds when ... the NORMAL TRANS CONTROL POWER and the DELTA-V THRUST A switch.
1823322|CMP|EMS G; EMS to NORMAL; TRANS CONTROL POWER is ON; and DELTA-V THRUST A is ON. Okay; four jets, 12 seconds. (Humming)
1823345|CMP|Okay; we have ullage. Okay; 699, PROCEED.
1823357|CMP|3 - oh - okay! There we go! We got ignition about 87. Okay; number 2 is coming ON; we're up to 90 on the DELTA-Vc. Wait a minute. Okay; 913. Looking good. Okay; ROLL ERROR is OFF. That's all right; we're done. 3,1 -
1823417|CMP|SHUTDOWN - automatic! Okay; minus 9.5 on the EMS. Okay; 366.8. Let's PROCEED to stop the rates here. 6.8. Okay; man, look at those 85s! I'm a little bit off, but that's good. Okay; PITCH 2; got it; YAW 2; got it; and, number 1, got it; number 1, got it. Okay; SERVO THRUST is OFF. Well, let's see. I've forgotten what it feels like. Ha! That's pretty neat. Okay; that was okay. Somehow we got a 0.3 in there. That's in X anyhow. Y is zero; that's what I want. Z is all right, so we'll just leave it that way. I'll PROCEED with the changes again. That just changed. Okay; 00 ENTER. Okay; VERB 6 NOUN 20 ENTER. Okay; I presume you're reading the DSKY, haven't you been, Houston?
1823545|CC|Yes, sir.
1823552|CMP|Two, three. The time, as near as I could tell, was pretty good. Vgx - what did I say - 366.8, I think. DELTA-Vs is a minus 9.5; tail off is 11 or something. 12.2. Okay; let's get some more switches off. TRANS CONTROL POWER - okay - LOCKED, LOCKED.
1823636|CMP|TRANS CONTROL POWERs are OFF; DIRECTs are OFF; DIRECT ULLAGE circuit breakers are OPEN; PITCH 1, YAW 1 are OPEN. Okay. EMS FUNCTION is OFF. MODE is STAND - RATE 2. Okay. We'll come and get the bus ties. (Humming) Hey, that was a neat burn ... (cough).
1823729|CC|Feels more like an airplane, that way, doesn't it?
1823735|CMP|Yes. Yes. It was kind of like an afterburner that time. Okay. A BAT BUS AC is OFF; BC is OFF. Not too bad. Okay; we're MAIN A. Must be a - little oxidizer is 0.6. Fuel is 28.4 ... and balance is minus - Now, let's see - about 460, I guess. Thing going in the right direction?
1823854|CC|We don't think the PUGs really ever stabilized.
1823859|CMP|I don't think it did, either. Okay; AC ROLL switches are OFF, now.
1823937|CC|And, Ron, we're ready to give you some new stuff in the computer whenever you're - pass by and can give us ACCEPT.
1823948|CMP|Okay. You have ACCEPT. While you're doing that, I'll do the post-SPS SIM prep cue card.
1823957|CC|All righty.
1824007|CMP|I'd really forgotten how that thing kicks you in the seat of the pants. I guess I must have been floating off the seat a little bit more this time than I was on the - the rest of the burns.
1824027|CMP|Okay. PAN CAMERA POWER is OFF; and the old LOGIC POWER should go to DEPLOY/RETRACT. Okay, ... down is A, down is B. DEPLOY/RETRACT. Got to inhibit all jets. Okay, we'll inhibit the - all except the ROLL, right now.
1824131|CMP|On - okay. I'll just inhibit the ROLL 1, DELTA 1, and then I can start the - Yes, here's the DAP now. You through with the computer?
1824211|CC|Okay. We're through. It's your computer.
1824217|CMP|Okay. And - ... two, ON - OFF now. CAMERA LASER ALTIMETER, OPEN. Barber pole in the gray. 20 ENTER, 22 ENTER, 5 ENTER, plus-X SIM bay att - 2.25 - 2 ENTER. We are going to use a 2-1/2-degree dead band this time. Fifty is around the Moon. Okay.
1824519|CMP|276 plus 2. ... (laughter) Different attitudes.
1824626|CMP|I think I'll make a cup of coffee.
1824742|CC|Ron, I've got your pan camera photo pad when you're ready.
1824749|CMP|Okay. I just happen to be ready to copy.
1824753|CC|Okay. T-start, 183:48:41; T-stop, 184:06:43.
1824809|CMP|Okay.
1825016|CMP|Ken, I'm just now remembering one of your comments from16 that we didn't get done on this extra comm carrier cloth - there's cloth here, you know.
1825038|CC|Uh huh.
1825038|CMP|Don't need any extra electronics, but we sure could use another cloth hat (laughter).
1825044|CC|Oh, you can wash it off. You probably do that inadvertently.
1825050|CMP|(Laughter) I already have. I didn't wash it with the right thing though.
1825054|CC|(Laughter) I was wondering if you would own up to that. Hey, the good Doctor over here says that your traces are flat lines. Thought you ought to be aware of that.
1825111|CMP|Oh, they are?
1825112|CC|You feel okay?
1825112|CMP|Well, let me - They're kind of itching it - They're kind of itch - Yes, I'm okay. But they're kind of itching anyhow. I feel like I ought to change them so -
1825122|CC|Okay. That would really make him happy.
1825135|CMP|No wonder they're flat lines - it's unplugged.
1825141|CC|Okay.
1825142|CMP|Said something sooner (laughter).
1825145|CC|All righty. We're about 4 minutes from LOS, and all systems have been looked at, and they're all looking okay. So, guess we'll see you on the tother [sic] side.
1825200|CMP|Okay. How's my stuff, now that I got plugged in.
1825209|CC|We don't see anything, yet.
1825213|CMP|Didn't, huh?
1825300|CMP|Well, I needed to change them anyhow so -
1825302|CC|Okay.
1825302|CMP|I'll try to -
1825304|CC|Looks like you hit something there when you did that.
1825322|CMP|I was just shaking my coffee.
1825328|CC|I tell you, it sure put life in the signal.
1825333|CMP|It did?
1825335|CC|How are those binoculars working out?
1825340|CMP|They're working real good. I find I have a bit of a problem holding them still, though.
1825348|CC|Yes, they're about the max magnification, I think, that you can hand hold.
1825356|CMP|Yes.
1825356|CC|Have you tried looking in earthshine at it? See if you can pick up anything there?
1825405|CMP|Yes. And they just don't quite look as - let enough light through, I don't think, in earthshine. In other-words, you can see better - with the naked eye; but they don't - they don't let enough light through the binocs to enhance your image capability at all.
1825425|CC|Okay. I was curious because I noticed in the - in the dark shadows in the daylight side, that they did bring out things that ycu couldn't see with the naked eye. I guess that's contrast that does that.
1825441|CMP|Yes, I noticed that too. Yes, ycu can look down in the shadow of a - of a crater, where you got the Sun down there, but if you have more backlighting or something. You know, but you can - you can see that pretty good with the naked eye, anyhow. Earthshine, now, about all I can get out of the earthshine, really, are differences in albedo. And you can get some textural - Well, not so much textural differences, but terrain bumps and humps, and flow fronts, and - see craters, you know?
1825522|CC|I wish I was there with you.
1825531|CMP|I tell you, I had no idea how interesting and how much fun it would be. After the first day, and I finally got over the - I guess you could - I don't know. You'd call it the effects of adapting to zero g or something. But you're just a little bit woozy. You really don't feel like doing a heck of a lot that first day up. So, it's good that the first day is kind of - -
1825609||BEGIN LUNAR REV 49
1825609|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The Command Module, America, passing behind the Moon on the end of the 48th lunar orbit. 48 minutes until the crew of Challenger is awakened at Taurus Littrow. During the just completed front side pass the Command Module Pilot Ron Evans completed the lunar orbit plain change maneuver which went nominally on time with a velocity change of 366 feet per second using the service propulsion system engine. Just prior to that before he appeared on the front side of the Moon a small trim maneuver was performed using the forward firing reaction control system thrusters. This maneuver was to trim up the orbit. Some dispursions that had grown during the lunar orbit period that America has been in motion about the Moon. The Gold Team of Flight Controllers is handing over at the moment to their replacements after about a 12-hour shift. The oncoming team is the White Team of Flight Controllers headed up by Eugene Krantz. There will not be a change of shift press briefing of the off going shift. 47 minutes to wake up of the surface crew, Schmitt and Cernan. And at 182:57 this is Apollo Control.
1833112|CDR|(singing) Good morning to you. Good morning to you. Good morning dear Gordy. Good morning to you.
1833112|LMP|(singing) Good morning to you. Good morning to you. Good morning dear Gordy. Good morning to you.
1833133|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 183 hours 32 minutes. We're about 14 minutes away from the scheduled wakeup time for Apollo 17 - the lunar module crew, however they beat us to the punch this morning and we just got a rousing rendition of "Good Morning To You" sung by the crew of Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt on the lunar surface. The Surgeon reports that the two crewmen appear to have gotten a good nights sleep - 6 to 7 hours, and we'll pick up with the taped replay of that Good Morning rendition from the crew and then follow it live, (music)
1833210|CC|(Music: Thus Spake Zarathrustra by R. Strauss)
1833314|CC|Good morning, Challenger and thank you for the vocal rendition from - from the Moon, there.
1833325|CDR|Well, we thank you for your kind music. We wanted to let you know we were thinking about you this morning, Gordie.
1833335|CC|You just beat us to it, but - -
1833337|CDR|That was a great song.
1833338|CC|Decided to play it anyway, because it's such a - such a pretty selection.
1833344|CDR|I think it's very apropo at the moment. I guess I can just wait for "Hail Purdue," huh?
1833355|CC|Yes, just stand by, you'll probably hear it before you get back.
1833403|CDR|Hey, we've been stirring for about 15 or 20 minutes. We're in the midst of a nice hamburger omelet (laughter) and assorted accessories. As a matter of fact, it's all over us. And if you'll give me 5 minutes, I'll be ready to go on the PGNS, unless you want to start it sooner.
1833439|CC|Okay, we'll - No hurry, finish up and get cleaned up there. And the only change, we have some change in the timing as far as the checklist so we can gain back the time we're behind now, which is actually less than an hour. And the only hardware change other than deletions is to - that we'd like you to leave Demand REG A, CLOSED, at all times. So whenever you come across a place that says OPEN at CABIN or EGRESS, we'd like you to leave it CLOSED.
1833522|LMP|Okay, Gordie. We've got you on that.
1833526|CDR|And, Gordie, could I have a quick status report on - on America and Challenger?
1833534|CC|You bet. America is just as good as gold, just like always. Ron got off the trim burn on the back side followed by a good plane change on the front side. In fact he - G&N cut-off was a tenth and - or less in all axes. Didn't even need to trim it. So, he's in about a 62-1/2 circular, I believe, and waiting for you to come up and join him.
1833608|CDR|Okay, how's his consumables?
1833615|CC|Stand by.
1833624|CC|Okay, America's consumables are great and so are yours. There is a possibility we may have to switch to ASCENT WATER, just prior to lift-off, but everything really is in good shape.
1833642|CDR|Those are good words, Gordie. Thank you.
1833649|LMP|Hey, Gordie. In honor of one of your comm handovers last night, and in the tradition of Apollo 8, I've got paraphrase of a familiar poem for you.
1833705|CC|Okay; go ahead.
1833711|LMP|Well, it's "The week before Christmas and all through the LM, not a commander was stirring, not even Cernan. The samples were stowed in their places with care, in hopes that with you, they soon will be there. And Cernan - Gene in his hammock and I in my cap, had just settled our brains for a long - short lunar nap. But out on the - up on comm loop there rose such a scatter, I sprang from my hammock, to see what was the matter. The Sun on the breast of the surface below gave the luster of objects, as if in snow. And what to my wandering eyes should appear, but a miniature Rover and eight tiny reindeer. And a little old driver so lively and quick, I knew in a moment, it must be St. Nick. I heard him exclaim as he - over the hills he did speed. Merry Christmas to all and to all - to you all Godspeed.
1833827|CC|Very good.
1833832|CDR|Gordo, that was the first time I heard that and I got to say - I got to say that is beautiful.
1833839|CC|I agree. Did the LMP get any sleep or did he spend all night composing that?
1833848|LMP|People always said we ought to have a poet in space.
1833853|CDR|I don't think we've made it yet.
1833855|LMP|No, for some reason I really woke up with one of your handovers last night, and that was how I went back to sleep.
1833918|PAO|That poetic offering was from Jack Schmitt.
1833919|LMP|Gordy, that's for the kids. ...
1833925|CC|Roger, Jack.
1834000|PAO|We're about 15 seconds now, from reacquiring America in its 49 revolution of the Moon.
1834022|CC|Challenger, Houston. One update for the postsleep procedure. I understand you brought in the LMP's camera, and we want to be sure you get that into the jett bag before the final jettison here, and by the way, you're STAY for the final jettison.
1834045|CDR|Okay, Gordy. It's already in the jett bag, thank you.
1834058|LMP|And, Gordy, you might make some notes that, before I put it in there, I took another black-and-white or black-and-white window pan with mag Nancy.
1834115|CC|Okay, Jack. Roger.
1834119|CDR|Gordo, on REG A, that is - you interpret that is just a small leak by the reg? That it would be usable, if you had to.
1834135|CC|That's affirmative, Geno. It's a small, slow leak and it is usable If - if needed.
1834145|CDR|Okay, thank you. - Summing up, so far, I think that's all - all the system anomalies we've got, isn't it?
1834156|CC|That's all I can think of at the moment. I do have revised times for the rest of the Lunar Surface Checklist which, at a convenient time, I can give to you - so that you'll have a how-goes-it as you go on down the line here.
1834213|CDR|Why don't you give them to us now, Gordy?
1834216|CC|Okay, turn to page 7-9.
1834232|CDR|Go ahead.
1834233|CC|Okay, 7-9 LGC/IMU POWER UP, change that time from 183:04 to 184:10. The eat period time is now 184:20. Turn the page, and the 183:59 above "Park RENDEZVOUS RADAR" is now 185:05. Next page, don suits at 185:15. Go to the next page. Prep for equipment jettison is 185:50, and the same page - helmet/glove donning is 185:58. Next page, pressure integrity check, 186:04. Cabin depress is 186:08, and hatch opening is 186:12. Next page, 7-14, cabin repress is 186:15. Cabin cleanup for launch is 186:20. And on the following page, we're going to delete the P22 but we'd like you to go all the procedures except those from "VERB 95 ENTER," through "P00 ENTER," inclusive - the center section of procedures. So you'll still be closing the rendezvous radar breakers, going to LGC, and parking the antenna and copying pads. Over.
1834433|CDR|Okay, we're going to delete everything from VERB 95 through P00 on P22. That's the center of the page.
1834443|CC|That's affirmative and then the next page, cabin prep for ascent is 186:45, and instead of 39 minutes we're going to have you do that in 3 minutes. And you'll actually - you should have a little more time than that, since you got up early. That puts you right back with timeline, at lift-off minus 1 hour 15, at 186:48. Over.
1834516|CDR|Okay, top at 7-15 where we pick up - what was going to be the beginning of the P22. Have you got a time up there?
1834524|CC|I guess we'll just have to work that in with cabin cleanup time. We had deleted that whole time block but you do have to catch those procedures.
1834541|CDR|Okay, and then the times on the top of 7-10, for P22, are not applicable, and I guess you can give us an update for our P57 lift-off time.
1834557|CC|That's affirmative. We might - that might be - there's a couple more changes coming at me here but let me make sure I got them straight and I'll call you later. Go ahead with whatever you were doing.
1834611|CDR|Okay.
1834637|CDR|(Cough) Gordy, if I - if I get ready for the LGC/IMU power up, I'll give you a call even though it comes earlier but I'd like to get that started, as soon as we're ready to start it.
1834649|CC|Okay. We concur with that.
1834703|LMP|Hey, Gordy, as far as the food, medication, and sleep goes - no medication. Gene had 5 hours of good sleep, I had probably around my usual 6, in spite of my poetic inclinations. And the food -we continue to do well, I believe. We've eaten a wet pack apiece last night. We got one this morning. We've eaten our scrambled eggs and sausage yesterday, and as we've run out of juices and tea. And which is somewhat of an inconvenience I might say. And if you've got any specific questions, I can fill you in on it but, I think, food-wise we've done pretty well.
1834754|CC|Can you give us a feel on the fluid intake?
1834802|LMP|Well, that's what I was trying to do when I said we'd drunk all the juices and tea. Plus, Gene, in particular, takes water from the hose.
1834814|CC|Okay, Jack, fine. Sounds good.
1834841|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 183 hours 49 minutes. Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt aboard Challenger on the lunar surface after having gotten up about 15 minutes early. Now having breakfast. They're a bit behind in the timeline but we expect to have them caught up by the time they - or about 1-1/2 hour prior to lunar lift-off, which is when we begin the really busy period of liftoff preparations, and everything appears to be going alone very smoothly at this time. The crew's early arising caught us a little unprepared here in mission control we had our own wake up tune to play up to them this morning which was to be the title theme from the motion picture 2001 A Space Oddessy, however they beat us to the punch with their own wake up song to the control center and we'll play that back for you at this time.
1835006|PAO|And after giving us a few minutes to catch our bearings we hit them with the theme from 2001 A Space Oddessy. Since then things have been going along pretty much normally. The poetic offering was from Jack Schmitt. He said it was for all the kids back home. It was his version of the Night Before Christmas. We have reacquired Ron Evans aboard the Command Module America and everything is progressing very smoothly aboard that vehicle. We're on separate communication circuits at the present time and will be up until the revolution prior to LM liftoff at which time we'll switch back to a single air-to-ground a single spacecraft communicator operation and be able to follow the operation in both vehicles simultaneously. That will be at acquisition of signal on the CSM's 51st revolution.
1835734|CDR|Okay, Gordy, it's PGNs power up time.
1835739|CC|Okay, Geno, I - and I've got a couple more items to completely clean up the checklist whenever you can get to that.
1835756|CDR|I'll let Jack give you a call. I'm going to start on the PGNs, if we're ready.
1835818|CDR|Gordy, you ready for a PGN?
1835826|CC|That's affirmative, finally got you a GO to start it as per checklist.
1835836|CDR|Okay there's the PRO, I did get the RESTART. I got the NO ATT, the DAP, GIMBAL LOCK light, and a PROGRAM ALARM light's on.
1835852|CC|Roger.
1835940|CDR|MARK it the gimbal operate breaker is CLOSED.
1835944|CC|Roger.
1835949|LMP|That's the IMU OPERATE breaker. Yes. Stand by for a 90 seconds.
1835954|CC|And we're ready for a POWER AMP PRIMARY and HIGH BIT RATE.
1840012|CDR|Okay. You got it.
1840437|CDR|Okay, Gordo, self test is complete and is GO, and I'll give you an E-memory dump.
1840443|CC|Okay, we're ready, standing by for it. And while it's coming, I could give you the update for the next page.
1840458|CDR|Okay, it's coming at you and you can go with the updates on the next page.
1840502|CC|Okay. Page 7-10, your P57 lift-off time, upper right corner, is 188:01:43.85. Over.
1840519|CDR|?Okay, Gordy, P57 lift-off time 188:01:43.85.
1840527|CC|That's affirmative. And then we'd like you to delete all the steps below that lift-off time, from the A/T-3 data star info box through the VERB 32 after the last - after for the remaining data stars and after last star. In other words, just delete all between the box and up to circuit breaker AOT LAMP, OPEN. And, of course, they'll be no P22 time, over.
1840602|CDR|Okay. Delete all the data star information between the start of that box and after last star VERB 34 ENTER, 00 ENTER.
1840616|CC|That's correct and then turn to page 7-15. We're changing - we - looking here a little closer we find that radars are already in good position, so you can delete all procedures on page 7-15 except "Copy Ascent pads, CSI pad, and LM DAP weight."
1840652|CDR|Okay. We deleted everything but the last three lines on that page.
1840657|CC|Okay. On page 7-12, back up a couple pages. In the lower right corner there, in the blank space, you might jot down 185:58, VHF check with command module. And that'll be according to the procedures on 7-15 in the box. You might just parenthesis 7-15 to remind you where the procedure is. But the comm check will come during that time when you're preping for equipment jettison, or right around there.
1840741|CDR|Okay. We got that.
1840744|CC|Okay. That's all we got for you, and we have the E-MOD dump okay.
1840753|CDR|Okay.
1840906|CDR|Gordy, we're in P00 and data and we're standing by for your up-link, and how long does that AOT HEATER breaker have to be open? I pushed it IN at 184:08.
1840917|CC|Okay. I'll get an answer on that, and I think we'll be coming with the up-link here shortly.
1841004|CC|Gene, no time constraint on that AOT breaker; except, if it's foggy, it hasn't been in long enough.
1841016|CDR|(Laughter) Thank you, Gordy.
1841113|CC|Challenger. Here comes your up-link.
1841119|CDR|Okay.
1841501|CC|Challenger, it's - your computer. You have a state vector, a time increment, and an RLS.
1841511|CDR|Thank you, Gordy.
1841511|CDR|Yes, it likes - it likes the command module's orbit.
1841511|CC|That's good.
1843435|CC|Okay, we see that.
1843439|CDR|Houston, there's a NOUN 05.
1843439|CC|Doesn't look like the Challenger shifted around much in the last 3 days.
1843439|CDR|Well, at least it always settles back to the same spot.
1843547|CC|Okay. You're clear to torque those.
1843958|LMP|Say, Gordy, are we clear to jettison the buddy SLSS bag, now?
1843958|CC|That's affirmative, Jack. We've determined you won't need it for rock stowage. And along the same line, John Young suggested that you might check your checklist pockets on your suits, when you get to that point. His were full of dirt. You might want to take those off and discard them If that's the case, so that it won't fly up and get you at Insertion.
1843958|CDR|Yes, we already did that, Gordy. They were a mess, and we took them off. They're in the jettison bag now.
1843958|CC|Okay.
1843958|CDR|We're going to take time out for about 15 or 20 minutes of mandatory housekeeping here.
1843958|CC|Okay, understand.
1843958|CDR|That's - that's prior to suit donning.
1844059|CC|Roger.
1844059|CC|Okay, Jack.
1844059|LMP|And Gene will be on biomed shortly.
1844059|CC|Roger.
1844059|LMP|Gordy, I'm back up.
1844059|CC|Okay.
1851716|LMP|Okay, Houston. This is the LMP suited. How do you read biomed and voice?
1851716|CC|Oh, we're copying your ticker loud and clear. Also your voice.
1851716|LMP|Okay.
1851716|CDR|Gordy, Gene. I'm going off the air.
1851716|CC|Okay, Geno.
1853133|CDR|Okay, Gordo. This is CDR. You ought to have me all backup on the comm and biomed now.
1853133|CC|Okay, Geno. Looking good.
1853133|CDR|CDR's PRD is 17045.
1853133|CC|Okay; got that.
1853133|LMP|LMP is 24150.
1853133|CC|Okay.
1854216|CDR|Okay, Gordo. We're ready to don the helmets and gloves.
1854216|CC|Okay.
1854216|CDR|Okay, Gordo. We're going to press on, but don't let us miss 185:58 for the VHF check, will you?
1854216|CC|Sure won't. We're watching them.
1854216|CDR|Okay.
1854602|CC|Challenger, Houston, We're getting close to the bottom on descent water. We're expecting to have to switch to ascent water sometime- in the next hour. We'll give you a call.
1854602|CDR|Okay, Gordy.
1854602|LMP|Okay.
1854602|LMP|I cleaned them up for you. What more could you ask?
1854738|CDR|Yes. Hey, Houston. We're VOX now.
1854738|CC|Okay; and loud and clear on VOX.
1854738|LMP|Is the recorder on yet?
1854738|CDR|Yes. The recorder's on, but I dor.'t think it's going to work. (Laughter) See if I've got anymore juice in here. I owe Don Arabian something.
1854738|CDR|Wristlet covers. Don wristlet covers.
1854922|CDR|Okay; my right - right glove is or. and locked. Verified.
1854922|CDR|Oh, I just came to the end of my grease. Probably a good time, because if everything goes the way it's supposed to, I shouldn't put on these ZV clothes anymore.
1854922|LMP|Don't you use that in your IV?
1854922|CDR|No, I don't need it with my IV.
1855010|CDR|Mine are all on and verified. Locked. 3ack in SUIT FLOW.
1855010|CDR|Hey, we got 8 minutes to the comm check, so let's press on. Hate to get in the middle of the integrity check - Oh, we can do it. This won't take long. Need any help with your glove?
1855010|LMP|I will.
1855010|CDR|Okay. Let me. Buggish today. Turn that off.
1855010|LMP|Well, I did once, Gene, and I - didn't help, and I started to run out of air. There.
1855010|CDR|Doublecheck. You sure they're locked?
1855010|LMP|Yes, they're locked.
1855010|CDR|Okay.
1855010|LMP|Okay. Gloves are GO.
1855128|CDR|Okay; stay facing that way. Pressure integrity check. Suit shall not be maintained at elevated pressure greater than 5 minutes. Okay; SUIT GAS DIVERTER, PULL to EGRESS. Verify.
1855128|LMP|Okay; that's verified.
1855128|CDR|CABIN GAS RETURN, EGRESS. Verify.
1855128|LMP|EGRESS verified.
1855128|CDR|SUIT CIRCUIT RELIEF, CLOSE.
1855128|LMP|I'm CLOSE.
1855128|CDR|Okay; we will leave PRESSURE REG A, CLOSE.
1855128|LMP|Yes, sir.
1855128|CDR|PRESSURE REG B, DIRECT 0 , and we'll go up to 3.7 or 4.0 on the cuff gauge, and then you want to go to EGRESS on it.
1855128|LMP|Okay.
1855128|LMP|Okay; you can go on up. I'm in DIRECT O2.
1855128|CDR|Okay; suit circuit's coming up.
1855128|CDR|Okay; suit circuit's about 7*2 now. Should be coming off the peg shortly. I'm off the peg.
1855128|LMP|And I'm off the peg.
1855128|CDR|You can stop it on your cuff gage - -
1855128|LMP|Yes, I will.
1855128|CDR|- - at 3.7*
1855128|LMP|That's 3-0, 3.5, 3.7.
1855128|CDR|Okay; go to egress.
1855128|LMP|I'm in EGRESS.
1855128|CDR|Okay.
1855309|CDR|MARK it.
1855309|LMP|Okay. 3.75 and CDR was 3.75*
1855309|CDR|Got about k minutes for VHF.
1855309|CDR|Our suits are going to be good.
1855309|LMP|That's the whole circuit.
1855309|CDR|Yes, I know.
1855309|LMP|It's about the same.
1855309|CDR|Got about 10 seconds to go.
1855309|CDR|Okay.
1855424|CDR|MARK it. CDR dropped from 3.75 to 3.60.
1855424|LMP|Okay.
1855424|CDR|Okay; SUIT CIRCUIT RELIEF, AUTO. Hold your ears
1855424|LMP|AUTO.
1855424|CDR|Suit circuit pressure decays to 4.8. Coming down.
1855424|CDR|Okay. Jack. The next thing is depress, but before we do that, I think we ought to get the VHF check. It's only about 3 minutes away.
1855424|LMP|Do it. I got a scratch on my helmet.
1855424|CDR|Okay, Gordo. We're going to configure for the VHF here. Standing by for a call from the CMP.
1855424|CC|Okay; sounds like a good idea.
1855424|CDR|And we'll press on after that. Jack, you better make sure your volume's up.
1855424|LMP|You're RECEIVE B, huh?
1855424|CDR|I'm A, OFF - we're A, OFF and RECEIVE, B on the AUDIO.
1855424|LMP|Hey, what do we do once we hear him?
1855424|CDR|Okay; when you hear him, probably answer him is the first thing. And then - and then VHF. No. They need - You want A TRANSMITTER, VOICE/RANGE, then A to T/R, and A TRANSMITTER, OFF after conversation.
1855424|LMP|Okay.
1855424|CDR|As soon as you hear him, you want the VHF A TRANSMITTER to VOICE/RANGE.
1855424|LMP|Yes, I'll do it. is he going - He's going to try to lock up on us I guess, huh?
1855424|CDR|They've got us VEF RANGING, so we'll have to be quiet once we get established.
1855424|CDR|*** like home in these suits.
1855424|LMP|Yes.
1855424|CC|Challenger, about 30 seconds to the comm check.
1855424|CDR|Okay. Thank you, Houston.
1855424|LMP|There he is.
1855424|CDR|Yes. Talking in VOX.
1855424|LMP|Okay; I'm going to go VOICE/RANGING, I guess.
1855424|CDR|Wait - No, wait until he gives us the call.
1855424|LMP|Hey, Houston; we're reading CMP on VOX.
1855424|CC|Roger.
1855424|CDR|Hey, Captain America, this is Challenger. You're loud and clear. Go to T/R.
1855424|LMP|Okay, Ron. You're loud and clear. How do you read us? Okay; you were very good on B. On T/R, you're in the mud a little bit. On the A. Oh, okay. That's better. You must have turned away from your mike. How are you doing?
1855424|CDR|Okay. Okay. Are you in VOICE/RANGE, Jack?
1855424|LMP|Yes, I am.
1855424|CDR|Ron, are you going to do any ranging at all?
1855424|CDR|Okay. Gee, you're loud and clear. How's - how's America looking to you? Yes, we got a beautiful bird down here. We'll - we'll see you up there shortly.
1855948|LMP|Hang in there and keep your probe extended. Okay; we're going to go VHF, OFF.
1855948|CDR|Okay. Jack, you need your A TRANSMITTER, OFF.
1855948|LMP|A is OFF.
1855948|CDR|That's all you need to do.
1855948|LMP|Outstanding.
1855948|CC|Okay, Challenger. You have a GO from us for depress.
1855948|CDR|Okay; stand by 1.
1855948|LMP|I doubt it.
1855948|CDR|You might be able to. It's awful glary though. He'll be well sunlit up there.
1855948|LMP|I doubt it.
1855948|CDR|Okay; we have a GO for depress, Jack. On 16 ECS, CABIN REPRESS, OPEN.
1855948|LMP|CABIN REPRESS coming OPEN. OPEN.
1855948|CDR|Why don't you watch your gage, and I'm going to -Okay. I'm going to open the forward dump to AUTO to 3.5.
1855948|LMP|Okay; I'll watch. You call.
1855948|CDR|Hey, coming down?
1855948|LMP|Okay; it's 5 s 4.5> 4. Stand by.
1860121|LMP|MARK. 3-5.
1860121|CDR|Okay. Verify - suit circuit lockup at 4.3 and decaying. Okay; it's 4.5. Stand by for the decay. Oh, man, I got to go get that WATER SEP SELECT.
1860144|LMP|Pull the 2, huh?
1860145|CDR|Oh, boy.
1860146|LMP|Want me to get it?
1860147|CDR|No. I got longer arms, I guess.
1860153|LMP|I can reach back in there.
1860155|CDR|Okay. If you can get back there.
1860156|LMP|I think. Now, they want it?
1860202|CDR|Yes, now. Pull the 2.
1860205|LMP|Okay. Pull the 2. Okay. Happy with the suit circuit. And yes, we got a decay in the suit loop.
1860214|CDR|Okay. Okay; verify suit circuit lock's up. I'm dumping all the way.
1860221|LMP|Okay.
1860234|PAO|Cabin pressure dropping down through 2-1/2 pounds now.
1860246|LMP|Circuit's 4.2.
1860251|PAO|Approaching 1 pound cabin pressure.
1860307|LMP|Hey, there's 0.7 in the cabin and 4.1 in the suits.
1860335|LMP|About 4.0, and the cabin is 0.3.
1860355|CDR|Okay; let me see if I can jar it.
1860358|LMP|Okay; I guess we're GO for EVA-4.
1860402|CDR|Five, isn't it? Five this time? Oh, man, I got it open. If I could bleed that pressure. Oh, boy. Hey, hold it here for a minute. There's a lot of psi on that hatch.
1860419|LMP|Okay; that'll hack it. Let me go to AUTO here. Need my checklist. Make it - Oops, that's closed. That's AUTO, and the lock lock is on. Okay. Hatch is open all the way. Where are we?
1860453|LMP|Why is that still waving in the breeze?
1860456|CDR|Man, there's a solar wind in here.
1860504|LMP|We're on 7- something here. Still venting, are we? Houston, how's our cabin configuration? Mean there's still the - had a little breeze going out the hatch.
1860528|CC|All the numbers look good here, Jack.
1860533|CDR|Hey, hold that, Jack.
1860535|LMP|Okay. Okay. Ready?
1860538|CDR|Okay.
1860541|LMP|Partially open; that's good. ... Jettison the jett bag. Here goes Santa Claus - -
1860547|CDR|Here you go, Santa Claus. - - Santa Claus' bag. Another bag of goodies.
1860554|LMP|Give it the old - -
1860555|CDR|There you go.
1860555|LMP|- - 3-point kick.
1860557|CDR|Nice. Beautifully done. Just where we wanted it. All clear the ascent stage.
1860612|LMP|Need the - Okay; clear. Good boy. Now, for your next act.
1860627|CDR|No. Don't - don't even think about it.
1860630|LMP|Okay. (Laughter)
1860630|CDR|Okay? (Laughter)
1860632|LMP|Jettison bag. All items are clear of ascent stage. Ready to close hatch?
1860635|CDR|Looks like it.
1860637|LMP|Short EVA-5. Are we STAY/NO STAY for hatch closure?
1860645|CC|You have a GO for closing the hatch.
1860650|LMP|Okay.
1860655|CDR|Okay. The hatch is closed.
1860659|LMP|Boy, is it easy to get around in here without a PLSS on. Okay; your DUMP VALVE verified in AUTO?
1860709|CDR|Yes, sir, and locked.
1860710|LMP|Okay.
1860713|CDR|CABIN REPRESS. Okay.
1860715|LMP|Okay.
1860716|CDR|Verify it's AUTO?
1860717|LMP|It's AUTO.
1860718|CDR|Okay; on 16, CABIN REPRESS, CLOSED?
1860721|LMP|Okay; CABIN REPRESS going CLOSED.
1860722|CDR|And the hatch looked clear when I - sealed it. Clear when I closed the hatch.
1860726|LMP|Okay. Closed.
1860728|CDR|There's the MASTER ALARM. And the cabin is coming up. AUX O2.
1860742|CDR|Okay; cabin is increasing, and you can go to CABIN on PRESSURE REG B
1860749|LMP|It's in CABIN.
1860753|CDR|Every warning light will go off here shortly. And my suit's coming down.
1860802|LMP|Mine, also.
1860815|CDR|Okay. We're just about to go to 50 percent. DESCENT O2. We're there.
1860838|CDR|Okay. Cabin's almost at regulating pressure, and cabin lights are still on. Next thing we'll do when it stabilizes, we'll doff our gloves, doff our helmets; locked up.
1860850|LMP|Okay; 5.0.
1860853|CDR|Okay. You can doff your gloves.
1860858|LMP|Let me watch that pressure a minute. Well, it looks like it's stable at five. Okay.
1860913|CDR|How's the cabin look, Houston? Looks good here.
1860923|CC|Okay; it looks good here.
1860929|CDR|Okay.
1860931|PAO|That EVA lasted the total of 1 minute from hatch open to hatch closed.
1860933|LMP|I hope so. Physics says it should have been.
1860937|CDR|There's an experiment.
1860940|LMP|Not really, since we do that with our PLSS and everything else.
1860943|CDR|Okay. Take your helmet off.
1860954|LMP|That was painless enough.
1861003|CDR|Jack, I'd wrap that thing around it like that. ..
1861007|LMP|Wait a minute, don't we take our helmets?
1861011|CDR|Not yet. We - No, obviously. Go behind the engine cover.
1861017|LMP|Okay.
1861341|CC|Challenger, Houston. Just a reminder. Before you stow the right-hand OPS on the floor, you need to attach the floor hole cover.
1861357|CDR|Okay; we're - Jack's down there cleaning up the floor now, and I'm working on the visors.
1861402|CC|Okay.
1861854|CC|Challenger, Houston. We have a copy of a - an update on the rock stowage that was given to you last night. We're not sure if they read one part of it to you, and that was concerning using some contingency webbing to reinforce the tiedown of the bag that goes on the Z-27 bulkhead. If you did get that update, forget it. We do not need any extra tiedown other than the normal tiedown. Over.
1861927|LMP|Okay, Gordy. That's for the buddy PLSS bag, I guess, and we did not get it. But we haven't quite stowed that yet anyway, so we will forget it.
1861936|CC|Okay.
1861940|CDR|Are the Rover batteries still alive?
1861947|CC|I'll check with the back room here. Stand by.
1864057|CC|Challenger, Houston. I'm standing by with a pad any time you're ready.
1864105|LMP|Okay, Gordy. I'll be ready in just a minute.
1864141|PAO|This is Apollo control at 186 hours 42 minutes. Cernan and Schmitt aboard the lunar module Challenger at this time are getting the cabin of the vehicle ship shape for liftoff. Their essentially back on the timeline at this time and ready to begin the final liftoff preparations. Aboard the Command Module, America now in its 50th revolution everything continues to go very smoothly. Ron Evans is beginning to get suited up and configuring the command module for the LMs liftoff, rendezvous and docking.
1864501|LMP|Okay, Gordy, go with the ascent pad.
1864506|CC|Okay, Jack. This is the direct ascent pad. Tig is 188:01:35.93; NOUN 76 is 5540.8, 0032.0 minus 000.5; DEDA 047 is plus 37430; minus 72507; plus 58669; plus 56907; plus 0032.0; plus 0535.9; and TPI time is 188:55:57.00. LM weight 10900; and HA, is 62.9; Hp, 62.2. One remark; your Tig for one rev late is 190:00:18. Go ahead.
1864658|LMP|Okay, Gordy, here is your readback. Direct rendezvous - direct rendezvous is 188:01:35.93; 5540.8, 0032.0, minus 000.5, plus 37430, minus 72507, 58669, 56907, 0032.0, 0535.9; 188:55:57.00; 10900, 629, 622. Remark: one rev late Tig is 190:00:18. Over.
1864755|CC|Okay, that was a good readback. Now I have a coelliptic ascent pad. Tig is 188:04:14.00; 5539.0, 0038.0, minus 000.5; plus 37430; minus 72507; 58630; 56907; 0038.0. Rest of the pad down to LM weight is NA. Your LM weight is 10900, and the HA and Hp are NA. Over.
1864917|LMP|Okay, coelliptic readback: 188:04:14.00; 5539.0, 0038.0, minus 000.5; plus 37430; minus 72507; 58630; 56907; 0038.0; rest of pad is NA except for LM weight: 10900. Over.
1864958|CC|Okay, that's a good readback. Turn to page 10; I have the CSI pad coelliptic.
1865012|CDR|And, Gordy, I'm starting to pick up the breakers on panel 11.
1865017|CC|Okay, Geno.
1865027|LMP|Okay, Gordy, CSI on page 10.
1865031|CC|Okay. Tig is 189:01:53.81. Tig at TPI is 190:55:00.00. NOUN 81 is 053.9; and DELTA-Vy is a plus all balls. 373, 0541.9, 0655.0; plus 053.9, plus all balls, and plus 001.2.
1865131|LMP|Okay. CSI pad; 189:01:53.81, 190:55 all zeros; plus 053.9, plus all zeros; 0541.9, 0655.0; plus 053.9, plus all zeros; plus 001.2. Over.
1865158|CC|Okay. That's a good readback. That's all I have for you.
1865204|LMP|Okay.
1865346|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 186 hours 54 minutes. We've just had loss of signal now, with Ron Evans aboard the Command and Service Module. Everything going very smoothly at this time, and our preparations for Lunar lift-off. We'll be reacquiring the Command Module in about 45 minutes. And at that time, we plan to reconfigure the CAPCOM or air-to-ground circuits with the two vehicles, so that we have both the Command and Service Module and the Lunar Module on the same circuit for the single spacecraft communicator operation. Included in the string of numbers read up to the crew aboard Challenger by CAPCOM Gordon Fullerton, was the time that will be used for ignition -
1865433|CDR|Okay, Gordo, we're on the top of 8-4.
1865437|CC|Roger, Geno.
1865452|PAO|The ignition time for Lunar lift-off now, as passed up to the crew, is 188 hours, 1 minute, 36 seconds. And that burn time on the Lunar Module ASCENT engine will be 7 minutes, 20 seconds.
1865552|LMP|Okay, Gordo. The rendezvous radar looks a little warm, it - I'm reading about 90 degrees.
1865559|CC|Okay 90.
1865611|LMP|Okay, Gordy, are you ready for AGS STATUS to OPERATE?
1865617|CC|Let me check. We're ready, Jack; go ahead.
1865829|CDR|Okay, Gordo, NOUN 72, R2 is not varying. I've got, both shaft and trunnion, and crosspointers varying.
1865841|CC|Okay, Geno. We copy that.
1865923|CDR|Okay, Gordy. On the radar test, everything is GO. Everything is within limits. The only anomaly is the one I just reported.
1865932|CC|Okay, Geno. And 20 seconds here on the hour even, we'll have a site handover to Goldstone.
1865943|CDR|Okay.
1870408|CC|Geno, Houston. You can go ahead and park the radar at 0 and 30.
1870416|CDR|Yes. It's going there right now, as a matter of fact.
1870420|CC|Okay.
1870611|LMP|Okay, Houston. The AGS gyro calibration is complete and looks pretty good. I guess Z's a little - little - No, that - Yes, Z's a little more than you'd expect, I guess.
1870628|CC|Okay, Jack.
1870657|CC|Challenger, Houston. Words on the radar. When you parked it there, we saw it go to the proper places. From all our indications, the interface between the radar and the PGNS is okay. And our best guess is some kind of self-test problem.
1870718|CDR|Okay, Gordy. Thank you.
1870759|CDR|Rate gyros are good.
1870804|CC|Roger.
1870925|LMP|Okay, Gordy. I'm going to go to AUTO on the S-BAND, if you want it.
1870940|CC|Okay. We're GO. And go ahead with the check.
1870950|CDR|Okay, Gordy. I'll give you a call before I fire, but we're in the process of getting ready for the RCS.
1870956|CC|Roger.
1871021|CDR|Okay, Gordo. Here we go.
1871045|PAO|Cernan and Schmitt, at this time, are firing the reaction control system thrusters in what's called the hot fire test. Everything continuing to progress smoothly toward liftoff at 188 hours 1 minute 36 seconds. And, we expect to have the lunar surface television up and in operation in about 10 minutes.
1871135|CDR|Gordy, the AGS check looked good.
1871138|CC|Roger. It looked good here also.
1871153|LMP|Okay; SYSTEM A QUAD 4 talkback still sticky.
1871158|CC|Roger, Jack.
1871301|CDR|Okay. Here we go on the PGNS, Gordy.
1871305|CC|Okay, Geno.
1871343|CDR|Looked good here, Gordy.
1871349|LMP|And, you've got DATA and P00.
1871355|CC|Okay. Your up-links are coming. We'll give you a vector and zero the pos/neg cells. Your RLS is okay.
1871556|CC|Challenger, Houston. We'd like you to put the ASCENT BATTERIES ON according to the procedures on the next page, 8-8, just a little early because of pre-conditioning noticed in - before descent. And we checked your RGAs during the hot fire, ana your hot fire itself, and they both looked good.
1871620|LMP|Thank you, Gordo.
1871622|CC|And, Challenger, it's your computer now.
1871628|LMP|Thank you.
1871631|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're now 45 minutes from LM liftoff. Everything continuing to go very smoothly. We've completed the reaction control system's checkout. It looks good through the telemetry we're receiving here on the ground. Also, aboard the spacecraft, the primary guidance and backup guidance system clocks have been synchronized. The next item on the crew's preparation checklist will be to align the platform of their guidance system which is used as a stable attitude reference. And, we're now some 20 minutes from reacquiring the Command Module, which is now in its 51st revolution of the Moon. And, as mentioned before, when we do acquire, we'll have both the LM and the Command Module on the same communication circuit.
1871952|CDR|Gordo, did you ever get any word on the Rover batteries?
1871959|CC|No. I sure haven't. I haven't heard on that one.
1872005|CDR|It's not important. 1 just wondered whether those things were going to be working back there.
1872011|CC|Okay. We've got no reason to believe they won't. When you get down to parking the rendezvous radar antenna after this P57, give me a call. We're going to change the parking position.
1872026|CDR|Okay.
1872035|CDR|Why don't you just give me the numbers now?
1872038|CC|Okay. Do a - as - as the checklist, shows, except do a VERB 41 NOUN 72 to 0 and 30 degrees. Go to SLEW, and then delete the "manual slew for 3 seconds." They want to leave it there for temperature purposes. This will be a cooler position for it during ascent.
1872105|CDR|Okay. Understand. That's 0 and 03000.
1872111|CC|That's affirmative.
1872118|CDR|And the first 01 - first 04 was 0.01.
1872124|CC|Roger. We got that.
1872143|PAO|Cernan and Schmitt at this time are in the midst of the platform alignment and we're standing by for television from the lunar surface, via the camera on the Lunar Rover. And we're getting the first, first bits of the picture now. We should have color. And we do have a color picture from the lunar surface.
1872422|CC|Challenger, Houston. We've got you on television now. We have a good picture.
1872433|CDR|Glad to see old Rover's still working.
1872853|CC|Okay. We got your NOUN 05?
1872920|CC|Go ahead and torque them.
1873043|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 187 hours 31 minutes. Now approaching 30 minutes until time for Lunar lift-off. The count down toward lift-off is going very smoothly. The crew aboard Challenger has completed aligning their inertial platform that's used as a stable attitude reference during powered flight. And we're less than 6 minutes now from regaining our radio communications with Ron Evans, aboard the Command and Service Module, America. The television picture is coming to us from the Lunar Roving vehicle, parked about 490 feet west of the Lunar Module, looking toward the east. Cernan and Schmitt will shortly be going through their prelaunch switch checks, checking the configuration of all the switches in the Lunar Module. They'll then don their helmets and gloves.
1873307|CDR|Okay, Houston. P12 looks good, and the PGNS is in AUTO.
1873313|CC|Okay, Challenger. There's no change to 047 and 053. I do have a K-factor for you.
1873329|LMP|Go ahead.
1873330|CC|Okay. It's 179:59:59.82. Over.
1873346|LMP|Okay; 15 - 179:59:59.82.
1873351|CC|That's right, Jack.
1873518|CC|Challenger, Houston. I have a couple of PIPA bias updates for the PGNS.
1873533|LMP|Okay. Go ahead.
1873535|CC|Okay, a VERB - with a VERB 21 NOUN 01, load address 1452 with 03045, and load address 1454 with 05246. Over.
1873600|LMP|Okay. That's 1452 with 03045; and 1454, 05246.
1873607|CC|Readback's good.
1873629|PAO|This is Apollo Control now 25 minutes from Lunar lift-off. Aboard Challenger, the crew has set up their guidance computer in program 12, which is the program used for the Lunar lift-off. And we're less than 1 minute now, from regaining radio contact with Ron Evans aboard America.
1873655|LMP|Okay. They're in, Houston.
1873657|CC|Okay. Look good to us.
1873723|PAO|And, we've had acquisition of signal now, from the CSM. About 10 minutes from now, the Lunar Module's scheduled to begin pressurizing the ASCENT propulsion tanks.
1873802|CMP-CM|Hey, Houston; America.
1873808|CC|Roger, America. This is Houston. You're loud and clear.
1873813|CMP-CM|Okay, Gordo. Got my suit on.
1873818|CC|Okay, Ron. We gave you the wrong skinny on the comm configuration last rev. We're actually, now, in a full MSFN relay mode. We'd like you to stay off of VOX. Over.
1873836|CMP-CM|Can do. I'm off VOX.
1873911|CC|Challenger, Houston. When you get to a break point, I have some words on what you can expect in the way of guidance steering. Over.
1873921|CDR|Stand by.
1874000|CDR|Okay, Gordy. You can go ahead and talk while we're putting our helmets and gloves on.
1874005|CC|Okay. We never got around to debriefing you on PDI, but the out-of-plane indications you saw on the AGS during descent were proper. We had changed your - your vector slightly just prior to PDI, and so the AGS was navigating and indicating properly. We just ran the present ascent targets in the LMS with the half-a-mile crossrange as shown on the pad, and you're going to be steering south. That's the way the steering direction goes. That's to your left, for Geno's benefit. And the crosspointer indicated a maximum of about 13 feet-per-second out-of-plane velocity at about ignition plus 3 minutes and 50 seconds, and then came on back to zero. Over. That - that velocity was AGS velocity.
1874110|LMP|Okay, Gordo. That's good information to have.
1874119|CDR|Understand; the AGS on that one. Okay.
1874233|PAO|This is Apollo control coming up now on 18 minutes until lunar liftoff.
1874235|CMP-CM|Okay, Houston. America maneuvering to attitude.
1874240|CC|Roger, America.
1874251|PAO|And flight director Gene Kranz has just gone around the room checked with all flight controllers. We're go for lunar liftoff.
1874251|CMP-CM|Also I'll start pumping up the cabin, DIRECT O2.
1874256|CC|Okay.
1874300|LMP|ASCENT WATER is OPEN, Houston.
1874302|CC|Roger.
1874327|PAO|And we've now switched over to the water on the ascent stage to be used in cooling electronic equipment, as called for in the flight plan. There was some concern that we would run out of descent water before we switched over to ascent water, but the water in the descent stage lasted as long as it was required.
1874416|CDR|Okay, Houston. We're at lift-off minus 17 minutes, and VERB 47 is going over.
1874422|CC|Roger, Challenger.
1874536|CC|America, we see your cabin at 5.5.
1874544|CMP-CM|Okay, thank you.
1874555|CMP-CM|DIRECT O2 is CLOSED.
1874602|CDR|Houston, the DESCENT BATTS are coming OFF.
1874605|CC|Roger.
1874613|CC|America, it looks like, to us here, your maneuver has stopped. Maybe you hit the stick.
1874625|CMP-CM|You roll around in this thing, you knock the thing off of lock.
1874634|PAO|This is Apollo control now 15 minutes from lunar liftoff. The descent stage tanks have been depressurized. We're about 1 minute now from beginning pressurization of the ascent stage tanks.
1874648|CC|Challenger, we're recommending PGNS direct rendezvous.
1874654|CDR|Roger, Gordo; understand. PGNS direct rendezvous for Challenger.
1874809|CC|America; OMNI Delta, please.
1874835|CC|America, Houston; voice check.
1874838|CDR|Okay, hold -
1874853|CDR|Hello, Houston; Challenger. Circuit breakers are configured. We're on the top of 8-16.
1874900|CC|Challenger, Houston. Okay; sounds good.
1874909|CDR|And we're standing by for lift-off minus 10.
1874912|CC|Roger.
1874926|CDR|And, Houston, are you in relay now?
1874931|CC|We had - we lost high gain on America, so we inhibited the down-link. We're not in relay, no.
1874942|CDR|Okay.
1874944|CC|We're actually in a one-way relay. Ron should be able to hear you, but not vice versa.
1875025|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Gene Kranz now getting a GO for ascent stage pressurization.
1875052|CDR|Okay, Houston; coming up on 10 minutes. And we're ready to pressurize the APS.

1875124|CDR|MARK it. We got a squib fired, Houston.
1875128|CC|Roger.
1875138|PAO|And we can confirm the ascent stage tanks are pressurizing.
1875143|CC|Challenger, you're GO for TANK 2.
1875148|CDR|Okay, understand; GO for TANK 2. Ready? Okay. 3, 2, 1 -
1875157|CDR|MARK it. TANK 2. We got the squib.
1875212|CC|Okay, Challenger. Both tanks look good.
1875214|CDR|Wonder why they didn't balance off?
1875219|CDR|Okay. MASTER ARM is coming OFF, and the lights are out.
1875224|CDR|Okay, Jack. SYSTEM A ASCENT FEED 2, OPEN. Okay, monitor your - okay.

1875347|CDR|Roger. Understand. Challenger is GO for lift-off.
1875401|CC|Challenger, Houston. We think the transducer in tank 2 has shifted. We want you to monitor tank 1 for APS helium. Over.
1875413|LMP|Roger. We were looking at that, and we'll monitor 1.
1875417|CDR|What of this do you want?
1875419|LMP|I need the - the big one there, with the cards in it.
1875447|CDR|Here you go.

1881110|CDR|- - X, Z, Y.
1881111|LMP|X, Z, Y. All right. AGS is ready.
1881132|CDR|Okay, we've got P47. Standing by for 12:12.
1881136|LMP|Okay, it's 10 - 20 seconds away. Okay?
1881143|CDR|Okay, I'm going to do X first. Okay, let's do it.
1881202|LMP|Okay, you want 4. Little more. Okay?
1881209|CDR|Okay, and 1 forward.
1881213|PAO|TWEAK burn is in progress.
1881221|CDR|Okay. Here's 1 forward; I'm going 9 left.
1881223|LMP|Okay. Keep her coming, keep her coming, keep her coming, 9 left. That's it.
1881238|CDR|Okay, Houston, I read -
1881240|LMP|Now that's it.
1881242|CDR|Let me get this in.
1881245|LMP|Good, good.
1881247|CDR|Okay, Houston; 4.1, 9.0, and 1.1. - -
1881250|CC|Okay, that's good.
1881250|CDR|- - minus, minus, plus. Okay, 47.7 by 9.5.
1881302|CC|Roger.
1881308|CDR|There's those mysterious noises.
1881309|LMP|Yes, that's right.
1881313|CMP|Okay, Challenger; America. I'm going to try to get the VHF ranging reset.
1881322|LMP|Go ahead. We'll keep quiet.
1881324|CMP|Okay, reset - now.
1881329|PAO|And, we confirmed an orbit on the ground very closely - agrees very closely with the orbit calculated onboard of 48 by 9 nautical miles.
1881345|CMP|That wouldn't quite do it. Let me try it again.
1881408|CC|Challenger, Houston. We'd like FORWARD OMNI.
1881410|LMP|... 36.6 ... Okay; you've got it, Houston.
1881418|CC|Okay, you're loud and clear.
1881422|LMP|That sounds good on the AGS, Ron. Gene's getting lockon yet.
1881428|CMP|Okay; great.
1881446|CDR|Okay, that was me, Jack. I just reset the MASTER ARM.
1881448|LMP|Okay.
1881451|CDR|No functions left on it, anyway.
1881548|LMP|How you coming, Gene?
1881549|CDR|Coming good.
1881550|LMP|P20 going, huh? 26.6 breaking - -
1881555|CDR|That's not supposed to take those updates. Until I tell it to.
1881618|LMP|The AGS likes the tweak.
1881622|CDR|Shaft and trunnion look good.
1881625|CC|Challenger, Houston - -
1881626|LMP|We've gone 127 miles in - 430 feet per second.
1881627|CC|- - that 616 should be plus four balls 5. Over.
1881636|CDR|Okay, Gordy. I'm - good - good call.
1881640|CC|Thank you.
1881641|CDR|Okay, America; Challenger. We've got you at 126 miles locked up hard.
1881648|CMP|Okay, I got you 125.2 miles now.
1881655|LMP|You want that relay still on, Gene? We're getting a repeat on Ron.
1881701|CMP|I tell you what, I'll - let's turn the VHF off.
1881707|CDR|Up to you, Ron.
1881711|CMP|Okay, I'm just going to turn the VHF off.
1881715|CC|Challenger, Houston. There will be no vector update, no PIPA update. The NOUN 49s you're seeing are what we expect. You can go ahead and accept them.
1881728|LMP|Okay, Geno. You can - RANGE/RANGE RATE, shaft and trunnion are all GO - -
1881734|CDR|Roger, Gordo.
1881734|LMP|Okay, you like everything?
1881736|CDR|You can start taking your marks, Jack.
1881738|LMP|Okay - -
1881738|CDR|The DAP is changed.
1881739|LMP|- - 122. AGS likes the range.
1881744|CC|Challenger, Houston. Also you're GO for APS TPI.
1881751|CDR|Roger. GO for APS TPI. We're looking good onboard.
1881801|CC|America, Houston - -
1881802|LMP|Okay.
1881802|CC|- - the NOUN 29 you have there looks good to us.
1881807|LMP|Okay, I checked the inverter. You can pull INVERTER 1 breaker.
1881810|CDR|INVERTER 1 breaker PULLED.
1881812|CMP|I'm going to ... Okay, you want me to - you're not going to ship me a vector?
1881818|CC|Negative. No up-link for you either, Ron.
1881825|CMP|Okay.
1881904|LMP|Houston, you happy with the OMNIs from the Challenger?
1881910|CC|That's affirmative. Keep it like it is.
1881918|LMP|Okay. Terminator's coming up, Geno. We got lights and everything we need?
1881931|PAO|This is Apollo control. We show the lunar module, Challenger, in an orbit of 47.9 by 9.3 nautical miles now. The CSM in a nearly circular 62 nautical mile orbit. The flight dynamics officer at this time is working up the information that will be used by the lunar module crew in their terminal phase initiation maneuver that puts the lunar module on an intersecting orbit with the command module to be performed with the ascent propulsion system engine.
1882000|LMP|AGS looks good.
1882002|CMP|Challenger, America. I don't see you in the sextant yet. But it's probably because of Sun shafting or something.
1882033|LMP|Okay, anytime you want them. Okay, ready? 188?
1882044|CDR|Hello, Houston. Challenger has a visual on America at about 112 miles.
1882050|CC|Okay, and America's just called. I don't know if you heard him. He hasn't got you in the sextant yet. You might check your light on. He is getting VHF marks. Over.
1882102|CDR|Okay, light is ON.
1882108|LMP|Okay, 55 and 5700. That's good. That's right.
1882118|PAO|That was Jack Schmitt confirming visual acquisition of the Command Module about 112 miles away.
1882202|LMP|The AGS saw that out of plane, Geno.
1882237|CC|Challenger, this is Houston. I have a MSFN TPI for you.
1882244|LMP|Go ahead.
1882246|CC|Okay. DELTA-V is a plus 74.0; Y, plus 3.9; and Z, plus 9.0. DELTA-V total is 74.7. And, for once, they didn't give us the braking, Jack.
1882310|LMP|(Laughter) Okay, plus 74.0, plus 3.9, plus 9.0, and total 74.0.
1882324|CC|That total is 74.7.
1882330|LMP|Sorry. Okay, 74.7.
1882406|LMP|I'm working on my third mark.
1882408|CDR|And, Houston; Challenger. I still have a visual on America.
1882413|CC|Okay. I'm sure Ron's problem is he is looking into the Sun.
1882419|CDR|That's right because he's sunlit up there.
1882421|CMP|Oh, you are correct, Houston.
1882423|CC|Challenger, we'd like AFT OMNI now.
1882429|LMP|Okay, going AFT.
1882438|CMP|America, how do you read Challenger?
1882440|LMP|He's not - he's turned his VHF off. You want it on?
1882447|CMP|I'm reading you relay now, Challenger. This is America.
1882452|CDR|Okay, that's fine, Ron.
1882500|CMP|Let me know when you want a voice - VHF voice check, there, and we'll make sure we go to VHF.
1882508|LMP|Okay. And we're holding you at 93 miles right now.
1882514|CMP|Roger. That'd be about 92.7, which is probably the delay.
1882524|CDR|Okay, and you just went into darkness up there. I lost you.
1882537|CMP|Should be able to see you now, then.
1882543|CDR|Yes, we're also in darkness.
1882545|CMP|You sure you got your tracker light on?
1882549|CDR|That's affirm. I can see it flashing. We do have our tracker light on.
1882556|LMP|See it flashing?
1882557|CDR|Yes, I see a reflection on - -
1882605|CMP|Oh, I see it. Hey, I can't see you in the telescope, but I got you right in the sextant.
1882612|CDR|Good. Outstanding, Babe.
1882619|LMP|I got it. ...
1882626|CC|Challenger, Houston. No update on your LM weight.
1882634|CDR|Okay; understand. No update on the weight.
1882653|CMP|And, Houston, I'm going to accept that because he was about 1 degree - almost to the edge of the sextant.
1882707|LMP|Houston, can you tell Challenger what's wrong with our high gain?
1882712|CC|Stand by, Challenger. For America, go ahead and accept that one.
1882719|CMP|Okay, brought him right in - This is America - brought him right into the center.
1882739|CC|Challenger, Houston. Jack - -
1882742|LMP|Okay, Houston - -
1882742|CC|- - if you have a free moment, you might try the steerable again: PITCH, 120; YAW, minus 70.
1882756|LMP|Okeydoke, Gordy; 120 and minus 70.
1882829|LMP|Okay, Houston, that's AUTO or. the HIGH GAIN. How do you read?
1882833|CC|Jack, you're loud and clear. Looks good.
1882838|LMP|Gordy, I don't know what broke lock. Did you read us all through ascent? We had some up-link signal strength.
1882846|CC|That's affirmative. We read you loud and clear all the way. We haven't figured it out either.
1882854|LMP|Okay, we had a loud up-link squeal - -
1882858|CC|Roger.
1882858|LMP|- - on all - on OMNIs - on OMNIs as well as high gain.
1882904|CC|Roger.
1882904|CDR|That's steerable.
1882906|LMP|Excuse me.
1882908|CDR|Okay, Gordy, Challenger's state vector is locked in with the raw data. We've got 12 marks going for us now.
1882916|CC|Roger.
1882929|CDR|And, Houston, could we have an LOS time, please?
1882933|CC|Yes. Stand by.
1882954|CC|Challenger, LOS should be 188:51:15.
1883004|CDR|Roger. 51:15.
1883044|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We now show America leading Challenger by about 78 nautical miles. The two vehicles closing at about 300 feet per second. And we have about 21 minutes now remaining before we lose contact with the Command Module and we'll lose the LM, which is in a lower orbit 1 minute earlier than that. Shortly after disappearing behind the Moon and shortly after we lose radio contact with the two vehicles, they'll be performing the terminal phase initiate maneuver from the Lunar Module. That will be a burn using the ascent propulsion system engine, a 3500 pound thrust engine imparting an increase in velocity about 74.7 feet per second. This maneuver will place the LM on an intersecting trajectory with the CSM for rendezvous.
1883159|CDR|America, Challenger. We got you now just under 72 miles, and we're 279 feet per second closing.
1883210|CMP|Okay, got you 71 miles.
1883307|CMP|Hello, Challenger; America. You still there? I lost all my noise.
1883313|CDR|Affirm. We're still here. And, Ron, that ... is coming right up the pike.
1883334|CC|Challenger, Houston. For your information, the out-of-plane difference that we - that you probably saw there during ascent was - we think, in the PGNS. The AGS is okay. There's probably a slight ... in the PGNS.
1883351|CDR|Okay, Gordy. Understand.
1883405|CC|Challenger and America, Houston. If that noise, which is due to low signal strength on America, is bothering anyone, we could break down the relay and let you talk to each other VHF. Over.
1883419|CDR|Yes, sir, Houston. This is Challenger. Let's break down the relay. And, America, let's go VHF.
1883425|CC|Okay.
1883427|CMP|Okay, America. I'm on VHF.
1883436|CMP|Okay; good.
1883442|CDR|Okay, Houston. We have America on VHF.
1883446|CC|Roger.
1883453|CMP|I still got your echo there, Challenger. This is America.
1883504|CDR|Okay.
1883509|LMP|Gordy, you want to give us an explanation of the ascent engine mixture ratio problem.
1883518|CC|Let me get that story myself. We're still looking at the data. I'll try to have one for you before we lose you, at least the next time around we will.
1883530|LMP|Okay. Yes. Go ahead. Go ahead. How many marks you got? 35.5. Okay. Go ahead. Go. Go.
1883611|LMP|Well, not very in well Z; 15 feet per second difference But it agrees with the AGS, if that makes you feel any better.
1883622|CDR|Hello, Houston. You were looking at our NOUN 81s on the recycle. That's 17 marks.
1883628|CC|Roger, Challenger. And what it was on the APS there, we saw an indication, probably due to a temperature shift, which was a possible indication of unbalance in propellant usage there. And it was sort of confirmed by an increase in the roll moment offset, so we just played the conservative thing and terminated ascent feed.
1883659|LMP|Okay, Gordy. Thank you. I was just curious exactly what it was.
1883705|CC|Okay, and it's no problem for our TPI on the APS.
1883712|LMP|Understand.
1883736|CMP|Okay, Challenger; America. I got some NOUN 81 for you to recycle.
1883743|LMP|Okay.
1883747|CMP|I agree with you pretty well.
1883800|LMP|Outstanding.
1883811|CMP|Well, I say TPI is about 4.9, or 5 feet a second.
1883819|CC|America, Houston. Let's try the HIGH GAIN: PITCH, 0; YAW, 30; MANUAL and WIDE and leave it in MANUAL.
1883832|CMP|Hey, relay to me. I can't hear then, Challenger. Can you do that?
1883845|CC|Challenger, Houston - -
1883845|CMP|That's all right. I'll get them.
1883850|LMP|Go ahead, Houston. This is Challenger.
1883852|CC|Okay, would you relay to America to try the HIGH GAIN: PITCH, 0; YAW, 30; MANUAL and WIDE.
1883902|LMP|You want PITCH, 0; YAW at 30; MANUAL and WIDE. That's pitch, 0, yaw 30; MANUAL and WIDE.
1883911|CC|Yes, that's affirmative.
1883913|CMP|Okay, I got it.
1883917|LMP|Okay. He's working at it.
1883920|CMP|It doesn't work. B is better than that. There's OMNI A; how's that?
1883929|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 188 hours 39 minutes. The noise we're getting on the communications circuits right now is coming from the CSM link and we hope to improve that by getting the Command Module in operation on it's high gain antenna, which will increase our signal strengths and should cut down the noise quite a bit.
1884028|CC|Challenger, Houston. Over.
1884029|CMP|Houston, America. How do you read?
1884033|LMP|Go ahead, Houston. This is Challenger,
1884035|CC|Okay. Stand by, America. We just barely read you. Go ahead.
1884042|CMP|Okay, just checking. I can read you loud and clear now.
1884045|CC|Okay, you're readable. For Challenger, the MSFN Z was kind of weak. We're expecting more like a plus 20 for the DELTA-Vz solution for TPI, and that's what all the airborne systems seem to be converging on. Over.
1884105|CDR|That sounds right. We prepared that way up here. Glad to hear that. Thank you.
1884110|CC|Roger.
1884119|PAO|The numbers that the crew aboard Challenger will use for the TPI or Terminal Phase Initiate maneuver are generated onboard. The numbers from the ground are used as backup.
1884129|CDR|And, Houston, Challenger. We're plotting them right on the black line. Coming right up the pike.
1884136|CC|Okeydoke. Sounds great.
1884147|CMP|Okay, Challenger; America. I got you 49 miles now. Okay?
1884154|PAO|Challenger's radar shows the LM now 49 miles behind the CSM, closing at the rate of 178 feet per second. And we have about 10 minutes now until loss of radio contact as the vehicles go behind the Moon. About 13 minutes 25 seconds until TPI initiate.
1884231|CMP|Okay. I'll check it again pretty quick, but I had the running lights and the rendezvous light on.
1884248|CC|Challenger, this is Houston. If you lose the steerables ... blockage, go to AFT OMNI.
1884258|LMP|Roger.
1884322|CMP|Okay, Challenger; America. They're both checked on. I'm going to check the circuit breakers.
1884337|CDR|Yes. They are both IN, and I - I just started picking you up in the telescope.
1884409|CMP|(Laughter) You're going to sleep with them. They're too big.
1884420|CMP|(Laughter) I don't care what you look like; come on back. I was going to shave and look nice for you, but I didn't have time to shave either. So - (laughter)
1884446|PAO|That's Ron Evans aboard America that we're hearing right now.
1884453|CMP|Yes, I heard you lost a couple fenders or something.
1884648|CMP|I'm with you. I'm already in final comm.
1884652|CDR|Okay, Houston ...
1884657|CMP|Your what?
1884659|CDR|... ETA ...
1884705|CMP|Well, let me doublecheck it. 188:55:57.00.
1884712|CDR|Beautiful.
1884713|CMP|We're lucky. (Laughter)
1884719|CMP|That's right.
1884720|CDR|...
1884727|CMP|Okay, you ready to copy my NOUN 81s?
1884731|CDR|Go ahead.
1884732|CMP|Minus 75.9 minus 4.8 - -
1884735|CC|Challenger, Houston. We'd like AFT OMNI now.
1884747|CMP|- - and Z is a minus 17.6.
1884805|CMP|Okay, copy correctly. I'm going to maneuver to TPI attitude.
1884823|CC|America, Houston. We'd like NARROW and REACQ on the HIGH GAIN.
1884937|CC|Challenger, Houston. We see you heading toward gimbal lock. Over.
1884944|CDR|No, you don't. I'm just rolling - yawing.
1884951|CC|Okay, let me check back on that call; sorry.
1884956|CDR|Yes, this is just normal procedure. I'm rolling 180.
1885001|CC|Okay, we're about 2 minutes to LOS. All the solutions look good to us. I guess, if we apply the voting logic, we go with the PGNS. Over.
1885013|CDR|Okay, we've already decided that we are going to go with the PGNS. All the solutions look good on our onboard comparison, Gordo.
1885021|CC|Roger.
1885043||BEGIN LUNAR REV 52
1885044|PAO|This is Apollo control. We've had loss of signal now from the LM and about 1 more minute we'll lose contact with Ron Evans aboard the Command Module, America. As the two vehicles go behind the Moon on the 51st revolution. Challenger, will be performing the terminal phase initiation maneuver in about 4 minutes 30 seconds. This maneuver computed onboard and their time of ignition and Ground Elapsed Time will be 188 hours 55 minutes 57 seconds. This burn again performed with the ascent propulsion system engine a very short burn between 2 and 3 seconds in duration. And when last we had data from the lunar module radar it showed Challenger 39 miles behind America closing at a rate of about a hundred feet per second. And we've had loss of signal now from the Command Module. We'll be reacquireing vehicles in about 45 minutes. And at that time Challenger should be closing with America going through the final breaking prior to station keeping leading up to docking. The following is a statement from the President of the United Stated of America. "As the Challenger leaves the surface of the Moon we are conscience not of what we leave behind, but of what lies before us. The dreams that draw humanity forward seem always to be redeemed if we believe in them strongly enough and pursue them with diligence and courage. Once we stood mystified by the stars today we reach up to them. we do this not only because it is man's destiny to dream the impossible, to dare the impossible and to do the impossible. But also, because in space as on Earth, there are new answers and new opportunities for the improvement and the enlargement of human existance. This may be the last time in this century that men will walk on the Moon, but space exploration will continue. The benefits of space exploration will continue. The search for knowledge through the exploration of space will continue, and there will be new dreams to pursue based on what we have learned. So let us not mistake the significance nor miss the majesty of what we have witnessed. Few events have ever marked so clearly the passage of history from one epoch to another. If we understand this about the last flight of Apollo then truly we shall have touched a many splendored thing. To Gene Cernan, Jack Schmitt and Ronald Evans we say Godspeed, and safely back to this good Earth." This statement will be available in the MSC news center.
1885815|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 188 hours 59 minutes. About 2 minutes 45 seconds ago, Challenger should have performed the Terminal Phase Initiation maneuver that will put the LM on an intersecting trajectory with the Command Module. We would like to recapitulate the lunar liftoff which was nearly normal in all respects. The liftoff occurred at Ground Elapsed Time of 188 hours 1 minute 36 seconds and shutdown occurred 7 minutes 20 seconds, both as predicted. The onboard guidance system, the primary guidance system of the LM calculated an initial orbit of 48 by 9 nautical miles. Correction of 50 by 9 nautical miles, and on the ground we calculated an orbit agreeing very closely with that of 48 by 9. The CSM at this time in an orbit 62 nautical miles circular, nearly circular. There was a period of time during the early phase of the liftoff, at pitchover, which occurs at about 10 seconds, when we lost tracking data. This loss of data lasted for about 3 minutes. Now later in the powered ascent, there was a period of time where the crew aboard Challenger was not receiving voice communications from the Control Center, although we were receiving communications from the LM and we were relaying messages through the Command Module to the Lunar Module. And we don't have an assessment of what caused that problem at this time. We expect to get further information on that later. We'll be reacquiring the vehicles in about 35 minutes as they come back around on the front side of the Moon on the 52nd revolution for the Command Module, America. At 189 hours 1 minute, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
1893402|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 189 hours, 34 minutes. We're about 2 minutes now from reacquiring the spacecraft, America and Challenger. At the time we reacquire, the two vehicles should be about 7 miles apart with Challenger behind and below the Command Module, closing at the rate of about 5 feet per second. As they pass out over the front side of the Moon, approaching the landing site at about 190 hours Ground Elapsed Time, they should be in position for docking. And we expect to have television of that event. Docking is unlike some trajectory events not constrained to occur at a specific time, but depends on when the crew feels that they have everything aligned up properly and in a position to move in and dock. But we would expect that we would be fairly close to that time of 190 hours Ground Elapsed Time.
1893622|CMP|Okay, Houston, America here.
1893627|CC|Roger, America. You're loud and clear.
1893633|CMP|Okay. Do you have him on the tube?
1893637|CC|Not yet, Ron. I'll let you know.
1893641|PAO|And we have a good television picture.
1893641|CMP|Okay.
1893643|CDR|Okay, Houston, we're reading you loud and clear. We're at 1 mile and I just broke into 30 feet per second. TPI was nominal.
1893654|CC|Okay, Challenger. That's good news.
1893659|CDR|Okay. And the midcourses were all less than 1.6 feet per second, and we're at 0.8 miles now - 5000 feet.
1893710|CC|Roger.
1893720|CDR|Okay, our next breaking gate is at 3000 feet.
1893725|CDR|Ron, I've got a platform. I can see the Command and Service Module now.
1893731|CMP|Okay.
1893734|CDR|We're at 4200 feet - 30 feet per second. And inertial line of sights are both zero.
1893744|CC|America and Challenger, this is Houston. And, we've got a good picture of the Challenger coming up from the surface of the Moon.
1893755|CMP|(Laughter) it's coming straight up, all right.
1893805|CDR|Okay, Ron. Coming up to 3000 feet. I'm going to brake off to 20.
1893809|CMP|Okay.
1893810|CDR|Hold on; here we go.
1893830|CDR|Okay, we're 2500 feet and 20.7 feet per second. Fifteen on 110.
1893848|CDR|Got you centered in the needles, Ron.
1893851|CMP|Okay. You're looking good.
1893857|CDR|Coming up right at - you at - under 114 - 116 degrees. 1900 feet, 20 feet per second.
1893908|CMP|Okay. Quarter of a mile, I got you.
1893919|CDR|I can see your thrusters firing now, Ron. We're at 1500 feet braking.
1893923|CMP|Okay.
1893946|CDR|Okay, Ron. We're at 1200 feet and 8.8 feet per second.
1893954|CMP|Okay, that's about right. Concur.
1893956|CDR|Yes, you do have a stub of an antenna out there on the same side that the VHF antenna's on.
1894001|CMP|Yes, how far is it sticking out?
1894002|CDR|I can't tell yet, but about - from where I am, about a third of the way - a third of the length of the VHF antenna.
1894010|CMP|Oh, that's not very far.
1894012|CDR|No. Okay, we're at 970 feet.
1894034|CDR|800 feet and we're at 8.8 feet per second.
1894043|CMP|Looks like Challenger's in good shape. I don't see anything hanging down or anything.
1894047|CDR|She's in excellent shape. Okay, we're at 650 feet and 8.8.
1894054|CMP|Okay.
1894055|CDR|God, you look pretty. Yes, you just got a small stub, Ron. Probably not more than a couple of feet.
1894102|CMP|(Laughter)
1894103|CDR|600 feet, braking to 5. Okay, I've got 5.0, and I'm at 520 feet.
1894125|CDR|Ron, I'm closing at 5 feet per second, 440 feet.
1894128|CMP|Okay.
1894132|CDR|Good to see you.
1894134|CMP|Good to have you all back up here.
1894137|CDR|It's been a good trip. Okay, I'm at 5 feet per second and 350 feet.
1894155|PAO|Challenger's coming in with the crew in the - nearly heads down position as seen on the television monitor.
1894158|CDR|Taking off a couple. I'm at 3 feet per second, 280.
1894209|CDR|Just great. Okay, Ron, 240 feet and 3 feet per second.
1894216|CMP|Okay, keep her coming. Nice and easy. Getting a lot of pictures.
1894230|CDR|200 feet and 3 feet per second. I got 2 feet per second and I'm at 170 feet.
1894300|CDR|140 feet and 2 feet per second. About 3 feet of that antenna, Ron, and we'll get a better look at it when you pitch over.
1894310|CMP|Okay.
1894314|CDR|Everything else looks clean.
1894316|CMP|Man, that Challenger's a beautiful vehicle.
1894318|CDR|You bet you.
1894321|CMP|One little strap flopping on the top of it, and that's all.
1894325|CDR|Okay, I've got 2 feet per second; I'm at 100.
1894336|CMP|Hey, Houston, you can see that strap flopping up there now on the TV, but that's the only thing.
1894343|CC|Okay, Ron. We haven't picked it out, but we do have a perfect picture.
1894352|CDR|Ron, I'm sneaking in at about - a little over 1 foot per second.
1894355|CMP|Okay, I'm trying to keep you on the - the tube here, so - How come you - how come you guys do everything upside down?
1894412|CDR|Okay, let's let it drift in like this slowly.
1894414|CMP|Okay. You still have it.
1894418|CDR|I've still got it.
1894427|CDR|Ron, I'm going to stop it here, and you can do your maneuver.
1894431|CMP|Okay.
1894433|CDR|Okay, I'm stationkeeping on you.
1894435|CMP|Okay; I'll do my VERB 49.
1894439|CDR|Seem okay, Jack?
1894439|LMP|Yes.
1894440|CDR|Okay.
1894443|CMP|Oh, I got to get a picture here, too.
1894454|CMP|Okay, will do. Stand by.
1894458|CMP|Just another couple of pictures here. Got them. 25 ENTER. 319, 254, and 0 ... Okay, you ready, Jack?
1894521|CDR|I'll ... that; Jack.
1894521|LMP|...
1894523|CMP|Okay, here we go.
1894525|CMP|MARK it. ... a minute.
1894543|CDR|Yes, I'm going to get the radar out of the way, but I'm not going to. I'll lose him here as soon as his transponder get out. I'm going to just stationkeep. Ron, your probe looks good. I can see it extended.
1894555|CMP|Okay; great.
1894559|CDR|The radar holds you - well, we don't hold you anymore.
1894611|PAO|Ron Evans will now maneuver the CSM into position for the final docking.
1894619|CDR|... Radar's being stowed now, Ron.
1894626|CMP|Okay.
1894635|CC|America, we'd like OMNI Delta, please.
1894637|CDR|Houston, America and - -
1894640|CMP|OMNI ... -
1894643|CDR|Houston, America and Challenger - are ... a good tight Navy formation.
1894650|CC|Roger, Geno.
1894651|PAO|We've switched to one of the omnidirectional antennas on the Command Module, and we won't have television back until we get back on the high gain antenna, which should be shortly.
1894703|CDR|Hey, Ron. I may have to take back what I said. That thing I thought was an antenna is nothing more than your EVA light out there.
1894708|CMP|(Laughter) Okay.
1894709|CDR|From where I was, it looked like - looked like it was coming out the other side - -
1894713|CMP|Yes.
1894713|CDR|- - but I think you're clean.
1894714|CMP|Okay. Now the one I'm concerned about is on - is on the other side from the EVA antenna - EVA light.
1894719|CDR|No-uh uh. You were clean over there.
1894721|CMP|Oh, okay.
1894733|CMP|The bottom of your vehicle's got a bunch of tinfoil on it. It's a little bit scorched; but it's all intact, as far as - as much as I can tell.
1894742|CDR|... this bird is good enough to fly again. Yes sir. I'll even move left, how's that? Still got 60 percent left ... I like to fly.
1894820|CDR|You in your maneuver, Ron?
1894821|CMP|Yes. It's maneuvering now.
1894823|CDR|Okay, I'm going to go out and take a peek at your SIM bay up here. Yes, I know.
1894843|PAO|Our instrumentation and communications engineer estimates that it will be 10 to 12 minutes before we're in position to get the high gain antenna and television back.
1894911|CDR|See him okay, Jack? See him okay?
1894935|CMP|Okay, we're getting pretty close now. About another 5 degrees of roll is all. Can you see it?
1894954|CDR|Yes.
1894955|CMP|How does the mapping camera look? Should be all covered up.
1895010|CDR|Stand by.
1895012|CMP|Okay.
1895013|CDR|... fly over there and take a look at it.
1895015|CMP|Okay.
1895021|CDR|Sun's shining right in it.
1895028|CDR|Okay, Ron. It looks intact here. There's one cover - -
1895033|CC|Challenger, Houston. Over.
1895034|CDR|... cover on the right-hand side. Go ahead.
1895038|CC|We'd like you take a special look at the pan camera and see if you think maybe the lens is not completely stowed. Over.
1895053|CDR|Well, I'm looking at this thing upside down. There's the Sun - give me the location again of the pan camera, Houston.
1895103|CC|It's a round, barrel-type object, approximately right in the center of the SIM bay.
1895113|CMP|It's just - if you were standing in the shoes, the pan camera would be right in front of you.
1895118|CDR|It's stowed; it's flush. There's one door open, Ron. If you were standing in the shoes, it's at the bottom hand - bottom left-hand side of the SIM bay.
1895131|CMP|Bottom left-hand side, if you're standing in the shoes.
1895134|CDR|Yes. It looks like two covers open there. Doesn't it, Jack?
1895137|CMP|Yes. Okay; well, that's part of the mapping camera - bottom of that door that pushes open by itself.
1895143|CDR|Okay, Well that's the only thing that's open. Everything is flush.
1895146|CMP|Okay. You think - is that a door that extends - if you're standing in the shoes - that extends out the bottom of the SIM bay or one that extends out - if you're standing on the shoes - it would be one the - extending on the left side of the SIM bay?
1895202|CDR|Yes. It extends out the left side towards the front of the spacecraft down in the bottom left-hand comer, if you're standing in the shoes.
1895208|CMP|Yes, Okay. Yes, that's the one that the camera pushes open by itself.
1895211|CDR|Okay. Well, that's good. I can't see anything that's abnormal down there. Everything's covered; everything's flushed.
1895218|CC|Challenger, Houston.
1895222|CMP|Okay.
1895227|CC|Challenger, Houston. Over.
1895229|CMP|Houston, were you calling America?
1895233|CDR|Go ahead.
1895235|CC|Some more words on identifying whether the pan camera is stowed or not. The pan camera, as Ron said, is right in front of the shoes. And, if it's stowed - well, if it's not stowed properly, you should be able to see the lens or probably part of it. And if it's fully stowed, there'll be just a plan-faced barrel facing outward - silver colored. Over.
1895307|CDR|It's stowed, Houston.
1895310|CC|Okay. It sounds good.
1895314|CDR|It's got to be - there's nothing - it's stowed. ... one more of those.
1895330|CDR|The only thing abnormal is the Service Module plates, just forward - plus-X - of the SIM bay, are all blistered - just forward of those EVA handholds.
1895343|CC|Roger. We copy that. Our concern - or the reason we're asking about the pan camera is - we have a higher than normal temperatures in the pan camera, and we were concerned whether it was either not completely stowed or maybe there's a heater stuck on. We'll check the heater out later on here.
1895409|CDR|I'm going around the other side here a little bit, but it's - Yes, the long barrel, through the center down - X-X axis, deep into the SIM bay - then you have a little barrel - oh, about 3 inches - 2 or 3 inches - like about a 500-millimeter lens on a Hasselblad - sticking straight up, perpendicular to SIM bay, and it's well flushed. It's inside the box that it's next to.
1895445|CC|Okay, Geno.
1895449|CDR|It's normal. There's nothing that's unstowed in that thing. Not again.
1895500|CC|Challenger, America, that's good on the inspection from questions from here, anyway. Clear to continue and proceed with docking.
1895512|CMP|Okay.
1895515|CDR|It is unbelievable. This is the greatest flying in the world, Ron.
1895518|CMP|(laughter)
1895518|CDR|Can you see me?
1895519|CMP|Yes, I can see you. Right in there.
1895522|CDR|Yes.
1895523|CDR|Reach out and tickle your probe.
1895526|CMP|(Laughter) Okay.
1895526|CDR|Okay. Let's get - let's get this business going. Let's get in a docking attitude.
1895531|CMP|Okay; we'll maneuver to the docking attitude here.
1895536|CDR|Ron, I can also see where your - where your HF comes out on this side, and - and it's flush with the box. It's completely stowed.
1895546|CMP|Okay. Well, that's the one that we think is, the one on that side. The other side is the one that we are a little concerned with. We don't worry about it.
1895551|CDR|It's stowed too.
1895552|CMP|Oh, okay.
1895553|CDR|We were over there.
1895554|CMP|Okay. And I'm maneuvering back to the docking attitude.
1895602|CDR|Your high gain is not pointing at the Earth, though, I don't believe.
1895605|CMP|Oh, we're not using it yet. It's pointing where the Earth will be when we maneuver back around.
1895611|CDR|Okay.
1895612|LMP|Another one from there?
1895615|CDR|I'd try 11 and 8. That's what I'm doing.
1895620|LMP|Right.
1895632|CDR|... Guess I ought to pull my radar breakers, now that it's stowed.
1895647|CMP|Okay, Houston, can you see my logic yet? Or you want to wait until the high gain? This is America.
1895656|CC|We can see it now, Ron. We can do it now.
1895702|CMP|Okay, LOGIC 1.
1895705|CMP|MARK it. LOGIC 2.
1895706|CMP|MARK it.
1895713|CC|Ron, you're GO for PYRO ARM.
1895717|CMP|Okay.
1895725|CDR|Backing off here a little bit, Ron. Give you a chance to maneuver.
1895807|CDR|Hey, Jack, what are we forgetting here? Let's see the high gain was - or the rendezvous radar is stowed. Okay, as soon as he gets his attitude, I'll get to mine.
1895831|CDR|Looks like you've been flying well up there, partner. The spacecraft looks good.
1895835|CMP|Oh, you bet you.
1895840|CDR|How far you got to go on your maneuvers?
1895844|CMP|About another 60 degrees of roll yet.
1895846|CDR|Okay.
1895846|CMP|And about 10 degrees; pitch.
1895903|PAO|Ron Evans now maneuvering America into position for the docking. The final few feet of the docking maneuver performed with the Command Module because of the better visibility from that vehicle.
1895916|CC|America, give us OMNI Alpha.
1895918|CDR|Okay, Ron - -
1895922|CMP|Omni ... Oh, no, there we go.
1895933|CDR|Okay, Ron, I can confirm your other HF antenna is stowed.
1895936|CMP|Okay, good. Thank you.
1895953|CMP|Okay, the PYROs are ON. Sorry, but I am out of film in the DAC. You guys will just have to - -
1900013|CDR|No problem.
1900014|CMP|- - be on TV (laughter).
1900017|CDR|No problem. Let's just get in attitude and get those capture latches in that drogue.
1900021|CMP|Okay.
1900027|CC|Ron, the high gain angles look good. Go NARROW and REACQ, and we should have you.
1900043|CMP|Okay. I'm in attitude, Gene.
1900051|CDR|Okay, let me position so I can get in attitude.
1900057|CC|And, America and Challenger, we've got a beautiful picture once again.
1900111|LMP|Very good, Gordy. We're happy to give it to you.
1900116|CDR|This worked out great, Ron.
1900118|CMP|Yes, it sure did.
1900121|CDR|Null PGNS, and then I'll give it to you shortly.
1900145|CDR|Okay, Ron, you've got it.
1900148|CMP|Okay.
1900149|CDR|Okay, you've got it. I'm going into my maneuver.
1900151|CMP|I've got it.
1900220|CDR|And that's the landing site down there. We pitched right through the landing site.
1900225|CMP|You did?
1900225|CDR|Yes.
1900227|CMP|Key, good (laughter). Your - -
1900231|CDR|Hey, don't - don't hit that hand. It's ...
1900233|LMP|Yes (laughter). Well, the drogue is still in there.
1900241|CDR|Okay. I've got you right out the overhead, Ron, now I'm going to yaw.
1900243|CMP|Okay, yaw her around.
1900247|CDR|Okay, here we go. What a super flying machine!
1900259|CMP|Still looks kind of tinny to me.
1900313|CDR|He's not going to have to do anything but thrust right into the - I might even get your roll angle zeroed for you by - by this maneuver. Okay, it's all yours.
1900322|CMP|(Laughter) Okay, I've got her.
1900323|CDR|Should be looking - I'm looking right up your window.
1900325|CMP|Well, I got to translate through the - sideways
1900330|CDR|The trouble is I'm looking right into the Sun.
1900332|LMP|Yes. Change these focus to 6 feet.
1900347|CDR|Okay, Jack, let's go over that thing again. We got anything else to do?
1900350|LMP|Well, you're at the attitude. We're waiting to confirm capture, and then you flip MODE CONTROL, OFF.
1900357|CDR|Okay. Wish the Sun would get out of the way.
1900510|CDR|Looking good, babe. Keep it coming.
1900512|CMP|Okay. She's looking all right.
1900524|CDR|Command Module looks just as good as the day they put it on the pad.
1900530|CMP|And, you know, so does Challenger, by gosh. You're missing some of the pieces.
1900537|CDR|Yes, one big piece we left behind.
1900539|CMP|Yes; right.
1900626|CDR|Ron, I guess I'm estimating you about 12 or 15 feet.
1900631|CMP|Yes, that's about right.
1900646|CDR|Got my reticle coming right in the rendezvous window.
1900655|CMP|Okay. She ought to be coming right in there.
1900658|CDR|Looking good. You're stable as a rock.
1900733|CDR|Bet I'll be able to get with that. Give me a little warning on capture, Ron, so I can go FREE.
1900747|CMP|Okay; glad to.
1900751|CDR|I can see all your docking latches - or I can see half of them now, but they're all looking good.
1900756|CMP|Okay,
1900819|CMP|Coming in nice and slow; no problem.
1900821|CDR|Okay, you're looking good, babe. 1 got you on my COAS right up in the middle of the window. Looking good.
1900859|CDR|Looking good.
1900901|CMP|Okay.
1900904|CDR|Must be a couple of feet away.
1900906|CMP|About 2 or 3 feet is all.
1900959|CDR|Stand by, Jack.
1901000|CMP|Stand by. Should be getting about the same size.
1901008|CDR|Looking good from here, Ron.
1901036|CMP|Stand by.
1901059|CDR|... to have it here.
1901100|CMP|Okay; I didn't get it. Let me plus X it.
1901110|CDR|Okay. You didn't get it.
1901112|CMP|Didn't get it. Okay. Might have been a little bit slow.
1901150|CMP|Stand by.
1901153|CDR|You got it! CAPTURE!
1901153|CMP|Barber pole, capture go to FREE.
1901155|CDR|Good. Start here; we're FREE. All you needed was - -
1901158|CMP|Okay, we're FREE over here. Let me check your rates. Okay, I'm squared away on the rates here.
1901202|CDR|All you needed was a little more DELTA-V.
1901204|CMP|Yes, a little more.
1901205|CDR|That looked good though, Ron. Very good.
1901208|CMP|Okay. That's a good one.
1901210|CDR|Okay, Houston, we have capture.
1901212|CMP|Okay, you ready - -
1901212|CC|Roger.
1901214|CMP|... we're a little bit - not lined up here, Houston.
1901219|CDR|What did you say, Ron?
1901221|CMP|Well, we're not quite lined up here. Kind of drifted off a little bit.
1901225|CDR|Okay; we'll stand by for you. Take your time.
1901228|CMP|Okay. Will do. Okay, she's coming back around.
1901241|CDR|Take your time.
1901305|CDR|We're still free, Ron.
1901307|CMP|Yes, I know. Okay.
1901328|CMP|Yes, when you're free, you know, you create a little bit of rates on the thing, too.
1901334|CDR|I know it. I can see that. Just take your time. When you're satisfied, go. But don't go until you're satisfied.
1901340|CMP|Okay, I'm not.
1901403|PAO|The soft dock mechanism between the two vehicles has engaged. Evans is in the process now of trying to get things lines up properly, before pulling the LM and CSM together into the hard docking.
1901416|CMP|Okay, she's coming back around now.
1901421|CDR|Okay. Give me a call when you start to retract.
1901424|CMP|Okay; will do.
1901504|PAO|Gene Cernan should be visible behind that window in the top of the lunar module.
1901517|CMP|Crazy thing.
1901520|CDR|Say again.
1901521|CMP|(Laughter) I get the right ... and then it goes around the other way. I think you're bouncing around up there, too, you know?
1901531|CDR|I know it. I'm just swinging free. Take it slow.
1901606|CMP|I think you're going to have to go to attitude hold. You're bouncing around more ... I'm not moving at all.
1901611|CDR|Okay. Stand by, Ron.
1901615|CMP|Okay.
1901619|CDR|Okay. I'm stable now.
1901621|CMP|Okay. Now let me come up to you.
1901655|CDR|Okay, when you're happy, I'll go free.
1901656|CMP|Okay, stand by.
1901659|CDR|Looking good now.
1901700|CMP|Looking good, yes. See, that's what we needed.
1901719|CMP|Okay, she's looking good. Why don't you go to FREE, and we'll go to RETRACT 1.
1901722|CDR|Okay -
1901723|CDR|MARK it. I'm FREE.
1901724|CMP|Okay, RETRACT, Here you come.
1901734|CMP|Bang! I got all the - two barber poles.
1901739|CDR|You got what?
1901740|CMP|Okay. (Laughter) Two grays, I mean.
1901742|CDR|That's better.
1901743|CMP|(laughter)
1901744|CMP|That's better, Okay, sounded good, in here.
1901747|CMP|Yes, sounded good in here.
1901749|CDR|Okay, Houston. We're hard docked.
1901751|CMP|Okay, SECS PYROS - LOGIC is coming OFF.
1901753|CC|Roger. Understand two gray.
1901755|CMP|Circuit breaker is OPEN. Two gray; that's affirm.
1901859|CC|Challenger, Houston. We'd like to bring up the steerable there. PITCH of 155; YAW, plus 40.
1901921|LMP|Roger. 155 and plus 40.
1901925|CC|Affirmative.
1901937|CDR|Say again, Gordy, a 155?
1901941|CC|A PITCH of 155; and YAW, plus 40.
1902020|CMP|Okay, Gene. You still free?
1902023|CDR|That's affirm. I'm still free.
1902024|CMP|Okay. I'll take control of it.
1902029|LMP|Okay, Gordy, there's the high gain.
1902037|CC|America and Challenger. I'd like to - -
1902039|LMP|Okay - Gordy, we're not - -
1902042|CC|- - I'd like to take a minute of your time here to read the following statement by the President of the United States of America. "As the Challenger leaves the surface of the Moon, we are conscious not of what we leave behind, but of what lies before us. The dreams that draw humanity forward seem always to be redeemed, if we believe in them strongly enough, and pursue then with diligence and courage. Once we stood mystified by the stars; today we reach up to them. We do this not only because it is man's destiny to dream the impossible, to dare the impossible, and to do the impossible, but also because, in space, as on Earth, there are new answers and new opportunities for the improvement of and the enlargement of human existence. This may be the last time in this century that men will walk on the Moon, but space exploration will continue. The benefits of space exploration will continue and there will be new dreams to pursue, based on what we have learned. So let us not mistake the significance or miss the majesty of what we have witnessed. Few events have ever marked so clearly the passage of history from one epoch to another. If we understand this about the last flight of Apollo, then trtuy we shall have touched a many splendored thing. To Gene Cernan, Jack Schmitt, and Ron Evans, we say Godspeed you safely back to this good Earth.
1902219|CDR|Gordon, those are beautiful words by a great American President. We're very honored to receive them; we're very honored to be able to serve our country in a way that we believe in. And we thank you.
1902237|LMP|Thank you very much, Gordy and Mr. President.
1902242|CMP|Mr. President, this is America. And we appreciate it very much. Thank you, sir.
1902256|CDR|Say, Houston, Challenger.
1902319|CDR|Ron, would you give us a call, when the tunnel's pressurized?
1902323|CMP|Okay. Stand by.
1902325|CDR|And also, we'll need a call when you get to attitude.
1902329|CMP|Okay. Will do.
1902338|CMP|Okay, your DUMP valve is in AUTO?
1902342|CDR|Yes, sir. It's in AUTO.
1902344|CMP|Okay. CABIN FANS are ON for the first time in the flight.
1902444|CMP|I got to get down there and turn the tunnel leak.
1902453|CMP|Okay, EMERGENCY CABIN REGS are OFF.
1902511|LMP|Houston, Challenger.
1902513|CC|Go ahead, Challenger.
1902518|LMP|Roger. Give us a call when you want us to go through the comm configuration. And we're going to leave the cabin fan on a little bit, keep airing out - filtering the cabin. And don't let us forget it.
1902534|CC|Okay.
1902544|CMP|Okay, Houston. I'm going to open the PRESSURE EQUALIZATION VALVE going into the tunnel. Can you keep an eye on my cabin pressure?
1902552|CC|Roger, America. Will do.
1902556|CMP|Okay.
1902608|CMP|Okay, there's 2. DELTA-P of 2. ... closed; we'll see if it stays.
1902617|CC|America, Houston. You need a PRO to get the VERB 49 maneuver to Jett attitude started. Over.
1902628|CMP|Oh, sorry. ... hit the stick again, huh?
1902638|CC|Ron, while you're down there, there's a couple switches on the SIM bay to check out this pan camera heater. Over.
1902647|CMP|Sure; go ahead. Just waiting for the DELTA-P to stay steady ...
1902649|CC|Okay. Put the PAN CAMERA MODE switch to STANDBY. And the PAN CAMERA POWER switch to POWER.
1902659|CMP|Verify. STANDBY. PAN CAMERA POWER is going to POWER now.
1902704|CC|Okay, that's good. We'll take a look at it a while and let you know when we want power off.
1902711|CMP|Okay.
1902823|CMP|Okay. Looks like pressure is holding good there.
1902826|CC|Challenger, Houston.
1902828|CMP|Cabin pressure is okay. We'll go ahead and take her on down.
1902835|CDR|Go ahead.
1902836|CC|Okay, when you get ready to transfer an OPS, we want you to transfer the commander's OPS. Over.
1902847|CDR|Okay; will do.
1902911|CDR|Hello, Gordy. Were you able to see the lunar surface lift-off?
1902916|CC|Yes, sir; we certainly were. It was a beautiful picture, and Captain Video stayed right on you. We saw you up to about 2 minutes into the burn. We could see the plume.
1902930|CDR|I'll tell you, if Challenger hits that South Massif and you're anywhere pointing in the right direction, you ought to have a spectacular shot.
1902940|CC|I'm sure of that because that camera is as good as any I've seen in a - in a television studio.
1903018|CMP|Okay, I've got about 2 - point 2 on the DELTA-P. And the equalization valve's wide open, so it must be about right.
1903044|CMP|Okay. EMERGENCY CABIN PRESSURE selector's going to BOTH.
1903136|CMP|Okay, I'm ready to open the hatch.
1903203|CDR|Ron, do you read?
1903204|CMP|What? Yes, go ahead.
1903206|CDR|Okay.
1903214|CMP|Yes. I still got about 5 on the cabin, I think.
1903218|LMP|... is the tunnel pressure up?
1903220|CMP|I got the hatch out. Yes, it's pressurized.
1903222|LMP|Okay, Just pull it open then.
1903224|CMP|Okay.
1903227|LMP|...
1903248|CDR|Okay, Ron, I'll be a minute or two before we open that hatch. We got a little work to do in here.
1903251|LMP|... egress. LEVA bags.
1903327|CMP|(Laughter) I don't know what it's like.
1903332|LMP|...
1903333|CMP|(Laughter) I guess it's great. Let me check the old docking latches.
1903349|LMP|... 6.
1903441|LMP|Okay.
1903444|CMP|Okay. I hear you. And, Houston, every latch has worked perfectly.
1903455|CC|Roger.
1903457|CMP|Okay. Let's get the probe out of here.
1903606|CMP|I was just bleeding the nitrogen out of the probe.
1903611|CC|Roger, Ron. And when you get back in the cabin next, we'll take PAN CAMERA POWER, OFF.
1903620|CMP|Okay. The probe's loose in there.
1903627|CC|Sure sounds like it.
1903629|CMP|Is there any hurry on that, Gordo?
1903633|LMP|What did you say, Ron?
1903635|CMP|Houston, this is America. Is there any hurry on that pan camera thing? If not, I'll take the probe out.
1903641|CC|Negative. No hurry; we have plenty of time here till LOS - 14 minutes. We want to see it before then.
1903650|CMP|Oh, okay. I'll get it out before then.
1903655|PAO|Evans will now remove the probe and drogue assembly and hand them through to Jack Schmitt and Gene Cernan in the Lunar Module. He'll also be transfering in the vacuum cleaner and a list of other items that need to be transferred out of the LM into the Command Module. After, gettings things as cleaned up as possible in the LM cabin, the crew will begin transferring samples and other equipment into the Command Module, and getting - begin the process of getting transfered themselves from Challenger into America. We have about 13 minutes remaining before we lose radio contact with Apollo 17.
1903656|CMP|Ouch.
1903700|LMP|... over here,
1903705|CMP|Don't lose those (laughter).
1903730|LMP|They might be in the data file.
1903759|LMP|... I got the bags -
1903812|CMP|There comes the old probe.
1903823|LMP|...
1903920|CMP|Okay. The probe is out.
1903924|CC|Roger, Ron.
1903929|CMP|Hey, does that - Do you want the probe right away, Jack?
1903932|LMP|What?
1903933|CMP|Do you want the probe right now?
1903935|LMP|No, and ...
1904013|CMP|Okay, Gordo. PAN CAMERA POWER is OFF.
1904017|CC|Okay, Ron. And before you pass the transfer list out of the Flight Plan Supplement, we have two small changes to page 1-11.
1904033|CMP|Okay. Wait 1 and I'll get it. Okay, I'm on 1-11.
1904104|CC|Okay, Ron - -
1904105|CMP|No, that's it.
1904106|CC|- item 17. Just change the last part of the statement "stow on A-1" to "stow on A-7"; and, on item 19 there, change from "stow on A-7" to "stow on A-1". That's it.
1904124|CMP|That's it? Okay? We can do that, I think.
1904130|CC|Okay.
1904130|CMP|Hey, hey! Here they come, by gosh. How you doing? (Laughter) Beautiful! Good show!
1904136|CMP|Boy, is it cold up there, it's hot as hell down here. It's stuffy.
1904141|CC|America, advise we're reading all of you on Ron's VOX.
1904152|CMP|(Laughter) Okay.
1904157|CDR|Let me just doublecheck all ...
1904222|CC|Jack, if your handy to it, we'll take the S-band reconfiguration now.
1904231|LMP|Okay, I'll do that.
1904301|LMP|Okay, Houston, how do you read on the AFT OMNI?
1904306|CC|You're loud and clear, Challenger, on the AFT OMNI.
1904324|CMP|Here's your old vacuum, cleaner (laughter). You ... No, it's not on. You want it on? (Laughter) Great.
1904342|CDR|Hey, let me know when you turn it on; it costs me a MASTER ALARM.
1904348|CMP|Okay, I'll turn it on.
1904353|CMP|Turn it on. You got the switch.
1904357|CMP|Okay.
1904413|CC|America and Challenger, both vehicles may get a program alarm on the computers due to the W-matrix overflowing. A VERB 93 will fix it in both cases.
1904429|CMP|Oh, okay. Should we just do a VERB 93 now for the heck of it anyhow?
1904437|CC|That's affirmative. VERB 93 on both spacecraft will fix them.
1904451|CMP|Okay, I got my -
1904507|LMP|Okay, Houston. I'm on the steerable, and I'll start tweaking to the best signal strength I can get.
1904514|CC|Okay, Jack.
1904657|CC|Jack, we think you've got the steerable up as good as it's going to get.
1904709|LMP|I think you're right.
1904724|LMP|Okay, and I verify I am in SLEW and not in AUTO.
1904728|CC|Okay; thank you.
1904741|CMP|Yes, are you going to leave us? Oh, okay; I got it. Okay? Okay, I'll get ... take care of this. Man, you guys got a lot of dirt up there.
1904803|LMP|It's clean now.
1904809|CMP|Oh. (Laughter)
1904854|CMP|One OPS, stowed.
1904903|CC|Challenger and America, about 2 minutes to LOS now, and both spacecraft are looking good.
1904913|LMP|Roger, Gordy; thank you. We'll see you coming around.
1904916|CMP|Okay, Houston, this is America, and we'll see you around there.
1904920|CC|Okeydoke. Adios.
1905013|CMP|Hey, Jack, you want a jettison bag?
1905016|LMP|Not yet.
1905017|CMP|Okay. Let me know when you want it - an empty one, you mean?
1905021|LMP|Not yet.
1905022|CMP|Okay.
1905125|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 190 hours 51 minutes. We've had loss of signal now with America and Challenger docked together in the 52nd revolution and we'll be reacquiring in about 45 minutes. The current orbit for the two vehicles is 62.2 by 61.6, and they're currently at an altitude of about 62.2, very close to apogee at this time. This is Apollo Control Houston.
1913401|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 191 hours 34 minutes, about 1 minute away from reacquiring America and Challenger on the 53rd revolution of the Moon. During this front-side pass one of the major activities here in the Control Center and also aboard the spacecraft will be to get the Lunar Module, Challenger properly configured for the LM jettison and the subsequent de-orbit burn that will impact at - into the lunar surface near the landing site at Taurus-Littrow. The Flight Dynamics Officer will be coming up with the numbers that will be programmed into the LM for that de-orbit jettison and subsequent de-orbit maneuver. Right now, we're looking a time for ignition, or rather, a time for separation of the LM of 193 hours 58 minutes, and a LM de-orbit burn at 195 hours 38 minutes 14 seconds. The LM will be jettisoned by severing pyrotechnic bolts that - pyrotechnic charges that in turn sever the connection between the two vehicles. And we have AOS. We'll pick up the live conversation.
1913438||BEGIN LUNAR REV 53
1913500|LMP|Yes.
1913510|CDR|Got a good ISA bag - -
1913515|CMP|Okay.
1913520|CDR|- and stow on top of A-2 ...?
1913525|LMP|Darned if I know (laughter). I've been sleeping floating around in the tunnel.
1913533|CC|America, Houston. We hear you talking.
1913537|LMP|Hey, okay, Houston.
1913543|LMP|Hello, Houston; Challenger's up also.
1913545|CC|Okay, Challenger. Keeping busy up there?
1913549|CDR|Yes sir, Gordo. I think we're moving right along with the - with the transfer and stowage. And we'll give you a hack here. We got the ISA bag over for A-2. We got the - two of the sample return bags stowed and a DECON bag, and they're over and a lot of miscellaneous stuff.
1913614|CDR|Jack?
1913614|CC|Okay.
1913619|CMP|It's my page, probably, yes.
1913621|CDR|Jack, is that -
1913626|CMP|... did it come loose, there? Yes, my whole book came loose.
1913639|LMP|You got something on your - -
1913643|CMP|(laughter)
1913645|LMP|... bags.
1913702|CMP|Thank, you. I'm checking some of this stuff off. Yes.
1913712|LMP|Okay.
1913725|CMP|That was a good one.
1913726|LMP|I didn't like that ...
1913833|CMP|Okay. Are you going to put the Buddy SLSS in the DECON bag and stow it on A-1?
1913838|LMP|Yes. That's in there now.
1913840|CMP|Okay. - Okay, the ISA has got the - ...
1913852|LMP|You just took the ISA bag, - the big ...
1913854|CMP|Okay, but it had a lens brush,16 millimeter mags, three of them?
1913900|CDR|No, we can't have ... like that.
1913902|CMP|Okay, so I got those in - -
1913904|CDR|The lens brush is there ...
1913906|CMP|Okay, those - those 16-millimeter mags are in R-13. Yes. Extra sample collection bags? You got two of those in there? in the I - in the ISA?
1913919|LMP|I need another -
1913920|CDR|Yes, there's two collec - -
1913922|CMP|Okay.
1913923|LMP|I need another decontamination bag.
1913929|CMP|Got one for the - that's got a metal plate in it somewhere.
1913931|CDR|That's it right there. That's got a metal plate.
1913934|CMP|Yes, that goes in the PGA bag, I think.
1913936|CDR|Huh?
1913937|CMP|That goes in the PGA bag.
1913938|CDR|Yes.
1913947|CMP|(Laughter) I don't know. I had a pretty nice little home here by myself.
1913953|CDR|You got any more bags or what?
1913955|CMP|I'm out of bags, I think.
1913957|CDR|... what are you going down there? ...
1914004|CMP|Yes.
1914007|CDR|... bags ...
1914010|CMP|Yes.
1914011|CDR|We've got to tie that ...
1914017|CMP|I'd - I don't even know what's going on in the Flight Plan. Let's see.
1914021|CDR|This.
1914022|CMP|This, I think. Isn't it?
1914038|CMP|Yes. What time is it? Let's see, 191:40. Let me check. One hour from now.
1914105|LMP|... What?
1914105|CMP|One hour from now.
1914107|LMP|No, no. We have two revs.
1914109|CMP|At 1 hour from now, it's supposed to be - Okay? Okay, let me get some out.
1914131|CDR|Let me work with this ... Jack.
1914137|CMP|Guess it doesn't make any difference which one goes where, does it?
1914141|CDR|Hey, Jack - -
1914142|LMP|Hey, Gene.
1914143|CDR|Yes.
1914143|CMP|You're tangled up in the vacuum cleaner cable.
1914154|CC|America, Houston. We heard you talking about the time there. As near as we can tell, you're right on the timeline.
1914203|CMP|Right on the timeline, huh? Aren't we supposed to be closed out in about an hour?
1914209|CC|Well, let's see - -
1914210|CMP|That right? Or not?
1914249|CC|Ron, it's about an hour and a half until you're supposed to close up the LM hatch.
1914256|CMP|Oh, okay. An hour and a half yet. Well, we should get it by then, I hope.
1914323|CMP|Hey, Gene. Do those SRCs have numbers on them, or weights, or anything like that?
1914329|CDR|Both weigh the same ...
1914332|CMP|Both weigh the same?
1914333|CDR|Yes. Almost.
1914334|CMP|Okay. Won't make any difference where I put them then.
1914336|CDR|No.
1914342|CMP|Yes. Okay. Switch.
1914419|CMP|Oh, that's all right. Yes.
1914437|CMP|Well, it's serial number 1007. It's in the B-6 rockbox area. I don't know how you tell which one's the number, which number's what.
1914527|CMP|Just a second, I can't get the other one closed. No. I - I don't mean that one. I mean, the B-5 rockbox.
1914540|CDR|Okay. That's good ....
1914553|CDR|I have to think about it. They are in the ISA, I should say. Did you want the ...?
1914612|CMP|Oops, I got the B-6 back again (laughter).
1914618|CDR|You ready for a ...?
1914619|CMP|Yes, I'll take it. Okay -
1914624|CDR|... on the back side of ...
1914625|CMP|There's a neat way to pass things back and forth. Okay. That's all right, we'll keep - -
1914634|LMP|Don't have room for it down here yet.
1914635|CMP|Okay.
1914636|LMP|How's the rockboxes ... ?
1914639|CMP|Let me look.
1914641|LMP|I've got one, but ...
1914643|CMP|No.
1914709|CMP|Have you guys still got your PGA pockets on?
1914712|LMP|No, we threw them away.
1914713|CMP|Oh, okay.
1914721|CMP|You didn't want any of the stuff that's in them?
1914723|SC|No, we ...
1914727|CMP|Oh (laughter).
1914901|CMP|You guys you got any - sample bags you can put in A-9?
1914906|LMP|Say again.
1914907|CMP|You got a sample bag for me to put in A-9?
1914909|LMP|No.
1914911|CMP|You don't?
1914912|LMP|Oh, wait a minute.
1914915|CMP|Okay.
1914916|LMP|Do you have a bag for it?
1914919|CMP|No, I just got an empty box.
1914922|LMP|Oh, okay.
1914927|CMP|No, it just goes in a lithium hydroxide canister.
1914931|LMP|Okay.
1914932|CMP|You want the canister? It's easier to just put the bag in the - in the thing over here. I think.
1914938|LMP|Okay. I'll send it over.
1915200|CMP|What's that? Okay. That's all right, I'll get it. (laughter) I didn't - doesn't look like it's going to fit.
1915211|LMP|It may not. You may have to ... put one in the ...
1915219|CMP|Yes, it's number 7, huh? Well, maybe it'll fit.
1915224|SC|...
1915234|CMP|Oh, it fits !
1915236|LMP|...
1915244|CMP|Sample bag number 7 is in A-9.
1915312|CMP|You know, from the looks of this dirt, no wonder it looks dark down there at that landing site. No, we're going to keep them all. We're taking them, back.
1915325|LMP|Okay.
1915327|CMP|What do you mean? Unused ones?
1915329|LMP|I don't know what this is all about. I -
1915337|CMP|Okay.
1915348|PAO|We're getting a one way bit of communications here apparently with Ron Evans, whose mic is on voice operated, voice operated mode. Triggered by his own speech and Jack Schmitt and Gene Cernan in the Lunar Module apparently operating their microphones in the push-to-talk mode.
1915409|CMP|Have you found the - waist tethers yet?
1915412|LMP|Yes. I got them - for you.
1915414|CMP|Okay.
1915417|PAO|And we hear Evans whenever he speaks to them, but we only hear the Lunar Module crew when they press the push-to-talk switch on their mic. Interesting to note that when Evans' mic is open, you can hear the vacuum cleaner operating in the background, presumeably in the Lunar Module, where Cernan and Schmitt are facing the monumental job of cleaning up the LM cabin, the things that are being transfered into the Command Module, and the same job is going to have to be done in part in the Command Module, from all the dirt that will be tracked in from the LM and from the rock containers that are moved into the CSM for stowage.
1915420|CMP|Yes, it's right here in the tunnel.
1915425|CC|Hey, do we need any toothpaste up there?
1915500|CMP|Yes, this one's about three-quarters gone, or half gone. Oh, okay. Here.
1915508|LMP|Hey, Ron, ... that?
1915513|CMP|Ah.
1915516|LMP|What?
1915522|CMP|We can probably always use that, you know.
1915525|LMP|Okay, I'll send it over to ...
1915528|CMP|Yes.
1915616|CMP|Hey, Houston. How was the quality of America's TV camera? That's the first time - first chance we had to use it on this flight.
1915624|CC|I don't think it could have been any better. We had a real nice picture.
1915631|CMP|Hey, okay. Good.
1915651|CMP|No.
1915655|CMP|I never did find that one set that you were talking about.
1915703|SC|...
1915921|CMP|Send the tape over here. You want it?
1915924|SC|Here's your -
1915925|CMP|Yes?
1915926|SC|...
1915931|CMP|Okay.
1920028|CMP|Okay, coming up.
1920036|CDR|I found a med kit. Did you say ...?
1920040|CMP|No, we - we only have about six more sleeping pills left, or seven, or something. I don't know.
1920048|LMP|How many more nights are you going to sleep?
1920050|CMP|Well, I like to - sleep about one more, probably.
1920115|LMP|Empty your jettison bag if you could get ...
1920119|CDR|That would get me out of the way.
1920124|CMP|(Laughter)
1920126|LMP|How about the jettison bag?
1920128|CMP|You want it?
1920128|LMP|Yes.
1920129|CMP|Okay, just a second. Okay.
1920200|CMP|One jett bag. Oops - Oh, the big one. You got to have a bigger hole than this to get it through.
1920214|LMP|Okay. Let's wait for Gene, then.
1920215|CMP|(Laughter) Okay.
1920229|LMP|Okay, Houston, this is Challenger. I think we're getting close to being able to take your up-1ink.
1920236|CC|Okay, Challenger. We're ready when you are.
1920243|LMP|Okay. You've got P00 and DATA.
1920246|CC|Okay, and I've also got the pads ...
1920302|CMP|Is that the book that's down here in R-2?
1920305|LMP|Yes.
1920317|CMP|I don't think I will ever find it in here.
1920318|CDR|You'll never find it in there, Ron; I just stuck ...
1920323|CMP|What does it look - is it a small book or what?
1920326|LMP|Some P30 pads and stuff.
1920328|LMP|Hey, Gordy, it looks like we've gotten - -
1920331|CDR|Get one from the command -
1920333|LMP|- We've got our Data Card Book - -
1920335|CMP|What do you need? A P30 pad?
1920336|CMP|- stowed away. Can you read each of the items, and I'll copy down the pad that way?
1920341|CMP|Hey, wait a minute and I'll tear you one out of here, Jack.
1920343|CC|Sure enough, Jack. No problem. It's not that complicated anyway.
1920350|LMP|That's right, this is an easy one. Go ahead.
1920353|CC|Okay. It's a LM deorbit pad, and NOUN 33 or Tig is 195:38:13.00; NOUN 81: X is a minus 0224.6, Y is a plus 0056.9, and Z is a plus 0167.7; the apogee and perigee are N/A, perigee is going to be minus; and DELTA-Vr is 0286.0; burn time will be 1:58; and the FDAI attitude - for what it's worth -here is 048, 138, and 075. Go ahead.
1920512|LMP|Okay, here's the deorbit pad. Tig 195:38:13-00; DELTA-V's are X, minus 0224.6; Y is plus 0056.9, Z is plus 0167.7.
1920532|CDR|Ron.
1920533|CMP|Yes.
1920533|CDR|...
1920533|LMP|Total DELTA-V is 0286.0; burn time is 1:58; and FDAI angles 048, 138, 075.
1920551|CC|Okay, that's all correct.
1920556|LMP|Okay, Gordy.
1920558|CC|And you'll need a LM weight for the DAP; if you want to write that one down, it's 5185.
1920613|LMP|Okay, 5185 is the LM weight.
1920617|CC|That's affirmative.
1920642|CMP|I never did get the purse back over here yet.
1920644|CDR|It's in here. You don't need it.
1920647|CMP|Okay.
1920732|CMP|Okay.
1920733|CDR|...
1920734|CMP|Yes, will do. Yes.
1920750|CMP|I think that's all the stuff - think that's all the junk.
1920832|CMP|Well, the - you know, we have more than enough to eat every day - the only food that's left is the - you know, the food that's to come up.
1920841|CDR|You got yellow pills?
1920843|CMP|Yes. We got more yellow pills than we know what to do with.
1920846|CDR|You do? Okay.
1920846|CMP|Yes. But that food that we didn't eat, it's gone.
1920857|CDR|What did you do with it?
1920858|CMP|It's in that big bag.
1920901|CDR|Okay.
1920904|CMP|(Laughing) Well - -
1920908|CDR|They must consider that you are the judge of that.
1920915|PAO|The big yellow pills, that Ron Evans was referring to, are the germicidal pills that are mixed with the food after it has been - the astronauts have eaten what they want the remnant is mixed with the germicical pill and stored. The pill prevents the bacteria build up and the subsequent build up of odors and so on in the spacecraft.
1921003|PAO|The last series of numbers passed up to the crew included the time of ignition for the lunar module deorbit burn. And the parameters that will be fed into the LM guidance system to control that burn. The result of which will be to impact the lunar module into the lunar surface generating seismic waves.
1921024|CMP|Okay, Jack, you still got your helmet over there, right?
1921026|LMP|Yes.
1921026|CMP|Okay, because I've only got two helmets here.
1921044|PAO|The LM deorbit burn is now scheduled to be performed at Ground Elapsed Time of 195 hours 38 minutes 13 seconds. This will be a 158 second burn, using the reaction control system thrusters on the lunar module and the burn will be controlled by the lunar module primary guidance and navigation system. With a total Delta V of 286 feet per second.
1921050|CMP|Okay. You guys say you got the LCG plugs with you, huh?
1921100|LMP|Yes.
1921100|CDR|Yes.
1921110|CMP|Okay. I want to make sure you got those. Okay.
1921128|PAO|The deorbit burn will give us a predicted impact time of 195 hours 57 minutes 12 seconds. And the predicted latitude and longitude for impact is 19.95 degrees north 30.57 degrees east.
1921130|CC|Challenger, Houston. It's your computer, now.
1921158|CMP|How about the monocular?
1921159|LMP|Yes. I've got it in my pocket.
1921200|CMP|Okay. It's in your pocket.
1921201|CDR|You got that?
1921306|CMP|You need this?
1921307|CDR|What is it?
1921307|CMP|Just a big bag.
1921309|CDR|No, I don't need it ...
1921311|CMP|Okay.
1921349|CMP|Tape? Okay.
1921351|CDR|Okay.
1921637|CMP|Well, if you br - if that's a good one; you just need one.
1921640|CDR|It's a good one.
1921641|CMP|Okay.
1921710|CMP|Houston, America.
1921714|CC|Go ahead, Ron.
1921717|CMP|Is it a mag Dog Dog for LM jett on the 16-millimeter?
1921726|CC|I'll check that. One other thing. We'd like H2 Tank 1 FAN, ON now to start getting it set up for the sleep period.
1921739|CMP|Okay. Just a second here. I'm stuck, can't get this - (laughter). Oh, Mr. Clean. You guys are so dirty. I'm going to make you sleep in the tunnel. Let's see, H2 -
1921804|CC|H2 Tank 1, FAN.
1921805|CMP|Which tank? Tank 1?
1921807|CC|That's affirmative. Tank 1 FAN.
1921809|CMP|Okay. To ON?
1921813|CC|That's right. ON.
1921818|CMP|Okay. H2, Tank 1 FAN is ON.
1921821|CC|And we've got a vector for you, if you want to give us ACCEPT.
1921828|CMP|Okay. The old CMC - let me get a big hatch right there in the middle of things. Let's see. There it is. Okay, you've got ACCEPT.
1921845|CC|Roger.
1922009|CMP|Yes, you guys keep the bag up there. And I get the - I get the rest of it.
1922015|LMP|We keep the bag?
1922016|CMP|Yes.
1922020|CC|Ron, Houston. The answer to your question is yes. Mag Delta Delta is the one.
1922027|CMP|Delta Delta. Okay.
1922035|CC|And, it's your computer, Ron.
1922035|CMP|... Thank you. ... Get in there in a minute. Let's see. ...
1922057|CMP|Okay? Apparently, you're stuck on something. Okay. Got it.
1922117|CDR|... Turn on the ...
1922124|CMP|Okay, I got it. You want some tape? The tape. Gene wants the tape.
1922133|CDR|Yes. I'll need it. ...
1922141|CC|Ron, Houston. If Delta Delta is more than 50 percent finished, then use Charlie Charlie.
1922153|CMP|Okay. I don't think I've used Delta Delta, have I? I'll have to look at it and see.
1922223|CC|Ron, one other thing to bug you; we'd like you to do the VERB 48 load as shown in the Flight Plan. It'll collapse the dead band so we can check and make sure the LM steerable is right on the money.
1922238|CMP|You want to do that now?
1922240|CC|That's affirmative.
1922244|CMP|Okay, why don't you read it to me, Gordo? And I'll get it, in the LEB DSKY down here.
1922251|CC|Okay, it's a VERB 48, R-l, you want 61101.
1922324|CMP|Okay, Houston; this is America. That should have collapsed it there.
1922349|CC|Okay, Ron. That caught what we wanted.
1922355|CMP|Okay.
1922510|CDR|495 ...
1922522|CMP|Yes. The jettison suited. Okay, Houston, mag Delta Delta looks like it's full. I was just going over the list of stuff here I've got. And I think you've got everything.
1922553|CDR|...
1922649|CDR|... bringing it back.
1922726|CDR|Okay ...
1922844|CDR|... bag ... too many pictures.
1922932|LMP|Okay, Houston, I guess we're GO or NO/GO for your LM closeout.
1922941|CC|Okay, stand by 1 on that.
1923022|CDR|...
1923028|CMP|Yes, we're in a jettison attitude now.
1923038|CC|Challenger, you're GO for closeout.
1923044|CDR|Okay, we're proceeding then.
1923107|CMP|No, I'm NARROW DEADBAND now.
1923109|CDR|MIN DEADBAND ATT HOLD.
1923111|CMP|That's right. MIN DEADBAND ATT HOLD.
1923112|CDR|GUIDANCE CONTROL, PGNS.
1923130|CDR|AGS MODE CONTROL, ATT HOLD.
1923147|CDR|... OFF and RECEIVER, ON. ...
1923247|CDR|Hello, Houston; Challenger.
1923250|CC|Go ahead, Challenger.
1923254|CDR|Gordo, how soon is AOS?
1923301|CC|Okay, LOS is 16-1/2 minutes.
1923308|CDR|That's what I meant - LOS. Thank you.
1923348|CC|America, Houston. I have a couple updates to go in the Flight Plan.
1923400|CMP|Yes?
1923404|CDR|Did you hear it?
1923405|CMP|What's that?
1923405|CDR|They have an update for ...
1923407|CMP|Oh, okay.
1923416|CMP|Houston, I'm ready for the Flight Flan update.
1923420|CC|Okay, what it is, is the CSM and LM weights for the DAP at 192:10.
1923429|CMP|Okay, go.
1923430|CC|The CSM weight with three men, assuming you're going to have three men from here on out, is 36545 (laughter). And the LM weight is 5185. And you might jot down a couple trims for three men aboard. Pitch trim will be plus 0.60 and yaw plus 0.81.
1923509|CMP|Okay, CSM weight is 36545, LM weight is 5185, pitch is plus 0.60, yaw is plus 0.81.
1923523|CC|Okay, that's a good readback. The LM jettison numbers are nominal as shown down the LM jettison time for Tig. and attitudes.
1923539|CMP|Okay, wait a minute.
1923552|CC|I realize there is no ...
1923553|CMP|Okay. 194:03:30.
1923604|CC|Okay. That's right for CSM sep, and the LM jettison time is on a page before there, 193:58:30.
1923622|CMP|Okay.
1923704|CDR|Okay, Houston. Challenger is going off the air.
1923714|CC|Okay, Challenger. It's been a pleasure talking to you the last few days.
1923724|CDR|It seems like an unfitting finish to a super bird, but it's got one more job to do.
1923731|CC|Roger that.
1923737|LMP|Take care, Gordy, and thank you.
1923745|CC|Sounds like you're planning to stay there.
1923749|LMP|(Laughter)
1923752|CDR|I speak for the Challenger.
1923800|CC|Say, one final thing. And sometime in the next 30 minutes, Parker will be coming on to take over here and, just for your information, today is his birthday.
1923821|CMP|Ah-ha. Okay, thank you much.
1923829|PAO|Parker is Astronaut Robert Parker, who is the spacecraft communicator, or Capcom, will be coming on to relieve Astronaut Gordon Fullerton on the shifts change in about 15 or 20 minutes.
1923904|PAO|After that last transmission, Gene Cernan indicated that he and Jack Schmitt were ready to return to the Command Module, close the hatch and leave Challenger to be jettisoned and later deorbited into the lunar surface. And again to go over the information for the Lunar Module deorbit, the time of ignition, which will start the LM on its trajectory toward the lunar surface is 195 hours 38 minutes 13 seconds. The deorbit burn will be a 158 second burn, using the reaction control system thrusters, providing a change in velocity of 286 feet per second, primarily slowing the LM down, and getting it in orbit that intersects the lunar surface. LM impact is scheduled to occur, will be targeted to occur at 195 hours 57 minutes 12 seconds and the target at impact point will be 19.95 degrees north, 30.57 degrees east, which is about 9 kilometers from the ALSEP in South Massif, and hopefully will be visible to the television camera on the lunar surface.
1924036|CMP|Yes, I can just barely hear you.
1924040|SC|I need the hose. I need ...
1924046|CMP|Want a hose, yes. What, the suit hose?
1924055|SC|Yes.
1924058|CMP|Well, I was thinking of comm. That's Jack's.
1924104|SC|... this one here.
1924108|CMP|Okay. There you go. Let me put the - ... connect in. Yes.
1924141|CMP|Hey, we ought to put this thing on there.
1924732|CC|Okay, America. You're about 2 minutes from LOS, and everything's looking fine right now.
1924743|CMP|Okay, it looks like the majority of the stuff is completed, so we should see you, ready to go, or. the other side.
1924751|CC|Okeydoke.
1924751||BEGIN LUNAR REV 54
1924903|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 192 hours 49 minutes. We're now less than 1 minute from losing radio contact with Apollo 17. We'll be reacquiring in about 45 minutes on the 54th revolution of the Moon. And, on that revolution, the Lunar Module, Challenger, will be separated and jettisoned from the CSM, preparatory to it being de-orbited and impacted into the lunar surface. We're having a shift handover here in Mission Control. Flight Director, Pete Frank and his team of flight controllers coming on to relieve the team headed by Flight Director Gene Kranz. And, we're planning a change-of-shift press briefing for 10 P.M. in the MSC News Center Briefing Room. At 192 hours 50 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
1933149|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 193 hours 31 minutes. We're slightly under 1 minute away from acquisition of spacecraft America on it's 54th lunar revolution. Still docked to the Lunar Module, Challenger. Challenger will be jettisoned during this front side pass. We'll stand by now for first call to the crew.
1933303|CMP|Okay. DIRECT O2 is OFF. The other day, mine went up to 4.5. No, it just goes that high; doesn't make any difference what you do.
1933317|CDR|I am, too.
1933317|CMP|So am I, right now. No, not yet. We got to wait until the O2 flow stops. Yes, it'll increase on up to - should be 4.1 to 4.5. Well, she's still going up. I'm reading 4.2 on the cuff gage.
1933343|CDR|4.1.
1933348|CMP|Well, we'll go on up to about ... Well, there's the total suits.
1933354|CDR|Yes, it's got 8 - ... 9-
1933357|CMP|8.9?
1933357|CDR|9.
1933400|CMP|Yes, it ought to stable off there. It's to about 4.3 - 4.4 on mine now. Houston, America. How go you read?
1933407|CC|Loud and clear, America.
1933411|CMP|Okay, we're in the old suit circuit integrity check at the present time.
1933419|CC|Roger, we're copying you live.
1933420|CMP|Okay, DIRECT O2 is coming down now - I mean the O2 Okay, O2 flow's coming down.
1933428|CDR|And, Houston, the tunnel's closed out. We're still at TUNNEL VENT, and the hatch integrity is GO.
1933435|CC|Okay, we copy that.
1933450|CMP|And O2 flow's down to 0.5, now. Yes, that's right. The - the suit Integrity check will pump you up that high.
1933502|LMP|It's a - it regulates through the delta over cabin.
1933505|CMP|Yes. Yes, maybe she might make it down to 0.4. Yes, it's going down. Well, it means you guys' suits are still on tight.
1933521|CDR|What do you mean? There's so much dust in the joint, they couldn't be anything else but tight.
1933524|CMP|(Laughter)
1933526|LMP|They're tighter than they were when we started.
1933527|CMP|Oh, yes?
1933533|LMP|But that lubing is just so it collects dust to make them tight.
1933536|CMP|Uh-huh.
1933543|CMP|Well, I was down to 0.4, now it's up to about 0.5, 0.4 and a half. All we need is less than 0.8. Well, I haven't been timing it. I guess it's about 30 seconds, though.
1933558|LMP|Oh, yes. ...
1933603|CMP|Yes, I'm happy; let's go to DEPRESS. ... Don't, go to OFF, yet.
1933610|CDR|Okay.
1933613|CMP|There we go - DEPRESS.
1933615|CC|And, America, Houston's also happy with what we see down here.
1933617|CMP|Okay, it looks like you've been staying around - -
1933621|CMP|Okay. Speaking of happy - Happy birthday.
1933626|CC|Thank you, Ron. Found out you guys plan far ahead.
1933628|CMP|Who, Parker?
1933628|CDR|Yes.
1933632|CMP|(Laughter)
1933633|LMP|What was that?
1933634|CDR|Ron, we'll - we'll drop Challenger right on the South Massif for you - for your birthday present.
1933643|CC|Thank you, Gene.
1933647|CMP|Okay. LM POWER's OFF.
1933650|LMP|Are you going to let the suit down or what?
1933651|CMP|It's going down. It's going down slowly.
1933653|LMP|Yes, it is.
1933655|CMP|We'll take it down real fast if you want to, but that's kind of hard on my ears. Okay, SECS PYRO ARM circuit breakers - I wonder if I can reach those. Yes. There's BAT A and BAT B are in.
1933714|CMP|And, Houston, America. I guess we're ready for LOGIC ARM if you are.
1933720|CC|Roger. We're ready to watch.
1933721|CMP|SECS LOGIC. Okay. Here goes LOGIC 1 -
1933727|CMP|MARK it. And LOGIC 2 -
1933730|CMP|MARK it.
1933738|CC|Okay, America. You're GO for PYRO ARM.
1933744|CMP|Okay. We - we'll wait awhile to do that. We're actually a little ahead of time.
1933803|CC|Okay. And, America, can you report - -
1933805|CDR|Houston, how does Challenger - -
1933806|CC|- - LM/CM DELTA-P?
1933807|CDR|- - look to you?
1933813|CC|Okay, Challenger looks good, but we'd like the LM/CM DELTA-P.
1933815|CDR|That's affirm. I - I'm seeing DELTA-P is off scale high, and I'm on about the sixth minute of my 10-minute tunnel vent, following 3.5 DELTA-P.
1933834|CC|Okay, copy that.
1933857|CMP|Yes, it does, doesn't it? (Laughter)
1933901|LMP|That's right.
1933903|CMP|Yours come down faster than mine?
1933904|LMP|Oh, you opened the old suit circuit relief. We're tough, though, us guys that go to the lunar surface.
1933911|CMP|Yes, yes. You guys got to be tough.
1933913|LMP|Yes. (Laughter)
1933916|CMP|We got a tough position here too, you know, if you want to try it. Just go to off.
1933922|LMP|Bet you life you do.
1933926|CMP|Okay.
1933927|LMP|I imagine they had you humping.
1933930|CMP|Yes, a little bit.
1933936|LMP|How we're back to screw up your routine.
1933939|CMP|Yes, that's right, you know.
1933944|CDR|Don't let us bother you, Ron. You just go about and do whatever you want to do. We'll just get clean for the next 3 days.
1933949|CMP|Okay.
1933954|LMP|Oh, we - we're down to 7 now.
1933956|CMP|Lower limit. You know, I can't even see my EMS for that Sun shining in here. That'd be a great LM jett attison [sic].
1934008|CDR|Ron's ears apparently are bothering him is the only thing I can decide.
1934011|CMP|(Laughter) Oh, we're about down, aren't we?
1934017|CDR|Couple of more pounds and we'll be there.
1934018|CMP|Couple more pounds? Okay.
1934022|CMP|Tunnel light are off.
1934051|LMP|We didn't hurt this end of the LM much.
1934056|CMP|Yes, it looks real good. I got some pictures of the bottom of it, too, I think. When you guys were going around there. And that looks real nice.
1934106|LMP|Well, you always were a bottom man.
1934116|CMP|Okay, let's see.
1934159|CMP|Okay, suit circuit integrity check. We've already done that. Okay, I'm loading the EMS to plus 100 and making a null bias check, right now.
1934223|PAO|As a precautionary measure the crew will wear pressure suits while the lunar module is being jetted.
1934250|CDR|Okay, Houston. I've been in TUNNEL VENT now for about 11 minutes after 3.5 on the DELTA-P, and I'm going TUNNEL VENT valve to OFF.
1934304|CC|Okay, we copy that, Gene.
1934316|CMP|Houston, the null bias check, I've got plus 100.9, starting out at 100, in a minute and 40 seconds.
1934327|CC|Okay, we copy.
1934352|CMP|(Laughter) You all done? You'll have to stay inside. Okay, align the old GDC; I just did that awhile ago. ... do it again. Good.
1934432|CMP|In the LM? ... In there.
1934446|CMP|Okay, we're right down here now, and I can't see that very well. Can you - do you want to read the - read the checklist?
1934457|CMP|Okay, uncage the BMAGs. RATE to LOW; DEAD BAND, MIN. Okay, wait a minute. We won't do that as late as 45. Let's see. Okay, might as well, I guess. Okay. And SCS. Oh, I don't use that anyhow, really. That's just - well, I really don't use that this time, anyhow. TRANS CONTROL POWER is ON.
1934555|CMP|Okay. I don't either. You're looking right into the Sun. We're looking right into the Sun so we won't be able to see it. Okay. Yes, I got this one going over here, but - it might still have something.
1934623|LMP|Twelve frames a second.
1934628|CMP|DIRECTS, MAIN A, MAIN B. Well, I'll wait awhile on arming those.
1934652|CMP|Let's see, we ought to go ... the old SUIT TEST valve to OFF now, okay?
1934659|CMP|Okay.
1934722|CMP|That's both of them. That's both the ascent stage and the - and the - Yes, we'll change that, too. O2, okay. That's good.
1934739|CDR|B/D roll.
1934740|CMP|Yes; okay.
1934753|CMP|And we don't need to be P30 anymore, we can get out of there. Turn the page over there and then you can see what the - See, we'll do the jettison burn and then we'll VERB 49 to a new attitude so we don't zap the hot exhaust into the SIM bay. And then we'll do a P41 for separation, see? At that new attitude. That's all over there in this thing. So, we'll do all that as soon as we separate, then we'll go into the preseparation - or as soon as we jettison, we'll go right to the pre-SEP checklist.
1934841|CMP|About 10 minutes to SEP - I mean to jett. Ten minutes to jettison.
1934901|CMP|Oh, that's all right - it won't work anyhow, see. So -
1935020|CMP|Okay, plus 110.00, ENTER. Plus 7.000, ENTER. Plus 349. Okay, that's the NOUN 22s for the VERB 49.
1935057|CMP|Yes. Got arm controllers in, that's all. We'll use this for time, jett effect [?] 55.
1935146|LMP|Okay.
1935150|CMP|Those two, but not the ones next to them; yes.
1935422|CMP|Okay, PYROS are coming ON. There's A and B. And all breakers are IN.
1935437|CC|Okay, America, we see the PYROS ARMED. Looks good.
1935443|CMP|Okay.
1935500|CMP|Get the - 47? Okay.
1935546|CMP|(Humming)
1935631|PAO|Two minutes to jettison.
1935659|CMP|Yes, must be.
1935713|CMP|193 hours. I don't know what day this is, really.
1935733|CMP|Okay, I can go into P47 now. Hey, could I dump him, or do you want to get to dump? Yes, that was your Challenger. Okay, you can dump him. I brought him up here, though. He was - he was a good Challenger. Okay.
1935807|CMP|AGS ON. is it running? Yes, it's running. Okay, 55. 55, 56, 57, 58, 59 -
1935833|CMP|MARK! There she goes! Yes. Well, yes, it's holding out. Hey, that's firing.
1935842|CMP|Hey, there goes all the docking latches!
1935851|PAO|Jettison on time.
1935851|CMP|Yes, everything else's right there. Beautiful. I hope this thing's working.
1935859|CMP|You know, Houston, this is America. I guess in the terms of some of the Grumman people down in Florida, the LM is a "wop-off".
1935917|CC|Okay. We copy that.
1935924|CDR|And, Houston, I think the last few days have proved that they really did save the best until last.
1935932|CMP|This a - I need you to get the maneuver in here, Gene.
1935934|CDR|Okay.
1935939|CMP|No, that's all right; I'll get it. Okay, go ahead. Good. Ready. CMC; RATE 2. Okay. (Humming) PROCEED. Boy, it's just stable as a rock out there. That's a STANDBY? Let me get some more pictures of it here.
1940021|LMP|I think you might take - I'm going to change the setting down to about a 2.8, get to the bottom part of it there for a little bit. Right, well, it's not quite at the bottom. He's right on the side, but -
1940039|CMP|Okay, 16: up, MAIN A, MAIN B.
1940044|CDR|Yes, we're maneuvering.
1940052|CMP|Okay, SAFE the PYROs. LOGIC 2 is OFF, LOGIC 1 is ON.
1940059|CMP|PYRO ARM, BAT A, BAT B, BAT A are OPEN.
1940104|CC|Okay, we copy them SAFE, America.
1940110|LMP|Okay, Houston.
1940112|CC|And your cabin looks good. LM also looks good.
1940118|CMP|Hey, great!
1940129|LMP|Okay, Houston, the preseparation checklist is complete, except for completing the maneuver and going to P41.
1940135|CC|Copy that.
1940151|CDR|And the LM is holding attitude very well.
1940205|CMP|Okay, we're going to get there at 194:03. 30. Okay. So Tig. will be - well, it's 03:41 - we can start we can - got so excited with watching the LM that I forgot to get going.
1940241|CC|Hope you guys remembered to take roll call before you let it go.
1940247|CMP|(Laughter) Say again, sir?
1940253|CC|And, America, we'd like HIGH GAIN to AUTO, please
1940258|LMP|... got it.
1940314|PAO|That remark was by Deke Slaton.
1940315|CMP|... Yes. We're there. Yes. Okay, there's average g.
1940325|LMP|Okay, Houston. How do you read on the Alpha?
1940328|CC|We read you on the OMNI Alpha.
1940329|CMP|Okay, trans CONTROLLER'S ON. Let's see, what's next? Need to time. ...
1940332|LMP|Hey, you called Alpha, did you not?
1940335|CC|No, we want HIGH GAIN to AUTO, but I'm not sure we can do it right now. Stand by.
1940338|LMP|That doesn't make any difference on the S-band.
1940342|CDR|We're burning now.
1940419|CMP|Ahhh, well, come on. (Laughter) ... Okay, there we go. - 0.1 to plus - well, keep the change. You can read it. Press on.
1940435|CC|17, we're not reading the NOUN 85s. Would you read them to us?
1940446|CMP|Okay. NOUN 85s were minus 0.1, a plus 0.1, and plus 0.2.
1940453|CC|Okay, copy.
1940458|LMP|Okay, Bob. You want me to get the high gain back?
1940502|CC|Stand by.
1940512|CMP|Okay, DIRECTs are OFF. Locked - locked it. We go into - we go into SIM bay configuration?
1940526|CC|Okay, Jack, OMNI Alfa is just fine, right now. You've gone past the scan limits, anyway.
1940540|CMP|Okay. Okay, we got SIM bay jett configuration.
1940555|CDR|Give them a mark though, Jack, from the - when we extend the antennas.
1940601|LMP|Right.
1940631|CC|Okay, 17. We're ready for you to start that P20 maneuver, please.
1940647|CMP|Okay, Bob. We're getting it there. Plus 90 52 ...
1940658|CC|Okay, 17, we'd like to hold the extension on the HF antennas until we get the high gain reacquired. We'd like you to go to P20 at the time we see that.
1940709|CMP|Okay. Will do.
1940730|CMP|... ENTER, Yes, that's when we can get there.
1940750|CMP|Yes, it's supposed to be the slow rate. Now, we're going ... fast rate.
1940800||CC
1940825|CMP|Okay. We'll give you a call on that, Houston.
1940828|CC|Okay, Ron.
1941056|LMP|Houston, America. Magazine Dog Dog is 40 percent remaining.
1941105|CC|I copy that.
1941123|CC|Okay, and, America, we've got a pitch of minus 67 and a yaw of 300 for the high gain.
1941244|LMP|Okay, Bob. Let me have the old Flight Plan changes.
1941247|CC|Okay. At page 195 - excuse me - time 195:15 - that's page 304.
1941302|LMP|Go ahead.
1941303|CC|Okay. It says, "Set HIGH GAIN MANUAL, WIDE" and the new angles will be pitch of minus 5 and yaw of 315. And the time will be 196:30 instead of 21 - 30.
1941328|LMP|Go ahead.
1941329|CC|Okay. You might also at that point write in "Verify all Command Module VHF OFF." I'm sure Ron will understand what that means. He's been doing it all along anyway.
1941342|LMP|Yes.
1941344|CC|Okay, and then over at 195:31 -
1941347|LMP|That just means you want the VHF off, doesn't it?
1941349|CC|Right. All of these, I think - three switches over there along the side. And BEACON, RANGING and -
1941356|LMP|I think I understand that.
1941357|CC|Okay. I thought even an LMP would understand that At 195:31, we're going to move "LUNAR SOUNDER OPERATE to OPERATE." The new start time there Will be 195:31:38. Over.
1941436|LMP|Okay. "LUNAR SOUNDER OPERATE" will be done, new time will be 195:31:38.
1941442|CC|Okay. And then next page at 196:20 which was the original lunar sounder stop time, we will move all that block which starts with "LUNAR SOUNDER OPERATE STANDBY and T-stop" - that will all move over - and goes down to "UV ON." That block will move over to the 196:30 time of the next column, and the T-stop time there will be 196:30.
1941526|LMP|Okay. I'm going to move the "LUNAR SOUNDER OPERATE/UV ON" block from its present position to 196:30:00.
1941536|CC|Okay, Roger. And the "VERB 22 NOUN 79" that was originally starting at 196:30 will be done following that block of "LUNAR SOUNDER SIM bay" stuff.
1941632|CC|And, Jack, there - -
1941633|LMP|Okay, Bob. is there anything else?
1941635|CC|Okay, in the middle of that section that we moved, it says "Acquire STDN," says "High gain angles," and those will again be changed to minus 5 and 315 which is the same change we made on the earlier page.
1941652|LMP|Okay.
1941653|CC|Okay. And that is the extent of the update.
1941701|LMP|Okay, thank you.
1941740|CC|And, America, we're GO to extend the HF antennas.
1941753|LMP|All right, stand by - about 30 seconds.
1941849|LMP|Okay, Houston, HF ANTENNAS - going to EXTEND, number 1 -
1941855|LMP|MARK it.
1941857|CC|Mark.
1941927|CDR|Houston, did you - was that mark for OFF?
1941930|CC|Negative, that was a mark that we copied you going ...
1941931|CDR|Going to have to square a new guy away, here.
1941936|LMP|Okay, I'm sorry, I'll tell - I'm going to turn it OFF - going to EXTEND again -
1941940|LMP|MARK it.
1941941|CC|Okay, we marked it again.
1941950|CDR|Bob, it was OFF for about 5 seconds, while I asked you that question.
1942113|CC|Okay, America. We copy HF 1 extended. You're GO for switch OFF there, and we're ready to extend HF 2.
1942123|CDR|Okay, Bob, and that's gray, now. And HF ANTENNA 2 -
1942130|CDR|MARK it.
1942350|CC|America, Houston. We're observing CMC in FREE instead of going through the P20. We wonder if you accidentally hit a switch.
1942417|CDR|Okay, Bob. I think we've got it now. Thank you.
1942419|CC|Copy.
1942452|PAO|America's crewmen are removing their pressure suits now. We show America's present orbit is 63.8 by 61.1 nautical miles.
1942558|LMP|How's that antenna looking - -
1942559|CC|Okay, yes. We're just going to tell you, it's probably not quite out yet according to indicators, that I guess you see. I would like to go OFF, though, to keep the motor from heating up. We'll come back on it a little bit later.
1942615|LMP|Okay, it's OFF and the talkback went gray, with it going off.
1942620|CC|Roger. Let's see, it was barber pole up until then, right, though?
1942627|LMP|That's affirm, Bob.
1942632|CDR|Houston, America.
1942643|CDR|Houston, America.
1942644|CC|Go ahead, America.
1942649|CDR|Okay, Robert, I just want to tune you in on our mode of operation here, for the next few hours. We're getting Ron out of his suit, so that he can operate more effectively and efficiently the SIM bay. And, then Jack and I are going to start getting out of our suits and trying to clean up a little bit, and that's going to probably be a long and tedious operation but we're just going to have to take that time.
1942717|CC|Okay. We copy that. And, Ron, HF 2 is the one - -
1942725|CDR|No, we'll be - -
1942725|CC|- - that we're not quite sure if it's out and you might check a visual on that, I think you've looked at it before when it's fully extended and, and give us a clue whether it's 99 percent extended or not. And, go ahead, Gene; I think I cut you off.
1942740|CDR|Stand by 1.
1942751|CDR|Yes. Wait until sunrise, Bob, and he can look at it.
1942827|CDR|Bob, you're probably going to have to wait until sunrise to get a good verification of that.
1942830|CC|Roger. Copy that. I just looked down the Flight Plan and saw you going into darkness.
1942841|CMP|It's easier with us.
1942854|CDR|And, Bob, during this LMP and CDR suit doffing and CWD changeout and so forth, the LMP will be off biomed until he gets a new set and gets cleaned up and gets them on. So I just want you to understand all that.
1942913|CC|Okay, yes. We understand.
1942918|CDR|Okay.
1943048|CDR|Bob, what's the LM impact time?
1943053|CC|Okay, stand by on that. Okay, 195:57:20. So it's 57:20.
1943113|CDR|Okay, that's about an hour and 20, then right?
1943117|CC|That's right.
1943121|CDR|Okay. Of course, we're interested in the whereabouts of Challenger, so when the time comes up, give us a holler, will you?
1943129|CC|Oh, Roger. We will do.
1943134|CDR|We're still very much interested in her performance.
1943143|PAO|That impact time is an update from the previous impact time of 195:57:12. Present impact time 195:57:20.
1943949|CC|Okay, America; Ron, we'd like you to go on HF 2 there which we've got, apparently, most of the way out; but we're apparently stuck a little bit. We'd like to get the HF 2 to RETRACT for 10 seconds and then go to EXTEND for 20 seconds. Over. And we'll be watching here on the ground.
1944010|CMP|Okay, that's HF 2. And we'll go to RETRACT and, let's see - I need three hands here - VOX, let me get VOX. Okay. HF 2 going to RETRACT: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 -
1944041|CMP|MARK it. Okay, we'll stay that way for 10 seconds, we've got a barber pole - and -
1944052|CMP|MARK it; okay. And it's OFF now. Now you want to go to EXTEND for 20 seconds, huh?
1944102|CC|That's affirm.
1944106|CMP|Okay, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, -
1944111|CMP|MARK it. Got a barber pole.
1944132|CMP|Okay, 21 seconds and it was OFF. Hey, you said - somebody just told me about looking at HF 2. That's the one I can't see.
1944143|CC|Okay; we copy that, too, Ron. Thank you.
1944148|CMP|Yes.
1944157|CC|Okay, Ron, we'd like you to do that same cycle one more time. RETRACT for 10 seconds then EXTEND for 20 seconds again.
1944207|CMP|Okay. And HF number 2. 3, 2, 1 -
1944214|CMP|MARK it, RETRACT.
1944223|CMP|Okay, 9, 10; it's OFF. Okay, 3, 2, 1 -
1944232|CMP|MARK it; it's EXTEND. Yes, it was stuck right in there. Oop, okay, that's twenty - 23 seconds before it went to OFF.
1944302|CC|Copy that, Ron.
1944311|CC|Okay, we think it's starting to clear up, Ron. If you'll leave - put it in EXTEND and leave it there, we'll give you a call - or else until it goes gray.
1944320|CMP|Okay. 3, 2, 1 -
1944325|CMP|MARK it. It's going to EXTEND.
1944428|CC|Okay, OFF, please, Ron.
1944433|CMP|Okay, OFF. And it was OFF at a minute and 8 seconds.
1944440|CC|Okay, and I gather it was still barber pole, right?
1944446|CMP|It was still barber pole, yes.
1944540|CC|Okay, America, you're GO for LOS; and we'll be picking up on the HF path as per the checklist. Ron, we'd like to have you look on the back side - see which or any antennas you can see out there, just to give us a status when you come around the Horn. Over.
1944602|CMP|Okay; we'll give her a try.
1944604|CC|Okay; thank you.
1944605|CMP|I can see the one out window 1. Window 1 is the only one I can see.
1944612|CC|Copy that.
1944613|CMP|And that happens to be HF number 1.
1944714|CMP|Yes - Oh, here's a little - The electrical covers? Oh, they're - each one of them is in your bag here. Yes.
1944738||BEGIN LUNAR REV 55
1944738|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 194 hours 47 minutes. We've had loss of signal from America. When we next acquire on the 55th revolution we'll be about 6 minutes away from the LM deorbit burn. Ignition time for that maneuver 195 hours 38 minutes 13 seconds. Burn time 158 seconds, velocity change 286 feet per second. The impact time was updated during this revolution, now expect impact at 195 hours 57 minutes 20 seconds. The impact coordinates have not changed, 19 point 95 degrees north, 30 point 57 degrees east. This is on the South Massif. At 194 hours 49 minutes, this is Mission Control Houston.
1953041|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 195 hours 30 minutes. We are 54 seconds away from acquisition on the 55th revolution and 7-1/2 minutes away from the de-orbit maneuver. We'll stand by for first communications on this pass.
1953145|CMP|Okay. There we are at OMNI Charlie.
1953157|CC|Roger. America, Houston, We read you loud and clear.
1953203|CMP|Okay. Houston, this is America. Okay, for your planning purposes there, I got a little tied up and started the RECEIVE ONLY TAPE RECORDER at 195 plus 24.
1953223|CC|Okay; I copy that, Ron.
1953301|CMP|Okay, Houston. HF number 1 is sticking out where it should stick.
1953308|CC|Okay, we copy that and - Stand by. Okay, go STANDBY on the LUNAR SOUNDER, please, Ron. Somebody is worried down here. STANDBY on the LUNAR SOUNDER.
1953325|CMP|Okay, what's - STANDBY. Okay, STANDBY.
1953403|CC|Okay, and, Ron. We're going to do this one in VHF. Apparently they're still too worried about your HF antennas. So if you'll take your MODE switch to HF when we get ready to get ready to come out of STANDBY, we'll do it in the VHF MODE.
1953427|CMP|Okay. We're - we'll - we'll standby on your call then. Or I'll go to VHF now, if you want. Or would you rather have HF receive? I'll stand by on your call to go to VHF.
1953443|CC|That's affirm, Ron. You can go to VHF now, and stand by on our call to come from STANDBY to ON.
1953456|CMP|Okay, MODE's in VHF.
1953535|CMP|Houston, America. What - is somebody kind of afraid that maybe the antenna isn't all the way out? is that what the problem is?
1953540|CC|That's affirm. They're worried about HF 2 not being all the way out, and they think that they won't get much - if it's partially extended. So we'll see what we can get with VHF instead. And, right now, we're going to STANDBY to warm up the film cassette. It's too cold.
1953556|CMP|Okay.
1953619|CMP|I don't think I ever told you down there that mag Kilo Kilo was on frame 99 at the end of the rendezvous - and the picture-taking sessions there.
1953634|CC|Okay, copy that.
1953651|CC|Okay; and, America, we'd like to bring up the high gain since we're going to be using VHF. And we'd like PITCH of plus 25, YAW of 200, NARROW and REACQ.
1953712|CMP|PITCH of plus 25, YAW, 200; and REACQ and NARROW.
1953736|CMP|Pitch of plus 25. Okay. Okay.

1953802|CMP|Okay.
1953831|PAO|The LM is burning now.
1953832|CC|Okay; and, Ron, we'd like H2 tanks 2 and 3 FANs to ON.
1953839|CMP|Okay - 2 - H2 tank 2 is ON; tank 3 is ON.
1953936|PAO|The burn has been completed.
1953940|CMP|That end might stick. It might stick there, but the back of it won't stick to anything. It's the wrong kind of stuff. If that won't, this will. ...

1954735|CC|That's affirm. I don't know if you guys can see it out the one window or not -
1954743|LMP|We'll do all right.
1954755|CMP|Let's see - we should be what? - behind it, aren't we?
1954801|CC|Say again, Ron.
1954807|CMP|Shouldn't we be behind him?
1954812|CC|I should think he'd be a little bit behind you, right? Ron, I'll take that back, I think he is in front of you.
1954830|CMP|That's kind of the way I thought it would be. But, unfortunately, we're looking behind us.
1954835|CC|That's affirm. And, 3 minutes to impact.
1954840|CMP|Okay, 3 minutes to impact.
1955125|CC|MARK, 1 minute to impact.
1955133|CMP|Okay, 1 minute. Yes, we're right over Vitruvius A, now.
1955217|CC|10 seconds.
1955237|PAO|We've had LOS on the LM.
1955244|CC|Okay, we had LOS LM. And we don't believe we saw it down here, fellas.
1955300|CMP|What do you mean, you don't believe you saw it?
1955308|CC|That means that we didn't see it - on the TV.
1955313|CMP|Oh, on the TV, I see - I see.
1955319|CC|We are picking up the signal on the seismographa, though, the geophones.
1955509|CMP|Okay. Hey, Houston, I can see a bright spot on the South Massif - on the top of the South Massif.
1955519|CC|Uh, go ahead again there, guys.
1955524|CMP|Okay, this is America. I can see a bright spot on the top of the South Massif and, let me see, from the west you got the first hill or the first part of the mountains, then there's a valley, and then - there's a valley that kind of goes into a Y - it's a Y-looking valley. I guess, if you come from the east, it's the second ridge from the east, and right on top of that ridge is a bright spot. I don't know how big - I don't know how big a crater it should make.
1955618|CC|Okay, we copy that and we'll take a look at the maps and see what we can find.
1955627|CMP|And, I'll put a spot on my map, if I can do it here. Just a second.
1955630|CC|Okay, thank you.
1955704|CC|And, Ron, this is Houston. You ready tc copy an update in the Flight Plan, please, for me?
1955719|CMP|Okay, do you need it right now or should I mark this on the map first?
1955722|CC|No; oh, no. Go ahead and mark the map first.
1955729|PAO|The seismic recorder data on the monitor is coming from the Apollo 17 Lunar Seismic Profiling Experiment.
1955924|PAO|The preleminary estimate is that the LM impact was within 15 kilometers of the Apollo 17 ALSEP site. And the TV camera will be coming off shortly.
1960458|CMP|Hey, Houston; America.
1960500|CC|Go ahead, America. This is Houston.
1960505|CMP|Okay, Bob, I don't have a map with South Massif on it. You know with the meridian interval on the thing and it looks like the only thing I can use is in the visual observations book here - landing site 204. And, if you draw a line - Do you have that one?
1960536|CC|Okay, I've landing site 204 in front of me.
1960542|CMP|Okay. If you draw a line from Shorty to that Reseau mark, that's on the top of the South Massif -
1960550|CC|Okay, I copy that.
1960555|CMP|And then, extend about a little better than one-eighth of an inch toward Shorty from that Reseau mark. Maybe - Yes, somewhere right in there. I'll look at it again the next time I come over. But, that's a bright spot on the top of the Massif that I hadn't noticed before in any of the observations going by there.
1960629|CC|Okay, I've got it marked down. We'll also see if we can find it on some bigger maps.
1960636|CMP|Okay. Yes, you know that bright spot might already be there, but I don't think so. I don't remember seeing it.
1960643|CC|Okay, copy that. Okay, and, Ron, we'd like to press on with our Flight Plan update here for you.
1960650|CMP|... Okay.
1960654|CC|Okay. Number 1, we'd like to go HF 2 to EXTEND for 3 minutes.
1960706|CMP|When? Now?
1960707|CC|Roger; now.
1960712|CMP|Okay, 5, 4 - okay, countdown - 3, 2, 1 -
1960727|CMP|MARK it! EXTEND, barber pole, still.
1960740|CC|Ron, stop the antenna, please. My mistake.
1960746|CMP|What?
1960747|CC|Okay, Ron, let me read through this one for you. They are anxious to extend that, but they want the DATA SYSTEM, ON, so they can see it first.
1960758|CMP|Ah ha, Okay.
1960758|CC|Why don't you go to 196.20 in the Flight Plan? You're probably sitting there looking at it, anyway. And run through that block that's there. It starts at about 196:19. We told Jack to move it but since we're aborting this lunar sounder pass, let's go to 196:20 and carry out the steps in there with the following exceptions: Do not turn RECORDER or RADAR to OFF. And - Okay. And, we want LUNAR SOUNDER left in STANDBY.
1960830|CMP|Okay. Let me read those through.
1960832|CC|Okay, and don't move the HIGH GAIN. The HIGH GAIN has been taken care of already.
1960839|CMP|Okay, I'll do that. LUNAR SOUNDER is verified in STANDBY. DATA SYSTEM is coming on. HIGH GAIN is already working. SM/AC power. Jack, could you turn ON the SERVICE MODULE AC? Or, I'll get it. Yes. Okay. SERVICE MODULE AC POWER's ON. LUNAR going to STANDBY - -
1960917|CC|Okay, and, Ron - -
1960917|CMP|- - and we'll leave the RECORDER, ON, and RADAR, ON.
1960927|CC|And, Ron, while you're putting those last three on, let's start the HF 2 to EXTEND. They'd like to get it before it gets too cold again.
1960936|CMP|Okay, HF 2 is going to EXTEND - 3, 2,
1960942|CMP|MARK it.
1960943|CC|Okay, we'll time it for 3 minutes for you while you get the IR and so forth.
1960950|CMP|Okay, IR is going ON. SELF TEST is going to HEATERS. UV is ON.
1960959|CC|Okay, copy that.
1961026|CC|Okay, Ron. We see the talkback. We can go to OFF.
1961032|CMP|Hey, it did! Okay, it's OFF.
1961037|CC|Okay, I guess we'll try and probably work that in some other time, now that we've got the antennas out. And, we'd like to go HIGH GAIN ANTENNA to AUTO and 2-1/2-degree deadband now that we're not doing the lunar sounder.
1961051|CMP|Okay.
1961144|CMP|(humming)
1961209|CC|Okay, Ron, and did you get the HIGH GAIN in the 2-1/2-degree deadband?
1961216|CMP|Affirmative. Yes, I got that.
1961218|CC|Okay. We got that and I got a TEI-65 pad, when you get ready for it.
1961227|CMP|Okay, let me pull out the old book.
1961240|CC|Okay, and, Ron if you'll give us the computer, we're ready to up-link some loads for you. You'll leave the jet-on monitor and state vector.
1961253|CMP|You can have the computer.
1961253|CC|Okay, thank you.
1961259|CMP|Okay, I'm ready to copy the TEI.
1961338|CMP|(humming)
1961404|CMP|Got it all dirty. (laughing)
1961430|CMP|Houston, America, I'm ready to copy the TEI pad.
1961433|CC|Okay, America; Houston. I'm ready to read the TEI pad if you're ready. It's an SPS/G&N, which is a surprise, I'm sure. And, it says: 36541; plus 0.60 plus 0.81; 216:45:48.23; plus 2754.5, minus 0146.9, minus 0009.0; 179, 103, 359. The rest of the pad is N/A. GDC align stars are Sirius and Rigel. I guess they picked some bright ones for you for a change. We have alignments of 136 - -
1961538|CMP|Hey, they're good ones.
1961542|CC|- - 160, and 034. Ullage is four jet, 12 seconds. And we're using lift-off REFSMMAT. Over.
1961607|CMP|Okay, TEI - I've forgotten what rev it was.
1961611|CC|65.
1961611|CMP|SPS/G&N, 36541 - 55, okay.
1961616|CC|65, 65.
1961622|CMP|Oh, 65 it is. Okay, now on 47, the weight - 36541; plus 0.60, plus 0.81, 216:45:48.23; plus 2754.5, minus 0146.9, minus 000.0, 179, 103, 359. Sirius and Rigel, 136, 160, 034. Jet, 12 seconds for ullage. And we use lift-off REFSMMAT, which is what we have right now.
1961705|CC|Okay, Ron, and you dropped out there at 2 momentary seconds. One, the DELTA-Vz was minus a 9.0. Ullage was four jets.
1961718|CMP|Okay, that's right. DELTA-Vz is minus 9.0 and four-jet; ullage, 12 seconds. Lift-off REFSMMAT.
1961727|CC|Okay, you had a momentary dropout when you read those two figures.
1961732|CMP|Okay,
1961812|CC|And, America; Houston. Do you fellows think you have any chance, or would have any chance next time to take a picture of that possible impact point - with the handheld Hasselblad - or something?
1961831|CMP|Uh, sure can. You bet you. I think the best way to do it is with the 250 lens on the Hasselblad.
1961841|CC|Okay, it might be something worth getting just in case we don't hit it with the pan camera later on.
1961851|CMP|Okay.
1961935|CC|Okay, Ronald. The computer is yours and you can turn the LUNAR SOUNDER RADAR switch OFF. Leave the RECORDER switch ON.
1961946|CMP|Okay. The RECORDER'S staying ON and we'll turn the - RADAR, OFF?
1961956|CC|Roger. RADAR, OFF - RECORDER, ON and the computer is yours.
1962003|CMP|Okay, RADAR's going OFF and the RECORDER is still ON. And - we have lock.
1962024|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 196 hours 25 minutes. The tracking stations at Carnarvon, Honeysuckle, Hawaii and Goldstone recorded the Greenwich Mean Time at LM Loss of Signal as 6 hours 50 minutes 20 seconds.
1962105|CMP|Yes, shaved there one time. I've been trying to - haven't shaved today; I'm going to do it later on.
1962220|CMP|How about getting the recorder going there?
1962223|CDR|What?
1962224|CMP|How about turning the recorder on? - Huh? it's right in here.
1962250|CMP|Yes. It's time to eat. Yes.
1962345|CMP|I don't care.
1962517|CMP|Okay, WASTE to PURGE LINE HEATERS. They're ON. Then VENT.
1962745|CC|America, Houston. Ron? Over.
1962750|CMP|Roger; go ahead.
1962752|CC|Okay, one, while I'm talking to you how about flipping up and turning H2 TANK 3 FAN, OFF?
1962803|CMP|Okay, TANK 3 is OFF.
1962805|CC|Okay, and then, how about you three guys giving us - giving some consideration the next 2 or 3 minutes to the following proposal? One, we totally aborted that lunar sounder pass because: One, we couldn't get the HF antenna out; and, two, because the temperature in the film cassette was too low. Those things are both taken care of now, And they're talking down here about essentially starting over at 197 hours, which will be the top of the next page, and pretending that that's 195 hours and running through that 195-hour page, beginning at 197 hours. The only problem with that, of course, is that it runs into your eat period and destroys that, which essentially means that you're going to get to bed 1 hour later. And I guess what we're saying is, if you're going to get to bed 1 hour later anyway, we might go ahead and ask you to do it, if you're agreeable. If you're clean-uping - cleaning-up companions there have progressed far enough that you think you're going to get to bed on time and don't want to do it, then that's another story. So, how about chewing it over there and letting us know?
1962917|CMP|Okay, let me talk to the guys here for a minute, but I think we'll probably do it. Stand by.
1962955|CMP|Hey, Houston; America. Let's press on and pretend like I'm eating between when I'm turning the LUNAR SOUNDER, ON, and OFF - Okay? In other words, let's get the lunar sounder pass.
1963015|CC|Okay, well, you're saying, well - well, we don't want you to have to do that in the middle of your eat period and destroy ... that, Ron. That's another concern we had here.
1963026|CMP|Don't worry about that. I - I can throw those switches on and I think the other guys can mix the food and I can eat it at the same time. No problem.
1963039|CC|Okay, we've got that recorded on tape there, Ron. Okay, what we're going to do is essentially - -
1963045|CMP|Okay (laughter).
1963046|CC|- - essentially start at the 195-hour page and we'll just mechanically add 2 hours to everything on that page and run through it as - on the page. Okay? The change that we originally had in the Flight Plan, which I read - I don't know whether it was to you or to - Jack, which moved the group from 196:20 over to 196:30 - will still move over to 196:30. So, that will stay as is. And, again, that will be, of course, at 198:30, then. Do you understand what I'm saying there? Over.
1963416|CMP|Yes, I think what you're saying is, we'll just do the Flight Plan like you - like we're starting at 195.
1963416|CC|Roger - -
1963416|CMP|- - like we'll be 2 hours later on the mission timer.
1963416|CC|Roger; you might call it miniclock update.
1963416|CMP|Okay. Sounds good. Lunar sounder operating time will be 197:31:38 then, right?
1963416|CC|That's affirmative.
1963902|CC|Okay, Ron, and two comments on that. Let me make a couple of other amendments to that. One, the lunar sounder operate time, instead of being 31:38 will be 32:51. At that 195 - top of the right-hand column on 195 there - be 195:32:51. Over.
1963902|CMP|And, Houston. These waste water dump and fuel cell purges - that doesn't foul up the lunar sounder, as I recall. I don't think, does it?
1963902|CC|Oh, we can go ahead and do those in parallel, right
1963902|CMP|Okay, good. That's what I thought.
1963902|CC|And, Ron, one other - Did you catch my one - my 32:51 update, there on that start time?
1963902|CMP|Did you say cancel it? I'm sorry.
1963902|CC|No, do you copy. I gave you 195:32:51 as the start time, instead of 31:38. Did you copy that?
1963902|CMP|Yes, I copied, I'm sorry. Used to working in VOX all the time and I forget to push the button.
1963902|CC|Okay, and the other thing we'd like to keep you aware of, if you hadn't noticed it, and that is that this thing, of course, Ron, is originally ... to a 196:30 plus, which means that you're going to be running 198:30 plus, which kind of looks like you're going to be eating at least a half an hour into your sleep period, at the very least. Over.
1963902|CMP|Yes, we understand that.
1964238|CC|Okay, Ron. We'd like to have Hg TANK 2 FAN, OFF, now please.
1964249|CMP|H2 TANK 2 is going OFF.
1973149|CC|Hello, America. This is Houston. One minute to LUNAR SOUNDER, OPERATE -
1973153|CC|MARK.
1973153|CDR|Okay, 1 minute to LUNAR SOUNDER, OPERATE.
1973200|CDR|MARK. This is your friendly commander, clean and happier5 back up.
1973200|CC|Roger, Geno. We're glad to hear you're clean again.
1973200|CDR|Well, I'm not really clean but it's a major step in the right direction.
1973225|CC|30 seconds.
1973225|CDR|Okay , 30 seconds.
1973225|CC|Okay, and -
1973248|CC|MARK on LUNAR SOUNDER, OPERATE, now.
1973248|CDR|Okay, ...
1973248|CC|And, America, a question here. Did you get an isS alarm on the back side just a few minutes ago?
1973248|CDR|No, sir.
1973248|CC|Okay. We lucked out. We'd - Since we'd had the jet monitor program operating and it hadn't been killed, which had originally been planned to come after the lunar sounder, there was a possibility that we'd get an alarm but looks like we don't have it. Good enough.
1973248|CMP|A'hat was going to cause that to come on?
1973248|CC|The possibility, Ron, was when you were reloading NOUN 79j getting a smaller dead band - it depends upon where the vehicle was at that time within the old dead band, EMP 523 might have suddenly found you outside the dead band and been unhappy.
1973248|CMP|Okay, I'm with you. Thank you.
1973248|CC|Okay, looks like we lucked out though.
1973248|CDR|Say, Bob. do you know - -
1973248|CC|Go.
1973248|CDR|Do you know any more about the demise of Challenger?
1973248|CC|We know that it was within 15 kilometers of where it was supposed to be, Gene. We could not get a visual on it. It was quite obvious that the geophone saw it and all that - there's no question about that, it's just that, as it turned out at the last minute it was pretty hare, to pick out where exactly it was going to be in order to have the TV camera there.
1973248|CDR|But everything appeared to function properly, huh, the ALSEP and you - you're pretty happy with it?
1973248|CC|Roger. Everything except the TV End, of course, that's just an extra goodie.
1973546|CC|And, America, if you guys are interested in trying to take a couple of 250-millimeter shots of that tonight, we've got a little camera pad here for it we can pass up - if you're interested.
1973546|CMP|Hey, you bet I'll take it - I want to try it.
1973546|CC|Okay, let me know when you get a piece of paper there, Ron.
1973546|CMP|Okay, go ahead.
1973546|CC|Okay, it's a LM impact TCA and it's time is 197:56:35 and the camera data is CX5, EL, 250, CEX, f/5.6, 1/125, infinity. Ana magazine Kappa Kappa or Kilo Kilo, and you can use up to 10 frames on it. Over.
1973546|CMP|Okay. I think I put Kappa Kappa back, I've got Oscar Oscar on there. How about it if I use that, okay?
1973546|CC|Okay, that's fine, Ron, And, we'd like to get tanks 2 and 3 FANs back OK.
1973726|CMP|2 and 3 are ON.
1973726|CC|Okay.
1973726|CDR|Hey, Bob. A quick summary on that rendezvous as far as LM performance was concerned. Handling characteristics were outstanding and pretty much the same as they have always been on LMs in the past. The APS burn - burn went nominal; the residuals on that one were actually quite big, about 744, that's feet per second - and we nulled those out and after that the midcourses were max of 1.3) then a max of 1.6 on the second one. But, after the TPI, we were coming up - up the pike right - over - right - all the way in the line-of-sight rates - actually both out of plane as well as in plane were - were zero - basically zero for out of plane and, as predicted, on a nominal curve for in plane. And it really ended up to be pretty much a storybook rendezvous.
1973726|CC|Okay. You want to give me that TPI again or did you already pass that down to ground? I didn't copy the residuals there?
1973726|CDR|No, I didn't tell them that. And we didn't get a chance to copy them down because I wanted to get them ail down on tape. It surprised me after the APS burn because they were relatively large. They were 7 feet-per-second in X, 4 in Y, and 4 in Z. And that was, I guess, just short of a 4-second burn somewhere around 4 seconds.
1973726|CC|Okay , copy that.
1973726|CDR|And one ether little thing, we put, I think, two marks, three marks - two or three marks in the AGS - manual ciarks s after the last midcourse, as we'd been doing in the simulator - three marks, and Jack tells me that the range rate ca^e right up to - right up to the actual radar-range rate -right up to 100 feet or so.
1973726|CC|Okay j copy that,
1974217|CDR|Bob, we're all just eating away here, anything interesting in the world news that's worth commenting on?
1974217|CC|Okay; stand by. Let me find out. Did you guys get any news this morning?
1974217|CDR|No, sir; we were busy otherwise.
1974217|CMP|Yes, I did.
1974217|CC|Okay, well, stand by and let me get hold of the people and see if we can get some news for you.
1974217|CC|Okay, Gene, we're working on that, it may take us a while to get it. And - but we ought to have it for you before the end of the pass. From my own experience in talking around here, although none of us hung around much to read that stuff today, we don't think anything much did happen in the world today. There is a report that something happened in outer space, and the moon vehicle, we believe, had a lift-off this afternoon, a rendezvous, we'll try and see if we can track down any further news of that. Over.
1974217|CDR|Okay, we're pretty much up on that one. Just wondering, you know, Mr. Truman's been pretty sick and so forth, wondered about some of those things, but no big deal, we can - we can wait.
1974217|CC|Okay, we'll get with you shortly.
1974607|CC|And, America, did you fellows do ycur hydrogen purge on the back side?
1974607|CMP|That's affirm. Hydrogen purge, an O2 purge, and, would you believe we forgot to turn the purge line HEATER, OFF? ^
1974621|CMP|OFF, now. Thank you (laughter), ... EECOM there.
1974621|CC|Old EECOM was watching the currents there. He had you pinned down.
1974621|CMP|(Laughter) Good.
1974621|CC|Okay3 and, America, I presume you guys are sitting there looking at page 195. is that affirm? So I won't bother to tell you all - you all these other things that are going on on that page, presuming that you're not looking at page 197*
1974621|CMP|Yes, we're on page 195, yes.
1974621|CC|Okay, good enough.
1974621|CMP|Really it's the hour 195 5 you know.
1974910|CC|OMNI Bravo, please, America.
1974922|CMP|Okay, you have it.
1975844|CMP|Houston, this is America. That was frame 145 to 150 on magazine Oscar Oscar.
1975844|CC|Okay. Copy 145 to 150 on Oscar Oscar. Ana if you guys are starting to sort out film mags for the next day, which is called out about 198 hours, it'll be magazine Kilo Kilo instead of November November in that. So it'll be Kilo, Quebec, and Romeo for tomorrow.
1975844|CMP|Okay; Kilo, Quebec3 and Romeo.
1980733|LMP|Houston, 17.
1980733|CC|Go ahead.
1980733|LMP|A little historical note. Passing over the Hadley Apennines sites from Apollo 15 we notice that at their landing point, there's the same slightly or distinctly brighter albedo area as there is at Taurus-Littrow site.
1980733|CC|You mean down on the plains of Taurus-Littrow, like where the LM landed? Or do you mean where you think the 114 impact was?
1980733|LMP|That's affirm. It - in spite of the - no, no, no, where the LM landed. In spite of the - As we walked along the surface, and this was true at Hadley also, you stirred up a darker zone, albedo-wise. When you look at it from orbit, the area around where the LM landed - it's a distinct bright spot on the surface of a - of a fairly uniform gray albedo plain. And both sites look just alike.
1980733|CC|Okay, we copy that.
1980733|LMP|In that regard, anyway.
1980733|CC|We copy that.
1980733|CC|And, America, you might be interested to know that the latest SPAN status report still lists all the LM ECS parameters as normal.
1980733|LMP|Beautiful. SPAN'S up to their old tricks again, I see.
1980733|CC|I guess it depends upon how you define normal.
1980733|LMP|Somebody must have spilled coffee on their console.
1981010|CDR|Listen, Bob, the way - the way it was performing, I wouldn't doubt it.
1982115|CC|America, this is Houston. Over.
1982115|CMP|Go ahead.
1982115|CC|Okay, okay; I'm keeping track of you guys here or, the lunar sounder offtimes. It'll be just slightly less than 198:30, and I'll give you some hacks on that as we get down to it. And we're ready to go to Kg TANKS 1 and 2 to OFF, and TAFK 3 to AUTO.
1982203|LMP|Okay, Bob, that's got it. 1 and 2, OFF, and 3, AUTO.
1982203|CC|Okay, and you can delete the - When you get to your presleep checklist, you can then delete the cryo stirring.
1982203|LMP|Okay.
1982203|CDR|And Bob, what time is AOS?
1982203|CC|Stand by. You want AOS or LOS? LOS, stand by.
1982203|CDR|Yes, LOS.
1982203|CC|We have LOS at 198:45:37- About a little over 22 minutes from now.
1982203|CDR|Thank you, Bob.
1982656|CC|Okay; 2 minutes to LUNAR SOUNDER, STANDBY.
1982656|CDR|Roger. Two minutes to LUNAR SOUNDER, STANDBY.
1982743|CC|Okay; 1 minute mark at 28:43-
1982743|CDR|Roger 28:43-
1982833|CC|10 seconds.
1982843|CC|MARK; STANDBY.
1982850|CDR|It's STANDBY.
1983033|CMP|Okay, Houston; America. All those things in the little box are done.
1983033|CC|Okay, we copy. You're down as far UV, ON. Now we'd like to have IR COVER, OPEN; and UV COVER, OPEN, also.
1983033|CMP|Okay. Stand by. Did you want 2-1/2-degree dead band for the night?
1983033|CC|Roger. I was just going to say we can also go to VERB 22 for the 2-1/2 degree dead band.
1983220|CC|Okay, and, America, another thing down here 196:47 there are the two comm callouts, the DSEA motion and setting the HIGH GAIN to MANUAL before LOS, and we'll want to catch those before you go around the back side. And ... - yes, as you around at LOS, and after that we're then ready for you guys to skip to 198 and the presleep sys -presleep checklist.
1983220|CMP|Okay, we can do that.
1983220|CC|Okay; and, America, if you have time, I have a few news items to read up to you here.
1983220|CMP|Go ahead, Bob.
1983330|CC|Okay. Dateline Washington, the United States today threw its support behind the Christmas Peace package proposed by South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu, who accused North Vietnam of using high-pressure tactics in an attempt to impose an incomplete peace settlement. American representatives at the Paris peace talks, told the Communists it was futile for them to continue clamoring for the signature of the cease-fire agreement drafted in October by Kissinger and Le Duc Tho. In Kansas City, the condition of former President Harry S. Truman weakened to, quote "very serious" Thursday. His doctor says vital signs are stable, but former President Truman was unable to speak; his lungs were filling with fluids still, and his kidneys have been impaired. In Mexico City, the International Federation of Airline Pilots, meeting in Mexico City this week, has promised a worldwide stoppage of all transportation industries if the governments do not take action to stop hijackings. In New York, the United States won an apparent victory in the United Nations when the General Assembly voted an approval of a cut in U.S. contributions to the world organization. Vote was 81 to 27, and reduces the U.S. budget assessment from 31*5 percent to 25 percent, starting in 1974. Here at home in Houston, the city council voted to locate the new proposed sports arena in the Greenway Plaza. The vote, however, stipulates that the Mayor find a way to finance it without using city tax funds. Council indicated that if the Mayor can't do this, the city will abandon plans for the 10-million-dollar, 18-thousand-seat facility. On the lighter side, in Jersey City, only one of 51 - that is one of 51 women who took physical exams for the police department, passed. Police Director Frederick Stevens said 24 of the women were too short, seven were underweight, and four did not have eyesight that could be corrected. In sports, the Alberta Oilers, that's Alberta and not Houston Oilers, these are the hockey ones, skated past the Houston Aeros for a 3-to-2 victory here in Houston. And the Minnesota Vikings, in the city of Minneapolis, came to terms on a lease agreement to play their games in a proposed stadium up there in the north, or I guess it's building a stadium to keep it from being too cold, instead of being too muggy like it is down here. And that's the news; as you can see, it's a slow news day and things are still moving very slowly down here.
1983627|CDR|Thank you, Bob.
1983712|CDR|Bob, we realize it's - it's tomorrow down there but this still might be appropriate.
1983720|MS|(Singing: Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday, dear Bob, happy birthday to you)
1983735|CC|Well, all I can say, it might be appropriate, but it's not very musical.
1983740|MS|(Laughter)
1983743|CC|Thank you, guys.
1983745|CDR|Epic, Bob, epic. At least you know it's from the bottom of our - hearts.
1983752|CMP|(Laughter).
1983824|CC|And just to let you guys know that I'm not easily swayed and made soft by such shows of sentiment, I want to remind the CDR and the LMP that they're going to start collecting their urine from now on, and you shouldn't have been dumping it since 197:00.
1983845|CDR|Okay, we're in the process of changing over.
1983850|CC|Okay, and COVERs are OPEN on the UV and the IR, so we won't be dumping it anyway right now, tonight, right?
1983859|CDR|That's right.
1983903|CC|And, Jack, you're going to be on the biomed tonight?
1983911|LMP|Whose side are you on? Of course, I am. Bob, I'm hooking up right now. I sort of rested my - my own personal sensors and I'm putting the mechanical ones on - electrical ones, I guess.
1983943|CC|Oh good. I tell you what. If you wait 6 minutes until after LOS to finish that, you'll leave the Surgeon in suspense until you come around on AOS. That'll help keep him awake.
1983959|LMP|Okay, I'll see what I can do one way or the other.
1984016|LMP|Not according to Flight Plan.
1984029|CDR|Hey, Bob.
1984031|CC|Go ahead.
1984035|CDR|Would you say what you said a little while ago a about the waste - not waste dumps, but urine dumps?
1984042|CC|Okay, as per the checklist, it says at 19 - 197 hours, "CDR and LMP collect urine in UTSs until 208 hours," so that's until tomorrow morning. And I was just reminding you that we don't want to be hosing it overboard right now because the UV and IR COVERs are OPEN, and we presumed that, since you'd already done the waste water and the H2 purge on the back side, that - that sufficient time has passed to open them. And I guess that we sort of presumed that you weren't in the mode of dumping urine overboard.
1984116|LMP|Okay, that's fine. I was thinking of the BUSS collection then - that's fine.
1984220|CC|Okay, and, America, once you fellows finish your presleep checklist, you're GO for sleep. You're GO for LOS and we won't be saying anything to you when you come around the front side next time around, in case you've nodded off. Call us if you want to and we'll just let it be as is. We're finished with you for the night.
1984248|CDR|Okay, thank you, Robert. We're hastening to finish the checklist and get to sleep, and unless we have some problems or questions, we won't talk to you until tomorrow.
1984257|CC|Okay, talk to you tomorrow night.
1984300|LMP|Say, Bob, - Bob, on the biomed and LMP, if it doesn't show up to my normal standards, it's because maybe the sensors have come off. I'm - I've put a little of the bacterial salve on them and they probably won't stick too well. But I'll do the best I can.
1984319|CC|Okay.
1984325|LMP|Preventive medicine, Bob, not curative.
1984331|CC|Okay, that'll make the Surgeon happy.
1984443|CDR|And before we fade out of sight, you might look at the biomed.
1984449|LMP|Whoops, I got one left.
1984500|CC|We're in LOW BIT RATE. We can't see you right now.
1984533||BEGIN LUNAR REV 57
1984536|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 198 hours 45 minutes. We've had loss of signal on the 56th revolution. As you heard from CAPCOM Bob Parker, we do not intend to put in a call to the crew on the next acquisition, nor does the crew expect to call us. We'll take the line down and come back up with hourly reports.
1995205|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 199 hours 52 minutes. America is coming up over the landing site now on its 57th revolution. The crew began rest period almost an hour ago. We have not talked to them on this revolution. Rest period due to last 8 hours with wakeup at 207 hours elapsed time. All systems continuing to function well on the America. At 199 hours 52 minutes this is Mission Control Houston.
2005302|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 200 hours 53 minutes. America behind the Moon now. We'll next acquire in about 35 minutes on the 58th revolution. The crew is in a rest period and at loss of signal on this revolution all systems were performing well. At 200 hours 53 minutes, this is Mission Control Houston.
2015214|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 201 hours 52 minutes. Apollo 17, in its 58th lunar revolution, at this time is over the Taurus-Littrow landing site. We are monitoring systems via telemetry. All going well aboard the spacecraft. Crew has 5 hours 37 minutes remaining in this rest period. America's current orbit 65 by 62.5 nautical miles. At 201 hours 52 minutes this is Mission Control Houston.
2025418|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 202 hours 54 minutes. Apollo 17 is behind the moon on it's 58th revolution. All continuing to go well aboard spacecraft America. Spacecraft systems performing normally. The crew in a rest period. Wake up scheduled 4 hours 35 minutes from this time. Flight director, Pete Frank, and the orange team of flight controllers now handing over Mission Control duties to the gold team, which will be led today by flight director Neil Hutchinson. There will be no change of shift news conference. Early in this shift the lunar module, Challenger, was deorbited ontime and impacted the moon. Preliminary information indicates that the impact did occur within 15 Kilometers of the expected location. However, we were not able to see the impact on television from the rover which was up at that time. Impact data is still being refined and more detailed information should be available on that later today. At 202 hours 56 minutes this is Mission Control, Houston.
2034804|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 203 hours 48 minutes. Revolution number 59 for Apollo 17 spacecraft, now in lunar orbit with some 3 hours and 41 minutes remaining until the three crewmen are awakened, for a rather full day of lunar orbit science activities. The spacecraft, currently, is in a almost circular lunar orbit: 62.6 nautical at the pericyntion by 65.1 nautical miles apocynthion. Orbital velocity 5344 feet per second, no apparent systems problems being monitored on the ground aboard the America at this time, and the crew sound asleep according to the surgeon, and at 203:49, this is Apollo Control.
2050712|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 205 hours 7 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Coming up on the front side pass on revolution number 60, some 18 minutes remaining until spacecraft America re-appears on the front side of the Moon. Two hours and 22 minutes remaining until the crew is awakened. America, at the present time, is in an orbit measuring 65.1 by 62.6 nautical miles. Here in the control center, the Flight Controllers are - those that aren't busy planning the days activity - are watching a playback of the rendezvous and docking sequence from the Command Module television camera which is being piped to the news room at this time on the monitors. And at 205 hours 7 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
2054705|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 205 hours 47 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The spacecraft America coming up on the old Taurus-Littrow landing site, where the descent stage of the Lunar Module, Challenger, rests as a monument to the final Mission of the Apollo Landing series, Lunar Landing series. Fifty two minutes remaining until America passes behind the Moon, nearing the end of the 60th Lunar Orbit. An hour and 41 minutes until the crew awake time. America presently, is in an orbit measuring 62.5 at low point at which point it is at the moment, at pericynthion. And 180 degrees around at the rear side of the Moon it will reach apocynthion some 3 miles higher 65 nautical, and at 205 hours 48 minutes Ground Elapsed Time in the Mission of Apollo 17, this is Apollo Control.
2064700|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 206 hours 47 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Spacecraft America, now behind the moon nearing the end of the 60th Lunar Orbit. Some 42 minutes remaining, until the first call is made to the crew on the spacecraft. Approximately 5 minutes after they come around on the front side of the Moon on revolution number 61. Currently, the orbital digital display here in the Mission Control Center shows the orbit measuring 69.2 by 71.8 which may or may not be the current orbit. If it is some-. body has done a maneuver here. Here in the control center the flight controllers are going over the changes to the flight plan for the day's activities, getting all of the different entries, new entries to the flight plan sorted out and agreed upon. Preparation for crew wakeup. On second thought, disregard that earlier orbital measurement. I suspect this display maybe, is invalid at the moment. At 206:48 up again in 35 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
2072300|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 207 hours 23 minutes Ground Elapsed Time in the mission of Apollo 17. Coming around in less than a minute on the front side pass in lunar orbit number 61 and approximately 5-1/2 minutes away from wake-up. The wake-up music during this mission has ranged from grand opera selections to a college war hymn. We'll wait and see what it will be this morning. Spacecraft America in an orbit now measuring 65.3 at apocynthion by 62.6 nautical miles at pericynthion. We'll stand by for first word of acquisition from the network controler. We've had acquisition of signal. Slightly under 4 minutes now until the scheduled wake-up call unless they are already awake. We'll bring up the air-ground 1 circuit at this time and stand by for spacecraft communicators alarm clock at 207:26, and standing by, this is Apollo Control.
2073710|CC|(Music: The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face by Roberta Flack)
2074232|CC|Good morning, America, from the Gold Team here.
2074330|CC|Good morning, America. The friendly Gold Team is standing by.
2074340|LMP|You guys have finally learned how to wake somebody up.
2074345|CC|Roger.
2074347|CMP|Good morning, Gold Team, this is the Command Module Pilot of the spaceship America, and we're ready to go to work again this morning.
2074355|CC|Okay, well, you don't have to do much for a while but eat and get squared away.
2074404|CDR|Good morning, down there. This is the Commander of the spaceship America, and I'm glad to see that the CAPCOM console is well guarded this morning.
2074412|CC|Roger; yes indeed. We've got one gate here and I'm guarding it.
2074419|CDR|I'm a little disappointed, though. The music was good, but I expected the Marine's Hymn or something like that.
2074425|CC|Oh, I wouldn't do that to you this early in the morning.
2074431|LMP|Better now and get it over with.
2074434|CC|(Laughter)
2074447|LMP|Has your - has your Flight Director changed or is it the same little fellow back there?
2074452|CC|No, we've got Neil back there and a whole new team since you went to bed.
2074500|LMP|Oh, that's right. Very good.
2074534|PAO|Wake-up music today was Roberta Flack's rendition of The Last Time Ever I Saw Your Face.
2074559|LMP|Who selected that song, Joe Allen?
2074601|CC|No, that's - that's Neil's special. You've got Neil Hutchinson to blame on that one.
2074626|CC|I must say he had a lot of accomplices on that, too, so -
2074636|LMP|Yes, Bob, I think maybe that's one of the best songs that's come out in the last 10 years, if you ask me.
2074644|CC|Roger.
2074646|LMP|But then, you didn't ask.
2074659|CMP|Hey, Houston; America.
2074701|CC|Go ahead.
2074705|CMP|I think mag QQ is all gone. Shall I use the RR?
2074714|CC|Hey, Ron, at 208 - -
2074716|CMP|... or something - -
2074717|CC|- - 05 there, we're going to delete that solar-corona pass anyway. I've got a Flight Plan update I'll give you at 208 there, and we're going to have to delete that solar-corona pass. So, forget it.
2074732|CMP|Okay.
2074914|CC|In case you guys are wondering, it looks like we finally might see the Sun down here in Houston. It is clearing off, except it's extremely cold. The temperature must be hovering right in the low 40's, or maybe even the high 30's, or even lower.
2074935|LMP|Well, my goodness. I should have been watching the weather for you, Bob. We'll come and warm things up for you before long.
2074944|CC|Roger.
2080123|CC|America, Houston. We've got the Flight Plan update and a pan camera photo pad for the Flight Plan.
2080151|CMP|Okay, Houston. Stand by 1, here I've got my hands full of - ... PRD thing.
2080203|CC|Okay, the only thing we want to tell you is don't do the solar corona, and we've already told you that. We'll get back with you later on that. If you want, I'll read you the morning news.
2080214|CMP|Hey, okay. Go ahead.
2080216|CC|Okay, there's been a temporary halt to the peace talks in Paris, and, as we mentioned before, Henry Kissinger is in Washington and has conferred with President Nixon. A cease-fire proposal suggested by South Vietnamese government officials has been rejected by the U.S. White House News Secretary Ron Zeigler has declined to characterize the present Paris peace efforts, but say - did say there are still some obstacles to overcome. And we had another hijack attempt. A youthful Canadian, who hijacked an airliner in northern Canada was talked out of his escapade by his father. The youth had held 62 persons aboard the plane for a short while, then retained only four hostages for 10 hours. It appears that the United Mine Workers may have a new president. Maverick candidate Arnold Miller retained a strong lead over Tony Boyle in the government-supervised election. The transatlantic airfare price war that seems imminent, promises to be a real boon to the vacationer. It is now estimated that airfare may be as low as $136.00 for the transatlantic fare in some special categories. Juan Peron has ended his month-long visit to Argentina. An attempt was made to nominate him for the presidential election while he was there, but the move was declared illegal and he returned to Paraguay. A few other news highlights - the village of Rhonda, Switzerland, is threatened by a half-million-ton portion of a glacier moving down a mountain. Willie Brandt has been sworn in as Chancellor of West Germany for his second term. Former President Truman remains seriously ill. Chicago Mayor Daley has made an effort to halt further commercial development along Chicago's Lake Michigan waterfront. Comedian Bob Hope is set again for his annual tour of U.S. overseas military bases. His first Christmas show in the Far East is December 21. Now, in the local news, here, there's a good chance that Texans may soon legally put a bet down on a horse race. A state senate's studying - study committee has heard some heavy opposition to parimutuel betting in Austin, but the proposal appears to have a good chance of approval. And if you follow the Tomball police force, who quit in masses a couple of days ago - Tomball has rehired three of the officers who quit, and two more of the police who walked out are seeking to be rehired. And just a note here - there was a little beautification of Houston. Some of the thousands of billboards that line main highways around Houston will be coming down after the first of the year. All signs must be licensed by the state and a fee paid after that time. Some of the sports news: Johnny Bench, the Cincinnati Reds catcher who had a benign spot removed from a lung Monday, is recovering nicely at Christ Hospital in Cincinnati, The star baseball player will remain hospitalized for about 5 more days. Brad Van Pelt of the Michigan State University defensive star won the Maxwell Club trophy as the year's top college football player. The Washington Redskin's Larry Brown took top honors as the top professional player of the year. Southern Methodist has apparently chosen a new football coach to succeed Hayden Fry, but University officials say an announcement won't come until next week. Mark Spitz and Shane Gould, both top Olympic swimmers, were honored as top athletes in the world by European sports writers - for this past year, of course. There was no action last night in college basketball. The University of Houston is getting ready to play California tomorrow night. Joe Paterno, Penn State coach, has won the Walter Camp Football Foundation award as coach of the year. And it appears that Mike Tillamen of the Oilers may play out his option this year and this - Coach Bill Peterson says that it upsets his draft plans this coming year. And I've already updated the weather to you. I just might add a little parenthetical thought that it's really not that much in the news and all the news around here anyway has been Apollo 17 and your lift-off. We picked up the lift-off last night from the Moon and carried it live TV for about 2-1/2 minutes as you went out of sight like a star, and then, of course, live TV picked up your docking and - rendezvous and docking. A very spectacular picture, I might add, of the lunar surface as the Challenger came up to meet America. Over.
2080658|CDR|Very good news summary, Bob. Thank you. I didn't realize Tomball had five policemen.
2080705|CC|(laughter)
2080741|CC|America, Houston.
2080803|CC|America, this is Houston.
2080808|CDR|Go ahead.
2080809|CC|Hey, you can probably tell by the comm that this is Gerry. This is - the Gold Team has been handed over to the able hands of Neil. Before things go too far, I'll be around watching for the rest of the flight, of course, but before things got too far I wanted to pass my comments on to you guys that - boy, this has really been super. You guys have - between the performance of you guys and the performance of the hardware, it's been a piece of cake down here. I hope it's staying that same way up there, and we're really looking forward to finishing this thing up and getting you on back home. And my hat's off to you.
2080849|CDR|Okay, Gerry, I appreciate those words, but any performance of ours, and certainly that of the hardware, has to go all to the performance of you guys down there, because, you know, you are the guys that make it happen and we do appreciate it. And I guess this is sort of a semiretirement for you then, is that right?
2080912|CC|Well, I don't know whether to call it semiretirement it's - it's a relaxed feeling, I'll tell you that. But I'm anxious to do it again; and hope I get a chance to do something more like this.
2080926|CDR|You bet you. We're all going to keep doing it; and, listen, you couldn't have left it in a more able set of hands than Neil's down there. We'll have to celebrate your 3-day or 4-day rest period when we get back.
2080938|CC|Roger. Talk to you later.
2080942|CDR|I didn't - I didn't realize we wore you out.
2080947|CC|I will throw in one thing right quick, you know the activation descent day, that was the third one I had handled, and including all the simulations and all the three of the actual flights, I think it's the first time we can say that we really did it all right. For one reason or another, it really turned out to be a fairly easy day and I was really surprised.
2081013|CDR|Gerry, that spacecraft that we were working with was undoubtedly the best vehicle, along with America, that I've ever flown.
2081024|CC|Okay, well I'll be talking to you later.
2081030|CDR|Still ... babe.
2081032|LMP|Gerry, this is Jack. Thanks a lot, boy.
2081035|CC|You bet.
2081333|LMP|Okay, Houston; America. Would you like us to start charging battery Bravo?
2081339|CC|That's affirmed if you - if you're there, we'd like it.
2081348|LMP|I'm here.
2081410|CDR|Okay, Houston, we're going to do the pan camera; stand by.
2081417|LMP|Okay, say again, Geno.
2081424|CDR|Mode is STANDBY and Houston -
2081430|CDR|MARK. POWER.
2081433|CC|Roger.
2081438|CDR|And if you're curious V/H is HIGH ALTITUDE.
2081443|CC|Roger; copy that.
2081501|CMP|Okay, Houston; America here. I've got some medical logs and food.
2081512|CC|Okay. Stand by 1.
2081521|CC|Okay, go ahead. We're listening.
2081525|CMP|Okay, I'll start out with LMP medical log. PRD is packed down there with the suit; so, we'll have to get it later. He had 6 hours of good sleep. Took a Seconal. Fluids - he had lots of fluids - but they weren't logged.
2081601|LMP|Okay, LMP's - okay day 10, I guess, meal Charlie. Had turkey and gravy, and I need to start writing - No. I had a citrus beverage, coffee, fruit cake, meatballs, lemon pudding and lemonade. Hey, Houston, instead of a turkey and gravy that was really a beef and gravy.
2081649|CC|Okay.
2081658|CMP|Okay, we'll go over the CMP. Meal A - had bacon squares, scrambled eggs, orange juice, and coffee, vitamins; Meal B - need some light (laughter) meal B is chicken and rice soup, meatballs with sauce, butterscotch pudding, orange drink, caramel candy, apricot cereal cubes, brownies - I guess that was it. Meal Charlie, potato soup, beef and gravy, the ambrosia peaches there - about half of it - four brownies, and an orange drink.
2081810|CMP|Okay, on the medical log: PRD is 15047 and I had about 6-1/2 hours of sleep in, oh, catnaps I guess - some of them were a couple hours long. And had two sniffs of nose drops on each side prior to going to sleep and five cans of fluid.
2081858|CMP|Okay, for the Commander's menu - how did we get to day 10 - it was only day 9 yesterday wasn't it?
2081922|CC|Ron, excuse us. Would you have somebody turn the PAN CAMERA POWER to OFF, please?
2081940|CDR|MARK it. It's off.
2081942|CC|Roger; we'd like the IR COVER, CLOSED, and the UV COVER, CLOSED, at this time.
2081954|CDR|Okay. I'll improve, Ron.
2082001|CMP|Well, it takes a little training.
2082004|CDR|Takes a little training once you get back from the lunar surface.
2082009|CMP|Okay, Houston, UV COVER is CLOSED and gray. IR COVER is CLOSED and gray.
2082030|CMP|Okay. Ready for the Commander's menu, day 9 meal Charlie?
2082059|CMP|Houston, America. Are you all set to copy?
2082111|CC|Yes. We're ready to copy, Ron.
2082112|CMP|Hello, Houston. How do you read America?
2082113|CC|Read you loud and clear. We're ready to copy.
2082117|CMP|Okay, here we go. For the Commander's day 9 meal Charlie - meatballs, butterscotch pudding, beef and gravy, orange-pineapple juice, citrus juice, chicken stew, apricots, and gingerbread.
2082154|CMP|Okay, his medical log: He had 7 hours of very good sleep, no medication, and drank lots of fluids but nothing was logged on that part of it, and his PRD is also at his suit - down at the bottom of the suit bag so we ought to get it out here, shortly.
2082215|CC|Roger; copy.
2082230|LMP|Bob, in lieu of the solar corona photography, I watched - Gene and I both watched it set, and there are two bands which I still can see now - a zodiacal light, I guess, going out symmetrically on either side of the plane in the ecliptic and they make an angle between themselves of about, let's say, 70 to 80 degrees. I can still - knowing they're there - I can still pick up the bands, streamers, I guess would be a better word. And last night when I watched one set, there was a strong linear streamer going out - oh, maybe 3 or 4 or 5 diameters - I'll have to get my directions straight. Well, I'll figure out which side of the ecliptic it was. That was not nearly so strong when I looked this time - now partly that may be dark adaptation, I don't know, but I'll try to keep track of that one. But these two streamers today are about an equal strength and they're still visible as zodiacal light.
2082355|CC|Okay, Jack, we'd - quick break, we'd like the HIGH GAIN to AUTO and we'd like to get on with this Flight Plan update, please.
2082410|LMP|Okay, you've got AUTO.
2082412|CC|Okay, and this is a real-time Flight Plan change. This real time right here, and right now if you'll go MAPPING CAMERA COVER, OPEN, and MAPPING CAMERA, EXTEND, and give us a mark, we'll time the extend time on it, please.
2082428|CDR|Okay, Bob, the MAPPING CAMERA COVER - Ready?
2082440|CC|Jack, will you go back to REACQ on the HIGH GAIN?
2082449|LMP|Okay, we're in REACQ. ...
2082501|CDR|... Oh, okay.
2082507|CDR|No-no - okay, Bob. MAPPING CAMERA is going OPEN.
2082512|CDR|MARK. And it's gray. And you want to extend the mapping camera, huh?
2082524|CC|AUTO on the HIGH GAIN, first of all.
2082527|LMP|Okay, that's what they said - they wanted. Okay, going to AUTO again.
2082541|CC|Okay - -
2082542|CDR|Houston, America. You say you're going to extend the mapping camera, now?
2082546|CC|That's affirmative, we're extending it early because we want to time it, and extend it now, please, and give us a mark when you start it.
2082555|CDR|Okay.
2082556|CDR|MARK it.
2082600|CC|Okay, and might as well finish up the Flight Plan updates if you don't mind. The next one is at 209:01.
2082619|LMP|Okay, go ahead; 209:01.
2082622|CC|You're going to delete the "MAPPING CAMERA/LASER ALTIMETER COVER, OPEN," and "MAPPING CAMERA EXTEND," at that position, because you've just done it. Just scratch them out.
2082641|LMP|Okay, Bob. I got that.
2082643|CC|Okay, and at 209:03, add - after "PAN CAMERA POWER" - add "V/H OVERRIDE, HIGH ALTITUDE."
2082702|LMP|Okay, I got that: V/H high alt at 209:03.
2082708|CC|That's affirmative, and - -
2082710|CMP|Hey, Houston; America.
2082711|CC|Go ahead, Ron.
2082714|CMP|Okay, let me interrupt here a minute, Bob. Can we go ahead and dump with the mapping camera extended?
2082723|CC|That's affirmative, Ron.
2082727|CMP|Okay. Mighty fine. Thank you.
2082730|CC|Okay, we'll just show a full extend at 209:40, Jack, in the Flight Plan where it says, "Lift-off time update" is not required. At 209:40, we'll not do a lift-off time update.
2082752|LMP|209:40. You're not going to do a lift-off time update, huh?
2082759|CC|That's affirmative. And I've got a pan camera pad while you're on that page. The pan camera pad which is opposite 209:15 - 209:15.
2082819|LMP|209:15. Pan camera photo pad. Go ahead.
2082825|CC|Okay, T-start, 209:14:44; T-stop, 209:27:36, and that covers all of it. We can settle back to the Flight Plan, now.
2082851|LMP|Okay, we - I will do that.
2082854|CC|Okay, sir, and if you'll give us ACCEPT, we've got a state vector at this time for you.
2082904|LMP|Okay, you have it.
2082933|CC|And, Ron, you may be interested, we had a nominal extend on the mapper.
2082941|CMP|(Laughter) Hey, great. I guess once - once the door stays out of the way, it'll come out all right, huh?
2082948|CC|Roger.
2083050|CC|America, Houston.
2083056|CMP|Go ahead.
2083057|CC|Okay, Ron. Just for - first of all - the computer is yours, you can go back to BLOCK. Just for your information, at the beginning of the next rev, we're going to have a Flight Plan update. Or actually, we'll have small - a pan camera pad at the beginning of the rev and then into the rev after the orbital science visuals, we'll have a Flight Plan update. What we're going to be doing is we're going to be doing an extra ultraviolet-scan program and we're going to do some antenna calibration on the HF - lunar sounder antenna so we get quite a lengthy Flight Plan update and, after that, it'll just be flying the Flight Plan. The thing with the lunar sounder is that we're getting a lot of noise from Earth that we don't see on the back side of the Moon in the HF and we'd like to calibrate this out.
2083156|LMP|Okay, you want to give us those updates now or are you going to ... -
2083202|CC|Negative; we'll wait until next rev, they're not that extensive - we just have a number of them. Just want you to be aware that they'll be coming up. They will not interrupt your orbital-science visual targets there at Mare Smythii or at the landing-site visual.
2083220|LMP|Okay.
2083739|CC|America, Houston. You're about 2 minutes from LOS here. We've got two items - the America is looking great and as you go around the horn there's no problems open on it. If you do - We would like the LMP - Jack, if you'd push on your EKG sensors a little bit - we're - the data isn't too good - the EKG sensors. And on your H2 tank configuration, Ron, we'd like you to take H2 TANK 3 FANS to OFF and H2 TANK 2 FANS to ON.
2083815|CMP|Okay. TANK 3 is OFF. Number 2 is ON.
2083821|CC|Roger.
2083823|LMP|Okay, Bob. First - first break I have I'll change - have to change those sensors. I - I needed to put that salve on and I guess that's probably the same problem as on the way out.
2083838|CC|Roger. Don't change them, Jack. The CMP is due to come on before too long so just press on them and see if we can improve the data a little bit but don't change them out. And you're looking great, and we'll pick you up again at 209:23.
2083855|LMP|Maybe that ratty data is me.
2083859|CC|No, no, it's not that way.
2083934||BEGIN LUNAR REV 62
2083942|PAO|And we've had loss of signal as the spacecraft, America, passed behind the moon nearing the end of the 61st lunar orbit. Some 48 minutes until the spacecraft comes around again on revolution 62. During that frontside pass the crew was wakened rather pleasantly by a recording uplink to them by Roberta Flack of The Last Time Ever I Saw Your Face. And after they had sufficiently wakened the Flight Plan updates for the days activity were read up to the crew by spacecraft communicator, Bob Overmeyer. Current orbit, 65 nautical miles by 62.5 pericynthion. And at 208.40 this is Apollo Control.
2092250|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 209 hours 22 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 17 Spacecraft America coasting around at this time on the start of lunar orbit number 62, about 40 seconds away from acquisition by the ground station antennas. Still in a 62 by 65 nautical mile orbit. Waiting confirmation as the spacecraft comes around the corner. And we have, indeed, picked up the downlink voice and data signal at the tracking station. We have had acquisition. Let's stand by for the initial conversations.
2092649|LMP|Okay, we've got you OMNI D. Somehow we got off attitude here.
2092655|CC|Okay, Ron, understand you're on OMNI D. You're coming up on 30 seconds away from PAN CAMERA T-stop time, and I have another pan camera pad I'd like to give you before we get into the orb science visuals.
2092713|CMP|Okay. Gene will get the pad. ... 27 36 - 27 36, Jack.
2092727|CDR|Go ahead on the pad.
2092729|CC|Okay, the pan camera photo pad is at 209:30 - 209:45 are you read for that one?
2092742|CDR|Standby - PAN CAMERA to STANDBY. Okay, pan camera is STANDBY.
2092753|CC|Roger, we got it.
2092802|CC|Okay, the PAN CAMERA photo pad T-start time: 209:49:04, T-stop time: 209:51:01. Over.
2092824|CDR|Okay I've got T-start of 49:04 and T-stop 51:01.
2092829|CC|Roger, and we'll hold off on the other pads until after your visuals, here.
2092840|CDR|I don't have much to do anyway, Bob. Why don't you go ahead.
2092848|CC|Rog, if you want, we're standing by to copy the visuals.
2092854|CDR|Okay. That's right ... Okay, we're coming across Mare Smythii. One of the - first things I'm concentrating on is the - slope of the - we're out of comm, it looks like. Got some high gain angles?
2092917|CC|Roger, trying to get one.
2092926|CMP|Okay.
2092928|CDR|Okay. Okay.
2092938|CC|Ron, if you'll do a standard REACQ for the HIGH GAIN pitch minus 10, yaw 25, we'd appreciate it.
2092953|CC|Sounds great.
2093005|CMP|How do you read, Bob.
2093006|CC|Loud and clear.
2093008|CMP|Okay, Houston, how do you hear? Okay.
2093023|CC|We'd like REACQ on the HIGH GAIN until we call AUTO, please.
2093029|CMP|Reacq in there. Okay.
2093047|CC|Ron, we're standing by.
2093049|CMP|Okay, Houston on the - the craters to the north of the Wright Brothers. The slope of the walls is steep - probably 45 degrees on the inside - it's a gradual slope on the outside slipping away from the crater. There is no apparent albedo differences in the ejecta or patterned annulus around the crater itself and we're looking specifically at the one to the northwest of the Wright Brothers, now. There is a definite mare flow that is unindated [sic], and it's a different color and, you know, that you have a light albedo to it now, it's kind of a grayish tan. It's a light grayish tan material that has flowed - and I can't tell - it almost looks like it's flowed down to the crater. There is an impact crater right in the breach of the crater - which has nothing to do with the flow itself. The material in the - I'm almost out of sight of it already. I was going to say the material in the inner crater in these boulder ring structures down there - the material all the way in the center of it is comparable to the hummocky, bumpy looking type stuff that is not really the mare - not the smooth mare of Smythii - but the other part of the mare of Smythii.
2093244|CC|Are there any differences in the craters, Ron?
2093256|CMP|Yes, some of the craters, though, you can't see the boulder-ring structures on it. And some of them that are definitely impact craters, you know, that have the ejecta rings around them. I've got to study them a little bit more. This is really the first chance I've had to look at Smythii, on this pass, but I want to take a look at him a little bit more. Some of the boulder-ring basins there - the walls are not delta shaped at all. The one to the north and let's see, as you look to the Wright Brothers there's one directly north, and then the next one, and then the next one. The one directly north we'll say is 12 o'clock; the other one is 1 o'clock; and then a 2 o'clock crater. The 1 o'clock crater looks to me there is a high lava mark around the outer basin, the outer ring of the crater, itself. The one at 12 o'clock is the one I was talking about, has the breach on it with the later impact - the small impact crater on it. And without the binocs I couldn't tell flow direction, whether they were flowing into the boulder-ring basin from that mare patch on the outside or vice versa, so I'm going to try to check that out the next time around.
2093438|CC|Okay, Ron, we're standing by for any comments along your ground track here and we're following you. We would like to - when you get up on the landing site, we'd like you to concentrate on Stoney and F Cra - F Crater for those textural differences we noticed the other day.
2093456|CMP|Okay. Shorty. I think - right, I called the Stoney the other day too I think but -
2093503|CC|Yes, Shorty, I'm sorry. - -
2093505|CMP|The one out on the landslide.
2093506|CC|- - And we would like you to mark - Right. Will you mark - like you to mark the breach that you see on the photo, please. Or on the map.
2093523|CMP|Okay. That's - that's the breach on the - in Mare Smythii.
2093530|CC|That's affirm, Ron.
2093543|CC|And Ron, if you'll ask Gene or Jack or somebody to get your PAN CAMERA to MONO now, please.
2093554|CMP|Okay, PAN CAMERA's going to MONO.
2093629|CMP|Okay ... I got the binocs.
2093656|CC|And Ron, we're still standing by for any calls you might want to make en route to the landing site, there.
2093703|CMP|Okay.
2093720|CMP|Well, again you can speak of test - or color differences on the thing. And the Sun angle now looking west - you get the same streaked - well, the verticle streaks that I talked about before that you see on the backside at the high Sun angle - higher Sun angles again. And that seems to show up more and more, I think, at the higher Sun angles. And these are the - what I call - radial - radial streaks down in the fresh craters that essentially start at the top of the crater rim and go down inside of them. If you take a look at these streaks, I don't - I don't see how they could be due strictly to the Sun angle on the thing, because they're all the way around the crater.
2093837|CC|Roger, did you have a particular crater in mind along the - -
2093840|CMP|Now, on the - Well, I'm trying to find the name of it right now. It doesn't make any difference which one it is. It's in all of the - all the craters, all of the valleys, and everything. It looks like the Sculptured Hills around the landing site.
2093919|CC|Roger. We understand that, Ron.
2093929|CC|Coming up on Apollonius. That area now is that correct?
2093936|CMP|Yes.
2093952|CC|Is there any significance or difference between the contact of Crisium to the Highlands or at Picard in that - or at the area where you're flying over in the Mare Tran - Fertility and, the Highlands right there in between. Is there any difference between these two contact points?
2094016|CMP|No, the Highlands look essentially the same as you - as you pass from Crisium on across to Fertility, and, again, they look so much like the Sculptured Hills, it's ridiculous, you know. It's all the high Sun - high Sun angle again. You got the streaks and the highs and there - there are masses of Highlands, though, on the border of Crisium here, though that - although they look like the Sculptured Hills, the sculpturing seems to be radially upslope and then downslope from the center of Crisium and just in small local areas of the Highlands.
2094110|CC|Roger, Roger. Do you see any radial Fra Mauro-like lineaments?
2094112|CMP|In that way, I think you can see ... the Sculptured Hills.
2094112|CC|- - Fra Mauro ...?
2094123|CMP|No, Bob. What I'm referring to is on the Highlands bordering Crisium, but - not all of them - you just see a definite radial pattern upslope and downslope. From the center of Crisium, but none of the lineaments like you're talking about like at Fra Mauro.
2094145|CC|Roger, copy.
2094147|CMP|What kind of film we got? Oh, I got the wrong film in the mag. Right - Let's see, there's Yerkes, and then on the side of the slope, come Yerkes and then there's about a 50-kilometer crater, then there's a subdued crater, and right on the western rim of Crisium - in the western edge of that subdued crater, it's almost a 70-degree slope down there, and it's a square straight slope on the thing. There doesn't seem to be any ejecta piled up in the bottom of it at all, but within the slope - and it must be 50 - about - yes, 50 kilometers long, and there's a bright impact crater on the top of the hill, top of the rim, right below that bright crater, you have the tannish brown streak that goes through the whole slide. The rest of the slope itself is the bright, light - real light, light tan, I call it. I'll find the name of that crater on the map in a minute.
2094308|CDR|I think the circumference of that crater right there ceases to be round - -
2094312|CMP|Yes.
2094312|CDR|- - it just is squared off with a linear break about oh - at least 20 percent of the circumference of the entire crater.
2094322|CC|Now, are you talking about a crater on the Mare of Crisium or are you talking about up near Proculus P in that area ... Hills?
2094328|CMP|Yes, it's right - no it's right on the mare.
2094332|CC|Okay. We got it. I think we got ... - -
2094332|CMP|A subdued crater right on the Mare of Crisium just below - below Yerkes. Jack, where's the -
2094339|LMP|...
2094342|CMP|Oh, the film? ...
2094400|CMP|Window 3 is going to - The landing site is going to be out of window 3. Let's see, about f - f/8 and 1/250.
2094430|CC|Very shortly you should be coming up on the mare prior to the landing site across Tranquillitatis and then to the landing site. Is that affirm?
2094441|CMP|Oh, yes, that's affirm, we should, I got Proculus at the window number 3 now.
2094455|CMP|Yes. Yes, the landing site really shows up - even from this distance right now. We're right over Proculus, and looking off across down through the hills there, you have that definite dark - and now the albedo or the colored texture of the thing to me is turning more of a gray than a tan-gray. In the early parts of it, I thought it was a dark grayish tan, I guess, or something like that. Now it looks to me like it's more tan - I mean more gray, I'm sorry, more gray.
2094536|CC|Are you using the binoculars on the landing site - -
2094536|CMP|It has essentially the same - Ah, not yet.
2094544|CDR|Yes, this is Gene. I've got it on and the streaked albedo change differences very definite. One is the dark mantle on the floor. One is the South and North Massifs and the other is the Sculptured Hills. And the Sculptured Hills are at a light gray albedo between the Massif and the dark mantle. This line is very evident and there's a definite break in slope that you can see between the South Massif the, I won't call it the slide, but the white mantle is out on the valley floor. And from here, Shorty stands out like a sore thumb.
2094644|CC|Okay, we're interested in all three of you on that color texture difference up at Shorty and then we'd like to have a comparison of Shorty to F-crater if it is possible.
2094655|CMP|Okay, that crater is harder than a son-of-a-buck to find. F-crater is right on Family Mountain, and there's one to the north of Family Mountain, a little ways, there's a darker crater and then there's also one to the south of it. I can't find one on Family Mountain at all. I couldn't the other day so I'm going to see if I can find it today.
2094720|CDR|Bob, to me the Sculptured Hills incorporate the albedo, both of the North Massif, or the massif, and the mantle area, and combine them to give you a generally in-between gray albedo, but the sculpturing is produced by the darker albedo that looks like the mantle, and the lighter albedo that looks like the massif.
2094747|CC|Roger. And for Ron, the F crater is just to the south of Family Mountain. It's the one that you mentioned south of Family Mountain.
2094757|LMP|Oh, okay! That's the one I saw the other day. It looks about like Shorty.
2094803|CC|Is there a cone associated with that crater?
2094803|CDR|From here Bob, they're both very dark -
2094816|CC|Is there a color associated with that crater?
2094817|CMP|Have to check that just a second.
2094820|CC|Okay, and we're about 30 seconds from the T-start time on the pan camera, please.
2094849|CMP|Can't see that far. Stand by.
2094849|CMP|There is a definite bright spot up on the side of the hill - it's almost an extension of that slide area from Shorty.
2094849|CC|Okay, you guys, we're about 10 - -
2094849|CMP|See it?
2094852|CC|- - 10 seconds from T-start time on the pan camera.
2094852|CMP|Okay, Jack's getting the T-start. Okay I still get a -
2094903|CC|MARK. T-start time.
2094903|CMP|It's on.
2094903|CC|Go ahead, Ron.
2094903|CMP|Okay. On Shorty, I still have the - that light orangish-tan-type material - it's essentially perpendicular, to the line of the slide area there in the northern semicircle of the thing. I see F-crater. Boy, I can't hold these crazy glasses still enough.
2094903|CC|Okay, let me read you some questions about F-crater, if you will. If you'll direct your attention to F-crater. We'd like to know the shape of the crater profile, the rim crest, and probable or possible breaching, the smoothness and distribution of rim deposits, and the superposition-relationship with Family Mountain or Family Hill.
2094903|CMP|Okay. Get all of those. It is a - by golly, there is a raised rim to it. It's light color down inside the crater, though. And I can't hold the glasses close enough to see if it's breached or not.
2095035|CDR|Bob, I can't see it any more but let me add to it what I can remember real quick. The inside is white.
2095035|CMP|Yes.
2095035|CDR|The outside is rimmed with a - it's as if the rim itself, was just dark, very dark. There's some white to the south about a crater diameter, sort of a - small distribution radially to the south, and then there is a - sort of a, what I would call, a free-patterned dark-like ray about 2 crater diameters, maybe 3 crater diameters, to the south just slightly to the west of this light area I was talking about, but to the south, another definite one to the west and another definite one to the north, but none to the east.
2095035|CC|You just past pan camera T-stop time, guys. Jack, PAN CAMERA to STANDBY, please. Go on Gene, sorry to interrupt.
2095035|CMP|He's got it.
2095035|CC|Go ahead, go ahead with your description. We're listening.
2095035|CMP|I'm going to draw a picture, here, while I'm thinking of it.
2095035|CC|Okay, good show. Okay, guys, that completed the orbital science visual pass. Any other comments you'd want to make about the landing site.
2095035|CDR|Yes. It's an interesting place.
2095035|CC|No, not that. From a geological standpoint from orbit.
2095135|CDR|Yes. And I've got - well, my white spot, there, is ... the same spot. There are two white spots I'm talking about, now. The one I'm talking about primarily is the one I saw right after landing, on the thing was a lighter - lighter grayish area that was evidently blown up from the LM landing. And that's still in the same spot. You can still see that all right.
2095259|CC|We'd like PAN CAMERA POWER to OFF, now.
2095308|LMP|It's OFF.
2095309|CC|Okay, Ron, anytime you're ready now, I've got a - that whole series of Flight Plan updates and I've got a few words of explanation with each one, so, maybe you might want to take these.
2095325|CMP|Okay.
2095333|CC|Okay, HIGH GAIN to AUTO.
2095340|CMP|HIGH GAIN'S in AUTO.
2095347|CC|Ya, one more question. How large is the bright zone you were talking about, Ron?
2095357|CMP|Right between Sherlock and Camelot there are two small craters there and I'll have to get my map out to look for the name of them for sure.
2095414|CC|Okay.
2095415|CMP|They should have been behind the LM - right behind the LM. And the bright spot is about the same size as those.
2095421|CC|Okay. - -
2095423|CMP|And it makes I would say an equilateral triangle with those two craters.
2095428|CC|Okay, fine, I would recommend one of you go on to the "configure camera" while we start the Flight Plan update. We'd like to get the Flight Plan update all read prior to that P52 that you've got to do there, and somebody will be taking those terminator photos.
2095445|CMP|Okay, soon as Gene - Gene's drawing in the Flight Plan, there. That crater - Okay, ready for a Flight Plan update.
2095502|CC|Okay. Who's going to take the terminator photos. You want me to give you call about 2 minutes before the photo time?
2095508|CMP|Yes. Jack will.
2095509|CC|Okay, well, here's the Flight Plan update, then. At 210:30 - 210:30, add the following - -
2095520|CMP|Okay.
2095520|CC|- - MAPPING CAMERA, OFF; wait 30 seconds; MAPPING CAMERA, STANDBY; IMAGE MOTION, OFF; LASER ALTIMETER, OFF; select P00, P00; VERB
2095554|CMP|Okay.
2095554|CC|- - 49 maneuver to UV scan attitude. The angles are as follows: 167, 125, 354. Over.
2095621|CMP|Okay. MAPPING CAMERA, OFF - this is at 210:30, MAPPING CAMERA, OFF. Wait 30 seconds. MAPPING CAMERA to STANDBY, IMAGE MOTION to OFF, LASER ALTIMETER, OFF. P00. V49 to UV scan attitude. Roll 167, pitch 125, yaw 354.
2095638|CC|Good call, Ron. The next one is at 210:35 and this is a P20 maneuver that's going to set up a rotation about the X-axis for a UV scan. Ready to copy?
2095653|CMP|Okay.
2095655|CC|P20, option 2, UV scan. NOUN 78 - -
2095707|CMP|Okay.
2095708|CC|- - NOUN 78 all zeros; 0, 0, and 0. NOUN 79: minus 0.4000, plus 000.50; NOUN 34: 00210, 00042, 019.00. Over.
2095755|CMP|Okay, P2 at 210:35 will be P10, uh, P20 for UV scan option 2. NOUN 78's are all zeros, NOUN 79 a minus 0.4 of a degree per second. is that right?
2095812|CC|That's affirm.
2095813|CMP|Minus 0.4000.
2095817|CC|Okay.
2095817|CMP|Okay, then dead band is at 0.5 a half-degree. NOUN 34 is 210, 42, 19.00.
2095826|CC|That's affirmative, Ron. Okay, at 210:41.
2095835|CMP|Okay, 210:41.
2095836|CC|Add the line, the standard line, verify DSE tape motion, HIGH BIT RATE, RECORD/FORWARD, COMMAND RESET.
2095859|CMP|Okay, at 41, verify tape motion, HIGH BIT RATE, RECORD/FORWARD and COMMAND RESET.
2095906|CC|Roger. At 210:57, we've got another P20, Ron. And this P20 will set up the orb rate - -
2095914|CMP|Okay.
2095914|CC|- - minus sight on the horizon. Okay, here's the P20, option 5. NOUN 78, plus 162.01 - let me read that again, plus 162.01 - plus 040.76, plus 184.78; NOUN 79, plus 000.50. And we're going to orb rate around the Moon, so NOUN 70 will have a 50 in it for the Moon.
2100018|CMP|Okay, at 57, it will be P20, option 5. Orb rate to minus sight on horizon; NOUN 78s are plus 162.01, plus 40.76, and plus 184.78; NOUN 79s are half a degree; and it'll be an orb rate around the Moon - 50. Okay?
2100038|CC|Roger, Ron. Okay. Stand by.
2100050|CMP|Bob, while I'm standing by there, oh, that's all right. Must be my other map.
2100105|CC|Okay, Ron. We're ready with some more if you are.
2100111|CMP|Okay, go.
2100114|CC|Okay, at 211:02. Add the following at 211:02: UV cover CLOSED, and, in parentheses, put 211:02:09. Configure DSE - -
2100145|CMP|Okay, we're going to close - Oh - That's all right, go ahead.
2100151|CC|Configure DSE STOP/COMMAND RESET. Select P00. Manual roll left to a roll angle 039 by 211:05. Over.
2100227|CMP|Okay. UV cover CLOSED at 211:02:09. Configure the DSE STOP/COMMAND RESET. Whip her into P00 and manually roll left to 039 by 211 plus 05.
2100243|CC|Roger. And just the prediction from the simulator, you might want to use ACCEL command for a rate of about 1 degree per second to accomplish that. And that - The purpose of that is to get the Sun out of the mapping camera.
2100254|CMP|Okay. Okay, can do, ACCEL command to 1 degree per second.
2100306|CC|Okay, at 211:08.
2100317|CMP|Just a second, ...
2100319|CC|Roger.
2100320|CMP|Hey, Jack on here it shows the little circles on the map, which part you ought to be taking for each, rev 2 or whatever it is.
2100330|CC|We're in rev 62.
2100330|CMP|Except that, for some reason, on my map D it doesn't have - Yes - on map Delta. I must have got the backup map or something, I didn't have any of the photo - the camera settings on it. (Laughter) Terminator photos.
2100350|CC|Ron, we can break from this now, we're pretty well ahead, and we can come back to it, if you want to do the photos.
2100358|CMP|Hey, yes. Do you have the - Do you have the options, there, on the La Hire Rille? And Mount La Hire - which - what the photo settings are.
2100412|CC|Roger, I've got them, and I can read them - I'll read them to you right off the mop [sic] - map.
2100416|CMP|Okay.
2100417|CC|Okay, if you're looking right at the map - -
2100419|CMP|Okay, read them.
2100419|CC|- - draw - draw a circle around La Hire Bravo. And that is f/32 - -
2100425|CMP|Oh, I've got the circles on it.
2100428|CC|- - 1/500.
2100431|CMP|Yes. f/32, 1/500. Okay, start with that one, Jack.
2100436|CC|Got the circle around Mount La Hire? It's f/11.
2100439|CMP|250-millimeter lens - f/11, okay.
2100447|CC|At the next circle up, which crosses - which encompasses the "La" of La Hire Rilles, you want f/8 at 1/250.
2100501|CMP|Okay.
2100502|CC|And the one that crosses - the circle that covers across the terminator there at Diophantus is f/5.6 at 1/125, 1/125. Get the wrong - -
2100522|CMP|Okay, we got them all, Bob. Thank you.
2100524|CC|Okay, just a question for some other period. Will we have to update your map for P66 and P74 revs?
2100533|CMP|Yes. I don't have anything on this map.
2100536|CC|Okay, we'll schedule that in prior to those revs, Ron.
2100541|CMP|Yes. Okay.
2100549|CMP|Okay, we're coming up on Timocharis, now. Start at Lambert and get the - right along the La Hire Rille, see - Yes. Take six - six - six shots you know, kind of each area at that - You know, north and south. Yes, you know point them every which way, or whatever's interesting on the thing. Okay.
2100640|CMP|Okay. Mount La Hire, you can get in there at f/11 at 1/500.
2100722|CC|Hey, Ron. Just - Just a point. -
2100723|SC|There's Euler coming up there. Okay, go ahead, Bob.
2100729|CC|Do you have two copies of the maps onboard? And if so, did the - would the other copy of "D" have the updates on it? Or have the settings?
2100741|CMP|Have 2 copies? I didn't know we had two copies. Okay, and then next to Euler, we've got f/8 at 1/250 - north of Euler, There's - well we're just - Okay, we're just about at the - on the terminator line. Yes. No, f/8 at - at 1/250. Okay. Yes, north and south along the terminator. You're getting close to it. Then, change to - right on the terminator - change to f/5-6 at 1/125. I was wondering when you guys were going to say that. (Laughter) Okay.
2100908|CMP|(Laughter) Yes, that'll be a good one. I'll tell you, it goes a lot easier when you're by yourself.
2100927|CMP|Okay, yes, we're on mag 55. I mean frame 55 ana mag Romeo Romeo.
2100939|CMP|Yes, we didn't get some of the ones up around La Hire. We'll get those next time around.
2100953|CC|How's the pictures going, Ron?
2100957|CMP|Okay, we got - The pictures are over. And that's Lunar Orbit Chart Delta. It doesn't have anything on it, you know - -
2101004|CC|Okay, we'll - -
2101005|CMP|- - it's the circles on it, but it doesn't have any of the - -
2101008|CC|We'll - We'll schedule it up - all the fli - all the updates on that. After you go LOS we'll figure out some convenient time to read them up to you on there, Ron. I've got a - I've got the Flight Plan - -
2101018|CMP|Okay, and we're ready to continue the Flight Plan.
2101020|CC|Okay. 211:08, 211:08.
2101026|CMP|Okay. We're all set.
2101033|CC|Ron, just one comment before we start the Flight Plan. You've got a 52 coming up and we want to make sure that gets done prior to the VERB 49 maneuver at 210:30. And there is no slack on that VERB 49 maneuver at 210:30. So you'll have to get on to the 52 at about 20, but we should have enough time to get the rest of these updates up.
2101054|CMP|Okay.
2101056|CC|Okay, Ron, at 211:08 delete the lines: Mapping camera - OFF, wait 30 seconds, mapping camera - STANDBY, image motion - OFF, and laser altimeter - OFF. Delete those lines.
2101114|CMP|Okay, they're deleted.
2101115|CC|Okay, at 211:11, change the RECEIVE ONLY ATTITUDE to the following: roll, 039; pitch 159; yaw 300.
2101139|CMP|Okay at 211:11, VERB 49 will be to 039, 159, and 300.
2101147|CC|Okay. At 211:26 we're going to do a P20 maneuver. It's going to be a rolling P20 which will roll about the OMNI Bravo line-of-sight to the Earth. We'll need high bit rate during that time. That's why we need the - line of Bravo. And we're doing the Earth study of - with the - with the lunar sounder to determine the polarization of the noise from the Earth so we can subtract it out of our data. And during these maneuvers, you're going to see a middle gimbal angle of plus or minus 65 degrees. We saw that on the - on the simulator, but a word of caution on that. You'll see a middle gimbal angle of plus or minus 65 degrees.
2101232|CC|The P20 maneuver is as follows: at 211:26, P20 option - -
2101240|CMP|Okay.
2101240|CC|- - P20 option 2, HF scan, NOUN 78: plus 270.00, minus 039.30; NOUN 79: minus 0.3000, plus 000.50; NOUN 34 is all zeros.
2101320|CMP|Hold it there, Bob.
2101320|CC|Okay, Roger.
2101327|CMP|Let me get - I got your NOUN, - I got fouled up in the NOUN 78s. Option, I'm going to need two of those, so it's NOUN 78 is plus 270.00 and a minus 039.30. Okay, your NOUN 79's now are - are say again.
2101343|CC|Minus 0.3000. And now for other NOUN 39 - -
2101353|CMP|Okay, 0.3 of a degree per second.
2101356|CC|Rog, and 0.5, 0.5 - half a degree dead band.
2101405|CMP|Okay.
2101407|CC|And, NOUN 34s are all zeros.
2101420|CMP|Okay, so you're going to PRO at 211:26 then, right.
2101426|CC|That's affirmative.
2101429|CMP|Okay.
2101443|CC|Okay, Ron, this next one - actually we're calling it 212:20, but the simulator came out at 212:18:40, just for information. And it's the following: Stop scan at roll 039.
2101510|CMP|Okay. Stop scan at roll 039.
2101512|CC|Rog. VERB 49 maneuver to lunar sounder RECEIVE ONLY attitude. Roll 142, pitch 286, yaw zero.
2101539|CMP|Okay. VERB 49, lunar sounder RECEIVE ONLY, roll 142, pitch 286, yaw zero.
2101545|CC|Okay, and then the last one is 213:03. Configure the DSE high bit rate RECORD/FORWARD/COMMAND RESET.
2101613|CMP|Okay. At 213 - was that 03?
2101619|CC|03, that's affirm.
2101619|CMP|Configure DSE high bit rate RECORD/FORWARD/COMMAND. Okay.
2101624|CC|Okay -
2101626|CMP|For the high bit rate, RECORD/FORWARD/COMMAND RESET.
2101629|CC|Ron, we'll be - No more Flight Plan updates we promise today and we'll be working - -
2101636|CMP|(Laughter)
2101636|CC|- - map Delta and getting that updated to you, but everybody here thinks there's two maps onboard and I think you're right. I think there's only one, in there.
2101645|CMP|Oh really. is that so?
2101652|CC|FAO thinks there are two - -
2101653|CMP|- - Oh, wait a minute. Jack said they put an extra one - Okay, well, there were two. Jack just said he had one put on for him.
2101703|CC|Okay.
2101703|CMP|I must have picked his up or something.
2101705|CC|Roger.
2101705|CMP|Mine must be in there then, somewhere. We'll look for it.
2101707|CC|Okay, if you'll check that and tell us if we need to update you. We'll still plan to update, but if you've got it, fine.
2101714|CMP|Okay.
2101716|CC|And it looks like you ought to be getting in your P52 when you get a chance here.
2101723|CMP|Yes, I'll get her down here. (Humming) Can't tell about these geologists. They put on extra maps in your spacecraft and things like that, you know. Yes, I get - I gave you the last frame number on that Romeo Romeo, but I think I forgot to tell you the one after the - the other one. Oh, by the way, on the other one, Agassiz was completely in the darkness and there was no crater rim at all to shine down on Agassiz so we didn't get him at all.
2101807|CC|We copy that.
2101823|CMP|Oh, are we in P20? Go to FREE. We use to be in 20 - P20 - We'll get back into P20. Not much, but that's all right.
2101853|CMP|They go right along here. I have them right along here and shove them down over there is what they used to do with them. They haven't called. Get into AUTO now, CMC AUTO.
2101922|CMP|Okay, are we at - that's going and everything. Okay, go CMC FREE now. Okay. That's my fault, Gene, I should have gotten it. (Laughter) That's right - number 12 Rigel. Hey, I can find Rigel I bet you. There she comes. There's Orion. Man, oh man, I've done P52 only, and it's within the - within a half of a crosshair width. Come on, Alphard.
2102122|CMP|Ah, ha! There's Alphard - for rev 62. Come on in there, baby. Well, up to my usual tricks (laughter). Ah, 12 and 21 - stars 12 and 21. Star angle difference, 5 balls.
2102211|CMP|Okay, Houston. There's the NOUN 93s.
2102219|CC|Roger. We copied them down.
2102225|CMP|Okay, and we'll torque them at 22:45.
2102236|CC|We copy.
2102240|CMP|Okay.
2102246|CMP|Okay. Give us the AUTO now.
2102300|CMP|Okay.
2102314|CMP|Okay, just a second, Gene, let me look at it. See resolve - Power is OFF. Do the old optics? Yes. I think - (Laughter) Outstanding idea - have a great drink. (Laughter) Okay, 24. Done that. Doesn't matter. Okay.
2102443|CMP|Houston, America.
2102451|CC|Say - say again.
2102455|CMP|Okay. Hey, Bob, how many frames of mag RR do we have to diddle with? Kind of our own, or are there any?
2102507|CC|That's in work right now.
2102510|CMP|Okay. Aha, here's another chart D.
2102519|CC|I do owe you a consumables status yet, and - -
2102521|CMP|Who knows - it's got all stuff in it. Hey, do we - we have a good chart Delta.
2102535|CC|Okay. Good. Great. I owe you a consumables status, and when you woke up, you were right on the Flight Plan line, and you had 53 percent remaining of RCS. And, all other consumables are on the line or above.
2102549|CMP|Okay.
2102552|LMP|Hey, Bob. Sorry we didn't let you get that in. We're not moving too fast for you, are we? (Laughter)
2102612|CC|Ron, you have zero spares on RR. No - no film available for yourself on RR.
2102621|CMP|Oh, okay. We'll - -
2102622|LMP|Hey - hey, Bob, this is Jack. If you could possibly swing it, I would strongly recommend that we let Ron redo that last terminator sequence if we can work it in the Flight Plan, because Gene and I may or may not have done what you wanted there, and I know we missed the first couple of them.
2102640|CMP|I'll - I'll use the 35-millimeter. I still got about 8 or 10 frames on the 35 - -
2102647|CC|Okay, we'll take that word under advisement, and we'll evaluate it.
2102655|CMP|(Laughter)
2102657|LMP|Thank you. We may have to send you to the U.N. with that diplomacy.
2102710|CC|Thanks a lot for your confidence, Geno [sic].
2102725|MS|(Laughter)
2102731|CDR|Glad to hear your voice down there, boss - Admiral
2102941|CMP|Okay, Houston. Mapping camera is OFF.
2102947|CC|Roger, Ron.
2102954|CC|Okay, we sug - suggest you start that VERB 49 maneuver at 210:30, or you'll be behind the eight-ball there on time.
2103126|CMP|Okay, Image motion is coming OFF. Laser altimeter is coming OFF.
2103402|CC|America, Houston. You're looking real good here coming up to LOS, and we'll see you at 211:22. You're looking good.
2103412|CMP|Okay. Will do.
2103426||BEGIN LUNAR REV 63
2103829|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal. Apollo 17 spacecraft, America has gone behind the Moon nearing the end of revolution number 62. It will reappear again in about 48 minutes on revolution 63. Presently the orbit measures 62.4 by 65.2. Cabin pressure was holding steady at 4.8 pounds per square inch aboard the spacecraft, America. The crew busily running some photographic assignments, both with the Hand cameras in the cabin and the mapping and panorama camera is back in the SIM bay of the Service Module. Members of the white team of flight controllers beginning to drift in to replace the off-going gold team. And at 210 hours 39 minutes, Ground Elapse Time, this is Apollo Control.
2112110|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 211 hours 21 minutes. We are about 1 minute now from regaining radio contact with Apollo 17 as it comes around the eastern limb of the Moon on it's 63rd revolution. Here in Mission Control we've completed a shift handover. The Flight Director on this shift is Charles Lewis, and our Spacecraft Communicator is Astronaut Gordon Fullerton. Flight Director, Chuck Lewis has completed a status review for each of his flight controllers and from all around the room reports of everything nominal come back. During this shift two things of interest will be the firing of the explosive charges left on the lunar surface by the astronauts to SS scientists and determining the sub-surface structure. The first of these charges, designated charge No. 6 is scheduled to be detonated at about 212 hours 51 minutes. There is some latitude in this event and because of that we'll have the television camera on the lunar Rover up early to catch the event as - at it's earliest possible occurrence, which would be 212 hours 21 minutes and will leave it up through 213 hours 21 minutes.
2112126|CC|Hey, America; Houston here.
2112126|CMP|Hi, Gordo. Good morning.
2112126|CC|It's afternoon - right, afternoon.
2112126|CMP|Well, we want to PRO on that at 26. - 20 roll about OMNI Bravo.
2112126|SC|Oh , that' s ...
2112126|CMP|Yes, that's Earth study ... lunar sounder and the middle gimbal - -
2112126|CMP|Yes. How's the weather been there today, Gordo? (Music in background)
2112126|CC|America, Houston. I missed your last, if that was for me.
2112443|CMP|Yes. Just checking to see how the weather was doing there in Houston before you came in to work.
2112449|CC|Oh, it's kind of - bunch of high clouds, cirrus, I guess,  but it's down around 35, I'd say, and pretty windy. So it's nippy when you're outside.
2112506|CMP|Ah ha!
2112513|CMP|And, Houston, how's my biomed looking?
2112534|CC|About 10 seconds to your PRO, there.
2112539|CMP|Okay; thank you.
2112546|CC|America, we'd like the IR COVER, CLOSED - -
2112549|CMP|Oh, and away we go.
2112549|CC|- - and I think there might be a chance the Sun will get in it there.
2112556|CMP|Okay.
2112557|CDR|Okay, Gordy. And we're rolling ... - -
2112559|CMP|Barber pole, gray.
2112604|CC|Okay.
2112639|CC|Ron, your EKG looks good. The Surgeon wondered how the irritation that you had mentioned, because of the sensors, is - is it getting any better?
2112656|CMP|Well, it's - yes, it gets better when you take them off and leave it off for a while and I put the cream on it. And looks like it lasts for about a day. You know every time I put it on. I put it on at a different spot. And it takes about a day for it to get red and irritated.
2112720|CDR|And, Gordo, for information, that's not unique; we're all having that, and taking them off is the best relief for it.
2112731|CC|Okay.
2112759|CC|America, I've got some words about what you might use for optional - crew optional photographs. Over.
2112814|CMP|Okay, yes, let's write it down there in the - why don't you write it on the back page, or something like that, so we'll know where it is.
2112834|CMP|Okay. (Music in background) Ready to copy.
2112842|CC|Okay. Magazine RR has no spare frames. So if you want to take any photos, we are suggesting using the-DAC and the 75-mm lens and using JJ which is very high-speed black and white. Ninety-eight percent of JJ is unscheduled. Here are some settings you might use for terminator photographs over mare. Use T2.8, 1/500, and infinity. For terminator over highlands, use T4, 1/500, and infinity. And for Tsiolkovsky on rev 74 that's GET of 232:58; that's sometime in the future here - we're suggesting using T5.6, 1/500, and infinity. Over.
2113006|LMP|Okay, Gordo, what was the f-stop for the highlands terminator?
2113011|CC|Okay, the highlands terminator would be T4. I guess that's the far-side terminator, and the nearside terminator is over mare. That's the mare setting.
2113028|LMP|Okay.
2113301|LMP|Hello, Houston; America, is today Friday down there?
2113315|CC|America, Houston. I'm sorry. Say again, please.
2113320|LMP|Just wondering, Gordo, if today is Friday.
2113324|CC|That's affirmative. It's Friday.
2113330|LMP|Okay, thank you.
2113332|CC|Happens to be pay day. It's the 15th.
2113816|CC|Jack, Houston. We see no need for you to wear any of your biomed sensors; if you'd rather take them off, give your skin a rest, feel free.
2113829|LMP|Okay, Gordy. I've done that. And I'll wait till my next time and put them on then.
2113837|CC|Okay.
2114115|LMP|Gordy, how do you read LMP?
2114118|CC|You're loud and clear, Jack.
2114124|LMP|While we're in a relatively quiet period, we're going to make a few comments about some of the things that cross the two big basins that we're getting very familiar with - or, actually, three: Smythii, Ori - Smythii, Crisium, and Serenitatis - and the degradation of the balls of the major ring and the lack of any obvious blanket structures, I think, in contrast to Imbrium and Orientale, which we've also had a pretty good look at - Orientale and Earthshine, on the earlier revs - is quite striking - that contrast is quite striking - to me, at any rate. Also, within Orientale, the - at least at the southeast - on the east-southeast portions of the mare floor, the wrinkle-ridge system is not nearly as well developed; but there is a wrinkle-ridge system that roughly forms an inner floor ring, at any rate.
2114251|CC|Roger.
2114258|LMP|The fronts of the major ring in Crisium are strikingly different than those of the Apennines just in their general slopes; sharpness of topographical features; and in any appearance of having even a hint of boulder fields on their slopes like we observed, say, on the South Massif, anything like that. At least Serenitatis massifs seem to locally show fairly major boulder fields on their flanks. And I haven't seen any around Crisium yet. Maybe Ron's already talked to you about that, but I haven't seen any.
2114350|CC|Okay.
2114358|LMP|Yes. The craters now. I'm speaking of the, Ron, of the front faces themselves, the rim - the face of the ring itself.
2114408|CMP|Oh, I see. The face of the ring itself - okay; that's what you're talking about.
2114412|LMP|Yes, yes. Now it - a crater - a fresh crater in the mare or a fresh crater in the blanket area - rim area - will have boulders, Gordy; don't misunderstand me. But the front faces - the ring front face does not have boulders - that I can see. And I think boulders are pretty obvious when they're there. We've seen them well defined on the central peaks of Tsiolkovsky, and I think any time you have a major boulder popu - field, you can see it with the monocular - with the 10-power monocular.
2114448|CC|Roger.
2114506|LMP|Getting into areas that resemble, in their surface texture, the Sculptured Hills of the Taurus-Littrow landing area, here we're just passing - Now where are we? - that would be (laughter) I got disoriented all of the sudden. Proclus is there, so it's in the ray-excluded zone of Proclus where there is a mare surface projecting up into terrain that looks like Sculptured Hills. And that mare has a distinct bluish-gray color, in contrast to the regolith associated with the Sculptured Hills - between the Hills at least - which is a brown - let's call it a tannish gray. Quite a sharp color hue contrast to my eyes, at any rate.
2114612|CC|Roger.
2114632|LMP|Okay. That was a projection of Fecunditatis Mare, I guess, up into there. Sculptured Hills tend to have both a regional distribution and a structurally controlled distribution, the structurally - structural control being apparently related to the rims of - of old craters. For example, there are some Sculptured-Hills-appearing topographic materials that - again, in the ray-excluded zone, but out in Fecunditatis, we find the rim of a fairly large flooded crater - in Fecunditatis. And all of this may tie in with the possible - possibility that we saw at the landing site, that Sculptured Hills are composed of an igneous gabbroic rock. And these may represent local intrusions controlled by the structure of an old impact crater - extrusions controlled by the structure of the old impact crater.
2114757|CC|Roger.
2114810|LMP|I've noticed - now I'm getting a good view of where in Fecunditatis there is a tannish - or let's call it more of a brownish-gray mare in contrast to bluish-gray mare in Fecunditatis itself.
2114834|CC|Roger.
2114841|LMP|And in the walls of some - of a large crater -I'll try to figure out which one it is in a minute. It's near the large crater that the Sculptured Hills define you can see in the east wall - or maybe northeast wall of that crater - an area of bluish-gray - material that is streaking the normal tan-gray of that crater wall.
2114922|CC|Roger.
2114941|CC|This is a kind of one-sided discussion. I wish I was there so I could take a more active part.
2114948|LMP|That's all right. I just thought I'd fill in a few things. This isn't a good viewing attitude at all, and we get a few isolated views that may be worth commenting on. The contrast, in my eye anyway, between the three color units around the landing site is a - let's call it a medium bluish gray to gray for the dark mantle; a light blue-gray for the annulus around Serenitatis; and, then, a tan-gray for the Serenitatis Mare proper. And, in Dawes, you can see - I think you can see that the overturned - or the - the rim materials are made up of the brownish-gray material, and the walls underneath those rims are the bluish-gray, which is the age relationship suggested by topography. That'd be the over - lower unit is forming the rim with inverted stratigraphy.
2115102|CC|Roger.
2115111|LMP|The light blue-gray annulus is also the locus of most of the circumferential grabens, that Serenitatis is noted for, is in that area. And that's nothing new. But, in one place, there's a very subdued, flooded crater which seems to control a arcuate projection - or, let's say, a circular projection - of the light blue-gray out over the tan-gray mare. Most of the major wrinkle-ridge system of Serenitatis, of course, is outside the annulus of blue-gray, except locally, and one of those places was in the - to the west of the Taurus-Littrow site. Although that wrinkle-ridge system does - I can see now, as we look south of Seren - in the southern portions of Serenitatis that wrinkle-ridge system does cross the contact between the blue-gray and the tan-gray. That's the light blue-gray and the tan-gray.
2115246|CC|Okay.
2115250|LMP|The impression I've had in looking at all the mare where the wrinkle-ridge systems are developed is that they're a late feature. They - at least at low Sun, and sometimes even at high Sun - they have a very - very sharply defined ridges with steep slopes on either side that seem - that, in general, give me the impression that they're constructional, possibly associated with some thrusting movement.
2115337|LMP|In the vicinity of Sulpicius Gallus, there are several small craters that look like impact craters that, believe it or not, have - in my eye, anyway - orange ejecta blankets.
2115359|CC|Roger.
2115404|LMP|Yes. Ron says that he - that he already commented on those, and they're - and they look very obvious to me. No, I - I don't - no. I don't think you can with those windows. We'll get a good view of them again in one of the other attitudes.
2115433|LMP|It's a light orange, obviously, not a - that it but it's in contrast to the brown-gray of the dark mantle in the vicinity of Sulpicius Gallus. There's a good one right down there. Now, that one looks like a constructional cone that's orangish. And that's - that's right out on a raised projection of the - of the brown-gray dark mantle out onto the - out onto the light blue-gray annulus material.
2115539|LMP|This southern and southwestern portion of Serenitatis has a general appearance of the Sculptured Hills, although the individual hills seem to be more widely spaced than around Taurus-Littrow. Once again, historically, we're passing over the landing site of Apollo - or near the landing site of Apollo 15.
2115701|LMP|Tell Dave Scott that the north complex looks just as interesting as it ever did. It's going to remain with Emory crater as one of the unknowns of the space program for a while, I guess.
2115718|CC|Roger.
2115727|CDR|Hey, Gordo, I've been looking at the landing site, off and on the last few revs, and I'd like to get - now that we've been there and back - your best guess of the exact position of what you think we landed, because I think I've got it pinpointed pretty much so from here.
2115755|CC|Okay. Stand by 1.
2115759|PAO|That question on the landing site location coming from Eugene Cernan.
2115809|LMP|This is one of the first opportunities that I've had to look closely at Archimedes, which is one of those craters that, in the early days of the lunar mapping program, helped establish some of the fundamental age relationships between the various units that were visible in the Earth-based photography. In this particular case, it related to the sequence of events that created Imbrium, cratered it, and then flooded it with mare. And Archimedes is a completely circular - closed circle as a crater, and it is filled with mare. And it, in itself, is superimposed on the - one of the main benches of the Imbrium crater. Now, to have mare filling that crater and actually filling all the depressions of approximately the same level in the vicinity of a mare - of a large mare region, it's one of the things that's suggested to many people that rather than single sources for mare lavas, you have a multitude of sources in a very fractured lunar crust. The ultimate source in depth, though, is still certainly a subject for controversy.
2120010|LMP|Some of the ridge and valley structure of the Archimedes impact blanket is not covered by mare and extends to the southeast out onto the Imbrium bench. That was also one of the pieces of evidence used in those early days of photogeologic mapping of the Moon. You'll have to excuse the reminiscing, Gordy.
2120055|CC|Roger.
2120110|CMP|And, Houston; America. Frame 150 - 151 and 152 were taken of the Sulpicius Gallus region with a 250 lens. 154 was taken at D-Caldera, and that's magazine Oscar Oscar.
2120132|CC|Okay, Ron.
2120143|CC|This is Apollo Control at 212 hours 2 minutes and we've within the last couple of minutes had a report from the ALSEP officer here that we're seeing seismic activity on the seismic profiling experiment which indicates that our first charge may have detonated early, either that or a meteorite has struck within range to be recorded on the instrument and we'll be checking that first grenade charge 6, which is a one pounder, was scheduled to have been detonated at 212 hours 51 minutes. It does have a mechanical timer and from past experience we know that mechanical timer to have some variability and when it opens the window allowing a continuous firing command to get through and fire the charge.
2120236|LMP|Gordy, I guess it was the crater Bessel in Serenitatis that Ron and I were looking at last night. And I think he had commented on being layers in the ledges that were visible in the walls, and I certainly concur with that. Although we could not trace layers - individual layers from ledge to ledge, within a coherent ledge the layers were traceable; and, in one case, I'm sure I could count six or seven ledges - sub - well, layers within single ledges. Reason it reminded me of it is looking at Timocharis, and I cannot do that with Timocharis. It looks like it's - those ledges - any ledges that may have been present as a result of the Imbrium Mare have since disappeared by weathering. That's lunar weathering, of course. Of course, down here in the Imbrium - southern Imbrium - is one of the better regions of the Moon to observe the wrinkle-ridge systems or mare ridges, sometimes they're called. And it's purely that. They're fairly sharply defined - quite sharply defined ridges that are wrinkled in their pattern, sinuous would be another term. And with sharply defined slopes on either side of the ridge. Sometimes they are flat-top ridges; sometimes they are more like spines. And occasionally you see them that almost appear to have vertical slopes on one wall or the other. The whole impression that I have, anyway, is that they - there may be a combination of structure and folding of the surface of the mare - construction on the surface and folding of that surface. They're particularly interesting that they tend to - wherever there has apparently been an old sub - flooded crater - Yes, did you want to get that stuff? They seem to be controlled by the shape of flooded old craters within the Imbrium basin. And I think that's a safe conclusion, because you get the standard outlines shown by the rille - the ridges; excuse me. Some of them are polygonal, and some of them are quite circular.
2120555|LMP|Ron, did you want to get these ridges, these rilles south of Euler here?
2120600|CMP|Yes.
2120600|LMP|Okay. They're coming up.
2120603|CC|America, Houston.
2120607|LMP|Go ahead.
2120609|CC|Okay. I guess the last team promised you no changes to the Flight Plan, but they didn't say anything about changes to the changes; and I've got one. At 15 minutes from now, 212:20 - -
2120623|CDR|Can you stand by a minute?
2120624|CC|- - in the Flight Plan. Might get that out, and I'll give you a change.
2120629|CMP|Just keep talking, Gordo.
2120632|CC|Okay. At 212:20, you're to stop the roll at 39 degrees and then do a VERB 49 to 142. And we want to change the PITCH to 268 and zero. That would be 142, 268, and zero.
2120655|CDR|Okay. I got that change. And you want that about 18 - 212:18?
2120702|CC|I - have to check back here. Yes, I guess that's when it is.
2120709|CDR|Okay.
2120712|CC|Also, as long as you've got the book and a pencil, let me give you a few other one liners.
2120718|CDR|Yes, I'm ready to copy them.
2120721|CC|Okay. Let's see. The first one is at 214:55. And they want to add after that other stuff just above there "UV COVER OPEN" and "IR COVER OPEN."
2120752|CDR|Okay. At 214:55s you want UV and IR COVERs OPEN.
2120756|CC|Roger. Turn the page. At 215:37 - 215:37. Change magazine November November to Kilo Kilo.
2120815|CDR|Okay.
2120817|CC|And the reason I'm so slow with an answer on that landing site position is, all I've got it in is latitude and longitude; and I assume that you want it in good coordinates, for your reference. One suggestion here was, you tell us, and then we'll confirm your guess. I just ran across an other couple updates, too. Back to 213:15 in the Flight Plan, I can give you the lunar sounder pads - the two of them on that page.
2120854|CDR|Okay. I'll get them. Go ahead.
2120856|CC|Okay. T-start on the left-hand one there, is 213:20:10, and T-stop is 213:24:20. Then the next one is T-start of 213:41:40, and a T-stop of 213:59:54. Over.
2120930|CDR|Okay, Gordo, got them all. They're all at 213 hours. Start is 20:10; stop, 24:20. Start is 41:40, and stop is 59:54.
2120940|CC|Okay. Good readback.
2120948|CDR|And, Gordo, I guess my best guess after looking down there from here is - I've got a - the northeast chart of the lunar surface traverse ... And about 84 point - correction, about 83.3 and about and Delta ... point 5. We're right on the top of the hole in Poppy. Looks to be about where we landed.
2121024|CC|Okay. We got that.
2121028|CDR|And, in thinking back about what my intentions were, that looks like probably a very reasonable -reasonable suggestion. And the first thought I had about being close to Trident, I didn't think I was anywhere near that close. And, of course, when you look out there and see a big hole, you don't know how big is big when you're down there. That big hole out there might very easily could have been Poppy out at 9 o'clock.
2121100|CC|Okay, Geno, from science we finally got it to where it converted to your map coordinates; and their guess was close. Their best guess, with all the data considered, is 83.2 and DN 0.1 - Delta November 0.1.
2121125|LMP|That would definitely make sense, Geno ... - -
2121127|CMP|That's pretty close to where the old CMP said it the first rev after landing, isn't it?
2121132|LMP|- - north of where we put the ... Remember, that was a little ways away. You were at the edge of the depression, and it would - move it a little.
2121140|CDR|Yes, I'll buy that. That's in my scatter. And then that crater, as I looked out at 9 o'clock, we landed next to was actually Poppy. Pretty sure that's that large crater.
2121154|CC|Okay.
2121211|CMP|And, Houston; America. On mag Yankee Yankee used frames 31 through 35 at that last near-side terminator there.
2121224|CC|Okay, Ron. Got that.
2121242|PAO|This is Apollo Control. There is some debate in the Control Center at this time as to whether or not that first explosive charge did, in fact, fire early, or whether the seismic profiling experiment was instead a reacting on natural phenomenon, such as a meteorite impact or a Moon quake and we have brought up the television camera on the Lunar Rover early and we'll be looking at the area and attempting to draw some conclusions as to whether the aft charge did in fact go early or whether it's still in place. Now that question could be answered quite neatly if the charge, of course, explodes on command as it's scheduled to at about 212 hours, 51 minutes. And that first charge is 1-pound explosive charge about 1.1 kilometer from the Lunar Rover.
2121449|CDR|Gordo, I'm just going to stop this maneuver this time around at 39 degrees.
2121457|CC|Okay, Gene. Say, we've got one question for Ron. We've got large teams of engineers trying to locate the missing scissors, and we haven't asked you in a while whether you might have found them. That might save them a lot of effort down here.
2121515|CMP|No, I haven't found them yet. And there's a lot of room underneath these CO2 absorbers I found out the other night because I lost my flashlight. But it kind of floated out, and I saw it every once in a while. And we found the flashlight and got it back, but I still haven't the slightest idea where the scissors are.
2121536|CDR|Gordo, you might have someone hide them in the CMS and send a backup crew down to the Cape and see how long it takes them to find them.
2121544|CC|Okay. I'll get an airplane scheduled up right away.
2121550|CDR|I just missed 39 degrees. I'll wait for it next time around.
2121557|LMP|By the way, Gordy, you working on next week's airplane schedule?
2121603|CC|Yes , what do you need? You mean the one from Hawaii back or something like that?
2121613|LMP|Yes, you might have some 38s waiting for us in LA; we can pick them up there.
2121620|CC|Okay; but we'll have to work a three-way swap with some Skylab troops that will be out there. And then Deke will meet you in Albuquerque halfway back; and I'll let you know how it all works out.
2121635|LMP|That sounds great. That sounds like easier than usual.
2121718|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We have a Press Breifing scheduled with the flight director from the previous shift, Neil Hutchenson. And that Press Breifing is scheduled to begin in about 5 minutes at 5:15 PM in the MSC News Center Breifing Room.
2122253|CDR|Every commander has the right to change his mind.
2122331|CDR|And, Gordy, I'll watch the cranapple.
2122337|CC|Okay, Geno.
2122656|PAO|This is Apollo control at 212 hours 28 minutes. We are ready to switch to the MSC news center briefing room now for the press conference press briefing with flight director Neil Hutchinson. There is a possibility that during this briefing we'll have the detonation of the first seismic charge, on the lunar surface. If that occurs we'll interrupt the press briefing to announce the firing of that charge. We'll switch now to the MSC news center and our press briefing.
2122729|CC|America, Houston. We're starting to get to the margin of signal strength to get the data back. We want you to improve that by turning S-BAND MODE - S-BAND NORMAL MODE VOICE switch to OFF, center for about 5 minutes.
2122747|LMP|Say again.
2122750|CC|Okay, Jack. We'd like you to turn the S-BAND NORMAL MODE VOICE switch to OFF, center, for about 5 minutes to improve our signal margin as you approach the termin - the LOS here.
2122807|LMP|Okay. OFF, center, for 5 minutes.
2123404|CC|America, Houston. Don't bother to answer, but we'd like H2 TANK 2 FANS OFF. That's hydrogen tank 2 FANS, OFF.
2123418|CC|America, Houston. We'd like OMNI Bravo. America, Houston. We'd like OMNI Bravo.
2123428|CC|America, Houston, you can turn the voice back on now. Have about a minute and a half to LOS for a final goodbye.
2123440|CMP|Okay. This is America with a goodbye for this pass.
2123445|CC|Okay. I guess the real reason for having you turn the voice switch off there is so the secretaries that are transcribing the air-to-ground here can catch up with Jack.
2123501|LMP|(Laughter) I don't believe it. Yes, I do. Okay. That's all you ever hear from me again.
2123626||BEGIN LUNAR REV 64
2123903|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 212 hours 39 minutes. During our press briefing, we had loss of signal with the Command Module. Also, we'did not have the detonation of the seismic charge. We have about 2 minutes of tape of conversation with the crew before loss of signal. We'll play that back at this time, and, of course, we'll interrupt if we should get the firing of the grenade.
2124054|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've just had a report from ALSEP that one of the bombs went off. We didn't see it on television, but we are beginning to see some seismic activity and we'll switch now on our television monitor to the seismic tracing, let you - let you look at that.
2124201|PAO|No one here in the Control Center observed on the television the detonation of that charge. However, we are planning to replay the tape from that time and see if a close look at the tape shows any -- any activity that we can see on the television camera.
2124422|PAO|This is Apollo Control. It's going to take several minutes before we're ready to rerun the video tape of that time segment when the explosive charge detonated. In the meantime, we'll continue with our tape playback leading up to loss of signal with America on the 63rd revolution.
2124549|PAO|That brings us up to date now with all of the air-to-ground that we've received from the crew up through loss of signal. We'll be reacquiring Apollo 17 in about 36 minutes.
2124844|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The time at which we copied the firing of that first explosive charge was a Ground Elapsed Time of 212 hours 39 minutes 44 seconds, which translates to 6:32:45 Central Standard Time, or rather 5:32:45 Central Standard Time. And, we should be ready shortly to rerun the video tape from that segment of the television. And, again looking very closely to see if the charge explosion is visible on the TV, The charge was placed about 1.1 kilometers from the lunar rover, and it was the 1-pound charge.
2125648|PAO|This is Apollo control at 212 hours 56 minutes. We've had some unexpected activity on the lunar seismic experiment. And the ALSEP controller reports that there is a lot of activity in the ALSEP room looking at the very active seismic tracings that we are getting right now. Some feeling that this may, in fact, represent the detonation of that grenade rather than the previous signal that we recorded. If in fact that is the case we missed it on the television because the television camera was pointed at another area at the time that activity began. And, as soon as we have a further report from ALSEP we'll pass that along to you.
2130211|PAO|This is Apollo Control we've had no further word from the ALSEP Control area as to which of the 2 seismic events we registered at the Apollo 17 site represents the firing of the first charge. However, it is noted that the second event came much closer to the nominal charge firing time.
2130703|PAO|This is Apollo Control, we've concluded, here in the Control Center, that the second seismic event, registered on the Lunar Seismic Profiling Experiment, was, in fact, the one pound explosive charge going off. That occurred, at 212 hours 55 minutes 35 seconds, which was about 4-1/2 minutes later than the nominal or T-0 time. There will be a second charge fired. It is scheduled for 215 hours 27 minutes, that will be a 1/2-pound charge that is located 6/10 of a kilometer from the Lunar Roving Vehicle. We're now some 14 minutes from reacquiring Apollo 17 in its 64th revolution of the Moon. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
2132003|PAO|This is Apollo control at 213 hours 20 minutes. We're standing by now to reacquire Apollo 17 in its 64th revolution of the Moon. And we expect this at least from the crew work point of view to be a relatively quiet period. During this revolution they are scheduled to begin their eat period. And they will be operating some of the scientific instruments in the scientific instrument module bay the SIM bay. But, relatively little scheduled in the flight plan during this period of time. We show the spacecraft in an orbit of 65.3 nautical miles at its high point, and a low point or pericynthion of 62.4 nautical miles. And, we should have acquisition of signal any second now.
2132125|PAO|And we've had acquisition of signal. And, it will take a second before we get good solid lock up.
2132155|CC|Yes.
2132210|LMP|Hey, Ron, do you want me?
2132228|CMP|That's right. There are a lot of those with a flat floor. Got to be a lava-type thing down there.
2132246|PAO|And we've got a good solid signal now from the spacecraft - good data. Hearing Ron Evans in the background. Ron apparently has his mike in the so called VOX mode where it's triggered by his voice.
2132307|CMP|Houston, America.
2132308|CC|Roger, America. Hello once again. You've got about 1 minute to T-stop.
2132316|CDR|Okay. We're right with you, Gordy.
2132317|CMP|Okay. T-stop isn't it - -
2132322|CDR|... 24:20, Ron.
2132323|CMP|24:20?
2132324|CDR|... operation STANDBY.
2132328|CMP|Standby. Okay.
2132345|CMP|Okay. We're coming up on 24:20. The visual of Tsiolkovsky is hopefully pretty much recorded on the recorder.
2132358|CC|Roger.
2132409|CMP|18, 19.
2132411|CMP|MARK it - STANDBY. ... in standby. I guess the somewhat - a very small summary, anyhow, of the visual of Tsiolkovsky concentrating primarily or. the flow up in the northeast corner. To me, that particular piece that's fallen down in the crater there - and it's on one of the pictures - Tsiolkovsky, 4 or 5. The piece that is down in the crater is on the right-hand side of the page. And that portion, you know, is somewhat of a molten state. It looks like it is a landslide that has slid down the wall of the crater and detached from the - well, the molten state of material, rough - rough-looking material that's on the rim of the crater Tsiolkovsky.
2132538|CC|Roger, Ron.
2132546|CMP|There seems to be high lava marks around the western and northern sides of the central peak. For some reason, it's not evident or visible on the south side of the central peak.
2132606|CC|Okay.
2132608|CMP|Also, there seems to be the high lava marks on the raised portion of the floor in the contact between the dark material of the floor and the lighter - oh, rough-looking ... - on the northern side of the crater. In the first observation, of the mass of material that goes out into the crater Fermi, the - it looks like there is a whole bunch of craters in there that have - or are essentially rimless craters. However, on close examination with the binocs, I couldn't see any that didn't have at least a slight indication of a rim. The rims that were on them were essentially very subdued. They extended out to about - oh, a half a crater diameter; and these are on the craters in the 500 - to 1000-meter size. I didn't get a chance to look at them, looking straight down the craters, to see if there was any depressions or any domes or any type of a structure in the bottom of craters. But I get the impression that they're - primarily all look - just of cones with no flat bottoms at all. And I'll look again at those things when we go by there next time. The flow that goes down into Waterman - if we look at the pictures, Tsiolkovsky 5 of 5 - the shadow is just about in the same area on this one as it is on that one, and I didn't take a chance to look in that one until I got to the west of it. So I'll have to look when I'm passing it from the north side of Tsiolkovsky looking south, to see what's down in the shadow area there. But when you're on the west looking back across it, you can't see into the shadow. But the material that's in the floor of the crater Waterman is the same type of material that the little flow on the northeast corner has broken off and slid down into its own little crater.
2132909|CC|Okay. Roger that.
2132911|CMP|So I guess what I'm saying is that essentially whatever molten material that's up around on the rim of the crater Tsiolkovsky has been - well, I want to say extruded - not extruded but pushed out, I guess, away from the crater end has been in a semiliquid or semi-molten state in its period of deposition. I'll reserve judgement on some of the flat-floored, flat-mare filled depressions that are around the crater until I get a chance to look at those the next time around.
2133006|CC|Okay.
2133035|CDR|Say, Gordy, something that struck me, - something maybe everyone else has thought about, but I hadn't before. At the southeast corner of Smythii, there was a relatively large - several large somewhat subdued craters but with relatively steep sides to them. And next to this one was a very small, white, bright-haloed crater. And I watched the rays of this crater; and the southeastern rays draped over the slopes of this much larger subdued crater - draped over the walls, all the way down onto the floor. And as they draped over the walls, they obviously gave me a very good albedo change from the darker wall to the very much lighter colored. But as they hit the floor of the crater, they form patterns that are not only not unlike, but actually very, very similar, to the light-mantled area that we have been referring to as a possible slide, back at Taurus-Littrow. The patterns as they drape down the inner slopes of the crater and onto the floor, I would be willing to bet if we went down there we'd probably find the same type of things we found at Taurus-Littrow.
2133211|CC|Okay.
2133211|CDR|By that I mean albedo changes that we can see here versus to what we can see down there.
2133217|CC|Roger. Very interesting.
2133218|CDR|I looked for these type of - looked for these type of ray patterns, where the rays just went out on a more horizontal plane. You can - you can find them if you look hard, but as they drape over the slopes and onto the more level floor, they're very obviously alike.
2133245|CC|Roger.
2133257|CMP|Hey, Houston.
2133302|CC|Go ahead.
2133303|CMP|Okay. That crater, if you look at Smythii 1 of 1, and the crater that's right above the rev 62 there, you can see a bright spot on the northwest portion there. And that's the breach zone of that particular crater. The thing that's intriguing about that to me is that if you look at the inner ring, it's a gradual slope from the center - the center of the crater is lower than the secondary - the secondary ring around the thing.
2133343|CC|Ron, let me interrupt here. Say again which crater you're looking at again in Smythii.
2133351|CMP|Okay, in Smythii. And - Mare Smythii, 1 of 1, that - that picture - -
2133359|CC|Roger. I - have got it.
2133400|CMP|And right about where it says rev 62. Okay?
2133404|CC|Okay; gotcha.
2133404|CMP|Now, there's two - there's two rings in that picture. Okay. The inner ring, the central portion of that thing, is lower and slopes outward - radially outward - to the first ring. And then it drops off; in other words, it's a gradual slope, maybe - oh, somewhere in the 15 to 20 degree slope upward to the first ring. And then it's a steep slope on the outside of the ring, at about, oh, 45 degrees, dropping down into the annulus.
2133448|CC|Okay.
2133505|CMP|Yes, color? With 250 lens. Yes, all along. I just took it today, two of them, - three of them. Yes. Yes. Yes. I took three of them the last rev.
2133605|LMP|Gordy, this is the LMP. While we're waiting for the site to come up again here, which seems to interest us every time we go over it, I think we sort of came to a general concensus on the problem of the smaller cone-shaped craters on the far side that have the little pool-like concentrations of material in the bottom. If you look at the freshest of those craters, the - that seems to be contiguous with the streaks of very dark material that cover the walls and the rim of the fresh cone-shaped craters. As the crater gets older, that material - that distinction becomes less obvious; however, the pool remains, and all you lose is the dark streaks on the rim and on the walls of the crater. I think we sort of feel - suspect that that pool in the bottom of the fresh craters is just the concentrated impact melt that - some of which is - stayed there during the impact and other which drained back - that drained back after the impact from the - drained from the walls. And then, with time, that pool maybe subdued some. The structures in it, the swirls and little domes in that pool are subdued possibly not only by the impact but by debris, slides, and avalanches off the walls of the crater.
2133758|CC|Okay, Jack.
2133758|LMP|It seems to be a very consistent pattern when you start piecing several of them together.
2133805|CC|Roger.
2133831|LMP|That black streaking on the walls and the blankets, - Ron may have already told you, but it is characteristic of only the very freshest of those cone-shaped craters, - and - or pool craters, whichever you want to call them. And it seems to be very logical that it just represents a thin veneer on the rim and the walls of the impact-generated glass. And it's darkest, presumably, where it's quenched; and the pool itself is somewhat lighter gray than the black, streaks and mantles.
2133911|CC|Roger.
2133926|CMP|You know, Jack, I get the impression that these bright ones, - see the bright one right down there in front of us there, - if you look at those with the binocs or with the - I get the impression of a dark greenish-black or blackish-green. In other words, I get a green - -
2133944|LMP|Green cast to the rocks?
2133944|CMP|Yes, green cast to the rocks. To the big blocks, you know, that are laying around there - around the crater and also the ones that are down - down in the bottom.
2133954|SC|Greenish cast.
2133954|CMP|That greenish cast to them.
2134011|CMP|Yes, it is; isn't it. I can see that with the naked eye. That's a bright one. What's - I'm saying, where is the crater, though? Oh, that's the - that's Yerkes and - okay. You're in VOX.
2134035|LMP|Hey, Gordy, we got another orange-rimmed crater. And we'll spot it. I think everybody agrees. And this one very clearly looks like an impact crater that has it's - let's see, we decided you're looking north?
2134052|CMP|Yes.
2134052|CC|Roger.
2134052|LMP|It's north, east, and west quadrants - -
2134102|CMP|Let me describe it. It's Yerkes and ...
2134104|CC|Hey, you got; the T-start time coming up here shortly on the sounder.
2134111|CMP|Okay (laughter).
2134112|CC|About 10 seconds.
2134113|LMP|Quit interrupting. Okay. We'll get it.
2134115|CMP|What time is it?
2134118|LMP|We'll hack it up here, Gordy.
2134120|CMP|VERB 41 ...
2134121|LMP|Thanks, Gordy.
2134121|CC|... now.
2134123|CMP|Okay.
2134124|LMP|Sounder is OPERATE.
2134126|CC|That was close.
2134130|CMP|(Laughter)
2134130|CDR|That was a very good call. Thank you.
2134132|CMP|Thank you.
2134132|LMP|No sweat. At any rate, in the north, east and west quadrants of that little crater - and we'll spot it for you on the map, is a - very clearly an orange pattern - an orange color to the ejecta. The other quadrant is a lighter color - a light gray.
2134153|CC|Okay.
2134208|CMP|If I had a map. Let's see, what did I do with my map? Wait a minute; I got a picture of that, I think.
2134238|LMP|Right here.
2134243|CMP|No, go ahead I can't see the landing sight anyhow, I don't think.
2134323|LMP|Gordy, my impression from Shorty the other day, and also from seeing these craters that seem to have orange - that are - around them, that look very much like impact craters from orbit, at any rate - it may be that the - if that is an alteration phenomenon, - that it's being localized around the structure created by the impact. But in this latter case, it looks as if the impact itself penetrated into a zone of that color.
2134406|CC|Okay, Jack.
2134428|CMP|(Laughter) yes.
2134514|CMP|Are we going to use your -
2134531|CMP|Here, take it - take a look at it. Okay.
2134551|CMP|Doesn't show up that way today.
2134618|CMP|Here. The color -
2134710|CMP|Uh oh. That's the spot.
2134716|CMP|Yes.
2134756|CMP|Can't see it anymore.
2134943|CMP|Yes. That's a good view ...
2134956|CMP|They're between Tacquet and Mel-Mel-Melanes [sic], aren't they? Yes. I see them ... Okay. Yes, little bitty ones. They're about - a little bit bigger than Shorty. Yes. Those are - those are the ones that I called the other day. It was a very, very light tan. I guess you can put an orange tint to them.
2135154|LMP|Gordy, to put orange into perspective, at least as far as the LMPs eyes are concerned - from orbit, I would say that it's a orange-gray. It's still a gray, with an orange hue to it. And when I use any blue or tan or anything, it's a hue on gray; and I'll usually try to say gray in there. But to say something's orange, I think, would be misleading. It's really an orange-gray, but it's clearly a distinct hue.
2135229|CC|Okay. Kind of like dirty beach sand with a little orange in it, huh?
2135238|LMP|Well, we can't use that term anymore. That's copyrighted.
2135243|CC|Roger.
2135308|CMP|Yes. That's right. There is. That's the one. That's the area where I was trying to talk about. That's just north of, - oh, that's Sulpicius Gallus. No, there's a gouge, just - yes, northwest of Sulpicius Gallus Crater. Yes, bet I didn't doubt - I didn't talk about that thing. That's a - I thought - I was talking about the little orange crater. Now you can see all the colors down - down in the gouge itself.
2135343|LMP|Hey, Ron. We'll spot this one on the map, too - or Gordy. But there's a large gouge just south of the Sulpicius Gallus ridge. The gouge, - it's a rimless depression - and streaming down from the upper portion of that depression are not only our old friend the orange-grays, but some would be a red-brown gray. Very, very clear coloration in this light, in, - I think, - My goodness. There's another crater we'll have to look, at.
2135418|CMP|Yes. There's a whole bunch of them down there.
2135419|LMP|Yes, but that's something in the wall of it in that area. Yes, it's starting - (chuckle) Man, we're seeing an orange Moon now. This - this whole dark mantle in here around Sulpicius Gallus, - they are - they are scattered craters with variety of orange to red-brown hues. And they all, except for that large rimless depression, which looked, - looked as if was exposing some layers which were streaming those color, - that color debris down its walls - All the other craters seem to be small impacts that apparently are penetrating just far enough into the dark mantle material to tap this zone of orange to red-brown materials.
2135518|CMP|And just north of that elongate depression, there is another circular crater. And it also is penetrating down though this mantle stuff. And it had the reds and the browns and oranges dipping down it, too.
2135537|CDR|Hey, Gordy, just so you're fully aware we're not sort of just leaning and getting color blind up here, I tell you last one Jack was talking about was not even subtle. It's entire ray pattern was this same ... material and definite contact between it and the dark material around it and it had that orange brown hue to it without any question at all.
2135606|CC|Okay. Very interesting.
2135611|CDR|It really is. You know I saw that dirt day before yesterday at Littrow, but, and I really haven't seen too much from orbit that I'd call really very distinct in color, until this one. But, boy, there's no question about this one.
2135630|CC|Roger.
2135635|CDR|And we will pick up the lunar sounder at 59.54.
2135709|CC|Okay, I'll try to watch it a little and give you a little more warning, too.
2135733|CMP|Yes, I want to get - I think it's right in that ...
2135741|CMP|Let me see.
2135745|CMP|No, here's the Sulpicius Gallus. No, you're up too far, you're up too far. It's closer to Sulpicius Gallus. Right in that ridge basin, right in there on the red line.
2135800|CMP|And, we'll get a picture of it.
2135806|CMP|Yes.
2135814|CMP|Yes.
2135906|CMP|Okay. Sorry, Houston, we turned that one OFF at the - minute early.
2135915|CC|Okay.
2135923|CMP|We'll pick up an extra minute on the next one.
2135927|CC|Roger.
2140001|LMP|Okay, Houston. RECORDER'S going OFF.
2140004|CC|Okay.
2140008|CDR|Hey, Gordo. I better make this note now. What Jack and Ron were talking about apparently was an elongated depression. I was talking about in the same area, and I'm trying to mark it approximately on the chart. But it was a classic, small, bright-haloed crater. The classic with a classic ejecta and everything. Except it was this orange-hued crater. It was not bright-white. But it was very classic. And, as I said earlier, not subtle at all.
2140046|CC|Roger, Gene.
2140112|CC|America, Houston. I have a TEI for rev 72 pad. No hurry, maybe you want to wait until sunset.
2140125|CMP|Yes, we'll wait until sunset. Okay?
2140128|CC|Okay.
2140323|CMP|Houston, 160 and 162 of the mag Oscar Oscar were taken from the north, viewing the central peaks of Copernicus.
2140334|CC|Okay, Ron.
2140341|CMP|It's a long ways away. I don't know if it'll show up or not. It might.
2140714|CDR|Houston, this is America.
2140717|CC|Go ahead.
2140721|CDR|Okay, Gordo. I'm looking ahead - I'm trying to stay ahead and see what's happening today and tomorrow in the Flight Plan. And although this has come up in the past, we haven't said anything about it. You know, Ron put his biomed harness on a couple of hours ago, and he's going to end up wearing it a total of 6 hours. Then, all of a sudden, when we make a change-over again, and I put it on, and - for a 12-hour period, and then we change again. And one of the problems up here is putting these things on, and you'd like not to leave them on too long, but once you get them on, you like to make use of them. And it's a problem, it's time consuming. I'd like you to consider down there letting Ron wear those until tomorrow morning, having me change over then. And when EVA time comes, we'll take special consideration to whatever requirements there are.
2140817|CC|Hey, you just got a thumbs-up on that from the Surgeon.
2140822|CDR|Okay, very good thank you.
2140841|CMP|Okay, Houston. Just took whatever the three were before 39 on mag Yankee Yankee of Euler, Tobias Mayer, terminator stuff.
2140900|CC|Okay, Ron. And for Jack, the Surgeon says he's getting occasional erratic trace from Jack's biomed. He would be happy if Jack wants to take it clear off.
2140920|LMP|Gordy, I don't know how to tell you this, but I haven't had my biomed on for about 6 hours.
2140932|CC|Okay.
2140933|LMP|As a matter of fact, I haven't even had the sensors on.
2140939||Well, we must be copying the heartbeat of the America or something, then.
2140952|LMP|How does it look? Maybe we ought to use it instead of mine.
2141002|CC|America's ticker is doing fine - along with everything else.
2141015|CDR|Okay, Houston. This is America. I've a Flight Plan change for you if you're ready to copy.
2141022|CC|Okay, ready to copy.
2141028|CDR|Okay, if you'll turn to page 3-26 at 217:52.
2141037|CC|Okay, go ahead.
2141039|CDR|You can delete - you can delete both those steps.
2141045|CC|Okay. I've got that.
2141049|CDR|Okay. If you'll turn to 230:40 - you can cross out LMP and put CDR.
2141104|CC|Okay. We got that.
2141109|CDR|Okay, if you'll turn the page - or turn to 230:29.
2141113|CC|Okay.
2141116|CMP|You can change the first line, cross out LMP and put CDR. And on the second line, you can cross out CDR and put CMP.
2141128|CC|Okay, I must be on the wrong page. Did you say 230:29? Must be 231:29, okay, got you.
2141138|CDR|231:29. Cross out LMP and put CDR on the first line. Cross out CDR and put CMP.
2141146|CC|All right.
2141150|CMP|Okay, and we'll further update you as the mission progresses. I know you're pretty busy, and we'll hold any Flight Plan updates down to you to a minimum from here.
2141201|CC|Okay.
2141536|LMP|Okay, Gordy. You want to give me TEI pad?
2141541|CC|There's nothing I'd rather do. Ready to copy?
2141546|LMP|Go ahead.
2141547|CC|Okay. It's TEI for 72, SPS/G&N; 36477; plus 0.61, plus 0.83; NOUN 33 is 230:42:59.17; NOUN 81, plus 2887.4, minus 0339.4, minus 0050.3; 179, 095, 356; rest of the pad is N/A. GDC stars Sirius and ;Rigel; 136; 160; 034. Ullage is 4 jets, 12 seconds. Remarks: Assumes ascent REFSMMAT. Over.
2141719|LMP|Okay. TEI, 72, SPS/G&N; 36477; plus 0.61, plus 0.83; 230:42:59.17; plus 2887.4, minus 0339; minus 0050.3; 179, 095, 356; Sirius and Rigel; 136; 160; 034. Ullage is 4 jets, for 12 seconds, and it assumes an ascent REFSMMAT. Over.
2141803|CC|Okay. That's a good read-back. Say, have a little summary of both the surface and the orbital scientific equipment's working. It's probably about 5 minutes worth. If there's some handy time, I'll be glad to read it to you.
2141825|CDR|Right now, Gordo. We'd love to hear it.
2141829|CC|Okay. Let me start with the America's gear there. The - on the UV spectrometer, well, actually having to do with UV. During - back during rev 38, they sent an Aerobee sounding rocket from White Sands, up, and it carried a UV spectrometer above the atmosphere and successfully acquired solar UV calibration data. Farside terminator shows there is a hydrogen atmosphere, but it is much less than had been predicted. The PI is very happy with the mode 4 maneuver. On the IR scanning radiometer, it's still performing beautifully, and the PI is getting lots of high-quality data, and I understand is ecstatic about it. On rev 33, the crater Kepler C showed up as a 132-degree Kelvin anomaly on a 94 degree Kelvin background after 11.6 days of lunar night, the crater Reiner was a similar anomaly on that revolution. In low orbit on rev 9, Kepler A showed a broad hotspot corresponding to its ejecta blanket with a sharp spike corresponding to the crater in the center. One coldspot anomaly seems to correspond to a cinder cone-like feature in Mare Orientale near the crater Hohmann. On the lunar sounder, telemetry monitoring of the sounder's average reflected power indicates that the mare and highlands exhibit markedly different reflectivity, both HF and VHF. The data is consistent with distinct layering in the mare, as would be expected, where the mare flooded by successive layers of lava, although, they say other explanations are possible. They don't see that layering indication in the highlands. Predicted topographic signatures over features such as craters and mare ridges have been confirmed in principal. Of course, as you know, until they get the film back they don't have - they can't really reach any definite conclusions. On the cameras - the cameras, both cameras and the laser altimeter all appear to be performing very well. And everybody's especially happy with the solid laser altimeter performance. Okay, that kind of sums up SIM bay. Do you have any questions, that I could chase down, or should I go on with surface stuff?
2142131|CDR|No, why don't you press on.
2142132|CMP|That sounds good Gordo, press on.
2142136|CC|Okay. On the surface, the heat flow. These are - these are little short summaries, each written by the Pis or co-Is (sic) on each experiment. Mark reports that the entire heat flow system is working perfectly. The probes have cooled down to a temperature of -16 degrees C at a depth of 2.3 meters, and are nearly at their final temperature. For comparison, at Hadley Rille, we found a -20 degree C at 1.5 meters depth, we had, to refresh your memory, was -16 at 2.3. Both probes show an increase of temperature with depth, and it is clear that we will get a valid heat flow measurement. The LEAM is functioning properly, responding to calibration, and sensors show a low noise figure. The LEAM will be off until lunar afternoon, and on, with sensors covered, until after sunset. Otto Berg ask that you accept his thanks and appreciation. On the LSG, the sensor beam cannot be nulled at this time, in spite of Jack's efforts. We are still studying the problem and hope to find a workaround. In any case, the instrument does function to some extent, as a vertical seismometer, and may be useful in a search for a gravitational radiatior from pulsars. The LSPE is fully operational. LM ascent clearly recorded on all four geophones. And apparent seismic velocity measured across the geophone array was 110 meters-per-second. Regolith velocity was very close to that measure at the Apollo 16 site. The LM impact was clearly recorded on the geophones, and the estimated distance was 10 kilometers away, in the South Massif, actually very close to the targeted point. Although, I guess you've discussed this, we didn't see it on the video. The first charge went off while you were on the backside, last rev, and it's very apparent on the tracers which I'm monitoring right now. I think the next one's due sometime within the next 2 hours.
2142402|CC|Okay, the lunar mass spectrometer, the low voltage circuits of the LMS have been operated briefly. All monitors indicate the proper performance of the instuments, but application of high voltages will await lunar sunset, when both the analyzer and the site has had time to outgas. Temperature of the radiator plate is slightly above nominal, but not so high as to be even important. That was from Dick Hodges. Okay, here's a little summary from Dave Strangway on the SEP. He starts out by saying, "Water, water everywhere and plenty to be found," because you didn't get behind the timeline. The SEP transmitter was confirmed to be working well at the correct power level, using the lunar sounder. The receiver heated well above predictions during the whole mission, as I'm sure you are aware, but the two prime data legs were operated within the temperature limits of the recorder, and we have no reason to doubt that we got good data. There is also a good chance that the leg from Station 4 to the LM was within the temperature limits. Your procedures were performed excellently and we look forward to processing the DSEA tape.
2142525|CC|Okay, now to - let's see, we got the TGE, which is considered a spectacular success. The Earth-Moon gravity transfer indicates a value of - won't read the numbers, in milligals - at the - at the Tarrus-Littrow base. But the value will be used to obtain a revised value for the lunar radius at this landing site. Gravity measurement made during the three EVAs showed a large negative anomaly of about minus 38 milligals at the base of the South Massif. A similar negative anomaly of about minus 30 at the base of the North Massif. Preliminary conclusions of the traverse gravimeter meas - TGE measurements indicate that the material under the valley floor of Tarrus-Littrow is much denser than that of the North and South Massif. The gravity values will support the hypothesis that the valley subfloor consist of dense basaltic rocks, perhaps as much as 3 or 4 kilometers in thickness. The extra measurement between stations 2 and 3 will be of great help in determining the nature of the boundaries of this basaltic layer and the varied extension of the massif.
2142642|CC|The cosmic ray detector - actually, you know as much as we do about the data return from it, of course, but the - we did - recover it early in EVA 3, as you remember, and that was due to a minor increase in low-energy solar protons and heavier particles detected here. And a reduced exposure will not offset the scientific results.
2142713|CC|The neutron probe was exposed to the surface for 49 hours. PI estimates that the distance from the RTG to the probe is 40 meters, which will mean that the background count will be low, and he thanks you kindly for those few extra steps. And the last one was - to be summarized - was the field geology and they asked for a very short summary, so Walt Berger came through with three typewritten pages. So, we're just going to skip the whole thing, except the last line, which was to say that you guys did an outstanding job. Over.
2142801|CDR|Thank you Gordy. We're just pleased that so many things are working well, and happy that the PIs are satisfied. That was our objective, and we came up here to meet it - and those things that are done, I hope we met it well, and we've get a few more things to do yet.
2142824|CC|Well, I can assure you you're not the only or.ci, that are pleased.
2142828|CDR|Gordy - Gordy, and you know it's satisfying to have put that much time in and - and come out with some meaningful results. That makes us all feel good. Have you been able, or did you see that first charge on the video?
2142848|CC|I forgot to mention that. No, we sure didn't see a thing. We had the camera aimed over there, but it was almost a kilometer away. That was 1-pound charge, and we played it back several times, but nobody saw a hint of anything.
2142907|CDR|Okay. If you got - if you got a few more going off here in short order don't you?
2142915|CC|That's affirmative. I don't think we're up to the next one yet, but we'll keep - keep you posted on whether we see anything, or how they're doing.
2142927|CDR|I might also say that we appreciate the time and effort the PIs put in with their experiments and with us also.
2142937|CC|Okay. I'll make sure that gets to the backroom.
2143008|LMP|Gordy, this is Jack. What did they see over next to the Sculptured Hills on the gravimeter?
2143017|CC|Well let's see, Jack. They kind of - let me turn back here. They actually included - when they mentioned the negative anomaly of minus 30 milligals at the base of the North Massif. They said stations 6 and 8, parenthetically there. So evidently they're including the whole area there as the negative anomaly. I'll try to get a more amplified answer to your question.
2143058|LMP|Now, could you see if you can verify with them that they were unable to - or there was no distinction between the measurements of the Sculptured Hills and the North Massif?
2143114|CC|Yes. I'll - I'll work on that.
2143123|LMP|Or better yet, what was the distinction between the Sculptured Hills and the subfloor area?
2143129|CC|Okay.
2143141|CC|You may have to wait until next time around for your answer.
2143148|LMP|Oh, there's no hurry. You can wait until tomorrow or even a (laughter) week if you want to. I was just thinking about that problem.
2143156|CC|Okay.
2143206|LMP|By the way, Gordy, you might tell Bob Walker, if he's around, that the cosmic ray, as far as I know, was untouched by human hands, at least on the Moon. And it looked very very clean when I put it in the - put it back together.
2143224|CC|Okay, Jack. We'll pass that along.
2143318|CC|America, Houston. One more question from the Surgeon on this mysterious trace on the LMPs biomed. Do you have anything plugged in to the - is the biomed still plugged in and laying over on Jack's umbilical, or is there, is there anything plugged in to - to Jack's that could explain the funny trace here? It's kind of a sporadic-looking - looks like somebody with a heart in a pretty bad shape. (Laughter) Over.
2143403|LMP|Gordy, my heart has always been in bad shape, for other reasons than the one the Surgeon's thinking about. It turns out that I am still plugged together. I just don't have the sensors on. I will remedy that situation, so he doesn't have to worry anymore.
2143421|CC|Okay, that solves the mystery. Thank you.
2143521|CC|Say, America, about 30 seconds to LOS. See you next time.
2143529|CDR|Okay, Gordy. Thank you very much, and we'll see you coming around.
2143532|CC|Okay.
2143549||BEGIN LUNAR REV 65
2143601|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 214 hours 36 minutes and we've had loss of signal now with America on the 64th revolution of the Moon. Be reacquiring in a little less than 45 minutes. And coming up at about 215 hours 27 minutes, a little less than 1 hour from now, we're scheduled to have the second detonation of an explosive charge on the lunar surface as part of the lunar seismic profiling experiment. This charge will be a one-half pound charge located about six tenths of a kilometer from the Lunar Roving Vehicle. The summary of science information read up to the crew by our CAPCOM Gordon Fullerton will be available in the News Center. We hope to get copies of the information read up to the crew to the News Center and reproduced and available. It will of course also be available on the transcript somewhat later. At 214 hours 37 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
2145601|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 214 hours 56 minutes. In about one minute we'll be commanding the television on the lunar roving vehicle ON and we'll have it positioned to look for this second explosive charge which is going to be fired at about 215 hours and 27 minutes. This charge is part of the lunar seismic profiling experiment. It is a one-half pound charge of explosives located about six-tenths of a kilometer southeast of the lunar roving vehicle. And we've got black and white TV now from lunar surface and we'll have that through the converter and up on the area where that charge is located. And the instrumentation communications engineer will be putting that camera in the proper position.
2150054|PAO|We're about 27 minutes away from the predicted time of detonation. However, we are within the window during which the charge could explode. As we mentioned on the previous charge, this window is brought about by the fact that the timer is a mechanical timer, the firing charge is set continuously during the window and as the timer moves across the face of the firing pin, the firing charge going in - the firing command going in continuously fires the charge as the window moves across the pin.
2150329|PAO|And we believe the television camera is now centered on the area where this charge is located. Hopefully the charge is right in the middle of the television screen.
2150701|PAO|We now have a clock configured here in the Control Centre, counting down to what our best estimate is for detonation of the seismic charge. And our T0 time is about 20 minutes away, 20 minutes 17 seconds to be exact. This is the clock that's designated H/O on the video monitors.
2151920|PAO|This is Apollo Control, we're now about 1 minute 20 seconds away from reacquiring Apollo 17. It will be on the 65th revolution. And, we're looking through the lunar rover television camera at the spot on the Moon where we believe the second of two seismic charges to be detonated, is located. We do have a problem with the TV camera in that it appears to be heating up close to the acceptable limit and it could become necessary to shut the camera down prior to the time we have the detonation. This decision will be based in part on what sort of priorities the scientists have for other things they would like to view with the camera in relation to the detonation of this charge. And the instrumentation communications engineer, keeping a close eye on those temperature readings, reports that the temperature has apparently begun to stablize and to maybe even move down a bit, so we maybe out of the woods on that score.
2152102|PAO|And we have acquisition of signal. Should get a good stable lock on shortly which will decrease the noise on the air-to-ground circuit.
2152134|CMP|Houston, America.
2152154|CC|Hello, America. Do you read Houston?
2152234|CMP|Houston, America.
2152235|CC|Yes, America, loud and clear.
2152241|CMP|Okay, Houston. America here. The mapper - when we took the image motion from OFF to ON and then the MAPPING CAMERA switch from OFF to ON also, I think - maybe it was STANDBY to ON - but anyhow, as soon as it went up to ON, we had a barberpole on the talkback. Went back to STANDBY, and just before AOS, or just about AOS there, at 215:20, about 215:20, then we got a gray on the talkback with the MAPPING CAMERA switch to STANDBY. Then we went back through the cycle, and it worked okay. So it's working now and it's ON. What I'm saying is I didn't start working until about 20.
2152338|CC|Okay, Ron. We got that.
2152345|CMP|Must have been too cold, huh?
2152350|CC|We'll look at it. Don't know.
2152402|CC|America, would you select WIDE on the HIGH GAIN and then NARROW?
2152426|CMP|Doesn't seem to make any difference. I'll try a REACQ position again. MANUAL - and WIDE.
2152453|CMP|AUTO or NARROW, it doesn't seem to be working very good.
2152500|CC|Let's try REACQ, Ron. You're in a skin reflection zone there, is probably the problem.
2152546|PAO|And, we just had a call from our Instrumentation Communications Engineer that he saw the charge blow down in the lower left corner of the television screen, and simultaneous with that, we're getting very active response from the seismic experiment, the tracing pens are very - very active, almost going wild at this point.
2152703|PAO|And, the scientists in the back room here also confirm having seen the charge explode. We'll be re-rolling the tapes - rewinding the tape and playing back the video tape of that detonation.
2152759|LMP|Gordy. This is the LMP. How do you read?
2152802|CC|Jack, you're loud and clear.
2152807|LMP|Okay. Add to that little discussion of the Pool-bottomed, cone-shaped craters that I had, I think, the last rev, that the one place there seems to be some variety in the freshest of those kinds of craters is in Mare Smythii where the ejecta blanket of many of those kind of craters has some small dark halo craters on them - have small dark halo craters on them. Three or four, or half a dozen per crater, on occasion. But that seems to be something I've only seen so far in the Mare Smithii region.
2152905|CC|Roger.
2152914|LMP|They're superimposed on the bright ray or ejecta blanket and/or ejecta blanket system of the - of those cone, or fresh cone craters.
2152930|CC|Okay.
2153013|CC|America, Houston. We've got some words for you to - a request for a little visual observation at the landing site area, having to do with orange material. If you're ready for about a 5-minute briefing, I'd like to give it to you now, so you can get set up.
2153040|CMP|Okay; go ahead there, Gordo.
2153043|CC|Okay, what we want to do is see if - This was triggered off by your observation of orange material last rev, I guess, and possibly earlier. But the idea here is to look for some craters that we've identified on photographs that are in a similar geologic setting to Shorty Crater and see if we can see orange material around them. We're trying to determine if the orange material at Shorty is a one-time special occasion or whether possibly it's common to the area and just never been noticed before. And we think you'll be able to determine this visually, better than any other way. So, if you can get out the orbit - the orbit charts; the orbit photographs; let's see, the Lunar Landmark Maps for the CSM, and turn to the landing site number 2 of 4 picture. Let me know when you get that, and I'll show you where we think a likely point is to see craters that are similar in setting to Shorty, to look for orange material.
2153203|LMP|Okay, Gordy, we'll do that. I've made a couple passes with the binoculars over the dark mantle around Littrow already, and have seen nothing comparable with what's around Sulpicius; but let's have the examples, and we'll make a special effort on it.
2153219|CC|Okay. Have you got the site photo number 2 of 4?
2153222|LMP|Here it is. Stand by just 1.
2153254|LMP|Tab on it.
2153255|CMP|Which one is that, Gordo?
2153256|LMP|204.
2153258|CC|No. Number 2 of 4 of the site photos.
2153303|LMP|Oh, 2 of 4. Okay. Okay, we got her.
2153326|CC|Okay. You can see the landing site there at - down about 4 o'clock, and - -
2153333|LMP|Yes sir. Go.
2153334|CC|- - the 7-kilometer crater in the - on the centerline of the page, about a third of the way down from the top, the large bright crater there is - is Littrow B is the name of it.
2153346|CDR|Got it.
2153347|CC|And on the southern half of the ejecta blanket from that crater, there are several dark halo craters, which we think are in similar structure as Shorty. We think that would be a likely spot to look for orange material. There's a - Farouk has circled about four or five. They show up, say, at 4 o'clock, 7 o'clock, 8 o'clock, and 9 o'clock out about - from the center - about a crater diameter. In other words, a crater radius beyond the lip, roughly. We suggest that you utilize the best window in your attitude which you should be maneuvering to now, if you - if I haven't completely interrupted the Flight Plan. is - at that attitude, window - let's see - 1 is the best, and 4 should point up that way also. We suggest you get somebody on the binoculars at 1. And use the same camera setup, with the exception of using tbs 250-millimeter lens, if you can, that you're going to be setting up for as per the Flight Plan for the orbital science photos. If you can put the 250 on there; use KK as shown; and f/8, 1/250, and infinity - I'll repeat that when you get to it - for the pictures, if you see anything. What we're looking for is orange material.
2153535|LMP|Okay, Gordy. We're working on that now, and we'll get KK out.
2153539|CC|Okay. We were thinking you might be able to get the guy on the camera in window 4 and the binoculars in window 1.
2153604|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're about ready to replay now the video tape showing that second seismic charge detonating. You'll see it down in the lower left corner of the screen. It'll appear as a bright flash, with little or no dust visible.
2153607|LMP|We're coming up on the edge of Crisium now.
2153608|CC|Roger.
2153617|LMP|Okay. I think maybe you're right about window 4 possibly being the photography window. If I can get oriented right. I thought you - No, There you go. Yes. It's all set, right here. And, Gordy, I'm going to try to also shoot, if you'll let me, two pictures on KK of that depression - colorful depression we saw near Sulpicius Gallus, if I can see it. Is that okay?
2153656|CC|Okay. I'll give you a unilateral GO on those two frames, and we suggest you use two or three frames on this area we've been talking about, also, in addition to the scheduled 28.
2153709|LMP|Okay.
2153711|CC|If we get short of film or something, Farouk says the last part of this orbital science photos, after you get to the end of the run and change to 1/125 of a second, is kind of marginal for photography anyway.
2153726|CMP|(Laughter) Right,
2153744|LMP|Okay, Gordy, you want the pictures whether we think we see orange or not, huh?
2153751|CC|That's affirmative.
2153758|LMP|That's very strange. May have to pass you the camera in a hurry, Geno. I looked.
2153833|LMP|You know, Gordy, the craters we're seeing around Sulpicius that are orange or - orangish are very clearly orange - orangish gray and the whole, or at least most of the crater is that way. We looked at Shorty today, and Ron said that even the little bit of orange that he saw the other day is not visible, and I'd have to agree with that. The amount of orange we saw on the surface certainly would not be comparable to what we're seeing around Sulpicius Gallus.
2153909|CC|Roger.
2153914|LMP|And in a couple of quick scans, on previous revs, of the area, the dark mantle, near Littrow, I could not - I did not notice any obvious orange-gray craters.
2153929|CC|Okay.
2153943|CC|Just to make - to be sure we're clear on this: We suggest that area to look for them only as a likely spot; but any evidence of craters with orange material, in the whole dark-mantle area around Littrow and the edge of Tranquillity there, is worth noting and getting a picture of, if you see it.
2154016|LMP|Okay. Yes.
2154631|CMP|I don't think there's anything there.
2154632|LMP|Why don't you take a couple of pictures, then.
2154635|CMP|... Yes, I've got a few.
2154641|CDR|Can you take a picture?
2154642|CMP|Yes.
2154644|CDR|Did he take a picture ...?
2154649|CMP|Okay. 5.6 at 1/250.
2154723|CMP|No, I don't either. I don't see anything comparable at all. You know, the ones that we've been seeing the - definite orange or the light-tan stuff around are pure light ejecta blankets around them, not dark.
2154747|LMP|Houston, I guess none of us see anything comparable to what is down by Sulpicius.
2154757|CC|Okay.
2154757|LMP|And no obvious color either.
2154801|CC|Roger.
2154801|CMP|Well, they're comparable to Shorty, but they're not comparable to - they're not comparable to the ones that we've been seeing the obvious orange - -
2154809|CDR|Yes. The craters are comparable to Shorty, as Ron points out, and - but the color is not there.
2154816|CC|Okay. We'd like to give you a couple of spacecraft chores - like to terminate the charge on battery B, and turn tank 1 FANs , ON.
2154833|LMP|- hand me the camera.
2154836|LMP|H2 tank 1 FANs going ON, and I'll get that charge in just a second.
2154842|CC|Okay. And just a reminder to go back to f/4 - -
2154845|CMP|Are you going to be able to get that?
2154845|CC|- - at 1/250 when you get ready for the orbital science photos. Also, the 80-millimeter lens, if you happen to be - have the 250 on there.
2154857|CDR|What's the setting for the ...?
2154901|LMP|Oh, f/8.
2154902|CMP|Well, we're getting a little close to the terminator. Change to 5.6, Jack, I don't know. No, maybe not.
2154909|LMP|We're looking down zero phase.
2154911|CMP|That's right. It's almost zero phase, okay. See. It's just beyond that - -
2154916|PAO|The crew is taking pictures of the landing site at this time.
2154918|CMP|- - I changed to f/4.
2154923|LMP|Yes, but you're going to be looking at the nadir, aren't you?
2154925|CMP|Yes, that's right. Are you sure we want the - Yes, that's right; 8-second intervalometer for looking at the nadir with the 80 millimeter. Right?
2154951|LMP|Yes.
2154952|CMP|Okay. Let me take a look down at the - that mare floor and Dawes. No. That's not Dawes, that's Bessel. Doesn't look like Dawes. Dawes has got a bunch of little depressions that look like rimless pits in the bottom of it. Bessel doesn't have any of those. It looks - like a bunch of debris.
2155054|CMP|There you go, Gene.
2155121|CMP|Yes. Yes, yes, I see it.
2155134|CMP|Yours is on - I see yours, Gene. It's on up there a little farther. Isn't it? But all of these are in the - this is not out in the - the mare floor of Serenitatis. It's on the hills there, the Haemus Mountains. It's just to the west of the Sulpicius Gallus Rille, and it's an elongate feature than runs kind of north-northwest by south-southeast. Yes.
2155215|CDR|... was yours ...?
2155217|CMP|No, it's not in the mare floor at all. It's up there in the edge of the Haemus Mountains. But that was the same type of material that - it has the same color difference as the - the material around the Tacquet Rilles back there. There now, see all those bright orange craters right in the - in the Sulpicius Gallus Rille, up at the north end of it? Jack calls them an orangish-gray; I call them an orangish-tan.
2155300|CDR|... out in the mare that's got this - all that -
2155304|CMP|No. No. Jack, did you get the pictures, good pictures? Because I can take it. See that one - oh, yes - see that one on the mare?
2155316|LMP|Yes. Good one on the mare.
2155318|CMP|Yes.
2155320|LMP|Did you get that one - -
2155321|LMP|Oh, lost my - -
2155322|CDR|Okay, here's my orange crater - -
2155324|LMP|Here, take it.
2155325|LMP|Let me take a look at it.
2155328|CMP|Yes, that's it. Yes, I can, too.
2155359|CMP|Yes, Gene, yours is out on the - I got a picture of it.
2155402|CDR|Are you sure?
2155403|CMP|Yes, yes, I know. It's got a - -
2155404|CDR|Okay. It's just inside, just in the foothills.
2155406|CMP|Yes. Just in the - Wait a minute. Okay, I've got one out in the mare itself. It's got a - strip - -
2155414|CDR|... foothills, and I can't take any ...
2155425|CMP|Well, when we get to - when I see one out there, I'll get it. Yes, I better have because they're getting close to - As a matter of fact, I need it just about right now. Okay?
2155448|CDR|Well, Gordo, we're going - we're going to get set up for Ron's orbital science, but that little classic crater, I could see it again with the - -
2155455|CMP|... 1/250.
2155456|CDR|- - with the naked eye. I don't think it's the same one that Ron and Jack were talking about, but this is so classic. It's just out of the mare into the foothills to the - right along our orbital track.
2155511|CMP|And we're starting with mag 109 for the orbital science on Kilo Kilo, and I don't know what the number was before we started taking all of our (laughter) -
2155523|LMP|...
2155526|CC|Okay. We copy that; 109 on a key - on KK.
2155531|CMP|Okay.
2155532|LMP|...
2155534|CMP|(Laughter) Fortunately. Oh, what? Okay, there's the old Apennines. Where are we heading for on this, Gordy? Can you give me a clue as we go along?
2155557|LMP|South Imbrium.
2155558|CMP|Well, yes; South Imbrium's a big thing.
2155610|CMP|Oh, the stupid thing doesn't work. I got that one.
2155620|LMP|Huh?
2155621|CMP|I got that one. I took it.
2155622|LMP|Oh, I don't think you did.
2155623|CMP|Yes, I did.
2155626|LMP|Gordy.
2155627|CDR|Just a little bit on it. This one is -
2155631|CC|Go ahead.
2155635|LMP|This is Jack. My impression on that rimless, V-shaped depression that had the striking talus on it - that it - it also - there was a spotted, mottled rim area that has the orangish-tan, or orangish-gray color as the spots. And it looked as if the - in this first - in this pass, and I'll try to verify it if we have another opportunity, it looked as if the more red-gray, red-brown-gray, if you will, material was lower in the section within the walls of the depression. This is a very steep-walled depression, by the way. It has talus streaming down the sides of it, and the coloration streams in this same direction. It looks as if there may be layers or roughly horizontal zones that are - have the coloration that we're seeing, which are forming the talus slopes down below them.
2155749|CMP|Break, break. When do I change to 2.8?
2155752|CDR|I'll give them to you.
2155753|CC|Okay, not until you get on up the line, Ron, to Lambert.
2155759|CMP|Oh, okay. Lambert? Okay.
2155802|CC|And your pictures are pretty much right along the nadir.
2155810|CMP|Okay.
2160038|CMP|Now I got it. Okay. Yes. It's La Hire Rilles.
2160041|CDR|Is that Timocharis we're coming up on?
2160042|CMP|Yes, Timochar - We're over Timocharis now, and then La Hire Rilles are coming up.
2160053|LMP|Okay. There's Lambert up there - -
2160055|CMP|Yes. Lambert's right up there, coming up. I'm not sure - well, I don't know what the - just to the south of Lambert. What is that? No, just on the map.
2160110|LMP|Well, Pytheas, but it's -
2160121|CMP|That way. Remember it's right with the La Hire Rilles. There's one rille that goes right through it almost, and then another one - see, goes northeast-southwest. Oh, I see, okay.
2160140|LMP|Gordy, getting a good oblique view of Copernicus on this trip. And some of the dark-halo craters that we mapped originally on the north portion of the ejecta blanket, which were similar to Copernicus H, are very clearly darker halo than the - or have darker blankets around them than the ejecta blanket from Copernicus.
2160217|CC|Roger. And Ron should be due to change to 2.8 about now.
2160226|CMP|Okay.
2160226|LMP|And this is a good view of the central peaks, although from some distance; and, as Ron and I were discussing earlier, it's not at all clear that that - in fact, in fact, that dike does not come through as a - the so-called dike - as a - as a unit that is clearly defined.
2160250|CMP|Yes. I was looking at it through the binocs last time, and I couldn't really see anything that was really defined as coming on through there.
2160300|CC|Okay.
2160301|LMP|There's still a very - there's a very clear distinction between the dark floor material of Copernicus and the hummocky floor material, the dark smooth being in the northwest quadrant.
2160308|CMP|You know, if Lambert is an impact crater, it's sure awful smooth ejecta around that thing. It only goes out about a half a crater diameter, maybe a crater diameter in some spots, at the most; but it's not rough, it's blocky looking. You know, it's smooth - smooth, undulating -
2160403|CC|Ron, your next camera change is at Euler, which you change to 1/125 of a second.
2160412|CMP|I think we just croaked. We did.
2160418|LMP|You out of film?
2160418|CMP|Yes.
2160420|LMP|You want that other mag?
2160422|CMP|Let's throw Oscar Oscar in there to see if it will work.
2160427|CMP|Need the - dark slide. Here. Okay. Where's Oscar Oscar? Whoops. VHBW. There's a -
2160456|LMP|We've got a good oblique view of the Hortensius Domes, and with their nice little central pit craters.
2160529|CMP|Did we hit the stick, or something? Huh? Looks like we're changing attitude. Well, I'll be darned. I put Oscar Oscar on there and I got but one picture. (Laughter) And it's empty. Well, that's probably right. Those won't come out too good there, anyhow. Too close to the terminator for this kind of film.
2160601|CC|Yes, we agree with that, Ron. Farouk was mentioning that was kind of - beyond Euler was pretty marginal anyway.
2160609|CMP|Yes.
2160635|CDR|Gordo, that classic crater that I talked about last rev, I picked it up again this rev with the naked eye, and then I also looked at it again with the binocs. If Ron was talking about the same crater, and I have my doubts, he got a picture of it, he said. But the interior - I won't say there's a change to black; it's just dark. I'd say it's probably about the size, to put it in the right perspective, of Shorty, or just a little bit bigger. The inside is dark. By that, I don't nean it's black or anything inside; I just can't really see inside of it. But the - it's a rust-colored blanket that comes out and overlaps on the rims and then has the classic ejecta. And I'm going to take a shot at trying to get a picture of it next rev or sometime when we're in an attitude, because it's too good to miss.
2160736|CC|Okay. And, commander, if you can send one of your subordinates over there to terminate the battery charge, we'd appreciate it.
2160750|CDR|(Laughter) Okay, that's in work.
2160807|CMP|Seven Bravo. It's 1 point - it's coming up just a little bit. Well, not much, 1 point - well, 1.25.
2160824|LMP|Okay, Houston. Battery charge on B is terminated, and we got 1.25 on 7 Bravo.
2160831|CC|Okay, thank you.
2160840|CMP|Here's November November; it may have three or four pictures left. It's on 160. ... me set one up. Oh, we've got Papa Papa for opportunity, heh. Yes. I'll get it.
2160928|LMP|Houston, are you ready for LASER ALTIMETER, ON?
2161008|CC|Stand by.
2161025|CC|America, we're seeing some higher than normal temperatures on fuel cell 1. We'd like you to go to panel 226 and check the FUEL CELL 1 PUMP circuit breaker and also the switch on panel 5. Over.
2161053|LMP|Well, don't ask me how it happened, but your switch on panel 5 is OFF. Going to AC1.
2161102|CC|Okay. I guess that's the best news that we could have had on that. And we're ready for the laser altimeter - -
2161109|LMP|Okay. Hey, Gordy - -
2161110|CC|- - whenever you get to the attitude.
2161112|LMP|- - Gordy? Here's one you can explain to me: When I turned that on - well, I guess that - I got a sudden drop in H2 flow; and then it went up, overshot a little bit, and now it's steady. I suspect that's what your EECOM friend there will say should happen.
2161139|CC|Yes. That's right, and we see indications that the pump started up.
2161204|LMP|Okay, that was a good call. I can't - How long have you noticed that, Gordy? Do you know?
2161210|CC|Well, it's been about 3 minutes, Jack.
2161216|LMP|Okay. I guess I'm to blame then; I don't know how it happened.
2161235|CMP|Hey, Houston, America. Do we have any more orbital science photos?
2161243|CC|Stand by.
2161247|CMP|I think that was it, but I'm not sure.
2161404|CMP|Okay, Houston. LASER ALTIMETER is ON, and IMAGE MOTION is barber pole plus 4.
2161411|CC|Okay. Thank you.
2161558|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 216 hours 15 minutes. A few minutes ago you heard Capcom, Gordon Fullerton, query the crew as to whether or not a switch might have been placed in the wrong position on one of the pumps circulating glycol, a coolant, to fuel cell 1. And Jack Schmitt looked at the panel, confirmed that a switch was in fact in the OFF position, turned it back on and everthing was back to normal with no problem. By way of background the EECOM, John Aaron, had noticed a slight increase in temperature on fuel cell 1 via the telemetry. After watching it for or 4 minutes he asked Capcom to check with the crew, see if the switch controlling the glycol pump was in the OFF position and as mentioned, Jack Schmitt confirmed that it was. This pump, as we say, circulates liquid glycol coolant through the fuel cells and cools it in much the same way that water flowing through radiators and around the engine of your automobile, cools the automobile engine. The most likely explanation for the switch being in the wrong position that we have here, appeared to be a more or less transitory phenomenon, was that it was bumped by one of the crewmen moving about the cabin in zero g. The fuel cell temperatures very quickly dropped back to normal once the pump was turned on again. We have about 18 minutes remaining in this pass before we loose radio contact with Apollo 17. We are showing an orbit at this time with a high point or apocynthion of 65.2 nautical miles and a low point or paracynthion of 62.2  Among the other statistics the orbital weight of the CSM at this time is 36,477 pounds. And the orbital period just a tad under 2 hours - 1 hour 59 minutes 17 seconds.
2161832|CC|Say, Ron, this is Houston. And there's no more scheduled orbital science photos. We can't seem to run down Farouk to see if he has anything up his sleeve. There are a couple of passes with black and white coming up; one next rev, and then a couple just prior to TEI.
2161854|CMP|Okay. Looks like what we've got left here, as far as I can tell anyhow, is just - we've got all of magazine Papa Papa, and maybe four or five of them on November November.
2161908|CC|Okay. And we'll come back to you if there's anything we got in mind to schedule on - on either of those.
2161918|CMP|Okay. We'll want to save some for after TEI to shoot back at the Moon.
2161925|CC|Roger.
2161931|LMP|Hey, Gordy, that's TEI-1, not TEI-2 he's talking about.
2161941|CMP|Okay, I see what he said.
2161946|CC|Roger. TEI, period.
2161955|CMP|That's right.
2162006|CDR|These guys can call it what they like, but I know what it's going to be and when.
2162117|CC|America, a little human interest stuff here. We just watched the second charge go off; not just watched, it's been about half hour ago or so. Second charge went off, and we caught it just in the lower left corner of the TV view. It looked like a - to me it looked like a flashbulb went off - flashbulb laying on the ground vent off, just a kind of a quick flash. No big shower of dirt or anything that I could tell.
2162117|CDR|How far away do you expect that one was, Gordy?
2162155|CC|That one was 600 meters away. And it was a half-pound charge.
2162205|CDR|Yes, you're still pretty far away over that - yes, you're still pretty far away over that - that terrain that those things are sitting in over there. You're going to probably see something when you look at those that are placed by the end of the SEP and back to the east there.
2162223|CC|Roger.
2162424|LMP|Houston, America.
2162427|CC|Go ahead.
2162431|LMP|Do you need the cryos stirred at all today?
2162437|CC|Let me see here. Stand by. No. I guess you've been bouncing around there enough. We don't need to stir them.
2162452|LMP|It won't hurt them, will it?
2162456|CC|No.
2162501|LMP|Okay.
2162550|CC|Showing about 115 beats per minute on the CMP.
2162616|PAO|That call of a 115 beats refers to Ron Evans' heart rate, the Command Module Pilot, exercising at this time.
2162711|CC|America, we'll take AUTO on the HIGH GAIN.
2162721|LMP|Okay, you've got AUTO.
2163452|CC|Okay, America, we're about to LOS in 40 seconds. Everything looks good as it always has. See you next time around.
2163506|CDR|See you Gordy, and thanks for keeping an eye on us.
2163516|CC|One last frantic reminder to configure the DSE per the Flight Plan after LOS.
2163528|CDR|Okay, we'll get it.
2163528||BEGIN LUNAR REV 66
2163536|PAO|And, we've had loss of signal with Apollo 17 on this the 65th revolution. We'll be reacquiring as usual in about 45 minutes. And for the rest of the flight plan up to the crews sleep period which begins at about 220 hours we have relatively quiet time very little scheduled in the flight plan - have an eat period. During the next revolution the crew will be operating the panoramic camera in the SIM bay. They're scheduled to be in the midst of an exercise period at this time. And we could confirm from the biomedical data on Ron Evans, his heart rate, that he was indeed exercising. Prior to beginning the sleep period the crew will be going through their film magazines getting everything ready for an active day of picture taking tomorrow. There will be a lunar surface science briefing at 9:20 a.m. Saturday December 16 in the main auditorium building 1 at MSC. Again that time is 9:20 a.m. December 16. At 216 hours 37 minutes this is Apollo Control Houston.
2171809|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 217 hours 18 minutes, and we'll be back in radio contact with Apollo 17 in about a minute. On this revolution, the major activities aboard the spacecraft will be the operation of scientific instruments. It's a relatively quiet period of time for the crew. The pan camera will be turned on briefly, just so we can get a look at the telemetry data on that camera. We won't be obtaining any photography with it. The mapping camera will be on for one full revolution obtaining ground track coverage supplemented by the laser altimeter data that provides an altitude reference in each photograph. Also the infrared and ultraviolet spectrometers will be operating and the crew will be taking a few hand held photographs out the spacecraft windows, using the Hasselblad camera. We may have a bit of noisy communications toward the beginning of this pass. We've just gotten acquisition of signal and we'll be receiving the spacecraft through one of the 85 foot dish antennas, rather than the 210 antenna. We do have acquisition of signal now and appear to have reasonably good signal strength.
2172019|CMP|Houston, America. Looks like we're with you again.
2172023|CC|Okay, America.
2172023|CMP|. ... We've been taking its picture just as we came up.
2172029|CC|Roger. You're loud and clear.
2172039|CMP|Okay.
2172310|CC|America, Houston. I have three one-liners for the Flight Plan.
2172322|LMP|Is this the same Flight Plan we've been working on up here?
2172329|CC|I think it is.
2172338|LMP|Okay, Gordy. Go ahead.
2172342|CC|Okay, at 218:09, delete MAPPING CAMERA - RETRACT. At 218:30, delete MAPPING CAMERA/LASER ALTIMETER COVER - CLOSED. And at 219:59 - next page - in addition to IR and UV COVERs - OPEN, put in LASER ALTIMETER - ON.
2172428|LMP|Okay. At 219:59, LASER ALTIMETER - ON; and at 218:30, delete MAPPING CAMERA/LASER ALTIMETER - OPEN; and at 218:09, delete MAPPING CAMERA - RETRACT.
2172445|CC|Okay, that second one was deleting a COVER CLOSED, but I'm sure that's the one you got. MAPPING CAMERA/LASER ALTIMETER COVER - CLOSED. And that laser altimeter, we'll just leave her run through the sleep period.
2172504|LMP|Okay.
2172730|CMP|Can't see it, sorry.
2172743|CMP|May have. Smythii may have, on the thing. I still want to talk a little bit about these polygonal craters and Smythii. The one right above rev 62 picture on the thing, there's definitely kind of a - an unindated (sic) old depression there with a mare, very smooth mare floor on the thing. With two, - two old craters. And, that is definitely a younger flow than whatever made the polygonal craterlike depression. Right above the rev 62 number. The thing that bothers me about that is that they, they almost - oh, looks like if you threw a rock in the mud, you know - made a mud pie, and you get a wave or a ripple going out from there. In other words, you've got a high wavefront going out from a circular direction with a slightly sloping up to that wavefront. That's on the inner ring on the thing. The outer ring, of course, is a typical-type ring that you get from an impact type of an operation. It looked like the rough-looking floors of those rings, ring basins, essentially have the same albedo, the same characteristic, as the rougher looking floor in the Mare Smythii itself.
2172918|CC|Okay, Ron.
2172923|CC|We'll take HIGH GAIN to AUTO.
2172931|CMP|Okay, you have it.
2172940|CMP|And, I took a picture of that one in Smythii - is frame 160 on mag November November, and the reason I took the picture is really because on the western edge of the big basin it looks like there's a small impact crater, but it's only been dished out in the more recent flat dark-gray mare material. {Music in background) And looks like when it comes to the edge of the original basin ring, that part is not ejected out at all. So, essentially, you have a cone-type depression with an impact crater. The material's only been excavated in the - in the newer mare material.
2173041|CC|Okay, understand that. Say again, where that one is?
2173045|CMP|Yes, that's the one above rev 62 or directly north of the Wright Brothers, in the 12:00 position from the Wright Brothers.
2173055|CC|Oh, okay.
2173247|CMP|You know, Houston, we're just passing over a little polygonal crater that's maybe 15 kilometers in diameter - 15, 20 kilometers in diameter. It may be 10 to 15 - and down in the basin of it is a kind of a polygonal fill. It, again, has that dark greenish-black rock that is collected down at the bottom of it, and you also see it streaking down the side of it. But, I think one of the most significant features about the crater itself is that it has a swirl, and these are honest to goodness - they look like swirls rather than rays. It has a swirl pattern around there - it's radial, from that most recent impact.
2173343|CC|Roger, Ron.
2173550|CC|America, Houston, we haven't got data right at the moment because we are in a skin reflection zone. We'd like you to hold the pan camera to STANDBY until we call you.
2173606|LMP|Thank you.
2173608|CMP|Okay.
2173623|CMP|It's near - just see Yerkes. Come down from Yerkes. Yerkes is the subdued crater up there. Come down from Yerkes, and then there's a little one about 10 kilometers in diameter; and, then a big one that's about 50; and, then there's a bright one. Okay, and then - -
2173640|CMP|Yes, and then right - let me see, kind of northwest of that bright one, about a crater and a half diameter from it - is an orange-ringed crater, again.
2173730|CMP|See it - right, right, just a - bright one just about a crater and a half diameter from the bright one. See it? See, it's an orange ring on it, isn't it? That's the one we were talking - - I'll get it. Yes.
2173744|CMP|Yes, I know it. That's right. It's not a classic, but it's another example of an orangish-tannish - Say what? See that bright crater down there. Just about a crater and a half diameter to the north of it - f/8 at 250 - that ought to be good. And Houston, that was frame 162.
2173811|CC|Okay, Ron.
2173812|CMP|Yeah, we - -
2173817|CDR|And, the frame just before that - I took of a ridge just on the southern edge of Crisium, - the pattern of the massifs in that area were very impressive, but two frames just before that.
2173833|CC|Okay.
2173905|CMP|Houston, just one other question. I was looking around here at my film, and I got mag Victor Victor, which is VHBW for the Nikon. And looking through the Flight Plan, it doesn't look like we're going to be able to use that anytime. I just wonder if we might be able to use it for some of these terminator photos?
2173940|CC|We'll check on the film. We'd like you to go WIDE for 10 seconds and then back to NARROW.
2173948|CMP|Okay. There's WIDE. Looks like that did it.
2174024|CC|Okay, Ron. The HIGH GAIN looks good; and, on the film - it's your option on that magazine. There's no scheduled usage.
2174033|CMP|Oh, okay, thank you.
2174036|LMP|Okay, you want PAN CAMERA POWER, ON, now?
2174040|CC|That's affirm. We're ready now.
2174046|LMP|Okay, it's ON.
2174307|CC|Okay, America. We'll take PAN CAMERA POWER OFF, now.
2174317|LMP|Okay, it's OFF.
2174338|CMP|The landing site?
2174339|CMP|No, the optics are up in the air all the time on this SIM bay stuff.
2174352|LMP|Houston. Areas in the landing site where we now know there are extensive blocks of the subfloor material, particularly in the walls of the larger craters, I have the impression that those block fields, from this altitude, give a light bluish-gray appearance.
2174422|CC|Roger, Jack.
2174431|LMP|I don't know how far we could extrapolate that in other craters, but we might start trying a little bit.
2174438|CC|Roger.
2174531|LMP|Following that a little bit farther, looking into Dawes, the lower talus slopes of Dawes have about the same hue and are overlaying the first by a zone that's producing - or several ledges that seem, to be producing white talus and then above that is the - or make that very light-gray talus - and above that is a tan-gray talus slope that carries right up to the rim of Dawes. So, there are three distinct major stratigraphic units showing up in the talus slope in Dawes that I can see.
2174620|CMP|Jack, can you see any holes in the - square holes in the floor of Dawes, there?
2174625|LMP|Wait a minute. No, I was, I guess I was talking about the crater northeast of Dawes - Let me check Dawes with the same sequence.
2174636|CMP|No. Dawes is the little one down there. That other one is - -
2174639|LMP|Okay, take it back again. That was Dawes I was talking about.
2174641|CMP|Yes.
2174644|CMP|Jack, you using the binocs?
2174650|CMP|Yes, I talked about Dawes already but - No, those aren't holes down there, those are just great big - great big blocks that have fallen off the side of the mountain. Side of the - Okay.
2174716|LMP|Okay, between the tan gray and the very light gray there may be another thin and possibly intermittent zone of a - just a plain, apparently gray unit forming in the talus slope.
2174816|LMP|And the crater to the southeast of - southwest - excuse me, of Dawes - large crater, I'll get the name in a minute, you see the lower bluish-gray unit and - and the next white unit or light-gray unit up, but the brown-gray unit is not nearly so evident at the top. In fact, I didn't really say I could recognize it there at all. I'll have to check that one, though. Put a query by it.
2174859|CC|Roger.
2174900|CMP|That's Bessel you're talking about. Yes. The top of Serenity?
2174906|LMP|No, no the one back.
2174908|CMP|Oh, Plinius.
2174910|LMP|Plinius?
2174910|CMP|Plinius is that rough-looking one. Yes.
2174913|LMP|Yes. That was Plinius I was talking about.
2174924|CMP|Oh, Yes. ... the oranges. Yes.
2174936|LMP|And, the next large - well, it's not large - not as big as Dawes, it's a reasonable-sized crater that to the west, the talus is largely just white debris on the slope of it. But, it doesn't look like it penetrated nearly as deep as the other two we're talking about.
2175023|CMP|Ah, Menelaus? Tacquet is the one that is out - right underneath us right now. And then Menelaus is right on the edge of the Serenitatis Basin before you get to the Haemus Mountains.
2175037|LMP|Okay, looking at Menelaus, you can see where the dark - the edge of Serenitatis goes through the crater. And, the north wall is quite distinctly grayer to - let's say, bluish-gray, than the south wall, which is light - very light gray in the talus. My guess is that it's a very nearly vertical contact at that point.
2175114|CC|Roger.
2175117|LMP|At least that's the way the talus suggests it, but talus does move vertically.
2175150|LMP|Looking at the depression with all the color streaking in the talus on the walls - there - I'll say again, that the more red-looking unit, or talus, is coming from below the orangish-gray material. But it is not a continuous horizon, at least not so far as the talus indicates. It's local spots that are giving the reddish color.
2175229|CC|Okay.
2175240|LMP|Gordy. That particular depression doesn't look like it's an impact-generated depression at all.
2175250|CC|Roger.
2175302|CMP|You know, we sure got to look and see if those things still look orange tomorrow. Because, yesterday, Stoney looked kind of orange there - on the northeast rim but it sure doesn't today - Shorty, yes. It pays to learn the names of all those craters you guys named down there.
2175329|CMP|Oh yes. I know quite a bunch of them.
2175338|CMP|Hey, we'd better, hadn't we. Black and - D-Caldera is what I called it.
2175347|LMP|Yes, Ron's D-Caldera - I'm just correlating apparent colors now, or hues. And, the lighter-colored material there is comparable in hue to the subfloor color at the landing site.
2175421|CMP|The first one's f/32 at 1/500. Tobias Mayer.
2175435|CMP|... A window.
2175437|LMP|Window 5-
2175437|CMP|Window 5? Okay.
2175439|LMP|What's the frame count ... surface?
2175442|CMP|Count is 55 now on Romeo Romeo, Houston. No, not until we come up to Tobias, just before Tobias Mayer.
2175450|CDR|Be able to pick that up there about - -
2175451|CMP|On the other side of Copernicus.
2175459|CMP|Right after 218. Okay.
2175506|CC|Roger that, Ron.
2175642|CMP|(Cough)
2175653|CC|Ron, this is Houston. Do you want any help from me calling the f/stop changes on this P66 run? Or do you want to do it onboard there?
2175706|CMP|Why don't you give me a little help there. Just kind of reminders? So to f/11 about Tobias Mayer, I guess, and, then -
2175719|CC|Okay. Then f/8 and a 1/250 is at Brayley D.
2175730|CMP|Yes, right.
2175734|CC|Are you shooting pretty much straight down or out in front, on this one?
2175743|CMP|Let's see. We're pretty much straight down on this one.
2175749|CC|Okay, I've got a real-time plot of your longi - or your - yes, longitude here. So I can call right on longitude.
2175800|CMP|Oh, okay. Yes, I started before Tobias Mayer.
2175820|CMP|There goes - What's there? Eratosthenes, okay.
2180136|CMP|Yes, about right in here it's a good place.
2180314|LMP|Okay, Houston, back to talking about colors a little bit. It looked as If lower talus is more - -
2180320|CC|Hold 1, Jack. It's about time for f/11 - -
2180324|LMP|Go ahead.
2180325|CC|... Ron.
2180328|CMP|Okay, f/11 at 1/500.
2180331|CC|That's affirmative.
2180333|LMP|Euler is - lower is blue-gray and the upper is a very light gray, from the talus slope up to the rim.
2180406|CDR|Houston, I can just start to see the peaks of Euler now - exposed in the central peak - the tops of them exposed in the sunlight, and it looks like there's massive quantities of large boulders on the - on the peaks.
2180421|CC|Roger, Gene. Okay, it must be about time for f/8 and 1/250.
2180445|CMP|f/8 at 1/250, okay? That's my little "C" - crater chain down there. Looks like a cinder cone chain. Right (cough) between Tobias Mayer and Euler.
2180516|CC|Roger.
2180545|CC|Okay, try f/5.6 and 1/25.
2180554|CMP|5.6 at 1/25. Is this the last - -?
2180557|CC|Last setting, right, and you should finish up there at Tobias Mayer W.
2180605|CMP|Okay.
2180610|CC|Or a little beyond.
2180634|CDR|Houston, the MAPPING CAMERA is coming OFF.
2180639|CC|Roger.
2180707|CMP|Okay, Houston. We ended up on frame 80, magazine RR.
2180714|CC|Okay, Ron.
2180729|LMP|Okay, Houston, MAPPING CAMERA - STANDBY, now. IMAGE MOTION is OFF and LASER ALTIMETER - OFF.
2180740|CC|Roger.
2181010|LMP|Houston, what do you read our GLYCOL EVAP TEMP as? I tapped the gauge up here and got a little bit of upward jump in temperature. Just curious how much a hang up it was.
2181024|CC|Stand by. Okay, we show 66 EVAP out TEMP.
2181033|LMP|That's exactly what it jumped to. Okay.
2181104|CDR|Gordo, I'm interested. How have you been reading me most all day today? I've been on lightweight headset, all the time.
2181113|CC|I'd say you're fine, since I've been on. Let me check you the rest of the day.
2181122|CDR|No, it would be the same all day. You're - you're as good a data point as any. I haven't really tried to make ajay effort to talk into the mike or anything, I just been talking around it, and If you're satisfied, I'm happy.
2181139|CC|Okay, sound gooded (sic) all day. No cutout or anything - no problem.
2181148|CDR|Okay.
2181725|CDR|Houston, America. The canister's changed.
2181730|CC|Okay, Gene.
2181934|CMP|I think you can stand by for some small torquing angles on this one. Right within the center of the sextant.
2181944|CC|Okay.
2182104|CMP|Well, I did get 5 balls that time; but, that's not bad.
2182109|CC|We'll buy that. Well, the Z-axis here looks pretty good, anyway. You're clear to torque.
2182131|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. We'll torque at 21 - I missea 30 - Let's go to 21:45.
2182141|CC|Okay.
2182613|CC|America, Houston. Request the H2 TANK 2 FAN, ON. Over.
2182625|CMP|Okay. H2 TANK 2 FAN is ON.
2182628|CC|Okay, and the waste water dump that you'll start after LOS should take 11 minutes, if you want to set your kitchen clock. Also a reminder, this time after LOS we go to REACQ. Over.
2182651|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. Thank you. Will do. We'll go to REACQ.
2182903|LMP|Houston, the IR/UV COVERs are CLOSED.
2182906|CC|Okey-doke.
2183345||BEGIN LUNAR REV 67
2183434|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Apollo 17 now going behind the Moon on it's 66th revolution out of radio contact. The crew is scheduled to begin an 8 hour sleep period about 2 hours from now. The next revolution will be a rather quiet one. The crew is scheduled to eat prior to completing final checklist items before going to bed. And we do anticipate having a change of shift press briefing, which will start at around 12:15 to 12:30 a.m. in the MSC news center briefing room. At 218 hours 35 minutes this Apollo Control Houston.
2191103|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 219 hours 11 minutes. Change of shift news conference is ready to begin in the MSC News Center Briefing Room. We're 5-1/2 minutes away from acquisition of signal on the 67 revolution. We'll tape and play back any conversation after the news conference.
2191652|CC|Hello, America; Houston. Glad to have you back.
2191659|CDR|Well, we got a good one for you, Bob. Not too good, but - in the midst of other things, we let the waste water go to zero on that dump. As a matter of fact, it went past zero. And the ... is starting to fill up again, and the best we can tell onboard, that - it shouldn't disturb anything, but you might take a good look at it.
2191718|CC|Okay. We've got our moon beside me taking a look at it.
2191723|CDR|Okay. How are you doing tonight?
2191726|CC|Not too badly. I'll have you know, it's clear down here. We saw the Moon for the first time since launch day, and it's getting bright. It looks like you must be somewhere over the terminator on Imbrium.
2191736|CDR|Is that right?
2191737|CC|First time we've seen the Moon since launch.
2191740|CMP|Oh, we just - Oh, it's beautiful. Your weather has been that bad, huh?
2191746|CC|That's affirm. Fog and drizzle and rain and rain and rain.
2191753|LMP|How much older do you feel, Bob?
2191756|CC|About 1 day. Okay. And, America, we'd like H2 TANK 2 FANS, OFF. H2 TANK 2, OFF.
2191914|LMP|They're OFF.
2191920|CC|And, America, as you can tell from the Flight Plan, we aren't expecting too much from you guys this rev. And we aren't expecting to send up too much to you guys either. A reminder that we won't be asking Gene and Jack for their PRDs tonight, but we certainly would like them in the morning. So you might take that into consideration. And we'll be sending you a few up-links there as per the Flight Plan at 220, both the state vector and the EMP 523. We also have a clock update for you - that we'll send up, and it's a 0.04 seconds; so it's another biggie.
2191956|CDR|Okay, Bob. We'll make an effort to get those PRDs. We can get one of them, probably, without too much trouble. But if it's a case of restowing both those suits to get the second one, we're not going to get it until EVA day. I'm sorry, but that's it.
2192016|CC|We copy that. I guess they're back stored in the L-bag, huh?
2192022|CDR|Yes, sir.
2192025|CC|Okay. And we'll want the onboard read outs there at the bottom of the page, just before you go LOS, And I might pass up one little piece of news - very local news here - concerning us members of the Orange Team. We're all extremely proud that you and Jack chose to call the soil you found the other night, while we were on shift, the Orange soil because we take it as an obvious honor for the Orange Team to have been on shift at that point.
2192055|CDR|Bob, you know our intent was certainly well meant. We certainly are glad you appreciate it.
2192106|LMP|I detect a certain amount of skepticism whether it's really orange, though.
2192113|CC|It looked orange on Ed's TV.
2192119|CDR|Did it really? Could you see the color enough?
2192122|CC|Well, so did the blue ocean on the Earth, and so did the white suits and everything else; but they looked orange on Ed's TV anyway.
2192135|LMP|Is Ed on tonight?
2192140|CC|We don't have any - No, we've seen the two - only two charges for the day. We don't have another charge for, I guess, about another 24 hours or so.
2192221|CDR|I think I understand.
2192224|CC|Roger. Ed is on the Orange Team, however.
2192230|CDR|Bob, I would like a word from you, though, as to whether or not you think there is going to be any problem with that waste water dump to zero as I said. We don't, after looking at it.
2192241|CC|No, we aren't expecting any problem. They're looking at it. They're kind of amused, but they're looking at it. And I'd like to pass up to you fellows, it's - -
2192254|LMP|... an interesting.
2192256|CC|Go ahead.
2192300|CDR|All right. Nothing, Bob.
2192304|CC|Okay, I might also tell you fellows, in case nobody told you yesterday, that we tracked the LM on ascent for 30 seconds. Beautiful pitchover. And we saw you going away from us after pitchover for 30 seconds. It came out quite well.
2192324|CDR|Yes, sir. We heard that. Good. I guess I was able to find 102 at 0.1
2192343|CC|In fact, Ed calculates that you were 480 feet-480 feet - from the lens. As they say, too far is better than too close.
2192357|CDR|Well, I was just going to say I cheated a little bit. I made two stops and backed up a little bit out there.
2192404|CC|You backed up, huh? That's another first, isn't it?
2192410|CDR|No, I didn't back up that time. But I did back up.
2192415|CC|We heard that one at Station 7 - yes, 7, wasn't it?
2192423|CDR|No, that was somewhere during EVA-2, I can't remember where.
2192454|CMP|Houston, frame numbers 40 through 43 are timed sequences of the waste water dump as we were in the sunlight.
2192513|CC|Okay. I copy that one.
2192609|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 219 hours 26 minutes. We are in contact with spacecraft, America and have accumulated a few minutes of tape. We'll play that now.
2192701|CDR|And, Bob, just give us a call when you want the computer.
2192705|CC|Okay. It's about another half hour or so, I guess, when we're ready. It will be about 220. And, a reminder, we got - at 220 there we're going to go LASER ALTIMETER, ON and the IR and UV COVERS, OPEN as per your Flight Plan there.
2192721|CDR|Yes, sir. I got LASER, ON and IR and UV, OPEN.
2192724|CC|Right.
2193417|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're back live now.
2193527|CDR|Hey, Bob, while it's sort of quiet, anything of a news worthy - or noteworthy news happen today?
2193537|CC|Okay. Stand by on that. From my recollection this evening, there really wasn't anything; but I'll check. Did you guys get a news briefing this morning?
2193550|CDR|Yes, we did.
2193554|CC|Okay. We got some news coming over, and we'll have it here before you go around the hern. Might just, while things are quiet also, pass up to you that, if you run out of the command module film. there, you do have two - You've got some LM surface film left, as I'm sure you're aware. And two mags in particular, which look fine to us, are mag Barabara and mag Karen. Barabara has 500 frames of CEX, and Karen, 100 frames of black and white. Excuse me, 50 frames, not 500, of CEX. And 100 of black and white. These mags have never been fit checked on the command module cameras; but we believe that they will, along with - as long as we take precaution because the locks don't work the same, ... on the command module on the LM cameras, number 1. And number 2, the focus won't be quite as good as on the - with the LM cameras. However, it will be satisfactory. So there's 150 frames there you might want to take advantage of in those two mags. We think those are in Romeo 2 - stowage Romeo 2.
2193709|CDR|Yes, yes. We've already inventoried those. And we've got our hands on them. However, we - Bravo is empty. We used it coming up in the rendezvous and docking.
2193803|CC|And just in case you got some left over, I want to shoot some of that black and white on the Moon. We got some instructions for you, which we can call up in real time, if you want to do it -different exposures. The CEX will be the same, of course, as the CEX that's in the command module.
2193821|LMP|Okay. Bob, what factor on the black and white would you use?
2193924|CC|Okay. Jack, if you use them, use the same chart you have onboard for the CEX, but you cut the shutter speed by a factor of 2. So it's - for instance, you'd use a 1/500 instead of 1/250 -and so forth. Over.
2193944|LMP|Okay.
2194127|CDR|Say, Bob, I don't think - At least I haven't heard anything concerning the home front for about 4 days. You haven't, by any chance, had any contact, have you?
2194142|CC|As a matter of fact, I haven't. And Gordy didn't talk to them tonight. And - in fact, Gordy and I talked about it on one of your - when we were doing the changeover, and I thought, well, it doesn't look like an opportune time to call up and find out right now. If you like, I can. I'm not sure whether they're still up or not; or I can leave instructions for Overmeyer in the morning to round people up and see what's going on. I'll - I'll make sure Overmeyer does it in the morning.
2194209|CDR|No. Don't worry about it, Bob. I was just curious I - No news is as good as good news.
2194217|CC|Yes, that's my presumption. I kind of thought the daytime people would have taken care of that. It's not the best time in the morning to call up right now. I'll make sure Overmeyer calls in the morning and checks on it.
2194246|CDR|Gordy gave us a briefing on the SIM bay and on the lunar surface experiments. And it sounds like all that good liaison work you did paid off. Sounds like most everybody is pretty satisfied.
2194302|CC|As far as I can tell, that's right. We - we try there, fellow.
2194313|CDR|We thank you.
2194319|CC|What can I say? We thank you guys, too.
2195418|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 219 hours 54 minutes. 38 minutes remaining in this pass. The crew is eating at the present time. America's orbit now 65.4 by 62.3 nautical miles.
2195921|CC|Okay, America; Houston. We're ready for a little action there in the SIM bay.
2195924|CMP|... is on.
2195925|CC|Copy that. You just beat us by a minute. And if you guys will give us - -
2195929|CDR|It's already on, Bob.
2195930|CC|Roger. And if you guys will give us the computer, we'll send those updates to you.
2195940|CMP|Okay, you have the computer.
2195942|CC|Okay. And if you guys want to sit and listen, I'll broadcast you what's possibly the world's shortest newscast.
2195954|CDR|Both covers are open and gray, Bob.
2195956|CC|Okay. We copy that.
2200107|LMP|Go ahead, Bob, on the news. We were waiting for you.
2200110|CC|Oh, okay. I was waiting to see if you guys were ready to listen to it. The first item - which has been a continuing item here during the flight. In Kansas City, former President Harry S. Truman's condition continues to deteriorate as doctors are unable to restore his vital kidney functions. On the Paris peace talks scene, there has been essentially no apparent further developments today. It continues about the same. And in New York, police are red-faced, it says, when it was learned that more than 50 pounds of heroin originally seized way back in 1962 - this is part of the French Connection business - has been stolen from the police building where it was being kept as evidence. And a last local news item. Three prominent Houston men are missing. They were last seen in person at Cape Kennedy in Florida on December 6 but were apparently lost among the 500,000 people who watched the launch of Apollo 17. The following appeal, it says, is issued in case they are listening: "Gene, Jack, and Ron, - come home. And if you pass a fellow with a bushy white beard and crimson suit, advise him you'll be home before Christmas." That's the extent of the news.
2200229|LMP|We saw him the other morning briefly, Bob. And all four of us will be around at the right time.
2200237|CC|That's good news. We'll pass it on.
2200538|LMP|Bob, I've got some on-board readouts if you want them.
2200540|CC|Okay. We're ready to copy.
2200547|CDR|I'll just give them to you - okay - I was going to say - I don't know if you've got - yes, in order: 36.7, 37, 37. RCS is 68, 61, 65, and 66.
2200604|CC|Okay, we copy that, and we'd like a battery manifold pressure reading. That's 7-A on the selector down there. Seven Alfa.
2200659|CC|And, America, the computer is yours again.
2200708|LMP|Bob, 7 Alfa is 1.4.
2200712|CC|Copy, 1.4. And did you copy the computer is yours?
2200719|CDR|Yes, sir. We got it.
2201808|CC|Okay, and, America, we'd like to configure our H2 tanks for the night. TANK 1 to OFF, TANK 2 is already OFF, and we'd like TANK 3 to AUTO.
2201829|CMP|Okay, Houston, you've got TANK 1 is OFF, TANK 2 is OFF, and 3 is AUTO.
2201835|CC|Okay, thank you.
2202200|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 220 hours 21 minutes. Clock shows 11 minutes 13 seconds before loss of signal on this revolution. However, because of the pointing angle of the high gain antenna on the spacecraft, which is now configured for the rest period, we anticipate an early LOS, perhaps 5 minutes prior to the clock time.
2202332|LMP|Houston, 17.
2202333|CC|Roger, 17. Go ahead.
2202337|LMP|Roger. As you - we approach having earthset, you night be interested to know, being an astronomer, Bob, that we're getting a very bright specular reflection off the Earth now from the Sun that produces - reproduces the Sun's image quite well.
2202355|CC|Very good. And we're about, between 4 and 5 minutes from losing track of you guys tonight, and you're GO for LOS and GO for sleep and we won't be saying anything more to you coming around the horn, but we'll be up listening to you though. But we'll consider you guys as going to sleep on the back side. Over.
2202419|LMP|Okay. Well, we're moving in that direction, partly to get the cabin cooled down. And we'll probably talk to you in the morning, before very long.
2202429|CC|Okay, well then, open the windows to get it cooled down too much, there.
2202432|LMP|By the way - Okay.
2202446|CC|And while you guys are sleeping tonight, you might be glad to know that the old Orange Team will be sitting around the fireplace here and they'll all be singing Christmas carols.
2202500|CDR|That I believe.
2202508|LMP|Is Stan serving coffee to you?
2202516|CC|We're holding out out for egg nog tonight.
2202519|CDR|Well, good night, Robert.
2202521|CC|Good night, Geno.
2202522|LMP|Well, that would be appropriate, I don't - you know - I think it's about time they treated the MOCR to something.
2202535|CMP|Good night, Robert.
2202537|CC|Good night, Ron. Say good night, Dick.
2202543|CDR|Good night, Dick. And we'll see you in the morning, I guess, Bob, if you're still around. If not, we'll see you tomorrow about this time.
2202554|CC|Okay, and by then you'll be headed home.
2202600|CDR|Yes, sir. And if my homefront's listening, I just want to say good night and sleep tight.
2202736|CMP|Bob, that's the most beautiful crescent Earth I've ever seen.
2202744|CC|It's a nice place to come home to, guys.
2202851||BEGIN LUNAR REV 68
2203013|PAO|This is Apollo Control, we have had loss of signal on the 67th revolution. The crew of Apollo 17 preparing for an 8 hour rest period now. That rest period to begin at 220 hours 30 minutes, about - less than, well, about right now as a matter of fact. All systems on the spacecraft operating normally. We will be monitoring the spacecraft through out the night while it is on the front side of the Moon, although we do not plan to talk to the crew on the next pass, we'll come up hourly during the rest period with status reports. At 220 hours 30 minutes, this is Mission Control, Houston.
2213700|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 221 hours 37 minutes. Apollo 17 is in the 68th revolution, coming up over the landing site at Taurus-Littrow very shortly. We've had no conversation with the crew since loss of signal on the 67th revolution, their rest period starting at that time. All spacecraft systems are performing well, 6 hours and 42 minutes remaining in the rest period. At 221 hours 37 minutes, this is Mission Control Houston.
2223700|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 222 hours 37 minutes. All still going well with Apollo 17 now behind the Moon in its 68th revolution. 5 hours 42 minutes remaining in the crew's rest period. At 222 hours 37 minutes this is Mission Control Houston.
2233700|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 223 hours 37 minutes. The spacecraft, America is orbiting the front side of the Moon in it's 69th revolution. Flight controllers are monitoring systems and all are performing well. The ultraviolet and infared experiments are being performed during this rest period of which 4 hours and 42 minutes remains. At 223 hours 37 minutes, this is Mission Control Houston.
2243700|PAO|This Is Apollo Control at 224 hours 37 minutes. The Command Module America is behind the Moon at this time in its 69th lunar revolution. All systems looked good as they were monitored here prior to loss of signal. The crew is asleep with 3 hours 42 minutes remaining in this rest period. On awaking, the crew will continue to perform orbital science experiments and photography until approximately 5:30 p.m. Central Standard Time today when the translunar insertion burn will be made and America and its crew will be on the way back to Earth. Approximately 30 minutes ago an attempt to turn on the lunar surface television camera was unsuccessful. The reason the camera did not respond to ground commands is not known at this time and another attempt to activate the camera probably will be made later today. At 224 hours 38 minutes this is Mission Control Houston.
2253700|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 225 hours 37 minutes. Command Module America is on its 70th lunar revolution and in a few minutes will be over the Taurus-Littrow landing site. The crew is still asleep with 2 hours 42 minutes remaining in this rest period. About 5 minutes ago, a second attempt was made to activate the television camera on the lunar surface, again, without success. Another attempt may be made later today, and probably one attempt a day will be made for the next several days. At 225 hours 37 minutes, this is Mission Control Houston.
2263700|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 226 hours 37 minutes Apollo 17 is behind the Moon on its 70th revolution. Flight Director, Neal Hutchenson and the Gold Team are preparing to relieve Flight Director, Pete Frank and the Orange Team at this time. There will be no change of shift News Conference. The crew has been in a rest period since shortly after the Orange shift came in for flight control duties. One hour, 42 minutes remaining in the crew rest period. We've had no conversation with the crew since the rest period began and all spacecraft systems are operating normally. Attempts at approximately 5:00 and 6:30 AM to turn on the lunar surface television camera were unsuccessful. The reason why the camera failed to respond to ground commands is not known. And further attempts to activate the camera will be made. At 226 hours 38 minutes this is Mission Control, Houston.
2273700|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 227 hours 37 minutes Ground Elapsed Time in the mission of Apollo 17. Spacecraft America now about a third of the way across the front face of the moon in revolution 71. Forty two minutes remaining until the crew is wakened. Some 50 minutes until the spacecraft passes behind the moon. In other words the wake-up call will be made some 8 minutes prior to loss of signal on this front side pass. And the crew will start their preparations for a fairly busy day of orbital science tasks and photography. And the transearth injection burn late this afternoon. Presently the spacecraft is in a 61.8 by 66.1 nautical mile lunar orbit. Current velocity 5,344 feet per second. We'll bring up the air-ground circuit just prior to the wake up call and follow the balance of the day's activities live and as they happen. And at 221:38 - 227:38 Ground Elapsed Time this is Apollo Control.
2280900|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 228 hours 9 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, less than a minute away from wakeup, and 19 minutes away from the time the Spacecraft America passes behind the Moon nearing the end of revolution number 71. Current Orbit 66.1 at apocynthion and 61.8 pericynthion, those are nautical miles. We'll stand by here as we wait for the wakeup call from the spacecraft communicator, Bob Overmyer. And whatever the music selection is this morning, which is becoming tradition for wakeup. We'll standby here for wakeup call.
2281101|CC|(Wakeup Music "Come On Baby Light My Fire").
2281358|CC|Good morning, America.
2281447|CC|Good morning, America.
2281538|CC|Good morning, America, and we'd appreciate HIGH GAIN to AUTO so we could talk to you all the way through LOS.
2281549|CDR|Okay. We've got to get the guy on watch up here in a minute.
2281556|CC|Time to put your feet on the floor and a smile on your face and face another day in lunar orbit. The last one.
2281608|CDR|They're there, but our fellow on watch is still asleep.
2281612|CC|Roger. Would you like to play the music again to wake him up?
2281619|CDR|Apparently it has no affect. Good choice, though.
2281626|CC|We're going to light your fire today, babe.
2281631|CDR|Okay, let me try to get AUTO without waking him. Stand by.
2281754|CDR|Hey, you better play the punch line of that song again. Nobody believes you did it.
2281825|CC|Gene, just before we get the lunar sound - say again - before we get the recording going again, just remember you'll have to go MANUAL then WIDE in a normal acquisition at AOS. And the angles on the dial are correct.
2281845|CDR|Okay.
2281848|CMP|Hey, good morning.
2281851|CC|Sound a little groggy.
2281857|LMP|Good morning, Robert. How are you doing this morning?
2281901|CC|Things are great. Stand by.
2281906|LMP|Navy groggy, I think's what you mean.
2281918|CC|(Music: "Light My Fire")
2281948|CC|That's for the CMP. Do you believe it now?
2281954|CMP|Yes, I heard it that time.
2281959|CDR|Beautiful, Bob. We're going to get your picture as you set this time. Right out number ...
2282023|CC|Is that from onboard?
2282029|CDR|Say again, Bob.
2282031|CC|Did you have that tape onboard or is that just a back - But we've got the song again in our background here. Or do you all have that?
2282040|CDR|No, we had it; and I think it's very appropriate for today. And that's exactly what we're going to do.
2282046|CMP|No, we didn't play it back to you.
2282048|CC|Okay, it's just ... comm - -
2282050|LMP|That was those other guys.
2282457||America, Houston. You've got about 3-1/2 minutes until LOS, and you're looking good. All systems look good to us. And have a good breakfast, and we'll see you on the other side.
2282511|SC|Okay, Houston, ...
2282554||BEGIN LUNAR REV 72
2282555|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal as Apollo 17 spacecraft, America, coasted behind the moon nearing the end of revolution number 71. A briefing on Apollo 17 lunar surface science will begin momentarily in the main auditorium - repeat, main auditorium at MSC. The briefing likely will last into the next rev at least. The air-ground communications will be taped and played back at the conclusion of the lunar surface science press briefing. And at 228:28 Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
2291314|CC|America, Houston. Realize you're eating and don't want to interrupt you, but if you get your headsets on, we'll give you some news.
2291325|CMP|Sound great, Houston. We'd appreciate that.
2291325|CDR|Go ahead, Bob, we're listening to you.
2291326|CC|Okay, let's give you the really important news first. Went around the horn here, and over in Nassau Bay, everybody's doing real fine, and it looks like Tracy's going to go out and visit one of our bigger amusement centers around the country and going to have a great day. And everybody just looking forward to the EVA and the deorbit and the splash. Out in El Lago - everybody's fine out there, Ron. And John's out selling Christmas trees today and Jaime's going to go out shopping with her aunt sometime today and - a little Christmas shopping - it's getting near that time of year. And one of your friends from Phoenix is due in today, for the rest of the mission, I guess. And out in Tucson, it was a little early this morning, Jack, but everybody's up and about and I talked to your mother, and everybody's fine. She's getting anxious to go back to Silver City and see all the celebration. I guess those people out there are really enjoying it and really getting wild about it. But everybody's fine all the way around, all the way around.
2291434|CDR|Thank you. Bob.
2291436|CC|Okay, we'd like REACQ and NARROW.
2291438|LMP|We're fine up here and I'm sure you told them that.
2291442|CC|Oh, I didn't have to tell them that. They're listening. They heard everything already this morning - at all three places.
2291451|CDR|Well, we send our good morning on our last wakeup day from the Moon.
2291457|CC|Okay. Here is a summary of the late news as compiled in the MSC Public Affairs Office. if you'd like it, we're ready to go with it.
2291509|LMP|Okay, we'd love to have it. Go ahead.
2291511|CC|Okay, everyone - everybody is talking about the success of the Apollo 17 mission here in Houston, and the weather. It was cold this morning. Some thermometers in the Houston metropolitan area were in the mid-20's. The lowest official temperature for the city of Houston was 31. I might add Ellington had a record 29. A huge high pressure system is dominating the midsection of the nation. Barometric pressure reached a high of 30.7 in the Houston area this morning at about 5:00 a.m. With strong gusty winds, the chill factor was a 5 above in Houston, and about a minus 10 degrees in Galveston. Man, that's cold. The national Christmas tree was lighted last night in Washington by Vice President Spiro Agnew. A small crowd, braving cold and rainy weather, watched, as the Vice President threw the switch to light up the 70-foot spruce that came from Medicine Bow, Wyoming. During the ceremony, Mr. Agnew said we must remember the many servicemen who are missing in action or prisoners of war in Indochina and pray for them this holiday season. North Vietnamese peace talk negotiator Le Duc Tho has told newsmen he is very optimistic about prospects for an early cease fire in Vietnam. Before leaving Paris, Le Duc Tho said he will remain in very close contact with Dr. Henry Kissinger. Dr. Kissinger is in Washington. A Paris radio station has said a peace pact signing is imminent, but the report has been denied in Washington. Former Treasury Secretary John Connally says he expects to get a call from President Nixon shortly to carry out some foreign visits this coming year. One assignment may be a visit to Moscow. John Scali, a former newsman from ABC and a special consultant to President Nixon, is expected to be the next U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. a formal announcement from the White House is expected in a few days. An explosion has taken the lives of 21 men in West Virginia. The blast occurred at a steel-making complex near Weirtown, West Virgina, on the Ohio River. President Nixon has given the green light for a pay raise for all Federal employees. The across-the-board increase of 5.14 percent will benefit both civilian and armed forces personnel. A 747 jumbo jet, while taking off out of Miami International yesterday, went through a flock of birds and reportedly lost - had an engine go out. The pilot turned the aircraft around and went out over the Atlantic and burned down some fuel and landed at Miami, but skidded off the runway, hit a concrete culvert, and sheared the nose gear. A few passengers fainted, but only 4 were injured when they went down the slide. The unexpected always deserves some attention. The small community of Westwood, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City, will send back a check it has received from the Federal government in the Federal-revenue-sharing program. Mayor Joe Dennis said Westwood just didn't need the money. On the regional and local scene - I just might add - I see it's not here, that President Truman's condition seemed to deteriorate some last night, but he is still not listed on the critical list, he is serious. Miss Ima Hogg, the 90-year-old founder of the Houston Symphony, was honored at a gala birthday party last night and cake-cutting ceremony at the symphony. And little Tomball, Texas, has had police trouble, but nearby Pasadena doesn't seem to have any. Thirteen new pretty policewomen have just joined the suburban police force out in Pasadena. And Jack, here's a special for you. If you ever get tired of cracking rocks, why not try politics? A geologist, J. Leonard Davidson, is going to run for mayor of Houston during the 1973 election. And we also received word this morning that an elementary school in Silver City, New Mexico, is being renamed for their most illustrious graduate. It will now be the Harrison H. Schmitt Elementary School in Sliver City, New Mexico. A couple new college coaches have been named- Dave Smith has been named the new coach of Southern Methodist. Up in West Lafayette, Indiana, a veteran coach has been named to improve football fortunes at Purdue. Alex Agase, former head coach at Northwestern, will take over the Boilermakers. Kent Nix is expected to get the nod as starting quarterback for the Oilers against the Cincinnati Bengals in the final game of the year. Pastorini is still out with a pulled hamstring muscle. The Houston Rockets dropped their basketball game with the Baltimore Bullets last night by a score of 94 to 91. Purdue beat Western Kentucky last night 91 to 75. Friendswood High School was eliminated last night in the Class II-A semifinals as they bowed to Boling at Rice Stadium 33 to 7. And a final in the news today, Marian Rice Hart, the 81-year-old American aviatrix, says she has at least two more years left for flying. Mrs. Hart is currently flying around the world in a single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza. She is presently in Katmandu, India. That's all from Editor Jim Kukowski here. A special hello from the Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network crew around the world.
2292039|CDR|Thank you, Bob, and our hello and thank you to the tracking team. We sure have been able to work well with them, and communications have been super.
2292054|CC|That's real great. I'm sure those words will be appreciated up at Goddard, and around the world, of course.
2292102|CDR|Well, like a lot of other people - you know, you can't do it without them.
2292136|LMP|Bob, this is Jack. My appreciation and thanks, for an unnecessary honor, to Silver City.
2292142|CC|Roger, I'm sure they're listening out there, and just glad to do it.
2292850|CMP|Hey, Houston; America. How do you read. now?
2292857|CC|Read you loud and clear, Ron.
2292900|CMP|Okay, I've got the Commander's menu for you.
2292903|CC|We're listening.
2292905|CMP|Okay, day 10, spiced oat cereal, mixed fruit, cinnamon toast and bread cubes, instant breakfast, tea, grape juice, and bacon squares, vitamin. For lunch, frankfurters, two pieces of bread, catsup, orange drink, and a package of pecans. Okay, for meal C, turkey and gravy, orange juice, and lemonade. Okay, for the medical log - commander's - 17052, 5 hours of very good sleep, no medication, and three cans of water. Okay, for the old LMP. Food: cinnamon toast and bread, instant breakfast, coffee, fruit cake, grape drink, peach ambrosia. Meal B, frankfurters, one piece of bread, orange drink, sugar cookies, grape drink, and coffee. Meal Charlie, turkey and gravy, caramel candy, and orange juice. Okay, LMP medical log - the old PRD is still at the bottom of the sack down there. Had about 5 hours of sleep, no medication, and two cans of water. Okay, the Command Module Pilot had to eat: spiced oat cereal, mixed fruit, instant breakfast, coffee, grape punch, cinnamon toast and cubes, brownies, vitamin. For lunch, four frankfurters, two pieces of bread, catsup, chocolate pudding, grape drink, coffee. Meal C, turkey and gravy, chocolate bar, orange beverage, and pork and potatoes. Okay, CMP medical log -15050, about 5 hours of sleep, pretty good - once I got to sleep. For medication, two sniffs of nosedrops, each side, prior to retiring, and four cans of water. Over.
2293243|CC|Roger, Ron; we got all that.
2293249|CMP|Okay.
2293254|CC|Ron, could I jog your memory a minute back to the HF antenna extension period after docking?
2293306|CMP|Go ahead. We'll try.
2293308|CC|Roger, Ron. We've been chasing a data dropout glitch and we just wonder - trying to cover all bets. When you were extending HF ANTENNA 1, could have you gone to operate on the immediate switch next to it, which is the LUNAR SOUNDER switch which was right next to 1? Could you have gone to OPERATE for a minute or 2 without realizing it while your hold - holding 1 to EXTEND?
2293337|LMP|Stand by, Bob. Which extension anomaly are you talking about, the one prior to rendezvous?
2293345|CC|No, the one after rendezvous and docking when we were putting them - they're out now and when we put them out - when we were putting them out and were extending HF ANTENNA 1, the LUNAR SOUNDER OPERATE switch is immediately next to it, and I realize HF ANTENNA 1 is a momentary switch. When you were holding it there, could you have gone to OPERATE on that LUNAR SOUNDER switch?
2293407|LMP|Bob, I don't think so. I - no. No, I don't think so.
2293413|CC|Okay, we'll keep track of that.
2293414|LMP|I would have had to - I would have had to been gone - I would have had to been gone to the OFF position too, I guess, right after that, and I think I'd remember that.
2293429|CC|Yes, that's affirm. You would have had to go to OFF, there. And I didn't feel it, but Joe needs - you know we got a data glitch - it's nothing serious - no problem - but they're just back there trying to track down all little glitches and that - that seemed to be the only thing that could add up right now.
2293444|LMP|Sure, I - I understand. I understand. Yes.
2293450|CDR|Hey, Bob, have you had any more charge firings on the surface?
2293458|CC|I don't believe so. When I came on shift, they mentioned that the LCRU wasn't working right now, and they were trying to work it.
2293515|CC|Okay, just for an update, we fired 6 and 7 last night and we'll be firing 1 at about 1 o'clock this afternoon.
2293525|LMP|They all went off okay, huh?
2293527|CC|Yes, and 4, 1, and 8 go off today. And we're seeing good results, Jack, on all the data.
2293540|LMP|Okay, has Bob Kovach gotten any depth to the debris cover or to anything below it yet?
2293553|CC|Let me check that out before I give it to you, piecemeal here. We'll check it out.
2293644|LMP|I realize that's pushing a little bit, but I'm curious.
2294006|LMP|Bob, how do you read 17?
2294010|CC|Read you loud and clear, Jack.
2294014|LMP|Okay. I'm looking right down the slope of the South Massif, above the slide right now - right down at the - just about the angle of the slope. And there's a very slight indentation in the slope, just opposite the maximum - the point of maximum extent of the dark - light mantle. Opposite other portions of it, though, it - there's no clear indication of any change in the direction of the Massif - front. It's very, very slight, and I'd say you'd have a hard time saying that it - that it is a source area for the light mantle but it's - there's a slight indentation there.
2294111|CC|Roger.
2294115|LMP|Bob, just north of the - of the bright-rayed craters in the Littrow area, there are five craters - oh, probably in the thousand meter diameter class range, 500 to 1000, and all five of those have the sequence of colors in the walls, from rim down, of a brown-gray - blue-gray and then brown-gray. They are all identical in that sequence and quite clear.
2294204|CC|Roger.
2294204|LMP|And that blue-gray is comparable to the blue-gray that's visible in the craters such as Sherlock in the landing area. And along the graben, in the vicinity of those five craters, there is a series of very black spots, I'm going to have to look at again on the next pass, if we can. I don't have any idea what those spots are, but I'm looking very obliquely now to that graben and it's extremely - black spots along that graben.
2294249|CC|Roger.
2295042|CC|Ron, NOUN 26 doesn't require a sign.
2295049|CMP|Thank you, Bob.
2295054|CDR|I've heard more about this P20 on this side of the tunnel this mission than I ever could have.
2295102|CC|Roger. Looks like you guys are ready to go to work.
2295112|CDR|Well (laugh). Yes, we are. We're ready to do anything you want to do.
2295118|CC|Okay, we need ACCEPT. Got you a CSM state vector.
2295127|CDR|Okay, sock it to us.
2295131|CC|Okay, it's on its way. Going down the Flight Plan, we've got a Flight Plan update If you're ready to copy. It isn't too awful long, although it's not the easiest one.
2295143|CDR|Go ahead, Bob.
2295147|CC|Okay. At 230:20, 230:20, add the following: "LASER ALTIMETER, OFF; LA, OFF."
2295201|LMP|Just keeping pressing on, Bob. I'll get them and let you know if I get them all.
2295205|CC|Okay. At 230:20, "LASER ALTIMETER, OFF." At 230:29, add "Verify all VHF, OFF." At 230:31, delete "WASTE WATER DUMP." At 230:40, scratch out "LMP" and put "CDR don biomed harness." Just put "CDR" in place of "LMP".
2295241|CDR|Hey, that was a Flight Plan update we passed on yesterday. I've got those.
2295246|CC|Okay, just keep going down the line here. At 231:29, change "Check LMP biomed" to "Check Commander biomed. And change "CDR doff" to "CMP doff". Okay. And the computer's yours, by the way, you can go back to BLOCK. And this is the one important one here. We want to make sure, and I'll explain a little bit. Over at 232:27, 232:27, "If LUNAR SOUNDER, OPERATE, talkback flag goes barber pole, switch LUNAR SOUNDER, OPERATE, to STANDBY." The situation here is that it might run out of film during this lunar sounder HF target on Hertzsprung. If it does, we need to go to STANDBY immediately, and we - it'll probably require somebody monitoring that panel during that 5-to-6 minute pass there. Our best guess is -
2295404|CDR|Okay, Bob.
2295405|CC|Our best guess is we've got a 5-minute pad on that film, but this is just a precaution. And at 233:13, after "PAN CAMERA, POWER," add "V/H OVERRIDE, HIGH ALTITUDE." Okay. That ends the Flight Plan update. I've got a lunar sounder pad.
2295524|CDR|Okay.
2295528|CC|Okay, lunar sounder pad is at 230:55, 230:55-T-start time, 231:00:00; T-stop time is at 07:58.
2295550|CDR|Is that everything, or you got a couple more sounder pads?
2295553|CC|That's the only sounder pad for now.
2295559|CDR|Okay, if - Let me just run it back through you to make sure I got them right.
2295607|CC|Go ahead.
2295612|CDR|Okay. At 230:21, you want the LASER ALTIMETER, OFF. At 230:30, you want to verify all the VHF is OFF. And we want to eliminate the waste water dump at 230:31. The sounder pad on that page is 231:00 and 231:07:58. At 232, following LUNAR SOUNDER, OPERATE, for that pad, if the OPERATE talkback goes barber pole, we want to switch the LUNAR SOUNDER5 OPERATE, to STANDBY, and we'll be monitoring the panel during that time. And at 233:12, following PAN CAMERA to POWER, you want V/H to HIGH ALT.
2295707|CC|That's a good readback, Gene. I have a TEI-75, preliminary TEI-75 PAD for your Update Book.
2295728|CDR|Stand by a second.
2295820|CDR|Go ahead, Bob.
2295822|CC|Okay, that's preliminary TEI-75, SPS/G&N; 36372; plus 0.63, plus 0.86; 236:42:08.58; NOUN 81: plus 3040.3, minus 0183.3, plus 0080.4; 180, 000, 000; HA is not applicable; plus 0023.0; 3046.9, 2:25, 3029.2; sextant star is 06, 109.5, 30.0; boresight, and that is not applicable. NOUN 61: minus 17.89, minus 166.00; 1047.2, 36172; GET of 05 G is 304:18:36. Over on the comments line, Sirius and Rigel; 136, 071, 035. Four jetts, 12 seconds on the ullage. I've got two assumptions or rather two other comments. This pad assumes TEI REFSMMAT. Comment 2: With the liftoff REFSMMAT which you have in, it'll be roll, 179; pitch, 088; yaw, 359. Over.
2300118|CDR|Okay, Bob. TEI-75. preliminary: SPS/G&N; 36372; plus 0.63 plus 0.86; 236:42:06.58; plus 3040.3, minus 0183.3, plus 0080.4; 18O, all zeros, all zeros; HA is NA; plus 0023.0; 3046.9, 2:25, 3029.2; 06, 109.5, 30.0; boresight is NA; minus 17.89, minus 166.00; 1047.2, 36172; 304:18:36. Sirius ana Rigel; 136; 071; 035. Four jet, 12-second ullage. Assume TLI REFSMMAT. If lift-off REFSMMAT, attitude  is 179, 088, 359.
2300230|CC|Real good readback. No problems. Got a consumable update here for you on RCS update. We're right On the Flight Plan: we've got 56 percent remaining. And the O2 and H2 are basically right on the Flight Plan and we've got plenty remaining - no problem on that. And for the Jack - for Jack, for the LMP, I've got a special Flight Plan update on your crew option photo target on Tsiolkovsky. Would you like to copy that?
2300310|LMP|Stand by 1.
2300348|CC|And we'd like HIGH GAIN to AUTO.
2300407|LMP|Okay, Bob. What's this update?
2300411|CC|Okay, Jack, at 232:55 this is the LMP crew option photo target Tsiolkovsky.
2300423|LMP|Go ahead.
2300424|CC|Okay, they're recommending CM-5 to EL 80 or 250 - I guess your option. HBW - maybe I should have used VHBW. I'll check that out, but HBW is what they've got here. Exposure from crew option photo chart as listed, except change 1/250 to 1/500 for the 80-millimeter lens. Change 1/125 to 1/250 for the 250-millimeter lens. Recommend use lunar surface mag Kilo Kilo. That's use lunar surface mag Kilo. Record frame number for start-stop.
2300519|CC|Okay; and I've been corrected. That is HBW. That's one of those surface mags that I guess I don't know anything about. And we would like cryo tank configuration, H2 TANK 3 FANs to OFF; H2 TANK 2 FANs to ON. Over.
2300617|LMP|Okay, you've got that. And the photo pass on mag Kilo, be the 80- or 250-millimeter lens; HBW exposures as per chart except change 1/250 to 1/500 for the 80 and 1/125 to 1/250 for the 250-millimeter lens.
2300639|CC|Roger, Jack.
2300640|LMP|And record the frames.
2300644|CC|Good show.
2300938|LMP|Bob, just had a good view of the sunset and the corona, and there are two strong, bright streamers just right at sunset, one parallel to the plane of the ecliptic and the other - oh, maybe 10 degrees to the south of the plane. And they form two of the major, longer, du - duller streamers that are streaming out from the Sun now. There are some other linear streamers that are still visible, but those were the major ones. Once you get out about to the position of Mars they all have about the same intensity - which is very low.
2301035|CC|Roger.
2301038|LMP|The pattern is distinctly different from the one I believe I mentioned to you yesterday, sometime.
2301044|CC|Roger.
2301044|LMP|It was right at sunset at any rate.
2301050|LMP|Still have a very strong glow visible at the sunset point.
2301055|CC|Roger.
2301055|LMP|And that glow - the - the general glow visible to me now - and of course I'm not very well light -adapted - dark-adapted - but, extends about to a position - oh, let's see - about the same distance from the Sun as the apparent distance of Venus - between Venus and Mars right now. Well, let me - let me start over on that. The apparent distance from Venus to Mars is about the same distance as from Mars to the limit of the strong solar glow.
2301138|CC|See the NOUN 05 - -
2301138|LMP|Bob, when I'm talking about streamers, I'm talking about lin - Say again.
2301144|CC|I said, "We see the NOUN 05." Go ahead, Jack.
2301148|LMP|Okay, I just - when I talk about streamers, I'm talking about each time - very linear bright lines that extend - oh, maybe two or three crate - solar diameters out. And then they merge quite sharply into these very long much duller - streamers that - I guess presumably are zodiacal light.
2301218||Roger, Jack. We see the NOUN 93; you can torque.
2301348|CDR|Okay, we're torquing at 45, now. Bob, we'll go ahead and torque at 230:14.
2301356|CC|Roger.
2302306|LMP|Okay, Houston, are you through with the high gain now?
2302310|CC|Stand by on that. We've just gone around the horn and you're looking real good. Looks like we'll have AOS at 231 about 8 or 7 - right in there. And we are now through with the high gain - -
2302323|SC|... we are - we're reconfiguring now. Okay.
2302443|CC|America, Houston. We didn't see the mapping camera go off. Did you get that one off?
2302450|CDR|That's affirm. We've got MAPPING CAMERA OFF, Bob.
2302453|CC|Okay. Thank you. And your AOS time is updated a little bit - -
2302458|CDR|We've got them all now, We're coming up - -
2302459|CC|- - it's 210:11 - 230:11. Try another one, 231:11.
2302510|CDR|What's at 231:11, Bob?
2302512|CC|That's your AGS time. It's a little bit later than what the Flight Plan shows.
2302519|CDR|Okay, fine. Thank you.
2302523||BEGIN LUNAR REV 73
2303700|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 230 hours 37 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. That completes the 72nd revolution front side pass on a delayed playback. Spacecraft America coming around on revolution 73 in 32 minutes. We'll bring the line back up at that time. And at 230 hours 38 minutes this is Apollo Control.
2310952|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 231 hours 9 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Fifty seconds away from acquisition of signal as America, Spacecraft America comes around the front side of the moon on revolution #73. We'll stand-by as we wait confirmation from the network controller of acquisition of signal. Some initial transearth injection figures coming up later today around 5:33 Central Time. The tentative ignition time for transearth injection is ground elapsed 236:42:08 for posigrade velocity increase of 3046.9 feet per second. Total burn time of 2 minutes 24 seconds on the service propulsion system engine - and we've had acquisition of signal from America. We'll stand by now, for resumption of communications as the spacecraft becomes electronically visible to the tracking stations on Earth.
2311131|CMP|Houston, this is America.
2311135|CC|Hello, America. You're a little scratchy down here. We'll pick you up there shortly.
2311142|CMP|Okay. We'll stand by until then.
2311146|CC|Oh, that's all right. Go ahead. We can near you.
2311152|CMP|Okay. That last lunar sounder pass got an extra 40 seconds on the film - 40 seconds on the last end of it.
2311205|CC|Okay.
2311418|LMP|Okay, Houston. This is America.
2311421|CC|Go ahead.
2311424|LMP|Okay, Bob, I was over there on the right side and I hit the FUEL CELL 1 REACTANTS switch for about half a second and got it back on again. It looks okay here.
2311444|CC|Roger. We copy that.
2311755|CC|America, Houston. If you're reading us loud and clear. I'd like to give you a lunar sounder flight - sounder pad here at 231:21.
2311813|CDR|Okay, Bob. Go ahead.
2311815|CC|Okay; it's at 231:21, the lunar sounder T-start time, 231:26:18; T-stop, 50:33.
2311841|CDR|Okay, I got that. Thank you. You happy with the biomed on the CDR?
2311851|CC|We won't know until we get the high gain here at 21.
2311858|CDR|Okay.
2312033|PAO|This is Apollo Control, for those news men in the MSC news center who want to watch their television monitors they can see a playback of explosive package number 7 if they'll watch the lower left corner of the monitor you'll see a brief glow and then dims out again and that's all there is to see, we'll roll the video tape back through at this time.
2312103|CMP|Houston, America.
2312107|CC|Go ahead, Ron.
2312111|CMP|Okay, here. I was just looking at the Wright Brothers Crater as we were going through there again. And the outer - crater rims on that thing are kind of like the one - ... about rev 62 in the picture, but the outer rim - is sloping in the opposite direction from the normal crater, or something. In other words, the steep slope is on the outside of the rim, and you have a gradual slope up to the - you know, from the center of the crater, you've got a gradual slope up to the rim, and then it drops off to the steep slope on the outside. And the steep slope on the outside is maybe - oh, 35 to 45 degrees. The slope on the inside is probably - somewhere around 20 degrees - would guess. And there is one portion of the rim - kinda of on the western portion of that one that I was lookmg at, anyhow, it's almost a delta-shaped ring.
2312215|CC|Roger, Ron. We're ready for the high gain. If somebody can bring it up, we can read you better.
2312239|CC|How do you read, America? You're sounding great now.
2312247|CMP|Okay; looks like we've got you.
2312249|CC|Real good. Go ahead, Ron.
2312257|CMP|Okay. I was just kind of reminiscing a little bit about the - my mud puddle craters there in Smythii. I guess that's what I can term them or call them - that's what they always kind of looked like to me. But - they slope up. But the rims of those craters and even the interior rims on ones that are multi-ringed, they slope upward from the center of the crater toward the rim, and a gradual slope, and then they drop off on the outside of the crater rim, sloping down from the outside crater up to 45 degrees. And then at some points on there, it almost looks like it's a real classic delta-shaped rim on them, where you have the same slope on the inside as well as the outside of the crater.
2312359|CC|Roger, Ron.
2312409|CDR|Houston, you ready for mode VHF?
2312411|CC|That's affirmative.
2312419|CDR|VHF.
2312527|CMP|Okay; 50 seconds to LUNAR SOUNDER OPERATE, okay? RECORDER is ON; RADAR's ON; we're in VHF, okay. Be a VHF pass. And what time? 26:18. Okay; 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 -
2312622|CMP|MARK it. SOUNDER to OPERATE.
2312721|CC|America, be advised. Gene, your biomed looks good.
2312732||Thank you, Bob.
2312917|CMP|Okay, Houston, frame 163 and 164 and 165 were taken of the mud craters in Smythii. And 166, I guess, was taken of the great slopings - side of the crater in Crisium. That's just south of Yerkes.
2312949|CMP|That's mag November November. Oh, wait a minute. That's Gene's crater, isn't it?
2313033|CC|America, Houston.
2313037|CMP|All right, go ahead.
2313038|CC|Ron, we did not get the HIGH GAIN to NARROW. We have sequence for you which is important to go through so that we do not break lock and lose this lunar sounder VHF data. We would like you to dial in PITCH, minus 45; YAW 5. Go to MANUAL and WIDE. And when you get the signal strength, go to REACQ and then step to the BEAM, NARROW, MEDIUM, and WIDE, or, say again, WIDE, NARROW, MEDIUM.
2313113|CMP|Okay, I'm with you. Okay, I got minus 45 on the PITCH, plus about 5 on the YAW - -
2313122|CC|That should be minus 45 on the PITCH.
2313127|CMP|Isn't that what I said? That's what I got. Minus 45. And plus 5 on the YAW, right?
2313134|CC|Affirmative. And we're ready for you to do it. Go ahead.
2313138|CMP|And we're going to MANUAL and WIDE.
2313155|CMP|How's that?
2313157|CC|That's great; we didn't drop any. That's great.
2313202|CMP|Okay.
2313209|CDR|Hello, Bob.
2313210|CC|Go ahead.
2313214|CDR|Okay, this is Gene. I've got a - a very interesting crater out in Tranquillity I'd like to pass some info on for you - to you on. It's about in the central part of Tranquillity. It's got a very sharply raised lip, and it's got some very dark - rough rimmed deposits. It's got a - a very, very obvious ... furrow, looks like it's elongated, basically to the - generally to the east and to the west. I can't tell, but because of the shape of it, and because of those a ... darker rim deposits I'm sure there must be a vent there somewhere, but it's too dark down in there. I can't really see for sure whether there is one or not. But, if there is, I imagine it's pretty big. And I can't tell., it's only sort of intuitive, but I imagine the elongation was produced during the thrust of the initial dynamics, the formation of the impact.
2313324|CC|Roger, Gene. Do you have a scale on the size of the crater?
2313337|CDR|Stand by 1 and let me look.
2313401|CDR|Bob, yes, I may have said Tranquillity. I meant Fecunditatis. I did not mean Tranquillity.
2313409|CC|Copy.
2313429|CDR|Bob, I'll have to give you an estimate on the - on the relative size of it, but the length-to-width ratio is probably about 2 to 1, and it - it's certainly bigger than the Camelot size range.
2313443|CC|Roger. That's good. Just wanted to pin it down for you.
2313448|CDR|... might be able to pick it out. Okay.
2313504|CC|And whoever's got the Flight Plan in their hand, I've got a lunar sounder pan which is at 232:20 and a pan camera pad, which is at 233:20.
2313516|CDR|Okay, Bob. I'm keeper of the left-hand side plus the manager of the Flight Plan. here, so pass it up.
2313524|CC|Okay. Lunar sounder pad. T-start time, 232:26:11; T-stop time, 34:18.
2313551|CDR|Okay, 26:11 34:18.
2313554|CC|Okay, pan camera photo pad, which is over at 233:20: T-start time, 233:24:07; T-stop, 38:42.
2313615|CDR|233:24:07, 38:42.
2313619|CC|Roger. Good copy.
2314100|CC|17, just for your information, it's Miami 3, Baltimore noth - about mid-way - nothing - they're about midway through the first quarter, and Miami's making an effort to go undefeated today.
2314115|CDR|It's the last game of the season, isn't it?
2314117|CC|That's right. This will be the undefeated season if they hack it.
2314156|CMP|Houston, America. I think I mentioned - a couple or 3 days ago that - however, when we first got up here - that I had a heck of a time seeing that Tycho ray that goes out across Bessel. And I forgot to tell you that yesterday, kind of for the first time, it really started showing up when we were getting up in the higher Sun. And today, it really shows up quite vividly. It's just a ray that takes off from the edge of Crisium and goes right across Bessel and goes out to about the middle of Crisium - I don't mean Crisium, I mean Serenitatis, I was talking about Serenitatis all the time.
2314234|CC|Roger.
2314252|LMP|Say, Bob. Those craters on the south-western side of Serenitatis still have got that orange hue at this Sun angle, and that's with the naked eye.
2314303|CC|Roger. These are the ones right in the Sulpicius Gallus region?
2314317|LMP|Yes.
2314442|CMP|And, Houston; 166 and 167 were taken of a crater that looks like it's got a reddish dike in it and it's on - in the - again in the Haemus Mountains to the west of Sulpicius Gallus.
2314501|LMP|Houston, a little more on that. It's an impact crater with a line essentially across the diameter in a east-west direction, maybe a little bit north of west direction and the ejecta to the north of that - just went under us - the ejecta to the north of the line is the orange - actually more red-brown than orange, although there are both hues in it - -
2314532|CC|Roger, Jack. Can you give us some scale on that crater?
2314532|LMP|- - looks similar to - Yes, it's about a 600-meter crater. And it looks very much like - in it's geologic pattern to the - that crater out in the Nevada test site on Buckboard Mesa that had an explosion along a contact between two very sharply contrasting rock types. In this case, however, the line does not go completely across the crater, and that's why we feel it may be a dike or a vein which fortuitously has been hit by that impact.
2314625|CC|Okay; can you give me a little relationship with respect to Sulpicius Gallus, the crater?
2314632|LMP|Yes, I'll try to spot it in a minute.
2314634|CC|Okay, why don't you just mark it on your map so for pre - postflight we'll have it.
2314740|LMP|On the - somewhere around - I'll try to spot it more exactly - on the 20 north latitude line and about 7 east on a ridge. It's right on top of a ridge. I think it's that ridge. I'll try to spot it more exactly later.
2314801|CC|Okay.
2314937|CC|Ron, you're less than a minute to LUNAR SOUNDER STANDBY T-stop time.
2314944|CMP|Okay, we're on it, Bob. ...
2315053|CC|And, America, just a reminder. When you're powering the SIM bay, up here again, the mapping camera laser altimeter cover is already open and the mapping camera is already extended.
2315105|CDR|Okay. Thank you.
2315125|CDR|Okay, Bob. We'll just eliminate those last two steps, is that correct?
2315130|CC|That's affirmative.
2315134|CDR|Okay. You still want MAPPING CAMERAS, STANDBY, up there in the fourth step?
2315139|CC|That's affirm.
2315204|CDR|Okay, Houston. The SIM bay is powered up. We eliminated the last two steps.
2315212|CC|Roger. Thank you, Gene.
2315234|CDR|Okay, Houston. I guess you saw those - we got through those procedures and you probably saw most of the switching. Sorry, I should have been in VOX.
2315244|CC|No problem.
2315322|PAO|This is Apollo Control we're going to repeat the playback of the video tape of the explosive package number 7. Down in the - This will be the final time it will be played back. If you'll look in the lower left corner behind a slight ridge, you'll see a glow part way through the playback. Let's watch the playback now.
2315538|LMP|Houston, this is 17.
2315542|CC|Go ahead.
2315547|LMP|One of the questions we asked ourselves years ago, when we mapped the Copernicus area, was were we really seeing dark mantling deposits on some of the massifs of the Carpathians, and looking at it obliquely here, it - some of those areas that we've mapped as dark mantling are distinctly brownish gray versus the normal tan gray of the - of most of the Carpathians. It looks like - and it's about the same color as - extrapolating - as the dark mantle around Sulpicius and Taurus-Littrow.
2315637|CC|Roger.
2315641|LMP|Also, the north boundary of the Carpathian Massifs has a very sharply defined high lava marks - and if that's actually what we're seeing. And in - I'll mark the place on the map, but it looks like it extends about a sixth to an eighth of the way up the highest peak. It's quite a striking and obvious mark. There's a major textural change - below the mark of a little scarp that defines it, the texture is very smooth. Above that it has the lineated and typical mountain front texture for the Apennine - for the Imbrium range.
2315736|CC|Roger.
2315859|LMP|Bob, I might summarize my impression of the rilles in the vicinity of Euler and their relationship to the mare ridges. I've been able to, over the last day - just generally searching it out, I've been able to find rilles that clearly cross and separate portions of ridges. And ridges that clearly cross and partially bury rilles. And in another third case of a rille that appears to be levied - that is, have banks of - flat banks on either side, but near the end of it, it transitions into a mare ridge, very clearly. It looks as if, to me, that the rille and ridge problem in here is just one of repetitive compression and extension within the surficial flows of the Imbrium Basin. And that possibly during the compressive stages, there were extrusions locally along the ridge system, but in the main part, the ridge systems do represent, I think, a doming it looks like just a doming of the mare surface except for these local ridgelike extrusions.
2320031|CC|Roger.
2320032|LMP|I might also add that the rilles, to me, seem to be made up of zigzag straight line segments rather than being truly sinuous. They appear sinuous because of the rounding of the corners, but in - my impression is that they're really made up of straight line segments.
2320244|CMP|And, Houston, on mag Victor Victor - Oh - well, I'm on number 28 now, and the last ones before 28 there were taken of the spacecraft sunset terminator.
2320302|CC|Roger, Ron. Jack, we just had a feed-in to your answer to your question from ALSEP. The PI has not seen enough data at this time to draw any conclusions regarding the depth of the mantle in the landing area. And we've got another bomb charge due to go off here in about - a short time; let me check it.
2320329|LMP|Okay, I'll wait until we get back. Thank you.
2320334|CC|Roger.
2320356|CC|That next charge goes off in 15 minutes, Jack. I don't have an exact GET yet.
2320409|CDR|Bob, is the LCRU still working?
2320418|CC|Say again, please.
2320423|CDR|Bob, this is Geno. I was just wondering if the LCRU and the TCU were still working?
2320430|CC|They think the LCRU failed last-night.
2320449|CC|Gene, they are going to try it again today, but they could not get a - raise it last night and they think it failed.
2320500|CDR|Okay.
2320520|CC|We'd like AUTO on the HIGH GAIN, please.
2321455|LMP|Houston, 17.
2321458|CC|Go ahead.
2321503|LMP|Has Mark come up with a preliminary heat flow number yet or is he still equilibrating?
2321521|CC|We'll check that, Jack.
2321553|CC|Jack, nothing on that - the heat flow yet. It's still stabilizing, it'll be a while before they get many data. But we're watching the data play out here on the TV screen. They just had another one of those charges go off and it really does rap the old heaters.
2321614|LMP|Excellent.
2321850|CDR|Houston, MAPPING CAMERA is OFF; and the IR's OFF; PAN CAMERA SELF TEST, OFF; UV is OFF; and the DATA SYSTEM'S OFF; and SM/AC POWER is OFF.
2321924|CC|Okay, we - I think - We copy that configuration change there. We're about 6 minutes to LOS. Just - on the next pass, just be advised, we're going to change the HF antenna retract times to let them warm up a little bit more. We'll call you on that before we want the HF antennas retracted. And just an update, it's Miami 10 to nothing over Baltimore at the half.
2321952|CDR|Okay, we'll stand by on a call on the retraction and got the score 10 to nothing.
2322042|CDR|Hello, Houston; America. When do want us to configure the DSE? Do you want us to wait a couple minutes?
2322048|CC|Roger. We'd like you to wait a couple minutes.
2322053|CDR|Okay, we'll stand by for your call on DSE and the HIGH GAIN.
2322131|CMP|Houston, America; are you giving any odds on the time we might get the barber pole on the lunar sounder?
2322139|CC|We don't think you'll get it this group but that pad is now about a 4-minute pad. But it's getting so close I'd like to watch it.
2322149|CMP|Oh, Okay.
2322235|CC|America, if we should lose you before our published LOS here, check the DSE and when you get the barber pole, you can reconfigure. We're rewinding that tape now.
2322251|LMP|Yes, sir.
2322259|CC|Okay; it's all rewound. You can go ahead ana configure the DSE.
2322522|CMP|Say, Bob, what about us configuring high gain. We're getting close to T-start.
2322527|CC|Roger. Go ahead.
2322528||BEGIN LUNAR REV 74
2322539|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 232 hours 25 minutes Ground Elapsed Time in the mission of Apollo 17. Spacecraft America has just gone behind the Moon on revolution number 73 running the last lunar sounder pass in lunar orbit. The spacecraft will reappear again the start of rev - revolution 74 in approximately 48 minutes. We'll rejoin the conversation live when it resumes next revolution. And at 232:26 Ground Elapsed Time this is Apollo Control.
2330848|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 233 hours 8 minutes, Ground Elapsed Time. Starting front-side pass of revolution number 74 mission of Apollo 17. 40 seconds remaining until spacecraft acquisition by the antennas of the tracking network. Approximately 3 and a half hours until the spacecraft leaves lunar orbit for the trip back to Earth. To reiterate the current predicted times of and values of the transearth injection maneuver, ignition time currently estimated at Ground Elapsed Time of 236 hours 42 minutes 8 seconds. Burn time of 2 minutes 24 seconds for a velocity increase in posigrade of 3046.9 feet per second. We have Apollo 17 acquired on the high gain apparently right around the corner.
2331030|CC|Hello America. Houston is standing by.
2331038|CMP|Hey, America - Houston, this is America. We've got you loud and clear. A little late on picking you up that time, but worked okay. Okay, on mag Q, Quebec - it's finished right now, and whatever frame number it was on when they left the lunar surface to 143. Q? Oh, K. Mag Kilo, okay. Whatever frame they were on on the lunar surface to 143 were selected shots by the LMP. Frame 143 to 172 were near-side terminator photos of Tsiolkovsky.
2331134|CC|Okay, Ron. We copy that right from the Flight Plan change.
2331139|CMP|Okay. And PAN CAMERA to STEREO - Jack, ... help me get it. Verify STANDBY on STEREO. Okay, PAN CAMERA POWER coming ON. Oops, stand by here. Okay. V over H, HIGH ALTITUDE. Okay, PAN CAMERA to POWER. Okay, got the power. Okay, we've got a T-start coming up here at 24:07, 12 minutes. ... suppose that's what it should be ... yes, ... Tsiolkovsky. Let's see, Houston, America. I only have one pan camera pad here. is that correct?
2331244|CC|Let me see. We've got one sitting right in front of us for 233:40. Do you want that one?
2331259|CMP|I don't have that one.
2331301|CC|Yes.
2331301|CMP|I've got the one that starts at 24:07, and ends at 38:42.
2331307|CC|That's correct, and you don't have the other one because we never said it. We've got here ready to go.
2331314|CMP|Oh, okay.
2331317|CC|Okay, T-start time, 233:48:15; T-stop is 234:00:30
2331341|CMP|Okay, photo pad is - T-start is 233:46:15, T-stop is 234:00:30.
2331350|CC|Roger, Ron. And let me give you some words here that you might be interested in. Right now we're looking at probably pulling in those antenna at 233:45 or 46, right in that time frame. If those maneuvers - that should not work, we shall have to jettison the antennas at around 234:3 - 235:39. We have, and we won't give it to you until we need it. We have a VERB 49 maneuver to a jett attitude for 234:25, and that'll keep in that attitude and then we'll jettison the antennas at 235:43, and, of course, we'll have to bring up the logic power on those. We have this all available standing by and there's no sense passing it until we find out how the antennas do on RETRACT.
2331446|CMP|Okay, that sounds reasonable. Do you have the, cr you want to use, the page in the Experiments Checklist there?
2331511|CC|Roger. Except for the NOUN 78s. We'll change those.
2331517|CMP|Oh, okay. Sounds good.
2331533|CMP|It's in the Volkswagen pocket. Okay.
2331553|CMP|I don't think we ever changed it though. Okay, the arrow's there, which indicates that we didn't do it. Okay, LIOH canister change, 19 into A, take 17 and put it into A - A-4. That's correct.
2331716|CMP|At 24, we want the pan camera.
2331722|LMP|Bob, while we're waiting for the pan camera time, a quickie here. One of the ways that seems be useful for determining the relative age of the larger basins, to me anyway, is the abundance of block fields on the slopes of the walls or the slopes of the central peaks. That abundance decreasing with increasing age, and one of the comparisons that I just made that it looks as if Tsiolkovsky and Sklodowska have about the same abundance of - of block fields on both those features of the crater.
2331811|CMP|Okay, canister's changed.
2331812|LMP|They presumably then would be about the same age.
2331818|CC|Roger, Jack. I noted that.
2331826|CMP|Jack, to me, Sklodowska is lot more subdued, though, than Tsiolkovsky on the ... Oh, okay. It's ... criteria? Yes.
2331947|CMP|And, Houston, the northern most - I hate to use mud impact, but that's what I'll call it, multiring basin structure there and it also has a delta-shaped rim to it. There is kind of a moat between the inner ring and the outer ring and then it slopes, again a gradual slope from the center of the crater up to the first basin ring and with a steeper slope on the outside of the first ring going down into the moat. And then the outer ring has the delta - the delta-shaped rim to it.
2332026|CC|Roger. Ron, we copy that.
2332028|CMP|Okay, 4 minutes to - and, Bob, you'll keep us honest on this pan camera T-start, won't you?
2332039|CC|I sure will.
2332042|CMP|Okay; thank you.
2332130|CMP|And, Houston, Surgeons may be interested to know CMPs blue bag number 5 was comparable to ground test number 3.
2332150|CC|Roger, Ron.
2332219|CMP|I think I should probably add a no problems note.
2332224|CC|Understand, no problems.
2332229|CMP|That's affirmative (laughter). The LMP would like to make a comment, but I won't let him.
2332247|CC|Things pretty miserable up there?
2332253|CMP|For a while it was.
2332303|CC|Ground test bag number 3 wasn't the one you had to drive in with, was it?
2332310|CMP|Yes.
2332327|CC|You're 30 seconds to T-start time on that pan camera.
2332333|CMP|Okay, PAN CAMERA to OPERATE at 07. Jack, I'll give you a mark on that.
2332404|CMP|Okay, 1, 2, 3, start at 7, 4, 5, 6 -
2332411|CMP|MARK it. Okay, stop will be 38:42. And, Houston, how would you like to have a VERB 74?
2332425|CC|Roger; we're standing by for it.
2332430|CMP|Okay, VERB 74 ENTER.
2332444|CMP|Now take a good - Yes, I got a picture of one of those with - that star is kind of a classic, I think. Can you get it? I can get it right here, a lot easier, Jack. Yes, that's all right, I can do it. Lay down beside it. There we go. That's 8 at 1/250; that'll be good. Okay, is that what we call Star? Okay, that's right, I didn't think this was Star. That's the one I was talking about having the polygonal base on it and it's west of Mare Smythii for sure. I don't know where we - directly south of - eastern edge of Fecunditatis. And that's frame number 14, I guess, of mag Papa Papa.
2332709|CC|Ron, if you'll give us ACCEPT, we'll give you your TEI REFSMMAT.
2332716|CMP|Outstanding. You have ACCEPT.
2332726|LMP|And, while we are getting a TEI REFSMMAT, there's a fairly striking graben on the very north edge of Fecunditatis, south of Crisium - just south of Crisium. And it starts in the west within the Fecunditatis Mare and then curves gradually up through the Sculptured Hills structure to the north. And, there's a crater, looks like a subdued impact crater, right on that structure, and you can see the trace of the graben down the walls - the west wall of the crater and up the east wall. And it does - from directly overhead, it appears to taper downward. The walls of the graben, that is, get closer together as it approaches the bottom of the crater. And on the south wall of the graben, as exposed in the west wall of the crater, there's a fairly sharp - sharply defined white area in the talus.
2332852|CC|America, the computer's yours; you can go to BLOCK.
2332859|CMP|Okay, we're in BLOCK.
2332912|LMP|With the old pan camera running, we probably can find that graben structure in there pretty well.
2332929|CMP|Yes, we ought to get some good pictures. It isn't quite as good that way, but you - do get some pictures anyhow.
2333024|CMP|That's what I was trying to figure out. Houston, what's that big crater we're going over right now in Fecunditatis? It's probably on your map - Yes, Taruntius, that's it. Yes.
2333040|LMP|Speaking of grabens again - how's our pan camera doing?
2333044|CMP|38, and we still got ...
2333047|LMP|Speaking of grabens again, on the southeastern blanket of Taruntius, about a crater radius outward, there's a crater looks like an impact also on a trace of a graben, and in this case the ejecta blanket that extends out along the graben both to the west and to the east is noticeably blue gray against the tan gray of the Fecunditatis or at least the Taruntius ejecta blanket. Basically, it looks like blue-gray wings on the crater along the direction of the graben.
2333147|CC|Roger, Jack.
2333204|LMP|Looking at the crater stratigraphy in the northeastern and northern portions of Tranquility, it looks as if you could say that there are blue-gray mare materials overlying very light gray material of some kind. And, without any strong exceptions that I've seen, and it resembles the same stratigraphy that I think I talked about yesterday on the annulus of Serenitatis and that goes along with what I think Ron told you, that the visual appearance of the annulus and the northern Tranquility Mare, on the surface is indistinguishable .
2333302|CMP|Yes, that's right.
2333310|LMP|It also suggests that the mare in here's relatively thin if you're getting down to whatever the basement rock is, and that's being represented by the light gray. The ledges of the blue-gray material are high up in the crater ana really appear to form only about - oh, a fifth to a sixth of the wall height. And I'll give you a crater - There's a crater right between the two Cauchy rilles that shows this fairly well. And Ross Crater also shows it a little farther along, I remember from last time.
2333406|CMP|Cauchy Crater, isn't it?
2333406|LMP|Yes, Cauchy Crater is the one I was talking about that's between the two rilles. Actually, it's not as well defined in Cauchy as it is in seme of the other craters.
2333447|LMP|The western end of the Cauchy rilles, both north and south ones, seem to have a right lateral or echelon structure, but along the trace still to the west of the crater Cauchy that locally changes to left lateral.
2333526|CMP|And, Houston, even at the high Sun angle here, the ejecta of the - oh, four or five recent craters around Maraldi, still kind of a bluish-gray, light-bluish-gray. The floor of the crater Maraldi is essentially a dark - more of a dark gray today, I guess, than anything. And the ejecta patterns on that are the same albedo and color distinctions as the ones in the landing site. And, the landing site itself, from this angle, I think is going to - No, once we get up at the same viewing angle as we had on Maraldi , the mantling material in the landing site is the same color, same albedo as Maraldi.
2333558|CC|Roger.
2333558|CMP|... In the crater Maraldi.
2333652|CMP|Yes, I get just a tint or - yes, I was going to say, well no, I still get a feeling that there's just a twinge of the orange or tannish orange around Shorty looking at it with the binocs. What's that black bump on the sides - on the -Let's see, south of the southern side of the South Massif. Can you see that one, Jack? ...
2333738|CMP|Okay, we ought to be getting ready for P38. About another minute, Jack. PAN CAMERA to STANDBY. At 38:42.
2333836|CMP|Okay, 35 now and we want to stop it at 42. Okay.
2333844|CMP|MARK it. Okay.
2333848|CC|America, we'd like AUTO on the HIGH GAIN.
2333854|CMP|AUTO it is.
2333856|CC|Ron, the numbers on magazine RR show that you have nine spare frames and you will need nine frames there for calibration, so looks like you'll have nine frames on mag RR for whatever you want to use them on.
2333917|CMP|Okay, let's see now. We have just this next pass coming up here?
2333925|CC|That's affirmative, Ron.
2333926|CMP|... on 85 now. Okay, and Tsiolkovsky, we got those the last time with, on the LM mag is that correct?
2334037|CMP|Hey, Jack, we want to get D-Caldera to high Sun here too. And then, yes, and then the crater with the dike in it, because I think we probably should get those - Yes, Papa Papa, yes. And then as soon as you finished with those, we'll switch mags and I'll whip over there and take some terminator photos. Okay, let's see.
2334116|CMP|Hey, Houston, you sure you want to start retracting the antennas?
2334121|CC|Oh, stand by, Ron. Just to answer your question on mag Romeo Romeo, you can take it to an absolute number of 106 on the frame count, and the remainder must be used for calibration.
2334134|CMP|Okay, then 106 is far as we can go on that one. Okay. Thank you.
2334148|CMP|Fine. Okay.
2334202|CC|America, Houston. After we start the pan camera at 233:48:15, we would like then to go and 3tart to retract HF antenna number 2. Number 2 first, please.
2334218|CMP|Okay. As soon as I get the pan camera started, we'll go to retract on that.
2334248|CMP|Jack, are you talking about the one that's got the red ejecta out to the east? Yes. Right now. Just now looking down there, is that the one you were talking about? Okay. It's just now coming up. ... See. Okay, can you see D-Caldera? Okay.
2334334|CMP|Okay, I'll get it. Yes.
2334410|CMP|Let's see, we're almost at subsolar. Wait a minute, I don't know where we are. Right. We're way past subsolar. Yes, I think.
2334457|LMP|Okay, Houston, on Papa Papa frames - let's see, 13 and 14 were of the crater with the red, brown to orange vein across it, and 15 and 16 were of D-Caldera, stereo pairs.
2334530|CMP|See your dark slide, Jack.
2334544|LMP|And, Houston, I saw at least two other examples of impact craters in the highlands south of Serenitatis and south of - of the Sulpicius area that had vein-like distribution of red-brown or orange material in them.
2334610|CC|Roger.
2334621|CMP|And for terminator, but you want to handle the re-retract of the antenna? No, not yet. Soon we - at 48:15, go to pan camera to operate. Yes, and then we start retracting HF number 2.
2334645|CMP|Ouch!, I cut my finger on the dark slide. Boy, that son of a buck. Yes. That's right. Yes, we'll time it through to start with HF number 2. Be at 8:15, 47:15, 47:20. And, let's see, where does this thing start? 52, I guess. No, 57.
2334811|CMP|Okay, 48:15, stand by. 11, 12, 13, 14 -
2334818|CMP|MARK it. Okay. And, Houston, HF antenna number 2 is going to RETRACT. 3, 1 -
2334830|CMP|MARK it. Barber pole.
2334843|CMP|They can do it down there. But in case ... Let's, see. I think they've been taking about 2 minutes, last time - I forgot for sure. Houston knows. How about long is it supposed to take to retract number 2 this time? (Laughter) Any guesses?
2334906|CC|130 seconds would be nominal retraction.
2334912|CMP|130, huh? Would be nominal. Number 2, yes. No, that's number 1 on your side.
2335009|CMP|That's the one - we had trouble getting it out, the second time, and finally did. Just took a long time to get out there. Yes, we were taking it out and in.
2335056|CMP|Gene, yes, we're doing this now, and we need a T-stop here, at this time - on the pan camera.
2335114|CC|How does the barber pole look up there, boys?
2335115|CMP|..., Gene.
2335119|LMP|It looks gray. Okay, ...
2335121|CC|Okay, that's a full retract.
2335124|CMP|Good. Beautiful.
2335129|LMP|Now you want to do number 1?
2335132|CC|That's affirmative and the time of the other was 1:55.
2335133|LMP|Shall I start on number 1 now?
2335138|LMP|Okay, Houston. Going to RETRACT on number 1.
2335143|LMP|MARK it. Barber pole.
2335147|CDR|Okay, Houston. I get it visually going in.
2335155|CMP|Yes, it doesn't come in very fast, does it?
2335209|CMP|(Laughter)
2335251|CMP|Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.
2335342|CMP|Oh, okay.
2335346|CMP|Boy, okay.
2335421|CC|America, Houston. Go to OFF on the switch where it's stall current. Do you have a barber pole or is it gray?
2335431|CMP|It was still a barber pole. And do you want number 2 OFF, also?
2335447|CC|Stand by, Ron.
2335452|CMP|Just asking.
2335456|CC|That's affirmative, Ron, number 2 to OFF.
2335501|CMP|Okay, number 2 is going to OFF, now?
2335506|CC|Okay, and the preliminary quick look shows a nominal retract on both of them, Ron.
2335513|CMP|Mighty fine. That's good. Although I was - had - getting the camera ready to take some pictures.
2335627|CMP|Well, look at the one down here by - You can pick linear segments if you want to on some of them. One long one that goes all the way across there now, it's got a bunch of - Well, this is a ... synthius [sic] one down right down here. Lock at this one. Right - right down there. See, just this side of that little - the short one.
2335759|CMP|Okay, give me a holler on that pan camera when it comes up because I'm going to be taking pictures here; f/8 at 1/250. Boy, it really shows up a flow from the Tobias Mayer area coming on out to - I don't know whether - is that the Bessel Rille or something like that? I don't know what that Rille is. I agree with you, Jack, in that whatever that rille is, that's running east and west there - made up of linear segments, except for the curves around the corner (laughter).
2335859|CMP|Yes, I think that's Prinz on up there just - Yes, see there. Can you get them back there?
2335907|CDR|Yes.
2335907|CMP|Here, take it. Should - should be - Oh, the lowest one?
2335912|CDR|Yes, on your right-hand side.
2335913|CMP|Oh, well, let me get these first then. Or - can you get those now?
2335917|CDR|Yes.
2335919|CMP|Okay.
2335954|CMP|Here. I'll get the pan camera. That's the lowest one. Yes, that's the terminator, right on the terminator. I got something on it. Okay. Here. Need a hack here, Gene.
2340024|CMP|Okay? Okay, PAN CAMERA to STANDBY.
2340035|CDR|You got it?
2340035|CMP|Yes. What's my frame number here? Oh, wait a minute. It's 105. We'll take one more picture.
2340049|CC|Ron, did you get the pan camera to T-stop?
2340053|LMP|Yes, sir. ... good, got it.
2340100|CMP|Frame 106. That's the last one we could use on this one.
2340109|CMP|Where - where's our stars? Let me take a look, can I? Oh, yes. Okay. Down in R-1.
2340152|CMP|Okay, let's see, we can take this one ...
2340158|LMP|Houston, in earth-light, we have a dim but good view of the Cobra's Head and Schroter's Valley and the Aristarchus Plateau. It's not as bright as it was the first night we were here, but still light enough to distinguish their outlines.
2340222|CC|Roger.
2340232|CMP|Okay. That's all the hoses coming from ... And, Houston, we're ready to go to RETRACK on the MAPPING CAMERA. Okay - -
2340246|CC|Okay , we're watching it.
2340246|CMP|- - 3,2,1 -
2340250|CMP|MARK it. Barber pole. Okay, we'll stand by on our cue for ... camera. Oh, okay.
2340325|CMP|Well, ... know how to do that.
2340342|CC|PAN CAMERA POWER to OFF, America.
2340352|LMP|POWER'S OFF.
2340403|LMP|Okay, LASER ALTIMETER'S OFF.
2340410|CMP|Okay, stand by for P52.
2340430|LMP|Okay, the MAPPING CAMERA COVER is going CLOSE.
2340433|LMP|MARK it.
2340435|CC|Negative, negative on that, please.
2340436|LMP|And, it's gray.
2340438|CMP|Hey, negative. Don't - Well, he got away with it.
2340500|CDR|That's my fault, Bob. I thought that camera was already in, when you gave us a GO on that.
2340505|LMP|And I put it back to OPEN, and it went barber pole, then gray again, and it acted properly.
2340512|CC|Roger.
2340522|CMP|The MAPPING CAMERA'S CLOSED now. It's RETRACTED, I mean. Yes, we're okay.
2340539|CDR|Houston, we'll stand by for your GO on closing the cover.
2340542|CC|Roger. Stand by.
2340615|CC|Ron, we'd like one test here. We'd like to take the MAPPING CAMERA TRACK switch to RETRACT and verify the barber pole stays gray.
2340637|CMP|Houston, it's in RETRACT right now or still is and has been all the time, and barber pole is still - I mean is still gray.
2340644|CC|Okay, you're clear to CLOSE the MAPPING CAMERA / LASER ALTIMETER COVER.
2340651|CMP|Okay.
2340700|CDR|Okay, it's CLOSED, barber pole, then gray.
2341012|CMP|Ah ha, I recognize Sirius.
2341018|CC|Gave you another easy one, huh?
2341022|CMP|Yes, another easy one.
2341048|CMP|That's Regulus, I think. isn't it? 22. Yes, is that one - yes - Okay. The dot on the question mark.
2341130|CMP|It's a little hard to see, but I think that's it. (humming)
2341156|CMP|Yes, maybe I ought to do that one again. Yes.
2341213|CMP|Rigel, this time, okay?
2341258|CMP|(Humming) 21, Alphard. Okay, that's down below Sirius.
2341348|CMP|Okay, there's 0.01.
2341353|CC|We'll buy that.
2341354|CMP|Plus 0.065; minus 0.050; minus 0.039. Okay, we'll torque at 14:50.
2341415|CC|Roger, Ron. We copied those.
2341417|CMP|No, it won't make any difference. Okay.
2341427|CMP|Okay; 1 ENTER. Okay, let's torque her - let's go to the TEI REFSMMAT. 55144. About 90 degrees from pitch, isn't it? Difference? Yes, okay. That's good. Ground knows what they're doing. Okay, we're in CMC, FREE, let's coarse align it. Okay, PROCEED. No ATT.
2341509|CMP|Okay, let's picapar. Okay, it still likes Rigel. (Humming) not if there's a big one.
2341622|CMP|Twenty-one, should be Alphard, I think. Two stars, huh?
2341702|CMP|Yes, that's a long ways away off. It's outside of the field of view of the sextant. Both of them were.
2341717|CMP|Okay, 21. Yes. Yes, let's coarse - let's torque this one then I'll do another one.
2341740|CMP|(Humming) You got em? Yes. Yes. Yes.
2341837|CMP|Yes, that brought it in there nice and close. We'll just tweak her up just for the heck of it. Yes.
2341930|CMP|Well, ptttth! How's our time doing?
2342006|CMP|Well, that was close enough, really, but - That's within the limits, but I'd like to get her down to at least 0.01.
2342021|CDR|Hello, Houston. You want those O2 tank HEATERS pulled ON?
2342028|CC|That's affirmative, Geno.
2342033|CDR|Okay, then we'll pull the O2 TANK 50-WATT HEATERS - three of them - yes, the 50-WATT HEATERS. Three of them OPEN and the O2 1 and 2 100-WATT HEATERS, CLOSED.
2342058|CC|America, Houston.
2342058|CDR|Okay, those heaters are taken care of, Houston.
2342102|CC|We see you going around the corner here and you're looking good as you go by us.
2342109|CDR|Okay, thank you.
2342124|CMP|Well, the heck with it (laughter). Okay (laughter).
2342152|CC|You got lots of CMPs watching today, Ron.
2342157|CMP|(Laughter)
2342158|CDR|CDR has taken over, now.
2342201|CC|Do you take credit for that last zero, two?
2342202|LMP|And after that, the LMP tries one.
2342206|CMP|(Laughter)
2342208|CDR|No, sir. I just got tired of looking at it; that's why I'm going to do the next one.
2342230|CC|Ron, Stu said that all CMPs ought to accept a two. It just makes you more humble.
2342237|CMP|Yes, I know. I've really accepted it, but I just thought I could do better.
2342245|LMP|And one thing that you can't do is make Ron more humble.
2342343|CC|Just a reminder with 1 minute to go, Ron. We want to remind you to go back to auto - to the autopilot when you're done with your 52s and the final score in the game was 16 to nothing. Miami over Baltimore.
2342358|CMP|Okay, mighty fine. Commander's down there trying his luck, now.
2342407|CC|We're all watching. We just hope we see it before you go LOS.
2342412|CMP|(Laughter)
2342420|CDR|If you don't hear about it, if you miss it, don't worry - -
2342421||BEGIN LUNAR REV 75
2342453|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal as the spacecraft America passed behind the Moon on revolution number 74 will be out of sight from the Earth for approximately 28 or 48 minutes. Coming up in 2 hours and 16 minutes on the transearth injection burn behind the Moon during - at the end of revolution number 75. To repeat the ignition time currently is Ground Elapsed Time of 236:42:08. A burn of 3046.9 feet per second to boost the spacecraft out of lunar orbit and on a trajectory toward Earth. A splashdown in the South Pacific Tuesday afternoon. The spaceflight meteorology group of the national weather service said this afternoon that weather conditions are expected to be satisfactory for the landing and recovery of Apollo 17 next Tuesday. A weather forecast for the planned landing area which is located about 350 miles southeast of American Samoa calls for scattered to broken clouds, winds of 10 knots, three foot seas and temperatures near 81 degrees. Members of the white team of flight controllers are beginning to drift in for the hand over just prior to acquisition of signal next revolution. We're estimating a change of shift press conference at approximately 4 p.m. in the small briefing room with the off-going flight director Neil Hutchinson. To repeat, estimated change of shift press conference at 4 o'clock, small briefing room, Houston News Center. At 234:26 this is Apollo control.
2342802|PAO|This is Apollo Control again at 234:28, Scrub that last estimate of a change of a shift briefing and back it up to 3:45 P.M. Repeat 3:45 P.M. in the small briefing room in the Houston News Center, with Flight Director Neil Hutchinson. At 234:28, this is Apollo Control. Out.
2344800|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 234 hours 48 minutes. We'll be regaining radio contact with Apollo 17 in about 20 minutes. The change of shift press briefing is ready to start momentarily in the MSC News Center briefing room. We'll switch you to the briefing room at this time.
2350749|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 235 hours 8 minutes. Now less than one minute from regaining radio contact with Apollo 17. And, when once again we hear from the crew, they should be in the midst of eating their last meal in lunar orbit. Everything is in very good shape for the trans-Earth insertion maneuver to be performed at the end of this revolution, and at the beginning of the 76th revolution as they come around the front side of the Moon, they'll be on their way back to Earth. During this front-side pass, we'll be passing up to the crew the final set of numbers that'll be fed into their computer, targeting the trans-Earth injection burn. Also, we have the times for acquisition of signal following TEI. With the normal TEI burn, we would expect to acquire signal at 236 hours 55 minutes. If for some reason, the burn is not performed as planned, we would regain radio contact at 239 hours 7 minutes 18 seconds. And, we should have AOS momentarily.
2350947|PAO|I wanted to make one correction to the AOS times there. Without the burn, if the Trans Earth Injection burn is not performed, the acquisition of signal time is 237 hours 7 minutes 18 seconds rather than 239 hours, as we gave you. Again those times. With the burn, 236 hours 55 minutes; without the burn, 237 hours 7 minutes 18 seconds. That would be about 12 minutes 18 seconds later if the burn is not done.
2351352|PAO|We've got good solid telemetry from the space craft.
2351405|CC|Hello, America, Houston. Over.
2351429|CDR|Hello, Houston. How do you read America? Over.
2351432|CC|America, this is Houston. You're loud and clear on your last time around. Over.
2351439|CDR|Okay, Gordo. You're loud and clear. We thought we'd lost you there for a little bit.
2351456|CDR|And we're just finishing up an eat period, and looked around, and the spacecraft still looks good on-board.
2351505|CC|Okay. Sounds good.
2351512|CDR|Got some gyro torquing angles, if you'd like them, please.
2351515|CC|Okay; go ahead.
2351519|CDR|Okay; the last P52 produced gyro torque of minus 011, minus 007, and minus 002; GET torque time was 234:26:07. And let's just let it suffice to say we torqued on the commander's P52.
2351552|CC|Okay,
2351855|LMP|Houston, 17.
2351858|CC|Go ahead.
2351902|LMP|Yes, Gordy. Gene was trying to call you guys for about 4, or 5 minutes, after we had fairly good up-link signal strength, and you didn't answer, until you said that was the first time you'd called. Is that something that you can explain down there?
2351923|CC|I think it is, but let me make sure I get the right answer here.
2351932|LMP|We did not change any configuration in the spacecraft during that 5 minutes.
2351938|CC|Roger.
2352055|CC|America, Houston. I guess we don't have an explanation. We checked with the site, they were locked on and I can't see any reason why, if you were coming down, that we didn't hear you.
2352134|CC|America, Houston. You read now?
2352139|LMP|Oh, that's affirm, Gordy. Sorry, I - we were discussing whether or not we had really transmitted, apparently we had.
2352148|CC|Okay. We'll keep checking here, but first glance doesn't turn up the - any answers.
2352157|LMP|Okay. Well, after the next run, we would like to have comm as soon as possible, and that's what I was checking on.
2352205|CC|Roger.
2352311|CC|America, Houston. We're ready with all the updates, both verbal and electronic, whenever you are.
2352322|LMP|Okay. Stand by a few, please.
2352334|CDR|Houston, you want the computer?
2352338|CC|That's affirmative. We're ready with the up-link.
2352342|CDR|Okay. You've got ACCEPT now, and stand by on the updates.
2352351|CC|Okay.
2352647|CC|America, Houston. The up-link's in there, you can go back to BLOCK.
2352655|CMP|Okay.
2352919|LMP|Okay, Houston. We're ready to take final TEI pad from you.

2353446|CC|Okay. That's a good readback and I have another one of those for rev 76.
2353459|LMP|Okay; go ahead.
2353501|CC|Okay. It's TEI-76, SPS/G&N; weight is 36372; plus 0.63, plus 0.86; 238:42:07.62; plus 3079.9, minus 0283.7, plus 0004.8; 180, 359, 358; all the rest of the pad is NA.

2353643|LMP|Okay. TEI-76. SPS/G&N; 36372; plus 0.65, plus 0.86; 238:42:07.62, plus 3079.9, minus 0283.7, plus 0004.8; 180, 359, 358; rest of pad is NA. Sirius and Rigel; 136, 071, 035. Ullage is four jets for 12 seconds, and the remark is burn based on TEI REFSMMAT.
2353727|CC|Okay. And one more is a map update. It goes on the Flight Plan opposite 236 hours and 50 minutes on the right side of the page.
2353804|LMP|Okay. 236:50, right?
2353808|CC|That's affirm.
2353813|LMP|Go ahead.
2353816|CC|Okay. The AOS without burn is 237:07:18; and the nominal good TEI AOS will be 236:55:00. Over.
2353842|LMP|Okay. AOS without, 237:07:18; AOS with, 236:55:00.
2353852|CC|Okay, Jack. We're getting pretty good with these pads. Another 3 days, we ought to have it down pat.
2353901|LMP|I think so, Gordy. Is that an offer or do we have a choice?
2353910|CC|Okay. Yes.
2353911|LMP|I presume you meant 3 days around the Moon, didn't you?
2353914|CC|No, no, 3 days to splashdown.
2353919|CDR|(Laughter) it's all right, Gordy, I know vhat you meant.
2353923|CC|We got a lot of parties planned we don't want to put off.
2353938|CC|Okay. We'd like the HIGH GAIN on AUTO. And also, EECOM would like the H fans reconfigured. Number 2, OFF, number 1, ON. Over.
2353959|LMP|Okay. As per EECOM's request, H2 fan 2 is OFF and number 1 is ON.
2354009|CC|Okay. And we've taken another check on the problem with AOS this rev. We have several sites confirm that they had a solid down-link signal strength and that none of them heard you. We were wondering if you had found anything in audio panel configuration, possibly, that would explain it. Over.
2354035|CDR|Gordy, no. But it's conceivable I could have been keying the intercom. I don't think so, but it's certainly conceivable. I - I checked everything else around here.
2354046|CC|Okay, Gene. You're loud and clear now, so guess we'll let it go at that.
2354052|CMP|Houston, this is Command Module Pilot, do you read me now?
2354056|CC|That's affirmative. Loud and clear,
2354101|CMP|Okay. I'm on the audio panel that Gene was on when he first transmitted.
2354107|CC|Sounds good.
2354111|CMP|Okay.
2354148|LMP|And, Houston; DELTA-V test was minus 22.2.
2354154|CC|Roger.
2354538|CDR|Okay, Gordo; this is America. Are you ready for the mapping camera?
2354544|CC|Roger, Geno. Stand by. Okay; we're ready.
2354557|CDR|Okay.
2354605|CDR|Okay, MAPPING CAMERA is OFF.
2354703|CDR|Okay. MAPPING CAMERA is STANDBY and IMAGE MOTION is OFF.
2354710|CC|Roger.
2354959|LMP|Houston, I'm going to - I'm waiting your cue to check out the number 2 pressure Indicator.
2355008|CC|Okay. Stand by, Jack.
2355011|LMP|I'm on SPS, of course.
2355016|CC|Okay, Jack. We're ready.
2355028|CDR|Okay, Gordo, We're going to go ahead and maneuver, P30 looks good. The ... flag is reset for VERB 49.
2355038|CC|Roger.
2355045|LMP|Okay, Houston. Then I'm going back to number 1 on the pressure indication.
2355051|CC|Okay. We watched it.
2355106|CMP|And, Houston; America. The EMS DELTA-V test went from plus 100 to plus 100.5, and went from minus 100 to minus 99.5.
2355121|CC|Copy, Ja - Ron.
2355142|CMP|Okay; what's our DELTA-Vc? 3028.5. Oh, come on here.
2355233|CMP|Okay; DELTA Vc is set. 3028.5. We're DELTA-V is STANDBY.
2355254|CMP|Okay; we're caged, RATE 2. Okay; we'll put all 16 of them on. Down, up, up, down, up, down, down, up. We're CMC in AUTO and DET is set.
2355320|CMP|Okay.
2355343|CDR|Houston, America. We'll pick up the star sextant check and set the DAP when we're in attitude.
2355351|CC|Roger.
2355409|CC|America, Houston with some words about the pan camera operation after TEI.
2355418|LMP|Okay, go ahead.
2355419|CC|Okay. We haven't told you about this, but we noticed a failure during the last operation of the pan camera, of the stereo. It's completely failed and, so - when you go to OPERATE, which is about 7 minutes after AOS, after TEI, you car. expect to get - a barber pole after three frames have cycled through. Want you to just ignore that and let her run. We figure you have 2 minutes of film left, but we won't be able to monitor end of film, because you'll be on TV on the FM. So we're going to limit the pan camera operation to 5 minutes total, and we'll be able to give you the mark when to turn it off after the 5 minutes. Over.
2355517|CDR|Okay, Gordo. At 237 in the Flight Plan, where it's "PAN CAMERA, OPERATE" we'll ignore the barber pole. We'll run for 5 minutes and we'll shut it down on your cue.
2355525|CC|That sounds good.
2355627|LMP|Okay, Houston. The PAN CAMERA is going to BOOST. And also, we're presently configured with the IR, ON and the COVER, OPEN. Apparently Flight Plan neglected to have us turn it off, or are we supposed to burn with it open?
2355646|CC|Let me check that.
2355728|CC|America, Houston. We'd like the IR cover closed to keep the Sun out of it.
2355736|CMP|Okay, and you want the instrument off?
2355740|CC|Negative, Leave the IR on and I - I'll get back to you in a minute on all these covers.
2355800|LMP|Okay, Gordy. Cover's closed and we'll wait your further word.
2355914|CC|America, Houston. On the covers, we want all three covers closed, according to the pre-SPS burn cue card. The instruments, the IR and UV, keep running, until after TEI, when you open the covers and back up per the Flight Plan. Over.
2355937|LMP|Okay, we'll do that and going OMNI Delta.
2360016|LMP|Houston, our last view this time around is the Sun rising over the Aristarchus Plateau and with the Prinz rilles and generally a continuation of the striking views we've had up to now.
2360036|CC|Roger.
2360052|LMP|We'll leave this country - this part of this planet for the next group to explore, I guess.
2360752|CC|America, Houston. I think this is what you wanted to hear, you're GO for TEI.
2360801|CMP|Outstanding.
2360803|CDR|Okay, Gordo. Understand America is GO for TEI and I'll give you a confirm on the star here, in just a second.
2360812|CC|Okeydoke.
2360849|CDR|Say, Gordo, I'm - I got the Moon now in the telescope, be just a little bit before I can give you a confirm on that, but the DAP is set.
2360914|CMP|Okay; we'll go ahead and go into P40.
2361001|LMP|Houston, 17.
2361004|CC|Go ahead.
2361009|LMP|Gordy, could you give me a summary of what your expectations are on the operation of the PUGS?
2361020|CC|Okay, just a minute.
2361058|CC|Jack, Houston. We expect you'll need decrease throughout the whole burn. However, we'd like you to control it as required, to keep it in the green band.
2361112|LMP|Okay. And why do you expect that, Gordy? I missed one of the burns.
2361127|CC|Just - just the way it's worked from past history, that's what we expect this time.
2361136|LMP|Okay.
2361443|CDR|Okay, Houston we're down to 6 minutes in the checklist, except for a star sextant check.
2361452|CC|Okay, Gene.
2361546|CC|Jack, Houston, with a further word on the PUGS. We have noticed after ignition, on previous burns, some oscillation. We suggest you stay in DECREASE for the first 25 seconds or so, until it stabilizes before you start controlling it.
2361605|LMP|Roger, Gordy.
2361755|CDR|Houston, the star sextant check is GO.
2361759|CC|Roger.
2362113|CC|America, Houston. About 2 minutes until LOS. One reminder about the DSE: we'd like you to go to LOW BIT RATE just prior to LOS as per the Flight Plan. And then go back to HIGH BIT RATE at 6 minutes prior to ignition per your burn cue card and you can just leave it in HIGH BIT RATE from there on through AOS. We just went around the room once more; everything looks good. Have a good burn, and we'll see you and the TV picture as you come out the other side. Over.
2362152|CDR|Okay, Gordy, thank you. We're looking forward to a good burn. And, we'll see you coming out the other side.
2362259|PAO|This is Apollo control. We've now had loss of signal. Apollo 17 completing it's last full revolution of the Moon. Flight Director, Chuck Lewis, has just advised his flight controllers this would be a good time to take a 10 or 15 minute break and then be back on the consoles ready for acquisition of signal at which time Apollo 17 should be on its way back to Earth. The final set of numbers passed up to the crew to perform the transearth injection burn are very close to those that we had earlier. A couple of very minor changes. The ignition time is 236 hours 42 minutes 8 seconds. That represents a change of one second. The total burn duration remains unchanged essentially at 2 minutes 25 seconds. And this will impart an increase in velocity to the spacecraft of 3046 feet per second and that represents a decrease of 1 foot per second over the numbers we had previously. Splashdown is targeted for a Ground Elapsed Time of 304 hours 31 minutes 25 seconds in the Pacific southeast of Samoa. The targeted splashdown coordinates are 17 degrees 54 minutes south and 166 degrees west. The television picture as Apollo 17 comes around into acquisition of signal. We regain radio contact should be a very spectacular view of the lunar surface, The spacecraft at the time we acquire should be at an altitude of about 291 miles above the lunar surface moving out at more than 55 hundred miles per hour and it will be almost directly over the crater Tsiolkovsky which is on the lunar farside normally not visible from Earth. This will be the second time that we've had a chance to view the lunar far side via television from an Apollo mission. The first time occurred on Apollo 10. We were discussing that mission with the Commander of Apollo 10 General Tom Stafford, who's here in the Control Center. Stafford also recalled it being a very spectacular view, as all lunar crews have reported. One thing he did point out is that Apollo 10 had significantly more velocity at transearth injection than Apollo 17 will have. Had a shorter trip time of something like 40 hours for the return compared with about 68 hours for the return time on Apollo 17. This would perhaps cause the Moon to shrink a little less rapidly than we recall it from Apollo 10, but nevertheless, should be a very spectacular sight. The previous crews have described it, the Moon is looking as if you were in a high performance jet aircraft going straight up and the Moon goes from filling the TV screen to shrinking into a discernable sphere in a relatively short period of time, a matter of 10 to 15 minutes as we recall. Again, the acquisition of signal time, the time at which we should have radio contact with Apollo 17, given a normal TEI burn is 236 hours 55 minutes. We have a clock in the Control Center, counting down to that acquisition time. We're now 28 minutes 14 seconds from acquisition. If, for some reason, the transearth injection burn was not performed, we would acquire about 12 minutes later at 237 hours 7 minutes 18 seconds. This is due to the fact that without the burn the spacecraft remains in a lower orbit, does not clear the lunar horizon and become visible to antennas on Earth as soon. Everything has continued to progress very smoothly leading up to transearth injection. On the last front side pass, we fed up the final numbers to the crew. They made the final checks of their guidance and navigation equipment, and as they went around the corner of the Moon everything was looking absolutely normal. We did have one minor unexplained situation occur at the start of the revolution. Gene Cernan reported that he tried for 4 or 5 minutes to establish radio contact and apparently not getting through. The instrumentations communications officer here in the Control Center checked with the various tracking sites, both the prime and backup sites, and they all confirmed that they had rot heard downlink from the spacecraft, although we did have, that is, voice downlink, we did have good telemetry lock on and good solid signal strength. The indications that we had, both on the ground and from the spacecraft were that everything was in the normal configuration and we simply have no explanation for that 4 or 5 minutes when the crew was unable to contact us. But the communications equipment has continued to work absolutely normally. No sign of any problem and no concern. This burn of course is performed while the spacecraft is behind the Moon, so we have no data on the maneuver. We'll get our first report, of it as the crew comes back around on the lunar front side. Comparing this transearth injection maneuver burn with previous burns, it's interesting to observe the Flight Controllers. They're certainly all aware that this is a significant event, leaving the Moon for the final time in the Apollo Program, but the atmosphere here in the Control Center is not much different from previous transearth injection burns that we've observed. Having watched the spacecraft and crew perform this same maneuver flawlessly seven times previously, there's obviously less of the tension that was evident at this time after Apollo 8, when Apollo 8 was preparing to leave the Moon four years ago. We have a number of small clusters of people gathered around in casual conversation and in about 5 or 10 minutes, I'm sure we'll see everybody returning to consoles, getting set to receive that first data from the spacecraft. We're now 12 minutes away from the time at which the crew will be igniting their 20,500 pound thrust service propulsion system engine for 2 minutes and 25 seconds of what's been described as a rather stiff kick in the tail for the spacecraft that starts it on its path back to Earth. And we're now about 25 minutes from reacquiring radio contact with Apollo 17. At 236 hours 31 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
2365203|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 236 hours 52 minutes. We're now a little less than 3 minutes away from the time we expect to regain radio contact with Apollo 17. And, at that time, we should get confirmation from the crew that America is enroute back to Earth. We have another clock counting, here in the Control Center, for the acquisition time that we can expect, if the Trans Earth Injection burn was not performed, and that now shows 14 minutes 42 seconds until acquisition of signal. That again is the time that we would acquire if the Trans Earth Injection burn was not done as planned. We have an interesting display at the present time, which is called up by our Flight Dynamics Officer, and this display shows what the computers here in the Control Center predict that the current velocity of the spacecraft and its altitude are, based on the assumption that the burn was performed as planned. And, if that assumption is correct, Apollo 17 at this time, is traveling at some 7800 feet per second and is at an altitude of about 237 miles above the Moon and climbing rapidly. And, we're now less than 1-1/2 minutes away from acquisition of signal.
2365434|PAO|We're now less than 30 seconds from acquisition of signal. The next call will be INCO's, the instrumentation and communications engineer letting us know that we have radio signals from the spacecraft. We'll be receiving Apollo 17 through a 210 foot dish antenna at Goldstone, Calif.
2365513|PAO|AOS, Goldstone.
2365611|PAO|We've acquired signal, but we're still waiting for a good solid lockup. And, our data shows that Apollo 17 has an altitude now of 335 miles above the lunar surface.
2365714|CC|America, this is Houston. We'd like the high gain, please.
2365734|PAO|And, we're beginning to get a picture of the lunar surface.
2365753|PAO|This view's from 400 miles up.
2365757|CDR|Houston, do you read America?
2365759|CC|That's affirmative, America. And we have a picture. Over.
2365805|CDR|Roger, Houston. America, has found some fair winds and following seas, and we're on our way home.
2365812|CC|Okay, that's great news.
2365820|CDR|It sure is, Gordo.
2365822|CMP|You betcha, by golly. It's outstandingly good. That was a good burn, too. We'll give you the burn report in a bit.
2365828|CC|Okay.
2365857|CDR|Okay, Houston, I'll try to give you Tsiolkovsky from about the nadir.
2365902|CC|Roger.
2365921|PAO|The crater Tsiolkovsky on the lunar far side is normally not visible from Earth. First seen by a Soviet Luna, an unmanned photographic mission.
2365930|CDR|... focus. Yes, this - there you go.
2365944|PAO|That crater's about 160 miles in diameter.
2365950|CDR|This is a grand place to be right now.
2365956|CC|I'll bet it is, and we've got a great picture of Tsiolkovsky. Got it right, in the center, and good focus. Great picture.
2370010|CDR|I know there's not as many smiling faces down there as there are up here, but we're making up for the difference in numbers.
2370022|CC|Roger.
2370024|PAO|America 500 miles above the Moon now.
2370029|LMP|Gordo, I'll give you a quick burn report. The burn was on time. Burn time was 2 minutes and 23 seconds. DELTA-Vgx was 3047.0. Attitude at the end of the burn was 184, 005, 359. That's 184, 005, and 359. There was no trim. The residuals are minus 2, plus 0.7 - Correction, minus 0.2, plus 0.7, and plus 0.2. DELTA-Vc was minus 18.1.
2370110|CC|Roger. We got those.
2370114|LMP|And, Gordy, the unbalance is about 30 pounds, and oxidizer is 2.8 and fuel 2.9, and I blew FULL DECREASE the whole burn.
2370124||Roger, Jack.
2370138|CMP|How's the picture look, Gordy?
2370140|CC|Real fine.
2370146|PAO|This view looking back across the lunar far side at the highlands.
2370150|CDR|I'd tell you exactly what we're looking at, but I can't quite see it,
2370207|LMP|Gordy, the country Gene's pointing out, is south of the orbit that we've been following for several days, and Ron, even more than Gene and I. And it's some of the striking country of the far side of the Moon that human beings don't very often have a chance to see, but a trend's been started in the last few years, and I suspect it will continue.
2370238|CC|Roger, Jack.
2370254|CMP|Gordy, America performed superbly.
2370254|CC|America, Houston. We need PAIS CAMERA OPERATE, now.
2370302|LMP|Thank you. PAN CAMERA going to OPERATE.
2370310|CC|And can you verify that you got the other SIM bay items that precede that?
2370317|LMP|We're verifying that right now.
2370340|PAO|The spacecraft panoramic and mapping cameras are both operating at this time to record this view of the lunar far side.
2370405|LMP|Okay, Gordy. The SIM bay should be squared away.
2370408|CC|Okay. Thank you.
2370408|LMP|Pardon our slowness there.
2370413|CDR|Gordy, I'll try and take you across the terminator, if I can.
2370417|CC|All right.
2370425|LMP|Of course, we're seeing country south of Tsiolkovsky that we've never seen before.
2370435|CC|Roger.
2370448|LMP|And when we get a picture of Tsiolkovsky back, I think maybe even you can see one of the things that both Ron and I have noticed about it is, number 1, it's a basin that is comparable in its freshness and apparent age to the probably the Imbrium Basin on the near side of the Moon; and, secondly, it has an unusual area an its northeast quadrant that - from which the blanket is excluded. There is an apparent slide. We're not sure what it is, but the normal indications of an ejecta blanket are just not there.
2370534|CC|Roger that, Jack; and we can see those features you just described. The camera - -
2370540|LMP|Okay. And for - for your - -
2370541|CC|- - if you can figure out a way to hold it a little steadier, that would help, but we're getting good resolution.
2370549|CDR|Okay, Gordo, I'm working on it. You'd think a guy that's been there for however many days we've been there could find it, don't you?
2370600|CMP|When you see Tsiolkovsky south, the central peaks form an arrow that points south, Gordy.
2370658|PAO|If you look closely at the northeast rim of Tsiolkovsky, you'll see a large landslide that Al Warden first described on Apollo 15. The crew now moving the camera apparently to a different window. Apollo 17 now at an altitude of 825 nautical miles.
2370734|CC|America, Houston. Your altitude right now is 820 - 835 miles. Over.
2370747|CDR|Okay, 835 miles. And climbing out like a dingbat.
2370801|PAO|North is now at the bottom of this picture.
2370801|LMP|Frames 5 through 20 were taken on mag Papa Papa, at that altitude.
2370808|CC|Okay, Ron.
2370815|CMP|There's Smythii down there. I finally figured out where we are. Right down underneath the window. I can see it now.
2370828|LMP|Gordy, as far as we can, we'll try to run you a little bit along the orbital track. I'll be panning the camera more or less westward. Tsiolkovsky starting and Tsiolkovsky is itself in the crater Fermi, and moving on to the east, the next big pair of craters that we spent some time studying is Hilbert, which is just south, is right there, and just a little bit northwest of there is Pasteur.
2370911|CC|Roger, Jack.
2370921|LMP|Both Hilbert and Pasteur appear to be very old basins, much older than Tsiolkovsky and they have, as yon can see, a fill in them, apparent fill - very flat-looking at this distance, end very light colored. It's an event on the Moon of which we have relatively little understanding at this time, but possibly the Apollo 16 results, when they're fully known, through the analysis of the samples and other data, may shed some light on that event.
2370956|CC|Roger, Sorry to - -
2370958|CDR|Hey, look here - ... - -
2370959|CC|- - interrupt, but we'd like PAN CAMERA, OFF; now. PAN CAMERA. STANDBY, rather.
2371002|CDR|- - That's a full circle.
2371008|CDR|Okay, STANDBY. Now we're going to be able to pan a little bit more east now of Pasteur and start to show the crater Smythii, the basin Smythii really. It's one of the older large basins on the Moon. It has none of the obvious features of big basins such as Imbrium or Serenitatis. But it's nevertheless roughly circular, has a mare fill, and a very - I'm pointing right now to the hint of a second ring outside, but the main ring is the one Ron's talked to you a lot about, and has his double-ring craters in it. And we're pointing at some of those right now.
2371057|CMP|Uh-huh.
2371100|LMP|Okay, Houston, we can now see Tycho. We're seeing probably about 75 to 80 percent, of the entire Moon - face, anyway lit up. The rays of Tycho are very obvious from here. Want the camera over there, Gene?
2371117|CDR|Let me show it to them.
2371125|CC|We had a good tour there of Smythii. We recognized the Smith Brothers, the Wright Brothers and started to see Neper before you left, it.
2371149|PAO|This view from the Moon at an altitude of more than 1000 miles.
2371213|CMP|No.
2371213|CDR|No?
2371214|CMP|No.
2371216|LMP|No, you won't see Tycho for a little bit.
2371232|PAO|The large crater in the lower right corner is the crater Humboldt.
2371236|LMP|You can - Langrenus is visible now at the edge of Fecunditatis there, if you want to show that one.
2371248|CDR|Just this side of Fecunditatis?
2371253|LMP|And Humboldt is a crater that ought to show up very well on the television. That's the cracked floor crater there with a little dark mare.
2371300|CDR|Okay.
2371309|LMP|There's all the swirls in Marginis. You can really see them now.
2371316|LMP|Oh, yes. Why don't you get -
2371318|CMP|Yes. Can you get some of the swirls - -
2371319|LMP|Okay. Early in our orbit, and particularly Ron, he had the chance to work on the question of these light-colored swirls and Marginis has outstanding examples of them and I'll try to get the camera pointed on those in the northern part of Marginis. Let me orient you, as soon as we're focused here. Okay - Smythii - I'll point right at the center of Mare Smythii, and then move up towards Neper and then into the swirl area a little bit more north. And Gene will zoom you in and let you see what some of that looks like. I don't think we have a full answer at what the swirls are, but some of the things that we saw in Taurus-Littrow and later from orbit around Sulpicius Gallus may suggest to people, from now on, that the possibility of alteration from fluids in the interior of the Moon is more than just a possibility.
2371439|CC|Roger. That's a nice shot there of Marginis.
2371444|LMP|Can you see the swirls, Gordy? - are the very diffused, light-colored areas that cross various topographic features.
2371453|CC|That's affirmative, Jack. They're visible from here.
2371506|CDR|Okay. I'm going to give you an end-on view, if I can, of Mare - of the Crisium Basin. You should be seeing that now.
2371515|CMP|How is that, Gene?
2371517|CC|That's a good picture of Crisium as it is very evident on the right side of our picture.
2371524|LMP|Yes, that's right. And before long, we'll be able to show you the landing site and Taurus-Littrow and I think you probably see Proclus, which is the bright crater just off the horizon now. That's the one with the excluded ray zone on its western or southwestern side.
2371544|CMP|It's not in view yet.
2371545|CMP|We may not see it, I think we're going the other way.
2371547|CDR|Right in the horizon. The landing area, Taurus-Littrow, and the edge of the Serenitatis Basin is probably just on the horizon now and I'm not sure it exactly - -
2371600|CMP|You can see the dark part of Serenitatis is sticking out of the Sea of Proclus the ray-excluded zone. No, that's Fecunditatis sticking up there, isn't, it? Because the ray perpendicular to our track now points right to the landing site right off of Proclus.
2371623|LMP|The area where one of the Russian vehicles set down and returned samples from is just about in the center of your field of view now. Just on the north side of Fecunditatis.
2371640|CC|Roger. And you're about 1300 miles up right now.
2371646|LMP|Wow!
2371647|CDR|That's not a bad climb is it, Gordy?
2371651|CC|Pretty good rate.
2371652|LMP|A friend of mine says "Wow woozle!"
2371700|CMP|Looking out window - window 3 now, and the Moon is just the size of the window, and I've got my face right up against the window.
2371711|CDR|Or maybe his head's just the size of the Moon. We're not sure which.
2371713|CMP|(Laughter) That's right.
2371718|CDR|I don't know what's happening down there now, Gordy, but this is where the action was one time.
2371725|CDR|Okay, we're starting to, I think, in a little bit, be able to show you the edge of the Serenitatis Basin. It's moving a little slowly right now. It looks like it's creeping over the horizon.
2371739|CMP|It's going to creep over the horizon, maybe, but I think - -
2371742|CDR|But I'll tell you what's on the horizon now. I'm not sure I can get it. Let me try the rendezvous window. I think I can show them Apollo 11's landing site.
2371754|LMP|You can probably get it at the south portion of Tranquillity there, if you - out the center window would be better.
2371800|CMP|Yes, the center window, you could get it.
2371807|LMP|See the southern part of Fecunditatis, and then the Tranquillitatis takes off to the west there, Gene, right along that southern edge of Fecunditatis is where Apollo 11 set down.
2371819|CDR|Yes, and a little bit north of the line that - of the ray of those two craters.
2371847|LMP|Okay, Gordy, in the center of your picture is - about right in there, is the southern edge of Tranquillity and the Apollo 11 area and that was the ground track, of course, for Apollo 8 and Apollo 10.
2371908|CC|Roger.
2371917|LMP|Yes, we'll put you back on Langrenus, which is one of the Copernican-age craters, in this part of the Moon, and I believe it was Apollo 12 had an excellent opportunity for some several orbits to study Langrenus.
2371936|CC|Roger. We see that. It stands out like a beacon there, on the right side of the picture, and we also saw Messier with its rays.
2371954|LMP|Okay, our landing site's in view now, Gene.
2372004|CMP|You're a little bit off the field - let me move - you're almost out of the field here. Let's see, Proclus -
2372013|LMP|Our landing area is just about in the center of your field of view right at the horizon now.
2372018|CC|Roger.
2372019|LMP|That's the best focus we've got, Gene.
2372032|CDR|Okay, full zoom, and right in that region in the center should be the landing site of Apollo 17, known, hereafter I guess, as the Taurus-Littrow area.
2372057|CC|You're now 1500 miles above the surface, and your climb rate was just computed at 295,000 feet per minute.
2372110|CMP|(Chuckle) Oh man, that is really moving out.
2372117|LMP|Sure glad they cleared the traffic out of the way. Let me - Gene, let me switch over briefly and show them the North and South Poles, which nobody really has done much with yet, except for Lunar Orbiter, and some of the Russian vehicles. There's a spectacular valley off - on the South Pole. I don't know the name. It looks like one of these long chain of - chain of craters.
2372204|CDR|Does that show up? Let me try it with - let me try some of these others. Well, oh, here's where it ...
2372233|LMP|Okay, Houston, we're in - -
2372237|CDR|Huh? Good picture?
2372239|LMP|That's in the south polar regions. There's a - I think you can probably see a long chain of craters, which so far unvisited by man. In fact, the whole region has, and that goes for the north pole.
2372254|CC|Roger, Jack. That's very interesting. Can you zoom in on that whole valley?
2372300|LMP|I think that's the best we got, Gordy, That's full zoom.
2372304|CC|Roger.
2372311|LMP|It's one of the biggest crater - chain crater valleys that I've seen on the Moon. It - we saw some crossing Mendeleev, in the first few days, I think we talked about, similar in shape but not nearly as big.
2372331|CC|Roger.
2372333|LMP|Let me move over briefly to give you another view of Humboldt, which should show up very well now. We're just about directly overhead. It's unusual - one of the few craters on the Moon that have a fairly flooded floor, that appears to have been domed, and you probably can see some of the cracks in that floor.
2372356|CC|Okay, it's in the center of the field now; however, something is blocking the right side of the view.
2372403|CDR|How's that?
2372404|CC|That's real good now.
2372410|LMP|Around the edge of the dome floor, you can see some of the dark mare which is prevalent elsewhere in the region but not so abundant within Humboldt.
2372425|CC|Roger.
2372433|CDR|And you - you can see - if you can see - Check it ...
2372439|LMP|Langrenus, you mean?
2372441|CDR|Tsiolkovsky is ... the terminis.
2372443|LMP|Oh, okay.
2372446|CMP|Out the window.
2372447|LMP|Oh, all right. Hey, there's another view, if you will bear with us, of our old friend Tsiolkovsky, Okay?
2372455|CDR|Okay, I got it.
2372500|CC|Roger. It's hard to mistake that one.
2372506|LMP|Yes, it's one of the more pic - picturesque basins. I guess partly - although it's big, it's not so big you can't look at it all at once. Symthii and Crisium and Serenitatis and Imbrium, in particular, are hard to look at ail at once. You're always down inside of them in the 60-nautical-mile orbit.
2372533|CC|Roger. Just night mention the diameter for those who are watching at home. That's about 180 miles across, I think.
2372543|LMP|(Laughter) Okay. That's pretty good. I was going to say about 200 kilometers, I think, is what it is, but - -
2372550|CMP|That's right.
2372551|CMP|And, Gordy, of course, it's on a part of the Moon that you - you don't see from where you are.
2372558|CC|Roger.
2372604|LMP|Not yet, anyway.
2372612|LMP|Okay, let's see if we can move on along our orbital track that we've been following and see what's new that's come into view. Once again, I'll pick yon up at Smythii and move you into Mare Marginis, the Margin Sea. And, all the mare, you may recall now, we have pretty good evidence as a result of the Apollo - -
2372642|CMP|Change this ... around.
2372643|LMP|- - Program - -
2372645|CMP|Good.
2372645|LMP|- - that our theories of basalt flows that some 3 to 4 billion years ago, in round numbers, were erupted on the Moon and filled many of the low areas that existed at that time. Not an awful lot has happened to the Moon since - except for the impact craters, some of the younger ones, since 3 billion years ago, which is one of the reasons it becomes so interesting to man. It's - the Moon's frozen in a period of history 3 billion years and older, which is a period of history that we cannot recognize very readily on Earth because of the dynamic processes of mountain building and oceans and weathering that are taking place even at the present time. Understanding that early history of the Moon may mean an understanding of the early history of the Earth. And, I think we're well on our way to a first-order understanding of that history as a result of the Program. Okay, going to take you a little bit farther along. Again, to Proclus, which is the obvious partially rayed crater with a big excluded aone to the southwest. There's Mare Fecunditatis and its contact area with the Sea of Serenity, Mare Serenitatis; and the landing site now has to be just about on the horizon. I think we were a little premature before.
2372831|CC|Roger.
2372832|CMP|Yes, we were. That's Macrobius A and B just beyond Proclus, there. Yes. that's really Macrobius - -
2372844|LMP|Now, you're starting to - just to see the Mare of Serenitatis come over the horizon - -
2372849|CMP|Yes.
2372849|LMP|- - and, if you take a line Proclus between the two bright craters - -
2372857|CMP|You're not going to get more of the Moon and less of the space up there?
2372900|LMP|Yes, yes. How's that?
2372902|CMP|That's better.
2372904|LMP|Take that line, and that will take you just about to the landing area, right at the edge of the next big mare that you see.
2372909|CC|Okay, Jack, we can follow that just as you told us there. Those three craters are very obvious.
2372943|LMP|The site, Gordo, is now just to the left - left and a little below center of your picture.
2372950|CC|Roger.
2372953|CDR|You can see that ridge of mountains that sticks out and the landing site is - well, from here, anyway, right in that area.
2373000|LMP|Right, I guess my line was a little bit north of where we actually should have pointed you. There's some dark area just showing up around the edge of Serenitatis on the horizon. I think that will show in your picture as I remember some of these from Apollo 10 before. And it's just this side of the dark area that the Taurus-Littrow area sits, in the mountains, there.
2373039|CC|We think we have Maraldi in sight now.
2373047|LMP|Yes, and you also - -
2373048|CDR|Yes. They should.
2373049|CMP|Yes. You should.
2373049|LMP|- - Vitruvius should be visible to you just to the south of the landing area.
2373056|CDR|Vitruvius is in the monitor, so they should have it.
2373108|CDR|Jack, I think you got a good view. You can see Censorinus now. You can probably get a real good shot at the 11 site at Tranquility.
2373115|LMP|Yes, you're right.
2373119|CDR|There's old Censorinus. It's awful big.
2373125|CC|How big is it, Geno?
2373127|CDR|Okay, towards the southern border of - (laughter). Okay. Old Censorinus is right in the middle of the screen.
2373135|CC|We see it.
2373136|CDR|You've been there before.
2373138|CC|Right.
2373145|CC|17, Houston. You've just passed 2000 miles.
2373152|CDR|2000 miles. We've got about a 95-percent full Moon in front of us.
2373210|LMP|Not too far - matter of fact, I think the Apollo 16 landing area would be just about on the horizon, to the south of Tranquillitatis. And back up to something that's dear and near to our hearts. You probably now can pick out the mountains, the North and South Massif, if you really look closely. What do you think, Gene, from the monitor? Can they see that?
2373259|CDR|I can't even see the Massifs with the naked eye. No.
2373303|LMP|See the dark area there next to ... - -
2373308|CDR|I know where - Yes. I know where to look. But it's awful hard to pick them out. But you're looking right at it. You've got it right - Just to the left center. It's just about perfect, the landing site. There's a little dark area in that peninsula of mountains that sticks out and the site is just about right in that area.
2373325|CC|Roger, Gene, as you say - -
2373326|LMP|I wish we could show you - -
2373328|CC|- - we know where to look, but it's hard to confirm exactly the structure there.
2373337|LMP|Come on, you guys, 1 can even see the light mantle.
2373343|CDR|Extrapolation is the nature of our art.
2373348|CC|I just saw a flash, Jack.
2373351|LMP|I wish we could - Okay.
2373355|CDR|I didn't hear them. Say again.
2373357|LMP|Say again.
2373359|CC|I just saw a flash.
2373404|LMP|(Laughter) I wish we could show you some of the color we've seen on the Moon this trip, but I think we're a little too far away from it. We'll see if we can ... back in ... from here.
2373420|CC|We - we've been looking for that crater - -
2373425|LMP|Well, I can show you a picture of the commander. He's fairly colorful.
2373503|CDR|That's about what we're seeing, Gordy. I can't give you the bottom half because I can't quite move around the post here.
2373513|CC|Geno, we're getting a great picture ... 50 percent of it.
2373515|CDR|You getting the whole movie? I'll get it. Okay, I think you can orient yourself with the big basins Jack's been talking about. There's Crisium. You can see the landing site up in the - what is to me the upper left-hand corner of the picture, but you can pick it out by now, I know. Get a better relationship. You're looking at the Langrenus, down there, that bright crater. You ought to be able to see Humboldt. Maybe Jack can give you the whole thing. Just a second -
2373554|LMP|... this in.
2373555|CDR|Can you get the whole thing?
2373556|LMP|Yes. He said minimum zoom.
2373559|CDR|Yes. It's minimum zoom. Okay, that's pretty good, it's centered just about right in the center. It ought to fit your screen as we climb out. Just about a - tangential now.
2373618|CC|That's perfect right where you got it.
2373622|CDR|Okay, we'll hold that for a minute. The terminator is coming across, of course, at the opposite side of the Moon from the big basin that you're looking at.
2373634|CC|Roger.
2373638|CC|Geno, what color does that mare look like to you?
2373644|CDR|What color does the mare look like to me from here?
2373648|CC|Right.
2373648|CDR|Now, I'm a commander; do I have the right to change my mind? (Laughter)
2373653|CC|I guess so.
2373659|CDR|Tom, you know I always thought you could almost make it look whatever color you wanted to, it's so subtle. But the mare - the mare, to me, has got a grayish - a dark grayish mixed witn a very subtle tan, and that's what it looks like to me, from here.
2373722|CC|Roger.
2373724|CMP|This is the CMP. I agree with that.
2373729|CDR|The tan is sort of like a dusted tan in spots in and around and on the mare. I'd say that the basic - if I could pick out a chunk of that gray mare from here, I would pick out a very steel gray - a dull steel-gray color, but if I just took a mass of mare out, I'd have to mix it with a subtle - very, very subtle pastel tan.
2373759|CDR|That's perfect. You can see Tsiolkovsky now in the terminator, down there. I think Jack's just about got the Moon centered perfect. You got Tsiolkovsky on one end; the big basin's on the other end. how high are we, Gordy?
2373813|CC|... gray. Okay, you're 2327 miles.
2373824|CDR|You know, I think it's worth noting, while we're looking back at the entire Moon as we see it here and you're seeing it there, that America could be proud of the Apollo heritage it's left here. I know we in the program believe that it's really and truly been a heritage that will prove itself to be one of the - most beneficial things that have happened to mankind in quite some time, although none of us can really predict the future. But I think everyone that has been part of this program has been proud of its accomplishments. I know we have. We're looking back at someplace, I think, we will use as a stepping stone to go beyond some day. And those aren't words. It's a faith I truly and dearly have. And I think we will all see it in our lifetime, not just as a nation, but as a world. I think the Apollo Program not only has given us the first steps to that sort of impossible dream, but has given us an opportunity to make the first steps in bringing a world together as one unit, so that we can make that step together. It's been a privilege sharing the program - that part of it that we've been in with as many people as we have and as many people as we can, because I've often thought and I've often said before that anything that's worthwhile doing and doing well, is certainly worthwhile sharing with others. This is history being made in our time, while you and I are alive, not 100 years ago or 1000 years ago, and it's sort of the real thing happening right now. You're living it, not just us. We hope that you're getting as much out of it, not just feeling of pleasure and excitement, but that of accomplishment, as we are.
2374026|CC|Thank you, Gene. Speaking for the ground, as part of the Apollo Team, we second those thoughts, which you put very well.
2374043|CDR|Well, Gordy, it's not our accomplishment. It's the accomplishments of a nation. And I think the next set of accomplishments are going to be the accomplishments of mankind.
2374058|LMP|Gordy, in - in that vein, I think a couple words, I'd like to more or less reiterate what I tried to say as we finished our third EVA, and that was that the valley of Taurus Littrow and the orbit of the spaceship America saw the completion of mankind's first steps - first evolutionary steps from the Planet Earth into the universe. I think it's important that in doing so, we establish a tradition of peace and freedom within the solar system. From that larger home, now we move to greet the future.
2374204|CMP|Well, you know, Houston, and America, and the world, this is the Command Module Pilot of the spaceship America, and I just feel quite honored and proud to have been a part of this Apollo Program. The Moon, itself, is a magnificent, it's a dyn - well, I hate to use the word dynamic, because it's really not dynamic, but it's a marvelous planet. It has all the wonderful opportunity for exploration. Man must explore. We will continue to explore, and I hope that some day we may all have the opportunity to see mankind enjoy the benefits of the exploration of the Apollo Program.
2374304|CC|Thank you very much for the great TV show and the - and your final words. We enjoyed every bit of it.
2374314|CDR|And, Gordy, with that, we're about behind out timeline, as we fully expected we might be at this point in time, but believe me, it has been a beginning, it is a beginning, I don't think there ever will be an end, not as long as man is alive and willing.
2374342|CDR|... I turned it off.
2374433|CC|America, Houston. We didn't have data, of course, while you had the TV on. We're wondering if you configured the SIM bay on our voice call or had you done it earlier? Over.
2374447|CDR|No, Gordo. We were late. When you called - I guess "PAN CAMERA, ON," we went back and configured a SIM bay and followed those steps in the Flight Plan that follow "TV, ON." We had not done that.
2374503|CC|Okay. No problem. We're just - just wondered what we had there.
2374518|CDR|Okay, Are we up to date on the SIM bay now, or you satisfied?
2374523|CC|No, we're just now getting some data, and taking a look. We'll let you know. Okay. We'll take PAN CAMERA, OFF, now.
2374542|LMP|Okay. The PAN CAMERA power is OFF.
2374600|LMP|Okay, Gordy, S-BAND AUX TV is going to SCIENCE.
2374604|CC|Roger.
2374616|CDR|Gordy, it's going to be hard to leave this attitude, but we're going to maneuver now.
2374621|CC|Roger.
2374700|CMP|And, Houston; America. Mag Delta Delta is empty now. The last 50 percent was used for taking pictures of the TEI.
2374711|CC|Okay, Ron.
2374723|CDR|Gordo, going back at that burn. It was an outstanding burn. We were looking about a half a g throughout the burn. She lit off on time. She was a very steady burn. I think she reversed roll a - a couple of times in the dead band. The computer and the EMS were with each other all the way.
2374748|CMP|Chamber pressure on bank A started out at about 87. Bank B brought it up to about 92, 93. And when I first sat down, it was reading 0, now it's reading 5.
2374805|CC|Okay, Ron. We got 6 down here.
2374811|CDR|Okay, so in all other respects, the burn was nominal, Gordy. You got the burn report and the residuals, and we'll leave the tracking to you.
2374824|CC|Roger.
2374836|CDR|I might add, I don't think they built spacecraft any better than they built these two.
2374842|CC|I don't see how they could have.
2374843|CMP|I'll sure second that.
2374855|CDR|I finally found what I was looking for. I got the man in the Moon.
2374901|CC|Roger.
2374909|CDR|For all you nonbelievers, I verify he really is there.
2374914|CC|Okay.
2374935|CDR|Gordy, these next series of maneuvers - bring us - bring our middle gimbal angle pretty close to the apple. We're watching it, but appreciate you not hesitating giving us a call, too.
2374950|CC|Okeydoke.
2375123|CDR|Gordo. In answer to PP's question about the color of the maria down there, when you look at Serenitatis, of course we saw this earlier, when we were much closer, but when you look at it from up here, it's - it's got on the northeast side, a very - quite thick, laterally across the surface, dark - typically dark with the tannish colors I was talking about - mare - which sort of borders it. But just north of the - the overlap, between Tranquility and Serenitatis, that contact changes sharply to a - the grays are gone - it's a very sharp contrast and I think those who have seen it before will remember it, but Serenitatis from -where we stand is - much more tan dominated, than gray dominated.
2375233|CC|Roger.
2375329|CDR|Gordo, we'll get those numbers out of the first state vector out of the computer here shortly. No hurry to do it though.
2375338|CC|Okay.
2375351|CDR|Do you have our altitude now? About 4000 miles maybe?
2375400|CC|I lost that display. Let me check here.
2375405|CDR|No, I'm just trying to relate it to when we were coming in. I'd say it's more like 5.
2375411|CC|3100.
2375416|CDR|How many?
2375417|CC|3100.
2375422|CDR|3100. Okay.
2375509|CC|America, Houston. Sorry to say that the LCRU has pretty well crumped, evidently. We were talking over the biomed schedule and suggest that with your choice, either Gene stay on it or Jack go on it, and then we'll get back to the Flight Plan rotation after the EVA. Over.
2375536|CDR|Okay, I'll stay on it through the EVA. How's that?
2375540|CC|Okay, fine.
2375543|CDR|And we'll pick - we'll pick Jack and Ron in the morning.
2375549|CC|All right.
2375553|LMP|Gordy, this is Jack. I fail to see the correlation between the LCRU crumping and me going on biomed. Don't tell me you were monitoring it on the Surgeon's console, there.
2375614|CC|Well, we don't see any correlation either, but we're trying to look for some.
2375623|LMP|Okay; let me know when you have an answer.
2375627|CC|Okay.
2375757|CDR|Houston, America. When you get a hack on - on our track, I'd like to get a first-cut estimate at it.
2375809|CC|Okay; will do.
2375842|CC|Geno, it'll take about an hour to get a good hack, to get that much tracking. However, earlier, the Retro was betting everybody there wouldn't be any midcourses.
2375856|CDR|That's a - that's a good way to feel. Okay, we'll - we'll talk to you in an hour about it.
2375904|LMP|Whose the wild man Retro? I don't want to play poker with him.
2375913|CC|It's old ... He's a former B-17 pilot. They're - they're always right on.
2375941|LMP|Now you're starting to scare me.
2375950|CDR|You can pass the word to Captain Green, back there on the ... to clear the flight decks.
2375956|CC|Okay, we'll do it.
2380006|LMP|The last time I had anything to do with a bomber pilot, Gordy, he was getting me my airplane.
2380125|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 238 hours 1 minute. During the -
2380130|CDR|Hello, Houston; America.
2380132|CC|Go ahead.
2380135|CDR|We got PTC orientation in the computer?
2380141|CC|Negative, but we got it ready to come to you, if you give us ACCEPT.
2380156|LMP|Okay. It's all yours.
2380157|CC|Roger.
2380215|PAO|The significance of Capcom Gordon Fullerton's comment to the crew a few minutes ago that the LCRU had "crumped", as he put it, is that we're no longer able to get television from the lunar surface. The television picture comes back through the Lunar Communications Relay Unit. The Instrumentation and Communications Officer here has tried numerous times to command the TV on, and the commands are not getting through. So, apparently, the TV is no longer available to us.
2380244|LMP|Gordy, I'm afraid the weather reports on the way back of the only planet that really has much weather visible, will be a little repetitive.
2380256|CC|Jack, we're heartbroken.
2380303|LMP|For your for - first report, you can just play the recording back; it's sunny and clear.
2380314|CC|Okay.
2380320|CC|You're right on that one - -
2380321|LMP|The only sign of any weather - -
2380321|CC|- - except that you left out the fact that it's - cold also, here.
2380330|LMP|Gordy, you didn't listen. I can't see the Earth. I'm talking about that other planet.
2380341|CC|Okay. Depending on what part you're looking at, it's cold there, too. We got you, though. You got your REFSMMAT, you can go back - -
2380351|LMP|There might be traces of an atmosphere - -
2380356|CDR|Okay, Gordy. We're in BLOCK, and I might give my CMP one more chance at a P52.
2380403|CC|Okay.
2380403|LMP|Then, the LMP gets to start trying.
2380416|PAO|P52 refers to the rather tricky job of aligning the stable platform, does require a fair amount of practice, and Gene Cernan threatening to take over the job, of course facetiously, if Ron Evans didn't get a good P52 on his first try. This is the stable platform used as a - as an attitude reference by the spacecraft guidance and navigation system.
2380455|PAO|By virtue of the fact that the television is not available to us, we were not able to see the third of the explosive charges fired. The seismic data indicates that that charge was fired very close to the planned time at 237 hours 49 minutes 52 seconds. That would be just a little more than 2 minutes early, and we're getting good seismic data on it in the Control Center at this time.
2380824|CDR|Gordy, I can look back and, with the glasses - binoculars, and I can see the white mantle and see all the massifs in the landing area.
2380833|CC|How about that?
2380839|CC|Back when you had the tube on it, I - I really think - I knew we were looking in the right spot, but you know it was just blurry enough that - you couldn't be sure of exactly what you were looking at.
2380855|LMP|Gordy, let me - since I don't have anything else to do right now, apparently, I'll see - tell you a couple of things I see right here. The annulus - the dark annulus around Serenitatis, does not look complete in - in the due-north area. Oh, there are little partial pieces of dark material up there, but the main part of the annulus seems to cross into the mare region that's north of Serenitatis, and I can't remember the name of that right now. But it very clearly crosses right over there as a band and then dies out in that north region.
2380937|CC|Roger.
2380939|CMP|Okay, Houston. There's the torquing angles.
2380944|CC|Okay. We copy.
2380952|CMP|Okay. And I'll torque at - it looks like - at 238:10. I guess you really don't care, though, do you?
2381010|LMP|And, once again, albedo-wise and hue - color-hue-wise, the - that annulus is the same as at Tranquility, and essentially the same as most of Fecunditatis. The areas - although Tranquility and Fecunditatis are mottled locally with tan colors, the - that mottling seems to be local and, probably in large part, related to rays that cross those - those seas.
2381047|CC|Roger.
2381115|LMP|At this viewing angle, the dark mantle around Taurus-Littrow area is just a darker shade of blue-gray to me of the annulus, it's a - more just a medium gray, I guess. Whereas the Sulpicius Gallus dark mantle is a brown-gray, quite distinct in its color hue - to me, at any rate.
2381145|CC|Roger.
2381151|CMP|Houston, I can't see any stars out there, so I'm going to false torque it instead of coarse align.
2381159|CC|Okay.
2381207|CMP|Hopefully, the reason I can is because - cannot - is because the Earth is right in the field of view, and it's still pretty bright.
2381221|CC|Roger.
2381232|CC|America, we've got a little musical selection for you here. Stand by.
2381250|CC|(Music: Going Back to Houston, by Dean Martin)
2381538|CDR|That's very appropriate. I remember that being played one other time after a TEI burn.
2381549|CC|Roger. I think it came the other direction that time, didn't it?
2381555|CDR|If you stand by, we'll express to you our sentiments here, with a short little tune I think you will enjoy.
2381603|CC|Okay; standying by.
2381727|CMP|(Music: God Bless America, by Tennessee Ernie Ford)
2381924|CC|Hey, thank you very much. Very enjoyable and also very appropriate.
2381932|CDR|It certainly has a twofold meaning for us.
2382217|CMP|That's about par for the CMP, now.
2382223|CC|Ho hum, another all balls.
2382228|CMP|(Laughter)
2382232|CDR|You hit it right on the money.
2382243|CC|Okay; we've got those.
2382246|CMP|Okay; and we'll torque at 238:23.
2382252|CC|Roger.
2382348|PAO|Ron Evans' last comment referred to the platform alinement he just performed the so called P52 which came out perfectly no error at all. And, of course, he was referring back to the commander Gene Cernans previous remark that if the P52 did not go properly he would take on the job himself. This, of course, is a task that the Command Module Pilot is most proficient at and has done the most training and preparing for.
2383300|CDR|Gordo, I'll maneuver in about 10 minutes.
2383304|CC|Okay; fine.
2383457|CMP|Hey, Houston; America.
2383459|CC|Go ahead, Ron,
2383504|CMP|You reckon you'd have one of the photo guys down there to figure out when we could get a full Moon with an 80-millimeter lens.
2383517|CC|Okay. I'll put them to work on it.
2383521|CDR|Okay; appreciate it.
2383721|LMP|Houston, 17.
2383723|CC|Go ahead, Jack.
2383729|LMP|On the pan camera, you said to expect to see barber pole when we ran it. I did not see that, just for your information. It went barber pole and then gray.
2383744|CC|Okay; thank you.
2383756|LMP|And, Gordy, several times I have reminded myself to tell you guys something and I keep forgetting. I think it was yesterday, when we did an oxygen purge on fuel cell 3, after about - oh, I think it was a minute, possibly a minute and a half. The high O2 flow warning was triggered. Normally that is not triggered when we do the purge. That's the one and only time it's happened. This last one, prior to TEI, there was - it was within the green band and there was no fuel cell caution and warning. Just thought you might be interested in that one.
2383842|CC|Okay, Jack; thank you.
2383921|CMP|Houston, Ron here. I think I got - that - on fuel cell 3 too in one of my fuel cell purges, when I was up here by myself. Probably shows up on the data anyhow.
2383936|CC|Roger.
2384018|CDR|And you can tell Farouk that - that crater out on Fecunditatis, that I've got a picture of, that we worked on back at the Cape and studied quite a bit, has got all the attributes of everything he told me about it.
2384035|CC|Roger.
2384037|CDR|Yes, and that's the one - that's the one I was describing to him this morning.
2384043|CC|Okay.
2384057|CMP|Also, be advised the inner ring of the - the basin Arabia is quite visible. It looks like there is a - shallow depression outside the inner ring and when you get up at this altitude right around Saenger, it is indeed, it looks like a raised-up plateau crossing Saenger. And, also, in the vicinity is King - King is almost going into the terminator now, well, it's 10 or 15 degrees from the terminator. But you can see a little bit of a raised-up plateau, that takes in the crater King and goes about a crater - a King Crater diameter and a half or maybe 2 diameters to the south, and a crater and a half to the north of King.
2384208|CC|Roger.
2384330|CMP|You know, Houston, it's also interesting to note, that the - the range of color, from this altitude and from 60 miles, doesn't seem to change at all, really. In other words, the same impressions that I had of color in the 60-mile orbit are the same impressions that I have now, of the same areas.
2384358|CC|Okay, that's interesting. You're a little over 5000 miles out, at the moment.
2384412|CMP|Roger.
2384429|CDR|Gordy, you don't have that number on the 80 millimeter camera, do you? We're going to maneuver and I'd like to get a last shot at it.
2384435|CC|Okay. Well, you're well beyond the point where you can cover the whole Moon with an 80. We were just trying to come up with an altitude for filling up the 250, but you'll get the Moon and then some with the 80, right now.
2384452|CMP|Okay, that's good. Then we'll take it with the 80.
2384456|CC|Roger.
2385040|CC|America, Houston. At 240:30, you'll be about 10,000 miles out, at which altitude the Moon will just  fill up the 250 lens field of view.
2385100|CMP|Oh, okay. 240:30, it looks like for the 250 lens.
2385105|CC|Right.
2385642|LMP|Gordy, are you ready for an OMNI or you want to wait a little bit?
2385649|CC|17, Houston. Gordon's off the console for the moment. We'll wait a couple of minutes on the OMNI.
2385658|LMP|Okay.
2385826|CC|America, Houston. We need OMNI Delta.
2385839|LMP|Okay. You've got OMNI Delta.
2385844|CC|Okay.
2391502|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 239 hours 15 minutes. It's been very quiet, both here in the Control Center and onboard America. The crew, at this time, appears to be on the nominal flight plan, and they should be in the midst of an exercise period at this time. Also, they have the scientific instrument module bay in the Service Module of the spacecraft pointed toward Earth, with the ultraviolet and infrared spectrometers gathering their first data on Earth from lunar distance. The crew is scheduled to begin its sleep period about 3 hours from now, at 242 hours 20 minutes Ground Elapse Time. And at the present time, we show Apollo 17 6782 nautical miles from the Moon with a velocity of 4537 feet per second.
2391838|LMP|Houston, America.
2391840|CC|Go ahead, America.
2391846|LMP|Looking at our sketches here and trying to figure out exactly what we're looking at in the dark part of the Earth. I guess it's you and, if it's a clear night, you ought to have a pretty full Moon looking back at you.
2391905|CC|That's right we do. In fact, it's nice and clear all day and I could see it as I came in this afternoon. Your subspacecraft point right now is over the Yucatan Peninsula.
2391924|LMP|Yes, it's just about the chart I'm looking at, Gordo. Looks like about right smack in the center.
2392016|CDR|Gordy, do you have a general trend on the prediction in the recovery area?
2392023|CC|I haven't - haven't heard one, but I'll see if we can get one.
2392158|CC|America, Houston. The Sun is just about to enter the lens of the mapping camera, and we'd like you to retract it and then close the cover. We're not copying SIM bay data now, so we'd like you to get a MARK on both the start of retraction - give a MARK on the start of retraction and one when barber pole goes to gray.
2392224|CMP|Okay. We're going to retract the mapping camera. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 -
2392233|CMP|MARK it. There - -
2392235|CC|Okay.
2392235|CMP|- - barber pole. And that was at 20 - 22:30.
2392240|CC|Okay, and we want to keep it running to run the film out of it.
2392248|CMP|Okay, understand.
2392553|CC|America, Houston. How's the mapping camera talkback look?
2392601|CMP|Barber pole.
2392604|CC|Okay. We thought it should have been gray by now.
2392610|CMP|(Chuckle) Okay, let's see. I've got - we're coming up on 4 minutes.
2392627|CC|That's what I've got.
2392651|CMP|Hey, there we go. Gray.
2392654|CC|Okay, thank you.
2392657|CMP|Took a while - took a while, but it made it.
2392704|CMP|Okay, the COVER is going CLOSE; barber pole, gray.
2392711|CC|Okay, thank you.
2392804|CC|America, Houston. Got a couple of answers for you here. On this - the O2 caution/warning indication on the purge, at the time you were pulling 37.8 amps out of fuel cell 3 because the SIM bay was fired up and that'll result in about a flow of 1.37 pounds per hour which - and the trip limit is 1.2, so that's why you got the - the flag on it and you can expect to get the caution/warning anytime you've got 33 amps or more being pulled out of the fuel cells at the time you purge. Over.
2392853|CMP|Ah ha, okay. That sounds good, then.
2392858|CC|Also, we've tracked you a while now and midcourse 5 looks like a whopping 0.3 of a foot per second at the present time.
2392911|CDR|Beautiful, Gordy, beautiful.
2392913|CMP|That is outstanding.
2393131|CC|America, Houston. In answer to your question about the weather at splashdown, the area right now is 2000 scattered and 10, winds variable at 10. And forecasting the same - 2000 scattered and 10, with 3-foot waves, variable at 10 knots on the wind, and some rain showers, but less than 10-percent coverage on the rain showers in the area. Over.
2393203|CDR|Oh, you're full of good news tonight. Thank you.
2394900|CMP|Houston, America is about to maneuver.
2394903|CC|Okay.
2395144|LMP|Houston, 17.
2395146|CC|Go ahead and give us OMNI Charlie, please, while you're talking.
2395209|CC|Also, Jack, we'd like you - -
2395209|LMP|Hey, Gordy, this is Jack - since I can't give you - -
2395213|CC|- - we'd like H2 TANK 1 FAN, OFF.
2395216|LMP|Go ahead. H2 TANK 1 FAN is OFF.
2395224|CC|Thank you and go ahead.
2395229|LMP|Okay, we got all three of them off now. Right, Gordy?
2395233|CC|That's affirmative.
2395247|LMP|Hello, Gordy.
2395250|CC|Hello; go ahead, Jack.
2395254|LMP|Okay, since I can't help you out on the weather right now in the Pacific, can you give me a rundown of what things look like out there?
2395307|CDR|I already got it.
2395307|LMP|Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't on the loop. Apparently you already briefed somebody on that.
2395312|CC|I covered the recovery area. Not the rest of the Pacific. Did you want an overall briefing?
2395323|LMP|No. I was just curious what the recovery area looked like, and I'm sure that my compatriots will clue me in on it, if I'm nice to them.
2395331|CC|Yes. I'll save them the trouble. It's going to be 2000 scattered, 10 miles, 3-foot waves, variable at 10 knots, and less than 10 percent chance of rain showers. And that's just about what the weather is now, and also forecast.
2395355|LMP|Okay. Thank you very much.
2395423|CC|Jack, you've got a lot of SIM bay data stored up there that we'd like to get dumped. Can you give us the HIGH GAIN; PITCH, 30; YAW, 320?
2395437|LMP|Okay, PITCH, 30; YAW, 320.
2395520|LMP|Okay, it's the old HIGH GAIN for you.
2395524|CC|Thank you, sir.
2395553|LMP|Gordy, what altitude are we at now?
2395558|CC|Stand by, I'll check. 8500 miles.
2395611|LMP|You clipped. Say again.
2395613|CC|8500 miles.
2395620|LMP|Okay.
2400307|CDR|Gordy, as we're maneuvering, I guess we got one of the most spectacular views of the Moon I've ever seen, from a position like this. It's like - just short of being 100 percent full. We can still see from Tsiolkovsky all the way across the Moon and it's just absolutely magnificent and I'm afraid we're talking here that pictures just won't capture the real three-dimensional picture we're looking at. But, uniquely with the binocs I can still see the light mantle in the landing area.
2400349|CC|Roger, Gene.
2400507|LMP|Hey, Gordy, I don't know whether your camera people have anything to do this evening, but I've got a little problem for them if they'd like to work on it.
2400517|CC|Okay, go ahead.
2400521|LMP|Well, it seems to me we're not only moving away from the Moon, but we're moving across the face, and I took a picture about 5 minutes ago of the Moon, and it seems to me we could take another one at some X-number of minutes and have pretty good stereo if we matched the printing of the two pictures in terms of scale. And, I'm wondering what's a good time elapse here for a good stereo of the whole globe?
2400555|CC|Okay, we understand the problem, but I'm not -  Well, we'll try (laughter).
2400605|LMP|Well, I guess, if you could figure out what it would - how far we have to move across the face of the Moon and how long that would take to get about a - oh, shoot, a 30 to 1 base-height ratio'd probably be enough - 20 to 1 would probably be better, obviously, but 30 to 1, you could still see the stereo. And you ought to be able to figure that problem out. How fast do - do the guys know how fast we're moving across the face of the Moon?
2400643|CC|I'll, I'll put that one to FDO. Just looking at the big chart up here, I'm sure that the rate is slowing down rapidly, and - because you're - because the farther you get away, of course, the straighter away from it you're going. Stand by, I'll see what we can do.
2402459|CC|Jack, this is Houston with kind of a crude answer to your question.
2402507|LMP|Go ahead.
2402509|CC|Okay, it turns out right now that you're not moving across the lunar surface very fast, and you - it's getting less and less - right now, I guess it's about a mile per minute. It would take a lot of minutes to get much of a stereo base since you're 10,000 miles out. But, remembering back to Ron's final picture there before you went to the UV attitude, after he asked the question about how high he had to be to fill up the 80-millimeter lens, I think he took one at that time. We're thinking of combining a picture now with that picture, and then enlarging the one to get it to the equivalent diameter. And, some rough calculations of your longitude at that time and then now, show that you've changed about 21 degrees across the surface of the Moon between that picture and the present time, which comes out, if you take the average altitude between that time and now, to - to about a 25-to-1 stereo base, as best I can figure.
2402627|LMP|Sounds good enough, Gordy. We've got it - I got that one at 5 minutes. I mean at 240 on the hour, so those are probably pretty close.
2402642|CC|I would guess, you know, that the angle of looking at it - other factors have changed so much that it would be pretty hard to pull them together once you - even though you get the images reduced to the same size, but it might be interesting to try.
2402704|LMP|I agree.
2402746|CC|America, Houston. There's some items coming here now in the Flight Plan. A couple of them, MAPPING CAMERA, RETRACT, and COVER, CLOSED, you've already done. However, right now we still see the mapping camera film rolling, so we want to leave it running until we give you a cue to turn it off - get all the film run out. And, the uplink for a state vector that's shown there will not be necessary. Over.
2402818|LMP|We were looking forward to get to do something. Now, we'll wait a little bit longer.
2402829|CDR|Couldn't you just flash a couple of lights on the DSKY just to keep us occupied?
2402836|CC|Send a crew alert or something?
2402841|LMP|Yes, throw it in once in a while just to keep us on our toes, Gordy.
2402935|CC|The Surgeon had a suggestion. He said if you really get bored, you could all put on your biomed harnesses.
2402954|CDR|Only listen to about half of what goes down, will you?
2403002|CC|Okay.
2404206|PAO|This is Apollo control at 240 hours 42 minutes. Apollo 17 now 10,438 nautical miles from the Moon and coming up in about, oh, within the next 10 to 15 minutes -
2404222|CDR|Gordy, you got any words on the SIM bay prior to going into PTC?
2404232|CC|Stand by.
2404301|CC|Nothing additional, Geno, go ahead as per Flight Plan with the one exception. We'll give you a cue when to stop the mapping camera as soon as the film runs out.
2404315|CDR|Okay, we'll hold up on the mapping camera and its cover, and we'll get the IR, OFF.
2404324|CC|Roger.
2404334|LMP|Okay. Okay, Gor - Gordy, the IR is coming OFF now.
2404338|LMP|MARK.
2404339|CC|Roger.
2404344|PAO|The crew is getting ready at this time to set up the spacecraft in the Passive Thermal Control mode. This is the mode used to maintain proper thermal equilibrium during the translunar transearth coast phases of the mission. Rotating the spacecraft about it's longitudinal axis set about three revolutions per hour exposing each side equally to the Sun and cold.
2404357|LMP|And the COVER is CLOSED.
2404400|CC|Roger.
2404409|LMP|Hey, Gordy, this is Jack. Is there any updated briefing on the status of the lunar surface equipment and SIM bay findings over and above what we got? I guess, I can't remember when it was, yesterday or some time.
2404428|CC|I can't think of anything really outstanding. We're just right now coming up on another charge detonation; however, I think I mentioned that the LCRU is "kaput." So, we won't be able to watch it. We're looking at the seismometer traces here. Other - I'll come back with any other words to update you on yesterday's report in a little bit here.
2404506|LMP|Okay, I - just updated stuff. If something new comes in or - is all we're interested in.
2404514|CC|Okay.
2404641|CMP|Okay, Gordy, we're going to maneuver now to PTC attitude.
2404646|CC|All righty.
2404901|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're expecting the fourth of the seismic charges one of the lunar seismic profiling experiments to detinate on the lunar surface. The nominal time for the charge to go off is 240 hours 52 minutes. And it's been our experience with the previous three charges that their tending to go with in about five minutes either side of that targeted time. So, we would expect to see my seismic activity in the next oh 5 to 7 minutes. And as we mentioned previously, the television camera on the Lunar Rover is not available to us. Instrumentation and communications engineer at the previous detination attempted to bring up the camera, sent a number of commands and the lunar communications relay unit which transmits the television signal to Earth did not respond to the commands. We never got a picture from the camera and we're assuming that the communications relay unit and camera system on the lunar rover are out of operation. We don't at this point know what it is that has failed.
2405212|CC|America, Houston. You've just run out of mapping camera film. You can go ahead and clean up the items at 240:30 to power down the mapping camera.
2405227|LMP|Roger.
2405313|PAO|And it appears that our 4th seismic charge on the lunar surface has detonated. Very close to the planned time we copied the seismic activity at 240:53.
2405320|LMP|Okay, Gordy, we're going RETRACT.
2405326|CC|Okay, I think it should already be in, with the cover down.
2405331|LMP|Yes, you're right.
2405342|CC|And just now, the charge exploded at Taurus-Littrow, and we're seeing the results on the tracers here.
2405354|LMP|Which one was it, Gordy? Do you know?
2405404|CC|Okay, that one was number 8. A quarter-pound charge, and I guess it was fourth - I'm not sure which location that was. It was 0.4 of a mile from the LCRU, if that helps you decide.
2405428|LMP|Okay.
2405637|CC|America, Houston. We'd like H2 TANK 1 FAN, ON, please. That'll get it up for - prior to the sleep period.
2405652|LMP|Okay, TANK 1 is ON.
2405655|CC|Thank you.
2410048|CDR|And, Gordo, the canister is changed.
2410052|CC|Roger.
2410121|CMP|Hey - Houston - or Gordo, Ron here.
2410123|CC|Go ahead.
2410128|CMP|Okay, Gordo. As a result of number 5 [?] today and a little bit of a feeling of a little bit of gas right now, with - well, the possibility of a - of the desire, I feel like it may be worthwhile for me to take a Lomotil, and I'd like to get your concurrence on that.
2410153|CC|Okay, stand by.
2411057|CDR|Houston, America. How are our rates looking?
2411102|CC|Stand by. They're not down there yet. We want to wait a little bit, Gene.
2411111|CDR|Okeydoke.
2411546|CC|America, Houston with a response to Ron's question. Over.
2411555|CMP|Okay, go ahead.
2411558|CC|Okay, for gas, we're recommending only - we're definitely not recommending the Lomotil; we're recommending the gas pills; however - -
2411608|CMP|Ya, I concur.
2411609|CC|- - we also don't recommend the Lomotils for a situation that really hasn't developed yet. If you want to discuss it in more detail we can set up a private loop or go ahead as you wish. Over.
2411633|LMP|Standby a minute.
2411718|CMP|Hey, Gordo.
2411720|CC|Go ahead.
2411723|CMP|Yes, we'd like to talk to you further, please.
2411727|CC|Okay. Fine.
2411744|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 241 hours 18 minutes. We are going to configure the network for a private conversation between the Flight Surgeon, Dr. John Zeiglschmidt and Ron Evans, and we'll have a summary of the content of the private discussion as soon as possible afterwards. Evans had reported a few minutes ago that it had been a slight bit of gas. He requested permission to take a Lomotil, which is one of the pills in the medical kit, which slows down intestinal activity. The Surgeon recommended for gas that a gas pill be taken. Lomotil will not be taken for a problem that has not developed, but if Ron would like to discuss the situation further we would set up a private conversation and a private conversation has been requested and will be taking place shortly.
2415228|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 241 hours 53 minutes. A private conversation is in progress at this time, with Command Module Pilot, Ron Evans. The conversation was initiated at Evans' request at about 241 hours 22 minutes. Evans had previously asked permission to take a Lomotil tablet for what he described as mild gas. The flight surgeon, Dr. Zeiglschmidt had recommended that a gas pill be taken instead, and we told Evans that if he wished to discuss the situation in more detail, we would set up a private conversation. Evans requested a private conversation and that has been in progress since shortly after 241:22. Participants are Dr. John Zeiglschmidt, Dr. Willard Hawkins, Charles Lewis, the Flight Director, and spacecraft communicator, Gordon Fullerton. And we will have a summary of the conversation as soon as possible.
2415951|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 241 hours 59 minutes. The private conversation with Command Module Pilot Ron Evans has concluded.
2415959|CC|America, Houston. It looks good right now to start the roll for PTC.
2420007|CDR|Okay.
2420033|CDR|She's GO, Gordo.
2420035|CC|Okay.
2420108|PAO|Hello, this is Apollo Control. That private conversation ended at about 241 hours 59 minutes, and again we will have a summary, as soon as possible. At the present time, we're in the process of getting the spacecraft set up for the Passive Thermal Control mode rotating it about the longitudinal axis and we'll be going through the pre-sleep checklist, getting the crew set up to begin their sleep period, as close as possible to the Flight Plan time.
2420125|CC|America, Houston. Sleep configuration on the hydrogen fans, and you can do it now, is H2 TANK 1 FAN, OFF, and 3, AUTO. That's 1, OFF; 3, AUTO.
2420143|CDR|Okay, Gordy, we got 1, OFF and 3, AUTO.
2420146|CC|Thank you.
2420452|CC|America, Houston. Over.
2420457|CMP|Go ahead.
2420458|CC|On that PTC startup, there was only one jet that fired, and so we only got half the rate we need, and so the - I guess the only way to recover is to stop the roll and start damping the rates again and wait for our call to start it again - over again. Over.
2420524|CMP|Roger again.
2420528|CC|And we'd like the procedure on G8-2 using B-2 and D-2 for the spin up. Two jets.
2420545|CMP|Yes. That's interesting. B-2 and D-2 are both on.
2420556|CC|Okay, we understand that, Ron. Let us look into that a little further here, then.
2420603|CMP|I'm sorry. It's D-l and - Dog 1 and Bravo 2 are on.
2420610|CC|Okay, that's what did it.
2420614|CDR|Delta 1 and Bravo 2 is what it calls for, and that's what was on.
2420619|CMP|Yes, those are the wrong ones though; that's the problem.
2420652|CC|Well, we're reading it both in the checklist and Flight Plan; Bravo 2 and Delta 2 are the ones to use for spinup.
2420706|CMP|Yes, you're right. Okay. We got - we're reading the wrong ones, I guess.
2420749|CMP|Okay, Gordy, is this a good attitude or should we go back to the UV/PTC sleep attitude?
2420801|CC|Stand by. G&C is on the other loop here. Just a second.
2420832|CC|America, Houston. You need to go back to the pitch and yaw in the Flight Plan, and the present roll will be okay.
2420840|CMP|Okay.
2420852|CC|Also for this damping, we want you to go to the jets called out at 240:50 in the Flight Plan. That's a - Well, you got it there.
2420906|CMP|Yes, we got it here.
2421020|CMP|Okay, give us a call when we get all damped out there. We got Alfa and Bravo for damping jets.
2421032|CC|Roger.
2421039|CMP|Hey, wait a minute; we got the wrong ones here, again. We'll get back to the - what's in the Flight Plan and do it.
2421046|CC|Roger. I would think - You're firing into the SIM bay - bay with the present configuration.
2421054|CMP|You're right.
2421407|CDR|Hello, Houston; America.
2421409|CC|Go ahead.
2421413|CDR|Gordo, how's it looking for a midcourse 5? Any further word?
2421424|CC|Our last information was still a half a foot. Or essentially no midcourse. I'm not sure if we've been affected by the PTC here or not, the singlejet spinup, but we'll let you know.
2421442|CDR|Okay, fine. Don't worry about it. You won't have a final word on it until tomorrow anyway.
2421448|CC|That's affirmative. I doubt if we'll have any - enough tracking before bedtime here to give you any update tonight.
2421457|CDR|Okay, no problem.
2421510|CC|And we'd like you to configure the HIGH GAIN for us. We'd like PITCH, minus 40; and YAW, 90, on the dials and then go directly from AUTO to REACQ.
2421529|CDR|Okay, say again the numbers, Gordo. I'm sorry; I missed it.
2421532|CC|Okay, PITCH is minus 40 and YAW, plus 90.
2421542|CDR|Okay, minus 40 and a plus 9 - 90.
2421546|CC|That's affirmative.
2421551|CDR|And REACQ.
2421554|CC|Affirm.
2421558|CMP|Ohay, you have REACQ and NARROW.
2421600|CDR|REACQ and NARROW now.
2422056|CC|America, Houston. Over.
2422102|CMP|Go ahead.
2422104|CC|Okay, this SIM bay jett configuration just isn't hacking the job of damping the rates. We're going to go to adjacent quads to try to get it dampened quicker. We'd like you to enable Charlie and Delta. To do that, just disable all Alfa and Bravo jets, enable all Delta jets, and also Charlie 3. Over.
2422136|CDR|Okay, Gordo. Let me disable all Alfa and Bravo first.
2422148|CC|Okay, Geno. And then enable all Delta plus Charlie 3.
2422211|CDR|Okay. You don't want Charlie 4 enabled? Or you do? ... - -
2422217|CC|That's affirmative. But it is already.
2422220|CDR|Okay, you're - Yes, here's what I got. I got - I got Delta 1 and Delta 2 on B/D ROLL. I've got Charlie 3 and Charlie 4 for PITCH, and I've got Delta 3 and Delta 4 for YAW.
2422240|CC|Okay. That sounds exactly right.
2422941|CC|America, Houston.
2422947|CDR|America here.
2422949|CC|Okay. The rates look good now. I'd like you to use Bravo 2 and Delta 2, and go ahead and spin up.
2423005|CDR|Okay, Gordy. We'll do it - get it this time.
2423011|CC|Okay.
2423124|CC|America, Houston - -
2423125|CDR|Okay, Gordy; they're all off. They're all off except Bravo 2 and Delta 2.
2423132|CC|Roger.
2423151|CDR|Yes, we got the right amount that time. Let's hope it stays good.
2423155|CC|Okay. For Ron only, no Seconal tonight. Over.
2423208|CMP|Okay.
2424215|CC|America, Houston. G&C, with his years of experience, thinks that this PTC is going to hold. It's looking good so far, and so I think it's safe to go ahead and configure to go to sleep there, if you wish.
2424233|CDR|Okay, we're in the process now, Gordy. Thank you.
2430414|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 243 hours 4 minutes. The shifts here in the Mission Control Center will be changing shortly. Pete Frank, and the Orange team, will be relieving the White team. Change of shift news conference is estimated for 1 AM Central Standard Time in the MSC news center briefing room. The crew is in the final portion of the presleep checklist and should be turning in shortly. At this time Apollo 17 is 16,242 nautical miles from the Moon traveling at a velocity of 4062 feet per second.
2430725|CDR|Hello, Houston; America.
2430730|CC|Hello, America; Houston. Over.
2430736|CDR|Bob?
2430737|CC|That is affirm.
2430741|CDR|Okay. We're just about ready to turn out the lights. By my watch, about 7:20 in the morning is wakeup time, and I got the other guys on their couches and I'm going to stand the duty tonight and I'm going to leave my lightweight headset in my ear. But if the high gain bothers me during this PTC, I want to go ahead and take it out. And I've got the tone booster connected up and it does work. So, in any event, give me a crew alert in the morning, will you?
2430813|CC|Okay. You want a - are you telling me you want to get woke up after 8 hours or at 7:20 as planned?
2430821|CDR|No, as - as by the Flight Plan. We've got to get up as by the Flight Plan.
2430824|CC|Okay. Talk to you in the morning. And we'd like OPTICS POWER, OFF, ... - -
2430829|CDR|- - ... Okay, I just didn't want you to ... yes, sir; we'll get the OPTICS POWER, OFF, and we'll get the VOICE, OFF, too.
2430841|CC|Okay; that suits - makes everybody happy - -
2430842|CDR|Okay, we'll see you in the morning then.
2430844|CC|See you in the morning.
2430847|CDR|Okay, babe.
2431021|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 243 hours 10 minutes. We have said goodnight to the crew and the downlink subcarrier has been turned off on the spacecraft so we do not expect to talk to them any more this evening. As you heard Gene Cernan, the crew intends to stick to the Flight Plan rest period even though they got to bed a little bit late. Wakeup time at 250 hours 30 minutes or about 7:20 AM Central Standard Time tomorrow. We'll keep the line up for a few more minutes in case there's any post scripts from the crew, then we'll take the line down and come back up hourly. At 243 hours 11 minutes this is Mission Control, Houston.
2442310|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 244 hours 23 minutes. The change of shift news conference will be begin in approximately 10 minutes in the MSC News Center Briefing Room. Participants will be the Flight Director from the previous shift, Charles Lewis, and the Flight Surgeon, Dr. John Zieglschmid. There was a private conversation with the Command Module, Ronald Evans, between 241 hours 22 minutes and 241 hours 59 minutes. The private conversation was initiated at Evans' request after he had ask permission to take a Lomotil, a medication to reduce gastrointestinal activity. Participants in the private conversation were Dr. Royce Hawkins, Dr. John Zieglschmid, Flight Director Charles Lewis, and CAPCOM Gordon Fullerton. Evans said he had had a continuation of a gas problem, mentioned previously by all 3 crewmen. Both Evans and Gene Cernan said their main concern was for tomorrow's EVA. Dr. Hawkins and Dr. Zieglschmid recommended Evans take 2 Lomotil tablets tonight and 2 more after breakfast to reduce gastrointestinal activity. They recommended that he take a semethocone tablet after meals for gas. They also recommended changes in Evans' breakfast menu tomorrow. Asked if the other 2 crewmen had had problems similar to Evans, Cernan reported that he and Jack Schmitt had had persistant gas which the crew felt was aggrivated by hydrogen dissolved in the water used for rehydrating foods onboard the spacecraft. The crew reported the gas caused occasional discomfort, but that there was no serious problem such as nausea or pain. Dr. Hawkins said he was confident the medication and dietary changes recommended for Evans would preclude any problem for tomorrow's EVA. The news conference should begin approximately 5 or 6 minutes. We've had no further communications with the crew since saying goodnight to them about an hour ago. All going well aboard spacecraft America which is now 19,454 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity 3,997 feet per second. At 244 hours 26 minutes this is Mission Control, Houston.
2453701|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 245 hours 37 minutes. All going well with Apollo 17. The spacecraft, America is 22,219 nautical miles from the Moon. Velocity 3,955 feet per second. 4 hours and 52 minutes remaining in the crew rest period. At 245 hours 37 minutes this is mission Control Houston.
2463709|PAO|This is Apollo Control. 3 hours and 52 minutes remaining in the crew's resting period. All spacecraft systems continuing to perform well. Apollo 17, now at 24.542 nautical miles from the Moon. Drawing closer to the Earth at a velocity of 3,926 feet per second. At 246 hours 37 minutes this is Mission Control Houston.
2473805|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 247 hours 38 minutes. Apollo 17 now 26,914 nautical miles from the Moon. Traveling at a velocity of 3,902 feet per second. 2 hours 50 minutes remaining in the crew rest period. The spacecraft America will pass out of the lunar sphere of influence at an elapsed time of 250 hours 39 minutes 50 seconds. At that time it will be 33,822 nautical miles from the Moon and 171,593 nautical miles from the Earth. At 247 hours 39 minutes this is Mission Control Houston.
2483630|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Apollo 17 now 29,143 nautical miles from the Moon; velocity 3,883 feet per second. All spacecraft systems performing well, and 1 hour and 52 minutes remaining in the crew's rest period. At 248 hours 37 minutes, this is Mission Control, Houston.
2493701|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 249 hours 37 minutes. 52 minutes remains in the crew's rest period as Apollo 17 is 31,446 nautical miles from the Moon; velocity 3,866 feet per second. Apollo 17 will leave the Moon's sphere of influence at 250 hours 39 minutes 50 seconds at which time it will be 33,822 nautical miles from the Moon and 171,593 nautical miles from the Earth. The time at which Apollo 17 will achieve velocity match - that is the velocity both Earth referenced and Moon referenced will be the same - is 268 hours, 25 minutes, no seconds. At that time the velocity will be 3,839 feet per second referenced to both the Earth and the Moon. And Apollo 17 at velocity match will be 73,775 nautical miles from the Moon, and 137,356 nautical miles from Earth. The Flight Dynamics officer has also computed a couple of other milestones: The one-half way in time will occur at 270 hours 30 minutes 7 seconds; distance from Earth, at that time, will be 132,654 nautical miles, and from the Moon 78,504 nautical miles. The half way in distance mark will be reached at 281 hours 32 minutes 45 seconds. Apollo 17's distance at that time from both the Earth and the Moon will be 104,396 nautical miles. At 249 hours 39 minutes, this is Mission Control, Houston.
2502800|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 250 hours 28 minutes. We're 2 minutes away from crew wakeup. Apollo 17 is 33,382 nautical miles from the Moon, velocity 3,853 feet per second. We'll standby now for the first call of the crew.
2503001|CC|(Music: HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS)
2503254|CDR|Good morning, Robert. Good morning.
2503256|CC|Good morning, Geno.
2503302|CDR|Hey, your choice of music is getting better down there. We're going to have to keep you there every morning.
2503312|CC|Well, if I'm here waking you up on Wednesday morning, fellow, you're in trouble.
2503321|CDR|Yes, we're not going to count Wednesday. We'll - we'll work out something else for Wednesday. I - I know we're not much, but we're all you got for Christmas.
2503357|PAO|The wakeup song was, HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS sung by Jerry Vale.
2503503|CC|Okay, America, this is Houston. One little update for you on today's plans. At the present time, midcourse 5 is looking like a quarter of a foot per second, which means at the present time, we're not planning on burning it. But we reserve the right to change our mind sometime in the next hour and a half, if necessary. But that'll give you some thought to what to do today.
2503529|CDR|Very good, Bob. Outstanding. We'll go along with whatever you want.
2503535|CC|You guys are getting easy.
2503541|CDR|Oh, we get more likable as days go on.
2503821|CMP|Good morning, Houston. This is the Command Module Pilot of the spaceship America. And we're up and ready to particpita - participate in another day's activities.
2503833|CC|I got you there, Ron. And we're ready to part - participate with you, also.
2503842|CMP|(Laughter) Okay, Robert.
2503858|CDR|Got cold up here last night.
2503901|CC|Well, I'll tell you, it was 27 at Ellington at 6 o'clock down here, too.
2503909|CDR|Well, it's not quite that cold in here, but there sure is a difference.
2503956|CDR|And, Bob, how's America looking to you down there?
2504005|CC|We're looking pretty good. We found nothing overnight to give us any concern, and we see nothing at the present time. Looks great. We're showing you at 66 degrees in the cabin.
2504022|CDR|Yes, sir. We're going to get it warmed up here, though ... - shortly. Okay; America still looks good to us.
2504107|CC|And, America, you're now in the Earth control. We passed about 2 minutes ago.
2504120|CDR|What was our - what was our velocity going through the changeover in influence?
2504126|CC|Stand by.
2504157|CC|And, Geno, you had 3851 feet per second going through the crossover.
2504207|CDR|Okay. We're looking back at a - a very full and very bright, very beautiful Moon, right now. And the Man in the Moon is smiling as he's waving us on home.
2504230|CC|Copy that. We had a good picture of him last night here down in Houston, also.
2505226|CC|America, Houston. Over.
2505232|LMP|Go ahead.
2505233|CC|Okay. We lost you there with an antenna change that we didn't catch. So we're back with you again.
2505242|LMP|Yes, we noticed that.
2505257|LMP|Hey, Bob. What time does the old back room get up this morning?
2505303|CC|Which back room?
2505307|LMP|The geology back room, of course.
2505309|CC|Well, beats me. I don't know if there's anyone down there or not. Let me see if I can find out.
2505316|LMP|No, that's all right, Bob. I just want you to pass on a thought. I had a little trouble getting to sleep last night. And they've probably already thought of it. But it has to do with Van Serg.
2505331|CC|Go ahead. I'll copy it down.
2505336|LMP|No, just ask them if they've thought about the possibility that the - those Van Serg breccias might be - might be the old indurated regolith over the subfloor.
2505401|CC|Okay; I got that.
2505407|LMP|That's an alternative that in the - the heat of battle did not occur to me at the time. It should have, and it may have occurred to some of them.
2505417|CC|Okay. Thats as opposed to being a window through - to the - below the subfloor, which is what you suggested the other night.
2505425|LMP|Yes, sir. I think I - I think I like the regolith better. It - I think it makes sense from a lot of points of view: the size of the crater, the fact that we should have expected to see something but hadn't up to that time.
2505439|CC|Okay. I got that.
2505448|LMP|And the breccias were, thinking back on it, could very easily have been soil breccias and just getting coarser as you got closer to the base of the sub - to the top of the subfloor, which is what we were looking at down in the bottom of the crater.
2505507|CC|Okay. Got that.
2510001|LMP|Bob, is your EECOM friend going to let us practice the waste water dump again today?
2510011|CC|I kind of expect so. Stand by and let me find out for sure. Roger, Jack. There's one coming up at 252:50, about 2 hours from now.
2510033|LMP|Okay. We'll start reviewing that one. We'll be ready for him this time.
2510042|CC|We won't let you sneak behind the Moor, on this one.
2510348|LMP|Very good.
2511548|LMP|Houston, 17.
2511604|CC|America, Houston. Go ahead.
2511610|LMP|Who's the EECOM this morning?
2511614|CC|Charlie Dumis.
2511621|LMP|Hey, ask Charlie if it's all right if I turn on the commander's heaters?
2511635|CC|We don't - Would you clarify that request?
2511645|CC|I'll tell you - you can - you can use reel 2. About the only thing I can think of, Jack, would be reel 2.
2511714|CC|Jack, you might use reel 2 if you want to. It's about the only thing we can think of.
2511725|LMP|Yes, you get the idea.
2511734|LMP|Anyway, it's cold.
2511737|CC|Roger.
2511745|LMP|It's not really that bad, Bob, but we're hearing a lot about it.
2511750|CC|Okay. Well, we'll work it out here, if we can try.
2511757|LMP|Well, you might discuss it with SPAN.
2511801|CC|We are, believe me.
2511804|CDR|I'd like not to - like not to waste reel 2. It's got some other good uses.
2514319|CC|America, 17. Say again - America, this is Houston.
2514329|LMP|Are you sure? Would you like to try again?
2514331|CC|Well, that's all right, Jack. We'll live with it for a while. We're looking at - and no need to acknowledge this - we're looking at your temperature problem. And there's a couple of obvious things I'm sure you've undertaken, but if you haven't, all the window shades off. Get some sunlight in there. And might crank on all the lights to get some more heat load in there. Also the - of course, the cabin fan and the temperature - CABIN TEMP control thumbwheel - it's your option on that. The other things, like mixing valve adjustment and powering up other items, we're looking at very seriously, but we would like to not do those items until after the EVA this morning. We'd like to remain the status quo on the ECS system with the exception of - you do have the cabin fans on your option there. But we would like to re - retain the rest of it status quo until after the EVA.
2514431|LMP|Well, thank you for all your research in there, Bob. I'll let the commander make the decisions. It - it's his thermostat.
2514443|CC|Roger.
2514445|CMP|The CMP feels pretty good so -
2514452|CDR|l'll see if they can get me mad this morning. That'll warm things up. Temperature's on the way up.
2514507|CC|Roger. Trying to get reel 2 up to you, if you want.
2514514|CDR|Pardon.
2514516|CC|Said, I'll bring reel 2 up to you, if I can get there.
2514524|CDR|Well, reel 2 would sure be a ... start when you consider all I've got is Ron and Jack.
2515748|CDR|Hello, Houston; America.
2515752|CC|Yes, sir.
2515756|CDR|Okay, Bob, before we exit PTC at 20 past the next hour, we'll have to get your final words on the midcourse.
2515811|CC|Well, we're working up the midcourse right now, but let's give you some preliminary words, that you won't exit PTC at that time because midcourse 5 is not required - it's less than 0.3 foot per second. Right now your gamma - flight path angle, et cetera, at entry interface is all nominal, and absolutely no midcourse 5 required at this time. And we'll be updating that as we refine the data.
2515834|CDR|Okay, well, that's - okay, well, we still exit PTC, Bob. We go to a different attitude. We - Yes, you have a different roll angle. I'm looking at the right-hand column of the - of the Flight Plan. Yes, we still exit, so we're going to need some words on it by then.
2515912|CC|Stand by on that. I've just got - back at 252:20. I was just given the word that we will not -
2515933|CDR|It's just a case of using coupled or uncoupled jets, Bob.
2520018|LMP|Bob, you want the IR on?
2520022|CC|Roger. We're ready for it.
2520027|LMP|MARK it. It's ON.
2520159|CC|America, Houston. We'll assume right now - go ahead and fly the Flight Plan using the notes - on the right-hand column there as - as filed, or as planned.
2520216|CDR|You say we will use the notes on the right-hand side, correct?
2520219|CC|That's affirmative. And we have one update. We would like to move up to 252:10. We'd like to move up the IR COVER, OPEN - -
2520235|CDR|Go ahead.
2520237|CC|- - ... - we'd like to move up the IR COVER, OPEN, which is at 252:22, - move that up to 252:10 - just put an arrow up there, please.
2520250|CDR|Okay, we got it.
2520450|CDR|Hello, Houston; America.
2520453|CC|Yes, sir. Go ahead.
2520456|CDR|Quick update on the crew status report. The well being of the crew is very satisfactory, capable of carrying out everything that is required today. And, specifically, the health of the crew is excellent.
2520517|CC|That's real good news.
2520523|CDR|Okay.
2520538|CC|Just for your information, Ron gets the same treatment today that the two - you two surface walkers got. During the mission, channel 8 in Houston is going to carry the full spacewalk in its entirety on live television.
2520557|CMP|Hey, Bob, I think that's outstanding. Thank you.
2520810|CC|America, Houston. I've got a Flight Plan update for you.
2520817|LMP|Go ahead, Bob.
2520819|CC|Okay, first of all - at 252:20, where it says, "Exit G&N PTC at roll angle 071," change the high-gain angles there to minus, a pitch of minus 64, yaw, 32 - 329.
2520840|LMP|Okay, we got those.
2520842|CC|Okay, at 252:30, close UV cover. And that's to be done regardless of the fact that we're scrubbing midcourse 5. Just close UV cover at 252:30.
2520901|CDR|Okay.
2520904|CC|And if you'll jump over to 262:10 - 262:10, we've got a change on that attitude - as we're just tweaking it up a little bit - 039, 230, 297; HIGH GAIN angle: PITCH, minus 9; YAW, 339.
2520934|CDR|039, 230, 297, minus 9, and 339.
2520939|CC|That's affirm. We're just shooting a slightly different point with the UV at that time.
2520945|CDR|Okay.
2521036|CDR|We're ready to - No, stand by.
2521050|CC|And we've copied the 93s. You can go ahead and torque.
2521056|CMP|Okay. We'll torque at 11.
2521207|LMP|Okay, the IR COVER is OPEN.
2521212|CC|Roger. Good show.
2522000|CC|America, Houston.
2522022|CDR|Houston, America. Did you call?
2522025|CC|Roger. I called, but we're about ready to lose the high gain. I'll call you back as soon as we get back in.
2522446|CMP|Houston, America.
2522449|CC|Go ahead, Houston. Say it again - Go ahead, America.
2522455|CMP|(Laughter) Okay, we've got the commander's menu for yesterday.
2522501|CC|Roger. We're all listening.
2522506|CMP|Okay. Scrambled eggs, bacon squares, pineapple drink, orange drink, plain old coffee, and 10 pecans - that's 10 nuts, not packages. And a vitamin. For lunch: bread, a chocolate bar, an orange drink, and a can of tunafish. For dinner: a beefa steaka, butterscotch pudding, peaches, orange drink, and catsup. Medical: 17055, about 5 hours of fair, no medication, 4-1/2 cans of water. For the old Lunar Module Pilot: scrambled eggs, an orange PA drink, coffee, sugar cookie, and two pecans - that's two nuts, not two packages, and a vitamin. For lunch: peanut butter, jelly, bread, orange GF drink, pork and potatoes, coffee, and a fruitcake. For dinner: beefa steaka, butterscotch pudding, one peach, orange drink, and a coffee. The LMP medical log - he had about 6 hours of good sleep, no medication, and two cans of water.
2522743|CC|Break, Ron. We're going to have an antenna switch coming up. We'll call you back when we get good comm.
2522751|CMP|Okay.
2522919|CC|Okay, America. We're back with you.
2522927|CMP|Okay. Just a second.
2522935|CC|Just a reminder on the food report, if you want to shorten them. It's normally used negative reporting - only those things you don't eat on the menu.
2522954|CMP|Oh, well. I like to talk.
2522957|CC|Roger.
2523001|CMP|Okay, for the Command Module Pilot. For breakfast, he ate everything. Okay, for lunch - let's see, he ate everything down to the bread, then he had three slices of bread, didn't eat the cherry bar, add a tea, a chocolate bar, and a pack - Wait a minute, I've got the wrong day, sorry. Negate everything I've said on the CMP. Okay, we're on the CMP again. This time, it's day 11. Okay, make it six bacon squares instead of eight, didn't eat the peaches, add a coffee, package of brownies, and 10 pecans. And the vitamin, ate the vitamin. Okay, for lunch, scratch the cherry bar and add a coffee. For supper, add a catsup. Okay, CMP's medical log: 15054, about 6 hours of good, two Lomotil, two sniffs of nosedrops, four cans of water.
2523505|CDR|Okay, Bob. We've stopped PTC, and we've got SIM bay jets on.
2523512|CC|Roger.
2523526|CC|And, America. We'd like to cov - close the UV cover, please.
2523535|LMP|Okay, the COVER's now CLOSED.
2523716|CC|America, Houston. If you're all on the headset, if you'd like, we've got the news for the morning.
2523726|CDR|Okay; we're all on.
2523729|CC|Okay. We start today's newscast out with this historical fact. Today marks the 69th anniversary of man's first flight in a heavier-than-air powered machine. Back on December 17, 1903, Wilbur and Orville Wright, of Dayton, Ohio, took three historic flights on the sand beaches of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. The brothers will be honored today at a ceremony at a visitor's center near the flying site. Now, a look at the news. There's apparently been a serious hitch in the peace talks between the U.S. and North Vietnam. Dr. Henry Kissinger, in a curt news conference at the White House, has said that the North Vietnamese have reneged on earlier agreements and have brought out - brought the peace talks to a halt. Dr. Kissinger said the unresolved problems, which center around the number of peace supervisors and their placement, is not acceptable to the President, and Kissinger feels, and we quote, "We have not yet reached an agreement that the President considers just and fair." Final unofficial returns from the Federally supervised election name Arnold Miller the new president of the United Mine Workers. His victory over Tony Boyle appears to be only his first step in his promise to clean up the union. Former President Truman remains in serious condition at a Kansas City hospital. Doctors say that the 88-year old Truman is not responding to treatment. In the congressional spotlight in Washington, it appears that the contest for the position of House Majority Leader will be between Representative Thomas O'Neal of Massachusetts and Congressman Sam Gibbons of Florida. The two will vie for the post left vacant by the absent and presumed death of Congressman Hale Boggs. Boggs disappeared in the crash of a light plane in Alaska, in October. Northeastern Ohio has been blasted by a blizzard. As much as 28 inches of snow has fallen, blocking highways and closing airports. An additional foot is expected - was expected before it was to move east. Cleveland has been very hard hit with the white stuff, and the snow is now moving into the northeast. They'll have a white Christmas up that way. Here in Clear Lake, it's a clear, crispy day, but a chilly Sunday morning. Ellington had a 27 this morning. Might take a look at sports here. Miami defeated Baltimore yesterday 16 to 0, to go undefeated in the American Football Conference of the NFL.
2524014|CC|America, Houston. The UV COVER appears on our telemetry to still be OPEN. Could you cycle it and see if we can get it CLOSED, or just give us what your onboard talkback looks like.
2524031|LMP|Okay, Bob. I got it - I only got it to the intermediate position.
2524040|CC|Roger; thank you.
2524042|CC|Okay. In a real hair raiser at Candlestick Park, San Francisco, John Brodie came off the bench late in the game, in fact, in the last 2 minutes of the third quarter, and led the 49ers to a 20 to 17 win over the Minnesota Vikings. The win gives the Western Division crown to the 49ers in the National Conference. His - the last touchdown thrown was with 5 seconds remaining in the game. That puts the Washington Redskins, Green Bay, San Francisco, and Dallas Cowboys in the NFC playoffs and closes out the NFC contest. In the American Conference, there's one key game today to decide the winner of the Central Division. Pittsburgh plays San Diego and Cleveland plays the New York Jets. Both Cleveland and Pittsburgh will get into the playoff's, but their position in the standings is not yet known. One will be the wild-card team, one will be the conference - division winner. Miami and Oakland are the other teams in the American Conference playoffs. Cincinnati plays here at Houston. And we'll keep you posted on that one. In local high school football, Baytown Sterling scored a major upset by defeating San Antonio Lee in the 4A semifinals. The score was 21 to 20 and the game in the Astrodome before 26,000 fans. The loss was the first in 28 games for the San Antonio school. In basketball, the Houston Cougars downed California last night, 79 to 75. Some other major college scores: Kansas, 60, over San Francisco, 58; Penn State, 65, over Boston, 63; New Mexico State, 69, Texas El Paso, 49; Indiana, 89, Ohio, 68; Minnesota, 87, Loyola, 81; Florida State, 85, Baylor, 67. And in pro basketball, Houston defeated the Detroit Pistons, 123 to 112. And just a final note from all your friends down at Cape Kennedy, they'd just like you to know that the Merritt island High School won the Florida State Championship, defeating Tallahassee Leon High School, 40 to 21. And, that's pretty much the update for the morning.
2524255|CDR|Thank you, Robert, for that Sunday morning news break.
2524408|CDR|Houston, America. Are we GO for the fuel cell and the waste water dump and the other dumps to go?
2524416|CC|Roger. You're GO for that, and we're watching them down here.
2524422|CDR|Okay, we'll start the waste water dump.
2524739|CC|17, Houston. We'd like AUTO on the HIGH GAIN.
2524819|CC|America, Houston. I don't think I ever updated your consumables, and just a real quick update. You're above the line on all your oxygen tanks. You're above the Flight Plan line on all your hydrogen tanks or right on the line. And you're 3 percent above the line on the RCS. That's Flight Plan usage at this time, so you're above the line on everything.
2524847|CMP|Okay, Houston. Thanks much.
2524946|CC|America, Houston. The MC&W on the FUEL CELL an O2 FLOW HIGH is normal.
2524956|LMP|Yes. I guess I finally learned that, Bob, and it didn't bother me a bit.
2525225|CC|America, Houston. While you're working on the fuel cell area there, we'd like to reconfigure our H2 tank fans. We'd like H2 tank 2 FANs to ON, H2 tank 3 FANs to OFF.
2525243|LMP|Okay, you got it.
2530610|CC|For a while, until things stabilize.
2530616|CC|America, Houston.
2530619|CDR|Go ahead.
2530621|CC|We haven't heard any report from you on - and we're just kind of curious. Have you had a lot of condensation moisture around the cockpit?
2530632|CDR|Negative. No, it's been very dry.
2530636|CC|Okay; real good. Well, just a reminder; may not be applicable if you've got a good dry cockpit there. On 16 we had some - rather strange readings on the EVAP OUT temperature and a few other ones. And the potential is there for you to get those same readings - especially if you had had moisture - the potential is to get those readings at - after depress, and we'll be watching it closely. I guess - I don't want to say just ignore them, but we'll be watching them and take any readings for after depress there with a grain of salt. And while you're at it, you might go down and zero the optics If you've got somebody in the LEB.
2530716|CDR|Okay, Bob, stand by. We'll get that. Listen, the tunnel is dry up to the hatch. However, when you put your hand up in the tunnel around the - the edge of the hatch and on the - on the outer periphery of the hatch itself, there is quite a bit of moisture up there. We looked up there yesterday and couldn't find any, but there is some up there today. And the face of the hatch is slightly moist, but it's not - nothing like bubbles.
2530745|CC|Okay. Well, we just want you to be aware that you may see some extraneous ECS readings. It's no problem at all, but, you know, just wanted you to be aware of it.
2530825|CC|Gene, the specific thing on 16 that occurred was - as we thought it out was that the ECU control unit back of that panel there had the freezing - we think - freezing of the water on it, causing the bad readings.
2530846|CDR|Okay. When we changed the canister this morning, Ron tells me, there was water back there, too.
2530853|CC|Okay. We'll just - we can just expect some possible erroneous readings.
2531004|CDR|OPTICS to ZERO. G/N POWER is OFF.
2531052|CDR|Houston, America.
2531055|CC|Go, America.
2531059|CDR|Okay, Bob. We're eliminating everything in the Flight Plan between 253:10, where you terminate the waste water dump, which has been done, and we're picking it up on EVA Checklist at 253:50.
2531117|CC|Okay; that sounds great, Geno. Press.
2531124|CDR|Okay.
2531134|CC|And, 17, if we could have ACCEPT, we'll give you state vector.
2531143|CDR|Okay, Mr. R. You've got ACCEPT.
2531146|CC|Okay.
2531351|CC|Say again? Oh, the computer's yours, America.
2531400|CDR|Okay; thank you. The computer is ours.
2531403|CC|Roger.
2531638|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 253 hours 16 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 16 [sic] coasting home now 167,091 nautical miles out from Earth. Velocity 3,034 feet per second. Midcourse correction burn number 5, which is nominally scheduled at 253 hours 42 minutes Ground Elapsed Time will not be performed in as much as the correction is less than a half foot per second required. Meanwhile, the spaceflight meterology group with the National Weather Service said this morning that weather conditions are expected to be satisfactory for the landing and recovery of Apollo 17 on Tuesday. The weather forecast for the planned landing area, approximately 360 nautical miles southeast of Pago Pago, calls for partly cloudly skies, widely scattered rain showers, variable winds at 10 miles per hour, seas at 3 feet, and the temperature near 80 degrees. Still approximately 4 hours away from the transearth EVA in which Command Module Pilot, Ron Evans, will go hand over hand back to the SIM bay and retrieve film cassettes from the cameras and instruments in the SIM bay, pass them back into the Command Module for return home. At 253:18 still up live as long as the crew is awake, this is Apollo Control.
2532223|LMP|Houston, 17.
2532229|CC|Go ahead, America.
2532234|LMP|Yes, take a look at the LMPs biomed and see how it looks to you this morning.
2532249|CC|LMPs biomed looks pretty good, America.
2532252|LMP|Okay.
2534328|CMP|Okay, Houston. The Command Module Pilot biomed should be on the line.
2534334|CC|Okay, Ron. We'll give you a word here.
2534405|CC|Ron, your biomed looks great.
2534412|CMP|Okay; mighty fine.
2535153|CMP|Hello, Houston. We just turned the CABIN FAN, OFF.
2535157|CC|Roger. We are copying it - cabin temp around 70. is it a little more comfortable?
2535206|CMP|Well, we got two extremes.
2535209|CC|Okay.
2535326|CMP|Okay; let's see now, the EVA umbilical bag is on the rock boxes - on the - LiOH cans now. What's next, Jack?
2535340|LMP|Yes.
2535432|CC|America, we're showing - -
2535433|CMP|... Go ahead.
2535439|CC|- - we're showing a slightly high O2 flow. We're just wondering if all the waste compartment vents and all your dump vents are closed as per the Flight Plan.
2535452|CMP|Well, as a matter of face, no. OVERBOARD DRAIN was OPEN - Let's see, BATTERY VENT's CLOSED during the water dump, but now it's to VENT. WASTE STOWAGE VENT is now CLOSED. We're thinking about opening that WASTE STOWAGE VENT, anyhow, to keep any possible breakage in there from coming back into the cabin. And that way it might go outside during the depress instead of inside. What do you all think of that?
2535525|CC|Let us debate that one. It sounds pretty good, but let us debate it here.
2535530|CMP|Okay.
2535532|CDR|Tom, the principle concern is those BUSS samples.
2535538|CC|Roger. I understand your concern. I - we'll work on it here. I don't think there's any problem to it.
2535546|CDR|Okay. But all I'm saying is that the BUSS samples have never flown before.
2535608|LMP|Yes, the EVA umbilical bag is snapped on there. Okay. They're hooked up there, but let me make sure it's hooked down at the bottom this time.
2535626|CDR|I don't think - I don't think it has been yet. Yes, it would, as a matter of fact.
2535804|LMP|Okay; the A-2 rock bag is tied up. Yes.
2535818|CDR|Okay; that A-7 bag's all squared away. Okay; and let's see what we got there, so we can reach those at the bottom. Temporary storage bag is clear in the top. Yes, we want to leave them there so I can open the bottom. Are they tied up? Okay; here we are. Okay.
2535854|LMP|Yes, I'll have to. Oh, it will hold up there as long as I snap it. Yes, the LEVA bags are okay.
2535912|CMP|Okay. We got everything we want in the jett bag now?
2535955|CMP|Hey, Houston, this is America. Obviously I'm on VOX here, so I'll try and keep you informed on how things are going.
2540015|CC|America, Houston.
2540020|CMP|Okay; go ahead.
2540021|CC|Some words concerning the waste management vent. We really don't care what you do with it up - now until a period 20 minutes prior to your suit integrity check. We would like to have it closed for a good stabilized reading during suit integrity check, and it requires to be closed 20 minutes prior to that time for a stabilized flow. After the suit integrity check, if you desire to open it during the cabin depress, that's okay with us.
2540049|CMP|Okay. We'll leave it closed now, and during cabin depress, we'll probably open it then.
2540057|CC|Okay. Would you like us to remind you on it or just press on like you are doing?
2540102|CMP|Yes, that's affirm. We can use all the help we can get.
2540107|CC|Roger.
2540113|CMP|Okay.
2540305|CDR|Okay, Jack. The jett bag is taped. Okay. Temporarily stowed.
2540322|LMP|We're down to mag already.
2540326|CDR|On the camera, yes. Okay; 8. Okay. Yes, this is a biggy. Okay, let me verify. I think I've already got that. Ah ha, there it is. Yes. Ah ha, there it is.
2540357|CMP|Okay; we've got that one. Check it. Yes; we're okay. Yes. I don't have mine on yet, but here it is. Yes, it's there. It's installed. Jack screws are fully open. Yes, I - I got it open, but I didn't take anything out. Everything was already out.
2540444|CDR|Okay; TV pole. Right hand. Yes, I knew, rock box. No, not for me. Look good.
2540526|CMP|Gene, do you know how to run an extension on the OPS (laughter)? Okay.
2540546|CMP|Okay. What did you say? You want A-2 now?
2540559|CDR|Okay; we're A-2.
2540607|CDR|Okay, Houston; America. The OPS checks out at 5900 psi and is regulating to 3.9.
2540616|CC|Roger, Gene.
2540649|LMP|Okay. The old PGA bag is installed.
2540706|CMP|Okay. And the EV gloves are on. Okay?
2540814|CDR|For some reason, they're called entry boots up here.
2540836|LMP|Okay. Tiedown rope. Where does it go? Okay. And the - Okay; everything goes ...
2540857|LMP|Okay. Vac bag is in there, headrest pads, tiedown ropes, and heel clips.
2541002|LMP|Okay; lunar sounder cassette bag is in the EVA bag.
2541010|CDR|Yes.
2541016|LMP|What'd we do with that tissue dispenser, Gene?
2541022|CDR|We use it up?  ... new one.
2541049|LMP|Yes, just like that. Ah ha, there's the old pressure gauge. And it reads 0.
2541114|CDR|Okay. It's in the wrist tether pouch?
2541118|LMP|Ah-ha, you're ... too.
2541132|CDR|Okay. Ah ha ...?
2541140|LMP|Yes.
2541147|CDR|(Laughter) I was just acting surprised; I really know where they go. That's a little - We listen that way.
2541202|LMP|They're not on yet.
2541209|CMP|Can't hold everything still to get the thing in there.
2541220|LMP|Bag go in there? Got it all stowed?
2541228|CMP|Oh, yes.
2541257|LMP|Hand controllers are stowed.
2541321|LMP|Okay; counterbalance is all squared away.
2541324|CDR|Yes.
2541325|LMP|Okay?
2541338|CDR|What kind of - what kind of lens?
2541352|LMP|Keep it in F-1 all the time.
2541401|LMP|Let's use that other DAC. It goes on the pole with the but you can hook her up. Well, let's put it on the pole first, I guess.
2541427|LMP|A-1, decon bag.
2541430|CDR|Oh, okay. I didn't know what you meant. I've got to get in A-1 is what you are saying.
2541454|LMP|Don't forget my jett bag is down there. Okay; the old jett bag's on the other side now.
2541553|CDR|In the volkswagen pocket.
2541558|LMP|Here Gene, can you attach this to something up there? Okay.
2541646|LMP|... out here again.
2541649|CDR|... all this dirt out here again.
2541712|LMP|Okay, you get that ... finished?
2541746|CDR|Here we go. Here comes the cable. Here comes the monitor. Well, go that way, I guess. Oh, okay.
2541830|CDR|Here it is. There's the tape. Okay. What else do we need out of the - out of the A-1? Yes. Yes. Yes. Package of towels. Oh, okay. That's right. We need a package of towels, don't we? That's to clean off the - all the stuff when we bring it back in, you know? Who - whose towel do we use? Do we use the commander's? Well, I'll use one of mine (laughter). Okay; here's the package of towels.
2541937|LMP|Okay; you got a bunch of them? We're only going to need three or four.
2541950|CDR|Yes. Well, yes. You guys aren't, but I still am.
2541956|LMP|Yes, okay. Well, I'm not really pressurized either, I guess -
2542013|CDR|Okay; that's A-1.
2542050|LMP|Okay.
2542055|CDR|The cable; the TV.
2542244|LMP|- cable on there first. Let's hook the cable up.
2542445|LMP|They should be okay, but ...
2542638|LMP|It just hooks like that.
2542658|CMP|Got one?
2542659|LMP|Got one.
2543017|CMP|Houston, in case you're wondering, we're still routing cables.
2543022|CC|Roger. We've got you down in the checklist, the step just prior to "S-BAND AUX TV to SCI." Do you concur on that?
2543031|CMP|Yes. We're still keeping TV and DAC cables and what have you up to the pole.
2543038|CC|Roger. We get you Ron.
2543248|LMP|... before we run out of those.
2543549|CC|America, Houston.
2543553|CMP|Yes, go ahead.
2543554|CC|Is Gene in the commander's seat at this time?
2543559|CMP|That's affirm.
2543601|CC|Okay; I'll delay then - a minute here. We're going to have a VERB 49 maneuver coming up to you. We're getting the SIM bay a little bit cold, and we want to warm up those handrails, so we'll be maneuvering here at about 4 - At 254:45, I'll have a maneuver for you.
2543620|CMP|Okay; we're ready from now on any time.
2543624|CC|Just stand by. We want to check out the numbers. I just wanted to give you the word that we were going to make this maneuver.
2543632|CMP|Any time, Bob.
2543806|LMP|Well, you're going to have to put on your helmet - It's really over that way a little bit more, because I got to get into the hatch to get it out.
2543815|LMP|Okay. Well, anyhow that's all taped up. ... next. Okay.
2543837|LMP|There's the old ... IV tether.
2543905|CMP|Ah. Found something we didn't practice.
2543908|CC|America, Houston. I've got the VERB 49 maneuver.
2543910|CDR|Oh. Okay. Go ahead with the numbers.
2543920|CC|Okay. It's ROLL, 150; PITCH, 216; YAW, 330. And that's - we'd like that maneuver to start at 254:45 Just prior to starting that maneuver, we'd like the IR COVER CLOSED and the IR OFF.
2543956|CDR|Okay. At 24:45 you want 150, 216, and 330. Prior to maneuver, you want IR CLOSED and OFF. And what about the jets on that, Bob?
2544012|CC|The same jets you have configured. Did you read ROLL, 150; PITCH, 216; and YAW, 330: is that what you read?
2544020|CDR|That's what I read, and I'll stay in SIM bay jets.
2544023|CC|Okay, and you'll need these new high-gain antenna angles: PITCH, minus 32; YAW, 52.
2544036|CDR|Okay. PITCH is minus 32, and YAW is 52. Got it.
2544110|CMP|Okay, and then what? Okay. Okay. I'll get off of the headset now then.
2544130|LMP|Okay. Panel POWER OFF, SUIT POWER OFF and AUDIO CONTROL NORMAL. Got it? CONTROL NORMAL. Okay. Panel 604, Geno, is SUIT PRESSURE ALARM OFF, verify.
2544146|CDR|OFF.
2544147|LMP|All caps from 603.
2544149|CDR|Removed.
2544150|LMP|Unsnap CMP comm carrier - cable from O2 umbilical, and we'll beep for you on it when you're - -
2544159|CC|America, Houston.
2544201|LMP|- - ready.
2544205|CDR|Okay. We're going to go ahead and close the IR and turn it off at this time.
2544209|CC|America, Houston. Would you just close the IR, and we'll cue you on the OFF call. We'd like to see it here, and we'd like to do that as a cue.
2544220|CDR|Okay. It's OFF.
2544222|LMP|Okay.
2544222|CDR|CLOSED, rather.
2544223|LMP|COVER'S CLOSED.
2544225|LMP|MARK it. And it went gray.
2544233|CC|Roger. We copy that.
2544238|LMP|Okay. Route outboard of the strut and wires and connect CCU head to 603. ...
2544329|CC|Geno, I'd like to give you just one bit of information we just got from the simulator. When you go from this new attitude I gave you, this verb 49 attitude right now to the EVA attitude, you'll see a middle gimble angle of 66 degrees. That's right off the simulator.
2544349|CDR|Okay, Bob. Thank you very much.
2544512|CDR|We're maneuvering, Bob.
2544519|LMP|Okay, you got it connected? Secure cable to TV bracket and top of strut using two straps.
2544529|LMP|Okay. You understand that? Secure cable - and that's the same one, the comm cables - to TV bracket - top of strut using two straps. You got that?
2544555|LMP|Okay. Position the TV monitor. You got that. And - disconnect PGA bag from couch at four places, Ron. It's the old remove center couch bit.
2544648|LMP|Going to have to move the old jett bag, though. Back over to your side, I guess, Ron. Yes, let's get this jett bag over on the other side. You want to unhook the PGA bags. I've got the front two. Okay. Now you can take the center couch out.
2544731|CMP|Yes.
2544801|LMP|Think you can handle this in zero G, Ron?
2544820|LMP|It certainly comes out easier, doesn't it? I mean like you're going to have to - ... that way - that's right, because this place is fuller than the mock-up ever was.
2544856|LMP|Yes, it's the old full spacecraft story. Well, look what turned up here; the clock. Maps. Well, they should be in R-5. Wait a minute. Yes. Okay.
2545010|LMP|Secured? Yes. Okay. Close and lock your old marmon clamps.
2545047|LMP|Closed and locked? Okay. Open the old - the EVA umbilical bag.
2545056|CMP|Open.
2545057|LMP|Unsnap the top strap and remove spacecraft end of EVA umb all the way to the second tiedown strap. And you're going to attach that to 603, but verify that the EVA STATION O2 is OFF. Attach the EVA umbilical to 603. Route over couch beam and under wires.
2545253|CC|Jack, whenever it's convenient, you might turn off the IR now. It's looking great.
2545302|LMP|Okay. The IR ALARM switch is going to OFF.
2545307|LMP|MARK.
2545311|CC|Thank you, sir.
2545356|LMP|Okay. You got the O2 locked?
2545358|CMP|Yes.
2545358|LMP|ELECTRICAL locked?
2545359|CMP|Yes.
2545400|LMP|Umbilical tether to couch ring and lock and install pin.
2545404|CMP|Okay.
2545405|LMP|Got that? SCU OPEN, bleed system, SCU CLOSED.
2545421|LMP|Okay. And you can close it if your system has bled down. Unstow press gauge from EVA bag and connect the gauge to 603. And tape the flashlight to panel 603 guard, Gene.
2545438|CDR|Okay.
2545439|LMP|And then we can - -
2545440|CDR|... gage?
2545440|LMP|Yes, install the gage, tape the flashlight, and then we get rid of the tape, yes. Got one?
2545511|LMP|Leave the tape on that so the light won't get out, Ron. (Laughter) Jerry Griffin told me that one.
2545540|LMP|Once you've taped it you can stow the tape. Unstow from the left-hand temporary stowage bag, top pocket: PURGE VALVE, stow in EVA bag, PURGE VALVE patch - pouch. And then the waist tethers, also. (Humming) Waist tethers are in that bag.
2545622|LMP|Houston, do you have recommendation on whether we use 208 or 211 PURGE VALVE? You - you were very interested in that on the lunar surface. Here's yours, I guess.
2545633|CC|Stand by. We're getting it.
2545635|CDR|Bob - Bob, we're using my OPS, so I assume it would be 208.
2545641|CC|That sounds good, Gene.
2545700|LMP|Okay. Here's some more tape, Geno. Stow in the EVA bag in the proper pouch, and then get the waist - both waist tethers out. And we can attach them up here to the guards.
2545746|LMP|Yes, I'll get it. And we want one over on the other side, wherever the other one is.
2545805|LMP|Okay. PURGE VALVE waist - and there's another waist tether in the EVA bag.
2545843|LMP|Yes, hook that up there. ... put that up ... Oh, that's yours. I'm sorry (laughter). I was looking for this one. All right.
2545927|LMP|Yes, that's the one. I verified that. Numbers? Okay.
2545959|CDR|Okay, Bob - -
2545959|LMP|Okay.
2550000|CDR|- - we're at the attitude, and the high gain is set. And I never did see that middle gimbal angle get to 60.
2550010|LMP|Unstow the CDRs LEVA, and leave the EVA bags in the LEVA bag - EVA gloves in the LEVA bag.
2550020|CC|Okay, Geno. It will be the next maneuver that you'll see that middle gimbal angle out around 60 - 66 degrees.
2550031|CDR|Okay.
2550200|LMP|Should have vacuumed those things (laughter). And particularly since you're going to be looking into the Sun (laughter).
2550240|CMP|Hey ...
2550242|LMP|That's right.
2550312|LMP|Okay, where? ...
2550326|LMP|Put the - put them in the tan TSB. No, not yet. That's the - Yes, unstow the LMP LEVA and EV gloves. Put the gloves in the top pocket.
2550414|LMP|Oh, they're in the left-hand top pocket. We wiped those off quite a bit. They're not half bad now. I don't have any instructions.
2550716|LMP|Okay. I think we can stick these under the couch.
2550725|LMP|Yes. Put your LEVA on the helmet. Okay, LEVA bags go up in the tunnel. Then we need to get the CDR's helmet out, too.
2550900|CDR|Houston, this is America. By my count, we're still about 30 or 40 minutes ahead here.
2550908|CC|Roger, Gene. You're looking good.
2550915|LMP|Oh, not too far. I'll have to - can't tell from the list. ... the next page? Huh? Yes. Oh ... I wouldn't know if my helmet was fogged up or not.
2550957|LMP|Supposed to have put them in the left-hand -
2551016|LMP|Got a place for that ...?
2551052|LMP|Somewhere I ceased to be careful with my helmet, I can see that because ... (Humming)
2551311|LMP|Okay. Have you got the CDR's helmet unstowed? The IV gloves?
2551355|LMP|Put your helmet stowage bag over there. Yes. Place accessory bag in the stowage bag. IV gloves in the temporary stowage bag.
2551422|LMP|Okay. You got your helmet on? Verified your visors? Verify the LEVA visors? Okay, and we antifogged. Okay. And the helmets and LEVAs are under the CDR couch. Stow loose items. Verify all your loose items, gents.
2551531|LMP|We've used it all.
2551543|LMP|Okay. Let me verify that we've got all the covers closed. One, two - Covers are closed. Panel 230, MAPPING CAMERA, OFF. SOUNDER RECORDER is OFF, IR is OFF, SELF TEST, HEATERS to - just about. You can get - you can work in that direction now. You're happy with loose items and everything?
2551625|CDR|... first?
2551626|LMP|CMP first. Yes. They've gotten it. Yes. Then me, and then you. I'm just reading you the procedures is all.
2551655|LMP|Okay, Houston. For a little while things may sound a little bit confused. We're going to do the old thing about getting into suits.
2551701|CC|Roger. We're copying that.
2551703|LMP|And if you don't hear from us - if you don't hear from us, off and on; well, that's because we're not talking to you.
2551709|CDR|And, Bob, the CDR's going off the loop right now. I'll be back in plenty of time for that maneuver.
2551715|CC|Okay.
2551724|LMP|And - let's see, continuing right here. SELF TEST is OFF, and the UV is OFF. And the DATA SYS - the ON, switch is to OFF, strange as that may sound. And - I can. Yes, I will. I'll stay on for a while, until Gene gets suited.
2551802|LMP|And the panel 5 INSTRUMENTATION SCIENCE EQUIPMENT SEB circuit breakers are coming OPEN. Two are open. Ron, you may want to watch that. Yes.
2551838|LMP|I already stowed mine in my temporary stowage bag. That's it ...
2552037|CC|America, Houston.
2552043|LMP|Yes, go ahead.
2552044|CC|Did Ron unplug from the biomed for a while?
2552049|LMP|Yes, he is off the biomed for a while.
2552052|CC|Okay. Thank you.
2552059|LMP|But you can look at me for a while.
2552105|CC|Yes, you're there.
2553009|PAO|This is Apollo Control, while the crew is suiting up, some spacecraft distance and velocity numbers. The current distance from the earth 163,130 nautical miles, velocity 3,131 feet per second. 255:30. And the crew is way ahead of the timeline in getting suited up and preparing for Ron Evans' EVA. However, it is unlikely that they will begin EVA early. That remains to be seen of course. And at 255:30 this is Apollo Control.
2553131|CMP|Okay, Houston. Gene's got his suit on now, and he'll help Jack get into his.
2553141|CC|Roger, Ron.
2553144|CMP|And in case you're won - in case you're wondering, we changed the procedure there a little bit. It was more convenient for them to get those guys suited first and then me.
2553152|CC|Okay. We'll buy that. You still are off of biomed. Do you concur on that?
2553203|CMP|Yes, if you want to take a look at it, I can plug it in here. I'm on Jack's headset now, but I can plug it in if you want me to.
2553208|CC|No, no problem - no problem. We just wanted to, you know, it's easier to remind you now than it is to have you unzip the suit or something, that's all.
2553217|CMP|Oh, okay. Yes, I understand. Let me check and see if it's still working. I'll go off first and then back on.
2553237|CMP|Okay. It's hooked up now.
2553242|CC|Roger, Ron. You look good. You're breathing.
2553248|CMP|I'm breathing, huh? Okay.
2554126|CDR|Okay, Bob, CDR's suited and back on the comm and biomed.
2554131|CC|Okay. We copy that.
2554304|LMP|Houston, how do you read the LMP?
2554307|CC|LMP, we read you loud and clear.
2554313|LMP|Okay. I'm in the suit and on suit comm now.
2554322|CC|And be advised the CDR and LMP both look good on biomed.
2554331|LMP|Okay. And we're going to get the old CMP in the suit here.
2554336|CC|Okay.
2554340|LMP|That or we'll let him do it by himself since he's so proficient at it now.
2554454|CC|America, Houston. We're copying you as being somewhat ahead on your time line, so don't rush on the - on the suit donning.
2554508|LMP|Roger. We're not rushing, just going at it systematically. We apparently learned how to do it, though, somewhere along the line.
2554517|CC|Okay. Well, just want you to be advised we don't particularly want to start early; and, therefore, you're ahead of the time line right now. You can take a break afterwards maybe.
2554528|CDR|Okay, Bob, ... on that one.
2554534|LMP|Understand, Bob. Understand.
2555401|LMP|Houston, this is the LMP. I've got something for you you've been looking forward to. It's a number. It's 24173.
2555415|CC|Roger, Jack.
2555438|CC|Jack, I wasn't sure what you were talking about there for a minute, but it lit up the face on the panel next to me there. So everybody's happy now.
2555450|LMP|Good. I'm sorry about that, Bob. Tell them that it was not intentional to leave it in the suit. As a matter of fact, it might be worth a reminder when you think we're unsuiting - suiting to take it out.
2555517|CC|Well, if you wouldn't mind a reminder, we wouldn't mind giving it to you.
2555524|LMP|Fine with me.
2555527|CC|We're writing it into the EVA Checklist right now.
2560212|LMP|Houston. We're on the top of 3-8.
2560217|CC|Roger. Understand.
2560222|LMP|With the exception of the VERB 49 maneuver, the other pages are complete.
2560228|CC|Roger. Yes, you read my mind on that one.
2560234|LMP|Say again?
2560235|CC|You read my mind. That was the next thing I was going to ask you. I hadn't seen a VERB 49, and that's on that page that isn't required at this time.
2560248|LMP|Yes, right. We're ... by for your Flight Plan time.
2560250|CDR|Bob - we'll maneuver in the Flight Plan - VERB 49.
2560257|CC|Roger. We understand.
2560301|LMP|Okay. Verify your SCU, CLOSED. You ready to go?
2560326|LMP|Panel 2, CRYO PRESS INDICATOR - INDICATOR is ... 3. Panel 603, EVA STATION O2, ON. Verify EVA STATION O2 gauge reads approximately same as surge tank. And surge tank reads 850. I guess that's approximately. (Laughter.)
2560407|LMP|Okay. SCU OPEN. Verify flow and purge umbilical. And then the panel 603, EVA STATION O2 OFF - O2 OFF.
2560436|LMP|Okay. You verified all that (laughter). Waist - remove waist belt stowage strap from umbilical and stow in EVA bag. Okay. That's done. Connect EVA umbilical electrical and O2 to CMP PGA, right-hand blue and lock. You're going to connect the EVA umbilical to yourself.
2560534|LMP|(Cough). Okay. Your electrical and O2 are connected, right-hand blue and locked.
2560608|LMP|Okay?
2560624|LMP|I transferred the LEB. I don't see that in here anymore.
2560640|LMP|There it is. Okay. Your next big step here is to connect the waist belt and lock; buckle on the left-hand side.
2560720|LMP|... down there now, Ron. Can I help you with the connections? You don't have me going down there, you know, until -
2560945|LMP|No.
2561052|CDR|Okay. Yes, that's good. But you'd like it pointed down, right? Yes, that makes sense. Now, is your belt under the scissor pocket? Okay. We got our comm carriers on, so that's no problem. You ought to put your comm carrier on now. And then we do a comm check.
2561228|CMP|Hey, Houston. This is the old Command Module Pilot back on the loop. How do you read?
2561235|CC|Read you loud and clear, Ron, and biomed's clear.
2561240|CMP|Hey, okay.
2561243|CDR|Okay. Some power at panel 10, Ron. POWER, AUDIO; SUIT POWER'S ON; MODE, VOX.
2561248|CMP|Okay, we're in VOX.
2561249|CDR|VOX sensitivity as required, approximately 7.
2561253|CMP|Well, it works good at 9. I'll try it down here. I don't know whether - Well, I'll leave it all the way up. I'll leave it on 9. It works that way.
2561304|CDR|PAD COMM, OFF.
2561305|CMP|PAD COMM is OFF.
2561306|CDR|S-BAND, T/R.
2561308|CMP|S-BAND is T/R.
2561309|CDR|AUDIO CONTROL, NORMAL.
2561311|CMP|AUDIO CONTROL'S in NORMAL.
2561312|CDR|INTERCOM, T/R.
2561314|CMP|INTERCOM, T/R.
2561315|CDR|And VHF AM, OFF.
2561318|CMP|VHF is OFF.
2561320|CDR|Okay. ...
2561323|CMP|Okay.
2561324|CDR|Panel 3, S-BAND AUX ... verify.
2561339|LMP|Okay, Houston. AUX TV is going to TV now.
2561346|CC|Roger, Jack. We see it.
2561351|CMP|(Laughter) Not much of a picture. It was looking right at the floor.
2561356|CC|We don't see the picture, but we saw the S-BAND
2561357|CMP|Not at the camera.
2561357|CC|-- ... S-BAND AUX TV.
2561401|CMP|Oh, okay.
2561447|CDR|Yes. Yes.
2561504|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. Yes, I read you loud and clear, Jack. Yes. Yes, we're going to have to move this TV a little bit, because I can't get the hatch open
2561520|LMP|Houston, I think you've heard from the CMP and the LMP. Why don't you try the CDR and see if he hears you?
2561529|CC|Roger. I thought I already had a contact with Gene. CDR, how do you read Houston?
2561535|CDR|Still reading you loud and clear, Houston.
2561538|CC|Roger, CDR.
2561551|CDR|Houston, America. That VERB 49 maneuver, you want me to be there at 56:30; you want me to maneuver at 56:30?
2561603|CC|Your choice on that, CDR. You're ahead of the timeline right now.
2561611|CDR|Yes, we're - we're going to press on slowly through the system prep - preps for depress, and just to make sure we don't run into any problems there, and we'll probably - probably call a pseudo hold before I take any checks there, we'll take a look at it.
2561630|CC|Roger.
2561638|CMP|Oh, okay. Yes, let's press on.
2561649|CDR|... panel 604, SUIT PRESSURE.
2561653|CMP|Okay. I don't hear a thing. (Laughter) I - I think I ought to hear that one.
2561711|CDR|Sure ...
2561724|CMP|I guess I can pretend like I hear it.
2561738|CMP|Make sure I'm in AUDIO/TONE back here, but I don't think it makes any difference.
2561754|CMP|No. Don't hear a thing. Houston, any suggestions on the SUIT PRESSURE ALARM, ON, and no tone?
2561826|CMP|I didn't hear a Houston. (Laughter)
2561829|CDR|Hello, Houston; America.
2561834|CMP|I hear you guys, though.
2561839|CC|America, Houston. Just for your information, we've got the TV, and we see the floor.
2561846|CMP|Okay, Robert. I just turned on the SUIT PRESSURE ALARM, and no tone. Seems like I should get a tone there. That right, Jack?
2561859|LMP|That's what it says. Verify ...
2561916|CDR|Hello, Houston; America. Did you get that last?
2561919|CC|Roger. That's affirmative. And you should have gotten the tone, and we'd like you to try it again. And we're thinking it through right now.
2561932|CMP|Nothing. (Laughter)
2561952|CMP|Well, let's see now.
2562025|CMP|Houston, you got a circuit breaker or two we could check on that one?
2562030|CC|Affirmative, and we'll be right with you with it.
2562034|CMP|Okay.
2562156|CC|Ron, you might go over on panel 5 and check the INSTRUMENT, SCI EQUIPMENT, HATCH circuit breaker. That has to be IN for the tone to work.
2562236|CC|America, Houston.
2562242|CMP|Okay, Houston. It's - the HATCH circuit breaker is IN, and - Couldn't be my headset at all, could it?
2562258|CC|I wouldn't think so. Not your headset per se, since you're reading us and all.
2562305|CMP|Yes, that's what I'm thinking, too.
2562308|CDR|Say - say, Bob?
2562310|CMP|Yes.
2562311|CDR|How would it be if I just plugged into the comm cable on that umbilical, just to check out the entire suit headset system here on that tone?
2562322|CMP|You just cut out, in one ear.
2562337|CDR|Okay. This is the CDR. I'm going off the line for a minute.
2562351|CC|Ron, you might verify that the NONESSENTIAL BUS switch on panel 5 is on MAIN A.
2562359|CMP|It's in intermittent in my headset. Okay.
2562406|LMP|That's verified. And Ron thinks he has an intermittent in his headset for some reason.
2562416|CC|Ron, your transmissions are okay, and you're not breaking up to us. It may be in your headset.
2562508|LMP|Okay, Houston. Gene's able to hear the tone, and Ron's getting it intermittently.
2562517|CC|Roger. We copy.
2562522|CMP|How about switching headsets with one of you guys, huh?
2562529|CC|If you decide to swap headsets, we prefer that you swap with the CDR.
2562539|CDR|Any special reason?
2562542|CMP|Yes.
2562546|CDR|... I think.
2562555|CMP|Oh, this?
2562555|CDR|Yes.
2562556|CMP|Oh, I see. I'll trade with Jack, here.
2562607|CDR|Bob, this is CDR. You got any answer to that last question?
2562611|CC|Roger, CDR. It's almost a tossup, but we would like to have the other man out on - with an absolutely good headset, although we don't think it's a real problem one way or another.
2562627|CDR|We'll get him out with a good headset, okay?
2562633|CC|It's a tossup, CDR. Take your pick, I guess, really.
2562639|CDR|Okay. Standby. We'll check one out here.
2562715|CDR|Okay. We just made a swap. Okay. Ron is wearing Jack's headset, and he's got a good tone continually when the switch is on, and he loses the tone when the switch goes off.
2562732|CC|Okay. We've got that.
2562734|CDR|So CMP and LMP made the switch.
2562737|CC|Roger.
2562812|CMP|You know, that - No - yes, I didn't - I didn't even know you could cut it off. If I'd known that, I'd have cut it off before. Yes. If I'd cut it off like that, I'd have my curly locks shaved off in front.
2562827|LMP|Okay, Houston; this is the LMP. Give me a call, please.
2562830|CC|LMP, Houston. Reading you loud and clear. How me?
2562836|LMP|Okay. You're loud and clear.
2562839|CC|Roger, Jack.
2562844|CMP|We're going to try the spacecraft - see if Jack hears the spacecraft tone or not. Just turn the power on and off - the caution and warning power. I got a tone.
2562922|CMP|Hey, that's good and loud. Okay. ALARM is OFF.
2562928|LMP|Okay, Houston. We're going to turn the TV off for a while.
2562933|CC|Roger.
2562946|LMP|Okay. I'm going to start my maneuver now.
2562957|CMP|(Humming)
2563041|CMP|Oh, 351. The CABIN REPRESS valve. Okay, I'll get it.
2563053|CMP|Okay. CABIN REPRESS valve is OFF on 351. And it's verified closed.
2563223|CMP|Yes, that's right. ... checklist.
2563317|CDR|Okay, O2 HEATERS, three of them, are in AUTO.
2563332|CMP|Yes, that's a good number.
2563343|CMP|Okay. Got it? Yes, it's ON.
2563355|CMP|Okay. You ON or - -
2563400|CC|America, Houston. We'd like OMNI Delta, OMNI Delta.
2563406|CDR|You got it.
2563412|CMP|Yes, got it in there. Okay. PCV is verified on. Okay. Yes.
2563439|CMP|If we decide to put this on later, then you can put it on for me, because it flops all over the place down here. Okay. Disconnect red ECS O2 hose. Okay.
2563458|CMP|Close the old purge valve, valve 208. It came from the Taurus-Littrow landing area of the Moon. Okay. Got the purge valve. Boy. Okay, just looking at some ... (Laughter) Okay. It's low, is it?
2563608|CC|America, Houston. We'd like OMNI Charlie.
2563612|CMP|Yes, you can't see it.
2563614|LMP|You're OMNI Charlie, now.
2563617|CC|Thank you, Jack.
2563622|CMP|It's low.
2563628|CMP|What's the matter with - I'm going to try the other one. That thing, I can't even move.
2563639|CMP|Oh! Sticks or something. Let's see. Okay. Let me try the other one.
2563716|CMP|Yes, this one's stuck here, stuck in something. Couldn't move that if I had to. Okay, we'll use 211 instead.
2563726|CDR|Okay, Houston. He's going to wear purge valve 211. It's not perfectly matched, but I see no problems with it. It's a lot freer.
2563737|CC|Roger, America. And we anticipate no problems with using 211.
2563743|CDR|Okay. Fine, Bob.
2563745|CMP|Okay. We want it in low, you say, Jack - Okay?
2563803|CMP|... that's low. Okay.
2563815|CMP|Okay. 302, SUIT FLOW is OFF.
2563830|CMP|Might just as well. I - I turned mine off, see.
2563846|CMP|Okay. ...
2563908|CMP|Stay up there in the tunnel, that way.
2563913|CMP|Yes. This other way - you are in the way there. Let's go the other way.
2563924|CMP|See, like so.
2563935|CMP|Okay. CMPs hoses are routed up across the tunnel, out of the way - we hope. Ah-ha! Finally getting some flow. Man, I feel a lot better. Okay, cabin pressure's coming up, and - Okay. Jack, I guess you could really go the LEB ... to help me now. Yes - yes, because I can -
2564049|CMP|Okay. I've got - yes, I've got the flow coming in here, so ... up around 5.7.
2564111|CMP|Okay, just a second.
2564129|CMP|Yes, I - I just - Okay, I see. Yes, it's below 2.5.
2564135|CMP|Okay.
2564152|CMP|Man, you guys got that thing dirty.
2564158|CMP|Here, let me get the hose out of here first.
2564203|CMP|Oop!
2564216|CMP|(Laughter) Well, put it on there, I guess. Yes. Close up a hole there next to the ... Okay, let's see, I guess we can button that back up.
2564256|CDR|Okay, Houston. We're at attitude. I'm going to configure the DAP.
2564301|CC|Roger, America. We copy attitude.
2564325|CMP|Let's see. Am I getting all tangled up in the hose I don't think so. Am I?
2564330|CC|Okay, America. We're ready for the HIGH GAIN. PITCH, 43; YAW of 262.
2564339|CMP|Okay. Just a minute. MANUAL and WIDE. PITCH of 43; YAW, 262. HIGH GAIN. Okay. They want AUTO now?
2564358|CC|That's affirmative, Ron.
2564408|CMP|It still doesn't go full scale, but -
2564419|CMP|That good enough?
2564423|CC|Ron, we need it full scale.
2564430|CMP|Let me try it again. Okay? I'll go to MANUAL and WIDE.
2564432|CC|RE - REACQ and WIDE, and then step it down.
2564438|CMP|Okay.
2564447|CMP|Ah-ha! That works. Okay. You're REACQ and NARROW now.
2564528|CMP|Okay. There, you want to - -
2564530|CC|America, we see your cabin at 5.4, and We'll keep an eye on it.
2564537|CMP|Okay. Give us a little call there ahead of time, and I'll crack the ... Right now - -
2564542|CC|Roger.
2564546|CDR|Okay, Jack. You're squared away.
2564549|CDR|Okay, Bob. I've got the proper jets configured, and A/C ROLL, PITCH, and YAW, MAIN B, are OPEN.
2564554|CMP|What?
2564556|CC|Roger. And we would like to go back to AUTO on the HIGH GAIN to see if it holds your signal strength for us.
2564606|CMP|Okay. You got AUTO.
2564625|LMP|Okay, Bob. I'll verify that all the SCS switches are set as per 3-9.
2564634|CC|Roger, America. Thank you.
2564711|CC|And, America. Your cabin press is at 5.6, and you can crack the side hatch valve, if you like.
2564816|CMP|Okay. Get the old cabin pressure down here a little ways. That's about 5, isn't it?
2564827|CMP|Okay. ... there.
2564833|CC|Ron, we're seeing 4.9 on your pressure. You can stop venting there.
2564838|CMP|Okay, we're stopped.
2564839|CDR|Okay, it's closed.
2564859|CMP|Okay.
2564918|CMP|Here, Jack. Why don't you stick that up there in that? Yes.
2564939|CMP|Up left.
2564951|CMP|Okay. Yes, that's right side up. Not, yet, I haven't got them all on there.
2565017|CC|America, Houston.
2565022|CDR|Go ahead, Houston; this is America.
2565023|CC|Gene, you probably realize that the audio tone is a separate wire all the way to the earplug, and that's - and that's why there's no problem - the LMP should have no problem.
2565038|CDR|That's affirm. We understand.
2565039|CMP|Yes, we understood that. Okay, Gene. The bottom ones look like letters up, right? Yes, okay. That works, okay. Now - we have - Oh, there's the other one. (Laughter) Thought I only had three straps. Okay.
2565106|CMP|Okay. I guess we're ready to strap this thing on, huh? No, I've got to have that first.
2565122|CMP|Okay. There's the old - 0 - OPS adapter bracket. It's hooked on. Yes, it floats around there a lot better than it did in the simulator. Okay, Jack. Can you kind of steady it there, and we'll - Some more? Wait a minute. Give me the lower one first. No, up on top, the other way. And then slip - Okay. And an upper one. Okay, need a left upper. There's a left upper.
2565215|CMP|Okay, the next one's coming around this way.
2565228|CMP|And then, the left arm's back over here. Ah-ha! There's the old OPS hose. Okay, that's installed and it's locked.
2565247|CMP|Verify locked. Okay.
2565253|CDR|Okay, what do you need, Jack? Okay.
2565323|CMP|Uh-oh. (Laughter) Should have done that earlier. It's under your bench now. Here it is. Okay. Oh, okay. (Humming)
2565436|LMP|Okay, Houston; America. The LMP is donning his LEVA now.
2565442|CC|Roger, America.
2565508|CMP|Yes, it was - that - The back is the part I can't reach right now. Yes, okay.
2565515|CC|America, the cabin is at 5.6, if you want to vent a little bit.
2565521|LMP|Okay, I'll get it.
2565524|CMP|Okay, locked. I'll get the back of it. Can you lock - verify your own alignment?
2565535|CMP|Yes, I can see it.
2565538|CMP|Which one is locked? Let me twist it just a little bit.
2565541|CDR|Okay, there we go.
2565543|CMP|Engage - locked. Okay, it's on that way. Yes. Yes. No, I ... - You're going to have to twist or something. Okay, that's the back.
2565643|CMP|One is in there, and then the other one was stuck in that bungee there.
2565709|CDR|There's one, up in the tunnel.
2565728|CDR|Houston, how does the cabin look to you?
2565732|CMP|Take a look. It's about 5-1/2 now, Gene.
2565736|CDR|Okay.
2565737|CC|Roger, Gene. It's at 5.3. We're monitoring very closely if you - if it helps you any.
2565745|CDR|Okay, very fine. I'm coming down very, very slowly on it.
2565749|CC|Roger.
2565749|CMP|Gene, can you look on your left side, over there? That's it. Now, just a second, Gene; hold it there.
2565849|CMP|Pull valve.
2565851|CDR|Okay, it moving.
2565856|CMP|Okay, let's see. You're right. Okay. It's off. Just tell me when. You want it on yet?
2565930|CMP|Okay, that's that one? Lock. There's your lock on that blue one. Locked? Okay. You closed? Okay, that's locked. That's locked. Locked. Okay. Having trouble getting them on there, Jack, with the - shouldn't be too much pressure there. Let me - let me push it on you.
2570016|CMP|Twist? Doesn't look like it's on. Okay. Is she locked? Let me see. Okay, let's see your - they're hooked on the right.
2570040|CMP|Okay. That's O2 - that's a lock lock. Okay, blue one is a lock lock. Okay, that pin is now locked in. That ... is locked in. Okay, and your helmet, I checked that once. Let's try it again; let's see Moves that way, doesn't it? Okay, it's locked. Here, let me - wrong way (laughter). Okay.
2570118|CDR|Okay, Houston; this is America. The LMP and the CDR both got their helmets and gloves on, and all connections have been checked.
2570126|CC|Roger, America.
2570142|CMP|It's open.
2570142|CDR|Okay.
2570144|CMP|It's locked.
2570144|CC|America, we are copying the cabin at 4.8. You can stop the venting at this time.
2570153|CMP|Okay, it's - Gene's closing the valve now.
2570156|CDR|Okay, it's closed. And how are you reading CDR on VOX?
2570202|CC|Read you loud and clear on VOX.
2570206|CDR|Okay, fine.
2570208|CMP|Okay, now she's low.
2570209|CDR|Okay.
2570213|CMP|(Laughter) Yes. Got to get the dust cover on the ..., okay?
2570223|CDR|Okay, we're going to do an integrity check, Jack.
2570226|CDR|And, Houston, the CMPs connections are all verified locked.
2570231|CC|Roger.
2570232|CDR|Okay, going to integrity check.
2570236|CMP|Let me know when you get up there because I've got to turn my O2 off. Well, I guess I can see it from here.
2570246|CDR|Okay. SUIT CIRCUIT RETURN VALVE is CLOSED.
2570256|CDR|Okay, it's CLOSED. DIRECT O2 is CLOSED. What's suit pressure indicating over there, Ron, about 4.7 to 5.3?
2570309|CMP|Yes, it's about 5.0.
2570311|CDR|And O2 FLOW is low, isn't it? Okay.
2570313|CMP|FLOW is down, yes.
2570318|CDR|I'll just take it off of here, huh?
2570321|CMP|Yes, just right off there.
2570322|CDR|Okay, SUIT CIRCUIT RETURN VALVE is CLOSED. SUIT FLOW valve - You have flow, Jack? Suit pressure is okay, and O2 flow is less than 0.4. Suit test. Okay; I'm taking us up.
2570334|CMP|Okay.
2570343|CDR|Okay. We're in PRESSURE, and DIRECT O2 is OPENED.
2570353|CDR|Let me cycle the suit circuit return valve. Okay, it's OPEN, and it's CLOSED.
2570404|CMP|Okay. That's O2 flow.
2570408|CDR|Okay. At 4 psi differential, I'll close the direct O2.
2570416|CMP|Okay, I'll turn my flow off here a little bit to keep the cabin from going up so far.
2570420|LMP|Okay.
2570422|CMP|If it starts to get hot, I'll turn it back on again.
2570424|LMP|Okay.
2570426|CDR|Okay. DIRECT O2 is CLOSED.
2570430|CMP|Should take you up to about 4.5, I think.
2570433|CDR|Okay, check suit pressure. What are you reading over there, Ron? Ron, what are you reading up on the - the suit - circuit?
2570443|CMP|Oh, I don't know. About - I don't know, 8.5 or 9.
2570447|CDR|Okay. That's GO.
2570450|CC|Okay. We're reading 9.0 on the suit pressure.
2570450|CDR|Okay. ... at 4.25, increasing slowly.
2570455|CDR|Okay, very good. O2 flow, Ron?
2570458|CMP|Well, it's still off. Let's give it a chance to - -
2570459|CDR|Less than 0.8? Let's wait for it here.
2570501|CMP|Yes. See, you've got to go up - you're sitting - -
2570503|CDR|Yes. We're going through about 4.35, now.
2570505|CMP|Yes. Goes up to about 4.4 or 4.5.
2570524|CDR|Let me know when it comes down up there, will you?
2570525|CMP|Okay. It's starting to come down now.
2570542|CDR|Let me know when it gets stable.
2570543|CMP|Okay. It's 0.6 right now, but -
2570546|CDR|Still coming down?
2570547|CMP|Still coming down a little bit.
2570548|CDR|Okay.
2570553|CMP|0.55.
2570558|CMP|It's 0.5.
2570609|CMP|Well, it looks like it's going to stabilize right there at just a little less than 0.5.
2570614|CDR|Okay. Let's see if it stays stable for about 30 seconds.
2570616|CMP|Okay.
2570617|CDR|Yes? Not to me - oh - to you. Okay. Okay.
2570637|CDR|Still stable, Ron?
2570638|CMP|It's coming down. You guys got pretty good suits.
2570641|CDR|Yes. They are good, as a matter of fact.
2570644|CMP|(Laughter) Put dust in them, and it makes them good. Now it's down around 0.3.
2570652|CDR|Houston, how does the suit circuit look to you?
2570657|CC|It's looking real good, Gene.
2570701|CDR|If you're happy, I'll go to DEPRESS.
2570705|CC|Roger. We're happy with it.
2570709|CDR|Okay. Coming down slow, Jack.
2570721|CDR|Okay. We're coming down.
2570725|CMP|Is that okay? Or that okay? Okay. But you can't do that. It's going to have to be (laughter) - and -
2570744|CDR|Okay. Let's see.
2570745|CMP|Okay. You guys are coming down; I want to give myself a little air here.
2570753|CMP|Wish I had some of that cold you were talking about this morning, Gene.
2570757|CDR|Yes. It's plenty cool in here.
2570818|CDR|Okay. We'll pick it up over here.
2570828|CDR|Okay, Bob, I'll pick it up on page 3-13 as soon as we come down here a little bit more. I'm in SUIT TEST valve DEPRESS.
2570840|CC|Roger.
2570908|CMP|What's my next thing here? Suit and helmet donning, isn't it?
2570911|CDR|Yes. We'll get your helmet and gloves on, Ron.
2570914|CMP|Okay. I can go ahead and start doing that now.
2570915|CDR|Yes, you sure can.
2570920|CMP|Okay. I don't know if Jack will be able to get my helmet. I'm going to need my gloves. Well, no hurry yet. I need to get the helmet on first.
2570931|CC|America, Houston. You asked for a reminder - -
2570932|CDR|Go ahead.
2570932|CC|- - you might want to get the waste management compartment vent prior to glove donning. That is your decision - your choice on that.
2570942|CMP|Oh, okay.
2571000|CDR|Ron, can you see our suit-circuit pressure up there?
2571004|CMP|Yes. It's about 7.
2571006|CDR|Okay.
2571007|CMP|Cabin's about 5 -
2571009|CDR|Okay. We're 6 or so?
2571018|CMP|Oh. My clean gloves all dirty?
2571038|CMP|Look at all the water's coming out of that thing.
2571039|CDR|Okay, Jack. You want to take us down the rest of the way?
2571047|CDR|Okay, Houston, the SUIT PRESS valve - SUIT TEST valve is OFF, and I can verify we are in BOTH on DEMAND REGs.
2571057|CMP|I don't know which is the best way to do this here.
2571059|CC|Roger, America.
2571112|CDR|Yes, that's that valve you just opened.
2571114|CMP|Yes. I just opened the waste stowage vent valve here.
2571118|CDR|Okay, Ron. You've got the O2 ON yet, I guess. Huh?
2571122|CMP|Yes. It's still ON.
2571123|CDR|Okay.
2571124|CMP|Well, let's see - -
2571125|CDR|I'll let Jack help you with that.
2571126|CMP|- - ... OPS is in the way in the back here. See if I can squish down here.
2571138|CDR|Okay. I'll hold your OPS out of the way.
2571140|CMP|Okay, wait a minute. I can't see where the - -
2571141|CDR|Okay, you're in the back.
2571146|CMP|Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I think something's stuck in the - oh, I don't have a hose. Okay. (Laughter)
2571156|CMP|There's a cable here. The cable to the comm carrier.
2571201|CC|America, you're at 5.7 - -
2571202|CMP|Okay. Comm carrier coming up.
2571202|CC|- - on your cabin. You want to go ahead and vent a little bit?
2571206|CDR|Okay. That's good. Half a second here.
2571208|CMP|Okay?
2571210|CDR|Well, you're - There you go.
2571211|CMP|Wait a minute. Something's still in there. What in the world's in there? Everytime I look down, your comm carrier comes in -
2571217|CDR|You're just not getting it aligned too well.
2571222|CMP|Let's see if on the sides over there or something.
2571225|CDR|No. You're clear.
2571227|CMP|No, this buckle. I hadn't thought of it. That's the buckle on the OPS. Man. That's something that happened - doesn't happen in there - Wait a minute. That's the engagement right there. Okay. Yes. Yes. I think that's it, isn't it?
2571250|CDR|Did it lock? Doublecheck it locked, and doublecheck it in the engage mark.
2571254|CMP|Okay, that's the lock mark, isn't it? Yes. Okay. Yes. So if I can - Think you know how to get it, huh?
2571316|CDR|I got to pull the flap up on this side, Jack. You'll have to get it on the other.
2571325|CMP|Yes, something's not right the way I - There. Okay, that did it.
2571347|CDR|Okay, Ron. You got - why don't you do a couple of other things before you go any further now.
2571350|CMP|Okay.
2571351|CDR|Okay, give me another - pull the pin on the purge valve and give it to me. And activate it in LOW.
2571401|CDR|Okay, going activated?
2571404|CMP|Okay. It's activated into LOW.
2571407|CDR|Okay. DIVERTER valves - verify they're vertical.
2571409|CMP|Okay. Wait a minute. That one is vertical. Okay, that one is vertical - -
2571419|CDR|Okay. Next step is not applicable - -
2571422|CMP|Wait a minute. Hold it.
2571425|CDR|Now, you can adjust your PGA tiedown. And set your wrist rings to the ENGAGE position.
2571455|CMP|Okay, that one's engaged. That one's engaged. How's the noise down there, Houston?
2571503|CC|Not too bad, Ron.
2571506|CC|And the cabin is at 4.85. Terminate your vent.
2571512|CDR|Thank you, Bob.
2571521|CDR|And Houston, this is CDR. I'm on the cue card now.
2571536|CDR|Jack, could you get his - his flap on the other side?
2571540|LMP|Yes, I got - Okay.
2571546|CDR|Sorry, I didn't leave you -
2571549|CMP|Oh, let's see.
2571553|CDR|I got it on this side.
2571557|CMP|Okay.
2571601|CDR|Well, it'll do that, too, that's - let's push it down behind his OPS here and that'll - that's about the best you can do on that.
2571608|CMP|That cover on that - -
2571609|CDR|Yes. If it's too loose, we can pull the snap and tighten her up.
2571616|CDR|That' s all right. Looks good. ... Okay, Ron, you can -
2571630|CMP|What?
2571632|CDR|A rock. Houston, we just found a small sample of the Moon floating around in the cabin.
2571642|CMP|Hold it there, will you? We can't go on to it now.
2571646|CC|Roger.
2571646|CMP|Go ahead ... systems.
2571651|CDR|Let me look at that before you cover it.
2571654|CMP|Okay. Okay, that's locked.
2571700|CDR|That's locked.
2571702|CMP|Okay. Let's - -
2571702|CDR|Your right glove is locked.
2571704|CMP|Okay. I'm going to let you help me with the -
2571708|CDR|Let go - put your other hand - -
2571708|CMP|Oh, okay. Put the strap on and - -
2571711|CDR|- - the ring out.
2571712|CMP|Put it all - up here, yes. On the other side of the valve.
2571716|CDR|Okay.
2571731|CDR|Take the top and pull it down.
2571743|CDR|Tight son of a gun.
2571747|CMP|That's over. Okay. I don't want that.
2571750|CDR|You just ... keep pulling there.
2571753|CMP|Yes, but it won't go over that - it won't go over that other valve, Gene. There's no -
2571756|CDR|Stick it under the gauntlet.
2571810|CDR|There you go.
2571810|CMP|There we go.
2571811|CDR|It's over the valve.
2571812|CMP|Over the valve, okay?
2571814|CDR|Okay, your right glove is lock lock. Let's get your left one on.
2571825|CMP|Okay, she's engaged.
2571826|CDR|Okay.
2571828|CMP|Wait a minute. I've got to turn the pressure off, babe.
2571831|CDR|Okay.
2571843|CMP|(Laughter)
2571850|CDR|Okay, on 603, EVA O2, OFF.
2571854|CMP|Okay. Wait a minute. I can't even reach it.
2571858|CMP|Okay, EVA O2 is OFF.
2571901|CDR|Okay. Okay, get your other glove. Turn it some more. Turn it the other way. Okay now.
2571921|CMP|She's locked? Let's push her on up. Okay?
2571926|CDR|Okay, you are locked.
2571928|CMP|Wait a minute, I'll get it. ... get some air.
2571930|CMP|(Laughter)
2571930|CDR|Okay.
2571933|CMP|Okay, fully -
2571936|CDR|On as required to pressurize.
2571941|CMP|Okay, we're coming up.
2571942|CDR|Now, let's get that gauntlet.
2571944|CMP|Okay.
2571949|CDR|Okay, Houston, the CMP is coming up.
2572005|CMP|Okay, looks like about 3.4 - 3.5.
2572012|CDR|You pressurized already?
2572014|CMP|There we go.
2572017|CDR|Okay, if you can reach the tone, turn the tone on.
2572020|CMP|Okay.
2572022|CDR|And verify and turn it off.
2572026|CMP|Aaaaah, don't know how I can reach the tone.
2572047|CDR|Want me to help you? Wait a minute, see ... - -
2572050|CMP|(Laughter) No wonder I can't move. Okay, wait a minute. Hook it in my thing.
2572055|CDR|Okay. You want it locked in there?
2572100|CMP|No, that's all right.
2572100|CDR|Okay. You got to get that. Yes, that's -
2572116|CMP|Hmmm, I don't have a tone.
2572120|CDR|Did you turn it on?
2572121|CMP|Now it's off. Stupid thing.
2572127|CDR|You got it? You said you did not have a tone, is that correct?
2572140|CMP|Yes, that's right.
2572143|CDR|Houston, do you hear that?
2572146|CC|Understand. The CMP does not have the tone, again?
2572153|CMP|Oh, son of a buck.
2572155|CDR|Pretty good ...
2572157|CMP|Okay, I'm reading 3.9, should have low suit flow because I got the purge valve.
2572211|CDR|Okay. You got your EVA - on 603, EVA O2 is ON.
2572217|CDR|Is it - is it still on, or have you got it off?
2572223|CMP|602 O2? Yes, it's ON; O2 flow is ON.
2572226|CDR|Okay, and you're reading 3.7 to 4.0.
2572230|CMP|Yes. Maybe it's just not - maybe I'm still getting too much flow. That purge valve is open, isn't it, in LOW?
2572236|CDR|PURGE valve is open to LOW. Did you open it? Let me see.
2572241|CMP|I think I did. Yes, it was open.
2572246|CDR|Yes. You're open.
2572301|CDR|Okay, turn the tone off.
2572304|CMP|Okay, I turned the tone off. Okay, it's off.
2572308|CDR|Okay, how's your master volume? You happy with it? Or should I jack it up some more?
2572312|CMP|Houston, say something.
2572314|CC|Roger, Ron. We copy you. You might try and adjust your VOX, thumbwheel down a little bit. It might help us a bit, knock out some of the background noise.
2572326|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. Jack, you want to try to knock the VOX down a little bit? Okay, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
2572341|CC|Hey, you don't sound bad at all, Ron.
2572342|CMP|Houston, are you reading me?
2572344|CC|We're reading you loud and clear, Ron. No problem.
2572346|CMP|Does that - Okay. Did that knock some of the noise down?
2572353|CC|That's affirmative.
2572354|CMP|Is that - is that okay? Okay. You're going to get a little bit of noise, I think.
2572400|CC|Oh, that's affirmative. We realize that.
2572402|CDR|Okay, Houston - -
2572404|CMP|Okay.
2572405|CDR|Okay, Houston. Unless we hear otherwise, without the tone at that point, we are pressing on.
2572417|CDR|Okay, Jack. On 351, get the EMERGENCY CABIN PRESSURE REGs OFF.
2572422|CC|America, that's affirmative. And we'd like to vent the cabin. You're at 5.7 again.
2572428|CDR|Okay.
2572441|CDR|Okay. It seemed like you - it's on 351.
2572455|CDR|Okay, Houston, I'm 351, EMERGENCY CABIN PRESSURE'S OFF.
2572501|CC|Roger.
2572511|CDR|Okay, Ron. It says - let me read this to you. "CMP monitor cuff gage" - it's "PURGE VALVE, HIGH, verify tone on at 3.1 to 3.4, then PURGE VALVE, CLOSED and verify tone off." Go ahead and turn the switch on.
2572524|CMP|Okay.
2572525|CDR|You probably didn't get a tone there because you were already on up to pressure by the time you got that switch on. I think that's why you didn't get a tone.
2572532|CMP|Yes.
2572533|CDR|So you should get one here. So turn the tone - you got the tone power on?
2572536|CMP|No, not yet. I can't get down there. Not until I get Jack out of the way.
2572539|CDR|Okay.
2572542|CMP|Okay.
2572546|CDR|Okay, get down there and turn the tone power on, and I think you'll get a tone this time around.
2572602|CMP|Okay. There.
2572604|CDR|Okay, tone power's on. What I want you to do is go PUR - go HIGH on the PURGE VALVE, and I'll get that ... - -
2572608|CMP|I'm going to let you - I'm going to let you do that, okay?
2572610|CDR|Okay. Now, it's HIGH - -
2572612|CMP|Okay, coming on.
2572612|CDR|- - 3.1 to 3.4. You ought to get a tone.
2572616|CMP|Now, I got the tone at 3.2.
2572618|CDR|Okay, turn it back on.
2572620|CMP|Wait a minute.
2572620|CDR|PURGE VALVE is CLOSED.
2572621|CMP|Okay. Back up to 4.
2572624|CDR|Tone off?
2572625|CMP|Tone's off.
2572626|CDR|Okay, PURGE VALVE is locked, and it's HIGH.
2572630|CMP|Locked and HIGH, okay.
2572631|CDR|Okay. That's where you want it, huh?
2572632|CMP|Right.
2572633|CDR|Why don't you come up here, and I'll install a pin for you.
2572636|CMP|Yes, I'll come up there. (Laughter) I'm stuck. Oh, I can - I can get it. Can you do it?
2572642|CDR|Yes, I can get it. Okay. Okay.
2572647|CMP|Okay?
2572649|CDR|Now, it's locked, the pin is in, and you are in HIGH. Okay, that's verified.
2572658|CMP|Okay?
2572700|CDR|Okay. Verify flow and cuff gage reads 3.7 to 4.0. Ron?
2572710|CMP|Okay. I got 3.9 on the cuff gage.
2572714|CDR|Okay, we're going to do an integrity check on you. On 603, EVA and STATION O2, OFF.
2572720|CMP|Okay. Can you reach that gauge, or do you want me to do it? Oh, I can get it.
2572727|CDR|I can get it if I turn around here. I'll get it.
2572729|CMP|If I can - -
2572730|CDR|Let me undo this before I pressurize. I'll strap them in again.
2572733|CMP|How you guys - always got it before, but I must be laying in a different way here.
2572749|CDR|Did I get it off?
2572750|CMP|Okay, I've got the tone.
2572754|CDR|Okay, now. Okay, monitor cuff gage; verify PCV closes. Monitor pressure decay for 1 minute; verify less than 0.8.
2572803|CMP|Okay, closed, and we're at 3.61.
2572807|CDR|Okay, when did you start your time?
2572815|CMP|Okay.
2572821|CMP|Can you guys hear that tone?
2572823|CDR|Yes, I can hear it occasionally.
2572824|CC|That's affirmative.
2572827|CMP|Oh, you can hear it on the ground, huh?
2572829|CC|That's affirmative.
2572830|CMP|Very good.
2572831|CDR|Okay, Ron. How is - how is your suit pressure?
2572833|CMP|... pressure is stuck at 3.6.
2572836|CDR|That's a good place for it to be. You have about 30 more seconds, don't you?
2572841|CMP|About 15 more.
2572842|CDR|Okay. Okay, and you did get the tone on for low flow?
2572858|CMP|Yes.
2572859|CDR|Let me know when you're satisfied with the time.
2572901|CMP|Okay, turn it back on.
2572902|CDR|Okay. O2 ... is ON.
2572906|CMP|Okay.
2572909|CDR|It's in.
2572911|CMP|Let me get it. Make sure it's all the way up. ... it all the way up?
2572916|CDR|Yes, I think it is.
2572918|CMP|Yes, I can see it increasing.
2572919|CDR|Here, let me get in there and push it. Put your guard down.
2572922|CMP|See it in there?
2572925|CDR|Okay.
2572933|CMP|Okay?
2572940|CDR|Okay, you happy?
2572941|CMP|Yes, 3.7 to 4.0. Stable?
2572944|CDR|Stable, 3.9.
2572945|CDR|No tone?
2572946|CMP|No tone.
2572946|CDR|EVA pressure gage, 100 to 500 psi.
2572949|CMP|Yes. For some reason, the battery is burned out in the flashlight, but - Let me see, it's about - I would say 400, I think. Yes, let's see, its division marks on that gauge are 3, 6, and 900. And it's above the 3.
2573013|CDR|Okay, it's good. I can see that.
2573014|CMP|Yes, it's good. It's about 350.
2573016|CDR|Okay, verify surge tank pressure. Houston, can you give us a hack on the surge tank as a GO?
2573023|CC|Stand by on that.
2573028|CC|Roger. Looking good.
2573031|CDR|Okay, very good. We're ready to press on with the cabin depress, Ron. GN2 valve handle, pulled.
2573043|CMP|Okay.
2573052|CDR|Okay. We'll pick that up when he starts to move. Okay, gauge MIN and leave in the vent position. Pull the handle.
2573059|CMP|Okay.
2573059|CDR|Leave in vent. Leave in vent.
2573101|CMP|Okay.
2573102|CDR|Okay. Verify helmet and gloves locked.
2573105|CMP|Okay. ... smooth. Here, I need the - get that down.
2573112|CDR|Okay.
2573112|CMP|... there. Okay, lock locked.
2573118|CDR|Hey, babe; you looked good when you went by me.
2573120|CMP|(Laughter) Okay.
2573122|CDR|Just stay that way.
2573123|CMP|We'll stay that way.
2573125|CDR|Okay. Houston, we're standing by for your GO.
2573130|CC|You are GO.
2573133|CDR|Okay, Ron. Hear the note.
2573136|CMP|Okay.
2573136|CDR|EVA warning tone may come on momentarily during the ... depress.
2573140|CMP|Okay.
2573141|CDR|Jack, are you ready?
2573143|CDR|Okay, babe. When you get out there, just take it nice and slow and easy. You got all day long.
2573149|CMP|Yes, that's right. It's not like the zero-g airplane.
2573151|CDR|Feel yourself around, and it's nice and easy to get around. Just don't let your body start moving too fast down there. Okay. Side hatch is coming open slowly.
2573202|CMP|There's a valve ...
2573204|CDR|Valve? I can't see the gauge, but I know we're coming down.
2573217|CMP|Okay.
2573218|CDR|Houston, can you give me a hack at approaching 3.25?
2573223|CC|That's affirmative. We will.
2573227|CDR|Okay.
2573253|CDR|Okay. That's O2 FLOW HIGH, as expected.
2573256|CMP|Okay. And that's - oh, about 3.95.
2573300|CDR|Okay. ...
2573316|CDR|Coming down a little faster, Houston.
2573322|CC|Roger. We're watching.
2573325|CDR|Okay.
2573348|CDR|And, Ron - -
2573348|CC|Okay. You're 3.4 right now - 3.4, Gene.
2573349|CDR|- - when you get to the SIM bay, go around -
2573353|CDR|Okay. Okay - -
2573356|CC|3.3, closing.
2573356|CDR|- - ... get your feet in the -
2573358|CMP|Oh, okay. Yes, will do.
2573359|CDR|Get your feet in the golden shoes, and then you can do anything. But get them there first. Okay, 3.25. O2 FLOW indicator is off scale low. Okay, can you verify our suit pressure down there?
2573418|CC|Roger. We're - you're locked up. Suit press, 3.8.
2573423|CDR|Okay, very good. We're coming on the way open. Going to zero. You guys ready? Here we go.
2573430|CMP|Okay. I don't change. I'm already there. (Laughter)
2573434|CDR|Yes, but Jack and I are coming up.
2573436|CMP|Yes, I know.
2573447|CDR|Okay, we're coming up.
2573517|CDR|Okay.
2573519|LMP|Nice day for an EVA, Ron. Go out and have a good time.
2573523|CMP|Yes, it ought to be pretty good out there. I ... - -
2573525|CDR|Okay, we're coming off the ...
2573526|CMP|I just need that one visor down, don't I?
2573529|CDR|No, you need your Sun visor down, too. Bring it - one is protective, and the other is the Sun.
2573533|CMP|It is? Well, it looks dark out there. Can't even see.
2573536|CDR|Well, use your own judgment. If - if you're in the shade, you won't need it. But if you're in the Sun, you ought to have it down.
2573541|CMP|Okay.
2573546|CDR|Okay, Jack. I'm at 2.8 and coming up.
2573551|LMP|Okay.
2573621|CDR|Well, let's open her up a little more.
2573632|CDR|Okay, the valve's all the way open. And I'm 3.5.
2573639|LMP|Okay, I'm still reading about 3.82, now.
2573647|CDR|O2 FLOW HIGH light is off. Okay. Wait until we're stable, Ron, and we'll be with you.
2573659|CMP|Okay.
2573702|CDR|Jack, it looks like I'm picking out at - peaking out about 3.75. How you looking? Okay, Ron. You're 3.7 to 4.0?
2573710|CMP|Yes, I'm reading 3.8.
2573712|CDR|Okay. EVA station pressure gauge still up?
2573715|CMP|EVA station pressure gauge - it's ... I can't see it. Okay. Still - yes, about one-third - -
2573720|CDR|Okay.
2573721|CMP|- - third ... there. ...
2573725|CDR|Okay. You do not have a tone, right?
2573728|CMP|No tone.
2573729|CDR|Okay, can you get panel 3, S-BAND AUX TV to TV?
2573733|CMP|(Laughter) Okay.
2573734|CDR|If you can do it.
2573737|CMP|... the old jett bag in the way here. Okay, TV is going up to TV.
2573747|CDR|You got it?
2573747|CMP|Yes.
2573748|CDR|Okay. I've got lines on the monitor, and Houston, the CDR's going ... PTT.
2573756|CC|Roger, CDR.
2573801|CDR|Okay, Ron. We're ready for the hatch opening. The lock pin release knob, unlock.
2573805|CMP|Okay. Lock pin release knob, the one on the side. Push it down to yellow, right?
2573810|CDR|Unlock indicator release, white goes to yellow.
2573813|CMP|White goes to yellow. Okay.
2573814|CDR|Gear box selector, unlatch.
2573816|CMP|Gear box selector to unlatch.
2573818|CDR|Actuator handle, unlatch.
2573820|CMP|Actuator handle to unlatch.
2573822|CDR|Unstow actuator handle.
2573824|CMP|Okay. We'll unstow the old actuator handle.
2573827|CDR|And the hatch is yours. Unlock it.
2573829|CMP|Okay, here we go. 1,2,3,- Oop! I got ahold of it. And a bunch of junk going out there. (Laughter) Lost the - Oh, there goes the pen. Yes, ... (Laughter) Okay. It was a felt-tip pen. No scissors. (Laughter)
2573908|CDR|Say, Ron. You want to - actuator handle select lock to L.
2573923|CMP|Okay, wait a minute. Actuator handle to latch. Okay, she's stowed. Yes, it's stowed in there. There it is, okay. There we go.
2573943|CDR|Okay, now it's stowed.
2573943|CMP|Now it's stowed.
2573944|CDR|Okay. Gear box selector to latch.
2573948|CMP|Gear box selector is latched.
2573951|CDR|Okay, and you and Jack can both lo - lower your inner visors.
2573955|CMP|Okay, inner visor's lowered.
2573957|LMP|Okay.
2573959|CMP|That's the ... - -
2573959|CDR|Okay. Open hatch slowly, and verify that our hex clears.
2574004|CMP|Verify the what? Oh, the hex. Yes. It's a good thing I hung on to it, or it would have been open by itself. ... Now you're going in - here, let me ... a little bit. Now it's got it.
2574045|CDR|Okay, Houston. The hatch is open.
2574048|CC|Roger, America.
2574050|CMP|Almost.
2574059|CMP|Hey, there's the Earth, right out the hatch!
2574102|CDR|Okay, Ron. You've got a - -
2574104|CMP|The crescent Earth.
2574105|CDR|You've got a GO for egress.
2574107|CMP|Beautiful.
2574109|CDR|And just take it slow.
2574110|CMP|Okay. First of all, I got to get back in, and get the old TV camera. Oop. Yes. That's right. I don't even know where the Sun is. Which way is the Sun? Okay, yes. Sun's on the right. Okay.
2574148|CDR|Okay, Houston. Ron's putting the camera out there on the pole now - pole out there, rather.
2574153|CC|Roger. We see the EVA light out there.
2574155|CMP|... stay lower?
2574200|CDR|Okay.
2574201|CMP|Man, that Sun is bright, Whoooo!
2574204|CDR|Pull down that visor, Ron. You're going to need it.
2574207|CMP|Yes.
2574209|CDR|Not the metal one, unless you really need it.
2574212|CMP|No, I don't want the metal one.
2574213|CDR|No, just get the gold one. That's all you need.
2574225|CMP|I'm trying to - -
2574226|CDR|Okay, you're clear back here.
2574232|CMP|Man, oh man. We're about to get the old TV pole in and lined up. Locked in there. Oh, oh, forgot to turn the camera on. You have it back? The - sequence, yes. Yes, let me just get on up in the - -
2574315|CDR|You're a long way from home. We don't want to lose you.
2574318|CMP|Okay. ... Hey, I think I hear it buzzing. How's the TV picture, Houston?
2574327|CC|Really great, Ron. Looks great.
2574332|CMP|Okay. Hey, I see what you were talking about, Gene, on this blister. Something has really blistered on it. Like Quad Alfa. There's a good one? Okay.
2574353|CMP|Guess we're cleared to go down and get the old - the old lunar sounder cassette, huh?
2574401|CDR|Okay.
2574404|CMP|Okay. Man, I got my foot hooked to something. Which way do I need to go? There we go. Okay. Okay. How's that? Okay. Forward? Go now? Am I clear?
2574451|CDR|You're clear, babe. Go.
2574454|CMP|Okay. Hot-diggety-dog!
2574458|CDR|Okay. Did you see him? He's out.
2574501|CC|Roger.
2574503|CMP|Am I on the tube?
2574508|CC|That's affirmative.
2574512|CMP|Okay.
2574514|CC|Outstanding quality picture, Ron.
2574518|CMP|Did you see me wave?
2574526|CC|That's affirmative.
2574526|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. Beautiful! Hey, the paint on here is just a - it's a silver paint - and it's just little blisters on it, is all. You just kind of peel it off with your fingers. Yes, it rolled off the other way. Hey, I can see the Moon back behind me! Beautiful! The Moon is down there to the right - full Moon - and off to the left, just outside the hatch down here, is a crescent Earth. Maybe I can get a picture of that - the Earth as I'm coming back in there. But the crescent Earth is not like a crescent Moon. It's got kind of like horns, and the horns go all the way around, and it makes almost three-quarters of a circle. Hey, that last mapping camera retract must have worked because the door is closed - everything is closed on it.
2574638|CDR|Okay, Ron, you did get the camera? Right? The DAC ON?
2574642|CMP|Yes. Okay, DAC's working.
2574644|CDR|Okay, you're GO to transfer to SIM bay and get in the foot restraints.
2574648|CMP|Okay. Here's a piece of the thermal blanket from the - from the SIM door jett. Hey, Houston, they're just kind of laying there underneath the EVA handle.
2574700|CC|Roger. We see it. Confirm.
2574703|CMP|Okay. But it's a pretty clean cut from the SIM bay itself. That's just a piece of that thermal blanket that's sticking around there. Man, it's black off this other way! The pan camera lens is all stowed.
2574732|CMP|(Humming) Okay. (Humming)
2574812|CMP|Hey, almost had my foot in there, then the cable was between my foot - Can you? Okay, I'm having a little trouble, right now, just torquing down to get my foot in the foot restraint, for some reason. Yes. No, not yet. Okay. Okay, the right one's in. And the left one's in. Hey, pretty stable right here. Let go of both hands? See?
2574910|CC|Roger. We see you waving.
2574913|CMP|(Laughter) Hey, this is great! Talk - talk about being a spaceman, this is it! Okay, back to work! My feet are a little stiffer, I think, or something than - than normal. Okay, let's try the old - Ah-ha, the ... is still there! Okay, here's the pan cassette cover and - Oops, there it goes. Okay, before we do anything else here, I guess I better - better hook the old tether on the thing. Okay, tether is on. And she's locked. Okay. It is behind my back? Oh, okay. It's nice and white down here. The UV cover's closed real well. Doesn't seem to be any ... at all on the white face, on the UV or the IR. Everything is in good shape. Looks like part of that - Oh, the cork insulation - chipped off again down here in the corner - in the corner that I'm looking at. Okay, let's try the old cassette. We'll push down on it until it goes past center. Ah-ha! I think that was more than 2 pounds of force to come out, but it came out. And got the film.
2575146|CMP|Okay, she's locked in there. These EVA handholds are - Hey, the foot just came out - okay - the EVA handholds are - okay, got them free - are rougher than - What was that? I just ... Oh, that was my pocket, okay. And it creates a torque when I cut - when I let go of that pocket, there, I let go with a little bit of a force, and the force has a tendency to throw your feet way up in the air. (Humming)
2575248|CDR|Keep talking, Ron. I'm walking that one with you.
2575250|CMP|Okay. Coming right back. Oh, my feets are bouncing up in the air again. Shouldn't be any - Yes, can you do it? No. Ooooh. Hope I don't hit the end and bounce up again. Yes. See, you twist yourself down there, and then you got to twist to stop, or - or it - you hit - you hit the end and you bounce back up in the air again. Okay, there comes some of the paint. Oh, we'll get attached to the thing on there, before I take mine off. Okay, here comes the old cassette. That - yes - that close enough, Jack, or you want a little closer? Okay. Yes. ... Yes, hook them ... anyway. Okay, and you got the old lunar sounder cassette.
2575426|CDR|Okay, Ron, you're GO to get the pan camera.
2575428|CMP|Pan camera's next, huh?
2575430|CDR|We got a couple of hard and soft covers, don't forget.
2575433|CMP|Yes, yes, there's a couple of covers on there. You know, the old EVA pole, I thought when I was looking at that the other day - it depended on what kind of light you're in - it looked like it was burned a little bit. And, sure enough, it is. Okay, let's see, now, which way did I turn on on this thing. I'm still backwards down here. What the heck? (Humming)
2575523|CMP|Okay, well, we need to get that big old pan camera. (Humming) Oops.
2575555|CMP|Okay, I'm locked in there, and you can relax a little bit. Let's see, old suit pressure is - must be breathing a little bit, it's up to 4.0. (Humming)
2575614|CDR|Houston, this is America. Everything is looking good from here.
2575619|CMP|Houston, this is - Let's see, when you're EVA, they use - they use your name, don't they?
2575625|CC|Okay, Ron. Yes, sir, we'll use it, Ron.
2575629|CMP|Houston, this is Ron. Okay? You hear me okay, I guess, huh?
2575637|CC|Roger, Ron. Read you loud and clear.
2575641|CMP|Okay. (Laughter) Oh, this is great, I'll tell you!
2575648|CC|Yes, we thought it was Mr. America.
2575652|CMP|(Laughter) Well, it is. Something like that. Oh, boy! Beautiful Moon! Full Moon down there. Runs back of - What? You know, you can't see anything. The only thing I can see is the SIM bay. I can see the - the engine bell sitting back here. That's a pretty good sized thing, too. And, of course, the UV - the VHF antenna - is still sticking out there. All of the - all of the poles are on it. So it's working all right. Oh, that's a little bit of a rest. Let's pull the old metal thing off here. Oh, okay, well - see it? Can you see that? The thing I'm holding up. Yes, it's the - it's the cover that's on the outside of the pan camera. It's a thermal cover, see, that covers up the cassette.
2575814|CMP|Yes, well, I'm in the shadows. There we go. Yes. See, that's right. That's the thermal cover that's on there, and then that's the - -
2575826|CC|Roger. Yes, we see it, Ron.
2575826|CMP|- - Whooooee (Laughter) Okay. Well, let's see. Ah-ha! There's the pan camera cassette down there.
2575850|CC|We just saw that cover.
2575854|CMP|Okay.
2575906|CMP|Okay. Let's see, that's hooked down. And lock it. Yes. ... hook laying there. Okay, it's locked so it won't come apart. Okay, where's the old pin. There it is. (Humming)
2580009|CMP|Okay, pin is pulled. Frees the handle. And out she comes. Nice and easy. This a heavy son of a gun. Not heavy up here, it just has a lot of - a lot of momentum to it. Once she starts pulling in one direction, it just takes a lot of force to stop it. And we'll just try and - Oops, there's a - ... right there. Wouldn't want to do that. Let me get this thing first and then get this foot out. Okay. I think I'll just kind of let that thing go and hang on with both hands. Get it started right in front of me. Have to look the best way to see that one. Okay. It's just kind of floating around up there. Both feet are free. Okay.
2580131|CMP|Hey, it's just kind of coming along with me. I'll just let her do that. Hey, she's just floating there.
2580157|CMP|Okay. Coming. She's still coming. Must be back behind me. That's good. Nice and slow. Because you don't want that thing banging around too much up there, I don't think.
2580224|CMP|Ahhh, there it is! Delivered it right to you. (Laughter) That's the way it ought to be done, isn't it? Okay, got it locked? Yes. Okay. Ah, you got it hooked on my French gauntlet - my truss guard. (Laughter) Okay. That's a good idea. Oh, that Sun's bright when you look into it. That is a biggy. (Humming) You know, I just kind of hook it along underneath me and just go backwards down there. (Humming) That's an unorthodox way to enter the SIM bay, but it works. Okay. We'll ease on up. Oh, okay. I'm going to rest when I get my feet in that thing. Wish you could kind of rest here. You could take it nice and easy. Yes, once you get your feet in there, except that - it kind of - you almost feel like maybe they might come out, you know. (Laughter) So I'm not sure you really trust them. The right foot's in good and tight. Hello, Mom!
2580441|CC|We see you, Ron. Looking great.
2580444|CMP|Hello, Jon. Hi, Jon. How are you doing? Hi, Jaime. Let's see, I'm supposed to rest, though, aren't I? What would you like to know about the SIM bay? Looks great. Nothing is scorched. I was kind of surprised when I saw it on this mapping camera - There was - the two - well, one's just kind of a steel plate there, and right on top of the door, there's something with a piece of tape on it. And I thought that piece of tape came off before launch.
2580521|CC|Ron, just a couple questions while you're standing there resting. Is there any damage to the cable that the mapping camera - the cable between the mapping camera and the shelf?
2580534|CMP|Let me check on that one.
2580536|CC|Roger. Don't move and look at it. It was not that important. If you can see it, fine; otherwise, forget it.
2580542|CMP|Yes. Okay. I want to kind of take a look at it when I go by. There's Jack (laughter) Hey, how are you doing? You're looking right into the Sun, though, and I'm looking right at you. I should have a camera, and I could take your picture. And there - see the Moon back over there? That's a - Well, that's the way it goes. Hey, it's clearer down here when you take that visor up. I hope I took the outside one. I mean the gold one. No, that's both of them, I think. Better leave it down. There we go. Yes, you take the outside one up a little ways and then you can really see down in the SIM bay. You know, that tape down in here is not scorched one bit. The whole side of the spacecraft is scorched like a son of a gun - but the - you know, the panels, and everything. Man, there's bubbles, you know, on all that silver paint that's on here - is, you know, it used to be kind of a bright-looking silver paint. It looks like - it's in a shadow right now - but it looks like it's just been heated up one way or another. Yes, that's it up here between the SIM bay and the top of the service module. It actually looks like it's been burned, you know. Not just a little bit warm, it's just kind of burned because it's bubbled. Yes. That's what you were seeing from the LM, I'm sure. And - but - as far as I can - it's kind of dark down the other side of the spacecraft - the other side of the SIM bay - but it looks like the thrusters don't make any - hardly any marks on there. Now, I look - I look at quad A - the side of quad A thruster, though, and it's all scorched. So I'm not sure but what that might have been - what in the world could do that? Tower jett, do you suppose? I don't know. Might have. Well, let's take one of these covers off. Oh, this is - like it did in practice. (Laughter) Sticking underneath the door. Looks like I can jerk on it a little harder up here. In practice, I didn't want to break it. There's - a part of the - could you see that one?
2580828|CC|Roger. We see it. Looks like the outer-space Olympics going on up there.
2580834|CMP|(Laughter) Hey, this is great, I'll tell you! And let me see which way to throw it so you all can see it down there. There it goes. (Chuckle) Okay - -
2580850|CC|Roger. We see it reflecting off in the distance.
2580852|CMP|Did you see it? Okay.
2580856|CC|Never did that in the water tank.
2580900|CMP|(Laughter) Yes, That's the little - the Mylar. That's that tinfoil they make the LM out of, you know.
2580909|CC|Roger.
2580910|CMP|(Laughter) No, not really. You know, it's kind of an insulation-type stuff. And here we go.
2580924|CDR|If that's what they made the LM out of, you'd never be able to pull it apart, I'll tell you.
2580927|CMP|(Laughter) That's right. I - I'm joking about that, you know. I'm really joking. Fellows, it was a good vehicle.
2580935|CC|We'll send your apologies to Bethpage.
2580940|CMP|And (laughter) - No, I guess Bethpage knows I'm joking, you know. Let me see. Hey, I got to make sure I get this on the right handle here, don't I?
2581012|CMP|Gee, that's why I wore my watch, and I forgot to start it. (Laughter) Okay. About 40 minutes, huh?
2581019|CC|We've got you 35 minutes - 36 minutes, Ron.
2581024|CMP|Oh, okay. Oh. Okay. Yes, the EVA lights are kind of blistered, also. No, they're back behind, toward the Sun. Put some hooks on there now. I'm hooked onto the (chuckle) cassette. No, maybe that tape's supposed to be on that pan camera, I'm sure. Put the old doors back in there real well. I don't know what - what would cause that thing to - ... those 4 minutes, anyhow. Ah-ha! There's the old mapper cassette. Well, I'm going to - am. I supposed to pick it up or what? I want to take a look down in there. Can't get out that way. (Laughter) Got my left foot stuck in there, and you can't go out in the left direction with - with my foot in there. You have to lean over to the right a little bit to take your foot out. (Humming) Yes, nice and clean - down in there. Yes, that cable's in the clear. I can see down in there. There doesn't seem to be anything hanging up on it at all.
2581244|CC|Okay, Ron; good show.
2581247|CMP|Okay. Put the old Sun visor down now. Whoops, come back here, little cassette. (Humming) Yes, I was going to try to lift that door up, but should have done that while I was punched down in there.
2581322|CC|There's no requirement on that, Ron; no requirement.
2581327|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. I want to check one thing while I'm out here before I leave, and to see the bottom of this quad A. Forgot to look at it. Yes, well, it looks just like the side almost. More blistered on the side than it is on the bottom, but I think maybe it's just the paint. Okay, I'm coming back in. Oh, Okay.
2581421|CMP|Man, the RTV is good out here. Looks brand new. Whatever they put on the hinge. Looks like that RTV stuff, you know. That's why they sealed around all their doors on here. And it's spanking clean as ever. (Humming) Okay, no hurry. ... Once (Chuckle) - Outstanding - once you get stable in a position, see, I can pretty much hang on with one hand, and I can twist - Oops. Yes, once you start going, it's a son of a gun to try - it's all wrist action. Working - Yes, but once you get stable on the thing, you can kind of relax there, and - Yes... drift, you know, and if I ever bang my foot against - against something, just - just barely touch it, and it bangs right back. And - Hey, America looks really great there. Still got that silver tape on him - or is it blue? Looks silver with this helmet. Let's see, I've got to get over this way farther this time, don't I? Okay. There we go. Hey, I got a picture of the waste water dump from the LM the other day, but it looks the same way now. There's all kinds of little ice particles all around the - the periphery of the dump nozzle itself. It covers up the - well, that kind of gold part that's - that's on the - on the end of the dump nozzle. And then, there are little particles of frozen water, I guess - must be - that are - that are all over - up the side of the spacecraft there, but only in the vicinity of the - the nozzle. It goes up just about to window number 1 - it goes up to window number 1 - well, maybe on up to - no, there's particles all the way up the side of the spacecraft, clear up to the top of the tunnel. But they're real fine. I want to see if they're stuck on there. Hey, you can just touch them, and they blow away. They're just little ice particles.
2581749|CDR|Okay, Houston. We got all three cassettes inside.
2581752|CC|Roger, Good show.
2581754|CMP|Hey, here's something. You know, the one thing that really shows up - and it makes you kind of proud - it says United States, and it's got a United States of America flag right below it. That didn't get scorched or a darn thing. That's great. And - let's see now - I see what Charlie Duke meant. Man, it's dark out here. It is really dark. The scimitar antenna, right there - in no shape - no problem. Wish there were some more handholds, I'd go around the other side of the spacecraft. Take a look at the high gain. There aren't any more handholds.
2581939|CC|Okay, Ron, we don't need any more spacecraft commentary. We'd like you to go ahead and terminate the EVA. You're looking great. You're looking great. Everybody's really pleased, and we'd just like to go ahead and terminate.
2581956|CMP|Okay. Sounds good.
2581959|CDR|Okay, Bob, we'll get back in.
2582003|CMP|Torque? I can't. How's that?
2582024|CMP|Okay, I guess we'll - start getting back in then. I'm up below the camera right now.
2582034|CC|Ron, you'd be happy to know, on the TV, we got a great view of your OPS [?] with the United States flag on it.
2582041|CMP|Hey, beautiful! Perfect! Let's see, which way do I want to get the umbilical down there? Oh, yes, but you're pulling me sidewise, okay. That's all right. Wait a minute. Okay. No, that's all right. Okay. You are in good shape now. Go ahead and start pulling in, now.
2582108|CDR|Wait a minute, Ron, until we get Jack in the right place.
2582112|CMP|Okay.
2582144|CMP|Is it clear?
2582145|CDR|Yes, the umbilical's in. Come on in.
2582148|CMP|Okay.
2582148|CDR|You coming in head down or up?
2582151|CMP|Up. This way right now.
2582154|CDR|You can't close the hatch that way.
2582156|CMP|I know it.
2582157|CDR|Okay.
2582209|CMP|Not yet. What does that look like on the monitor?
2582220|CC|Well, you should have - test me, and I wouldn't want to guess. It's probably the full Moon, isn't it?
2582227|CMP|It is.
2582231|CC|You taught me well, Ron; taught me well.
2582235|CMP|Okay, you got - got you real well there. Okay, then I'm going to arc it around and ... See if I can turn around here and - Yes, I am. Trying to, anyhow. Yes, wait a minute, I can't - No, I'm not.
2582312|CMP|Yes, afraid I can't get to it. Can't point it. Okay, well, I'll just have to get back in.
2582318|CC|Okay, Ron, we know what you're trying to do, and we appreciate the TV show. We're looking - we're sorry to see you go, but we'd like to terminate.
2582326|CMP|(Laughter)
2582328|CDR|We're terminating - -
2582329|CMP|Okay, we're terminating.
2582330|CC|And you might be advised you're right on the Flight Plan, you're right on the Flight Plan.
2582336|CMP|Oh, okay. Good. I didn't want to get - cut my time short, or anything, you know.
2582346|CDR|Unless you can set it way back there. Okay, then I'll keep it right here.
2582350|CMP|Sure it's there, Geno? We can shove it underneath your couch.
2582355|CDR|That's the best place to shove it.
2582359|CMP|Can you do that? I'll get up out of your way, here.
2582400|CDR|Let me get it. Let me get out from under the cord. Okay.
2582407|CMP|And, if you can get the TV switch there, Jack, that kind of saves - all that stuff, I guess.
2582417|LMP|Okay.
2582418|CMP|If you can't, I'll get it when I come in.
2582422|CDR|Okay, and I got it OFF up here, too. Okay, you're in STANDBY. That's all.
2582432|CMP|Okay. I'm going to have to come in there kind of - a little bit blinded, because, in order to get in, I got to look at the Sun. So you just got to point me in the right direction there.
2582449|CMP|(Laughter) Hey, one of our - Wait a minute - one of our - Kleenexes we're using to wipe the windows with is stuck in the - the gear thing. (Laughter) There it goes.
2582507|CDR|Okay.
2582508|CMP|Okay.
2582510|CDR|Okay, and back on down.
2582511|CMP|Well, let me see here - backing down - let me see, which way do I -
2582516|CDR|Straight down.
2582519|CMP|Okay.
2582520|CDR|I got your leg.
2582521|CMP|Got my leg?
2582522|CDR|Okay, on the left, make sure that the - -
2582524|CMP|Wait a minute, let me - What? Swing on the leg, or what?
2582527|CDR|No. Just kick it down, you'll be free. Kick your - kick your right leg down.
2582531|CMP|There we go. Okay.
2582532|CC|Hey, Ron. We assume the scissors went out the hatch. is that affirm?
2582539|CMP|(Laughter) I didn't see a thing.
2582541|CDR|Can you pull it - let me get your umbilical.
2582543|CMP|(Laughter) The only thing I saw go out was the - -
2582546|CDR|Okay, Jack - -
2582547|CMP|- - ...
2582548|CDR|Ron, Ron, how's the hatch? Get down on the hatch. Your OPS isn't fitting through the top. Pull yourself down. Straight forward. Face down. Nose down. Now back.
2582557|CMP|Okay. How's that?
2582558|CDR|Now back. Keep coming. Keep coming. Now, can you reach the hatch?
2582603|CMP|Yes, makes it sort of ... Let me get back in a little bit.
2582606|CDR|Okay.
2582607|CMP|Let me get this visor up. One of them, anyhow. That's a pretty Earth up there.
2582614|CDR|Okay. Keep - keep your - -
2582615|CMP|Keep your hand on the - the hatch here. ... crescent Earth.
2582620|CDR|Now, does the seal look good to you, while you got your nose there?
2582623|CMP|Yes. Wait a minute - -
2582624|CDR|Check that stuff on the ...
2582624|CMP|Got a cassette going out the window, there. Okay, it's clear.
2582630|CDR|Okay.
2582632|CMP|You'll have to look.
2582634|CDR|Kick that back.
2582703|CMP|Okay, now I think everything's clear out of the hatch.
2582706|CDR|Okay.
2582707|CMP|You see, the reason we put that - -
2582709|CDR|Okay.
2582710|CMP|Can we get rid of the - instead of pulling the pip pin, we put this little hex nut, see, because I can reach down there and grab hold of the - -
2582719|CDR|Okay. Start pulling.
2582720|CMP|- - the hook and pull - and here she comes.
2582725|CDR|Okay, she's coming. Here she comes.
2582727|CMP|Okay, and I'm already back inside here.
2582728|CDR|Okay.
2582730|CMP|Man, it's dark in here!
2582731|CDR|Yes.
2582734|CDR|Okay. You got to - when you made your first turn, you got a pull light, there.
2582737|CMP|Wait a minute.
2582744|CDR|Okay, get a couple turns on it.
2582746|CMP|Okay. There's one turn on it. I mean - I - I can release it?
2582750|CDR|Okay, now get it back.
2582751|CMP|Okay. That's a little harder to pull shut than I - -
2582754|CDR|The hatch is coming.
2582756|CMP|Yes, I thought it was.
2582757|CDR|Keep going.
2582758|CMP|That's as far as it will go.
2582801|CMP|Let's see, does that line up with these little marks on there?
2582805|CDR|Okay; and the hex is clear. That one's in good shape. Close the hatch and - Okay. Verify lock pin dropped in, white to white.
2582812|CMP|Yes. Okay, we're white to white.
2582814|LMP|Okay, stow actuator handle, ACTUATOR HANDLE in NEUTRAL.
2582818|CMP|ACTUATOR HANDLE is NEUTRAL, and it's stowed.
2582822|LMP|Okay, you still got white to white?
2582824|CMP|I still got white to white.
2582825|LMP|And the dogs over here look good to me.
2582827|CMP|The dogs look good, let me see if my pencil mark is on there.
2582831|CMP|Yes, they're lined up.
2582832|LMP|Okay. GEAR BOX SELECTOR - LATCH. Verify.
2582834|CMP|GEAR BOX SELECTOR is verified LATCH.
2582837|LMP|Okay. Cabin repress.
2582838|CMP|Wait a minute, I got to close the - Oh, okay, now I - -
2582841|CDR|Let's get this, then we can start on cabin repress, okay?
2582843|CMP|Okay. Side hatch dump valve, close.
2582847|LMP|Okay. Side hatch dump valve, close.
2582849|CMP|Okay, we're closing it.
2582907|CMP|You know, it's funny. We didn't see anything come up around that crazy ... we put in there, but as soon as I opened the hatch, the whole world came out.
2582913|LMP|Okay.
2582914|CMP|Okay. Okay, it's closed.
2582916|LMP|Okay, on 326, REPRESS PACKAGE, OFF.
2582920|CMP|Stand by. Well, we got all the stuff in there.
2582926|LMP|Got it all.
2582927|CDR|Okay. REPRESS PACKAGE is OFF. Ron, on 601, O2 - REPRESS O2 OPEN and ... CLOSED. Cabin pressure, 1 psi.
2582937|CMP|Okay, I can't see what the - -
2582939|LMP|Geno, then you'll have to give us a hack on 1 psi if you can.
2582942|CMP|Wait a minute.
2582943|CC|Gene, we're watching. We'll give you a hack at 1 psi. No problem.
2582948|CDR|Okay, we're - REPRESS is OPEN.
2582952|CMP|And I can't get it off there. Wait a minute - -
2582954|LMP|It's going to come pretty fast, Ron.
2582957|CMP|I can't even - Wait a minute - I can't turn around far enough to see it.
2583007|CC|And, America, we see your cabin coming up. You're at 0.3.
2583012|LMP|Okay.
2583013|CMP|0.3? (Laughter)
2583016|CC|You're at 0.7, 0.7.
2583022|CC|Okay; turn it off, you're at 0.1 - I'll say again, 1 psi.
2583028|CMP|(Laughter) Okay.
2583030|CDR|Okay; give us a GO when it looks good, Houston.
2583110|CMP|Oh, yes. See the hatch - -
2583112|CC|Okay, America, you're looking good. No ...
2583118|CMP|Okay, we're going to go REPRESS - -
2583119|CDR|Okay, REPRESS - OPEN, and let it go to zero, Ron.
2583122|CMP|Okay.
2583124|CDR|We'll end up with about 2 psi. Can you see the gauge?
2583130|CMP|Well, wait a minute. Let me turn ... I think I'm still hooked ... There we go. Okay, I can see - No, that's temperature. Okay, here it is.
2583142|CDR|No, no. I mean the REPRESS O2.
2583144|CMP|Oh, the REPRESS O2?
2583146|CDR|Right in front of you.
2583147|CMP|Yes, it's almost zero. Oh (laughter) I was looking at CABIN PRESSURE.
2583149|LMP|No, REPRESS O2.
2583151|CMP|It's about zero.
2583154|CDR|Well, when you think it's zero, you can - -
2583156|CC|Okay, Gene, we got - we're indicating 2 psi down here at this time.
2583202|CDR|Okay, Ron. If it's zero, you can close REPRESS O2 valve.
2583206|CMP|Okay, we'll close the REPRESS O2. What the - Okay, ... place for a valve.
2583221|LMP|Okay, we're going to let your flow bring ... rate.
2583225|CMP|Okay.
2583227|CDR|And your next move, after we get a hack at 3, will be to disconnect your OPS hose and hold it directly into the cabin volume - -
2583234|CMP|Okay.
2583234|CDR|- - and We'll get your OPS ...
2583236|CMP|Would you - would you believe I'll let you do that?
2583238|CDR|Yes, I would.
2583239|CMP|(Laughter) Okay, because you'll be going through this thing.
2583242|CDR|Yes. Yes, I'm almost down there, now.
2583245|CMP|Say, Houston, I was surprised when I closed the hatch here. It came closed real well, up until about an inch from the - Can you see the CABIN?
2583301|CDR|No.
2583302|CC|Ron, we're watching the CABIN. It's 2.2. I'll give you a call at 3.
2583308|CMP|Oh, okay; mighty fine, Bob. I was going to say the - when you're closing the hatch, I expected it to come all the way closed, you know? And it came to within about an inch of the - of being closed on the outer - not the inside, but the other side, and wouldn't come any more, unless you really pulled on it.
2583328|CDR|Yes.
2583329|CMP|So and then your - Of course, it was pretty easy to pull because you're kind of flattened down in there anyhow. You just pull it closed, and then once you get the lever over the - over the center, it comes right closed.
2583344|CDR|Okay, Ron, what I'll do when we get up to 3, I'll disconnect your OPS hose, Jack, and I'll let you pull it around behind his back. And, then, you can hold it in the open cabin and I'll actuate his OPS.
2583356|LMP|Well, we got a lot of use out of that OPS.
2583358|CMP|Yes. Let me actuate it, okay?
2583401|CDR|Okay. I'm glad I didn't have to earlier in the week.
2583404|CMP|Well, me, too, you know. I'm glad I didn't have to today either.
2583407|CDR|Yes, I am, too.
2583417|CMP|You know, my gloves are dirty, but I think they're dirty from getting ahold of that - those dirty suits of you guys, you know. Jack, did you get ...
2583420|LMP|Okay.
2583437|CMP|Well, you know, you want to see if there's any residuals from the thrusters out there, you know. Well, I couldn't see anything anywhere except the - on the EVA handrails themselves. And that really didn't look like it was a residual to me. It's just a discoloration, and it's kind of a changing of the condition of the - whatever is on those things, you know. Hope they're not painted. I guess what I'm saying is that they were shiny burnished aluminum, I guess, or whatever, prior to lift-off, but now they're kind of a dirty-looking burnished stuff.
2583547|CDR|Okay, Ron, when they give us that 3, I'll get your hose. Jack can hold it in the cabin, you can activate your OPS.
2583555|CMP|Okay.
2583557|CDR|Then we'll watch the cabin come up to 5, and then the OPS will come off, then we'll get a HIGH O2.
2583704|CDR|How we doing down there, Houston? This is America.
2583709|CC|America, you're looking great. You're up at 2.6. It's going up slowly, just like we expected.
2583718|CDR|Okay.
2583735|CDR|Not a bad performance by my CMP, was it?
2583738|CMP|(Laughter)
2583738|CC|That was beautiful. We had a beautiful television show. Really beautiful.
2583744|CMP|(Laughter)
2583754|CDR|Well, we got your three packs here all snuggled away.
2583800|CC|Yes, indeed, you made a lot of people in the back room very happy. They're looking forward to getting that film.
2583813|CMP|Well, the best part about it is, from all indications, it ought to be real good film, too.
2583819|CC|Yes, sir. Looks like everything worked out great. You're at 2.7 and climbing very slowly.
2583841|CMP|(Laughter)
2583942|CMP|Hey, Houston. Tell Chuck Stahl [?] that attitude for the EVA was outstanding.
2583949|CC|Thank you, Ron, he's listening right here, and he's been on the console during the whole period. Got a big grin on his face right now.
2584040|CC|And, America, the cabin is at 3 psi.
2584049|CDR|Okay, Robert, we're pressing on. Okay, Ron, I'll get your - -
2584052|CMP|Can you get them off?
2584055|CDR|Yes. Okay, Jack, if you can get the - hose from behind him.
2584103|CDR|Okay, go ahead and activate it, young man.
2584106|CMP|You got ahold of it, Jack? Okay.
2584109|CDR|Yes, hold on to it tight.
2584117|CMP|You feel anything? Yes, it's really blowing in there.
2584121|CDR|Okay, we'd like a hack on the cabin when we get to 5.
2584126|CC|Roger, America. We'll give you a hack.
2584205|CDR|Probably can ... that out. O2 HIGH FLOW, Jack, that's a MASTER ALARM ... There it is. Yes...
2584214|LMP|That's the main regs coming in, I'll bet you.
2584216|CMP|Must be the main regs cutting in. (Laughter) That's right, you can't see MASTER ALARMs, can you?
2584357|CC|Okay, America; you got 5.1 cabin press.
2584403|CMP|Okay. I'm coming off.
2584409|CDR|Okay, and I'm going ...
2584418|CMP|Okay. I'm going to pop the CABIN out there if I don't turn mine off pretty quick. Okay. Oh, no, it didn't come up that fast. There's not that big a hurry. We're waiting a long time to get - to get from 2 to 3. Yes, you get a HIGH O2 FLOW.
2584516|CMP|Yes, my - Oh, your accessory bag is in there, I guess. The - the gloves.
2584530|CMP|Just let me get the tone down here. Ding, ding, ding, ding. Okay, I got it. I think we did, didn't we?
2584606|CMP|Yes, if we can't find that one, let's find another one. Got to have something to stick - stick my gloves in, you know. Yes, the thing you put your gloves in, you know? There it is, right there. Yes, you got to use yours. (Laughter) Okay.
2584628|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 258:46 Ground Elapsed Time. To run briefly over the transearth EVA event times. Depressurization began at Ground Elapsed Time of 257:35. TV turned on shortly after Evans came out. Evans was clear outside the spacecraft at 257:45 approximately 10 minutes after hatch open - or depressurization I should say. He brought back the lunar sounder film cassette at 257:54. His mean heartrate during this early period of the EVA was running around 139 and 140, and began to taper off as he got more accustomed to this new environment outside the spacecraft. The panoramic camera cassette was retrieved at approximately 258:03 back into the cabin. Mapping camera cassette 258:16. Evans returned to the Command Module at approximately 258:28 the hatch was closed the TV turned off just about 4 minutes prior to the hatch closure. Repressurization began at 258:28 at hatch closure and ended just a few moments ago at 258:44. At this time there is an orbital science briefing which will begin in the main auditorium. The air to ground circuit will be recorded for delayed playback at the conclusion of the lunar orbital science briefing and a followup of that will be the change of shift press conference with the flight director Neil Hutchinson. Now estimated to take place at about 4:30. At 258:48 this is Apollo Control.
2584643|CMP|... Okay.
2584645|CC|America, Houston. Your cabin pressure's up to 5.5, 5.5.
2584652|CMP|Okay, we'll turn this off now.
2584654|CDR|Okay, we're right now at the point where we're going EVA STATION O2 OFF.
2584657|CMP|... off my clothes? Por favor.
2584702|CMP|Yes. (laughter) ... stick them in the bag ...
2584712|CMP|Okay.
2584725|CMP|Smells kind of funny in there. What'd you guys do? (Laughter)
2584732|CMP|Surge tank. Ahhhh, yes, it's 700 now, 725. is that what that - Yes, that's why -
2584744|CDR|Better turn the ...
2584747|CMP|There we are. Okay, I'll turn the TV switch on. Well, we're really not transmitting down.
2584756|CMP|Okay? Yes, we can go to FILL. We got 600, 700, let's see - -
2584803|CDR|Okay. ... FILL on the REPRESS at this time.
2584808|CMP|How low do we take this down to? 400? Probably stop before that, anyhow.
2584816|CMP|Okay.
2584824|CC|America, Houston.
2584828|CMP|Yes, go ahead. Go ahead, Houston.
2584831|CC|Roger. Ron, just two reminders here while you go through your unsuiting and cleanup procedures. We're trying to get established on a new biomed cycle, so we'd like to have the LMP on biomed. We'll be coming up with a complete scheduling here shortly, and just a reminder for the LMP and the commander, we want to make sure we retrieve their PRDs.
2584858|CMP|(Laughter) Okay, that's a good point.
2584900|LMP|Okay, I gave you a PRD about 2 hours ago, and just to bring you up to date to where it was, and we'll keep them out.
2584908|CDR|And commander retrieved his yesterday.
2584911|CC|Yes. No problem. We just want to make - reminder. We just want you to be reminded that we need them.
2584916|CMP|Take mine out now. Wonder if I got any zaps when I was out there?
2584921|LMP|Thank you, Bob. I even forgot that I reminded you to remind me.
2585102|CMP|(Laughter) And 15055. I didn't get very many rads while I was out there, I guess. Like it was 51 this morning. Okay? Here, I'll hold this thing.
2585125|CMP|How about giving me a squirt? (Laughter)
2585134|CMP|That right there. Yes, three of them. I threw away all the dirty ones, I think. (Laughter) The whole time. Boy, it - Yes, it sure whipped out through there when I opened the hatch.
2585158|CC|Sure wish you'd seen the scissors go.
2585202|CMP|(Laughter) I'll bet - hey, I'll almost make a bet with somebody that it's down behind the optics.
2585211|CMP|Okay (chuckle). They don't look dirty to me, do they? Wash them off, anyhow, though.
2585233|CMP|Wait a minute, let me push them back ...
2585242|CMP|Should have used hot water. Or is that thing cold, you mean? is that cold? Boy, that is cold, isn't it? No, it doesn't fold there, just stick the whole thing in there like that. No.
2585309|CMP|Yes, now let's use some of that good food tape that's stuck over there. And there's some on the side of the - the light. You can use those to tape those holes ... Yes, just the mapping camera. Yes, that's all. No, just the map. Oh, it has? There's a chunk.
2585336|CMP|There's your hole through there. Oh, yes, we got a lot of tape, I'm sure. We want to tape this whole thing here.
2585518|CDR|Okay, Bob, we're in the process of cleaning up the cassettes - -
2585519|CMP|The breather holes - see the holes in this panel.
2585524|CC|Say again, CDR, you were cut out on VOX there.
2585530|CDR|Okay. I forgot Ron was still on VOX during this. I just wanted to keep you up to date. We're - we're taping up the cassettes now and cleaning them up and getting them stowed.
2585540|CC|Roger. Good show.
2585543|CMP|I'm sorry. I led myself astray. Yes, overlap it, because it won't stick to that thing very good. No, it just won't stick ... We'll just take tape and wrap all the way around the thing. Otherwise, it's not going to stick, period. Yes. It's up? That's right. ... (Chuckle)
2585704|CMP|Oh, we've been doing this for two or three flights, you know. Why change it for the last one? Yes, probably one all the way around. Get your corner, there. Yes, we got another roll of that tape you guys brought. Just about that size, I guess. You got it? Yes, they're down here. We missed them. (Laughter) Yes.
2585739|CMP|Keeps the light and the water out of it, I guess. Not the water because you got a breather hole, but keeps the light out that film slot.
2585844|CMP|Two of them are around this way.
2585849|CMP|Does take a lot of tape, doesn't it?
2585853|CMP|Yes, sure doesn't stick to a cassette. Sometime. I couldn't find mine. They must have been in the other set of gloves. I forgot about them. Well, that's ... No, there's nothing taped.
2590315|CDR|Okay, Bob, we're on 3-20, and we're all going to get out of our suits and stow them before we get the center couch back in.
2590327|CC|Roger, Gene. Sounds good.
2590333|CDR|And I guess I can get some DAP changes for you, if you'd like.
2590344|CC|Stand by on that.
2590349|CC|Okay, Gene; you're - you can go ahead and do the DAP change.
2590355|CC|America, Houston. Just one update. We won't give it to you as an update at this time, but wherever you see IR work just ignore it. Do not turn the IR on and no need to open the IR cover. We're through with it until just prior to entry interface.
2590418|CDR|Okay, Bob; understand that.
2590914|LMP|UV is ON.
2590918|LMP|And the UV cover's, coming OPEN.
2590922|CDR|Okay, Bob, I'm going to go down through the Flignt Plan down through about 259:45, get this maneuver started. And then we can press on.
2590936|CDR|Hello, Houston; America.
2590939|CC|Go, America; Houston.
2590943|CDR|Okay. I'm pressing on through the Flight Plan to about 259:45, and getting everything up to and including the maneuver, and then we will continue with our post-EVA.
2590958|CC|Okay. We'd like for you to hold on that maneuver, Gene. Don't start the maneuver.
2591006|CDR|I've already started my roll. Do you want me to stop it?
2591012|LMP|And did you copy the IR was ON and the COVER OPEN?
2591017|CC|Okay, we copy that. IR ON and the COVER OPEN.
2591026|LMP|I'm sorry. I was UV - ON. UV COVER, OPEN.
2591039|CDR|Hello, Houston; are you reading America?
2591041|CC|That's affirmative, America. Houston here.
2591046|CDR|Okay. Did you get the word that it was the UV - ON and the UV COVER, OPEN?
2591054|CC|Roger. We got that word.
2591059|CDR|Okay. And I'll stop my roll at 270 degrees and will not maneuver until I hear from you.
2591109|CC|Roger.
2591113|CDR|You're not getting a good key down there, by the way.
2591117|CC|Say again, Gene.
2591121|LMP|Houston, your keying is cutting you out, I think.
2591128|CC|Okay; are you reading me now?
2591132|LMP|Yes, that was good. Did you understand Gene's transmission on his stopping the roll?
2591138|CC|That's affirmative.
2591315|LMP|Houston. CABIN FAN is coming ON.
2591320|CC|Roger.
2591331|CC|America, Houston, you're cleared to go to the VERB 49 maneuver as published in the Flight Plan.
2591337|LMP|Okay, Bob.
2591344|LMP|Houston, would you like OMNI Alfa now?
2591351|CC|Negative. We'd like you to go to OMNI Charlie for now.
2591356|LMP|Oh, I'm sorry. Okay, OMNI Charlie, right.
2591401|CC|No need to apologize. The Flight Plan says Alfa; we're just going to Charlie, which is the best antenna.
2591410|LMP|Well, that's all right. I misunderstood what Gene just told me about his maneuver.
2592640|CC|America, we'd like OMNI Alfa.
2592647|CDR|Say again. You're cutting out badly.
2592649|CC|We would like OMNI Alfa. OMNI Alfa.
2592657|CDR|Okay. You said OMNI Alfa. We'll go there.
2592701|CDR|Houston, you read?
2592708|CC|America, Houston. Your comm is going to be a little ratty until you get into configuration here - or rather get into attitude.
2592718|CDR|Okay, Bob, I'm reading you now. Say again please.
2592722|CC|I just said it's going to be a little bad comm until you get into attitude, se we should hold this for a while.
2592730|CDR|Okay. Then when we get there you want OMNI Alfa. Right?
2592736|CC|That's affirmative.
2592739|CDR|Okay. We'll give it to you when it's getting bad.
2592951|CC|America, Houston. If you have somebody handy to the panel, we'd like to take the H2 tank 2, FANs to OFF.
2593003|CDR|Roger. H2 tank 2 FANs, OFF.
2593007|CC|Thank you, Gene.
2593013|CDR|We're in OMNI Delta. We're reading you loud and clear. Do you want us to stay here?
2593019|CC|That's affirm, Gene. That's a good show. It's right - you know, it's right on the line there. It - Delta shows better on the signal strength and Alfa shows better for location. So let's stick with Delta.
2593033|CDR|Okay.
2594712|CC|America, Houston. Please advise us of how you are going to handle the waste stowage vent. Is that open or you going to close it now?
2594722|CMP|It's open right now, but we're going to close it here shortly. Do you think we need it closed now?
2594729|CC|Negative. It's your option. We Just want to know what - in case we get an O2 FLOW HIGH, we might understand what it's from.
2594737|CMP|Oh, I see. Okay, we'll close it after a bit here.
2595322|CC|America, you might be interested in - while you're doing all this hard work up there you might be interested in how some of the Texas football teams have fared. Houston had a toughy today. Cincinnati took them 61 to 17.
2595334|CMP|... Wait a minute.
2595338|LMP|Houston - took who? 61 to 17?
2595341|CC|That's what they tell me. And the other one is those - the biggy up at Dallas right now. The Giants leading the Dallas Cowboys in the third period 21 to 3. 20 to 3; I'll correct that, 20 to 3.
2595355|CMP|Okay. 20 to 3. New York over Dallas, huh?
2595400|CC|That's what it looks like. That's in the third quarter.
2595409|CMP|Okay.
2595619|CC|And, Ron, we're going to do a site handover here in about 4 minutes, and we may lose some lock here
2595627|CMP|Oh, okay. That's all right.
2595631|CC|And how's the post-EVA checklist coming? You chugging along.
2595637|CMP|Oh, chugging along. We've got two guys that have their suits off now.
2595640|CC|Roger.
2595643|CC|Well, they say it always takes longer up there than in the - Got all evening to do it. There's no hurry on it.
2595653|CMP|(Laughter) That's right. Hey. Hope North American doesn't think I was badmouthing their spacecraft down there, because you know - a little bit of blistered paint on it, that doesn't hurt anything. It's still a damn good spacecraft.
2595705|CC|No, I don't think North American even - I think they think it was just great, but I don't know if I'd ever go to Bethpage if I were you.
2595714|CMP|(Laughter) Okay.
2595721|CC|Ron, that was such a great show, I don't think anybody would care. That was just tremendous.
2595727|CMP|(Laughter) Okay, Bob.
2595819|CDR|Okay, Houston. This the CDR backup.
2595820|CC|Roger.
2600516|CDR|Houston, America; the WASTE STOWAGE VENT valve is CLOSED.
2600521|CC|Roger, America.
2601837|CDR|Hello, Houston; this is America. Looks like the repress package is up, and surge tank is back up. Would you like us to turn the cell off and turn the O2 heaters off.
2601850|CC|Geno, EECOM says affirmative to all that.
2601856|LMP|Okay, Gordo. How you doing?
2601858|CC|Pretty good. I saw Ron's stroll around the service module. Looks like he had a ball.
2601908|LMP|Yes, he did.
2602209|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 260 hours 22 minutes. During the time that we've had the air-to-ground lines down for the press briefings, there have been no major events in the mission. Things are continuing to progress smoothly and relatively quietly. At the present time, the crew is in the midst of an eat period, and we have about 18 minutes of accumulated taped conversation, which we'll play back for you at this time.
2603215|CC|America, Houston; over.
2603220|CDR|Go ahead.
2603222|CC|We have ... up the DSE, so we'd like you to go ahead now and do the maneuver listed at 261. Give us the high gain so we can dump it. Over.
2603237|CDR|Okay. Maneuver's coming at you.
2603241|CC|Okay. And for your information, charge number 5 just went off. It was a 3-pounder, and it's jiggling the instruments on the surface there properly.
2603255|LMP|Very good. Any new word on the gravimeter, Gordy?
2603301|CC|I haven't got it yet, Jack. Let me check. Have you heard anything since you asked me the question last night?
2603311|LMP|Well, whatever it was - No, I haven't heard anything.
2603314|CC|Okay. I'll try to get an update.
2603318|LMP|I was thinking of the lunar surface gravimeter, not the traverse. They apparently don't want to talk to me about the traverse gravimeter.
2603330|CC|Okay. We'll try for info on both of them.
2603820|LMP|Okay. Any other new stuff you might have heard or get a hold of, I might be interested in.
2603828|CC|Okay. America, Houston; we need OMNI Charlie, please.
2603833|CDR|Houston.
2603840|CC|America, Houston. OMNI Charlie, please.
2603848|LMP|Hello, Houston. How do you read?
2603851|CC|Okay; loud and clear. Go ahead.
2603855|LMP|Okay. We apparently - in our struggles up here inadvertently hit the WASTE WATER to DUMP and it's back in RELIEF now. That dump is terminated; we have 30 percent waste water.
2603911|CC|Okay.
2603915|LMP|I'm not sure what we had when it started. I just noticed the streaming. I don't think it was on very long.
2603923|CC|Roger.
2604400|PAO|This is Apollo control at 260 hours 44 minutes. We're up live now that completes our tape playback. Apollo 17, 153,321 nautical miles from Earth, And one of the comments you heard from capcom advising the crew that the fifth of the explosive charges left on the lunar surface at Taurus Littrow had gone off as programed. The detonation occurred almost precisely on time at 260 hours 24 minutes. This is a one and a half or rather a three pound explosive charge located one and a half kilometers east of the lunar rover. And, we appeared to get good seismic data here in the control center. At the present time the crew is still in the eat period, and we've had relatively little conservation from them. It also from the flight plan looks as if we'll have relatively quiet evening. Very few things scheduled between now and the time the crew is to begin their rest period at 267 hours or about 6 hours 15 minutes from now.
2604619|CC|America, Houston. We need - we could use the HIGH GAIN now, NARROW and REACQ.
2604822|CC|America Houston high gain's not going to work in NARROW now, wait a while it's in a skin reflection area.
2604835|LMP|Yes, I'm having the same problem there - I noticed the same problem. How's this, leave it in WIDE?
2604843|CC|That will be fine.
2605012|CC|America, Houston. We'd like you to go to REACQ now, wait 30 seconds, and then go to NARROW.
2605101|CDR|Hello, Houston. We're turning the CABIN FAN, OFF, for a while.
2605106|CC|Roger.
2605320|CC|America, Houston. We'd like NARROW beam width.
2605327|LMP|Thanks for timing 30 seconds for me, Gordy. I think that was beyond me.
2605337|CC|You're welcome.
2605431|LMP|Doesn't look like it's going to make it, does it?
2605434|CC|No, it sure doesn't. Stand by 1, and we'll give you an alternate plan here.
2605520|LMP|I'm back in WIDE.
2605530|CC|Roger.
2605727|CC|America, Houston. We're going to have to have the high gain for the dump and also for a little additional work with the HF antennas and the sounder that we're going to read you here in a minute. So, in order to get it, we'd like you to pitch up 20 degrees in your present attitudes; and when you get there, then we ought to be able to reacquire and go NARROW.
2605759|LMP|Okay.
2605825|CC|Once you get the antenna locked on in NARROW it will track back to this attitude, and that's what we'd like you do is come back down to this attitude, once you get the antenna locked on.
2605843|LMP|Okay, Gordy, we got a good lock now.
2605857|CC|Okay. Fine. Well, then go right on back to the program pitch attitude there, and it should hold.
2605909|LMP|In work - in work.
2610015|CC|America, Houston. We'd like to have somebody go to panel 230. I'll give you switches real time, save you writing them all down to get a couple of things cranked up here. Over.
2610038|CDR|Okay. What do you want at 230?
2610041|CC|Okay. Basically what we're going to do is turn the IR ON with the COVER, CLOSED, to keep it warm so you can do that IR, ON, now. And then we're going to put out the HF antennas and listen to HF getting some data on background noise from the Earth. If you'll put HF ANTENNA 2 to EXTEND, we'll give you a cue when to go OFF when it's all the way out. Over.
2610106|CDR|Okay. HF ANTENNA 2 to EXTEND on my MARK.
2610118|CDR|MARK it.
2610120|CC|Roger.
2610402|CC|Okay. We'd like HF ANTENNA 2 to OFF, please.
2610416|CDR|Okay. HF ANTENNA 2 is OFF. It maintained barber pole all the time there. It never went gray until we turned it off.
2610438|CC|Okay. It probably isn't out yet. The reason we had you stop was because the recorder that's watching that broke down, down here. We got to get that back on line.
2610451|CDR|Okay.
2610529|CC|While you're waiting there, I can go over the football scores for the weekend, if you wish.
2610539|LMP|Just a minute. Let's see if we can get Ron on a headset.
2610542|CC|Okay.
2610550|LMP|He's walking - he's walking around here thinking he doesn't have to do anything any more after that EVA, but we'll get him back to work.
2610557|CC|Roger.
2610635|CMP|Okay, Houston. We're ready for those scores now.
2610640|CC|Okay. Just 1 second, Ron. I think we've got another switch for you here.
2610649|CMP|Okay.
2610701|CC|Okay. We'd like to take the sounder HF ANTENNA number 1 switch to EXTEND. We'll let the motor on 2 cool off. We do have the recorder fixed, so we can watch 1 now.
2610713|CMP|Okay. Number 1 is going to EXTEND. 3, 2, 1 -
2610718|CMP|MARK it; barber pole.
2610721|CC|Okay. I've got the whole list of scores here; some of these were yesterday you probably heard of, but I'll just go through them all. San Francisco beat Minnesota, 20 to 17. Miami made it, I guess 14 straight, 16 to 0 over Baltimore. And Buffalo beat Washington, 24 to 7, how about that? Cleveland beat the Jets, 26 to 10. Kansas City beat Atlanta, 17 to 14. Green Bay won over New Orleans, 30 to 20. St. Louis beat Philadelphia in a close one, 24 to 23. Denver beat New England, 45 to 21. Detroit beat the Rams, 34 to 17; and Oakland beat the Bears, 28 to 21. And here's some sad news. The Giants beat Dallas, 23 to 3. And one final score - Cincinnati, 61, Houston, 17. Over.
2610852|LMP|Over. Gordy.
2610854|CDR|Gordo, we - don't have any contact - comment. All three of my teams lost today.
2610902|CC|Roger.
2610935|CMP|Hey, number 1 just went gray on the lunar sounder.
2610941|CC|Okay.
2610953|CMP|And I'll turn the switch to OFF, if you want.
2610957|CC|That's affirmative. OFF on 1 and then on 2, we'd like you to go to. RETRACT for 10 seconds, then put her in EXTEND, and we'll watch it.
2611010|CMP|Okay. RETRACT, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and about 10, I guess. Okay, then I'm going to -
2611029|CMP|EXTEND, now.
2611031|CC|Okay.
2611153|CC|Okay. We'll take number 2 to OFF, please. And we're going to let the motor cool down for 15 minutes so you got at least that long until the next time we bug you.
2611207|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. It's OFF now.
2612904|CC|America, Houston. We'd like to try antenna number 2 again.
2612914|CMP|Okay.
2612915|CC|What we want is you to go to RETRACT for 10 seconds, and then, EXTEND.
2612923|CMP|Okay. Wait 1.
2612930|CMP|Okay, RETRACT. There's 10 seconds. Back to EXTEND.
2612946|CDR|It's going to EXTEND, now.
2612948|CC|Okay, and we're just wondering where you stood on the post-EVA checklist procedures.
2612959|CMP|Well, probably about 75 percent through. What we're doing is stowing all this stuff out here, and then we're going to go back through and check things off.
2613008|CC|Okay. Fine.
2613014|CDR|Gordy, did our little waste-water burn there hurt us or help us?
2613021|CC|I guess we haven't been able to determine yet.
2613031|CC|Okay. HF 2 ANTENNA, OFF.
2613042|CMP|Okay. It was OFF, when you called.
2613045|CC|I guess the motor is - -
2613045|CDR|And, Gordy - - ...
2613047|CC|- - just about stalled out. Doesn't seem to be much - making much - much progress there. Go ahead.
2613055|CDR|I was just going to say we took time out here to grab something to eat, cause it's been a long time between breakfast and lunch so - I will try and do a little inventory here and give you a page and let you know about where it is.
2613108|CC|Okay. We're not intimating there's any hurry. We just were curious.
2613127|CC|Okay, a little more amplification on that antenna. The motor gets hot and it starts - slows down and stops making progress. But each time we make a little more progress to getting it out, and we're almost all the way. We're going to give it another cool-down period. We'll give you a call when we want to try it again.
2613146|CMP|Okay. Sounds good.
2613156|CC|I do have a bunch of short Flight Plan updates, none of which is very close in the future. So any time someone has nothing to do, I'll be glad to read them up.
2613215|CDR|Okay. Let's eat for a little while, Gordy.
2613218|CC|Fine.
2613239|CDR|Is it still sunny and cold back there?
2613246|CC|That's affirmative; it was clear and - were you talking about the Houston weather? Or the SIM-bay weather? The SIM bay's getting cold, also. It's cool, but it was sunny here today. It'll probably be a cold night since it's clear.
2613307|CDR|Okay. Thank you.
2613542|CMP|(laughter)
2613843|CC|America, Houston. We're ready to give another stab on the HF ANTENNA.
2613853|CDR|Okay.
2613855|CMP|You want to go RETRACT first, then for 10 again?
2613857|CC|That's affirm. Ten seconds RETRACT, then EXTEND.
2613902|CMP|Okay. Going to RETRACT and OFF.
2613919|CMP|Okay; going to EXTEND, now.
2613922|CC|Roger.
2614018|CC|Okay, Ron, it's getting out there inch by inch, but we got to back off and hit it again. Go to RETRACT for 10 seconds, and then back to EXTEND.
2614033|CMP|Oh, okay. I went to OFF there for a second, and I'll go to RETRACT now, and then to EXTEND.
2614039|CC|Okay.
2614052|CMP|Okay. I'm going to EXTEND.
2614058|CC|Roger.
2614134|CC|Okay, Ron, go to OFF, and it'll be another 10-minute wait.
2614145|CMP|Okay. We're OFF.
2614312|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 261 hours 43 minutes. The exercise that we've been going through with Ron Evans and the antennas aboard the CSM involve an attempt to extend the second of the two elements of the High-Frequency antenna used in the lunar sounder experiment. Each of these elements is about 34 feet 2 inches long. Both together comprising elements of a single antenna. And, one; of the - one of the elements is extended, and the second is balking at extending. Apparently, due to being cold, and the resistance of pushing the antenna out is heating the motor up. Therefore, we have to turn it on for a period of time until the antenna bogs down and the motor begins to heat, and then turn it off to let the motor cool down. In order to assist in getting it out, and you heard CAPCOM Gordon Fullerton advise the crew that it's going out inches at at time, we're backing off a little bit on it to relieve the tension, and then having the crew go forward, and with each of these steps gaining a few inches on getting the antenna extended. Apollo 17 at this time is 151,300 nautical miles from Earth and traveling at a speed of 3,440 feet per second.
2615255|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 261 hours 53 minutes. We've just had the sixth of the charges, left on the lunar surface by the Apollo 17 crew, detonate, and we're receiving the seismic data in the Control Center. This is the charge designated Number 2, which is a quarter of a pound of explosive, and it had been scheduled to detonate at 261 hours 59 minutes, or about 6 minutes from now. All of the charges we've seen so far have been detonating within about 5 minutes of the nominal or T-zero time.
2615416|PAO|These charges are part of the seismic profiling experiment and provide scientists with information about the subsurface structure in the landing site area.
2615719|PAO|This is Apollo Control. There's one more of the seismic charges to be detonated, charge Number 3, which will be the eighth and final charge, and it's scheduled to be exploded on command from the ground at about 264 hours 10 minutes, roughly 2 hours 10 minutes from now. This charge is the closest of the eight to the roving vehicle located about 65 meters away.
2615828|CDR|Hello, Houston; America. Are you ready to maneuver here to the UV stellar target attitude?
2615844|CC|Stand by; I'll check.
2615852|CC|Okay. I guess everybody is in agreement. Go ahead and high gain should stay on during this maneuver.
2615905|CDR|Okay; we're maneuvering. I hope the Sun comes in the window on this next maneuver.
2615912|CC|Is it getting cool up there?
2615917|CDR|Well, I'm freezing something off.
2615922|CC|Hey, we got a little procedure to warm things up in the cockpit, if you'd like it.
2615928|CDR|We - we heard that earlier, and we'll pass on that right now.
2615939|CC|Was it the one about turning INVERTER 3?
2615946|CDR|No, we didn't hear that one. Why don't you tell us what that one is.
2615950|CC|Okay, Cernan, put INVERTER 3 on MAIN A. That will put some heat load into the system, and then GO to MANUAL on the TEMP IN valve. Go down and adjust the EVAP OUT temperature to 59 degrees - make it 55 degrees, 55 degrees. And that should help warm things up.
2620022|LMP|Okay. We'll let you know if we give that a try and, Gordy, I guess we're ready to copy some of those Flight Plan updates.
2620030|CC|Okay. Fine. We'll keep an eye on the TEMP OUT so that - let you know if the - it's getting away. Let's see - let's start on - Stand by 1. Start on page 375 at 263 hours.
2620100|CDR|Okay.
2620101|CC|Okay. Down at 263:40 where it lists the jets to use for spinup or for damping, rather, we're going to change the jets to be used for damping, since those ones listed didn't work so hot last night. Want to use all of quad Delta. Delta 1, 2, 3, and 4 and Charlie 3 and 4, those six jets in place of the ones listed.
2620145|CDR|Okay.
2620147|CC|Okay, and just to the left of that box delete "IR COVER, CLOSE" and "IR, OFF."
2620158|CDR|Okay.
2620201|CC|I guess - delete the deletion. I just got a call since turn the IR ON. We want to turn it OFF at this time, so leave the IR, OFF, call as is.
2620218|CDR|You want - you want to delete COVER CLOSED, but - but leave IR, OFF, in, huh?
2620222|CC|Yes, the cover is closed, and we want to turn the IR OFF, at that time.
2620237|CDR|Okay.
2620239|CC|Okay. Turn over two pages to 265:20, and make the same jet changes for that PTC rate damping, all of quad Delta and Charlie 3 ana 4.
2620312|CDR|Okay.
2620314|CC|Okay, then turn over 1, 2, 3, 4, several pages - let me find the next one here. It's on 275:10.
2620332|CDR|Okay.
2620333|CC|At 275:10, add "Charge BATT A."
2620344|CDR|Yes, sir.
2620345|CC|Turn the page on 276:25, delete "IR, ON." Then down a few lines at 276:45 delete "IR COVER, OPEN, before dump," and a few more lines at 276:57, delete "Charge BATTERY A."
2620419|CDR|We got them.
2620421|CC|Okay, turn over two pages to 279:05, and change "LMP don biomed harness" to "CDR don biomed harness." 279:30 - change - check CDR to - check LMP, change that to "Check CDR" and then make it "LMP doff biomed harness."
2620505|CDR|Okay. I - I got those, but that's sort of slighting the CMP.
2620514|CC|Okay, we'll consider that. Go on to - -
2620522|CDR|That's harness - that's harnessing the commander.
2620525|CC|(Laughter) Roger. Okay; let's go to 285:10.
2620544|CDR|Okay.
2620544|CC|Okay. Right after the VERB 48 add three steps, number 1 is "RADAR, OFF." Number 2 is "HF ANTENNA to RETRACT (OFF, ON STDN cue)." And the next step is the same for ANTENNA 1. "HF ANTENNA 1, RETRACT, (OFF, ON STDN cue)."
2620633|CDR|Okay. RADAR OFF, HF ANTENNA number 2 RETRACT OFF, on STDN cue and the same for number 1.
2620639|CC|Righto, and then same page, 285:30, "IR COVER, CLOSE." Delete it.
2620650|CDR|Okay.
2620651|CC|Next page, 286:25, "IR COVER, OPEN," delete that. And on the next page, 287:13, "IR COVER, CLOSED" and "IR, OFF," delete both of those. And a little further down the page it says "LMP doff biomed harness." Change that to "CDR doff biomed harness."
2620741|CDR|Okay. I got those.
2620743|CC|Okay; next page is another PTC spinup, same change, "Delta 1, 2, 3, and 4 and Charlie 3 and 4" instead of the listed jets.
2620811|CDR|Okay.
2620812|CC|Okay, and then backtracking for one last one that was just handed to me; go back to 263:53.
2620828|CDR|Okay.
2620829|CC|And the high gain antenna angles; change them from a "-40 and 90" to "20 and 180."
2620841|CDR|Understand; plus 20 and 180.
2620844|CC|That's affirmative and that completes the list.
2620849|CDR|What about 285:30 on the jets?
2620854|CC|I asked the same question, I think. Let me turn to it here. Yes, that one is a - just a short - a short run on it and they just as soon as it wobbles a little so they can leave those jets the same. That's for a UV scan.
2620913|CDR|Okay. Okay.
2621316|CC|Okay, guys, it's time for another try on the HF antenna.
2621324|CDR|Go ahead.
2621325|CC|Okay. HF ANTENNA to RETRACT for 5 seconds, and then EXTEND, please.
2621333|CDR|Okay; for 5 seconds. Going to EXTEND -
2621344|CDR|MARK.
2621433|CC|Hey, good work. It finally made it out. Put it OFF, please.
2621441|CDR|It's OFF.
2621443|CC|Okay. And then got some more steps here, as soon as I find them. Okay. LUNAR SOUNDER OPERATE switch to STANDBY. That's a verify. Then RECORDER, ON.
2621502|CDR|Okay. OPERATE is verified in STANDBY, and RECORDER is ON.
2621508|CDR|MARK.
2621509|CC|Okay, and RADAR switch, ON.
2621521|CDR|RADAR'S ON.
2621525|CC|Okay. RECORDER, OFF, and MODE, HF.
2621534|CDR|RECORDER'S OFF, and the MODE's verified in HF.
2621538|CC|Okay. That does it. We'll let her tick away now for a while. Thank you.
2621557|CDR|I don't believe it. (Music) (Laughter) Got a tissue? (Laughter)
2621617|CMP|Exactly what I was trying not to do, (Laughter) (Music).
2623336|LMP|Houston, 17.
2623340|FLIGHT|17, Houston. This is FLIGHT. Gordo's in the back with his family. Go ahead.
2623349|CMP|Okay. I just wanted to pass on an OPS pressure we owe you. That's 2000 psi.
2623357|FLIGHT|Okay; copy.
2625421|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 262 hours 54 minutes At present time, we are replaying the video tape of today's CSM EVA. Apollo 17 at the present time is 148 900 nautical miles from Earth. This is a quiet period in the Flight Plan for the crew and we have scheduled an exercise period. And following that the crew will be the spacecraft up in the passive thermal control mode, rotating about the longitudinal axis of the spacecraft at about three revolutions per hour. This is done during the trans-lunar and trans-earth phases of the mission to maintain proper thermal equalibrium while the crew is in the sleep period. The crew is scheduled to begin an 8 hour rest period at 267 hours, or about 4 hours from now.
2630303|CC|Hello, America; this is Houston. We're ready for that VERB 49 maneuver as shown in the Flight Plan.
2630312|CMP|Okay. We'll get to it here. Just a second.
2630823|LMP|Say, Gordy; this is Jack.
2630827|CC|Go ahead, Jack.
2630830|LMP|It may be in my imagination, but I thought I had a major blink in the lights of the spacecraft, not just the floodlights but just generally. Did you have any glitch or anything on the traces?
2630843|CC|We'll take a look. Stand by. Give us your best guess on how long ago it was.
2630857|LMP|About - now about 20 seconds, maybe 30.
2630901|CC|Okay.
2631034|PAO|That was Lunar Module Pilot, Jack Schmitt reporting what he described as an apparent blinking of the spacecraft lights, apparently a momentary thing. Schmitt asked if the ground would take a good hard look at the vehicle to see if there had been any sort of a - a glitch, presumably electrical. Spacecraft Environmental and electrical systems engineer, John Aaron is looking at the data now in detail and so far has reported nothing amiss.
2631055|CC|America, Houston. Request the VERB 48 shown in the Flight Plan now.
2631106|CMP|coming up at you.
2631117|CC|And we're - we're rechecking on the EPS data. A first glance shows it solid, but we're not sure if it might have been static during that time. We're taking another look here.
2631130|LMP|Gordy, don't make a big deal out of it. It may have been just my imagination or somebody hitting the floodlight switch, but it - we tried - I - Gene tried that again, and it didn't seem like what I saw. It was just a very quick blink in the lights.
2631144|CC|Okay. We'll - we'll still chase it down.
2631148|LMP|Okay.
2631154|PAO|EECOM, John Aaron reports that the data we have available in Houston at this time, shows nothing - no problems - Nothing wrong with the spacecraft. We are going to double check the data by replaying tapes recorded in the the receiving station at Madrid Spain. And looking in great detail at all of the spacecraft electrical systems to see if there was any sort of a glitch. But, again, at this point, nothing shows up as being amiss.
2631353|PAO|And about 1 hour from now, at 264 hours 10 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, the last of 8 explosive charges placed on the lunar surface by the Apollo 17 crew, will be detonated to produce seismic waves that will assist scientists in understanding the subsurface structure of the - in the area of the Taurus-Littrow site. This charge is 1/8th of a pound. The smallest of the charges, but also the closest to the lunar roving vehicle, it's located about 65 meters from the Rover, and again the expected time of detonation is about 264 hours 10 minutes. Apollo 17 at this time is 148,300 nautical miles from Earth, and we've seen the velocity creeping up ever so slightly, now up to about 3,500 feet per second.
2632302|CC|America, Houston. The state vector up-link scheduled for now won't be necessary.
2632310|CMP|Okay, Gordy. How's the old trajectory looking these days?
2632324|CC|They're still carrying about half foot per second. However, they're not in a period right now of real solid track, I guess, and - so it - it'll take them some more hours to get a really good handle on it.
2632343|CMP|Okay.
2632358|CC|Nobody predicts any more maneuvers until midcourse 7 at the earliest.
2632409|CMP|What would it be at the latest?
2632858|LMP|Hey, Gordy; Jack.
2632903|CC|Go ahead, Jack.
2632907|LMP|I fail to understand why all my friends who used to operate the backroom, even though it's Sunday, why they haven't given you a sort of an interim report on what they - what they think happened at Taurus-Littrow. They usually have those things available.
2632931|CC|Well, I did - you mean, the whole geological summary?
2632938|LMP|Well, just the general thing that they pass around after a - a day or so, I think, is the time frame they work in.
2632948|CC|Yes, there has been such a thing that I think you're referring to. I guess there's a more formal version coming that's supposed to be due out tomorrow morning, but there was a summary, fairly lengthy, on entire science, including the field geology, which I'll try to dig up and maybe read to you if you wish. Over.
2633016|LMP|Well, I don't need a lot. I guess it might be useful to have a general summary maybe tomorrow morning some time, if we have some time in the Flight Plan, of what people have seen up to date on things that we wouldn't normally be familiar with for - in preparation for that press conference tomorrow.
2633042|CC|Okay. Sounds like a good idea. On the - your gravimeter questions, the TGE numbers for the comparison I believe you wanted, between the north - the North Massif and the Sculptured Hills, just aren't available. The whole TGE team took their data and - and left town, evidently. And we have been unable to come up with any good numbers on that question. The lunar surface gravimeter - Okay, break break here. We need a VERB 48 load as shown, and then - -
2633128|LMP|It's already in, Gordy.
2633130|CC|Oh, okay. So you can go ahead and do the maneuver then. On the LSG, still no positive success. They've sent just about all the commands that it can take with no luck at leveling the beam, and so they've decided to fall back and the whole team is regrouping to consider further course of action. They've turned off the command system to it until some time tomorrow when they'll try again, evidently, with whatever they come up with in their conference. Over.
2633218|LMP|Okay. We're certainly pulling for them, of course.
2633230|CC|Roger.
2633234|LMP|Gordy, do I have it straight, that it, apparently, it's a problem just in the leveling commands, or is it - it is receiving other commands, is that correct?
2633253|CC|That's the impression I have. I hate to - to say yes certainly. My impression is that it just won't - won't level. It - it will accept commands, but the beam will just not level for a - a reason that they don't fully understand.
2633323|LMP|Okay. Does that mean that you might - Maybe you could ask Bob when you see him or something - does that mean the beam is not free, or is not level?
2633337|CC|As I understand it - Stand by 1.
2633445|CC|Jack, I got a quick agricultural explanation of the problem. (Laughter) Evidently, it's the two plates between which the beam itself is suspended are adjustable, so that - by ground command, so that by driving these plates back and forth, they try to center the beam between them. And then the - the data is initiated when the beam vibrates between the plates, it changes capacitance, or at least that's the general principle. And the problem is that by drive, they can command the plates back and forth and stop the stop, but they cannot get the beam to leave - leave one of the plates. It just is hung up against one plate, and this would - could be caused by one of the wires that's suspended - sort of hang the beam, pendulum-fashion, being broken so that it has cockeyed off to one side. I guess that's the best guess as to the malfunction at the moment. It's presently in use as a seismometer returning data in that mode, but useless in its primary intended data-taking mode. Over.
2633612|LMP|Right. Did they see the beam leave the plates at all as I shook it there near the last of our third EVA?
2633631|CC|I guess the answer to that is "no." They saw you jostling it around and could tell where you were from the data but have no evidence that the beam ever moved from the one plate.
2633705|LMP|Is there any possibility that the telemetry is giving them a false indication of not leveling - or not centering, I guess, would be a better word?
2633725|CC|Stand by.
2633743|CC|No, Jack. Evidently, they've eliminated that possibility. They're certain it's a problem - a mechanical problem.
2633752|LMP|Okay.
2633859|CC|Jack, reference your - the blink you noticed or possibly noticed - we, looking at the data, see about 30 seconds prior to the time we think you mentioned that it happened but that's close to the time frame, I guess, a 1 or 2 amp oscillation in the main B voltage or current. And it only lasted for one or two data cycles, or like 0.1 or 0.2 of a second is all. We would like to know, though, approximately what setting all the floodlights are at right now.
2633949|CDR|LEB axe full BRIGHT, and the left hand are about three-quarters, right hand's about three-quarters. Jack's the only one who saw that. We didn't - Ron and I didn't see anything on that one, so if it - if it happened, it was awful quick.
2634004|CC|Okay.
2634126|CC|America, we'd like H2 tanks - H2 tank 1 FANS ON, please.
2634139|CDR|They're ON, Gordy.
2634142|CC|Okay.
2634142|CDR|And we're on a damping mode with Delta 1 through 4, and C 3 and 4.
2634148|CC|Roger, Gene.
2634318|CC|Okay, America. We've got another change to the changes. (Laughter) We'd like you to leave the IR on until our cue here.
2634333|CDR|Okay. I'll change my change to my change.
2634341|CC|Rog.
2635211|CC|America, Houston. The rates look good. We're ready to spin it up.
2635222|LMP|Okay.
2641540|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 264 hours 15 minutes. The ALSEP staff support room here in Mission Control reports that the last of eight seismic charges left on the lunar surface by the Apollo 17 crew has detonated and a charge went off at 264 hours 14 minutes or about 4 minutes later than the nominal time of 264 hours 10 minutes and within the normal range that we've seen for the other seven charges of about 5 minutes either side of the planned time. This charge was a 1/8th pound charge located about 65 meters from the Lunar Roving Vehicle, the charge that was closest to the landing site of Apollo 17. These charges are part of the Lunar Seismic Profiling Experiment - the seismic waves produced by the explosions provide information that scientists can use in interpreting the sub-surface structure in the area of the landing site.
2641850|LMP|Houston, 17.
2641855|CC|Okay; go ahead.
2641859|LMP|Hey, I was just wondering how the high gain's working out for you?
2641904|CC|Looking good, Jack.
2641908|LMP|Okay.
2642120|CC|Jack, Houston. Over,
2642125|LMP|Go ahead.
2642128|CC|The high gain is holding on there, but we think we can improve our - the time we can hold on to narrow beam width a little bit if you'd tweak it to PITCH, plus 15, and YAW, plus 185, please.
2642155|LMP|Gordy, you said plus 15?
2642158|CC|Affirmative. Plus 15 and a plus 185.
2642203|LMP|Okay.
2642406|CDR|Gordy, the canister's changed.
2642409|CC|Thank you.
2642808|CDR|I guess you're looking at the orange light, too, huh?
2642813|CC|That's affirmative.
2642910|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The orange light that Jack Schmitt was referring to is a gimbal warning light - one of the caution and warning system lights that, in this case, indicates the attitude of the spacecraft approaching gimbal lock. However, this is of no concern. The passive thermal control attitude that the spacecraft is in was expected to bring them close enough to that limit to trigger the light, but will not cause any problems. The spacecraft at this time is in the passive thermal control mode, rotating about it's longitudinal axis at the rate of about 3 revolutions per hour to distribute the heating and cooling effects of sunlight on one side and the heatsink of space on the other, and produce uniform heating and cooling within the spacecraft structure.
2643702|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 264 hours 37 minutes. About an hour and a half ago Jack Schmitt reported what appeared to him as a transitory blink of the spacecraft lights. He asked if we'd seen anything in the telemetry that indicated any sort of a glitch or a problem in the spacecraft electrical system. At that time the EECOM looked at his telemetry displays and said everything appeared to be normal, but to be doubly sure, we had the data replayed from the receiving site at Madrid where it had been picked up from the spacecraft and looked at the data second by second. Aaron has completed that review, John Aaron, the EECOM, and reports that he saw nothing abnormal during the period of time in question. However, there were a couple of instances where the spacecraft current levels increased or spiked, as they say, by about an amp or two, but this is an increase of 1 or 2 amps out of a total of 78 to 80 some amperes being drawn by the spacecraft at this time, and is not considered abnormal. Gene Cernan reported after Schmitt asked the question that neither he nor Command Module Pilot, Ron Evans had seen the blink in lights that Jack Schmitt reported. Schmitt also allowed as how it may have been a - a figment of his imagination. There is, as we say, no - no explanation for the apparent blink in lights. We see nothing here on the ground that indicates anything abnormal in the spacecraft. Crew also reported that the spacecraft cabin was a bit on the chilly side and we read to them a procedure to increase the cabin temperature. We don't have a direct reading of cabin temperature - we can deduce indirectly what that temperature would be from air inlet temperatures which generally read lower than the cabin temperature itself. The EECOM estimates that the temperature in the cabin has been running somewhere between 68 to 70 degrees - probably in the high sixties, and hopefully beginning to come up a bit now. At the present time Apollo 17 is 145,300 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a speed of 3,600 feet per second now. The crew is scheduled to begin a sleep period at about 267 hours. They've completed the exercise period. Ron Evans, who is on the bio-medical sensors, was exercising and the surgeon reported seeing the - seeing his heart rate rise, indicating that he was exercising.
2644123|PAO|And at this time the surgeon reports Lunar Module Pilot, Jack Schmitt, is exercising as indicated by a rise in his heart rate.
2645126|CMP|(Music) Hey, Houston; America.
2645136|CC|Go ahead, Captain.
2645141|CMP|Okay, Gordo. I took my comm carrier apart - or, you know, cut this little cloth covering that goes from the plug on up to the headset, what have you. And sure enough, there's two little broken wires in there; and the next one is a little bit - the next one to it is a little bit loose, also. But I found a little piece of metal, and I bent it to the - conform to the shape of the wire and I've got it taped up real tight right now. And I'm going to see if it works for a while - make sure it doesn't cut in or out, you know, or something like that.
2645228|CC|Okay; good luck.
2645232|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. Of course, I still have the lightweight headset too. I'd just as soon wear the comm carrier for the reentry, if possible.
2645243|CC|Roger. Say, we've investigated a little more on that possible spike that - or glitch that Jack thought he might of seen. And we mentioned, I think, in response to that, about a 1 or 2 amp jump. Well, looking further, we see those all along; and we think they're probably due to minimum-impulse jet firings. We're trying to correlate that data. But the conclusion, right now, is that we really don't see anything on the data to support what Jack might have seen.
2645322|CMP|Okay, mighty fine. We - just wanted to - you know, in case there was something there - wanted to make sure you all took a look at it.
2645334|CC|You bet.
2645346|CMP|Yes. Knobby. Okay, Knobby, where are you? Hey, I can see a few stars out there on this side of the window.
2645421|CMP|Can't see anything there. That's right behind the - By gosh, there it is, though.
2645426|LMP|Houston, 17.
2645429|CC|Go ahead.
2645432|LMP|Gordy, this is Jack. is anybody watching my heart rate - heart rate over the last 15 minutes or so?
2645440|CC|That's affirmative. We have.
2645445|LMP|What - what did I peak out at?
2645454|CC|You peaked at 105, Jack.
2645459|LMP|Hummm, okay.
2645511|CMP|Well, what do you know. You got to be quick. Just disappeared behind the trunion limits.
2645551|CMP|No, not at all, Jack. Go ahead. Jack's going to stir the cryos again - not stir them but - de-stratify them. 36 Vega. Ahh, that Vega is nothing but a bear. (Laughter)
2645736|CMP|That really shakes the spacecraft, Jack. You can see it when you sit there marking on a star and it just shakes it back and forth. (Laughter) That's all right; no problem. No, no. That's what I say, no problem. No angle difference from 0.1; that wasn't too bad. Number 1 and 36. You got them down? Okay, Houston, and we'll torque at - if you're all set, anyhow.
2645833|CC|Yes, we're all set.
2645836|CMP|Okay, about 58:45.
2645841|CC|Okay. And then, when you do that, we want you to stop the PTC right now. But we want you to use the jet configuration - configuration we used to start at - That's - all of quad Delta and Charlie 3 and 4, rather than the jets listed in the Flight Plan. Over.
2645909|CMP|Okay.
2645920|CC|And while we are mentioning jet configurations, that jet configuration is - this is another change to a change to a change, and we're sorry about this. But we want you to use those jets, all of Delta and Charlie 3 and 4, for every stop and start of PTC from here on out, all the way through the final PTC exit, just prior to midcourse 7, which is shown in the Flight Plan - and - and the way we want it, using coupled jets for that final one. But use Delta 1 through 4, and Charlie 3 and 4 from here on out for going in and out of PTC. And I can read you all the time so that applies to - if you can just remember it, that will save some writing. Your choice. Over.
2650018|CMP|I'll write it down here in the spacecraft somewhere.
2650031|CMP|Put it on the back here. Yes.
2650100|CDR|Gordy, you want Delta 1, 2, 3, and 4, and Charlie 3 and 4 for damping. And you want Bravo 2 and Delta 2 for spinup, as the Flight Plan says?
2650111|CC|That's affirmative. And the damping is for both entry and exit of PTC from here on out, except that final one, which is coupled just prior to midcourse 7.
2650125|CMP|Okay.
2650135|CC|And you don't need to wait until roll of 14. You can go ahead and stop it right now. We'd prefer it that way, as a matter of fact. Over.
2650148|CDR|Okay.
2650452|CDR|Is that a CDU glitch there, Gordy? We - Huh? We sure did. Hello, Houston, you read America?
2650507|CC|Yes. I was just trying to get an answer for you. Yes, it looks, at first glance, like maybe we saw one. Stand by. I'll get a better update.
2650523|LMP|Gordy, why don't you give me the best OMNI?
2650530|CC|OMNI Delta is the best right at the moment.
2650543|LMP|Well, we'll hang on to you here as we go. You're just on the verge of dropping out, but we'll stay with you on the high gain.
2650600|CDR|Yes, Gordy, our ball - our ball - let's see - reads about 256 ROLL, and YAW - and PITCH is 2 - about 227, and YAW is about 42 degrees.
2650624|CC|Okay.
2650643|CC|Geno, evidently you definitely had a CDU glitch. We're trying to come up with an attitude that you can fly to on the ball as it stands right now in SCS. Stand by.
2650707|CMP|Houston, both the SCS and the IMU ball are okay, I think. They're both the same. Well, they're almost - yes, except for the GDC - except for the GDC drift, they're both the same. So the error is in the NOUN 20s in the computer.
2650738|CC|Stand by.
2650809|CC|Ron, does the - does the GDC and the IMU attitude agree right now?
2650819|CMP|Yes, they do. They agree, you know, except for the 2 or 3 degrees of GDC drift is all.
2650826|CC|Roger.
2650841|CMP|And there's our NOUN 20s on the computer now.
2650845|CC|Roger.
2650914|CC|America, Houston. What we'd like you to do is - Were those ball angles you read 256, 04 - well, let's see - get the right order - 256, 227, and 042 - Are those still about where you are?
2650932|CMP|Yes, that's affirm.
2650937|CC|Okay. We're going to try to compute a - an attitude that can get us - to high gain so we have a little more visibility into the system. That's our problem right now.
2650950|CMP|(Laughter) Okay.
2651256|CC|America, Houston. What we'd like you to do is roll 180 degrees to about 076 roll attitude.
2651315|CMP|Okay, we'll roll her back to 076.
2651320|CC|Okay. Then once you get there, the HIGH GAIN angle should be a PITCH of minus 50; and YAW, 205. Over.
2651331|CMP|Minus 50 and 205. Okay.
2651334|CDR|We're on the way, Gordy.
2651336|CC|Okeydoke.
2651339|CDR|You might check. I was loading NOUN 22. And you might just doublecheck and see what you saw down there and make sure I wasn't loading NOUN 20.
2651353|CC|Okay, good call; we'll do that.
2651413|CC|Can you give us best OMNI as you roll around?
2651421|CMP|Okay, we'll try.
2651427|CDR|Okay, it's OMNI Delta now.
2651429|CC|Roger. Loud and clear.
2651558|LMP|Houston, I doubt if it's a problem, but the UV cover's still open.
2651606|CC|Roger, Jack.
2651623|CC|Okay, we'd like you to zero the CDUs now.
2651641|LMP|Looks about right.
2651659|CDR|Looks good, Gordy. It matches the ball.
2651702|CC|Roger. We see that. We're getting high bit rate now, by the way, also.
2651709|CDR|I don't know. You can track it down, but I called up NOUN 20 to check the roll angles, and it was not what we were using in the book here, of 14 degrees. And I very easily could have - could have loaded 20 instead of 22.
2651729|CC|Okay. We'll sure track that one down.
2651729|CDR|... feel a lot better about it, if that were the case.
2651754|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 265 hours 18 minutes. The CDU glitch that is being discussed, refers to a small piece of - refers to a small piece of erroneous information which appears to have gotten through the CDU. The CDU being the Coupling Data Unit, which is a black box that receives information from various measuring devices on the spacecraft, and converts them to a form that is meaningful to the computer. The CDU or Coupling Data Unit in question, is one that handles this transfer of information from a measuring device, in this case the inertial measurement unit, to the computer. The indications that we've gotten so far from the checks run and the telemetry data that we've looked at, do not show any problem. The essential thing is to understand what the nature of the erroneous information that was fed through this CDU to the computer might be. It's very conceivable that there will be a ready explanation for an erroneous bit of information getting through. If, in fact, there is some problem, and the CDU can be expected to continue feeding erroneous information to the computer, there is a program that can be loaded into the erasable memory of the computer which in effect, allows it to question the information that's fed through and to in effect, make a determination as to whether that information is reasonable. If it's not reasonable, the computer then throws it out. And we now have high bit rate data from the spacecraft so we'll be able to look in great detail at this particular aspect of the guidance system.
2652033|CC|America, we're ready now for you to proceed on per Flight Plan with the VERB 49 to the sleep PTC attitude. We have not had a chance to go back over the data, but we'll give you a call as soon as we get a chance to check it. Over.
2652051|CDR|Okay, Gordy. One other interesting thing while we went back and looked at NOUN 22 after the glitch. We still had the NOUN 22 angles I had loaded for the previous VERB 49 at 263:40, which either - even makes me feel more like I did not load 22 on this next time around.
2652116|CC|Yes, it sounds - it sounds like we might have the problem nailed down, but we'll doublecheck that.
2652130|CDR|This is a gross admission, if that's the case; but I'd rather have it that way.
2652136|CC|We won't hold it against you.
2652213|CC|America, Houston. Why don't you hold the PRO on - on this VERB 49 until we have a chance to check and see if we're going to a gimble lock problem.
2652226|CDR|Okay.
2652248|CDR|Gordy, can I use the roll we got, 142? I'll stand by until you check that gimbal lock out.
2652308|CC|Stand by, we're checking here. Your answer is negative, Geno. The present roll - the maneuver should - it shows on our computer, you'll go to gimbal lock. So suggest you go to 14 and then start to maneuver. ... Over.
2652339|CDR|Okay.
2652906|CC|America, Houston. Can you give us AUTO and NARROW on the HIGH GAIN? Present angles are okay.
2652932|LMP|Okay, Houston. The computer knows where the stars are anyhow.
2652939|CC|Okay. We'd like AUTO and NARROW, and make sure you've selected HIGH GAIN also.
2653008|CDR|Wise ... wise guy. Works every time, doesn't it?
2653031|CC|Roger.
2653401|CC|Well, America, the final evidence is in, and we're all putting our EMP books back on the shelf. We played it back and we see a VERB 21 NOUN 20, which is what did it - and a 22 and 23 -
2653419|CDR|Okay, I've been sitting here thinking about it. Yes, I had - and also the glitch occurred when I did the final ENTER, so - plus we had the two-axes glitch and a number of things. I'm - I'm glad you confirmed that. Makes me feel better.
2653438|LMP|We were discussing whether or not you needed an EMP or not.
2653447|CC|Well, there must be one for the situation.
2653542|CDR|Getting a little quiet up here anyway, Gordy. That one sure snapped us out, though.
2653549|CC|Us also.
2653601|CDR|Hey, how far are we from home?
2653606|CC|Well, I can give it to you in hours from entry interface right away - 38 hours 42 minutes and 4 seconds. And in miles, you're 143,500.
2653629|CDR|Okay, thank you.
2653635|CC|Picking up speed all the way.
2653930|CC|America, Houston. Over.
2653935|CDR|Go ahead, Gordo.
2653937|CC|I've been talking to Don Beaty and Dick Kruse and looking over a transcript of - of a science press conference we edited up. It was kind of ragged but possibly interesting summary of the science as it stands now. In response to your question of - of items that might help you prepare for tomorrow's press conference, I can come with you with those words any time you wish.
2654014|CDR|... you can come up with them now.
2654017|CC|Okay. Let's start with the - the LSPE. All eight charges have now been exploded, and they were all on schedule and produced excellent signals. These data were used in conjunction with the ascent stage lift-off and also its impact data, which should give us an excellent picture of the geologic structure of the outer 3 kilometers of the Moon. This little summary I'm reading right now is - was written by Joel Watkins. The geophone array is functioning beautifully and and we're already talking about its potential in a listening mode for study of meteorite impact frequency. We still don't have precise EP locations from Ray Batson, so the following interpretation will almost certainly be changed when we get better data and field tapes, which we will use to refine our arrival times. Bearing the above in mind, my preliminary interpretation is as follows. The low-velocity layer seems to be thicker and higher in velocity than at either Apollo 14 or 16 sites. I think this may mean that the low-velocity layer here includes dark mantle material as well as the regolith. Details of the higher velocity substrate are fuzzy, but velocities increase with depth in a way which would be consistent with a thick accumulation of lava flows. This probably represents the subfloor material. And he concludes by saying, "You guys did a great job, see you after splash." On the same subject, Dr. Kovach went a little further, and he just recently admits to seeing evidence of two high-velocity layers, especially after the 6-pound charge was fired, that - that evidence showed up. He also mentions in - mentioned in his press conference yesterday that the - the data point allowed by the - the ascent-stage impact was - was very important - the fact that they - they got it in about 9 kilometers away and the - that data is right in a critical range where - where they see a big change in the - the percentage of - velocity change. I'm getting kind of balled up here in the words, but that data is very important because it's in - where the steep gradient of velocity change occurs. On looking through here, I guess, in - in summary, I'll read a couple of sentences again out of the press conference. We do find evidence of lunar crust as we did in the past, but we may have to thin it considerably. We may have, in fact, have to thin it as much as to 25 kilometers instead of 60 - that they believed it was up until now. And they're thinking they may have to lower the velocity of seismic ways - waves in the mantle, which, I guess, at last guess was around 9 kilometers per second. Now it's looking more like 7-5, and the crustal velocity is probably as low as 6.3 kilometers per second. Okay, yes. That was - that last data was really from Dr. Latham, and he was interpreting that data mainly from the S-IVB impact, reading from some of the other seismic sites. Any questions on that? I realize that this is pretty ragged. Over.
2654517|LMP|Oh, that's - that's great, Gordy. Did Kovach indicate his tentative depth for the second high-velocity layer?
2654532|CC|No. As far as the information we have here, he's just - no, I don't see any - the only thing I can see is he mentions we're getting a depth sample down to 3 to 4 kilometers, but that was before all the charges had gone off. So I think, as I say, he just doesn't really state that yet.
2654558|LMP|Yes, it's a little early. Okay, good. Sounds like what we saw in the field to a certain extent.
2654610|CC|Okay. On the heat flow, it's continuing to work perfectly. It's stabilizing out and, at the present time, they show about a degree centigrade per meter gradient. Apollo 15 is stabilized at about 1.8, and it looks like the 17 site's headed for about the same, which gives consistent data for the two sites. It looks like that's what is going to result when it's reached its final equilibrium. And so that - if you call that - those two sites typical of the Moon, then that leads one to the following conclusions; that that data requires that there be a total greater abundance of radioactive isotopes in the Moon as compared to the Earth, so there would be an implication here for a fundamental difference in the composition between the two. And the higher number of isotopes would in turn require that they be located very near the surface, implying substantial differentiation of the material, at least compositionally or stratisfactionally [sic]. It's not necessary that it had have to be stratified. It was only required that it be stratified in most of - in that most of the isotopes be concentrated in the upper layers of the Moon. I guess that's about what we've got on the heat flow at the present time. Over.
2654805|LMP|Gordy, does he indicate where his minimum temperature lay - zone is now at the site?
2654818|CC|Stand by. Let me look through here.
2654826|LMP|I think you mentioned something the other night about - I thought you said 2-1/2 meters, but I'm not sure.
2654856|CC|Let me just read it straight off here. There is some words to that effect, but it doesn't sound like 2-1/2 meters. At a large scale - let's see, he's describing a viewgraph here - the surface temperature at the time of this sample was 360 degrees Kelvin. At a depth of about 15 centimeters, it had dropped to 280. At about 65 centimeters, the temperature drops to 254, and that's the lowest temperature we see. Below that depth, the temperature begins to increase again, and it's 257 at the bottom of the probes. Over.
2654941|LMP|Where was the 254 again?
2654943|CC|At 65 centimeters below the surface.
2654948|LMP|Okay. That's about the same, I think, as 15. Very good. Some of our double cores will get that deep.
2654958|CC|Roger. Okay, the TGE has produced some - fair amount of excitement around here - and interest. The instrument really worked beautifully. It had some baro switches that turned it on for temperature control - right aft - right during lift-off - and so it had 3 days to stabilize before you got to Taurus-Littrow. And on landing, the bias measurement showed that the bias shift was extremely small, so they feel that they had a very accurate reading on all the readings. And I mentioned the other night that the number they got for the gravity field at the landing site should allow them to actually revise the value for the radius of the Moon at the landing site. But then you asked me about some of the variations in reading around the valley there. Well, it turns out that - if you call the landing site zero on the scale of milli-gals and then take the differences from the landing site, over at the South Massif, you have a minus 36; in other words, a lesser amount of gravity. And all these numbers, by the way, are corrected only for elevation, and there are some more sophisticated corrections to - to be put on them. But the - with - correcting for elevation, you have a 36-milligal negative anomaly at the South Massif. And the number at the North Massif was a minus 26. And there is very little difference, within a milligal or so, between the North Massif and the Sculptured Hills site. But you can see that there's a significant difference between the landing site and the foothills on both sides. The Shorty Crater showed a slight positive anomaly compared to the landing site, but it's less than a milligal, which is sort of - you start to think "Well, that means a localized volcanic center," but it's - nobody's really going out that far on a limb. The - they were especially appreciative of the 2A stop, which was - let's see - well, it verified the extremely sharp gradient of the anomalous condition from the foothills as you go back into the valley. The 2A stop - I'm trying to find the number here - Okay, went from minus 36 at Station 2 to a minus 29 at 2A, so it's - it really changes quickly as you get away from the - the mountains. Okay, he summar - summarized his feelings by saying that "the negative gravity anomalies which were measured right at the South Massif and the North Massif clearly indicate that the valley is filled with a higher density of material than the material which makes up the massif so that if the material underlying the floor at Taurus-Littrow - say, is basaltic in composition and has a density of about 3, the material which makes up the massif has a substantially lower density." He goes on to say that we're not sure exactly what the density difference is, but if it's as large as 20 percent difference, then the material in the floor of the valley and the - well, the thickness of the high-density material in the valley has to be on the order of about 1-1/2 kilometers thick. So that's a - I guess that's a minimum thickness, assuming the greatest difference in densities.
2655448|LMP|That's very interesting, Gordy.
2655455|CC|Yes. They're really - everything is really tied in the original theories on the structure and makeup of the valley. Everything seems to be falling right in there, and that's what has - has the whole crowd of scientists around here really smiling. Let's see - let me find out what's next here. Okay. It was Strangway's turn next, and he didn't have any results to present, of course, because he's got to get the tape back first, really. However, the orbital sounder - the command module sounder - when they made the pass across the site with the transmitter on - No, I got it backwards. When it was in a listening mode, listening to the ground transmitter's signals, they found that the signal was in exactly the frequency range that it was supposed to be, and they - they picked up the - exactly the right sequence rate, once every 0.8 second. And when they calculated the power levels, that we were putting out just exactly the 1 watt that we were expected to put out. So that - that everything looks good as far as the operation of the transmitter, and without going into all the details which you know as well as I do about the thermal problems on the receiver, they're still - well, he sums it up, we have no reason yet to be sweating it too badly. They're very hopeful that when the tape gets back, we'll have good data on at least some of the legs, and they're - they're waiting for you to bring it to them. Dick Kruse is here, and he mentioned that all your pains, Geno, in brushing dust off of it probably saved the day. If it's there, it was just due to that, that it did work, because it was really on the ragged edge here.
2655733|CC|About what's left, I think - is the field geology interpretation. And what I've got and can get tonight because there's no one really around here from the geology team at this time - it's about 11 o'clock at night - is so rambling that I'm not going to bother to read it to you. But I will leave a request so that when Parker get you up in the morning, maybe he can summarize that or answer any questions in that area that you might have. Over.
2655807|LMP|Okay, Gordy. Thank you very much.
2655813|CC|No trouble at all.
2655846|CMP|Hey, Gordy. Everything under control at the homefront?
2655853|CC|Yes, Ron. As a matter of fact, talked to Jan and, well, her words to summarize the - the whole show that you put on this afternoon was "out of this world," which is, I guess, a pretty good way to put it. Jon and Jaime were speechless when you waved and called hello to them. And Jan closed by saying that you - you're going to have to hurry home and help rebuild the wall that was broken out by the huge mob of people that were in your house this afternoon during the EVA. Over.
2655935|CMP|Well, that's okay. We like a lot of friends, and I'm glad everybody enjoyed it and pass my love on - to everyone.
2655945|CC|Okay, will do.
2660002|CDR|What about the other side of the tracks, Gordy? Got any words from over there?
2660009|CC|Hey - I haven't really talked to anyone in the other two families today. So I'm sure that everything is fine or we would have heard it, but I'll try to get a last-minute update on that before you hit the sack.
2660029|CDR|Okay, thank you.
2660324|LMP|Gordy, this is Jack.
2660327|CC|Go ahead, Jack.
2660331|LMP|Did you have a table there of the various gravity readings, and if so, what did we get at Van Serg? in your - relative to - to the landing site - the landing point?
2660345|CC|No, Jack. I don't have it. I'll ask, but I think the ones I gave you, the four places, Shorty, North, South, and Sculptured Hills, are all we got. But I'll check.
2660406|LMP|Okay.
2660441|CC|America, Houston. The rates look good now. You're clear to spin it up.
2660453|CMP|Okay.
2660610|CDR|Gordy, I'm sorry. I'm going to move.
2660631|CDR|Boy, this isn't my day. I'll give you the damping again.
2660635|CC|Okay, fine.
2661113|CC|17, Houston. We're ready for spinup.
2661153|CC|17, Houston. We're ready for spinup.
2661205|CDR|Gordy couldn't hack it any longer, huh?
2661210|CC|He's getting some more news for you.
2661215|CDR|Okay, we'll try and get it right this time.
2661311|CDR|I think I got it for you this time.
2661449|CMP|Houston, America. Are you ready for REACQ and NARROW on the HIGH GAIN?
2661455|CC|That's affirm.
2661501|CMP|Okay, you have it. REACQ and NARROW.
2661722|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 266 hours 17 minutes. The crew at the present time is establishing the spacecraft in its passive thermal control mode. This is rotating at about 3 revolutions per hour for thermal control which means that they're preparing to get some sleep. Sleep period is scheduled to begin at 267 hours and the PTC or passive thermal control mode is the normal set up for the spacecraft to maintain thermal equalibrium during a sleep period. The crew had reported a possible glitch as they referred to it with the CDU or coupling data unit about an hour ago at 265 hours 7 minutes. We looked in great detail at the telemetry data and replayed data from the time when this glitch occured, and by looking at the data, have confirmed that there is no problem with the coupling data unit, and the guidance and navigation system which it forms a part of. To summarize the sequence of events, Gene Cernan was in the process of loading numbers into the spacecraft computer, telling it to maneuver to the proper attitude for passive thermal control, when he noticed that his eight-ball attitude indicator and his computer attitude readout disagreed. These 2 readouts if everything is as it should be, should be in very close agreement. Noting disagreement there, he advised that there was a possible glitch in the CDU or coupling data unit which feeds information from the inertial measurement unit to the computer. The glitch being possibly that the CDU was feeding erroneous information to the computer. If this was in fact the case, the computer knowledge of the spacecraft attitude would become impaired. It would have been possible to work around this sort of problem if it were a transient problem. This would have been done by loading a program into the computer erasable memory which in effect would tell the computer to disregard imputs which were unlikely or unreasonable. As it turned out, Gene Cernan came up with the explanation for the glitch. He suggested that he may have loaded the incorrect numbers into the computer when he was asking the - or telling the computer to maneuver to a new attitude. Rather than telling the computer to maneuver to a new attitude, by punching in the wrong numbers, he in effect told it - that's it's attitude numbers were incorrect and that it should load a new set of attitude numbers which the computer proceeded to do. And at the same time, the next time that he looked at and compared the eight-ball with the computer, he of course, found that they didn't agree. We were able to confirm that this in fact had happened by replaying data, looking at the numbers that were fed into the computer second by second and sure enough just as Cernan had suggested, a wrong series of numbers had been inadvertently loaded. The computer had done precicely what it was told to do and the indication of an error from the coupling data units was displayed. Making a long story short, the coupling data units are functioning precisely as they should and there's no problem with the guidance aid navigation system. Cernan, I'm sure, a bit chragrived at a procedurel error but as with everyone on the ground, relieved that a potentially significant problem turned out to be no problem at all.
2663225|CC|America, Houston. We'd like to verify the present setting of the high gain knobs. We want minus 40 and a plus 90.
2663246|LMP|Gordy, that's verified.
2663249|CC|Okay, thank you. I - I have a number of sort of cleanup items before going to bed that I can give you any time.
2663303|LMP|Why don't you go ahead?
2663305|CC|Okay. We'll be calling you for the IR, OFF, before you go to sleep. Want to leave it ON right up to the last minute, I guess. Let me see if we can do this next one. Okay. Why don't you just go ahead and do this one? FANs for sleep - number 1, OFF, and 3 in AUTO.
2663337|LMP|Okay, we got that.
2663339|CC|And there'll be no cryo stir necessary. You can leave the OPTICs power switch ON, which will increase the heat input and keep it a little bit warmer in there. You won't have to turn that off per the presleep checklist, if you don't wish to. We are going to change the biomed - -
2663359|LMP|Okay.
2663359|CC|- - tomorrow, in deference to the CDRs intimated request anyway, and let the CMP take the next shift where in the Flight Plan it now calls for the CDR. It was really our mistake on the original change. I guess there's no need to call all those detailed Flight Plan changes now unless you want to copy them. A reminder also, prior to going to sleep, to bump the cabin up to 5.7 with the OPS to start getting the gas out of the OPS. And I checked with the remaining two homefronts, Jack. Your - I talked to your mother and sister. Everybody's fine there, and they watched the top of your head a little bit this afternoon on the EVA. They're looking forward to seeing you tomorrow on the press conference and back on Earth shortly thereafter. I got one from Nassau Bay, too, if the commander's listening.
2663518|CDR|He's listening.
2663520|CC|Okay, Gene. Your mother and family have arrived. They - in fact, they just walked in from a party with Barbara. They all wish you to hurry home and send their love. Over.
2663926|LMP|Houston, how do you read 17?
2663929|CC|Okay, 17. Loud and clear now. How me?
2663933|LMP|You're loud and clear.
2663936|CC|Okay. Did you - did you get the homefront update for the commander?
2663942|CDR|Yes, I got it, Gordy, and that's great news and news I wanted to hear, and you can return my love to them for me if you would.
2663950|CC|Sure will. That completes our list of goodies with the exception of the normal presleep stuff, and we'll be standing by for that from you.
2664009|LMP|Okay. And you can tell the Arizona people, next time you talk to them, I tried to get more of myself out in that television picture but the CMP saw to it that my umbilical was limited in its length.
2664025|CC|Okay.
2664737|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 266 hours 47 minutes. Flight Contro1 teams are in the midst of a handover here in the Control Room. Flight Director, Chuck Lewis in the white team being relieved by Flight Director, Pete Frank in the orange team. There will be no change of shift news conference - no change of shift news conference.
2664840|PAO|The CAPCOM on this shift will be Bob Parker now relieving Gordon Fullerton.
2665817|CC|America, Houston. I'll turn you over to the crew astrologer here. Pleasant dreams.
2665825|LMP|Thank you, Gordy. And we enjoyed the day with you. See you tomorrow.
2665847|LMP|Well, so much for that handover.
2665857|CC|You guys call while we were unplugging?
2665910|LMP|Haven't you learned better than to unplug with an interval between?
2671620|LMP|Houston, we're going to turn the CABIN FAN, OFF, for a while. Sorry; it's already OFF.
2671628|CC|Okay; we copy. CABIN FAN is already OFF.
2671633|LMP|That's right. It turns out the request was to turn it on, so we will.
2671649|CC|Okay, understand you're going to turn the CABIN fan, ON. I think that's to keep it a little bit warmer in there for you guys.
2671654|LMP|MARK it. MARK it.
2671826|CC|America, Houston. We'd like to talk to Captain America, please.
2671833|CDR|Give him about - 5 or 10 minutes and he'll be with you.
2671837|CC|Okay; have him give us a call when he gets ready.
2671841|CDR|Okay.
2672703|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 267 hours 27 minutes. The crew has not yet turned in for the night and we'll continue to stand by, live, for any conversation, Apollo 17 now 139,456 nautical miles from Earth, velocity 3,776 feet per second.
2672710|CC|Apollo 17, Houston. We'd like to talk to you guys before you go to bed, please.
2672720|CDR|Go ahead, Bob.
2672736|CC|Okay, we panicked there, I guess, or we got our - change, we - because we saw you go VOICE, OFF, and we wanted to talk to you guys about two or three things before you went to bed. For one thing, we don't see the cabin pumped up yet with the OPS as per Plan, and we don't have the onboard read-outs yet, and we'd like to find out who's going to be on the comm and talk to Ron about his headset. I guess the general concensus of opinion down here, unless we know more about the fix, is there are some possible serious consequences, like blowing up the audio panel, if those wires did get together and short out, depending on which wires they are. So there's some concern about that.
2672825|CDR|Okay, let's get you the read-out first, and we're going to bounce up the cabin here very shortly with the OPS.
2672835|CC|Okay, we'd also like to get the INFRARED to OFF, please - the IR.
2672840|CDR|Okay, it's coming off here shortly.
2673004|CDR|Okay, Bob, the RC - RCS reads 65, 57, 61, and 60.
2673013|CC|Okay, copy those.
2673153|CDR|Houston, are you reading America?
2673155|CC|I'm reading you now. The last thing we got from you was the RCS quantities. We didn't get the BATT quantities.
2673203|CDR|You haven't heard Ron at all?
2673204|CC|No, haven't heard Ron a bit.
2673207|CC|Sounds like the headset - -
2673207|CDR|Well, I'll tell him to try again.
2673210|CC|Okay.
2673226|CC|No, America, we're not reading Ron at all, right now.
2673231|CDR|Okay, he's been on the lightweight headset talking to you all this time. Wait a minute, he's going to check a couple switches.
2673237|CC|Okay. Which headset is broken? The Snoopy?
2673242|CDR|Yes, Ron's - Ron's Snoopy helmet.
2673244|CC|Okay.
2673245|CMP|Hey, are you reading me now, Houston?
2673247|CC|I read you loud and clear now, Ron.
2673250|CMP|Okay, I'm wearing the lightweight headset, now. On the comm carrier, there's a whole bunch of wires, about eight of them - looks like they're twisted pairs, you, know, twisted in fours really. They come up through the thing. And two of those eight wires are cut - are broken in two. The hot end, or the end that comes up from the plug going toward the headset - those two wires both come out individually and individually taped, each one of them. And then the whole group - you know, I bent them out of the way so they wouldn't be touching anything. So they wouldn't touch insulation or tape. I bent them out of the way and taped the whole side of it just to keep the rest of them from breaking in two, and it looks like a pretty good fix on the thing, really. However, if you have any concern about blowing the audio panel, I'll just go ahead and wear the lightweight headset.
2673347|CC|Okay, Ron. Yes, the concern here is not only which wires they are - the potential does exist if one of those shorts to ground to blow the audio panel or at least a circuit breaker, depending upon which wire it is. I gather that what you've done - is that you haven't wired the broken wires back together, but it's just sort of covered the bare leads and wired them out of the way. is that right?
2673411|CMP|Yes, that's correct. It was too close to the - there is a stiff piece of plastic that comes out of the headset itself, out of the bottom of the left earset, and it's broken off too close to the bottom of it there to - to strip the wires down and wire them together at all.
2673428|CC|Okay. Roger on that. I guess - let us think about it here overnight. Offhand, our opinion is, as long as you've got a spare headset, let's wear the spare headset - that spare meaning a lightweight. If you're going to be on comm tonight, I guess we offhand suggest wearing the lightweight tonight. Over. How does that strike you?
2673447|CMP|Okay. Yes, no problem. I won't be on comm tonight, but I'll be wearing the lightweight headset anyhow. The only time I was thinking about it - wearing the other one at all - would be for entry, and there's no problem there. I'll just stick to the lightweight headset around my neck and put that one around my ears just to use as a bump pad, is all.
2673508|CC|Okay; let us think about it overnight, and we'll talk to some people about it. Let's see, is Jack going to be on the headset tonight and the biomed, both?
2673527|CDR|Yes, Jack will be on tonight with the biomed and the headset.
2673531|CC|Okay. We'd like to get one more valve check there, America. Like to check our WASTE WATER TANK INLET valve to AUTO. EECOM says he is in a flat portion and he can't verify that right now by buildup.
2673545|CDR|Okay, stand by 1.
2673623|CDR|WASTE TANK INLET is in AUTO, Bob.
2673625|CC|Okay, thank you on that, Gene. And we did not get the BATT read-outs for the onboard read-outs for the night, BAT C and pyro BATs A and B.
2673634|CDR|Okay, guess you weren't reading. We're at 36.5, 36.9, 36.9, in that order.
2673641|CC|Okay, we copy that. And let me ask you a question here, Gene. Right now you're an hour behind getting to sleep. Do you want to sleep the 8 hours or get up by the Flight Plan?
2673653|CDR|No, let's get up per the Flight Plan. We're very much aware of - of that; we've just been doing some restowage and a few other things around here. But let's get up per the Flight Plan, that's fine.
2673705|CC|Okay. We'll talk to you in the morning. As soon as the cabin is pumped up, you're GO for sleep and you can turn VOICE back OFF, at your convenience.
2673713|CDR|Okay, you'll see the cabin pumped up, we'll go to 5.7 and turn the OPS back OFF.
2673718|CC|Roger. We'll be watching.
2673721|CDR|Okay, babe. Take care.
2673723|CC|See you in the morning.
2673757|PAO| This is Apollo Control at 268 hours 9 minutes. We expect that will be our last conversation with the crew prior to the rest period. We'll leave the line up for a few more minutes and then take it down and come back up with hourly reports. Apollo 17 now 137,900 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity 3,823 feet per second.
2674259|CDR|We're looking at 5.7 in the cabin.
2674302|CC|So are we.
2674326|CDR|Bob, are you going to want to do that again tomorrow?
2674333|CC|Yes, Gene. I will do it again prior to finish emptying the OPS.
2674338|CDR|Okay.
2674901|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 268 hours 19 minutes. The crew has turned off the voice downlink now indicating they are ready for bed and do not intend to talk to us any more this evening or this morning. We'll take the line down now and come back up with hourly reports. At 268 hours 19 minutes, this is Mission Control, Houston.
2692202|PAO|This is Apollo Control. All spacecraft systems operating normally,. The crew is asleep with 5 hours 37 minutes remaining in the rest period.

It's been a quiet night. All spacecraft systems continuing to perform very well. The spaceflight meteorology group with National Weather Service said a short time ago that weather conditions are expected to be satisfactory for the landing and recovery of Apollo 17 crew and spacecraft tomorrow. The weather forecast for the planned landing area, which is located approximately 360 nautical miles southeast of Pango Pango, calls for partly cloudy skies, widely scattered rain showers, variable winds of 10 miles per hour, seas of 3 feet and a temperature of near 80 degrees. At 274 hours 23 mintues, this is Mission Control Houston.
2745802|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 274 hours 58 minutes. We're 2 minutes away from crew wake-up. Apollo 17 is 121,953 nautical miles from the Earth, velocity 4,329 feet per second. Today's wakeup song will be in keeping with the crews theme that Apollo 17 is a beginning and not an end. We'll stand by now for the wakeup
2750002|CC|(Music - "We've Only Just Begun")
2750309|CC|Good morning, America. This is Houston.
2750314|LMP|Good heavens. It sounded like Bob Parker.
2750317|CC|Roger. And in case you didn't recognize it, that was "It's Only Just the Beginning."
2750324|LMP|Or words to that effect.
2750335|CC|And, Jack, if you give us a call when all three of you get in the headsets, we've got something else to play for you this morning.
2750350|LMP|You have a call.
2750352|CC|Say again.
2750356|CMP|... Houston, good morning.
2750356|LMP|I just gave you - I just gave you a call.
2750359|CC|Okay. We'll cue up something else for you guys. And, Ron, this was something that was recorded over at your house yesterday morning. I think you'll recognize it.
2750422|CMP|(Laughter) I'll have to wait and see.
2750505|CC|(Music: Christmas carol recorded by Ron Evans' neighbors) Hi, Dad.
2750710|CC|And, America, if we could do some business this morning. At 275:10 - we'll give you a hack on it, we need UV COVER to go to CLOSE, and we'll give you a call on that one. It's about 3 minutes.
2750731|CMP|Okay.
2750901|CC|Okay. One minute to COVER CLOSE - UV, that is.
2750913|CMP|Hey, Houston; America. Sounds like people are getting in the Christmas spirit around the Houston area there.
2750920|CC|That's affirm. It's a little bit warmer this morning, but it still feels and looks a lot like Christmas down here.
2750930|CDR|Well, Bob, it feels and looks a lot like Christmas up here, too.
2750939|LMP|Matter of fact, the LEB reported a temperature of about a minus 2 last night (laughter).
2750946|CC|Okay; and 15 seconds to UV COVER CLOSE. Five seconds.
2750959|CC|MARK, UV COVER, CLOSE.
2751007|LMP|It's closed.
2751009|CC|Copy that.
2751010|LMP|Yes, the LEB was cloudy, cold, and snowy last night.
2751015|CC|Snowing too, hey? We're showing you 61 degrees in the cabin this morning, with a suit temperature of 48 degrees.
2751028|LMP|Glad I'm not in those suits.
2751033|CC|You could have crawled inside the L-shaped bag, I guess.
2751124|CC|Okay. And America, we'd also like to get BAT A to CHARGE.
2751133|LMP|That's in work right now, Bob. Thanks for the call.
2751138|CC|You're welcome for the answer.
2751144|LMP|Well, we're trying to keep your spirits up today.
2751255|LMP|Hey, Bob, what's 4 degrees equal in distance from the Earth?
2751305|CC|This is the new CAPCOM one. Say again the question. Four degrees equals distance from the Earth?
2751313|LMP|Yes, sir. What does 4 degrees equal in miles from the Earth?
2751357|CC|Retro says that 4 degrees essential angle equals 94K. You guys are out at about 125K right now.
2751411|LMP|Okay, Bob, I was looking at the Flight Plan, and it said field of view is 4 degrees.
2751424|CC|And we're going to have a network handover. We may be a momentarily - momentary dropout.
2751431|LMP|Okay.
2753123|LMP|Houston, 17.
2753126|CC|17, did you call?
2753130|LMP|That's affirm. I've got some reports for you, if you're ready to copy.
2753139|CC|Okay, We've all set.
2753143|LMP|Okay. CDR menu - I'll try negative reporting. He did not eat three apricot cereal cubes, pears. And at lunch he did not eat half a cereal bar. And at dinner he did not eat tomato soup, half a hamburger, and the date fruitcake. And, on lunch he had also - positive now - lemonade, two pecans, and one-fourth of a chocolate bar. Okay, and - last night, he had about 5 hours of fair sleep, no medication, and 2-1/2 cans of water. And his PRD is 17060? That's right, 60. Okay. For the LMP, day 12: He did not eat for breakfast; pears. For lunch; looks like he ate it all. For dinner, he did not eat the tomato soup, half a hamburger, mustard, pudding, and that's it. And add to breakfast another cup of coffee - bag of coffee; excuse me. And the lunch, an orange drink, an orange-pineapple, another coffee, graham cracker cubes - four of them, two pecans, and one-fourth of a chocolate bar. And - his PRD is 24188, and 6 hours intermittent sleep, 1-1/2 cans of water, and took one Lomotil last night, just as we were turning in, as a result of the Evans affair catching up with the LMP. The CMP - negative reporting again - did not eat sausage, fruit cocktail, orange beverage. And for lunch, he did not eat the peaches. And for dinner, he did not eat tomato soup and the caramel candy. Add to breakfast, coffee, four sugar cookies and four jelly candies. That's for breakfast. To lunch, add lemonade, coffee, two pecans, and one-fourth of a chocolate bar - one-half of a chocolate bar; excuse me. Okay. His PRD is 15058. He had about 5 hours of fair sleep and two sniffs of nose drops and two Lomotils yesterday. And he had five cans of water. And that should do it, Bob.
2753623|CC|Roger, Jack.
2753624|LMP|Thank you for your indulgence.
2753625|CC|Thank you for your report. We appreciate it.
2753656|LMP|Houston, 17.
2753658|CC|Roger, Jack. Go ahead.
2753702|LMP|We thought we'd warm up the cabin. And if I recall correctly, the - you approve of us putting INVERTER 3 onto MAIN A and going to MANUAL on the TEMP IN and taking the - EVAP TEMP up to about 59 degrees.
2753723|CC|That's affirmative.
2753752|LMP|Okay, Houston. INVERTER 3 is going onto MAIN A.
2753801|CC|Roger. We're watching it.
2753807|LMP|Okay.
2753808|LMP|MARK it.
2753821|LMP|And - Stand by.
2753853|LMP|TEMP IN is MANUAL.
2754410|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 2 -
2754411|LMP|Okay, Houston, I think we're pretty close. We're showing about 62. We'll watch it a little bit; and If it doesn't come down, we'll tweak it again.
2754427|CC|Roger, Jack. And the ground is showing about 60 degrees.
2754435|LMP|Okay.
2754610|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 275:46 Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 17 now 28 hours and 31 minutes from entry back into the Earth's atmosphere. Approaching Earth at a velocity of 4,397 feet per second. Still 119,924 nautical miles out. There were 2 wakeup pieces of music this morning. The first was "We've Only Just Begun" by the Carpenters and the second was an unidentified Christmas Carol by the neighbors of the Evans family, recorded yesterday. Since awakening, the crew has passed up their medical and sleep report and food consumption negative reporting of what they didn't eat out of their daily menu. Meanwhile, the Spaceflight Meteorology Group of the National Weather Service said this morning that weather conditions are expected to be satisfactory -
2754720|LMP|Bob, EECOM's procedure's almost like having a fire in the fireplace.
2754727|CC|Roger. Glad you're comfortable.
2754740|PAO|Meanwhile, back in the South Pacific, the weather forcast for the planned landing area, approximately 360 nautical miles southeast of Pago Pago, calls for partly cloudy skies, widely scattered rain showers, variable winds at 10 miles per hour, seas of 3 feet and temperature of 80 degrees. At 275:48 standing by, this is Apollo Control.
2755747|CC|America, Houston.
2755752|LMP|Go ahead, Bob.
2755753|CC|How would you like a quick look at sports here and then into the news summary while you're having your breakfast?
2755802|LMP|We'd like the whole thing.
2755805|CC|Well, I guess that we all assume maybe you're like the rest of us and turn to your sport page first sometimes. So we thought we'd recap the pro football action yesterday, in a rather strange day, since there were only - only two games that really made any difference. And I think the scores kind of showed the day. In the American Conference playoff games coming up next weekend, Oakland will play at Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh getting into the playoffs for the first time in 40 years. The Cleveland Browns will take on the undefeated Miami Dolphins, who have won 14 straight. In the National Conference, Dallas will be at San Francisco Saturday, and Green Bay plays at Washington on Sunday. Quickly recapping some of the scores from yesterday. On that sad, sad one here in Houston, Cincinnati rolled over the Oilers, 61 to 17. There were three touchdowns scored in the fourth quarter within less than 5 minutes of play, all on interceptions - on - the part of Cincinnati. New York Giants, it says, upset Dallas 23 to 3. I question the upset since Dallas was already in the playoffs; and, in what I watched, it looked like they were aware that they were already in the playoffs. Buffalo upset Washington 24, - 17. And again it's a questionable upset because O. J. Simpson had a great day, and Larry Brown from Washington was kept on the bench for the whole game. Oakland, 28, over Chicago, 21; Detroit, 34, over Los Angeles, 17. Los Angeles' hopes for any playoff berth had been knocked out by San Francisco's win on Saturday, and it looked like they played that way on Sunday. Cleveland, in a real tough one up in New York with 30-knot winds and a - gale - gale-force winds and lots of snow and cold, defeated New York Jets, 26 to 10. Green Bay, 30, over New Orleans, 20, in a tough one, which saw two - two touchdowns being scored off of blocked punts. Kansas City, 17, over Atlanta, 14. And, again, Atlanta's chances for a playoff berth had been wiped out on Saturday; and, apparently, they played that way on Sunday. Denver, 45, over New England, 21; St. Louis, 24, over Philadelphia, 23. Pittsburgh defeated San Diego 24 to 2. On Saturday Miami had taken Baltimore 16 to nothing, and as I previously mentioned, San Francisco defeated Minnesota on Saturday 20 to 17. Just one little note, Jack, you might be interested in this mornings paper, concerning the New Orleans Saints. One of the - Dave Parks from the New Orleans Saints, announced his retirement, and he kind of took a rap at the Saints in claiming that they were a team that did not want to win, and that he was retiring unless they would trade him to a winner. It sounds like our friend over there might have some problems this winter come contract time. In pro basketball last night, the Houston Rockets beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 110 to 109. Jack Marin had 35 points, Mike Newlin had 34. In college basketball, UCLA remains number one in the latest ratings. Second ranked Florida State was beaten this weekend by Princeton, 61 to 59, Third ranked Maryland won, as did fourth-ranked Marquette, fifth-ranked Minnesota and number six, North Carolina State. Indiana is rated 15th, Houston is 16th. We can't find Purdue, Kansas or Cal Tech in the ratings right now. There's one bowl game tonight. Iowa State, who has taken a 5 game losing streak into the Liberty Bowl, will meet: Georgia Tech at Memphis, Tennessee. In local hockey, the Aeros and the Los Angeles Sharks of the World Hockey Association, battled to a 4-4 tie.
2760153|CC|Now, for page 1 news. The outlook for a quick peace settlement in Vietnam has taken an apparent turn for the worse. The Hanoi government radio announced last night that U.S. planes have dropped more mines in Haiphong harbor and has also carried out bombing and rocket attacks on the city of Haiphong. There was no immediate comment from Washington on the charges. The snag in the Paris peace talks apparently hinges on a few key points, according to press association reports. Among them, the North Vietnamese will not accept the idea of two separate Vietnamese states and the method of policing a truce, the two-Vietnam policy being the major stumbling block. The weather here is making news. Yesterday's reading at Intercontinental Airport was a frigid 22 degrees. Downtown Houston was 32. The airport reading was the lowest since 1932. Up north in the upper Midwest and northeast, it's going to be a white Christmas, and more snow is moving into the area. Chicago had a low of 5 above Sunday; Kansas City, 19; and Albuquerque, 18. Anne Armstrong, long a power in Texas Republican politics, is reportedly about to be named to a high post in the Nixon administration. Harry Truman still clings to life. The 88-year-old Presi - 88-year-old former President is holding his own, according to his doctors. Debris found floating in the Gulf of Mexico off the west coast of Florida has been identified as that of a Coast Guard Helicopter that crashed. Earlier the chopper had rescued four fishermen from a sinking shrimp trawler. The helicopter was headed back to Saint - Saint Petersburg when it went down with the four fishermen and the crew of four. It's a lot safer up there where you are than on the Texas highways. The State Highway Patrol reported a high number of serious accidents on Texas roads this weekend. A Houston newspaper reports that industrial demand for Trinity River system water will not produce enough money to finance the project and that the City of Houston's water and industrial district funds will have to make up the difference. Meanwhile, the Clear Lake City Water Authority is tossing around a proposal that would require developers to pay 50 percent of the cost of all lateral water and sewer lines. Up around Conroe, in Montgomery County, a transformer blew up Sunday morning and electrical power went out for several hours. Several thousand homes were affected. Baytown was the scene of four armed robberies Sunday. Four business establishments were hit in a 14-minute period. The masked gunmen got about $500 cash. No one was injured. And a final note, today in history, actress Betty Grable is 56 years old. That's from your news editor, Jim Kukowski.
2760444|CDR|Thank you for the news, Bob.
2760447|LMP|And notice the disclaimer.
2760451|CC|(Laughter)
2760452|CDR|And you're right, the traffic's not too thick up here, as a matter of fact.
2760457|CC|Yes, I was wishing that - -
2760457|CDR|We've been looking for the big man with the white gray beard.
2760501|CC|- - I was kind of wishing it would get a little thicker up there one of these days.
2760507|CDR|It will.
2760510|CC|I'm counting on it.
2760516|CDR|Hang in there, babe.
2760527|CC|It looks like we're going to have some good football to watch next week, and I think they're going to have a pretty light schedule for you all - so - until after the holidays - and we ought to be able to sit back and relax a bit.
2760618|CC|And one additional weather report, I'm sure you're interested in. The weather in your primary landing area is looking great, and we anticipate no weather avoidance maneuvers whatsoever. Things are great out there. And I'm thinking of going out and enlisting the Apollo 17 chaplain, so we can maybe get some warmer weather for your arrival back here on Thursday.
2760654|CDR|Well, I guess if - if anyone can do it, he can do it, if you can find him.
2760659|CC|He's - he's been around. We've seen his picture a number of times in the paper over at - visiting your house, there, and rooting us home.
2760711|CDR|I thought I told him to stay away from there. Only kidding, he's always a welcome addition.
2760729|CC|Roger.
2760735|CDR|And I might add, he usually is.
2760757|CC|I've got a telegram here that was sent out to the U.S.S. Ticon - Ticonderoga, I thought you might be interested in. Coming up on antenna switch, I'll read it to you in a minute.
2760901|CC|Are you ready for this telegram that was sent out today?
2760953|CC|Okay, would you like to hear the contents of this telegram that went out of here today to the U.S.S. Ticonderoga?
2761000|CDR|Yes, sir.
2761001|CC|It's to the U.S.S. Ticonderoga, passed to the NASA Team Leader. It says, "Stullken, we know exactly where the spacecraft is, and we know exactly where it's going to land. Now, if you can figure out approximately where you are, we will be in good shape. Pull yourself together, and move 50 feet from the target point. Let's end this program right." Signed, The Guys in the Trench, MCC, Houston.
2761030|CDR|Beautiful, Bob, beautiful.
2761034|CC|Thought you'd like that one.
2762014|CC|America, Houston. We'd like you to stop the roll that you're in right now, and stop it at roll of 60 degrees. Be convenient if you'd do it right now, it'd help us keep us on Flight Plan here.
2762028|CDR|Six degrees, okay. Won't go to 14 -
2762029|CC|No, 60, 60, six zero, six zero, you're right about there.
2762033|CDR|That's affirm. Six zero, I'll stop it now.
2762038|CC|Okay, and there's some HIGH GAIN angles that go with that: PITCH, minus 54; YAW, 225. You're on HIGH GAIN now, so unless you lose lock you shouldn't have any problem.
2762742|CC|America, Houston. We'd like to have the UV COVER, OPEN, now, if somebody's over there.
2762754|LMP|All right, Bob. We may not be by that part of spacecraft for a couple of more hours. Can you hold off?
2762801|CC|Well, we don't mind. Although if somebody's over - it's convenient, we'd sure like it.
2762811|LMP|Okay, I'll make a special trip.
2762819|LMP|UV COVER is OPEN.
2762822|CC|Thank you, sir.
2762903|CMP|Okay, Houston. There are the torquing angles. And if you're satisfied, I'll go ahead and torque.
2762912|CC|Roger, Ron. We've got them, and you're clear to torque.
2762918|CMP|Okay, torqued at 29-30.
2763010|CC|America, Houston. Now that you're not eating and working, we've got a couple of configuration on the H2 tanks and the O2 tank heaters, we'd like to have accomplished.
2763025|LMP|Okay, Bob. I was just over there.
2763031|CC|Roger.
2763033|LMP|Okay, go ahead.
2763034|CC|H2 tank 3 FANS to OFF; H2 tank 2 FANS to ON.
2763048|LMP|Okay, 3 is OFF, and 2 is ON.
2763053|CC|Roger. And O2 tank 2 and tank 1 HEATERS to AUTO, if they're not there.
2763104|LMP|Okay, you want 1 and 2 to AUTO. They're going.
2763107|CC|Okay, and anytime this morning, we would like to get an OPS read-out, whenever it's convenient on that.
2763128|LMP|Okay, Bob. It was 1000 after we stopped bleeding last night and I'll check it again in a little while.
2763137|CC|Okay. That sounds good enough now. We just needed the reading, so we could figure out what to do with it. You might be interested in your consumables. Right now on the RCS, you're right on the Flight Plan at 51 percent remaining. Your oxygen tanks are all either on the Flight Plan, or just slightly above it, or within the noise level - maybe a tad below it - you're just right on for all intents and purposes. You're in good shape, and your hydrogen is in good shape. You're in good shape on all your consumables.
2763250|CDR|Bob, we got a GO to start our dumps?
2763254|CC|Say again.
2763322|CDR|Hello, Houston; America. Have we got a GO to commence our dumps?
2763326|CC|That's affirmative, and on your waste water dump, we only want it dumped down to 45 percent on your gauge - 45 percent on your gauge.
2763342|CDR|Okay, Bob. I guess we're reading about 52 percent now, so we'll dump a little bit.
2763349|CC|That's affirmative.
2763445|CC|And for whoever is the keeper of the Flight Plan this morning, we've got a couple of changes to your Flight Plan, in addition to those we called as you were eating there, so we've got a couple additions to it - or changes.
2763502|CDR|Go ahead, Bob.
2763504|CC|Okay. The first one is at 281:02 - 281:02. Change the call "Manually roll left" to "Manually roll left 60 degrees to a roll angle of 071." We want 60 degrees in a roll angle of 071.
2763534|CDR|Okay; we got it.
2763537|CC|Okay. At 281:10, change register 2 of NOUN 78 there to minus 019-74.
2763559|CDR|Okay; got it.
2763602|CC|That's it for the Flight Plan updates this morning, so far.
2763608|CDR|Okay, thank you. And the waste water is dumped to 45.
2763615|CC|Roger. We see it.
2765332|CDR|Houston, America. We're about to maneuver.
2765341|CC|Okay, we're standing by.
2765524|CC|America, Houston.
2765530|LMP|Go ahead.
2765531|CC|Jack, we're trying - This is for Jack - we're trying to consolidate and think through what your request was for some sort of a geology surface update. We - we're just wondering if maybe you don't have the better material at your hands there than we've got down here as far any conclusions or preliminary estimates might be.
2765553|LMP|Okay, I just thought that you guys may have had some new ideas. We had a good briefing last night from Gordy on the surface experiments. I guess we might want to be updated on the orbital experiments, if there's anything new. And field geology, yes, I guess we got a pretty good feeling for it, but I thought they might have had some new ideas, or something along that line.
2765623|CC|Well, I'm sure they do, and I don't mean to shortchange our geology - geology back room, Jack, but on the other hand, I think - I think really  we're just waiting to get the answers from you or tie up maybe their thoughts with you. And I, you know, from a bystander's standpoint, if I read you anything that they've - maybe conclusions that they may have made, we just may be fudging the data because there's - -
2765647|LMP|I'm not looking for conclusions, I'm looking for ideas.
2765650|CC|Hey, Jack.
2765652|LMP|Tell them don't - don't worry about it. You know, I just thought they might have something to say.
2765658|CC|Yes, they got plenty to say, Jack. But they're down here and they can say it, and I think what you ought to say up there is what you're familiar with and just confine it to that.
2765707|LMP|Oh, you can count on that, Deke, I just like to think about things.
2765712|CC|Roger, you're going to have lots of time to do that.
2765722|CC|We'd like AUTO and high gain.
2765736|LMP|Okay, you got AUTO.
2765738|CC|Thank you.
2770244|CC|America, Houston. We may have not been looking at the right displays at the right time, but we didn't see an O2 purge. Did you do O2 fuel cell purge?
2770303|LMP|Sorry about that, Bob. I misunderstood. I thought - I see it now - it's H2 and O2. I'll go into that now.
2770312|CC|Okay. We'd appreciate it. We're just keeping you honest.
2770325|LMP|That's what you need to do.
2770347|CDR|By the way, Bob, that - 59 degrees on the manual temp control setting made it very comfortable in here.
2770357|CC|Real fine - real fine.
2770435|CC|We'd like OMNI Delta - OMNI Delta.
2770949|LMP|Okay, Bob. I'm up to date on the O2 purges now.
2771054|CC|Roger, Jack.
2773045|CC|America, Houston.
2773049|LMP|Go ahead.
2773050|CC|About 15 minutes or so ago, we noticed - or detected a transfer on your ECS FLOW CONTROL proportioning valve from number 1 to number 2 and we were wondering if the switch, ECS RADIATOR FLOW CONTROL AUTO switch, is still in the AUTO position. And if it is in the AUTO po - -
2773114|LMP|It is in the AUTO position. And we see the "2" here also.
2773118|CC|Okay, we're - we'd like to just leave everything like it is, and we'd like to go off and study this awhile. And we don't - -
2773127|LMP|Okay.
2773127|CC|- - anticipate any problem here and it's - number 2 which should work as good as number 1.
2780002|PAO|(Here it comes.) This is Apollo Control at 278 hours Ground Elapsed Time. 26 hours and 17 minutes until Apollo 17 reenters the Earth's atmosphere for splashdown near Pago Pago, American Samoa in the South Pacific. Spacecraft at the present time is 114,147 nautical miles away from the Earth, approaching at a velocity of 4,600 feet per second. Rather quiet work day for the crew of Apollo 17. Earlier in the day the morning news was read up to the crew after they were wakened by two different musical selections. One of which was recorded yesterday in the Evans home by some neighbors who had come in. And the first one was a rendition of "We've Just Begun" by The Carpenters. The singing group Carpenters, that is. At 278:01 Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
2780448|LMP|Houston, America here. We'll probably VERB 49 out to the thermal attitude.
2780454|CC|Roger. We're standing by waiting for it.
2780458|CMP|Okay.
2781100|LMP|Houston, 17. The OPS is now reading 1100; 1100.
2781109|CC|Roger, Jack. We've got that data.
2781201|CC|America, Houston.
2781207|CMP|Go ahead.
2781208|CC|Rog, if - if you're stowing the OPS, we might want to hold here a second. We're going to want to dump that OPS down to as low as possible pressure, and we'll be wanting to give you a GO on that. Let me get on - get hooked up here around the room.
2781226|CMP|Okay. You know, we've still got it out. We thought we'd, you know, stow it later this afternoon sometime.
2781233|CC|Okay, fine.
2781236|CMP|You know, after we can dump it again.
2781336|CC|America, Houston. Your cabin is down to 4.8 now, so you're cleared to dump the OPS at any time. And we expect with 1100 pounds it would pump it up to about 5.7, so we'll probably have to stop you prior to reaching zero.
2781355|CMP|Oh, okay. Hey, mighty fine. We'll do it.
2781440|CMP|Okay, Houston. That OPS is dumping now.
2781446|CC|Roger, Ron. We'll watch it.
2781941|CC|America, Houston.
2781945|LMP|Go ahead.
2781948|CC|We've identified a humber of cracks and crevices up in the - in the area - any area above the couch plane along the X-axis or just above the couch plane that could possibly be places where the scissors disappeared to. And we would like those areas searched if they haven't been searched already. As an example, the crack between the top of the main display panel number 2 and the - the hatch opening area, that kind of crack and crevice area there. We would like that looked into. I kind of assume you've already done that. We don't want you to remove any panels or anything like that to look in. But have you looked in those areas, or do you plan to look in those areas here shortly?
2782041|CMP|Hey, Bob, I've looked in some of those things. But just to make sure I've covered everything and the fact that we checked it again, why don't we go over it again.
2782055|CC|Okay.
2782104|CMP|Wait a minute and I'll get my flashlight, and then we can start doing it again systematically.
2782110|CC|Okay.
2782116|LMP|It's scissors, my dear Watson, scissors.
2782121|CC|Seriously, it would have saved a lot of problem if you'd seen them floating out, Jack. We would have just not had to have done any of this.
2782144|CDR|Houston, America.
2782146|CC|Roger. Go ahead.
2782149|CDR|Bob, it looks like we're going to make it on this OPS depress. She's reading 0, and she's just barely bleeding out. We're somewhere around 5.5, so I'm just going to let it bleed out now. And then we'll stow it.
2782201|CC|Real fine; real fine.
2782704|CMP|Okay, Houston. Checked it out above MDC number 2.
2782711|CC|Okay; and - -
2782712|CMP|Also, looked - -
2782715|CC|- - there was the area around - -
2782716|CMP|Go ahead.
2782717|CC|- - each of the plus XX - the XX struts and the PLV vent there, and the other XX strut. You might check - pay particular attention to that area.
2782730|CMP|Yes, we checked that. And also checked it again now.
2782734|CC|Okay. From our pictures, and this may not really be the case, on the - above main display panel 3, where it says - where the handhold, the structure part of handhold, looks like there's some cracks and crevices right above - right around that handhold area that could, between the handhold and panel 6, that a pair of scissors could slip up into.
2782822|CMP|Okay. We're looking around there, and it doesn't look like they could - Well, they could possibly fit in there maybe. But, anyhow, we checked it, and they're not there.
2782832|CC|Okay. And then on the other side of the cockpit in the same area around handhold, back behind the - that crevice area back behind the COAS power panel, panel 15, and the handhold. And then also that little area in front of the handhold, where - the cutout for main display panel 2, you might look - take your light and look in there.
2782858|CMP|Okay. I'm over there now.
2783043|CMP|Okay, Houston. No joy on that part either.
2783046|CC|Okay, Ron. The next couple are really down in the lower equipment bay area, and then I've got one area up in the tunnel - two areas up in the tunnel that are suspect areas, and then that does it. Which would you like first?
2783104|CMP|I'm up in the tunnel, now.
2783105|CC|Okay; the tunnel area. The only thing we show up there is the - the four handholds around the - around the tunnel. I don't think scissors could get up there, but there - they - maybe they could slip in something like that. Anyway, those four handhold slots up there, you might check in those two areas.
2783202|CMP|Those scissors couldn't fit in those handholds, but it's good to check them. Something else might be in there.
2783207|CC|Okay. The - Oh, in the other one up in that area, Ron, and I assume you - you've put that outlet bag over the cabin fans - and we wouldn't want you to fool with that at all, because it's probably all full of dirt and everything - but if you didn't, then the outlet to the cabin fan area might be a potential place.
2783231|CMP|Let's see. We installed that the first day out, I think. And it's been on there ever since.
2783239|CC|Yes, we assumed you did. I just was trying to cover all bases here. Okay; the last three items are - I think you've actually called one of them - are down in the lower equipment bay. One of them is the - the crack just below panel 101, down in the lower equipment bay. I think you called that one the first night, didn't you?
2783305|CMP|Not below 101; no.
2783309|CC|Okay. Our pictures show a crevice below 101, and also while you're right there, I - I don't think it's even - there's a crevice above the door for the optics stowage area that you might check up in there. It might have lodged. And, also, while you're right there, Ron, our picture, of course, shows your hoses stowed, and they kind of come out right there to the right of panel 120, the optics stowage area. And so you've got some area behind those panels - behind those hoses and that - where it might have lodged, but I believe you had to move those in order to do your EVA yesterday, anyway.
2783359|CMP|Yes, the hoses in the tunnel have all been moved around in here, as far as the hoses are concerned. I still think the biggest probability is - is right above the optics stowage, and that's what I was talking about before. Because it's about - oh, an inch. You know, the crack is at least an inch deep in there and as long as the optics stowage thing itself.
2783427|CC|Okay; and let me - We'll have one more recommendation for you. And then over panel -
2783434|CMP|Okay.
2783434|CC|- - 250 there's a little bitty opening - it shows in the pictures - over panel 250.
2783442|CMP|Okay; we'll check that in a second here.
2783543|CC|Our only thoughts, Ron, on the - any other position that you might see - You know, if it's above the couch plane and you really think it might be a suspect area, you might consider taping the crack, if you desire. The tape probably isn't going to hold it in if it wants to come tumbling out, but it - it's something you could do if you wanted to.
2783610|CMP|Okay. Yes, I understand that, Bob. That's a good point.
2783653|CC|And, Ron, while we're talking to you, we'd like to tag up with you on one more item unrelated to the scissors search, and that is your headset situation. And we just want to leave the - make sure you're going to do as was said last night and will not plug that - the headset with the broken wires you will not plug in again, and we'll arrange your entry configuration in some configuration that does not require that headset to be plugged in. Is that affirm?
2783723|CMP|Yes, that's affirm, Bob. I think what I'll do, I'll wear it as a bump hat, you know, and then - and then use the lightweight headset with the - you know, with the earplugs underneath that. I'll put the lightweight headset around my neck, and then have the mike sticking up in front of me, and with the earplugs on. I - I tested that configuration; it's comfortable. No problem. It'll work. And I will not plug in the comm carrier at all.
2783751|CC|Roger. We just wanted to tag up with you on that. That's what we'll be expecting, and we'll - we'll put this to bed forever.
2783758|CMP|Okay; mighty fine.
2784226|CDR|Houston, America.
2784228|CC|Go ahead.
2784234|CC|Go ahead, America.
2784238|CDR|Okay, Bob. We got the major compartments inventoried and stowed for entry, with the exception of the things we need, of course, between now and then in the sleeping areas and what have you. We'll finish that off, of course, as we finish up with gear and as we get up in the morning. But there's very little left to do, and any contingency weight changes, which there may be just a couple at the most, we'll inventory those and give them to you in the morning.
2784316|CC|Roger.
2790820|CC|America, 17. Say again. 17, Houston.
2790825|CMP|Go ahead.
2790826|CC|I've got an interesting little press release here. Jack Schmitt - and I'm sure all of you will be interested in, but based upon your work up in the Shorty area on the surface, the people out at Flagstaff went back and looked at the Apollo 14 250-millimeter camera frames from - and showed that it had colored frames that showed brownish and orangish colorations on a bulbous dome in the Crater Langrenus and on a 4-kilometer dark halo crater on the ejecta blanket of Theophilus. And they've made that news release today.
2790911|LMP|Very good. We may have triggered something.
2790915|CC|Yes, sir.
2790933|CMP|Bob, I'm ready to maneuver.
2791053|CC|America, we'd like OMNI Delta.
2791104|LMP|You have OMNI Delta now, Bob.
2791740|CC|17, Houston. OMNI Alfa.
2791751|LMP|You got it.
2792620|CMP|Houston, America. Would you like the HIGH GAIN?
2792626|CC|That's affirmative.
2792717|CC|America, you can go to AUTO on the HIGH GAIN.
2792724|CMP|You got it.
2792727|CC|Thank you.
2794133|CDR|Houston, America.
2794136|CC|Go ahead, America.
2794140|CDR|Okay. We might be 5 or 10 minutes late on starting ALFMED. We're still putting some sensors on.
2794148|CC|Roger.
2794158|CDR|Hello, Bob.
2794200|CC|Yes.
2794203|CDR|Can you get a reading? is it the same two subjects on ALFMED as we had going out, or is this a case where you want all three of us? it's not exactly clear.
2794339|CC|Jack, we agree with you that it's not clear, and FAO tells us we want the two - same two subjects wearing the blindfolds as on the transearth coast as was on the translunar coast.
2794353|CDR|Okay. Well, this has been Gene, and that's the way we'll do it.
2794358|CC|Roger, Gene.
2794550|LMP|Houston, this is Jack.
2794554|CC|Go ahead.
2794558|LMP|Yes. We've got pretty good comm attitude here, and the - ask FAO if they want them on VOX and if they also want the notes recorded up here.
2794609|CC|Okay. I'll check on that.
2794652|CC|The easiest way to do it would be to just go ahead and do it on VOX, and we'll get everything recorded down here.
2794659|LMP|I agree, because taking notes is good when you're having dropouts, but it's hardly the same as tapes.
2794707|CC|That's affirmative. And since you do have - you're locked up on comm and HIGH GAIN and that, well, let's just go ahead and we'll just record it all down here for you.
2794720|LMP|Okay.
2794908|CC|Jack, Houston.
2794912|LMP|Go ahead.
2794913|CC|This is your option, Jack. But if you want to, you can put the other set of blindfolds out and see what you see, too, in VOX and give us the data.
2794927|LMP|Roger. Maybe I will. One problem is, though, that I notice that once things get going with two, that they were starting to interfere, and three might do the same thing.
2794941|CC|Okay. Your option. No - -
2794941|LMP|I may put them on anyway.
2794943|CC|It's your option. No problem.
2794946|LMP|I may put them on just to watch.
2794949|CC|Roger.
2794953|LMP|It's the only movie we have this afternoon.
2795018|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 279 hours 50 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 17 spacecraft, America, now 109,179 nautical miles from Earth, velocity increasing ever so slightly - now 4,784 feet per second. 24 hours 27 minutes away from entry and splashdown, tomorrow afternoon in the South Pacific. The crew, at the present time, is preparing to conduct the light flash visual phenomenon experiment on the Flight Plan time. A few minutes late perhaps, if anything. Jack Schmitt may or may not don the third set of eye shields to -
2795115|CMP|Houston, America.
2795117|CC|Go ahead.
2795120|CMP|Roger. Would you ask the Surgeon to check and see if the Command Module Pilot is alive and well.
2795139|CC|Okay. They're seeing data. It looks sort of squirrelly and - but it looks - they want it to settle down for a little while.
2795214|CMP|Better go VOX.
2795251|LMP|...
2795253|CDR|Got to unplug that there.
2795407|CMP|Yes, I'm ready.
2795423|CDR|Okay, Bob. CDR and CMP have got their blindfolds on.
2795428|CC|Roger.
2795439|CMP|I got it.
2795451|CDR|Okay. We're starting.
2795622|CMP|Houston, this is Ron. While we're getting dark adapted here, probably won't see any for a while. Let me just record on the tape my impression of these light flashes as they occurred around the Moon and at other times. In general, they've all been essentially - just a - as - as it says - a flash, with a - with a little bit of a glow, and usually in one eye or the other eye. And for some reason, most generally, they've been kind of - if you - you'd almost say it's in - it's in the periphery of your vision, because you get the feeling that maybe there was a flash over to the left or down to the right or something like that. But you don't get a distinct impression as to where the flash came from. Well, you can - you can see where it came from, but not - you can't see the flash itself. Like it was just beyond your vision. Most of them have been like that. At one time and one time only throughout the flight, I can remember kind of a triple flash, so to speak. And in that case, there was a bright flash in the left eye on - on - about 10 o'clock in the left eye. And then it repeated itself again about 2 o'clock in the left eye. And then about, oh, 10 o'clock, a quarter of the way out, in the right eye. I just got a bing, bing, bing, just like that. Three - three of them right in a row. And the rest of the time, though, they've all essentially been single flashes to me.
2795821|CDR|This is Gene here. I'll just remark that both Jack and I did see them on the lunar surface. I guess the best summation I can make of that is I think I saw both lines and - and the spots or the flashes a little bit more sharply, but that might be because of the adaptation - dark adaptation in the LM prior to going to sleep was probably a little bit better. And I'd guess - it's awful hard to tell time when you're under - when it's dark, ... but I guess I want to say they were quite frequent, and I'd say that means two to three a minute now. That could be way out, but that's what I'd guess.
2800553|CMP|(Cough)
2801341|CMP|(Cough) ... In my ... or something. I don't see anything.
2801403|CMP|(Cough)
2802435|CC|America, Houston. We haven't heard anything. Have you seen any flashes at all?
2802442|CMP|Haven't heard a - I haven't seen a thing, Bob. Can't understand it.
2802447|CDR|Same here from the CDR. I haven't seen anything.
2802449|CC|Roger. I understand. Your heart rates are down pretty low, like maybe you fell asleep or something.
2802456|CMP|Oh, no. Well, the LMP dozed a couple of times but - I thought I saw one, Bob, but I'm not sure. I squinted hard about that time. I may have just triggered something.
2802509|CC|Roger. Okay. We're just standing by.
2802517|LMP|The last time we were in PTC, were we not?
2802522|CC|Yes, you were, and that's one reason you had to copy it down, because we kept losing comm on you.
2802528|LMP|As I recall, they seemed to come in batches when - when I was taking notes. Is that what you people observed - or recorded, rather?
2802553|CC|That's affirmative, Jack. And the thought that occurs, of course, is that you may be blocking with the shielding on the spacecraft somehow.
2802917|CMP|Houston, has my biomed settled down?
2802923|CC|That's affirmative.
2802926|CMP|Okay.
2804634|LMP|No, I haven't been able to see any flashes. I rotated 180 degrees along the rotation axis along Z and saw no change - LMP.
2805011|CC|America, Houston. The light flash observation time is up, and we'd - we'd like to move on into the Flight Plan. And this call - it is for Ron - -
2805022|LMP|Hey, Robert.
2805024|CC|The EMS entry check is on - at 281 as shown. We'd like you to do that now prior to the maneuver, which is at 281, or delay it until about 281:50 when you're not maneuvering. We'd like to do that check when you are not in - not maneuvering.
2805046|CMP|I'll go ahead and do it now. What's going up this minute - coming up here?
2805050|CDR|Okay.
2805051|CMP|Let's see what's coming up first.
2805052|CC|Okay. You can do it now. You've got about 5 minutes prior to the VERB 49 maneuver.
2805059|CDR|What would that be? EMS check? Okay. Why - why don't you go over it now?
2805107|LMP|Your eyes all right?
2805108|CDR|Give yourself a chance to open your eyes.
2805109|LMP|Yes.
2805111|CMP|That must prove something, the fact that we didn't even see them, huh?
2805115|CC|It would probably tell you that there's a point source, and the spacecraft is blocking it somehow.
2805123|CDR|Or the Earth. Or the Sun.
2805125|LMP|I believe it.
2805126|CC|Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. If I wanted to get technical, something's blocking them. That's right.
2805131|CDR|(Laughter) Much as we have been seeing them, I can't believe that. Okay, Ron. Why don't you go ahead and do that, huh? I just put mine up.
2805256|CMP|Okay. I'm on page 1-3, and the EMS FUNCTION is OFF. Circuit breakers are CLOSE. MS MODE to STANDBY. And FUNCTION to TEST 5 - or TEST 1. EMS to NORMAL.
2805408|CMP|Okay. The hairline is over the notch in the self-test pattern and in test pattern number 4. Okay; 0.05G light came on in TEST 2. Go to TEST 3.
2805501|CMP|Okay; it's 10 seconds, and the down light came on.
2805529|CMP|Okay; it's 58.O in the range counter. Okay; TEST 4. She's counting down, and trace went down. Going straight along.
2805555|CMP|MARK it. 10 seconds. 0.0. How about that? And it stops at the lower right-hand corner of the trace.
2805634|CMP|Okay; with TEST 5, trace went up, and 10 seconds later the upper light came ON.
2805659|CMP|Okay. We'll go to RANGE SET here. ... cool down a little bit. And the trace moves on up to zero. It looks like it worked good, Houston.
2805712|CC|Roger. Sounds great.
2805719|CMP|Okay; we'll go to STANDBY and OFF.
2810335|CC|America, Houston.
2810338|CDR|Go ahead.
2810340|CC|Just some words for Ron. When he gets into the P20 option 2, the maneuver there was tried on the simulator, and it got out to 71 degrees on the middle gimbal angle. And they got a gimbal warning light, although 71 degrees is the maximum yaw angle they got.
2810401|CDR|Okay; we'll try it.
2810415|LMP|Bob, for your recorded information there, mag Tango - Tango on the 35-millimeter camera - frames - let's see - 8 through 13 have the ALFMED prime observer position data on them.
2810443|CC|Roger. We've got it recorded.
2811018|CC|Just another piece of data, guys. On this maneuver you're in right now, it should go out to a 67-degree middle gimbal angle right in this maneuver.
2811214|CC|America, Houston. We'd like to close UV cover until we're in attitude now.
2811222|CMP|Okay; we'll close the cover.
2811234|CMP|UV COVER is CLOSED.
2811604|CC|America, Houston.
2811608|CMP|Houston, this is America. Go ahead.
2811610|CC|Roger. We've got a procedure we'd like to go through to eventually put the ECS RADIATORS FLOW CONTROL over to AUTO, and we have a bunch - several steps we'd like to go through before you do that move.
2811627|CMP|Okay. Wait a minute; I'll write them down here so we can ...
2811631|CC|Roger. Are you ready to read it - or copy it?
2811637|CMP|Okay. Go ahead.
2811638|CC|Okay. On panel 5, the ECS RADIATORS CONTROLLER circuit breaker AC1, verify CLOSED. Panel 2 ECS RADIATORS FLOW CONTROLLER to position 1. ECS RADIATORS FLOW CONTROL POWER to OFF, CENTER then POWER. Wait 20 seconds. ECS RADIATORS FLOW CONTROL to AUTO. Over.
2811802|CDR|Houston, America.
2811804|CC|Go ahead.
2811808|CDR|Do you suspect it was a - a power glitch, or do you think the controller actually failed and you're just now verifying it?
2811818|CC|Negative on either of those cases. We've just had lots of spurious changes in the past history on flights. John's sitting here saying you had a number of times on 10, and so - since we're not - We just think the power controller probably saw a temperature glitch or something, and we think it will just come right back. No problem.
2811839|CDR|I - Come to think of it, I guess we did, now that he recalls it.
2811848|CC|We'd like OMNI Charlie.
2811859|CMP|Okay; you have OMNI Charlie.
2811903|CC|And while you're there, we'd like the UV COVER to OPEN now.
2811911|CMP|Okay; we'll open the UV cover.
2811940|CMP|Okay, Houston. I'm ready to proceed on this pitch maneuver.
2811945|CC|Roger.
2812023|CMP|And, Houston, the readback on the flow controller there. We'll check panel 5. ECS RADIATOR CONTROL circuit breaker AC1, verify it's CLOSED. Then we'll put the ECS FLOW CONTROLLER to position number 1. And we'll turn the ECS FLOW CONTROLLER POWER, OFF, then CENTER.
2812055|CC|It's OFF, CENTER, Ron, and then up to the POWER.
2812100|CMP|Okay. I couldn't figure out my writing. Okay; that's right. The power is OFF, CENTER, and then - back to POWER. Then wait 20 seconds, and put the ECS FLOW CONTROLLER in AUTO.
2812114|CC|That's affirmative.
2812153|CMP|Houston, America. You want to start that now?
2812156|CC|That's affirmative. Any time. And in case you're wondering -
2812159|CMP|Okay.
2812200|CC|- - case you're wondering about that middle step, that's a reset to logic step by going OFF on the POWER and then back to POWER.
2812209|CMP|Okay.
2812223|CMP|Okay. ECS FLOW CONTROLLER is going to position 1. Okay; ECS POWER is OFF, and it's back to POWER. And we're waiting 20 seconds.
2812303|CMP|Okay; FLOW CONTROLLER is going to AUTO now - and stays gray, it looks like.
2812313|CC|That's what we expected. And needless to say, Ron, we'll be watching your ECS system very carefully for you, just in case it flips back. We don't expect any problem.
2812328|CMP|Oh, Okay. Mighty fine.
2812636|CC|And, America, Houston. I've got a midcourse 7 and a MIDPAC entry pad.
2812647|CMP|Okay. Just wait 1, please.
2812650|CC|Roger.
2812921|CC|And, America, Houston. We'd like to bring up the high gain, so we can get the dump going and get the data down. It's a YAW, plus 15; PITCH, 204. Say again. PITCH, plus 15; YAW, 204.
2812932|CMP|Okay. PITCH, 15; YAW, 204.
2812938|CC|Roger.
2813036|CMP|Houston, America.
2813038|CC|Go ahead. Go ahead, America.
2813045|CMP|Okay; I assume this line in here, "Stop pitch rate at 146 degrees," means stop at 146 degrees in pitch. is that correct?
2813056|CC|Roger. Stop at 146 degrees pitch.
2813100|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
2813137|CDR|You've got the high gain, ... told us, Bob.
2813231|CC|And, America, Houston. I've also - besides these pads, I've also got a Flight Plan update. For the first one, item is at 282:10. Either one you want to take first?
2813246|CDR|Okay; why don't you go ahead with the Flight Plan update first.
2813250|CC|Okay, Gene. At 282:10, manually - manual roll left 40 degrees prior to the VERB 49 maneuver. Insert "Manual roll left 40 degrees." And that'll give you a roll angle of 342 prior to starting that maneuver.
2813319|CDR|Okay; I've got it.
2813326|CC|Okay. The next one's quite a ways over. It's at 284:55.
2813338|CDR|Okay; I've got it.
2813340|CC|Okay. First thing at 284:55, we'd like a VERB 48; first register, 11102; second register, 01111.
2813358|CDR|Okay.
2813359|CC|A VERB 49 maneuver to lunar sounder thermal attitude at 285:00. The attitude is PITCH, 122 - say again, ROLL, 122; PITCH, 065; YAW, 047. That's 122, 065, and 047. HIGH GAIN angles with that will be PITCH, minus 24; YAW, 160.
2813440|CDR|Okay. At 285:00, a VERB 49 to ROLL of 122; PITCH, 065; YAW, 047; HIGH GAIN is minus 24 and 160.
2813450|CC|Roger, Gene. And then at 285:10, where we had you write in the "Antenna retract," we want you to delete that. The purpose of the maneuver above that is to heat up those antennas, and we will retract them on a cue from us when we feel the temperatures are warm enough.
2813509|CDR|Okay. What about the "RADAR, OFF" at that point?
2813511|CC|Delete "RADAR, OFF" also.
2813520|CDR|Okay. I've deleted the whole update at 285:10 I had.
2813525|CC|That's affirmative.
2813537|CDR|Bob, Jack's ready to take the pad.
2813541|CC|Okay. They just pointed out there's also VERB 48 at 285:10, which is not applicable either. And, Jack, I've got the MIDPAC area - say again. Let's do the midcourse 7 pad first. MCC7.
2813600|LMP|Go ahead.
2813601|CC|RCS/G&N; 26735; NOUN 48s are not applicable. 301:17:57.78; plus 0001.9, plus 0000.0, minus 0000.1. Roll is 082; pitch, 041; yaw, 331. HA, not applicable. Plus 0022.9; plus 0001.9, 0:04, 0001.9. Sextant star is 31, 328.9, 34.4. Rest of the pad is not applicable. And in case I cut out and came off ray key too fast, back up there in NOUN 81s, that's a plus all zeros for Delta-Vy. Set stars are Sirius and Rigel; 256, 152, 069. It's a four jet; plus-X. Assumes a PTC REFSMMAT. Over.
2813759|LMP|Okay, Bob. I assume that DELTA-Vz plus all zeros also.
2813811|CC|No, I'm sorry. DELTA-Vz was minus all zeros .1 - .1 on DELTA-Vz.
2813828|LMP|Okay; midcourse 7 readback. RCS/G&N; 26735. NOUN 48 is NA. 301:17:57.78; plus 0001.9, plus all zeros, plus 0000.1; 082, 041, 331. HA is NA. Plus 0022.9; 0001.9, 0:04, 0001.9; 31, 328.9, 34.4. Rest of the pad is NA. Sirius and Rigel; 256, 152, 069. Four jet; plus-X. Assumes PCT - TC REFSMMAT.
2813915|CC|Roger, One change. On DELTA-Vz on your NOUN 81s, that should be a minus four balls 1 - minus four balls 1.
2813929|LMP|Roger. Thank you. Minus four balls 1.
2813936|CC|Okay, Jack. That got us warmed up for the MIDPAC area entry pad.
2813942|LMP|Go ahead.
2813944|CC|MIDPAC area; 000, 153, 000; 304:01:37, 268. NOUN 61: minus 17.89, minus 166.13; 06.4; 36090, 6.49; 1047.2, 36172. RRT time: 304:18:37; 00:28. NOUN 69s are nonapplicable.

2814138|LMP|Okay. MIDPAC area; 000, 153, 000; 304:01:37, 268; minus 17.89, minus 166.13; 06.4; 36090, 6.49; 1047.2, 36172; 304:18:37; 00:27. NOUN 69 is NA. 4.00, 02:08; 00:17, 03:37, 07:39; 13, 117.3, 15.5. Boresight is NA. Lift vector, UP. Over.
2814232|CC|Roger. The RET of 0.05G is 00:28 - 00:28.
2814249|LMP|Okay. I'll change that to 28 for RET 0.05G.
2814254|CC|That's right, and I've got one - we've got seven assumptions here on - or comments.
2814305|LMP|Go ahead.
2814307|CC|Comment 1: Use nonexit EMS pattern. Comment 2: RET 90K - -
2814318|LMP|Go ahead, Bob.
2814320|CC|Roger. Comment 2: RET 90K, 06:01. RET mains, 08:26. RET landing, 13:18. Break break. UV COVER, CLOSED, please.
2814352|LMP|Okay; it's CLOSED. And, Bob, you're cutting out every once in a while. I missed your comment 1.
2814357|CC|Okay, Jack, let's try comment 1 over again. Use nonexit EMS pattern. Comment 2: 90K time, 06:01; mains, 08:26; landing, 13:18. Comment 3: Constant g is roll right. Comment 4: GET of moonset, 304:16:13. Comment 5: Assumes midcourse 7, MCC7. Comment 6: Assumes entry REFSMMAT. Comment 7: GDC align for entry REFSMMAT. Stars are Sirius and Rigel. ROLL, 273; PITCH, 256; YAW, 347. Over.
2814533|LMP|Okay, Bob. Somehow I got more than seven, but I'll give you the ones I got. 1: nonexit IMS pattern; 2: RET at 90K is 06:01; 3: mains are 08:06; 4: landing is 13:18; 5: Constant g is a roll right; 6: 304:16:13 is moonset; 7: assumes MCC7; 8: assumes entry REFSMMAT. And 9: GDC align is Sirius and Rigel; 273, 256, and 347.
2814614|CC|Roger. You've got a good readback there, Jack. The reason why is those times are all lumped into comment 2. However you want to do it they're fine.
2814626|LMP|Okay.
2814627|CC|One correction here. RET main times - I thought you read to me 08:26. It is 08:26 is the time on RET mains.
2814640|LMP|Okay. I read 08:06.
2814643|CC|Okay, 08:26. 26 is the time.
2814703|LMP|Okay. I got mains at 08:26.
2814707|CC|Roger, Jack.
2814820|CC|America, Houston. We'd like AUTO on the HIGH GAIN, and we'd like you to do that manual roll and VERB 49 maneuver, which is listed at 282:10. We'd like you to start it now.
2814835|CDR|Okay, Bob.
2814906|CDR|Hey, Bob. I don't think your 342 is going to work out. I've just - Correction, if you will. Roll left. Left 40 degrees coming up.
2814915|CC|Okay. I'm just sitting here, staring at FAO, and asking why it doesn't work out. Let me handle that. That's fine.
2814921|CDR|No, it - Hey, Bob, it will. I was thinking of rolling right. I'm on my way left now, and we will get 342.
2814928|CC|Okay.
2814928|CDR|Close to it. We'll get about - about - let's see now, 20 - whatever - whatever 360 minus 20 is. That's about 342.
2814939|CC|Okay.
2815409|CDR|Okay, Bob. We're there.
2815414|CC|Roger.
2815417|CDR|Bob, I press right on to the VERB 49?
2815425|CC|That's affirmative. Press right on with the VERB 49.
2815434|CC|We're just using this as a little addition here to get more time - more thermal heat on those antennas.
2820040|CC|America, Houston. We'd like OMNI Delta.
2820046|LMP|Okay, Bob. I gave it to you a few minutes ago.
2820054|CC|You got one on INCO that time.
2820100|LMP|The first one.
2820534|CC|America, Houston. We'd like UV COVER, OPEN, please.
2820601|CMP|Okay; it's OPEN.
2820607|CC|America, Houston. We'd like ACCEPT. We've got a state vector that goes with those pads we've called up.
2820615|CDR|Okay, Bob. You've got ACCEPT.
2820618|CC|And you can get into the Flight Plan. We gave you about a 15-minute bonus on your eat period there. You can jump right into the eat period if you want.
2820626|CDR|Okay. Thank you, Houston.
2820921|CC|America, Houston. The computer is yours.
2820927|CDR|Thank you, Houston.
2822525|CC|America, Houston. This is for Ron. It looks like one of your sensors may have come loose. We're getting bad data. And don't interrupt your eating but when you get a chance you might try and push them on or service them or whatever needs to be done.
2822540|LMP|Okay, he'll get it. is it by any chance printing upside down?
2822551|CC|No, it's correct according to the - -
2822553|CMP|I'm upside down in the tunnel.
2822553|CC|- - doctor. Okay. (Laughter) Do you like eating that way? is that the new trick?
2822604|LMP|I don't see how his family is going to live with him.
2822609|CMP|We're not going to be able to do that for very much longer, you know.
2822614|CC|About 21 hours and 52 minutes.
2822714|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 282:27 Ground Elapsed Time in the Apollo 17 Mission. 21 hours 51 minutes until reentry into the Earth's atmosphere tomorrow afternoon in the South Pacific. The crew, presently, is in the evening meal. Just after the completion of this eat period is the great press conference in the sky, starting at approximately 5:00 Central Time with the onboard TV turned on. Earlier in the afternocn the initial midcourse 7 numbers were read up to the crew. Ah, for Ground Elapsed Time of ignition at 301:17 velocity change of 1.9 feet per second. Also, the initial entry times and the post-entry event times were passed up to the crew assuming that midcourse correction burn number 7 is performed. Presently the spacecraft is 101,703 nautical miles out from Earth. Velocity gradually building now, 5,080 feet per second. Flight path angle staying at about minus 6.49 degrees in the present tracking. Current numbers on entry interface Ground Elapsed Time of 304:18:37. There will not be a change of shift press conference for the off going Gold Team. And at 282:29 Ground Elapsed Time this is Apollo Control.
2825108|PAO|This is Apollo control at 282 hours 51 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 17 now 21 hours and 27 minutes away from splashdown, or actually entry back into the Earth's atmosphere, tomorrow afternoon in the south central Pacific. Presently, 100,586 nautical miles out from the Earth streaking in at a velocity of 5,126 feet per second which will build up at the time of collision with the atmosphere to about 36,100 feet per second. The entry tomorrow afternoon will take place at approximately 304 hours 18 minutes Ground Elapsed Time which is about 1:11 Central Standard Time and at 282 hours 52 minutes Ground Elapsed Time in the mission of Apollo 17, this is Apollo control.
2825625|CMP|Houston, America.
2825628|CC|Go ahead.
2825631|CMP|Okay, Bob. I've kind of fiddled around with the sensors, now. Are they working okay now?
2825639|CC|Stand by, Ron. Ron, your sensors look good, right at the moment.
2825703|CMP|Okay. Good enough.
2830254|LMP|Hey, Houston; 17.
2830258|CC|Go ahead, 17.
2830301|LMP|Yes, we'd like to run a check here on this TV setup. Are we going to disturb you if we go to TV on the S-BAND AUX switch?
2830312|CC|Stand by on that. Let me check with OSO.
2830325|LMP|And, Bob, if it is an inconvenience, could you look ahead and find the time we can have 10 or 15 minutes, if possible, to work this out.
2830336|CC|Roger.
2830741|CC|America, Houston.
2830745|LMP|Go ahead.
2830746|CC|You can have the TV switch to TV for about 35 minutes starting right now, if you'd like. And, while while - if you're working around there, we would like to take BATTERY A off the CHARGE and put BATTERY B on CHARGE.
2830805|LMP|Okay, it's in work. And, we probably won't need it for that long. And, we'll get back with you as soon as we can.
2830814|CC|Roger.
2830818|LMP|Okay; we're in TV now.
2830959|LMP|Okay, Bob, BATTERY B is on CHARGE and 7 Alfa reads 1.3.
2831010|CC|Roger. We got that.
2831555|PAO|This is Apollo control at 283 hours 16 minutes. We've completed a shift handover in mission control. Flight Director for this shift is Charles Lewis the spacecraft communicator astronaut Gordon Fullerton. The crew is completing their meal at this time and beginning preparations for the televised press conference which is to begin at 5 p.m. Central Standard Time. Apollo 17 at this time is traveling at a velocity of 5,178 feet per second just under one mile per second and is 99,350 nautical miles from Earth.
2831835|CDR|Okay, Bob, I'm going to pick up the manual roll right for the VERB 49.
2831842|CC|Okay, Geno. You've got a new capcom now. Good evening.
2831847|CDR|Good evening, Gordo. How are you doing?
2831850|CC|Real fine. How about you?
2831853|CDR|Very fine. I'm going right for my VERB 49 maneuver, now.
2831859|CC|Okay.
2832035|CC|America, Houston. We need OMNI Charlie, please.
2832712|CC|America, Houston. Suggest you try to get the HIGH GAIN up at a PITCH of 10; YAW, 210.
2832723|CMP|PITCH, 10; and YAW, 210; okay.
2832727|CC|Roger.
2834009|CC|America, Houston. We've filled up the DSE with science data. And, so if you're through with the TV rehearsal, we'd like the AUX band - the S-BAND AUX switch back to SCIENCE, so we can get the rest of the data real time.
2834026|LMP|Okay. We just finished and going to SCIENCE.
2834029|CC|Roger. Thank you.
2835428|CDR|Hello, Houston. America.
2835431|CC|Go ahead.
2835434|CDR|Gordy, how far out are we?
2835438|CC|How far out? 100,000 miles, approximately.
2835443|CDR|Okay. Thank you.
2835807|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 283 hours 58 minutes. And we're about 9 minutes now from the start of the televised Press Conference with the Apollo 17 crew. The network controller has checked out the lines from Goldstone, California to Houston.
2835822|CC|America, Houston. A little more precise answer. You're 97,500 miles, and you passed the halfway point about 2 hours ago. And we're going to have a site handover here on the hour.
2835838|LMP|Got all that, Gordy. Thank you.
2835908|PAO|The television pictures from the spacecraft will be received at the 210 foot dish antenna at Goldstone, California and relayed to Houston.
2840426|CDR|Hello, Houston; America.
2840428|CC|Go ahead, America.
2840431|CDR|We'll stand by for your call to power up the TV.
2840435|CC|Roger.
2840514|CC|America, Houston. We're ready for TV.
2840521|LMP|Roger, Gordy.
2840636|CDR|Okay. We're going to TRANSMIT on the TV now.
2840639|CC|Roger.
2840643|CDR|And let us know when you've got a picture.
2840646|CC|Will do.
2840714|CC|American, Houston. We've got a picture. Looks good, looks in focus, and we see the flag in the patch.
2840723|CDR|Okay.
2840835|LMP|Houston, here's the crew of Apollo - Apollo 17, Spaceship America.
2840841|CC|Roger, Apollo 17. If you're ready for the questioning, I'll begin.
2840849|LMP|Go ahead, Gordo.
2840852|CC|Okay. As usual in these inflight news conferences, the questions that will be asked of you were prepared by correspondents covering the Apollo 17 mission at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston. They will be read exactly as written and in the order determined by the newsmen. The first question is for Jack Schmitt. If you, as a geologist, were coming home from a field trip on Earth, you'd be drafting a preliminary report and discussing it with fellow geologists. In terms understandable to laymen, can you summarize what you would be saying in your preliminary report about your field trip to Taurus-Littrow?
2840936|LMP|Well, I'll - I'll give that a try, Gordy. I think the thing we had hoped to accomplish at Taurus-Littrow was to look at a - as broad a spectrum of the history of the Moon as possible in one small area, as the concluding flight to the Apollo Program. And I think we did that. I think we had look - did look at some of the oldest rocks that it is possible to see with our capability in the breccias of the South and North Massifs. I think we saw some intermediate-age rocks of fairly unexpected character, I believe, in the subfloor crystalline or igneous rocks, the gabbro, as we called them there. And we also understood, I think, that those rocks, in fact, had intruded into the breccias of the North Massif. We found, I believe, in the - at the Crater Van Serg, on the third EVA, that the regolith, or the garden zone, on the top of that subfloor gabbro, or the igneous rocks, was quite thick, or appears to be very thick, which is an expected result, and will - hopefully, those rocks will have much information about a fairly extended period of lunar erosion. And, we found that there was indeed a dark mantle over the area of - variable thickness; but, apparently, of relatively recent age, and that in turn had a light mantle of material of which we do not yet understand, and I think that the samples are going to have to tell that story. It may well be a land slide that has come off the South Massif. And, then, possibly as important as any finding, we found that even later than that relatively young light mantle deposit are avalanche - possible avalanche - we have alteration reminiscent of the alteration by hot waters or hot gases on Earth, and that was the orange - appears to be the orange soil that we found around the Crater Shorty. And, subsequently, in orbit we started to pick up, and particularly through Ron Evans' efforts, pick up more and more of the apparent evidence of such alteration taking place in fairly recent time on the Moon. All of those items, I think, are extremely significant and go through the full range of our present knowledge of lunar history. And, a report I would write would initially summarize that particular sequence of events.
2841243|CC|Question number 2 is for Jack, again. What other probable explanations, besides volcanic origins, do you have for the orange rock and colored soil that you found at Shorty Crater?
2841258|LMP|Well, they don't necessarily have to be volcanic, Gordy. I refer to them as alteration, and much of the hydrothermal, or hot water, alteration we see on Earth is related to recent volcanism, or ancient volcanism; but, also, we know of that kind of alteration of preexisting materials to take place as a result of - of just fluids working their way up through the Earth's crust, and I presume that such a process is also possible on the Moon. The ones we saw seem to be associated with areas of dark mantle, of various types, and most of the photographic evidence we have is that those dark mantle deposits are associated with volcanism, but it is not necessarily proved yet, I believe, that the - the orange soils or the alterations we've seen are volcanic. However, the process would be a related process, that is, one of internal origin.
2841401|CC|The third question is for Cernan or Schmitt. Your voices are so much alike that it is unclear to some of us which one of you found the orange rock and who first spotted the layer of orange soil on the crater rim.
2841417|CDR|Jack found it. He uncovered it as he was walking on the rim, and we worked with that, and then, as I went around the crater to take the stereo base pan from within the crater, I could see alterations radially down from the rim farther beyond where we were working down to the center.
2841438|LMP|I don't think that that question of who found it is as specifically as important as that that we were there with the equipment and the training jointly to not only recognize that but to take advantage of having recognized it, and I hope that we did.
2841457|CC|Okay. The next one's for Ron Evans. Why do you think you were able to see so much orange material from lunar orbit, after your partners had found some on the ground, where none of the previous Apollo crews reported seeing anything but grays, tans, and browns?
2841517|CMP|Well, I think, for one thing, that we were in, essentially, a different orbit than some of the other crews that had been up there before. And even though each of us has a color tone in our own eyes, what we come up with, I think, is a function pretty much of what you'd like to believe and what you'd like to see out of things. If you feel it has a tint of orange with it, and this is in a new area that we really haven't flown over that much, and this is primarily - where we were seeing this type of thing was on the western rim of Serenitatis, and some of the - well, at least it looks like known volcanic deposits along the rim of Serenitatis.
2841609|LMP|Gordy, let me add quickly that there's no such thing as a truly objective observer; and, I believe, that once you start looking for something, and when Ron heard about what we were doing, I'm sure he started looking, himself, to see what we had seen. That leads you to see things. Now that's not seeing things that are not there. It makes you look for things that are there, and that's extremely important; and that's where the kind of training all three of us have had and I think has made it possible for us to find a lot of things that might not otherwise have been found.
2841648|CC|Here's one addressed to all three crewmen. What will you remember most about this mission?
2841659|CDR|Boy, that's a loaded question, Gordy. There's so many things, but I think probably the thing that - when I think about it - that will stick with me most is the same thing that stuck with me - for my last two missions - not so much being there, but it's getting the chance to get home and share what you've seen and what you've done with other people.
2841723|CMP|I think in my case, the lift-off itself was something brand new for me. It's something beyond - The booster ride itself was something beyond what I could really comprehend. So, I think that's - oh, it's a very important part of it. I will always remember that part of it. But I'm kind of like with Gene; I feel that even though the three of us have been up here and had the opportunity to observe the Moon, look at what we could find and that type of thing, I think that we have an obligation to share our experiences with the rest of the people.
2841804|LMP|Well, Gordy, that is a difficult question. It has been a fascinating experience from so many detailed aspects. I guess, generally speaking, the thing I carry back with me, I hope, is an increased perspective not only for the history of the solar system, but I hope for the future of mankind within that solar system.
2841831|CDR|Gordy, this doesn't mean that that last 50,000 feet won't stick in my mind for a long time.
2841839|CC|Roger, Gene. Again for all three crewmen. Now that you are returning home from what may be the last lunar exploration of this century, what short-range and long-range plans do each of you have for the future?
2841857|CDR|Well, my short-range plans are certainly to enjoy Christmas with my family, think about the flight, get its data down on paper. My long-range plans are to turn around and look at the next flight whenever that may be and put my efforts and experience toward that flight and get to work on it.
2841923|CMP|I think my short-range plans - of course, first of all tomorrow I want to make a real good reentry, and that's kind of the real short-range part of it. From that point on, as I mentioned before, I think we have a responsibility, at least, I feel we have responsibilities to share our experiences with the rest of the people not only in the United States, but with the people of the rest of the world. Beyond that, I also have a strong desire to continue participating in manned space flight in whatever capacity that I might be able to.
2842004|LMP|Well, I can do nothing but echo Gene and Ron's words and maybe add, Gordy, that I hope that through the next few years I'll be able to make some contributions that guarantee that this Apollo 17 flight is not the last exploration program in this century in space.
2842027|CC|Again, for all the crew. Throughout the mission there were periodic reports from each of you about gastric distress in one form or another. Does this trouble make you think that the three Skylab missions of 28, 56, and 56 days scheduled for next year are too ambitious?
2842047|CDR|No, not at all. I don't think they are too ambitious, Gordy. I think that's the reason we're flying each and every one of these flights one at a time. To find out if there really are potential problems in diet or what have you, and I think we solved a lot of them from Apollo 15 and 16, and those few that we had I'm sure we can solve, accordingly, prior to Skylab flying.
2842112|CMP|I don't think I can add anything to that.
2842116|LMP|I think we've made a big improvement over the problems that occurred on Apollo 16, and I think as a result of our observations in conjunction with the medical people, primarily at NASA, that solution - a very clear solution will be found for Skylab and any other mission we want to fly.
2842137|CC|Okay. For Ron Evans. You seemed almost euphoric during your space walk yesterday, and other space walkers before you seemed to have had this same reaction to the experience. Can you describe what it was like and how it made you feel?
2842159|CMP|Well, I think for those of you who had the opportunity to watch yesterday, it is pretty obvious how I felt out there. I'm not sure euphoric is the word. I - it's an opportunity - Well, to me I guess it was an opportunity to be what I call a "real space man." And - you're out there in the deepness of space, with nothing there but your spacesuit on, and you're doing the job that has to be done. And we're riding around in space out here, and this is in a capsule and we look out the window, you know, but it's nice firm feeling. It's a solidly built vehicle, and you get the zero g effect on the thing, but you don't get the feeling of - really getting out and walking in space. And once I became accustomed to what it was like in the EVA environment, then you relax and you take it easy, you try to accomplish what you can and observe what you can and really enjoy it. And I think I really enjoyed it.
2842310|LMP|I had a hold of his umbilical most of that time and I didn't notice that he was ready to jump out into space, if that's the kind of euphoria you're talking about.
2842321|CC|Okay. For Eugene Cernan and any other later comments. You talked a lot about this mission being the end of the beginning, but a lot of people don't agree. Recognizing the United States is stopping lunar exporation for the forseeable future, how do you feel?
2842343|CDR|When we look back at the Apollo Program I don't think anyone can privately to themselves and publicly say that this truly, indeed has really been a beginning - a beginning of man's really first venture out into deep space. And once there's a beginning, there's a continuation. The probing into deep space by man, the next landing on the Moon, a trip to Mars may not be for 10 years, a decade; it may not be until the end of this century. But I personally have faith that it will happen. I think it's a restraint, an abnormal restraint of man's intellect at this point in time to restrict or tend to think that he will restrict his own feeling of exploration, his own quest for knowledge. He's had an opportunity. He's proved that he could take advantage of this opportunity, and I think that the nature of mankind is going to just press on. That's why I believe not - we of Apollo 17 - yes, it's a beginning; but the whole Apollo Program is really the true beginning of what's to come in the future. And I firmly believe that. We can look back in a 100 years or 200 years and the 5-year or 10-year period of time, we may be slowed down here. I think we'll be - we'll be lost in the merit of what is really accomplished during the next several decades.
2842512|CC|The next question is for all the crew. The American people seem to be getting fairly blase about space flight and television coverage of Apollo 17 has been at a minimum. But this is not the case abroad. For example, in the Republic of Zaire, the former Belgian Congo, an estimated 20 million people are watching extensive coverage on TV sets set up in the villages. What do you have to say to the people of underdeveloped nations?
2842546|LMP|Well, Gordy, first of all, I'm not sure that the amount of television coverage is necessarily a measure of the interest of the American people. I don't have those figures at hand. I'm sorry to hear that the adventures we had and the insight that maybe we gained into not only ourselves, but to the history of the solar system was not shared extensively with the American people, if that's true. As far as the rest of the world is concerned, and also the people of the United States who may not participate as much in the affluence that we all would like to share, I think that's what space flight in general and the Apollo Program in particular has offered, is many new avenues from which we can provide for those people abroad and for our own people, the kind of quality of life and the material - including the material quality of life that everybody aspires to. I think, we've just begun the adventure of understanding how - what we've learned and how we've learned to do it in space can be applied to these particular kinds of problems. That is one of the great challenges that I think NASA and other agencies within the United States Government and other governments abroad have, is to use this base of technological information now for their own people.
2842721|CDR|I'd like to just add to that very briefly, Gordy, that America has led the way into space in the past. I believe we will in the future. But, a point I tried to get across, several days earlier in this flight, is that the real promise of the future for all the peoples of the Earth is to weld themselves into a coherent group of people who can live and work together and then enjoy all the benefits and all the knowledge that is to come from future space explorations. I think we are doing this not just as Americans but as human beings and everyone throughout these countries throughout the world who are watching us right now are also human beings no different than we are. It's their accomplishment as well as it is ours.
2842814|CC|Question 11 is for Jack. Do you think the United States waited too long to send a geologist to the Moon?
2842826|LMP|We're grinning because I think we predicted that question. Gordy, I think the United States waited too long to go into space in the first place, and I think they're probably going to wait too long to go back. I will always feel that way no matter who goes or what qualifications he may have or may think he has. I think that the most important thing that maybe I have done is to - to be able to show that we can build a transportation system that allows you to fly people of a wide variety of disciplines. And I think that we have shown that, and I think that it's occurred at about as soon as possible within the Apollo Program.
2842911|CC|The last couple of questions are in a lighter vein for Ron Evans. There has been a lot of discussion about missing a pair of scissors in the command module. Who really lost the scissors?
2842927|CMP|Well, I think it must have been one of those other guys because I was asleep and I got up the next morning and it was gone.
2842932|LMP|Didn't happen on my watch.
2842938|CC|And also, Ron, did the squeaking of those mice onboard keep you awake?
2842948|CMP|No, the mice really didn't - there are plenty of other things going on inside the spacecraft here that we can hardly even hear the mice. As a matter of fact I really haven't heard them yet.
2843006|CC|Okay. This completes the list of questions as submitted by the newsmen here in Houston. There are a little less than 7 minutes left on our scheduled time for any other further remarks you might like to make.
2843021|CDR|Yes, Gordy, I think we'd like to take this opportunity to each say a word or two.
2843028|LMP|Well, just briefly, Gordy, I feel that I have done something that's fairly significant here in my life. I hope that - and will do everything I can to see that it is not the most significant thing I ever do. But, I feel that the fact that I had the opportunity is due in a large part to the tangible and intangible effects that my mother and father had on my life and to them I send my thanks and I hope that I continue to live up to their expectations.
2843111|CMP|You know on Apollo 17, here, we've had two outstanding vehicles and that's the - don't let me get you wrong, I'm not discounting the booster either. But, I've watched a lot of people work on a lot of spacecraft, and I'm very proud to be able to say that all of the vehicles that have been associated with Apollo 17 have been outstanding. And, the reason they are outstanding is because of the people that have been working on them. And, I'd like to give our thanks and a "well-done" to people who worked on our spacecraft.
2843153|CDR|Gordy, prior to leaving and I guess I can certainly assume during the flight we've carried many, many well wishes and carried many prayers aboard from people throughout the world. I personally believe that those prayers played no small part in any success that we were able to achieve on this flight. I ask those people, however, to continue their prayers in particular for some of our friends and some of our comrades who are still in southeast Asia - POWs, MIAs who may not - although God willing I hope they will - but who may not have the opportunities to get home and enjoy the Christmas that we're looking forward to. And with that from Apollo 17 spacecraft America on December 18, 1972, we all wish you a very, very Merry Christmas and a happy holiday season. Godspeed and God bless you all.
2843308|CC|Thank you, guys. That was a good show. We enjoyed every minute.
2843442|LMP|Okay, Gordy. I presume you want to go back to SCIENCE in the comm configuration, and we're getting squared away here for a big VERB 48.
2843454|CC|Okay. That's affirmative. Back to SCIENCE, please.
2843849|CDR|Gordy, if you like, I'll go ahead and maneuver now.
2843855|CC|No. We want to hold the manuver until 55.
2843903|CDR|Okay.
2844507|CC|America, Houston.
2844510|LMP|Go ahead.
2844512|CC|Okay. We're ready to go with that VERB 48 and then the VERB 49 as listed a little bit early here. That'll put us in the hot-soak attitude.
2844523|CDR|Okay, Gordo. Be with you in about 30 seconds.
2844526|CC|Okay.
2844721|CDR|Houston, America is on her way.
2844724|CC|Okeydoke.
2845248|LMP|Houston, 17's getting the high gain up, if you want it.
2845256|CC|Yes. We think we're already on it, Jack.
2845259|LMP|Well, I meant to have the other angles.
2845317|CC|I think you can just leave it alone. It is holding from - during the maneuver and should hold until the end of it.
2845325|LMP|Okay. Good maneuvers. Over, Gordy.
2845328|CC|Roger.
2845331|LMP|Now we're even.
2845352|CDR|Hello, Houston, America.
2845354|CC|Go ahead.
2845358|CDR|Okay, Gordy. With these relatively fixed attitudes most of the afternoon, we got the - the tunnel about totally dry, but the forward hatch is awful wet. I just thought I'd throw that out.
2845413|CC|Okay.
2851422|PAO|This is Apollo control at 285 hours 14 minutes. At the present time in mission control we've got a group of engineers, from the crew systems division, clustered around the capcom console going over a set of recommended procedures which capcom Gordon Fullerton will be discussing with Ron Evans for fixing his communications carrier, the so called Snoopy hat, that the crew wears that has the earphones and microphone attachments built in. Evans reported several days ago that the comm carrier - communications carrier was intermittant and last night he took it apart looked inside and found that in fact a couple of wires had broken and made a temporary fix. The procedures that we'll be reading up to him are to ensure that in so far as possible that the Snoopy hat communications carrier is fixed up to work properly during entry. If for some reason the Snoopy hat carrier couldn't be used Evans would plan to wear the light weight headset using the Snoopy hat to hold it in position but the preferable arrangement during entry would be to have a working comm carrier built into the Snoopy hat. Apollo 17 at this time is 93,270 nautical miles from Earth. And the speed is 5,444 feet per second.
2851654|CDR|Houston, America. If you're ready, we'll maneuver.
2851703|CC|Stand by; we're checking.
2851722|CC|Not yet. Temperatures aren't up as high as they'd like. We'd like to hold 5 minutes at least.
2851729|CDR|Okay; we'll just stand by for your call on the maneuver.
2851733|CC|Okay.
2852427|PAO|This is Apollo control at 285 hours 24 minutes. Here in mission control we're at the present time being paid a visit by a jolly gentleman in red cap and coat with white whiskers who is going around the room dispensing things from a bag of goodies.
2852508|PAO|For flight director Chuck Lewis out of Santa's bag is a toy flight directors console for Skylab complete with spinners.
2852548|PAO|A can of Skylab food for capcom Gordon Fullerton.
2852555|CC|America, Houston.
2852559|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
2852602|CC|You guys aren't going to believe this, but Santa Claus just walked in the MOCR with a long white beard, red suit, black boots and all, and he's passing out presents to everybody.
2852614|LMP|How did he get there before we did? We just saw him up here about 5 - 5 days ago.
2852621|CC|Well, he beat you back.
2852624|CDR|Gordy, I'd - I'd believe anything. Has he got anything with our name on it?
2852631|CC|I'll ask him. I don't see anything yet.
2852710|CC|America, Houston. You can go ahead and start the VERB 49 maneuver. Have a change in the high gain angles, though, as printed there. Make it a plus 30 and 190, instead of minus 40 and 90. That's a plus 30 and 190 on the high gain.
2852731|CDR|Okay, I got them, Gordy.
2852744|PAO|Flight Surgeon, John Ziegelschmitt, received a small telephone for private conversations out of Santa's bag,
2852753|LMP|Gordy, when you get a minute, would you ask one of the Surgeons there what my heart rate peaked out at in the last 15 minutes or so?
2852802|CC|Okay, I'll do that. I'm just looking at some of the presents here. Mine was a little Skylab food can - flip-top can. It says, "CAPCOM's Postflight Dinner." And I'm pretty sure there's absolutely nothing in it, but I'm afraid to pull the lid off. The Surgeon's got a little plastic telephone that says "For Private Conversations Only."
2852827|LMP|(Laughter)
2852835|CC|And your heart rate went to - -
2852835|LMP|I'd be more worried about what might be - -
2852838|CC|Your heart - -
2852838|LMP|Ought to be more worried about what might be in that can, Gordy.
2852842|CC|(Chuckle) Yes, I am. Geno's heart rate peaked at 115 to 120.
2852852|LMP|Okay, what did the LMP's peak at? He wasn't doing anything.
2852856|CDR|I'm not even on biomed, as a matter of fact, Gordy.
2852859|CC|Oh, I'm sorry. My mistake. (Chuckle) Not the Surgeon's. That was the LMP's.
2852919|CC|Stovall, on the front row there, got a little shovellike gadget with a sign on it that says "Trenching Tool."
2852929|LMP|Beautiful. (Laughter)
2852932|CDR|I thought they might give him a coin. A flipable coin.
2852955|CC|He's got a coin like that. It says "CSM Active" on both sides.
2853002|CDR|Yes, that's what I figured.
2853524|CC|America, Houston. We're ready for a spinup now.
2853528|LMP|Okay.
2853715|CDR|We're spinning, Gordy.
2853716|CC|Okay. It's looking good.
2855453|CC|America, Houston. We'd like to throw a few switches on panel 230 and try to get the HF antennas retracted. Over.
2855503|LMP|Okay. Go ahead.
2855505|CC|Okay. First of all, RADAR - OFF.
2855513|LMP|Okay, Gordy, the RADAR is OFF.
2855518|CC|Okay; then HF ANTENNA number 2, RETRACT. And give us a mark, please. It should take about a little over 2 minutes.
2855528|LMP|Okay, going to RETRACT -
2855530|LMP|MARK it. Oh, HF-2? Gordy, I started 1. I'm sorry.
2855537|CC|That's all right. Keep it. It doesn't matter; just keep working on 1 there. Keep it in RETRACT
2855544|LMP|Okay, it's in RETRACT - and stayed there.
2855740|CC|America, Houston. As you come up on roll of 30, we'd like you to - Okay, break, break - we would like the ANTENNA 1 switched to OFF now.
2855754|LMP|It is OFF.
2855757|CC|And we got a good retract. Okay, for the guy on the - -
2855801|LMP|Gordy?
2855804|CC|Go ahead.
2855805|LMP|It was still barber pole when I went to OFF.
2855810|CC|Okay, that's the one we had trouble with before. That's what we expected. Okay, you can go number 2 to RETRACT now.
2855825|LMP|Okay, number 2 - RETRACT -
2855829|LMP|MARK.
2855831|CC|Okay, and for whoever is driving the spaceship there, we'd like to stop the roll - stop the PTC at a roll angle of 30 instead of what's in the Flight Plan. That's 30 degrees. And you're passing through 73 right now. Over.
2855849|CDR|Okay, Gordy. I got it. I'm looking at NOUN 20. We'll stop it at 30.
2855853|CC|Okay, and I have different high gains to go with that attitude. They'll be minus 24 and 206.
2855906|CDR|Okay. We got them.
2860053|CC|Jack, Houston. You should be retracted now and have a gray. And you can go OFF if you do.
2860059|LMP|That's affirm and congratulations.
2860105|LMP|And the switch is OFF.
2860106|CC|Okay, and those high gain angles I passed you are probably misleading. It looks like the high gain ought to just hang on when you stop this maneuver.
2860117|LMP|Okay.
2860127|CC|America, Houston. It'll be about 5 or 6 minutes until we finish the dump before we can go ahead with that VERB 49, in case you got something to do.
2860237|CDR|Okay, Gordy. Thank you.
2860950|CC|Okay, America. We're ready for the maneuver now.
2860955|CDR|Okay, Houston. Here she comes.
2861014|CDR|America is on her way again.
2861016|CC|Okay.
2861024|CDR|Gordo, I see two DAP changes here. You want to change this one during the maneuver or - after the maneuver - and then the next one before the next maneuver?
2861055|CC|We want the DAP load after you get to attitude and then the other DAP load before you start the next maneuver.
2861103|CDR|Sounds - that sounds good here. Okay.
2861208|CC|America, Houston. We need the UV cover closed. The Sun's getting in there.
2861216|LMP|CLOSED, Gordy.
2861217|CC|Thank you.
2861443|CC|We should be safe now. Open the UV cover, please.
2861505|LMP|Gordy, it's OPEN.
2861507|CC|Thank you.
2861513|LMP|Doesn't it bother you to wield such power, Gordy?
2861519|CC|I'm getting accustomed to it.
2861824|LMP|Gordy, for the first time in seemingly several days, we see the Earth.
2861832|CC|Roger. Standing by for a weather report.
2861840|LMP|(Laughter) Afraid I don't know whether or not there's any weather down there.
2861857|CC|Guess you can't see too much of it, huh?
2861902|LMP|No, sir. You're down to a fingernail, if you'll pardon the expression. It - Oh, let's see - it's about a - what do you think, Gene? - about a one-eighth Earth - one-sixth to one-eighth Earth?
2861923|LMP|Got picture, Ron. (Chuckle) You can see it later. (Laughter)
2862636|CDR|Hello, Houston; America.
2862638|CC|Go ahead.
2862641|CDR|Okay, Gordo, 286:52 on the Flight Plan and 287:40 - is there an update on that? CMP put his biomed harness on - oh, I guess 4 to 6 hours ago.
2862701|CC|Yes, let me check on that. I - There was something on this when I left last night, but I'll have to get the latest here.
2862712|CDR|Okay.
2863426|CC|America, we're ready now for the steps at 1 - 286:43 - CMC MODE - FREE and AUTO. VERB 48, VERB 49, and so forth. On the biomed, we're going to leave it up to you. Whoever - draw straws or whatever - whoever you decide to wear the biomed tonight, it's your choice.
2863453|CDR|That's easy. Jack and I will put it on in the morning. How's that?
2863458|CC|Okay.
2863513|CMP|You get to watch Captain America tonight then.
2863518|CC|Okay, Captain.
2863736|CC|America, Houston. We'd like OMNI Alfa.
2863944|CC|America, Houston. We can take the high gain now that you're there. The angles in the book, minus 37 and 48 and AUTO.
2864443|CC|America, Houston. We're ready for VERB 74.
2864451|CDR|Coming at you, Gordo.
2864452|CDR|MARK it.
2864747|CC|Okay, we got a good dump. Thank you.
2864753|CMP|Okeydoke.
2865731|CC|America, Houston; over.
2865736|CDR|Go ahead.
2865737|CC|Okay. We've been thinking about the - the busted Snoopy hat and have a suggestion on a - on a configuration that we'd like to present to you as an alternative to the plan you mentioned earlier. See what you think about it.
2865759|CDR|Hey, Gordo.
2865800|CC|Go ahead.
2865801|CDR|Can - can you hold off with that update? Ron's off the headset right now, and it'll be a few minutes. And I'd like to hear him - have him hear that.
2865810|CC|Okay. And just as a brief introduction before he gets on, we're really thinking about letting Jack have the broken one. Nothing personal, Jack, but think that it's probably more important that you and Ron have the - the all-up ones. Over.
2865831|CDR|Yes, we've already discussed that, but let - let Ron talk over with what his plan is, and let's hear yours.
2865838|CC|Okay, give me a call when you're ready.
2865841|CDR|Okay. And for food for thought, you might think about that. We looked at a way of just taping the electronic part of the lightweight headset right to - to his helmet. It looked pretty good. So chew on that one for a while, and we'll be back with you and you can come up with your plan.
2865858|CC|Yes, that sounds like that's - that's our plan, essentially, but I'll go through it in case there's anything that either you or us haven't thought of about it.
2865909|CDR|Okay.
2870203|CC|America, Houston.
2870207|LMP|Go ahead.
2870208|CC|We'd like to give you what EECOM has said should be the final H2 fan configuration for this mission. H2 FAN 2, OFF, and 3, AUTO.
2870226|LMP|Okay, H2 FAN 2 is going OFF, and 3 to AUTO. And this is truly a historic event.
2870238|CC|It's been a pleasure to share it with you, Jack.
2870239|CDR|Isn't that the way we started? Isn't that the way we started?
2870245|CC|I think it is. Affirm.
2870249|LMP|Very appropriate, my congratulations and my hat off to the EECOM.
2870257|CC|Thank you, sir.
2870356|CC|America, Houston. We'd like you to spin it up on B-2 and D-2, and we have one change in the HIGH GAIN REACQ and NARROW angles. Instead of a YAW of 90, we want a YAW of 45.
2870419|CDR|Okay, I'll set them at a YAW of 45.
2870426|CC|Roger.
2870508|CC|You probably weren't aware of it, but your IR is chilly. Would you turn it on up until bedtime to warm it up a little, please?
2870521|CDR|Okay, that's only - that's only appropriate. IR is ON.
2870532|CC|Roger.
2870546|CMP|Okay, Gordy. I just spun up America for you.
2870551|CC|Thank you.
2873208|PAO|Apollo control at 287 hours 32 minutes. It's been a relatively quiet period in the control center and aboard the spacecraft. Apollo 17, at the present time, is rotating slowly about the X axis with its ultraviolet spectrometer pointed toward Scolatic sources of ultraviolet. The crew will be conducting some housekeeping activities aboard the spacecraft changing the lithium hydroxide canisters. They have one more eat period before retiring for an 8 hour rest period at 290 hours even. And, we're now showing some 16 hours 45 minutes until Apollo 17 enters Earth atmosphere. The spacecraft now 85,800 nautical miles from Earth, and velocity increasing to 5,795 feet per second.
2874403|CMP|Houston, America. The - the CMP is in biomed.
2874410|CC|Okay, CMP.
2874415|CMP|Very good.
2874421|CC|This probably isn't too good a time to have an emergency.
2874426|CMP|(Laughter)
2874428|CC|The reason I say that is we got a big Chinese feast going on here in the MOCR.
2874435|CMP|(Laughter) Oh, you do?
2874437|CC|Had some food brought in, and everybody's probably more interested in eating than the America right now, I must admit.
2874446|CMP|(Laughter) Uh-oh.
2874517|CMP|Houston, America. How's the delivery girl situation? Is it as good as it used to be?
2874522|CC|Oh, yes. Better, if anything.
2874526|CMP|Outstanding.
2874622|CC|Ron, I have some words on our suggestion, probably the same as what you've done already on rigging up the headsets for - for entry tomorrow any time you have a free moment to listen.
2874637|CMP|Oh, sure. Go ahead. I'm just sitting here right now.
2874642|CC|Okay. Geno mentioned that you'd already essentially taped the electronic part to your Snoopy hat. I guess, first of all, we're suggesting that you rig - rig this up for Jack, and let you have the good one just to be sure. And I'll - I'll quickly run through the steps we have. I think maybe this will be the easiest way. And you can then listen and if you've done it already or if you - if this mentions something that you haven't thought of, it'll at least accomplish the job. They have about 15 steps here, but I don't think it'll take long to summarize it. They suggest taking the headband off the lightweight headset; in other words, taking the electronic part off the headband, straighten the mike boom, and straighten the - the comm carrier boom, the appropriate one for whichever ear Jack wears his molded earpiece in, then rotate the lightweight headset mike boom 90 degrees. They found that was necessary to get it to face your mouth when - when you end up with this all taped on there. You have to sort of twist it, force it 90 degrees. Then lay the lightweight headset boom along the comm carrier boom with the electronic part on the outside of your - your earpiece on the Snoopy hat. And the - the hose that goes to the molded earpiece facing downward coming out down and with the - the mike boom 1 inch beyond the comm carrier mike boom tip. And then tape the two booms together for the entire length of the comm carrier boom. And then rebend the whole works back so that the tip is back in front of your mouth. And then tape the electronics box onto the side of the earpiece, and you can run tape all the way around the lower part of the earpiece, and you can lift up on the leather-covered doughnuts on the inside there, pull that loose and then run tape underneath. Just pull the lower part of it loose, run tape all the way around to really securely anchor the electronics box to the outside of the - the earpiece so there's no chance that that will slip off or shift. Then you can kind of push the leather earseal back down on top of the tape inside. Let's see. Then - -
2874943|CMP|Yes. So far - so far, we're right with you.
2874956|CC|Okay. Then take the comm carrier electrical lead and double it back on itself, and - and tape it together so that it doesn't flop around. And now you've got it essentially set up. I - I've lost my place here on the sequence. Just a second. Okay. Place the molded earpiece - Well, actually, one further modification was then to run the - the hose, which is now external, up underneath the leather doughnut and out through the ear opening, and - and pull it on through. Now you - to put this all on, you'll have to stick the molded earpiece in your ear and then as you pull the Snoopy on, sort of pull the slack out of the - the audio hose there so you don't end up with a lot of hose coiled up in the earcup. And the - the remaining hose then just sort of dangles down beside your neck. Fasten the chinstrap, and make sure that the hose isn't pinched or - anywhere. Readjust the mike boom to a half inch from your - in front of your lips, and make sure one of the foam parts of the mike boom is facing your mouth. Okay. Then you just route the - the electrical lead and the - the plug on down through the slot and ICG, and put - put all the excess length of the connectors and the - the excess stuff down inside the ECG [sic] so it doesn't flop around, and of course mate the pins, the connectors, and snap the ICG closed at the front to be sure that it'll capture. One thing they did try in this configuration is - was - was to see if you could get the helmet on over all that, in case a suited reentry became necessary at short notice, and it does go on. Randy Hester tried it. And with just a little cocking of the head, you can get the helmet on over. How's that sound to you?
2875227|CMP|Hey, Gordy. That sounds essentially what we were thinking about. We hadn't got to the extent of trying to hook them up yet, you know, put them together yet, but we're thinking along the same lines anyhow. And you brought up a couple of points that are good.
2875243|CC|Okay. If you got any questions or anything, I've got a demo model sitting right in front of me here, so that we can just discuss it real time as you get it set up. I assume you're going to try to work that up tonight. is that right?
2875302|CMP|Yes, we can, I guess. Okay, and the - the reason you'd rather have Jack do it than me is simply - simply because of the redun - redund - I can't say the word. (Laughter) Redundancy.
2875316|CC|That's affirmative. It gives you and Gene the - the prime - best equipment, and we see no reason why this won't work, but like you say, it's only one mike in place of two on the other ones.
2875338|LMP|I'm surprised you didn't have us tape two headsets to the Snoopy helmet.
2875346|CC|Well, Jack, we'll just take that chance.
2875355|LMP|Well, it took 14 days, but I finally know where I stand.
2875403|CC|I do have a question. Well, first of all I give you a little weather for the South Pacific tomorrow, if you're interested.
2875415|LMP|Stand by and let's get the commander on the headset here in a minute. Then you can pass it up.
2875420|CC|Okay.
2875911|CC|Not bad.
2875915|CMP|Well, I'll let her go this time.
2875935|CC|Okay, we got them.
2875939|CMP|Okay, we'll torque at 59:45.
2875943|CC|All righty.
2880011|CC|America, we would like to stop the roll this time around as you come up on 146 roll.
2880030|CMP|Okay, we'll stop it on 146 roll.
2880551|CC|America, Houston. When you get her stopped there, we'd like you to hold the attitude until we get the DSE dump before doing the VERB 49.
2880601|CMP|Okay, Gordo. We're there now.
2880822|CDR|Hey, Houston; America. We can take those words on the weather in the recovery area, if you like.
2880829|CC|Okay. It can be summed up by one word, "Excellent." 2000, scattered, and high-scattered forecast. I'm looking at a satellite picture - high-resolution satellite picture that shows you in the middle of a big high, and she's just - very faint hint of clouds in the area. And the trend of the weather movement is such that you're going into a - an even clearer area by tomorrow. The wind will be 090 at 10; visibility, 10; 2994 on the altimeter. It's of no consequence to the Navy guys, but the landlubber will be glad to learn that there is 3-foot wave heights, and the temperature is 77 degrees. Over.
2880929|CDR|Sounds like a fighter pilot's day to come aboard. I think they'll be able to take those seas.
2880938|CC|(Laughter) Roger. Okay, you can start the VERB 49 if you wish.
2881043|CC|America, Houston. One other request you might be thinking about that you'd - and that is any deltas to the nominal entry stowage that we might not know about we'd like to know about before you go to sleep tonight so we can think about the CG.
2881103|CMP|Okay, Gordo. We'll be able to give you those.
2882027|CC|America, Houston. We're ready to spin it up.
2882036|CMP|Okay.
2890802|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 289 hours 8 minutes. We'll be putting the crew to bed in about an hour, actually about 50 minutes from now. And they're eating dinner at this time. No major items scheduled on the Flight Plan between now and the time they begin their sleep period. During the night, the Flight Dynamics Officer and the Retro Return to Earth Officer will be compiling their last stretch of tracking data on the spacecraft and computing the final midcourse correction which would be performed at about 3 hours prior to entry. At the present time that midcourse correction would appear to be very small, around 2 feet per second. Apollo 17 at this time about 80,000 miles from Earth and the spacecraft velocity going through 6,000 feet per second and we'll see an ever more rapid buildup in that velocity as the spacecraft nears Earth.
2891838|CDR|Hello, Houston; America.
2891842|CC|Go ahead.
2891845|CDR|Gordo, we're just finishing chow and doing a little cleaning up, and I'm doublechecking the stowage and so forth. But we do have a minute. Is there by any chance any late news? Anything going on today that might be of interest?
2891901|CC|Okay. I haven't heard of anything. You did get a news report this morning? is that correct?
2891907|CDR|Yes. We sure did.
2891908|CC|Okay. I'll see if there's any deltas to that. It'll take me a couple of minutes.
2891912|LMP|Okay. How's the Houston weather today?
2891916|CC|It was overcast but warmer. Kind of standard winter weather for around here. Not nearly so frigid as it has been the last couple days.
2891929|LMP|Okeydoke.
2893410|CDR|Hello, Houston; America.
2893413|CC|Go ahead, Gene.
2893417|CDR|Okay, Gordo; the entry stowage will be as - as in the Flight Plan Supplement, with the exception that there is a - a small LM jettison bag, max weight of about 25 pounds, which will be - which is already, as a matter of fact, packed in A-7.
2893447|CC|Okay. We got that.
2893450|CDR|And the presently used jettison bag weight really isn't very much at all, that's just for housekeeping trash and so forth. We will tie between A-2 and A-3, and there's probably not, at the most, more than 5 pounds there.
2893510|CC|Okay.
2893514|CDR|And right now we haven't seen any specific spot to tie down the LEVAs. If you've got a recommendation, we'll take it. If not, we'll just pick a spot down in the LEB area to tie them down.
2893531|CC|Okay. I'll see if we have a plan for that.
2895602|CC|America, Houston. I've got an update to the news.
2895602|CDR|Okay, Houston. America's listening.
2895602|CC|Okay. It's some more like human interest stuff rather than pure news. One thing the - in the Liberty Bowl football game Georgia Tech beat Iowa State. Well, I guess it's not quite over yet - this is a fourth quarter score, Georgia Tech 315 Iowa State 24. And, there is a story about the Moonship that's streaking smoothly homeward. There's nothing in it that you don't know about, though, except maybe one little part of the article describing a quote from William E. Fastie of Johns Hopkins University, member of the Orbital Science Team, who said that a rather startling discovery is the Moon is simply not degassing. It has nothing left in terms of anything that you think - that can create an atmosphere. Much to his surprise, even the amount of hydrogen, an element that should have been the most abundant outgassing candidate, turned out to be about 1 percent of its predicted value. He speculated that the absence of a planetary magnetic field on the Moon works to the purge surface of any atmospheric accumulation. The atoms of gases that have vented to the surface, he theorized, pick up an electrical charge then - and are then swept away by the solar wind, which is a stream of electrified atoms pushing far out into the solar system of the Sun. Former President Truman is stabilized is the word they are using now. His heart condition is unchanged. His kidneys are failing him, and he's termed to be still in a very serious condition but resting comfortably. A declining birth rate and a desire for fewer children in the years ahead have caused the census bureau to reduce sharply its estimates of future population growth in the United States. By the year 2000, for example, the estimate is now 20 million fewer people than had been forecast on the basis of previous statistics. Reduction could have major implications for American society in many areas. And it reflects changes in birth and child planning, which now suggest that the U.S. may eventually reach zero population growth. The last one is pretty interesting, and more so if you can see the picture that goes with the story, about James L. G. Fitzpatrick who for 40 years has been interested in copying natural flight. And he has now designed a batlike flying machine that may be ready for a test run next summer. Fitzpatrick said that the first - that first, every small part of the ungainly structure must be tested carefully. Otherwise you end up either in a disaster or a grave, and we try to avoid that sort of thing. After three decades of trying, Fitzpatrick, who's 66, believes his latest device comes closest to the real thing, although it still needs a small motor to flap the wings. Asked whether his device, as yet unnamed, works on the flight principle of a bird, he said, "I don't know anyone who knows what principle a bird works on, but I guess this is more like a bat of a pterodactyl. Fitzpatrick's ornithopter or flapping wing airplane is equipped with cockpit controls that include a throttle that regulates the 1-horsepower engine and up-and-down flight. Other equipment includes rudder pedals to regulate a power steering system, a parking brake, a pseudopaddagieum, I don't know what that one - that word is, it's a new one on me, to transfer power from the engine to the wings, and a two-way radio. It has a maximum 40-foot wingspan and weighs 320 pounds. It is 6 feet long and it looks like a cage of scaffolding covered in parts by canvas. He said he's far enough along on building his device that he will be able to test the way the wings move in the Staten island Community College gym by the first of the year. However, there will be no free flying. The gymnasium test will involve tying weights to the wing tips and flapping the wings. He said that his bird is rather slow in maturing; and it's been a long gestation period which involved 9000 hours of experimentation, $40,000 in his money, and the dissection of 300 birds of various species. "I've been interested in flight since 1930," he said. "Basically, I was curious as to why various things flew, and I've been painfully finding out ever
2895602|LMP|Huh! Merry Christmas.
2895602|CDR|Thank you for the news , Gordo.
2900230|CDR|That's a very enjoyable evening to go to bed with on our final night of the flight.
2900230|CC|Before you turn in, we got a little shopping list to run down with you If you're - nothing to write down, but if you're ready to listen.
2900230|CDR|Okay, go ahead.
2900230|CC|Okay. The Surgeons are, first of all, request that Ron press on his sensors. They're looking like they're getting loose according to the data here. They also reco - recommend for Ron that if he's still using the nose drops - I guess he has been - they recommend that he take one decongestant pill before going to sleep and one after breakfast in the morning. It's a suggestion. It's his option. The thought being it might help in clearing your ears during that final descent. You may leave the optics power on for more heat in the cabin if you wish. We'd like you to stop charge in battery B. Over.
2900354|CDR|Okay. He's taking that off the line now; off the charge.
2900354|CC|Okay. And we'd like the IR, OFF.
2900405|CDR|Okay. It's OFF, Gordy.
2900405|CC|Okay. Let's see, we owe you an answer on what to do with the LEVAs. I guess they were supposed to be on the helmets in the PGA bag. is that going to be a real pain to get at, and put them there?
2900405|CDR|No, it's not going to be a pain at all, Gordo; it's just impossible.
2900405|CC|Okay, well -
2900405|CDR|There's just no room in there at all - not - none at all.
2900405|CC|Okay. I'll - probably not have an answer for you tonight, but first thing in the morning - someplace to put them.
2900405|CDR|Okay. It won't be any problem strapping them somewhere, but we thought maybe you had a better idea than we did; if not, when we get our rock bags tied down and all in place, -we'll take a look at a good spot for the LEVAs and let you know.
2900405|CC|Okay. G&C - I don't know where you are on the checklist - the - just a reminder to zero the optics before you turn in. And I'd like to -say for the whole White Team, who are just - here in another hour, will finish up their - their work with the Apollo Program, and myself included, that this sure has been a pleasure working with not only the two best spacecraft the program has seen but we think the best and most cooperative and -crew also. And it's been a privilege in my esti-matio and a real pleasure, too, and looking forward to seeing you on Thursday.
2900405|CDR|Well, Gordo, those are awful kind words, and we do appreciate it very much, but I think you know how we feel about the help you guys give us down there. And - well, it really makes our job easy up here. From the Cape back to the Pacific is -it's the guys from the trench all the way up to the top back there, and that's what it's really all about. We thank you, those are good words, but just consider them reciprocal also.
2900405|CC|Thank you.
2900405|CMP|We appreciate it there, White Team.
2900405|CC|Thank you, Ron.
2900405|CDR|Gordo, we'll hang on the air here and we're going to finish up our presleep checklist and we'll just give you one final buzz before we go off on the voice switch.
2900405|CC|Okay; very good.
2900405|CDR|By the way, the Earth is sure starting to get big.
2900405|CC|Okay. You're about 80,000 miles out.
2900405|CDR|Okay, outstanding. I guess, based upon your midcourse 7> that that's a good sign, isn't it? That it's getting big?
2900405|CC|That's what it's supposed to do.
2900745|CDR|It's a - although there's not much of it to see, it's really sort of spectacular because the crescent is getting smaller and smaller although the Moon is getting - is getting larger, and of course the crescent we're looking at now is the Pacific. But even if there were landmasses in there, I don't think we could see much besides the reflection off the clouds - and a - well, in this case, the ocean. But - it's really a pretty spectacular sight because out the other window, now that we're on an intervertical [?] PTC, we've got a full Moon looking back at us. And it's sort of a poetic place to be the night before entry.
2900745|CC|Yes, I'll bet it is.
2900745|CDR|Hang in there, babe, and we'll see you for sure Thursday.
2900745|CC|Okay; it's a deal.
2902553|CMP|Houston, how's the CMPs biomed now?
2902553|CC|Okay, Ron, looks real good.
2902553|CMP|Okay; mighty fine.
2902553|CC|I got a final on the Liberty Bowl. Must have been exciting. John Young should be happy. Georgia Tech squeaked through, 31 to 30.
2902553|CDR|Looks like there's some pretty good football games coming up this weekend, too.
2902553|CC|That's right, in the pros.
2902820|CDR|Houston, America.
2902820|CC|Go ahead.
2902820|CDR|Gordy, we'd like to go back to AUTO on the GLYCOL EVAP TEMP IN, you concur?
2902820|CC|That's fine with the EECOM. Your choice.
2902839|CDR|Okay. We're just going to go back to AUTO on the switch.
2902839|CC|Okay.
2902839|CDR|And we also would like to take that inverter off. It's getting a little warm in here now and this PTC ought to be pretty comfortable tonight.
2902839|CC|Okay.
2902856|CDR|Okay, we'll take INVERTER number 3 OFF. And I think the POWER'S OFF, also.
2902856|CC|Okay.
2903400|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 290 hours 34 minutes. We expect to be putting the crew to bed shortly as soon as they finish up some last minute items. Their sleep period was scheduled to begin about 30 minutes ago.
2904015|CDR|Houston, America.
2904015|CC|All right. Go ahead, America; Houston.
2904015|CDR|We bid you hello, Bob, and at the same time, good night.
2904015|CC|What can I say? I'm crying.
2904015|CDR|Well, we thought we'd give you about 8 hours to think about it.
2904015|CC|That's about all I've got to do.
2904015|CDR|See you in the morning, babe.

The spaceflight meteorology group of the National Weather Service said this morning that weather conditions are expected to be satisfactory for the landing and recovery of the Apollo 17 crew and spacecraft. The weather forecast for the planned landing area, approximately 360 nautical miles southeast of Pango Pango, calls for partly cloudy skies, easterly winds of 10 miles per hour, seas of 3 feet and a temperature of near 77 degrees. Apollo 17 now 43 991 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity 8908 feet per second and we're 6 hours 19 minutes away from entry into the Earth's atmosphere.

2981131|CMP|Hey, Houston. This is America. That's mighty fine.
2981131|CC|Roger, America. It's Houston. We're ready to have you come home today.
2981131|CMP|Hey, mighty fine. We're all set, too.
2981131|CC|Okay, might read you a page - -
2981131|CMP|. * .
2981131|CC|Go ahead.
2981131|CMP|Okay, we've been waiting a long time for Anchors Aweigh. And we've missed it. (Laughter)
2981131|CC|I imagine - -
2981131|CMP|You going to play it again?
2981131|CC|- - imagine you'll hear it a couple of more times today, too.
2981131|CMP|Oh, okay. But if we could hear it again, that'd be great.
2981131|CC|It'll take them awhile to cue it up, and maybe we'll work on that. Let me give you guys a few items here while you're thinking. Number 1, the old weather report: 2000 scattered - high scattered - 10 miles visibility, 3-foot seas, winds are out of the east at 10 knots. Just about exactly what you had yesterday, and probably what we've been telling you for 2 or 3 days. Looks like we're going to have a midcourse 7 this morning, about 2 feet per second. Pretty much just to really center us in the corridor. We're already within the corridor now, with no problems. We're going to exit PTC at a different roll angle. We'll read that up to you later when you get the Flight Plan out; but just so you don't go ahead and exit early, we will be sending you something up on that exit PTC to new roll angle. And as far as the LEVAs are concerned, you guys were looking for a place to stow those last night, and what we're suggesting is putting them in the sleep restraint on top of A-8 where you've got one suit stowed, apparently. And we're suggesting you put one of those on the helmet on that PGA. And the other one, as it were, loose and in the bag. Over.
2981347|CMP|Houston, America. We've got the PGAs in the bag. (Laughter) Hope that's right.
2981347|CC|You got all three of them in the L-shaped bags, or have you got - The understanding down here, apparently, in talking last night was that one was in a sleep restraint on top of A-8 - in the sleep restraint bag.
2981347|CMP|Well, we've got CMP and LMP suits in the bottom -I mean, the commander and LMP suits at the bottom part of it. CMP suit's in the top of it - of the L-shaped bag.
2981347|CC|Okay, we'll work on that. And we've got something else for you here - just a minute.
2981347|CC|(Music: Anchors Aweigh)
2981347|CDR|Thank you, Robert. Most appreciative.
2981347|CC|Okay, we aim to please. That's also, I might tell you guys, the third time we've played that this morning, although you's only heard it twice. We played it once before we sent the crew alert.
2981711|CMP|CMP has no comment.
2981711|CC|Okay, America, we'd like to request MEDIUM on the HIGH GAIN antenna, please.
2981711|CMP|Okay, you have REACQ and MEDIUM.
2981711|CC|Okay. And I guess now on the LEVAs, what we're suggesting is you put them - put the two of them in by themselves in a sleep restraint and tie it down on top of A-8. And I've got a lot of fancy words about how to tie it down on top of A-8, if you guys can't figure out how to do it. I can read it off to you, or we can leave it to your intuitive good sense.
2981711|CMP|Well, so far, we've kept pretty much with most of your recommendations around here. I think we could probably hack that one, too.

2992845|CMP|Map. Oh.
2992857|CMP|Okay, Houston. ...
2992911|CMP|Okay, Houston. On the commander's menu, we use negative reporting. Okay, did not eat potato soup, chicken stew, and peach ambrosia. I'm sorry, I started with meal C instead of A. And then to add on meal Charlie, three-fourths jelly candy. Okay, we'll start with A again, on the commander. Did not eat peaches and cocoa. Meal Bravo, did not eat chicken and rice soup and fruitcake. Add one-fourth jelly candy. Okay, for breakfast on day 14. Did not eat mixed fruit. Did not eat cinnamon toast and bread. Did not eat coffee. And add one can of peaches. Okay, commander's medical log: PRD, 17065; 5 hours, fair; none; and five cans of water. Okay, for the LMP, start with meal A, day 13. Did not eat bacon squares, apricots, cocoa. Meal Bravo, did not eat chicken and rice soup. And add - add on graham cracker cubes and a plain coffee. Meal 13, did not eat chicken stew, peach ambrosia, grapefruit drink, and add on a plain coffee and sugar cookies. Day - day 14, meal A, did not eat a half a sausage and a mixed fruit and scratch the potassium in the coffee - A plain coffee. Okay, LMPs PRD, 24227; 6 hours of good; none; and three cans of water. Okay, CMP, meal A, Day 13: did not eat four bacon squares, apricots, and add on a car - a carmel candy. Meal Bravo, did not eat one-fourth of the fruitcake. Add on two tea, three-fourths jelly candy and graham cracker cubes. Meal Charlie, did not eat chicken stew. Add on one-fourth jelly candy. For breakfast, did not eat mixed fruit. Scratch the with K in the coffee. Drank the coffee, but it was black. Add on peaches. Okay, CMPs medical: PRD, 15062; 7 hours of good. The rest of the guys said it was noisy, but I thought it was good. Let's see - medication: one decongestant, one Seconal; and three cans of water. And that completes the medical/food readback.
2993512|CC|Roger, Ron. Just a word on your consumable status this morning. You're in good shape on RCS, oxygen, and hydrogen. You're in real good shape.
2993526|CDR|Okay, Houston, America. When you get that roll angle, let us know, will you?
2993532|CC|Yes, the roll angle is 306, exit G&N PTC at roll angle 306. And we'll call you when we get there - when you get there.
2993544|CDR|Okay, we're watching it, Bob, 306.
2993623|CC|And, America, Houston. The HIGH GAIN angles to go with that roll angle of 306. HIGH GAIN angles are PITCH, 34; YAW, 267. Over.
2993638|CMP|Roger. 34 and 267.
2993720|CC|And, America, Houston. I've got a couple of other items on this Flight Plan updates, if you're ready to copy now.
2993727|CDR|Go ahead, Bob.
2993729|CC|Okay, at 301:50, 301:50, add "UV COVER, CLOSED."
2993750|CDR|Okay, got it.
2993752|CC|Okay, and then on the other page there. At 302:06, delete the line, "UV COVER, CLOSE."
2993806|CDR|Okay.
2993807|CC|The next change here is to the Entry Checklist and to the entry cue card.
2993825|CDR|Okay, go ahead.
2993827|CC|On the Entry Checklist, page 1-3 between steps 23 and 24, it's actually part of step 23. S-BAND OMNI antenna Charlie, change that to Delta - OMNI - S-BAND OMNI antenna, Delta.
2993848|CDR|Okay, we've got Delta at horizon check attitude.
2993853|CC|Roger. And if you'll go over to 2-4, Entry Checklist, where it says, "Yaw back to zero degrees" after SEP, we would like you to insert, "Select OMNI Charlie" - OMNI Charlie, at that time. And that will be also required on your entry cue card at 45 minutes where it says, "Yaw to zero," you'll have to be OMNI Charlie, select OMNI Charlie.
2993930|CDR|Okay, we've got it covered everywhere.
2993933|CC|Okay, and the reason for that is for better coverage going through Hawaii and that and then OMNI Charlie is coming back up on the ARIA.
2993945|CDR|Okay, Bob.
2994010|CC|And, America, Houston. Just one word for the CMP, if you have a chance. One of your EKG sensors seems to be loose, if you can tighten it up a little bit.
2994020|CMP|Okay, I'll start pressing on it.

2995712|CC|Ron, while you're doing your maneuvering, no need to answer, but just a reminder. Due to the - stopping your roll angle differently, you're under the EI REFSMMAT attitude, your roll will be about 046, and you'll see a max yaw of about 64 degrees during this gyro torquing.

3003842|CMP|Well, I'll be darned.
3003853|CMP|And, Houston, you go to ENTRY and NORMAL on the null bias check. EMS is counting like a son of a gun. (Laughter) Almost as fast as the DELTA-V test but not quite.
3003907|CC|Roger. You're really smoking along, aren't you?
3003914|CMP|(Laughter) Well, I wouldn't think it would sense that, but - -
3003917|CC|Roger.
3003925|CMP|Anyhow, we'll use burn time and - NOUN 85 for the - the burn.
3003937|CC|Roger.
3004028|CC|Ron, you're happy with your EMS and null bias check, aren't you?
3004033|CMP|Negative. Not on the null bias check, no. I'll give you a count in a minute. I'm going to redo the EMS DELTA-V test, and then go back and try another null bias check. But it looked like it was counting from about 100 to - to 75 in 30 seconds, but let me check that out.
3004113|CMP|Okay. Did the DELTA-V test, and that time we got a minus 20.3.
3004205|CMP|Okay, Houston. They started at minus 100 on the null bias check; 30 seconds at 118.8.
3004246|CMP|One minute, 137.8.
3004254|CC|Ron, would you verify those are negative numbers?
3004257|CMP|That's affirmative. They're negative.
3004326|CMP|Okay, a minute and 40 seconds, minus 162.7 or so.
3004422|CMP|Okay, Houston. We've got a little bit of time here. And looks like I've still got three EMS tests left. I'd like to go ahead and do another EMS test on that, and we'll see if that integrator is all fouled up completely - on the range integrator.
3004448|CC|Okay, Ron. We agree.
3004450|CMP|Okay.
3004541|CMP|Okay, TEST 1 looks alright.
3004600|CMP|And TEST 2 is okay; .05 G light is ON. Okay, going to TEST 3; 10 seconds -
3004620|CMP|MARK it. Upper light came on.
3004640|CMP|Okay, a 58.0 in the range counter -
3004654|CMP|MARK it. Okay, it's slowing down going across -
3004704|CMP|MARK it. Ah-ha. Okay. G line comes across at 9 z - g's (laughter), and range indicator indicates 0.0. Outstanding.
3004809|CMP|And test 5 works all right.
3005235|CMP|Okay.
3005302|CMP|Well, looks like a P41 here. Watch it count down.
3005309|CDR|... 9, 130, and 359. Oh, about 25 minutes from the burn, 25.
3005317|CMP|Think you can get those things done by that time?
3005329|CMP|Okay, just so I won't forget it, let's go ahead and trim it.
3005343|CMP|Okay, we are trimmed. About 1 minute. ... 24 minutes to the burn.
3005510|CMP|...
3005613|CMP|Houston, America. Does it look like we're going to hack it on the waste water tank there? ...
3005619|CC|Ron, yes. We're not going to dump the waste water tank at this time, and we won't dump it after midcourse 7 of course.
3005626|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. Just wanted to make sure.
3005705|CMP|Yes. BAT C, up around 36.5. Pyros, 36.9, 36.9.
3005725|CMP|... Okay. Fuel cells are looking good, too.
3005734|CMP|A/C is looking good.
3005916|CMP|About 18 minutes yet.
3005924|CC|America, Houston.
3005926|CMP|Roger. Go ahead.
3005928|CC|Oh, Ron, we've been kicking around this EMS test and the null bias test and that, and we concur on this burn using NOUN 85s and your burn time as your cues and not using EMS. We would like, however, for you to bias the EMS. Set in a plus 118.8 at - and it will go to NORMAL at Tig minus 30 seconds and we'd just be interested in what the EMS does under a very small g field like this.
3010001|CMP|Okay. We'll set in at plus 118.8 and turn it to NORMAL at Tig minus 30 seconds. And I'll try to look at it at the end of burn time or go to STANDBY at that point in time so we can make a good hack on it.
3010015|CC|Roger. That'd be great, Ron, and we see no problem for entry with EMS.
3010020|CMP|Roger. Mighty fine.
3010030|CMP|We've really got the Christmas spirit out the window here. Looks like it's really snowing.
3010037|CC|(Laughter) Roger. Glad it's not snowing on us with that stuff.
3010045|CMP|(Laughter) Oh, it's frozen.
3010250|CMP|Okay, Gene. Let me read through the P41 here just to make sure we got everything. Okay, we're in SIM basic configuration, I guess. Yes, the IR's ON, and it won't hurt anything. UV's ON, but at this point in time, it won't make any difference, I guess. CMC is ON, ISS is ON, SCS is operating. We tested the caution and warning, the DELTA-V test works, null bias ... And DELTA-Vc, we'll set that up.
3010348|CMP|Okay. We got 118.8 and DELTA-V in STANDBY. BMAGs are caged and RATE 2.
3010403|CMP|Okay. AUTO RCS SELECTS. We'll put those on for trim. We're just going to trim the X-axis only? Okay, I'll leave the A/C OFF. Okay, I got the DAP. VERB 04 NOUN 46 ENTER. CSM. Don't use A/C. Use B/D for plus-X. ... DEAD BAND, one-half degree per second. Use B/D for ROLL. Okay.
3010445|CMP|Okay, ROT CONTROLLER ACs are ON, DIRECTS are ON. ... 13 minutes. Okay, I got the DET set. Looks like it agrees. And we're in CMC and AUTO. We're in the burn attitude. Done the boresight and sextant star check. We're in P41, have maneuvered to the right attitude.
3010518|CMP|And we're still in RATE 2. CMC, AUTO. Okay, let me realign the old GDC.
3010651|CMP|Okay, the old GDC is aligned. Let's see. MANUAL ATTs are in RATE COMMAND.
3010700|CMP|The DEAD BAND RATE to LOW. LIMIT CYCLE is OFF. ATT 1, RATE 2.
3010714|CMP|Okay, stand by for 5 minutes. And we're 10 minutes from the burn, Gene.
3010733|CMP|And, Jack, burn time is 9 seconds - 9 seconds. And we'll trim X only to 0.2 foot per second.
3010812|CMP|Houston, America. Does this kind of change our entry angle, what, about 0.2 - 0.2 degree?
3010824|CC|0.2 of a degree, Ron.
3010827|CMP|Oh, okay.
3010837|CMP|Which way? Does it steepen it or shallow it up?
3010841|CC|It'll make you a little more shallow. Or, it'll shallow it up - -
3010845|CMP|Oh, okay. Okay.
3010859|CC|Ron, it's going to run you from 6.7 entry angle to a 6.49.
3010905|CMP|Oh, okay. Yes, that's what I thought, okay.
3010940|CDR|Eight minutes to go. ...
3011001|CMP|Next time we do this, we'll have to allow a little more time for the - the BUSS/dumping, I think, prior to the burns.
3011100|CC|America, Houston. You're GO for MCC7.
3011105|CMP|Roger. We're GO for midcourse number 7.
3011253|CDR|Is one of those going the other way?
3011301|CMP|I guess they go in all directions. It just looks like they're - they're whipping by window 1 here.
3011336|CC|Go ahead.
3011357|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 301 hours 14 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, 3 minutes 48 seconds away from midcourse 7 maneuver. Distance currently 25,408 nautical miles. Velocity 11,928 feet per second. Three minutes, 20 seconds mark to midcourse 7, 2.1 feet per second, 2 jet RCS maneuver.
3011405|CMP|That's only 2.2 foot per second.
3011453|CMP|TRANS CONTROL POWER is ON. Okay. We're ON and armed.
3011506|CMP|Okay, we have trim. There ... down there.
3011550|CDR|Okay, Houston; America. We're coming up on 2 minutes, and we're ready for MCC7.
3011556|CC|Roger, America. You're looking good.
3011614|CMP|Yes, burn time is 9.6. Clock's right on.
3011633|CMP|Yes, that's right. It'll go out automatically within 30 seconds. Okay.
3011647|CDR|(Laughter) I wonder what we've got now. ...
3011700|CMP|... 30 seconds, we'll go EMS to NORMAL.
3011713|CMP|DEAD BAND, TRANS CONTROL, AC DIRECTS, CMC, AUTO.
3011718|CMP|Okay. There we go, 30 seconds. EMS to NORMAL.
3011726|CMP|Okay.
3011740|CMP|... Ten seconds to go, Jack. 2, 1 -
3011752|CMP|MARK it.
3011755|CDR|We're burning, Houston.
3011757|CC|Roger.
3011806|CMP|Okay, got her? And I stopped it right at 9 seconds. There's your NOUN 85.
3011814|CC|We're looking at them.
3011815|CMP|Okay, EMS is 100.1. Okay, TRANS CONTROL POWER is OFF. DIRECTs are OFF. Hand controllers are safed.
3011837|CDR|Houston, looks like the burn was right on the money. You saw the residuals, and the burn was a 9-second burn, on time.
3011847|CC|Roger, America. It looked good.
3011851|CDR|And the VERB 66 is in.
3011856|CC|Roger.
3011900|CMP|Ah-ha, I get to get out of my g suit.
3011906|CMP|You know, while I think about it, Houston, I've noticed it throughout the - the flight here. In the simulator, CMC control will allow your rates - you know - to bounce back and forth maybe up to, oh, sometimes 0.1, more than likely 0.05 degrees per second as it trims within the dead band. In four-jet translations, as well as in two-jet translations, your rates get up to about almost 0.4 degree per second as it's damping within its own dead band there.
3011951|CC|Roger, Ron.
3012026|CC|America, Houston. Just to make doubly certain that we don't get any venting from the waste tank, we would like on panel 352 the WASTE WATER RELIEF valve to OFF, please.
3012042|CMP|Okay, we'll get that. BATTERY VENT presumably will stay OPEN, though, is that correct?
3012057|CC|Stand by on that, Ron. That's affirmative, Ron.
3012104|CMP|Okay, we'll leave the BATTERY VENT OPEN.
3012134|CMP|Okay, Houston. The dump PRESSURE RELIEF valve is in OFF.
3012142|CC|Roger.
3012240|CC|And, America; Houston. We'd like WIDE on the HIGH GAIN.
3012248|CMP|Okay, the old HIGH GAIN is on WIDE and AUTO.
3012253|CC|Roger.
3013823|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 301 hours 38 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. 2 hours 39 minutes away from entry into the atmosphere for Apollo 17. Velocity now 12,611 feet per second. This velocity will triple by the time they reach the atmosphere. Current predicted velocity at atmospheric entry 36,090 feet per second at an angle of minus 6.5 degrees. Command Module Pilot, Ron Evans, at the present time, is donning the so called counter-pressure garment which is being evaluated for possible future space programs as a protection against cardiovascular changes that occur to the human body after long missions. The midcourse correction burn number 7 went off on time very nominally. Little over 9 seconds burn time with two RCS jets. A change in velocity of 2.1 feet per second. In the landing area in the South Pacific the National Weather Service said, this morning, that weather conditions are expected to be satisfactory. Weather forecast for the planned landing area, 360 nautical miles southeast of Pango Pango is for partly cloudly skies, easterly winds at 10 miles, seas at 3 feet, and a temperature of near 77 degrees. 2 hours 38 minutes away from entry and at 301:40 Ground Elapsed Time in the mission of Apollo 17, this is Apollo Control.
3014046|CC|America, Houston.
3014050|LMP|Go ahead.
3014051|CC|Jack, we're just more or less trying to fill up our data book down here and if you haven't already done one, we'd - like any free time, if Ron would run another null bias check just to see if the drift changed when we did that little bitty burn.
3014107|LMP|Okay. I'll mention that to him.
3014233|LMP|Houston, 17.
3014246|CC|Go ahead, America.
3014247|LMP|Yes, Bob; this is Jack. You have any problem reading me with this comm configuration I got on now?
3014254|CC|No, we're reading you loud and clear. If I was a little late on that, it's because I've got some problems down here on my console, that's all. The whole room yelled at me that you'd called.
3014305|LMP|No, that's no problem. I just hadn't made a check with you and I wanted to make sure I was readable.
3014654|CMP|Okay, Houston. This is America, Command Module Pilot on the LMP's comm carrier. How do you read?
3014702|CC|Read you loud and clear, Ron.
3014704|CMP|Okay, good. I understand you want a null bias check again?
3014708|CC|Yes, we're just wondering if maybe the - maybe it was an air bubble or something in there - in the - small g-field of that midcourse 7 burn might have changed something. Just like to take a look at it.
3014720|CMP|Okay. We'll take a look at her.
3014824|CMP|Okay, in 30 seconds, 94.0; starting at plus 100 that time, for some reason.
3014855|CMP|One minute, 87.8.
3014942|CMP|Okay. It was 79.0 at a minute and 40 seconds.
3014948|CC|Okay, Ron. We got that.
3014958|CMP|Do you want to try the minus 100 part of it? Really think it's worth it?
3015005|CC|Well, Ron, we'd like it if you could dat - data gathering point, that's all - -
3015011|CMP|Okay. Let's do - -
3015011|CC|You know what's due on entry.
3015014|CMP|The other guys are crawling around down under the couches. They're trying to get that stuff locked in there anyhow. I think I must have shrank, my shoes went on easier now than they did on the fitting. I must have shrunk, I guess, is the correct terminology. Shrank? Shrink?
3015046|CC|Whatever you like.
3015048|CMP|(Laughter)
3015153|CMP|Okay, minus 105.8 at 30 seconds.
3015223|CMP|Minus 115.7 - I mean 111 - 111.7 at 1 minute.
3015304|CMP|And it's minus 119.1 or 2 - about 2 - about 119.2 about a minute and 40.
3015312|CC|Okay, Ron. That's very consistent data both ways on that - after the burn. It doesn't tie up with the data prior to the burn too well.
3015322|CMP|Uh huh.
3015400|CMP|Houston, UV COVER is CLOSED and talk back's gray.
3015406|CC|Roger.
3015915|CC|Ron, we're going to break lock here a minute. We've got a site handover.
3015920|CMP|Okay. I understand.
3020550|CDR|Hello, Houston. How do you read CDR?
3020554|CC|Read you loud and clear, Ron - Gene.
3020557|CDR|Okay, Bob. I'm back up now and I'll stay with you.
3020755|CMP|Okay, and IR can come OFF. And the UV, OFF; IR cover, CLOSED. S-BAND AUX TV, OFF. OFF, yes. And DATA SYSTEM, OFF. Through with the old Flight Plan. Let's check and see if we've got those other two items first. I think we do. Yes, that was one.
3020848|CC|Okay, Ron, we'd like to make sure that the LOGIC POWER on 181 is OFF, center.
3020856|CC|Okay, stand by 1. Yes. Yes, they're in DEPLOYMENT RETRACT. Let's put them to OFF.
3020925|CMP|Okay, DEPLOY MAIN A, MAIN B are both OFF, center.
3020936|CC|Okay, Ron. Thank you.
3020949|CC|And it's sad to shut off the SIM bay, it's operated so tremendously in this mission.
3020956|CMP|SIM bay has been outstanding.
3021804|CMP|Okay, Houston. We're coming up on 2 hours here. How about the logic sequence check?
3021812|CC|We're standing by.
3021815|CMP|Okay, SECS LOGIC, two of them are CLOSED; SECS ARM, two are CLOSED; ELS CSM SEP, BAT A, BAT B are CLOSED. Okay, ELS LOGIC is ON; ELS AUTO is ON. Okay, Houston, you all set for the SECS LOGIC?
3021853|CC|That's affirmative.
3021856|CMP|Okay, number 1 is ON. SECS LOGIC number 2 is ON.
3021913|CC|America, we're GO for PYRO ARM.
3021916|CMP|Okay, that sounds good. We're go for PYRO ARM. Okay, SECS LOGIC number 2 is coming OFF; SECS LOGIC number 1 is OFF. ARM BAT B is OPEN; ARM BAT A is OPEN; ELS LOGIC is OFF; ELS is to MANUAL. Okay, the old SEP breakers are OPEN.
3021951|CC|Roger. God show, Ron.
3021953|CMP|Okay, we've got her.
3022208|CDR|Hello, Houston; this is America. We are stowed for reentry.
3022215|CC|Roger.
3022257|CDR|And, Bob, as a note of interest, the spacecraft is dry. Both the forward hatch, the tunnel, and the tunnel hatch.
3022307|CC|Roger. We got that.
3023515|CMP|Okay, Houston, this is America. We'll whip into a P52 here.
3023521|CC|Roger. We're watching it.
3023650|CMP|There goes the Earth. Man, it was just a sliver.
3023650|CMP|Houston, you'd be happy to know that the Moon, now, has finally gotten back to its normal size for us.
3023650|CC|Roger.
3024107|CMP|Well, that's not 5 balls, but that's not a bad way to end, I guess. You know, I never noticed it before, but I'm looking next to the - to the Earth, right now. And, of course, that makes it a kind of bluish reflection inside the - the sextant, and you can't see the reticle brightness at all. It just - you know, it just comes through as a black - black line in there. And there are two lines. You know, I've got two - One of them must be - there are two - two reticles - no, there are two reticles. One's in focus, but the other one isn't.
3024107|CC|Roger, Ron. We can accept the NOUN 05.
3024152|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. There we go. There's NOUN 93.
3024152|CC|Then you can torque those, Ron.
3024152|CMP|Okay, we'll torque at 45 - 42:15.
3024152|CMP|Okay, Houston. We're going to maneuver to the horizon check attitude now.
3024306|CC|Roger, Ron.
3024306|CDR|Houston, America. I'll go OMNI Delta now.
3024306|CC|Roger. We concur.
3024306|CMP|Got the commander's ALARM.
3024306|CC|Roger. Copy.
3024936|CDR|Houston, America. The horizon star check is GO.
3024941|CC|Roger. Good word.
3030311|CMP|Okay, it's 10 seconds. Looks good - indicator light. This one. That always comes on on TEST 1, I don't know - .05 G light always comes on TEST 1. Okay? And still got two of them left. Let's try number 2, I guess. Never pass up a gas station, if you really need it. Okay, TEST 2.
3030408|CMP|Okay, it's out.
3030408|CMP|Okay? There we go -
3030430|CMP|MARK it.
3030440|CMP|MARK it. Okay, 10-second timer works. Always comes out.
3030440|CMP|Okay, we got 58, is that in there? Okay; wait a minute. Okay, here we go. There goes zip. TESTs are going down. Stops at 9gs going across, counting down.
3030543|CMP|MARK it. Okay, it stopped at 0.0. Stopped right at the old black line there. That's good. Okay, .05 G light on. Okay, 10 seconds later or so, here we go.
3030610|CMP|Yes, it's going out. It stopped at 0-2. It advanced 10 seconds and the light came on. Okay; let's see, we can go to 37K. Hey, Houston, let me doublecheck on this. The .05 G light was on, in EMS TEST 1, when I went to NORMAL. And it seems to me like that's normal but it may not be. Could we check on that for sure.
3030610|CC|Okay, we're checking on that.
3030610|CMP|Can - press on with the activation here.
3030725|CDR|Houston, we're pressing on with the primary water evap activation at this time.
3030725|CC|Stand by 1. It's affirmative - to Ron - that he can press on with EMS jun - TEST.
3030725|CMP|Okay; thank you much.
3030725|CC|And to Gene, on those water boilers, that's affirmative.
3030725|CDR|Okay; fine.
3030749|CMP|Okay, nonexit pattern, that's what we want. See the line on 37K. Okay; we go to RANGE SET - Flick! There it goes, up to the top. Okay, we're in RANGE SET, and we'll stand by now.
3030825|CDR|Houston, we're going to activate the secondary.
3030825|CC|You are GO on the secondary.
3030825|CDR|Okay.
3030825|CC|Okay, Ron, as you're going through the test, just a word on that EMS TEST 1. It is not normal for the zero - .05 G light to be on in ENTRY TEST mode 1. It is probably a result of that drifting accelerometer. It's - we'll have to just wait and see what the rest of the test looks like.
3030825|CMP|Okay; the rest of the test was GO.
3030825|CC|Okay. Again, it's probably the result of that drifting accelerometer, and possibly under the high-g load of entry, it will be no problem at all. It's all probably in the - drifting in the -in the mud.
3030825|CMP|Okay. Mighty fine.
3030825|CC|And, America, if you can give us ACCEPT, we've got a vector for you.
3030944|CMP|Okay; you have ACCEPT.
3031018|CDR|Okay, Houston; both evaporators are up.
3031018|CMP|Well, I just -
3031122|CDR|Hello, Houston; on the preheat, we've got 5 Charlie, at 38.
3031122|CC|We copy that. And we're running the cal curve.
3031122|CDR|And we've got 6 - Okay, and we've got 6 Bravo, at 385-
3031122|CC|America, the computer is yours.
3031202|CMP|Okay, we're going to BLOCK.
3031202|CC|America, Houston. We looked through the cal curve, and we recommend no preheat on the RCS.
3031202|CMP|Roger, Houston. I understand. No RCS preheat -command module RCS preheat.
3031202|CC|That's affirmative.
3031513|CC|America, Houston. Somebody standing by on the VHF? We'd like to get the VHF voice check out of the way, if that's possible.
3031513|CDR|Okay; go ahead.
3031513|CC|Stand by. We'll reconfigure here.
3031645|CC|America, Houston. We'd like to verify that the left antenna is selected, and that we are in VHF SIMPLEX Alfa.
3031645|CC|America, Houston. America, Houston.
3031645|CMP|I'll get them on S-band. Houston, this is America. Go' ahead on S-band.
3031645|CC|Roger. Did you get my last call? We'd like to verify, in left antenna, and in SIMPLEX Alfa? And we'll give you VHF check here shortly.
3031645|CMP|Affirmative. Maybe that was feedthrough, but we were on - Jack was on - VHF, called you back on VHF. Must have been S-band feedthrough, though. But verified; we're antenna left and VHF SIMPLEX Alfa.
3031645|CC|Roger, Ron, and we are going to simul. I understand Jack is reading us on the VHF.
3031645|CMP|Yes, that's affirm. And he was retransmitting on VHF; evidently, you weren't reading our VHF.
3031645|CC|Roger. It's normal to have VHF up-link prior to receiving VHF down-link. We're satisfied here.
3031645|CMP|Okay. Mighty fine.
3031920|CC|And, Ron, just for clarification, we will make another VHF check when you get a little closer, so we can get a down-link signal on you.
3031920|CMP|Oh, okay, real well.
3031920|CDR|Hello, Houston. We have a GO on the pyro bats, they're both 37, we're picking the checklist up on the top of 1-6.
3031920|CC|Roger. We understand.
3032050|CMP|Okay. On Panel 8. Okay, DIRECT ULLAGE are OPEN. COMMAND MODULE HEATERS are OPEN. Okay, DOCKING PROBES are OPEN - Whoops, stand by, stand by - let's CLOSE the RCS LOGIC, then. RCS LOGIC - MAIN A, MAIN B are going CLOSED. Okay, DOCKING PROBES are OPEN; SPS PITCH - and YAW - We'll open two more -that leaves four of them OPEN; three FLOAT BAGS are OPEN; and SECS, ARM are OPEN; EDS BATs are OPEN; ELS CSM SEPs are OPEN; POSTLANDING VENT is OPEN. Okay, they're all - all the others are CLOSED.
3032050|CMP|GDC seems pretty good, let's recheck it here. Okay, GDC is realigned.
3032050|CDR|Okay, Houston, if you're ready, we're going to pick up the command module RCS activation.
3032050|CC|Roger. We're standing by.
3032257|CMP|Okay, SECS ARM circuit breakers, two of them, are going CLOSED. Okay, Houston, ready for the LOGIC ARM.
3032257|CC|You're GO for LOGIC.
3032308|CMP|Okay. LOGIC 1, LOGIC 2.
3032308|CC|America, you're GO for PYRO ARM.
3032325|CMP|Okay, GO for PYRO ARM. PYRO ARM A, PYRO ARM B.
3032325|CMP|Okay.
3032325|CDR|Okay, Houston, coming up on the command module RCS pressure. 3, 2, 1 -
3032344|CDR|MARK it. And we got it.
3032344|CMP|Boy, you sure can hear it flow in somewhere.
3032344|CC|America, Houston. We've got two good rings.
3032344|CDR|Very good, Houston; they're looking good onboard.
3032423|CMP|Okay; SAFE the PYROs.
3032423|CC|Okay, America; Houston. I've got a short update on your Entry Checklist.
3032423|CDR|Go ahead.
3032423|CC|Over on page 2-4 of the Entry Checklist, middle of the page, we would like to delete, "EMS MODE to NORMAL" at that point. "EMS MODE to NORMAL," delete. We'd like to move it over on the 2-5 at 0.05 G time. Put "EMS MODE - NORMAL."
3032423|CDR|Okay; we'll get the EMS NORMAL at 0.05 G.
3032423|CC|Roger. We have no update on the entry pad. You are nominal at this time. I do have your weather information and your ship recovery call signs. Over.
3032423|CC|Okay; generally, the weather is good. It's 3000 foot, scattered, 10-miles visibility. Wind is 130 at 10; wave heights, 2 to 3 feet. Altimeter, 2994. The altimeter 2994 will give you a minus 17-foot DELTA-H which means, Gene, that when the altimeter says zero, you'll still be 17 feet in the air. The closest recovery forces, the prime recovery ship is the Tico, call sign "Tico. Closest recovery will be - aircraft will be a helicopter, call sign "Recovery," and a backup will be call sign "Swim," and they'll be on scene at splash. In case of a constant-g entry for any reason, the aircraft call sign is Samoa. Rescue 1 will be downrange and in the vicinity of the constant-g point. Over.
3032423|CDR|Okay, we got Tico. And the prime recovery ship -prime chopper - is Recovery. The backup is Swim, and we've got Rescue 1 Samoa, downrange.
3032423|CC|I guess that's uprange, depending on how you look at it, Gene.
3032423|CDR|(Laughter) Okay.
3032423|CC|Geno, with weather like that, even a Navy captain like you should make a good landing.
3032423|CDR|We'll hang in there, T. P. You know nobody likes a pitching deck, not even a Navy captain.
3032423|CC|Roger.
3032809|CDR|Houston, we'll be back with you and pick it up at 45.
3032809|CC|Roger.
3032809|CDR|America, Houston. We'll do our best to put it all together and come right down the stack, like you got me.
3032809|CC|America, Houston. We would like Jack to give us a call on VHF Alfa. We are reading good signal strength down-link at this time, and we'd like to get a signal strength up-1ink with him at this time, also. Check, please.
3032809|LMP|Okay, this is the LMP on VHF. How do you read? 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1. Over.
3032809|CC|Roger, LMP. You're coming through a little bit scratchy but sounds - we can read you. You're sounding good. How me on VHF?
3032809|LMP|You're loud and clear, Bob. Loud and clear.
3032809|CC|Okay; good VHF check.
3033231|CC|America, Houston.
3033231|CDR|Go ahead.
3033231|CC|Just a note of amplification on our change on 2-5 moving the EMS MODE NORMAL at .05 G time. If the .05 G light does not come on at .05 G time when you go to NORMAL there, plus 3 seconds, go to the normal backup procedures to start the EMS.
3033231|CMP|Okay; I understand that, Bob. Thank you.
3033231|CC|Okay, Ron; just a little reminder.
3033231|CMP|Mighty fine.
3033323|LMP|TAPE RECORDER is REWIND.
3033452|CMP|Okay, we're in RANGE SET. Okay, crank in 1044.9.
3033518|PAO|This is Apollo Control 43 minutes now to entry into the atmosphere. Altitude 6,868. Velocity 20,768 feet per second -
3033530|CMP|Okay, crank in 1044.9. Okay, inertial velocity, set. Slew to 36,172.
3033609|PAO|Some of the post atmospheric entry events are - begin blackout 17 seconds after entry; end blackout 3 minutes, 37 seconds; Drogue parachute deploy 7 minutes, 39 seconds; main parachute deployment 8 minutes, 26 seconds; Landing 13 minutes, 17 seconds after entry.
3033640|CMP|Okay, we got 36,172. Set. Okay, velocity at .05 G - Okay, let's see - ENTRY and STANDBY. Okay? FDAI SOURCE to ATT SET. ATT SET to GDC. EMS ROLL is ON. Okay, turning the old YAW. And it's 45 degrees to the right. And 45 degrees to the left. Okay; RSI is zero. EMS ROLL is OFF. Okay, let's align the old GDC again.
3033746|CDR|Houston, America. The EMS is initialized; the RSI is aligned; and we're ready to pick up the command module RCS checks.
3033754|CC|Roger. We're standing by, Gene.
3033805|CMP|Okay; GDC is aligned to the IMU. Okay? Verify A/C ROLL is OFF. RCS LOGIC, two circuit breakers are CLOSED. Okay, SCS. MINIMUM IMPULSE.
3033846|CDR|Okay, Houston, we're going to transfer the command module.
3033849|CMP|Okay. Just a little bitty blunk. Okay, the ring 1 is going OFF. Okay; we're operating on ring 2. Ring 2 is all MAIN B. You can hear it go click, click. Click, click, okay. (Laughter) Happy with ring 2. Okay, 1 is going up to ON; 2 is coming OFF. Okay, ring 1 is all MAIN A. Okay. Yes, you can see it, too, can't you? Okay, it works. Okay, ring 2 is going back to MAIN B. 1 is MAIN A; ring 2 is MAIN B. Okay? Okay. Okay, we still got control of the service module.
3034034|CDR|Okay, Houston, the RCS check looks good onboard.
3034038|CC|Roger, America; and it looked great down here.
3034041|CMP|CMC in AUTO. Yes, clock's running to RRT. Yes, it is.
3034107|CDR|Okay, Houston; America. We're on top of 2-2. We're going to stand by for 30 minutes.
3034114|CC|Roger. We're following you right on the line.
3034120|CMP|...
3034144|CMP|Twenty minutes to horizon check time. Okay, I'll get hack into - what is it - 268? That's good. Yes.
3034252|CMP|Okay, 29 seconds until .05 G, Vcirc is 02:09. Drogue, 07:39. Okay. And no .05 G light, P64 is running. We'll go to BACKUP, VHF RANGING at .05 G plus 3 seconds. Yes. We'll get the NORMAL first, that's the main thing; these things can come later. And then we'll get EMS ROLL on .05 G. Yes, let's see, the third one is really not going to -
3034405|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Apollo 17 spacecraft now 5,381 nautical miles and approaching ever faster to Mother Earth. 22,566 feet per second at the current time.
3034406|CMP|Yes, these are plus 3 seconds - .05 G time is 29 seconds plus 3 - plus 5 - and 29 plus 5. The way I understand it, anyhow, from what the ground said, is that the .05 G light will probably come on as soon as you go to NORMAL, anyhow. Yes. Yes
3034455|CMP|Slide sideways - you can just slide your foot in and out of the thing.
3034515|CMP|I wonder what 6-1/2 g's is going to feel like? That half a g on TEI (laughter) felt like I was in the back of the couch.
3034557|CMP|Thirty-three minutes. Yes, it will. Yes, it's right on. When is - begin blackout? And - Okay. Blackout 17 seconds. Okay. That's comm blackout, by the way. (Laughter)
3034652|CMP|Okay, getting ready for the BUS TIEs.
3034656|CDR|Okay, Houston, BUS TIEs are coming ON.
3034700|CC|Roger, America.
3034706|CDR|A/C is ON and verified, and B/C is ON and verified
3034727|CC|America, Houston. The batteries are online, and they look good to us.
3034732|LMP|Okay, and TAPE RECORDER's ON here.
3034752|CMP|Okay.
3034844|CMP|Okay. Let's start sep - sep checklist here.
3034846|CDR|Okay, Houston. We're pressing ahead here, about 5 minutes early.
3034851|CC|Roger.
3034855|CMP|Okay. ELS CSM SEP, BAT A. BAT B - CLOSED. Yes. Okay. I'll BYPASS the old primary RADIATORS. Okay, REPRESS PACKAGE valves going ON - O N. Okay. We'll cut off the service module's supply of oxygen. Okay. SURGE TANK is verified ON. Okay. PRESSURE RELIEF valves are verified NORMAL. Okay. We're verified in RCS COMMAND. Okay, SECONDARY FUEL is As, Bs, Cs, and Ds. All OPEN. VHF is off. HIGH GAIN.
3035038|LMP|Houston, loads appear to be balanced on main A, main B, fuel cells.
3035045|CC|Roger, Jack. We copy that.
3035131|CMP|Okay. Don't see anything yet.
3035133|CDR|Houston, step 5 on 2-2 is complete.
3035138|CC|Roger, America.
3035140|CDR|Or parentheses 5; I guess it is.
3035151|CMP|Okay.
3035350|CC|America, Houston. You may be interested. We've just taken another look at your last batch of data, and it confirms your pad. You are absolutely nominal - right on the pad.
3035403|CDR|That's good news, Robert. Thank you.
3035405|CMP|Outstanding.
3035409|CC|We aim to please.
3035412|CDR|Okay, and we're going to keep it nominal.
3035426|PAO|The velocity now is increased to 25,371 feet per second. The next major event will be separation of the service module and the SIM bay and all the scientific gear that has fed data down to the Earth for the past 12-1/2 days. 23 minutes now away from entry. We're standing by as communications continue to be quite good on the OMNI antennas through the Hawaii station. 36 minutes away from landing. At 303:55, this is Apollo Control standing by.
3035822|CMP|That's okay. We'll go in a little bit early.
3035919|CMP|Yes, they look pretty good. Hey, you can go ahead and go on through there and then I'll - RATE COMMAND. DEADBAND, MIN; V RATE to LOW - RATE - HALF - ya, okay, RATE to HIGH - Yes, that's better - DEADBAND MIN; RATE to HIGH. SCS. Oh, 1 minute. Okay. I doubt if we'll see it - we might, though.
3040014|CMP|Think you will? Yes, I don't know (laughter). I've got the Sun shining right in my left window here, so -
3040138|CMP|I don't see anything. Do you see anything, Jack? (Laughter) I don't either. Did it?
3040154|CMP|Yes, see I got too much shining in - light - sun shining in on there - glaring on the window. That's good, as long as it's there, somewhere. Oh, I see it! It's off to the left! Oh, it's out the left window (laughter). Okay, Yes. That's a dark horizon, though.
3040211|CDR|Okay, Houston. We've got the horizon, now. We're going out of plane, now.
3040215|CC|Roger.
3040232|CMP|Yes - see - see - You can see it better when you're out of plane. We must be just seeing the horn. Yes, it's the airglow, but see that's the horn that's been - we've been seeing all the time that's off to our left.
3040252|CMP|Yes, verify BYPASS.
3040256|CMP|Okay, and stand by. Hey, Jack, when I yaw down here, can you get a picture?
3040316|CMP|Okay, BMAGs, ATT l/RATE 2; RATE COMMAND; SCS. DEADBAND MIN; RATE to HIGH. COMMAND MODULE RCS LOGIC is ON. SECS LOGIC verified ON. Okay. Here come the pyros - PYRO A, PYRO B.
3040340|CDR|Okay, Houston. On my mark - I'm going to hit the CM/SM SEP.
3040344|CC|Roger.
3040346|CDR|3, 2, 1 -
3040350|CDR|MARK.
3040351|CDR|We got it.
3040351|CMP|Oh, ho! Did we get it! That thing really bangs, doesn't it?
3040401|CDR|Looks like we got a good separation, Houston.
3040404|CC|Roger.
3040406|CMP|Okay; MINIMUM IMPULSE. RATE 2.
3040412|CC|We're going to be handing over sites in 1 minute. There'll be a slight break of comm here.
3040417|CMP|Okay.
3040420|CC|We'd like you to go to OMNI Charlie.
3040427|CMP|OMNI Charlie.
3040433|CMP|Okay. We're yawing back to zero.
3040447|CMP|(Laughter) We've got junk all over the place (laughter). Okay, yes, wait a minute.
3040457|PAO|Altitude 1781 miles. Velocity 29,486 feet per second. 13 minutes away from entry, 26 from landing.
3040507|CMP|I'm going to take a look at the horizon here first. ENTRY; STANDBY; 36 170 1044. Okay. We're MINIMUM IMPULSE, RATE 2, SCS, DIRECTS are ON; AC, DC.
3040558|CMP|Yes, you can go ahead. I'm SCS, anyhow. It will be.
3040631|CMP|You know the sound of the jet firing is a lot louder than what we usually have the simulator set for.
3040651|CMP|Okay. We're back to the dark horizon again, but we'll pitch her on down. On? Okay, there you go. Got everything up.
3040719|PAO|Flight director, Neil Hutchinson, here in the control center is taking a final check among the flight controllers for reentry, an inevitable event in any case. 304:07 Ground Elapsed Time, 11 minutes away from entry, 24 minutes away from splashdown. Apollo Control standing by.
3040754|CMP|Okay. Okay, 4,153 miles to go. Velocity is 31,253 feet per second, increasing.
3040822|CDR|Okay, Houston. We're at 63, and we're just standing by for .05 G.
3040827|CC|Roger, America. You're looking great. We've got a TV picture of the weather in the recovery area, and the ship Ticonderoga, and it's looking great.
3040858|CMP|Probably warmup afterwhile, I bet. Well, this thing kind of wants to - wants to yaw left all the time.
3040940|CC|America, at 9 minutes prior to entry interface here, you're looking great down here.
3040946|CDR|Okay, Bob. We're looking good onboard and standing by for .05 G.
3041014|CMP|(Laughter)
3041038|CMP|(Laughter)
3041045|LMP|Houston, be advised that hydrogen tanks 1 and 2 still seem to be with us. At least I get gage readings - plus 200 psi.
3041055|CC|Roger. We'll run that one through EECOM.
3041059|CMP|(Laughter)
3041110|CMP|Well, that'll save you - save the 5/5 for a minute. DIRECTS are MAIN A and MAIN B? Both controllers are on? Think they got AC1. Should be 153, I think, isn't it? Here it is, right here. Yes, no more eating upside down. I was just getting used to that. It's a lot of fun. Getting use to it? I was use to it after the second day - first day. You know the - the - it wants to trim itself; pitch up too. I got to keep blapping the right yaw - and I got to keep pitching down, to make it go down. See the - the rate just decreases
3041223|CMP|Two minutes until moonset. I don't even see a Moon. There it is up there. Can you see it, Jack? It's out of window 3. It should be off to your right. You might be able to see it. That's the way the Moon looked about 13 - 14 days ago, isn't it? Small one like that.
3041319|CMP|Try the pressures on both rings? They still okay? Okay.
3041341|CMP|Five minutes to RRT.
3041403|CMP|304:16 on my card. What -
3041433|CMP|Yes, it's got a little bit of a cross - coupling on it. We might be picking up C-55 - might be picking up a few rates, anyhow. Probably not yet. Usually about 59.
3041501|RECOV|... Loud and clear, now. Nothing coming through on that transmitter.
3041511|CMP|Voice disappeared -
3041522|CMP|Couldn't see a star out there if you had to. There's all kinds of little white particles floating around out there from the jets.
3041533|PAO|Switching communications now, from the Hawaii tracking station, through the Apollo range instrumented aircraft in the Pacific.
3041547|CMP|Pitch is good.
3041549|RECOV|Four ... you're coming through now on the 18, loud and clear.
3041553|R-2|Roger. Stand by.
3041623|CMP|Houston, America. Do you still read?
3041626|CC|America, Houston. Read you loud and clear. We're going out through ARIA.
3041631|CMP|Okay.
3041633|CDR|And, Houston, mode set was on time.
3041635|CC|Roger.
3041638|CDR|And we're coming up on 2 minutes from RRT, and we're going for it.
3041643|CC|Roger, America. You're looking great.
3041646|CMP|There's the horizon.
3041648|CDR|Got the horizon, now.
3041717|CMP|... We're GO to CM.
3041725|CMP|Pressure's looking good. We got RATE COMMAND to go yet. And I'll get that? RATE 2 on the BMAGs.
3041735|CMP|Okay. You got a minute. 400,000 feet.
3041744|LMP|... really moving, isn't it.
3041746|CMP|Look at that ... go by.
3041753|LMP|Okay. Needle's off the peg now. It's looking good.
3041811|CMP|Jack, can you take a picture of that, too? Get a picture of that horizon - -
3041814|CDR|Is that pointing at the horizon?
3041816|CMP|Okay. No. That's all right; I'll get it. That's all right; I'm sorry.
3041832|CDR|Houston, we're 5 seconds from RRT.
3041837|CC|Roger, America.
3041840|CDR|RRT.
3041844|CMP|Okay. You want to go to RATE COMMAND?
3041853|CMP|Okay. .05 G is 29.
3041857|CDR|We have a glow -
3041901|PAO|And the beginning of blackout was at the predicted time of approximately 17 seconds after entry interface into the atmosphere - 400,000 feet or approximately 85 miles above the Earth. Come out of blackout in a total time of about 3 minutes 27 seconds. Following reappearance, at least from a communications standpoint, of the spacecraft. The drogue parachutes, which are 16-1/2 foot daimeter, two of them, will be deployed by a mortar - pyrotechnic device at 23,000 feet above the surface. The main parachutes, which consist of three 83-1/2 foot diameter ring sail parachutes, will be pulled out by pilot parachutes - small pilot parachutes at an altitude of 10-1/2 thousand feet. The spacecraft will splash down at approximately 22 miles per hour with 3 fully inflated parachutes. Meanwhile, the crew is using the entry monitor system to steer for the desired aiming point which is some 1,044 miles down range from the actual entry point into the atmosphere. The Entry Monitor System - or EMS as it's referred to, gives a display to the crew which gives them the roll angle to steer to the desired track downrange - to hit the aiming point. Now the position of the recovery ship, Ticonderoga, may or may not be near the aiming point. The accuracy of the landing is dependent on the distance from the aiming point, not from where the ship is at the time. Should be coming out of blackout, as mentioned earlier, at 3 minutes 37 seconds into entry. Less than a minute away and hopefully we will have confirmation from the crew on drogue deployment, and main parachute deployment, assuming that communications through the Apollo range instrumented aircraft called ARIA is good. The Tico - the Ticonderoga, prime recovery ship has reported that they have radar contact with the spacecraft. Probably a skin track of the spacecraft with the ship's radar. We've re-entered blackout - reappeared from blackout, I should say. We're waiting for a call from the space - from the CAPCOM.
3042252|CMP|Roll right 50 - still at 3 g's.
3042258|CDR|Okay.
3042258|CMP|... Okay. 3 gs. Got a potential of 130 - got a 130 range.

3050859|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The control room here is quite full of people. Off shift flight controllers, management people watching the recovery operations in progress on the large television projector at the front of the control room. Waiting for that moment when the crew is safely on the deck of the ship to fire up their traditional splashdown cigars.
3051522|SPKR|Land only long enough to drop off several of the photographers, the still photographers and the motion picture photographers from NASA who have been onboard. They will get themselves into position to photograph the ceremony and then the chopper will go back upstairs. Because Sam Drumy - our cameraman - the man who is giving us all those wonderful shots - the closeup shots of the command module on the water - we want to get back up topside so we can get more pictures of the Ticonderoga during the ceremony. The ceremony, itself, is outlined rather extensively in the instructional sheet and the astronauts are reading perhaps right now.
3051614|PAO|This is Apollo Control here in the Control Center. The Network controller has climbed a tall ladder to hang the final in the Apollo plaques along the upper wall of the Control Center. All the cigars are still unlit, waiting in the mouths of the flight control team, for the actual time the crew is safely on deck of the Ticonderoga. Waiting as the helicopters approach the ship, great deal of joviality under way here in the control center. Hand shaking, best wishes, from management, flight controllers, other people who have been associated with the Apollo Program for the past ten years. Network controller still at the top of his ladder spring loaded to hang the plaque on the wall.
3052157|SPKR|Since they are to go below deck and undergo a rather extensive medical - examinations maybe they'd just like to delay that just a little bit.
3052208|SPKR|...
3052211|SPKR|That is Samoa rescue 1. The airplane that has been up overhead and that was available if any other kind of rescue operation had been indicated, it wasn't. Everybody will start circling back toward this ship, including the radar planes that had been out to assist.
3052235|SPKR|And locate on the spacecraft as it came down toward the Pacific. And there will be some celebration on this ship. This evening a party with the astronauts and special guests - but most of the time after they get on the ship they will be spending in the scientific laboratories aboard. The ones that are prepared for the Skylab program that are being used here on the Apollo 17 mission. They won't even get a chance to take a shower for more than an hour. The other thing that they'd probably like to be doing is calling their families at home but there's no time located in the schedule for that. No time allocated for that until 5 o'clock this afternoon. Quick calculation tells us that that will be about 9 o'clock Houston time ladies so they will be calling you at that time. Now 001 and 002 moving in toward the deck of the Ticonderoga. Already the men are prepared to roll out that red carpet. And there's a shot from our photo helicopter. You can see landing on the fantail, 001 helicopter, you can also see 002 as it flies away. It will not be landing now because the recorders turned on and the ceremony will be ready to begin.
3052456|PAO|This is Apollo Control with the helicopter safely on the deck. The network controller, Dave Young, will hang the final plaque in the Apollo series on the upper wall of the control room here. And this circuit, known up until now as Gemini Control and Apollo Control will reappear as Skylab Control in the spring. This is Apollo Control out at 305:25 Ground Elapsed Time.
3052532|SPKR|- as soon as the door is opened. Also in the foreground the bald headed man in the middle of the picture, Dr. Don Stalkin who is a NASA team leader. He will be the first man on the deck to be seen by the astronauts. He will be the man who will step up to greet them, and to remind them again of what they have already been told on the instructional sheet. Watch out for your heads - for Schmitt and Evans. Step down three steps. Wave and smile. And the instruction sheet says follow me. ...
3052622|SPKR|Apollo 17 arriving.
3052625|SPKR|The carpet is down. (Music) All three men, one at a time. And now they are out on the deck. The middle man is Evans all right. (Cheer) And they are in proper array as the band strikes up Anchors Aweigh as could be predicted. Cernan in front, Schmitt in the middle. Being greeted by Admiral Butts, by Captain Norman Green and by Air Force General David Jones. Some pretty happy looking astronauts. On the stage that is prepared for them - Captain Green.
3052732|GREEN|It gives me great pleasure this morning, to welcome the crew of Apollo 17 back from the Moon to the deck of Ticonderoga. We on Ticonderoga are very proud to be a part of this historic mission. Chaplain John Ecker will offer our prayer to almighty God for the safe return of these three astronauts.
3052801|ECKER|The heavens declare your glory oh Lord. The planets, the sun, the moon, and the stars which you set in place, in humble gratitude we thank you for the safe return from your heavens of these pioneers in space.

3052830|SPKR|Commander of Manned Space Flight Recovery Forces Pacific. Rear Admiral John L. Butts.
3052841|BUTTS|(Applause) Captain Cernan, you and your crew of Apollo 17, all the men of the Recovery Force, all the ships, units and aircrafts, join me in expressing our great pride in your accomplishments today. And as you noticed Captain Cernan, on your left we have distinguished members of the Congress of the United States here to welcome you back aboard, as well as the Govenor of American Samoa. And all of these gentlemen join me in telling you how happy we are to have you home. I'd like to introduce Major General David M. Jones, The Department of Defense Manager for Manned Space Flight Support Operations. General Jones.
3052923|JONES|(Applause) On behalf of the entire Department of Defense Apollo Support Team, we're honored to welcome the crew of Apollo 17. The Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Teams that have supported the Apollo - entire Apollo Program are particularly pleased to offer our congratulations on your flawless performance. I am proud to present the crew of Apollo 17, Captain Gene Cernan, Dr. Jack Schmitt, and Commander Ron Cernan. And I believe it's all yours.
3053007|CERNAN|(Applause) Let me say that first of all, how good it is to be home. You know, no matter where you go or where the trip takes you, it's always good to get home. Admiral Butts, I'd like to congratulate you and really thank you for for allowing the three of us to be part of your recovery team, because, today was just absolutely fantastic. And a day I know we'll never forget as long as we live. And in all due respect to General Jones, we got our start on the Atlantic Missile Range so to speak. But, I think we just proved over these last 13 days, that when you want to end something right, whether it be a recovery or whether it be an Apollo Program, by golly, you've got to call on the Navy. (Cheers) And I'm going to see if I can talk Captain Green into splitting the miss distance with me today. And I don't think we have too much to quarrel about. I do want to say, this has been an extremely rewarding 13 days for us. Thirteen days that I hope, people throughout the world can share with us, when it was happening, and certianly, I hope, in the future after we sort of gather it all together and find out how much we really learned. We think we flew a good mission, we think we accomplished something, and by golly, we're proud of it. You know, a few years back, I was on a deck of a carrier like this after Apollo 10, when I came back from the Moon and I was extremely excited and enthused, certainly no more than I am now. But, I said at that time, when I came back and I just have reproved it to myself that, that nothing is impossible in this world, when dedicated people are involved. And it's a fundamental law of nature, that either you must grow, or you must die. Whether that be an idea, whether that be a man, whether that be a flower or a country, I thank God that our country is chosen to grow. I'm really proud to be here, I'm proud to be part of Apollo 17, I'm proud to be a part of NASA, I'm very proud to be a Captain in the Navy, and most of all, I'm proud to be an American. And I'd like to present another guy who's pretty proud to be an American, and in turn I'll let him present the 3rd member of our crew. But first, Commander Ron Evans. (Applause)
3053255|EVANS|Thank you, Gene, General Green, - Captain Green, (Laughter) Admiral. You know, about 6-1/2 years ago, I was fortunate enough to be on the Ticonderoga, where I was notified, of my selection to the Astronaut Corps. I think it's quite fitting that I should happen to have the opportunity to be picked up by the Tico after our journey to the Moon. To me that's really something. The fact that, it was the Ticonderoga, is part of the United States Navy, the fact that I'm a Commander in the United States Navy, and I flew the United States Spacecraft America, to the Moon and back, I'm really honored and I'm proud. That's about the best way I can express it. And I think right now I'd like to present our, not our 3rd crew member, but the 3rd member of the Apollo 17 crew. Jack Schmitt. (Applause)
3053408|LMP|Thank you. I'm happy to be here and I guess I never will be Navy. (Laughter) I'm sorry. But, if there was ever a team I'd like to be part of it's this one. Thank you very much. (Applause)
3053433|SPKR|And so the Astronauts are done with their ceremony and are doing what the sheet told them to not to do, they're shaking hands over there. The sheet said just step off the platform turn left and wave or salute, but they either forgot or decided to go ahead and do their thing anyway. The doctors had thought that the shaking of hands would take too much time away from their experiments. And now, Dr. Don ... is herding them away. He's got one, he's got two, he's got three. They're all going down below, for their medical examinations. (music)
3053524|SPKR|And so, again, man has been to the Moon; man has returned. Within an hour, while the astronauts undergo extensive physicals on the hanger deck below, the Ticonderoga will pluck the Command Module, America from the Pacific. Within a few days, scientists will being anew their probe into the origins of the universe. And while NASA people onboard are stiff-upper-liping it with talk of Skylab, there is a sense of nostalgia, a sense of loss. For them, Apollo has dated an era. Today, that era is done. This is David ... onboard the carrier, Ticonderoga.
