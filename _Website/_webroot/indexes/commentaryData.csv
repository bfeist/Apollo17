-023722|moonport||The countdown proceeded. At T-82 minutes launch control reported the cabin purge had been completed, and the booster protective cover closed. The spacecraft was pressurized and checked for leaks. Houston tested its command signals to the launch vehicle, and the first-motion signal was checked out with Houston and the Eastern Test Range; the next time, it would bring them word of liftoff. The last weather balloon was released to determine wind direction. In the meantime the C-band and Q-ball tests were in hand. The first was used in tracking to report range velocity during the powered phase. The Q-ball, perched above the launch escape system, would warn the spacecraft commander of deviations in the first stages of flight. Cernan reported things looking good "up here." His next task was to check out the emergency hand control for the service module engine, normally operated by a computer. Far below him, little white wisps marked the topping off of the propellant loads.
-021533|moonport||At T-1 hour, the close-out crew had secured the white room and was clearing the pad area. The elevators were set at the 96-meter level, for the astronauts' use in an emergency. At T-50 minutes the launch control center initiated the power transfer test, switching the vehicle momentarily onto its own battery power and then restoring external power. Some five minutes later, swing arm 9 - the access arm to the spacecraft - retracted 12 degrees to a standby position. Range safety test signals were flashing to the still unarmed destruct receivers.
-011623|Oral History 2000|LMP|We went into the final countdown and got to thirty seconds, and everything had come alive beneath us. The gimbals were moving and the rocket, you could feel it. You're lying there on your back, you could feel the engines moving down a football field below you or more, as it prepared for ignition.
-011602|moonport||At T-3 minutes and 7 seconds, the automatic sequencer took over. This sequencer, the oldest and most reliable piece of automation on LC-39, chose this moment in the launching of the last Apollo to cause trouble. At T-30 seconds it went into an automatic cutoff indicating that one of the essential operations leading to the launch of the space vehicle had not been properly completed. Besides halting the countdown, the cutoff started a series of "safing" procedures which included the return of swing arm 9 to a standby position.
-011602|Technical Debriefing|CDR|Ground communications with the spacecraft and all the launch preps for a nominal on-time launch went well. There were no spacecraft anomalies or problems during the launch prep. All systems checked out well. Controls and displays went well through T minus 30 seconds, when there was an automatic sequencer hold due to a potential problem that the ground support equipment saw on S-IVB pressurization. However, to the best of my knowledge, the S-IVB was GO on the cockpit displays. The S-IVB pressures were nominal, but, nevertheless, we had an automatic hold in the sequencer at T minus 30 seconds. From then on, for 2 hours and 40 minutes, we had a series of 20-minute recycles. I don't know exactly how many now. Did we ever get down to 8 minutes one time in the count?
-011602|Technical Debriefing|CMP|No. Once we got started below 20 minutes, we went all the way.
-010322|Oral History 1999|LMP|The one thing that you don't want to do is have a aborted launch on a launch pad and have to recycle and come back a month later and go through another month of simulator training. You're ready to go when you're ready to go. And I think everybody felt that way.
-010322|Oral History 2000|LMP|You certainly don't want to recycle for another month. That was the first thought we had on the launch pad when we did, in fact, have a delay, was that, well, let's hope that we don't have to go through this for another month. You would have gotten into it and done it and then never noticed the difference, but still at the immediate point of being ready to launch, you're ready to launch, there's no question about that.
-010133|Oral History 2000|LMP|Somewhere in the deep dark past of computer programming, a programmer had told the final sequencing checks that the computer was going to do - to look to see if a signal to pressurize a booster oxygen tank had been sent. Not whether it had been received and acted upon, but had the signal been sent.
-010133|Oral History 2000|LMP|Well, when they went through that particular point where that signal was supposed to have been sent and the tank pressurized, the signal didn't get sent. The computer didn't send the signal, but the person in the launch control center saw that that didn't happen and just pressed a button and pressurized the tank. So everything was fine, but the computer didn't know it. When they went through the final sequence, the computer saw that that signal hadn't been sent, and it said "Hold."
-010133|Oral History 2000|LMP|So the computer just shut everything down. That's what you want them to do, it's just that it was programmed wrong. Garbage in, garbage out. So what they did, they actually went into the launch computers, tracked down that point and hard-wired around that particular sensor so that the next time the computer went through, it would believe that the signal had been sent. Sure enough, it believed it, and off we went. We were two hours and forty minutes late, but, nevertheless, we were on our way.
-004926|Oral History 2000||Launch director Skip (Clarence) Chauvin explained the situation to the crew. Schmitt managed to nap during the delay.
-004926|Oral History 2000|LMP|Right at thirty seconds, Skip Chauvin came over the line and said we have a hold. I think Gene was more concerned than the rest of us, because none of us knew whether everything in the spacecraft and in the rocket knew we were in a hold. But we went through that thirty-second period and it was quiet for a few minutes. Then Chauvin came back on the line and said, "We have a problem with the launch computer. It's not a major problem. We're going to fix it and when we have it fixed, we'll recycle." I think it was eight minutes for a planned hold and then go through it again. That is exactly what happened.
-004926|Oral History 2000|LMP|At that point I felt very comfortable. I'd worked with Skip in many chamber tests and things like that, so we knew him very well, and from the sound of his voice, it didn't sound like anything that wasn't going to be fixed. So I fell asleep. Anytime you put fans humming or a little bit of vibration, things like that, I can go to sleep. There's no problem. So I got an hour or so dozing sleep while we were waiting for that problem to be fixed.
-000800|Technical Debriefing|CDR|The problem turned out to be apparently in the software of the ground support equipment. The workaround was caught up, checked out through the Cape and Marshall, and once the count picked up, we had two azimuth updates.
-000800|Technical Debriefing|CMP|We had two azimuth updates, because the first recycle was more than 20 minutes, wasn't it? It was more than 20 minutes and we recycled to that point and then they found out that they weren't going to be able to pick it up again in 20 minutes. And we stopped at 20 minutes and made the second azimuths.
-000800|Technical Debriefing|CDR|The point here being, both azimuth updates in the spacecraft went well. The CMP put them in the computer. The computer took it. I watched the IMU torque, After each one of those, they had to reset the GDC, which worked fine. So we launched with a good GDC following the platform. The only difference was a small roll angle, and it was reversed, because we had gone through 90Â° on the azimuth change. But that didn't really bother anything because the roll came in on time in a reverse direction. It was a small roll that culminated in just a few seconds.
-000400|Technical Debriefing|CDR|Distinction of sounds in launch vehicle sequence countdown to lift-off - I think the only thing that really comes across in there is that at some point you get a good vibration. At some point in the countdown, you get a good vibration as you're sitting up there. It's not part of the CSM's operation, so you're not sure what's going on. And this happened in the CDDT and, of course, all we did was check and find out we were doing something with the booster.
-000055|Technical Debriefing|CDR|The count and lift-off, through the yaw and the roll program, were nominal once we got through T-0. Distinction of sounds in launch vehicle sequence countdown to lift-off - I think the only thing that really comes across in there is that at some point you get a good vibration. At some point in the countdown, you get a good vibration as you're sitting up there. It's not part of the CSM's operation, so you're not sure what's going on. And this happened in the CDDT and, of course, all we did was check and find out we were doing something with the booster.
-000050|Technical Debriefing|CMP|When they ran through some gimbaling programs.
-000045|Technical Debriefing|CDR|The major portion of the launch count has to do with checking out the systems, so the commander stays very busy and many times on separate loops. The entire EDS system checked out very well. We only checked it out once in the initial count and during most of the recycle we stayed in EDS AUTO and then we de-armed EDS AUTO but still maintained a manual EDS capability to abort during that recycle time. We picked EDS AUTO as part of the T minus 20 recycle for final lift-off.
-000008|Technical Debriefing|CDR|The S-IC ignition - The lights started going out at 7 seconds, and somewhere around 3 seconds they were completely out. You could feel the ignition. You could feel the engines come up to speed. Just prior to lift-off and during the first few seconds of lift-off when we were near the pad, both the CMP and I could see the reflection of the engine ignition out the left-hand window and the hatch window in the BPC. We could not see the fire but could see a red glow through the windows reflecting apparently off the surface. Ignition was like a big old freight train sort of starting to rumble and shake and rattle and as she lifted off. We got a good tower clear.
0000001|Technical Debriefing|CDR|It was dark and we didn't see anything until S-IC ignition.
0000003|Technical Debriefing|CMP|I really wasn't watching the lights because I guess I didn't expect the thing to shake quite as much as it did. To me, I felt like I was really vibrating. I wanted to find out what was making me vibrate. I wasn't expecting that much vibration when the S-IC lit off. At lift-off, again, once it got vibrating, I didn't feel the yaw. I was watching the needle on the thing but didn't feel the yaw, though.
0000008|Technical Debriefing|CDR|Powered flight - During the actual powered flight of the S-IC you could not see anything at all. You couldn't see out the cockpit, as we had the lights up fairly bright.
0000113|Oral History 2000|LMP|I think everybody [who] rode a Saturn V was tremendously stimulated by the experience. It's a very heavy vibration. Very slow acceleration at first, but heavy, heavy vibration as the five F-1 engines in the first stage, the S-IC, are fighting each other to some degree. You build up, over two minutes and forty-five seconds, about 4 Gs acceleration.
0000123|Technical Debriefing|CDR|As you go through MAX Q, as in the past, it gets very rough and much noisier, but I don't think we ever had any trouble hearing each other in the spacecraft. I had my intercom very high and all my S-bands and tweaked everything up prior to lift-off. We went through max-q and the only unusual thing going through max-q, considering wind components that we had was that I saw 25 percent on the ALPHA going through max-q. The yaw needle was right on, but the pitch needle had dropped to a degree and a half at the most. I guess I didn't really expect it because of the predicted wind components. After we got through max-q, you could still certainly tell the bird was burning as we pressed on toward staging, but it got much quieter and it was very evident that you were through max-q when that time came.
0000123|Technical Debriefing|CMP|The shaking increased a little bit up to MAX Q and then there was a different type of shaking. It was more of a vibration, I think, going through MAX Q. And there was more noise associated with going through MAX Q.
0000235|Technical Debriefing|CDR|If you want to put them in more layman terms, I think the S-IC acted and performed like some big, old, rugged, shaky, big monster. It has to be noisy, has lots of vibration, and smoothed out somewhat after max-q, but still was a rumbling bird.
0000235|Technical Debriefing|LMP|I think that it is good to do a lot of simulation about malfunctions during launch, but up through max-q it is a little bit unrealistic to think that you are going to analyze a malfunction in the spacecraft.
0000235|Technical Debriefing|CDR|To sum up the S-IC, I personally didn't think it was any different than my previous ride on the S-IC and up through this point being a night launch really didn't make any difference at all. The only thing I did different that I hadn't really though a lot about until I sat on the pad and began to think about staging was, just prior to staging, I took my hand off the abort handle and held the support arm rather than the translation control handle until after staging. I did this just a couple of seconds prior to staging. I had talked about it with John Young a little bit prior to the flight and it turns out that's what he did, also. Probably a good thing.
0000244|Technical Debriefing|CMP|Of course, with the shutdown of the S-IC, I think that was about 4-1/2g.
0000244|Technical Debriefing|CDR|We pushed 4g.
0000244|Technical Debriefing|LMP|Just pushing 4g on the thing and it quits just like that. I was prepared for it because Gene had said, "Hey, brace yourselves because it is going to happen," and it happened all right. It just flat quit when we went from 4g to 0.
0000244|Technical Debriefing|CDR|The great train wreck.
0000244|Technical Debriefing|LMP|I think in all those booster cutoffs, it's hard to see how rapidly the g-level decreases.
0000244|Oral History 2000|LMP|Very slow acceleration at first, but heavy, heavy vibration as the five F-1 engines in the first stage, the S-IC, are fighting each other to some degree. You build up, over two minutes and forty-five seconds, about 4 Gs' acceleration. At that point everything shuts down. You drop off the first stage and then you ignite the second stage, the S-II, and you're back on your way, but only at one and a half Gs. So there's a big change, it's from 4 Gs to minus one and a half, as the whole stack unloads, to plus one and a half, as you go on on the second stage. And that all happens in just slightly over a second. So that is probably the most dynamically exciting point in the mission, certainly in the launch part of it. From then on it's pretty straightforward. You get into orbit in about ten minutes using all three stages.
0000249|Technical Debriefing|CDR|We had center engine shutdown on time. We had staging on time. ... At staging, the S-IC shut down, something that you don't see in the daylight is that the fireball overtook us.
0000249|Technical Debriefing|CMP|It sure did.
0000249|Technical Debriefing|CDR|When the S-II lit off, we literally for a nanosecond flew through the bright yellow fireball that was left over from the S-IC. ... I don't think it's ever been recorded on a daylight launch before, but as soon as the S-IC shut down during the time involved in recycling and getting the staging sequence going and the S-II lit off, apparently the trailing flame of the S-IC overtook the spacecraft when we immediately went into that zero-g condition. And, for just a second, as the S-II lit off, we went through the flame. It was very obvious. We could see it out of both windows. I particularly could see it out of the left-hand rendezvous window of the BPC. It was not a smoke; it was not an orange fireball; it was just a bright yellow fire of the trailing flame of the S-IC; and it happened for just a split second. Then we got off on the S-II and things got very quiet and very smooth and was a very long, quiet, smooth ride.
0000316|Technical Debriefing|CDR|We got skirt sep right on time. I could feel skirt sep going.
0000320|Technical Debriefing|CDR|We had tower jett, which was really sort of spectacular at night. I think the LMP is going to add something to it, but from the left-hand rendezvous window, I could not only see the flame, but the inside of the BPC seemed to be lit up. Of course, it doesn't stay there very long; it's gone in just a split second. But it was a very spectacular sight at night to see that tower go against the blackness of space out there.
0000320|Technical Debriefing|CDR|Tower jett was very evident. You could see the flash and I could see the entire BPC. I could see underneath it. It was lit up underneath. The whole thing was lit up.
0000320|Technical Debriefing|LMP|On the tower jett, I wouldn't say a split second. As a matter of fact, I was surprised it lasted as long as it did. It was a few seconds.
0000320|Technical Debriefing|CMP|I couldn't see the rocket go. All I could see was an orange glow out the center window.
0000336|Technical Debriefing|CDR|We could see guidance come in very definitely. It was not as big a pulsation as I've seen on the simulator but I did see the needle and the spacecraft did change its attitude slightly. You could see the mixture ratio shift. It was just a long, smooth, quiet ride.
0000458|Technical Debriefing|CDR|While we were on the S-II, we would see no indication of light from the engines. We were just thrusting out in the darkness of space. I tried to see stars for potential mode IV and, of course, at that time, mode II abort and turned the lights down on the left side once or twice. But even with the lights down on (we had the LEB lights relatively low), in my estimation, it would have required all the lights in the spacecraft to have been off and certainly more than a few seconds to become night adapted to be able to see through the windows and pick up stars that would have been able to help in an abort situation had you lost the computer and the SCS. We had looked, potentially planned to use those stars in an abort condition if we had to. We had excellent constellations to look at. They obviously were there, but I could not see through the low glow reflection on the window even with our lights, floodlights, turned almost all the way down. I even went to the extent of trying to shield my eyes on the S-II and looked out the window and I still could not pick up anything that I could have recognized for an abort. I also could not pick up any night horizons during that point in time which I thought I might be able to base on seeing where the stars cut off and where they do not.
0000458|Technical Debriefing|LMP|We had another indication of that during entry when we were looking for a night horizon and finally saw it, but it was extremely hard to find.
0000740|Technical Debriefing|CDR|Inboard cutoff was right on time. You could feel it, a definite physiological feeling. Of course, the g-meter saw it also.
0000937|Technical Debriefing|CDR|The S-I cutoff, as Jack said, is again very sharp, almost instantaneous, from almost 4g to 0. But on the S-II, although it's sharp and a very hard hit, you don't unload the entire stack like you do when you're on the S-IC. The staging was very smooth. It did not seem like an exceptionally long time before we separated and the S-IVB lit off.
0000937|Technical Debriefing|CDR|I could see nothing on S-II until S-II shutdown. I could see the glow of S-IVB ignition. I say the glow of S-IVB ignition, it very easily could have been the fireball of S-II which tried to overtake us but couldn't quite make it. But there was a glow right during the period of S-II shutdown to S-IVB ignition. During the S-IVB burn, you could see the glow of the aft engines throughout the burn and throughout the orbital [operation?]
0000937|Technical Debriefing|CDR|We got lit off on the S-IVB, and, unlike the flame we flew through on the S-II, we did not do that on the S-IVB. I don't know where the reflection came from, but I could see the reflection from somewhere out the forward window. Either it was the S-II trailing flame trying to overtake the vehicle but didn't quite make it, or it was S-IVB ignition reflecting off the S-II because there's no atmosphere up there at that point. But I did not see a flame, but a residual back light out that window just for a short period of time, either right at staging or just at S-IVB ignition. As I think back, my best guess would be that the same thing happened on the S-II, that the trailing flame, when you go from 4g to 0 instantaneously, tends to overtake the vehicle. But in the case of the S-II, it's not nearly as big a pattern and just didn't quite make it up the stack. I just saw some of the glow of it. That's my best guess. After the S-IVB ignited, we never saw anything except the APS firing throughout that burn. You could see the mixture ratio shift.
0000937|Technical Debriefing|LMP|But PU shift, both vehicles, was surprisingly noticeable.
0000937|Technical Debriefing|CDR|The S-II was a Cadillac: quiet, less than 1g flight most of the time until we built up our g-load prior to staging. It was quiet, smooth, had very little noise, or feeling of rumbling or anything else.
0001154|Technical Debriefing|CDR|Communications throughout the booster phase were excellent. I never had any problem hearing either Stony or CAPCOM. Controls and displays performed super. Crew comfort through powered flight - I felt very comfortable throughout the entire flight in orbit.
0001154|Technical Debriefing|CDR|As far as I'm concerned, there was no pogo on the burn.
0001154|Technical Debriefing|CMP|No, none.
0001154|Technical Debriefing|CDR|Summing up the birds. If you want to put them in more layman terms, I think the S-IC acted and performed like some big, old, rugged, shaky, big monster. It has to be noisy, has lots of vibration, and smoothed out somewhat after max-q, but still was a rumbling bird. The S-II was a Cadillac: quiet, less than 1g flight most of the time until we built up our g-load prior to staging. It was quiet, smooth, had very little noise, or feeling of rumbling or anything else. The S-IVB: a light little chugger is probably the best way I can describe it, which is not different than I remember it in the past. It just sort of rumbled on, not anywhere near the extent of the S-IC, but just sort of continued to rumble on through the burn. After a while, especially during TLI, it got to be a very pleasant, warm feeling that she was burning like she should burn.
0001154|Technical Debriefing|CMP|Chugging, I think, has two different connotations. I felt the S-IVB was more of a very light rumble in the background, something that is kind of rumbling as opposed to chugging. A chug to me is a bang-bang type thing, and to me it was more of a rumble.
0001154|Technical Debriefing|LMP| agree, it may be a sense of rumbling but the ride was smooth. I could sense some activity behind it, but I wouldn't have said that it was chugging.
0001154|Technical Debriefing|CDR|I'll modify chugging to say it was a hummocky chug, just a rolling type. Nothing different, and, as I say, the best recollection, similar to the S-IVB I had the opportunity to ride on before, but probably even more steady and continuous flow of light rumbling.
0001300|Technical Debriefing|CDR|Evaluation of insertion parameters - We got a good onboard orbit. Ground gave us a GO for orbit. The postinsertion systems configuration systems checkout and the complete spacecraft and booster preparation for TLI went extremely smooth and extremely rapid.
0001300|Technical Debriefing|CDR|Earth orbit - I might comment that the availability of stars for a mode II or mode IV abort was pretty poor for two reasons. Number one: night adaptability because we had lights very bright. When we turned the lights down in the cockpit, I could not pick out distinct constellations such as Orion, which I was planning on using for a mode IV abort. If we would have had an SCS and G&N problem it would have been very difficult to pick out stars for that abort.
0002356|Technical Debriefing|CDR|Launching at night, we just had a somewhat different view of the Earth than most other flights have had. The first real view we got of being in orbit at that point was pretty spectacular because it happened to be Earth sunrise and that's a very intriguing and interesting way to get your first indoctrination to Earth orbit.
0002356|Technical Debriefing|LMP|The transcript contains some descriptions, by all three of us, of sequences of that sunrise which, in the color banding, may be of some significance for other people.
0002356|Technical Debriefing|LMP|I think the tapes cover some comments on the Earth illumination at the horizons. Briefly, right at the terminator horizon of the Earth, you get sharp shadow definition of cloud features. At the sunlit horizon from lunar distance that's a very clear definition between the black of space and the upper portion of the Earth. In Earth orbit and near Earth, you can see the gradation of that horizon caused by the atmosphere. At night around the Earth, there's a very clear horizon glow all around the Earth. Air glow, I guess you would call it. And the horns of the crescent Earth are much sharper and elongated compared to those of the crescent Moon, as if light was being diffracted into the atmosphere and in extending the length of the horns of the crescent.
0012248|Technical Debriefing|CDR|By the time we came back over the States on the first pass, we were ready and the spacecraft was ready, and we were configured and could have gone on a TLI-0 without any hurrying and scurrying whatsoever. From that point on, when we got our GO on the booster and a GO for TLI-1, it was an Earth-orbit, an extra Earth-orbit ride to sit back and just monitor our systems in the spacecraft and see what we could see from Earth orbit in terms of viewing. It was an extra 90 minutes of the flight that, if you really had to do without, you could have. And it was not hurried. It was very comfortable, even progressing toward the TLI-0.
0012248|Technical Debriefing|LMP|Let me add just a couple of things. One thing that we had because of the later launch was a number of LOS/AOS updates to plot which did not interfere with our getting through the checklist. The checklist, I had a feeling, went more slowly than it ever had. But, as Gene says, still with plenty of time to meet the zero up time and to have essentially a whole daylight pass to just relax and look at the Earth. We had one note here. I didn't even remember until I read it here that in the ECS checks the hydrogen pressure indicators, or part of the indicators, were reading about 10 percent lower than we expected. But, as I recall, it may have been expected.
0022945|Technical Debriefing|LMP|The communications all through Earth orbit were excellent, as I recall. There was no difficulty getting the pads up. They came up expeditiously and well read. We actually gained a little time because we didn't have television. But we didn't need it. We could have configured it for use.
0022945|Technical Debriefing|LMP|If there's ever any attempt to do weather observing from Earth orbit, in the low orbit like that, you're going to have to have a very clear plan of where you're looking at what time you're looking in order to make reference as to where you are because you're moving so fast. You can't really keep track of where you are and specifically in terms of weather observation. Later on, once you get the whole globe in view, it's a relatively simple thing to pin down to within a few degrees of latitude and longitude where you are looking on the Earth.
0022945|Technical Debriefing|CDR|On all these lunar missions, we've never really done much in Earth orbit except get prepared for the TLI burn. Future Earth-orbit flights need this continual map update, you're right. You have to do that. As I think back to 3 days in Earth orbit, unless you continually follow a map and a map update as to your rev as you progress around the world, what part of that world you're looking at is very difficult to follow except the precise piece of real estate you're flying over.
0022945|Technical Debriefing|LMP|The lunar orbital operation is somewhat different because you stay in the same groundtrack much longer I think.
0031240|Technical Debriefing|CDR|The TLI burn from the ground targeting point of view and targeting went just as written. We went down the checklist and cue card without any problems or any anomalies, without any changes except to the manual. We had a change to all our manual angles to monitor the S-IVB burn because of the late lift-off. We wrote those down on our cue cards and were going to use those in case we had to take over during the burn. We had to change to the nominal and we rewrote both of those on our cue cards. That's the only basic change I think we had.
0031455|Technical Debriefing|LMP|We all were very aware of PU shift.
0031455|Technical Debriefing|CDR|I guess I could have called that or I was looking forward to seeing it. It is on my checklist. It's on my cue card and I've looked for it and I've seen it in the simulator.
0031455|Technical Debriefing|LMP|It just didn't register in the simulators, I guess.
0031553|Technical Debriefing|CDR|When we burned out of Earth orbit, we started the burn in darkness and flew right on through a sunrise during the TLI burn. This was pretty spectacular. We shut down in daylight and had no other visual sightings at that point in time.
0031553|Technical Debriefing|LMP|And the other thing flying through that sunrise, it did to a small degree interfere with visibility in the cockpit.
0031553|Technical Debriefing|CDR|It didn't bother me from the standpoint of monitoring on my side at all.
0031921|Technical Debriefing|CDR|The S-IVB performance was outstanding. She lit off on time and burned for 5 minutes and some odd seconds as I recall. And we had shutdown on time. The residuals and the EMS on the spacecraft are written down somewhere, but they were all very nominal, very excellent. We stayed in IU. As the S-IVB maneuvered, we flew through a sunrise during TLI, which in itself was also very interesting, very spectacular. We had nominal S-IVB performance after shutdown; and maneuvering to the sep attitude, we went through checkout load NOUN 17 and NOUN 22. There was again no noticeable pogo. The S-IVB sounded and performed just like it did on the insertion phase burn and I'll let the CMP pick up the separation and the transposition and docking.
0034243|Technical Debriefing|CDR|As I recall, we undocked and separated just a little earlier than had tentatively been planned, but that was no problem because we were ready to do it.
0034243|Technical Debriefing|CMP|As far as the separation from the SLA, it was nominal. There's a louder bang than I expected from pyros.
0034243|Technical Debriefing|CDR|Translunar/transearth - After CSM separation from the booster and docking with the LM several hours later, we could see something which may have been the S-IVB or SLA panels. As soon as we turned around for docking I could see three of the four SLA panels tumbling slowly in space. This is not unusual. That's been seen before.
0034243|Technical Debriefing|CMP|I never did see a SLA panel.
0034243|Technical Debriefing|CDR|There seemed to be an awful lot of particles with us continually throughout the flight, both in transearth and translunar coast and in lunar orbit. These particles were obviously residue from the RCS. Others were from dumped residues. They seemed to be hanging around the LM as a result of pulling in and out of the S-IVB and they were always small particles. Some, initially, were pieces of Mylar from the S-IVB LM separation. The others were just like small dump crystals or residue. On the LM, particularly, when you fire the RCS you could see the RCS residue.
0034243|Technical Debriefing|CMP|That residue from the RCS didn't look a lot different than a waste-water dump.
0034243|Technical Debriefing|CDR|That's right, except that it's less dense.
0034905|Technical Debriefing|CMP|This is the first time that I really noticed that in the plus-X translations, or in any translations as far as that goes, you get about 0.4 degrees per second rates within the dead band. As opposed to the simulator, it has about 0.1 degrees per second on any of the translations maintaining attitude.
0034905|Technical Debriefing|CMP|Formation flight was great. The S-IVB by itself was as steady as a rock out there. No problems. I couldn't tell it was dead banding or moving at all. I came in relatively slow, about 0.1 ft/sec, somewhere in that area.
0035731|Technical Debriefing|CMP|Docking was nominal. As soon as he got capture on the thing, there were no rates. Everything was steady. I didn't have to handle the translation controls or null rates at all. We went directly to hard dock. There's more spacecraft movement during that period because I feel that the COAS and the docking target were off a little bit. And I don't say misaligned, but it's a little bit off. But, of course, it was in limits and was no problem.
0035731|Technical Debriefing|CDR|When we went to retract, we got our big ripple fire - bang on the latches, so we had a relatively good hard dock. We only got one gray indication on the talkbacks. The other one was barber pole.
0035731|Technical Debriefing|LMP|There's a lot of descriptive material, I think, in the transcript on that. As I recall, we got two pulses in the ripple fire. It seemed like there was one or two latches and then the ripple fire.
0035731|Technical Debriefing|CDR|I just recall a woomph!
0035731|Technical Debriefing|LMP|I think, if you look at the transcript, we said that there were two pulses to it.
0042625|Technical Debriefing|CDR|Subsequent inspection of the latches showed that there were three latches which were not made entirely. One of them, as I recall, had to be recocked. Anyway, it turned out that once we got those three latches (which at that time looked like they were operating properly) reset, we got two barber poles on the talkbacks. Ultimately, latch 4 was found to be unseated on the ring, although, at that time, it looked nominal.
0044617|Technical Debriefing|CDR|The attitudes given us were excellent; we were able to watch the S-IVB maneuver. We were able to see the S-IVB vent and it all went well and nominal.
0044617|Technical Debriefing|LMP|It was very clean as far as any debris or anything coming out during the docking phase, and I could see a few little things that were bouncing around inside around the LM, particles of some kind. It was nothing like previous flights where they had a lot of debris. It was very clean.
0045937||summary|While they waited for the S-IVB burn, Cernan reported that, while he knew "we're not the first to discover this, but we'd like to confirm, from the crew of Apollo 17, that the world is round." In the two hours since the TLI burn, they had moved out far enough - about 16,600 miles - that they could see the whole Earth. Because of the Moon's position in its orbit, they were south of the terrestrial equator, over the southern tip of Africa, and had no trouble seeing Antarctica. The Earth was nearly full and, at 30,000 miles, they took a stunning portrait of the planet.
0055102|Technical Debriefing|LMP|Partly, I used try glasses because they do have a small correction for my astigmatism, and that did increase the resolution with which I could view the surface. Looking at the Earth and translunar coast with the sunglasses, I often did that for the correction. I used the binocular and the sunglasses and it did seem to help the resolution of viewing cloud patterns and geographic locations. When I used the sunglasses they seemed to be very adequate in terms of the level in which they reduced the brightness. As soon as I looked in the cabin to look at instruments and this sort of thing, the glasses did inhibit the observation of those instruments and the lettering on the panels, and I would push them up on my forehead for cabin work.
0055225||summary|Throughout the outbound journey, they had a good view back toward Earth. Schmitt, in particular, provided lengthy and detailed weather reports, complete with predictions. His first report, given while Cernan and Evans were getting out of their suits, went on for a full half hour and, as the Earth turned beneath them, he could update his predictions for various parts of the world. Later in the mission, CapCom Gordo Fullerton told him, "You're a regular human weather satellite."
0090000||summary|Nine hours into the mission, they were ready to sleep. Cernan wore a headset in case Houston needed to talk; and he also wore biomedical sensors so that the flight surgeon could watch his heart rate and other vital signs. On this first night, none of them got more than about three hours of sound sleep but, for the next few days, the work load would be relatively light and there would be plenty of time to get adequate rest.
0150245||summary|On the morning of this second day, Houston was ready to discuss a reset of the mission clocks so that when they got to lunar orbit at the pre-planned time, the clock time would agree with the times printed in the flight plan. In essence, they needed to add two hours and forty minutes to the actual elapsed time and Houston was looking for a spot in the flight plan where the reset could be done without significant disruption. Their first thought was to do the whole correction at 65 hours. However, the choice would shorten that work day from 16 hours to 13 1/3 hours and, after some thought, Houston decided that it would be best to modify the schedule in two stages and avoid any more disruption of the sleep/wake cycle than was already necessary. Between 46 and 65 hours after the actual launch, they would move all activities up one hour. That is, they would do the activities scheduled at 52 hours at 51 hours of elapsed time. Then, at 65 hours they would set the clocks forward to 67:40. It was a bit confusing, even to the crew, but it avoided two clock changes and, because there were to be relatively few things going on between 46 and 65 hours, there would be only a few pencil changes in the flight plan.
0212824||summary|About six hours after their first wake-up in space, Schmitt got down under one of the couches and, by holding onto one of the struts, was able to get some exercise by running in place on the bulkhead of what was called the Lower Equipment Bay. Before starting, his heart rate had been about 60 beats per minute and, much to the surgeon's pleasure, he was able to get his rate up to about 140. What is more, the engineers reported that he shook the spacecraft hard enough to stir the liquid oxygen in the Service Module tanks. Each of the tanks contained a fan and, when the fan wasn't running, heat losses at the walls created temperature gradients in the tank, a circumstance that the engineers wanted to avoid. By exercising, Schmitt had saved them the trouble of turning on the fan, thereby saving a little spacecraft power.
0252626||summary|The second day was purposefully short. The landing was scheduled for about 2:30 p.m., Florida time, and the crew was then going to do a full EVA before getting to bed. They wanted to wake up on landing day at about 7:30 a.m., Florida time, and it had been decided that, after the disruption of their sleep cycle caused by the night launch, it would be best to get back to a morning wake-up as early in the flight as possible. After launching, they hadn't gotten to sleep until it was about dawn at the Cape, and then their first wake-up came at about 3:30 in the afternoon. However, by having only a ten-hour second day, they were asleep by 1:30 a.m. Florida time and could wake up at 9:30 a.m. with most of the adjustment already made and with three more sleep periods to go before landing day. With the help of a Seconal sleeping tablet, each of them got 7 1/2 hours of sound sleep on their second night in space and awoke feeling well rested and ready to go.
0341019||summary|By now, they were a bit over half way to the Moon, about 125,000 miles out from Earth and the spacecraft was working beautifully. They had been consuming maneuvering fuel, water, oxygen, and electric power at very close to the predicted rates; and they were being conscientious about eating and drinking enough to keep the surgeon happy. After Schmitt reported on the weather for southern Africa and Argentina, Fullerton read a news summary that included items such as the ongoing negotiations in Paris between the United States and North Vietnam, the medical condition of former President Harry Truman, and the start of the Texas state high school football playoffs.
0353000||summary|The first big event of the day was a midcourse trajectory correction which came about two hours after wake up, an exceedingly modest two-second burn of the Service Module Engine.
0425932||summary|The crew ran a small, self-contained, heat-flow-and-convection experiment which proved to be so fascinating that Houston had to remind them to take care of some other items in the checklist. Schmitt thought that it was the best Saturday afternoon matinee he'd seen in a long time and wished that they'd had some popcorn.
0563540||summary|For this third rest period, Houston gave the crew of Apollo 17 a full eight hours and, for the first time in the mission, Fullerton had to wake the crew out of a sound sleep. As a wake-up call, he used the stirring strains of the Jayhawk Fight Song, in honor of Ron Evans' alma mater, the University of Kansas. It was going to be another quiet day and Schmitt thought their only problem was going to be keeping Evans from going back to sleep.
0595753||summary|Schmitt got back in the LM and powered it up for about a half hour so that Houston could take a look at the telemetry system. He made another brief check of the comm system and, as Houston had expected after thinking about things overnight, the previous day's problems were confirmed as being problems on the ground, rather than in the spacecraft.
0631015||summary|While they got ready for lunch, Cernan took a look back at Earth, conscious that this would be the last trip anyone would make out this far for some time to come. He told Houston "You can look right down at the Cape area - that's the Cape that we know, in Florida - and it's a little disheartening because the last time I was up here (on Apollo 10) looking back from this angle, they were moving another Saturn V for another Moon trip out on the pad already."
0634946||summary|The preparations for lunch took a bit longer than usual and the reason was that Evans couldn't find his scissors. The food, much of it dehydrated, was sealed in tough plastic bags. Each of them carried a pair of good quality surgical scissors so that they could cut the bags and get at the food. Without his scissors, Evans would get mighty hungry and his one hope, short of finding his own, was that Cernan or Schmitt would lend him a pair while they were down on the surface. After some joking about his predicament, they agreed to leave a pair behind.
0650000||summary|After lunch, it was time to reset the clocks. Fullerton read them an explanation written for the press by the Public Affairs Office and, if possible, it was worse than what I wrote for this summary. Certainly Fullerton and the crew had a good chuckle over it. The important point was that, after lunch, they were 65 hours into the mission but had completed all the planned activities up to 67:40. Now, they could change the clocks and, from then on, behave as though they had launched on time.
0680751||summary|ALFMED (Apollo Light Flash Moving Emulsion Detector). On early missions, various astronauts had reported that, with their eyes closed, they sometimes saw brief streaks of light. The most reasonable explanation is that their retinas were being triggered by cosmic rays and, to test the hypothesis, Evans donned a helmet that covered his eyes and also contained slowly-moving plates of photographic film that would record any cosmic rays entering his head. He wore the detector for an hour and reported all of the flashes that he saw. These were later compared with the film record. As a control, Cernan wore a blindfold and also reported any light flashes he saw. It took Evans and Cernan about fifteen minutes to get sufficiently dark adapted that they began seeing flashes. Thereafter, they reported events about once every 2 1/2 minutes.
0813100||summary|Cernan was the first up on Day 5. Houston had decided to give the crew an extra half hour of rest, but the Commander was awake before Houston could send a wake-up call. On this night, he hadn't taken a Seconal and had still managed about 5 hours of good sleep. Schmitt had taken a tablet in order to get to sleep and had slept soundly for over seven hours. Evans had also taken a Seconal but said that he thought he'd tossed and turned most of the night. However, the surgeon said that, although his periods of restlessness had been evident in the biomed data, none had been any longer than about ten minutes and it looked as though he'd gotten about 7 hours of good sleep.
0841253||summary|During launch from Earth and during the coast out to the Moon, the SIM Bay had been covered with a protective panel; but, now that the spacecraft was approaching lunar orbit, the experimenters were eager to get data and it was time to jettison the SIM Bay door.
0844247||summary|By later standards, the on-board Apollo computers were fairly primitive. The crew sometimes had to enter data (called Nouns) manually on a keyboard and then tell the computer what actions (called Verbs) to take. Memory was limited, although there was room for enough information that the computer could fly the nominal flight plan without minute by minute instructions from the crew. Houston could feed data for normal flight procedures directly into the computer when the crew set it up in Program 00 (called "pooh" for short) and put it in the Accept mode. For emergency purposes - say if they had to abort the mission and had lost communications with Earth - Houston occasional read up data "pads" which Schmitt then wrote into the appropriate blank spaces in the Flight Plan book. Because of the launch delay and the usual slight deviations of the trajectory from the planned path, Houston had a great deal of data to read up. Thanks to long hours of repeated practice, Schmitt and the ground team got the work done smoothly and without error. Slowly, Fullerton would read up a block of data and then Schmitt would read back what he had written before they moved on to the next block.
0864630||summary|All through the journey out from Earth, the crew had gotten a good view of Earth. As we have discussed, during the early hours of the mission they had been treated to a nearly full Earth. By now, their trajectory had carried them to a point where the Earth was about two-thirds full. Most of the time, they had been flying the spacecraft with its long axis oriented perpendicular to the Sun, slowly rotating around that axis so that all parts of the spacecraft would be heated uniformly. Informally, this was called the Barbecue mode or, in formal NASA-ese, the Passive Thermal Control (PTC) mode. There were five windows: one over each of the seats that gave a view more or less at right-angles to the long axis, and two others that gave a view forward for use during rendezvous and docking. For about two-thirds of each spacecraft rotation they had a good view of Earth. During the other half of each rotation, they had, in principle, a view of the Moon. However, because they were going to be landing at an eastern site just after local dawn, the Sun had been behind the Moon throughout most of the flight out from Earth. Therefore, the side of the Moon that they could see, the Nearside that always faces Earth, was in darkness and it wasn't until they got close that the perspective changed enough to see any of the sunlit portions. At a mission time of 86:46 - according to the reset clocks - Cernan reported their first view of the Moon.
0864703||summary|They were only about 5000 miles out and the Moon looked so big that Cernan had the impression that they were "coming right down on top of it". Half jokingly, he asked Fullerton if the tracking people were sure that they were going to miss the edge. Was the low point really going to be 73 miles as planned?
0865201||summary|They had to shield their eyes to see the Moon because, at the moment, the Sun was sitting right on the lunar horizon.
0875104||summary|Although Cernan had been to the Moon before, on the Apollo 10 approach the western Nearside limb had been in darkness and the final hours hadn't been so visually dramatic. Cernan remembered that, on Apollo 10, he'd been impressed with how fast they seemed to be climbing away when they left lunar orbit for the trip home and, also, that he'd wondered what it would be like coming in that fast toward a surface he could see. Now he knew. Fortunately, there was plenty of work - and a great deal of pure professionalism - to protect him and the others from the full psychological impact of their seeming headlong rush.
0875104||LMP|Until I was going through my set of pictures, that I eventually gave to the University of New Mexico, and saw some pictures that Gene had taken, my memory was that we didn't see the Moon during the final approach. And I still don't have a personal recollection of looking at the illuminated edge of the Moon. Not a strong one, anyway. But I think that's because Gene was in the seat to do that. We were not in barbecue. We were in the attitude-hold mode. And he was in the position to see it and I wasn't. I may have glanced at it once. In fact, the more I talk about it, the more I think I remember him saying 'Come over and look at this'. But, for a long time, I didn't have any recollection of seeing any part of an illuminated Moon as we came in.
0875104||CDR|Jack and Ron, never having had the opportunity to see what I saw on Apollo 10, can't appreciate the approach to the Moon that we had. I don't think anybody in any of the missions had this approach. I think everybody, starting with Apollo 8, went into darkness in the shadow of the Moon, and got on their back and, at a predetermined time, fired the CSM engine - in darkness and upside down and going backwards - and then, all of a sudden - maybe five minutes, maybe ten minutes later - we'd come out of darkness at fifty miles or thereabouts above the surface and it's 'WOW! Look at those craters. There it is. Man.' It's just like instant sunlight and we're THERE! I mean, it's like we've been flying in the darkness to rendezvous with this thing we can't see (meaning the Moon) - and we know we're close because we're in the shadow - and all of a sudden, WHAM, someone turns the lights on. And then the next major thing is to come around and see the Earthrise. Now, on Apollo 17 - and nobody told me it was going to happen - we went through the darkness and came out into sunlight before we got to the Moon. And we were coming in on this damn target and we were seeing, to start with, just a sliver, just a slice of the Moon. And then we started to see more of it as we snuck around behind it. And it's getting big so fast you can't believe it. And I'm telling you, you talk about rolling over on your back and making a dive bombing run at some point some 50 or 60 miles above the surface! That was the most spectacular entry into lunar orbit. And I don't think anyone appreciates it! Except me! I don't think any of the other flights ever saw that. And I don't think Jack and Ron appreciated because I've got a feeling they thought it was supposed to be like that all the time.
0884338||summary|Now they were only 2660 miles out and had been accelerated by lunar gravity to 5000 feet per second. Cernan had the monocular out and, when the Moon was in view, got a good look into some of the larger craters on the illuminated edge. But then it was time to change the spacecraft orientation so that the big Service Module Engine would be pointed in the right direction when they swept down to their low point over the Farside. Half an hour before lunar gravity swept them around the west limb and out of radio contact with Earth, they had the linked CSM/LM re-oriented. Looking back past the LM, they could see the Earth. LOS (loss of signal) came at 88:43:21 and, eleven minutes later, the LOI (Lunar Orbit Insertion) burn to put them in a lunar orbit with a low point of 53 miles and a high point of 170 miles.
0894134||summary|On their first pass over the landing site, the area was in darkness and, because they had just gone through the dawn terminator a few moments before and still had the Sun shining in the spacecraft windows, Earthlight was of no help. By the time they came around again, the Sun would be up at Taurus-Littrow; but, first there was another burn to perform to put themselves in the proper orbit for the next day's descent. On this first pass over the Nearside and on the next as well, Houston took a careful look at the tracking data so that the burn parameters could be fine-tuned.
0895748||summary|While Houston was busy, the crew had an opportunity to admire the view and, throughout most of the Nearside pass, Schmitt gave a running commentary about the lunar surface below. Because they were near the high point of their initial orbit as they passed over the landing site, the Sun didn't go below their horizon for another ten minutes. But soon, thereafter, they began to pick out detail in the Earthshine. Because the Earth was virtually overhead throughout most of the Nearside pass, there weren't any Earthshine shadows to delineate the hills and holes until they had completed most of the Nearside pass. However, even without Earthshine shadows, they could see differences in albedo, differences in the degree to which the surface materials reflected the Earthshine. As an example, the bright rays emanating from the young crater Copernicus stood out quite well.
0912434||summary|By the time the crew re-emerged from behind the Moon again, Houston had the new data ready. Cernan configured the computer so that it could accept the uplinked data while Schmitt copied additional information that Fullerton read up. There was a great deal to be copied and Schmitt and Fullerton didn't finish until just before the second pass over the landing site. Down below, the shadows were very long. The North Massif was almost completely shadowed by the Sculptured Hills and there was little that was visible out on the valley floor. The only exception was the section of the Scarp near the crater Lara which, because it is highly reflective and was sloped toward the Sun, stood out quite prominently.
0924903||summary|For the rest of the orbit, the crew of Apollo 17 kept busy preparing for the burn that would put them in what was called the Descent Orbit. On the early missions, the CSM flew a 60-mile-high circular orbit and LM fuel was used to take the lander down, first, into a 15 by 60 mile orbit and then to the surface. However, beginning with Apollo 14 and in preparation for landing the heavy J-mission LMs, the mission profile was changed so that, prior to separation, CSM fuel was used to put both spacecraft in the 15 by 60 mile orbit. Consequently, at the end of their second orbit, when they were once again down to about 53 miles above the lunar surface, the crew of Apollo 17 fired the Service engine and changed the orbit from 53 by 170 to 59 by 15, with the low point now just east of the landing site.
1054728||summary|Landing day. If all went well and they got down on time and got the EVA started promptly, it was still going to be a 22 1/2 hour day from wake up to bedtime. Cernan and Schmitt had decided that there would be no point in a short landing day and a sleep period before going out. They were well-rested and fit. And there was no doubt that the Moon would hold their interest. The wake-up call for landing day was the John Denver version of the Steve Goodman song, The City of New Orleans, with its chorus of "Good morning, America, how are ya?" It is a happy song that had been suggested by people on the night shift in the press room - a song that matched the mood of the crew and, indeed, country-music-fan Schmitt requested a replay while he and the others finished waking up. Each of them had taken a Seconal; and Cernan and Schmitt, at least, had slept very soundly.
1060240||summary|LOS at the end of the ninth orbit came only ten minutes after wake-up and, by the time Apollo 17 had re-appeared forty five minutes later, the astronauts were getting the tunnel cleared and were getting into their suits. They'd had a very quick breakfast.
1075932||summary|Check out of the LM went quickly and smoothly; and, not long after AOS (Acquisition of Signal) on the eleventh orbit, Evans was in his suit and was busily sealing up the tunnel in preparation for undocking. As one of the last items, all three of them donned their helmets and gloves and performed pressure checks. They would perform the maneuvers unpressurized for the simple reason that their dexterity was limited in an inflated suit. However, they wanted to make sure that, in an emergency, the suits would inflate and stay inflated as long as necessary.
1095348||summary|As planned, the crew undocked the two spacecraft during the Farside pass at the beginning of the 12th orbit. For the next hour and a half, the two spacecraft flew close to one another so that the astronauts could make visual inspections and perform final checks of systems. Later in the orbit, just before LOS, Evans fired the Service Engine to boost himself back up into a 60-mile circular orbit so that, in the event of an aborted landing, he would be in an optimal position for a rendezvous. As seemed usual in Apollo, the crew had a little trouble getting contact with Earth through the LM's steerable, high-gain antenna but, otherwise, Challenger was ready for the landing.
1104734||summary|Cernan and Schmitt pressurized the propellant tanks and, a few minutes later, made their last pass over Taurus-Littrow prior to the descent. Evans had not yet made his circularization burn and was ahead and slightly below them. It was a spectacular, oblique view of the valley. They were less than fifteen miles away, and the LM crew took a couple of color pictures. Cernan was particularly interested in the small group of craters that surrounded his target point, and he called out the names as he found them.
1114804||summary|Evans did his circularization burn and, five minutes later, the LM crew did a more modest burn to move the low point of their orbit down to 10 1/2 miles over a point east of the landing site.
1123613||summary|At AOS on the 13th orbit, Evans reappeared first and confirmed that the LM burn had gone well. And then, once Houston had a bit more tracking data with which to update the LM computer, everything was ready for the landing.
1124922||CDR|When you go into something as dynamic as an engine burn, you get major fluctuations in the accelerometers and, to navigate effectively, you have to average the accelerations over a finite period of time.
1124931||CDR|At ignition, the tanks were about three quarters full of fuel and one quarter pressurized helium. The trouble was that, in zero gravity, you didn't know where the fuel was in the tank. Therefore, you had to apply a little acceleration and drive the heavy (that is, denser) fuel downward towards the outlet, towards the engine, so that, when you started the main engine you don't get a fistful of helium. Because we were flying with the landing gear and the main engine forward, to get proper ullage we had to fire the RCS jets briefly against that forward motion. We had the computer programmed to fire the thrusters for a few seconds prior to ignition; but, if Jack hadn't confirmed ullage, I would have used the handcontroller to give us manual ullage.
1124951||LMP|Having gotten ullage, we pushed the computer's Proceed button which told it to continue with engine ignition.
1125010||LMP|Probably, I was doing a quick check to make sure the tank pressures were okay. Evidently, the Quantity Light was giving a false warning.
1125023||CDR|Once you get into the computers, it's like riding a bicycle. Maybe you change to a different kind of bicycle, but it's still easy enough to learn. Long before we flew Apollo 17, I had gotten very comfortable with all of the computer systems. I had flown on @alsjurl/a410/images10.html#69H650"@alsjt>Apollo 10 as Lunar Module Pilot</a> and, on that mission, was responsible for a lot of things as far as computers were concerned, especially the @alsjurl/tnD7990LM_AGS.html"@alsjt>AGS</a>. Along with Tom Stafford, I also got to know the main computer to the point that I could sleep with it. After that flight I backed up Apollo 14. The morning of the Apollo 14 launch, I was ready to fly; and I knew those computers cold. And then came Apollo 17.
1125023||CDR|The entry pad for the (PGNS) computer was between the two of us, by my right hand, just above the hatch. However, because of some experiences I had on Apollo 10 and so forth, I told Jack that, with very few exceptions, we weren't both going to be punching buttons on that main computer. On Apollo 10, Tom Stafford and I had had some trouble with the sort of situation where you think the computer's got one command and someone gives it another. Because of that, I told Jack that I was going to enter the commands and he was going to monitor me to make sure I did the right ones. He was going to run the AGS computer (with the DEDA, see below); but we weren't going to both be punching buttons.
1125039||LMP|The two, separate guidance systems had been initialized to the same data at some point prior to ignition. The @alsjurl/tnD7990LM_AGS.html"@alsjt>AGS</a> had some strapped-down gyros and wasn't as accurate as the PGNS; but, if the primary system failed, the AGS was certainly accurate enough to get us back to orbit. Here, I am checking to see that the two systems are in satisfactory agreement. Sometime prior to the mission I had worked out a way to update the AGS's knowledge of altitude by inputting a value from the @alsjurl/alsj-LMRadars.html"@alsjt>radar</a> data as soon as that became available. We'll see that later. LMPs were always trying to get the AGS to the point that, if you had to, you could land with it.
1125039||CDR|We used to play around in the @alsjurl/tnD7112Simulators.html"@alsjt>simulator</a> to see if the AGS gave us enough information to land; and, quite honestly, if we were close I think we could have landed. There was a mission rule, as I remember, that we wouldn't land if we had a primary guidance failure. But one thing that people never paid much attention to is that, for most of the flight - and this is one very visible point - the ground has no control over what you're doing. They can send up information; but you're in command, you're flying the machine, and you're making the decisions. So who is to know what decision would have been made if you were down around three or four hundred feet or six hundred feet or a thousand feet and you had a question about your primary navigation system but your abort navigation system looked good. The AGS didn't have the @alsjurl/alsj-LMRadars.html"@alsjt>landing radar</a> tied into it, but it was giving you descent information and you could use those pieces separately. And who knows whether you would have landed or not. We didn't want to go that far and not land because of a computer problem.
1125127||CDR|The ground couldn't fly the spacecraft or do anything with it, but they could read a lot of the data out. While I keyed the new data into the computer and Jack verified it on-board, they could also read it and verify it on the ground. Normally, they'd look at it and verify it before we'd go ahead and actually execute whatever command or (enter) whatever data they'd given us.
1125131||CDR|We had an inertial attitude gyro, like in an airplane, which we called the "eight ball" or simply the "ball". It was essentially fixed in space and we would rotate the spacecraft around it. With the LM sitting on the lunar surface, the ball would have shown a pitch of zero degrees; and, while we were in the initial descent and lying on our backs with our feet forward, looking up at the sky and slowing down, it would show about 90 degrees or maybe even 108, depending on the trajectory. As we drifted in, we slowly pitched upright until, at 60 or 70 degrees pitch and 7000 feet altitude, we'd go through the big pitchover.
1125356||LMP|There was a tapemeter display for showing the radar data - altitude and altitude rate (H-dot) - when that became available. Physically, it was a pair of tapes with numbers on them which moved up and down behind a needle.
1125356||CDR|We had so many rate needles that it's a little hard to remember; but we could change them to show a lot of things like altitude and altitude rates. I think we could change this particular @alsjurl/alsj-Tapemeters.html"@alsjt>tapemeter</a> (which was next to the "@alsjurl/alsj-FDAI.html"@alsjt>8-ball</a>" attitude indicator on Gene's side of the spacecraft) showed either the radar data or the computer's best guess about the altitude and altitude rate.
1125426||LMP|This was the difference between the radar altitude and the PGNS calculated altitude
1125434||LMP|Verb 57 allowed the radar data to be incorporated into the computer.
1125442||CDR|We had gone into lunar orbit in the CSM on a path that went from northeast to southwest across the front face of the Moon. That track took the Command Module over the @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22465"@alsjt>landing site</a> but wasn't exactly the right path for the final approach. So we flew the LM a little south out of the CSM orbital plane so that we could line up with our runway, so to speak, down the axis of the valley.
1125504||CDR|We landed so far east and north that the Earth was in the southwestern sky above the mountains. Every other flight landed where the Earth was essentially overhead; so ours was unique in that, during our descent, we were looking right at the Earth as we were coming down in the valley. As those mountains rose above us, we were looking at the Earth - I mean - right smack in front of us! We didn't have to look up at it; it was right there. Can you imagine coming down, thirty-six thousand feet above the lunar surface and all of a sudden, almost nonchalantly, saying that you've got the Earth right out the front window? And all the other things going on at the same time?
1125545||CDR|Jack couldn't spend much time looking out the window. He went through the whole landing and hardly had a chance to see where we were going, because he was looking at fuel and oxidizer gauges, looking at battery currents, updating the @alsjurl/tnD7990LM_AGS.html"@alsjt>AGS</a> computer, verifying my entries in the PGNS, and writing things down. So he was very busy inside the cockpit and probably stole a glance or two outside. I had to look outside. Actually, I had to look both places - inside and outside - but my primary focus was out the window and on all of the attitude and rate indicators that surrounded the window. My peripheral scan was forward, out the window, and to the instruments that surrounded it, and occasionally down to the computer when I had to execute a command with it. But poor Jack had to keep his head buried in the cockpit.
1125616||CDR|The PGNS was keeping track of our altitude relative to the landing site while the radar, of course, was getting raw data from the terrain below us. Knowing ahead of time that we were going to cross the mountains east of the landing site, we were looking for the altitude difference to change, and it was a comfortable feeling to see it happen.
1125633||CDR|The pitch, roll, and yaw axes were different on the LM than they were on the Command Module; and we had re-defined them for pilot convenience. Pitch was rotation around the left/right axis; roll was rotation around the axis out the front window or the front hatch; and yaw was rotation around the thrust axis. When you were coming down in the final approach and were pitched straight up, if you looked out the window at a particular point and yawed left, that point would move right in your window.
1125758||LMP|There were at least two fuel gauges and, after watching their telemetry, the ground recommended which one we should use as a better indicator of fuel quantity.
1125803||CDR|We used a lot of numbers and commands that didn't mean anything to most people. But, when you'd done the training and were using the numbers in context, you didn't need to put dimensions with them. All you said was 'Hey; Fuel 2, 27.' And, at the time, that meant something to us. You knew the systems and you knew what that 27 was supposed to mean and that it wasn't supposed to be 92 or 22. And you knew whether it was supposed to be gallons or pounds or whatever. You just talked in an abbreviated language because you were almost in a world of your own during that time, talking to each other with things happening in rapid sequence. Not a lot of people knew what you were talking about, except for the two of you and the people on the ground.
1125845||CDR|We landed in a valley that had mountains higher than the Grand Canyon is deep. Prior to pitching over, down in the bottom of the windows, the first thing I could pick out was the top of the mountains. And as we pitched up some more, I could begin to identify things in our valley. I had to lean as far forward as I could to look up over the top (of the window sill), but I could see them. And it seemed like we were down below the tops of those mountains, down into the valley. It really did. Maybe we were still above the tops; but, as far as I was concerned, we were in that valley.
1125847||LMP|This was a number going into the @alsjurl/tnD7990LM_AGS.html"@alsjt>AGS</a> to give it a new altitude reference; and it was taken off the computer which now had the radar update. When the ground agreed that the data was good, then I put it into the AGS for abort purposes. This was something I worked out with the AGS people; I was always trying to find a way to make the AGS better, and this was one of the things.
1125916||LMP|By hitting the Proceed button, the computer would start the next program in its repertoire. There was a whole series of programs called P64 and the like, this one being the program for events after pitchover.
1125916||CDR|Pitchover was very critical. I needed to look out the window to make sure the LM didn't pitch over too far; so this was one of the few instances in which we had planned for Jack to enter a command into the computer so that I didn't have to look down. Learning how to work together during the landing sequence was a critical part of our training. You get procedures, you get checklists, but two guys still have to learn how to work together and coordinate their resources effectively. This is a good example of that, and one that was much more critical than the lunar surface work.
1125919||CDR|We still wanted to slow ourselves down by firing forward but now we also had to keep ourselves from falling in too fast toward the surface. I don't know how much we pitched over, maybe from about sixty degrees to about twenty or thirty degrees (actually from 60 degrees to 20); but, when we did, all of a sudden, bam, the lunar surface filled up almost the entire window.
1125924||CDR|Although there is nothing quite like the real thing, flying the Lunar Landing Training Vehicle (@alsjurl/LLTV-952.html"@alsjt>LLTV</a>) had been a step toward realism from "flying" the stationary @alsjurl/tnD7112Simulators.html"@alsjt>simulators</a>. In the LLTV you had your butt strapped to a machine that you had to land safely or you didn't make it. It still wasn't landing on the lunar surface, but it gave you a feel for what the actual landing would be like. Similarly, in simulator training we'd had a TV picture of a (large) model of the landing site that was good enough that, when we pitched over during the actual landing, I felt like I'd seen the landing site before. I won't say that I totally felt like I'd been there before, but I felt like I'd seen that valley before, three dimensionally. So it was a very comfortable feeling to know we were right where we expected to be.
1125926||CDR|In addition to all the fancy gear, all the rate needles and everything, when it came right down to landing, we had @alsjurl/lpdin.jpg"@alsjt>etchings</a> on the window in both pitch and yaw (part of the Landing Point Designator or @alsjurl/apollo.glossary.html#LPD"@alsjt>LPD</a>). And here, after pitchover, Jack is telling me where on the window the computer thinks we're going to land. The digital autopilot and the computer programs were designed to accept attitude impulses with my handcontroller. I could go "blip" once and that would tell the computer that I wanted to change the target maybe a half degree or a degree in pitch. In effect, I was saying, 'Computer, I am now smarter than you. You think you know where the target is, but I'm looking at it out the window. I know where it is, and I'm going to tell you.' It was the same sort of thing in yaw, but you have to remember that yaw didn't directly change the flight direction because yaw is a rotation around the thrust axis. If I rolled to the left, I was going to put the engine to the right and drive myself to the left. If I pitch up, I'm going to put the engine more forward and I'm going to slow myself down and start to come down faster. But I could have yawed through 360 degrees and never effected my trajectory. So if I blipped the handcontroller in yaw, what it really said to the computer was that I wanted to land a little left and that it had to do a little roll to get over there.
1125934||CDR|The fact that the target numbers are increasing doesn't necessarily mean that we were pitching up very much, only that we were getting closer to the target and, therefore, that it was getting higher in the window. I didn't respond to these because I was looking out the window and, if I needed to move, I just moved the handcontroller.
1125954||CDR|Poppie was my daughter @alsjurl/a17/a17.s72_51687.jpg"@alsjt>Tracy's</a> name for my father (Andrew 'Andy' Cernan). He never lived to see me land on the Moon and I named the crater for him. And Punk is what I used to call Tracy. I still do, even though she's twenty-six years old (January 1990).
1130028||CDR|The angles were useful from pitchover until we got down to a thousand or two thousand feet, and then you were flying by the seat of your pants to some degree. Besides, now I was looking at where we wanted to land, and was just putting it there. So I didn't need the degree numbers, just the altitude and descent rate.
1130032||LMP|A lot high!
1130032||CDR|I had it under control; I knew what the response was and how quickly we could slow down. It was comfortable and it saved fuel. In the Navy, we land aboard carriers at 15 feet per second and I knew what that was; and I'd flown the @alsjurl/tnD7112Simulators.html"@alsjt>LM Simulator</a> so many times that I knew what 15 feet per second at 100 feet was like and knew that I could slow it down to 5 feet per second awfully quickly.
1130051||CDR|The tendency for most people flying the LM was to get a false impression of thinking that you were coming down straight. But, because of where the window was located, you would actually be drifting backwards. So I forced myself to land with about a foot or a foot-and-a-half forward velocity. And then, if I fell into the trap of feeling that I was going forward when I was really going vertical, it would be okay.
1130054|Technical Debrief|CDR|We started to get dust somewhere around 100 feet.
1130054|Technical Debrief|LMP|In my window, I didn't see dust until about 60 or 70 feet.
1130054|Technical Debrief|CDR|The dust layer was so very thin that I could definitely see through it all the way down. It didn't hamper our operations at all.
1130217||LMP|Parker valves (also known as the isolation valves or shut-off valves) controlled the RCS thrusters - the fuel and oxidizer - and there was always some concern that they might close at landing, just because of the little bit of shock. So the procedure was to go through and cycle (close and open) every one of them. There were, I don't know, sixteen of them on the wall in front of me and, while Gene was getting all excited, I was cycling switches.
1130230||CDR|In thinking about why we worked so well together, the most important point was that we had confidence in each other. Jack is a very astute and dedicated individual, very talented, and I felt very comfortable with him. He was not an aviator and he'll be the first to tell you that. But he took his responsibilities very seriously, learned quickly, and, in terms of technical understanding, was as good as anybody. He wasn't a passenger; he had learned how to be a good co-pilot. In much the same way, I wasn't a geologist, I wasn't a scientist; but I had learned to be a good observer. As soon as we hit the lunar surface, although I was still commander of the crew, Jack was the expert and I was his assistant. We had very different backgrounds. I was the professional aviator and Jack was the scientist; but we both knew enough about all aspects of the missions that we could be confident about working together.
1130230||CDR|For the landing and lift-off phases, we were both dedicated to knowing all the intricacies of the spacecraft, all the details of the hardware and the software. Our responsibilities were different; but the fact that I knew all the systems on his side and he knew all the systems on my side was important. I'm the kind of guy who, although I knew I could depend on Jack, wanted to understand everything about the spacecraft. I was fortunate because I'd sat in the right (LMP) seat on Apollo 10, so I knew the @alsjurl/tnD7990LM_AGS.html"@alsjt>AGS</a> (Abort Guidance System). I knew what it could do and, when Jack would talk to me about the AGS or how we were going to use it, I understood because I had been there. And Jack took it upon himself to be very familiar with the operation of the primary guidance computer (PGNS) and the other systems on my side of the spacecraft. But I know there were crews - and I won't name them - where one or the other of the guys was extremely weak in one or more of the systems. Crews where, if the guy in the right seat told the guy in the left seat something was right or wrong, the guy in the left seat just accepted it because he didn't know any different. And he didn't know enough to ask any questions. If the guy in the left seat is just going to depend on someone to throw him a number and not know what the number means or where it came from, and can't challenge it, can't know whether it's right or wrong, then he's not doing his job. With me, if it was ten degrees off, I would know it. And I'd say 'Jack, check your AGS; that's not right.' But if the guy in the left seat had no idea what the AGS was supposed to do, he might just blankly accept that number and go about his business and might or might not get in trouble as a result of it. Even a computer isn't right all the time, and certainly people are prone to mistakes; but if two guys both know a system you're least likely to make a mistake. Mutual respect and teamwork evolves from that.
1130230||CDR|Landing on the Moon was a unique opportunity for us both; we didn't want to let it slip through our hands. We spent the time that it took: not just a few extra hours in the simulator, but all the time it took to really understand our spacecraft. Jack spent a lot of time with the people on the ground - more than I did. He got to know them and understand them. He'd go to them with questions like, 'How can you guys help me get my AGS smarter than it normally would be.' And, because he'd spent time working with them, they said 'Hey, we can work something. We'll put it into the checklist that we'll send you an update here and you do that there.' And those kind of things paid off in the form of a level of coordination and teamwork between us and the people on the ground that was as good as on any mission.
1130230||CDR|By the same token, I had a lot of personal pride that, if we had lost three quarters of our automatic systems, I still could have landed the vehicle safely. Same thing for leaving the lunar surface. True, you have to believe that you can do it; you would have no other choice. But I knew that if we lost all of our guidance computers, I could have flown that LM into lunar orbit for a rendezvous with Ron Evans. Manually. And by 'manually', I mean (visually guiding) with the stars (and) with the horizon of the Moon. I'd done it enough in the simulators that I knew what my remaining systems were going to tell me; and I had confidence that Jack was going to give me whatever information I need from him. You never know (if you're right about something like that), but I'm confident that we could have done it. And I felt the same way about the Saturn V launch from Earth. Ours was the first nighttime launch, and there were a lot of things we had to consider in terms of guidance control failures. The launches - both from the Earth and from the Moon - were the only truly automatic phases of the mission, but we could take over and fly it manually to orbit. Aborting during Earth launch was the last thing I wanted to do, so I trained and planned. It was a lot more difficult at night than in the daytime because you didn't have horizons and things to look at; you had to look at the stars. We had several modes of failure that could have degraded systems. The worst would have been for all the guidance to fail so that you literally had to fly it by the stars. Now, I can never prove that I could have done it. But I did it a lot of times in simulators and really did - and still do - believe that I could have flown that Saturn V to orbit. It's one of those things where you say 'I hope it never happens; but I dare you. I'll show you. If you do fail, you just watch.' You had to have that attitude; and I think that attitude is reflected across the cockpit. You develop confidence in each other, and, from that, the teamwork evolves.
1130302||CDR|When you land on a carrier, you've got a mirror and you've got an orange light that reflects in the mirror. On the carrier you've got a row of green lights that also reflect in that mirror and if the meatball - the orange light - is below the green lights, then you are low, below the glide slope; and if the meatball's above the green lights, you are high. So what you do is fly your carrier approach so that the meatball is right in line with the green lights. So I was telling Ron that I had it 'locked' all the way in.
1130414||CDR|From about a thousand feet down, the planned landing site looked good. So I was just concerned about spacecraft attitude and spacecraft motion during the final approach. I was not concerned about the terrain we were landing on. It was real nice to be down with lots of propellant left but, while it would have been fun to fly around the valley a little and then land, the important thing was to get the spacecraft down safely. It would have been like flying through a thunderstorm and making a safe landing, and having somebody say, 'Hey, we could have gotten more instrument time in that thunderstorm. And you say 'No, thank you.'
1130546||CDR|The ground wasn't about to commit to a three-day stay when we'd only been there ten minutes. They wanted a chance to look at all the spacecraft systems. This initial post-landing phase was the critical one. Did you bust a tank? Was there any helium or fuel leaking? How was the battery power holding up? During these first few minutes, we were ready to launch immediately. They were taking a quick look and, if things looked okay, they would then let us go ahead and reconfigure the computers and the navigation system for a non-emergency lift-off. Then, after a half hour or so, if everything still looked okay, they would let us power down completely.
1130743||LMP|Here we were giving the computer information it would need for T-2. Just prior to descent, Houston had used their best information on the CSM orbit and had read us these times to copy onto a pad for use if we needed them. If we had to get off and get up into orbit at some time other than one of these pre-programmed times, we could have launched into a low orbit so that we would have gradually caught up with him.
1130918||LMP|Hanover was simply too far away for us to have reached; and it had generally been decided that we weren't going to learn much about the Scarp in that area because of the North Massif debris that would have flowed onto it. What we really wanted was a place that would let us collect materials that would be different from what we had landed on, and that's why we went to Nansen.
1130947||CDR|Although Jack's view was basically from a little south of west up to the north and mine was from a little north of west down to the south, I could get to the left corner of my window and look out at least to the northwest and he could do the same to the southwest. And, although it was hard to do until we unstrapped, we could look out each other's windows, too.
1131123||LMP|We had done one of our field tests near Sunset Crater, partly because it was volcanic terrain.
1131123||CDR|We didn't use a Rover at Sunset, but we had something that allowed us to be mobile. We did a 'typical' lunar traverse that sort of simulated, out in the field, the kind of traverse we would run through on the Moon. It was all pre-planned, of course; so we had an EVA-1, 2, and 3 where we were to do different things. At stop 1 on EVA-1 we were going to do this, take a sample of the soil, and then do that. Now, that doesn't mean that we were doing an exact replica of our traverse on the Moon. We did some @alsjurl/a17/ap17-S72-48889.jpg"@alsjt>simulated traverses at the Cape</a>, driving around in our suits to three or four little stations doing the @alsjurl/a17/ap17-KSC-72P-440.jpg"@alsjt>mechanics of the stops</a>, but not doing anything that could be called geology. Flagstaff put us in a far more realistic geologic environment; we could take samples and, even though the samples would be grossly different than we might find on the Moon, we'd run into things we hadn't expected to see and find extra tasks that needed to be done. The stations always took longer than what we'd planned and, in that respect, it was very good training.
1131155||CDR|During the landing, there were a lot of things going on, but we knew right away that the quantity light was not something which was particularly urgent. We knew how much fuel we started with, we knew how much we'd been burning, and we knew the ground hadn't seen any changes. Theoretically, by the numbers, we probably should have aborted. But you don't just do things; you don't overreact. It's a good example of what I meant when I was talking about Jack and I working well as a team, about understanding more than the superficial information, about understanding each other, and about understanding where the information was coming from. When Jack gave me numbers, I knew he was not just reading numbers. I knew that he knew where the numbers came from. And the same thing applies to the quantity indicator. I won't say that we ignored it, but there just wasn't anything else at that time to tell us it was important. We both noticed it, I called the ground's attention to it, and that was all.
1131302||CDR|-"We could put the @alsjurl/water_gun.jpg"@alsjt>water gun</a> (photo by Mick Hyde) through a little self-sealing hole in our helmets. It was like a little hatch at the cheek. You had to turn your head to get a drink; and I think Jack probably just took the water gun off the hook (behind him) and gave himself and then me a little squirt of water. This was the first chance we'd had to have anything to drink at all in the whole thing.
1131324||LMP|What we were about to do here was depressurize the descent stage tanks by venting the helium. You didn't want to actually empty the tanks and vent hydrazine and nitrous oxide onto the surface and contaminate the area. And you also didn't want the tanks to heat up and pressurize and possibly rupture during the three-day stay. So you depressurized them.
1131346||LMP|The key for the microphone was a big blue knob on a cable at your side, so that if you leaned forward you might hit it and unintentionally let the ground listen in.
1131452||LMP|The vents were opened with a little pyrotechnic device called the Apollo Standard Initiator.
1131704||LMP|When you go to Repress, Auto, you get a little bit of gas flow across the valve; maybe we saw something that it ejected. Or maybe I was just wondering where the gas was going.
1131958||LMP|We couldn't see the stars out the window or when we were out on the surface. It took the collimation of the telescope to eliminate all of the reflected light reaching your eye from your surroundings. Even in the LM shadow, there were too many bright things in your field-of-view for the stars to be visible.
1131958||CDR|When you were in the lunar module, looking out the window, you certainly couldn't see stars. Using the telescope was sort of like being in a deep well; it cut out all the reflected light and let you see the stars. It was also generally true that, when you were on the surface in the LM's shadow, there were too many bright things in your field-of-view for the stars to be visible. But I remember that I wanted to see whether I could see stars, and there were times out on the surface when I found that, if you allowed yourself to just focus and maybe even just shielded your eyes to some degree, even outside the LM shadow you could see stars in the sky. And, quite frankly, under the right conditions here on Earth on a bright sunlit day, you can do the same thing. I could see stars through my helmet visor; not easily, but it can be done.
1132036||LMP|We had the antenna in a ready condition during the descent and landing and, here, we may be parking it in a configuration to minimize heating on critical elements.
1132436||LMP|The L&amp;A (Landing and Ascent) was a model constructed by the Army Topographic Command for use in the @alsjurl/tnD7112Simulators.html"@alsjt>simulator</a>. It was made from data they extracted from Apollo 15 stereo photography. It was a fairly detailed model, mounted upside down on a ceiling. A TV camera "flew" to it as we "flew" the LM simulator and the picture was merged into our visual displays in our windows in the simulator. It was pretty good size; it covered the whole valley - past the Scarp, I know - and part way up the sides of the massifs.
1132436||CDR|The L&amp;A simulations of the landing sites always tended to come fairly late in training, but I don't recall us having a great problem with it being extremely late. It may not have seemed adequate at the time, but it certainly was adequate.
1132705||CDR|Because we were landing early in the morning at a site so far east, we landed at a very early phase of the Moon and almost the entire Earth was sunlit. We took the picture of the fullest Earth that any crew saw because we left Earth almost at the New Moon. As we stayed there, the fraction of the Earth that was sunlit got less and less and it got to be a three-quarters Earth and then a Half Earth by the time we left lunar orbit to come home. On the surface, when we went to bed at night, we could see the American flag out Jack's window and (out Gene's window) we could see the Earth sitting right on top of the South Massif. Because of where we landed, the Earth was fairly low in the sky and was always part of the scene. Looking at the Earth was something you could do casually, and you would do many times without even realizing it. That was the neat part about it being so low in the sky.
1132705||LMP|Actually, what he could see was mostly the southern hemisphere because, when we landed, the Moon was below the plane of the Earth's equator. During the final phases of the landing, I had the center section of the LM blocking me. All I could look at was the North Massif. I took one look, but Gene had me so drilled on giving him those numbers I missed the whole landing.
1132705||CDR|I'm proud of that. That's professionalism. I don't think we have to take a back seat to anybody for any (aspect) of the mission.
1132739||CDR|You could align the inertial platform either with the stars or with gravity. Here, we were gravity aligning. I think Noun 22 showed you the new alignment angles (in yaw, pitch and roll, in tenths of a degree), and it gave you a chance to look at it and say 'Yes, I want it; I'll accept it,' or 'No, I'll keep my old alignment.' The fact that we were still aligning the platform means that we were still in a mode to leave the lunar surface on a contingent basis. We'd taken our helmets and gloves off, but still hadn't really powered down for a long lunar stay. In the worst case we could have lifted off without helmets and gloves; if you had to go, you went, as long as you had certain minimum things powered up in the lunar module. Now, eventually, we powered it all down - the computers, the platform - and, then we were really in a state of saying, 'We're comfortable here.'
1133012||CDR|This was a non-voice recorder for LM engineering data. A lot of times, when you were out of line-of-sight communications, or you had to drop off a communication signal, the tape recorder would continue to record all the engineering data about all the systems that would normally have been transmitted back to Earth as telemetry. That way the ground eventually had a totally uninterrupted scan of information of how the systems had been operating. But, when we were on the lunar surface, they didn't need the tape recorder because we had good, real-time communications all the time.
1134025||LMP|P57 was the star-sighting program and, in the telescope, you had a cross-hair which was the cursor and also an unwinding spiral overlaying it. And I guess that, at any particularly time, every star had a known set of inertial coordinates related to that cursor and spiral. As I remember, you loaded the coordinates of the star you were going to sight in the computer so that it could drive the telescope to the expected position; and, then, once you were sure that you had the right star, you zeroed-out the pointing and allowed the computer to take the refined information into account.
1134223||CDR|There was a program in the computer that literally could align the inertial platform to a local vertical defined by lunar gravity; or, of course, we could align it on the stars. But, generally, we would always tend to check the gravity alignment with stars, and then utilized both to align the platform.
1135048||CDR|We aligned the LM inertial platform in orbit before we landed. Theoretically, it should have maintained its alignment, but a lot of things happened during landing which could have changed it. We fired engines; and all the little perturbations could have driven the alignment off just a little bit. So when I said, 'O.K., Gordy, it's a little better' I was referring to the angular difference between where the computer thought the inertial platform was aligned and where we now knew it was aligned based upon our gravity measurements and star sightings. There might have been only a few hundredths of a degree difference or something like that, and that looked a lot more realistic than it had when I got the cursor and spiral mixed up.
1135332||CDR|You hit the stop button when you're ten feet above the lunar surface, the length of the probes sticking down from each of the struts. You're coming down at two or three feet per second, and you've got noise, and the engine is effectively holding you up. True, you're in one-sixth gravity and you don't tend to fall very fast. But all of a sudden, one of the probes touches, you get the contact light, you shut that thing down and boom, your stomach goes up in your throat for a split-split second. You've shut down all your thrust - and it shuts down immediately - and you go 'burrup'. It was quite a change in acceleration. You wouldn't get that if you could fly all the way down to the surface smoothly and then shut down; but we weren't afforded that luxury for the Apollo landings because we wanted to shut the engine down before we actually touched down. There was always the potential problem of the descent engine digging into the soft sand if you landed at an angle or there was a mound below you. If you dug in the engine and it was running - with all the fire and brimstone coming out of it - it could have exploded on you because of back pressure. So you wanted to shut it down just a couple of feet into the air. You knew the drop was coming, but there was still a definite, abrupt physical sensation.
1135344||CDR|As for the forward velocity, which we talked about earlier, my plan was to have about a foot per second forward. Now, I suppose, accurately, I could have been looking at the gauges at that time, it would have told me; but, probably, from 60 or so feet on down I hadn't planned to look at the gauges because, once you get right down to that point, you use your eyeballs and you take what you get. If you're set up properly, you'll end up right. If you're not set up properly, you're going to end up improperly.
1135344||CDR|There was a reason why I used the 'think' emphasis, 'I think I saw the contact light, and I think I waited about a second and hit the stop button.' You're not a robot, but you are so familiar with what needs to happen, with what needs to be done, that you go ahead and do them on a reaction basis at the right times. You don't have to analyze them and think through each one of them. So when I reflected upon this, I said, 'I think I waited about a second and hit the stop button.' It might have been a half second, who knows what it might have been. As another example, on lift off from the lunar surface, the computer gives the ignition signal to the engine. However, whether it gets it or not, there's a backup because the command pilot hits manual ignition. Just as a backup. And one of the flight controllers told me I was like a tenth of a millisecond behind the computer. I was so close that they almost couldn't tell. They told me, 'We're not sure whether the computer hit it at T-Zero, or whether you hit it at T-Zero, because one was right on top of the other.' So you react to doing some of these things. After we lifted off, we don't want to overburn either; and if the computer didn't shut the thing off right when it should, you had to be right there when you wanted it shut off. Boom; you shut it off. Those were reactions you took almost involuntarily because you'd trained to do that. They weren't robotic responses because you thought through them before they happened; but then, when they happened, they made logical sense and, as soon as you got the contact lights, you started throwing switches.
1135823||CDR|As I remember, we put Noun 20 in the computer, the computer did something with it, and then gave back a Noun 22. Then, if everybody was happy with the Noun 22, we'd go ahead, enter the Noun 20 into the working part of the computer, and power down the Abort Guidance System.
1144111||CDR|'Cutting into a little lunch' was a literal statement; we had to use @alsjurl/a17/AS17-162-24096lr.jpg"@alsjt>scissors</a> to cut open the plastic food bags.
1144111||CDR|This was typical of the problems you had judging size and distance on the lunar surface. Everything looked almost an order of magnitude (factor of ten) smaller than it really was. Certainly two to three times smaller and a lot closer than it really was. You had no telephone poles, no roads, no houses, no buildings to really judge distance by. Everything you looked at, you'd almost say, 'Well, it's just out there a few hundred feet', but it was probably a mile away. A boulder that looked like it was four or five feet tall might be a mile away and be 30 feet tall. You learned very quickly that you had no good way to judge of distance or size. Of course, after enough times of underestimating things you sort of recalibrated your system. You said, 'I know it looks like so and so, but it's probably so and so.' And even when we drove places, it didn't look like it was that far, but we kept driving, and driving, and driving before we got there. So, I'm not surprised that I was off by a factor of three here.
1144111||LMP|I knew how long the LM shadow was at the time of touchdown, and I just adjusted my estimates accordingly. Nothing ever looked as long as it was. I think my own judgments would have been off by a third, maybe, if I hadn't applied the known shadow length. Everything looked smaller. Just as distances look shorter in clear air of the Western U.S. than they do in the East, the lack of haze and references on the Moon made estimates difficult.
1144111||CDR|It absolutely amazes me that you can travel a quarter of a million miles and still worry about whether you're a hundred or two hundred feet short or long, or left or right of where you should have landed.
1145710||LMP|I think that the mottling is due to an irregular, brown-glass patina that covers the rock surface. Each time a micrometeorite hits a rock, it splashes melt-glass onto the surrounding rock surface, building up the patina. However, each of the impacts also cleans off a small patch of the patina right at the impact point; and I suspect that that is what this mottled appearance is.
1145734||LMP|This was probably a secondary crater, one made by a piece of ejecta from another impact. Clues that a crater is a secondary rather than a primary are an irregular crater shape and/or the presence of the boulder that made the crater. In this case, the glass on the boulder suggested that it had been thrown out of a high speed impact before it landed where we found it.
1150015||LMP|In the pre-mission photographs, the area looked like it was covered with dark material. There also seemed to be fewer craters, most of them relatively subdued. So we were anticipating that there might be a mantling of dark, pyroclastic material. It turned out that there had been such deposits in the area, but that they were 3.5 billion years old and were mostly long-since buried. Some of the buried dark material had been mixed to the surface by impacting; and, so, the dark color is a marker for pyroclastic deposits, just not recent ones.
1150035||LMP|I think that the prevalence of buried boulders and the lack of any clearly sitting on the surface is part of a normal process. When it landed, a boulder would normally dig at least a little crater for itself; and as the fillet formed and the crater filled in, the boulder wouldn't look like it was sitting on the surface. Boulders actually sitting on the surface would have been rare.
1150048||LMP|Normally I would have talked in meters but, for some reason, I knew the length of the LM shadow in feet. It was 110 feet long, I remember; and, apparently, the crater was down-Sun and next to the shadow.
1150100||LMP|This was a bad interpretation on my part. These fragments were mostly regolith breccia (impact-compacted soil) like what we saw on EVA-3 at Van Serg Crater.
1150256||LMP|The saturation size should tell you something about the age of a surface. But you have to assume things like a time-invariant size distribution and that nothing has been spread over the local surface to reset the clock. There are just too many variables to use the concept of saturation size at this scale. It's one thing to use it at an orbital scale (for craters of kilometer size and up); it's another thing to use it down here 'among the trees'.
1150903||CDR|Obviously, Jack could draw a lot upon his geology background to be able to recognize and describe some of these features on the Moon. It was a tremendous advantage. But I also think that my training was certainly more than adequate for what I had to do. It was comprehensive and I spent a lot of time at it. In fact, I got some general @alsjurl/ap-geotrips.html"@alsjt>geology training</a> even before Apollo 10 and then specifically got involved for Apollo 14 and then again with Apollo 17. We spent a lot of time studying various aspects of geology, mostly by going out in the field but also - at least a little - by looking at photographs and samples from prior missions. I think Jack probably did more of that than anybody, primarily because of his interest but also because he was staying in the geology side of the business, analyzing the material coming back from each of the missions. I think it was recognized that we didn't have much time to be much else besides observers. If we had enough background and training to recognize that something was different and unusual, then we could photograph it and bring a sample back. That's about all you had time to do on the Moon anyway, no matter whether you were a fully trained geologist or not. Even if we had had more time for geology training, at some point you have to ask at what time do you stop becoming that much more qualified as a lunar geology observer.
1150903||CDR|One of the important parts of the training was getting exposed to a lot of different things here on Earth so that, when you saw something on the Moon, you could say, 'Hey, this is similar to Sunset Crater at Flagstaff'; or 'This is similar to that impact crater I saw west of El Paso'; or 'This is similar in structure to the craters at the Nevada Test Site' or whatever. To me, the best way to be an observer is to have enough experience that you can describe whatever you're looking (at) in terms of something that people on the ground are familiar with. Of course, you can bring the pictures and samples back; but in real time, you can say, 'Hey, I'm standing in a crater and it looks just like Sunset Crater, or just like those craters we saw in Canada, or this rock is just like the pahoehoe we saw in Hawaii.' Then someone back on Earth who's seen the same things will know exactly what you're talking about. But, if you don't go to those places in training, if you don't have that exposure, it's hard to relate what a stream of pahoehoe looks like. If you can say, 'Gee, this is black just like that black car you're driving,' then they know what color black it is. But if you say, 'Well, it's sort of a grayish silver black,' it could be anything.
1150903||CDR|Geology was part of my job in this period of time in my life, but I'm sure that Jack will have a far deeper recollection of the lunar geology. That's his business; that's his profession. I've had a lot to say about the descent, because that's my profession. And I can sit all day and talk about what it felt like to be on the Moon, what it looked like, what it meant; but I probably won't recall a lot of the details of our lunar geologic traverses. Maybe I'll surprise myself. I don't know. As I've read some of what I said about what things looked like out the window, I do recall some of it, and it does mean something to me. And I think that means I was pretty well trained to be a geologic observer. I think that was true in the case of most everybody who went; but I had the advantage of having a professional geologist with me.
1150906||LMP|Ledge formers are just outcrops that line up in an apparent ledge.
1151406||CDR|We had a nine-man crew. We had the Prime Crew (Cernan, Evans, Schmitt), the Backup Crew (Young, Roosa, and Duke), and then the three-man Support Crew (Overmyer, Parker, and Fullerton). And there was also a group of supporting engineers. Traditionally, the Support Crew became the principle CapComs because they usually knew more about what was going on during the flight than anybody. Maybe that changed here and there, but for the most part, we had Gordo (Fullerton), (Bob) Parker, Bob Overmyer, and also Joe Allen, who was one of our support scientists. They knew us; they knew how we talked; and they knew our mission. They worked with us in the simulations a good part of the time; and they worked with us virtually all the time once we started the full-scale mission simulations.
1152122||CDR|The high gain (antenna) had a pitch axis and yaw axis. I don't think it had a roll axis. I don't think they were particularly related to the inertial axes of the spacecraft.
1153115||LMP|Each of us had a pair of scissors which normally traveled with us, but Ron lost his on the trip out from Earth. We had a lot of fun kidding him on the way out and all the way back about losing his scissors in a spacecraft which was, after all, not very big. But the complication was that the whole timeline on the surface was geared to having two pairs of scissors. With two pairs, Gene and I could leave one pair in the cabin and take the other pair outside - probably as a contingency tool - and not have to worry about taking it up and down (the ladder). However, because you needed the scissors to cut the plastic food bags, we finally condescended to leave one pair with Ron so that he could eat. And ultimately his scissors were found. I found them as we were preparing stowage for re-entry; but was able to signal to Gene that I'd found them without Ron knowing it. We continued to give him a pretty hard time and said that, in fact, we didn't think he'd lost them at all but he was trying to get away with these scissors as a memento of the flight and that ultimately the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) would be very interested in his activity. They were fancy, surgical scissors. At the splashdown party we had at the Flight Control Division - probably a month after the mission - we presented the scissors to Ron with great fanfare. We'd had to do an awful lot of preparation because, in order for the inventory of the spacecraft not to be confused, I had to let the crew assistance people in on the secret. I think what I did was put his scissors in my Personal Kit - my little bag of personal items. So there were two pairs of scissors in there. And that kit was supposed to come to us personally. That's probably what I did. I've forgotten exactly how we did the transfer without screwing up the inventory. It would have been a little hard to secretly carry the scissors up into the helicopter with us, because then, in the helicopter we changed out of our constant-wear garments into flight suits for our arrival on the carrier. So, I guess what I must have done is put the scissors in my flight bag.
1154412||CDR|The purge valve is nothing but a regulator, with two settings, in an open-loop system. You start with a supply (of oxygen) at one end and you regulate it out at the other end. It's just like a pressurized cabin in an airplane. In the case of an airplane, you pressurize the air from the engines, it goes into the cabin, and the pressure is controlled by an outflow regulator - which you could call a purge valve. It will stay closed if you need to get the pressure up, or it will open to dump as much incoming air as it has to keep the pressure to a certain level.
1154412||CDR|At some point there had been a suggestion that we would have to stay close enough to the LM that we could get back in the case of a double failure of both the Rover and a suit. I didn't like that and, obviously, we (the Astronaut Corps) ended up winning the argument. There were lots of things you could do to share oxygen. Suppose that Jack's PLSS failed and he had to go on his OPS. The first thing I'm going to do is take my OPS off my suit and put it in his lap. Then I wouldn't have an emergency supply but he'd have two. I don't think that was ever written down anywhere, but if that had happened, he'd have had an hour of OPS oxygen and we would have been headed for home (the LM). That's the kind of thinking that went on. Now, particularly in the early Gemini days, we did stretch things and did some things that we would never do today. Do you think that we would go out today, in the Shuttle, in an EVA suit with a backpack with hot gas and you were so scared that the hot gas was going to burn a hole through your suit that you made the pants out of woven steel? But we did that in Gemini. Before we had more than twenty minutes of EVA experience, we were going to send somebody out - namely, yours truly - with a hot-gas backpack. With fire coming out. We were burning hydrogen peroxide. We were going to put fire down our suits.
1161148||CDR|Getting the PLSSs on was very difficult. It was a two-man operation. The PLSSs were strapped to the side walls, at working height, and you had to back up against yours and the other guy would then unhook it from the wall and help you get it strapped to your back. The LM was so small that it was a very difficult operation, even in soft (unpressurized) suits.
1163133||CDR|There were two volume controls on the @alsjurl/alsj-RCU.html"@alsjt>RCU</a> and we obviously had Jack's switches set so that the wheel-like control controlled the volume on his comm circuit to Houston and the blade-like control controlled his circuit with me.
1163238||CDR|The 'fan' was a circulatory pump that moved oxygen through the suit hoses. What is happening here is that we are disconnecting ourselves from the spacecraft ECS (Environmental Control System). We've turned off the suit fans by pulling a circuit breaker because, without oxygen flowing in from the spacecraft, the fan wouldn't be pumping anything and might cavitate and burn out; plus, the fan would also use battery power and we wanted to conserve that. We had two indications that the fan was off. One was the simple fact that we could hear it, and the other was the Master Alarm which, of course, we expected. With us disconnected from the spacecraft, the sensing system thought that the fan had just failed and gave us the expected warning.
1163500||CDR|Here, we were pre-cooling ourselves with spacecraft water before we disconnected. We didn't turn the sublimator on until we got the cabin depressurized and the hatch opened. The sublimator wouldn't work if it wasn't in a vacuum.
1163710||CDR|We were getting ready to put the helmets on and pressurize the suits; and that was never a favorite part inside the Lunar Module because it was so hard to move around. With two guys in pressurized suits and both wearing PLSSs, it was almost impossible to move.
1163954||LMP|The helmet itself was a clear plastic bubble with a padded head rest inside at the back. The Lunar Extravehicular Visor Assembly (@alsjurl/alsj-LEVA.html"@alsjt>LEVA</a>) was everything else that sat on top on the helmet. It contained the sun visors and also passive thermal protection.
1164015||CDR|We were going to be locked in the suit for maybe nine hours and we had a little @alsjurl/alsj-DrinkFood.html"@alsjt>water bag</a> that we suspended from the inside rim of the suit. The bag hung on your chest and had a little one-way valve on the top of it so that you could turn your head and take a drink. It was like sucking on a nipple. And then we also had one of these high protein or high calorie sticks shaped like a ruler. It was a soft stick and you could chew it. We had it inside a little bag, and it was probably about eight inches long. It, too, was Velcroed just inside the helmet ring and we could put our chin down and pull a little bit out with our teeth, take a bite, chew it for some energy. It was typical candy-tasting stuff. It was nice to be able to suck up a few ounces of water now and then and have something to chew on. That was it; I mean, we had no way of eating or drinking anything other than that. But having some water and a little candy was a real help; it really was. I remember that both the 15 and 16 crews had trouble with their drink systems. We didn't have any problems that I can remember; and I remember that, in training, it had to do a lot of times with the way you placed the bag. I don't think there were any great design changes; although, maybe, the one-way valve was worked over.
1164632||CDR|I think that, in order to make things easier and save time, all of the circuit breakers that had to be opened for an EVA were indicated with a white dot (on checklist pages @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf1-4.jpg"@alsjt>1-4</a> and @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf1-5.jpg"@alsjt>1-5</a>). That way we could just go down the panel and shut off all of the things that we didn't want running while we were out on the surface. And all the switches that had to be changed had decals on them to show the proper EVA positions. It not only saved time, but it also cut down on mistakes; it was a lot riskier to read down a list of breakers that had to be pulled and switches that had to be thrown than to just take care of all the ones with white dots or decals. You'd done all the thinking ahead of time and, when it really counted, you almost didn't have to do any thinking.
1164908||CDR|I'd gotten one of my gloves on at this point, so this was my last chance to help Jack with an ungloved hand.
1165230||CDR|During my Gemini flight we had tried to use the flow of oxygen through the suit for cooling but decided that that wasn't adequate. So we developed the liquid-cooled garment. The way it worked was that the PLSS had two separate supplies of water. One was a closed-loop supply which was moved by a pump through the liquid-cooled garment. Then you had a sublimator which had another, physically-separate, open-loop supply of water. There was a cooling coil in the sublimator where the water in the closed loop could transfer heat to the open-loop supply and a diverter valve that determined how much of the suit water went through the coil. Because the open-loop supply was allowed to sublimate into the vacuum, it cooled the coils and the closed-loop supply. You could divert around that sublimator if the suit was too cold or you could divert through it and get more cooling. Here, as we've already discussed, we had the sublimator turned off and were running cold LM water through the LCG, cooling down before we disconnected the LM water. We didn't turn the sublimators on until we got the hatch open.
1165503||CDR|We were telling the spacecraft ECS system that we were going into an Egress mode and are about to depressurize the cabin on purpose.
1170037||CDR|The valve, as I recall, was just a little circular disk that was held against a seal by the pressure in the cabin. It had a little lever and I could get enough mechanical advantage to crack it a little bit and vent some of the air. I want to remember that we had some screw-type vents on the hatch of the Command Module; but I'm sure that this LM valve wasn't like that. Nothing in the LM was very fancy unless it absolutely had to be. Everything had to be as lightweight as possible, and that usually meant very unsophisticated designs.
1170203||CDR|We wanted to leave the @alsjurl/DumpValve.html"@alsjt>dump valve</a>s open because we were going to close the hatch for thermal reasons while we were outside. By leaving the dump valves open, we were making sure that, if any air bled into the cabin for any reason, then pressure couldn't build up inside the LM and make it tough to get that hatch open. Now, I also think that we did have an ability to open the dump valve (in the forward hatch) from the outside. I really believe we did, as I remember. But it was obviously still safer to leave the dump valves open.
1170350||CDR|The lunar module, in contrast to the command module, was nothing but a tin can that buckled when you pressurized it; a lightweight tin can just strong enough to hold the pressure we needed. When we depressurized the LM, all the skin surfaces relaxed; and when we got back in and pressurized, the hatch would bow out and you could sort of feel and see the panels bow out. The hatch was nothing but a flimsy little piece of metal with a seal on it. And it didn't have a big fancy lock. It just had a little lock like you might find on a barn door: a little lever that fit into a slot. You didn't really have to lock it, because the pressure held it closed.
1170444||LMP| I know I had done this once in the KC-135 aircraft, but I don't remember whether or not that was an actual training exercise. We only got about 20 seconds at a time of one-sixth g in the airplane. And maybe we never even tried to open the PLSS (sublimator) water valve for lack of time. It was certainly harder on the Moon.
1170444||CDR|Another explanation is that we may not have trained with a 3.5 psi pressure difference. If not, then we wouldn't have had 5 psi suit pressures at this point in training.
1170511||CDR|When you moved around, like we were here, inside the lunar module, and then when we were getting out and going down the ladder, it was work even in one-sixth gravity. We had heart rates going up at times, on the lunar surface, to 140 beats a minute. And I think probably through most of the EVA that I did breathe heavy because I've got a fairly good lung capacity - I've never smoked - and I tend to do that. Throughout many of these tapes on the lunar surface activity, you'll find me taking deep breaths and sounding like I'm "breathing heavily". But it really isn't labored breathing so much as me just taking fairly deep, open-mouthed breaths.
1170516||LMP|The ECS light came on in response to cabin depressurization. The fact that it came on confirmed that we were depressurizing; and showed that the warning system was working properly.
1170842||LMP|Most of the LMPs were smaller than the Commanders; that might have something to do with it. And you could open the door a bit more without someone standing behind it. And mostly, if somebody's there to help you, he's going to help you. And, if they're not there, you're not going to have all this conversation.
1170842||CDR|I think the main reason that the Commanders had a bit more trouble is that, with a fully-suited LMP standing over behind the partially open hatch, you couldn't get it open very far and you had to sort of get down on your knees and slip sideways. Then, once the Commander was out, the LMP could move over to the Commander's side of the LM, open the hatch full bore, and use the whole cockpit for moving around and squatting down.
1171018||CDR| I think that when I was backup for Apollo 14 we had some kind of conveyor belt that we would use shipping things up and down. Quite frankly, as I recall, it was more trouble than it was worth and I don't believe we had it on 17. People sometimes would overreact and think up solutions to problems instead of sticking to the fundamentals that often worked better. If you wanted to take something up the ladder, you just carried it up, or put it over your shoulder. The things we had to haul in and haul out were not that heavy in one-sixth gravity. But here, obviously, we used a rope of some kind, probably with a hook on it, to lower the ETB straight down from the porch.
1171055||CDR| Getting down the ladder in the suit wasn't any particular problem. It would have been a lot easier without a suit; but, of course, we wouldn't have been going outside without them and they performed just tremendously, admirably. There had been a tremendous amount of technological development in the suit between my EVA on @alsjurl/alsj-GeminiSumConf.html"@alsjt>Gemini</a> IX and Apollo 17. I mean, walking on the surface with the mobility of a Gemini EVA suit would have been damn near impossible. It was just an order of magnitude difference in technological development. Many people don't realize the importance and significance of the suit. It was everything. It was radio communications; it was cooling; it was breathing; it was pressurization; it was protection from the sun; it was protection from abrasiveness. It had to provide mobility, dexterity, safety, and reliability. It was a sophisticated spacecraft in its own right, one that has been, I think, overlooked in terms of its importance to the mission.
1171558||CDR|-"Fillets were not a surprise. We expected to see fillets on some sides of a boulder and not on others and saw fillets almost everywhere we went. On some of them, you could almost draw lines in the direction that the stuff had come from. We had a good background from training and knew where to look and how to interpret what we saw.
1171608||LMP|At some point, and maybe it's here, I stepped down off the ladder onto the sloping side of a boulder which had little balls of glass and debris that made it very slick. And I slipped and my left leg went out from under me. Fortunately, I was still hanging onto the ladder.
1171622||CDR|You adapt very, very quickly. You very quickly realize, probably in the first couple of minutes, that you don't need to take baby steps or regular steps to get anywhere. Somehow your brain and your body coordinate your movements and, if you're going to go any distance - 10 or 12 or 15 feet or further away - you start skipping or hop-skipping to get where you're going. And it's not like you start running. It's just that you move with such ease. Later on, when you start moving at faster paces than we were doing here, if you decide to turn or change directions you have to think about your high center-of-mass and plan how you're going to handle that - or you're going to go tail-over-teakettle. But you adapt very readily, very quickly, physiologically and psychologically. You're conscious, as soon as you're on the surface, that you're in this one-sixth g environment and that you can move around so much more easily. I don't think we ever really said anything about it, but in five or ten minutes you knew in a general way what you could do and what you couldn't do in terms of using one-sixth gravity to your advantage. Within the first few minutes, after we got the Rover down, we just picked it up - one of us on each end - and turned it around. The human being is a very unique, very adaptable creature.
||CDR|I've forgotten the details of how the Rover deployed, but it was a slick operation. It was all done manually but most of the steps just happened automatically as we pulled the tapes.
1173031||LMP|-"In geology, 'seriate' is used to describe a population of objects in which successively smaller objects are more and more numerous.
1173114||LMP|A 'boulder' is anything about 20 cm or larger; loosely, anything you needed two hands for.
1173219||CDR|Comparing things we were seeing on the Moon with things we had seen on Earth was the only way to go. The analogies may not have been perfect, but they gave people on the ground clear ideas of the important features of what we were looking at.
1173643||CDR|Even though the suit was stiff, and even though you weighed 300 Earth pounds with all that equipment, in one-sixth gravity you weighed 50 pounds and could get up pretty easily. If you wanted to be cautious about getting up, and you had a rock or something like the Rover to give you leverage, you could literally get to your knees, get one leg out and, then push or pull yourself up with your hand. However, even though you could get up, you didn't want to fall, particularly a hard fall, because you were always aware that you could puncture your suit.
1173933||CDR|Working in one-sixth g outside a spacecraft was head and shoulders over working outside in zero gravity, as I did on my Gemini IX flight. It's true that, in zero gravity you can float around and move around easily; but it gives you so many other problems. One-sixth g is just enough gravity to give you a 'down', but it's not so much gravity that it gives you the problems working in a heavy pressure suit that you'd have on Earth. It's just enough gravity to give you a reference and it's not enough to hurt you. Much better than zero gravity. I'm a one-sixth g supporter any day in the week. And, even in the spacecraft, when we were out of the suits, eating and working and talking, one-sixth gravity - by far - was much better than zero gravity. You could drink water out of a cup; and, if you set something down, it stayed down.
1174349||LMP|Although we did a little training with me sitting in Gene's Rover seat, there was never any anticipation that Gene would decide that he didn't want to drive.
1174415||CDR|The dust was very difficult to work in and was a big hindrance. It obscured your vision if you let it get on your visor. It was almost like a dew or mist because it clung to everything. It got on every movable surface, it got in the suits, and when we got out of our suits in the spacecraft in between EVAs, it got in the pores of our skin and got under our fingernails. And it didn't just get on the outside parts of our nails and get them dirty but, literally, it got down between the skin and the nail. It took three months for lunar dust to grow out from under my nails. It infiltrates.
1174415||CDR|I describe lunar dust as being like very, very fine graphite. But graphite is a lubricating material; this is not. This is just the opposite; it's very abrasive. And it has a smell very few people, if any, have smelled on the Earth. It smells something like spent gunpowder; like you've just fired a shotgun or something and you can smell that powder. The dust made lunar operations half again more difficult than it would have been without the dust. It took time to dust ourselves off, to clean the equipment. I knocked a fender off and quickly found out that you can't operate in a Rover vehicle without a fender because you throw dust all over.
1174415||LMP|I don't remember the dust creating an obscuration problem, except that, when you looked back into the Sun, the Sun would sparkle over it like a dirty windshield.
1174421||LMP|'Wiping out' the controller is a hand motion a bit like wiping a table. It's an old pilot's term for what you do to the stick in an airplane to check that all your ailerons are working, and Gene was just transferring that expression to the Rover, checking all of the controller positions.
1174520||LMP|The whole exercise had been put together on the assumption that we would have two pairs of scissors; but, because Ron had lost his and we had left him one of our pairs, we had to keep track of the one pair we had left. And, of course, they'd fallen out of the ETB as it was being lowered out of the LM. We took them out onto the surface just as a contingency tool, but we had to have them when we went back in the LM because otherwise we would have had a tough time opening the food containers.
1174804||CDR|While I don't remember the details, if the Rover hadn't worked, we were going to try and cover some of the same ground; but we wouldn't have gone nearly as far or have accomplished nearly as much as we did.
1174804||LMP|It was my position that the probability of the Rover failing was small, so why waste our time in training or planning on walking traverses that you could put together fairly easily in real-time. You knew basically where you wanted to go and you just would have to see how well you were doing and how much energy it was going to take. We couldn't have taken all of the equipment, but we had the bags for samples. I'm not sure we could have mounted SCBs on both sides of the PLSSs - might only have had one apiece - but we could have put quite a bit of equipment in one SCB and samples in the other. It would have been awkward, but there would be no question that we would have gotten something done. The real question is how far we could have gone. And I suspect that on the first EVA we wouldn't have gone very far until we were use to it. But it is still my contention that, if you got up-to-speed striding, you could have gone as far as you did with the Rover. It just would have taken more energy and your walkback constraints would have changed. I'm sure the Flight Control people would have been very conservative with walkback, at least with the first two EVAs; we might have gotten the envelope opened up a little bit for the third. I doubt if they would have let us go to Nansen, because that was right at the edge of the Rover walkback envelope; but we probably could have gotten up the hillside to Station 6, simply by going sidehill rather than directly uphill like the Apollo 14 guys did. But I just couldn't imagine very many reasonable failures that would keep you from having the Rover. You had front and rear wheel drive so you could go either way; and you could lift it out of any hole it got into.
1175050||LMP|At this point, I was talking out loud, just getting a feel for what things looked like, transitioning from the theory and the experience of others to personal experience. We expected that craters bigger than some size would penetrate through the soil and bring up bedrock fragments; but I hadn't yet learned to distinguish between regolith breccia (soil compacted and partially fused in an impact, also known as 'instant rock') and actual basaltic rock fragments that would have come off the bedrock. The language I used often wasn't very precise at any point in the mission, but at this point I was just feeling my way about how I was going to talk about these things.
1175234||LMP|I wasn't going to worry about where we were exactly. We were close to the planned landing site and we certainly weren't going to have any trouble finding Camelot or any of the other places. (Changing topics) Somewhere, and possibly in here where Gene was describing the landing site, the cuff on my urine collection device was too tight. I needed to urinate but couldn't unless I really forced it. And that was very uncomfortable. Once we got back in after the EVA, I took the rest of the cuffs and stretched them over the handcontrollers in the LM.
1175348||LMP|I spent a lot of time in the Receiving Lab looking at samples from the other missions, and had in my own mind a grain-size classification and a variety of other classifications that I'd be using throughout all of this. I shouldn't really have used the term 'gabbro', but it had stuck in my mind as a way to distinguish a coarser-grained version of basalt. That is, if I could see distinct, clear crystals and make a guess at what they were, I think I consistently called it a 'gabbro'. However, by definition, basalt is fine-grained; gabbro has the same chemical composition but is coarse-grained, although more coarse-grained than anything we saw on the valley floor. So I probably confused a lot of people on the ground. But this was coarser-grained than a lot of things that I had seen in hand specimens from other missions. This had grains up to a millimeter or so across, whereas many of the samples (from other missions) were so fine grained that they were even glassy.
1175432||CDR|Here, I was obviously getting out of the Rover. And it just took a little while to find out how to do it. With the gravity too low to really pull you down to the ground when you got out, you literally had to push yourself up and out. You quickly learned how to do things the easy way, because there is an easy way in one-sixth gravity.
1175458||CDR|After we had unstowed the Rover from the LM and had assembled it, then we had to load it. We had to load the front end with all of its electronics, communications gear, and television, and the back end with all of our tools, all our collection bags, all our sample bags, everything else was all loaded on back there. The only big exception was the ALSEP equipment which Jack carried out to the site.
1175503||CDR|This is a very characteristic expression of Jack's, always acting surprised when he finds 'the old brown whatchamacallit'.
1175552||CDR|The LCRU (Lunar Communications Relay Unit) was a couple of big electronics boxes to handle the radio and TV. The whole thing was about 18 inches wide, about 6 inches high, and maybe 12 inches deep; it had dust cover flaps and, when we weren't driving, we could open the flaps and expose a radiator so that the LCRU could cool. We put it on the front of the Rover and, once we got that thing set up, we didn't even have to relay through the LM.
1175552||LMP|Either the batteries or the LCRU cooled by using a wax reservoir. Probably the batteries now that I think about it. The idea was that the wax (3.5 pounds) would melt while you were using the battery and generating heat; and then, between EVAs, it would radiate and cool and the wax would harden again. The LCRU had mirror radiators.
1175606||LMP|Eventually, that gate latch got dust in it and wouldn't work. On our last traverse, when we got to the LM, the gate was flapping in the breeze.
1175905||LMP|Throwing things was fun; but you also had to watch out you didn't hit somebody.
1175907||LMP|We were trying to upset the ground, @alsjurl/JSC-OralHist.html"@alsjt>Ed Fendell</a> in particular, and make them think Gene was about to throw the TV camera. @alsjurl/a15/a15.lrvload.html#1210304"@alsjt>Ed</a> was the person who remotely operated the TV camera from Houston.
1180114||CDR|The low-gain antenna was a tube about an inch and a half in diameter and about 2 feet long. There was a handle on the mast, right in front of me, and as I drove the Rover, I could point it generally in the direction of the Earth. We could drive and maintain radio contact the whole time, and it worked out real well.
1180114||CDR|The high-gain antenna for the television was on the front of the Rover, as I remember, and we couldn't reach it (as we drove). We aligned it after we stopped; but, if it was, per chance, pointed at the Earth and we were driving in a straight line, we could have gotten television as well. We talked about trying to do that, but I don't think we did. I think 15 or 16 transmitted some TV while they were driving.
1180147||LMP|It also kept me busy.
1180149||CDR|This is typical of Jack, including the bad pun. I know that I talked out loud about what I was doing, and I still do it today: I play golf and I talk to myself.
1180238||LMP|We're getting the low-gain antenna out of its storage slot in the side of the MESA, and the connector - which may have been a separate piece - had gotten wedged.
1180351||LMP|Ray Batson was the U.S. Geological Survey/ Flagstaff expert on photogrammetry and was the Godfather of the gnomon. He developed it so they could quantitatively control the stereopairs that we would take on the traverses. It provided a physical scale, a vertical reference, a gray scale and a color scale, and its shadow gave an azimuthal reference.
1180528||LMP|I was having fun. You're there and you're doing what you planned to do; and you might as well enjoy it.
1180823||LMP|Soon after we got back, somebody put out an environmental poster that said 'If you've seen one Earth, you've seen them all'.
1180823||CDR|Obviously, Jack and I have looked at the Earth differently. I think we had very different subconscious views of what we saw. That's always been true and it's probably true in all twelve guys. To me, the Earth was a very dominant part of our mission. It certainly made a statement. You could hardly not notice that it was visible. It was a dominant presence in our valley, without question.
1180823||CDR|For Jim Irwin, going to the Moon was a religious experience and, for me, it was a spiritual experience in terms of being there and looking back at the Earth, realizing the significance of what was going on. The piloting part was very important for me to do well, better than it had ever been done before. That's the nature of a pilot. And, as for the science - although maybe I shouldn't say this - it was a part of our mission but it certainly was not the overriding part of me, and it's not the part that's overriding for me in my memory bank at all. Of course, for Jack, for a geologist, the Moon was a utopia, a thing you would dream of your entire life. Well, I was not a geologist by trade or profession and, although I tried to be one for the moment, being on the Moon was more of a spiritual experience for me. Religion is what you make it, where you make it. But the mission did bring home to me, very clearly, that Science has a long way to go yet to find an answer for the creation of the small part of the Universe that I was privileged to see. It doesn't make any difference who your God is or how you address him; the Earth was just too beautiful to have happened by accident. There has to be somebody bigger than me who put it together. And when I say spiritual, that's what I mean.
1180823||CDR|Charlie Duke is a born-again Christian and who is to say that that might not have happened if he hadn't gone to the Moon. Jim Irwin looks back at it as a very religious experience, but Jim was like that before he went to the Moon. And Jack looks at it from a humanist point of view. What's important to Jack is what Man does with his life; and, although Jack's a very philosophical sort of guy, the creation of the Earth, from a philosophical point of view, is not something that he expresses himself on very strongly. But we all have different points of view. I had the experience of going to the Moon twice, of being able to go back and say 'Is this what I really saw? Is this what I really felt? Is this what it really looked like?' To have seven more days at the Moon to do that is a pretty unique experience in itself.
1180823||LMP|On the trip out to the Moon, I had spent a lot of time looking at the Earth. I had this little program of meteorological observations that I wanted to undertake, so I'd already spent a lot of time looking at it, and so that's why I was acting a little more blas&eacute;.
1181029||LMP|Earth is about four times as big in the lunar sky as the Moon is in the terrestrial sky; but you don't sense that because you have no other visual references for size. There are no trees or poles or houses or anything between you and the horizon that you can use to estimate how big the Earth is.
1181753||CDR|I don't remember much about it, except that it was a buddy-breathing system - a set of hoses and stuff - that would let us share one of the oxygen supplies if the other one failed. It would have restricted our movements, but it also would have got us back to the LM.
1181753||LMP|It rings a very faint bell that we had something called a Buddy SLSS; and the fact that neither of us remembers much about it shows how much we felt we'd need it!
1181922||CDR|The flag that we took to deploy was the one that had hung on the wall of the Mission Control Center during all the landing missions. And we also had another flag, which we brought back to replace the one that we deployed at Taurus-Littrow." See NASA photo @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#S7338346"@alsjt>S73-38346</a> which shows Gene and Jack persenting the replacement flag to Gene Kranz in the MOCR in December 1973.
1182149||CDR|I don't know how deep it went, but deep enough that it was very firmly planted. Obviously, we hit something hard, momentarily, and then went through. Nothing's going to blow that flag over.
1182158||CDR|There were two sections to the pole: the bottom section which had a hardened top on it so that, when you banged it into the ground, you didn't smash it in. The top section just telescoped down inside the section you banged into the ground, and that held the flag. The flag was on a two-section, curtain-rod type thing that was folded up. You unwrapped the flag, swung this curtain rod up, latched it at roughly 90 degree angle to the pole, and then extended the outer part of it. The flag looked all wrinkled, because it was folded up all wrinkled.
1182246||LMP|You couldn't actually see your feet without bending over, but you could anticipate what was in front of you well enough. Going side-to-side or backwards, you just had to be sure there was nothing in the way.
1182823||LMP|This wasn't an unstable position because there was no tendency to fall over on your back; but you were straining to stay there. You were straining against the suit and that took energy. You had very little mechanical advantage over the suit and, any time you had to bend it, it was work. The Apollo suits were adequate, but there certainly needs to be a major engineering effort on new suits.
1182927||CDR|'O.K. Number Three Wire' is another naval-aviator, carrier-pilot's term. There's generally four wires on the flight deck and you can catch 1, 2, 3, or 4. Obviously, if you come out of a carrier landing alive, it's successful; but 'O.K., Three Wire' is a term the LSO (Landing Signal Officer) gives you if you just make a perfect, super landing aboard ship. He'll write down the wire he got; he might say, 'low in the groove, number one wire' or 'high and fast, number four wire' or 'slow at the ramp, number two wire' or 'FAB' - which means faster than a bastard - number three wire' or he could say, "OK, number three wire" and that's about as good a landing as you can make. Nothing compares to the challenge of a night carrier landing, not even the challenge of landing a LM on the moon. In a carrier landing, it's dark, you can't see anything, your target's moving around, and it's a small deck. Landing the LM, you've got lots of people helping you; and you've got ways to abort out of it. Anyone who has ever flown on a carrier will know what I'm talking about.
1182957||CDR|I had two watches: one inside my suit which I kept on Houston time, and the other on the outside which we started - probably at 12 o'clock - when we started the EVA and could compare with the planned times in the checklists. The timeline was important, and we tried to stay with it.
1183101||CDR|I had a firm idea in my mind about how I wanted to land. I wanted to bring that thing down as quickly as possible and then, when we got down within the 50 or 60 feet range, slow down to two or three per second and maintain two or three feet per second and a little forward velocity of a foot or so per second forward. You learned very quickly in the @alsjurl/LLTV-952.html"@alsjt>LLTV</a> that if you tried to get it down at about one foot per second, all of a sudden you started hovering, or maybe you put a little bit too much thrust in and you started going up a little. So I tried to keep going down.
1183725||CDR|At one time, I think there was a pulley we could use to lower the ALSEP to the ground. We probably took them off. I didn't like all that extra garbage; I thought we could handle things quicker without all those crutches. It was just a matter of wanting fewer things to mess with. But Jack found himself, as he said, 'in the hole' and had to reach higher than he wanted.
1183731||LMP|There were some pulleys originally, but we had more problems with them than they were worth. As it turned out, I don't think we had a great deal of problems getting the packages out.
1183819||CDR|This is a response to "should you send man or machine into space?" We've had a lot of controversy and comment on that over the years, and this was just a subtle little comment to reinforce man's usefulness in space, even for a seemingly simple operation.
1183854||LMP|Although we'd learned a lot of things from the prior crews, we'd never personally had a chance to do things in one-sixth gravity. One-sixth gravity is something you can take advantage of, and we learned very quickly. For example, because things don't accelerate as quickly, you just have more time to react. I often found that if I had something like the hammer in one hand, and I wanted to shift it to the other hand, rather than actually move my hands together, I could just flip it and catch it. Moving your hands together is a lot of work in the suit; but if you just flip something, that's not much work at all. Here, Gene may have instinctively done something the way he would have in one gravity and realized there was an easier way to do it in one-sixth gravity; or he just forgot - as I often did, and I think we all did in the intensity of the moment - what was the best way to do something.
1183941||LMP|In the early days of EVA training, down in Florida on a not-very-well-simulated lunar surface we had outside the simulator building, we were operating with air cooling; we were just forcing (chilled) air through the suit. I was responsible for orchestrating a lot of the training, and I remember for Apollo 12 I got increasingly worried about the heat loads that were building up during this EVA training in the pressurized suits. Even with the lightweight backpack, Conrad and Bean were working awfully hard and getting awfully hot, just as I had in running some of the simulations. I was afraid we were going to hurt somebody because some of these guys, probably myself included, once they got involved in a task, were the sort who wouldn't say 'quit' until they passed out. And we certainly didn't need that. So I started to talk with the support crew and basically asked them if we could figure out a way to use ice water in the liquid-cooled underwear. Several guys went to work on that and what they did was add a water hose to the air hose we were already using and connected it to the liquid-cooled garment and then carried around a supply of ice water on their own backs. It made all the difference in the world; it was still tough, but at least you didn't get overheated. So there was always a guy around carrying your ice-water supply, but they were very good at staying out of sight behind you, and you had to turn real quick to know they were there. And that's what I was talking about.
1183941||CDR|As I read through this, I remember seeing a book or an article that somebody put together about how, on Apollo 17, we were visited by an outer-space alien. They took our lunar surface transcripts and pulled out unique parts of them which made it sound as if we were referring to somebody else being there. I remember one thing in particular: (at the end of EVA-1 at 123:28:30) we had a piece of foam rubber or something crack and sort of blow up in the sky, and I said 'What's that?' And here, I'm saying, 'Hey, you notice there's none of those guys up there holding those hoses.' And we go around the LM and Jack says, 'What do you mean? I just saw one a minute ago.' And these people, or this guy, took these kinds of things out of our transcripts, out of context, and put a whole story together that was almost believable. If I hadn't been there myself, I would have thought that an alien spacecraft landed next to us and these comments were referring to that. It was amazing what you can do with editing.
1184113||CDR|This was not an old joke; but here I am, on the lunar surface in this big, mountainous terrain, and he's telling me it looks flat and smooth!
1184407||CDR|In listening to the tape just now, I knew before he said it that Bob was going to come back with 'Hello, Challenger.' That's just typical of both Jack and Bob: playing verbal games, having fun.
1184657||LMP|The fuel element was in a graphite capsule hanging on the outside of the LM next to the ALSEP stowage area. You tilted it down to a horizontal position so that you could get at the @alsjurl/rtg.cask.detail.jpg"@alsjt>dome</a> to get it off. The theory behind the capsule was that, if you had a breakup during launch or a re-entry because of an accident in orbit, the capsule would separate and re-enter intact so that the element itself would not be exposed and put plutonium into the atmosphere. So you had to take the capsule apart by taking this dome off; we had a special tool to do that and another tool to latch onto the fuel element and extract it out of the graphite capsule. I don't think there were threads involved in the dome removal. If I remember correctly, it had three prongs and pins and you put them in slots and you screwed the pins in and that released the catches that were holding the dome in there. Clearly there was a turning that was involved and something had gotten stripped.
1184724||CDR|To get the fuel element out, you tilted the cask and used this removal tool. You didn't want to get too close to the fuel, because it was radioactive (and, more importantly, was thermally hot enough to damage the suit); so, once you had the dome off, you would use the tool to pull the fuel element out. Well, with the dome threads stripped, we were going to have to use the sharp point of the hammer to pry the dome off.
1185107||LMP|The ALSEP turned out to be a lot harder to carry than you would have imagined, mainly because your forearms were already tired from doing so much work. You had to grip that handle and carry it some 300 feet to a reasonable site and that was almost the last straw; you didn't know if you were ever going to recover and be able to use your hands again. It weighed about 350 Earth-pounds. On the Moon it was only 60 pounds; and the problem was gripping that handle of the barbell.
1185150||LMP|Recently, a lot of us have been trying to figure out why it is that, when you stir up the surface near the LM, it seems darker while, away from the LM, you don't see that. And my conclusion at this point is that the winnowing effect of the descent engine effluent increases the frequency of small rock fragments compared with dust in the area around the LM, and that, in turn, results in a higher than normal albedo. Rock fragments give you a higher albedo than the dust does. And so, when you walk over it and stir it up, you bring up the normal regolith on top of this winnowed material. And as you move farther and farther away from the effects of the descent engine, you see less and less of that happening. The samples taken near the LM and underneath the LM never showed any chemical contamination or any other reason for that lighter-colored albedo. Yet the visual effect was so marked that you could see a landing site from orbit. We could see ours after we were back in orbit, and we could see Apollo 15 when we flew over it later in the mission.
1185308||LMP|This 'mottled' appearance was probably the result of the small, whitish halos that were produced around every one of the micrometeorite impacts. The shattering of the plagioclase made it lighter colored that it had been to begin with.
1185443||LMP|Walking down-Sun, the swale wasn't obvious until you got there. Looking up-Sun from the other side, it probably was fairly obvious from the photometric shading that occurs when the sunlight strikes at a glancing angle.
1185443||CDR|I don't remember noticing the swale during the descent. And if I did, it wouldn't have bothered me. All it would have done was pitch us forward a little bit, and what I was really looking for was the holes and boulders.
1185610||LMP|These were gross-leveling blocks. The idea was that, if your site wasn't quite flat, you could put one under a corner of the ALSEP package and get your initial level. Why we ever had them I'll never know; there were always plenty of rocks you could use. People working in a non-real environment came up with the idea.
1185741||LMP|The pinkish color could be the result of one of two things. Any exposed rock surface has a thin patina or coating that looks a little like desert varnish. However, desert varnish is caused by chemical precipitation, while this is a thin, semi-continuous splattering of brown glass from the micrometeorite impacts. The patina may have looked pinkish to me at this point. Or, the clinopyroxene in the rock might have been giving it a pinkish cast in the full Sun.
1185741||CDR|Because there was dust on everything, once you got a piece of tape off the roll, the first thing the tape stuck to was dust; and then it didn't stick to anything else.
1185814||CDR|The suit made using the tape more difficult than it would have been otherwise. You don't have as much dexterity with your hands and fingers to get the tape off the roll and tear it. We used the old trick of folding over a little piece of the end so that that piece wouldn't stick back on the roll; otherwise, you'd never get it off.
1185931||LMP|Through the years I had deployed versions of the ALSEP enough times that the geometry was pretty well fixed in my mind. I could look at an area and, in my imagination, place where everything was going to be and try to pick a compromise site. Nothing was going to be perfect; there were too many variables. But it's one of those things that you can do fairly easily with enough practice that would also be tough to automate. The main problem with the ALSEP was that it took a lot of time to deploy. Much more than it needed to had we designed it to minimize time initially. It got off to a bad start and never fully recovered. Before my time, Walt Cunningham had told the Bendix people 'Give us something to do on the Moon.' And they did. The other extreme was when Bill Anders saw it and said, 'I want a big red button and when I punch it, it gets deployed.' And we ended up in the middle somewhere, still taking an awful lot of time and effort to deploy it. Not the best use of human time on the Moon. Deciding where to deploy is a good use of people; but the actual deployment should have been far more straight-forward than it was.
1190705||CDR|We had the low-gain antenna set up with a heading indicator; and we'd done some work with it in training. I knew generally what my heading was going to be, and in this case it was going to be west. So, rather than try and sight the antenna while I was going, in this case I just set the low-gain on the 270 mark. I never had to worry about the elevation because it was just about always the same no matter where we were.
1190916||LMP|Because the RTG was producing power when we hadn't yet hooked up any of the equipment, they had what was called a shorting plug that basically allowed current to flow out of the RTG and then back into itself. And, obviously, some resistance had been put somewhere in the circuit it made so that the power source wouldn't burn itself out.
1190937||CDR|As I remember, if I was at the front of the Rover facing the back, the battery covers would open toward me. So if you parked the Rover facing east, the covers would shadow the batteries from the Sun and let them cool.
1191413||LMP|We established one place in the deployment site where you'd put all the discards, all the things that were designed to isolate vibrations, to assist in packing: shims, dust covers, and other things that people felt were necessary to protect the equipment. The idea of having a garbage pile was partly to keep the site neat, but also to keep things from being under foot. I'm throwing things toward the pile and often not hitting it, usually throwing things too far.
1191445||LMP|This statement seems to imply that during training it was hard to get the pins lined up. But, apparently, perseverance succeeded.
1191627||CDR|It felt like a shot of ice water.
1191759||LMP|In those days, they were saying that the missions each cost a half billion dollars, half for the hardware, half for operations. If you spread that over the two of us being out on the surface for twenty-two hours, it comes out to about $200,000 per EVA minute.
1191827||LMP|We had originally had things called Calfax fasteners holding the equipment together, but they were far too complicated. I made a stink about that early on, way back in the mid-sixties. So they invented or found another way to do it and replaced all the Calfax fasteners with these @alsjurl/alsj-BoydBolts.html"@alsjt>Boyd bolts</a>. The Calfax you had to turn several times; and these you only had to push in with the UHT and then turn a three-quarter turn and it would pop loose.
1191827||LMP|The change from Calfax fasteners to Boyd bolts occurred well before the first ALSEP. We changed that at Bendix as soon as I got involved. As I've already mentioned, Walt Cunningham, on a visit to Bendix early in the history of the ALSEP program - not knowing that there was going to be lots of things to see and do and describe and photograph - told them to give us something to do. So Bendix put as many fasteners on this thing as they could. But when Bill Anders and I showed up there - probably in '67, maybe late '66 - we saw this monster that they had constructed with over fifty of these Calfax fasteners. I think it took two-and-a-half turns on each of them to get them loose. So we yelled and screamed. Well, not 'yelled and screamed'; but we suggested to them that they try to find a better fastener and reduce the number as much as they possibly could. To be fair to Bendix, the contractors sometimes had a hell of a time responding to astronaut inputs. They felt like they ought to respond and so they had responded; and then the guy who made the input disappears - Cunningham was off working on Apollo 7 by this time and was out of the picture - and a couple of more come on who have different ideas.
1191827||LMP|On my first visit to Bendix in Ann Arbor with Bill Anders - we flew up there in a little T-33 - I think we went through a shirtsleeve deployment of the mock-up that they had at the time. And that's when we just about raised the roof on how long it was going to take and how much was required physically. We really forced them into a whole re-design on the packaging and deployment. The issue of the fasteners is the one that sticks in my mind because they were so egregious, but I'm sure there were lots of other change orders written. I spent a lot of time trying to work with Bendix because I didn't want to use up any more time deploying the ALSEP than was absolutely necessary. There were so many other things that I wanted to do, and wanted the rest of the guys to do - mostly collecting samples - that I wanted to minimize the amount of time we spend on the deployment. Deploying the ALSEP is exactly the kind of thing that robots generally ought to be used for, except for certain things like getting seismometers deployed and leveled. Things like that are tough to do automatically and is probably cost effective to have a man do it. But a lot of this other stuff could have been done robotically, even in those days. It's just that the program didn't try to do it that way.
1191955||LMP|As I recall, in order to train with the drill, you wanted to drill in a lunar soil simulant. So we had a big can or drum or bin filled with the stuff - dry and tamped down - and when we got to this point, Gene would go over and drill his hole in the can of simulant.
1192212||LMP|There was a level bubble and a little gnomon, and I would have seen movement too small to see in the TV picture.
1192224||LMP|As I remember, it did partially uncage and, eventually, they learned how to use the instrument as a seismometer.
1192240||LMP|Because we were at 23 north latitude, and because the Sun was already up maybe 8 to 10 degrees, it wasn't exactly east of us. There was probably a mark on the device that took that into account and showed me how to place the gnomon shadow so that the whole experiment would be properly aligned relative to east-west.
1192303||LMP|Generally, you didn't want the cables taut but, rather, with a bit slack so that they could drape over craters. But you also didn't want them to drape over rocks.
1192653||LMP|I don't recall that we had developed any contingency plans for walking traverses. I think the idea was that, if it ever came to that, you'd develop plans in real-time, depending on what you'd gotten done before the Rover failed. With all the redundancy built into the Rover, and with two successful Rover missions completed, they figured that it wasn't much of a risk. If we'd had to, I think we could have probably gotten to our main objectives almost as fast loping as we could driving. You could move pretty fast, and it wasn't an effort, that I recall. I don't think they would have let us go all the way to Station 2, but I think we could have made it up the Scarp. It would have been tough climbing, but we probably could have done it climbing sidehill, zig-zagging up. The main problem was the lack of flexibility in the hip. It wasn't hard to stretch your leg, but lifting your thigh was difficult.
1192740||LMP|The Support Crew had all sorts of clever little sayings and pictures and stuff like that that they would put into the checklist. Bob's favorite, since our motto was 'the end of the beginning', was 'this is the end, not the beginning'. And he had some little pink patches he called "Rover patches" as distinct from the flight patches; and there may have been something like that in the checklist at this point. Some of it you couldn't repeat over the airway. Or maybe this was just another part of the private joke.
1192843||LMP|The legs on Gene's drill-stem rack were packed unextended and when you extended them, they popped out with a spring. In training, they may have actually fallen off.
1193007||LMP|I was probably supposed to put the UHT in a socket and rotate it; the instrument was probably locked unless you put the UHT in and rotate it. Obviously, I had forgotten to do that in training and had forgotten again on the Moon.
1193049||LMP|We had done the deployment often enough in training that I had a feel for how far away he was supposed to be.
1193200||LMP|This was probably a safety seal that held down the cover on the port. I had to remove it so that, when they later sent the Open signal, the screen would come off. You'll notice that I've moved well away from the LMS by this point. Often we did that - wait to brief them on something that had already happened - because it wasn't convenient to break in.
1193234||LMP|I may have been in a deeper depression than I had expected, although the pictures certainly don't show anything dramatic.
1193353||CDR|Because of the weight of the PLSS, you had a tendency to lean forward and put a little torque or bending motion on the drill stem. The worry was having it bind up as a result.
1193353||LMP|There may also have been some consideration of optimizing power usage. The motor would have been more efficient at medium power levels than at higher power levels.
1193354||CDR|Thinking about when I said 'it sounds like she's chipping away', you have to remember that sound and feel are very closely related, just like in the lift-off of the Saturn V. Do you "hear" the noise or do you "feel" the noise? In this particular case the "noise" or the vibration traveled from my hands up into my suit. So was I hearing it or was I feeling it. Probably feeling it; but sound and feel are very closely related when you're in an environment like that.
1193525||LMP|In drilling those holes, it was nice that fifty percent of the regolith is particles smaller than 100 microns. The chances of hitting a large rock were pretty small, in spite of what you see scattered around on the surface. Because you're looking across the surface at a very low angle, you get a distorted view of how many rocks there are.
1193708||LMP|By leveling the Central Station and getting it aligned relative to the Sun, I could then use pre-determined coordinates for pointing the antenna.
1193714||CDR|We knew they were watching a lot of things on the television, so when we made a statement, we didn't necessarily make a complete statement because we knew they're looking at what we're talking about. In this case, I was talking about the difficulty of getting the wrench off.
1194350||CDR|It was tough drilling. You had to hold the drill to keep it from turning in your hands and you had to put pressure on it. As I remember, it was during the drilling that I got heart rates up to 120 or 130. It was hard work, and that's why I had to rest every once in a while. You can hear how hard a job it was in the sound of my voice.
1194359||CDR|If you hold a drill, the motor turns the drill stem and the bit. But if the bit gets hung up, and you let go of the drill, the motor spins the drill. It was very difficult to keep the drill from rotating; you really had to work at it. Here on Earth, in your back yard or in your garage, you've at least got full Earth gravity holding you down; but on the Moon, even with the weight of the PLSS you weigh a lot less and it's harder to hold onto the drill when it binds.
1194845||LMP|The four corners of the thermal curtain were sealed with Velcro, and it never worked very well. Because of the Apollo fire, we had to have Teflon Velcro; and that just isn't very good Velcro.
1195200||CDR|I remember that, at the end of the day, my fingers and forearms were very tired. You were always moving your fingers against the pressure in the gloves.
1195440||CDR|One thing I ought to mention here, in case I forget it, is that on the first day you never felt any heat soak into your gloves. But I remember that on the third day you could feel the heat soaking in. That's because the Sun was 26 degrees higher than it was on the first day. You couldn't feel it on your body because you had the liquid-cooled garment; but your hands had no liquid cooling on them and, also, your hands were sitting out in the sunshine a lot of the time.
1195709||CDR|With the station not level, you would just try to get the antenna pointed more or less in the right direction and see if you had an acceptable signal strength.
1195744||LMP|Whatever fluid they used evidently had surface tension in excess of the one-sixth g buoyant forces that were trying to move the bubble to the center, at least when the bubble was over at the edge. It took a jarring motion of some sort to break that surface tension.
1195823||LMP|In analyzing cores, people had looked for and found radioisotopes which had been formed by the absorption of cosmic-ray neutrons in the lunar soil. If you knew the neutron flux and spectrum, you could use the abundance of these isotopes to determine ages and turnover rates for the soil. There had been estimates made of the neutron flux and, and there were also a lot of arguments about the estimates. This experiment was designed to give a direct measurement.
1195846||LMP|I suspect that we had practiced this specific ALSEP deployment a half dozen times. I had done the Apollo 15 deployment a few times as part of the backup crew training; and Gene had done the Apollo 14 deployment. You didn't want to train for it too much, because each situation was going to be different. You needed to know it just well enough to be able to be adaptable, and a half dozen times seemed about right.
1195931||LMP|The fluid surrounding the level bubbles was probably an oil that wouldn't freeze when it got cold in the LM Equipment Bay. We'd been in the barbecue mode on the way out, rotating the spacecraft to get uniform heating, but there wasn't any active heating in the Equipment Bay and it would have gotten pretty cold. I was probably thinking that the fluid was still a little viscous from having been cold. Maybe that was why the bubble stuck.
1200615||LMP|Anything that is not hermetically sealed is just not going to work very long.
1200635||LMP|There were two UHTs. Gene had used his to carry the heat flow electronics box and align it; and then just left the UHT in the heat flow box. So he's warning me not to disturb the alignment when I go to get his UHT later on.
1200655||CDR|When you stop working and take a rest, you have a chance to look around. Earlier, when I was taking a rest from drilling the first heat flow hole, I had a chance to get ahead and talk to the ground about a place for the core hole, which I wasn't going to do for a long time yet. When you took a rest, that was the only chance you had to just look around; otherwise, you got so involved with what you were doing that you had tunnel vision and your perspective was very limited. So I looked around and said 'Oh, looks like it's getting dark.' Well, I probably had been facing all this bright, reflective soil while I was drilling the hole and all of a sudden I stopped and looked around and things didn't look so bright.
1201000||CDR|When the drill's spinning and it hits something, it kicks the drill and spits it back at you. Not vertically, but rotationally. It was tough drilling. I was pushing down and all of sudden it hit something solid; the motor was still running but the bit stopped, so something had to turn. So, the drill turned backwards.
1201354||LMP|Except for the little things, the ALSEP deployment went pretty much like training; and many, if not most, of the little problems had already happened in training. The only physically difficult part of the deployment was carrying the ALSEP out to the site, and then using your hands. All the manipulation just wore out the forearm muscles. You went slower and slower and slower, and then you got to the point where you started dropping things.
1201741||LMP|By running the heat flow cable southward out of the hole, you got more uniform heating than you would if the cable ran east or west. That way you could calculate more easily the error that cable heating introduced into the measurements.
1201741||LMP|Although it doesn't look like it on the television, you actually had to rotate your hips a little bit to get your feet to stick into the ground.
1201842||CDR|I called the heat flow rammer a 'javelin' because what I really wanted to do was give it a heave-ho on the Moon and see what it would do.
1201927||CDR|The checklist pages were made of fairly stiff paper and were about two-and-a-half inches square. They lay flat on your wrist because they were bound with a spiral wire hinge that forced them to bow up. As soon as you turned a page, the hinge put a stress on it and it would lay flat. The tabs that you used to turn the page weren't very large, but even in the gloves it wasn't really hard to get them turned.
1202121||LMP|Each of the geophones was a cylinder that had a stake on one end. You put the point in the ground and then just stepped on the geophone to push it down into the surface.
1202613||LMP|For various reasons, you sometimes see places in a rock where it's splitting and coming apart. In this case I was saying that I thought the splitting in the rock I'd just examined was produced by the alignment of prismatic habit minerals parallel to that plane; and that's called a foliation. What that implies is some kind of stress during crystallization, either a flow stress as in a volcanic rock, or a shear stress during re-crystallization. By 'outcrop' you'd usually mean something attached to bedrock; in this case there would have been no evidence of that but, for some reason, probably just the size of the boulder, I used the term.
1202741||LMP|By now I'm taking longer and longer strides and the running technique is getting to be very much like cross-country skiing. On future missions, either for recreation or for an emergency walkback, you ought to have ski poles available for stabilization. At this point I wasn't breathing hard and I think that, with poles, you could go faster than the Rover can drive (10-12 km/hr on a level surface) without expending much energy. And that way you could greatly extend your driving distance with a Rover. I also think the recreation of choice will be getting out and taking long 'skiing' trips. Just like with cross-country skiing, I think you could almost keep it up indefinitely. And if you had a suit with more hip-and-ankle mobility I think you really could do 10-15 km/hr, a good cross-country speed on flat terrain.
1202822||LMP|I don't remember why, but we didn't want the geophone cables to be suspended above the surface as they went across craters and depressions but, rather, wanted them to follow the contours.
1203116||LMP|We had anticipated that if any of the lines got pulled and the module moved, one or more of the geophones would get pulled out. So we equipped the module with an anchor of some sort, to keep it stationary. Obviously, the anchors wouldn't hold in the loose soil.
1203302||CDR|As I said earlier, when you stop and take a rest, that's when you have a chance to look around. You've got a second or two to yourself. You take a deep breath, take a rest for a second, and look around, and that's when you begin to enjoy your environment, look at what Jack's doing, look at the beautiful Earth, or notice just how high the mountains are. These are the times you can steal for yourself. But that first "oh boy" here definitely referred to how tired my hands were from working with the drill.
1203510||CDR|In addition to getting tired in the hands and forearms, the other thing that was tiring was getting down and getting up. In training on Earth, with all the weight of a full backpack in full gravity, it was damn near impossible to get down and get back up. That's why, a lot of times in training we used lightweight backpacks with hoses supplying oxygen and cooling water so we wouldn't have to carry that weight. And in one-sixth gravity, even though it's easy enough to get up and down, you were bulky, you were still heavy, and the suit was cumbersome. That's why you're going to see a lot of this 'Going to take a rest for a minute.' You just got physically tired. At the end of the day, particularly that first day, we were really tired.
1203516||CDR|The drill stem was sticking out of the ground maybe eight or ten inches or so. Here on Earth, I could take that third stem and stand above the one in the ground, put those locking thread down in it, twist it, and get it locked. But on the Moon, with the stiffness of the suit and the lack of dexterity, if you got it slightly misaligned, the threads would cross, even thought they were big threads. We'd thought about all sorts of things so we wouldn't get them crossed; but it still got wedged. So you had to get down, probably on two knees, so that you could get your hands right down there where the action was and get that thing in and aligned. And then, after you were up, then you had to get the drill and put it on. All those things were physically taxing. The getting up, getting down, and the little intricate work you had to do with your hands.
1203804||LMP|I'd been doing 'instrument science' for several hours at this point, and I wasn't going to pass up a rock that size. It was my first chance to look at the detailed texture of a big rock and to get some idea of how much I was going to be able to see if, and when, we got a chance to do some geology. The ALSEP always did cut into the time for exploration and I spent an awful lot of my career as a troubleshooting astronaut trying to cut down the amount of time it would take people to deploy that thing. And, although we had some successes, as the ALSEPs got more complicated, the amount of time spent in deployment always seemed to grow.
1203804||LMP|Geophone Rock was probably ejected from Camelot but, even if it had been thrown into the valley from a long way off, it gave you a chance to see if there were any textures on scales larger than you could see in a hand specimen, changes in the character and structure of the rock over distances of more than a few inches. At Station 6, for example, examination of the big rocks there showed us some clear cases of intrusion by one breccia into another; and the chances of seeing something like that in a hand specimen are very small. Geophone Rock was also a chance to do some geology standing up. As soon as you had to bend down or squat down or lie down to see something, the physical stress became a distraction from your mental work.
1203804||LMP|As I recall, Geophone Rock was my first chance to convince myself that I could distinguish several of the minerals in these relatively coarse-grained basalts. In particular, I could see pyroxene and plagioclase, the plagioclase being most obvious because it gave white haloes around the micrometeorite impact craters - called 'zap pits' - on the rock surface. It was also my first chance to look at the patina which had been identified as a splatter covering of brown glass produced by those same impacts. Each zap would knock off patina right around the impact point, but would also add brown glass elsewhere, so, over a large rock surface, it was a steady-state process.
1204631||LMP|Either one of us could have taken the ALSEP photos, depending on who was ahead in the timeline. I can't remember why it was so onerous a job; but, apparently, neither one of us really wanted to do it.
1204631||CDR|We had done some cross-training on the deployment, but we specialized in certain things; like I in the drill, and Jack in the ALSEP deployment. But, because we trained together on them, I think I could have deployed the ALSEP, just like he could have handled the drill or even the Rover for that matter. I sort of got into the systems maybe a little bit more than he did, and he got in the ALSEP a little bit more than I did, but I wouldn't have had any problems, nor would he. It would have taken a little longer, maybe; but we could have gotten the job done.
1204631||LMP|As I remember it, we did a little bit of cross-training, but mostly for the case that one of the PLSSs wouldn't work and we had to do a one-man EVA. Actually, I don't know if they would have allowed a one-man EVA. NASA was pretty conservative by this time. As another example of that conservatism is that, if we had started planning early enough, we could have had consumables enough to stay on the Moon for four days with some reserves. But they wouldn't let us plan for it. There would have been trade-offs. In order to meet the margins, you probably wouldn't have been able to take some of the equipment, but you could have done it.
1204906||LMP|On the camera focus, we had a number of detents that you could feel. They were calibrated for photogrammetric analysis but, in this case, I was assuming - correctly or incorrectly - that they didn't do photogrammetry with these pictures. A fifteen-foot focus of the ALSEP site sounds a little short to me now, but that's what I did.
1205217||CDR|It was a lot of hard work; and not at all easy.
1205338||LMP|The undisturbed regolith is well-packed and fairly dense, with a density of about, if I remember correctly, 1.9 grams per cubic centimeter. But, as soon as you start to stir it up, it loosens. So you can work things down into it, gradually, even though you don't sink into it when you walk on it.
1205400||CDR|I was only able to get it out an inch or two at a time. The core was eight or nine feet long, so I was pumping the jack for a long time. I'd jack the core up a little bit and then I'd have to get the jaws back on the core tube with the other hand so that they wouldn't slip when I jacked again. I can still remember doing this, right down on my knees. It was a lot of hard work, as you can tell by the way I'm breathing and by the way I'm talking. My one-sixth-gravity weight was holding me down enough to give me leverage, but it was still difficult because it required all forearm work and finger dexterity work.
1205437||LMP|The guys in the Control Room were as deeply involved in the exploration as anybody and had a lot to do to make it possible. Sometimes, although not very often, they just couldn't come to a decision fast enough. It was tough to do. You've got two guys hopping around on the Moon making their own decisions and, to make a recommendation about which film pack to use, you've got to talk to the people who can give you an informed answer; and that takes time. The way that people worked in and with the Control Room is an important part of the story. We knew that these conversations were going on back in Houston because we'd been in the control room or the science support room on other missions; but, of course, we couldn't hear - and wouldn't have had time to hear - what was going on.
1205528||LMP|It's amazing to see Gene get right down on his haunches in this sequence, almost with his backside on his heels. There's no way I could have done that; I just couldn't bend my suit that much. Maybe Gene could because he is tall, because he's got longer legs.
1205549||LMP|We had the treadle-and-jack because of the trouble Dave Scott and Jim Irwin had in pulling the Apollo 15 core out by hand. But, at least on our mission, it looks as though it took up just as much time and energy. I was offering to put in a shift at the jack but, thank God, he refused it. I don't think I could have done as well as he was doing; he could get down to it.
1205730||CDR|I'm almost getting tired just from listening to this. I'm going back to those moments; and the comments and the sound of my voice really show how tired I was and how hard it was to get that thing out.
1205756||CDR|The suits were very integral machines. We had arm bearings and elbow joints and wrist joints in the Apollo suits. But we have yet to be able to devise a suit where you incorporate everything from the fingers, to the fists, to the hand, to the wrists, to the elbow, to the shoulder in one motion. Unencumbered by a suit, we can move our arms in any direction using a combination of simultaneous joint movements. To reach for something on a desk behind you, you twist in your chair, turn your head, and move most of the joints in your shoulder and your arm; and you do all those things at once. In a suit you can eventually position your arm or your hand almost any way you want but you're limited to maybe two movements at a time. You can't just incorporate a rotation, an extension, and an arm-bearing movement all at one time. You have to do one or two of those actions, and then do the others. I hate to say it, but it was almost like being a robot sometimes. God made the human machine and we have not been able to make a mechanical device which will incorporate all those movements at the same time
1210024||LMP|I was trying to get all of my weight on the handle, just to get it to move. Gene was just heavier and could get it to go.
1210053||LMP|I was putting every bit of weight and momentum into it that I could.
1210111||CDR|This part - where Jack spins around and falls ass-over teakettle - was the funniest thing in the world.
1210645||LMP|A higher percentage of plagioclase indicates a higher proportion of silica, calcium, and aluminum in the lava. We were looking at relatively coarse-grained rocks formed from an extrusive lava flow and the higher proportion of plagioclase suggests that the flow might have differentiated, with the plagioclase-rich crystals having floated up toward the top of the flow.
1210923||CDR|I used the drill as a cane so that I didn't have to get all the way down on my knees. Without it, the only way you could get something off the ground was to get down on your knees because you couldn't bend over. But, if you had a short cane like the drill - the drill was probably 12 or 18 inches high - you could lean on it and then reach over with the other hand to pick things up. It's hard for people to understand the kind of problems you had getting up and down, reaching down to pick things up from the ground. On Earth, we take for granted our mobility and our motion capability. Plus we take for granted the full force of gravity. In lunar gravity, when you were leaning on the drill, you don't lose your balance as quickly as you would on Earth, so that was an advantage. But, when you're being held down by Earth gravity, you can handle a lot more torque than you can being held down by one-sixth gravity. It's those kinds of things that made this a difficult task. It was just very difficult to flex that stiff suit.
1211002||CDR|Remember, this was a disturbed surface, a very beat up area. There were footprints all over. And it was basically all one bland color. I had just drilled the hole a couple of inches in diameter, I'd gone four or five feet away, had come back, and then had to find the hole. If I hadn't left something close to the hole, so I'd know where to look, it probably would have been very difficult to find. You were looking across the entrance to that hole, and you were still looking at the same color in the wall of the hole. The low Sun would give you a shadow close to the top, but you wouldn't have seen that unless you were almost on top of the hole. And I'd drilled the hole in a hummocky crater, a little depression, that had some slopes on it. So, I was afraid of going back and not finding that hole to put the experiment into.
1211002||LMP|I'm still amazed that, after everything we did around that hole, that it was still open and that Gene was able to find it. The ground had really gotten chewed up and, by all rights, the hole should have fallen in, at least near the surface.
1211119||LMP|An alignment of elongated minerals such as plagioclase or pyroxene is called a lineation, and generally indicates that there has been a flow or some stress in the direction of alignment. The term 'foliation' is usually reserved for a situation where the orientation of tabular minerals creates a planar variation in the rock. A 'parting' indicates how the rock breaks, usually along foliation planes.
1211310||LMP|In molten rock, vesicles usually start out being roughly spherical in shape but, once the rock has solidified, if it stays warm for long enough, there will be a tendency for crystals to grow and destroy the smoothly spherical outline. If the rock cools slowly enough, the vesicles would start to look like 'vugs', with the crystals growing right into the void.
1211527||LMP|As I remember, Captain Marvel, the comic book hero, was a handicapped newspaper boy who, when he said 'Shazam', turned into Captain Marvel.
1211605||CDR|It was a lot of hard work; and it was very satisfying to get it done.
1211605||LMP|The @alsjurl/tools/judy83.jpg"@alsjt>sample bags</a> were reasonably clear Teflon, with a little metal double-spring that held the lip open a little bit. They also had tabs on either end, and what you could do was push against those tabs to open it up even more, get your sample in it, and then pull them closed and then twist the tabs down. It wasn't a vacuum seal but it wasn't a bad mechanical seal to keep the sample from falling out.
1212400||CDR|Maybe we were 30 minutes late, but at least we got the job done and we got it done right. I think that was the feeling we had. A feeling of satisfaction. That's what we went up there to do during that period of time and we did it. It was a lot of work, probably more work than people anticipated because we ran into problems in getting the core out, but we got it all done.
1212400||LMP|I was not quite so satisfied as Gene was at this point because of the time we were losing for exploration. The difference was natural. Gene was very pleased with having gotten the ALSEP properly deployed, while I was concerned that we hadn't spent much time yet learning about the Moon.
1212745||CDR|The cover gloves had fingers that were cut out, rather like a golf glove. They went over the regular glove and covered the palms. Because of all of the drilling and such, we just wanted to put a little more protection on our regular gloves. We were only going to use them for the first EVA, because that's where all the manual labor was; the rest was all traverse work. You've seen how hard we worked with those things up to this point; and they were just ripped up and torn up and really battered. Most of the damage was a result of abrasion.
1213003||LMP|Usually we wouldn't have noticed a handover. The one we did notice came right at lift-off from the Moon when they didn't get the handover done right away and we got a lot of static on the comm. They could hear us but we couldn't hear them.
1213219||LMP|With my camera off, I could get close enough to Gene to attach the SCB easily. With the camera sticking out a foot or so, you had to work at arm's length.
1213337||LMP|Part of this business about talking more loudly to Houston may be psychological distance; but I also notice that, when I'm describing something to them, I get more of an authoritarian tone. Certainly, when we were talking with each other, it was more buddy to buddy and we wouldn't have been thinking about anybody being a long way away.
1213605||LMP|We had worked hard, and our fingers, our hands, and our arms were very tired. But it was still fun. And, without the aches in our arms and hands, it would have been even more fun.
1213613||LMP|All this singing that I was doing illustrates that it was possible to run in the suit without expending a lot of effort. By using what can be described as a cross-country-skiing stride, I was keeping changes in the suit volume to a minimum. I was moving my legs back and forth, but that was about it.
1214420||LMP|There were times when NASA would talk about us having trouble getting back to the LM; and that was ludicrous. We would always know where the LM was in a valley with as many distinctive features as this one had. And, of course, you could always follow your tracks back. So the safety aspects of Rover navigation were always exaggerated. The Nav system may have been included originally in the Rover design for safety reasons; but, once we had it, its prime usefulness was clearly in position location, in finding our way from the LM to the various geology stations.
1214450||LMP|It may have been that there were different frequencies for transmissions to Earth through the LM and the Rover low-gain transmitter. But, whatever the details, the decision as to which to use was Houston's; we had no control or influence over that, except for pointing the low-gain antenna.
1214543||LMP|I never liked the term 'subfloor'. It was something that had come out of the US Geological Survey, from the lunar mapping people, and it had always seemed contrived.
1214606||LMP|I wasn't actually looking at rocks at this point because, as I remember, there weren't any at the SEP site much over fist size. This was just a chance, while I was working on the SEP, for me to regurgitate some observations I'd made up to this point. When I said that 'We may not be down to the subfloor', I think I meant that I hadn't seen anything yet that wasn't recycled regolith.
1214627||CDR|The Rover just didn't move very fast. It wasn't made to go very fast, but it could sure save a lot of energy. You could pack a lot of gear and save a lot of walking time, and it allowed us to cover territory and ground we never would have covered otherwise. I think probably we averaged 8-12 kilometers (per hour), and I think we hit a speed record of 14-15 kilometers coming downhill. It had four electric motors, one on each wheel for redundancy, and we would run with all four motors all the time. We didn't necessarily use both fore and aft steering all the time, but we always ran all four motors and 8-12 kilometers was about as fast as it could go. Your sensation of speed is probably what you would get down here. It didn't seem like you were moving very fast, and you really weren't. But you were moving, and it was nice to just sit back there and relax as you went from one place to another, as slow as it might seem. We weren't on a 400 mile trip, so it didn't matter how fast it was.
1214627||CDR|Of course, it could still be very sporty driving. When you start getting one wheel in a crater, or you hit a bump, or you start driving on the side of a hill, you really do appreciate the one-sixth gravity. If you hit a bump, you'd go u-u-u-u-p and come down. It wouldn't just be bing-bang, up and down. And on the side of a hill, you would start thinking that the Rover was just going to tip over and fall over on you. You didn't feel like there's much holding you to the surface at all. It was good, sporty driving; just not very fast.
1214627||CDR|The Rover had great maneuverability, particularly with the fore and aft steering - articulated steering, I guess it is. You could really maneuver it, really turn very sharp. You couldn't go real fast, but you could go. There is some film of John Young where he was kicking up dust and you'd think he was going 50 mph. He probably was going 10-12 kilometers at the most. On the lunar surface, it's a sporty little ride. It was fun.
1214627||CDR|I don't know how fast you would really want to go up there, quite frankly. You can't see what's up ahead of you too well. You know, you're driving along and it's so bland. With the shadows the way they are, especially if you're looking into the Sun, you just can't see much. You can't see where those holes are; you can't see what's ahead of you, and the next thing you know, wow, you're in a hole or you're up. You'll see us reacting to the little craters throughout here as we drive the Rover.
1214627||LMP|I'm quite certain that, even at 10 kilometers per hour, there were times when we had all four wheels off the ground. That really made it sporty. And the worst direction to drive in, I thought, was away from the Sun, because you had a 'white out' situation. The lack of shadows made it hard even to see boulders. But, the glare off your visors did make up-Sun difficult.
1214730||CDR|The needle width was at least a couple of degrees, so there was a little hesitation here as I decided what figure to give.
1214825||LMP|During training, Bob liked to use the term 'bomb' and, here, I'm trying to get him to change it.
1215044||CDR|Best way to get in was to face out from the Rover, sit in the seat, get down, and then kick your feet up and then throw them around. Here, Jack probably faced front, then tried to get one leg up and then another leg up. By starting out facing out from the Rover, you also cut down on the amount of dust you scattered on things.
1215044||LMP|What I ended up doing most of the time was standing at the side of the Rover, facing front, and jumping, more or less straight up and over toward the seat; and then rotated my feet up and forward so that I came down in the seat.
1215210||CDR|When you're riding and not expending a lot of energy, it's a lot easier to look around and really see what's there.
1215220||CDR|We probably ran smack into a small crater - or maybe a boulder - that we couldn't see facing east and looking right into the Sun. And when I said, 'got it, got it' I meant I had the situation under control. Running into little craters or over little rocks wasn't critical; it was just that we didn't want to run into something big enough to matter. Here, we probably went down in a little crater and came back up. We did that a lot; but we got a little more excited here because this is our first real ride together on this thing. The burst of static probably indicates that I made a turn to try to avoid the crater and lost the low-gain lock.
1215220||CDR|There are three things that I remember most about the Rover ride. Number one, when you were driving east into the Sun, it was almost impossible to see things ahead of you. When you were driving cross-Sun you had much better visibility and depth perception because of the shadows; and even driving down-Sun you could certainly see the boulders. Second was the fact that you often couldn't see small craters and they were important in the same way that potholes are to you when you're driving down the highway. The difference is that, in one-sixth gravity, when you do hit a boulder or you do drop one wheel in a small crater, you literally lift the Rover off the ground. I mean, you were literally driving on three wheels a good part of the time. It wasn't a choppy, sports-car feel, driving down the highway going bang-bang, bang. It was more of a waltz. Boom, and you go u-u-up and come down. Hit another one; u-u-up and come down. And, of course, not only did the Rover bounce but so did we. So it was a very good thing that we had snug seatbelts. Without them, we could easily have bounced out of the seats. And, lastly, the reduced gravity was particularly noticeable when you were driving on the side of a hill. I remember many times when we were driving on the side of a hill and Jack commenting that we were going to roll over. And indeed, because you have less gravity holding you down on the Moon, that was not a false perception; it was fact. You had to be careful on the side of a hill, because if you hit a bump with an uphill wheel, you could lift the thing off the ground and possibly become unstable and tip over. Of course, the situation was more obvious if you were in the downhill seat and I tried to keep Jack on the downside. It was much more comfortable on the uphill side; and that's a commander's prerogative when he's driving the Rover.
1215220||CDR|Those were the three things that were most noticeable; and I don't know that it would have been advantageous to have had a Rover that could have gone any faster. You needed to be careful in driving and probably couldn't have used the additional capability. When we set a speed record of somewhere around 14 or 15 km/hr coming down a hill, we were really hauling the metal; we were really tearing. And, not being able to see all that well ahead, I don't think we would have wanted to come down much faster. Of course, we were traveling over uncharted terrain; and, if we'd been at an established lunar base with a yellow stripe down the middle of a 'paved' surface - or, at least, if we'd been on a surveyed path with no boulders or potholes in the way - then we could have driven comfortably at a lot higher speed. But if we'd hit a boulder at 10 km/hr and smashed the hell out of the front end of the Rover, we'd have been out of business. We could have gotten back to the LM, but we wouldn't have gotten the job done that we'd gone to the Moon to do.
1215306||CDR|Pointing the antenna was easy enough when you were parked, but the indicator was really useful when you were driving, particularly when you were driving with the Earth behind you or well off to the side.
1215326||LMP|With that charge in my hands, I'm not sure I could have reached for anything. And I think the reason my voice is sounding so subdued in this section is that my forearms are starting to get tired and I am mostly concentrating on not dropping the charge.
1215406||CDR|The helmet didn't turn; so you didn't have a good view. To see to the side, you had to turn your head inside the helmet; but because of the visors, that only gave you a little bit of a view to the side. The only other choice was to turn your body and, because the suit was so stiff, that was very difficult. Consequently, you didn't have a lot of peripheral vision.
1215421||CDR|I can remember playing in the simulator and going down and flying around the valley. It wasn't the same picture you got when you're were sitting in the Rover 2-3 feet above the surface. It was like taking an airplane at a couple hundred feet and flying around the different parts of the valley just to get a feel for what it looked like. I don't recall that that helped very much because when you're in a Rover, you're just really down among them; you're down in this rolling, hummocky terrain. It was different.
1220119||CDR|This is another reference to simulations where we used the L&amp;A to fly the LM around our landing site to see what these places looked like from maybe 50 or 100 feet above the surface. But there were obvious differences. In the simulator you didn't have the Sun problem and you couldn't get right down on the surface like you could in the Rover. From 50 or 100 feet in the air, things look grossly different and that's what I'm referring to here.
1221109||CDR|You just had to get yourself in a stable position to be able to swing the hammer. Because of the restriction of the suit, there was basically only one pendulum plane in which you could swing the hammer; so you had to find a way to stand so that you could swing in that plane and be close to your work. You had some freedom to reach out a little farther, and some ability to rotate your wrist and swing more to the right or left, but not a lot. Generally, it was important to position correctly in three dimensions so that you could hit the spot you wanted and hit it with authority. And even then, you'd swing and just hit in the general area; it would have been really hard to hit a nail on the head.
1221109||LMP|Although I had a lot to do with the design of the hammer, the handle was too big around for me. I couldn't grip it, and that was one of the reasons why Gene was the one who carried and usually used it. I had convinced myself that I would generally do better with the scoop. Also, Gene could put a lot more force into the hammer. He could grip it, and he also had longer arms. The thing it took Gene a long time to learn was that you don't hit rocks in the middle to break them. You hit them on the edges and pieces break off much more quickly. By the time we got to the Moon, he was pretty good at it. But I remember that, early on in training, he would go after a rock right in the middle of it.
1221205||CDR|You had to hold onto the hammer and that meant you had to squeeze your finger against the pressure in the gloves. After you did that for a while, your hand and your forearm muscle would get sore. So you'd have to take a rest; not because your shoulder was sore or you were out of breath, but because of your hand and forearm. We were in pretty good shape at the time; we did a lot of training that exercised our forearms before we started; but gripping was still very tiring.
1221253||CDR|Because of all of the stuff in front of you - your PLSS controls, your camera, your sample bags - it took a concerted effort to see exactly what you were stepping on. Like everything else you did on the Moon, you had to plan ahead a little bit. Here, it was just difficult to get up that little incline and I had to take a lot of little choppy steps. That gave me better balance than trying to take a big leap.
1221333||LMP|Both pyroxene and ilmenite are dark minerals because of their iron and magnesium content.
1221338||CDR|Early in training, we learned from working together that when the other guy is wrapping up a sample, you should turn your back and lean over so that he can drop the sample in the SCB. If you just walk away to do something else, he's left standing there with his hands full. The reason you have to lean over is mostly because the suit makes it difficult to reach up very high. Now, Jack isn't the tallest guy in the world, but the suit made it even harder for him. You just can't get your hand much above your shoulder unless you rotate your body to the side.
1221338||LMP|Once we got into operational training, we'd wear backpacks with SCBs even when we weren't wearing suits; and it quickly became second nature, a part of the routine, to turn and bend over so the guy wrapping the sample could put it in your bag.
1221526||LMP|There was a long-standing interest in the possibility of getting samples of permanently-shadowed soil so that the solar-wind chemists could look at material that hadn't been directly exposed for some period of time. I don't know if anything ever came of it, but we talked about it a lot over the years.
1221641||CDR|You learned how to maneuver; you learned how to walk; you learned how to bend over to help each other; you eventually learned how to swing the hammer better; you learned how to pick up soil samples. You learned how to make your movements more efficient and productive.
1221656||LMP|A block is a rock of almost any size, as long as its big enough that it clearly doesn't fall into the general size range of particles in the underlying regolith
1221827||CDR|Without the suit, I probably would have reached out with my left hand to brace myself on the rock, but that would have put me too close to the rock to hit it properly in the suit. So I used the scoop for support.
1221906||LMP|Note the value of geological field experience!
1222233||LMP|I was just telling Gene to bootleg another sample. If he picked one up out of the area he'd just photographed, then Houston could probably identify it.
1222503||CDR|It was even awkward to get the gnomon down on a level piece of ground. You didn't want to drop it from a foot or two up, so you had to bend one knee, get the other leg out to the side, and lean sideways, very much like you sometimes had to in order to use the hammer. It was another one of ways you learned how to do things easily and with stability. You didn't really think about it; you knew when you were unstable and when you weren't, and you learned how to react. It's a normal reaction to a new environment.
1222506||LMP|Filleting is a natural consequence of the continual gardening of the upper regolith layers by the impacts of small meteors. Any boulder that's exposed will have material thrown against it that will collect at the base. The original thoughts about the 'dark mantle' material was that it had been put down very late, that it was very young; and that it might have been filleting the boulders. Of course, the truth is that the regolith and the dark material were intimately mixed. The dark mantling proved to be the result of pyroclastic materials - which had been laid down on top of the valley-filling lavas - being mixed with the regolith as the regolith formed. At Shorty Crater (EVA-2), we found black and orange pyroclastics which had been protected by a late lava flow until the Shorty impact dug it up; but, in most places, the pyroclastics probably had been deposited after the lavas had ceased to invade the valley. What we saw at Shorty may have been the result of the sort of thing that happens on Earth when, after the gas that has been powering the pyroclastic eruption is depleted, you have a lava flow. At @alsjurl/alsj_sunsetcrtr.jpg"@alsjt>Sunset Crater</a> near Flagstaff, the last thing that happened, except for a little bit of ash, was the @alsjurl/alsj_bonito.jpg"@alsjt>Bonito (Lava) Flow</a>. At Taurus-Littrow, the last of the lava flows may well have been the one that covered the pyroclastic deposit that the Shorty impact uncovered.
1222525||LMP|As with any of the other sampling procedures, you took a set of pre-sampling documentation photographs and then drug the rake basket through the regolith until you had a reasonable number of small fragments. Studies of samples from some of the early missions has suggested that, in the walnut-sized fragment population, you got more fragments from outside the immediate area than in any other size range. So the rake was designed to maximize the yield of these 'exotics'.
1223721||LMP|The basic use of the photographs was supposed to have been the location of observations, although nobody's ever done very much of that analysis. I think, also, that these traverse photos were added as a response to the problem that the Apollo 16 (means 15) crew had in knowing where they were, at least on their first traverse. And, finally, if you weren't doing anything else but riding, you might as well take pictures and get more information and documentation. There was plenty of film. And some of that information proved to be very useful. The pictures I took when we were driving on the avalanche during the second EVA helped confirm my observation that there weren't many boulders on the surface, as you would expect if it had been a gas-lubricated avalanche.
1223900||CDR|In looking at some of the pictures that Jack took on the way back to the LM, it's really obvious how difficult it was to know where you were in that three-dimensional environment. You could get up on high spots and orient yourself; and you always knew where you were in the valley - where you were in the 'big picture' - and where you were in relation to the LM. But the Rover Nav system really allowed you to go where you wanted to go fairly precisely. Getting back to the LM would have been easy enough without the Nav system. You could follow the Rover tracks back and, if that wasn't the most direct route, you could still get close enough to see the LM. There certainly weren't many things you could mistake for the LM. It was the only thing around that really reflected sunlight; it was also pretty big (23 feet or 7 meters tall) and would have been hard to miss. But in finding a particular crater when, as I say, you were 'down among them', the Nav system really helped.
1223909||LMP|The glass-bottomed craters generally had a glass-lined central pit, a shelf surrounding that, and then the rim.
1224100||CDR|The further away things were, the harder it was to judge size and distance. Things always looked closer and smaller than they really were. After a while you began to recalibrate your brain, but it was always deceptive.
1224412||LMP|By itself, the bedrock isn't dark enough to give you the dark mantle; and, if you grind it up, it's going to get even lighter in color.
1224504||LMP|Although I didn't know it at the time, I was beginning to see the fingerprints of the black, devitrified equivalent of the orange soil that we found at Shorty Crater.
1224708||CDR|When you drop a rock, it's like you've dropped a fresh fish in batter; the dust clings and the rock gets really coated.
1224744||CDR|When you were zig-zagging, if you weren't careful, the back end of the Rover could lose traction and swing around.
1224812||CDR|We didn't go back to get the piece that fell off. But at the end of EVA-3, I broke off the other three fenders and brought those back to Earth along with the replacement fender that we made when we got back in the LM. Two of the fenders are on display at the Visitor's Center at the Johnson Space Center here in Houston, and the replacement fender is at the Smithsonian in Washington.
1224913||CDR|We came up with this during training; the Rover heading indicator let us get a very accurate layout.
1225633||CDR|The dust on the battery covers and everything else was thick enough to write in. With a working fender you'd always got a light film of dust; but this was 'dirt' dust.
1225713||LMP|There was a great deal of fine material in the regolith and, as it turned out, much of that was due to the orange and black pyroclastic glass which was present throughout the dark mantle. Just from the appearance of the area in the overhead photographs, we had anticipated that there would be pyroclastics and, here, I was carrying that anticipation a little bit farther.
1230250||CDR|The TV camera was mounted about chest high (about 45 inches), so it's hard to say if that has any effect on your impression. Maybe it's just difficult to get a perspective on the surface. You don't have anything familiar to help you get a reference. For example, if you've got a little rise in front of you, it can be hard to tell that the ground drops away beyond it. You see a hill, you see a massif; but you don't have anything like a road disappearing to tell you that there's a drop off in between. You don't have trees to show you the slopes. You can't tell where a local horizon ends, except for where it makes a line on something in the distance and, on the Moon, there aren't a lot of times when those lines are obvious. It's just difficult.
1230420||LMP|The Principle Investigator must have loved this statement. The picture was supposed to document the way you left things, not the way they were before you made some final adjustments.
1230559||LMP|I remember thinking that it was a piece of foam and that Gene was pulling a joke on the scientists by putting it in a sample bag. So I was going along with the joke, not realizing that he was serious in thinking it was a piece of brown glass.
1230801||LMP|There were some wires on the back of the solar panels which hadn't straightened out but, rather, were causing the panels to flop forward.
1230836||CDR|I could tear the tape with my hands. For some reason, this is one of the things I still remember clearly after nearly twenty years.
1231124||LMP|What I think I was trying to say here is that, when I was taking something off the SEP, it lifted the box off the ground.
1231307||LMP|I put my hands on the boulder and just leaned on it. That let me get my eyes about a foot or a foot and a half from the rock so that I could look at the minerals.
1231307||CDR|Without the scoop or something else to give you leverage, you could still get up from your knees using a 'stand-up kip'. Here, Jack pushed back off the rock to get his PLSS over his knees and then jumped up and kicked his feet forward. It's all center-of-gravity management. And, since you're in one-sixth gravity, you can push yourself up easy enough and sometimes jump to get weight off your feet so you can bring them under you. It would have been a lot harder to do that in one g.
1232649||LMP|Although we still called it the ALSEP in the checklists, this was really a new piece of equipment which, among other things, had a two-year design life rather than the one-year life of the prior units.
1233723||LMP|Poor Gene. It was just like when you're doing windows and somebody taps from the other side to point out you missed something.
1233947||LMP|I couldn't get a grip on the rock to get it out, and I needed to have Gene hold the bag still.
1234238||CDR|The longer you work in that suit, the less feeling and dexterity you have in your hands. Your hands try to relax and you tend to drop things. And, if you drop things, they get dusty. If you drop things, you've got to get down and pick them up.
1234531||LMP|You're hands were tired, so it was hard to hold on to the brush; and, in the suit, you couldn't position the brush any old which way you wanted. So you had to keep moving your body to get in position. It was a mess.
1234831||LMP|The dust issue is one that just has to be addressed. It's going to be the major environmental issue for future missions on both the Moon and Mars. Mars is going to have a different type of dust; but in both cases it's going to require careful thought to design suits that can handle 100 or 200 or 300 EVAs compared with the three that we did.
1234958||LMP|Little did we know!
1235404||CDR|We practiced dusting each other in training, but never with any dust or dirt; we just went through the motions.
1235557||LMP|I don't think I'd actually loaded anything on the pallet. Gene just wanted to make sure nothing had fallen out.
1235609||LMP|Gene must have put his visor up so he could see to dust me while we were standing in the LM shadow at the ladder; and then he stepped out into the sunlight.
1235812||LMP|This a quote from one of Bill Mauldin's more famous World War II @alsjurl/a17/willie.jpg"@alsjt>cartoons</a> in the 'Up Front' collection. Willie and Joe are down in the mud with bullets going over them and that's the caption.
1235843||CDR|We could get about 30 seconds of one-sixth gravity flying in the KC-135 aircraft. That was too short for a lot of things and it had been a problem way back in @alsjurl/alsj-GeminiSumConf.html"@alsjt>Gemini</a>. Training underwater was not totally realistic either, but at least it gave you a lot longer duration.
1235843||LMP|We practiced getting in a hatch simulator in the KC-135 but that wasn't a static environment and I think it made it easier. There was just a little bit of motion and I think that helped you get through the hatch. And, of course, our hands weren't tired in the 135 and that also made a significant difference.
1240200||LMP|We used the lanyard to raise and lower the ETB because it had delicate equipment in it, particularly the cameras. It wasn't a rigid bag and, while I don't remember how or when the decision was made, I think we decided that, rather, than sling the ETB around, we'd just hoist it up.
1240251||CDR|Getting up the ladder was a piece of cake. You pushed up with your legs - just a little spring up - and pulled with your arms.
1240344||CDR|Even with the hatch open, he couldn't have worked kneeling, because he would have had to have his legs toward the hatch and it would have been hard to reach back and pull things in around his body.
1240344||LMP|As Gene handed the stuff in, I probably put it back on the engine cover, although I may have stowed the SRC right away. There were special compartments for each of the SRCs and the SCBs but we may not have stowed those until after we were repressurized.
1240405||CDR|Once the deep core was finished it really was a turning point. While we were deploying the ALSEP, we had a fixed set of tasks to do; and removing that core was probably the hardest of them. But after it was finished, then we could settle back into an exploratory mode of operations with a lot more control and choice about what we did.
1240422||LMP|From my point of view, the big turning point of the mission didn't come until we'd finished the second EVA. From an operational point of view, which was Gene's perspective, getting the core extracted and the rest of the ALSEP deployed was a major accomplishment; drilling those holes and extracting the core was tough work. But I was frustrated that we were still in the position that, if we had to leave the Moon before we had done another EVA, we wouldn't have had much information about the site. We'd gotten the heat flow experiment deployed so we were going to get confirmation of the Apollo 15 measurement. We had a few samples of the basalt, but had done no systematic sampling. We had the soil in the core, so we probably would have found the black beads; but there's not a lot of orange soil in that valley - it's mostly black - so we might not have had enough orange beads in the core to recognize it's importance. We had put out two seismic charges which, by themselves wouldn't have given us much. We had a few gravimeter readings but no profile across the valley and not enough information to understand the depth of the basalt fill. And, although we didn't know it at this point, the major experiment on the ALSEP, the long-period gravimeter (LSG), wasn't going to work. So, at the end of the first EVA, we were in the scientifically vulnerable position of having gone all the way to the Moon without having gotten very much out of the mission relative to what the potential was. By the time we finished the second EVA, we had a lot of information about the site and, from a scientific point of view, that was the big turning point of the mission. By the end of the second EVA, we had at least half a gravity profile because we'd gone across one contact up onto the South Massif; we had several more seismic charges deployed; and we had done a lot of systematic sampling of the mare basalts, the massif breccias, and the soils.
1240656||CDR|By this time, I was really tired and it was a lot of trouble to get back in the cabin. It's such a small space; and you've got to twist and turn to get in there. You've got to crawl in with that big PLSS on your back until you hit the back bulkhead with your helmet. Then you've got to start arching your back so that you can get your head up so that you can get further in. But you've got to keep the PLSS clear of the DSKY, so that means really arching your back. Then you push with your feet until you're in and you can stand up and then turn around. And it didn't help that a lot of space, particularly on the engine cover, was taken up by the boxes and bags we'd brought in from the surface. It was really crowded.
1240736||LMP|While you were arching your back, trying to keep your PLSS from hitting the DSKY, you really had to be careful not to scratch your visor on the back bulkhead any more than absolutely necessary. Gene may have had more trouble getting in than I did, simply because he is a longer person, even though, for the same reason, he didn't have as much trouble getting his back arched. Certainly he was tired - we both were - and it was only prudent for me to help him. You didn't want to bang that DSKY any more than you absolutely had to.
1240849||CDR|With two guys standing there, relatively immobile and wearing PLSSs, there wasn't a lot of room to bend over to look at the hatch opening for things that might keep you from getting a good seal. So you leaned back to get a look at it. It was important to get a good seal the first time, because otherwise you'd have to go through the whole procedure again.
1240849||LMP|You would probably blow the hatch seal clean if you depressed again, but you certainly didn't want to lose all that pressurization oxygen.
1241059||CDR|To get the hatch closed and latched, you had to lean forward and sideways and close it by feel. The instrument panel stuck out about a foot into the cabin and you just couldn't see under it while you were closing the hatch. Then, once I got back up, I could lean back and see it was closed, and as Jack could, too. All of this was necessary because we were really constrained by weight; the LM had to be as lightweight as possible and we couldn't afford a lot of volume in the spacecraft. If we'd had more room and a little bigger hatch, all of this would have been a lot easier and have gone a lot faster.
1241423||CDR|Your hands just get so tired and sore, both from the work of squeezing your gloves around things all day and from the constant chafing. I wound up with blisters all over my hands, particularly between the thumb and the forefinger.
1241620||LMP|I had been aware from the experience of previous crews that you could get rough or damaged finger tips and that your fingernails could lift right off the quick as a result of constantly reaching in the suit and getting a little bit of grabbing from the rubber bladder. Knowing that, I wore some nylon liners and also kept my fingernails clipped down as far as possible to delay the process. But, ultimately, all my nails were lifted off the quick and I can remember seeing blood under Gene's fingernails. There was nothing much else you could do about it; it was just a continuous, traumatic soreness which faded into the background.
1241643||LMP|Other than the times when I was talking to Gene or when Bob had asked a specific question, I don't think I was talking to anyone so much as I was dictating - particularly about the geology, providing a verbal set of field notes that I realized that I or others would be using. So I'm surprised that, even under those circumstances, we had a subconscious avoidance of profanity. Gene would occasionally use his "Manischewitz" as a substitute and I used "Oh, shoot" here and probably used other things on occasion. And I think it was characteristic of each of the crews. They all pretty much avoided profanity except on Apollo 16 when they accidentally had their mikes keyed when they were talking about the orange juice and on Apollo 10 when they had that startling experience with the jets firing when they weren't expected to.
1242000||CDR|I ran out late in the EVA, so it wasn't a problem.
1242626||CDR|We wanted to get all of the housekeeping chores out of the way as soon as we could. Charging the PLSSs let us get them stowed - on the walls, I think - so that we'd have more room.
1261114||CDR|The sensors itched, and it was just generally irritating to have them on. We had learned to put them on ourselves, so that we could take them off when we could.
1261224||LMP|My guess is that you did an initial charge and then let things stabilize - let the oxygen cool or the tank relax - and then you topped it off.
1261739||CDR|It was just an unacceptable situation. Imagine, a little thing like knocking a Rover fender off having the potential of compromising the rest of our mission. I still have no doubt that we had to find a fix. If we hadn't, then at bare minimum it probably would have taken thirty to forty percent of our time to consciously keep the dust off of the Rover, the tools, and the rest of the equipment. We wouldn't have been able to drive as fast, we would have had to spend a lot more time dusting.
1261739||CDR|I was concerned in the sense that I knew that we had to find a fix; but I was also confident that we'd find one. I knew that the ground was going to be working on a fix, but I was also responsible for the mission on our end and I was going to think about the problem, too. I'm the guy on the scene; I'm the guy who's got to actually fix the fender. The help we got from the ground was tremendous. They knew exactly what we had in the LM and were able to try out things during the night. But they were a quarter million miles away and I was going to have to do the fixing. So I spent some time, including while I was lying in the @alsjurl/a12/a12.hammocks.jpg"@alsjt>hammock</a>, thinking the problem through.
1261739||CDR|Before the mission, probably no one could have believed that losing a fender could have been that serious. But, if that had been an unmanned vehicle, dependent on the radiator for cooling and a clean TV lens for scientific exploration, you might have been out of business. Of course, maybe you could say that if we hadn't been there, it wouldn't have gotten knocked off; but even an unmanned vehicle can lose a fender by going too close to a rock or something.
1261739||LMP|As I recall, my perspective on the fender was that it wasn't a big deal; primarily because I had worked those kind of problems between EVAs on other missions. As Gene implies here, there are an infinite number of things that you can do to fix a problem; and that was the tradition of the whole ground support effort. You've got a problem? You go work on it and you fix it. And, so, I wasn't going to worry about it. I never imagined that they weren't going to come up with a solution. The only thing that bothered me - and I do remember thinking about this - was that the fix was going to eat up time out of the second EVA. As you may have noticed, Gene talked about the fender frequently but I never even responded to him, being busy with other things. So, obviously, it wasn't a big concern in my mind.
1261915||LMP|This was just a bit of small talk between two people who grew up in small towns, two people who carried on a lot of small talk.
1262006||LMP|The second charge procedure probably came out of people trying to push as much time into an EVA as possible for the J-missions. Probably somebody did a little experiment and realized that they could get another half-hour's worth or something like that. The whole J-mission or Block 2 effort was to extend capabilities over what had been possible on Apollo 11 and the other H-missions. Apollo 15 had originally been scheduled as an H-mission and Scott worked very hard to fly a Block 2 LM.
1262124||CDR|Listening to these conversations (that) we had once we were back in the LM, out of the suits, and relaxed is kind of a nostalgic experience. For me, it's really, really interesting to listen to this and it really brings back a lot of things that passed by so fast at the time. This is the first chance I've had in almost twenty years to go back and think about the details of some of these things, despite the fact that I see Joe Allen and Bob Parker maybe two or three times a month.
1262705||CDR|One of the things I was expecting to hear myself comment on was the fact that any time you traveled east - particularly on that first day when the Sun was so low - you just couldn't see very well and just had to go slower.
1263530||CDR|Because of the low Sun on that first day - and it was a lot better on the second and third days - it wasn't at all easy to look at the Sculptured Hills and see any detail. They were about 20 or 30 degrees north of east and the glare was just too strong.
1263613||LMP|Somebody at the USGS - or maybe it was Jim Head - noticed that, in contrast to some of the other hills, they had a knobby appearance and said 'Hey, they look like somebody sculptured them'. So they became the Sculptured Hills.
1263840||LMP|The instrumentation identified the signals from each of the geophones by number and, in order to interpret the data, the experimenters had to know where I had deployed each one of them.
1264215||LMP|Angular boulders have profiles such that you can draw two lines from any point on the rock and the rock will fill the space between them. Subangular is the case where the tip has been rounded off and the rock won't fit between the lines. And "rounded" is the case where you can't draw any fit better than tangents.
1264716||LMP|I was asking them to think about the situation of a fine-grained pyroclastic laid down on the subfloor. What sort of regolith would develop in that situation and what would you expect to find? Obviously I was thinking about it, and I wanted the bright guys on the ground to think about it, too. We eventually proved at Shorty that this is what had happened, but we hadn't been there yet and I was asking what might be unique about a regolith developed on a pyroclastic versus a regolith developed on a basalt flow. I don't think I ever got an answer to the question.
1265943||LMP|Joe was just taking a dig at me. I had not clipped the 'one'. He was just sticking one in.
1271155||CDR|We were probably eating through this thirty-minute period and I remember that it was almost a relief not to have to talk to the ground or answer questions.
1271155||LMP|I was hoping they would ask more questions during this eat period. It was an opportunity to chat about the geology. I was tired, but I thought it was a waste of time not to talk. We were on 'push-to-talk' so I don't know what Gene and I were talking about at this point. Probably just the mechanics of eating: 'Do you want this? Or, do you want that?' It was all cold; you couldn't put hot water in it.
1274352||LMP|Battery management meant that you were going to check out all the LM batteries and see if they had the right voltages. And, I think, if you found that some had drawn down more than others, you would equalize them.
1274605||LMP|P00 was the housekeeping program that allowed the ground to communicate with the computer to not only check out the computer to see how it was doing but also load data.
1274721||LMP|After I took my helmet off after the first EVA, I had a significant reaction to the dust; my turbinates ('cartilaginous plates in the walls of the nasal chambers') became swollen. And that went away by the next morning - except for a little bit of residual - and never came back again. Nobody's ever explained that to me.
1274812||LMP|Before the quarantines were lifted, there were a lot of people in the Lunar Receiving Lab exposed to lunar dust when they shouldn't have been. I'm afraid that the geologists didn't really believe in the quarantines and they honored them only in the breech for the most part.
1275302||CDR|We still had to set up the @alsjurl/LM10f1-6.jpg"@alsjt>hammocks</a>. Our suits were probably already in the back of the cabin, hooked up to hoses to dry out; and there were always a few things to shuffle around: get our foodstuffs stowed, clean the visors, look at the rocks and pack them away, and so on. We were busy almost all the time.
1280459||CDR|The Liquid Cooled Garment was really important to help keep you cool so that you wouldn't sweat too much. Back in Gemini we had nothing but air cooling; and, during my Gemini IX EVA, the humidity in the suit got to be 100% and I got my helmet all fogged up. The LCG made it a totally different ball game. You still perspired and you had to make sure you drank enough water that you didn't become dehydrated; but you didn't have to worry about overheating and fogging up.
1280804||LMP|This was another alternative to consider for the dark mantle, another hypothesis to work on. Because there were more mafic minerals in the basalt than we originally thought, you might have had a darker impact glass develop and, so, you had to continue to consider the possibility that the dark mantle was a dark regolith derived from basalt with a high concentration of iron/titanium minerals in it. In a sense, because the glass beads we found at Shorty were dark because they were rich in iron and titanium, this hypothesis is also a step closer to the truth.
1281353||LMP|Through the years, Joe and I would occasionally pun together. Still do.
1281523||CDR|We'd had a long first day, something like 20 hours. This was PDI (Powered Descent Initiation) and Landing day and the whole thing. And you have to realize that, to me, sleeping on the Moon is the greatest waste of time a human being can conceive. I mean, you go all the way to the Moon; you go a quarter of a million miles to spend three days on the Moon and you sleep through one of them. But you had to sleep; we were just so tired that first night that we didn't have any choice but sleep or, at least, try to get some rest. I can remember just laying there with my eyes closed and thinking, "Hey, I'm on the Moon. Why am I wasting my time trying to sleep or rest?" And yet you'd worked so hard that biologically you just had to get some rest. There had been some discussion of a sleep period before the first EVA, but we decided it wasn't very useful to do that. You'd have to take your suit off, and the next day you'd put it on, and you'd just waste more time. We knew this was going to be a long day, but we had prepared for it. Sure, it was exhausting to some degree because it was a long day, a 20-hour day, and physically demanding. Getting the backpacks on, getting out, getting the Rover deployed, setting out all the experiments: those were all physically very demanding tasks. So we were tired when we finally got into the rest period and I slept fairly well. I'd get some sleep, dozing off. Then I'd open my eyes for a while and then doze off for another hour. It was certainly acceptable rest.
1281523||LMP|It's interesting that Gene felt that sleep was a waste of time, because there was really no alternative. On Apollo 12, in particular, we found that when the crew tried to sleep in the suits, the continued discomfort - even depressurized - meant they got very little rest. They basically got out for EVA-2 as tired as they had been when they'd gotten in the LM the night before.
1281523||LMP|I never felt that sleep was a waste of time. After the rest period, during which I got about five hours of sleep, I felt well rested and was ready to go again. I can't agree that sleeping was a waste of time, for the simple reason that we couldn't have performed well without it. Even with adequate rest, we were working so hard that, for example, I had a real emotional down time at Station 3, and it took the discovery of the orange soil to rejuvenate me. However, there had never been any question in my mind about trying to sleep the first day in between the landing and the first EVA. That just didn't make much psychological sense, even though it made for a long day. And besides the psychological advantage of getting right out, it also gave us a chance to get the ALSEP deployed and a few samples collected in case something happened that would force us to leave early.
1281523||LMP|I slept much better on the lunar surface than I did in orbit. One-sixth gravity is a very pleasant sleeping environment with just enough pressure on your back in those hammocks to feel like you're on something but not enough to ever get uncomfortable. I slept but my impression was that I only needed about five hours sleep to feel rested whereas ordinarily on Earth at that time I usually felt that I could use seven. But I think that's related mainly to the lower gravity environment. You just don't get physically as fatigued as you would on Earth. You get as fatigued mentally - obviously you're working just as hard with your neurons - but physically you don't work as hard.
1365755||LMP|I wore the ear-piece every night because I was closer to the panel. The usable volume of the cabin is T-shaped. My @alsjurl/a12/a12.hammocks.jpg"@alsjt>hammock</a> was stretched across the front, and Gene was stretched out toward the back, over the engine cover, with the suits under him.
1370032||LMP|We were very careful to keep things stowed in the place to which they were assigned. We had many storage training sessions. During the mission, I would have known where everything was stowed but, now, I can't remember anything except that there were a lot of soft fabric bags in the back portion of the usable volume of the ascent stage, along the walls as I recall. Actually, I take it back. I don't think they were soft; there were some soft containers, but I think they all had aluminum latch covers on them. But anyway, we had a place for everything and we made sure it went back into that place. Otherwise, it would have been chaotic. We tried not to have a lot of stuff out at one time.
1370032||CDR|Because of weight restrictions, I don't think we had aluminum covers on all of the storage compartments and, rather, a lot of our stowage areas had net coverings on them. Although we were going to be on the Moon for three days, we always had to keep things well stowed in case we had an emergency lift-off.
1370830||CDR|I'm pretty sure that, while we slept, we each kept our PRDs in a pocket in our LCG and then, when we got suited, we'd put it in a pocket in the suit itself.
1370924||CDR|The PADs were pre-printed forms at appropriate places in the flight plan with labeled boxes where you would write things like these updated lift-off times.
1371203||CMP|is using less oxygen, water, maneuvering fuel, etc. than planned
1371229||CDR|People sometimes ask if I worried about getting home. Well, you're sitting there inside an oil can and you've already bitten the bullet. If something's going to happen there's nothing you can do about it. So why worry about getting back until the end of the three days when it's going to count.
1371620||LMP|There was a tendency to be dehydrated and also a tendency not to be either thirsty or hungry - at least in the first few days - so I made a point to force myself to drink and eat. More so than I think either Gene or Ron. Gene didn't eat much the first few days. And neither did Ron.
1371620||CDR|I lost weight on all three of my missions: thirteen pounds on Gemini IX, eight on Apollo 10, and eleven on Apollo 17. (Evans and Schmitt each lost about five pounds during the mission.) Food was a necessity more than an enjoyment. You just didn't get hungry, the food wasn't that great, and you just didn't eat as much as you normally would. I don't remember whether I ate a lot or not; but, having flown before, I was certainly very aware of the need to continually drink as much water as we could.
1371758||LMP|Some of these accidental keys may have been caused by pushing the talk button out of habit.
1371955||LMP|John Young was involved in this not only because he was the backup Commander but also because he had broken a fender on his Rover on Apollo 16 and knew how important the problem was. Without the fender, you get a forward rooster tail and you end up driving into your own dust.
1372011||LMP|We had maps to cover the whole area in case we ended up with an 'off nominal' landing, as NASA would say, and had to run traverses different from the ones we planned. So there were a bunch of spare maps and that's what they decided to have us tape together to form the replacement fender.
1372227||CDR|We had a couple of auxiliary lights which were little spotlights with clamps on the back that you could fasten anywhere: on a circuit breaker panel, on a rod. They were very useful, and I think we even brought the clamps back in with us after the third EVA to make sure we had them. They were called the AOT lamp clamps because, most of the time, we had them clamped to the bars on the cage surrounding the sextant or Alignment Optical Telescope. As the cabin pictures show, the AOT was between us at about head height, on the front bulkhead between the windows.
1372410||LMP|The guide rails were about as thick as a pencil and you could use them as something to clamp this new fender on so that it wouldn't move.
1372426||LMP|Gene has a naturally strong grip. He has very big hands and that's what John's referring to.
1372820||LMP|As I recall, I think I was just standing there, admiring the ingenuity of the support crew. The guys on the ground had gone out and thought about everything we had in the spacecraft, looked at the inventory, and then, as a team, tried to figure out what in the world we could do to solve the problem using what we had. I don't remember ever even thinking about a solution once they said the previous night that they were going to work on it. I figured they would work something out.
1372827||LMP|Terry Neal was a member of our support team. A real young guy. I introduced him to his wife - something to do with a blind date I couldn't make and he was the substitute and eventually married the girl. He was one of the ones responsible for storage of equipment in the LM and for generating the lunar surface operations plans and stuff like that.
1373056||LMP|Gene was more worried about this than I was. We knew where we were close enough for all of our planned EVA activities, so I quit worrying about where he actually landed.
1373056||CDR|Whether or not you're interested in where you landed is a difference between a pilot and a geologist. For me, as a pilot, I wanted to know exactly where we landed, mostly as a matter of pride. For Jack, what mattered was that we'd landed in a geologist's paradise and, no matter where we were exactly, we couldn't lose.
1373451||LMP|I was always interested in the news, particularly about Truman. He had gone into the hospital while we were on the way out; and I guess he died on the way back.
1374035||CDR|Things like this little weather report still seem unbelievable. It's amazing to think that somebody was actually up there on the Moon, looking back at Earth and telling people in Houston about their weather. And it was me that was doing it. Unbelievable!
1374054||CDR|I was very conscious of the rotation of the Earth while we were on the Moon. If you gave yourself enough time, you could watch it rotate. It didn't have any strings holding it up; it didn't have any fulcrum like a globe spinning on your desk; but you could watch it rotate hour after hour. You could slowly watch certain continents disappear; and you'd realize that you were looking at something new and strange, and yet familiar. Even though so much of it was cloud- or snow-covered, you could still pick out enough of where the blues were to know where the continents were and therefore detect a shape, with the naked eye, from the Moon. And you'd realize that new continents were coming into view. You couldn't sit there and watch it; that would have been like watching water boil. But, literally, over a period of hours - say the eight hours between when we got out of the spacecraft and when we got back in - the Earth rotated a third of the way around.
1374509||LMP|The Lunar Surface Gravimeter (LSG) was a very-long-period seismometer which was basically a gravimeter. The Principle Investigator was Professor (Joseph) Weber at the University of Maryland, and its basic purpose was to monitor the free oscillation frequencies of the Moon, hoping that, when a gravity wave went past, it would excite both the Moon and the Earth simultaneously, and therein would lie proof of the existence of gravity waves. If it had worked and if they had indeed seen a gravity wave go by, it clearly would have been a Nobel Prize class experiment - probably the only one that ever flew on Apollo in that weird environment of Nobel Prizes. Unfortunately, if I remember correctly, the balance beam had a one-tenth-gram error in its design - right from the very beginning. And you might ask why wasn't it tested. And the answer is that it wasn't tested - to see if it would uncage in one-sixth gravity - because the subcontractor had claimed that such a test would reveal some kind of proprietary information about their gravimeter. And NASA let them get away with that! I heard about that when we did our last deployment of the flight hardware down in a big hanger in the Air Force launch area near the Kennedy Space Center; and I pushed them after that deployment to do a test - which you clearly could do, just by tilting the gravimeter, and making sure it would uncage - and they insisted that they didn't need to do that. And I didn't push it and I should have; I blame myself more than anybody. Then, when we got to the Moon and I leveled it and did everything I was supposed to, it didn't uncage properly; and, as we go through EVA-2 and, I think, even EVA-3, I will keep going back there to try things they'd thought of to make it uncage. They didn't figure out until much later - post-mission - that a design error was what was wrong. They kept saying that there was something wrong with the deployment. My gut tells me it used up two hours of EVA time.
1374639||LMP|I got my mouth in motion before my mind. It's not good grammar; but it's the way we talked.
1375149||LMP|Anorthosite is a rock made up primarily of a calcium-aluminum silicate mineral called anorthite, a kind of feldspar. The sixty-kilometer-thick crust of the Moon appears to be largely anorthosite with olivine and pyroxene mixed up with it; and most of the light-colored places of the Moon that you see from Earth are this crust exposed. Although the outcrops on the Massifs look like anorthosites from the LM, it turns out that, after we looked at the rocks that had rolled down, these blue-gray rocks were blue-gray breccias. They were rocks composed of fragments of other rocks, some of those fragments being anorthosite. We weren't expecting to see whole anorthosites on the Massifs because the Massif rocks were almost certainly (shocked) material which had been thrown out of the Serenitatis Basin, so we weren't quite sure what we would see: big breccias or big chunks of anorthosite. It might have been either. The important observation from the LM was that the exposed rocks on the Massif looked fairly distinctly blue-gray and, later on when we got over there, indeed, the rocks were blue-gray. They were breccias but some of the chunks in them were anorthosite and others were dunite. Dunite is a rock composed largely of the mineral olivine, and one of those that we sampled was - and still is, I think - the oldest rock ever dated from the Moon at 4.6 billion, plus or minus 0.1 billion. And all of that happened over at Station 2 on this second EVA.
1375256||LMP|We started naming lunar features on Apollo 8. Bill Anders decided that it would be far easier to remember names than numbers or letters or anything like that, particularly for the pilots who were used to call signs. So I suggested that we start naming the craters on the Farside - the ones that didn't already have names - that were going to be useful in the navigation and landmark sighting exercises. And before we were through we had named an awful lot of craters - for people in the space program and God-knows what else. Some of them were rejected by the international commission (a nomenclature commission of the International Astronomical Union) that deals in naming features on other planets and some of them were ultimately accepted. Then I did the same thing for the Apollo 10 crew when they did their lunar orbit activities. And then all the crews started to get into it, and most of them did their own naming after that, I think. For our mission, I came up with most of the names for the landing site features and Gene added a few. Poppie and Punk were two of his. Again, the international commission accepted most of names we picked but, for example, the name 'Jefferson-Lincoln' Scarp was not accepted because of its 'political nature', and, I think, it is now called the J-L Scarp. On the other hand, the committee didn't understand the political nature of some of the other names and accepted them: Victory Crater is shaped somewhat like a letter 'V' and was named for @alsjurl/a17/a17.site.html#victory">Churchill</a>; and Camelot was named for John Kennedy.
1375324||LMP|The prep-and-post card was Velcroed to the panel in front of us so that we could use it when we really couldn't use the checklists. You get to a certain point when you're pressurized in the suit where you really can't fumble with the book, so you just read a summary on the card.
1380116||LMP|We probably spent thousands of hours in the @alsjurl/tnD7112Simulators.html"@alsjt>LM simulators</a>.
1380116||LMP|Full-up simulations were relatively rare - only a few per mission - but we went through the critical phases over and over again. Depending on how complex each phase was, we would adjust the amount of time we spent. Also, if the console people felt we needed more time, they would recommend it. Even though we didn't run through the EVA preps and cabin configuration checks quite as much as some other phases of the mission, through the years I did an awful lot of them because, before I was assigned to a crew, I would check LM stowage for other crews. These were called Crew Compartment Fit and Function checks - 'C-squared/F-squared' or even 'CF-squared'. Mostly these were done with the LM or a mock-up fully configured, but there were times when some of the hardware simply didn't appear until fairly late and we would be using non-flight mock-ups or non-flight hardware as a substitute. Early on, the crews tried to force everybody to use flight hardware near the end, just to make sure that they never flew with anything they hadn't seen and which hadn't been fitted into the spacecraft and exercised in the ways that they would use it. In the early days the crews had been bitten by things that suddenly appeared and wouldn't work. That's where the whole concept of a C-squared, F-squared came about, I think.
1380116||LMP|Grumman would do a C-squared/F-squared before they shipped a flight LM and I often went up to do those. Fred Haise and I did several together. He and I were good friends and he would ask me to come up and do them with him. Some were done in shirtsleeve and some were done in the suits. And then we did vacuum chamber checks where we put the lunar module in a pressure chamber at Houston or the Cape. That was a major test, and both flight crews, Prime and Backup, would do those. The exception might have been Apollo 17 where John Young and Charlie Duke had just come off of Apollo 16. As I recall, they opted not to do those sorts of things.
1381103||LMP|This probably means that each purge valve was optimized to a particular suit flow system, and they wanted to be sure that we each had the right one. We had taken the valves out at the end of the first EVA, and part of the EVA-2 prep was to put them back in.
1381754||LMP|Camelot is about 600 meters in diameter, which means that it probably penetrated to about 150 meters depth. Because the regolith wasn't going to be more than a few meters deep in most places, Camelot was sure to have dug deep into the subfloor material. As I recall, we saw the boulders as we drove by on our way to Station 2 and that, later on, then influenced the actual choice of the Station 5 location. They hadn't anticipated that we would see boulders when we drove by Camelot because there hadn't been any evident in the pre-mission photos, only some variations in brightness which suggested that we would find boulders on the southeast rim.
1382006||CDR|All of this came from the Backroom, where the scientists and geologists had looked over our first EVA. It seems as though they could have shortened what they read up to us, but it was like getting a debriefing from them. And we were eating and doing other things and it didn't hurt to listen. And it gave us an idea of their thinking, which was important.
1382006||LMP|What Bob was probably reading was a piece of paper that the science room sent in. @alsjurl/lee_silver.html"@alsjt>Lee Silver</a> or Gordon Swann or Bill Muhlberger put together something that was then severely edited. This discussion is another illustration of the literal universal importance of superposition in a gravity field. Most of what we do as geologists on Earth is look for evidence of superposition or cross-cutting relationships. And here we're talking about the same thing on the Moon. Their thinking was almost entirely about 'how do we find out what units lie on top of what other units'. That is superposition. I think that what had been surprising was that we had seen no evidence of the dark mantle. It had been so obvious in the pre-mission photographs - particularly in Lunar Orbiter and Apollo 15 photography of the site and even in photographs taken from Earth - that everybody thought that when we stepped out that we would be stepping onto the dark mantle and it would be obvious that it was dark mantle. Well, it wasn't obvious that there was dark mantle there. So, now, they were thinking about the observations we made the day before and they were trying to come to grips with what we saw - the regolith and this intermediate gabbro - and they were trying to summarize their hypotheses. As I've mentioned, the dark mantle question was not really answered until we got to Shorty and put the core tube down into the orange soil. When we pulled it up, the lower 50 centimeters or so of the 70-centimeter tube were dark - (almost) black. And right then it appeared that maybe that - whatever that black soil was - was a contributor to the dark mantle. And later on, it turned out to be devitrified orange soil - glassy, pyroclastic debris, volcanic material that is liquid when it is erupted and which hardened and/or crystallized as it fell back to the surface, a process similar to fire-fountaining that we see in Hawaii. Throughout the region, there was enough of this pyroclastic debris mixed in the regolith to give it - from a distance at least - the appearance of a dark mantle. And, in reality, it is a dark mantle! It has just been mixed up so much with ground-up subfloor material that there wasn't much of it left that you could see as a unit. The dark mantle isn't localized in Taurus-Littrow but is found all along the east, southeast, and southern rim of Serenitatis where there are a lot of grabens and graben faulting along which you apparently had volcanic eruptions of this material. And then as you get into the south and southwest portion of Serenitatis, it changes to large area-deposits of orange and red glass, similar to the orange pyroclastic material we saw at Shorty. The large areas of orange were noticed by Ron after I saw the orange soil in the valley of Taurus-Littrow; and then I spent a lot of time defining it and checking it out once I got back into orbit.
1382326||CDR|We almost never had time to just listen to somebody talking; we were always busy. We ate, we cleaned visors, we put on the biomed stuff. We didn't always have to tell Houston exactly what we were doing; they knew that from the checklists. We were always, always busy in that cockpit.
1382608||LMP|I don't think it was anything more than the way things worked out. As I recall, we didn't sit around and establish that protocol. But it seemed to work pretty well.
1382608||CDR|Jack might have spent more time than I did on the EVA planning, but we were all involved. I involved myself mostly in the operational side - where we could go, what we could do - and left the geological side to the people who knew a lot more about it than I did. During planning and training, the CapComs worked with us as though they were going to make the traverses themselves.
1382626||CDR|Although we were all exposed to these geologic terms and trained pretty hard - particularly if you'd trained as part of a backup crew or a prime crew as I had on Apollo 10, 14, and 17 - you wouldn't find anyone but Jack who would make a statement that would include words like 'clinopyroxene gabbro with a fair amount of ilmenite'. Now, you'd find people who would know enough about what they were seeing to say 'there's bright, shiny flakes and dark minerals in the matrix; but the precision is going to come from somebody like Jack who has used the terms all his professional life and who, therefore, uses them with a great deal of confidence. That's the advantage of having a geologist on the surface; in real time, Jack could give the people in the Backroom a much clearer picture of what he was seeing than the rest of us usually could.
1382709||LMP|I'm getting closer to the truth than they were with this statement. This is exactly what the little beads of glass happened to be. They had a very high titanium content and were dark because of it. A lucky call.
1382928||LMP|There was no active sensor to show you whether the PLSS was filled or not; there was just a little bulb that you looked at to see if bubbles were coming out as you filled it; and when the PLSS was full there should have been clear water in there.
1383048||CDR|My daughter Tracy was nine years old at the time of the flight and she was interviewed by Jim Hartz of NBC who was covering the flight for the Today Show. She was on for about ten minutes and I have a tape of it. She had been three at the time of my first flight (Gemini IX) and was much too young to understand what was going on. She was six for my second flight (Apollo 10) and has a few memories of it. But, for this one, she was old enough to be very involved. It's heartwarming to watch the tape; there she was and there we were on a TV monitor in the background, walking on the Moon.
1384037||CDR|John Covington was a member of the support team, a PLSS specialist. A good man; he's still at Johnson. All the people on the support team were invaluable: the suit techs, the guys who helped stow the LM, the guys who helped devise the procedures, the guys who helped us train on those procedures. You couldn't do a mission like this without them.
1385030||LMP|Any time we gave Houston the ability to read a subsystem or, in the case of the computers, to update the memory, we'd say 'it's yours'. It was a sort of gratuitous thing: 'through our generosity we have given you access; and just remember, we can cut you off.' And that was true. Ours was a manned spaceflight program. The fail safe was always to the man. Up until recently, Soviet program has been just the opposite. They relied primarily on the automatic system or on ground control and it cost them on several occasions, cost them some people.
1385030||CDR|A lot of people get fooled by the words 'Mission Control' and think that the ground controlled our spacecraft. Really, it was our 'management advisory office' back here on Earth. With telemetry they could read all kinds of information that we didn't have in the cockpit, largely because of weight constraints and the complexity of the spacecraft; but we were the ones who were flying the spacecraft. We had computers to do a lot of things for us, and we got a lot of information from the ground; but, ultimately, it was the crew that had to tell the spacecraft what to do. In the U.S, the battle for crew control of the spacecraft had been won in the early days of Mercury. Now, I could have put the spacecraft in a configuration where the computer could have done the landing, but it wouldn't have known if it was going to land on a rock or in a hole. And there's no pilot in the world who would have traveled a quarter million miles only to let a computer do the landing.
1385908||LMP|Thinking back to what's interesting about the old exploration reports, it's a lot of this stuff. It's the whole environment in which the exploration is taking place, all the distractions. The one thing that people forget is that the EVAs were not seven and a half hours. On either side of that was significant pressurized time. We were still in the suits before and after depress and repress and working in that suit was work.
1394500||CDR|In addition to giving us an emergency oxygen supply in case we'd lost integrity on one of the suits, the Oxygen Purge System also gave us another emergency capability. After the third EVA, we threw the PLSSs out of the LM but kept the OPSs so that, at rendezvous, in case we couldn't dock, we could use the OPSs to do an emergency transfer-EVA into the Command Module. We could plug the OPS in directly to the belly of the suit and stay pressurized for 30 minutes, long enough to get into the Command Module had we had a docking problem.
1395243||CDR|The lock was a simple one, rather like what you'd have on a front gate. You unlocked it by turning the handle through about ninety degrees.
1395243||LMP|We unlocked the hatch before pressurizing the suits because you couldn't really get at the lock mechanism in the pressurized suits. The hatch had enough surface area that it couldn't be opened if there were any appreciable pressure (more than about 0.2 psi) in the spacecraft, so there was no extra risk in unlocking it now. And then, once you were depressurized, all you had to do was pull the handle and open it. There was a valve in the hatch which we opened during depressurization and, if by some extraordinary circumstance, the hatch was fully closed and some gas were released, the cabin couldn't repressurize and seal the door.
1400426||CDR|The ground had copies of the cue cards and checklists that we were using and could follow along. When we told them where we were, they could tell exactly what we'd done up to that point and we wouldn't have to call out all the details. Some of the critical things we would verify with them; but in this fairly regimented part of the protocol - getting in the suits, getting the PLSSs on, and checking them out - we'd just let them know from time to time where we were.
1402145||CDR|It's a long, arduous, time-consuming, difficult, energy-consuming process getting ready to get out. You've got to get in the suits and get everything checked out. You're big and bulky and can't move around very well; just a couple of apes in there. I remember vividly what tough, physical labor it was to reach things. And it got even worse when you got pressurized. A difficult job, but absolutely necessary. You had to make sure that everything was on right and that everything was locked because that suit and that PLSS were your life-support system. It all would have been a lot easier if only we'd had a little more room. In the Shuttle they have a big airlock and it's a piece of cake; and, sometimes, I wonder how we got away with it, particularly in Gemini with that tiny, tiny cockpit. It was a tight fit with a pressurized suit and that chest pack; it's a wonder we didn't lose somebody.
1402235||LMP|The most significant physical discomfort we experienced was the fatigue in the forearm muscles that came from squeezing the glove against the pressure in the suit. It was like squeezing a tennis ball repetitively. And within a half hour or so, the forearm muscles were sufficiently fatigued to ache. And you reached a much lower productivity using your hands than when you started and then you stay at a constant level of whatever you can tolerate and still do the job and not drop things and still apply sufficient force to work, and that then went on for the rest of the EVA. However, after a night's rest and sleep, that soreness went away. There was no residual soreness. I think that's related to the lower gravity environment. Your heart and cardiovascular system are so much more efficient in removing the products of metabolism such as lactic acid that you never damage any muscle fiber. You fatigue it, but you don't damage it. And the important thing was that, with rest, it went away. It came back when you went out again and started work, but it wasn't compounded.
1402307||CDR|Once we'd been outside, there was always a lot of dust on the suits. You could just scrape the dust off with your hand. You couldn't help mixing at least a little dust in with the seal lubricant. It didn't give us any particular problem; but, unlike graphite, lunar dust is not a lubricant and probably caused some wear in the seals.
1402507||CDR|I think that most of the time I had to help Jack with his gloves. Partly, perhaps, because of the size of my hands and also because I'd put gloves on so many times going back to Gemini. It was pretty easy for me. Jack could get one on with the other hand bare; but it was tough for him to get the second glove on. So I usually helped him; it was part of the buddy system that was so important.
1402514||LMP|This was a band that we put on our arms, over the suit, I think for our watches.
1402547||LMP|The gauntlets went about halfway up the forearm, protecting the bearing areas of the gloves.
1402645||LMP|There was a cloth dust cover that protected the connection between the PLSS water hose and the suit.
1402744||LMP|The hose connections were over my stomach and, with the suit not yet pressurized, when Gene pushed in, he pushed against my stomach.
1402858||CDR|In the normal configuration, if the cabin had started depressurizing, the O2 regulators would have started pouring oxygen into the cabin to make up the difference. But, in the Egress configuration you were telling the regulators that you were depressurizing on purpose.
1403316||LMP|There were two valves we could use to dump the cabin oxygen for depressurization. There was one in the @alsjurl/forward_hatch.jpg"@alsjt>forward hatch</a>, but the one we used was overhead on the docking hatch and was easier to reach. And that wasn't closed until we came back in.
1403316||CDR|These were just little accordion valves, each with a small lever that we used to break the seal. Air pressure in the cabin was enough to keep them shut, but the surface area was small enough that you could open it easy enough with the lever. As Jack says, the overhead was just easier to get to in the pressurized suit. Here, he was probably standing facing away from me, so if he leaned toward me, his PLSS would be on my side of the cabin, and I was probably having to turn a little to get my right arm up and back to get at the valve.
1403504||CDR|I'm really stretching to reach back up to get the valve because now the suits are even harder than they were when I first opened the valve.
1403734||CDR|This was one of the reasons that it was a good idea not to leave things lying around in the cabin. Once the pressure got down low enough - 0.1 or 0.2 psi - you could lean down and use the handle to open the hatch. Then the rest of the air rushed out and anything lying around just zapped out the hatch with it.
1403743||LMP|Anything that wasn't tied down flew out. I don't remember any of the dust going out; it was down below the floor so it was a little harder for it to flow out.
1403745||CDR|The floor we stood on wasn't the pressure hull of the spacecraft but, rather, was a fitted floor made up of panels with cracks between them The dust got down in there and it was impossible to clean it out.
1403833||CDR|It took the suit regulator a while to get itself down to 3.85 psi and, until then, you were working with an extra stiff suit and there wasn't much point in trying to get down on your knees to get out.
1403849||LMP|The actual meaning of 'Roger' is 'Understood', but it tends to be used as a substitute for 'Affirmative'; most of the pilots tended to use 'Roger' wrong and this was just me, trying to get it right.
1404133||LMP|There was probably some kind of humorous picture that the support crew had inserted into the checklist at this point. Heaven knows what it was. I don't know where those checklists went. But the support crew kept sticking things in there, particularly Bob Parker. At the end of every section we could count on finding 'This is the end and not the beginning', because Gene had come up with a slogan for our mission 'This is the beginning and not the end' and Bob turned it around every chance he had. The typical weird humor of the Caltech graduate.
1404154||LMP|It was a lot easier using two hands going down the ladder. It wouldn't have hurt if you fell; or, I don't think it would have except it might have damaged the PLSS.
1404213||CDR|This was probably a hook on the lanyard that I was hooking onto the ETB or that I was using to attach the lanyard to the ladder. We learned on Gemini IX that, with the pressurized gloves and the lack of dexterity, we needed big things that we could get a hold on, not little things that you had to open with your finger tips. We learned a lot in the early days about the kind of equipment you needed to work with in the pressurized suits.
1404508||LMP|Getting out the second day was actually more exciting for me than the first was because it looked like we were actually going to have a chance to do something useful (laughing) rather than just deploy the ALSEP. I don't think getting out was an 'adrenaline pumping' type of excitement because your checklist kept you organized and moving from one thing to another. I think the real adrenaline was Launch, Translunar Injection, Lunar Orbit Insertion, Powered Descent Initiation, Landing, Lift-off from the Moon, and Trans-Earth Injection. Although, again, it's amazing how training and procedures suppress those kinds of things because everybody has things they have to do; and so you have to keep doing them. If you got into an adrenaline high you'd increase the chance of missing a step. Training is a great suppressor of adrenaline. It's like being prepared to take an exam in college. The more prepared you are, the less exciting it is.
1404508||CDR|I don't know that the adrenaline wasn't pumping the first time we got out on the surface. The second time I was a little more calm and collected, but there was still the realization that I was back out on the surface and that the first time around wasn't just a figment of my imagination. I agree with Jack that where the heart really started pounding and beating wasn't when you were crawling down the ladder. It was things like the landing. It wasn't like you were crawling down the ladder into a pit full of rattlesnakes. You were crawling down the ladder to do something you were looking forward to, something you knew you were going to enjoy, something that, within reason, you had control over. It wasn't one of those heart-pounding things, but it was still a little unbelievable that I was really there. The first day was almost literally like walking in a dream the whole time; the second day, you could look around and begin to appreciate a little more where you were and prepare to be a little more productive. Everything on the first EVA had been checkout, checkout, checkout, checkout. This time we had the Lunar Rover out, we had the ALSEP deployed, and we could begin enjoying ourselves.
1404702||CDR|Getting those antennas free was no easy task in the gloves.
1404859||LMP|Bob Parker and I had talked about getting a TV picture of a pendulum motion in one-sixth gravity. The lanyard was hanging down and so I just gave it a little push so that he could have his pendulum.
1405007||LMP|By putting the valve all the way up to full cold, you could very quickly feel a pulse of cold water in the Liquid Cooled Garment. This was done just to make sure the valve was working.
1405357||LMP|The LCRU batteries were stored in the MESA section of the descent stage, and we had to put in new ones for every EVA.
1405643||CDR|In listening to this part, I can still feel the frustration of trying to get that damn little LCRU battery out of a storage area in the MESA. The problems you want to deal with are the ones that are worth solving, not something little that's avoidable. Of course, the real world is always a little different than the training. The training is good because you can try to look at every possible aspect of what you're going to be doing. You anticipate problems, you get proficient, and you get productive; but you're always going to run into new and different situations and, when you do, it's the little, avoidable things that are frustrating. Like having to tie a shoelace that comes undone all the time. If you have the right shoelace to start with, you wouldn't have the problem. Same thing with these LCRU batteries: we had just started the damn EVA and all of a sudden I had to wrestle with a little battery that I should have been able to just pick up and put in place.
1405851||LMP|My shadow was the only long ruler that I regularly carried around with me. And, knowing that everybody underestimates distance on the Moon, I asked them to be ready to give me my shadow length so that I could see what it looked like and know what it really was. And it always looked a lot less long than it really was.
1410227||LMP|The first Apollo TV camera was just ludicrous. NASA just totally screwed up the specs in buying the thing and there was no excuse for it. Finally, we got a good, high resolution camera for 15, 16, and 17. Actually, Tom Stafford flew it on 10. But the so-called Apollo Television Camera that flew on Apollo 11 was terrible - low resolution, black-and-white. Just not any good at all. It couldn't take any kind of bright scene at all. On Apollo 8, we had to put every filter in the spacecraft in front of it just to take a picture of the Earth.
1410227||CDR|Getting color television on Apollo 10 was a personal crusade of Tom Stafford's. It was the first flight to carry color TV, and Tom had to lobby and push awfully, awfully hard to get it qualified and get it on board. It didn't make any difference who you were dealing with, every time you wanted to do something like that - whether it was for scientific purposes or whether it was for PR purposes - there was always an element that thought you were doing those kind of things from a self-promotional point of view. What I don't remember was why the color camera wasn't lunar surface qualified for the first three missions. Television, and particularly high definition color television let people understand what you were doing or seeing from a scientific point of view - or from an operational point of view or in terms of sharing the experience. Television had a major impact of the space program and we should have started using it a lot earlier. On Gemini 9, the ground had little or no idea what I was going through up there. If they had been able to see, they could have been a part of it; they could have helped. We might have solved some of the problems right then and there in real time.
1411354||CDR|It seemed like it was a lot longer than five minutes.
1411432||LMP|The empty bags were stowed in the MESA and you would think that an intelligent human being would be able to grab the right one.
1411459||LMP|Once the samples were in the SCBs, that's where they were going to stay until recovery. In that way, if they wanted a particular set of samples, they would know which bag to get. Some of the samples would be in the boxes (meaning the SRCs), but a lot of them just stay in the bags until they got to the Lunar Receiving Laboratory.
1411526||CDR|This is a good example of how I had to move my arm forward and then back to loosen the arm bearing and get some momentum so that I could reach the diverter valve. If you tried to just sneak back there slowly, it was hard to do. It was one of the little things you did to adapt to the suit and the environment.
1412034||CDR|I don't think we had nearly as many acronyms in the Navy as we had in NASA. NASA won the prize. The Navy used them for the names of commands, like 'ComNavAirPac' which means 'Commander, Naval Air-forces, Pacific'. But I tell you, going down to NASA meant learning a whole new language: an acronym for everything. And for the longer ones, like LCRU, you just turned them into words and said 'Lacru'. It's funny, but a lot of acronyms became so much a part of the NASA lingo that if you stopped somebody and ask them 'What does LCRU stand for?', they couldn't tell you. People would know which box the LCRU was and what it did, but they couldn't tell you what the letters stood for.
1412254||LMP|This was the 'Dixie cup' sampler which I must have just grabbed and carried out to the SEP site without telling anyone. It held a stack of Dixie-cup-like bags on a long handle; and when you filled one and pulled it off, another one was ready to use. Again, the bags each had a metal ring and you clamped it down and twisted it and stowed it. Each of the bags already had a number on it.
1412705||LMP|The intent here was to drive along the antenna on a constant heading so that the SEP experimenters could have a bit of calibration data that would have been easy to analyze - had the experiment been working. I don't know if it was still working at this point, and we certainly didn't know that until we got the data back to Earth. As I recall, they got a little bit of information on this EVA and, after that, it just got too hot.
1413500||LMP|The drive up to the Camelot rim was a very gradual climb, unlike Cone Crater on Apollo 14 which was a crater on a knoll. The LM was probably on the ejecta blanket of Camelot, so it would have been hard to judge a change in slope. Generally, the terrain here was much flatter than on either Apollo 14 or Apollo 16, which were the highland sites. The average (vertical) variation at our site was perhaps a meter or a meter and a half; and there's one picture of the LM, taken looking back into the Sun, and there is a little low ridge blocking out the lower part of the LM.
1413615||LMP|The seismic charges had an Apollo Standard Initiator (ASI), which was the @alsjurl/tnD7141ApPyrotchnc.html"@alsjt>pyrotechnic initiator</a> they used for everything - for any kind of explosive bolt initiation, for instance. It was hooked up to a radio receiver and, at 90 hours, the timer moved a metal window from between that initiator and the charge. For half an hour after the window opened, the ground could send a signal to set off the initiator and, therefore, the charge. And, if it hadn't gone off in the half hour, then the window would close again and that would be the end of it. All of them actually did go off but, if they hadn't, they would have been safe sitting up there when the people from the Smithsonian went to collect them sometime in the future.
1413623||CDR|Jack had to lean over to get the charge on the ground. Of course, we were riding low to the ground, but he had to reach to get the charge outside the fenders and sometimes he probably grabbed the antenna on the charge to set it down. Then, when we started up again, I had to be very careful not to run into the charge and knock it over. With the front-and-rear, Ackerman steering, if you turned left away from the charge, rather than the rear wheels dragging, the rear wheels were going to turn right and maybe hit the charge; so I'd turn right to avoid it.
1413923||LMP|In the pre-mission photos we could only see the very largest boulders and I don't think we could see any around Camelot. And we couldn't have seen any out that far from the LM.
1414029||CDR|I don't remember if 'two-blocked' is an old Navy term or what. But it means 'I've got it all the way out, hell bent for fire.'
1414036||LMP|We were driving down-Sun and that made craters hard to see despite the relatively level terrain.
1414036||CDR|One of the advantages of being the Commander and driving the Rover was that you knew when you were going to turn. It's just like what might happen if I took you on an airplane and did some acrobatics. I would know what I was doing and could anticipate the maneuvers, but you might start feeling uncomfortable, not being prepared, unless I really tried to talk you through everything.
1414253||CDR|Bob and Jack were always bantering back and forth, from training right on through the flight. Although it was all meant in fun and they both had a sort of subtle sense of humor, the interruptions did sometimes bother Jack, particularly when he had something he felt was important to say.
1414419||LMP|The light-colored areas on the rim of Camelot turned out to be that way because of reflections off of all of the rocky material, rather from an albedo difference of the soil. And it may be that the regolith on the west side was shallower for some reason, so that more blocks were dug out there.
1414510||LMP|The presence of vesicles usually imply that the rock solidified in the top of a lava flow where the cooling is quick enough to temporarily trap the gas that makes the vesicles. The inner parts of the flow don't cool that fast and the gas usually has a chance to escape. And what I was trying to do at Camelot was try to see how many flows the crater might have penetrated. Was there just one flow top, or several? I don't think we really had the time to do that, even when we got back to Camelot at the end of the EVA; but if you could get out and walk around, that's what you would try to do.
1414511||LMP|I was trying to estimate the largest size of crater that had formed everywhere on the surface. And that's roughly a function of age. Because bigger impactors are relatively rare, the older the surface, the larger the saturation crater size.
1414821||CDR|We didn't go down in any big craters; this was probably a shallow depression of some kind.
1414826||CDR|The reason the roll seemed like it was a lot was because, in one-sixth gravity, you're not anchored down the way you are in earth gravity.
1415222||LMP|It was a puzzle, seeing apparent lineations on the slopes of mountains. Some people, as I recall, did some simulations, building models, putting random roughness on the surface, and then dusting them and moving the light around, and they were able to create apparent lineations just with light position. Generally, I think, people don't feel that they represent any underlying structure: it's just an accident of dusting and lighting. The massifs do have layers in them - layers of debris - and I think the fact that you see what appear to be zones of blocks at the top is probably a layer of relatively hard material. But they really are gross layers.
1415222||CDR|While we were in orbit, we looked at the landing site as much as we could, partly to update our position and partly to get a feel for what it was going to be like. I wanted to get a map of it in my brain so that I'd know where we were going. Of course, the valley went by very quickly, so it wasn't like we had a chance to study it for five or ten minutes. And sometimes, if you weren't right on top of the fact of when it was coming up, it would be gone. You'd miss it. Things aren't instantaneously recognizable from orbit and you have to know when to start looking and what you're looking for.
1415339||LMP|Secondary craters, formed by ejecta from other lunar impacts, have a much lower energy and they tend to be more irregular, more elongate, and may have a blob of material in the bottom. The projectiles that form primary impacts hit at about 20 km/s, and that's an explosion. Most of the ejecta leaves the Moon entirely; very little of it falls back on the Moon. At most, the stuff that makes secondaries travels half way around the Moon and hits at 1.5 km/s and doesn't throw ejecta very far at all.
1415758||CDR|The low-gain was mounted in front of the control stick at my right hand. Most of the time I could drive and manipulate the low-gain at the same time, reaching across with my left hand to move it, probably not with the greatest of ease, but I do recall being able to do that. But, you know, if you got too many things going and you were making lots of turns you just couldn't sit there twisting that low-gain until you got to some reasonably steady course.
1420043||CDR|I don't know what we're going to run into next in the transcript, but I remember that when we drove onto the light mantle, although we talked about being able to see it from a distance, the albedo change was so subtle we really had to convince ourselves that we were there. It wasn't like suddenly going from dark to light, it was just fine-grained, subtle changes.
1420329||CDR|We wanted to know when we were up on the white mantle and we expected it was going to be a very subtle change. Here, we could see it coming; but I distinctly remember that it was very difficult to find a definitive line between the light and the dark mantle.
1420949||LMP|Formation of the massifs was part of a dynamic process; and the hard layers represented by the blocks near the crest are part of the evidence of that process. You had a relatively flat part of the Moon which was hit by a great big impact. It was virtually a point explosion, just like a nuclear explosion; and then, whatever was there was folded back. And, at least with the big, basin-forming impacts, you had a lot of molten material that formed in the instant cavity; and that stuff probably moved outward, too. Dynamic pressure forced the molten material to flow up and out of the cavity and on top of the rocks that form the Massifs. And since the top layers solidified out of partially molten material, that may be partially why they're harder. And then, subsequent to that - although you're still talking about the first few seconds or minutes after the Serenitatis impact - you get these radial grabens that form due to the dilation of the area that's been impacted. Parts of the rim of Serenitatis fell and formed what's called a graben, and the Valley of Taurus-Littrow is one of those radial grabens.
1421520||CDR|You couldn't spent very much time sightseeing, and that's why Jack's doing most of the descriptions. Every once in a while you could steal a glance but, if you didn't get right back to watching where you were going, you'd get in trouble...especially the little craters.
1421715||LMP|In principle, the term 'gabbro' has no genetic meaning but, rather, indicates a crystalline rock composed of roughly equal parts of the minerals pyroxene and plagioclase. However, here we were seeing rocks derived from lava flows that were thick enough that the rock cooled slowly enough that millimeter-sized crystals formed. They aren't very fine-grained like most basalts that cool very quickly, but neither are they as large-grained as the anorthosites found at Apollo 15 which cooled much, much more slowly, at depth within the crust. And, of course, these rocks weren't the breccias characteristic of highlands material.
1421744||CDR|We were concerned about what we were going to find at Hole-in-the-Wall and what path we were going to take to get up the Scarp. I don't remember exactly, but I'm sure we must have looked at the Scarp from orbit.
1422058||LMP|Because of the stiffness of the suits, our field-of-view was pretty much restricted to straight ahead. We could turn our heads a little in the suits and could gesture with our arms, but even then, Gene could really only see a gesture if I made it with my inboard arm.
1422110||LMP|Lara is almost certainly a crater that pre-dates the avalanche. The avalanche rode over it and, indeed, in the good photographs you can see some subflows (secondary slides) down the slopes into it.
1423005||CDR|As I recall, from orbit you really had to look for the tracks. If you could find one of the very big boulders you could trace the tracks on the slopes of the massifs. On the surface they were relatively easy to see from the LM. I don't think most of them jumped right out at you because there is so much subtlety. But, especially if you could find a boulder, you could see the tracks pretty readily.
1423337||LMP|The printing on the map is not mine and I don't specifically remember changing the name; but I wouldn't be surprised if I oscillated back and forth between Amundsen and Nansen. Amundsen gets so much credit, at least in the United States, that I may have decided that Nansen was the unsung hero of Arctic exploration. Or, somebody may have pointed out that Amundsen already has a crater at the Moon's South Pole.
1423549||LMP|Nansen isn't actually an impact crater but, rather, is an anomalously-deep, elongated depression that is part of the trough. It isn't filled as much as other parts of the trough. From the gravity measurements we know that, just before the mare lavas filled the valley, the difference in elevation from the valley floor to the tops of the South Massif may have been something of the order of four to five kilometers. That is, there appears to be now about two kilometers of mare basalt filling the valley. Originally the elevation difference was even more than four or five kilometers because there is strong evidence that the mountains have been subsiding over time, enough so that you never accumulate a talus at the base. The evidence of this is the trough that runs along the base of the massif. If you imagine a steeply dipping-fault between the South Massif and the original valley and the mountain subsiding relative to the valley, then the fault tends to open and either the talus tends to accumulate or you get a trough or both. Most people think that, once those mountains formed, they stayed relatively quiet; but the trough implies that there's been activity essentially up to the present. Otherwise, you would have filled up those troughs. Essentially, the gap is opening up as fast - or faster - than talus is accumulating, from a volume point of view. The average exposure age of the talus material is very low and does not correspond to the age of the mountain. The mountain formed 3.9 billion years ago and the exposure age of the soils in the trough is a few hundred thousand years.
1423639||CDR|I'm an engineer and I think the greatest asset that education gave me was the ability to think logically and, rather than getting engrossed in the detail of a problem, be able to back off and start to figure out where you are, what it's all about, and start to focus in on the important parts. Too many people try to put the screw in the hole before they find out it's the wrong screw for the hole. In looking at the valley from orbit, I started out looking at it geographically and then topographically; and then, when we got down in among 'em - among the rocks and boulder - I could start to look at it geologically. To start with, I wanted to be sure that when I got down in that valley I would always know where I was. When I was near Nansen, I wanted to be sure in my mind what was to the north and what was back to the east, even if I couldn't see very far in those directions from the ground. I wanted to have a feel for where I was; not from a navigation point of view but from a geographic point of view. And then I wanted to understand the topography, which you can't fully appreciate until you literally get down to the surface. From orbit, Tracy's Rock (at Station 6) doesn't mean anything; but, when you get down in there, you can appreciate the slopes and the sizes of the boulders and the craters. And then, once you have the big picture, you can get into the geology. Basically, I'm a pilot. I was also a well-trained geologic observer, but I wasn't a geologist and probably never would have been and never will be. So, being a pilot, I like to know where I am all the time; I like to know what my surroundings are; I like to know what environment I'm in; I like to be able to anticipate; I like to be able to prepare. When you're a flyer, the environment that surrounds you - if you will, the 'geography' - includes the weather and the traffic. Not just the mountains, but a lot of things. And on the Moon, if you have a feel for the geography and the topography, when you start rambling through this valley you're not going to be too surprised by what you find. You're going to anticipate - which is very important - and, in many cases, you're going to know what to expect. Now, when you get on the slopes, and you get among the boulders, and you pass over the rims of those craters, those are the things you can't see or feel from orbit. So the Moon does take on a new dimension at the surface; but, at least you've got this background, this feel for the environment that you got from orbit; and that helps you.
1423639||CDR|People ask all the time if I was ever scared; and my answer to that, without hesitation, is 'No.' Apprehensive? 'Yes.' But I was never scared. Because, to me, fear is what happens when you're confronted with the unknown. Now, it's not that we didn't have many surprises on our flights. But we were aware of where we were, of what we were doing, and of what the risks were. We had a broad knowledge of our own personal capabilities and had confidence in our abilities to handle the unknowns. We had a broad knowledge of the hardware we were flying and how to manipulate it around problems. Could the Saturn V have blown up on lift-off, could we have not had ignition on the lift-off from the Moon, could a suit have sprung a leak? Sure, all those things could have happened. But you don't sit and worry about them. If I tell you to walk through a door into a dark room and walk out a door on the other side without telling you whether there's bears, rattlesnakes, alligators, or bogeymen in that room, you're probably going to be scared. But if I say 'This room has a Grizzly Bear over in one corner' - and you're dedicated to getting to the other side - you're going to learn all about the life of a Grizzly Bear: when he eats, when he sleeps, what he does in the darkness. You're going to understand all those things and you're going to develop confidence in you're ability to deal with him. Now, a Grizzly Bear can act in an unusual way just as a spacecraft can; but, while you may be apprehensive as hell when you open that door, you won't be scared because you will have thought through all of the things that are likely to happen.
1423911||CDR|I think some mountains on Earth impress you as being taller than the Massifs. Up to the west of Calgary, the northern Rockies look very tall and impressive and they do rise up to 11 or 12,000 feet above sea level. But there, you're in a valley that is probably already at 6 or 7,000 feet and, so, the peaks are really only 4 or 5,000 feet above you. The Massifs, on the other hand, rise maybe 8,000 feet straight up from the valley floor. What was really impressive about the Massifs, however, was how massive they were; they were so massive they overpowered you. Visually, they weren't overly impressive; they didn't have the cliffs and abrupt breaks and snow-cover that you see in the Rockies; but they were massive, jumbo mountains. I use the word 'jumbo' because they weren't antagonistic-looking mountains; they weren't jagged; they weren't rugged; they were just jumbo in size. Mt. Rainier (4392 m) near Seattle gives you something of the same feeling. Not from Seattle, itself, because that's too far away, but maybe from twenty or thirty miles from the mountain. But Rainier is just one mountain and we were in a valley surrounded by jumbo mountains. On Earth, I've certainly never seen anything else like them.
1423955||CDR|We had lots of discussions about walkback and the rules that we came up with were generally compromises. If some of the real conservative people had had their way, we wouldn't have gone more than a mile from the LM; but we finally decided that we wouldn't consider a worst-case worst case of both the Rover and one of the PLSSs failing. Otherwise, there wouldn't have been much point in taking the Rover. If you didn't fight for what you thought was right, you'd go all the way to the Moon but be so limited in your capabilities that you couldn't get anything done because you were afraid of a failure. When you go all the way to the Moon, you've got to take some risks. It's like having a two-foot putt to win the Masters and then lagging it because you don't want to three-putt. You don't want to take unnecessary risks; but the Rover had four drive motors and two sets of batteries and the chance of both the Rover and one of the PLSSs failing was pretty small.
1424723||CDR|The only time we did any traverse training pressurized was at the Cape. The rest of our geology traverse training was done in street clothes. But we needed to get in the suit and actually work with core tubes and the other equipment, actually get down into the nuts-and-bolts of it and handle the drill, handle the core tubes, assemble the Rover, and work with the things that were going to give you difficulty in the pressurized suit. Some things, like working the locking mechanism on the extension handle weren't very difficult; but things like aligning core tube threads were much harder to do than they were in shirtsleeves. That kind of training was very, very valuable. So, in the later stages, we'd do pressurized training down at the Cape maybe once or twice a week for the last couple or three months. It wasn't something I'd particularly look forward to, because it was hard, hard work.
1424723||LMP|The failure of the lock was probably caused by the dust which, I'm sure, had worked it's way into the sockets by this time. By the third EVA, a lot of the sockets just weren't working: you either couldn't get them loose or couldn't get them connected because of the dust. Dust is going to be the environmental problem for future missions, both inside and outside habitats. And, unfortunately, although there's a lot of lip service paid to it, I don't detect a great deal of imaginative thinking about how you deal with the dust.
1424840||CDR|As I recall, when we went down into the trough it was like going down a hillside. It wasn't a deep trough, but it was enough to give you a close, local horizon that hid the rest of the valley.
1425046||LMP|During the pre-mission training, we spent a lot of time outside and pressurized, training for the EVAs down at the Cape in a simulated traverse area.
1425046||LMP|You couldn't work ten hours like we did on the Moon, but we would work for like four hours. And we wore ourselves out before somebody had the bright idea - and I hope it was me, but I don't remember - of hooking the liquid-cooled garment up to some ice water. I'm surprised we didn't kill somebody from heat stroke. It was just too much. We shouldn't have been doing it. We didn't have any significant cooling for a long time - just an inadequate liquid-air cooling system in the lightweight PLSSs - and, then, during training for some mission, probably 15, we decided to have somebody walk behind the pressurized astronaut with a backpack full of ice water, and a hose going into the suit attached to the liquid cooled garment. And, of course, that made all the difference in the world. I think that was my suggestion, but I can't be sure; so much of that stuff happened synergistically. But I was worried and I know I made a big point to a lot of people for a long time that you were going to hurt somebody, that they were just getting too hot, including me.
1425046||CDR|I don't think we had the ice-water cooling for the Apollo 14 EVA training; for me, that showed up on Apollo 17. Although Apollo 14 was a January launch and ours was a December launch, we trained all year long. It got hot down there at the Cape, and you worked hard. I never felt we were going to kill anybody; but the ice water did help. It made a big difference. It allowed you to work more efficiently and kept you from getting as hot and tired and irritable, and you got more out of training than you would have otherwise.
1425253||LMP|When I was estimating the percentage of fragments, (the 10 to 15 percent figure) was related only to fragments large enough that they seemed to jump out of the matrix, that were clearly of a larger size than the matrix components. My guess is that the minimum was of the order of a few millimeters in size and that the estimate was really biased toward the larger fragments of centimeter size and more.
1425343||LMP|When the small impacting particles that form the zap pits hit, if there's crystalline rock - particularly plagioclase - at the impact point, then the halos look white. And in this case I'm saying that, because the halos don't look white, the rocks are not coarsely crystalline on the scale of the zap pit.
1425452||LMP|Boulder 1 was very weakly indurated but had a lot of layers in it; it was pretty easy to sample because it wasn't as tough a breccia as some of the others were. Boulder 2 was up on the slope and was about head high. We got a series of four or five samples, I think, and, as we'll hear described, we got a soil sample from a permanently shadowed place underneath an overhang. Boulder 3 was the one in which we found the crystalline dunite, which turned out to be very old. After the mission, there was a scientific consortium, called the Consortium Indomitable, headed by John Wood of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory at Harvard, which published a suite of papers about Boulder 1.
1425500||LMP|The gnomon gave you the local vertical, a 40 centimeter scale, a shadow which gave you azimuth, and also had a gray scale and three international color references for photometric calibration. In principle, the shadow, if visible in both pictures of a stereopair, could be used to control azimuth for topographic analysis. The vertical scale of known length provided other control parameters. I am not sure anybody ever did such an analysis, given the way resources dried up after the Apollo program. I don't think anybody's ever used those photographs or the data contained in them for analysis. But we gathered it.
1425500||LMP|The gnomon is the residuum of an original concept @alsjurl/shoemaker.pdf"@alsjt>Gene Shoemaker</a> had for gathering data with a stereo camera mounted on something called a Geologic Staff; the camera would have been taking pictures continuously, with the orientation of each frame recorded automatically. (A mock-up can be seen in Apollo 14 training photo @alsjurl/a14/ap14-s70-46157.jpg"@alsjt>S70-46157</a>.) In fact, it started out as a video camera. Unfortunately, NASA never saw fit to fund that. They finally, belatedly, funded development of a stereo camera, but they were forced to do it through a small business contract. And, instead of it going to a company like Kodak which had already built a stereo camera for use on the Moon - namely the Gold Camera (which is another story) for Apollo 11 - this one wound up going to a small company that couldn't handle it. They spent a lot of money and never produced a camera. It was just too much for them. Kodak did the Gold Camera, which I think in some ways was a more difficult job, in six months.
1425500||LMP|The Gold Camera took close-up stereo pictures of the lunar soil and that was NASA's homage to @alsjurl/ThomasGold1968.jpg"@alsjt>Tommy Gold</a> and his gadfly irritation of the system. (Flown only on Apollo 11,12, and 14.) He cost us an awful lot of time and money; although I have to admit those were nice little pictures. I don't know if anybody's ever used them for anything; they are close-up documentation of the pristine lunar soil or, at least, as pristine as you can get close to the LM. But you see, Tommy was the one who, fairly late in the game, kept coming back and saying that the astronauts were going to sink out of sight in a thick layer of lunar dust. And even after Surveyor landed, this kept coming up because, from his radio telescope investigations he was seeing the upper few microns of the surface and he was seeing this "faerie castle" structure. It really is there - in the very top surface - but there was absolutely no scientific, geologic, or logical reason to think that, on centimeter scales and larger, the surface wasn't well tamped by the meteors. And when Surveyor landed, it didn't sink down at all; and that should have been conclusive.
1425518||LMP|While Gene was doing this description, I was probably looking closely at the boulder, very engrossed. And, while it's true that Gene is repeating essentially what I had said earlier, it shows both how engrossed he'd been in his housekeeping tasks and how good a feel he had for observation. He picked up all of the same things that I'd picked up earlier and, as he always did when he put his mind to it, did an excellent job.
1425518||LMP|It was brought to my attention on, I think, an Apollo 12 training trip to Hawaii, that stratigraphy was something of interest to the other astronauts. I think Dale Jackson was leading the exercise. And after we'd done our exercise and were all gathered around, Dale asked each of the other astronauts to give their impression of what had happened geologically, of what they had seen. And then, after they had each had a chance to do that, he asked me to summarize it and I fell back on a technique I always used in order to organize my thoughts, and that was to talk in terms of oldest unit to youngest. I just put them in sequence and talked about how the relationships between units developed as I went through in my mind oldest to youngest. And Dick Gordon - although it could have been Al Bean - asked me how I kept my thoughts organized. And that emphasized in my mind how easy it was for them to understand the concept of superposition; it's the most fundamental concept in geology, the first ever documented by natural scientists, namely by Steno (alternatively Nicolais Steno and Niels Stensen), a Dane who lived in the 1600's. Anyway, it was something that I kept putting into the training program to make sure they all realized how easy it was to organize your thoughts in terms of what's on top of what. Gene picked it up and did it well. He could have done a lot more than he actually did. Some of his more rambling descriptions - for instance, when he did his hurried horizon description from the LM - are a little bit harder to follow but, in this particular case, you can see that Gene has his thoughts pretty well organized.
1425641||LMP|This was what we called a target of opportunity. We had been looking for situations where you could get a sample from underneath a boulder overhang where it has been protected for some time from the solar wind; and, if I remember correctly, that was to give us a better handle on when the boulder rolled into that position and began to shelter the soil underneath it. The solar wind age on the fillets on the boulder should be distinct from the age of the soil underneath the overhang. I don't know who thought that up, but I tell you, the synergism in the planning for these things was so great that there's just no way that any one individual can ever take credit for anything.
1425744||LMP|I'm sure that the sample bag system evolved with time but, by the time we flew 15, we had a standard Teflon bag with the little metal strip in it; and they were all pre-numbered. We didn't try to take them out in sequence. They were on dispensers in sequence but, as I recall, we didn't worry about getting dispenser 1, dispenser 2, dispenser 3. You didn't have to; once you had the number of a sample, they could find it. In thinking more about it, Neil (Armstrong) went out and just tried to get as many different kinds of rocks as he could and put them in a bag; I bet you we didn't have individual bags on 11. On Apollo 12, though, I suspect that we did (true), because we knew they were going to move around more.
1425744||LMP|The metal strip was sealed into the upper hem of the bag in such a way that, when you took a bag off the holder it would spring open a little bit. But I think we had to squeeze in on the ends so that it would open even more. Then, when you had the sample in the bag, you folded the metal strip to provide a mechanical seal.
1425834||LMP|A north/south overhang won't provide continuous sun shading and what we really wanted was an east/west overhang.
1425933||LMP|What we never worked out with Bob was that, when he heard something, he had to tell us that he heard it. And that invariably interrupted the next thought. It should have been only when they didn't understand that they would interrupt us, but we never got Bob to do that. And the total amount of time lost was significant.
1425933||CDR|It was never a problem. It was an open conversation between the three of us, plus Bob had fourteen people over his shoulder telling him what to do. He had to listen to them, listen to us, and get instructions up to us in between our comments to him. Frankly, I don't think any time was lost. Everything that was said needed to be said. And, let me tell you, when you're flying in an airplane or working on the Moon and it gets quiet on the airways for five minutes, I'll say 'Hey, Whisky Bravo, are you still with me?' If I don't hear other airplanes or the center or anybody else - which doesn't happen all that often except sometimes late at night - I'll do that. From my point of view, the occasional interruptions were a small price to pay for knowing that we'd been heard.
1430155||LMP|A flightline stereo was a series of stereo photographs rather than just a pair. For a pair, you would just take one step left or right between the frames but here, you took a series of steps in a line, taking a picture after each step. It was a series of stereopairs which could be convergent stereo if the camera was always pointed at the same point, or parallel stereo if you didn't turn the camera. For analytical purposes, convergent stereo was better, but we didn't worry too much about that and usually took the pictures roughly parallel.
1430221||LMP|We would take a "locator" back to something like the Rover, just so that there was something in the picture that could be used to work back to where the sample had been taken. We'd just turn around and take a picture of the Rover or of the horizon. Originally it had to do with the LM being in the picture as a "locator" because, from the geometry of the Lunar Module and knowing how it had landed, you could work back along a ray to where you were and, as well, get a distance based on the size of the Lunar Module. I'm sure that in this case the locator was back to the Rover.
1430316||LMP|In order for me to pour the soil in the bag, I wanted to get him downhill.
1430400||LMP|We were looking for an east-west overhang, preferably on the north side of the rock, where the sunlight and the solar wind might not have reached.
1430425||LMP|A skim sample was the thinnest section of the surface of the regolith that I could get, intended to be a sample of the most modern solar wind effects. And then, you try to get stuff from underneath that.
1430632||LMP|I think one reason you hear the word 'Okay' so much is that we were using it as a trigger for the VOX, the voice-activated communications circuit, so that you don't cut out your first real word. I don't think it's something we talked about; it just developed.
1430936||LMP|I made a suggestion right at the beginning about where to do the rake sample; and they were coming back as if they never heard that. It seemed at the time that Bob wasn't screening requests from the Backroom and that he should have said, 'Hey, he's already told you that.' That's why I was getting annoyed.
1430936||CDR|There were just so many things going on in that Backroom and in the Control Center; Jack's been back there and he knows it. There were a lot of things that Bob had to filter out and there was a lot of time pressure. Coordination was the key and I think it worked pretty well. It was our job to let them know what we could do and couldn't do. And, while there were times when they may have wanted something we couldn't get for them, I don't ever remember anyone pushing once we advised against what they were asking us to do or we said it couldn't be done. I mean, it was our flight; they were there to help us and the mission simulations we did with the Backroom involved were an important ingredient in our training.
1431055||LMP|We had learned from the rocks brought back on the earlier missions that the zaps were a very good indicator of what was underneath because, not only did they shatter the crystalline fragments, but they knocked off the patina. There was a light, brownish patina on all of these rocks that we had found out was a very thin, partial covering of brownish glass, probably due to the splattering from these zap pits. The more recent zaps knocked the patina off around the little pit and you could see better.
1431055||LMP|I spent a good deal of time between missions studying the rocks. I did the first real hand-specimen study of the Apollo 11 basaltic rocks and then I worked with other samples off and on, mostly just to get familiar with the rocks. I had quite a few sessions, just going through the rocks, taking notes, and fixing in my mind what other people had seen. And then I got some of the other crews over to the Receiving Lab to look at rocks.
1431157||LMP|This is a good example of using the appearance of terrestrial examples to help in a description. 'Andesite' implies a specific composition but, when you're in the field you're not so much saying that you think it's that composition as you're saying what it resembles based on your experience. I think that, somewhere else, we've talked about the trouble some members of the scientific community gave Buzz Aldrin when he said something looked like mica. There's absolutely nothing wrong in field geology of saying what something looks like; you'll find out what it really is later.
1431157||LMP|One of the reasons that these things looked like porphyries is that they were crushed. They were crystalline rocks - rocks that had crystallized out of a magma body - that had been crushed by impacts, and the largest uncrushed fragments stood out against the pulverized matrix. So you get a coarse crystal in a fine-grained matrix and that's why I used the word 'porphyry'.
1431209||LMP|I've just noticed that, at the start of this speech, my words were slurred, almost as if I were very dry or had too many drinks. I may have just been getting tired, because I'd just climbed the slope.
1431819||CDR|In the suit, shuffling around, you're not the most agile person in the world and, if you're not careful, you'll kick dust onto a pristine surface that you want to sample. When you're working, you're not necessarily watching how you're walking. You're not necessarily clumsy, but it's like waddling around in some big, old, fat galoshes and you just naturally disturb a lot of the surface in the area where you're working.
1432014||LMP|Ed had been in charge of the Communications Console for as long as I could remember.
1432014||CDR|The Earth looked big; and, like the Moon looks down here, it probably wasn't as big as it looked. Yet, because the Earth's beauty was so predominant, there was also a feeling that it was the most precious possession a man could stow in his memory. There was the beauty of the colors of the oceans and the clouds: multiple shades of blue, from the azure of the Caribbean to the deep dark blues of the Pacific; the shades of white of the clouds and the snow; and the black of space around it. There you were, standing on the surface of the Moon in full sunlight, looking at the Earth, a quarter million miles away, surrounded by the blackest black. Not darkness, but the blackest black a human being can conceive in his mind. I think the perception that the Earth looks bigger than it really is probably comes from the majesty of its colors and from the fact that you are there on the Moon, looking back at it. It's an overpowering figure of life in the sky.
1432014||CDR|Even on the TV, it is a spectacular view. It's a half Earth and you can see clouds and the blues of the oceans. With your naked eye, you could make out continents. You can imagine working on the slope of the Massif on top of the Scarp and, every once in a while you have to look over your shoulder to look at what's looking at you and think about where you are and what you're doing. Sometimes, it still hardly seems like it was real. It sometimes almost seems like we were too nonchalant, worrying about fractures and rocks and rake samples and all that when the Earth was over our shoulders.
1432242||LMP|Any tool that you have to drag along the ground is going to be difficult to use and, by this time, anything you had to do with your hands wasn't easy.
1432422||LMP|By this time in Apollo, the walkback constraints had been well established. My main effort was to make sure they weren't too constraining. Left to their own devices, some of the planners would have been much more conservative than was necessary.
1432439||LMP|The people examining samples had concluded that there was a significantly larger variety in the walnut-size range than there were in the major rocks that were scattered around. Apparently, rocks thrown into a site from distant places were concentrated in the walnut-size range.
1432647||CDR|We tried to distribute loads but, compared with the weight of the backpack, the weight of the SCB never bothered me. In one-sixth gravity you just couldn't put that much into one of the SCBs and I just never felt like I was carrying any extra weight.
1432818||CDR|When you were going uphill, you had to take little steps and get your toes dug in. Because you didn't have as much weight holding you down as you would have on Earth and because you're center-of-mass was so high because of the backpack, it was harder to keep your balance. But coming downhill, the only trouble was - like being on a ski-slope - if you came straight downhill using that kangaroo hop, you'd get going really fast. And, if you stubbed your toe, you'd go tail over tea kettle.
1432839||LMP|The purpose of the training, in my mind, was to make everything that could be routine be as routine as possible so that you didn't have to think about it and didn't have to talk about it.
1432910||CDR|Although we can hear on the tape that the microphone in my suit was picking up the sound of my hammering, I don't ever remember hearing it. I could certainly feel it; and I've always contended that it's a very fine line between hearing noise and feeling noise. With that hammer, when you hit something the shock went through your whole body; but I'm not sure I ever heard the noise, probably because my ears were covered with the Snoopy helmet.
1432910||CDR|The boulder was just sitting on the soil and, as I remember, when I hit it with the hammer, it moved. That's how I knew we would be able to roll it if we wanted to.
1432910||CDR|This is a good example of the posture you have to assume to go after a boulder that's not much more than knee high. You have to bend down in your suit to get whatever sort of leverage you can with the hammer and then swing it from the side. Normally, we'd hit it straight on in a vertical plane but, because you don't have much mobility in the suit, I was bending my right knee, bringing the hammer up across my chest (to the left), and then swinging it down to my right. So I was actually back-handing it to get at the face. You just adapted to whatever the suit would give you. And, here, when I bent down, leaning a little into the hill, the suit was actually so stiff it helped me maintain that folded-knee position without dropping all the way to my knees. This is a good example of what it took to operate in the suit and on a slope.
1433010||LMP|A rhyolite is a volcanic rock, usually having large crystals in a fine-grained matrix, low in iron-magnesium silicates, high in quartz and feldspar. This inclusion wasn't a rhyolite, but had a similar texture.
1433037||LMP|One of these fragments turned out to be the oldest dated rock ever sampled on the Moon. It was dated at 4.6 billion years, plus or minus 0.1 billion years, in a mineral isochron analysis. They really had to work at it because there wasn't a lot there; it was mostly olivine and to do a mineral isochron you've got to do separates of a number of minerals. I don't know what they found in there, ilmenite or something. And then you have to extract the lead isotopes and do an analysis on them. The revolution in mass-spectrometry techniques as a result of Apollo was just phenomenal. It was literally getting down to the point where they were counting atoms as they were coming off the samples. And that, in turn, has led to this dilemma we have in environmental consideration here on Earth in that we can now measure very small quantities of 'supposedly toxic' substances which we never knew were there before. And I say 'supposedly' because some things don't become toxic until they reach certain levels of concentration. And, at very low levels, things like copper and selenium are even necessary for good health.
1433353||LMP|There was a lot of boulder-rolling discussion on the @alsjurl/ap-geotrips.html"@alsjt>field trips</a>. Mostly, Gene just rolled this one for fun but, by doing so, he exposed the soil underneath and we got a sample of it.
1433522||LMP|As it turned out, it was olivine in olivine; almost a pure olivine rock. So it's interesting that I made that guess up there. Olivine has a vitreous luster and a light greenish color but, again, in this case it was chunks of olivine in a crushed matrix of olivine that had been through the mill for four-and-a-half billion years.
1433522||LMP|The cross-country skiing motion, I think, takes less energy than the kangaroo hop because I was just sort of moving my ankles, not flexing the suit as much. I always seemed to wear out faster when I tried hopping versus the semi-stride.
1433559||LMP|You got to where you were doing things like that all the time. Things moved very slowly and the best flexibility you had in any part of the suit was in the wrist; so you took advantage of it.
1433935||LMP|We were out on the light mantle, which we thought was an avalanche. If it is an avalanche, you wouldn't expect many rock fragments; they would have worked their way downward in a gas-lubricated avalanche (flow) and all that would be at the surface would be fines. If the surface were old enough, you would find a few fragments, all of them thrown in from elsewhere.
1434104||LMP|I suspect that I didn't want to drive a long distance on the Rover with a full SCB; if the top came open we could have lost samples.
1434123||LMP|Gene started out doing the kangaroo hop for a little ways and then went into a left-foot-forward skip. He wasn't getting very high off the ground because you can see his toe kicking dirt almost every step. Anybody wanting to estimate how fast two relatively tired people could go should look at this sequence. This one sequence could give you a lot of information about walkback. I'm glad we didn't have to do that.
1434131||CDR|It was a good station; we got a lot done. We'd joked around with the Falcon code - which I'd learned in the Navy - during training but, you notice, it was Bob who brought it up. There were about twenty Falcon phrases, and Falcon 109 was 'Beautiful; just fucking beautiful.'
1434153||LMP|The way I responded to Gene makes me think that I had noticed the buried layer of lighter material and had filed it away in the back of my brain while we were working. And it's a good thing he brought it up, because otherwise we wouldn't have noticed it at this point.
1434155||LMP| I think Gene is comparing the depth of his footprints in the light mantle with those he made in the talus slope where we sampled the boulders. From the fact that we got (rock) fragments on the talus slope but not in the light mantle tells me that we had a finer material on the light mantle and I expect we were sinking in farther down there. This section is confusing, there's a lot of (verbal) shorthand.
1434238||LMP|I was wondering if we got a big gravity change as we got up onto the Massif. We did, but I don't know if anybody ever told me about it.
1434318||LMP|They were realizing that the SEP was running awfully hot and, probably because we were going to retrace our tracks, they thought that they might save it for the final traverse by leaving it off and covered.
1434743||CDR|- (Laughing) "This is a typical exchange between Jack and Bob. Sometimes it almost got to be a test of wills.
1434743||LMP|We were there to learn. I wanted to be sure that I didn't get distracted and forget some pertinent observation. The Backroom wanted as much information as we could give them and during this time when we were driving away from the station was a good time to do the equivalent of making some field notes.
1434855||LMP|I think that this is the pilot laughing at the scientist's admission of imprecision.
1435658||LMP|Note the change from 'Echo'.
1435930||LMP|It really did look yellow or orangish and it's interesting that later on I hesitate on calling the orange soil 'orange' at Shorty, because I had already been fooled.
1440426||LMP|All over the Moon, the gardening process reaches a fraction of a centimeter deeper every million years, and the depth to the light material is fairly consistent with an avalanche age of about 100 million years that was determined from solar-wind exposure measurements.
1440507||LMP|If he turned right, it tended to force me to take pictures through the TV antenna; whereas, if he turned left, I got a better field-of-view
1440544||LMP|This is the nominal location of the planned LRV sample, which I read from the cuff checklist without remembering that they had already cancelled it.
1441020||CDR|Ever since I've been back from the Moon, I've attributed the difficulty we had in judging size and distance to the lack of references like telephone poles, roads, trees, and so forth. I'd forgotten that I said this about the lack of color contributing to the problem, and I'm sure it's true. It's interesting that I made the observation at this point in the traverse. Here we were, high up on top of the Scarp in very hummocky, rolling terrain, looking out across the valley and across to the North Massif. You've got a bland-looking landscape, and I'm sure that what I was seeing were foreground features that just blended into the background. I'm sure that the overall gray color and the lack of major color changes contributed to the inability to develop accurate depth perception.
1441025||LMP|We don't know for sure, but the Scarp is probably an actual fault scarp and, out to about halfway across the valley, toward the South Massif, the landslide material is draped over it. And what I'm commenting on here is that on the southern end of the Scarp where we are now, the Scarp seems to be a series of scarps or steps whereas up to the north it seems to be one continuous line.
1441333||CDR|Listening to the tapes, I'm really starting to re-live the ride. This ride up to Station 2 and back is much clearer in my memory than the ride to and from Station 1 was, because this was really spectacular terrain and driving the Rover and riding on it was really a challenge and was really fun. It was not your ordinary trip to the Moon. This was a unique place, probably the most unique and challenging for the use of the Rover because of the heights to which we climbed and the terrain which we were in. The lobes of the Scarp weren't vertical cliffs; they were lobes, as Jack describes, or rounded plateaus and they made it a challenging ride. You can hear it in our voices and see it in some of the pictures. It's a shame that the TV pictures and the still pictures don't really give a full appreciation of how steep some of those rolling hills were in this part of the valley. All you'd need would be a fishing pond and a few trees and it would be a great place to build a house.
1441523||CDR|One-sixth gravity just did not hold the Rover to the ground very well. You always bounced around a lot and, if you had any speed, that just aggravated the bounce. Where 'the rubber meets the road' (an advertising slogan of the Firestone Tire Company in the 70's) was not a very tight fit and, if you were going downhill and you had to turn left or right, the tendency of the Rover to spin or roll was pretty great.
1441617||CDR|This is the way I think when I'm flying an airplane: to increase both bearing and range, I need to be more than ninety degrees to the left of the LM bearing. And if I wanted to stay at the same range and increase my bearing, then I'd 'fly an arc' and keep my heading at 90 degrees to the LM bearing.
1441631||LMP|The SPAN room was where the troubleshooting started when there was a problem. It was an engineering room, and I used to spend a lot of time in the SPAN room with other missions when I was helping out with various engineering problems. One time I was in there with George Abbey - and I can't remember now quite why it happened - but, up above their consoles, the people in the SPAN room had a pegboard where they stuck all their messages, and it wasn't structurally very sound. Somehow I hit the board, which knocked over the coffee cups they had in front of it, and the coffee spilled onto the consoles.
1441642||LMP|Dick Thorson was the guy who was on duty in the SPAN room the day I spilled the coffee
1442136||CDR|I may have been exaggerating a little about 17-1/2 or 18 clicks, but I know we were going at least 14 or 15 clicks coming down there. We were really moving. (Smiling) But, then, what can I say? There it is, documented: 17-1/2 or 18 clicks.
1442238||CDR|We were going north and, as we did, the bearings to the LM were going to get higher and higher. We would have had to have gone south to get to a bearing of 080.
1442632||CDR|While it is possible that I was leaning over to the right and maybe down a little bit to read the pitch indicator without parallax, what 'get it over to read' sounds like is that the indicator had flopped up and was showing me roll when I wanted to read pitch first.
1443054||LMP|Gene needed someplace to lay the long-can cap. When we did it together, I'd hold the cap.
1443617||LMP|As I recall, I spent a few tens of seconds trying to find a place to set it so that it would stand; and I think I ended up off to the side a bit with it.
1443934||LMP|With two of us working together, bagging samples was fairly easy; but it was a lot harder solo. A lot harder. You had to hold the bag in one hand, and somehow or another get your scoop out over it so that you could dump something in it. And it was not easy, because you're moving your arms against the pressure in the suit while gripping both the bag and the scoop.
1444055||LMP|There was no note. Gene and Bob were just teasing the scientists, threatening to contaminate the sealed sample. This was a real-time 'put on' that Bob came up with; and Gene just fell in with the spirit of it instantaneously. I'm pretty sure it wasn't planned, although it could have been based on something that had come up in training.
1444055||CDR|I don't remember this, but I don't think there was any note. It was just a little bantering back and forth between Bob and I to make people wonder. I'd like to know if that can's ever been opened, because I think they were going to keep it sealed for some indeterminate length of time.
1444359||CDR|This is something that my father used to say, and I'm glad I said it on the Moon. 'If it's worth doing at all, it's worth doing right.' And then he'd add: 'Or you're just going to have to do it over again.' His name was Andy. Andrew George Cernan. And he also used to say 'I'll only ever ask of you to do your best.' Whether it was in studying, or playing football or playing the clarinet - which I tried to do but never did very well. 'You may not be better than everyone else at everything,' he said, 'but if you do your best, sometime, your going to shine in something. And there's only one person in the world who knows what's your best: and that's you.' A good man.
1444700||LMP|Facing up a slope like that, it was easy to get down and back up.
1445253||LMP|This request for an EMU check was actually a code phrase which meant 'In our opinion, you need to slow down a bit; and, if you want to give us an EMU check, we'll take it.'
1445304||CDR|There wasn't anything very exotic about taking pans. In training, we'd use real film and get it developed to see how we did. Basically, you wanted to get the horizon and it was pretty obvious what you had to do to get what you were looking for. It was just common sense. The only real variation was when I was facing upslope, sometimes I would take a picture of the foreground, lean back and get the horizon, then come down, turn a little, and take a picture straight in front of me, and then lean back to get the horizon again. That would give not only a horizontally overlapping pan but a vertically overlapping one as well for the local area that had a big upslope to it. I did that on my own because I figured that film was the least of our worries. And there were other times when I might take the camera off and sighted along the top surface to make sure I was getting things like the flag. And, of course, you had to use a lens-barrel sight when you used the 500.
1445444||LMP|I was acknowledging that I'd been mad at him.
1445621||CDR|Working in pairs has its advantages and we certainly saw that at Station 2. But, here, I was getting a core sample and that was a one-man job. There's no sense in two people doing that, so what is the other man going to do but something like take a pan and do some solo sampling? It's always nice to have the other guy to help and point things out, but you can still get a great deal of sampling done by yourself. Sampling seems to go smoother as a two-man operation because of the constraints of the suit: one guy can hold the bag and the other guy can pour a sample in. But it's also something you can learn to do by yourself. And, even when there are two of you doing the sampling, you have to wonder if you're really getting your money's worth out of the second guy. So, I'm not hard over on it like Jack is. This station was set up to be two one-man operations, particularly the core sample. Jack got a little frustrated. He dropped things, and his bags kept coming off, and he fell down. And all that adds up to the frustration that he feels about this station. But if one-man sampling had gone smoothly - which it could have - then he probably would have had a different attitude. Maybe the design of the tool should have been a little bit different or maybe there should have been different techniques, but I don't think that there should be a hard-and-fast rule about two-man sampling.
1445621||LMP|I have no problem with the fact that we tried to do solo sampling; I'm just saying that it wasn't very efficient. So I'll modify my position to say 'whenever possible'. Although, who knows? Maybe if we had worked in sequence - done the core together and then done the sampling together - it would probably not have taken any more time and it certainly wouldn't have been as frustrating.
1445634||LMP|They eventually named this Ballet Crater.
1445646||LMP|I don't remember this, but I'm sure I was playing. It wouldn't have been out of character, and it was a major effort to get the heel up high.
1445646||CDR|You have to develop confidence in the suit. You didn't want to roll down into a rocky crater and bust up the PLSS, and you didn't want to tear the suit on a rock. You were cautious and were aware of the possibility of busting something on the suit if you did something extreme. But the suit had to be designed so that, in ordinary operations, what you did was more constrained by the inherent mobility and flexibility of the suit rather than by safety. You wanted to be sure that safety considerations simply didn't arise. Jack would have been a lot more careful had he been walking through a boulder field but here, on this little crater rim, there weren't any rocks, and this little bit of playing wasn't particularly dangerous at all.
1445909||CDR|goes to his seat
1450057||LMP|It still amazes me that we could manipulate that dark slide, particular with our hands so tired.
1450317||LMP|I think that during training, somebody took a bunch of pictures with the lens cap on, and it was always a big joke afterwards. On the 500-mm, you don't look through the lens to sight it. So you could leave the lens cap on and not know it. It was built that way because, with your head inside the helmet and the camera outside, the camera was a long way from your eye and a viewfinder would have been useless.
1450317||CDR|With the 500 mm, unlike the 70 mm, if you moved it just a little bit you didn't get what you wanted. So the bullseye helped us a lot.
1450750||CDR|I have a vague recollection about this. We were starting to come back northeasterly. We were still in the very early morning sun, even on the second day and there was a lot of reflective material on the front of the Rover which meant that you had to be very careful.
1450908||LMP|In working with Ron Schrieve, an old friend of mine at UCLA who is an expert on landslides and avalanches, we had come up with a list of things that one might see to verify if this was actually an avalanche deposit that we were driving over. And this discussion refers to the list of things that one sees in terrestrial avalanches. And what I was saying was that 100 million years or so of gardening has pretty well destroyed the kind of detailed features that Ron had indicated one might see on a fresh avalanche. Now, one thing that I thought I observed at the time but which hasn't come up yet in the transcript - which makes me think it must have come up when I started studying the photographs after the mission - was that it appeared that the larger the crater in the surface of the light mantle, the larger the blocks that were on its rim. Combining that observation with the lack of any sizable rocks in the rake samples suggested that you get fine material on top and coarser and coarser material as you go down in the light mantle, which is what you would expect to happen in an avalanche. The larger fragments having a smaller surface area to volume ratio, and would naturally sink to the bottom of the flow. And that's really the only possible evidence we saw that it was actually an avalanche, other than the general form and characteristics.
1451442||CDR|It's hard to recall, but I've got to believe that we were forced into that decision because we had already stopped and had positioned ourselves to get that sample. And, when you're there, it makes sense to get it. And, heck, it didn't take 30 seconds.
1452213||CDR|As I recall, we had worked out all the parking attitudes based on for battery cooling, TV coverage, and a number of things.
1452241||LMP|I don't remember coming up to the rim of Shorty very well. I can remember looking into the crater. Apparently, from the dialog here, it looked as if we were headed into the crater; although, from the photographs of where we parked the Rover, it doesn't look like we were that close to going down into the crater.
1452322||CDR|I didn't say "4.2" very clearly, but I can hear it and that's what it was.
1452348||LMP|The tiredness is clearly gone from my voice. Getting there provided a new surge of adrenaline. Visually, this was a lot more exciting than Station 3, and it got even more exciting with the discovery of the orange soil. Station 3 was a lot of work; and this one turned out to be fun.
1452447||CDR|(Watching the video) This is very interesting. You can see a reflection in my visor of me dusting the battery covers.
1452627||LMP|The orange soil was several meters away from the Rover, up closer to the boulder. The orange spots of light that I saw reflected off the LCRU at the Scarp stop were tiny things; the Mylar covering the LCRU was crinkled, and you only got small spots every once in a while when the Sun angles were just right. When I spotted the orange soil, I probably hadn't even started the pan. What I probably saw was the scuff marks I'd made when I went over to the boulder. Actually you could see the orange through the regolith, but it was more obvious after you'd stirred it up.
1452632||CDR|Quite frankly, when Jack said he saw orange soil, I began to wonder if he hadn't been on the Moon too long. Until I saw it myself.
1452646||CDR|Like a pair of ordinary sunglasses, the visor attenuated the light but didn't really change the colors. If it was red, it was red; if it was blue, it was blue. But you could see the colors better with the visor up. I do that flying; I take my sunglasses off if I really want to see things clearly. So lifting up the visor was a natural thing for me to do.
1452707||LMP|You'll have to ask Bob, but I think he was thinking of green cheese, as in 'The Moon's made out of green cheese.' My guess is that he wasn't convinced that we weren't trying to pull their leg again. And for good reason, because every once in a while we'd do that, either inadvertently or advertently.
1452750||LMP|The dust is going to get into anything that's not hermetically sealed. After a while, moving parts don't move any more with dust in them. We had a bracket for the dusting brush, and that bracket was now full of dust and he couldn't get the brush handle in it. One lock on the gate was no longer usable; and I was having an awfully hard time getting my scoop on and off.
1452815||LMP|I don't know what Gene had in mind, but I suspect that the sounder was just an instrument in the Command Module that he remembered that you could point at something. But the sounder wouldn't have had anything to see here, because of it's coarse resolution, if nothing else.
1452815||LMP|Of course, Ron started to see orange areas from orbit as soon as he heard about it. He saw orange in the southwestern part of the Serenitatis Basin, in what's called the Sulpicius Gallus region ( @alsjurl/a17/a17LTO42D4.jpg"@alsjt>12 Mb</a> ). And, when Gene and I got back into orbit, we were able to confirm and I mapped quite extensive regions of the orange and other colors. And, as we left the Moon, we were looking back at a full Moon and, for a little while, we had good color/tint definition.
1452815||CDR|When I heard that Ron had seen some orange patches from orbit, I was concerned that maybe the power of suggestion had taken over. You can stand on the Moon and suggest colors to yourself and you begin to see those colors. You could tint the bland gray color of the Moon blue or green or brown. By this time I was absolutely convinced that Jack and I could see the definitive color delineation between the orange and the gray (at Shorty), but I was concerned that Ron was being influenced by the power of suggestion. But, when we got back into orbit, I ate my thoughts because we really did see areas that you could definitively define as orange. Now, whether we would have seen those orange patches had we not seen orange soil on the surface, I don't know. If we had not found orange soil on the surface, we might have seen the orange areas from orbit and have just passed them off as reflections of some kind; because, who would have expected to find orange soil on the Moon? But, having known it was on the surface, we could feel comfortable about being able to say that we could see the orange from orbit.
1452815||LMP|The reason that this was a little more exciting than it might have even been otherwise was that, in our thinking about the origins of Shorty, we really had two major possibilities, with a number of observations related to each one. Number One was what we really believed and what turned out to be true: that Shorty was an impact crater that had penetrated the light mantle and was exposing the dark-mantle and/or subfloor basalt beneath. The other alternative, just because of the lack of resolution and information from the pre-mission photographs, was that it was a dark-haloed volcanic crater; and, if that were true, one of the things that we had on our list to look for were signs of alteration, possible fluid-induced alteration of materials around the crater. And normally, on Earth, that alteration is colored, fumarolic alteration from oxidation. And so, when we saw orange, that was the immediate thought that everybody had. 'My God, there's a volcanic emanation here that's altered the soil.' Well, it turned out that that wasn't true, of course. It was volcanic material, but it was volcanic glass that had been spewed out of some fire-fountain-like eruptions 3.5 billion years ago that somehow had been protected from mixing with anything else, even though it was now at the surface. It had almost certainly been covered almost immediately by a lava flow, so that it was protected from meteor disruption and stirring. And then, when Shorty formed, somehow the pyroclastic ended up in the rim and a few other places in nearly pure form. There are some issues having to do with its origins that we can get to in a moment, but that's what caused all the excitement. We had sort of halfway predicted that we would find it there, even though it turned out not to be what we predicted we would find. They had a camera running in the Backroom, and what it shows is that, when that call came over, everybody sort of jumped up in the air and there was just total loss of control in the back science room.
1452815||CDR|This is not meant as a criticism, but I think that Jack tended to fall more than the rest of us did. And it's maybe because he became more aggressive. And, thank God for one-sixth gravity. You would have dropped things anyway because of the lack of nimbleness and dexterity and you would have wanted to get down to pick things up and chip rocks and what have you. And one-sixth gravity made getting back up a lot easier than it would have been otherwise. You developed a personal technique - the way you skipped or hopped, the way you got on and off the Rover, the way you got up when you fell.
1452943||LMP|What we dug was half of a trench. That is, we'd only try to maintain one wall - the east-facing wall - and tear down the other one so that you could see in.
1453128||LMP|I think there have been others, but this is a particularly good example of where Gene deferred to me in organizing how we would approach a geological problem, just as I would defer to him on the Rover stuff and things like that. It worked out pretty well; that had all been sorted out, almost without us knowing it, during the training cycle.
1453128||CDR|You can't specifically train for every moment of the mission, so the key is that you train for knowledge of each other and you train for teamwork. And, when you come up with something new and different, you just defer to each other's capabilities. In this particular case, Jack had pretty much surrounded the orange-soil project, if you will, and had in his mind what we needed to get. So we went ahead and did it.
1453158||CDR|You can see here how I could bend down without kneeling - without getting to a static position - to get some close-up pictures. In one-sixth gravity you can go down slow enough and you can waver in that almost-kneeling position - uncomfortable and hard to sustain - long enough to get a couple of pictures at a 125th of a second.
1453304||LMP|It came out in chunks. It was cohesive. It eventually fell apart as they worked with it in Houston, but it was cohesive enough that when we put it in the bags it was in chunks.
1453513||LMP|Post-mission analysis showed that the orange soil turned out to be very small, spherical beads of glass, rich in titanium and low in silica and with the intensity of the orange color apparently related to the titanium/iron ratio.
1453624||LMP|The reason I asked the question was not so much because I disagreed but, as I did several times during the EVAs, I wanted to make the Backroom think a little bit, just to make sure they thought through some of the options they had. Based on the information we had up to this point, it looked like something vertical in the rim of the crater; and, fortunately, we did what they suggested and didn't change because, otherwise, we might not have hit the underlying black soil.
1454041||CDR|You had to hold the hammer tightly with your fingers. It was like gripping your golf club too tightly: all your muscles tighten up and your swing goes to hell and you get tired. And to make it harder, the core wasn't going down all that readily. It was just a heavy bit of work, particularly clutching the hammer.
1454227||LMP|Post mission analysis showed that the black soil was mostly beads of devitrified (crystallized) glass of the same composition as the orange, but with a different cooling history.
1454239||LMP|It turned out to be ilmenite.
1454310||LMP|I think Gene had gotten the cap partially threaded on and wanted me to finish the threading by turning the tube in my hand while he held the cap.
1454314||CDR|You can see in the TV how much inertia I got into my arm to get it back there. I didn't move back slowly at all. I already had my hand chest high and I sort of raised my hand and then moved back very rapidly. You just couldn't go back slowly and sneak up on it. Other times, when my arm was down more, I'd have to do the double pump; but, here, my hand was already up there. You adapted mentally and physiologically to find the easy way to do things like this and, rather than bust my butt trying to stretch and push that suit to go back, I'd just bring my hand up chest high and, with the strength I'd need if I was swinging the hammer, just swing my arm back there. Then, once your hand was back there, the suit was stiff enough that, before it rebounded, you could reach the control and not have to forcibly hold your arm back there.
1454430||LMP|When we knew we only had a little bit of time, we got things done a lot better than when we did a station for no specific purpose, like Station 3. Station 3 was a disaster. We got a lot done, but it was a very poor use of time. This one was both productive and fun.
1454447||LMP|The boulder had been intensely shocked. It was falling apart.
1454559||LMP|Here, when I was bagging the sample, I was using the @alsjurl/alsj-RCU.html"@alsjt>RCU</a> and the top of my camera as a work bench that was immediately available.
1454836||LMP|A first-rate observation.
1454836||CDR|- (Tongue slightly in cheek) "I really do appreciate getting an A-plus on the quiz. I really wondered; it's taken a long time (nearly 19 years) to find out how I did.
1455543||LMP|We could see part of each other's footpan, but not all of it because of the console.
1455545||LMP|The temperatures were getting up there; but Marshall also had pretty good safety margins on those batteries. The fact that they were getting hotter was a concern, but they never caused a problem.
1455554||LMP|My first inclination in the MOCR would have been to turn around and say 'Did anybody get that?,' rather than call right up and distract the crew.
1455649||LMP|I can't say I remember this exactly, but I'm confident that, as we were driving away and I was finally taking a deep breath, I was beginning to review the thirty minutes we'd had at Shorty and what it all meant. So I wanted to make sure I understood what Gene had seen.
1455750||CDR|Driving up-Sun was mean. It was like what happens in flight when the Sun's directly overhead and you look down. You just lose your visibility because of the glare.
1455808||LMP|I started to talk too soon. I should have waited a few minutes; but I imagine the adrenaline was still flowing. I was trying to get to a point in my thoughts where I could start to interpret a little bit.
1455925||LMP|We were pretty quiet in here (for about forty-five seconds) and it seems to me that we were in a bit of a letdown after Shorty. We'd been on an emotional high and had been going so fast and needed to stop talking and take a deep emotional breath.
1455925||CDR|Being on the Rover was one of the few places where you could relax. Physically, you were constrained and had to relax. The only thing I had to do was drive - which took a little more attention than usual because of the Sun - and observe as best I could. Sometimes, not talking is very restful. When you're talking - particularly in a case like this, you've got to think; and thinking takes energy. And, after a while you get tired of hearing yourself talk. We'd done an awful lot in the last few minutes at Shorty and we needed to rest both mentally and physically.
1460101||LMP|Victory is a 'V'-shaped depression that was probably made out of three craters. It commemorates @alsjurl/a17/a17.site.html#victory">Winston Churchill</a>. Although it's a political symbol, I think we actually got that one by the nomenclature committee.
1460149||LMP|This sounds like something that somebody might have said repeatedly during training, but I don't remember anything about it.
1460213||LMP|What I had hoped to do, as we crossed the edges of the light mantle on either side of Tortilla Flat, was to pick up anything at the contact that we might use to identify it. And, in retrospect, because we hadn't been able to see a sharp contact on the (down-Sun) drive to Station 2, with the Sun in my eyes there was just no way I was going to make any useful observations in here. So that's why there's not much information coming out of us at this point. Going down-Sun to Station 2, we had the highest albedo reflections coming right back at us and we could see the brighter crater walls on the light mantle. But going into the Sun you're mostly looking into shadow and there's also the obscuration caused by the dust on your visor.
1460226||LMP|The upper visor was the middle (laterally) part of the visor assembly that had a sunshade on it. It was fitted in a slot and you could grab the sunshade and pull it down. Mine had gotten a lot of dust in it.
1460243||CDR|In looking at some of the pictures that Jack took during the drive, you see things in one picture that you didn't see in the last. Everything was new. Every time you went over another hill, every time you went over a saddle, or went into another valley, you came into something that you didn't know was there or didn't expect to look like it actually looked. It was true exploration of a virgin territory; particularly with the mobility that the Rover gave.
1460348||LMP|A coincidental thing at this point in the transcript is that Professor McKinstry - after whom Van Serg Crater (Station 9) is named - had done a paper on geologese in which he made fun of what geologists sometimes use as terminology.
1460348||LMP|These pit-bottom craters really were quite common. I think that the depth of the bench in a pit-bottom crater varied with size. So I suspect, then, that it has to do with a relationship between the impact energy and the confinement of the regolith with depth. The more energy you have, the deeper it can penetrate before you have a hiatus in the relationship between confinement pressure, if you will, in the regolith and the excavation capability of the impact. I'm sure the soil mechanics people would have better ways to put that; but some of those pits were remarkable and, in my mind, it's a little hard to understand how those craters formed. It may reflect what people have said these impacts really are: small linear explosions. Near the upper surface, where there's no confinement, you get essentially a point explosion-type excavation. But, as you get near the depth of maximum penetration, you get more of a linear explosion back out. Who knows? They were quite common and the fresh ones, like all of the fresh craters, had a little glass in the bottom of them. I suspect they are prevalent everywhere on the Moon, but you're going to have to be clever to recognize them in the pictures. In a few places we sampled the glass and (in one case) even tried to get an oriented sample. One of the theories was that these impacts would cause local magnetic anomalies and we wanted to see if, as the glass cooled through the Curie point, it would retain memory of the field.
1460457||CDR|Dust was getting to be a big problem. This was a long EVA and we'd done a lot of driving. I don't think dust was a problem reading the Rover console because that was pretty vertical, but I noticed at one of the earlier stations I dusted the top of my @alsjurl/alsj-RCU.html"@alsjt>RCU</a> so that I could read it better.
1460541||LMP|I don't think the antenna (on the charge) had to see the Central Station. There was a ground wave that would let you communicate. I think we had asked the Principal Investigator if there were any reasons - like coupling of the explosion - why we should avoid holes and he had said it didn't make any difference.
1460707||LMP|The engineers were also afraid that we would come back along our track and run over one.
1460841||LMP|You had to change the f-stop. With the Sun directly behind you it was f/11. On either side of that it was f/8. And then f/5.6 back toward the Sun. The shutter speed was 1/250th of a second. When we had color film in one of the cameras - usually in Gene's camera - we were making the first use of a brand new Kodak Ektachrome film.
1460901||LMP|It had seemed to me for a long time that with the Rover we just weren't getting enough statistical coverage of the regolith across the area, and the @alsjurl/a17/ap17-KSC-72PC-411.jpg"@alsjt>Rover Sampler</a> was a way to get more samples. I don't remember how many Rover samples we got, although it wasn't as many as I'd intended to get.
1460939||LMP|Bob sometimes forgot to anticipate when the crew was busy.
1461025||CDR|Your helmet didn't move, so you had to turn your head. But the visor only let you look maybe 45 or 60 degrees to either side, so it was easier just to point the Rover.
1461224||LMP|I think Bob may have been mis-using a term here. And that may be reflected in my next comment. A 'grid' sample would have been a series of samples on a map grid. So I'm not sure what he meant.
1461505||CDR|We were having a little observational debate through here. Jack looked at things differently than I did because of his professional background but, on the other hand, I always thought my observations were as good as his. You describe what you see. Someone else might interpret what it is. I always felt I didn't have to tell them what it was; I had to tell them what I was looking at. If I had an impression of what it might be, I'd give them that impression. But I don't think we had time to come to any absolute conclusions nor was it expected of us. We were on the Rover and we were moving and we had to give good enough observations that a geologist could put them together and come up with a pretty fair description of what these craters were all about.
1461919||LMP|That was the field geologist talking. When you're a field geologist and you say something's there and you put it on your map, you expect that people will trust you without a photograph. And Gene was thinking 'Nobody'll believe us unless there's a picture of it.'
1461919||CDR|A picture adds a lot to your description, particularly if you're in a hurry like we were at Shorty.
1462626||LMP|Basically there wasn't going to be anything but the subfloor to sample here. Camelot is about a 600-meter-diameter crater, so it should have penetrated maybe 150 meters into the subfloor.
1463050||LMP|'Ophitic' - and 'subophitic' would be less strongly representative - is when the feldspar crystals are approximately the same size as the pyroxene and are only partially included in them. It looks like a mat with feldspar and pyroxene intergrown. 'Diabase' is the type of basalt that has that texture. And what I meant in the last sentence is that the rock structure is organized, that it's not a random, uniform face in that the vesicles are in planar concentrations. There were some zones with more vesicles and some zones with fewer vesicles and they were organized in planar structures. Lava flows often show that.
1463050||LMP|One characteristic of impact craters is that, when they form in layered rocks, they overturn the sequence and maintain it. You see that at Meteor Crater (Arizona) and other places where you can actually see the rim deposits. Nuclear explosion craters do the same thing. It's all ballistic and the layers just end up being overturned; so, as you walk away from the rim, you're walking upsection. That is, (as you walk away from the rim) you're going through the layers as if you were down in the bottom of the crater going up. And if there was going to be any variation, you would want to walk radial to the crater; not along the rim. Everywhere on the rim you'd find the same material from roughly the same layer.
1463413||LMP|What I was trying to say was that, at Camelot, the rim thickness of mantle (the apparent depth of regolith burying boulders) was about half of what we saw at Horatio. That's the problem with talking and observing simultaneously.
1463637||LMP|I was trying to get Gene to work on a bigger boulder just to the right of where I was standing here. It was one I was looking at earlier; and he set up at a different boulder and I was afraid we were going to lose the opportunity to get the structures. This is one of the few times - that I remember, anyway - that he didn't follow the lead I was trying to get him to take on the sampling. Also, there were fractures and planes in the bigger boulder that he could have sampled without bending over.
1463637||CDR|Twenty years later, Jack's just got a better memory about some of the details of the sampling. If you had something on your mind at the time, the pictures and transcripts will tend to bring them back. And, if you didn't have them on your mind at the time, there's nothing to recall. But I do remember being in that boulder field and that you really did have to watch your step. We were hopping around between rocks and boulders and you could have tripped on even a foot-high boulder. And you definitely didn't want to fall on another rock or boulder. I won't say that it was 'precarious' but it certainly was a challenging traverse through there.
1463637||CDR|It wasn't something you could train for, because there wasn't any way to really train for the one-sixth gravity. There was a training device called the Peter Pan rig (with harnesses to simulate some aspects of one-sixth gravity) which was used early on; but I don't think I used it after Apollo 10. But, with a little common sense, you can adapt. I mean, you don't go in there dumb and blind. You know there are boulders and, by this time in the mission, you certainly knew how to get around in one-sixth gravity. If you jumped off the LM for the first time and, right away, had to walk around in this boulder field, you wouldn't have the aggressiveness - and caution - we had. You wouldn't be adapted yet to one-sixth gravity. You wouldn't know the most productive ways of getting around and you wouldn't know the pitfalls as well.
1464200||CDR|The rubber grip on the hammer was made of the same material as the glove finger tips.
1464425||LMP|This type of sample would enable you to decide whether dark mantle had been laid down on top of the rocks or whether that material had all just been thrown up there from the regolith surrounding it.
1465024||LMP|Gene doesn't seem to have picked up the rolling gait that you need to have in order to use a stride rather than a hop. And that may just be because he never did any cross-country skiing. It's a fairly natural motion, I think, for a cross-country skier.
1465024||CDR|Each individual adapts in a different way, but the results are basically the same. Some guys skip; some guys hop. And you pick a way of getting around that gives you the greatest comfort and mobility and productivity. I moved around in a half-dozen different ways and found I liked the old fifth-grade skip, because I could cover eight or ten feet in the air and come down - with stability - on both feet. Boom boom and up again. That was my way of really moving across the surface without expending a lot of energy. And that's probably why, subconsciously, I went that way rather than wobbling from side to side. Subconsciously, you sought a way of getting around that gave you a sense of security and required the least amount of energy. And I got my energy out of my knees by springing up like that. You shouldn't say, rigidly, 'you have to do it in this fashion'. It's like a golf swing, to some degree. You'll find a number of good golfers with totally different swings.
1465040||CDR|I don't know where I got the song from, but it's got to be a thousand years old. Some cowboy singer or something. This was fun! My feet just got far enough apart for stability when I hit the ground and then I could spring up with both of them. I was doing a little bit of the cross-country stride in the beginning, but I wasn't doing it with strides as big as Jack's, going way left and way right like he did. You were less balanced like that than when you were skipping, so I switched.
1465040||CDR|In order to stop, I had to take a couple of steps to transition from the skip to a walk. It's like a horse that's in a gallop and slows down to a trot.
1465110||LMP|It would have been nice to have had more time at Camelot, just like everywhere else. We hadn't seen much variety in the boulders we looked at and it would have been nice to go as far down the rim inside of Camelot as it was prudent to walk and then work our way - both sampling and observing - all the way to the edge of the boulder field and really see if there is any mineralogical or compositional variation. One of the hopes for the long-term future might be that these mare have stratified mineral deposits in them like the Bushveldt in South Africa and other places. It would be a ready way to get metallic resources for use on the Moon: for example, for making the teeth for any bucket-wheel miner you might have so that you don't have to keep importing those; you could just replace the teeth with ones you make on the Moon. But we just didn't have that kind of time.
1465110||LMP|Presumably, at the rim of Camelot we were sampling the deepest material that would have been thrown up out of Camelot. So maybe it was not unexpected that what we saw was fairly uniform; it would have cooled more slowly, probably, than other material we might have found. I don't think a rake sample would have added much because, again, we were dealing with pretty uniform stuff and it was just a question of what might have been thrown in there from somewhere else. And the other rake samples were already giving us that information.
1465110||CDR|It would have been nice to have more time. Time was your greatest asset because you're there at all; and it's your greatest enemy because you don't have enough of it. I would have liked to have walked down into that crater, too, and have spent some time down in the bottom. I think it could have been very interesting. It would have been a good walk out! But it would have been interesting.
1465236||LMP|It was a mistake when I carried the charges for long distances, primarily the charge I'd carried on the traverse to Station 1 and the one I'd carried from Shorty to Victory. And, what couldn't be rectified was that my hands were already tired.
1465300||CDR|Jack was a little testy here. He was probably a little tired. And your hands do get tired from holding the camera and holding the bags.
1465413||LMP|It must have been tilted towards me - it usually was - and that made it tougher to get on.
1465446||CDR|- (Tongue in cheek) "I always parked the Rover sloping towards Jack. It didn't make it tougher; it made it easier. It was lower to him and he didn't have to jump as high to get in. All he had to do was lean uphill. That was a Commander's prerogative. I particularly liked to drive on slopes with him on the downhill side.
1465626||LMP|In the final analysis, of course, it turned out that the dark mantle - the orange and black soils that we found at Shorty - were deposited from fire fountains well before - like three and a half billion years before - either Camelot or Horatio were formed. And what gave the impression of younger age is exactly what had fooled the mappers; and that is that the dark regolith is so loose and moves so much that craters don't last very long in it. It doesn't retain small craters as long as other types of regolith do, so you get a false impression of youthfulness. And when you hit it, it spreads around and produces pretty much the same effects that you'd get from true mantling.
1470051||CDR|Adding a kilometer and a half or more to our projected travel distance from station to station is not too surprising. I call it the wander factor. When you're driving around, you've got to drive around craters; when you're driving up the scarp, you've got to take particular routes which are accessible and secure; and, when you're driving into the Sun, you've got to be extremely careful and you go around things you might not, otherwise, go around because you can't see them all that well. So it's not that surprising at all.
1470153||LMP|During the design phase there was probably some discussion over whether one really needed the flags. And the reference to the "Boss" may mean that Shepard or Slayton finally ruled that there had to be flags. I think that Gene did see the box first; and then we corrected the record, facetiously, so that it was consistent with what the Boss said we had to see first, namely the flag. Of course, I'm guessing and making this up, because I don't remember this incident.
1470727||LMP|I may have been pulling out Gene's yo-yo and taking the tongs off so that he didn't have to fool with it. It would have been easier that way.
1470900||LMP|When you switched to the Aux tank, it took a little while for either the flow of water or the water pressure - whichever the sensor worked on - to build up enough to get rid of the flag.
1470941||LMP|I was joking, of course; and I think this refers to some time in training when I accidentally kicked it.
1471106||LMP|They wanted me to press the legs into the surface. I suspect that, by this time, Joe Weber was absolutely panicked about his experiment. And there was a tendency, if I remember correctly, for me to think that they were convinced that I hadn't deployed it right, instead of suspecting that the instrument was faulty. Clearly, Bob was on our side and believed we'd done it right.
1471204||LMP|I could see the gimbal by looking through the top of the instrument. I don't know why I said 'gimbal' because I was probably looking at the balance beam.
1471223||LMP|Getting off the Rover shouldn't have made Gene breathe heavily. He may have gotten off and leaned way over to read the console. That might have cramped him a little bit and made him spit his words out.
1471307||LMP|There was a sunshade on the LSG that shadowed the hole in the top of the instrument that let it cool by radiating to the sky. Twenty degrees refers to our latitude and I guess I had to get the LSG leveled and then tilt the shade at the proper angle. It's amazing how you don't remember doing any of that. I remember going back to fix it, but not the actual deployment.
1471400||LMP|They were moving weights on the balance beam and my question was, could we do something to change the relative gravitational force on either side of the fulcrum to make it work. But I don't think they could have ever convinced themselves that it was a design problem in time to do something like that.
1472013||LMP|There's a little bell ringing in my head that I'd taken Gene's camera and tongs (at 147:06:41) just so that I could sample one of the glass-lined craters. That's probably why I didn't pay any attention to Bob when he told me to leave the camera with Gene.
1472016||LMP|Throughout training, I had used the pun 'gnomon is not an island', and Bob was one-upping me here.
1472657||CDR|The yo-yo was about an inch or two high, a rectangular box, and it had a little strap that went under something (usually a hose) and came back around and snapped on itself. I wore mine all the time, so Jack must have been wearing one, too.
1472835||LMP|I must have known - and this changes what I've said before about the observation of glass in craters on other missions - because I talked to the people doing remnant magnetism and asked them it they didn't want an oriented sample of glass in order to see if there had been any modern magnetic fields. And I don't remember their having any enthusiasm for it; but, in my mind, that was a reasonably important sample to get. And that's probably why I was manipulating things to get a sample and all the documentary photographs and why I had some concern over protecting it.
1472920||LMP|There was a brand of pills called Carter's Little Liver Pills, and there was an expression 'You've got more of such-and-such than Carter has pills.'
1472939||LMP|Bob thought he'd seen Gene throw SCB-4 to his left, not having noticed that I'd taken SCB-4 back to the Rover.
1473206||CDR|The latches were starting to stick, so I was just going to dust them to see if that would help. Jack's comment, it seems to me, was that, in a pressure suit, you can sometimes apply more force than you would normally intend to. You're not outfitted to be a brain surgeon with tweezers. So the tendency to grab hold of something and pull harder than you might want to was a real danger; and what Jack was saying was that he didn't want to pull the latches off.
1473206||LMP|You're putting pressure on the suit bladder whenever you open something, and you want to be careful. I think this is what scared a lot of us about what Scott and Irwin were doing on 15 when they were trying to get the deep core out. They got away with it; except Scott wrenched his shoulder. He's a moose anyway, but that shows you how much force they were putting on it.
1473206||CDR|Until this very moment, reading Jack's comment, it never crossed my mind that you could hurt the suit. I never had any concern about it. I had experience with suits going back to my Gemini IX EVA and the only problem was that you didn't have the feel. You could squeeze too hard or pull too quickly because you didn't have the feel - the sensitivity - in your arms and hands of whatever you were holding on to. But as far as heavy movements, like trying to get core samples out of the ground, and putting stress on the bladder, I'd never heard of that.
1473249||LMP|I can't tell you why I was going sideways here, unless it was just the way I got started. A little overshoot on my rotation.
1473249||CDR|When I was working around the MESA, there were a lot of times when I wanted, for example, to move five feet to the left, that I did not turn left and start walking straight on. I'd just slither sideways. Those were not planned maneuvers. You just do what that computer up in your head tells you to do that's most productive, safe, responsive way to make a move.
1473319||CDR|Bob got out of this one by saying "John thought that they might still be open"; and Jack came back very nicely. If Bob had said "Jack, I thought maybe you had left them open", I guarantee you that Jack would have come back with some remark to Bob. That's just the way it went. Those guys could go after each other in a very sarcastic manner sometimes.
1473500||CDR|I brought the whole fender home!
1473714||CDR|The boresight was just like a little magnifying glass and you could see rainbow-rings inside of it as you looked through it.
1473914||LMP|I may have been trying to get Gene to take an over-exposed picture into the shadowed areas on the Sculptured Hills.
1474033||CDR|Whether you're working in a pressurized suit or working in shirtsleeves, if I had to pick between zero gravity, one-sixth gravity, or full Earth gravity, in every case I'd pick one-sixth. Sometimes you'd have trouble getting as much leverage as you can on Earth; but, otherwise, one-sixth gravity makes things easier. The pressure suit, on the other hand, is a big inhibitant, particularly in restricting your dexterity. You can make the big movement and turn around and get from here to there with a step or a hop. But the things that get to you and the things that get frustrating are the little things that you can't do with you're fingers, things that you can't do with your hands. In a pressure suit, particularly from your elbows on down, you're a big, clumsy ox. You had the blue @alsjurl/apollo.glossary.html#RTV"@alsjt>RTV</a> on the fingers of the glove and, to pull the breakers, you had to force your fingers in there to get some fingertip dexterity and control through those gloves. It was just a very difficult thing to do. These were little, round, aircraft-type breakers rather than household breakers. The top of the breaker was no bigger across than the top of a pen - a half centimeter across. It was a little cylindrical breaker with a lip on it. We built them with a little more room so that you could grab onto them but, when they were pushed in they were only about a centimeter tall. They had to be set pretty tight, and it was hard to get a grip. And, besides, our hands were tired by this time.
1474040||CDR|These were @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#a17CDR_scissors"@alsjt>surgical scissors</a> with the rounded point, and they were the most common instrument in spaceflight.
1474305||CDR|From the tone of voice, you can hear that we were pretty tired. 'God damn it, let's get on with the show and stop screwing around.' You can hear the fatigue in our voices.
1474913||LMP|What would explain the two sets of tongs is that I had Gene's from when he let me off at the ALSEP and, sometime during the close-out, he took the others off the gate for some purpose. And it could be he just did it to have them in case he dropped something.
1475134||LMP|This is a play on words. I meant that finding the orange soil was a lucky break.
1475155||LMP|I was referring to the 'intimate' nature of this part of the dusting operation.
1475238||LMP|I suspect that what I started to say was that he'd been throwing dust on our suits when he made sharp turns.
1475413||CDR|Dusting was a major process. By now, we've already spent 5 minutes dusting.
1475520||CDR| (Laughing) I just read this and said to myself, 'Now what's the worst thing that could happen.' It's dropping the brush in the dust. So I'm sure that that's what happened. It's just like with the hammer. You've got to hold on tight. And when you brushed, you had to brush hard. Your hands are tired, so you drop it. I'm positive I dropped the dustbrush.
1475534||LMP|I can remember that, by the time I finished trying to dust Gene, that was it for my hands. My fingers and forearms were so fatigued that it was really hard to do anything useful in the dusting operation, because you just couldn't stroke without losing your grip on the brush. There was some pain under your nails because they had lifted off the quick, but mainly you were just fatigued and holding that brush was just the last straw. Gene didn't talk about it as much as I did; but sometimes, in listening to this, you get the impression that his hands were just as sore. That's probably why Gene dropped the brush. And the fatigue was the reason why I switched to just banging on his suit with the brush: it was easier hitting him than trying to brush. And that's when he complained. I can't believe that he felt it; but, apparently, he did.
1475711||CDR|This didn't mean that lightning was going to strike in ten minutes. If there was something to do and I had to stay out there ten or fifteen minutes longer, I still would have been very comfortable. I knew our margins were very, very conservative and I never had a concern about running out of consumables or having to scramble to get in. It wasn't like the margins we had for fuel to land the LM which you could eat up very quickly. Sometimes we were pushed up against Houston's limits on consumables but, in reality, it was never even close.
1480114||LMP|It seems from listening to the tapes that we never showed any concern whatsoever about ten minutes to go or any other limitation on getting in; and I suspect it's not only that we had certain things we had to get done but, also, we assumed - and which was correct, I think - that there were significant margins in the oxygen and coolant supply.
1480423||LMP|In training, when we went through these procedures, Gene didn't have anything to do. Somebody else handed me the pallet and I went through it, dutifully, simulating unloading and stowing material off the pallet. And, once or twice, we probably did it with the real hardware in the real LM, just to make sure it worked.
1480458||LMP|It was hard to lean down to get the things Gene's was handing in.
1480613||LMP|I may have stuck the SCBs and the rock box on their storage rails to make room for Gene. Either that or I stuck them on the engine cover.
1480613||CDR|I'll bet a million dollars that he wasn't stowing those things in the rack until we got into soft suits. It took too much time. The hatch had to go quite a ways open for me to get in so there wasn't much room under his feet, so I've got to believe that he stowed them on the engine cover.
1480848||CDR|It was just incredible in there with two guys in pressurized suits, plus all the stuff on the engine cover. It was just very difficult even to reach behind him.
1481349||LMP|Gene doesn't sound as tired as after the first EVA, but he's eager to get the gloves off. I'm sure I was tired, in part because our last stop, at Camelot, was a little tougher, physically, than some of the others because of walking through the boulders.
1481349||CDR|These were like golf gloves with no fingers. We wore them to protect the suit gloves against abrasion. They really took a beating. They weren't falling apart, but they were pretty well worn.
1481422||LMP|I think we had planned to take the cover gloves off after the ALSEP deployment because that was supposedly the major wear. But, it would seem to me that it would have been imprudent to take them off given the way they were wearing. We were pretty active - we were doing lots of stuff - and, every time you gripped something, you were abrading the cover glove with that soil. Gene's wore more quickly than mine because of the brushing and the hammering. Of course, the cover gloves made your hand's bulky. It's just like being out on the snow. The more you put on your fingers, the less mobility you have with them. The fingers are separated and the extra layers cramp you when you try to bend them. The cover gloves probably contributed to our fatigue, and they certainly affected dexterity.
1481533||LMP|It's hard to tell what was going on here, although it may have had to do with lock rings on Gene's gloves. As I recall, you pressed in on the ring and then turned. It was easy to do for yourself - when your hands weren't tired - but then you had to reverse your mind when you were doing it for somebody else, like tying somebody else's necktie.
1481533||CDR|I think there were arrows on the rings. And I do think that that is what we were doing: helping each other because it was cumbersome to unlock your own glove with a gloved hand. Once you got one off, the other one was a piece of cake to get off with your bare hand. By helping the other guy, rather than have him stretch and try to get the ring between his thumb and finger, you could take two hands and push in on the locks with your thumbs and turn the ring.
1481650||LMP|Boy, this is a classic of a discussion between two people who are looking at what they're doing and not communicating with anybody else. Maybe this was the glove lock rings.
1481703||CDR|By the time the mission was all over, my hands were nothing but blisters. The skin on my knuckles was gone. Inside the glove, all the knuckle points were constantly scrapping and, although they hurt, I guess I didn't let it bother me when we were on the surface. You're hands are so vital to everything you do that the gloves were custom fit; but we still ran into these problems. We got down to blue-collar work and you couldn't design everything for the convenience of the astronaut. On the Shuttle, I think, a lot of the equipment they're using in the Payload Bay EVAs are big things that you can hold on to. They don't have Rover breakers to pull, and sample bags to twist, and core caps to put on, and drills to run, and cores to jack out of the ground. If you went through the kind of things we did, your hands would probably get tired even if you didn't have gloves, if you didn't have to work against the pressure of the suit, if your knuckles didn't rub on the inside of the glove, if you didn't have to work with all of the layers covering your hand and your fingers, if you didn't have to work with your fingertips covered with @alsjurl/apollo.glossary.html#RTV"@alsjt>RTV</a>. Even if you took all of that away, if you look at all the work we did during those three EVAs, you would probably end up with your hands fairly tired anyway. How long can you grip a hammer and beat on a core tube and chip rocks even without gloves?
1481814||CDR|There was a definite smell of spent gunpowder. I'll never forget that.
1481925||LMP|I meant that it was the achievement of the whole Apollo team.
1482044||LMP|I was referring to the times when I was annoyed with Parker, such as at Station 3.
1482220||LMP|We were setting up the LM oxygen flow and, even though we weren't connected to the LM hoses, the system would start to filter dust out of the air.
1482745||LMP|We were recharging the PLSSs mostly just to get them out of the way. And, if you had a problem, then you'd know it right away. That's always a good philosophy: try to identify your problems early. Then they'd have all night to work it.
1485935||CDR|The odd numbered batteries were the Commander's and the even numbers were the LMP's. That way you could keep them straight. When you took a bad battery out, you'd put the new ones in the order 1,3,5 and 2,4,6 and you'd know you had the right battery at the right time.
1491334||CDR|It's amazing - like somebody remembering license plate numbers!
1491334||LMP|(Laughing) I had the sample numbers memorized in those days! I had worked very closely with the Apollo 11 samples; and, with two or three other people, I had done an introduction to the Apollo 11 Science Conference. My main contribution was to look at all of the basaltic samples and, particularly, study the minerals that lined the vesicles. And, after Apollo 12 came back, I extended that study. Bob Sutton and I gave a talk at the Apollo 12 conference in 1971 but, unfortunately, that paper has never been finished or published. We did something that had never been done before; and that was to try to relate the positions of the samples to the depth for which they were derived by the various impacts that formed craters in the vicinity of the Apollo 12 landing site. The 12 crew did an excellent job of sampling; they got a good distribution of samples. It was the only place where I think we had a chance to really look at the layering within the upper portion of the mare basalts. I need to finish that paper.
1491334||CDR|- (Tongue-in-cheek) "I want to thank Jack for supporting all my geologic observations about Gene's Rock, which looks very much like the Apollo 12 rock 12008.
1491651||LMP|They wanted to make sure we didn't get over our margins so that we wouldn't have to use the RCS (Reaction Control System) to complete the rendezvous.
1492219||LMP|By closing the regulators we stopped the flow of make-up oxygen into the cabin. The air in the cabin still circulated and, as you breathed down the oxygen and scrubbed out the carbon dioxide, you had a gradual decrease in pressure.
1494821||LMP|When you took it off, the inside of the suit was damp but there wasn't water sloshing around.
1495751||CDR|This is just pilot's talk. 'Five-by-five' just means that you're reading loud and clear.
1495756||LMP|There wasn't much Gene could do but unzip me. So he just stood back out of the way while I wiggled to extract myself. It didn't take very long as long as the inside of the suit was reasonably dry and, because the zipper was on the front, you could get out by yourself if necessary.
1495913||CDR|I think you've really got to start out clean. There weren't any special 'clean-room' precautions like you utilize when you're making computer chips or something like that. People wore coveralls and they wore coverings on their shoes so that they wouldn't drag in dirt, but it wasn't burdensome in any way. You went in in your street clothes to suit up. You just wanted to start out with a clean suit, with clean wrist bands and all your seals working. 'Start with a whole airplane. Don't leave town with only part of an airplane, because you may lose another part of it on the way.' We proved that we could put the suits on, take them off, and put them on again - repeatedly and in a very constrained and not very clean environment. We tried to dry them out and we tried to wipe wrist rings off. We tried to make sure that the quick-disconnects on the oxygen hoses were clean. We proved that we could do it because we had no other choice. That's the way it was designed. But I don't know that, the way we were treating them, we could have gone for ten EVAs and not have trouble with them. I'm sure we probably would have had trouble, as a matter of fact. With all that dust, you're going to have seals start leaking. You've already heard us talk about how hard it was to turn the wrist rings because dust was getting in them; and, if you used them a little bit more, they were going to quit working altogether. If you're talking about a lunar base, I'm sure that, after ten outings, the suits are going to have to be put on a rack to be cleaned up and oiled and a few other things. At some point you're going to have to go through a refurbishment cycle and, if you're going out every day, you'll certainly want to have a couple of suits so that, while the technicians are cleaning up one, you've got another to use. We didn't push the hardware to that limit, but I'm sure we would have run into some problems if we had.
1495913||CDR|That was one of our major concerns: care and treatment of the suits. The worst thing in the world would be to be on the lunar surface and not be able to go out because your suit has a leak in it. So we were awfully, awfully careful with those things. There weren't four guys to help you and keep you cleaned and brushed and oiled. Rather than having the suits hanging on a rack, they were laying in a bundle on the engine cover; so you took care of them the best way you could.
1503028||LMP|The trail-food-like packages of freeze-dried or dehydrated food were connected together and, as you pulled them out of the storage compartment, you were supposedly getting that day's pre-planned meal. Now, that was the case in the Command Module and, in the Lunar Module, it probably wasn't that organized and we just had large packages with the mission day indicated: LMP Day 5 or something like that.
1503207||CDR|I think our computer-based inertial navigation system was the state-of-the art. It ended up in 747's flying across the Pond (usually the Atlantic Ocean). We'd write the software for the different missions and it would take hours and hours in the simulator to wring out all the bugs in it before you would have a level of confidence in it that it could be declared operational. It's obsolete equipment today but, as far as I know, there was nothing comparable at the time in military or commercial aviation.
1503536||LMP|I was working a lot with my gold visor halfway down, just so I could see better. And they got confused when Gene or I made a comment some other place that the sunshade wouldn't come all the way down.
1503700||LMP|If we had seen 'bedded spatter' or some other clearly volcanic-looking material, they would have sent us back to Station 4. If there was any indication at all that it was a volcanic cone, we would have gone back there.
1504037||LMP|Almost certainly, I was surprised - and I think I recall it now - that they didn't want to ask more questions about EVA-2. More than likely, there were lots of questions; but the Flight Director was saying 'We've got to get them back on the timeline and get them to sleep.' We did a lot of geology debriefing when we got home but, unfortunately, we can't find the tapes or a transcript. I sat with Lee Silver and probably Muhlberger and Swann and others and recorded a lot of extra debrief.
1504201||LMP|After EVA-3, you were getting ready to go home, you'd done what you'd come to do so why worry about getting your full eight-hour rest period? You don't need eight hours of rest anyway; five was plenty, I think, for both of us. Plus, we were going to spend three days in orbit after rendezvous, so there wasn't going to be any hurry. So I think Gene was just trying to discourage them from even thinking about shortening the EVA.
1504256||CDR|We had five and a half hours to get prepared from the time we woke up to the time of lift-off and that was an enormous amount of time. We could have pushed the third night's sleep back and gotten up an hour later. And, if we did shorten the sleep, once we got back in the Command Module we could make it up.
1504256||CDR|I've said that I thought sleeping on the Moon was a big waste of time. We needed physical rest, we needed to get out of our suits, but I really wish we'd had more time to absorb what was going on. There's no human being who can consciously take in all of an experience like that while it is occurring. Subconsciously, you do retain things that you weren't aware of at the time and it takes a while for those to come out. You have to be careful that you don't develop a convenient memory and have things come out the way you might like to have them come out or in a way that makes you look like you had all the right answers beforehand. It's a very dangerous trap that you can fall into. So I wish we'd had more time to absorb things. But we had no choice; we had to rest and, as crew commander I had to maintain some discipline in our relationship with the ground. We knew we had some padding in the schedule, we knew we could go out a little longer, we knew we could sleep a little less; but the eight hours was important because, although we really only slept about four hours, we needed to think and talk and rest.
1510225||LMP|Because we spent at least a couple of hours on the Rover on this second EVA, clearly we didn't stress ourselves as much as during the first day. And we were more familiarized, so there was less emotional stress than on the first EVA, if there had been any at all. And I'll tell you, I never remember feeling anxious about anything except about the timeline and being able to get things done.
1510303||LMP|Joe was joking here. He was going to ask how hard the Rover worked. That's the way Joe thinks.
1510303||CDR|Our rates weren't all that different. (Laughing) Of course, I had to expend a lot of my energy getting Jack all squared away, so you'd probably want to take about ten percent off of my average and add it to his. I had to get his valves turned off, shove him in the hatch, help him on the Rover, pick him up when he fell. So, realistically, we've got to take that into account. (Somewhat more seriously) My rate while we were driving was about ten percent higher than Jack's and maybe that had to do with the fact that you're not a casual driver on the Rover - you're involved all the time. And I've got to believe that that shows up as an expenditure of BTU's.
1514233||CDR|I sound a little tired. It was the end of a long day. During these long periods of silence we were probably eating something, packing things away, and cleaning up a little bit. Sort of relaxing a little bit and doing our own thing; letting them know, every once in a while, where we were. And they were leaving us alone to get things prepared for our rest period. It was good. You need that kind of time.
1514821||LMP|This was one of the few chances you had to reflect a little bit. This was just a gradual wind-down from the long day. While we were filling the PLSSs and doing the other things, Gene and I chatted, mostly about what'd we'd done rather than what we'd seen. And often, I think, we were speculating about the kind of things the ground might recommend. I wish we'd talked more with the ground about the geology, but I also understand the Flight Director's position.
1521808||LMP|Gene got his @alsjurl/a12/a12.hammocks.jpg"@alsjt>hammock</a> up first and got in it, then I put mine up and got in it. There wasn't much spare space. The suits were on the engine cover under Gene's hammock and, as I recall, the helmets and visor assemblies were way at the back, sort of under the suits.
1522409||CDR|It was easy to get philosophical. I've said before that I've always felt that sleep was one of the greatest wastes of the short time we had on the Moon. You're only there for 75 hours and you sure don't want to waste twenty four of it sleeping or resting. You'd like to be doing something that would allow you to go further in learning and exploring. And, yet, you had to rest if you were going to take advantage of your physical and mental capabilities the next day. Each EVA you became more tired and you began to sleep. When I slept, I slept pretty good. I don't know, maybe I got three or four good hours of sleep. So a lot of the time you'd just lay there and think. Just before you'd gone to bed, you'd look out the window and see the flag and the Massif and the Earth. There you were, a quarter of a million miles from Earth, laying in a hammock in a little tin can. 'Here I am; I'm really on the Moon. What should I be doing that I'm not doing? How can I take advantage of this? Is it real? Is it a dream?' I've always said that looking back at Earth was a link with reality from a place that was almost like a dream. During the rest of the mission you get caught up with all the things that you've got to do: checking out the PLSS, checking out the LM, doing the geology, driving. You get so caught up with what you're doing that you could be almost anywhere. So you've got to take time out sometime during the mission to think about where you are and what you're doing. You could do a little of that during the EVAs themselves. While Jack was dusting me off I could take a look around at the Massifs and the flag and the Rover and it was a pretty big chunk to swallow. So it was easy to get philosophical.
1602634||CDR|This was probably the first time I'd heard the Aggie War Hymn in my life and it really didn't impress me all that much. You can tell that in my tone of voice. So when I said 'I want you to say it first,' I meant 'Whatever you're going to say, let's get it done and over with.' I wish I knew what Jack thought of that.
1602640||CDR|Gerry went to Texas A&amp;M and he's a big Aggie (supporter). Now maroon is an Aggie color, but orange happens to be a (University of) Texas color. A&amp;M and Texas are always at odds. If we had found blue dirt, it would have been better than finding orange dirt. That's a big deal around Houston.
1602640||LMP|There were a lot of Aggies in the Control Room, but Gerry Griffin was the head Aggie.
1602720||CDR|Sometimes you're asleep and it's the wake-up call that gets you up; and other times you're up and taking care of things without bothering the ground. Here, we'd had a couple of hard days on the Moon and had one day to go. The adrenaline probably started pumping a little while later; but I would expect that a little bit of the edge had worn off. We were pretty tired, physically, at the end of each one of those days, and you don't get the best rest in the world in a situation like that. You rest and you sleep; but you lay there half the time asking yourself if there isn't something else you could do instead of try to sleep. It was enough sleep to keep you going, but I don't know how good a rest it was. I probably had my comm helmet hanging up next to my hammock and, when Gordo called, sat up Indian style. One-sixth g gave you some facility to move around, even in those tight quarters.
1604424||LMP|I remember that Gene was looking at the Earth through the rendezvous window. You couldn't see it out the front unless you got down and most of the time we were standing. The suits were on the engine cover, so you'd just stand and lean. In one-sixth g it was no big deal to stand forever.
1604424||CDR|There wasn't much room to sit anywhere, except on the suits, and that was one thing we didn't want to do (because of the danger of getting dust into the zippers and rings.)
1604507||LMP|I doubt if anybody on the Moon would have told the doctors if there was a problem, just to make sure that there would be no glitches on getting out for the third EVA. Our hands and fingers were sore from the lifted fingernails. If you touched them, they were very sensitive. I don't recall that there was continuous ache. I think it was only when you hit your nails on something. I wore @alsjurl/glove.jpg"@alsjt>thin nylon liners</a> in my gloves to try to protect my fingernails. Without the liners, I was uncomfortable with my sweaty hand against the rubber. We didn't have the water cooling out into the fingers - just up to the wrist. You're hands didn't get hot, but you did perspire.
1604507||CDR|As I've said, I don't remember my fingernails giving me as much of a problem as blisters on my knuckles. I've got such a fat hand. But I do remember that the lunar dust penetrated well down into the quick. It took three, four, five, six weeks for the lunar dust to grow out. So the dust was able to get in there; I just don't remember any pain from the fingernails being lifted off. My main recollection is of my knuckles being rubbed raw.
1604511||CDR|If you go from the extremes of the first EVA to the third EVA, I can tell you that when I was working with my hands out in the Sun, I could feel the heat penetrate during that third EVA that I could not feel during the first EVA. Sun angle did have a significant effect. I don't know if the data show that we used more cooling in our PLSSs during that third EVA.
1604659||LMP|The Lunar Orbiter team discovered mascons in the Doppler tracking data. They found that the lunar gravitational field is not uniform; and, specifically, that there are concentrations of mass under the most circular - i.e., the youngest - of the large basins and mass deficiencies under the rims of those basins - notably Serenitatis, Nectaris, Crisium, Imbrium, Orientale. The computer model that fits is one that has the mantle of the Moon - at about 60 kilometers depth - slightly raised under the basins and with a bit of a deficiency around them. It's like an incipient water splash. The rebound from the impact that formed the basin has caused the mantle beneath the center of the impact to rise slightly. Plus, the effect of that little rise is accentuated by the flat plate of dense material represented by the lunar mare. As I remember, the lunar mare has density of about 3.4 grams per cubic centimeter, whereas the surrounding highlands have a compacted density of about 2.9. So it's a significant contrast. One of the more interesting aspects of it is that the old, irregular mare basins don't have mascons. And that suggests that between the formation of the old, irregular basins and the young, circular basins, something fundamental changed in the lunar crust. It became stronger - a lot stronger - so that, in the younger basins, there was no compensation for (or relaxation as a result of) these density differences as apparently there was early on. And the change presumably occurred over a fairly short period of time around 3.9 billion years ago when most of the young, circular basins formed. There's a lot of controversy raging about whether all of the 45 to 50 basins formed at just about the same time. I'm of the belief that that can't have happened, in part, because you have this very distinct strengthening of the crust beneath the mascon basins.
1604659||LMP|The flight dynamics people anticipated that, because of the micro accelerations and decelerations associated with the mascons along the path of the Command Module, you would get a perturbation of the orbit. So, after Ron dropped us off, he had a burn that put him into an orbit which, upon perturbation, would become a 60-mile circular orbit by the time we were ready to launch. They thought they could predict how the mascons would perturb the orbit - clever people, these Americans - but the mascons wouldn't co-operate. Their gravitational model was not sufficient to make those predictions. The main reason (for the inadequacies of the model) was that they couldn't track spacecraft as they orbited over the Farside and, consequently, they didn't have any information about Farside mascons. One of my reasons in proposing a Farside landing on Apollo 17 - when I tried to persuade NASA to let us land in Tsiolkovsky - was that you'd have to put together a communications system; and that would allow you to track the Farside orbits and gain additional knowledge about the Farside mascons. I suspect that there aren't very many. Tsiolkovsky is probably one of the few, because there just aren't many young, fresh, circular basins on the Farside. I suspect they've all compensated except for Tsiolkovsky and one or two others.
1604659||LMP|After the crew was finalized in the fall of '71, for the second time I tried to persuade Chris Kraft and others that we ought to consider a Farside landing. I had brought it up before - after Apollo 13 - as the culmination of the last four missions going to the places where everybody always wanted to go: Tycho, Orientale, the North Pole, and the Farside. I had fun trying to justify that mission to people. But everybody was so wrapped up in proving that they could survive the Apollo 13 failure and get Apollo 14 landed, that it didn't get much play. I worked it for a while, anticipating that just one more landing wouldn't help the politics of the space program very much. I wanted to build up to some sort of crescendo that would not only provide good science but would provide public interest. When I brought it up again in August or September of 1971, I went so far with the Lunar Mafia - the group of people at JSC who thought up these 'dumb' things to do on their own time - as to work out how to do it. Some of the guys in Flight Control were able to track down a couple of on-the-shelf Tiros satellites that could act as communications satellites. The plan was to place those, with a single Titan launch, at the Farside libration point. There's a libration point about 30,000 miles behind the Moon where things will stay, at least for a while, if you put them there. Except in very weird circumstances, satellites at the libration point would give you a direct link with Earth; and the two satellites gave you redundancy. It was a great plan. TRW quoted a price of about $80 million and I had added a $20 million contingency. And we had other plans. In one, as you went around the Moon in the Command Module, you'd drop off a bunch of small communications relay satellites, rather like the current Iridium scheme. (Laughing) But, finally, Chris called me in and said 'Shut up; quit talking about this. We're not going to spend a hundred million dollars to put a communications satellite behind the Moon for the last mission.' I'm not sure where the numbers came from, but the marginal cost of building the hardware for an Apollo mission was about $250 million and I was told that operational costs - to run the centers and the tracking stations, etc. - were about the same number.
1604659||CDR|Aside from the cost and the probability of having to delay the flight, management simply wasn't going to take the risk of sending us to the back side of the Moon. It would have been a challenge and would have been worthwhile doing, but we still had a lot to learn about the front side. I was involved in discussions at the level of Chris Kraft and George Low and it quickly became obvious that it wasn't going to happen. Jack used to go on crusades like this and get other people involved and go into the details of how to do it and what it was going to cost. And that was good. But Jack used to have the habit of pushing people and pushing people without knowing - politically or diplomatically - when to quit. And, finally, Chris got fed up.
1604838||LMP|The normal rendezvous procedure was for the LM to be active and rendezvous with the CSM. And a CSM rescue would have been the case of where, for some reason, all the LM could do was get to orbit; and then it would have been a CSM-active rendezvous which would, of course, have taken lots more CSM fuel.
1604838||CDR|The LM had to get into some minimum, sustainable orbit. For a normal launch time, most likely it would have been a fuel problem that would have forced a Command Module rescue. For example, if your ascent engine shut down early and you got close to orbit and you had to expend most of your RCS fuel to get into that sustained orbit then, obviously, you would have done it. You would have used all the fuel you had to get into orbit; and then you'd rely on the Command Module to come get you. I always felt that a Command Module rescue was a remote possibility, although one that you had to maintain a fuel reserve for. The reason I say that it was a remote possibility is that, in most cases, you would have done the rendezvous even without the radar. The Command Module had a Doppler device and other systems to give us information and there was manually- and computer-derived information. The LM was a much better rendezvous vehicle than the CSM and, unless there was a fuel problem, there was little chance of having to do a Command Module rescue. And, even in the case of a fuel problem, the chances of you getting just high enough that, if the ascent engine shut down early, you had enough RCS fuel to add the amount of velocity to get a sustained orbit were small. You had to get into an orbit that wouldn't decay in five or six revs. And if you only got into an orbit that would decay in one or two revs, it would have been all over. The rescue was a time-consuming process. Now, for an emergency situation - which I always thought would have to have been a fairly catastrophic situation - it would have been a manual launch because of the inertial navigation system being powered down. You couldn't sit on an emergency on the lunar surface, but you could sit on an emergency once you got into orbit, because the Command Module did have that capability to come down and get you.
1604838||CDR|Of course, there were other reasons why we might have had to leave the lunar surface early. We could have been perfect but there could have been a problem with the Command Module which said 'guys, the Command Module's going to have to go home pretty quick, so you'd better get your ass off the lunar surface and get back there or he's going to go home without you. God forbid there had been an Apollo 13-type problem while the Lunar Module was on the surface, because I don't think any of us would have gotten home. But there might have been some other kind of problem in the Command Module: Ron could have gotten sick, a fuel cell could have gone out, you could have lost redundancy in your ability to start the Service Propulsion engine. And I guarantee you that, if you lose the redundancy to fire that engine, the ground is not going to allow you to stay there for three days. They're going to take you off the surface, you're going to rendezvous, and your going to come home. So it wasn't just a potential problem on the surface that we had to be prepared for; it was the other spacecraft as well. And that's always going to be the case with lunar travel. You've got to look at the entire system, not just at yourself. The suits, the backpacks, the amount of fuel you're using. One effects the other. If we'd blown one of our suits for some reason, had gotten in safely, and had gotten back to orbit but with only one good suit, we would have blown Ron Evans' EVA. With only two good suits, you couldn't depressurize the Command Module and all of that data that Ron had up there (in the SIM Bay) would have been lost. It wouldn't have been an emergency situation, per se, but it is typical of how interdependent the two spacecraft were.
1612348||LMP|What comes to mind is that the bags for each meal were stacked together and taped. So what I was probably using was that tape. It was tape on plastic or whatever those bags were made of; so, when you pulled the tape off it was still good. Boy! I'd forgotten that that was what I used. But it certainly was better than grey (duct) tape because it was thinner. And the grey tape may have still been out in the Rover, anyway. Actually, I'm surprised that the ground hadn't come up with a fix, because that was a major deficiency in that second EVA.
1612856||LMP|The surface of the dark mantle at the 17 site looks young relative to the age that was actually measured because it such fine-grained material. When you get an impact you may get a little of the regolith breccia - that we used to call 'instant rock' - but, for the most part, you're just distributing fine-grained materials - the Dunkirk Effect. You form a crater and then the crater subdues immediately because of the slumping of the fine-grained material. In World War II, when the Germans tried to bomb the British Expeditionary Force that was evacuated from Dunkirk, the sand absorbed the effects of their bombs. Unless they got a direct hit on somebody, very few people got hurt. If the British had tried to evacuate from a rocky coastline, they never would have made it. I just coined the name: the Dunkirk Effect. I don't know why I thought of it; but, basically, the impacts in the mantle were hitting into a great big sandpile and, unless they were really big ones and were getting down to the underlying basalt and threw up some rocks, the craters were not going to look fresh in the terms that we think of when they hit hard rock. The age of a surface is based on the number of craters that you see and, in this dark mantle, craters three to five times the thickness of the mantle tend to disappear very fast and not even be counted. So you count fewer craters of a given size. If you could do it accurately, you'd probably see a knee in the curve. In the large crater fraction, the counts would match the old age. And then there would begin to be a fall off as you got smaller and smaller.
1613004||CDR|This is typical of Parker and Schmitt. Jack would normally elaborate and this abrupt "Yes" was his way of getting back at Bob.
1613601||LMP|We hadn't planned to range along the base of the South Massif and didn't. And, in retrospect, we didn't do too badly in getting a fair variety at Station 2. Each of the three or four rocks we looked at in some detail was different. What we didn't get was which one was most representative.
1614117||CDR|During these long comm breaks we were just busy doing things. You could always listen but, unless you were on VOX, it was sometimes inconvenient to key the switch to tell what you were doing. It was more efficient to just get it done. You know they're there and that you can talk to them if you need to.
1624953||CDR|My PLSS was stowed on the port bulkhead at my left shoulder with the (U.S.) flag outboard so that I could just back into it. I'm almost positive that Jack's was stowed on the floor by the hatch with the flag up and the surface that interfaces against the body down against the deck. There were some interim stowage bags hanging in front of the Commander's PLSS which we just threw in the back to get them out of the way.
1625454||CDR|He had a signal strength meter and control knobs for pitch and yaw so that he could tweak up the signal. He must have hit one of the knobs.
1625846||CDR|On the surface, our antenna pointing didn't change but, throughout the flight when we changed attitudes, they would give us pitch and yaw for the (high-gain) steerable. This was true in the Command Module, too. If we were behind the Moon, they'd have given us a pitch and yaw so that when we came around the limb, we'd pick them up immediately.
1630040||LMP|All through this prep, it sounds like we had a pretty good rest. Compared with how we sounded at the end of the second EVA, it had obviously done us some good. Geno may not sound as rested as he has at other times, but I sound pretty normal.
1630040||CDR|- (Tongue in cheek) "Once you experience the responsibility of command, you realize that you never get as much sleep as the crew does. The crew's welfare comes first, before your own personal comfort.
1630835||LMP|There were two settings on the valves. Low Flow was for make-up and High Flow was for use if you had a hole in the suit.
1630857||CDR|It isn't in the check list but, while I was putting in his purge valve, he might have taken the @alsjurl/water_gun.jpg"@alsjt>water gun</a> (photo by Mick Hyde) to get a drink, just to saturate himself." See, also, the confirming statement at 163:11:51
1630908||CDR|I don't know if he dropped the water gun or I dropped one of his hoses.
1630956||CDR|Maybe someone would think, 'Master Alarm! Emergency lift-off'! But, with all these reconfigurations, we'd get them periodically.
1631209||CDR|I think that these straps were attached there so that we could do a quick release in case we had to get in (the cabin) in a hurry.
1631534||CDR|When you snapped your helmet in, there was an L-shaped lip and you wanted to make sure that overlapping piece was flush. So, when you felt all the way around, if it wasn't snapped in properly, you could feel it. If it wasn't flush, that would indicate that it had gotten in kattiwampus (meaning, out of alignment or out of kilter) - that it may have locked the front but it didn't snap in and lock in the back. It was easier for us to feel each other's and it was very important to get the helmet on right. So we double verified it, just like we verified all those things. You don't want to go out with half a spacesuit. You don't want to have one little flaw, one little leak that might compromise your safety or your ability to get the job done.
1631550||CDR|The @alsjurl/alsj-LEVA.html"@alsjt>LEVA</a> didn't shift around very much, but it did have a little lock to keep it in place.
1631842||CDR|We each had a stainless steel mirror on a Velcro strap. Mine was on my right wrist. The mirror was as much a part of the spacesuit as the watch was. We wore mirrors from Gemini right on through the whole program. It was the only way you could see the connectors on the front of your suit and, as I remember, things were written backwards so you could read them in the mirror. You could use the mirror to see things above you, behind you. We found it was invaluable in Gemini but they were afraid of glass so we had polished stainless steel mirrors. It was a square mirror, maybe three by three inches.
1632216||CDR|I used the hammer so much that, in some spots on the handle, I literally wore off the @alsjurl/apollo.glossary.html#RTV"@alsjt>RTV</a> coating. You can surmise anything you want from that: I was squeezing it to death; or I was holding it loose and it was slipping back and forth in my hand; or whatever.
1632615||LMP|There were some gold-colored, yard-long lines connected to the utility lights and, since the clamps were outside on the fender, the lines may have been dangling. Or, I could have been referring to the LM hoses.
1632647||LMP|I will always be surprised that the suits held up as well as they did to the abuse we gave them. Just think about what we were doing and the dust environment we exposed them to. We tried to clean the bearings and plug the holes (that is, the connectors) and things like that; and they really did well, just like everything else we had in the Apollo program did better than anybody ever expected it to. And I think that just goes back to the motivation of the people who were building it and testing it and flying it. It makes a lot of difference if people believe it's the most important thing they're going to do in their lives and they don't want to be responsible for screwing it up.
1632953||LMP|Gene was going to lean down to get the @alsjurl/forward_hatch.jpg"@alsjt>hatch</a>. I was facing him and he wanted me to lean toward the rear of the spacecraft to maximize the room he'd have to get down. It was tough to get down there and get a hold of the hatch.
1632953||CDR|Once we had the suits up to 3.8, we moved around like tin soldiers (meaning very stiffly). 'You move a little bit, and I'll move a little bit.' From this point on, where you've got two people with the pressurized suits and the PLSSs on and the hoses on, a guy moving six inches left or right or six inches fore or aft meant a great deal to the ability of the other guy to reach something.
1633024||CDR|I can see in my mind Jack turning a little bit so that he could see the circuit breaker panel, and then his PLSS is hitting me right smack in the face.
1633049||CDR|Jack is getting as far over on his side (and as far forward) as he can, so that I can get back and up to get the overhead valve.
1633101||CDR|The shoulder bearing really restricted your movements and I may have even been up on my tiptoes to get high enough. If we had been in a round room or a square room it might have been different. But we were in a room with all kinds of shapes and corners in our way. And we, ourselves, were very bulky and non-conforming shapes.
1633353||CDR|At five psi you might just as well have been in a block of concrete. Going down to 3.7 or 3.8 gave me a lot of flexibility that I didn't have at 5 to get down and open the hatch. When you went down to open the hatch, you're literally straining against the suit. So I didn't want to get down until my suit was down. And, also, there was no point in getting down to get it until the cabin was down enough that you could open it.
1633510||LMP|One of the big issues for any kind of permanent lunar habitat is going to be dust control. And it just occurred to me that the design of the air/dust lock ought to be such that, when you depress to go out on an EVA, the air currents remove the dust you brought in the last time. Never thought of that before, and I've been dealing with this - along with a lot of other people - for a long time. I ought to patent that idea.
1633519||CDR|Once I was able to open the hatch against whatever residual pressure there was, if I didn't hold it open the pressure would slam it shut again. So I had to hold it open until the cabin relieved totally.
1633811||LMP|There was a little bag called the 'purse' where we stowed the purge valves between EVA's.
1633903||CDR|It was a strain getting out. It was easier for Jack because there was only one person and his suit's had longer to come down. I'm still at 4.3, here, with a very stiff suit.
1633911||LMP|We had a piece of Velcro put on the inside of the helmet that we reached over and scratched our nose on. Everybody seemed to agree that you needed that. Also, the mention of the @alsjurl/a11/a11.lec.gif"@alsjt>LEC</a> reminds me of a lot of work we did - probably pre-Apollo 11 and probably Jack Small and myself, mostly - trying to devise some kind of a conveyor system to get stuff in and out of the cabin. There was some concern that it would be too difficult to carry stuff up and, at one point, we were actually trying to devise a loop one could use as a conveyor: attach something to it and then take it through a pulley. We got it so that you could do it but, in the final analysis, it was more trouble than it was worth.
1634153||CDR|It had become a little prayer at the start of those EVA's. I just shouted to the world, "God, bless us. Give us a shot at it." I'm beginning to think that there wasn't anything printed or written anywhere on that ladder. And if Jack doesn't recall it, it wasn't there. I think I just decided to say that when we started every EVA. Sort of like blessing the shrimp fleet.
1634425||LMP|During Apollo, the answer to Gene's question was very simple: you weren't going to go back there any time soon. But at a lunar base, any used material will have to be inventoried, catalogued, and stored in some kind of recoverable way because the value of practically any material will, because of transportation costs, be very, very high - at least until the Moon is self-sufficient and is producing it's own stuff. And that won't be for a long time. You're just never going to know when you're going to want to get something and, with a good inventory system, you can always ask 'Do I have that or something like it for refurbishment or reuse.'
1635152||LMP|I may have been thinking that we didn't want any more dust under the seat.
1640128||LMP|You could dust the SEP mirrors, but you really couldn't get the dust out of the cover. So the tape wouldn't stick to the cover to hold it closed.
1640418||LMP|I was thinking of the fine-grained, vesicular rock that Gene picked up at Shorty.
1640434||LMP|The SEP P.I.'s name was really (David) Strangway, but Bob called him 'Strangelove' (after the title character of the 1964 Stanley Kubrick film 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb')
1640434||CDR|They were pretty badly abraded, but not cut or torn.
1640629||LMP|Gene is several inches taller than I am and reaching up to that level was tough in the suit.
1640748||LMP|All the equipment was on the back of the Rover, so that's where we stood. And, unfortunately, that meant that we did most of this Geoprep work out of sight. It's too bad we didn't think about that.
1641330||LMP|My guess is that I wanted them to record or time my running motion as I was going out to the SEP transmitter.
1641516||CDR|It was pretty obvious to me that I wasn't rolled ten degrees, and I just ignored it, I guess.
1641621||CDR|Cross City was a VOR station west of Gainesville Florida. Tyndall is near Panama City. We flew that way from Cape all the time. Patrick (Air Force Base near the Cape), Cross City, Tyndall, and whatever to Ellington (Air Force Base in Houston). That's why I remembered the heading. I used to have that flight plan engraved in my brain.
1641749||CDR|I had to physically look back. The mirror wouldn't have given me that kind of view.
1641817||LMP|You would expect to see fine-grained basalts at the top of the subfloor because of the higher cooling rates; and the paucity of fine-grained samples probably was the result of our being in a cluster of fairly large craters - enough of them that the majority of material thrown out of them was the coarser-grained material from the interior of the presumably thick flow where the cooling was slow. We ultimately found a few, but there just weren't very many. So, not only was the top of the flow the first to be pulverized (which, if all the fragments were ground down into regolith, would contribute to the lack of fine-grained samples), but they were further diluted by the excavation of these large craters that some people think were part of a ray from Tycho.
1641838||CDR|This is a particularly good example of me talking louder to Bob than to Jack. It was a habit I had the entire time on the lunar surface. It was almost as if, because they were further away, I almost had to shout - that Earth was so far away that I wanted to make sure they could hear me. They probably didn't even need a radio to hear me.
1641838||CDR| @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21513"@alsjt>21513</a>, is an impressive picture to me. You've got the antennas pointed low over the South Massif to give you an idea how low to the horizon the Earth was. And I guess what really impresses me is that the Rover is so big in the forefront and yet, unless you have an appreciation for how big the LM is, you have no sense of how far away it is. You've got the SEP and the LM in the picture and, frankly, unless you know what you're looking at, you can't judge sizes very well. There are some boulders in the picture that appear to be farther away than the LM, so they must be really big.
1641838||LMP|This picture is a pretty good illustration of how, even just this far behind the LM, the material kicked up by our feet is almost the same albedo as the undisturbed soil. This contrasts with what you can see ahead and to the left of the LM, which is an area which was significantly lightened.
1642045||CDR|(laughing as he thinks about it) - This was probably the first time Jack said "Excuse me" since we got assigned to the crew! Record that for posterity. Obviously, old Twinkletoes, when he jumped on the Rover, probably almost knocked me out (of the Rover). I'm sure that's what happened. But I got even. When I drove on the sides of hills, I always put him on the bottom side. Always! On every hairpin turn, we went around with him on the bottom side.
1642157||CDR|We were supposed to drive parallel to the antenna lead and I probably got too close to it and it was easy enough to do a 360 (degree turn and go back) and do it again.
1643333||CDR|In listening to Jack's descriptions in here while I'm driving, he's doing an excellent job. For someone who can't remember a great deal about it - about the craters and boulders - it brings a very descriptive picture to my mind. Jack, being the geologist, was better equipped to describe this stuff. But, boy, as you can tell from some of the comments, driving takes your full concentration. Every once in a while I could make a comment about something; but, once you start looking around - and you're moving at 6 or 8 or 10 kilometers per hour - peripherally you don't have the contrast to see obstacles and holes and craters. They don't stand out. They blend into the countryside and you've got to be looking for them or you don't see them. So you learn very quickly that you don't go rubbernecking as you drive. Everywhere you go - and it doesn't just have to be while you're in a boulder field - there's a hole or a pit or a rock or something. And, to some degree that may limit my recall because I was narrowly focused on a path and on a direction and on a destination. Jack, on the other hand, could back off and look at the big picture. And that was a good situation. You had two people, with one looking at the big picture and one getting you there. And it explains why don't I remember Turning Point Rock when I do remember taking the pan at Tracy's Rock (at Station 6, see below). There, I remember how steep that hill was; I remember having to crawl up that hill; and I remember having to watch my footing as I was taking the pan. That, I remember. I was taking in the big picture then. But I don't have any impression of driving up to Turning Point Rock or to Tracy's Rock. I was probably intent on driving and I don't have any recollection about any of this until I got off the Rover. The only exception is that I do recall the boulder tracks because I could drive and take a moment to look at those.
1643443||CDR|We had the low-gain antenna lead velcroed to the staff and that may have come off.
1644531||CDR|That's big! I'm obviously impressed with how big it is. Jack says 'Gee, that's a big rock;' and all of a sudden I'm counting 'One, two, three...' All of a sudden I'm eighteen feet high! That's a big rock. And I hate to admit it, but I just cannot picture that rock in my mind. Now, the color pictures I took (AS17-140-21396 to 21398) do bring back some memories. And it may be that I remember because we'd stopped to take the pictures.
1644734||LMP|From my description, it sounds like Turning Point Rock was the same kind of rock as the north half of the Split Boulder (at Station 6). That boulder was two kinds of rock: a vesicular breccia that had intruded a blue-grey breccia. My first instinct here was to call it a vesicular breccia (@alsjurl/a17/#1644457"@alsjt>164:44:57</a> and @alsjurl/a17/#1644636"@alsjt>164:46:36</a>), and then I backed off from that.
1644806||CDR|260 meters out of 250 thousand miles ain't bad! They ought to give you that much leeway.
1644941||CDR|Here we have the responsibilities of command, again. Always watching out for your crew. And Jack deserved every minute of it. And I'll tell you one thing, I got myself on the downslope a couple of times and in one-sixth gravity...I won't say it's uncomfortable; but the Rover is so free to move, so free to bounce, that it seemed if you so much leaned an arm out you'd tip over. The slopes got very noticeable. Now, on a 45 degree slope, sometimes, you'd think you were going straight up. I compare it to bombing runs. You could be in a 60 degree run and you'd absolutely know that you were going straight down at 90 degrees. You always tend to overestimate your angle. If you were looking for a 30 degrees bombing run, you might be at 15 and think you were at 30. And it was the same way here. A 15 or 20 degree slope can be awfully steep when you're on it.
1645034||LMP|I didn't know what I was going to see on the other side of the block at this point, so I told them that we could work in the shade. You got quite a bit of diffuse light, particularly on a down-Sun face because the Sun backscatters directly on it. You can see pretty well, as some of the photos show.
1645240||CDR|Even the pan I took from up above Tracy's Rock doesn't really show you the slope; but the comments do. And we were parked cross slope, pointed roughly east, because they wanted us pointed 107. I had to get off uphill, and it was really pretty hard to get off. Jack said he almost rolled to the bottom of the hill. It was almost like parking in San Francisco, except we were parked side slope. Now, when we got back on, it was just the opposite: it was very difficult for him to get on and it was very easy for me. We might have wanted to park uphill or downhill, but we parked at their heading for battery cooling.
1645240||CDR|Working on hillsides wasn't something that you couldn't handle. Let's face it, you're on the Moon, it's a new environment, and all of a sudden you're on a hill. It wasn't something that you didn't expect. It's like you get on an airplane and you go to San Francisco and you sort of know what to expect. But you go and park on one of those hills and you still say "Wow"! In one sense, we were trying to relate to the people who were listening what we were confronted with, because they couldn't see any of it.
1645447||LMP|I had worked out a rule of thumb that the glass color was indicative of composition. The glass in anorthosite - feldspar - was translucent white; and if you have any amount of @alsjurl/apollo.glossary.html#mafic"@alsjt>mafic minerals</a> at all, you're going to get darker color to black. I think that, right here, I'm mouthing off, getting my bearings, and don't really have things sorted out as yet.
1645521||LMP|The flattened vesicles indicate that the rock was flowing while it was molten, but was still too stiff to allow the vesicles to take a spherical shape." See AS17-141- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21629"@alsjt>21629</a>
1645658||LMP|Because of Shorty, they were thinking that another fairly dark, fresh-looking crater (Van Serg) might have some volcanic material around it. Of course, when we got there, it was just another impact crater into a very thick regolith with some dark-mantle material in its wall. As I recall - and we'll see - we never used the short can there. I don't recall.
1645658||LMP|I was close to it to see better in the shadow, to keep my eyes out of the Sun.
1650233||CDR|It's not just walking uphill that's difficult, it's walking sidehill, too. In one-sixth gravity your stability changes and you need a new approach. You have to work at it a little harder.
1650233||LMP|(Laughing) My hands must not have been tired. And you learn how.
1650446||CDR|The video of our work at this station really shows what it takes to work on a slope in the confines of a pressure suit. You can see that our movements are totally different than they were on the flat and level ground. If you start stepping downhill, your center of gravity shifts. You could hear me talking about leaning over the Rover to dust things. If you do it from the top side, you're going to fall down over the Rover. If you do it from the bottom side, you can't quite reach that far. And, if you do it cross hill, you've got a similar problem. I think this whole station is a good example of working in a sloped environment in one-sixth gravity. You don't have boulder fields to trip over, but you've got an undulating, sloped surface you're trying to work on. I haven't seen this in a long time. You look at the TV picture and the bodies are all cocked at 15 or 20 degrees. It's totally different from anything else we've seen. Now, granted, the Rover is on a slope as well and that probably accentuates it. But the combination of the TV and our comments really tell the story.
1650542||LMP|I was trying to get as far under the boulder as I could.
1650556||CDR|I wasn't holding it in a way to make it difficult for him, it was just suit restriction. You seek out the most convenient and least restrictive positions while reaching out far enough and low enough. From his point of view, it would have been most convenient if I got down on my knees and held the bag, but only if I could have stayed there for ten minutes. But you take a sample and then you move ten feet; you take another sample and then you move again. So, unless he's going to go back and forth, you have to move together and you both have to be on your feet. It's a compromise.
1650610||LMP|I'm surprised that, with me moving like that, the soil stayed in the scoop. And I was reaching upslope some, so it was a tough maneuver.
1650638||LMP|There is more TV coverage at this station than I thought. I had forgotten that we had sampled together for a while. What I remember is being alone, working on the contact between the two breccias (the vesicular and non-vesicular materials described at 164:57:06) while Gene was taking some pans.
1650844||CDR|It was just easier to bend my knees like a guy with a bad back might do. It was just easier to bend my knees to let my arms down low enough. You learn very, very quickly. The human being is very adaptable. You don't have to think about those things; you just do it. Somehow, that computer up above your neck just picks out the easiest approach.
1651539||LMP|It's fairly clear from the tape that, during this period when Bob was taking to us, it was the wrong time because he made it difficult for us to talk to each other and we were trying to get some sampling done. And that's probably why I was fairly short, responding with just an 'Okay'. Now, I suspect we continued to work while he was talking; I don't think we stood around. Of course, I'm not sure when would have been a good time to interrupt us. (Laughing) Even though we asked the question, we probably didn't want an answer.
1651539||CDR|I want to emphasize the point. We never stood around and listened. We never stopped doing what we were doing. We could listen while we were taking a pan or getting a sample or whatever it was.
1651945||LMP|A good layman's translation of 'aplitic' is a coarse, sugary texture - like raw sugar.
1652128||LMP|I was trying to get a sample in Gene's SCB and he must have been upslope of me. So I probably handed it to him so that he could put it in my SCB.
1652137||LMP|They would have asked us if it wasn't right but, probably, one bag came from one side of the pack and one from the other.
1652210||LMP|-"The boulder didn't split along the contact, largely because the vesicular breccia (which is referred to here as 'vesicular anorthositic gabbro') was intruded as partially-molten material. It was hot enough to metamorphose about a meter of the blue-gray breccia it intruded. You could tell that because there were small vesicles - which indicate some partial melting - in that contact zone which then died out as you got away from the contact.
1652514||LMP|I don't know what this was, unless my watch band was coming loose or something like that.
1652858||CDR|I haven't seen the rock from this perspective in nearly nineteen years. My hand print really shows you how big the rock is and, in @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21482"@alsjt>21482</a>, you can see across to the South Massif and the Scarp. The Scarp looks small in this photo, but I remember how big it was (80 meters) because we went up it.
1652858||CDR|It was on this part of the rock that Al Bean wrote "Tracy", my daughter's name, in one of his paintings. After we came home I started to see a picture of the boulder in lots of places. It was the picture of Jack going past the corner of the rock (@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21496"@alsjt>21496</a>), one of the pictures from my pan. It became very popular. One day Al Bean came by and said he was doing a painting of it. And it was a big painting, six feet by three feet or something like that. Al likes to have stories in his paintings and he wanted to talk about it. So we talked about the slope and how hard it was to climb up there and I said that, if I'd known the picture was going to get so much notoriety, I wished I would have done something that I hadn't even thought of at the time. And that is to have printed Tracy's name in the dust. Al's daughter Amy and Tracy had grown up together and he asked 'How would you have done it'. So I wrote it out on a piece of paper and, some time later, he called and wanted me to come over and look at what he'd done. He had erased the place where I'd taken the sample and had put in Tracy's name, instead. And in the little story he put with the picture, he said that he'd done it to save me the trouble of going back to do it myself, and to save the taxpayers the expense of sending me back.
1652858||LMP|I was having trouble getting up to exactly where I wanted to be to look at the boulder.
1652858||CDR|I can't see why a geologist would jump up and down in the air like this except to show his enthusiasm over finding a new and different rock. And, all joking aside, it really looks like he's trying to get closer to the rock and the slope made it hard to move.
1653102||LMP|Plus, he's taller than I am. That was always a problem.
1653401||CDR|You really had to lean to get the horizon in the pan. And I don't think I was able to get the uphill pictures.
1653520||CDR|I wish I'd climbed to the top of the mountain to get even a better view. But, even where we were it was a much better panorama than we got from the Scarp. We couldn't see much from the Scarp. Over here, we could see everything: Challenger, the Scarp, the Sculptured Hills, and everything. I do remember this. It was fantastic - like coming over a hill and getting a look into a great big valley somewhere in the middle of Idaho.
1653520||LMP|In order to find a level place, Gene went to a crater and stood, not in the bottom, but on the downslope wall which would be nearly level.
1653531||LMP|This examination of the boulder shows the evolution of my thinking as I was getting new information. The final impression that I had - which was born out by the samples - was of a blue-gray breccia intruded by - or enclosed by, we don't know which - vesicular, tan-gray material which also turned out to be a breccia. Now, when I first approached the boulder, the vesicles and crystals I could see in the matrix around them led me down the path of thinking that I was looking at a truly igneous rock. And it had not occurred to me yet that I might be looking at an impact breccia that got hot enough to melt. And it took the whole time of examining it - until right at the last - before I came to the correct conclusion. At the last, I saw the vesicles in the contact zone which pretty well confirmed it all. It took a while to work that through and to get away from thinking that I was looking at an igneous, anorthositic gabbro that had caught up pieces of other things. Normally, a field geologist would sort all those multiple working hypotheses as you go along and then eventually come to a conclusion. And that's what you write down. But here, what we see is a large part of my thinking process being verbalized. If we had had to stop after the first few minutes, we would have had all the wrong answers.
1653531||LMP|My guess is that the vesicular breccia was produced in the Serenitatis impact, that it was injected downward into the crust and then migrated back up along fractures in the ejecta. And, in that context, the blue-gray breccia may be pre-Serenitatis - who knows, perhaps Tranquillitatis ejecta or something like that. We'd seen the same blue-gray rock at Station 2. There was tan-gray breccia at Station 2 but that wasn't vesicular. Probably, the first place we saw the tan, vesicular breccia was at Turning Point Rock and, again, I was thinking there in terms of it being igneous.
1653643||CDR|I had some speed coming down, even though I was coming cross slope. It was so hard to get up there and so easy to come down, so I was moving. I was coming cross slope because, to come straight down, I probably would have gone head over heels. You couldn't come straight down that hill very fast. It's like skiing. If you go straight down, you're really going to motor. So you've got to shallow up the slope. But I got off balance, got on one leg, and fell into the hill. When I was watching this just now, I thought I was going to roll; but I didn't. I kept my balance pretty well. And I've got to tell you, agility goes along with the responsibility of command; and, to prove the point, I can only refer you to the help I received in getting that deep core out of the ground back on EVA-1.
1653702||LMP|(Laughing) That's a bad habit of mine. When people ask me to remind them to do something, I'll say it right then so I'm not held responsible for remembering.
1653704||LMP|By this third EVA we were very confident. We didn't worry about falling. Maybe we should have, but we didn't. What I want to know is how come he didn't get kidded about that fall like I got kidded about the fall at Ballet. That's just as spectacular.
1653716||LMP|This was an expression out of the old 'Fibber McGee and Molly' radio program.
1654028||CDR|(Smiling) I didn't want to let Jack use the hammer because I was afraid he'd hurt himself.
1654156||LMP|Obviously, I didn't remember what the core tube count was.
1654201||CDR|I was just sidestepping as I was coming around the Rover, sidestepping to slow down and turn. By this time I was long familiar with operating in the suit, and I appreciated the slope I was on. So I just turned and sort of sidestepped into where I wanted to stop.
1654352||CDR|It was difficult to shoot uphill, because you couldn't lean back very far. So I suggested that Jack lean against the rock.
1655013||CDR|I didn't have to go very far, so I came straight up. It would have been really tough in Earth gravity, but in one-sixth gravity at least we could hop and get fairly good distance. I'm getting maybe a foot with each hop, just like hopping up some steps on two feet, step by step by step.
1655756||LMP|I think we're both sounding tired after working on this slope. There isn't as much joking as when we first got there. We're quieter.
1655929||LMP|One of the things that bothered me physically was doing a lot of sidehill traversing at Station 6. On going east on the south-facing slope for some distance, the inside ligament on my left leg began to feel fatigued because the right leg was so much down and the left leg was so much up. Most of the stress was on the left leg, and it is the same ligament that I had damaged skiing years before in '58 or '59; and I suspect that that was the reason for that. It was a pretty bad pull and, after it recovered, I never felt it again except for going sidehill right in this part of the traverse. I started to tire and I could feel that ligament. It wasn't bad, but I could tell it wasn't normal.
1655929||CDR|About five or six weeks before the flight, we were playing softball and I pulled my planteres (a small calf muscle associated with the Achilles tendon). I was running between second and third base and I thought somebody had hit me in the bottom of the right leg with a machete. And I just doubled up. I was on crutches for about a couple, three or four days. If it was ripped, I was done (that is, off the flight). It was strained or pulled but not ripped, I guess, and I had some great concern as to whether the doctors would consider it recovered enough for me to fly. But I guarantee you that, less than a week after I was off the crutches I was in a suit doing EVA training. Hurting like hell. And I really wondered how it would be on the Moon. When we did go, I could feel it the whole time I was doing some of these things, but never to the extent that it either hobbled me or cut down my mobility. It just hurt. It had healed very, very quickly and I'm not so sure...And it sounds a little crazy; but I think part of your physical well-being depends on your mental well-being. And I'm not so sure that, mentally, I didn't want to fly that flight so bad that it either healed faster or I didn't know it hurt. There were times during the surface activities that I did feel it; but I don't remember feeling a thing during the stuff we've just gone through at Station 6. Also, it's possible that, subconsciously, the injury may have influenced my choice of hopping and skipping rather than Jack's long, loping stride. When you were hopping, you had to plan on maintaining a special kind of balance each time you came down, but you had two feet supporting you all the time. I'm not sure, but maybe I did hop to make my leg feel more comfortable.
1660017||CDR|I'd like to reminisce with Jack - a little bit - because, for what it's worth, we're sort of authenticating history, nineteen years later. It wasn't until Eric and I sat down in my office and watched the films and listened to our voices that I recalled the steepness of that slope at Tracy's Rock. Because Al Bean painted the picture, I've seen the hill a million times; but, in the years since we were there, I've never fully appreciated that you and I were walking at an angle on the side of the hill and that getting on and off the Rover was typical of the problems it caused.
1660017||LMP|I think it was one of the USGS (U. S. Geological Survey) guys who said that it was a twenty degree slope where we were parked. And there was a break there. The boulder probably hit and broke when it hit that break in slope and, above us, it was probably 25 or 26 degrees.
1660017||CDR|I recall climbing up there to do that pan, and being way above you. And I think this is important so that people can know what your ability is to maneuver around on slopes. And I don't think anyone else ever really encountered...I don't know what they did on Apollo 14 when they went up Cone Crater...
1660017||LMP|Apollo 14 didn't have a twenty degree slope. They had enough to make them work (about 10 degrees), but they didn't have as good a suit. They didn't have the new waist joint.
1660017||CDR|I just wanted to mention this. It was the one thing that impressed the devil out of me when we reviewed it. The still pictures and a lot of the TV don't show it, but it was really steep.
1660017||LMP|- (Laughing) "That's because the camera was always tilted twenty degrees.
1660040||CDR|For Jack to have gotten on that downhill seat, even if he'd jumped up there he probably would have fallen back off. For me, it was much easier to get on the uphill side but it was steep enough that it really did feel like I was going to end up in Jack's seat.
1660040||LMP|It wasn't worth the effort for me to try to get on. By this time, we didn't have any problem with walking some distance.
1660040||CDR|The only thing about it is that Jack really did enjoy riding on the downhill side.
1660040||LMP|(Laughing) That might have influenced my decision as well.
1660439||LMP|Why couldn't we have said what it was!
1660439||CDR|You and I knew what was going on, but nobody else could have followed it.
1660522||CDR|When you're sitting in the seat, you can't see what's going on in the seat. The other guy is the one whose got to look.
1660522||LMP|It's all by feel.
1660544||CDR|We were hearing static from the ground. But, as you can hear in the tape, they were reading us loud and clear. We were probably hearing carrier static.
1661513||CDR|I notice that we seem much more relaxed during EVA-3. We were confronted with more ambitious things but, even little things like picking up the scoop that we would have commented on earlier in the mission, we were just doing.
1661513||LMP|In EVA-2, we were always behind the timeline.
1661513||CDR|Early on, we were shouting to Houston and now we're more in tune. I think that, in another week of this, it would have become pretty routine - 'routine' in the sense that everything we did wasn't brand new, wasn't a new challenge.
1661513||LMP|I think that the third EVA included not only all of those things but, also, a realization in the back of your mind that this was the last one.
1661513||CDR|We wanted to drag it out as long as we could.
1661623||CDR|I remember this episode very, very vaguely. I didn't describe it very well.
1661623||LMP|You're going through a lot of thought and you're only articulating every once in a while.
1661623||LMP|The assigned task was to get a collection of fragments.
1661623||CDR|Quickly. Along with some general documentation.
1661623||LMP|And, generally, sampling of this kind was my task because we had decided that the scoop was the fastest way to do it.
1661623||CDR|The rock was an added attraction, a target of opportunity. So I went over while Jack was picking up his samples.
1661623||LMP|That's generally the way we worked on field trips.
1661719||LMP|'Dikelet' was a much better term than 'veinlet'. They're injected magma, melted rock.
1661719||CDR|And you didn't teach me that word before we started, either.
1661719||LMP|I think you knew 'dike' before...
1661719||CDR|Yeah; but 'dikelet'...I don't ever remember you telling me to use that word. (Tongue in cheek) Jack used to give me all these words and he'd say, 'Now, when you get up there, Cernan, use these. It will impress the hell out of them.' I had a list of words written down like a football player has a list of plays.
1661719||LMP|The guy that literally did that was Conrad. He had a list of geology phrases in his checklist, but he never used them. Of the first three crews, we probably had Beano and Pete as far up the curve in geology training as anybody. The last exercise they had in Hawaii just went beautifully. They were on top of everything we threw at them. So we expected the same thing to happen on the Moon and, yet, not a word! Not a word! Afterwards I found out - and I'm not sure exactly how - that they specifically decided not to say anything because, in the meantime, some of my scientific 'friends' had publicly made fun of Buzz talking about mica-like particles ('biotite' was the word Buzz used) that he saw sparkling on the surface. And they do sparkle like mica!! He'd seen it on field trips. But these assholes - I'll say that on tape - were making fun of Buzz because he described the way things looked. I'll tell you, I chewed a lot of guys out about the criticism of Buzz.
1661807||LMP|The reason that you don't hear any surprise in my voice (at Gene's discovery of the dike), is that what we had seen at Tracy's Rock was that you were getting partially-molten breccias in contact with the blue-gray rock. And here, some of that melt had been injected into the broken, crushed anorthositic fragments. So, while it wasn't a surprise, it was still a great find. (Laughing) And the only thing I had to do was to keep guiding Gene on using that hammer.
1661807||CDR|(In mock seriousness) You took my only playtoy away from me.
1661807||LMP|Hey, you were the only one who could hold it. I designed it, but I never could hold the damn thing. The handle was too big. We learned before we went that Gene was better in grasping the hammer; and the only thing I had to teach him to hit the edge of a rock instead of the center. 'Brute-force Cernan,' I kept thinking.
1661807||CDR|I've got a short, stubby hand, but I've also got a lot of strength in it. When you're grabbing that hammer, you're really grabbing it with your forearm muscles. That's where you get tired. The hammer, I didn't have any trouble with. (To Jack) If you remember, your hands were really hurting. Do you remember the blisters we had on our knuckles and it felt like our fingernails were driven back into the joints.
1662006||CDR|There's two things here: the transfer of authority with the hammer going to Jack (general laughter), and then the measurement of the focal distance. And you notice how easy it is for me to get the hammer out. I don't even look down. I just reach down, feel the handle, and it comes out.
1662023||LMP|None of the strokes were hard. Just little taps to break away the edge of a fracture.
1662200||CDR|This scene here - where Jack's getting up hill so he can get to my SCB while I'm getting the hammer put away - is a pretty good example of how we were no longer struggling with each and every tasks. By the third EVA a lot of these things were beginning to come naturally. You could combine actions and you became more productive and efficient in your use of time.
1662200||LMP|Again, just to point out the obvious, in the first EVA it wasn't quite that way. Things like putting the hammer away took longer. And what that points out is that, no matter how much we had trained in the suit, until you get in one-sixth gravity, your motions don't become habit. But very quickly, once you're in the right environment, you learn to do things almost automatically.
1662200||CDR|We could never train in a one-sixth gravity environment. For the record, we've got people all over the country doing studies for lunar base and Mars habitats. And there's only eleven people in the entire world who've ever been in anything but one gravity or zero gravity. There's only eleven people who can tell you about one-sixth gravity or who, perhaps, can extrapolate to Mars gravity. I just say that because, while that experience is around, we ought to at least tap it. And I don't think we do. Think about it. We've got thousands of hours of spaceflight experience - all the Soviet experience, all the Shuttle experience - and there's eleven human beings alive (Jim Irwin having died prior to this review session) who've experienced reduced gravity other than zero gravity.
1662200||LMP|- (Straight faced) "And only two who really understand it.
1662200||CDR|I agree. Strictly speaking, in terms of most recent experience, how can you argue with that? But, it's something serious. We've got all these studies. Everybody and their brother's doing a study about how you're going to operate, work, live, and function. And what they need to think about is how you learn to adapt. On that first EVA, that hammer was almost a handicap. It was always in the way. I knocked a fender off. But later, somehow, subconsciously, I knew it was there and worked around it. I was able to get at it or put it away much more quickly without making it a specific task. I was able to get at tools I needed concurrent with doing other things, instead of making each one a separate task. I didn't have to say, 'Time out, I'll get the shovel. Time out, I'll get my hammer out of my pocket.' Just a minute ago, when Jack walked away from where we had been working, on his first step he stepped on the head of the scoop so that he could grab the handle and walk on. It wasn't a special task where he got down on one knee and took another thirty seconds to a minute before he could press on. I think it's pretty easy to adapt. But, here again. With all these studies about what kind of mobility we need and how we're going to adapt and what tools we're going to need to get the work done, I don't know that anyone has ever been asked any questions. I haven't been asked, for the most part.
1662200||LMP|I participated in one or two studies; but, as far as I know, those studies aren't used. The Essex study for crew systems down at Houston has a lot of that stuff in it. But, if you ask anybody if they've seen it, they say they haven't. It's typical. All these studies are done and, even if they're good, they stay on the shelves along with the bad ones. Nobody ever looks at them and they go do the work again. I don't know how you break through that.
1662200||LMP|I think that, for Gene and me, those contacts were a major part of assimilating the experience that others had had. An example is Gene's consciousness about the cables for the heat flow probe. He was aware that John Young had lost track of them and pulled them out.
1662200||CDR|We probably focused on the problems that other people had had. The problems that Apollo 14 had getting up to Cone Crater. The problems of Apollo 16 with the cables. And I think that probably 15 was as good an all round training experience for follow-on crews as any. Because they had a little bit of everything: the Rover, the drill, rugged terrain. So it was a good presentation of the kind of things that you wanted to be aware of.
1662200||LMP|At this stage in the game (twenty years later), it's hard to remember all the things that you assimilated from the crew debriefings and from watching their performances. But I'm sure that there were a lot of things in the back of your mind that you learned and prepared for. So, by the time we flew, we had the benefit of all of that experience.
1662200||CDR|And there's always the undocumented conversations when you're in someone's office or wherever you might be. Saying 'Hey, John, did you really have a problem here' or 'What were you thinking there?' We worked and traveled together and I'm sure there were a lot of informal discussions. I can remember talking to John (Young) about the tendency, when you're coming down, to drift backwards or sideways. I wanted to land with a positive foot-per-second forward velocity. I wanted to bias my zero horizontal velocity so that I wouldn't drift back into something I couldn't see. I know that Stu Roosa - having just flown Apollo 14 - worked very closely with Ron and was very interested in the orbital science aspects of our mission.
1662312||CDR|I found a narrow part of the rock that I could grip.
1662322||CDR|That's a great scene. I love that.
1662325||CDR|I think that this is what this whole EVA is about. Aside from the geology, you're seeing a much more productive use of time.
1662741||LMP|Here, the 'goodies' I'm talking about are the individual fragments that we sampled right off the bat. It's not a new sample. As I was listening to this, at first I thought I was off doing something I shouldn't have been. But I'm sure I'm just adding another comment about that first sample I took with a scoop.
1663149||CDR|I've been reading ahead and I want to warn you that there's another important geologic observation coming up at 166:33:28.
1663155||LMP|The other guys may have just had the EVA map with the traverse on it. And you (Gene) said, 'Why don't we put that in the cuff checklist.' It wouldn't surprise me.
1663155||CDR|I tell you what. It may go back to my days in the Navy when we were doing low-altitude run-ins, and we would take a big sectional map. Your track might turn you left and right and south and we would cut the map in sections and we'd paste together so that you'd always have the navigation line - the run-in line - going away from you so that you were always flying forward no matter whether you were flying north or south or whatever. Even today I fly that way. I turn maps and mentally strip it in the direction I'm going. So, this could be an evolution of that.
1663155||LMP| I think that's right. I think that Dave (Scott) and John (Young) used the map. Gene had the map up in front of him, but he wanted it translated into a strip format for the cuff checklist.
1663155||CDR|It's like a watch. Where's the most convenient place to put a watch? On a wrist. Not in a pocket. Pocket watches are nice, but the most convenient place to put it is where you can glance at it easily. That's why the cuff checklist, itself, was a great idea; and putting the maps in made it even better.
1663155||LMP|The idea of the checklist, itself, goes back to Apollo 8. Bill Anders asked for one listing the things he was going to describe from lunar orbit. It wasn't a cuff checklist, but the checklist that Neil had sewn on his sleeve evolved from that.
1663155||CDR|The support crews deserve credit for a lot of these little ideas. Something might have been a problem on a previous mission and someone like Ed Gibson (who came up with the idea of the stay-open, spring-bound cuff checklist for Apollo 12) could come up with a simple fix that people on the prime crew might not have had time to think about. And, by the time of Apollo 17, the cuff checklist wasn't just a checklist of the things you wanted to do, it was a geologic flight plan.
1663209||LMP|Now, as this line indicates, from my geologic experience - to contrast with Gene's Navy experience - you're used to keeping the map oriented one way and translate, in your mind, where north is. I never did it very well, but a lot of people are able to do that.
1663605||CDR|I've got to believe that it's not batteries. We could start to feel the Sun penetrating the suit on the EVA-3. We were driving into the Sun, sitting still. We were not going in and out of shade. Everything that was in the Sun, stayed in the Sun for twenty or thirty minutes.
1663640||CDR|We do that a lot when you're flying an approach. I don't know why I was doing that. Maybe it was the Sun angle or the slope. It wasn't the direct route to where we were going; but, by staying at 3.4 from the LM, we were going to get there.
1663910||LMP|It strikes me - because of the casualness of Bob's little jibe - that, here we are, two hundred thirty thousand miles from Earth, third EVA, three and a half kilometers from the relative safety of the LM, and it sounds like we're down at the local Circle K (a chain of convenience stores), for crying out loud! Human beings and their psychological adaptability is just unbelievable!
1663910||CDR|There you were, in a space suit, two inches away from the vacuum of the universe. Every time you made a move - from Earth orbit to translunar coast to lunar orbit, out of the Command Module to the Lunar Module, to the lunar surface, out of the Lunar Module, out on the surface in your suit, jump in the Rover and drive out about as far as you can theoretically walk back - you added a link in a chain that you have to gobble back up to get home. And, yet, you only think about it when you have to think about it.
1663910||CDR|The health of the LM was always a concern. Based on an accumulation of experience, by the time of Apollo 17 we had more faith in the LM and, at least for our flight, actually powered it down. But my personal feeling is that, should something have happened to the suit or the Rover, I was on the spot to be able to do something about it. Whether I could or not was another story. But I, at least, was in control. But if I'm 3.6 kilometers from the Lunar Module and something happens in the spacecraft, I'm not there to do anything about it. So, when you left the LM out there all by itself, that was the weak link in the chain. If we had a problem with the suit, we were going to scoot back home to the LM.
1663910||LMP|I've really been searching my memories of all the flight planning we did - and I did a lot of it for the EVAs - I don't remember concerns about the LM ever coming up. I remember concerns about suit leaks, about the energy levels it would take to walk, what was a reasonable distance to walk, and things like that. Pete's flight was the first pinpoint landing. We didn't know we were going to land as close to that Surveyor as we did. And so the EVA planning was pretty general and we thought a lot about what we were going to do if we didn't land close to it. I just frankly don't remember the security of the LM being an issue. I may be totally wrong. My thought in those days, as I recall, was that the ground was going to be watching that LM very, very carefully and was going to tell the crew. They were going to be close enough to get back in a hurry anyway.
1663910||CDR|The ground could tell you, but they couldn't do anything. They had absolutely no control over the LM. I've always felt - and this is not a knock at the LM, because the LM was one of the finest flying machines built for the purpose at hand - but I felt more comfortable in my suit. The LM was literally built to just get the job done, while the suit was almost over-engineered. When we pressurized the LM - whoop - it expanded like an oil can. It didn't scare me, but you did realize that you were at the mercy of a little tin can with a few motors running and blowers blowing and what have you. We convinced ourselves we could have gotten in our suits in three and a half minutes but, in the real world, we would have needed more time...
1663910||LMP|I think there was a (vacuum) chamber test - something associated with a chamber test. One of the tests was delayed because somebody stuck a pencil through the skin of the LM.
1663910||CDR|It was your minimum housing requirements on the lunar surface. Would I live in a LM for a month on the Moon? Aside from the lack of volume and so forth, I don't think that would be a judicious approach. I think you would have to get in something more stable. The LM is a good transfer vehicle and we lived in it for three days. But I don't think it would be adequate for any long period of time.
1663910||LMP|You wouldn't want a lot of long-term activity going on in there. There's just too much chance of damaging it. Every time we went in and out, we'd bang against the DSKY.
1663910||CDR|We've had a long digression, but I think that the person who utilizes this information for any reason - ten years, twenty years or, just from a historical point of view, a hundred years from now - ought to know the feelings of the people who were really there. It's an important part of this document.
1663924||LMP|The more I think about what I said, the more I think that there were two pit-bottom craters side by side. Maybe there's a picture that shows it.
1664016||LMP|Because things were so ill-defined over here at the Sculptured Hills, it was decided that we would pick the exact place.
1664334||LMP|My erstwhile colleagues (in the lunar geology community) don't like the term 'instant rock'. They call it 'regolith breccia'. I got taken to task at some talk I gave.
1664334||CDR|It is instant rock! (Jack laughs) I used to think of rock forming over hundreds of thousands of years; but, all of a sudden, now I know what it is. 'Instant rock' adds dynamics to the description.
1664334||LMP|What's happening in this area is that we've gotten a whole bunch of ejecta blankets from large craters like Henry, Cochise, and Shakespeare on top of each other. It's a very thick regolith, and craters which would have normally gotten to bedrock just penetrated farther into regolith, formed a lot of instant rock, and that's what's been thrown up on the rims. That's what we've sampled here and that's what we'll see at Van Serg (Station 9).
1664619||LMP|I think we were still on the ejecta blanket of a crater - maybe Bowen (or SWP) - big enough to have penetrated to the subfloor and to have thrown rocks up the slope. So, what I was trying to do was get us away from that and get as far up the hill as we could go. We wound up at the northwest end of the Station 8 area.
1664833||LMP|Your ability to sense a slope in one-sixth g is not as great as it would be in one g. The extreme, of course, being zero g where you wouldn't sense a slope at all.
1665124||CDR|Jack is really covering some territory. The fact that the camera is panning in the opposite direction makes it look faster, but he's really moving across that slope.
1665320||LMP|With that slope, the kangaroo hop was the only way to move.
1665320||CDR|You couldn't really go one foot in front of the other uphill, because you can't get your foot high to take that step. So you hop.
1665320||LMP|I don't recall anybody ever walking up stairs in a pressurized suit.
1665356||CDR|I got tired just watching this. We weren't breathing hard; but Jack's voice, when he got up to the rock, was forceful - which we tended to do in those circumstances. You had to blow it out.
1665407||LMP|Good idea, Jack.
1665927||CDR|I still can remember the reverberation through my body when I hit a hard rock like that. Your whole body would feel the impact of that hammer. By this time, I wasn't feeling inhibited from taking good solid swings. But I would have hated to miss it and hit my shin.
1665927||LMP|I could feel it through the ground, through my feet, like a minor earthquake. And you could see where I moved when you started to swing? I never stood in front of you.
1665927||LMP|That's one reason why I didn't use it. I never felt like I had control of it
1670003||CDR|You notice that I'm standing a little below the boulder. It's something you do automatically.
1670003||LMP|Human beings are basically lazy. And you naturally find the easiest way to get to it. One thing I noticed back at Station 7 is that, the first time I dropped the scoop, I stepped on it to get the handle up so I could grasp it. The second time, it was over at the rock and I just leaned against the rock and reached down.
1670003||CDR|That stepping to get the handle is something I do on the golf course all the time. If I happen to drop a sand wedge along the edge of the green - while I'm putting - and I go back to get it. Jack's right, we're lazy and we pick the easiest way out. I always step on the face of that club.
1670003||LMP|I play golf, but I never do that. My clubs are too good for that. (General laughter)
1670003||CDR|Jack never needs but one club when he's up to the green, and the putter's got a flat face and it's awful hard...
1670003||LMP|You don't want to step on your putter, anyway. It's bad luck.
1670003||CDR|Well, I've got all those high angle clubs with me when I'm around the green.
1670208||CDR|I was braking as I was going downhill and then I hopped on two feet coming back up. You can see the degree of that slope. It was a lot of work; I wasn't making much progress." Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22379"@alsjt>22379</a> from the pan Gene will take at @alsjurl/a17/a17.sta8.html#1670720"@alsjt>167:07:20</a> shows the footprints Gene's makes during the little excursion, skipping out on the left and hopping back on the right
1670257||CDR|- (Tongue firmly in cheek) "I had that description written in my checklist, too. (General laughter) And, when I had to go pick up the chip of that boulder, Jack immediately picked up the cue and described it himself. Jack, this was going to be my big moment! You were going to let me do the whole thing, but you couldn't stand it.
1670543||LMP|I think that what I had in mind was to get top and bottom samples for solar wind dating. We also had a plan to get soil samples from way underneath boulders, samples that had been shielded from cosmic rays. Bob was thinking about the cosmic ray issue; I had in mind solar wind dating of when the boulder got there. The solar wind doesn't penetrate more than 500 Angstroms (5x10-8 m); whereas cosmic ray secondaries wind up at two or three meters. So we were both right; I just never explained to him what I was doing.
1670726||LMP|I'd started out trying to stride downhill. And it didn't work.
1670739||LMP|Somebody was inspired to put out a "Ski the Moon" poster, this one just a white sphere on a black background.
1671001||CDR|When you were hopping, I felt that you could really take off and still have significant control if you anticipated and shock-absorbed your landing. It really was the only way to travel downhill. I think that if you stride on a slope, you shift your weight too much from one foot to the other and, in one-sixth g, once you start to shift your weight your more apt to go kattiwampus (meaning "out of kilter").
1671001||LMP|Well, you know, it's hard to stride going downhill here on Earth, too. If you go down a twenty degree slope and you start striding, you just don't feel like you've got much control.
1671001||CDR|Yeah. And when you hop, you can lean back like you do in skis and control your center-of-gravity and not have it out in front of you. (Pause) I can relate to this. This is fun.
1671702||LMP|The level of emotion seems to have dropped off a little bit. We'd been walking up and down that hill for quite a while.
1671824||CDR|The reason the camera comes off is that I've got to get close to the fender. The camera keeps you about a foot away from anything. Plus you bang up the lens.
1671824||LMP|There's something I don't think I mentioned back at Station 7. We were talking about manipulating things more easily. When I was getting samples into a bag, I had mastered how to do that without the camera interfering; where, on the first and second EVAs - like Station 3 - I hadn't figured it out.
1671824||CDR|If you had to bag something yourself, you had both a vision and an access problem. So you had to find out where your arms met each other above or below the camera.
1671917||LMP|Part of the reason is that I'm tired. It also happens when I'm thinking and trying to talk simultaneously - which I never did very well.
1672002||LMP|It was a judgment call based on how deep the trench was. You'd take one at the bottom, one is the middle, and a skim off the top.
1672025||CDR|I was leaning over the fender, putting pressure on the Rover; and I think I was bouncing it up and down. I think that each wheel had a V-type torsion bar (see @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20453"@alsjt>20453</a>) because the Rover had been folded up for storage in the LM. We didn't have shock absorbers because we would have had dust problems.
1672025||LMP|The Rover was parked with the rear end downhill, so you were more or less able to stand there looking at it.
1672105||LMP|Anyone planning to work on the Moon or Mars ought to have Gene's statement engraved on their forehead and on the inside of their glasses.
1672151||LMP|This confirms what I thought back when we were going through Station 7 - that the 90 degree angle was something I'd worked out in order to bag samples more easily when I was working alone. I'd hoped to do that here while Gene was doing something else; but, now, Gene's come over and we'll go back to two-man sampling routine.
1672405||LMP|After I got the skim, I just stuck the scoop part way in the wall and scraped upward to get the next 5 centimeters.
1672700||LMP|- (To Gene) "I don't know if you were aware of it or not, but one of the most successful experiments that we conducted was the portable gravimeter. They got great readings all across the valley; and the interpretation is great about the depth of the basalt fill in the valley - about two kilometers deep.
1672700||CDR|I'm glad; and I do think I remember that. But it was always a pain number one in the butt.
1672700||LMP|And what it tells you is that the valley used to be almost five kilometers deep before it filled up. The eruption of mare basalt started very soon after the valley formed; but there's as much as a hundred million years of play (meaning 'uncertainty'), there. Serenitatis formed at something like 3.8 billion years ago - something like that - and the oldest basalt that we brought back - from Station 5 - came out at about 3.7 something. Nobody knows for sure how many flows there were or how thick they were. Some of the late basalts in Imbrium are relatively thin - ten meters or so. Some of the layers that they see in Hadley Rille are relatively thin. But whether that applies to the stuff deeper down, nobody knows. You may have had pretty thick cooling units. It just depends on how fast that stuff came out. Probably most of the basalts - in the early phases, anyway - when the flows first start in a basin like Serenitatis, it probably erupts from literally millions of centers. It's not like out on the West Mesa of Albuquerque where you had a single crack and that's where the basalt came up. Initially, a basin like Serenitatis - 500 kilometers across - is fractured to beat all hell and, so, anything coming up from below has an infinite number of choices. And then, gradually, most of those seal off and the later flows come out of a few, discrete, individual eruptions.
1672743||CDR|Coming down those shallow slopes is poetry in motion. That's productive use of your time. If you could do something like helicopter skiing - have somebody drop you off at the top and pick you up at the bottom - you could really cover a lot of territory.
1672743||LMP|In that Essex study, my proposal for the Mars part of it was that you have a Rover that you can run either manually or automated. So if the pair were out working, you could have somebody else, say back at the base or the lander, remotely move it to where you want it. And then, after you leave, it can be operated remotely from Earth or from Mars orbit. I don't think it would be a big weight penalty; all it is, is electronics.
1673208||LMP|I think that I was getting so that I didn't quite trust Houston. They kept having us fool around with the SEP and my feeling was that it was probably gone. So I'm trying to prod them a little bit, having just told them that it was 120 (degrees) and my memory, at the time, was probably that that was way outside the limits. Literally, the science room was leading us down the garden path on the SEP, because all this SEP stuff we were doing was wasting time. It had quit working when? Sometime in the first EVA, didn't it? As with the (long-period) gravimeter, they should have bit the bullet far sooner than they did. They knew what the limits were, but they kept having us dust it and tape it!
1673208||LMP|I was wearing my visor with the lower edge at about eye level and, with it there, all you're getting is indirect sunlight reflected off the surface. And you don't go around staring at the Sun, anyway.
1673442||CDR|At least I fell off-camera.
1673523||CDR|I don't remember this particular event but...
1673523||LMP|I can't believe I don't remember it.
1673523||CDR|It may be that I just fell on my ass trying to get on the Rover. But I never had problems getting up, and that's why I'm confused as to what this is.
1673523||LMP|The thing I don't understand is why you couldn't do a push-up.
1673523||CDR|I don't understand either. I just don't recall that at all.
1673523||LMP|You know what it may have been? You may have started to kick to get on the Rover, then fell, and you were lying next to the Rover...
1673523||CDR|Caught by the slope against the Rover.
1673523||LMP|Yes. Which meant you couldn't rotate backwards. And my gratuitous advice was to get your feet downhill! (General laughter) And you must have had a feeling at some other time - probably Station 6 or 7 - that you were coming close to missing (the seat).
1673653||CDR|The 240 heading - southwest - put me on the downslope side of the Rover. And what I'm saying here is that I'm never going to put myself on the downslope again.
1673851||CDR|Because of the slope and the craters, we made some wide turns and I just wanted to know where we wanted to go, not how to get there.
1673948||LMP|When I was laying out the east geophone line, I had picked out a point on the horizon to walk towards.
1674035||CDR|Note the change in course.
1674311||LMP|I think that, at some point in the deep, dark past, the geologists at Flagstaff may have called the valley fill the 'plains unit'. You referred to these things as they appeared in the (overhead) photographs - the floor, the plains of the valley. They may have called it the plains unit at one time and then, because we're talking about the rocks - what's underneath that floor - decided to refer to it as the subfloor basalt.
1674311||LMP|From memory, I believe they expected to see "dark mantle material" as the top unit and then had three options for the block-forming subfloor: (1) basalt, or (2) the down-faulted top of the Serenitatis ejecta, possibly partially molten 'sheet breccia', or (3) debris derived from the highlands. Also, they had no idea how thick the subfloor material might be.
1674850||CDR|- (Tongue still firmly in cheek) "At 48:50, where Jack says 'I think we've got that relationship', I don't want anyone to misinterpret the fact that we've been on the Moon three days. (Laughing) 'We can't get down to it, but at least we can take a picture.'
1674850||LMP|It'd be a little hard to have a relationship in those suits, anyway.
1674902||LMP|Gene was still talking about the rock in Cochise, and I was talking about a rock he hit.
1674902||CDR|We're moving pretty rapidly through this area. If you're going ten kilometers (per hour) and you hit a football (sized rock), you feel it. We put some dents into those wire-wheel tires.
1674926||LMP|And if there is dust between the clamp and the map, it may be slipping.
1675100||CDR|I was getting irritated with Bob for telling me how to get where I'm going. There was a touch of it a page or two ago and you're seeing it again here. What Bob doesn't see is that you don't just go from here to there. I might have to go around something, and I can see why I'm saying 'Damn it, I'm too good of a pilot not to know where I'm going! Don't tell me; just tell me where I need be and I'll be there.' Jack used to get irritated at Bob, and this is the first sign of my irritation.
1675100||CDR|That may be. But, see, now he's infringing on my ability to navigate. He's telling me how to fly. And he doesn't know what the terrain looks like. He doesn't know how many football-sized rocks we're banging into and how many little craters we've got to go through and what the Sun is doing to us and what sightseeing we're doing along the way so that we can get up on the rim of a crater so we can get a picture. Yeah, I'm probably getting tired.
1675121||CDR|We had been moving at 10 or 12 clicks for a while but we're not moving that fast here. We're picking our way through here, probably at low speed, but as fast as we can get through the block field. With a wander factor of 50 percent, I've got to drive 15 meters to go forward 10.
1675411||CDR|I'm out of my seat and I'm walking behind the Rover to see if I can't help Jack with his twisted seatbelt. And, while I'm there, I see the fender curled under. That's where we're getting our dust. And, maybe the other fenders were getting hot and twisted in the Sun.
1675411||LMP|- (To Gene) "Isn't it remarkable, though, that - even with the transcript - you have no image of looking at those fenders. I run into that all the time.
1675411||CDR|I can create the image here of what they looked like, but it's today's image; it's not a recollection.
1675411||LMP|Now, having read this and having heard about my belt, I can remember that now. It's a real image.
1675411||CDR|Certain things hit me like that, too. But I don't remember seeing the replacement fender curling or the others being warped. I would be kidding you if I said it was a recollection.
1675411||LMP|Another example, for me, of not having an image is all that floundering around you apparently did beside the Rover (at Station 8). And of me trying to get you stood up. Very faint bells have started to ring. And it didn't come immediately.
1675411||CDR|Me, too. And, then, I can go back earlier to Tracy's Rock and that whole slope and that whole affair came back to me beautifully. I was there. I remembered it. I remembered working around that rock. I remembered the slope. But, here, I'm losing it.
1680430||CDR|This is recall to me. This I've seen before. We're just over the rim of the crater.
1680430||LMP|You can remember walking up and, the first time you look in the crater, there's a lot more crater there than you think there is. I remember Van Serg pretty well.
1680813||LMP|It's a big rock - too big for a bag. The bag's on one end and I'm trying to get it down in the bottom of his SCB so that the bag stays attached.
1680813||CDR|We did that a number of times, to protect or identify a rock.
1681214||LMP|For clarification, in this paragraph my use of the word 'fragment' is confusing. I had started to use 'fragment' when I should have been using 'clast'. A 'fragment' is sort of a loose piece of rock lying around; these were pieces in a breccia, so they're 'clasts'. I never found out what the light-colored clasts are; I don't think I ever looked into it. There was a mixture of material thrown from the sides of the North Massif and the subfloor-(derived) regolith, so the light-colored clasts are probably the pulverized and reworked material from the North Massif bound up in a matrix of regolith breccia.
1681316||LMP|What Gene's referring to, here, is that this stuff looked a little bit like the blue breccias up on the North Massif (at Stations 6 and 7) because, in appearance, it was dark, bluish-gray with the white clasts. As it turns out - and I don't remember if we came to the conclusion before we left (the Moon) or not - these were those regolith breccias.
1681756||LMP|The sample was just a little too big for the bag.
1681828||CDR|At this stage of the game you get frustrated trying to use your hands. Not that the enthusiasm isn't there. During the first EVA you probably would have shoved it in there but it gets to the point where its difficult. Your dexterity is not what you want it to be. I think you're probably more efficient with your hands; you learn to adapt with your hands as well as with anything else, but now you're fighting (fatigue).
1681828||LMP|- (To Gene) "In terms of what you could do ungloved, how much less efficient are you?
1681828||CDR|Less than half.
1681828||CDR|I don't think you lose your ability; you just get frustrated. You're probably smarter in the use of your hands. You know what you can't do, so you don't try to do those things. So you say, 'Well, it's almost done, so I'm not going to worry about the rest of it.' I can almost hear the frustration. Three consecutive days, twelve hours a day in a suit, is a long time.
1682432||LMP|About the only time I ever used the yo-yo was for my LRV sampler.
1682640||LMP|I used the extension handle as a prop so that I could reach down, in a dynamic fashion, grab the scoop and regain my balance. I did avoid sticking the female end of the extension handle in the ground. I didn't want to fill it with dust, so I turned it around and used the handle end. This exercise may be an indication of me getting tired and getting a little bit careless in the way I retrieved that scoop because, if I'd tripped, I'd have been on my face...I would have been in Van Serg. Either it was a very dumb thing to do or I had a hell of a lot of confidence in my ability to do it. I suspect it was the former.
1682640||CDR|I think that, all through this station, you can see us getting tired. You can go back to the start of the station and see where everything was going 'normal'. But, here, we're saying thing like 'Well, it'll have to do.' And we wouldn't have been saying that earlier.
1682640||LMP|We sort of hit a wall here. We'd been out for five hours and, while I don't remember it so much in the first EVA, in the second we had this same emotional up and down. I don't know whether we'll come back up again, here. But we did on the second EVA. We went down (emotionally) at (Station) 3 and back up at 4 and then there was a let down again (during the drive from Shorty to Victory) and then back up at 5.
1682640||CDR|I think this is a combination of the amount of work we did on this EVA on those hillsides and of three solid days of working - and not the greatest amount of sleep. I would predict that if we went out on a fourth day or a fifth day, the total slope (that is, the average trend of their emotional state) - not the up and down of a single EVA, but the total slope - would start darting back up. Who knows? I'm not tired of watching what we were doing, but I sympathize with the amount of effort we were putting out on this third day.
1682640||LMP|This had to be our most physical day. We rode (and rested) on the Rover for a solid hour getting out to Station 2 on the second day and, here, we only had fifteen or twenty minutes between demanding stations.
1682640||CDR|And they were demanding stations. We haven't had a piece of level ground (during this EVA) until now
1682925||LMP|Here, I was probably thinking about the sample I'd taken up on the rim.
1682927||LMP|While he was talking, I must have taken a swipe into the dirt near the Rover.
1682931||CDR|I was still thinking about getting some of the glass balls. I wasn't impressed by the white.
1682931||LMP|I don't think you'd seen it yet. You were on one side of the Rover and I was on the other. In fact, I think I remember that.
1683006||LMP|While Gene was reading the gravimeter and was talking to Bob, I must have started to dig a trench. I could dig those trenches pretty fast. In what - maybe twenty seconds - I was able to get several scoops out and I had a flat wall trench.
1683040||LMP|- (Laughing) "It doesn't take much to get your enthusiasm back up. Because, all of a sudden, there's a whole different tone in my voice. It may be a combination of having seen something different and the fact that Houston's now put some pressure on us to get out of there.
1683040||CDR|It also shows that you've got to have someone on the spot to make a decision. They're saying get out and we're saying 'Sorry, guys, we're not going to get out for five minutes because we've got something we think is worthwhile.' That's the way you have to operate. The ground is an advisor; it's a flight planner; it's a lot of things. But you've got to make the decisions of what you're going to do with your time.
1683040||CDR|It's a natural maturation of the program. More time gives you more flexibility. But, as Jack mentioned earlier, we never did have a nominal station. They give you thirty minutes and they want an hour's worth of work. It's just normal. Using the time is never a problem.
1683216||LMP|While we were doing this sampling, in the background on the video tape we can hear Gerry Griffin acting like a Flight Director. In trying to be objective about what we've seen here at this station, I thought he might have taken hold of the apparent fatigue a little bit sooner.
1683418||LMP|I don't know why I remember this, but I think that the DSEA - which was the SEP recording tape - had a locking bolt that came up into a slot with a little winged, butterfly-shaped bow that you screwed down. And I think that what Gene found is that it was just sitting in there - that the bow had tripped.
1683600||LMP|I think that ground is showing some sensible decision making, here. Their taking new information - namely the white underneath the dark that we just discovered and sampled - and deciding to take a double core here, rather than taking pot luck at some other place. A bird-in-the-hand type philosophy.
1683720||LMP|I think this exchange is another symptom of my being tired.
1683720||CDR| It was a symptom of being tired. My willingness to do the core had nothing to do with my geologic expectations. I was just saying, 'Whatever we're going to do, let's just get on with it'.
1683720||LMP|Had I really been thinking, (I would have realized that) those rocks are so soft you'd go through them (with the core) anyway.
1684549||LMP|I think that it was Bob who told me that they really didn't have any idea - when he started to call us - of what that was. None! And I don't think I've ever seen this sequence in a NASA tape.
1684549||CDR|I have never seen this picture until just now. Never. Never!
1684650||CDR|It was sort of a target of opportunity. It was just one of those (unplanned) things you do. And it's a pretty good picture.
1684738||CDR|I did whatever I'd done the last time (at Station 8 when he fell as he tried to mount the Rover) - got my foot caught on something, or whatever.
1685627||LMP|I think I was using 'alpha' or 'A' for 'Apollo', and Bob was using 'Bravo' in the sense of 'job well done'. It's possible that I had something going with those guys. It's possible, but I just don't remember.
1685639||LMP|- (Laughing very loudly) "That I remember!!
1685639||CDR|- (Laughing) "The fastest we went was coming off of the Scarp and, for a short period of time, we did hit 17 clicks (kilometers per hour). But, here, I think we set this one up.
1685639||LMP|Sometimes in my talk, I say that, in normal terrain you can push the Rover up to 10 to 12 clicks. But that, one time going downhill, we had it up to 18 kilometers per hour and regretted it. And we were bouncing.
1685639||CDR|But I do think that we set this one up; we wanted to go down in history. I was with Johnny Rutherford (an American race driver of Indianapolis or 'Indy'-type cars) one time. I'd asked him to give a talk about a year or two ago. Someone asked him a question and he was talking about being the fastest human or having the fastest time at Indy or something and I got up there and said that I didn't think that that was right. I said, 'I drove a little race car about 17 kilometers per hour on the surface of the Moon, and that makes me and Jack Schmitt the fastest race car drivers in the world. And he said, 'Well, what are you talking about?' And I said, 'When you add 17 kilometers per hour to the rate the Moon travels around the Earth..." (General laughter
1685722||LMP| 'Evenly sorted' is an oxymoron. 'Sorted' implies that there's a non-random organization. 'Evenly sorted' means it's random. It's not very good jargon. It's used; but it's not very good jargon. And by 'massive', I mean that there is no other organization - the material within the vesicles didn't seem to have phenocrysts or alignments or anything like that.
1685902||LMP|Two or three kilometers away on either side, we're surrounded by highlands - high mountains with entirely different kinds of rocks. Yet I don't think we ever recognized any fragments of the breccias from the mountains. You would have thought that some would have been thrown in there in 3.8 billion years; but we just didn't see any. The interpretation, now, is that, at about 3.5 (billion years ago), there was a mantling of the dark pyroclastics with a little bit of orange soil mixed in. And then, over time, that's just been reworked into the soil and it's so fine grained that it may have absorbed fragments into it.
1685902||LMP|It's deeper (than on the valley floor), but it should give you some instant rock - some regolith breccias. And those would survive if they were hard enough. They find stuff (from the Massifs) in the soil, but no coarse fragments.
1690207||CDR|I think I was probably going pretty slow. As long as you don't hit those things hard and fast, you're okay. So I just went over it with the wheel.
1690323||LMP|Obviously, I was just running something through my mind out loud and (when) it didn't make sense to me, I decided to forget about it.
1690401||LMP|I have an image of what the Challenger looked like coming back from Station 5 on the second EVA, but not from here.
1690401||CDR|Me, either.
1691034||CDR|It worked great. They knew where we were, even when we didn't.
1691046||LMP|I'd probably noticed this rock during the first EVA when we were laying out the SEP. It was non-vesicular and fine grained, which was what attracted my eye.
1691227||LMP|- (Comparing the EP-2 "locator" with the VIP site "locator", AS17-143- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21932"@alsjt>21932</a>) "It looks like Gene parked the Rover about a third closer (actually about twenty percent) and, when that thing went off, the back of the Rover must have gotten splattered a little bit. This business of the explosives packages brings up the question of long duration activities on the Moon away from a radiation shelter and what you would do in the event of a solar particle event. We didn't worry about them because we figured that the probability was low enough that we'd just deal with whatever happened.
1691227||CDR|And we couldn't have dealt with big ones.
1691227||LMP|But if you're going to have a lunar base, you're going to have some kind of emergency capability. You'll have maybe a half hour - possibly as much as an hour - warning, although nobody's quite worked that out yet. But one way to deal with it is to excavate a trench with a linear charge, drive the Rover over it (to form a roof), get into the trench and, with an umbilical, attach yourself to Rover consumables. You have the walls protecting you and you can even think about putting low molecular weight material (e.g. water) in the floor of the Rover to give you additional protection. It's a neat idea; and it actually comes from Jim Blacic up at Los Alamos. And the reason I brought it up here is that people say, 'Explosives on the Moon!?' And you've got to remind them that we've already done that.
1691227||CDR|I was just thinking that it would be neat to be able to take a little tour back to the valley of Taurus-Littrow and see what things look like. See where the Ascent Stage hit (on the South Massif); see where the Rover is splattered with material from that bomb; see the remnants of the Descent Stage. Even if you had to do it remotely, I would really like to see what that area looks like.
1691341||LMP|I think that I didn't bother with the seatbelt because I was going to get off in just a little ways to pick up the big rock.
1691424||LMP|I think I tried to do some solo sampling on the first EVA, and I think I'd dropped a sample bag.
1691520||LMP|It's a classic, old comedy routine. You start to pick something up and you kick it out ahead of you.
1691856||LMP|I believe they were looking for Descent Engine effluents and, to my knowledge, they were never able to detect any.
1692140||CDR|That's not atypical. That's what you had to do to work against the stiffness in the bearings.
1692329||LMP|A bunch of Okies going across the countryside, dropping stuff right and left.
1692329||CDR|It was a good time to lose them, I guess.
1692329||LMP|- (Chuckling) "One thing to think about, Geno, is: if I had been successful in getting us a fourth EVA and we had gotten to this point with no rake and no scoop, what would the mission planners have done in replanning the fourth EVA?
1692556||CDR|I was patting the radar for doing a good job; I was saying 'Thank you' It was just a personal touch.
1692556||LMP|There's something in the back of my mind that there was an ad on commercial radio or television at the time that said 'Blank built better'. Ford or Chevy, maybe. And Gene was just putting 'radar' in the phrase.
1693017||CDR|Parker said 'We'll bring them both (that is, both cameras) back,' but I know what I did with that camera. I left it on the Rover pointed straight up. That's what I planned to do and that's what I did. I can remember specifically wedging it - I don't remember exactly where - somewhere up between our seats.
1693159||LMP|So, originally, it was going to be out there for the full three EVAs and they made a real-time change because they predicted a solar flare? (Chuckling) Thanks guys. What about us? Couldn't we get in the ETB? Well, there's a limited number of things you can worry about. Right, Gene? Like having to deal with Schmitt all the time.
1693205||LMP|I was just doing it, looking at the magazines and coming up with names. Probably, I couldn't remember how to spell Eileen.
1694204||LMP|Gene is talking about the Station 9 rock he had put in his footpan; and that's already been packed. So I reached down and picked one up. I remember that. It was relatively flat, I think.
1694445||CDR|The idea was there; the thought was there. But if I was going to say it again, I'd say it a little bit more eloquently. I'd thought about it a little bit beforehand but, like a lot of things, not a great deal. The thought, the idea, but not the words. And I guess we got the point across.
1694445||LMP|It reads well.
1695043||CDR|Little did we know that it would be this long - nineteen years later and even longer yet - before Man will ever return. I don't think that either Jack or I ever thought - and we kept saying that Apollo 17 was the end of the beginning and not the end - that it would take this long for this nation or mankind in general to decide not only when he's going to return but if he desires to go back to the Moon and then on to Mars. Finally, we're at a point in time where people are beginning to talk seriously about it happening. But as we sit here today, in 1991, we all know it's going to be after the turn of the century before Man goes back again. That, in itself, is almost an unacceptable position to be in. If we had realized that nineteen years ago...We kept saying that, well, we're the last for a while but somebody will be back pretty soon. I've got to believe that both Jack and I certainly felt that it would be in the time frame of the 20th Century.
1695043||LMP|I knew things had slowed down. I don't know if you remember, Gene, but, when we rendezvoused with Ron - and I think it was just before or just after we undocked with the LM - Houston read us a statement from Nixon in which he said, specifically, that we were the last people to visit the Moon in this Century. And I really got upset. I think I either showed it or talked to you about it. I thought that was the stupidest thing a President ever could have said to anybody. You may believe it privately, but why say that to all the young people in the world.
1695043||CDR|And don't forget, this was in 1972, so we had thirty years to go before the century was over.
1695043||LMP|It was just a totally unnecessary thing for him to say. Whoever wrote that speech really blew it with that remark. And I was really upset. Tired, but really mad. It was just pure loss of will.
1695043||CDR|I knew we wouldn't be back in ten years; but we're talking about as many as thirty-five or forty years. And that's a generation and a half. The kids who are in grammar school now are the people who are going to be taking those trips back to the Moon and on to Mars. So we've got a generation in there that we've left in limbo. I don't really want to get into this - and the Shuttle is a sophisticated flying machine - but, whether it's the Shuttle or Soyuz or Mir, there is a difference between a space program that takes you to 300 miles away from your home planet and another one that sets you out on a voyage a quarter million miles away. There are significant differences, both technologically and philosophically. And, quite frankly, I'm a little disappointed in us, at this time, to know that we're really not much further along than we were back then.
1695043||LMP|We're not as far. Then, at least we had a technology base. Now, we've got to rebuild it.
1695315||CDR|John Young drove his Rover out there to do the same thing - to get a picture of lift-off. And John may have told me something about positioning the Rover.
1695315||LMP|You know what I think it may have been? I was thinking about it a moment ago. (AS17-143-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21932"@alsjt>21932</a> shows that) you positioned it at an angle to the line between the VIP site and the LM so that the TV camera had a better field-of-view. When we were looking at the picture before, I wondered why you left it parked that way.
1695315||CDR|I agree. Whatever I'm referring to (here) has got to do with the parking of the Rover.
1695628||CDR|As I remember, I went around behind the VIP site and drove up to the spot. So the antenna was probably looking pretty close to the Earth.
1695915||LMP|In my talks I use a 35 mm slide of the TV picture of lift-off (which is necessarily grainy), and I say, 'Gene tried to persuade me to go out and get a really good picture of lift-off, but I declined.'
1695915||CDR|It would have been great to have a camera on the Moon to watch the Lunar Module come in for a landing. I'd love to have that.
1695915||LMP|- (Philosophically) "Some day.
1700100||CDR|I sit here (looking at the picture) and swear that I parked the Rover with the wheels straight. That's the final parking? Well, we're behind the LM and it's about the right distance.
1700100||LMP|Why doesn't it have a fender?
1700100||CDR|I took it off. Both of them. I took them both home.
1700442||LMP|Bendix built a production unit (of the gravimeter) that they put through thermal/vibration qualification tests. The qual unit was presumably identical to the flight unit.
1700442||CDR|They generally had a flight unit, a backup unit, and a qual unit (of most pieces of equipment).
1700442||LMP|My guess is that they didn't build a backup gravimeter.
1701810||LMP|- (Telling Gene the LSG story) "The LSG was supposed to be a very-long-period gravimeter to sense free-oscillations of the Moon if a gravity wave went by. It was the only potential Nobel-Prize-winning experiment ever taken into space by Apollo. From the very beginning - the initial drawings - they had a mis-design on the weight of the balance beam by a tenth of a gram. It was never picked up. And I didn't know if you remember or not, but when we deployed the flight hardware for the last time in that big Air Force hanger (at the Cape)...We had insisted on deploying the flight hardware. They weren't happy about that, but we insisted on doing it and they had to repack it. But at that time, we stood around and talk about it and I asked "Have you tested the uncaging of the balance beam in a simulated one-sixth g tilt plane?" And they said, "No." And I said "Why?" And they said, "Because the manufacturer had said it would disclose proprietary information." So I probably said, "Well, you ought to do it," and then just forgot about it. Nobody ever tested the uncaging of that balance beam. And it wouldn't uncage. It was just that one-tenth of a gram too heavy and wouldn't uncage to the degree necessary to be a long-period gravimeter. And if you want to be upset about something, you can be upset about that.
1702344||CDR|We hadn't gotten off the surface yet, and we still needed all the help we could get.
1702344||LMP|Somebody, I think, had put the message on a rung of the ladder.
1702344||CDR|I guess it had to be up there. It was just as I barely got out. I guess I've got to go along with that. My nature would have been to see that and read it. It was a response to whoever put it there.
1702344||LMP|It may have been pasted on the strut.
1702625||CDR|I can sit here and, just as sure as I'm alive at this moment, I can remember placing that camera (on the Rover seat). And I thought it was such a crime to leave a Hasselblad. But we were going to point it with the lens up so that, someday when someone goes back there, they can see the degradation of the lens from the cosmic radiation. And I guess I didn't do it. What can I tell you.
1702952||LMP|emerges from behind the LM, moving a ways north
1703047||LMP|I grabbed one of the unused core tubes, grabbed hold of the strut, and leaned on it underneath the LM, just behind the strut, and pushed it in as far as I could. And I think it went in about two-thirds of the way, and then I capped it.
1703541||CDR|Jack was supposed to turn the tracking light on so that I could see if it was blinking. Ron needed to track us visually. Bob was getting quite worried about us getting in, because I remember that I told him, 'Don't worry, we're doing it.' Jack and I felt like we had our act together. We weren't pushing against oxygen starvation or anything like that. I can see the guys back here in the MOCR saying, 'Get 'em in, get 'em in. They're down to mission-critical oxygen, a mission rule,' or what have you. But this is a time when we really felt we had it together. We knew what we were doing, we knew what we had to do. We'd been in and out of that hatch three or four times already.
1703541||LMP|It looks like I got in in two and a half minutes.
1703541||CDR|It looks like you got in awful quick.
1703853||LMP|I wouldn't be surprised if we had almost a hundred pounds in that big bag. I think that all the big rocks were in there. But it's strange, that's still not a lot of weight. We must have been feeling the mass more than the weight.
1703853||CDR|Relatively, I guess it was heavy. We didn't pick up a hundred pounds of stuff very often. We picked up the Rover together; but everything else we picked up - relatively speaking - was a lot lighter than that.
1704507||LMP|I don't remember exactly where the shutoff was, but I just never could reach it. Maybe not even in training. With his longer arms, Gene could handle it. I was probably standing facing the rear - which would have made it easy for him to get to the shutoff. Or, maybe I was facing inboard helping him with the door. It would have been a whole lot easier with more room in the LM; of course, (laughing) the suit probably would have expanded to fill it. Parkinson's Law applied to lunar modules.
1704507||LMP|It disturbs me that I did training for this for over a year and it didn't get permanently imbedded in long-term memory. I wonder if actors remember their scripts? Probably not. It's probably all short-term stuff, except for pieces. But still, I trained for Apollo 15 - the same procedures. So it was 30 months and, God knows how many of these (rehearsals) we really did in that period of time. We never memorized the checklist - never tried to. The fact is, that would have been a bad thing to do, to work from memory. You'd be taking a risk of forgetting something. That's why you had the cue cards. But it's strange; why would I not remember having that difficulty (with the feedwater shutoff).
1704823||LMP|When Gene gets business-like, he sometimes talks too fast.
1704911||LMP|This sounds like Gene's hands were bothering him. Whatever he might have said later, he was happy to get those gloves off.
1704932||LMP|There was dust on everything we wore. Gene succeeded in falling and I did too - several times. The helmets had a lot of dust on them, and I suspect we got them pretty badly scratched. I don't remember the scratches very well, but we did talk about it a couple of times. However, the dust we brought in was almost all on the floor; it didn't come up and permeate the LM until we went weightless after lift-off. And then there was a lot of it. After the EVAs, there was dust flying around because, at least on the first EVA, I had a reaction to breathing it; but I don't remember there being a noticeable film of it on the instruments or anything else.
1704932||LMP|What Gene was saying about Ron is that we had to take one of the helmet covers (that is, one of the @alsjurl/alsj-LEVA.html"@alsjt>LEVAs</a>) up to him so he could use it on his EVA to retrieve the film packets from the Scientific Instrument Bay (in the Service Module). Ron would never have admitted to anything (like a scratched visor) that would have kept him from doing his EVA. That was his next big thing; that's what he was really looking forward to.
1704932||CDR|Once we got to orbit, I don't think the dust was as bad as I was afraid it would be. We were concerned and were thinking about wearing our helmets to keep the dust out through the whole lift-off and rendezvous. We did wear them for lift-off, but I don't think we did for rendezvous.
1705257||LMP|Driving back from Station 5, the RCUs would have been facing into the Sun. Driving back from Station 9, they would be shaded. So you probably won't find that comment here. I don't remember if I've mentioned this but, on the long drive coming back from Station 4, I noticed the warmth of the Sun penetrating the suit on my forearm. I would ride with my forearm more or less across my chest. There was a shoulder detent that let you do that so that you could work out in front of your chest. Riding in the Rover I'd just rest my right arm in that detent. So, during the drive back into the Sun from Station 4 to Station 5 and then on to the LM, I noticed the warmth - finally - penetrating the seven layers of Mylar and warming that forearm. And it really felt good - a little therapy for those sore forearm muscles. I was probably using my left hand to take pictures and wouldn't have had that arm in the detent.
1705257||CDR|I know what Jack's saying, but I think that "detent" is the wrong word. There was enough friction (in the cabling) that you could put your arm in certain places and it would stay there, but I don't think there were any detents.
1705603||LMP|Between here and about 171:01, it sounds like there was some recovery in my voice from the let down of getting back in and struggling to get the LM configured and pressurized and stuff like that. By 171:01, I sound much more businesslike.
1710405||LMP|At the recent - 1991 - Lunar Science Conference, a paper was presented on taking a new look at the Lunar Sounder data. And, basically, when they tried to analyze the original data, they found they really didn't have the capability to analyze it very well. Some of the digitized data that was produced here on Earth after the film data came back has disappeared. The film data is still refrigerated and in the NASA archives. There was some holographic data - and I don't understand what that means with regard to this data - and another look is being taken at it. It looks like there is still some very interesting stuff in it about large-scale layering in the lunar mare. But the sad thing is that some of the digitized data was not retained in the archives. Hopefully, somebody is going to put some effort into redoing all that. We'll see. The @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#S7253472"@alsjt>Lunar Sounder</a> was the granddaddy of the SIR system (Side-looking Imaging Radar) that flies on the Shuttle and looked at the Sahara, for example, and saw all those old water courses.
1710448||LMP|On the way out to the Moon, I started doing some exercises in which I would lie underneath the couch and grip a cross strut and run in place against the back wall of the lower equipment bay and try and get my heart rate as high as I could - just for exercise. And the flight controllers responsible for the cryogenic tanks (in the Service Module) found that the vibration was causing the tanks to stir without turning on what they called the 'fan' inside of it.
1710709||LMP|Apparently, the MCC-H Conference was just a 60 minute pad they built into the flight plan in case we had to talk about lift-off or a LM problem of something like that.
1710945||LMP| I don't remember the backup plan for an EVA transfer and, as we were listening to this, I thought we were checking out the OPSs so that we could take one of them up for Ron to use for his EVA.
1710945||CDR|We did use an OPS as a backup for Ron's EVA. But Ron wore hoses for his EVA and was pressurized off of spacecraft oxygen. We would never have let him go out on the OPS alone. But, we had to bring the OPSs up any way, for our EVA contingency. We'd already paid the weight penalty to bring it up to orbit, so it made sense to use one as a backup for Ron. He was out there and exposed. He could have ripped his suit or a hose could have popped off.
1710945||LMP|There was also a plan for using one of the OPSs if we had to hot-wire the LM. This last-ditch procedure was to take a line out to the batteries in the Descent Stage to Gene's circuit breaker panel to open the propellant valves. You didn't make the connection to the circuit breaker panel right away; because, as soon as you did, the valves would open and you'd be on your way. So you'd come back in (after connecting the wire to the batteries) and then, when you were finally ready to go, you'd touch the circuit breakers and hot-wire the hypergolic valves in the Ascent Stage. I think we went through that drill once to know where the batteries were.
1710945||CDR|It would have been a last ditch effort. The hatch would have been open and the wires would have ripped off.
1710952||LMP|To check the regulator, you had to have the hose blocked off and I was saying that I may not have done that. As I recall, there was a place you locked the hose in to seal it off; and then you opened the valve to see how it regulated into the hose. I interpret what I said here to mean that the hose wasn't locked down and that there was some flow out. But that would have given a lower regulated pressure; so, I don't understand this. Getting the check to come out right was important because, if you had to keep a PLSS, you might have to throw away some rocks!
1711009||CDR|Obviously, it didn't concern us. If it was regulating at 4.25 it would have made your suit harder, but it still would have been okay. If it had been regulating at 2.0, it would have been something different.
1712203||CDR|Each pound mattered. I'm not saying that we would have thrown out a pound of rock. There were margins. But, weight translated into less Delta-V(elocity) and into fuel.
1714010||LMP|Don ran a group of contractor representatives who were outside the Mission Control Building in the tall building to the west. I can't remember the building number. And they were there to support any engineering data analysis that had to be done. This recorder, I gather, was gathering a lot of LM engineering data. I remember the recorder but I can't tell you why it only had eight hours of tape on it. But I must have left it on when we went out.
1714047||LMP|Knowing Bob, I think he was saying that we should jettison me! Don was not going to be pleased.
1714050||LMP|This was a reference to <a href="http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/m-n.htm"@alsjt>Owen Morris</a>, the head of the Lunar Module Project Office. <a href="../AaronCohen.html"@alsjt>Aaron Cohen</a> watched over the Command and Service Module for George Low and Owen worked on the LM.
1714123||CDR|The dust covers went over the wrist rings and were added to the program fairly late, I think, and maybe even for our flight. As I remember, they were a pain in the butt and I was adamantly against them. I was not happy about having one more piece of gear; and I remember that I got in some disagreements with some people about even having to carry them. But they wanted them to be part of the uniform and we did use them. And I will eat a little crow, because they did work better than I thought they would. Considering the amount of problems we had with dust, they did serve a good purpose.
1714236||CDR|Generally, we each put on one of our own gloves and then helped the other guy with his second glove. Although it was possible to get both of your own on, it was generally easier with the buddy system.
1714251||CDR|There were a couple of buttons that you had to push down at the same time to unlock the wrist ring; but, to get the glove on, you just had to push it in and it snapped over. And then we had lock-locks on those gloves to make sure.
1715320||LMP|The PLSSs were handed in for egress training and we may not have had PLSSs in the cabin, just to protect the equipment.
1715339||CDR|The PLSSs were all the same but, for some reason, the decision was made quite late on to use my backup. I don't know what happened to the primary.
1715349||LMP|I was leaning over the hatch and pushing the PLSS out with my hands. Gene was probably watching out the window. I don't think I could see down the ladder and just saw it bounce a little bit.
1715615||CDR|I remember that one of the PLSSs sort of got hung up on the porch and I had to get way out with my leg to get it unstuck. You didn't have room to throw them out; you just had room to push them out.
1720329||LMP|Charlie thought that all parts of the Moon looked just like all other parts of the Moon. And I think the TV of Taurus-Littrow changed his mind. He and John were in a pretty desolate, unscenic place at the Descartes site.
1720415||CDR|Charlie was CapCom on Apollo 10. When Tom Stafford and I went down in the Lunar Module over the top of the Apollo 11 landing site, I said 'Boy, we are down among 'em,' meaning that it seemed like we were going right down over the mountain tops.
1720558||LMP|We probably never decided who would go out (for a one-man EVA). The back half of the page is something immaterial to the one-man EVA, and this remark suggests that we had had some discussion about who was going to be the one man.
1720558||CDR|It wasn't discussed in that much detail but, if we only had one PLSS, I suppose that - politically - we would have to have had a geologist go out. But, I guarantee you that Cernan would have been out there during part of it. We probably wouldn't have bothered with the Rover, because you wouldn't let one guy get that far away. But we probably would have each done a shortened EVA. A four-, five-, six-hour EVA - whatever we thought we could have done. And then have the other guy go out and do another one and, at least, stay there a couple of days. I don't remember specifically what our plan was; but that was one thing I always dreaded - that we would be faced with only one PLSS. That would have really compromised us. But there was no question that we would have both gone out. I wasn't going to go that far - a second time - and not go out on the surface. Period. But it would have been impractical, as well, not to have Jack go out - being a geologist. That was part of the reason for the whole trip.
1720710||LMP|The early plan, the first design reference mission that Grumman put together, was a fuel-cell vehicle. And what killed the fuel cells were the fuel-cell problems that Gemini ran into. And that scared the managers, so they went to batteries. It's unfortunate, because the Apollo fuel cell was a different fuel cell
1720710||CDR|We also had a Block II development of solar panels to take with us.
1723702||CDR|The pictures speak for themselves. We were pretty happy, pretty tired, and pretty dirty. Look at the faces and you can see the sense of satisfaction. And look at how dirty...look at how filthy we are! And hot. I guarantee you that underwear was soaked.
1723702||LMP|In all four of the pictures that we took of each other in the cabin, one things you can see is a prominent vein in the foreheads of both of us. Normally, you don't see it. Sometimes it will show up when you laugh and you get a lot more blood flow into your head. But I don't think I was smiling hard enough in these pictures for that to happen. Here, it's an illustration of the excess blood volume that goes into the upper body in reduced gravity. Even in one-sixth gravity, even after this long a time, and even after we'd sloughed off a lot of fluid by this time. We'd probably each lost about ten pounds because we'd lost a lot of fluids." See, also, Journal Contributor Anil Sahal's @alsjurl/alsj-fullness.html"@alsjt>discussion</a>
1724657||LMP|We were stowing the bags to optimize the center of gravity and, therefore, fuel consumption - particularly RCS fuel.
1732009||LMP|What it sounds like is that Deke sent Ken to negotiate a minimum list of questions - which I would have argued against. You want to get information when it's fresh. And we weren't using the whole eight hour rest period anyway, so you could cut the time out of the rest period (rather than the geology debrief).
1732853||LMP|I don't know where I got the number 'fifty', but I'd copied Pads a lot of times in training and a lot of times during the mission. There were a lot of them.
1733136||LMP|Because I was using the term 'anorthositic gabbro', it doesn't appear that it had really struck me yet that it (the vesicular Station 6 rock-type) was a partially molten breccia.
1733738||LMP|In this point in my thinking, I hadn't come to the ultimate conclusion that was made; and that was that Van Serg hit into a very deep zone of regolith and that the breccias we were seeing were primarily regolith breccias or what was once called 'instant rock' created by the impact. The reason that the regolith was deep there was that several large craters had superimposed their ejecta blankets in that particular region. So the regolith was probably 30 or maybe more meters thick, in contrast to the five meters out on the valley floor itself.
1733928||LMP|The material was apparently quite viscous but still hot (when it landed). It didn't shatter but broke. It was probably glassy when it hit, with some crystals in it.
1734038||LMP|I think I wasn't answering the question. I'm not sure, but photographs show that there was dark, fine-grained material streaming down the wall of Van Serg. And I'm not sure I noticed that, except in the photographs. Van Serg was actually a bench crater and the dark material was stopping at the bench. It may be that I described that. We'll see. After the mission, the people who looked at the soil samples found devitrified orange glass spheres. There was probably fire-fountaining along the bounding faults of the valley at the foot of the Massifs. That's the most likely place for the conduits to have developed.
1734613||LMP|The Sculptured Hills are almost certainly a variety of the ejecta blanket of the Orientale Basin. Why they have a different surface texture, I don't know. I think what was bothering me here is that we were seeing a large number of basaltic fragments up on the side of the Sculptured Hills where we were sampling. How they got there, I don't know. But we weren't too far from Cochise, Henry, and Shakespeare and they may be ejecta from those craters. Those are pretty big craters - as big as Camelot - and Camelot certainly had a lot of subfloor basalt around it. The theory I expressed here probably wasn't very good, except for the comments about the orthopyroxene anorthosite rock. That's good logic.
1735911||LMP|Ken was being very diplomatic.
1742325||LMP|I think there were storage racks on the right and left-hand sides and, if I remember correctly, they had fabric covers.
1742325||CDR|The rock boxes stacked on top of each other where my PLSS had been on the port bulkhead. They were locked in with pins.
1745248||CDR|I think we had two pairs of EVA gloves because that was a single point failure to the suit.
1750050||LMP|We had some soft cotton towels which we could wet with the water gun.
1751659||LMP|This was an antenna on the LM for receiving EVA transmissions. The ground could monitor signal strengths and just pick whichever antenna was getting the best strength - either the Rover or the LM.
1832959||LMP|(Laughing) You're being overly generous. I didn't hear any successful harmony.
1832959||CDR|Can you imagine (the scene) down in the MOCR. They're quietly sitting there watching the systems and figuring out what their going to do next and off the open carrier comes this noise.
1833520||CDR|Here we are, after three days of exploring the lunar surface. We're coming up on an extremely critical portion of the mission - lifting off from the surface - and the conversation is so casual. It just strikes me. We've got food spilled all over; they start playing songs; we're singing to them.
1833520||LMP|I wonder if, in the journals of other explorers, there is this light-hearted overlay to what was otherwise a stressful adventure. I wonder if there's any sign of the synergistic humor that human beings have among themselves - the kind where, if you read it, it doesn't sound very humorous, but you know it's there.
1833520||CDR|This conversation is laid back; and, yet, there is business involved. We ask for the status of the Challenger and so on. But, then, when you read on, Jack's got a poem. It just strikes me that we were confident, confident that we are proceeding along on the plan. I think the mood is worth commenting on and, as I look back on it, I'm proud of it. We weren't stereotypes going bang, bang through the checklist. We woke up, we sang them a song, and we're sitting back and eating breakfast. And you've got to picture what's going on. Jack and I are in our long underwear with our suits piled up behind us - it's like four people in the little lunar module - sitting wherever we can. And they ask for the PGNS and you just reach over and get it. I wish there had been a mini-camera inside the spacecraft. It's the kind of thing you want to relate to other people. We were a quarter million miles away from home; we'd done something unique; we had something extremely significant still to do; and we had to take things in stride, one step at a time. We were feeling pretty good about it. We were ready to take our spoils back home. It might have been a case of rewarding ourselves for what we'd done.
1833520||LMP|There are photographs of Gene and me in the LM (AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20521"@alsjt>20521</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20530"@alsjt>20530</a> are examples) and I think the looks on our faces tell the story. The fact that we took the time to take pictures of ourselves says a lot.
1833827||CDR|I still think it's a classic. That's what I meant (a little while ago) about the tone of the moment.
1833920||LMP|The Apollo 8 reference is that somebody in the MOCR wrote a paraphrased version of 'The Night Before Christmas' and I read it up to the crew. As a kid I had given recitations of it.
1833920|David Woods|LMP|During the last week of Apollo 8 training, with which I was deeply involved, I came down with a case of intestinal flu. As a result, I immediately isolated myself from physical contact with the crew. Frank, however, initially thought that his bout of space adaptation intestinal discomfort was the consequence of being exposed to me. Thus, references to 'Typhoid Jack.' If you look at his book, I think that he later admitted that it was a result of space adaptation.
1834039||CDR|Obviously, I did not leave the LMP's camera on the Rover pointed at the zenith. But I swear I put something there. It's possible it could have been the 500 lens, because we didn't bring it back and I mentioned it was under the seat. I know that I did something with a camera. Now, it could have been a lens. And I stuck it between the seats, sort of wedged it in somewhere, and pointed the lens toward the zenith.
1834039||LMP|Houston wanted us to jettison the camera because they didn't want us to take pictures of Ron Evans' EVA. They had decided it was too cumbersome and too risky. But, we were going to ignore them, and we figured out how we could do it. But we needed a camera. Ron had a camera, but it was not EVA-qualified.
1834039||CDR|We had made up our minds we were going to take pictures of Ron.
1834039||LMP|And we needed a lunar-surface camera to do it.
1834039||CDR|Now, we did put the LMP's camera in the jett bag, so we must have had mine.
1834639||LMP|Our rest period was normally eight hours, and we were usually a little late getting started.
1834639||CDR|We'd sit around and talk and Jack'd stick his finger in the rock bag.
1834705||LMP|The wet packs were the original form of the Army's irradiated Meal-Ready-To-Eat.
1834705||CDR|They were cold, not warm.
1834705||LMP|We had four kinds, as I recall: peanut butter, a hamburger, wieners...
1834705||CDR|Ham in a kind of gravy, and roast beef.
1834705||LMP|Maybe there were five, then. And there was a fruit cake, too. And it was really pretty good. They were our best meals.
1834705||CDR|It was a good change from eating all the rehydrated food.
1841501||LMP|RLS was probably the REFSMMAT Landing Site.
1841501||CDR|I haven't heard that word for years. It was the coordinates of the landing site so that we would know where we were lifting off from.
1844034||CDR|We had some strap-on thigh pockets. I think we called them our 'checklist pockets' because we could slip our checklists in them. (Chuckling) And you know, we were ahead of the ground on a lot of things.
1844034||LMP|But it's nice to have them thinking for you.
1844059||CDR|We needed to take a leak (urinate) before we donned the suits.
1854752||LMP|I think the original LM data recorder was to record engineering data that they didn't put on the telemetry. And then, for having screwed that up (by not turning the recorder off before going outside for EVA-3), I said I owed Don something. He sort of honchoed the third or fourth tier of industrial people that were watching over the missions. And it would be the kind of data they were interested in.
1855005||LMP|Gene decided he liked that better, and I decided I liked the nylon liners. Neither one of them kept us from getting abraded and bruised.
1860402||CDR|You get the pressure in the cabin low enough that you can get the hatch open; but there's still a tremendous force on it and I had to hold it open to get it all the way down.
1860524||LMP|There were all kinds of nooks and crannies in the LM, now. Not just the ordinary nooks and crannies, but we had bags that had gotten pressurized and, so, everything was venting. It didn't happen instantaneously. I don't remember thinking about that at the time, but that's probably what it was. There were just lots of sources of oxygen.
1860552||CDR|A lot of things we would just set down in front of the hatch and - pop - just kick them out. It was easy enough to do that. Kick them far enough to clear the porch.
1861400||CDR|We had some indentations in the floor to hook (the @alsjurl/restraints.jpg"@alsjt>tethers</a>) onto, so there must have been some adapter we had to put in.
1864916||LMP|These were all contingency PADs and there was only a limited amount of information that could be stored in the computer.
1874005||LMP|The AGS used what they called strapdown gyros. It integrated accelerations from those gyros to give three-axis velocities. It carried its own state vector, but much less precisely.
1874302||CDR|I think he pumped the cabin up because he had to use oxygen out of the Command Module to pressurize the tunnel, so he wanted to build up the pressure so that he could vent it into the tunnel once we were docked.
1875222||LMP|On our gauges, the pressures for the two tanks were different, and they should have been the same. Down below (187:54:07), Gordo will tell us that they think there's a transducer problem.
1875626||CDR|We had two sources of propellant for the RCS systems. One was their own tanks and, for the other, we could crossfeed and utilize ascent propellant. We did that during the ascent phase to save the RCS fuel for rendezvous. We had a margin in the ascent tanks to cover that.
1875751||CDR|In listening to this, it's obvious that we were pretty confident. I know how prepared we were and I'm still impressed. I'd have to go back and study and learn this all over again. It sounds to me like we knew exactly what we were going to do in the event of a no-light. You get to a point where you hope it never happens but you almost dare something to fail. Because you know that, if it does, you're prepared to handle it. I don't specifically remember why I was going to wipe out the thrusters (by rotating the control through all thruster positions), but I think we had to reinitialize something - maybe zero the AGS.
1880120||CDR|This was a routine in the PGNS to start recording data from the accelerometers.
1880139||LMP|As I recall, at the moment of ignition, all we had was static - loud static. And I was looking to see what happened, to see if I'd lost lock.
1880139||CDR|Jack spent half of the lift-off trying to get comm back.
1880139||LMP|And I remember somebody telling me that what had happened was that they had a site handover scheduled right at lift-off! And nobody caught it.
1880342||CDR|We had a table of altitude, attitude, and rate of climb. That was a manual backup that told us if we were on our trajectory or not - and a manual backup to tell us that the PGNS was doing what it was supposed to.
1880621||CDR|As I remember, the time to get fuel out of the ascent tanks (for the RCS) was when we had a g-force because, once we were in zero-g, we could not have gotten any even if there was some left. Now they've decided that we've taken enough of the ascent fuel for the RCS. They don't want to get the ascent fuel any lower because they want it for the ascent engine, itself. So, the RCS is now going on it's own tanks - which are full at this point, and that's important. Well, they're not full, because we didn't cross feed on the descent.
1880849||CDR|As I remember, my intent was to let the PGNS shut it down and, if it didn't within a second afterwards, I was going to. I think I shut it down anyway. I wasn't going to let it send us into orbit around the Sun. But I was less concerned about the shutdown than the start. I was told that, at lift-off, I beat the PGNS start by some micro-cosmo of a second.
1881715||summary|The Ascent burn lasted about 7 minutes and 18 seconds and it put the Challenger crew into an elliptical orbit with a low point of 9 nautical miles above the Moon and a high point of 50. It was a nearly perfect burn. At 12 minutes 12 seconds after launch, Gene did series of RCS (Reaction Control System) firings - called "tweak burns" - to fine tune the orbit. Compared with their 5500 foot-per-second (fps) orbital speed, the velocity change that Gene wanted - 4 fps aft (down through the ascent engine bell), 1 fps out the plus-Z axis (out the windows), and 9 fps left (toward Gene's side of the spacecraft) - was trivial in the extreme. However, they wouldn't rendezvous with Ron for another hour and a half - not until they'd gone around the backside of the Moon and were in radio contact with Earth again - and a net speed change of 10 feet per second meant the difference between a perfect rendezvous and a miss of several kilometers. Better to do the tweak now, with a small engine burn, rather than later with a bigger one.
1881931||summary|Because the required velocity change was so small, Gene actually did three separate RCS firings - one for each of the three spacecraft axes. With Jack watching the AGS (Abort Guidance Computer), Gene fired the thrusters associated with the x-axis - which ran up through the Ascent Engine bell to the overhead hatch - until the AGS told them that they had made the desired 1 fps velocity change. Then he did the z-axis change - the z-axis runs from the rear of the cabin forward toward the hatch - and, finally, the y-axis (left/right) change. By the time they were done, they were 125 miles behind and below the Command-and-Service Module (CSM).
1882044||summary|The LM crew was flying in an orientation such that, when they got close enough, they would have a clear view of their sister ship. About 18 minutes after the launch, Gene got his first visual sighting of the CSM. He and Jack had just passed through the sunrise terminator into darkness and, although Ron was still out in front of them, he was high enough that he was still in sunlight. Moments later, Ron also passed into darkness and, once his eyes adjusted to the lower light levels, he spotted the tracking light on Challenger.
1885044||summary|The two spacecraft were now about 112 miles apart, engines quiet and following paths which, through the magic of orbital mechanics, would soon bring them together. Fifty minutes after launch, Challenger and America disappeared behind the Moon and, by the time they reappeared, forty-five minutes later, they were only 0.8 miles apart and were closing at a stately 30 fps. Gene and Jack had their backs to the Moon and were looking almost straight up at Ron in the CSM. Ron, too, had a good view. His TV camera was mounted in one of the CSM windows so that Houston and the rest of the world could watch Challenger as it seemingly rose up from the lunar surface. Gradually, Gene slowed his approach and, at a separation of only 100 feet, he stopped. Then Ron did a slow rotation of the CSM so that the LM crews could do a visual examination of the ship that would take them all home.
1900141||summary|As the two ships passed over the landing site for the first time since lift-off, Gene and Ron maneuvered into docking attitude and then, ever so slowly, Gene inched closer. There was no need to hurry. They were going to spend the next two days in lunar orbit, gathering more data and adding to the wealth of visual observations that Ron had already provided. Fifteen minutes after they started to maneuver, the two spacecraft were docked and, in a few minutes more, they were sure that all the latches were secure. They had a hard dock and could open the hatches, clear the connecting tunnel and begin to transfer the precious lunar samples.
1902219||summary|After the message from the President, Gene made a gracious statement of thanks and then Jack and Ron added brief thanks of their own. But, inside, Jack was steaming. Apollo was ending, but there were still 27 years left in the century and he hated the thought of an American President telling a whole generation that they would have no chance to do their own lunar exploration. But there was nothing Jack could do but suppress his anger and, in the meantime, there was some more exploration that he and the others could do before they headed home.
1904130||summary|Once the hatches were open and the tunnel was cleared, Ron passed over the vacuum cleaner and Gene and Jack got busy with the worst of the dust. LOS (Loss-of-signal) came about forty minutes after the docking and, by the time Apollo 17 re-emerged three quarters of an hour later, Gene and Jack were handing sample containers over to Ron. With his own interests in mind, Ron also made sure that they had all the helmets and gloves and other gear that they would need for his EVA. Once they had left lunar orbit and were on their way home, Ron was going to go outside, secured with a tether, to retrieve film canisters from the SIM (Scientific Instrument Module) Bay. The EVA promised to be the highlight of the mission for Ron and he didn't want to lose out on his chance by leaving a helmet or a glove behind in the LM.
1920126||summary|The rocks and the helmets and gloves were all safely aboard America and, indeed, the Command Module was so full of rocks and astronauts that the only way they were going to get a little elbow room was to get rid of a jettison bag that Ron had been filling for the last three days. Consequently, just before they closed the LM hatch for the last time, the astronauts tossed the bulging jett bag into the now empty cabin of the LM. Challenger had one last mission to accomplish. She was headed back down to the Moon for a planned impact on the eastern flank of the South Massif, a final sacrifice to the gods of seismology; and, as Challenger made her last trip down to the lunar surface. She also had the unglamorous - but necessary - job of carrying the trash.
1935803||summary|Because of the precision that was hoped for Challenger's impact, the jettison operation was carefully choreographed. The crew got their suits on and did a pressure check. Then they pressurized the connecting tunnel and, at about 194 hours into the mission, released the latches so that the pressure in the tunnel could gently push the two spacecraft apart. For another half hour, the flight controllers made sure that they could control the LM attitude; and then, at the proper moment, at 195 hours 38 minutes into the mission, they did a long firing of the LM's RCS thrusters. At launch from Earth, the LM was carrying 630 lbs of RCS propellant and, because things had gone so smoothly throughout the flight, there were still 450 pound left when the LM was released for it's final descent. During the long, 1 minute 56 second burn, another 270 pounds of propellants was expended, enough to trim 213 feet per second off the orbital speed of the 5277 pound Ascent Stage and send it toward impact with the South Massif.
1955244||summary|Because there were only 40 hours left before the crew was scheduled to leave lunar orbit, the instrumentation in the SIM Bay were still busily gathering data. There wasn't going to be another opportunity to gather close-up lunar data for a long time and a visual observation of the LM impact was of lesser importance than proper orientation of the Command Module for data gathering. Consequently, the crew was looking back along their ground track at the moment of impact and, because the LM was flying in a lower orbit, they were not yet over the landing site when it hit.
1955244||summary|Down on the lunar surface, the TV camera on the Rover was still in good working order and, as the moment of impact approached, Ed Fendell pointed it at the planned impact point high on the eastern slope. But there was a question. Because there was only a limited amount of tracking data that could be acquired in the 17 minutes between the end of the deorbit burn and the impact, predictions of the impact point were uncertain by about 10 to 15 kilometers. Fendell could look at most of the error ellipse if he pulled back on his zoom; but, with a wide field, he would have limited resolution, which would lower his chances of seeing anything. For several minutes, he played with the zoom and adjusted his pointing. However, in the end, he went to maximum zoom and aimed at the planned point and hoped for the best. Given the relatively poor resolution of the camera - even at maximum zoom - there wasn't much chance of success and, even though the LM did hit the mountain within a mile of the planned spot, nothing was seen by the eager audience in Houston. The seismometers that Jack had deployed at the ALSEP site recorded the impact, but there was nothing to be seen on the TV.
1955244||summary|The LM impacted with a speed of about 1.5 km/s and with a mass of 2400 kilograms. The impact energy was, therefore, 2.7e16 ergs. From a paper by V.R. Overbeck, we can estimate that the total displaced mass was about 6.7e8 grams. Then, if the mean density of the target material was 2.0 g/cc and the crater was conical in shape with a depth one-fourth its diameter, the crater diameter was about 17 meters.
2073710||summary|On their final full day in lunar orbit, the crew of Apollo 17 was going to spend most of their time doing out-the-window geology and the wake-up music was Roberta Flack's "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face." During the day, Jack, the professional geologist, and Ron, the seasoned lunar observer did most of the talking.
2134323||summary|Because of the discovery of orange soil at Shorty Crater at the landing site, they spent a lot of time looking for color at various places where they and the geologists in the Backroom thought that they might find other pyroclastic deposits. As they passed over the landing site, Ron noted that the orange coloration at Shorty was no longer visible but, a bit further west, in the Solpicius Gallus area in southwestern Mare Serenitatis, both he and Jack described numerous features that not only showed prominent orange, but also reds and reddish browns. Eventually, Jack saw enough that he was ready of offer an explanation of the colored layers.
2123445||summary|For most of the day, the astronauts described what they were seeing out the window. The large, mare-filled, Farside crater Tsiolkovsky was of particular interest and so, too, was Mare Symthii near the eastern rim. Jack, of course, tended to talk in terms of comparisons between the various features he was seeing and, at one point provided a lengthy discussion of the so-called "wrinkle-ridge" systems which bound the various mare. Jack was truly in a geologist's paradise and, at one point, Fullerton jokingly told the crew that a requested change in the comm configuration was being done "so that the secretaries that are transcribing the air-to-ground can catch up with Jack."
2200110||summary|Former President Harry S Truman - who had been in the crew's thoughts throughout the mission - was still in serious condition. He died the day after Christmas.
2365805||summary|The TEI (Trans Earth Injection) burn was done over the Farside about eight hours after wake-up. During their final hours in lunar orbit, all three of the astronauts passed along miscellaneous geology observations, but the burn was the main event and, when they emerged from behind the Moon for the last time, Gene was able to report a nearly perfect, 1/2 g burn.
2365805||summary|America climbed rapidly away from the Moon and, indeed, the increased altitude meant that AOS came more than 13 minutes early than it would have without the burn. The climb out from the Moon also gave the crew some new perspectives and they shared the view with Houston, especially a spectacular TV tour of the crater Tsiolkovsky. By the time the landing site came into view, they were 2000 miles out and they were beginning to lose detail.
2505316||summary|During the stop at Van Serg toward the end of the third EVA, Gene and Jack had been surprised and puzzled that this fairly sizable impact out in the middle of the valley was not the basaltic rocks that they had come to expect but, rather, some very fragile rocks that looked to be breccias - rocks made up of fragments of other rocks fused together by an impact. On the drive back to the LM, Jack had speculated that Van Serg had, by chance, hit a "window" in the basalt and had dug up underlying breccias but, he remembers not being very happy with the hypothesis. Because Van Serg is only a few tens of meters deep, the "window" hypothesis would require that, elsewhere in the valley where they did see basaltic rocks, the basaltic layer not be very thick. Consequently, Jack's thinking during the night may have been influenced by the report from Fullerton that the Traverse Gravimeter was indicating that the basaltic valley fill was three or four kilometers thick and, therefore, the Van Serg breccias had to be made from something that was lying on top of the basalt at that location. Perhaps they were actually clods of soil which had been highly compressed - turned into a fragile "instant" rock - in the impact. And, indeed, when the Van Serg breccias were examined back in Houston, they proved to be soil breccias - larger, more competent versions of the instant rock that Gene and Jack saw at the rims of smaller craters at several places in the valley.
2535912||summary|They put all the miscellaneous trash they'd accumulated since saying goodbye to Challenger and removed the center couch so that they'd have room for Ron to get out and for Jack to stand in the hatch and take pictures. (The jettison bag would drift off only slowly as they continued their journey and, once it hit the top of the atmosphere, would quickly burn up.)
2573359||summary|Gene advised Ron to be sure that, once he had made his way back to the SIM Bay, he got his feet firmly planted in the footholds before he did anything else. During Gene's "spacewalk", which was only the third which had ever been done and the first in which an astronaut attempted to do real work outside the spacecraft, Gene was hindered by a lack of hand and footholds. When he tried to use a wrench to turn a bolt, it was he who tended to turn and, coupled with the inadequate cooling capability of the Gemini suit, he had a very frustrating and tiring time of it. For later Gemini EVAs, hand and footholds were added to the outside of the spacecraft and, back at the Apollo 17 SIM Bay, there was a pair of good footholds for Ron to use.
2794140||summary|The ALFMED experiment was repeated on the trip back from the Moon, this time with all three of them wearing blindfolds. On that occasion, none of them reported any flashes. Readers may want to note, however, that the surgeon reported that the LMP seemed to be asleep during much of the homeward-bound experiment. ("My heart rate was very low anyway.")
3011718||summary|Three hours before splashdown, Gene gave America a nudge of 2.1 feet per second to fine tune his trajectory. Considering how far and how long they had traveled since the TEI burn, this minuscule burn was a testament to the men and women who and designed, built, and flown the Apollo spacecraft.
3043150||summary|America landed in the Pacific, 1.3 miles from its target. Crammed into the spacecraft with the crew were more samples and more frames of exposed film than any other crew had brought back to Earth and, although the splashdown marked the end of Apollo, it was a grand and fitting finale.
