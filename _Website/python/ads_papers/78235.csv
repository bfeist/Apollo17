Apatite and merrillite have been of particular interest, as they record vital information on the volatile content, U-Pb ages and trace-element composition of various planetary materials. However, the extent to which shock-deformation, pervasive among all planetary materials, affects the distribution of these valuable geochemical tracers is still poorly understood. Here we focus on exploring the U-Pb and Pb-Pb ages of apatite and merrillite in a set of variably shocked lunar rocks, building on previous nanostructural analyses of the phosphates.We carried out U-Pb and Pb-Pb analyses of phosphates in Apollo 17 samples of the Mg-suite rocks (76535, 76335, 76255, 72255, 78235 and 78236) using the CAMECA 1280 ion microprobe at the NordSIMS facility (Stockholm). In addition, we applied a recently developed approach of conducting high-precision U-Pb and Pb-Pb analyses by ID-TIMS of extracted phosphate grains (Jack Satterly Lab, University of Toronto). For this purpose, individual ~50x50x30 µm crystals of apatite and merrillite were extracted directly from thin sections using a Xe+ plasma FIB.As determined by SIMS, 207Pb/206Pb systematics of the unshocked or weakly shocked apatite in 76535 and 76335 is undisturbed, implying cooling of the rock below the closure temperature of Pb diffusion in apatite (~450°C) at ~4.2 Ga, ~100 Ma younger than what is interpreted as the rock's crystallization age. Phosphates that experienced similar levels of deformation but were in proximity or in direct contact with the impact melt in samples 76255 and 72255 show almost complete age resetting (~3.92 Ga). The SIMS determined age of 16 phosphates in sample 76255 is 3922.2 ± 6.7 Ma (2σ) and agrees with the previously published 207Pb/206Pb phosphate ages of impact melt breccias found within the same boulder and was interpreted as the timing of the Imbrium impact. These recrystallized phosphates yield comparable TIMS Pb-Pb ages (3917.8 ± 1.8 Ma and 3921.0 ± 1.3 Ma, 2σ) with significantly lower internal uncertainties than that of the individual SIMS measurements and may represent multiple impact-events close to the Imbrium event.SIMS U-Pb analyses of highly shocked phosphates (78235 and 78236) reveal a discordia line with an upper intercept of ~4.2 Ga and a lower intercept of ~0.5 Ga. We interpret this new, younger age as a minor thermal event that reactivated existing shock-induced nm-scale grain boundaries, as visualised by APT, within the apatite population to allow for Pb-loss at ~0.5 Ga. We propose a small crater located near the Apollo 17 landing site as a possible source of this sample.By correlating micro- to nanostructural characterization with in-situ age systematics we show that apatite and merrillite are powerful thermochronometers that provide a new approach to dating which has the potential to discriminate between temporally similar events. This can greatly aid in unravelling the bombardment record of solar system and be helpful when dealing with samples of limited availability (e.g. space return missions).|
2019M&PS...54.1262C|2019|Shock-induced microtextures in lunar apatite and merrillite|Černok, Ana, White, Lee Francis, Darling, James, Dunlop, Joseph, Anand, Mahesh|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|54|6|1262|Apatite and merrillite are the most common phosphate minerals in a wide range of planetary materials and are key accessory phases for in situ age dating, as well as for determination of the volatile abundances and their isotopic composition. Although most lunar and meteoritic samples show at least some evidence of impact metamorphism, relatively little is known about how these two phosphates respond to shock-loading. In this work, we analyzed a set of well-studied lunar highlands samples (Apollo 17 Mg-suite rocks 76535, 76335, 72255, 78235, and 78236), in order of displaying increasing shock deformation stages from S1 to S6. We determined the stage of shock deformation of the rock based on existing plagioclase shock-pressure barometry using optical microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and SEM-based panchromatic cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging of plagioclase. We then inspected the microtexture of apatite and merrillite through an integrated study of Raman spectroscopy, SEM-CL imaging, and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). EBSD analyses revealed that microtextures in apatite and merrillite become progressively more complex and deformed with increasing levels of shock-loading. An early shock-stage fragmentation at S1 and S2 is followed by subgrain formation from S2 onward, showing consistent decrease in subgrain size with increasing level of deformation (up to S5) and finally granularization of grains caused by recrystallization (S6). Starting with 2°-3° of intragrain crystal-plastic deformation in both phosphates at the lowest shock stage, apatite undergoes up to 25° and merrillite up to 30° of crystal-plastic deformation at the highest stage of shock deformation (S5). Merrillite displays lower shock impedance than apatite; hence, it is more deformed at the same level of shock-loading. We suggest that the microtexture of apatite and merrillite visualized by EBSD can be used to evaluate stages of shock deformation and should be taken into account when interpreting in situ geochemically relevant analyses of the phosphates, e.g., age or volatile content, as it has been shown in other accessory minerals that differently shocked domains can yield significantly different ages.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maps.13278
2014E&PSL.390..244B|2014|The origin of water in the primitive Moon as revealed by the lunar highlands samples|Barnes, Jessica J., Tartèse, Romain, Anand, Mahesh, McCubbin, Francis M., Franchi, Ian A., Starkey, Natalie A., Russell, Sara S.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|390||244|The recent discoveries of hydrogen (H) bearing species on the lunar surface and in samples derived from the lunar interior have necessitated a paradigm shift in our understanding of the water inventory of the Moon, which was previously considered to be a ‘bone-dry’ planetary body. Most sample-based studies have focused on assessing the water contents of the younger mare basalts and pyroclastic glasses, which are partial-melting products of the lunar mantle. In contrast, little attention has been paid to the inventory and source(s) of water in the lunar highlands rocks which are some of the oldest and most pristine materials available for laboratory investigations, and that have the potential to reveal the original history of water in the Earth-Moon system. Here, we report in-situ measurements of hydroxyl (OH) content and H isotopic composition of the mineral apatite from four lunar highlands samples (two norites, a troctolite, and a granite clast) collected during the Apollo missions. Apart from troctolite in which the measured OH contents in apatite are close to our analytical detection limit and its H isotopic composition appears to be severely compromised by secondary processes, we have measured up to ∼2200 ppm OH in the granite clast with a weighted average δD of ∼ -105±130‰, and up to ∼3400 ppm OH in the two norites (77215 and 78235) with weighted average δD values of -281±49‰ and -27±98‰, respectively. The apatites in the granite clast and the norites are characterised by higher OH contents than have been reported so far for highlands samples, and have H isotopic compositions similar to those of terrestrial materials and some carbonaceous chondrites, providing one of the strongest pieces of evidence yet for a common origin for water in the Earth-Moon system. In addition, the presence of water, of terrestrial affinity, in some samples of the earliest-formed lunar crust suggests that either primordial terrestrial water survived the aftermath of the putative impact-origin of the Moon or water was added to the Earth-Moon system by a common source immediately after the accretion of the Moon.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2014.01.015

K.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|88||603|Mg-suite noritic rocks can be divided into two groups, the Mg-gabbronorites and the Mg-norites. The rocks of these groups differ in ratios of high-Ca pyroxene to total pyroxene, compositions of pyroxene and plagioclase, assemblages of Ti-, Nb-, and Zr-bearing minerals, compositions of chrome spinel, bulk-rock Ti/Sm and Sc/Sm, and measured ages. The two groups probably crystallized from different types of parent magmas. Two hypotheses are offered for the differences in composition of the parent magmas. One hypothesis ascribes the differences to compositional heterogeneity of the mantle source areas. The other hypothesis ascribes the differences to variations in extent of partial melting of the mantle source regions and variations in extent of assimilation of the anorthosite and the highly differentiated residual liquid that were produced during the primordial lunar differentiation.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB088iS02p0A603

L.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|12||577|Data on the bulk chemical composition of the soils collected at and under the surface of the Apollo 16 landing site are synthesized and reviewed, with emphasis placed on the way in which the compositional trends within the soils relate to the site geology. Two distinct compositional mixing trends are discerned. One involves addition to this surface Cayley component of a material such as that ejected by North Ray Crater. The other is thought to be a segment of a mixing line between the average melt fraction of the local Cayley component and pure or nearly pure anorthosite. Grain size fractions of Apollo 16 soils exhibit a general trend of higher concentrations of large ion lithophile (LIL) elements associated with plagioclase in the finest fraction compared with the coarse fractions. The suite of pristine nonmare rocks (as currently recognized) is found to be insufficient to model the Apollo 16 soils.|

C., Miller, J. D., Jr.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||591|Attention is given to the significance of the results of a study of Ca, K, Ti, Fe, Mn, and Mg variations in plagioclase in highlands sample 67915,84. This polymict breccia from Outhouse Rock station 11 at the Apollo 16 site has been selected for study because it contains a wide variety of clast types, including a differentiated type-sodic ferrogabbro. It is found that the data on Ca, K, Ti, Fe, Mn, and Mg in plagioclase show no evidence of reaction between sodic ferrogabbro and breccia matrix clasts. Two groups of plagioclase compositions have been recognized in the breccia matrix. The data suggest that the prebreccia characteristics of plagioclase compositions have been preserved in 67915. Data on Mg/(Mg+FE) ratios suggest that the sodic ferrogabbro and the intermediate-Ca plagioclase clasts could be related to the Mg-rich plutonic rock suite and the high-Ca plagioclase clasts to the ferroan anorthosites.|
1980LPSC...11..365J|1980|Rocks of the early lunar crust.|James, O. B.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||365|Data are summarized which suggest a model for the early evolution of the lunar crust. According to the model, during the final stages of accretion, the outer part of the moon melted to form a magma ocean approximately 300 km deep. This ocean fractionated to form mafic and ultramafic cumulates at depth and an overlying anorthositic crust made up of ferroan anorthosites. Subsequent partial melting in the primitive mantle underlying the crystallized magma ocean produced melts which segregated, moved upward, intruded the primordial crust, and crystallized to form layered plutons consisting of Mg-rich plutonic rocks. Intense impact bombardment at the lunar surface mixed and melted the rocks of the two suites to form a thick layer of granulated debris, granulitic breccias, and impact-melt rocks.|

In addition, petrographic and chemical evidence is presented which shows that low-siderophile rocks are the result of endogenous igneous activity and not impact melt differentiation. For example, these rocks contain Fe-metal as a late-crystallizing phase, and have W/La ratios higher than polymict breccias.|
1979LPSC...10.1753H|1979|Regional chemical variations in lunar basaltic lavas.|Hubbard, N.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1753|The higher Al2O3 concentrations in mare soils at Apollo landing sites, relative to mare basalts, have generally been attributed to the presence of 20-30% of terra material in the mare surface regolith. This viewpoint is shown to be erroneous when entire maria are studied; the amount of terra material in typical mare surface regoliths is only about 5%, or less. The bulk of the mare soils are the comminuted remains of aluminous mare basalt flows. On a regional scale, the sample and orbital data for maria define prominent chemical variations that are well beyond those expected from simple igneous processes and therefore indicate that gradations in one or more of the major parameters of planetary differentiation caused these variations. The increasingly abundant evidence for regional variations in the chemical compositions of lunar basalts requires that regional petrogenetic provinces must be considered in models of lunar evolution.|

Both clasts are igneous rocks crystallized from melts that were probably internally generated; clast 27,80 is a cumulate, and the parent magmas of both rocks probably crystallized below the lunar surface. Despite similar history, the parent rocks of the two clasts appear to be derived from distinct magma types: the 27,80 is characterized by plagioclase and orthopyroxene as the major constituents and by a high K, Nb, and Zr content, while the 27,45 type also contains augite and has a low content of K, Nb, and Zr.|

One of these units is a high albedo plains-forming unit that has Al2O3 and MgO concentrations different from those of similar plains-forming units located in the terra west of Smythii and south of Crisium and also different from those of adjacent terra and mare materials. The chemical composition of the plainsforming unit suggests a volcanic origin; the inferred Al2O3 and MgO-rich nature of this presumed early volcanic material is supported by the fact that even the later, low albedo, lightly cratered mare fill in Mare Smythii has a high MgO value, and its Al2O3 concentration is higher than that of similar basaltic material in other maria.|

Report||||Samples returned from Apollo 14 (14171, 14305, 14319), Apollo 15 (15255), Apollo 16 (61175, 67455), and Apollo 17 (77215) were studied optically and selected polished sections by SEM/Microprobe. Splits and separates from 77215, 67455, 61175 and 15255 were prepared; 77215 and 67455 were analyzed for major, minor and LIL trace elements. The data indicate that 77215, a noritic breccia clast found in the Station7 boulder, is a norite cumulate similar to and probably derived from the same body as 78235. The Apollo 17 boulders are found to be part of the same melt sheet, which was formed by a major impact event, possibly Serenitatis, about 4 B. Y. ago. The Apollo 14 and 16 breccias are polymict, their clast populations indicating quite different provenance. The Apollo 14 breccias are possibly the result of multiple impacts, while the other breccias studied appear to have been formed by single impacts. ANT suite clasts included in 61175 are, for the most part, granulites resulting from subsolidus recrystallization of norites, anorthosites or gabbros. This metamorphism appears to have occurred prior to the impact event forming 61175.|

The rock is found to consist of approximately 30% low-Ca pyroxene, 55% Ca-rich plagioclase, and 15% glass veins. The composition of the glass veins is analyzed, and it is suggested that they resulted from shock melting of the norite. Comparisons with other noritic rocks indicate that the pyroxene in rock 78235 has P2<SUB>1</SUB> ca symmetry.
