2014E&PSL.390..244B|2014|The origin of water in the primitive Moon as revealed by the lunar highlands samples|Barnes, Jessica J., Tartèse, Romain, Anand, Mahesh, McCubbin, Francis M., Franchi, Ian A., Starkey, Natalie A., Russell, Sara S.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|390||244|The recent discoveries of hydrogen (H) bearing species on the lunar surface and in samples derived from the lunar interior have necessitated a paradigm shift in our understanding of the water inventory of the Moon, which was previously considered to be a ‘bone-dry’ planetary body. Most sample-based studies have focused on assessing the water contents of the younger mare basalts and pyroclastic glasses, which are partial-melting products of the lunar mantle. In contrast, little attention has been paid to the inventory and source(s) of water in the lunar highlands rocks which are some of the oldest and most pristine materials available for laboratory investigations, and that have the potential to reveal the original history of water in the Earth-Moon system. Here, we report in-situ measurements of hydroxyl (OH) content and H isotopic composition of the mineral apatite from four lunar highlands samples (two norites, a troctolite, and a granite clast) collected during the Apollo missions. Apart from troctolite in which the measured OH contents in apatite are close to our analytical detection limit and its H isotopic composition appears to be severely compromised by secondary processes, we have measured up to ̃2200 ppm OH in the granite clast with a weighted average δD of ̃ -105±130‰, and up to ̃3400 ppm OH in the two norites (77215 and 78235) with weighted average δD values of -281±49‰ and -27±98‰, respectively. The apatites in the granite clast and the norites are characterised by higher OH contents than have been reported so far for highlands samples, and have H isotopic compositions similar to those of terrestrial materials and some carbonaceous chondrites, providing one of the strongest pieces of evidence yet for a common origin for water in the Earth-Moon system. In addition, the presence of water, of terrestrial affinity, in some samples of the earliest-formed lunar crust suggests that either primordial terrestrial water survived the aftermath of the putative impact-origin of the Moon or water was added to the Earth-Moon system by a common source immediately after the accretion of the Moon.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2014.01.015

2010E&PSL.289..595D|2010|Osmium isotope and highly siderophile element systematics of the lunar crust|Day, James M. D., Walker, Richard J., James, Odette B., Puchtel, Igor S.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|289|3-4|595|Coupled <SUP>187</SUP>Os/ <SUP>188</SUP>Os and highly siderophile element (HSE: Os, Ir, Ru, Pt, Pd, and Re) abundance data are reported for pristine lunar crustal rocks 60025, 62255, 65315 (ferroan anorthosites, FAN) and 76535, 78235, 77215 and a norite clast in 15455 (magnesian-suite rocks, MGS). Osmium isotopes permit more refined discrimination than previously possible of samples that have been contaminated by meteoritic additions and the new results show that some rocks, previously identified as pristine, contain meteorite-derived HSE. Low HSE abundances in FAN and MGS rocks are consistent with derivation from a strongly HSE-depleted lunar mantle. At the time of formation, the lunar floatation crust, represented by FAN, had 1.4 ± 0.3 pg g <SUP>- 1 </SUP> Os, 1.5 ± 0.6 pg g <SUP>- 1 </SUP> Ir, 6.8 ± 2.7 pg g <SUP>- 1 </SUP> Ru, 16 ± 15 pg g <SUP>- 1 </SUP> Pt, 33 ± 30 pg g <SUP>- 1 </SUP> Pd and 0.29 ± 0.10 pg g <SUP>- 1 </SUP> Re (̃ 0.00002 × CI) and Re/Os ratios that were modestly elevated ( <SUP>187</SUP>Re/ <SUP>188</SUP>Os = 0.6 to 1.7) relative to CI chondrites. MGS samples are, on average, characterised by more elevated HSE abundances (̃ 0.00007 × CI) compared with FAN. This either reflects contrasting mantle-source HSE characteristics of FAN and MGS rocks, or different mantle-crust HSE fractionation behaviour during production of these lithologies. Previous studies of lunar impact-melt rocks have identified possible elevated Ru and Pd in lunar crustal target rocks. The new results provide no supporting evidence for such enrichments. If maximum estimates for HSE in the lunar mantle are compared with FAN and MGS averages, crust-mantle concentration ratios ( D-values) must be ≤ 0.3. Such D-values are broadly similar to those estimated for partitioning between the terrestrial crust and upper mantle, with the notable exception of Re. Given the presumably completely different mode of origin for the primary lunar floatation crust and tertiary terrestrial continental crust, the potential similarities in crust-mantle HSE partitioning for the Earth and Moon are somewhat surprising. Low HSE abundances in the lunar crust, coupled with estimates of HSE concentrations in the lunar mantle implies there may be a 'missing component' of late-accreted materials (as much as 95%) to the Moon if the Earth/Moon mass-flux estimates are correct and terrestrial mantle HSE abundances were established by late accretion.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2009.12.001

R., Tatsumoto, M.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|22||381|The U-Th-Pb, Rb-Sr, and Sm-Nd isotopic systematics of four lightly leached residues of pristine, high-Mg, troctolitic cumulate 76535 were analyzed in order to determine their ages and magma sources. The data indicate that the cumulate was in isotopic equilibrium with a fluid or magma characterized by a high U-238/Pb-204 (mu) value of 600 at 4.236 Ga. Two and three stage Pb evolution calculations define even greater source mu values of about 1000, assuming low lunar initial mu values between 5 and 40 prior to about 4.43 Ga. These results are similar to mu values for KREEP sources and are also consistent with values from 78235, suggesting that at least some high-Mg suite rocks were derived from magma sources with high-mu values similar to KREEP, and support that idea that these rocks postdate primary lunar differentiation and formation of ferroan anorthosites.|

R., Tatsumoto, M.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|21||89|Presently favored models predict large U-Pb fractionations during the Moon's earliest stages of evolution. Thus far, the extent of those fractionations is poorly constrained. Ancient lunar highland rocks may provide evidence of initial Pb isotopic compositions and U/Pb ratios of early lunar magma sources and possibly of a primary magma ocean. For these purposes, the authors chose to study 78235, a pristine, high-Mg noritic cumulate thought to be relict, ancient, deep-seated lunar crust.|

I.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1713|Electron probe microanalysis and analytical electron microscopy techniques were employed to obtain structural and chemical analyses of metal particles in the size range of less than 1000 A and greater than 5 microns from the glassy constituents of 3 lunar highland samples 65315, 67435 and 78235. Most of the micron size metal particles in the glass coatings of the three samples are of meteoritic Co-Ni content. The Ni content of submicron metal often differs significantly from the micron size metal in the same glass. This difference can be explained by one of 3 reasons: (a) the presence of metal of different sizes and Ni contents in the rock prior to the shock event, (b) the presence of metal particles in the lunar soil of meteoritic or variable Ni content which were incorporated when the glass formed and (c) the production of submicroscopic Fe metal from the reduction of Fe(+2) in the shock produced melt.|

Report||||Samples returned from Apollo 14 (14171, 14305, 14319), Apollo 15 (15255), Apollo 16 (61175, 67455), and Apollo 17 (77215) were studied optically and selected polished sections by SEM/Microprobe. Splits and separates from 77215, 67455, 61175 and 15255 were prepared; 77215 and 67455 were analyzed for major, minor and LIL trace elements. The data indicate that 77215, a noritic breccia clast found in the Station7 boulder, is a norite cumulate similar to and probably derived from the same body as 78235. The Apollo 17 boulders are found to be part of the same melt sheet, which was formed by a major impact event, possibly Serenitatis, about 4 B. Y. ago. The Apollo 14 and 16 breccias are polymict, their clast populations indicating quite different provenance. The Apollo 14 breccias are possibly the result of multiple impacts, while the other breccias studied appear to have been formed by single impacts. ANT suite clasts included in 61175 are, for the most part, granulites resulting from subsolidus recrystallization of norites, anorthosites or gabbros. This metamorphism appears to have occurred prior to the impact event forming 61175.|

A study of the rock has revealed the presence in the partly maskelynitized plagioclase of oriented sets of metallic iron rods, what appear to be sets of oriented transparent anisotropic iron-bearing silicate rods and disseminated hard aluminum-rich domains. It is suggested that the apparent nonopaque rods might have the hollandite structure and contain Fe(+3), while the Al-rich domains could represent iron-depleted regions in the plagioclase.|

In order to develop further the crystallization history for 78235, its subsequent shock history, and its relationship to other lunar crustal rocks, orthopyroxene, plagioclase, glass, and whole-rock samples were prepared and analyzed for major, minor, and trace elements. It is speculated that an early fractional crystallization event producing a layer of orthopyroxene-plagioclase cumulate with varying amounts of trapped liquid took place within 20 km of the surface of the moon.|

F.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||799|Lunar rock 78235 is a coarse-grained igneous rock which was chipped from the top of a boulder about 1/2 m in size at Station 8 at the base of the Sculptured Hills, Taurus-Littrow Valley. The rock is a shocked coarse-grained norite with a relict subophitic texture; it is composed of about equal proportions of chromian bronzite and anorthite. Evidence is presented for the shock history of the rock. It is concluded that 78235 is a deep-seated norite of cumulate origin which has been intensely shocked. Although it may be possible to account for the observed shock-induced features by invoking a single shock event, the evidence is best explained by a history which includes at least two discrete shock events. In the first identifiable shock event much of the plagioclase was transformed to maskelynite and the associated bronzite was deformed and acquired a mosaic structure. In a later shock event, localized melting of both plagioclase pyroxene occurred.|

M.|American Mineralogist|60||1086|A thin section of lunar rock 78235 is examined optically as well as with an electron microprobe and is shown to be a highly-shocked coarse norite. The rock is found to consist of approximately 30% low-Ca pyroxene, 55% Ca-rich plagioclase, and 15% glass veins. The composition of the glass veins is analyzed, and it is suggested that they resulted from shock melting of the norite. Comparisons with other noritic rocks indicate that the pyroxene in rock 78235 has P2<SUB>1</SUB> ca symmetry. Based on this symmetry plus the coarse grain size, it is concluded that rock 78235 was formed under plutonic conditions. The origin of the minor phases in this rock is briefly considered.|
