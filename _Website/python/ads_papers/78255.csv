K.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|88||603|Mg-suite noritic rocks can be divided into two groups, the Mg-gabbronorites and the Mg-norites. The rocks of these groups differ in ratios of high-Ca pyroxene to total pyroxene, compositions of pyroxene and plagioclase, assemblages of Ti-, Nb-, and Zr-bearing minerals, compositions of chrome spinel, bulk-rock Ti/Sm and Sc/Sm, and measured ages. The two groups probably crystallized from different types of parent magmas. Two hypotheses are offered for the differences in composition of the parent magmas. One hypothesis ascribes the differences to compositional heterogeneity of the mantle source areas. The other hypothesis ascribes the differences to variations in extent of partial melting of the mantle source regions and variations in extent of assimilation of the anorthosite and the highly differentiated residual liquid that were produced during the primordial lunar differentiation.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB088iS02p0A603
1980LPSC...11..481P|1980|The meteoritic contamination of terrestrial and lunar impact melts and the problem of indigenous siderophiles in the lunar highland.|Palme, H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||481|It is noted that similarities in chemistry and texture between terrestrial and lunar impact melts can be extended to meteoritic elements. The absolute amount of the meteoritic contamination, as well as the observed variations in concentrations of meteoritic elements in the Apollo 17 melt sheet, is comparable to what is observed in some large terrestrial melt sheets. In favorable cases, concentrations of siderophile meteoritic elements in the basement (indigenous component) can be found on the basis of correlations of two meteoritic elements in impact melt samples. Indigenous Ni and Co concentrations found in this way for the Apollo 17 melt are, respectively, 40 + or - 15 ppm Ni and 21.6 + or - 3.5 ppm Co. It is noted that these values are consistent with a chondritic Ni/Co ratio of the projectile.|

D., Ryder, G.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||531|The petrology and geochemistry of pristine lunar highlands rock samples consisting of ferroan anorthosites, norites, troctolites, spinel troctolites/dunite/lherzolite, and KREEP, are described. In addition, petrographic and chemical evidence is presented which shows that low-siderophile rocks are the result of endogenous igneous activity and not impact melt differentiation. For example, these rocks contain Fe-metal as a late-crystallizing phase, and have W/La ratios higher than polymict breccias.|

J.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||713|A study of two clasts of coarse-grained anorthositic-noritic-troctolitic-suite norites from the fragment-laden melt rock 73255 is presented. Both clasts are igneous rocks crystallized from melts that were probably internally generated; clast 27,80 is a cumulate, and the parent magmas of both rocks probably crystallized below the lunar surface. Despite similar history, the parent rocks of the two clasts appear to be derived from distinct magma types: the 27,80 is characterized by plagioclase and orthopyroxene as the major constituents and by a high K, Nb, and Zr content, while the 27,45 type also contains augite and has a low content of K, Nb, and Zr.|
