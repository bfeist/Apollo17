2002E&PSL.202..217N|2002|Targeting the impactors: siderophile element signatures of lunar impact melts from Serenitatis|Norman, Marc D., Bennett, Vickie C., Ryder, Graham|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|202|2|217|Highly siderophile element compositions of lunar impact melt breccias provide a unique record of the asteroid population responsible for large cratering events in the inner Solar System. Melt breccias associated with the 3.89 Ga Serenitatis impact basin resolve at least two separate impact events. KREEP-rich melt breccias representing the Apollo 17 poikilitic suite are enriched in highly siderophile elements (3.6-15.8 ppb Ir) with CI-normalized patterns that are elevated in Re, Ru and Pd relative to Ir and Pt. The restricted range of lithophile element compositions combined with the coherent siderophile element signatures indicate formation of these breccias in a single impact event involving an EH chondrite asteroid, probably as melt sheet deposits from the Serenitatis Basin. One exceptional sample, a split from melt breccia 77035, has a distinctive lithophile element composition and a siderophile element signature more like that of ordinary chondrites, indicating a discrete impact event. The recognition of multiple impact events, and the clear signatures of specific types of meteoritic impactors in the Apollo 17 melt breccias, shows that the lunar crust was not comprehensively reworked by prior impacts from 3.9 to 4.5 Ga, an observation more consistent with a late cataclysm than a smoothly declining accretionary flux. Late accretion of enstatite chondrites during a 3.8-4.0 Ga cataclysm may have contributed to siderophile element heterogeneity on the Earth, but would not have made a significant contribution to the volatile budget of the Earth or oxidation of the terrestrial mantle. Siderophile element patterns of Apollo 17 poikilitic breccias become more fractionated with decreasing concentrations, trending away from known meteorite compositions to higher Re/Ir and Pd/Pt ratios. The compositions of these breccias may be explained by a two-stage impact melting process involving: (1) deep penetration of the Serenitatis impactor into meteorite-free lower crust, followed by (2) incorporation of upper crustal lithologies moderately contaminated by prior meteoritic infall into the melt sheet. Trends to higher Re/Ir with decreasing siderophile element concentrations may indicate an endogenous lunar crustal component, or a non-chondritic late accretionary veneer in the pre-Serenitatis upper crust.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0012-821X(02)00780-X
2001AGUFM.V21D..04B|2001|Targeting the (3.8-4.0 Ga) Impactors: Siderophile Element Signatures of Lunar Impact Melts|Bennett, V., Norman, M., Ryder, G.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2001||V21D-04|Significant gaps remain in our understanding of the early impact history of the Earth and Moon, and their influence on geologic and biologic development. Outstanding controversies include whether or not the Moon, and by inference the early Earth, was hit by an unusually heavy "terminal cataclysm" of collisions during the period 3.8 to 4.0 Ga, and the number of large impact events represented by lunar samples. Coincidentally or not, the large nearside lunar basins are almost identical in age with the oldest terrestrial rocks, and are therefore relevant for consideration of the possible role of impacts in shaping the terrestrial continents and early life environments. To improve our understanding of the impact history of the Moon and to provide new information about the types of planetesimals that were involved in the early impact history of the inner Solar System, we measured the concentrations of highly siderophile elements (HSE: Re, Ir, Pt, Pd, Ru) in a suite of Apollo 17 impact melt breccias using high precision ID-ICPMS methods. These breccias all have poikilitic textures, relatively mafic bulk compositions, and high levels of incompatible trace elements and all likely represent ejecta from the Serenitatis basin. Ar-Ar ages are consistent with the formation of these breccias in a single impact event at 3893 +/- 9 Ma. HSE from 11 representative samples have W-shaped patterns on CI-normalized diagrams, with enrichments in Re, Ru and Pd relative to Ir and Pt, and absolute abundances ranging from \sim0.5 to 4% of CI reference values. Stronger depletions of Ir and Pt relative to Re, Ru, and Pd are correlated with decreasing HSE concentrations. The samples with the highest HSE concentrations have patterns that are identical to those of EH chondrites, but the patterns become increasingly less diagnostic of meteorite group with decreasing concentrations. The systematic variation of HSE patterns with decreasing concentration suggests that simple chemical fingerprints of impactor type using individual samples can potentially give misleading results and consideration of impact-related fractionation using high precision data for suites of impact breccias is required. An additional sample (77035) has a distinctly different HSE pattern and is more consistent with an impactor of ordinary or EL-type chondrite composition. It likely represents a discrete impact event that was sampled at the Apollo 17 site. The clear recognition of specific and different types of meteoritic impactors indicates a diverse population of planetesimals bombarded the Moon, and that the lunar crust was not heavily contaminated with HSE prior to 3.8-4.0 Ga, a feature more consistent with a late cataclysm than a smoothly declining accretionary flux.|

K.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|88||603|Mg-suite noritic rocks can be divided into two groups, the Mg-gabbronorites and the Mg-norites. The rocks of these groups differ in ratios of high-Ca pyroxene to total pyroxene, compositions of pyroxene and plagioclase, assemblages of Ti-, Nb-, and Zr-bearing minerals, compositions of chrome spinel, bulk-rock Ti/Sm and Sc/Sm, and measured ages. The two groups probably crystallized from different types of parent magmas. Two hypotheses are offered for the differences in composition of the parent magmas. One hypothesis ascribes the differences to compositional heterogeneity of the mantle source areas. The other hypothesis ascribes the differences to variations in extent of partial melting of the mantle source regions and variations in extent of assimilation of the anorthosite and the highly differentiated residual liquid that were produced during the primordial lunar differentiation.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB088iS02p0A603
1980LPSC...11..365J|1980|Rocks of the early lunar crust.|James, O. B.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||365|Data are summarized which suggest a model for the early evolution of the lunar crust. According to the model, during the final stages of accretion, the outer part of the moon melted to form a magma ocean approximately 300 km deep. This ocean fractionated to form mafic and ultramafic cumulates at depth and an overlying anorthositic crust made up of ferroan anorthosites. Subsequent partial melting in the primitive mantle underlying the crystallized magma ocean produced melts which segregated, moved upward, intruded the primordial crust, and crystallized to form layered plutons consisting of Mg-rich plutonic rocks. Intense impact bombardment at the lunar surface mixed and melted the rocks of the two suites to form a thick layer of granulated debris, granulitic breccias, and impact-melt rocks.|
1980LPSC...11..481P|1980|The meteoritic contamination of terrestrial and lunar impact melts and the problem of indigenous siderophiles in the lunar highland.|Palme, H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||481|It is noted that similarities in chemistry and texture between terrestrial and lunar impact melts can be extended to meteoritic elements. The absolute amount of the meteoritic contamination, as well as the observed variations in concentrations of meteoritic elements in the Apollo 17 melt sheet, is comparable to what is observed in some large terrestrial melt sheets. In favorable cases, concentrations of siderophile meteoritic elements in the basement (indigenous component) can be found on the basis of correlations of two meteoritic elements in impact melt samples. Indigenous Ni and Co concentrations found in this way for the Apollo 17 melt are, respectively, 40 + or - 15 ppm Ni and 21.6 + or - 3.5 ppm Co. It is noted that these values are consistent with a chondritic Ni/Co ratio of the projectile.|

In addition, petrographic and chemical evidence is presented which shows that low-siderophile rocks are the result of endogenous igneous activity and not impact melt differentiation. For example, these rocks contain Fe-metal as a late-crystallizing phase, and have W/La ratios higher than polymict breccias.|
