D.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference|||477|The authors were loaned four samples of lunar core 79002/1 for the purpose of measuring Al-26 in the core samples in order to study surface anomalies such as the effects of gardening and/or possible accretion of particles from the solar wind or other sources. The anomalies were to be detected and assessed by comparing the measured values of Al-26 concentration with cosmic-ray production predictions from the Reedy-Arnold (1972) model. The samples from 79002/1 were measured for Al-26 using a multidimensional gamma-ray spectrometer built by one of the authors. The results of the Al-26 measurements are shown in a table and are compared with analyses previously done on 79002/1 by Nishiizumi (1994).|

N.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|19||285|Variations in abundance and isotopic composition of nitrogen in 79002/79001 drive tube samples result from mixing of two soil components: one mature, N-rich, and isotopically light, resembling breccia material in the core, and the other immature, N-poor, and isotopically heavy. That these materials are common to soil at each stratigraphic level in the core suggests widespread distribution in the local regolith. Preservation of mixing correlations involving nitrogen isotopic compositions and cosmogenic N-15 concentrations suggests relatively recent mixing, perhaps in association with emplacement of the core stratigraphy. Characteristics of nitrogen release from the endmember materials, relationships between their nitrogen contents and maturity, and contrasts in their cosmogenic N-15 contents are consistent with models involving secular increase of the N-15/N-14 ratio of the solar wind.|
