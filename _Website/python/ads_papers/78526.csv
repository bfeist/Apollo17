R.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference|27||1415|Since the discovery of very low-Ti (VLT) basalts as tiny clasts and glasses in Apollo 17 drill cores, VLT basalts have been recognized as an important lunar rock type. Lunar sample 78526 (8.77 g), our largest specimen of VLT basaltic composition, is an impact melt composed of vitrophyric green glass with minor lithic and mineral inclusions. Major and trace element abundances of bulk 78526 are intermediate between those of Apollo 17 VLT basalt fragments, but the lithic clasts are less well-defined because no trace element data are available. This work utilizes a micro-coring technique to extract microgram-sized samples from a thin-section of 78526, and micro-INAA techniques to obtain trace element abundances. The results show that the two major clasts are distinct from bulk 78526, but are similar to several VLT basalt clasts found in a highland breccia, 72235.|

Electron microprobe analyses of glasses from the double drive tube 79001/2 (90-150 Î¼m size fraction of soils from mean depths of 0.8-16.8 cm) indicate that 34 of 90 (38%) are of VLT composition. A subset of twenty glasses was removed from the thin sections using a micro-coring device and analyzed using special micro-INAA techniques to obtain major and trace element abundances. On the basis of the results, we delineate three distinct groups which have been named for their relative amounts of Co: HICo, MECo, and LOCo Apollo 17 VLTs. The most magnesian HICo basalt glasses (4 of 34, or about 12% of the VLT glasses) are probably pristine pyroclastics. Soil breccias 79135 and 70295 apparently contain only this type of VLT glass. The medium-Co MECo glasses (6 of 34, 18%) strongly resemble the largest sample of VLT composition, the olivine vitrophyre 78526, as well as all three of the Apollo 17 VLT lithic fragments that have been analyzed for trace elements. The LOCo VLT glasses (23 of 34, 68%) are more enigmatic. Trace element concentrations require that these three VLT compositions cannot be related by simple igneous processes. The distribution of the three types provides important information on the sequence of events that produced the regolith at the Apollo 17 site.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(94)90388-3

W., Jr.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||59|A number of trace element interrelationships support the concept of a laterally inhomogeneous moon based originally on Clr/P2O5 ratios. The correspondence between Clr/P2O3 and Rb/Sr ratios in basalts are of special interest since the isotropic evolution of the latter pair of elements relates to the earliest history of the moon. This implies the times when the Clr/P2O5 relationships were established. The early magma ocean is conjectured to have been made up of non-intermixing seas resulting either from large convection cells or large body accretion. These mutually exclusive regions could be lunar geological provinces. It is proposed that the diversity of basalts from the Apollo 17 site is related to the lateral inhomogeneity of the moon. Ca/Na ratios in basalts show a trend which parallels that of Ru/Os and in a corresponding fashion may serve as a depth indicator.|

D., Keil, K.|Mare Crisium: The view from Luna 24|||357|Available major-element compositions of very low-Ti (VLT) mare basalt lithic fragments and glasses are examined. Many of the lithic fragments contain relic mineral and sometimes lithic clasts, which suggests that many samples of VLT mare basalt glasses and lithic fragments were formed by impact melting. Therefore, some may have compositions that represent mixtures of VLT mare basalts and other types of rocks, not authentic igneous rock compositions. In spite of this problem, a number of possible parent magma compositions are identified. These hypothetical magmas vary in CaO/Al2O3(0.9-1.1), FeO (17 to 24 wt. %), Fe/(Fe + Mg) (0.34-0.46), and K2O (0-0.2 wt. %). Each may have differentiated to produce a wide variety of derivative magmas. Calculations involving olivine fractionation from the proposed parent magmas indicate the Luna 24 ferrobasalts might have formed from a magma whose composition is similar to that of a group of high-MgO (about 13-14 wt. %) Apollo 17 VLT mare basalt glasses.|

Apollo 17 rake sample 78526 is a green glassy rock of similar composition. Together the samples represent a distinct variety of mare basalts. Bulk compositional relationships suggest that they are related to Apollo 15 green glass, but the data do not permit us to discern the precise nature of the relationship. Both fractional crystallization and partial melting models can explain the observed compositional trends.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/GL004i006p00207
