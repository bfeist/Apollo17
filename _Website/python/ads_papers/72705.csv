1979LPSC...10..531N|1979|A summary of the petrology and geochemistry of pristine highlands rocks.|Norman, M. D., Ryder, G.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||531|The petrology and geochemistry of pristine lunar highlands rock samples consisting of ferroan anorthosites, norites, troctolites, spinel troctolites/dunite/lherzolite, and KREEP, are described. In addition, petrographic and chemical evidence is presented which shows that low-siderophile rocks are the result of endogenous igneous activity and not impact melt differentiation. For example, these rocks contain Fe-metal as a late-crystallizing phase, and have W/La ratios higher than polymict breccias.|
