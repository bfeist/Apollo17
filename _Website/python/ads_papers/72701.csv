V.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2287|Surface exposure (or, equivalently, maturity) indices of lunar soils are a measure of residence time of soil in the upper one millimeter of the regolith. Several concepts concerning the use of and terminology associated with maturity indices are discussed. For reasons which include its generally-applicable nature and large data base, the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) surface exposure (maturity) index I<SUB>s/FeO</SUB> (the ratio of the value of the intensity in arbitrary units of the FMR resonance at g equal to about 2.1 to the FeO concentration) is particularly suitable and useful. A compilation of values of I<SUB>s/FeO</SUB> for 164 Apollo surface and trench soils and six Luna 24 core soils is given.|

D.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1491|U-Th-Pb analyses of bulk samples of soil breccia 70019, when compared to KREEP data, indicate that different lunar samples are sometimes characterized by distinctly different initial Pb isotopic compositions. U-Th-Pb analyses on nonglassy samples and a glassy separate of soil breccia 70019, and bulk and agglutinate samples of soil 72701 showed that the glassy samples did lose considerable Pb relative to U less than 200 million years ago. These data support the contention of other investigators that vaporization of volatile elements owing to impact events significantly alters the chemistry of the lunar regolith. Metaclastic rock 60315 was reanalyzed and was found to be concordant at 3.93 billion years rather than slightly discordant, as was previously reported.|
