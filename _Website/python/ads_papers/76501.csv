2006GeCoA..70.6103M|2006|Isotopic composition of zinc, copper, and iron in lunar samples|Moynier, F., Albarède, F., Herzog, G. F.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|70|24|6103|We determined by ICP-MS the concentrations and isotopic ratios of Fe, Cu, and Zn in the Ti-rich lunar basalt 74275, in the lunar orange glass 74220, and in up to 10 lunar soils, namely, 14163, 15231, 64501, 66041, 68841, 69941, 70011, 72501, 75081, and 76501. Two analyses of zinc in lunar basalt 74275 give δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn = 0.17‰ and 0.75‰, values within the range of those measured in terrestrial basalts; copper in lunar basalt 74275 has δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu ̃ +1.4‰, which is isotopically heavier than values observed in terrestrial basalts. In the orange glass, we measured δ <SUP>56</SUP>Fe = -0.24‰, δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu = -0.42‰, and δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn ̃ -3.6‰. These values of δ are more negative than those obtained for 74275 and for typical lunar basalts, but for Cu, comparable to those observed in terrestrial sulfides and meteorites. In lunar soils we found 0.11‰ ⩽ δ <SUP>56</SUP>Fe ⩽ 0.51‰, 2.6‰ ⩽ δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu ⩽ 4.5‰, and 2.2‰ ⩽ δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn ⩽ 6.4‰. Insofar as we can generalize from a small sample set, S, Fe, Cu, Zn, and Cd show similar trends in isotopic fractionation on the Moon. Lunar basalts have nearly terrestrial isotopic ratios. Relative to the lunar basalt 74275, the pyroclastic glass 74220 is enriched in the lighter isotopes of Fe, Cu, and Zn, and the soils are enriched in the heavier isotopes of Fe, Cu, and Zn. The patterns in the basalts are likely inherited from the source material; the light-isotope enrichments seen in the orange glass originated during lava fountaining or, less probably, during partial condensation of vapor; and the heavy-isotope enrichments in the lunar soils were likely created by a combination of processes that included micrometeorite vaporization and sputtering. In the orange glass, the light-isotope enrichments (relative to lunar basalts) of Zn are larger than those of Cu. If these enrichments reflect accurately the isotopic composition of the gas, they suggest that Cu is more volatile than Zn in the liquid from which the gas derived. A simple model built on the known flux of micrometeorites to the lunar surface and a published estimate that micrometeorites generate 10 times their own mass of vapor, predicts heavy-isotope enrichments comparable to those observed in soils but only if the regolith gardening rate is set at about one twentieth of the generally accepted value of 1 cm/My. This discrepancy may reflect the difference in the time constants for micrometeorite milling and decimeter-scale gardening, or the importance of sputtering.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2006.02.030

C.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|12||371|A progress report is presented concerning an investigation involving a comprehensive chemical and petrologic study of surface soils from all nine lunar sampling sites. The soils selected for this study are part of the lunar highlands soils suite and represent the soils at each site that contain abundant highland-derived material. The current report takes into consideration, in addition to the eight soils discussed by Labotka et al. (1980) and by Laul and Papike (1980), three Apollo 17 soils (72501, 76501, and 78221), and three Luna soils (21000, L-16; 22001, L-20; and 24999, L-24). Attention is given to the modal petrology of the 1000-90 micrometer fraction of all 14 soils, and the modes and mineral and glass chemistries of the 90-20 and 20-10 micrometer fractions of the Apollo 17 and Luna soils. In an evaluation of the obtained results, it is found that except for rare, large-scale impacts, lateral mixing is an inefficient process. Comminution and vertical mixing appear to be the dominant process.|

R.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1389|Isotopic lead data from bulk samples of Apollo 17 soils were analyzed, and they define a chord in a concordia diagram, showing the presence of a component or components containing excess radiogenic lead with Pb-207/Pb-206 equal to about 1.32. The chord is distinctly different from the cataclysm chord, for which Pb-207/Pb-206 is approximately 1.45. Nitric acid analysis of plagioclase indicates lead ages of around 4.35 AE, in agreement with previous findings. Agglutinates from soil 76501,34 show loss of approximately 15% of lead.|
