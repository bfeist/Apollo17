W.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||689|Sm-Nd whole rock measurements on a variety of KREEP-rich samples from different landing sites are reported. Despite a variation of Nd and Sm concentrations of almost a factor of 3, the Sm-Nd ratios, as well as the Nd-143/Nd-144 values, show an extremely close grouping. No systematic differences between samples from different landing sites are resolved. These results are taken to be indicative of a moon-wide process having been responsible for the generation of the KREEP source reservoir, 4.36 plus or minus 0.06 AE ago, as estimated from model age calculation.|

The crater populations observed have identical characteristics to those obtained from previous missions. Special emphasis was placed on assessing the influence of target properties on the observable crater populations. Although these properties cannot be quantitatively evaluated at present, the empirical results indicate that crater populations on glass, breccia, and crystalline rock surfaces may differ fundamentally. As a consequence, lunar surface exposure ages of individual rocks based on micrometeoroid craters may be subject to criticism.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0019-1035(74)90079-7
