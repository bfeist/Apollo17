2009GeCoA..73..514E|2009|A combined Sm Nd, Rb Sr, and U Pb isotopic study of Mg-suite norite 78238: Further evidence for early differentiation of the Moon|Edmunson, J., Borg, L. E., Nyquist, L. E., Asmerom, Y.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|73|2|514|Lunar Mg-suite norite 78238 was dated using the Sm-Nd, Rb-Sr, and U-Pb isotopic systems in order to constrain the age of lunar magma ocean solidification and the beginning of Mg-suite magmatism, as well as to provide a direct comparison between the three isotopic systems. The Sm-Nd isotopic system yields a crystallization age for 78238 of 4334 ± 37 Ma and an initial ∊Nd143 value of -0.27 ± 0.74. The age-initial ∊Nd143 (T-I) systematics of a variety of KREEP-rich samples, including 78238 and other Mg-suite rocks, KREEP basalts, and olivine cumulate NWA 773, suggest that lunar differentiation was completed by 4492 ± 61 Ma assuming a Chondritic Uniform Reservoir bulk composition for the Moon. The Rb-Sr isotopic systematics of 78238 were disturbed by post-crystallization processes. Nevertheless, selected data points yield two Rb-Sr isochrons. One is concordant with the Sm-Nd crystallization age, 4366 ± 53 Ma. The other is 4003 ± 95 Ma and is concordant with an Ar-Ar age for 78236. The <SUP>207</SUP>Pb- <SUP>206</SUP>Pb age of 4333 ± 59 Ma is concordant with the Sm-Nd age. The U-Pb isotopic systematics of 78238 yield linear arrays equivalent to younger ages than the Pb-Pb system, and may reflect fractionation of U and Pb during sample handling. Despite the disturbed nature of the U-Pb systems, a time-averaged μ ( <SUP>238</SUP>U/ <SUP>204</SUP>Pb) value of the source can be estimated at 27 ± 30 from the Pb-Pb isotopic systematics. Because KREEP-rich samples are likely to be derived from source regions with the highest U/Pb ratios, the relatively low μ value calculated for the 78238 source suggests the bulk Moon does not have an exceedingly high μ value.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2008.10.021
2007E&PSL.262..505B|2007|A highly depleted moon or a non-magma ocean origin for the lunar crust?|Boyet, Maud, Carlson, Richard W.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|262|3-4|505|Coupled <SUP>146,147</SUP>Sm- <SUP>142,143</SUP>Nd systematics were analyzed on lunar samples that span the range of source compositions created in the early lunar differentiation event (ferroan anorthosites, high-Mg suite norite, KREEP and low-and high-Ti basalts). If fit with a single isochron, the data agree with previous suggestions of a ̃ 250 Ma duration for closure of the Sm-Nd system in the lunar interior. The two crustal rocks, 60025 and 78236, among oldest samples found on the lunar surface, have high initial <SUP>142</SUP>Nd/ <SUP>144</SUP>Nd ratios ( ∊<SUP>142</SUP>Nd = 0.24-0.27 relative to O-chondrites), which indicates that they derive from a source strongly depleted in light rare earth elements (LREE) ( <SUP>147</SUP>Sm/ <SUP>144</SUP>Nd ̃ 0.23). This result suggests either that the Moon formed with a strongly superchondritic Sm/Nd ratio or that the lunar crust formed as a product of a post-magma ocean remelting of LREE depleted cumulates in the lunar interior. The basalt data measured here add support to the idea that the lunar interior evolved with a superchondritic Sm/Nd, similar to that of the early Earth. Addition of differentiation steps adds complexity, and inherit non-uniqueness, to the interpretation of the lunar Nd isotope data, but our preferred model has the first stage of lunar evolution (4.567 to 4.44 Ga) occurring on an already differentiated Earth, with the Moon forming shortly before 4.45 Ga and undergoing rapid magma ocean evolution to form the crust, the high Sm/Nd source reservoirs of many mare basalt types, and KREEP by 4.44 Ga. Continued differentiation of the lunar interior through the increasing depletion of the source of high-Ti mare basalts then continued until ̃ 4320 Ma.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2007.08.009
1993GeCoA..57..915S|1993|Ages of pristine noritic clasts from lunar breccias 15445 and 15455|Shih, C. -Y., Nyquist, L. E., Dasch, E. J., Bogard, D. D., Bansal, B. M., Wiesmann, H.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|57|4|915|Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isotopic studies were undertaken of two Apollo 15 breccias, 15445 and 15455, collected near Spur Crater on the Apennine Front. Seven pristine lithic clasts including four norites, one anorthositic norite, one troctolitic anorthosite and one spinel troctolite, as well as a matrix sample of 15445, were analysed. In addition, a K-Ar age determination was also made for a plagioclase separate from a different anorthositic norite clast. Sm-Nd isotopic data of a pristine Mg-norite sample, 15445,17, from the large white Clast B of breccia 15445 yielded a precise internal isochron age of 4.46 ± 0.07 Ga for λ( <SUP>147</SUP>Sm) = 0.00654 Ga<SUP>-1</SUP> and an initial <SUP>143</SUP>Nd /<SUP>144</SUP>Nd of 0.506058 ∓ 0.000078 (normalized to <SUP>148</SUP>Nd /<SUP>144</SUP>Nd = 0.24308) corresponding to an initial ∊<SUB>Nd</SUB> of +0.71. However, Sm-Nd isotopic results of another Mg-norite sample, 15445,247, chipped from the same Clast B, about 1 cm away from 15445,17, yielded a significantly younger isochron age of 4.28 ± 0.03 Ga and a higher initial <SUP>143</SUP>Nd /<SUP>144</SUP>Nd of 0.506246 ∓ 0.000037 corresponding to an initial ∊<SUB>Nd</SUB> of -0.35. The Sm-Nd data indicate that Clast B is heterogeneous and contains at least two similar lithologies. The Rb-Sr isotopic systems were severely disturbed for both norites. No useful isochron ages were observed. The Sm-Nd age and ∊<SUB>Nd</SUB> data for A-15 Mg-norites 15445,17 and 15445,247, A-17 Mgnorite 78236, and two Mg-gabbronorites 73255,27,45 and 67667 are clearly resolved from each other. Four distinct parental magmas are required for derivation of these two major groups of Mg-suite noritic rocks. The Rb-Sr isotopic system of an anorthositic norite clast, 15455,228, was slightly disturbed; and isotopic data defined an isochron age of 4.59 ± 0.13 Ga for λ( <SUP>87</SUP>Rb) = 0.0139 Ga<SUP>-1</SUP> or 4.55 ± 0.13 Ga for λ( <SUP>87</SUP>Rb) = 0.01402 Ga<SUP>-1</SUP>. The corresponding initial <SUP>87</SUP>Sr /<SUP>86</SUP>Sr for the rock is 0.69899 ∓ 0.00006 and is in satisfactory agreement with the LUNI value of NYQUIST et al. (1974). The Sm-Nd system is more disturbed than the Rb-Sr system for this rock. A tie-line between whole-rock samples and a pyroxene separate gives a Sm-Nd age of 4.53 ± 0.29 Ga, which is in nominal agreement with the Rb-Sr isochron age. The <SUP>39</SUP>Ar <SUP>40</SUP>Ar age of a plagioclase separate of the rock has a weighted average value of ~ 3.83 Ga, suggesting that the age was reset by the Imbrium impact event. Probably, the Sm-Nd and Rb-Sr systems of the clast were also partly reset by this event. Our age results indicate that some Mg-suite rocks are as old as ferroan-anorthosite-suite rocks. Furthermore, age data of three major crustal rocks (a Mg suite, a ferroan-anorthosite suite, and an evolved suite) show that they all have variable ages. These observations are difficult to explain by the "magma ocean" hypothesis alone. Petrogenetic processes such as production of Mg-suite rocks by "serial magmatism" ( WALKER, 1983), of ferroan-anorthosite-suite rocks by "multiple diapiric intrusions" ( LONGHI and ASHWAL, 1985), and evolved-suite rocks by "continuous magmatism" ( MEYER et al., 1988, 1989) probably all played a role. These processes seem to be able to accommodate the wide ranges of ages and different origins observed for lunar crustal rocks.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(93)90178-Y

Their exsolution and deformation textures were studied by analytical transmission electron microscope (ATEM) in addition to single crystal X ray diffraction and electron microprobe techniques. 72255 pyroxenes contain clinobronzite lamellae similar to those in Johnstown, which were interpreted to have formed by stress-induced transformation by shock events. The X ray and TEM observation of the orthopyroxene (En<SUB>76</SUB>Fs<SUB>21</SUB>Wo<SUB>3</SUB>) in 78236 shows no augite exsolution with (100) in common. Abundant GuinierPreston zones, with several unit-cells wide, are present. The textures in conjunction with the thermal history proposed by chronologic data suggest that 78236 experienced slow cooling deep in the crust above 1000°C, cooled rapidly due to excavation by an impact event, and then cooled slowly again at moderate temperature. This history is similar to that proposed for Johnstown. Computer simulation on the development of the (100) augite lamellae in 72255 and Ibbenbüren suggests a deep origin in the crust.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB087iS01p0A124
1982LPSC...12...67N|1982|A comparative Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, and K-Ar study of shocked norite 78236: evidence of slow cooling in the lunar crust?|Nyquist, L. E., Reimold, W. U., Bogard, D. D., Wooden, J. L., Bansal, B. M., Wiesmann, H., Shih, C. -Y.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|12||67|The sample 78236 was chipped from the top of a norite boulder at Station 8 by the Apollo 17 landing team. Jackson et al. (1975) concluded that this rock formed at a depth of 8-30 km in the lunar crust and suggested that it was excavated by a large basin-forming impact event. A petrographic description of the boulder is provided, and isotopic analyses are discussed. Attention is given to a chronology for 78236 which seems to be most consistent with radiometric and other evidence. It is proposed that cumulate norite 78236 formed deep in the lunar crust approximately 4.4 AE ago. The rock cooled slowly in the crust until it was excavated by a major basin-forming event. Excavation may have occurred about 4.2 AE ago, but the time of this event is not well constrained.|
1981E&PSL..52..227C|1981|Time and duration of lunar highlands crust formation|Carlson, R. W., Lugmair, G. W.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|52|2|227|All radiometric systems indicate that crust-mantle differentiation on the moon is dominated by events which occurred very early in lunar history. However, due to remaining uncertainties in model parameters and assumptions in the calculation of model ages, it is not yet possible to resolve the precise times of occurrence of these events nor the duration of the formation of the highlands crust. The strongest time constraints are offered by direct radiometric ages of samples formed during this earliest period. Two possible candidates for this material, norites 78236 and 73255,27,45, were examined utilizing the Sm-Nd radiometric system. Sm-Nd systematics of 78236 show post-crystallization disturbance but indicate that this norite crystallized in the lunar crust about 4.34 AE ago. Data for 73255,27,45 define an isochron and yield a crystallization age of 4.23 ± 0.05 AE. The initial Nd isotopic composition of both norites is within uncertainty of a "chondritic" reference reservoir at the time of their respective crystallizations. The implications for lunar crustal formation persisting over a time span of close to 350 m.y. are discussed.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(81)90177-1
