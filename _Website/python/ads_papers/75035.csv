F.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||2547|The paper deals with an extensive series of shock-recovery experiments performed on both nonporous crystalline basalt and its granulated and sieved counterpart to study the role of porosity and grain size in shock motomorphic effects under otherwise identical conditions. Shocked samples are compared with unshocked starting material in terms of textural and mineralogical modifications attributable to shock. A comparative petrographic and chemical characterization is presented of pulverized and sieved lunar basalt 75035 shocked between 6 and 75 GPa in comparison with holocrystalline disks of the same basalts shocked in 10 earlier experiments. Specifically, a petrographic classification of shock features is given, along with an estimation of relative amounts of shock glasses and a chemical characterization of shock glasses in each shocked granular basalt.|

B., Hoerz, F.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1697|Lonar Crater (India) basalt and lunar basalt 75035 were shock loaded under controlled laboratory conditions up to 1000 kbar, generally in a CO/CO2 (1:1) environment evacuated to 10 to the minus seventh power torr. The Kieffer et al. (1976) classification scheme of progressive shock metamorphism is found to apply to lunar basalts. The major shock features of the five classes that span the range 0 to 1000 kbar are described. Only three out of 152 basalt specimens show shock effects in their natural state as severe as Class 2 features. The scarcity of shocked basalt hand samples in contrast to the abundance of shock-produced agglutinates and homogeneous glass spheres in the lunar regolith indicates the dominant role of micrometeorite impact in the evolution of the lunar regolith. The overall glass content in asteroidal and Mercurian regoliths is considered.|
1977LPSC....8.1489S|1977|Laser <SUP>39</SUP>Ar-<SUP>40</SUP>Ar study of Apollo 17 basalts.|Schaeffer, O. A., Müller, H. W., Grove, T. L.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1489|Three Apollo 17 basalts were studied by the laser Ar-39-Ar-40 method. The 70215 basalt has a normal well-behaved Ar-39-Ar-40 release pattern; the 70017 basalt has a disturbed release pattern which indicates a limited intermediate maximum age followed by a broad low-age region; and the 75035 basalt has a pattern initially similar to 70017 that is followed by a high-temperature maximum age. The laser study shows that all mineral systems in 70215 have small and uniform temperature losses, while the laser-determined ages for 70017 and 75035 are, apparently, primarily controlled by the minerals containing mesostasis inclusions. It is possible that the drop in ages observed by the conventional Ar-39-Ar-40 method was due not only to recoil of Ar-39 during neutron irradiation but also to gas loss from some minerals. It is suggested that the plagioclases are the best minerals to use for a reliable age.|

H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1473|Uranium, thorium, and isotopic lead data for components of basalt 70017 are reported, and it is found that the whole rock, pyroxene, and ilmenite points in a concordia diagram plot along a chord intersecting the curve at 3.7 and 4.33 eons. The plagioclase data do not seem to lie on this line. The data for 70017 appear to plot along a distinctly different chord in a concordia diagram than do the data for 75055 and 75035, two other Apollo 17 mare basalts. The lead data are in accord with Sm-Nd results. A 3.7 eon crystallization age for 70017 would be consistent with the same kind of parentless lead that is indicated by previous studies of soils and soil breccias from stations at Taurus-Littrow. The Th/U ratio in ilmenite is 2.2, and the concentrations of these two elements are approximately twice those in pyroxene.|

For ion identification, the double-marking method has been applied to fossil cosmic-ray and Fe calibration tracks. The results obtained on the Patwar meteorite indicate that the 60-million-year average and the present-day cosmic-ray (Cr + Mn)/Fe abundance ratios are about equal. The lunar sample showed an enhanced abundance ratio, which probably is the result of the complex burial history of the rock. Beside the compositional data, information has been obtained on the degree of influence of annealing effects and on nuclear fragmentation parameters.|
1975LPSC....6.1509T|1975|The history of lunar bombardment inferred from <SUP>40</SUP>Ar-<SUP>39</SUP>Ar dating of highland rocks.|Turner, G., Cadogan, P. H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1509|Ar-40-Ar-39 age determinations for some Apollo 16 and 17 highland rocks are reported, and the chronology of lunar highland samples is discussed. While basalt 75035 is found to have an age of 3.77 b.y., the argon release patterns from two plagioclase separates of 75035 both show high-temperature increases in apparent age to 3.85 b.y., for unknown reasons. Two models of the chronology are examined. One model assumes that the ages are dominated by basin-forming events; the alternative model, in which the chronology is dominated by cratering events of subbasin size, may be used to determine cratering as a function of time close to 4.0 b.y. The association of the ages of the Apollo 17 massif rocks with the Serenitatis event restricts the basin chronology within very narrow limits, regardless of model.|

F., Schröpfer, L.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||773|X-ray diffraction patterns of 35 clinopyroxene grains chosen at random from the rocks 75035 and 75075 are more or less rotated up to 40 deg approximately about b-axes. This rotation characteristic is much more pronounced in grains from rock 75035 than in those from rock 75075. The diffraction patterns indicate the exsolution of pigeonite and augite. There is only one exception: a pigeonite-free twinned augite. Electron microscopy of one of these grains revealed small areas with bent (100) planes.|
1974LPSC....5..707M|1974|Opaque mineralogy: Apollo 17, rock 75035.|Meyer, H. O. A., Boctor, N. Z.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||707|Rock 75035 is a medium-grained, holocrystalline, subophitic ilmenite basalt collected from the rim of Camelot Crater, and is believed to represent the subfloor basalts of the Taurus-Littrow valley. The rock consists of the major minerals pyroxene (45%), plagioclase (31%), and ilmenite (17%). Minor minerals include cristobalite (about 5%), troilite, native Fe, tranquillityite, baddeleyite, zirconolite, and rare ulvospinel. No olivine or armalcolite was observed in the specimen 75035,76. Mineralogically and chemically, as well as in age, this rock is similar to others collected from Camelot and other stations during the Apollo 17 mission. These rocks are almost identical to the Type B ilmenite basalts of Mare Tranquillitatis.|
