D., Keil, K.|Mare Crisium: The view from Luna 24|||357|Available major-element compositions of very low-Ti (VLT) mare basalt lithic fragments and glasses are examined. Many of the lithic fragments contain relic mineral and sometimes lithic clasts, which suggests that many samples of VLT mare basalt glasses and lithic fragments were formed by impact melting. Therefore, some may have compositions that represent mixtures of VLT mare basalts and other types of rocks, not authentic igneous rock compositions. In spite of this problem, a number of possible parent magma compositions are identified. These hypothetical magmas vary in CaO/Al2O3(0.9-1.1), FeO (17 to 24 wt. %), Fe/(Fe + Mg) (0.34-0.46), and K2O (0-0.2 wt. %). Each may have differentiated to produce a wide variety of derivative magmas. Calculations involving olivine fractionation from the proposed parent magmas indicate the Luna 24 ferrobasalts might have formed from a magma whose composition is similar to that of a group of high-MgO (about 13-14 wt. %) Apollo 17 VLT mare basalt glasses.|
