M., Pillinger, C. T.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|88||B200|Using stepped heating extraction techniques, determinations of carbon and nitrogen content and delta C-13 and delta N-15 values have been obtained for selected lunar soils and breccias. Only nitrogen data have been gathered for representative splits separated by size, density and magnetic properties from 12023. A plot of the total delta C-13 (after terrestrial contamination is removed) versus delta N-15 values for bulk samples reveals little evidence for a correlation between isotopically light carbon and isotopically light nitrogen of putative ancient solar wind origin. Soil 12023 is used to examine the current interpretation for the stepped release profile of nitrogen from bulk lunar samples. Mature agglutinates, postulated by previous workers to be the host of the light nitrogen, are shown to have a very constant delta N-15 value which is heavy rather than light. The actual host of the light nitrogen in 12023 has not been identified. The lowest values encountered during the study were found associated with the finest soil, but none of these was as low as for some temperature steps of the bulk soil. Interpretations regarding the origin of light nitrogen, if it is not present in agglutinates, await the results of more definitive efforts to identify the host phase.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB088iS01p0B200

R.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1763|Time- and temperature-dependent techniques were used in He and H2 gas, in an investigation of the neutron-irradiated grain-size fractions of magnetically separated minerals and agglutinates from the Apollo 17 soil 75080. The time-dependent release of gamma-ray spectroscopy-determined volatile trace elements, at 1000 C shows that volatile species are enriched on both mineral and agglutinate surfaces. A highest-to-lowest volatility series was experimentally determined, which shows Hg, Cd, Zn, Se, In, Br, Ag. Laboratory experiments also show that moderate temperatures, greater than 250 C, lead to a volatilization of other elements than Hg, which evaporates at less than 130 C. This suggests that small traces of these elements may be volatile under lunar day-time conditions, and it is concluded that the vapor phase and agglutination processes are important in the distribution and redistribution of lunar volatiles.|

V., Nemoshkalenko, V. V., Aleshin, V. G.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1491|Elemental distribution in the small grain size fraction of particles of regolith samples 74220 and 75080 have been studied by X-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy. For both samples, a layered structure of the surface of particles was observed to be markedly different from those of the previously studied regolith samples collected by Luna automatic spacecraft. The particles of sample 74220 have a distinct two-layered structure, with a high content of S, Zn, Na, F and Cl in the outer layer, which apparently formed under conditions of high oxygen fugacity. An irregular distribution of reduced forms of element with depth, a high content of Ti and surface enrichments in Na are noted in sample 75080. Both features are characteristic of oxidation of the particle surfaces. They indicate that the surface layers of particles were formed by condensation processes: sample 75080 from an impact cloud and sample 74220 from a cloud of endogenic origin.|
