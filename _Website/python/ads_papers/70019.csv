2017Icar..298....2S|2017|Revisiting the field geology of Taurus-Littrow|Schmitt, H. H., Petro, N. E., Wells, R. A., Robinson, M. S., Weiss, B. P., Mercer, C. M.|Icarus|298||2|Integration of Apollo 17 field observations and photographs, sample investigations, Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera images, Chandrayaan-1 Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M<SUP>3</SUP>) spectra, and Miniature Radio Frequency (Mini-RF) S-band radar images provides new insights into the geology of the valley of Taurus-Littrow on the Moon. Connecting the various remote observations to sample data enables a set of new conclusions to be drawn regarding the geological evolution of the valley. Structural considerations and published and recalculated <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/<SUP>39</SUP>Ar analyses of samples from the North Massif and the Sculptured Hills indicate that the Crisium basin formed about 3.93 Ga; the Serenitatis basin about 3.82 Ga; and the Imbrium basin no earlier than 3.82 Ga and no later than the average of 3.72 Ga for 33 age dates from samples of the valley's mare basalts. Strong evidence continues to support the conclusion of others (Lucchitta, 1972; Spudis et al., 2011; Fassett et al., 2012) that the Sculptured Hills physiographic unit consists of Imbrium ejecta. Interpretation of M<SUP>3</SUP> spectral data and Apollo 17 samples indicate that rock units of the Sculptured Hills consist of a largely coherent, Mg-suite pluton. LROC NAC stereo images and Mini-RF data indicate the presence of several exposed pyroclastic fissures across the Sculptured Hills. Rim boulders at Camelot Crater constitute nearly in situ wall rocks of that crater rather than ejecta and provide an opportunity for investigations of remanent magnetic field orientation at the time of the eruption of late mare basalt lavas in the valley. Paleomagnetic field orientation information also may be obtained relative to melt-breccia contacts in North Massif boulders that suggest original horizontal orientations. LROC images indicate the existence of two temporally separate light mantle avalanche deposits. The origin, potential flow mechanisms, and geology of the youngest avalanche from the South Massif have been clarified. The existence of two distinct light mantle avalanches raises doubt about the association of either light mantle avalanche with secondary impacts related to the Tycho impact event. Alternatively, the Lee-Lincoln thrust fault appears to have triggered the second light mantle avalanche between 70 and 110 Ma. A simple structural analysis shows that this thrust fault dips 20-25Â° to the southwest where it crosses the North Massif and to the west where it crosses the valley floor. Mini-RF data reveal a line of reduced reflections roughly perpendicular to contours on the North Massif about 3 km to the east of the Lee-Lincoln fault. Although this line is possibly an older ancillary fault, LROC NAC stereo images indicate that it may be best explained as a pyroclastic fissure. A debris flow of dark, apparent pyroclastic ash lies below the southeast end of the potential fissure. Finally, young lunar impact glass sample 70019 has been precisely located within LROC NAC images and oriented for the first time using 60 mm (f.l.) sample documentation photographs. Sample 70019 can now be employed in lunar paleomagnetic field orientation studies.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2016.11.042
1979LPSC...10.2189S|1979|A new magnetic paleointensity value for a "young lunar glass".|Sugiura, N., Wu, Y. M., Strangway, D. W., Pearce, G. W., Taylor, L. A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||2189|A new technique of sample encapsulation was applied to Thellier-Thellier paleointensity determination. A test on a synthetic sample showed that some chemical change occurs during heating, but it is the most successful method we have used to date. A very young lunar glass sample 70019,49 gave a paleointensity of about 2500 nT by this new technique. It appears that the field was due either to local anomalies created by strongly magnetized rock or possibly to enhancement of local fields by the shock process which made the glass sample.|
1977LPSC....8..669P|1977|On the origin of sample 70019 and its suitability for lunar magnetic field intensity studies.|Pearce, G. W., Chou, C. -L.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||669|Sample 70019 is a glass-coated soil breccia recovered from the bottom of a 3 m crater on the floor of the Taurus-Littrow Valley. Trace-element and magnetic analysis show that the glass and breccia are both derived from the same local material, probably soil. The glass and breccia are sufficiently similar chemically and magnetically that it can be suggested that the glass formed in situ or that the glass and breccia arrived together to the crater where the sample was found from a common local source, perhaps a nearby primary crater. The glass apparently was not reduced chemically during its formation although such reduction often occurs in such lunar surface processes. Whereas the glass should give a measure of the magnetic field at the Apollo 17 landing site at the time of the formation of the glass, the breccia was probably not heated sufficiently to be similarly useful.|
1976LPSC....7.1113K|1976|The kinetics of lunar glass formation, revisited.|Klein, L. C., Uhlmann, D. R.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||1113|The nucleation frequency of Lunar Composition 70019, a lithified soil breccia from the center of a small crater in the Taurus-Littrow Valley, is determined using a relation that describes nucleation throughout the volume of a liquid together with measurements of the time required at temperatures of 780 to 930 C to obtain sensibly crystalline bodies. Curves indicating the time required at a given temperature to reach a particular fraction crystallized are shown to have the general form predicted by kinetic analysis. Nucleation frequencies are evaluated by applying such analysis to a curve representing the transition between glassy material and material with a sensible degree of crystallinity. The results obtained are found to be in excellent agreement with the values expected from the classical theory of homogeneous nucleation, indicating that such nucleation represents the dominant contribution to crystal formation, at least over the range of undercoolings covered (250 to 400 C).|
1975LPSC....6.1491N|1975|Pb loss from Apollo 17 glassy samples and Apollo 16 revisited.|Nunes, P. D.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1491|U-Th-Pb analyses of bulk samples of soil breccia 70019, when compared to KREEP data, indicate that different lunar samples are sometimes characterized by distinctly different initial Pb isotopic compositions. U-Th-Pb analyses on nonglassy samples and a glassy separate of soil breccia 70019, and bulk and agglutinate samples of soil 72701 showed that the glassy samples did lose considerable Pb relative to U less than 200 million years ago. These data support the contention of other investigators that vaporization of volatile elements owing to impact events significantly alters the chemistry of the lunar regolith. Metaclastic rock 60315 was reanalyzed and was found to be concordant at 3.93 billion years rather than slightly discordant, as was previously reported.|
1975LPSC....6..693U|1975|The formation of lunar breccias: sintering and crystallization kinetics.|Uhlmann, D. R., Klein, L., Onorato, P. I. K., Hopper, R. W.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||693|The process of clastic breccia formation by viscous sintering in a stress-free environment is analyzed by treating crystallization and sintering as concurrent, competing processes. The kinetic analysis of crystallization is based on the construction of continuous cooling curves corresponding to the degree of crystallinity observed in the matrix of the breccia. These curves are obtained from corresponding time-temperature-transformation curves, which in turn are constructed from measured values of the crystal growth rate together with calculated values of the nucleation frequency. The kinetic analysis of sintering is based on a modification of the Frenkel (1945) treatment of viscous sintering appropriate for conditions of continuous cooling. The analysis is applied to Lunar Composition 70019 to illustrate the approach. It is shown that it is possible from the kinetic analysis to estimate both the rate at which a given breccia cooled and the minimum temperature at which the matrix particles came in contact. The results obtained for Lunar Composition 70019 seem physically reasonable and suggest that this sample cooled on the surface of the moon in its present form rather than buried in an ejecta blanket from which it was later excavated.|
