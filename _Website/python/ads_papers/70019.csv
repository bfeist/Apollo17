The discovered breccia, being 52 × 16 cm, resembles the lunar impact melt breccia samples 15466 and 70019 that returned by the Apollo missions. It was formed by impact-generated welding, cementing and agglutinating of lunar regolith and breccia. Clods surrounds the breccia-hosting crater were crushed into regolith powders by the rover's wheels, indicating the regolith may be compacted slightly and becomes blocky and friable. Relative mineral fractions are estimated from the in situ measured spectra by a Hapke model-based unmixing algorithm. Unmixing reveals that plagioclase (PLG, 45 ± 6%) is dominant in the regolith, followed by almost equal fractions of pyroxene (PYX, 7 ± 1%) and olivine (OL, 6 ± 2%), indicating the regolith is likely related to noritic rocks. The regolith measured by Chang'e-4 rover was actually a highly mixture of multiple sources, with ejecta from Finsen crater being primary and possible contributions from Alder crater. Finsen and Alder craters are on the margin of the proposed impact melt pool produced by the SPA basin-forming event. Therefore, the ultimate source of the regolith might originate from a differentiated melt pool or from a suite of igneous rocks.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2020.116378

R., Mao, S.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2018||GP21C-0669|The Moon today does not have a global magnetic field. However, recent studies of samples collected during the Apollo missions and spacecraft measurements of the lunar crustal field suggest that an intense core dynamo was active during the period between 4.2 and 3.56 billion years ago (Ga) and may have lasted until at least 1-2.5 Ga in a weakened state. The time at which the dynamo finally ceased has not yet been established. One of the most intriguing and mysterious results of the Apollo era was the apparent discovery of stable natural remanent magnetization in the &lt;0.1 mm thick melt glass rind of the young (&lt;200 million-year-old) regolith breccia 70019. If the glass of 70019 is indeed magnetized, this would be the youngest paleomagnetic record from the Moon. Such a field could be that of a very recent core dynamo or perhaps have been generated by plasma from meteoroid impact. However, an alternative possibility is that the glass is not magnetized, such that Apollo-era studies were actually measuring ancient, entrained rock fragments magnetized billions of year ago. To assess this possibility we conducted a new paleomagnetic study of 70019 using two state-of-the-art instruments to measure rock thin sections and isolated pieces of 70019 while achieving fine spatial discrimination: a SQUID microscope (SM) and a quantum diamond microscope (QDM). Our preliminary results obtained from sample 70019,152 show that the glass indeed appears to be much less magnetized than the adjacent clastic material, with a paleointensity of 0.4 μT estimated from bulk magnetic moment measurements of isolated glassy material. This is corroborated by magnetic mapping of a thin section of 70019,152, which also reveals a non-unidirectional low-coercivity overprint predominantly on the edges of the sample, likely due to sample handling prior to thin section preparation.|

M.|Icarus|298||2|Integration of Apollo 17 field observations and photographs, sample investigations, Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera images, Chandrayaan-1 Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M<SUP>3</SUP>) spectra, and Miniature Radio Frequency (Mini-RF) S-band radar images provides new insights into the geology of the valley of Taurus-Littrow on the Moon. Connecting the various remote observations to sample data enables a set of new conclusions to be drawn regarding the geological evolution of the valley. Structural considerations and published and recalculated <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/<SUP>39</SUP>Ar analyses of samples from the North Massif and the Sculptured Hills indicate that the Crisium basin formed about 3.93 Ga; the Serenitatis basin about 3.82 Ga; and the Imbrium basin no earlier than 3.82 Ga and no later than the average of 3.72 Ga for 33 age dates from samples of the valley's mare basalts. Strong evidence continues to support the conclusion of others (Lucchitta, 1972; Spudis et al., 2011; Fassett et al., 2012) that the Sculptured Hills physiographic unit consists of Imbrium ejecta. Interpretation of M<SUP>3</SUP> spectral data and Apollo 17 samples indicate that rock units of the Sculptured Hills consist of a largely coherent, Mg-suite pluton. LROC NAC stereo images and Mini-RF data indicate the presence of several exposed pyroclastic fissures across the Sculptured Hills. Rim boulders at Camelot Crater constitute nearly in situ wall rocks of that crater rather than ejecta and provide an opportunity for investigations of remanent magnetic field orientation at the time of the eruption of late mare basalt lavas in the valley. Paleomagnetic field orientation information also may be obtained relative to melt-breccia contacts in North Massif boulders that suggest original horizontal orientations. LROC images indicate the existence of two temporally separate light mantle avalanche deposits. The origin, potential flow mechanisms, and geology of the youngest avalanche from the South Massif have been clarified. The existence of two distinct light mantle avalanches raises doubt about the association of either light mantle avalanche with secondary impacts related to the Tycho impact event. Alternatively, the Lee-Lincoln thrust fault appears to have triggered the second light mantle avalanche between 70 and 110 Ma. A simple structural analysis shows that this thrust fault dips 20-25° to the southwest where it crosses the North Massif and to the west where it crosses the valley floor. Mini-RF data reveal a line of reduced reflections roughly perpendicular to contours on the North Massif about 3 km to the east of the Lee-Lincoln fault. Although this line is possibly an older ancillary fault, LROC NAC stereo images indicate that it may be best explained as a pyroclastic fissure. A debris flow of dark, apparent pyroclastic ash lies below the southeast end of the potential fissure. Finally, young lunar impact glass sample 70019 has been precisely located within LROC NAC images and oriented for the first time using 60 mm (f.l.) sample documentation photographs. Sample 70019 can now be employed in lunar paleomagnetic field orientation studies.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2016.11.042

M., Pillinger, C. T.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|88||B200|Using stepped heating extraction techniques, determinations of carbon and nitrogen content and delta C-13 and delta N-15 values have been obtained for selected lunar soils and breccias. Only nitrogen data have been gathered for representative splits separated by size, density and magnetic properties from 12023. A plot of the total delta C-13 (after terrestrial contamination is removed) versus delta N-15 values for bulk samples reveals little evidence for a correlation between isotopically light carbon and isotopically light nitrogen of putative ancient solar wind origin. Soil 12023 is used to examine the current interpretation for the stepped release profile of nitrogen from bulk lunar samples. Mature agglutinates, postulated by previous workers to be the host of the light nitrogen, are shown to have a very constant delta N-15 value which is heavy rather than light. The actual host of the light nitrogen in 12023 has not been identified. The lowest values encountered during the study were found associated with the finest soil, but none of these was as low as for some temperature steps of the bulk soil. Interpretations regarding the origin of light nitrogen, if it is not present in agglutinates, await the results of more definitive efforts to identify the host phase.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB088iS01p0B200
1981EOSTr..62..161H|1981|The Enigma of Lunar Magnetism|Hood, L. L.|EOS Transactions|62||161|Current understandings of the nature and probable origin of lunar magnetism are surveyed. Results of examinations of returned lunar samples are discussed which reveal the main carrier of the observed natural remanent magnetization to be iron, occasionally alloyed with nickel and cobalt, but do not distinguish between thermoremanent and shock remanent origins, and surface magnetometer data is presented, which indicates small-scale magnetic fields with a wide range of field intensities implying localized, near-surface sources. A detailed examination is presented of orbital magnetometer and charged particle data concerning the geologic nature and origin of magnetic anomaly sources and the directional properties of the magnetization, which exhibit a random distribution except for a depletion in the north-south direction. A lunar magnetization survey with global coverage provided by a polar orbiting satellite is suggested as a means of placing stronger constraints on the origin of lunar crustal magnetization.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/EO062i016p00161

R.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||197|The paper describes an analytical method for calculating in detail the size distributions of small crystallites and nuclei in supercooled liquids as they are being quenched to form a glass and subsequently reheated above the glass transition to produce crystallization. This method is applied to experiments performed using differential thermal analysis (DTA) to estimate the barriers to crystal nucleation and the cooling rates required to form glasses or bodies with various degrees of crystallinity. DTA data and derived nucleation barriers are reported for anorthite and for the following lunar compositions: 15498, 15418, matrix and intrusion compositions of breccia 15286, Apollo 15 green glass, Luna 24 highland basalt, and 65016.|

H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||2343|The hypothesis that a dynamo once existed in the moon, and hence was the source of lunar paleomagnetism, is tested using a model for the global thermoremanent magnetization of spherical lithospheres. Various models of an ancient lunar dipole field are used which incorporate intensity variations and reversals, and which are consistent with lunar sample paleointensities. It is found that non-reversing lunar dynamos which have simple exponential decay histories beginning at 4.6 b.y. ago are inconsistent with this limit, unless the moon has been thoroughly demagnetized to a depth of tens of kilometers by impacts or other processes. An early lunar dynamo cannot be excluded by global scalar measurements unless the permanent lunar dipole moment is shown to be significantly less than 10 to the 13th power G/cu cm by future spacecraft measurements, which may be technologically impossible; vector measurements of lunar magnetic anomalies over the whole moon offer a possibility of determining the source of the field which magnetized the lunar crust.|

W.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2019|Measurements of the Al-26 and Mn-53 in interior portions of lunar rocks have shown that lunar surface processes which move a significant fraction of kilogram size rocks on the lunar surface occur on time scales of a few million years. These measurements, together with noble gas age dating have made it possible to define the history for nine rock samples selected from whole rock counting data because of anomalously low Al-26 relative to Na-22. Six of the rocks from the Apollo 15 and 16 missions showed evidence of movement during the past five million years. Of these six, only two are of an age consistent with their origin from the South Ray Crater Event. In addition, our measurements of Na-22 and Al-26 in Apollo 17 double drive tube 74001-74002 suggest that one to two cm of soil is missing from the top of this core tube. Even with this loss, at least two cm of gardening is indicated in the top portion of 74002.|

(1977) has been used to measure the depth distribution of C on grain surfaces for Apollo 11, 15, 16 and 17 soil breccias. The surface C concentration of all samples studied lies between 2 and 8 times 10 to the 15th atoms per sq cm, showing no correlation with the volume C, which varies over an order of magnitude. If the observed variation represents the presence of unexposed grains on the surfaces studied, these results indicate a steady state surface C concentration of 5 to 10 times 10 to the 15th atoms per sq cm, accumulated over a time scale short compared with that required for the formation of volume-related C and with the mean lifetime of grains at the lunar surface. About one-third to one-half of the total C in lunar soil seems to be surface-correlated.|

W., Chou, C. -L.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||669|Sample 70019 is a glass-coated soil breccia recovered from the bottom of a 3 m crater on the floor of the Taurus-Littrow Valley. Trace-element and magnetic analysis show that the glass and breccia are both derived from the same local material, probably soil. The glass and breccia are sufficiently similar chemically and magnetically that it can be suggested that the glass formed in situ or that the glass and breccia arrived together to the crater where the sample was found from a common local source, perhaps a nearby primary crater. The glass apparently was not reduced chemically during its formation although such reduction often occurs in such lunar surface processes. Whereas the glass should give a measure of the magnetic field at the Apollo 17 landing site at the time of the formation of the glass, the breccia was probably not heated sufficiently to be similarly useful.|

D.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1491|U-Th-Pb analyses of bulk samples of soil breccia 70019, when compared to KREEP data, indicate that different lunar samples are sometimes characterized by distinctly different initial Pb isotopic compositions. U-Th-Pb analyses on nonglassy samples and a glassy separate of soil breccia 70019, and bulk and agglutinate samples of soil 72701 showed that the glassy samples did lose considerable Pb relative to U less than 200 million years ago. These data support the contention of other investigators that vaporization of volatile elements owing to impact events significantly alters the chemistry of the lunar regolith. Metaclastic rock 60315 was reanalyzed and was found to be concordant at 3.93 billion years rather than slightly discordant, as was previously reported.|
1975LPSC....6..693U|1975|The formation of lunar breccias: sintering and crystallization kinetics.|Uhlmann, D. R., Klein, L., Onorato, P. I. K., Hopper, R. W.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||693|The process of clastic breccia formation by viscous sintering in a stress-free environment is analyzed by treating crystallization and sintering as concurrent, competing processes. The kinetic analysis of crystallization is based on the construction of continuous cooling curves corresponding to the degree of crystallinity observed in the matrix of the breccia. These curves are obtained from corresponding time-temperature-transformation curves, which in turn are constructed from measured values of the crystal growth rate together with calculated values of the nucleation frequency. The kinetic analysis of sintering is based on a modification of the Frenkel (1945) treatment of viscous sintering appropriate for conditions of continuous cooling. The analysis is applied to Lunar Composition 70019 to illustrate the approach. It is shown that it is possible from the kinetic analysis to estimate both the rate at which a given breccia cooled and the minimum temperature at which the matrix particles came in contact. The results obtained for Lunar Composition 70019 seem physically reasonable and suggest that this sample cooled on the surface of the moon in its present form rather than buried in an ejecta blanket from which it was later excavated.|
