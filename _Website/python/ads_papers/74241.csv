SW He and Ne composition has been analyzed in ilmenites of lunar soils (71501, 12001, 74241) and regolith breccias (79135, 79035, 14301) by closed system stepwise etching. The samples have SW antiquities ranging from ~0.1 to ~3.7 Gyr. The experiments have a very high depth resolution; thus, possible artifacts that may compromise the precise determination of the SW composition can be controlled. The nominal average (<SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He)<SUB>SW</SUB> ratios correlate with the SW antiquity, suggesting at first glance a (<SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He)<SUB>SW</SUB> increase of 6% per Gyr. In addition, also the (<SUP>20</SUP>Ne/<SUP>22</SUP>Ne)<SUB>SW</SUB> ratio seems to have increased with time by about 2% per Gyr. However, there are reasons indicating that the apparent temporal increase of (<SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He)<SUB>SW</SUB> is an artifact. First, there is no straightforward explanation for a concurrent temporal change of (<SUP>20</SUP>Ne/<SUP>22</SUP>Ne)<SUB>SW</SUB> to the extent observed. Second, the average nominal (<SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He)<SUB>SW</SUB> and (<SUP>20</SUP>Ne/<SUP>22</SUP>Ne)<SUB>SW</SUB> ratios correlate with each other, and this correlation parallels the one displayed by the single etch steps, indicating a progressive admixture of the deeper sited, isotopically heavier solar energetic particles with ongoing etching. We suggest that the nominal temporal variation of (<SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He)<SUB>SW</SUB> and (<SUP>20</SUP>Ne/<SUP>22</SUP>Ne)<SUB>SW</SUB> is the result of secondary processes that cause erosion of the outermost layers of the regolith grains and thus a partial removal of the very surface-sited SW. Correcting this partial grain surface loss, assuming a constant SW Ne isotopic composition throughout the Sun's lifetime, leads to constant (<SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He)<SUB>SW</SUB> at (4.47+/-0.13)×10<SUP>-4</SUP> within the last ~4 Gyr. The results suggest that the present-day (<SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He)<SUB>SW</SUB> can directly be used to deduce the protosolar (D+<SUP>3</SUP>He)/<SUP>4</SUP>He composition and that a possible mixing between radiative interior and convective zone must be restricted to a thin boundary layer.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/378402

R.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|88||907|Cooling rates required to form glassy or partly-crystalline bodies of 14 lunar compositions have been estimated using a previously introduced, simplified model. The calculated cooling rates are found to be in good agreement with cooling rates measured for the same compositions. Measurements are also reported of the liquidus temperature and glass transition temperature for each composition. Inferred cooling rates are combined with heat flow analyses to obtain insight into the thermal histories of samples 15422,14162, 15025, 74220,74241,10084,15425, and 15427. The critical cooling rates required to form glasses of 24 lunar compositions, including the 14 compositions of the present study, are suggested to increase systematically with increasing ratio of total network modifiers/total network formers in the compositions. This reflects the importance of melt viscosity in affecting glass formation.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB088iS02p0A907

M.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||341|Results on lunar volatile transport processes have been obtained by studying green and brown glass droplets, orange and black core tube samples and the surface sample 74241 with the Scanning Auger Microprobe (SAM) and by Flameless Atomic Absorption Analysis (FLAA). SAM analyses show that the most dominant volatiles in the top few atomic layers of droplets are Zn and S, confirming that the surface Zn and S are good indicators of pyroclastic origin, and they are not entirely present as ZnS. In addition, FLAA thermal release profiles show that almost all the Zn and Cd are on grain surfaces, indicating that Zn and Cd were completely outgassed from lava fountain products during the volcanic eruption, were recondensed during or after the eruptions, and are thus present as surface coating.|

The study of the cosmic-ray-produced isotopes He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe in the basaltic rocks 74235, 74255, and 74275, in bulk soil samples from the orange soil 74220, from the gray soils 74241 and 74261, and from the black soil 74001, and in grain size separates from the black soil allows the determination of the cosmic-ray exposure history of these samples. All three rocks experienced at least a two-stage exposure as can be judged from the comparison of their irradiation geometry at the time of collection with that inferred from depth-dependent relative abundances of cosmic-ray-produced nuclei. The exposure histories of the rocks and soils are characterized by four events or periods. These results show that the Shorty impact occurred no more than 30 m.y. ago. The most probable age of this crater is 19 m.y., when the large boulder was excavated from the subfloor. The trapped solar-wind concentration in the black soil is extremely low, on the average only 0.3% of that usually found for lunar soil.|

O., Jr., Jovanovic, S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||3917|Parallel leaching and volatilization experiments conducted on lunar samples and similar experiments on sphalerite do not supply the information needed to resolve the question of the chemical nature of Pb-204, Zn, Bi, and Tl deposits on lunar soil surfaces. It is proposed that in Apollo 17 mare and terra soils the fractions of Pb-204, Zn, and Tl that are insoluble under mild, hot pH 5 HNO3, leaching conditions and involatile at 600 C were originally surface deposits which became immobilized by migration into the silicate substrate or by chemisorption. Most of the Bi does not seem to be the result of such a deposit. The implication is also that the soils, over their respective times of evolution, were exposed to heavy metal vapors or that an episodic exposure occurred after they had evolved. A sequence of events is proposed to account for orange 74220 and black 74001 glasses by lava fountaining and for soil 74241 as tephra from an explosive volcanic eruption.|

B.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||2275|The surface chemistry of Apollo 17 lunar fines samples 74220 (the orange soil) and 74241 (the gray control soil) has been studied by measuring the adsorption of nitrogen, argon, and oxygen (all at -196 C) and also water vapor (at 20 C or 22 C). In agreement with results for samples from other missions, both samples had low initial specific surface areas, consisted of nonporous particles, and were attacked by water vapor at high relative pressures to give an increased specific surface area and create a pore system which gave rise to a capillary condensation hysteresis loop in the adsorption isotherms. In contrast to previous samples, both of the Apollo 17 soils were partially hydrophobic in their initial interaction with water vapor (both samples were completely hydrophilic after the reaction with water). The results are consistent with formation at high temperatures without subsequent exposure to significant amounts of water.|
1974JGR....79.5453A|1974|Dielectric comparison of lunar and terrestrial fines at lunar conditions.|Alvarez, R.|Journal of Geophysical Research|79||5453|The dielectric properties of lunar fines 74241,2 in the audio-frequency range under lunarlike conditions are presented. Results suggest that volatiles are released during storage and transport of the lunar sample. Apparently, subsequent adsorption of volatiles on the sample surface alters its dielectric response. The assumed volatile influence disappears after evacuation. A comparison of the dielectric properties of lunar and terrestrial materials as a function of density, temperature, and frequency indicates that if the terrestrial sample analyzed were completely devoid of atmospheric moisture, it would present dielectric losses smaller than those of the lunar sample. It is concluded that density prevails over temperature as the controlling factor of dielectric permittivity in the lunar regolith and that dielectric losses vary slowly with depth.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB079i035p05453

The ilmenites, particularly in 74241, contain up to 7.8 wt.% MgO and display higher bireflectance than low-Mg ilmenites. They commonly contain exsolution-like chromite and rutile and occasionally are in association with native Fe in an assemblage probably resulting from reduction. The chromian ulvöspinels are similar to Apollo 11 spinels in that they contain near-equal amounts of chromite and ulvöspinel molecules. No primary chromites were observed. Most native Fe has No and Co contents of < 1 wt.%; some in 74220 contained 5-6% Ni and < 1% Co in association with schreibersite. All armalcolites examined are optically and chemically similar and the common mantling by Mg ilmenite leads us to conclude they are the ortho-armalcolite of S.E. Haggerty. We have collected optical (reflectivety and bireflectance) and microhardness data for the ilmenites, ulvöspinels and armalcolites. These are the first microhardness determinations for the last two minerals.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(73)90219-7
