1983LPSC...13..907F|1983|Cooling Rates for Glass Containing Lunar Compositions|Fang, C. Y., Yinnon, H., Uhlmann, D. R.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|88||907|Cooling rates required to form glassy or partly-crystalline bodies of 14 lunar compositions have been estimated using a previously introduced, simplified model. The calculated cooling rates are found to be in good agreement with cooling rates measured for the same compositions. Measurements are also reported of the liquidus temperature and glass transition temperature for each composition. Inferred cooling rates are combined with heat flow analyses to obtain insight into the thermal histories of samples 15422,14162, 15025, 74220,74241,10084,15425, and 15427. The critical cooling rates required to form glasses of 24 lunar compositions, including the 14 compositions of the present study, are suggested to increase systematically with increasing ratio of total network modifiers/total network formers in the compositions. This reflects the importance of melt viscosity in affecting glass formation.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB088iS02p0A907

He, Ne, Ar and solar flare tracks are measured on plagioclase separates of 12 surface soils and two Apollo 15 drill core samples, and track density histograms are compared with gas concentration distributions obtained from aliquot samples. Results show that solar wind Ar is probably well retained in all minerals. He, Ne, and Ar are not saturated macroscopically, and semi-microscopic or microscopic saturation is very rare for Ar, even in gas-rich plagioclase populations. All grains contain trapped noble gases, even in relatively gas-poor mineral populations, and for clean minerals in the size range of 150-200 microns, the time between the first and last surface exposure is in the order of 10 to the 7th to 10 to the 8th years.|

It is concluded from the measured Au/Ir ratios and from the absence of a surface enrichment of Co that the material in the drive tube 74001/2 is not the result of an impact of an iron meteorite into a lava lake, but originated in at least three volcanic eruptions. No indication of a later disturbance of the stratigraphy of the layers is observed. Exposure ages of 345,000 and 225,000 years result from Ir deposits for the two layers of 74002.|

R.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1763|Time- and temperature-dependent techniques were used in He and H2 gas, in an investigation of the neutron-irradiated grain-size fractions of magnetically separated minerals and agglutinates from the Apollo 17 soil 75080. The time-dependent release of gamma-ray spectroscopy-determined volatile trace elements, at 1000 C shows that volatile species are enriched on both mineral and agglutinate surfaces. A highest-to-lowest volatility series was experimentally determined, which shows Hg, Cd, Zn, Se, In, Br, Ag. Laboratory experiments also show that moderate temperatures, greater than 250 C, lead to a volatilization of other elements than Hg, which evaporates at less than 130 C. This suggests that small traces of these elements may be volatile under lunar day-time conditions, and it is concluded that the vapor phase and agglutination processes are important in the distribution and redistribution of lunar volatiles.|

M.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||341|Results on lunar volatile transport processes have been obtained by studying green and brown glass droplets, orange and black core tube samples and the surface sample 74241 with the Scanning Auger Microprobe (SAM) and by Flameless Atomic Absorption Analysis (FLAA). SAM analyses show that the most dominant volatiles in the top few atomic layers of droplets are Zn and S, confirming that the surface Zn and S are good indicators of pyroclastic origin, and they are not entirely present as ZnS. In addition, FLAA thermal release profiles show that almost all the Zn and Cd are on grain surfaces, indicating that Zn and Cd were completely outgassed from lava fountain products during the volcanic eruption, were recondensed during or after the eruptions, and are thus present as surface coating.|

Since these droplets have S + Zn surface coatings with characteristics that fit a volcanic origin, the presence of similar coatings on dispersed droplets are taken as a good criterion of their volcanic origin. This criterion in concert with other criteria (homogeneity, absence of shocked relicts) that distinguish between volcanic and impact origins, has led to identification of a new ultramafic endogenous liquid that was erupted at Apollo 15. The brown glass droplets representing this liquid have a higher TiO2 content and are more mafic than any of the Apollo 15 basalts.|

W.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2049|Flameless atomic absorption (FLAA), X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and grain size separation techniques were adopted to analyze Pb, Cd, Zn and S in orange and black droplets from Apollo 17 samples. The FLAA and XPS investigations show volatile trace metal enrichment in smaller grain fractions (broken droplets); thus a part of the volatiles was probably deposited after break-up of the droplets. In addition, redistribution of the volatiles by a cratering event is indicated by continuous decreases in Pb and Cd with core depth. Studies of Zn on individual regolith grains are also reported.|

V.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2287|Surface exposure (or, equivalently, maturity) indices of lunar soils are a measure of residence time of soil in the upper one millimeter of the regolith. Several concepts concerning the use of and terminology associated with maturity indices are discussed. For reasons which include its generally-applicable nature and large data base, the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) surface exposure (maturity) index I<SUB>s/FeO</SUB> (the ratio of the value of the intensity in arbitrary units of the FMR resonance at g equal to about 2.1 to the FeO concentration) is particularly suitable and useful. A compilation of values of I<SUB>s/FeO</SUB> for 164 Apollo surface and trench soils and six Luna 24 core soils is given.|
1978LPSC....9...83W|1978|Primary matter in the lunar highlands: The case of the siderophile elements.|Waenke, H., Dreibus, G., Palme, H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||83|Most highland breccias of the Apollo 16 mission contain considerable amounts of siderophiles. The Ni/Co ratio of about 17 in these breccias is close to the Cl value of 21.6 and hence a meteoritic origin of these siderophiles is generally assumed. However, the Ni/Co ratio of the earth's mantle of about 18 would give an even closer match. Any reduction process on such terrestrial material would yield a metal almost indistinguishable from meteoritic metal on the basis of the Ni/Co ratio alone. It is argued that the distribution of siderophiles in highland samples is consistent with evidence in favor of the hypothesis that the moon formed from material of the earth's mantle.|

O., Jr., Jovanovic, S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||3917|Parallel leaching and volatilization experiments conducted on lunar samples and similar experiments on sphalerite do not supply the information needed to resolve the question of the chemical nature of Pb-204, Zn, Bi, and Tl deposits on lunar soil surfaces. It is proposed that in Apollo 17 mare and terra soils the fractions of Pb-204, Zn, and Tl that are insoluble under mild, hot pH 5 HNO3, leaching conditions and involatile at 600 C were originally surface deposits which became immobilized by migration into the silicate substrate or by chemisorption. Most of the Bi does not seem to be the result of such a deposit. The implication is also that the soils, over their respective times of evolution, were exposed to heavy metal vapors or that an episodic exposure occurred after they had evolved. A sequence of events is proposed to account for orange 74220 and black 74001 glasses by lava fountaining and for soil 74241 as tephra from an explosive volcanic eruption.|

B.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||2275|The surface chemistry of Apollo 17 lunar fines samples 74220 (the orange soil) and 74241 (the gray control soil) has been studied by measuring the adsorption of nitrogen, argon, and oxygen (all at -196 C) and also water vapor (at 20 C or 22 C). In agreement with results for samples from other missions, both samples had low initial specific surface areas, consisted of nonporous particles, and were attacked by water vapor at high relative pressures to give an increased specific surface area and create a pore system which gave rise to a capillary condensation hysteresis loop in the adsorption isotherms. In contrast to previous samples, both of the Apollo 17 soils were partially hydrophobic in their initial interaction with water vapor (both samples were completely hydrophilic after the reaction with water). The results are consistent with formation at high temperatures without subsequent exposure to significant amounts of water.|

The ilmenites, particularly in 74241, contain up to 7.8 wt.% MgO and display higher bireflectance than low-Mg ilmenites. They commonly contain exsolution-like chromite and rutile and occasionally are in association with native Fe in an assemblage probably resulting from reduction. The chromian ulvöspinels are similar to Apollo 11 spinels in that they contain near-equal amounts of chromite and ulvöspinel molecules. No primary chromites were observed. Most native Fe has No and Co contents of &lt; 1 wt.%; some in 74220 contained 5-6% Ni and &lt; 1% Co in association with schreibersite. All armalcolites examined are optically and chemically similar and the common mantling by Mg ilmenite leads us to conclude they are the ortho-armalcolite of S.E. Haggerty. We have collected optical (reflectivety and bireflectance) and microhardness data for the ilmenites, ulvöspinels and armalcolites. These are the first microhardness determinations for the last two minerals.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(73)90219-7
