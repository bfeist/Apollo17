2014DPS....4621315F|2014|Radar observations and physical modeling of binary near-Earth asteroid (1862) Apollo|Ford, Thomas F., Benner, Lance A., Brozovic, Marina, Leford, Bruce, Nolan, Michael C., Giorgini, Jon D., Ostro, Steve J., Margot, Jean-Luc|AAS/Division for Planetary Sciences Meeting Abstracts|46||213.15|Binary asteroid 1862 Apollo has an extensive observational history allowing many of its characteristics to be investigated. Apollo was one of the first objects to show evidence for the YORP effect (Kaasalainen et al. 2007, Nature 446, 420) and its mass has been estimated by detection of the Yarkovsky effect (Nugent et al. 2012, AJ 144, 60; Farnocchia et al. 2013, Icarus 224, 1). We observed Apollo at Arecibo and Goldstone from Oct. 29-Nov. 13, 2005, obtaining a series of echo power spectra and delay-Doppler images that achieved resolutions as high as 7.5 m/pixel. The Arecibo images show that Apollo is a binary system with a rounded primary that has two large protrusions about 120 deg apart in longitude. We used the Arecibo data and published lightcurves to estimate the primary's 3D shape. Our best fit has major axes of ~1.8x1.5x1.3 km and a volume of ~1.6 km^3. The protrusions have lengths of ~300 and 200 m, are on the primary's equator, and give Apollo a distinctly different appearance from the primaries with equatorial ridges seen with other binary near-Earth asteroids. We estimated the pole by starting with the Kaasalainen et al. spin vector of ecliptic (longitude, latitude)=(50 deg, -71 deg) +- 7 deg and letting it float. Our best fit has a pole within 11 deg of (longitude, latitude)=(71, -72). Convex models produced from inversion of lightcurves by Kaasalainen et al. and thermal infrared data by Rozitis et al. (2013, A&A 555, A20) are more oblate than our model, do not show protrusions, and have somewhat different pole directions. The Arecibo images reveal weak but persistent echoes from a satellite on Nov. 1 and 2 but cover only a fraction of its orbit. The images are insufficient to estimate the satellite's shape and yield a rough estimate for its long axis of 190 m. Preliminary fits give an orbital period of ~27.0-27.5 h and a semimajor axis of ~3.5-4.0 km, implying a mass of 2.8-3.9E12 kg and a bulk density of 1.7-2.4 g/cm^3. The density is consistent with estimates reported by Rozitis et al. and Farnocchia et al., providing the first independent test using a binary to estimate the density of near-Earth asteroid that has also been estimated through detection of the Yarkovsky effect.|

1989JGR....9417839H|1989|Pb, Sr, and Nd isotopes in seamount basalts from the Juan de Fuca Ridge and Kodiak-Bowie Seamount Chain, northeast Pacific|Hegner, E., Tatsumoto, M.|Journal of Geophysical Research|94|B12|17,839|Pb, Sr, and Nd isotopic ratios and their parent/daughter element concentrations for 28 basalts from 10 hotspot and nonhotspot seamounts are reported. Nd and Sr isotopic compositions (<SUP>143</SUP>Nd/<SUP>144</SUP>Nd = 0.51325-0.51304; <SUP>87</SUP>Sr/<SUP>86</SUP>Sr = 0.70237-0.70275) plot in the envelope for Juan de Fuca-Gorda ridge basalts with tholeiitic basalts showing more depleted sources and a better negative correlation than transitional to alkalic basalts. Pb isotopic ratios in tholeiitic and alkalic basalts overlap (<SUP>206</SUP>Pb/<SUP>204</SUP>Pb = 18.29-19.44) and display a trend toward more radiogenic Pb in alkalic basalts. The isotopic data for hotspot and nonhotspot basalts are indistinguishable and correlate broadly with rock composition, implying that they are controlled by partial melting. The isotopic variation in the seamount basalts is about 60% (Nd-Sr) to 100% (Pb) of that in East Pacific Rise basalts and is interpreted as a lower limit for the magnitude of mantle heterogeneity in the northeast Pacific. The data indicate absence of a chemically distinct plume component in the linear seamount chains and strongly suggest an origin from mid-ocean ridge basalt-like east Pacific mantle.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB094iB12p17839
