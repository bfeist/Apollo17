H., Rudowski, R.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||339|Electron microprobe analyses have been performed on glasses of impact origin in Apollo 11 breccias (10059, 10060, 10061), Apollo 12 soil (12070), and Apollo 15 breccias (15318, 15425, 15426, 15427). These glasses were produced by shock melting of regolith, rather than of rock. Simple concepts for better understanding and interpreting the chemical data from impact glasses have been developed. These concepts are a significant improvement on earlier strategies, which centered principally on cluster analysis. Using ratios of refractory lithophile elements, the compositional effects of fractional vaporization often associated with impact melting to obtain chemical information about the mare and highland components in the regoliths parental to the glasses have been 'seen through'. This method is also applied to the mare-derived impact glasses from Apollo 16 in order to place constraints on the types of volcanic components occurring in Mare Nectaris. Since impact glasses can be used to derive chemical constraints on the indigenous lithologies comprising multi-component regoliths; the frequent occurrence of these glasses, as well as their low masses, should make them critically important for study when small quantities of grab-samples are returned by future unmanned spacecraft from planets, satellites, and asteroids where regoliths are present.|

V.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2287|Surface exposure (or, equivalently, maturity) indices of lunar soils are a measure of residence time of soil in the upper one millimeter of the regolith. Several concepts concerning the use of and terminology associated with maturity indices are discussed. For reasons which include its generally-applicable nature and large data base, the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) surface exposure (maturity) index I<SUB>s/FeO</SUB> (the ratio of the value of the intensity in arbitrary units of the FMR resonance at g equal to about 2.1 to the FeO concentration) is particularly suitable and useful. A compilation of values of I<SUB>s/FeO</SUB> for 164 Apollo surface and trench soils and six Luna 24 core soils is given.|
