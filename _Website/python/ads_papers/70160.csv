The fractions above 7 microns were further partitioned into mineral-rich and agglutinate-rich portions using a magnetic separator. Five major and more than 20 volatile and nonvolatile trace elements were measured in each fraction using INAA and RNAA techniques. The concentrations of the volatile trace elements in the agglutinate-rich fraction are always higher (up to a factor of 10) and are predominantly volume correlated. The grain-size dependency of the volatiles in the mineral-rich fraction is much more pronounced. Major elements and nonvolatile trace elements are about equally distributed among the agglutinates and minerals and do not show a systematic trend in their size dependency. The enrichments of siderophilic and chalcophilic trace elements in the regolith are due to meteoritic (Au, Co, Ge, Te) and volcanic (Cd, Zn) contributions. Mare basalts represent the main source for the lithophilic elements in the regolith.|
