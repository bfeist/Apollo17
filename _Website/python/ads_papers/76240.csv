M., Pillinger, C. T.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|88||B200|Using stepped heating extraction techniques, determinations of carbon and nitrogen content and delta C-13 and delta N-15 values have been obtained for selected lunar soils and breccias. Only nitrogen data have been gathered for representative splits separated by size, density and magnetic properties from 12023. A plot of the total delta C-13 (after terrestrial contamination is removed) versus delta N-15 values for bulk samples reveals little evidence for a correlation between isotopically light carbon and isotopically light nitrogen of putative ancient solar wind origin. Soil 12023 is used to examine the current interpretation for the stepped release profile of nitrogen from bulk lunar samples. Mature agglutinates, postulated by previous workers to be the host of the light nitrogen, are shown to have a very constant delta N-15 value which is heavy rather than light. The actual host of the light nitrogen in 12023 has not been identified. The lowest values encountered during the study were found associated with the finest soil, but none of these was as low as for some temperature steps of the bulk soil. Interpretations regarding the origin of light nitrogen, if it is not present in agglutinates, await the results of more definitive efforts to identify the host phase.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB088iS01p0B200

V.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2287|Surface exposure (or, equivalently, maturity) indices of lunar soils are a measure of residence time of soil in the upper one millimeter of the regolith. Several concepts concerning the use of and terminology associated with maturity indices are discussed. For reasons which include its generally-applicable nature and large data base, the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) surface exposure (maturity) index I<SUB>s/FeO</SUB> (the ratio of the value of the intensity in arbitrary units of the FMR resonance at g equal to about 2.1 to the FeO concentration) is particularly suitable and useful. A compilation of values of I<SUB>s/FeO</SUB> for 164 Apollo surface and trench soils and six Luna 24 core soils is given.|
