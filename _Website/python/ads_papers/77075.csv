V., Jolliff, B. L., Van Soest, M. C., Wartho, J. A., Weirich, J. R.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2015||P33C-2136|Several boulders located at the bases of the North and South Massifs were among the primary field targets of the Apollo 17 mission to the Taurus-Littrow Valley on the Moon [1]. Some boulders are polylithologic, including Boulder 1 at Station 2 and the boulders at Stations 6 and 7. These boulders were the subjects of consortium studies [2, 3] that included 40Ar/39Ar geochronology to determine the ages of distinct lithologies within each boulder [e.g., 4-6]. We report new 40Ar/39Ar data for the impact melt breccias 72255, 76315, 77075, and 77135 obtained using the UV laser ablation microprobe (UVLAMP) methods of [7]. For 72255, we obtained a preliminary isochron date ca. 3814 Ma from 22 melt analyses, which is younger than published plateau dates (e.g., 3951-3835 Ma [4, 8]). Fifteen melt analyses of 76315 yield a preliminary isochron date ca. 3850 Ma, younger than the 3900 Â± 16 Ma date reported by [8]. Melt analyses of 77075 yield preliminary dates between ca. 3797-3584 Ma, possibly reflecting partial loss of 40Ar. In this case, the oldest date may provide a minimum age for the formation of melt in 77075. Finally, the UVLAMP dates for the 77135 melt range from 3810-3361 Ma and corresponding Ca/K ratios range from ca. 100-6. Electron microprobe analyses of small (ca. 10s of microns wide) pockets of K-rich materials show that both K-rich glass and K-feldspar are present. The UVLAMP dates for 77135 likely reflect spatially variable 40Ar loss, consistent with published step heating results [e.g., 6]. References: [1] Schmitt (1973) Science, 182, 681-690.

K.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|88||603|Mg-suite noritic rocks can be divided into two groups, the Mg-gabbronorites and the Mg-norites. The rocks of these groups differ in ratios of high-Ca pyroxene to total pyroxene, compositions of pyroxene and plagioclase, assemblages of Ti-, Nb-, and Zr-bearing minerals, compositions of chrome spinel, bulk-rock Ti/Sm and Sc/Sm, and measured ages. The two groups probably crystallized from different types of parent magmas. Two hypotheses are offered for the differences in composition of the parent magmas. One hypothesis ascribes the differences to compositional heterogeneity of the mantle source areas. The other hypothesis ascribes the differences to variations in extent of partial melting of the mantle source regions and variations in extent of assimilation of the anorthosite and the highly differentiated residual liquid that were produced during the primordial lunar differentiation.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB088iS02p0A603

L.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|12||577|Data on the bulk chemical composition of the soils collected at and under the surface of the Apollo 16 landing site are synthesized and reviewed, with emphasis placed on the way in which the compositional trends within the soils relate to the site geology. Two distinct compositional mixing trends are discerned. One involves addition to this surface Cayley component of a material such as that ejected by North Ray Crater. The other is thought to be a segment of a mixing line between the average melt fraction of the local Cayley component and pure or nearly pure anorthosite. Grain size fractions of Apollo 16 soils exhibit a general trend of higher concentrations of large ion lithophile (LIL) elements associated with plagioclase in the finest fraction compared with the coarse fractions. The suite of pristine nonmare rocks (as currently recognized) is found to be insufficient to model the Apollo 16 soils.|

1980LPSC...11..481P|1980|The meteoritic contamination of terrestrial and lunar impact melts and the problem of indigenous siderophiles in the lunar highland.|Palme, H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||481|It is noted that similarities in chemistry and texture between terrestrial and lunar impact melts can be extended to meteoritic elements. The absolute amount of the meteoritic contamination, as well as the observed variations in concentrations of meteoritic elements in the Apollo 17 melt sheet, is comparable to what is observed in some large terrestrial melt sheets. In favorable cases, concentrations of siderophile meteoritic elements in the basement (indigenous component) can be found on the basis of correlations of two meteoritic elements in impact melt samples. Indigenous Ni and Co concentrations found in this way for the Apollo 17 melt are, respectively, 40 + or - 15 ppm Ni and 21.6 + or - 3.5 ppm Co. It is noted that these values are consistent with a chondritic Ni/Co ratio of the projectile.|

D., Ryder, G.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||531|The petrology and geochemistry of pristine lunar highlands rock samples consisting of ferroan anorthosites, norites, troctolites, spinel troctolites/dunite/lherzolite, and KREEP, are described. In addition, petrographic and chemical evidence is presented which shows that low-siderophile rocks are the result of endogenous igneous activity and not impact melt differentiation. For example, these rocks contain Fe-metal as a late-crystallizing phase, and have W/La ratios higher than polymict breccias.|
1978LPSC....9...83W|1978|Primary matter in the lunar highlands: The case of the siderophile elements.|Waenke, H., Dreibus, G., Palme, H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||83|Most highland breccias of the Apollo 16 mission contain considerable amounts of siderophiles. The Ni/Co ratio of about 17 in these breccias is close to the Cl value of 21.6 and hence a meteoritic origin of these siderophiles is generally assumed. However, the Ni/Co ratio of the earth's mantle of about 18 would give an even closer match. Any reduction process on such terrestrial material would yield a metal almost indistinguishable from meteoritic metal on the basis of the Ni/Co ratio alone. It is argued that the distribution of siderophiles in highland samples is consistent with evidence in favor of the hypothesis that the moon formed from material of the earth's mantle.|

T.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||877|A systematic interdisciplinary study of the Apollo 17 station 7 boulder, from the foot of the North Massif at Taurus-Littrow, is described. The astronauts observed four lithologies: a large white clast represented by 77215, cut by dark dikelets (77075) and enclosed in blue-gray breccia (77115); the assemblage of these three rock types is in turn surrounded by green-gray breccia (77135). The history of the station 7 boulder, as construed from the results of the consortium study, is presented.|
1977LPSC....8.2301N|1977|The history of the Apollo 17 Station 7 boulder.|Nakamura, N., Tatsumoto, M.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2301|Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd methods were used to determine the age of the dark dikelets 77075 cutting the 4.36 b.y. noritic breccia 77215 of the Station 7 boulder of Apollo 17. A regression line corresponding to an age of 4.07 plus or minus 0.09 b.y. is obtained with an Rb-87 decay constant of 1.41 x 10 to the -11th/yr and an initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio of approximately 0.69918. It is noted that the intrusion age of the dikelets provides the most reliable criterion for determining the age of the entire boulder, i.e., the boulder is not an extension of 77115, which formed more recently. Attention is given to a generalized lunar history during the first 600 m.y.|

L.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|23|3|413|Preliminary petrographic description and mineral composition of four hand samples (77135, 77115, 77075 and 77215) are presented. 77135, 77115, and 77075 all crystallized from fragment-laden melts; they are similar in textures but differ in grain size. 77135 and 77115 are pigeonite feldspathic basalts. On the basis of geologic and petrographic evidence, 77115 and 77075 are related; they formed, cooled, and consolidated before being engulfed in the vesicular 77135. The impact or igneous origin of the melts from which these rocks crystallized cannot be determined. 77215 is a shocked, strongly sheared and granulated microbreccia consisting of three major lithologies dominated by mineral clasts of orthopyroxene and calcic plagioclase. The orthopyroxene clasts contain coarse exsolved blebs of augite, suggesting a deep-seated origin. The major, minor, and trace element compositions of 77135, 77115, and 77075 are in general similar. They represent a major highland rock type, perhaps more important than anorthosites.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(74)90130-7

E.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|23|3|429|The Apollo 17 astronauts removed four rocks samples to represent each of the lithologies they recognized in the boulder at station 7: sample 77215 from an off-white meter-sized block; sample 77075 from one of the thin dikes that cross the off-white block; 77115 from the blue-gray rock adjacent to the off-white block and apparently continuous with thin dikes that cross the block; sample 77135 of the tan-gray or green-gray vesicular rock adjacent to the blue-gray (77115) rock. A consortium of investigators has been organized, under the leadership of E.C.T. Chao, to study the samples. Each sample shows a number of lithologic types in terms of clasts (or xenoliths) and matrices. A table shows how subsamples have been allocated for consortium study. Maps and photographs show the relations between subsample locations and lithologies for the two more dissected samples, 77115 and 77135.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(74)90131-9

F., Schuhmann, S., Kouns, C. W., Lum, R. K. L., Philpotts, J. A.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|23|3|439|Apollo 17 station 7 boulder consortia samples were analyzed for major and minor elements by a combined semimicro atomic absorption spectrophotometric and colorimetric procedure. Lithophile trace element abundances were determined by stable isotope dilution mass spectrometry. Three matrix types samples (77135, 77115, and 77075) were found to be KREEP-rich fragment-laden melts with analogues throughout the Apollo 17 landing site. Of the five clasts analyzed, at least one (77115,19, troctolite) is thought to be a cumulate; 77135, 77115, and 77075 are thought to have originated by impact fusion of material with similar composition. This original material may represent a partial melt of a parent material of the composition of an included, shocked norite breccia (77215).|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(74)90133-2
