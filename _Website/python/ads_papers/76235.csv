1980LPSC...11..365J|1980|Rocks of the early lunar crust.|James, O. B.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||365|Data are summarized which suggest a model for the early evolution of the lunar crust. According to the model, during the final stages of accretion, the outer part of the moon melted to form a magma ocean approximately 300 km deep. This ocean fractionated to form mafic and ultramafic cumulates at depth and an overlying anorthositic crust made up of ferroan anorthosites. Subsequent partial melting in the primitive mantle underlying the crystallized magma ocean produced melts which segregated, moved upward, intruded the primordial crust, and crystallized to form layered plutons consisting of Mg-rich plutonic rocks. Intense impact bombardment at the lunar surface mixed and melted the rocks of the two suites to form a thick layer of granulated debris, granulitic breccias, and impact-melt rocks.|

T., Anders, E.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1537|Radiochemical neutron activation analyses for Ag, Au, Bi, Br, Cd, Cs, Ge, In, Ir, Ni, Os, Pd, Rb, Re, Sb, Te, Tl, U and Zn were carried out on 11 samples from the Apollo 11 and 12 sites (two samples of rock 12013, one granitic and one KREEPy; 4 KREEP fragments from 2-4 mm soil 12033,2; 4 anorthositic fragments from 1-3 mm soil 10085,104; 1 sample of 'Luny' rock-felsite-KREEP breccia 12013 10085,31 LR-1). Most Apollo 12 samples were found to have an Imbrium meteoritic component; others, typified by the Luny breccia, apparently contain a new meteoritic component of low Re content. Components of higher Ir/Au ratio (3L, 5L and 7) were found in Apollo 11 anorthositic samples; the fact that their enrichment in meteoritic siderophiles parallels that of Fe, Mg, REE and other KREEP elements is consistent with progressive contamination of an anorthositic crust. The Luny rock was tentatively classified Group 2, supporting the assignment of this group to Serenitatis.|
