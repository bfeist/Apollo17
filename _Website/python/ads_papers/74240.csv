S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||3095|Ropy glasses are a major soil component in the Apollo 17 gray soils 74240 and 74260. These particles form a distinct morphological type characterized by a wide range of dynamic shapes with a diagnostic sorted and welded fine-grained debris coating. Apollo 17 ropy glasses show abundant evidence for shock. Shocked lithic and mineral inclusions, lack of any igneous textures, and lechatelierite, all indicate an impact origin. A striking similarity is observed between the lunar ropy glasses and the glass impact bombs (Flaedle) of the Ries Crater in Germany. A highland basaltic composition was observed for the Apollo 17 ropy glasses in contrast to the KREEP composition of ropy glasses from the Apollo 12 and Apollo 14 landing sites. Other workers have presented convincing evidence that ejecta from Tycho reached the Taurus-Littrow Valley, and these ropy glasses may represent Tycho ejecta. However, the close stratigraphic association of the ropy glasses with the greater than 3.5 b.y. old orange glass suggests the ropy glasses may be too old to be Tycho ejecta, which should be only about 100 m.y. old. If this is the case, the ropy glasses represent impact glasses from a very old impact in an unknown highlands source area.|

N.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||3685|Previous studies have shown that the bulk of the nitrogen in soils has been implanted by the solar wind, that the N-15/N-14 ratio of the implanted nitrogen has apparently increased with time, and that both soils and rocks contain a nitrogen component greatly enriched in N-15, relative to natural abundance ratios, due to cosmic-ray spallation. An investigation was, therefore, conducted to test the feasibility of using spallation-produced N-15 for determining cosmic-ray exposure ages. Samples from several depths in the Apollo 15 deep drill core were analyzed. The data obtained have also been evaluated with regard to possible models for the prior history of the material now in the Apollo 15 core. In addition, analyses have been performed of several other soil samples considered for various reasons to be of particular interest, such as orange soil 74220 and its companion 74240, Apollo 16 drill core sample 60002, and the apparently peculiar fillet soil 67461. Wherever possible, analyses were carried out by step-wise heating rather than by total pyrolysis. On the basis of the results of the investigation it is concluded that nitrogen isotope ratio determinations provide a usable method for determining cosmic-ray exposures for soils.|
