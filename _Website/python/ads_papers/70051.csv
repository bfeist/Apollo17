Samples and simulants of lunar soil must be established for these studies. We present here the bulk and mineral chemistries of unusual Apollo 17 sample 70051, the &lt;45-μm fraction of 70051, and the bulk and mineral chemistries of lunar soil simulants MLS-1A, JSC-1A, and JSC-1Af. Comparison to lunar soils collected during the Apollo missions shows that 70051 has bulk chemistry similar to that of soils from the North Massif bounding the Valley of Taurus-Littrow. Particle-size distribution reveals 70051 to differ significantly from bona fide lunar soils. It is a coarse, immature sample with &gt;80 % of particles &gt;50 μm, and a constrained range of particle sizes (~50% of particles are 50-100 μm in size) when compared to typical Apollo 17 soils (e.g., 71501,1 has ~20% of particles in the 50-100 μm range). Plagioclase, present in rock fragments and as mineral fragments (up to sizes ~1 mm), is the main phase present (50.5 vol%). Simulant JSC-1A has a chemistry that is atypical for most of the Moon and contains 49.3 vol% glass. Simulant MLS-1A resembles the FeO, TiO<SUB>2</SUB> and Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB> contents of mare basalt soils. Both lunar soil simulants have specific properties for certain in situ resource utilization studies, however, neither fully matches both the physical and chemical characteristics of lunar soil. Sample 70051, as a 1.4-kg haphazard mixture of lunar soil particles, is probably the best of the Apollo ``soil'' samples to be allocated for various ISRU investigations, where the uniqueness of lunar soils is deemed a necessity for study.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2006JE002767

E.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||2175|A method is given for sensitive dielectric measurements at a series of microwave frequencies using a section of coaxial line. The line is used as a 1-port cavity resonator; it resonates when the electrical length of the center conductor equals 1, 2 . . . , N half-wave lengths. The dielectric properties of an Apollo 17 dried soil sample were measured in vacuum over a temperature range of 173 to 373 K. The relative permittivity and the loss tangent were determined and the frequency dependence was very small. The derivative with respect to temperature, per degree, was 0.00045 for the permittivity and 0.00002 for the loss tangent.|
