Samples and simulants of lunar soil must be established for these studies. We present here the bulk and mineral chemistries of unusual Apollo 17 sample 70051, the <45-μm fraction of 70051, and the bulk and mineral chemistries of lunar soil simulants MLS-1A, JSC-1A, and JSC-1Af. Comparison to lunar soils collected during the Apollo missions shows that 70051 has bulk chemistry similar to that of soils from the North Massif bounding the Valley of Taurus-Littrow. Particle-size distribution reveals 70051 to differ significantly from bona fide lunar soils. It is a coarse, immature sample with >80 % of particles >50 μm, and a constrained range of particle sizes (~50% of particles are 50-100 μm in size) when compared to typical Apollo 17 soils (e.g., 71501,1 has ~20% of particles in the 50-100 μm range). Plagioclase, present in rock fragments and as mineral fragments (up to sizes ~1 mm), is the main phase present (50.5 vol%). Simulant JSC-1A has a chemistry that is atypical for most of the Moon and contains 49.3 vol% glass. Simulant MLS-1A resembles the FeO, TiO<SUB>2</SUB> and Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB> contents of mare basalt soils. Both lunar soil simulants have specific properties for certain in situ resource utilization studies, however, neither fully matches both the physical and chemical characteristics of lunar soil. Sample 70051, as a 1.4-kg haphazard mixture of lunar soil particles, is probably the best of the Apollo ``soil'' samples to be allocated for various ISRU investigations, where the uniqueness of lunar soils is deemed a necessity for study.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2006JE002767

D.|37th Annual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference|37||2334|70051 has great potential as a ground truth for remote-sensing data of the Apollo 17 site. This soil is also important for in-situ resource utilization studies. Such significance has prompted us to perform a detailed characterization of this unique soil.|

1975Moon...14..291A|1975|Compaction by Impact of Unconsolidated Lunar Fines|Ahrens, Thomas J.|Moon|14|2|291|New Hugoniot and release adiabate data for 1.8 g cm<SUP>-3</SUP> lunar fines (sample, 70051) in the ç2 to ç70 kbar range demonstrate that upon shock compression intrinsic crystal density (ç3.1 g cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) is achieved undershock stresses of 15 to 20 kbar. Release adiabate determinations indicate that measurable irreversible compaction occurs upon achieving shock pressures above ç4 kbar. For shocks in the ç7 to 15 kbar range, the inferred,post-shock, specific volumes observed decrease nearly linearly with increasing peak shock pressures. Upon shocking to ç15 kbar the post-shock density is approximately that of the intrinsic minerals. If the present data for sample 70051 are taken to be representative of the response to impact of unconsolidated regolith material on the Moon, it is inferred that the formation of appreciable quantities of soil breccia can be associated with the impact of meteoroids or ejecta at speeds of as low as ç1 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00565328

L.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||2919|Ultrasonic P- and S-wave velocities of lunar rock powders 172701, 172161, 170051, and 175081 were measured at room temperature and to 2.5 kb confining pressure. The results compare well with those of terrestrial volcanic ash and powdered basalt. P-wave velocity values up to pressures corresponding to a lunar depth of 1.4 km preclude cold compaction alone as an explanation for the observed seismic velocity structure at the Apollo 17 site. Application of small amounts of heat with simultaneous application of pressure causes rock powders to achieve equivalence of seismic velocities for competent rocks.|
