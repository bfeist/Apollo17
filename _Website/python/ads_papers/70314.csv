M., Peckett, A., Krähenbühl, U.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|42|11|1687|Breccia fragments have been analyzed from the 2-4 mm sieve fraction of three Apollo 16 soils collected in the vicinity of North Ray Crater (63503,17 at Station 13; 67603,1 and 67703,14 at Station 11). Ar <SUP>39</SUP>-Ar <SUP>40</SUP> ages, Ar <SUP>37</SUP>-Ar <SUP>38</SUP> exposure ages, abundances of major and certain trace elements, and petrographie data relevant to thermal history have been obtained for up to 48 individual fragments. Among the samples. 30 gave Ar <SUP>39</SUP>-Ar <SUP>40</SUP> release patterns that allowed the assignment of a high- or intermediate-temperature plateau age and the recognition of three age groups. Group I (10 fragments) are 4.12-4.21 AE, Group 2 (13 fragments) are 3.89-4.02 AE, and Group 3 (6 fragments) are <2.5 AE in age. Only one fragment (3.60 AE) falls outside this grouping and possibly represents Theophilus ejecta. The probability that the gap between 4.12 and 4.02 AE is a statistical fluctuation is only ̃2%. The exposure ages cluster strongly around 50 × 10 <SUP>6</SUP>y. the age of North Ray Crater. The oldest, Group 1 fragments are all anorthositic metamorphosed breccias of light-matrix type. The younger. Group 2 fragments are noritic anorthosite and anorthositic norite breccias with textures indicative of greater annealing (melted matrix), one totally melted sample being of KREEP-basalt texture. The very young. Group 3 fragments are chiefly of glass or devitrified glass. There is a marked distinction between Groups 1 and 2 in compositional as well as textural properties. The Group 2 breccias are generally enriched in Mg, K and REE relative to the aluminous Group I breccias (eg. K ≤ 400 ppm in Group 1 and mostly ≥ 600 ppm in Group 2). This difference is attributed to the introduction of KREEP and mafic ANT components during the formation of the Group 2 breccias. The results are interpreted as reflecting two magnitudes of cratering. The older craters (>4.1 AE) were of medium size (diameters up to a few hundred kilometers), large enough to reset the ages but not capable of excavating deeper than predominantly feldspathic (anorthositic) layers of the crust. The younger craters (̃3.9-4.0 AE) were, in contrast, those ascribed to major basin-forming events and were therefore capable of excavating a deeper and wider spectrum of crustal lithologies. The latter resulted in admixture of KREEP and mafic ANT components with the feldspathic ANT, cover layer. KREEP was thus only excavated in abundance during the basin-forming events, from a sub-crustal layer formed initially at ̃4.4 AE but incorporated in the breccias at ̃4 AE. The KREEP-contaminated. Group 2 breccias have - except two fragments - ages between 3.95 and 4.02 AE. This group includes a crystallized melt (3.97 ± 0.04 AE), close in composition and texture to 14310 (3.87 ± 0.04 AE) which is generally attributed to the Imbrian basin-forming event (̃3.88 AE). The pre-Imbrian. Group 2 breccias of Apollo 16 can best be attributed to the Nectaris basin-forming event, which according to the clustered ages probably occurred at ̃3.98 AE. Our results support a multi-impact lunar cataclysm with the formation of Nectaris (3.98 AE). Humorum.
