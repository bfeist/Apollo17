L.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||487|Regression and pattern recognition techniques were applied to 16 chemical species in 34 Apollo 17 basalts. The classification scheme of Pratt et al., (1977) was used. Data were absent for 8 MnO, 3 Hf, 3 Tb, and 8 Cr2O3 analyses. Linear regression studies were utilized to predict these and values obtained were added to the original data base. Pattern recognition techniques were then applied to predict classifications for 30 different Apollo 17 rake basalts analyzed by Murali et al., (1977).|
