Darby, Orlando, Thomas M.|Icarus|255||24|The desorption activation energies for water molecules chemisorbed on Apollo lunar samples 72501 (highlands soil) and 12001 (mare soil) were determined by temperature programmed desorption experiments in ultra-high vacuum. A significant difference in both the energies and abundance of chemisorption sites was observed, with 72501 retaining up to 40 times more water (by mass) and with much stronger adsorption interactions, possibly approaching 1.5 eV. The dramatic difference between the samples may be due to differences in mineralogy and surface exposure age. The distribution function of water desorption activation energies for sample 72501 was used as an initial condition to simulate water persistence through a temperature profile matching the lunar day.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2014.09.049

To learn more about these fractionation processes, we studied the compositions of submicrometer glass spheres from two Apollo 17 sampling sites using electron microscopy. The majority of the analyzed glasses show evidence for varying degrees of impact-induced chemical fractionation. Among these are HASP glasses (high-Al, Si-poor), which are believed to represent the refractory residuum left after the loss of volatile elements (e.g., Si, Fe, Na) from the precursor material. In addition to HASP-type glasses, we also observed a group of volatile-rich, Al-poor (VRAP) glasses that represent condensates of vaporized volatile constituents, and are complementary to the HASP compositions. High-Ti glasses were also found during the course of this study, and are documented here for the first time.|

M., Pillinger, C. T.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|88||B200|Using stepped heating extraction techniques, determinations of carbon and nitrogen content and delta C-13 and delta N-15 values have been obtained for selected lunar soils and breccias. Only nitrogen data have been gathered for representative splits separated by size, density and magnetic properties from 12023. A plot of the total delta C-13 (after terrestrial contamination is removed) versus delta N-15 values for bulk samples reveals little evidence for a correlation between isotopically light carbon and isotopically light nitrogen of putative ancient solar wind origin. Soil 12023 is used to examine the current interpretation for the stepped release profile of nitrogen from bulk lunar samples. Mature agglutinates, postulated by previous workers to be the host of the light nitrogen, are shown to have a very constant delta N-15 value which is heavy rather than light. The actual host of the light nitrogen in 12023 has not been identified. The lowest values encountered during the study were found associated with the finest soil, but none of these was as low as for some temperature steps of the bulk soil. Interpretations regarding the origin of light nitrogen, if it is not present in agglutinates, await the results of more definitive efforts to identify the host phase.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB088iS01p0B200

B.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|12||389|The present investigation represents an extension of a comparative regolith study reported by Labotka et al. (1980) to the Apollo 17 site and to the east limb of the moon (Luna 16, 20, and 24 sites). Chemical systematics are considered, taking into account major and minor element characteristics, and large ion-lithophile patterns (K, REE, and Th). Attention is also given to chemical mixing calculations and the significance of the fine fraction. It is found that the chemistries of 1000-90, 90-20, and 20-10 micrometer size fractions are very similar to each other but quite different from the 'less than 10 micrometer' fine fractions. The 'less than 10 micrometer' fine fractions, which comprise about 5 to 20% of the bulk soils, are consistently more feldspathic and enriched in LIL-rich material relative to the coarse fractions in all soils. The KREEP type is different at each site and is largely derived locally.|

C.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|12||371|A progress report is presented concerning an investigation involving a comprehensive chemical and petrologic study of surface soils from all nine lunar sampling sites. The soils selected for this study are part of the lunar highlands soils suite and represent the soils at each site that contain abundant highland-derived material. The current report takes into consideration, in addition to the eight soils discussed by Labotka et al. (1980) and by Laul and Papike (1980), three Apollo 17 soils (72501, 76501, and 78221), and three Luna soils (21000, L-16; 22001, L-20; and 24999, L-24). Attention is given to the modal petrology of the 1000-90 micrometer fraction of all 14 soils, and the modes and mineral and glass chemistries of the 90-20 and 20-10 micrometer fractions of the Apollo 17 and Luna soils. In an evaluation of the obtained results, it is found that except for rare, large-scale impacts, lateral mixing is an inefficient process. Comminution and vertical mixing appear to be the dominant process.|

V.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2287|Surface exposure (or, equivalently, maturity) indices of lunar soils are a measure of residence time of soil in the upper one millimeter of the regolith. Several concepts concerning the use of and terminology associated with maturity indices are discussed. For reasons which include its generally-applicable nature and large data base, the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) surface exposure (maturity) index I<SUB>s/FeO</SUB> (the ratio of the value of the intensity in arbitrary units of the FMR resonance at g equal to about 2.1 to the FeO concentration) is particularly suitable and useful.
