A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2335|The paper presents petrographic and mineralogical data for five samples from Boulder 2 (72315, 72335, 72355, 72375, and 72395) and sample 72435 from Boulder 3 at Apollo 17 Station 2. All the samples were found to consist of a few percent megaclasts set in a fine-grained matrix, which is comprised of microclasts and a poikilitic to subophitic-textured groundmass that crystallized from a melt. The samples have similar modal mineralogies, mineral compositions, and bulk-chemical compositions.|
