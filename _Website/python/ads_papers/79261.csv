1996M&PS...31..362H|1996|Search for fullerenes in lunar fines 10084 and 79261|Heymann, D.|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|31|3|362|Radicati di Brozolo et al. (1994) found the fullerenes C<SUB>60</SUB> and C<SUB>70</SUB> in and around a micrometeorite impact pit on the skin of the LDEF (Long Duration Exposure Facility) spacecraft and concluded that the fullerenes had formed from C of the micrometeorite. Becker et al. (1994) concluded that C<SUB>60</SUB> and C<SUB>70</SUB> in C-bearing rocks from the large Sudbury impact structure had come mostly from C of the impacting bolide. These observations suggested that fullerenes had formed by analogous impacts on the Moon. One sample from the Apollo 11 site and one from the Apollo 17 site were treated with toluene for the extraction of C<SUB>60</SUB> and C<SUB>70</SUB>. The extracts were analyzed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) for the presence of C<SUB>60</SUB> and C<SUB>70</SUB> fullerenes. No fullerenes were detected. Either the formation of fullerenes from extra lunar C on the Moon had very low yields, or fullerenes were formed with detectable yields but were quantitatively removed from the surface of the Moon in a short time.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1945-5100.1996.tb02073.x

1978LPSC....9.2287M|1978|The surface exposure (maturity) of lunar soils: Some concepts and I<SUB>S</SUB>/FeO compilation.|Morris, R. V.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2287|Surface exposure (or, equivalently, maturity) indices of lunar soils are a measure of residence time of soil in the upper one millimeter of the regolith. Several concepts concerning the use of and terminology associated with maturity indices are discussed. For reasons which include its generally-applicable nature and large data base, the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) surface exposure (maturity) index I<SUB>s/FeO</SUB> (the ratio of the value of the intensity in arbitrary units of the FMR resonance at g equal to about 2.1 to the FeO concentration) is particularly suitable and useful. A compilation of values of I<SUB>s/FeO</SUB> for 164 Apollo surface and trench soils and six Luna 24 core soils is given.|
