2009GeCoA..73.5884H|2009|Isotopic and elemental abundances of copper and zinc in lunar samples, Zagami, Pele’s hairs, and a terrestrial basalt|Herzog, G. F., Moynier, F., Albarède, F., Berezhnoy, A. A.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|73|19|5884|We used ICP-MS to measure the elemental concentrations and isotopic abundances of Cu and Zn in: nine Ti-rich lunar basalts (10017, 10022, 10024, 10057, 70215, 71055, 74255, 75055, and 75075); size-separated samples prepared by sieving of pyroclastic black glass 74001, orange glass 74022, and the lunar soils 15021, 15231, 70181, and 79221; a basalt from the Piton des Neiges volcano, Reunion Island; two samples of Pele's hairs from the Nyiragongo volcano, Democratic Republic of Congo, and the martian meteorite Zagami. The isotopic fractionation of zinc in lunar basalts and Zagami is mass dependent relative to a terrestrial standard (JMC 400882B). These and published results imply that lunar, terrestrial, meteoritic, and perhaps martian zinc all come from one or more reservoirs linked by mass-dependent fractionation processes. Relative to terrestrial basalts, Ti-rich lunar basalts are enriched in the heavier isotopes of Cu and Zn: we find for Ti-rich lunar basalts the following ranges and averages ±1 - σ (‰): δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu/ <SUP>63</SUP>Cu ≡ δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu, 0.1-1.4, 0.5 ± 0.1‰ ( N = 7); δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn/ <SUP>64</SUP>Zn ≡ δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn = 0.2-1.9, 1.2 ± 0.2‰ ( N = 8; 10017 excluded). For two terrestrial samples, we find δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn ̃ +0.3‰ and δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu ̃ 0‰, which are consistent with published values. The differences between the lunar basalts and terrestrial basalts could reflect minor, planetary-scale vaporization or igneous processes on the Moon. Data for size separates of the pyroclastic glasses 74001 and 74220 confirm the well-known surface correlation of Cu and Zn, but modeling calculations reveal no sharp differences between either the elemental ratios or the isotopic composition of grain interiors and exteriors. The absence of such differences indicates that the isotopic compositions for bulk samples are dominated by a light-isotope-rich surface component. Data for size separates of lunar soils also confirm the surface correlation of Cu and Zn, but an enrichment of heavy rather than light isotopes. Averages for bulk lunar soils from this work and the literature are (‰): δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu, from 1.4 to 4.1, average 3.0 ± 0.3 ( N = 9); δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn, from 2.2 to 6.4, average 4.0 ± 0.3 ( N = 14). As with the glasses, in all but soil 15231 our data show no strong differences between the isotopic composition of soil sub-samples with small and large grains. The size of the isotopic fractionation inferred for the surface component in the soils is 3× smaller than predicted by a published model of sputtering primarily by solar particles. At the same time, the observed fractionation is larger than predicted by calculations based on a model of micrometeorite impact heating and hydrodynamic quenching. Because impact heating appears unable to explain the observations, we conclude that sputtering must be important even though samples with very large isotopic fractionation of Cu and Zn have not yet been found.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2009.05.067

H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||259|The paper deals with new and more accurate determinations of uranium, thorium, and isotopic lead data for five bulk samples and separate pyroxene, ilmenite, and plagioclase from basalt 71055. In a concordia diagram, the samples suggest a postcrystallization disturbance of the U-Pb systems of the rock. There is no compelling reason, from U-Pb data, to believe that the moon is younger than 4.55 AE.|
1975JGR....80.4471H|1975|Micrometeorites and solar flare particles in and out of the ecliptic|Hutcheon, I. D.|Journal of Geophysical Research|80|B32|4471|Using crystals grown into vugs from oriented lunar rocks as directional detectors of cosmic dust particles and solar flare nuclei, I have measured the angular distribution of the flux of micrometeoroids of mass ~3×10<SUP>-17</SUP> to ~8×10<SUP>-14</SUP> g. Hypervelocity impact craters of diameter 500 Å to 10 μm and tracks from solar flare nuclei of energy ~100 keV/amu to ~20 MeV/amu were observed in crystals from rock 71055 facing lunar south and in crystals from rock 74255 facing lunar east. The vug geometry restricts the region of space viewed by the crystal detectors such that only particles streaming nearly normal to the ecliptic could enter the vug from 71055, while only particles confined to the ecliptic could enter the vug from 74255. By comparing the size-frequency distributions and circularity distributions of craters observed on these orthogonal crystals, I have found that dust grains both in ecliptic orbits and in orbits inclined to the ecliptic have virtually identical mass-frequency distributions and similar shapes. I have evaluated the micrometeoroid fluxes after determining the exposure ages of the individual vug crystals by measuring the solar flare track density gradients in each crystal. The flux of particle of mass >4×10<SUP>-15</SUP> g confined to the ecliptic is ~1.1×10<SUP>-2</SUP>/m<SUP>2</SUP> s 2π sr. This value is in good agreement with satellite measurements, suggesting that the micrometeoroid flux has been relatively constant over the past 35,000 yr. The flux of particles producing microcrater on a lunar surface facing south is lower than the ecliptic flux by a factor of ~7. This experiment was unable to distinguish between interstellar dust or interplanetary particles in highly inclined orbits as the source of craters observed on the south-facing surface. The solar flare energy spectra observed in vug crystals from both 71055 and 74255 deviate from the long-term spectrum determined by Hutcheon et al. (1974) at energies below ~10 MeV/amu. I conlude that the shallow energy spectrum cannot be a result of erosion and suggest that the experimental data from which the long-term low-energy Fe spectrum has been derived must be reexamined carefully.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB080i032p04471

L.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||2903|Linear strain measurements are presented for two lunar basalts, 14310,82 and 71055,15 and one breccia, 15498,23 to 5 kb hydrostatic pressure. Compressional and shear acoustic velocities to 5 kb are also presented for the basalts, 14310,82 and 71055,15. These elastic properties, along with geological, seismological and rock mechanics considerations are consistent with a model of the structure of the Taurus-Littrow valley as follows, a thin surface regolith overlying a fractured mixture of basalt flows and ejecta material which in turn overlies a coherent breccia of highland ejecta debris.|
