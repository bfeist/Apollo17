E., Allen, C., Pieters, C. M., Paige, D. A.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2014||P13D-3841|The Diviner Lunar Radiometer, onboard NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, has produced the first global, high resolution, thermal infrared observations of an airless body. The Moon, which is the most accessible member of this most abundant class of solar system objects, is also the only body for which we have extraterrestrial samples with known spatial context. Here we present the results of a comprehensive study to reproduce an accurate simulated lunar environment, evaluate the most appropriate sample and measurement conditions, collect thermal infrared spectra of a representative suite of Apollo soils, and correlate them with Diviner observations of the lunar surface. It has been established that thermal infrared spectra measured in a simulated lunar environment (SLE) are significantly altered from spectra measured under terrestrial conditions. The data presented here were collected at the University of Oxford Simulated Lunar Environment Chamber (SLEC). In SLEC, the lunar environment is simulated by: (1) pumping the chamber to vacuum pressures (&lt;10-4 mbar) sufficient to simulate lunar heat transport processes within the sample, (2) cooling the chamber with liquid nitrogen to simulate radiation to the cold space environment, and (3) heating the samples with heaters and lamp to set-up thermal gradients similar to those experienced in the upper hundreds of microns of the lunar surface. A comprehensive suite of experiments were conducted using different sample preparation and heating conditions on Apollo soils 15071 (maria) and 67701 (highland) and compared the results to Diviner noontime data to select the optimal experimental conditions. Additional thermal infrared measurements in optimized SLE were made of 10084 (A11 - LM), 12001 (A12 - LM), 14259 (A14 - LM), 15071 (A15 - S1), 15601 (A15 - S9a), 61141 (A16 - S1), 66031 (A16 - S6), 67701 (A16 - S11), and 70181 (A17 - LM).The Diviner dataset includes all six Apollo sites at approximately 200 m spatial resolution. We find that analyses of Diviner observations of individual sampling stations and SLE measurements of returned Apollo soils show good agreement, while comparisons to thermal infrared reflectance under terrestrial conditions do not agree well, which underscores the need for SLE measurements and validates the Diviner compositional dataset.|
2013AGUFM.P54B..05S|2013|Lunar Regolith Maturity Controlled By Ilmenite Content And Micro-Meteor Flux Variability|Schmitt, H. H.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2013||P54B-05|Synthesis of Is/FeO maturity indexes for Apollo 17 regolith samples in the valley of Taurus-Littrow on the Moon indicate that high levels of ilmenite in the samples significantly reduces the level of this indicator of space exposure. The analysis, along with consideration of regolith glass characteristics, also discloses that micro-meteor fluxes vary over geologic time, presumably in response to significant impact events in the Asteroid Belt. Surface samples of ilmenite-poor, silicate-rich regolith have about 80-90% higher maturity indexes than surface samples of ilmenite-rich, basaltic regolith of comparable exposure. For comparison of the history of various regolith exposures to the space environment, Taurus-Littrow's light mantle avalanche deposit, the youngest large area stratigraphic unit, provides a specific time horizon. For at least the last ~110 million years, the currently estimated age of the light mantle avalanche, most near surface (upper 1-5cm) regolith has had approximately the same exposure to micro-meteors. The surface of the largely ilmenite-rich basalt fill in the valley has been exposed to space at least as long or possibly 30 million years longer than the light mantle, based on exposure ages for large boulder ejecta in the Camelot cluster of craters. High apparent maturity (Is/FeO &gt;80), however, exists only on three types of regolith surfaces: (1) the North Massif apron (e.g., 77431), (2) the light mantle avalanche deposit (e.g., 72161), and (3) low ilmenite basalt (e.g., 72150). Only intermediate to low maturity (Is/FeO &lt;60) has developed in surface regolith overlying high titanium basalt (e.g., 70181). TiO2/TiO2+FeO ratios provide a good measure of original ilmenite content, ilmenite being the only quantitatively significant titanium-bearing mineral in the regolith. Those ratios for samples showing high and intermediate apparent maturity are about 0.35 and 0.25, respectively. A well documented, 3.5 billion year old basaltic regolith (77240, 77260) exposed at Shorty Crater as a unit stratigraphically overlying the orange ash, has exceptionally low maturity (8% agglutinates and Is/FeO = 5) but an unusually high amount of "ropy" glass (14-18%). (Ropy glass normally constitutes less than on percent of new Taurus-Littrow regolith. It forms within fresh impact craters as a result of macro-meteor impacts, but the current flux of micro-meteors disaggregates such glass within a million years or less.) The light mantle avalanche deposit protected this ancient regolith unit at Shorty Crater for at up to 90 million years prior to the Shorty impact 14-17 million years ago. A significant micro-meteor flux cannot have existed during the formation of this ancient regolith or it would have a higher maturity index and little or no ropy glass. Variable maturities observed in core samples from elsewhere in the valley of Taurus-Littrow may be the result of either variable mirco-meteor flux or variable exposure during periods of moderate flux or a combination of both.|

The goal of this work is to analyze and understand the solar reflectance of the Moon. Our approach is to compare Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Diviner orbital solar albedo measurements at the Apollo soil sample sites with laboratory bidirectional reflectance measurements. CAPTEM provided us with five representative lunar soil samples: a typical low albedo mare sample (10084, Apollo 11), a low titanium basaltic sample with impact breccias (12001, Apollo 12), an Apollo 15 sample (15071), a high albedo lunar highlands soil (68810 &amp; 61141, Apollo 16) and an Apollo 17 soil sample (70181). The laboratory and Diviner datasets provide complementary and independent insights into the photometric properties of the lunar surface. We have made the most extensive set of laboratory bidirectional measurements of lunar soil to date and have successfully fit photometric models to the laboratory data.|

S.|New Views of the Moon 2: Understanding the Moon Through the Integration of Diverse Datasets|||64|It is the fine fractions that dominate the observed spectral signatures of bulk lunar soil, and the next to the smallest size fractions are the most similar to the overall properties of the bulk soil. Thus, our Lunar Soil Characterization Consortium has concentrated on understanding the inter-relations of compositional, mineralogical, and optical properties of the &lt;45-micron size fraction and its component sizes (20-44 micron, 10-20 micron, and &lt;10 micron size fractions). To be able to generalize our results beyond the particular sample set studied, it is necessary to quantitatively identify the observed effects of space weathering and evaluate the processes involved. For this, it is necessary to know the chemistry of each size fraction, modal abundances of each phase, average compositions of the minerals and glasses, I<SUB>s</SUB>/FeO values, reflectance spectra, and the physical makeup of the individual particles and their patinas. This characterization includes the important dissection of the pyroxene minerals into four separate populations, with data on both modes and average chemical compositions. Armed with such data, it should be possible to effectively isolate spectral effects of space weathering from spectral properties related to mineral and glass chemistry. Four mare soils from the Apollo 17 site were selected for characterization based upon similarities in bulk composition and their contrasting maturities, ranging from immature to submature to mature. The methodology of our characterization has been discussed previously. Results of the Apollo 17 mare soils, outlined herein, are being prepared for publication in MAPS. As shown, with decreasing grain size, the agglutinitic (impact) glass content profoundly increases. This is the most impressive change for the mare soils. In several soils we have examined, there is an over two-fold increase in the agglutinitic glass contents between the 90-150- micron and the 10-20-micron size fractions. Accompanying this increase in agglutinitic glass is a definite decrease in pyroxenes and to lesser extents, the oxides (ilmenite), volcanic glass, and olivine. Unexpectedly, however, the absolute plagioclase abundances stay relatively constant throughout the different grain sizes, although the abundance of plagioclase relative to the mafic minerals increases with decreasing particle size. These soils were chosen for study based upon their similarities in FeO and Ti02 content, allowing for direct comparisons between evolutions of chemistry between size fractions and among different maturities of soils. The bulk chemistry of these fractions was determined by EMP analyses of fused glass beads. In contrast to the systematic variations in bulk chemistry discussed below, the relatively uniform composition of agglutinitic glass with grain size and soil maturity is illustrated. The composition of the bulk fraction of each size fraction becomes more feldspathic with increasing maturity, with the effect being most pronounced for the finest fractions. The composition of the agglutinitic glass, however, is relatively invariant and more feldspathic (i.e., rich in Al2O3) than even the &lt;10-micron fraction. This relation not only strengthens the "fusion of the finest fraction" (F(sup 3)) hypothesis, but also highlights the important role of plagioclase in the formation of agglutinitic glass. With decreasing grain size, FeO, MgO, and TiO2 contents decrease, whereas CaO, Na2O, and Al2O3 (plag components) increase for all soils. These chemical variations would appear to be coupled with the significant increase in agglutinitic glass and decrease in oxide (ilmenite),pyroxene, and volcanic glass. These changes in chemistry do not appear to be due to distinct changes in the compositions of individual phases but to their abundances. Values of I<SUB>s</SUB>/FeO increase with decreasing grain size, even though the bulk FeO contents decrease. That is, the percentage of the total Fe that is present as nanophase Fe(sup O) has increased substantially in the smaller size fraction. Note that the increase in nanophase FeO in smaller size fractions is significantly greater than the increase in agglutinitic glass content, with its single-domain FeO component. This would seem to indicate that at least some of the FeO is surface correlated. To illustrate this effect, if it is assumed that the nanophase FeO is entirely surface correlated, then equal masses of 15-micron and 6-micron spheres should have about 3x as much FeO in the finer fraction. The recent findings of Kelleret al. of the major role of vapor-deposited, nanophase FeO-containing patinas on most soil particles is a major breakthrough in our understanding of the distribution of FeO within agglutinitic glass and upon grain surfaces. Bidirectional reflectance spectra for a representative Apollo 17 soil (70181) are shown. The size separates all have similar albedo in the blue and follow a regular sequence in which the continuum slope increases, ferrous bands weaken, and albedo, increases with decreasing particle size. The bulk &lt;45-micron soil is typically close to the 10-20 micron spectrum. It is important to note that although the finest fraction (&lt;10 micron) is close in composition to the abundant agglutinitic glass in each size fraction, this size fraction is relatively featureless and does not dominate the spectrum of the bulk &lt;45-micron soil. It has long been suspected that agglutinitic glass, to a large extent, is the product of melting of the finest fraction of the soils, with a dominance of plagioclase. Given the low abundance of pyroxene in the finest fractions of each soil the source of the FeO in these Apollo 17 agglutinitic glasses is not fully identified. We suspect the abundant volcanic glass in these samples may be a significant contributor and this hypothesis will be tested with the suite under study from other Apollo sites.|

C.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|12||371|A progress report is presented concerning an investigation involving a comprehensive chemical and petrologic study of surface soils from all nine lunar sampling sites. The soils selected for this study are part of the lunar highlands soils suite and represent the soils at each site that contain abundant highland-derived material. The current report takes into consideration, in addition to the eight soils discussed by Labotka et al. (1980) and by Laul and Papike (1980), three Apollo 17 soils (72501, 76501, and 78221), and three Luna soils (21000, L-16; 22001, L-20; and 24999, L-24). Attention is given to the modal petrology of the 1000-90 micrometer fraction of all 14 soils, and the modes and mineral and glass chemistries of the 90-20 and 20-10 micrometer fractions of the Apollo 17 and Luna soils. In an evaluation of the obtained results, it is found that except for rare, large-scale impacts, lateral mixing is an inefficient process. Comminution and vertical mixing appear to be the dominant process.|

The agglutinate compositions in the soils differed from the host soil compositions except for samples from the North Massif. Local materials from the valley floor and the massifs appear to form the pre-Central Cluster regolith. It is also shown that chemical mixing models for bulk soil compositions can be misleading unless the petrologic characteristics of each soil are taken into account.|
