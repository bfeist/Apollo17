R.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference|||1805|Crystal Size Distributions (CSDs) and mineral geochemistry are presented for ilmenite crystals in a Type B2 (70275,35) lunar sample, and two Type C (74255,55 and 74275,312) lunar samples.|
1995GeCoA..59.2817N|1995|<SUP>146</SUP>Sm-<SUP>142</SUP>Nd formation interval for the lunar mantle|Nyquist, L. E., Wiesmann, H., Bansal, B., Shih, C. -Y., Keith, J. E., Harper, C. L.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|59|13|2817|Now-extinct <SUP>146</SUP>Sm (t<SUB>1/2</SUB>= 103Ma) was present in the early solar system, and lunar basalts might be expected to have inherited small anomalies in <SUP>142</SUP>Nd abundances from mantle sources with variable Sm/Nd ratios established during the early global differentiation of the Moon. <SUP>142</SUP>Nd/<SUP>144</SUP>Nd ratios were measured for several lunar basalts, and values of ∊Nd142, (deviations from terrestrial <SUP>142</SUP>Nd/<SUP>144</SUP>Nd in parts in 10<SUP>4</SUP>) calculated for them. The ∊Nd142 values show very small variations attributable to <SUP>146</SUP>Sm decay. Neutron capture near the lunar surface also modified both the samarium and neodymium isotopic compositions of the basalt samples. The calculated neutron fluences range from ∼0 to ∼7.8 × 10<SUP>16</SUP> n/cm<SUP>2</SUP>. Both thermal and epithermal neutron fluences were calculated from the Sm isotopic compositions of the basalts and used to correct the ∊Nd142 values for neutron capture by neodymium. Well-resolved radiogenic enrichments ∊Nd142 and +0.17 ± 0.08 (2σ), respectively, were measured for lunar meteorite Asuka 881757 and Apollo 17 basalt 74255, respectively, for which the neutron fluences were nil. Basalts 70135 and 75075, which were exposed to small, measureable neutron fluences of ∼2.5 × 10<SUP>15</SUP> and ∼7.7 × 10<SUP>15</SUP> n/cm<SUP>2</SUP>, respectively, have neutron-corrected ∊Nd142 values of +0.25± 0.15 and +0.29 ± 0.11, respectively. The average value of radiogenic ∊Nd142 for the three high-Ti basalts from Apollo 17 is +0.22 ± 0.06. Neutron capture effects were greater for the other basalts, but can be corrected using the measured neutron fluences derived from the samarium isotopic data. The neutron-corrected ∊Nd142 for Apollo 12 ilmenite basalt 12056, consistent with its derivation from a highly depleted mantle source also. Three low-Ti basalts from Apollo 12 and Apollo 15 (12038, 15076, 15555), have neutron corrected ∊Nd142 which are not resolved from zero, and average +0.04 ± 0.06. A fourth low-Ti basalt, 12039, has neutron-corrected ∊Nd142, but is subject to the largest neutron correction of ∼0.32 ∊-units. KREEP basalt 14078 was exposed to only a small neutron fluence of ∼6.4 × 10<SUP>15</SUP> n/cm<SUP>2</SUP>, and has a small deficit of <SUP>142</SUP>Nd, corresponding to ∊Nd142. The average neutron-corrected ∊Nd142 of three KREEP basalts is -0.05 ± 0.04. The ∊Nd142 values of the basalts correlate with <SUP>147</SUP>Sm/<SUP>144</SUP>Nd values for their source regions as calculated from their ages and initial ∊Nd142 values. <SUP>147</SUP>Sm- <SUP>143</SUP>Nd and <SUP>146</SUP>Sm- <SUP>142</SUP>Nd systematics were combined in a three-stage model yielding an isochron equation for the lunar mantle formation interval, which was calculated to be 238<SUB>-40</SUB><SUP>+56</SUP> Ma (2σ). Sm/Nd ratios for the source regions also are derived from the model and compare favorably with values from conventional geochemical models of mare basalt petrogenesis. If the Moon were formed by impact of a large, Mars-sized planetesimal with the Earth, the impact was early enough that the lunar mantle cooled to neodymium isotopic closure by ∼4.32 Ga ago. The bulk lunar ∊moon142 evaluated from the mantle isochron at (<SUP>147</SUP>Sm/<SUP>144</SUP>Nd)<SUB>CHUR</SUB> = 0.1967 is -0.01 ± 0.03 (2σ), consistent with derivation of lunar and terrestrial neodymium from a common reservoir.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(95)00175-Y
1979LPSC...10..259T|1979|Lead isotope systematics of three Apollo 17 mare basalts.|Tilton, G. R., Chen, J. H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||259|The paper deals with new and more accurate determinations of uranium, thorium, and isotopic lead data for five bulk samples and separate pyroxene, ilmenite, and plagioclase from basalt 71055. In a concordia diagram, the samples suggest a postcrystallization disturbance of the U-Pb systems of the rock. There is no compelling reason, from U-Pb data, to believe that the moon is younger than 4.55 AE.|
1978LPSC....9.2001C|1978|Regolith depositional history at Shorty Crater.|Crozaz, G.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2001|Nuclear particle track measurements in the 68 cm double drive tube 74002-74001 indicate that the whole core was deposited in one event some 10 m.y. ago. Significant reworking of the soil only occurred down to a few cm from the lunar surface since this event. Complementary investigations in this core by other groups are discussed. Most of the evidence available leads to a two stage model in which the orange and black soils collected at Shorty Crater were first irradiated for approximately 25 m.y. at some depth and then were deposited only a few m.y. ago as an overturned ejecta blanket.|

C.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1981|Isotopic concentrations of noble gases were assessed in grain size separates of 14 soils from a 67-cm section of lunar regolith taken on the rim of Shorty Crater. The orange-black droplets in this section were probably formed from pyroclastic eruptions about 3.6 billion years ago; they give little indication of surface exposure. The isotopic concentrations suggest that cosmic ray irradiation of the core occurred in two stages and that the core stratigraphy was inverted between stages. The first irradiation stage may have taken place immediately after pyroclastic deposition of the droplets and could have lasted about 20 million years.|

L.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||487|Regression and pattern recognition techniques were applied to 16 chemical species in 34 Apollo 17 basalts. The classification scheme of Pratt et al., (1977) was used. Data were absent for 8 MnO, 3 Hf, 3 Tb, and 8 Cr2O3 analyses. Linear regression studies were utilized to predict these and values obtained were added to the original data base. Pattern recognition techniques were then applied to predict classifications for 30 different Apollo 17 rake basalts analyzed by Murali et al., (1977).|
