2015E&PSL.431..195F|2015|Indigenous nitrogen in the Moon: Constraints from coupled nitrogen-noble gas analyses of mare basalts|Füri, Evelyn, Barry, Peter H., Taylor, Lawrence A., Marty, Bernard|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|431||195|Nitrogen and noble gas (Ne-Ar) abundances and isotope ratios, determined by step-wise CO<SUB>2</SUB> laser-extraction, static-mass spectrometry analysis, are reported for bulk fragments and mineral separates of ten lunar mare basalts (10020, 10057, 12008, 14053, 15555, 70255, 71557, 71576, 74255, 74275), one highland breccia (14321), and one ferroan anorthosite (15414). The mare basalt sub-samples 10057,183 and 71576,12 contain a large amount of solar noble gases, whereas neon and argon in all other samples are purely cosmogenic, as shown by their <SUP>21</SUP>Ne/<SUP>22</SUP>Ne ratios of ≈0.85 and <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/<SUP>38</SUP>Ar ratios of ≈0.65. The solar-gas-free basalts contain a two-component mixture of cosmogenic <SUP>15</SUP>N and indigenous nitrogen (<0.5 ppm). Mare basalt 74255 and the olivine fraction of 15555,876 record the smallest proportion of <SUP>15</SUP>N<SUB>cosm</SUB>; therefore, their δ<SUP>15</SUP> N values of -0.2 to + 26.7 ‰ (observed at the low-temperature steps) are thought to well represent the isotopic composition of indigenous lunar nitrogen. However, δ<SUP>15</SUP> N values ≤ - 30 ‰ are found in several basalts, overlapping with the isotopic signature of Earth's primordial mantle or an enstatite chondrite-like impactor. While the lowest δ<SUP>15</SUP> N values allow for nitrogen trapped in the Moon's interior to be inherited from the proto-Earth and/or the impactor, the more <SUP>15</SUP>N-enriched compositions require that carbonaceous chondrites provided nitrogen to the lunar magma ocean prior to the solidification of the crust. Since nitrogen can efficiently be incorporated into mafic minerals (olivine, pyroxene) under oxygen fugacities close to or below the iron-wustite buffer (Li et al., 2013), the mare basalt source region is likely characterized by a high nitrogen storage capacity. In contrast, anorthosite 15414 shows no traces of indigenous nitrogen, suggesting that nitrogen was not efficiently incorporated into the lunar crust during magma ocean differentiation.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2015.09.022

2009GeCoA..73.5884H|2009|Isotopic and elemental abundances of copper and zinc in lunar samples, Zagami, Pele’s hairs, and a terrestrial basalt|Herzog, G. F., Moynier, F., Albarède, F., Berezhnoy, A. A.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|73|19|5884|We used ICP-MS to measure the elemental concentrations and isotopic abundances of Cu and Zn in: nine Ti-rich lunar basalts (10017, 10022, 10024, 10057, 70215, 71055, 74255, 75055, and 75075); size-separated samples prepared by sieving of pyroclastic black glass 74001, orange glass 74022, and the lunar soils 15021, 15231, 70181, and 79221; a basalt from the Piton des Neiges volcano, Reunion Island; two samples of Pele's hairs from the Nyiragongo volcano, Democratic Republic of Congo, and the martian meteorite Zagami. The isotopic fractionation of zinc in lunar basalts and Zagami is mass dependent relative to a terrestrial standard (JMC 400882B). These and published results imply that lunar, terrestrial, meteoritic, and perhaps martian zinc all come from one or more reservoirs linked by mass-dependent fractionation processes. Relative to terrestrial basalts, Ti-rich lunar basalts are enriched in the heavier isotopes of Cu and Zn: we find for Ti-rich lunar basalts the following ranges and averages ±1 - σ (‰): δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu/ <SUP>63</SUP>Cu ≡ δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu, 0.1-1.4, 0.5 ± 0.1‰ ( N = 7); δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn/ <SUP>64</SUP>Zn ≡ δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn = 0.2-1.9, 1.2 ± 0.2‰ ( N = 8; 10017 excluded). For two terrestrial samples, we find δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn ̃ +0.3‰ and δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu ̃ 0‰, which are consistent with published values. The differences between the lunar basalts and terrestrial basalts could reflect minor, planetary-scale vaporization or igneous processes on the Moon. Data for size separates of the pyroclastic glasses 74001 and 74220 confirm the well-known surface correlation of Cu and Zn, but modeling calculations reveal no sharp differences between either the elemental ratios or the isotopic composition of grain interiors and exteriors. The absence of such differences indicates that the isotopic compositions for bulk samples are dominated by a light-isotope-rich surface component. Data for size separates of lunar soils also confirm the surface correlation of Cu and Zn, but an enrichment of heavy rather than light isotopes. Averages for bulk lunar soils from this work and the literature are (‰): δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu, from 1.4 to 4.1, average 3.0 ± 0.3 ( N = 9); δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn, from 2.2 to 6.4, average 4.0 ± 0.3 ( N = 14). As with the glasses, in all but soil 15231 our data show no strong differences between the isotopic composition of soil sub-samples with small and large grains. The size of the isotopic fractionation inferred for the surface component in the soils is 3× smaller than predicted by a published model of sputtering primarily by solar particles. At the same time, the observed fractionation is larger than predicted by calculations based on a model of micrometeorite impact heating and hydrodynamic quenching. Because impact heating appears unable to explain the observations, we conclude that sputtering must be important even though samples with very large isotopic fractionation of Cu and Zn have not yet been found.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2009.05.067
1995GeCoA..59.2817N|1995|<SUP>146</SUP>Sm-<SUP>142</SUP>Nd formation interval for the lunar mantle|Nyquist, L. E., Wiesmann, H., Bansal, B., Shih, C. -Y., Keith, J. E., Harper, C. L.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|59|13|2817|Now-extinct <SUP>146</SUP>Sm (t<SUB>1/2</SUB>= 103Ma) was present in the early solar system, and lunar basalts might be expected to have inherited small anomalies in <SUP>142</SUP>Nd abundances from mantle sources with variable Sm/Nd ratios established during the early global differentiation of the Moon. <SUP>142</SUP>Nd/<SUP>144</SUP>Nd ratios were measured for several lunar basalts, and values of ∊Nd142, (deviations from terrestrial <SUP>142</SUP>Nd/<SUP>144</SUP>Nd in parts in 10<SUP>4</SUP>) calculated for them. The ∊Nd142 values show very small variations attributable to <SUP>146</SUP>Sm decay. Neutron capture near the lunar surface also modified both the samarium and neodymium isotopic compositions of the basalt samples. The calculated neutron fluences range from ̃0 to ̃7.8 × 10<SUP>16</SUP> n/cm<SUP>2</SUP>. Both thermal and epithermal neutron fluences were calculated from the Sm isotopic compositions of the basalts and used to correct the ∊Nd142 values for neutron capture by neodymium. Well-resolved radiogenic enrichments ∊Nd142 and +0.17 ± 0.08 (2σ), respectively, were measured for lunar meteorite Asuka 881757 and Apollo 17 basalt 74255, respectively, for which the neutron fluences were nil. Basalts 70135 and 75075, which were exposed to small, measureable neutron fluences of ̃2.5 × 10<SUP>15</SUP> and ̃7.7 × 10<SUP>15</SUP> n/cm<SUP>2</SUP>, respectively, have neutron-corrected ∊Nd142 values of +0.25± 0.15 and +0.29 ± 0.11, respectively. The average value of radiogenic ∊Nd142 for the three high-Ti basalts from Apollo 17 is +0.22 ± 0.06. Neutron capture effects were greater for the other basalts, but can be corrected using the measured neutron fluences derived from the samarium isotopic data. The neutron-corrected ∊Nd142 for Apollo 12 ilmenite basalt 12056, consistent with its derivation from a highly depleted mantle source also. Three low-Ti basalts from Apollo 12 and Apollo 15 (12038, 15076, 15555), have neutron corrected ∊Nd142 which are not resolved from zero, and average +0.04 ± 0.06. A fourth low-Ti basalt, 12039, has neutron-corrected ∊Nd142, but is subject to the largest neutron correction of ̃0.32 ∊-units. KREEP basalt 14078 was exposed to only a small neutron fluence of ̃6.4 × 10<SUP>15</SUP> n/cm<SUP>2</SUP>, and has a small deficit of <SUP>142</SUP>Nd, corresponding to ∊Nd142. The average neutron-corrected ∊Nd142 of three KREEP basalts is -0.05 ± 0.04. The ∊Nd142 values of the basalts correlate with <SUP>147</SUP>Sm/<SUP>144</SUP>Nd values for their source regions as calculated from their ages and initial ∊Nd142 values. <SUP>147</SUP>Sm- <SUP>143</SUP>Nd and <SUP>146</SUP>Sm- <SUP>142</SUP>Nd systematics were combined in a three-stage model yielding an isochron equation for the lunar mantle formation interval, which was calculated to be 238<SUB>-40</SUB><SUP>+56</SUP> Ma (2σ). Sm/Nd ratios for the source regions also are derived from the model and compare favorably with values from conventional geochemical models of mare basalt petrogenesis. If the Moon were formed by impact of a large, Mars-sized planetesimal with the Earth, the impact was early enough that the lunar mantle cooled to neodymium isotopic closure by ̃4.32 Ga ago. The bulk lunar ∊moon142 evaluated from the mantle isochron at (<SUP>147</SUP>Sm/<SUP>144</SUP>Nd)<SUB>CHUR</SUB> = 0.1967 is -0.01 ± 0.03 (2σ), consistent with derivation of lunar and terrestrial neodymium from a common reservoir.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(95)00175-Y
1977LPSC....8.3059E|1977|The cosmic-ray exposure history of Shorty Crater samples; the age of Shorty Crater.|Eugster, O., Eberhardt, P., Geiss, J., Grögler, N., Jungck, M., Mörgeli, M.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||3059|Noble gases were analyzed in the rocks and soils from the rim of Shorty Crater in the Taurus-Littrow area. The study of the cosmic-ray-produced isotopes He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe in the basaltic rocks 74235, 74255, and 74275, in bulk soil samples from the orange soil 74220, from the gray soils 74241 and 74261, and from the black soil 74001, and in grain size separates from the black soil allows the determination of the cosmic-ray exposure history of these samples. All three rocks experienced at least a two-stage exposure as can be judged from the comparison of their irradiation geometry at the time of collection with that inferred from depth-dependent relative abundances of cosmic-ray-produced nuclei. The exposure histories of the rocks and soils are characterized by four events or periods. These results show that the Shorty impact occurred no more than 30 m.y. ago. The most probable age of this crater is 19 m.y., when the large boulder was excavated from the subfloor. The trapped solar-wind concentration in the black soil is extremely low, on the average only 0.3% of that usually found for lunar soil.|
1975JGR....80.4471H|1975|Micrometeorites and solar flare particles in and out of the ecliptic|Hutcheon, I. D.|Journal of Geophysical Research|80|B32|4471|Using crystals grown into vugs from oriented lunar rocks as directional detectors of cosmic dust particles and solar flare nuclei, I have measured the angular distribution of the flux of micrometeoroids of mass ~3×10<SUP>-17</SUP> to ~8×10<SUP>-14</SUP> g. Hypervelocity impact craters of diameter 500 Å to 10 μm and tracks from solar flare nuclei of energy ~100 keV/amu to ~20 MeV/amu were observed in crystals from rock 71055 facing lunar south and in crystals from rock 74255 facing lunar east. The vug geometry restricts the region of space viewed by the crystal detectors such that only particles streaming nearly normal to the ecliptic could enter the vug from 71055, while only particles confined to the ecliptic could enter the vug from 74255. By comparing the size-frequency distributions and circularity distributions of craters observed on these orthogonal crystals, I have found that dust grains both in ecliptic orbits and in orbits inclined to the ecliptic have virtually identical mass-frequency distributions and similar shapes. I have evaluated the micrometeoroid fluxes after determining the exposure ages of the individual vug crystals by measuring the solar flare track density gradients in each crystal. The flux of particle of mass >4×10<SUP>-15</SUP> g confined to the ecliptic is ~1.1×10<SUP>-2</SUP>/m<SUP>2</SUP> s 2π sr. This value is in good agreement with satellite measurements, suggesting that the micrometeoroid flux has been relatively constant over the past 35,000 yr. The flux of particles producing microcrater on a lunar surface facing south is lower than the ecliptic flux by a factor of ~7. This experiment was unable to distinguish between interstellar dust or interplanetary particles in highly inclined orbits as the source of craters observed on the south-facing surface. The solar flare energy spectra observed in vug crystals from both 71055 and 74255 deviate from the long-term spectrum determined by Hutcheon et al. (1974) at energies below ~10 MeV/amu. I conlude that the shallow energy spectrum cannot be a result of erosion and suggest that the experimental data from which the long-term low-energy Fe spectrum has been derived must be reexamined carefully.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB080i032p04471
