H.|Geophysical Research Letters|10|9|833|Geochemically, ALHA81005 has all the attributes expected of a regolith sample from the lunar highlands. Most important is its Fe/Mn ratio (77), within uncertainty the same as the mean lunar ratio. There are significant differences, however, in comparison to previously sampled lunar regoliths. The closest precedents are the Apollo-16 and Luna-20 regoliths, particularly the latter, but ALHA81005 has lower contents of Na, Ti, and incompatible elements. Feldspathic granulitic breccias such as 72559, which texturally resemble the most abundant type of clast in ALHA81005, are also similar compositionally. From its low KREEP and Na contents we infer ALHA81005 originated well away from the K, Th, and U-rich region near the center of the nearside, at least as far away as the eastern limb.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/GL010i009p00833

C., Miller, J. D., Jr.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||591|Attention is given to the significance of the results of a study of Ca, K, Ti, Fe, Mn, and Mg variations in plagioclase in highlands sample 67915,84. This polymict breccia from Outhouse Rock station 11 at the Apollo 16 site has been selected for study because it contains a wide variety of clast types, including a differentiated type-sodic ferrogabbro. It is found that the data on Ca, K, Ti, Fe, Mn, and Mg in plagioclase show no evidence of reaction between sodic ferrogabbro and breccia matrix clasts. Two groups of plagioclase compositions have been recognized in the breccia matrix. The data suggest that the prebreccia characteristics of plagioclase compositions have been preserved in 67915. Data on Mg/(Mg+FE) ratios suggest that the sodic ferrogabbro and the intermediate-Ca plagioclase clasts could be related to the Mg-rich plutonic rock suite and the high-Ca plagioclase clasts to the ferroan anorthosites.|
