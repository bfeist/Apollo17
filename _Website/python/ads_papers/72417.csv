1980LPSC...11..365J|1980|Rocks of the early lunar crust.|James, O. B.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||365|Data are summarized which suggest a model for the early evolution of the lunar crust. According to the model, during the final stages of accretion, the outer part of the moon melted to form a magma ocean approximately 300 km deep. This ocean fractionated to form mafic and ultramafic cumulates at depth and an overlying anorthositic crust made up of ferroan anorthosites. Subsequent partial melting in the primitive mantle underlying the crystallized magma ocean produced melts which segregated, moved upward, intruded the primordial crust, and crystallized to form layered plutons consisting of Mg-rich plutonic rocks. Intense impact bombardment at the lunar surface mixed and melted the rocks of the two suites to form a thick layer of granulated debris, granulitic breccias, and impact-melt rocks.|
1980LPSC...11..481P|1980|The meteoritic contamination of terrestrial and lunar impact melts and the problem of indigenous siderophiles in the lunar highland.|Palme, H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||481|It is noted that similarities in chemistry and texture between terrestrial and lunar impact melts can be extended to meteoritic elements. The absolute amount of the meteoritic contamination, as well as the observed variations in concentrations of meteoritic elements in the Apollo 17 melt sheet, is comparable to what is observed in some large terrestrial melt sheets. In favorable cases, concentrations of siderophile meteoritic elements in the basement (indigenous component) can be found on the basis of correlations of two meteoritic elements in impact melt samples. Indigenous Ni and Co concentrations found in this way for the Apollo 17 melt are, respectively, 40 + or - 15 ppm Ni and 21.6 + or - 3.5 ppm Co. It is noted that these values are consistent with a chondritic Ni/Co ratio of the projectile.|

T.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||431|The most recent results from a project to find and describe pristine (that is, compositionally endogenous) nonmare rocks are reported. Sixteen nonmare samples are characterized petrographically and by composition, among them numerous key trace elements (siderophiles, incompatibles). Current knowledge about nonmare lunar rocks is surveyed, with emphasis placed on correlations between geochemistry and longitude. Several systematic differences between western ANT (that is, nonKREEPy, nonmare) rocks and the much more thoroughly studied eastern ANT rocks are noted. It is noted that western ANT rocks, whether pristine or nonpristine, tend to have higher Eu/Sm than their eastern counterparts. Pristine western ANT rocks, however, tend to have lower Sc/Sm and Ti/Sm than pristine eastern ANT rocks.|
1979LPSC...10..531N|1979|A summary of the petrology and geochemistry of pristine highlands rocks.|Norman, M. D., Ryder, G.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||531|The petrology and geochemistry of pristine lunar highlands rock samples consisting of ferroan anorthosites, norites, troctolites, spinel troctolites/dunite/lherzolite, and KREEP, are described. In addition, petrographic and chemical evidence is presented which shows that low-siderophile rocks are the result of endogenous igneous activity and not impact melt differentiation. For example, these rocks contain Fe-metal as a late-crystallizing phase, and have W/La ratios higher than polymict breccias.|
1978LPSC....9...83W|1978|Primary matter in the lunar highlands: The case of the siderophile elements.|Waenke, H., Dreibus, G., Palme, H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||83|Most highland breccias of the Apollo 16 mission contain considerable amounts of siderophiles. The Ni/Co ratio of about 17 in these breccias is close to the Cl value of 21.6 and hence a meteoritic origin of these siderophiles is generally assumed. However, the Ni/Co ratio of the earth's mantle of about 18 would give an even closer match. Any reduction process on such terrestrial material would yield a metal almost indistinguishable from meteoritic metal on the basis of the Ni/Co ratio alone. It is argued that the distribution of siderophiles in highland samples is consistent with evidence in favor of the hypothesis that the moon formed from material of the earth's mantle.|

A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1231|The rock selected for the study is one of the rare ultrabasic rocks, which seems to have survived early lunar differentiation. The Rb-Sr internal isochron for this dunite gave an age of about 4.55 AE. The dunite was sampled at Apollo 17, Station 2 from a single 10x20-cm clast incorporated into a KREEP-rich blue-gray breccia 72435, Boulder 3. Nine dunite samples were analyzed with the aid of instrumental and radiochemical neutron activation analysis procedures. Data for 27 elements are shown in a table. Attention is given to trapped liquid (magma), a garnet hypothesis, models for the dunite genesis, and magma compositions from which 15415 and 72417 crystallized.|
