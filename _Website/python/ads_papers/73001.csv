2019AGUFM.P31C3480C|2019|Impact-melt Rock Populations in Apollo Double-drive Tubes|Curran, N., Cohen, B. A.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2019||P31C-3480|The lunar regolith is the boundary between the surface of the Moon and the dynamic space environment. As a result, the regolith preserves an archive of processes that have modified the surface of the Moon over the last ~4 billion years. Of particular interest to us is the impact history of the Moon, preserved as clasts of impact-melted materials created in impact crater events. These clasts date the creation of the impact crater and build a statistical view of the lunar bombardment history. However, the repeated burial, exhumation and transportation (i.e., 'gardening') of the regolith plays a major role in redistributing impact-melt samples. The gardening process may affect the location and preservation of impact-melt rocks in the regolith, which could bias the age distribution of samples collected at the surface. For example, many older (e.g., &gt;3.9 Ga) impact-melt rocks experienced much longer residency in the regolith, potentially being diluted by subsequently-deposited material and making older rocks volumetrically rare at the surface. The opposite may be true for younger impact-melt rocks, particularly if the samples were collected near small, young craters. <P />Double-drive tubes present an opportunity to investigate the age distribution of populations of impact-melt rocks with depth in the regolith and to evaluate the effect of gardening. We have begun this work on Apollo sample 68001/68002. We separated 50-70 particles (250+ Î¼m size fraction) from six compositionally distinct horizons extending to ~70 cm below the surface, including particles from the immediate surface. We grouped the particles from each horizon based on texture, major element, and trace-element, and determined the parent lithology for each group. We will measure the crystallization age (Ar-Ar dating), maturity and cosmic-ray exposure age to understand the regolith history of each particle during its lifetime in the lunar regolith. <P />We will apply these techniques to particles from unopened and unstudied Apollo double-drive tube 73001 as part of the Apollo Next Generation Sample Analysis (ANGSA) Program. Determining the regolith history for these two double-drive tubes will allow direct comparison of the parentage of impact-melt rocks and their exposure histories at the Apollo 16 and Apollo 17 landing site.|
