The conventional (Kr-81)-Kr cosmic-ray exposure ages are 103 + or - 3 m.y. for 71135 and 134 + or - 7 m.y. for 71569. An approach is outlined to deducing complex exposure histories from rare-gas data using depth profiles of the production rates of the cosmogenic rare-gas isotopes. Examination of the Xe isotopes by means of a 'concordia' plot suggests that 71569 may have a simple one-stage exposure history whereas 71135 has a more complex history. An attempt is made to construct exposure models for these two rocks which account for the abundances of all the cosmogenic rare gases, the Xe isotopic compositions, and the apparent (Kr-81)-Kr exposure ages. This study demonstrates the depreciation of (Kr-81)-Kr ages for rocks exposed at shallow depths, caused by the relatively rapid variation of the Kr-81 production as the rock is eroded. Possible implications of the tentative results for the formation age of the Central Cluster unit are discussed.|
