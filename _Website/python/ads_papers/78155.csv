2009PhDT.......253H|2009|Mineralogy, petrology, and chronology of the lunar granulitic breccias|Hudgins, Jillian Amy|Ph.D. Thesis||||Before the return of the Apollo and Luna samples, many basic geological questions about the Moon remained unanswered. The study of returned samples, in addition to remote sensing data and the growing collection of meteorites has revealed that the Moon is a geologically complex body with a history dominated by impact events. Lunar meteorites provide samples of the crust far removed from the Apollo landing sites and are probably more representative of the average lunar crust. SaU 300 was previously misclassified as an anorthositic regolith breccia. Here, I reclassify it as a polymict crystalline impact-melt breccia with an anorthositic norite bulk composition. SaU 300 is a new meteorite that is unpaired with any of the currently known lunar meteorite samples. The main objective of this study was to gain a better understanding of the early evolution of the Moon by studying some of the oldest samples available: the granulitic breccias. The following samples were studied: Apollo samples 60035, 77017, 78155, and 79215 and paired meteorites NWA 3163/4881/4483. Granulitic breccias exhibit poikiloblastic to granoblastic matrix textures and occur as individual rocks and as fragments in impact-melt rocks, the regolith, and in lunar meteorites. These rocks contain 70 -- 80% anorthite, low concentrations of incompatible trace elements, and moderately high concentrations of siderophile elements. Their history was dominated by impact events and thermal metamorphism. Matrix pyroxenes in the granulitic breccias last equilibrated at ∼1050+/-50°C. 40Ar/39Ar data reveal that 60035, 77017, and 78155 have peak metamorphic ages of 4.1 Ga, while 79215 has a peak metamorphic age of 3.9 Ga. NWA 3163 has a peak metamorphic age of 3.3 Ga. Samples 60035, 77017, and NWA 4881 were partially reset by low temperature heating events following metamorphism. Granulitic breccias have been described as "homogeneous on a millimetre scale" throughout the literature. Although they appear to be compositionally homogeneous under petrographic and electron microscopes EMP analysis shows that they retain relic igneous minor and trace element zoning in their larger mafic mineral clasts. Based on the results of this study, I proposed that granulitic breccias form beneath thick, superheated melt sheets associated with impact basins and that they were heated for 104 -- 106 years.|
2008GeCoA..72.5781H|2008|A laser probe <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar and INAA investigation of four Apollo granulitic breccias|Hudgins, Jillian A., Spray, John G., Kelley, Simon P., Korotev, Randy L., Sherlock, Sarah C.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|72|23|5781|Infrared laser probe <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar geochronology, instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and analytical electron microscopy have been performed on four 0.5 × 1.0 × 0.3 cm polished rock tiles of Apollo 16 and 17 granulitic breccias (60035, 77017, 78155, and 79215). Pyroxene thermometry indicates that these samples were re-equilibrated and underwent peak metamorphic sub-solidus recrystallization at 1000-1100 °C, which resulted in homogeneous mineral compositions and granoblastic textures. <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar data from this study reveal that three samples (60035, 77017, and 78155) have peak metamorphic ages of ∼4.1 Ga. Sample 79215 has a peak metamorphic age of 3.9 Ga, which may be related to Serenitatis basin formation. All four samples contain moderately high concentrations of meteoritic siderophiles. Enhanced siderophile contents in three of the samples provide evidence for projectile contamination of their target lithologies occurring prior to peak metamorphism. Post-peak metamorphism, low-temperature (&lt;300 °C) events caused the partial resetting of argon in the two finer-grained granulites (60035 and 77017). These later events did not alter the mineralogy or texture of the rocks, but caused minor brecciation and the partial release of argon from plagioclase. Interpretation of the low-temperature data indicates partial resetting of the argon systematics to as young as 3.2 Ga for 60035 and 2.3 Ga for 77017. Cosmic ray exposure ages range from 6.4 to ∼339 Ma. Our results increase the amount of high-precision data available for the granulitic breccias and lunar highlands crustal samples. The results demonstrate the survival of pre-Nectarian material on the lunar surface and document the effects of contact metamorphic and impact processes during the pre-Nectarian Epoch, as well as the low-temperature partial resetting of ages by smaller impact events after 3.9 Ga. The mineralogy and chemical composition of these rocks, as well as exhumation constraints, indicate that the source of heat for metamorphism was within kilometers of the surface via burial beneath impact-melt sheets or hot ejecta blankets.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2008.08.024

1986JGR....91D.263L|1986|Lunar granulites and their precursor anorthositic norites of the early lunar crust|Lindstrom, Marilyn M., Lindstrom, David J.|Journal of Geophysical Research|91|B4|D263|Lunar granulites are breccias with metamorphic textures. They are not pristine, having been contaminated with meteoritic siderophiles. Nonetheless, they constitute an abundant class of highlands rocks that are important because they are ancient and KREEP-free. They may represent our best samples of the early lunar crust. The granulites can be divided into ferroan and magnesian groups, and each group can be subdivided on the basis of mineral composition and REE concentrations. Textural and compositional data show that some of the granulites (especially 67215 and 67415) may be derived from distinct anorthositic norite precursors, while some other granulites (79215, 78155) are clearly polymict. Even the polymict granulites probably had anorthositic norites as their dominant precursors, and not anorthosites, norites, or troctolites. The granulites have compositions similar to those of the two lunar meteorites, one of which (Yamato-791197) is ferroan, the other (ALHA81005) magnesian. These meteorites are soil breccias from an unknown location distant from the Apollo landing sites and contain anorthositic norites as abundant clasts. Compositions of granulites and lunar meteorites more closely resemble the average composition of lunar highlands, as determined by remote sensing, than do those of any other returned lunar samples. The predominance of plutonic anorthositic norite precursors in material having the composition typical of highlands suggests that plutonic anorthositic norites were more abundant in the early lunar crust than is implied by their scarcity among pristine rocks from Apollo missions.|

1983LPSC...13..887L|1983|A Two-Pyroxene Thermometer|Lindsley, D. H., Andersen, D. J.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|88||887|Experimentally determined pyroxene phase relations at 800°-1200°C are combined with calculated phase equilibria for the Di-En and Hd-Fs joins to produce a graphical two-pyroxene thermometer that should be applicable to a wide variety of rocks from the earth, moon, and meteorites. The thermometer can be used directly with natural pyroxenes that have low contents of Al and other minor components. Samples with higher contents of ‘others’ components require special projection onto the Ca-Mg-Fe pyroxene quadrilateral; Wo, En, and Fs as normally calculated will not yield correct temperatures! The special projection is necessary to approximate the activities of those components in natural pyroxenes. The effects of pressure are nonnegligible but can be corrected for. Use of the thermometer for slowly-cooled rocks may pose special problems if the pyroxenes have undergone granule exsolution (coalescence of exsolved material to form separate grains). For example, published analyses of Mg-rich augites from the Skaergaard intrusion give temperatures that are 50°-100°C below expected magmatic values. Textural and experimental evidence confirms that these augites have undergone granule exsolution. The primary pyroxene compositions must be reconstructed from textural evidence before correct igneous or peak-metamorphic temperatures can be obtained from this or any two-pyroxene thermometer. Of the numerous two-pyroxene thermometers proposed in the literature, those of Ross and Huebner [1975] and of Kretz [1982] Ca-reaction] yield temperatures most similar to our own, although the former tends to give temperatures about 50°C lower for some igneous pyroxenes. Other thermometers generally overestimate temperatures for metamorphic rocks (hornblende granulite facies) by 50°-100°C.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB088iS02p0A887

1980LPSC...11..365J|1980|Rocks of the early lunar crust.|James, O. B.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||365|Data are summarized which suggest a model for the early evolution of the lunar crust. According to the model, during the final stages of accretion, the outer part of the moon melted to form a magma ocean approximately 300 km deep. This ocean fractionated to form mafic and ultramafic cumulates at depth and an overlying anorthositic crust made up of ferroan anorthosites. Subsequent partial melting in the primitive mantle underlying the crystallized magma ocean produced melts which segregated, moved upward, intruded the primordial crust, and crystallized to form layered plutons consisting of Mg-rich plutonic rocks. Intense impact bombardment at the lunar surface mixed and melted the rocks of the two suites to form a thick layer of granulated debris, granulitic breccias, and impact-melt rocks.|

H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||493|It is noted that the partitioning of Fe(2+) and Mg between olivine and ilmenite is temperature-dependent and can serve as a geothermometer if the activity-composition relations are determined. The paper reports on the study of the partitioning from 700-980 C at 1 kbar and 800-900 C at 13 kbar, and develops a solution model to account for the nonideality of olivine in the binary system fosterite-fayalite and for ilmenite in the ternary system ilmenite-geikielite-hematite. A comparison with crystallization experiments shows that this thermometer may be safely extrapolated to temperatures higher than those of the exchange experiments.|

J.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1269|Data for 35 major, minor, and trace elements in 40 bulk and size fractions of core 70005-70003 (140-250 cm) are presented. The core is heterogeneous with depth. Moreover, the 1000 to 90 micron coarse fractions are nearly identical but quite different from the less than 20 micron fine fraction. The bulk soil chemistry is governed by the coarse fractions, because of their greater weight proportion in the sample. The 1000-90 micron fraction contains more ilmenite basalt and less orange glass components than the 90-20 micron fraction. The less than 20 micron fraction is consistently enriched in highland material at all depths in the drill core.|
