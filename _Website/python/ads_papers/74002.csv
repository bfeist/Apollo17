2014Icar..229..109F|2014|New evidence for chondritic lunar water from combined D/H and noble gas analyses of single Apollo 17 volcanic glasses|Füri, Evelyn, Deloule, Etienne, Gurenko, Andrey, Marty, Bernard|Icarus|229||109|In order to assess the proportion of solar, cosmogenic, and indigenous water (hydrogen) trapped in individual Ti-rich lunar volcanic glasses (LVGs) from the 74002 core obtained during the Apollo 17 mission, we coupled ion microprobe measurements of water abundances and D/H ratios with CO<SUB>2</SUB> laser extraction-static mass spectrometry analyses of noble gases (He, Ne, Ar). The large (∼300-400 μm in diameter) LVGs studied here contain a small amount of solar wind (SW) volatiles implanted at the grain surfaces, as indicated by the small concentrations of solar helium and neon that represent ⩽5% of the respective total noble gas abundances. The large proportion of volume-correlated cosmogenic gases reflects an exposure duration of ∼28 Ma, on average, of the glasses at the lunar surface. Hydrogen abundances determined in the grain interiors of glassy and partially-crystalline LVGs are equivalent to between 6.5 and 54.3 ppm H<SUB>2</SUB>O. Based on the noble gas exposure ages, the correction of the measured hydrogen isotope composition for in situ production of cosmogenic deuterium by spallation reactions varies between -5‰ to -254‰ for the different grains. Corrected δD values range from +38‰ to +809‰ in the LVGs and are anti-correlated with the water content, consistent with extensive hydrogen isotope fractionation during kinetic H<SUB>2</SUB> loss from a lunar melt with an inferred initial isotope signature of the order of -100‰ and a water content of 100-300 ppm. The detection of water in these primitive lunar melts confirms the presence of a non-anhydrous mantle reservoir within the Moon. Furthermore, our results reveal that the hydrogen isotope composition of water in the melt source of the 74002 LVGs is similar to that of carbonaceous chondrites. These observations indicate that the contribution of deuterium-enriched cometary water to the Earth-Moon system is negligible.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2013.10.029

S., Marti, K.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|21||291|Trapped N in the black/orange glass at different levels of the 74001/74002 double-drive tube can be used to address two questions: the isotopic composition of indigenous N exhaled from the lunar interior 3.7 Ga ago; and the nature of extralunar N incident upon the lunar surface during the same epoch. Indigenous lunar N is found to have the same δ<SUP>15</SUP>N value as N in terrestrial mantle samples with high <SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He ratios. This suggests that the lunar interior and the terrestrial mantle acquired their N, and possibly other volatiles, from a common nebular reservoir. The ancient extralunar N reveals evidence for a <SUP>15</SUP>N-enriched component present on the lunar surface 3.7 Ga ago, together with <SUP>15</SUP>N-depleted N. However, the role of these components, for neither of which a solar origin can be excluded, in explaining the long-term increase in <SUP>15</SUP>N/<SUP>14</SUP>N ratio of regolith N on the Moon is not yet clear.|

R.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|88||B211|Mn-53 data are presented for four Apollo cores with an emphasis on the past 10-to-the-7th-year history of these samples: (1) Core 15011 has excess Mn-53 down to a depth of at least 9 cm, which is probably due to the continuous addition of near-surface irradiated material. (2) The Mn-53 profile for 64002 above 12 cm is relatively flat and in excess of that calculated for a static core, which suggests that the upper part of this core was deposited rapidly about 2 m.y. ago. (3) Results for the Apollo 17 drill stem show a large excess of Mn-53 from at least 3 cm downwards. Some magnetic separates obtained from this core have very high Mn-53 activities, probably due to the presence of agglutinates that were recently irradiated very near the surface. (4) The Mn-53 content of the upper part of 74002 is similar to that of trench samples collected nearby and indicates that the gray, orange, and black soils at this site have been exposed together near the surface for at least the last 10 m.y.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB088iS01p0B211

E.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|47|3|491|The sulphur contents and δ<SUP>34</SUP>S values have been determined for the bulk and various grain size fractions of three 74002/1 lunar drive tube samples. The sulphur contents of the bulk samples ate much lower than those of other lunar soils. These samples, along with the surface orange soil 74220 analysed previously, show an increase of sulphur concentration with decreasing particle size which is more marked than for other soils and indicates that the orange and black glass droplets have a coating enriched in sulphur and other volatile elements. In sharp contrast with other soils, the orange and black glasses have slight positive δ<SUP>34</SUP>S values for large particles while the smallest particle sizes show negative δ<SUP>34</SUP>S values. This indicates that the coating of the glassy droplets is enriched in isotopically light sulphur. These observations favour the theory that the orange and black glasses were generated by a volcanic fire fountain. The anomalously high δ<SUP>34</SUP>S values of the fine fractions of the core bottom sample, 74001-135, combined with the results of an acid leaching experiment, indicate that these fractions are contaminated, possibly by a mature soil of high sulphur content and relatively positive δ<SUP>34</SUP>S value.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(83)90271-5

He, Ne, Ar and solar flare tracks are measured on plagioclase separates of 12 surface soils and two Apollo 15 drill core samples, and track density histograms are compared with gas concentration distributions obtained from aliquot samples. Results show that solar wind Ar is probably well retained in all minerals. He, Ne, and Ar are not saturated macroscopically, and semi-microscopic or microscopic saturation is very rare for Ar, even in gas-rich plagioclase populations. All grains contain trapped noble gases, even in relatively gas-poor mineral populations, and for clean minerals in the size range of 150-200 microns, the time between the first and last surface exposure is in the order of 10 to the 7th to 10 to the 8th years.|

It is concluded from the measured Au/Ir ratios and from the absence of a surface enrichment of Co that the material in the drive tube 74001/2 is not the result of an impact of an iron meteorite into a lava lake, but originated in at least three volcanic eruptions. No indication of a later disturbance of the stratigraphy of the layers is observed. Exposure ages of 345,000 and 225,000 years result from Ir deposits for the two layers of 74002.|

A new laboratory arrangement was developed to obtain these images. Data processing and initial data analysis for core section 74002 were performed. The images are sensitive to variations in mineralogy and/or maturity of the soil and are easily used (1) in stratigraphic studies of the lunar regolith, (2) for sample selection of representative material, and (3) as ground truth for remote sensing studies.|

W., Jr.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1425|The concentrations of Hg released at at the most 130 C increase with depth in near-surface samples from cores. This is in response to a daytime thermal gradient with temperatures of approximately 400 K at the surface decreasing to approximately 250 K at greater than 10 cm depth (Keihm and Langseth, 1973). The steepness of the slopes and the depths to which the concentration gradients extend appear to be determined by the color, density and possibly the grain size of the soils. Earlier surface layers can be identified and, in general, are in agreement with other indicators of such layers. Low temperature volatilized Br exhibits trends that parallel those of Hg in a number of cases. This is also true of Br and Hg fractions released in stepwise heating experiments at higher temperatures. The coherence, especially in higher temperature fractions, between these chemically dissimilar elements implies a common physical process of entrapment; possibly one related to the presence of vapor deposits on surfaces and to opening and closing of microcracks and pores.|

SAM analyses show that the most dominant volatiles in the top few atomic layers of droplets are Zn and S, confirming that the surface Zn and S are good indicators of pyroclastic origin, and they are not entirely present as ZnS. In addition, FLAA thermal release profiles show that almost all the Zn and Cd are on grain surfaces, indicating that Zn and Cd were completely outgassed from lava fountain products during the volcanic eruption, were recondensed during or after the eruptions, and are thus present as surface coating.|

A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||327|Eight siderophile elements, seven volatile elements, and U were determined in three samples from 74001 by radiochemical neutron activation analysis. The siderophile pattern closely corresponds to the addition of approximately 0.1% of II B iron meteorites, and the enrichment of nonsiderophile volatile elements seems to be derived from lunar sources with variation generally following Se content. In addition, in 74001 (predominantly black glass), moderately volatile elements (Ag, Zn) are more abundant than In, Cd, and particularly Bi, while in 74220 (mainly orange glass), Ag, Zn, In, and Cd are almost equally abundant, but Bi is as low as in 74001.|

S., Waits, G., Fuhrman, R.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1945|SEM-EDX analysis of the surface morphology of the 74001 and 74002 orange and black glassy droplets has revealed the presence of ubiquitous micromound coatings. Assuming that the diameter of an individual micromound is an indication of total coating thickness, then the thickness of this volatile and metal-rich layer ranges from less than 20 A to over 300 A in thickness. On rare droplets the micromound coating is partially covered by a sparse population of crystals and masses that are essentially NaCl in composition. Additionally, an irregular mass on the surface of one black droplet may contain free sulfur. Amoeboid masses of iron, some with incipient crystal faces, are also present on a few droplet surfaces. The above features, i.e., halite crystals, sulfur-rich masses and amoeboid iron, are rare; the more common occurrence of metals and volatiles is in the micromound coating. Based on our observations of several hundred spheres from both Apollo and Luna missions, the classic micromound coating is unique to the Apollo 15 green and Apollo 17 orange and black droplets. Although some investigators have proposed various impact sequences to produce these unique droplets, the volcanic fire fountain origin is favored.|

C.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1875|Particle track density frequency distributions, abundance of track rich grains and minimum track densities are reported for the upper 20 cm of the 60002 section of the Apollo 16 deep drill core. The principal stratigraphic feature is a boundary approximately 7 cm from the top of the section. Experimental evidence does not conclusively determine whether this contact is an ancient regolith surface or is simply a depositional boundary. If it is an ancient surface, it has a model exposure age of 3 to 7 million years and a reworking depth of about 0.5 cm. However, because track density frequency distributions indicate the mixing of soils of different maturities, we favor interpreting this contact as a depositional boundary. There may be a second depositional boundary approximately 19 cm below the top of 60002.|

An exposure history of the core is proposed: accumulation (about 3.6 billion years ago), shallow burial (during the first 20 million years), deep burial (till about 10-15 million years ago), followed by excavation (10-15 million years ago), and in situ reworking (till the present).|

W.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2019|Measurements of the Al-26 and Mn-53 in interior portions of lunar rocks have shown that lunar surface processes which move a significant fraction of kilogram size rocks on the lunar surface occur on time scales of a few million years. These measurements, together with noble gas age dating have made it possible to define the history for nine rock samples selected from whole rock counting data because of anomalously low Al-26 relative to Na-22. Six of the rocks from the Apollo 15 and 16 missions showed evidence of movement during the past five million years. Of these six, only two are of an age consistent with their origin from the South Ray Crater Event. In addition, our measurements of Na-22 and Al-26 in Apollo 17 double drive tube 74001-74002 suggest that one to two cm of soil is missing from the top of this core tube. Even with this loss, at least two cm of gardening is indicated in the top portion of 74002.|

V.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1801|The in situ reworking (gardening) of the lunar surface by impacting projectiles creates an in situ reworking zone extending horizontally over the entire regolith surface and extending vertically from the surface to a depth which varies from place-to-place on the moon. On the basis of available evidence, the 'high-maturity' zones observed at the top of the lunar cores have resulted from the in situ reworking of the present-day lunar surface. The temporal variation of the in situ reworking depth was investigated using depths inferred from maturity I<SUB>s/FeO</SUB> and Al-26 profiles of Apollo cores. The observed temporal variation of the in situ reworking depth in units of centimeters is equal to 2.2 times the time (in units of million years) to the 0.45th power.|

Significant reworking of the soil only occurred down to a few cm from the lunar surface since this event. Complementary investigations in this core by other groups are discussed. Most of the evidence available leads to a two stage model in which the orange and black soils collected at Shorty Crater were first irradiated for approximately 25 m.y. at some depth and then were deposited only a few m.y. ago as an overturned ejecta blanket.|

The samples, taken from the core section below 5.5 cm and representing most of the major stratigraphic units described by Nagle (1978), consist entirely of whole and fragmented orange and black droplets. The grain shape, degree of crystallinity, breakage, vesicularity, predominant olivine shapes, and phenocryst content of about 18,000 droplets were investigated. The crystalline droplets were found to contain olivine and ilmenite as major phases and pyroxene, Cr-spinel and metallic Fe as minor phases. The grain shape, degree of crystallization, olivine shape and olivine composition suggest that a wide range of cooling rates is represented. The upper part of the core section (above 5.5 cm) has undergone in situ reworking by micrometeorites. The 74001/2 samples are believed to be from an ultramafic pyroclastic deposit brought to the surface by the Shorty Crater impact and originally formed by a lava fountain active in the Taurus-Littrow valley 3.5 b.y. ago. The sequence represented in the sample was most likely deposited over a very short period of time.|

The FLAA and XPS investigations show volatile trace metal enrichment in smaller grain fractions (broken droplets); thus a part of the volatiles was probably deposited after break-up of the droplets. In addition, redistribution of the volatiles by a cratering event is indicated by continuous decreases in Pb and Cd with core depth. Studies of Zn on individual regolith grains are also reported.|

C.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1981|Isotopic concentrations of noble gases were assessed in grain size separates of 14 soils from a 67-cm section of lunar regolith taken on the rim of Shorty Crater. The orange-black droplets in this section were probably formed from pyroclastic eruptions about 3.6 billion years ago; they give little indication of surface exposure. The isotopic concentrations suggest that cosmic ray irradiation of the core occurred in two stages and that the core stratigraphy was inverted between stages. The first irradiation stage may have taken place immediately after pyroclastic deposition of the droplets and could have lasted about 20 million years.|

Bulk soils and the 90-150 micrometer and less than 20 micrometer size fractions of 13 soils from the core for both major and trace elements by instrumental neutron activation analysis were analyzed. The orange and black glassy soils in the core 74001/2 are homogeneous in composition and due to their unusual compositional characteristics probably have derived from a single source with the same composition. The top of the core has been reworked to a depth of about 5 cm. The reworked layer is marked by compositional differences in the first 3 cm which reflect the addition (at least 10%) of materials including mare basalt and a CaO-rich component. The maturity profile (I<SUB>s/FeO)</SUB> clearly indicates reworking depth of about 5 cm. It is likely that at least some of the ferro-magnetically active component (including agglutinitic glass) has been 'inherited' with the added material.|
