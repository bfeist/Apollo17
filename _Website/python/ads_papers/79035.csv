2009GeCoA..73.3038H|2009|Two oxygen isotopic components with extra-selenial origins observed among lunar metallic grains - In search for the solar wind component|Hashizume, Ko, Chaussidon, Marc|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|73|10|3038|Oxygen isotopic analyses were performed in the surface layers of lunar metallic grains from lunar regolith samples 71501 and 79035, presumably exposed at the Moon surface at different times. We were able to reproduce the two extreme O components previously found [Hashizume K. and Chaussidon M. (2005) A non-terrestrial <SUP>16</SUP>O-rich isotopic composition for the protosolar nebula. Nature434, 619-622; Ireland T. R., Holden P., Norman M. D. and Clarke J. (2006) Isotopic enhancements of <SUP>17</SUP>O and <SUP>18</SUP>O from solar wind particles in the lunar regolith. Nature440, 776-778], with a range observed of -12 ± 5 < ∆ <SUP>17</SUP>O < +33 ± 3‰ (1 σ). The relatively minor <SUP>16</SUP>O-rich component corresponding to an end-member ∆ <SUP>17</SUP>O value lower than -20‰ is likely the solar component. This comes from the fact that its concentration roughly agrees with the maximum solar wind abundance expected among the grains from the two samples. At variance the <SUP>16</SUP>O-poor component is 5-10 times more abundant and thus likely non-solar. The δ <SUP>18</SUP>O range found for the <SUP>16</SUP>O-poor component may reflect various processes such as isotope exchange reaction during oxidation of metallic iron and/or isotope fractionation by evaporation/condensation at the surface of the Moon or during implantation at depth in the lunar metallic grains. The present study suggests that planetary solid materials in bulk are systematically depleted in <SUP>16</SUP>O relative to the solar isotopic composition, suggesting the existence of non-mass-dependent isotopic fractionations associated to the formation of solids in the accretion disk.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2009.02.024
2003ApJ...597..602H|2003|Helium in Lunar Samples Analyzed by High-Resolution Stepwise Etching: Implications for the Temporal Constancy of Solar Wind Isotopic Composition|Heber, Veronika S., Baur, Heinrich, Wieler, Rainer|The Astrophysical Journal|597|1|602|The <SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He ratio in the present and past solar wind (SW) is of interest because it provides an estimate for the protosolar deuterium abundance. SW He and Ne composition has been analyzed in ilmenites of lunar soils (71501, 12001, 74241) and regolith breccias (79135, 79035, 14301) by closed system stepwise etching. The samples have SW antiquities ranging from ~0.1 to ~3.7 Gyr. The experiments have a very high depth resolution; thus, possible artifacts that may compromise the precise determination of the SW composition can be controlled. The nominal average (<SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He)<SUB>SW</SUB> ratios correlate with the SW antiquity, suggesting at first glance a (<SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He)<SUB>SW</SUB> increase of 6% per Gyr. In addition, also the (<SUP>20</SUP>Ne/<SUP>22</SUP>Ne)<SUB>SW</SUB> ratio seems to have increased with time by about 2% per Gyr. However, there are reasons indicating that the apparent temporal increase of (<SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He)<SUB>SW</SUB> is an artifact. First, there is no straightforward explanation for a concurrent temporal change of (<SUP>20</SUP>Ne/<SUP>22</SUP>Ne)<SUB>SW</SUB> to the extent observed. Second, the average nominal (<SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He)<SUB>SW</SUB> and (<SUP>20</SUP>Ne/<SUP>22</SUP>Ne)<SUB>SW</SUB> ratios correlate with each other, and this correlation parallels the one displayed by the single etch steps, indicating a progressive admixture of the deeper sited, isotopically heavier solar energetic particles with ongoing etching. We suggest that the nominal temporal variation of (<SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He)<SUB>SW</SUB> and (<SUP>20</SUP>Ne/<SUP>22</SUP>Ne)<SUB>SW</SUB> is the result of secondary processes that cause erosion of the outermost layers of the regolith grains and thus a partial removal of the very surface-sited SW. Correcting this partial grain surface loss, assuming a constant SW Ne isotopic composition throughout the Sun's lifetime, leads to constant (<SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He)<SUB>SW</SUB> at (4.47+/-0.13)×10<SUP>-4</SUP> within the last ~4 Gyr. The results suggest that the present-day (<SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He)<SUB>SW</SUB> can directly be used to deduce the protosolar (D+<SUP>3</SUP>He)/<SUP>4</SUP>He composition and that a possible mixing between radiative interior and convective zone must be restricted to a thin boundary layer.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/378402
2002E&PSL.202..201H|2002|Analyses of nitrogen and argon in single lunar grains: towards a quantification of the asteroidal contribution to planetary surfaces|Hashizume, Ko, Marty, Bernard, Wieler, Rainer|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|202|2|201|We performed nitrogen and argon isotopic analyses in single 200-μm-sized ilmenite grains of lunar regolith samples 71501, 79035 and 79135. Cosmogenic and trapped components were discriminated using stepwise heating with a power-controlled CO <SUB>2</SUB> laser. Cosmogenic <SUP>15</SUP>N and <SUP>38</SUP>Ar correlate among different ilmenite grains, yielding a mean <SUP>15</SUP>N <SUB>c</SUB>/ <SUP>38</SUP>Ar <SUB>c</SUB> production ratio of 14.4±1.0 atoms/atom. This yields a <SUP>15</SUP>N production rate in bulk lunar samples of 3.8-5.6 pg (g rock) <SUP>-1</SUP> Ma <SUP>-1</SUP>, which agrees well with previous estimates. The trapped δ <SUP>15</SUP>N values show large variations (up to 300‰) among different grains of a given soil, reflecting complex histories of mixing between different end-members. The <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>14</SUP>N ratio, which is expected to increase with increasing contribution of solar ions, varies from 0.007 to 0.44 times the solar abundance ratio. The trapped δ <SUP>15</SUP>N values correlate roughly with the <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>14</SUP>N ratios from a non-solar end-member characterized by a <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>14</SUP>N ratio close to 0 and variable but generally positive δ <SUP>15</SUP>N values, to lower δ <SUP>15</SUP>N values accompanied by increasing <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>14</SUP>N ratios, supporting the claim of Hashizume et al. (2000) that solar nitrogen is largely depleted in <SUP>15</SUP>N relative to meteoritic or terrestrial nitrogen. Nevertheless, the <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>14</SUP>N ratio of the <SUP>15</SUP>N-depleted (solar) end-member is lower than the solar abundance ratio by a factor of 2.5-5. We explain this by a reprocessing of implanted solar wind atoms, during which part of the chemically inert rare gases were lost. We estimate that the flux of non-solar N necessary to account for the observed δ <SUP>15</SUP>N values is comparable to the flux of micrometeorites and interplanetary dust particles estimated for the Earth. Hence we propose that the variations in δ <SUP>15</SUP>N values observed in lunar regolith can be simply explained by mixing between solar wind contributions and micrometeoritic ones infalling on the Moon. Temporal variations of δ <SUP>15</SUP>N values among samples of different antiquities could be due to changes in the micrometeoritic flux through time, in which case such flux has increased by up to an order of magnitude during the last 0.5 Ga.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0012-821X(02)00781-1

J.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|63|13|2145|We have applied a stepwise pyrolytic extraction technique to eleven individual lunar regolith grains to investigate the compositions of light noble gases embedded in grain surfaces by solar wind irradiation, with emphasis on the rather poorly known isotopic composition of solar-wind argon. Results are intriguing: average <SUP>20</SUP>Ne/ <SUP>22</SUP>Ne ratios observed in early pyrolytic releases from ilmenite grains separated from lunar soils 71501, 79035 and 10084 agree very well with both direct measures of the solar wind neon composition in the Apollo foils and with values obtained in first releases from acid-etched ilmenites by the Zürich laboratory, whereas these same pyrolytic and acid-etch fractions carry argon isotopic signatures that significantly disagree - average <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>38</SUP>Ar ratios near 5.8 for thermal extraction compared to 5.4-5.5 for chemical etching at Zürich. Consideration of the isotopic and elemental data from these grains in the context of first-order diffusive modeling calculations points to gas release at low temperatures, without significant isotopic or elemental fractionation, from isolated grain-surface reservoirs of solar wind composition. The physical nature of these reservoirs is presently unknown. In this interpretation the preferred solar wind <SUP>20</SUP>Ne/ <SUP>22</SUP>Ne and <SUP>21</SUP>Ne/ <SUP>22</SUP>Ne ratios deduced from this study are respectively 13.81 ± 0.08 and 0.0333 ± 0.0003, both within error of the Zürich acid-etch values, and <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>38</SUP>Ar = 5.77 ± 0.08. It may be possible to reconcile the discrepancy between the acid-etch and pyrolytic estimates for the solar wind <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>38</SUP>Ar ratio in the context of arguments originally advanced by Benkert et al. (1993) to account for their He and Ne isotopic compositions. At the other, high-temperature end of the release profile from one of these grains there are clear isotopic indications of the presence of a Ne constituent with <SUP>20</SUP>Ne/ <SUP>22</SUP>Ne close to the 11.2 ratio found at Zürich and attributed by these workers to a deeply-sited component implanted by solar energetic particles.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00002-2
1995GeCoA..59.4983R|1995|Noble gases and nitrogen released from lunar soils by acid etching|Rider, Paul E., Pepin, Robert O., Becker, Richard H.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|59|23|4983|A stepwise acid-etching technique similar to the closed system stepwise etching (CSSE) method developed at ETH Zurich was used to examine the solar wind reservoirs of lunar soil grains. Samples were treated with weak acids (H <SUB>2</SUB>O, H <SUB>2</SUB>SO <SUB>3</SUB>) to facilitate the release of the most shallowly implanted gases. Noble gas abundances and isotopic compositions, including Kr and Xe in some cases, and a few nitrogen data were obtained for mineral or grain-size separates of three lunar soils (plagioclase from 60051, pyroxene from 75081, and <25 ym bulk 79035). The 60051 plagioclase grains, considered to be a possibly unique resource for determining the modern-day solar wind composition, show unusually low contents of solar wind He, Ne, and particularly Ar, but do not otherwise possess any characteristics clearly attributable to a modem-day solar wind exposure. Initial water and acid treatments of the grains, however, release an apparently pure SEP component. The 75081 pyroxene and the size separate of bulk 79035 both yield Kr and Xe compositions in initial etch steps that are characteristic of undiffused solar wind, significantly increasing the database for measurements of solar wind Kr and Xe where possible laboratory thermal diffusion and fractionation effects are not a concern. Pyroxene in particular appears to be a suitable alternative to ilmenite for the purpose of making measurements of this kind. Nitrogen release by acid etching is not at present quantitative, and while it appears possible to obtain reasonable isotopic ratios for solar wind N, we are unable to use the technique to determine solar nitrogen to noble gas ratios. Light noble gases in all three soil separates, other than the aforementioned behavior of 60051, appear to behave in accord with expectations based on acid-etching analyses performed by the Züirich group.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(95)00323-1

T.|Meteoritics|29||718|High resolution stepped combustion is used to release isotopically distinct N components of different thermal stability in lunar soil 12023. The isotopically light gas in this soil appears to be the same as that found in the lunar breccia 79035, but the latter material has little of an isotopically heavy component of only slightly lower thermal stability. Complex grains in 12023, which probably only release their N on melting, contain a mixture of the heavy and light N in approximately the same proportions as the unaggregated soil. Ideas that require complex grains to be enriched in a light-N component, synonymous with the ancient solar wind, therefore, cannot be correct. The implications for models invoking solar-wind secular variation are discussed.|
1994Metic..29..632P|1994|On Unfractionated Solar Noble Gases in the H3-6 ACFER 111|Pedroni, A., Begemann, F.|Meteoritics|29||632|Solar noble gases He, Ne, Ar and Kr implanted in the H3-6 meteorite regolith breccia Acfer 111 agree in their elemental composition with that in present-day solar wind and, except for a 25% deficit of He-4, also with adopted solar abundances. The presence of such unfractionated solar gases makes Acfer 111 unique (until now). Closed system stepped etching releases noble gases that can be explained as mixtures of two distinct types of He, Ne, and Kr of isotopic compositions as they have been derived previously from meteorites and lunar samples that contain heavily fractionated solar gases. Since the same putative end members, ascribed to the solar wind (SW) and supra-thermal solar energetic particles (SEP), are also present in Acfer 111, we argue that these end members represent two truly independent components. We discount the possibility that one isotopic composition derived from the other by diffusion of the gases within, or upon their release from, their host phases. The isotopic signatures of noble gases in Acfer 111 agree with those in a lunar ilmenite of young antiquity approximately equals 100 Ma) but are in disagreement with the noble gases in lunar ilmenite 79035 of 1-2 Ga natiquity. Systematic changes are discussed of the nuclide abundance ratios as etching proceeds; they are ascribed to differences in trapping efficiency and in penetration depth of the different noble gas ion species upon their implanation.|

J.|Meteoritics|29||662|Helium and neon were extracted from individual lunar ilmenite grains, approximately 100 micrometers in diameter, using a pulsed step-heating technique. Grains from lunar samples 71501 and 79035, believed to have been exposed to solar corpuscular radiation at greatly different times, were studied. The results found were consistent with the hypothesis that in addition to solar-wind-implanted gas, a second more deeply implanted component was present in both species of grains. Average isotopic ratios were determined giving equal weight to each of the particles. As found in depth studies employing chemical etching, both the He-3/He-4 and Ne-20/Ne-22 ratios were lower in the more deeply implanted gas than in the solar wind component. The He-3/He-4 ratio in the solar wind component of the more ancient grains was lower than that in the more recently exposed ones, whereas no difference was found for the more deeply embedded He. In the deeply embedded component of the ancient grains, the He-4/Ne-20 ratio was approx. 2x that found in the more recently exposed grains. In the shallowly implanted component, the ratio varied greatly from grain to grain, preventing comparison with the solar wind elemental composition.|

H., Jr., Hohenberg, C. M., Olinger, C. T.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|58|2|1031|Solar implanted helium, neon, and argon were extracted from individual ilmenite grains from lunar soil 71501 and soil breccia 79035 using laser vaporization and analyzed by static mass spectrometry. Clear differences were observed for these two grain populations, one from a contemporary soil and the other from an ancient soil exposed on the lunar surface approximately 1 Ga ago. The different trends between the <SUP>20</SUP>Ne /<SUP>22</SUP>Ne ratios and the He/Ne ratios do not simply reflect differences either in regolith gardening or in diffusive losses but rather suggest a greater relative helium abundance in the ancient solar wind by a factor of about 1.8. The majority of the grains are enriched in solar energetic particle (SEP) Ne relative to solar wind (SW) Ne in a manner that increases with surface exposure. The progressive enrichment in retained SEP Ne relative to SW Ne is explained by a combination of diffusion and nonfractionating losses of the less deeply implanted SW component. The neon isotopic differences observed in various analyses of ilmenite separates from these two soils and previously attributed to a secular variation of either the SW/SEP flux ratio or the SW Ne isotopic composition may alternatively be a natural consequence of greater SW losses which accompany an enhanced helium flux in the ancient solar wind.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(94)90524-X
1993Metic..28Q.412N|1993|Extraction of He and NE from Individual Lunar Ilmenite Grains by Pulse Heating|Nier, A. O., Schlutter, D. J.|Meteoritics|28|3|412|The pulse-heating technique employed for extracting helium and neon from individual interplanetary dust particles [1] has been extended to a similar study of individual lunar grains. A succession of 5-s constant power pulses is applied to the oven holding the particle. The power is increased in 0.25-W increments until all the gas is removed. The peak temperature reached during a pulse lasts about 2 s and increases by roughly 75 degrees C for each 0.25-W increment in power. In the present investigation six individual ilmenite grains of lunar soil 71501 and of breccia 79035 were studied. It was felt that this method of extracting the gas might help in distinguishing between surface embedded solar wind (SW) particles and more deeply embedded constituents such as solar energetic particles (SEP) [2], or gas of trapped or primordial origin. Although only six particles of each type have been studied to date, interesting results are beginning to emerge. For example, for both types of particles, for the initial low power pulses where the maximum pulse temperature does not exceed 500 degrees C, the ^3He/^4He ratio falls near 4 x 10^-4, as expected, if the helium is primarily unfractionated solar wind implanted near the surface. As the pulse temperature is increased to around 1000 degrees C and the solar wind gas presumably has been removed, the ^3He/^4He ratio falls to around 2.5 x 10^-4, in rough agreement with the layer etching results [2]. Likewise, the ^20Ne/^22Ne ratio falls from around 14 to a value near 12, as in the etching experiments [2]. In the case of ^4He/^20Ne ratios there appears to be a real difference between the particles from the two ilmenites. For the 79035 grains, the ratio falls from around 600 for the surface gas to around 150 for the later high-temperature extractions. On the other hand, for the 71501 grains, the ratio starts somewhat lower, near 400, and drops below 100 as the pulse temperature is raised. A qualitatively similar difference was observed in the total gas released by laser beam extractions performed on single grains from the same lunar ilmenite samples [3]. While there is considerable scatter in the data, the overall results are gratifying, and should become more definitive as more particles are investigated. The initial releases, almost certainly from the surfaces of the particles, come closer to the solar wind values [4] than generally reported for lunar grains. It will be interesting to see whether or not the differences observed are real and have a bearing on the general problem of the variation of the solar wind with time [5].

S., Kim, Y., Marti, K.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|22||215|Ilmenite and pyroxene grain-size separates from 79035 were analyzed for trapped N; the ilmenite was also analyzed for trapped Xe. Ilmenite N contains two or more isotopically distinct trapped components differing in release temperature and therefore plausibly in implantation energy. The isotopically light, higher-temperature (higher-energy?) component has a delta N-15 value equal to -180 percent, significantly above the minimum value observed in bulk 79035, suggesting that parts of 79035 were exposed on the lunar surface earlier than the ilmenite. Using trapped Ar-40/Ar-36 and cosmogenic Ne-21 (Benkert, 1989) a compaction age of about 1 Ga was derived for the ilmenite. This implies a considerably more recent exposure than previously thought, and suggests that the long-term change in delta N-15 of regolith N was more rapid than generally believed. Comparison of these results with those for black/orange glass from 74001/74002 (compaction age 3.7 Ga; delta N-15 in the range -36 to +18 percent (Kerridge et al., 1991) indicates that the long-term trend may have followed a complex evolutionary path. Data for 79035 pyroxenes are consistent with the ilmenite compaction age but suggest a more complex exposure history.|
1992Metic..27Q.206B|1992|An Interstellar Component in the Lunar Regolith|Brilliant, D. R., Franchi, I. A., Arden, J. W., Pillinger, C. T.|Meteoritics|27|3|206|On the basis of trace element studies the lunar regolith is known to contain on average about 1 to 2 wt% of carbonaceous chondrite debris (Ganapathy et al., 1970; Wasson and Baedecker, 1970). Such a component might be expected to be highly modified as a result of impacts at undiminished cosmic velocity. Nevertheless it could be supposed that resilient species such as diamond and silicon carbide, presolar grains recognised in all primitive meteorites, could survive to be distributed within the regolith. Interestingly both the presolar species mentioned are the carriers of characteristic isotopically light nitrogen. A well- known, but so far inadequately explained phenomenon concerning lunar ancient regolith materials is the high abundance of isotopically light nitrogen seen most prominently on soil breccias (Thiemens and Clayton, 1980). Since most of the nitrogen in the lunar soil is believed to have been derived from solar wind implantation, in the absence of any more plausible explanation, a secular change of 30-40% in ^14N/^15N of the sun's corona has been proposed (Kerridge, 1975; Becker and Clayton, 1975). It long ago occurred to us that we could investigate the occurrence of primitive meteorite debris at the lunar surface and possibly shed some light on the problem of light lunar nitrogen by stepped combusting the acid residue of an ancient lunar breccia. In order to avoid the use of excessive amounts of material, the experiment has been postponed until the advent of a new nitrogen isotope mass spectrometer and gas extraction system capable of measuring picomole quantities of the gas to a precision of +-0.1o/oo. Using such an instrument we have measured ca. 0.5-mg samples of 79035 and a residue after destruction of 99.9% of the parent in HF/HCl. Stepped combustion of whole rock 79035 liberated a total of 46 ng nitrogen (82 ppm, SIGMA delta^15N = -l60o/oo isotopic minimum -217o/oo at 850 degrees C) in the now well-known heavy-light-heavy pattern characteristic of ancient breccias. In contrast, the acid residue evolved 90% of its nitrogen 52 ng (103 ppm, SIGMA delta^15N -54o/oo isotopic minimum -74o/oo at 500 degrees C) as a single peak. Additionally delta^15N values of -72 and -45o/oo have been measured at temperatures above 800 degrees C corresponding with small peaks in the release profile, but the amounts of gas were within a factor of two of the blank. The nitrogen release and isotope profile of the major component correspond exactly to that encountered when interstellar diamonds from primitive meteorites are analysed before removal of contaminating organic material. Therefore, we tentatively interpret our data as the first recognition of interstellar grains in the lunar regolith. The appropriate investigation to confirm this conclusion is in progress. Using limiting values for the N abundance in presolar diamonds, we calculate that 79035 contains about 2 ppm diamond, about a factor of 5 less than the theoretical limit, assuming 2wt% CM2 equivalent carbonaceous chondrite material in the sample. The low delta^15N values measured at temperatures greater than 850 degrees would be consistent with about a factor of 50-100 less SiC carbide than diamond in 79035, a figure that corresponds well with the known relative abundance of diamond and SiC in CM2 meteorites. Clearly the abundances of diamond and SiC proposed here are totally incapable of accounting for any significant amount of the light lunar nitrogen. We cannot, however, discount that degassing of an abundant source of interstellar material early in the history of the lunar surface did not provide a source of the light lunar nitrogen by some indirect route.

O.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|103|1-4|55|Surface-sited noble gases were released from metal separates from the Weston meteorite by step-wise oxidation at temperatures below 400°C. Gas release from residual silicates in the separates was successfully suppressed by prior pyrolysis at somewhat higher temperatures than the combustions. Helium, neon and argon extracted from the metal show clear evidence of a solar wind signature. Xenon and nitrogen, on the other hand, were dominated by air, so that no solar component could be identified for these gases. Uncertainties on krypton isotopes were too large to yield useful conclusions. Helium, neon and argon elemental and isotopic ratios appear to depend on depth within the metal grains, in most cases becoming heavier with increasing oxidation of the metal. The cause of this dependence on amount of oxidation is not yet known. Ratios derived for the surface-sited component are therefore somewhat model dependent. Our best estimates are that, at the time of Weston's exposure, the solar wind <SUP>4</SUP>He <SUP>36</SUP>Ar ratio was around 3.6 × 10 <SUP>4</SUP>, <SUP>20</SUP>Ne <SUP>36</SUP>Ar was close to 45, <SUP>4</SUP>He <SUP>3</SUP>He was about 2500, <SUP>20</SUP>Ne <SUP>22</SUP>Ne about 13.3-13.4, <SUP>21</SUP>Ne <SUP>22</SUP>Ne about 0.033-0.035, and <SUP>36</SUP>Ar <SUP>38</SUP>Ar about 5.5-5.7. These ratios indicate that Weston did not acquire its solar wind gases from a recent exposure to solar wind, but more probably at a time in the past similar to or even earlier than the exposure time of Apollo 17 breccias such as 79035. The <SUP>36</SUP>Ar <SUP>38</SUP>Ar ratio, in conjunction with other recent determinations of this value, suggests that it is no longer appropriate to assume that the solar and terrestrial values are equivalent.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(91)90149-C
1989GeCoA..53.1135B|1989|Long-term changes in solar wind elemental and isotopic ratios: A comparison of two lunar ilmenites of different antiquities|Becker, Richard H., Pepin, Robert O.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|53|5|1135|An ilmenite separate from lunar regolith breccia 79035, a sample presumed to have been exposed to solar wind more than 2 Ga ago, was analyzed for noble gas and nitrogen elemental and isotopic abundances by stepwise oxidation and pyrolysis. The gases appear to be distributed between two distinct reservoirs in the ilmenite, defined by release patterns and isotopic considerations. One of the reservoirs, near grain surfaces, yields elemental ratios that for the most part are "solar" while the other, sited at greater depths within grains, has severely fractionated elemental abundances and generally heavier isotopic ratios as well. Xenon provides an exception to the solar abundance pattern in the near-surface reservoir, being enhanced by about a factor of 2 relative to the expected value. A comparison of the 79035 separate with a previously analyzed ilmenite from soil 71501, which received its solar wind exposure much more recently, indicates that the two-fold xenon enhancement occurs in the fractionated reservoir as well as the "solar" one, and that it may therefore be attributable to a change in the solar wind elemental abundances. Other differences between the two ilmenites occur in helium and neon isotopic ratios and in He/Ar elemental ratios. Since mineralogical influences on retentivities of the gases in the two samples should be the same, and possible contributions of non-solar wind components to one ilmenite in preference to the other can generally be eliminated or accounted for, all of these differences may reflect changes in the solar wind over time.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(89)90219-6
1982LPSC...12..289B|1982|Carbon isotopic ratios in some low-delta <SUP>15</SUP>N lunar breccias.|Becker, R. H., Epstein, S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|12||289|Lunar soil breccias 10018, 79035 and 79135 were analyzed for carbon and nitrogen contents and isotopic compositions by vacuum pyrolysis, with a 500 C pre-combustion step in some cases. The combustion was used to remove carbon of terrestrial origin. Nitrogen isotopic ratios for the breccias are very low and are in agreement with results in the literature. Nitrogen yields in two cases were lower than literature values, a result attributable to heterogeneous mixing of implanted and implantation-free components in the breccias. Carbon isotopic ratios were found to be low in these breccias, even when reasonable account is taken of terrestrial carbon contamination. The results are consistent with the idea that low-delta N-15 values in lunar soils and breccias are accompanied by low-delta C-13 values, and imply that any secular variation which occurred in the delta N-15 of nitrogen implanted in lunar soils was accompanied by a similar but smaller variation in the delta C-13 of implanted carbon.|
