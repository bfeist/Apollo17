1994GeCoA..58.1367L|1994|Trace element identification of three chemically distinct very low titanium (VLT) basalt glasses from apollo 17|Lindstrom, David J., Wentworth, Susan J., Martinez, Rene R., McKay, David S.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|58|4|1367|Lunar basaltic samples of VLT (Very Low Titanium) composition occur primarily as small glass fragments in the regolith at the Apollo 17 landing site. Electron microprobe analyses of glasses from the double drive tube 79001/2 (90-150 μm size fraction of soils from mean depths of 0.8-16.8 cm) indicate that 34 of 90 (38%) are of VLT composition. A subset of twenty glasses was removed from the thin sections using a micro-coring device and analyzed using special micro-INAA techniques to obtain major and trace element abundances. On the basis of the results, we delineate three distinct groups which have been named for their relative amounts of Co: HICo, MECo, and LOCo Apollo 17 VLTs. The most magnesian HICo basalt glasses (4 of 34, or about 12% of the VLT glasses) are probably pristine pyroclastics. Soil breccias 79135 and 70295 apparently contain only this type of VLT glass. The medium-Co MECo glasses (6 of 34, 18%) strongly resemble the largest sample of VLT composition, the olivine vitrophyre 78526, as well as all three of the Apollo 17 VLT lithic fragments that have been analyzed for trace elements. The LOCo VLT glasses (23 of 34, 68%) are more enigmatic. Trace element concentrations require that these three VLT compositions cannot be related by simple igneous processes. The distribution of the three types provides important information on the sequence of events that produced the regolith at the Apollo 17 site.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(94)90388-3

H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|88||B3|Two previously unreported varieties of mare volcanic glass have been discovered in Apollo 17 samples. Twenty-three chemical types of volcanic glass have now been analyzed from the six Apollo landing sites. These volcanic glasses, which may be samples of primary magmas derived from the differentiated lunar mantle, define two linear arrays that seem to reflect regional, if not global, regularities among the source regions of these melts. Additional systematics among these glasses have been used to estimate the bulk composition of the moon. The results suggest that the refractory lithophile elements are present at abundances of 1.7 x chondrites. The silicate portion of the moon appears to have a major-element composition similar to a volatile (Si, Na, K)-depleted, earth's upper mantle. The theory involving an earth-fission origin of the moon can be tested further through trace element analyses on the volcanic glasses, and through determination of the N/Ar-36 ratio and noble gas isotopes from primordial lunar gas trapped within vesicles associated with mare volcanic glass.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB088iS01p000B3

M., Pillinger, C. T.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|88||B200|Using stepped heating extraction techniques, determinations of carbon and nitrogen content and delta C-13 and delta N-15 values have been obtained for selected lunar soils and breccias. Only nitrogen data have been gathered for representative splits separated by size, density and magnetic properties from 12023. A plot of the total delta C-13 (after terrestrial contamination is removed) versus delta N-15 values for bulk samples reveals little evidence for a correlation between isotopically light carbon and isotopically light nitrogen of putative ancient solar wind origin. Soil 12023 is used to examine the current interpretation for the stepped release profile of nitrogen from bulk lunar samples. Mature agglutinates, postulated by previous workers to be the host of the light nitrogen, are shown to have a very constant delta N-15 value which is heavy rather than light. The actual host of the light nitrogen in 12023 has not been identified. The lowest values encountered during the study were found associated with the finest soil, but none of these was as low as for some temperature steps of the bulk soil. Interpretations regarding the origin of light nitrogen, if it is not present in agglutinates, await the results of more definitive efforts to identify the host phase.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB088iS01p0B200

H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|87||171|The VLT (very low titanium) volcanic glasses from Apollo 14 and Apollo 17 have been analysed for the major elements and trace Ni. These glasses display compositional trends that may not result entirely from olivine fractionation. The phase relations have been determined experimentally. Olivine is the liquidus phase in the pressure interval from 0 to ∼18 kbar. Pigeonite is the liquidus phase from ∼18 kbar to ≥ 22 kbar. If these VLT volcanic glasses are samples of primary melts that had been in chemical equilibrium with olivine and low-Ca pyroxene in their source regions, then these liquids were derived from depths of 360-380 km within the moon.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB087iS01p0A171

S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1599|A nuclear reaction depth profiling technique previously described by Filleux et al. (1977) has been used to measure the depth distribution of C on grain surfaces for Apollo 11, 15, 16 and 17 soil breccias. The surface C concentration of all samples studied lies between 2 and 8 times 10 to the 15th atoms per sq cm, showing no correlation with the volume C, which varies over an order of magnitude. If the observed variation represents the presence of unexposed grains on the surfaces studied, these results indicate a steady state surface C concentration of 5 to 10 times 10 to the 15th atoms per sq cm, accumulated over a time scale short compared with that required for the formation of volume-related C and with the mean lifetime of grains at the lunar surface. About one-third to one-half of the total C in lunar soil seems to be surface-correlated.|
