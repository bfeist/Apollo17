2003ApJ...597..602H|2003|Helium in Lunar Samples Analyzed by High-Resolution Stepwise Etching: Implications for the Temporal Constancy of Solar Wind Isotopic Composition|Heber, Veronika S., Baur, Heinrich, Wieler, Rainer|The Astrophysical Journal|597|1|602|The <SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He ratio in the present and past solar wind (SW) is of interest because it provides an estimate for the protosolar deuterium abundance. SW He and Ne composition has been analyzed in ilmenites of lunar soils (71501, 12001, 74241) and regolith breccias (79135, 79035, 14301) by closed system stepwise etching. The samples have SW antiquities ranging from ~0.1 to ~3.7 Gyr. The experiments have a very high depth resolution; thus, possible artifacts that may compromise the precise determination of the SW composition can be controlled. The nominal average (<SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He)<SUB>SW</SUB> ratios correlate with the SW antiquity, suggesting at first glance a (<SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He)<SUB>SW</SUB> increase of 6% per Gyr. In addition, also the (<SUP>20</SUP>Ne/<SUP>22</SUP>Ne)<SUB>SW</SUB> ratio seems to have increased with time by about 2% per Gyr. However, there are reasons indicating that the apparent temporal increase of (<SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He)<SUB>SW</SUB> is an artifact. First, there is no straightforward explanation for a concurrent temporal change of (<SUP>20</SUP>Ne/<SUP>22</SUP>Ne)<SUB>SW</SUB> to the extent observed. Second, the average nominal (<SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He)<SUB>SW</SUB> and (<SUP>20</SUP>Ne/<SUP>22</SUP>Ne)<SUB>SW</SUB> ratios correlate with each other, and this correlation parallels the one displayed by the single etch steps, indicating a progressive admixture of the deeper sited, isotopically heavier solar energetic particles with ongoing etching. We suggest that the nominal temporal variation of (<SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He)<SUB>SW</SUB> and (<SUP>20</SUP>Ne/<SUP>22</SUP>Ne)<SUB>SW</SUB> is the result of secondary processes that cause erosion of the outermost layers of the regolith grains and thus a partial removal of the very surface-sited SW. Correcting this partial grain surface loss, assuming a constant SW Ne isotopic composition throughout the Sun's lifetime, leads to constant (<SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He)<SUB>SW</SUB> at (4.47+/-0.13)×10<SUP>-4</SUP> within the last ~4 Gyr. The results suggest that the present-day (<SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He)<SUB>SW</SUB> can directly be used to deduce the protosolar (D+<SUP>3</SUP>He)/<SUP>4</SUP>He composition and that a possible mixing between radiative interior and convective zone must be restricted to a thin boundary layer.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/378402
2002E&PSL.202..201H|2002|Analyses of nitrogen and argon in single lunar grains: towards a quantification of the asteroidal contribution to planetary surfaces|Hashizume, Ko, Marty, Bernard, Wieler, Rainer|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|202|2|201|We performed nitrogen and argon isotopic analyses in single 200-μm-sized ilmenite grains of lunar regolith samples 71501, 79035 and 79135. Cosmogenic and trapped components were discriminated using stepwise heating with a power-controlled CO <SUB>2</SUB> laser. Cosmogenic <SUP>15</SUP>N and <SUP>38</SUP>Ar correlate among different ilmenite grains, yielding a mean <SUP>15</SUP>N <SUB>c</SUB>/ <SUP>38</SUP>Ar <SUB>c</SUB> production ratio of 14.4±1.0 atoms/atom. This yields a <SUP>15</SUP>N production rate in bulk lunar samples of 3.8-5.6 pg (g rock) <SUP>-1</SUP> Ma <SUP>-1</SUP>, which agrees well with previous estimates. The trapped δ <SUP>15</SUP>N values show large variations (up to 300‰) among different grains of a given soil, reflecting complex histories of mixing between different end-members. The <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>14</SUP>N ratio, which is expected to increase with increasing contribution of solar ions, varies from 0.007 to 0.44 times the solar abundance ratio. The trapped δ <SUP>15</SUP>N values correlate roughly with the <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>14</SUP>N ratios from a non-solar end-member characterized by a <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>14</SUP>N ratio close to 0 and variable but generally positive δ <SUP>15</SUP>N values, to lower δ <SUP>15</SUP>N values accompanied by increasing <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>14</SUP>N ratios, supporting the claim of Hashizume et al. (2000) that solar nitrogen is largely depleted in <SUP>15</SUP>N relative to meteoritic or terrestrial nitrogen. Nevertheless, the <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>14</SUP>N ratio of the <SUP>15</SUP>N-depleted (solar) end-member is lower than the solar abundance ratio by a factor of 2.5-5. We explain this by a reprocessing of implanted solar wind atoms, during which part of the chemically inert rare gases were lost. We estimate that the flux of non-solar N necessary to account for the observed δ <SUP>15</SUP>N values is comparable to the flux of micrometeorites and interplanetary dust particles estimated for the Earth. Hence we propose that the variations in δ <SUP>15</SUP>N values observed in lunar regolith can be simply explained by mixing between solar wind contributions and micrometeoritic ones infalling on the Moon. Temporal variations of δ <SUP>15</SUP>N values among samples of different antiquities could be due to changes in the micrometeoritic flux through time, in which case such flux has increased by up to an order of magnitude during the last 0.5 Ga.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0012-821X(02)00781-1

1994GeCoA..58.1367L|1994|Trace element identification of three chemically distinct very low titanium (VLT) basalt glasses from apollo 17|Lindstrom, David J., Wentworth, Susan J., Martinez, Rene R., McKay, David S.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|58|4|1367|Lunar basaltic samples of VLT (Very Low Titanium) composition occur primarily as small glass fragments in the regolith at the Apollo 17 landing site. Electron microprobe analyses of glasses from the double drive tube 79001/2 (90-150 μm size fraction of soils from mean depths of 0.8-16.8 cm) indicate that 34 of 90 (38%) are of VLT composition. A subset of twenty glasses was removed from the thin sections using a micro-coring device and analyzed using special micro-INAA techniques to obtain major and trace element abundances. On the basis of the results, we delineate three distinct groups which have been named for their relative amounts of Co: HICo, MECo, and LOCo Apollo 17 VLTs. The most magnesian HICo basalt glasses (4 of 34, or about 12% of the VLT glasses) are probably pristine pyroclastics. Soil breccias 79135 and 70295 apparently contain only this type of VLT glass. The medium-Co MECo glasses (6 of 34, 18%) strongly resemble the largest sample of VLT composition, the olivine vitrophyre 78526, as well as all three of the Apollo 17 VLT lithic fragments that have been analyzed for trace elements. The LOCo VLT glasses (23 of 34, 68%) are more enigmatic. Trace element concentrations require that these three VLT compositions cannot be related by simple igneous processes. The distribution of the three types provides important information on the sequence of events that produced the regolith at the Apollo 17 site.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(94)90388-3

H., Epstein, S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|12||289|Lunar soil breccias 10018, 79035 and 79135 were analyzed for carbon and nitrogen contents and isotopic compositions by vacuum pyrolysis, with a 500 C pre-combustion step in some cases. The combustion was used to remove carbon of terrestrial origin. Nitrogen isotopic ratios for the breccias are very low and are in agreement with results in the literature. Nitrogen yields in two cases were lower than literature values, a result attributable to heterogeneous mixing of implanted and implantation-free components in the breccias. Carbon isotopic ratios were found to be low in these breccias, even when reasonable account is taken of terrestrial carbon contamination. The results are consistent with the idea that low-delta N-15 values in lunar soils and breccias are accompanied by low-delta C-13 values, and imply that any secular variation which occurred in the delta N-15 of nitrogen implanted in lunar soils was accompanied by a similar but smaller variation in the delta C-13 of implanted carbon.|
