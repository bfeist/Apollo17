2018AGUFM.P13B..03N|2018|A New View of Apollo 17 Basaltic Samples|Neal, C. R.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2018||P13B-03|The Apollo 17 high-Ti basalts were originally classified into types on the basis of whole rock data. Initial types were A, B, C, and U. Type U represented unclassified basalts or those of uncertain affiliation. Four different types of volcanic glass have been described from the Apollo 17 sample collection based on color and composition: VLT, Green, Yellow, and Orange. There are three subdivisions of the orange glasses, based upon major elements. <P />An elemental database of analyses from the Apollo 17 basaltic samples (i.e., both glasses and crystalline basalts) has been compiled in an attempt to re-examine the origins of the crystalline basalts and glasses. This study also highlights those samples where more data are required to properly classify them. The database was used to create results for elements that are common to both basalts and glasses. The "Unclassified" Type U samples were examined on several plots (e.g., La vs. La/Sm, Fig. 1) and assigned to Types A, B1, B2, C, and D depending on their affinities. Where multiple analyses were reported for these samples, averages were taken and data were only omitted if the analysis was clearly different from the others that have been reported. Remarkably, only 4 samples (70035, 74235, 75035, 78579) did not plot consistently with the designated groups from Figure 1 and require more sophisticated analyses (larger sample mas needs to be homogenized). <P />The data show the following: <P />- Type B1 and B2 high-Ti basalts are distinct; <P />- Two new Type D basalts are defined (71597 and 78508 in addition to 79001); <P />- Type A, B1 and C basalts fall on the same trends, as do Types B2 and D; <P />- Orange glass groups are distinct from high-Ti mare basalts; <P />- VLT glasses are similar in composition to the average VLT basalt compositions. <P />Ratios of REE and HFSE elements demonstrate that these basaltic materials are derived from distinct sources. This can also be extended to the transition elements, but these can also be used to demonstrate that the crystalline basalt and glass groups are highly fractionated. The data from the Apollo 17 basaltic samples has allowed us to demonstrate mantle heterogeneity beneath Taurus Littrow. However, the magmas produced from these sources underwent similar evolutionary pathways.|

1999M&PS...34..853R|1999|Properties and mixing of soil components in Apollo 17 double-drive tube 79001/2|Rao, M. N., Wentworth, S. J., Basu, A., Garrison, D. H., McKay, D. S.|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|34|6|853|Previous studies of Apollo 17 double drive tube 79001/2 showed that portions of this lunar regolith segment have some unusual properties, such as very high Is/FeO values (Morris et al., 1989) and nitrogen contents (Stone and Clayton, 1989). To understand the geologic significance of these features in this core, we determined the grain-size distribution and modal abundance of the petrographic constituents for samples from 12 depths of the core. Also, we measured the elemental and isotopic compositions of noble gases in the coarse-grained (150-250?m) and fine-grained (&lt;20?m) sample fractions from 4 depths of this core. The agglutinate abundance and 36Ar contents show depth-related variations similar to those observed for Is/FeO and nitrogen in this core. Samples from the top (~0.5 cm depth) and the bottom (~45 cm depth) of the drive tube are related to Apollo 17 sub-mature soils with ~250-300 Ma GCR (galactic cosmic ray) exposure age. But the soil at the top of the drive tube received additional surface irradiation for ~2 Ma after deposition at Van Serg. The samples at intermediate depths i.e. ~7 cm (upper zone) and ~20 cm (lower zone) of the 79001/2 core show features characteristic of mixtures of Apollo 17 mature soils and finely comminuted regolith breccias having ~600-800 Ma GCR exposure age. The mixing ratios between the coarse and fine fractions of the intermediate-depth samples are similar to each other. Though the mixing ratios for the samples from the top and the bottom of the core are also similar to each other, they differ significantly from the ratios at intermediate depths. The results presented here are consistent with the two component Van Serg core model proposed by Stone and Clayton (1989) and McKay et al. (1988).|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1945-5100.1999.tb01403.x

W., III|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference|||1535|We have studied thin sections from the 79001/2 core taken on the rim of the 90-m diameter impact crater Van Serg. The core is a mixture of basalt and highland fragments, lithics, agglutinates, and impact and volcanic glasses. The core is significantly different from the 74001/2 core taken on the rim of the impact crater Shorty. While the 74001/2 core is composed of only orange glasses and their crystallized equivalents and therefore represents a stratigraphic section at depth, the 79001/2 core represents a mixture of components making up the regolith. Our interest in the 79001/2 core was to search for volcanic glasses and determine their relationship to those found at Shorty. Each of the 19 thin sections in the Van Serg core was studied and glasses were identified. Impact and volcanic glasses that had a unique texture were compositionally analyzed, as were 128 glasses from two thin sections in the core.|
1994GeCoA..58.1367L|1994|Trace element identification of three chemically distinct very low titanium (VLT) basalt glasses from apollo 17|Lindstrom, David J., Wentworth, Susan J., Martinez, Rene R., McKay, David S.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|58|4|1367|Lunar basaltic samples of VLT (Very Low Titanium) composition occur primarily as small glass fragments in the regolith at the Apollo 17 landing site. Electron microprobe analyses of glasses from the double drive tube 79001/2 (90-150 Î¼m size fraction of soils from mean depths of 0.8-16.8 cm) indicate that 34 of 90 (38%) are of VLT composition. A subset of twenty glasses was removed from the thin sections using a micro-coring device and analyzed using special micro-INAA techniques to obtain major and trace element abundances. On the basis of the results, we delineate three distinct groups which have been named for their relative amounts of Co: HICo, MECo, and LOCo Apollo 17 VLTs. The most magnesian HICo basalt glasses (4 of 34, or about 12% of the VLT glasses) are probably pristine pyroclastics. Soil breccias 79135 and 70295 apparently contain only this type of VLT glass. The medium-Co MECo glasses (6 of 34, 18%) strongly resemble the largest sample of VLT composition, the olivine vitrophyre 78526, as well as all three of the Apollo 17 VLT lithic fragments that have been analyzed for trace elements. The LOCo VLT glasses (23 of 34, 68%) are more enigmatic. Trace element concentrations require that these three VLT compositions cannot be related by simple igneous processes. The distribution of the three types provides important information on the sequence of events that produced the regolith at the Apollo 17 site.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(94)90388-3

S.|Geology of the Apollo 17 Landing Site|||29|The Apollo 17 double drive tube 79001/2 (station 9, Van Serg Crater) is distinctive because of its extreme maturity, abundance, and variety of glass clasts. It contains mare glasses of both high Ti and very low Ti (VLT) compositions, and highland glasses of all compositions common in lunar regolith samples: highland basalt (feldspathic; Al2O3 greater than 23 wt percent), KREEP (Al2O3 less than 23 wt percent, K2O greater than 0.25 wt percent), and low-K Fra Mauro (LKFM; Al2O3 less than 23 wt percent, K2O less than 0.25 wt percent). It also contains rare specimens of high-alumina, silica-poor (HASP), and ultra Mg glasses. HASP glasses contain insufficient SiO2 to permit the calculation of a standard norm, and are thought to be the product of volatilization during impact melting. They have been studied by electron microprobe major-element analysis techniques but have not previously been analyzed for trace elements. The samples analyzed for this study were polished grain mounts of the 90-160 micron fraction of four sieved samples from the 79001/2 core (depth range 2.3-11.5 cm). A total of 80 glasses were analyzed by SEM/EDS and electron microprobe, and a subset of 33 of the glasses, representing a wide range of compositional types, was chosen for high-sensitivity INAA. A microdrilling device removed disks (mostly 50-100 micron diameter, weighing approx. 0.1-0.5 micro-g) for INAA. Preliminary data reported here are based only on short counts done within two weeks of irradiation.|

V.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|19||269|The soil maturity and the concentration of Fe metal and 18 major and trace elements were determined along the length of the 79001/2 double drive tube collected near the Van Serg crater at the Apollo 17 station 9. Samples from the top 8.5 cm of the core are found to be very mature and to be enriched in Fe metal and siderophile elements compared to soil lower in the core. It is suggested that this enrichment may have resulted from a significant exposure at some time in the past. A soil component of metallic Fe may be related to micrometeorite impact.|

N.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|19||285|Variations in abundance and isotopic composition of nitrogen in 79002/79001 drive tube samples result from mixing of two soil components: one mature, N-rich, and isotopically light, resembling breccia material in the core, and the other immature, N-poor, and isotopically heavy. That these materials are common to soil at each stratigraphic level in the core suggests widespread distribution in the local regolith. Preservation of mixing correlations involving nitrogen isotopic compositions and cosmogenic N-15 concentrations suggests relatively recent mixing, perhaps in association with emplacement of the core stratigraphy. Characteristics of nitrogen release from the endmember materials, relationships between their nitrogen contents and maturity, and contrasts in their cosmogenic N-15 contents are consistent with models involving secular increase of the N-15/N-14 ratio of the solar wind.|

A.|Science|220|4594|288|A meteorite (Allan Hills 81005) the size of a golf ball picked off the Antarctic ice early in 1982 is geochemically and petrologically indistinguishable from rocks returned from the lunar highlands. It may be a more pristine sample of the lunar highlands than any rock returned by the Apollo missions because it is very low in KREEP. It is explained how a rock could have been ejected from the moon by an impact without being melted or pulverized by the impact. Even though the geochemical evidence is strong that an Antarctic shergottite (Elephant Moraine 79001) is of Martian origin, there is still no satisfactory explanation of how the rock could have been ejected from that planet.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.220.4594.288
