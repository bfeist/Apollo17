H.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2019||P33C-06|Apollo 11's Field Geology Experiment team included small core tubes for use on the first lunar landing 50 years ago. The rationale for coring on this and other missions rested primarily on the hypothesis that development of the regolith would have recorded the history of the solar wind and the flux and composition of meteors and comets impacting the Moon. The most complete core is the 298 cm Apollo 17 deep drill core 70001/9 and a synthesis of geologic, petrographic and geochemical data from numerous papers (published 1974-2017) produced the following conclusions: 70001/9 consists of nine major regolith units, based on differences in maturity indexes, agglutinate and pyroclastic ash content, and particle size- and type-frequency. The nine units probably span at least 1 billion years of solar system history. Primary indicators of maturity of each unit (Is/FeO, GCR tracks, decreased Zn content, and agglutinate percent) are highly correlated. After deposition, the surface of each unit was disturbed by small impacts, defined by reductions in Is/FeO. The second highest unit correlates petrographically and chemically with600-meter diameter Camelot Crater (rim 1 km away), estimated by topographic diffusion analysis to be 500 ± 200 Myr old. Several units in the core can be correlated with ejecta from impact craters within the valley of Taurus-Littrow morphologically older than Camelot. δ<SUP>15</SUP>Nat specific points in the lower 7 units of 70001/9 increases linearly with Is/FeOwith a slope of +1.22 δ<SUP>15</SUP>N‰ per Is/FeO point increase. Correcting δ<SUP>15</SUP>N‰ in the lower 7 units for their maturity gives a consistent solar wind δ<SUP>15</SUP>N value of -105 ± 5‰ at their times of deposition. The top two core units, including the Camelot-correlated unit (500 ± 200 Myr), require an increase in the rate of maturation to +2.07δ<SUP>15</SUP>N‰ per Is/FeO point to equal a solar wind δ<SUP>15</SUP>N value of -105 ± 5‰. <P />Assuming no change in solar wind δ<SUP>15</SUP>N‰, this synthesis of data on 70001/9 indicates that the Sun's luminosity would have increased by a factor of about 1.7 about 500 million years ago. Could this solar warming have triggered the Cambrian Explosion of life's quantity and diversity on Earth 540 million years ago? <P />Plans for future coring on the Moon should include deep cores that reach to the entire depth of regolith now present on dated mare and basin ejecta.|

S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|12||519|A description is presented of data and new calculations which support the idea that the Apollo 17 drill string has a long depositional history. Attention is given to a new interpretation, that a very ancient avalanche was a major depositional event in the history of the core. Important implications for composition of soil components then result from the avalanche interpretation. It is pointed out that single-slab deposition of the entire Apollo 17 drill string would require some extremely unusual events, including preferential disappearance of a 75-150 m crater, and redeposition of 11 oriented features in an upright, instead of the normal overturned position. It appears to be more likely that the oldest valley floor surface is the basalt-rich zone below 275 cm.|

J.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1395|It is shown that the Apollo 17 drill core 70009-70001 is heterogeneous with depth, containing five stratigraphic units, and has a bulk soil chemistry governed by the coarse fractions because of their greater weight proportions. The four components (1) KREEP, (2) anorthositic gabbro, (3) mare basalt, and (4) orange glass are used to model the compositions of the coarse and fine fractions of the entire drill core. It is found that the chemistry of the fused soil component in the five stratigraphic units is more similar to the chemistry of the fine, less than 20-micron fractions than the coarse fraction, suggesting that agglutinates may prefferentially meld and replicate the chemistry of the finer size fractions. The sources of Zn are the orange/black glasses, and the Zn profile is anticorrelated with the maturity index of Morris et al (1979), indicating the liberation of Zn during soil maturation.|

W.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1497|Measurements of Al-26 and Mn-53 in the Apollo 17 drive tube 76001 show a clear integral excess of activity above expected production down to a depth of at least 9 gm/sq cm. This excess is interpreted as a continuous accretion of highly irradiated surface material slowly transported downslope by impact or other processes at a buildup rate of 1.5 cm/m.y. This drive tube, 76001, was collected near a change in slope on the North Massif. Integral excesses have also been observed in other Apollo 16 and 17 cores. Evidence in the Al-26 and Mn-53 record for continuous accretion is shown for Apollo 16 cores 60007 and 60010 and the Apollo 16 deep drill string 70009-70001. This evaluation shows that accretion at specific sites, either through continuous downslope movement or regolith material on the moon, or simply through small impact redistribution, is common on both small and large scales.|

R.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1463|The paper presents depth scales in cm from the surface, and overburden mass in g/cu cm for Apollo 15, 16, and 17 drill cores, which are based on original sample data, Apollo surface activity videotapes, and flight hardware. The Apollo 15 drill core was completely filled, with a straightforward scale accurately representing in situ lunar conditions. A large void in the Apollo 16 drill core was found, although there is evidence that only the upper half of the core has been disturbed. Voids were also found in the upper part of the Apollo 17 drill core, which are explained by sample migration in the tube, and thus the scale for the core closely represents in situ lunar conditions|

J., Wyszynski, J.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1609|Twelve polished thin sections from Apollo 17 drive tube 76001 have been studied by optical petrography. The entire core is found to be mature showing little variation in depth, which is consistent with a depositional model involving slow downslope movement of the regolith by mass wasting. However, within the core some major differences are preserved between two stratigraphic units. Unit A (20-31 cm depth) is enriched in gabbroic anorthosite relative to unit B (0-20 cm depth), while unit B is enriched in KREEPY noritic breccias relative to unit A. This observation is interpreted in terms of a stratigraphy for North Massif involving a noritic breccia unit overlying a unit enriched in gabbroic anorthosite. Pronounced differences between the highland/mare ratios in drive tube 76001 and the Apollo 17 drill core separated by only 3.5 km demonstrate the relative inefficiency of lateral transport as a regolith mixing mechanism on the moon.|

A more complex depositional history consistent with cosmogenic exposure ages, sedimentology and soil maturity, which involves major cratering events as well as depositional ones over a period of more than one billion years, has been independently proposed by Langevin and Maurette (1978) and Nagle and Waltz (1979).|

N., Lal, D.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1253|Eighty samples from various depths of the 3-meter Apollo 17 deep drill core are analyzed using the particle track method. The track data indicate that the depositional history of the core has a time scale of 500-600 million years and is composed of a series of depositional sequences involving both slow and fast accretion as well as removal of material due to erosion events. Track parameters show a systematic trend as a function of depth: low values are observed at depths 20-70, 95-105, 165-175, 225-250 and 285 cm with high values in between, which corresponds to a repetition depth of 0.5 m. The observed variations correlate with agglutinate and FMR data.|

A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1141|With a depth resolution of about 0.5 cm, the stratigraphy of the approximately 3 m Apollo 17 deep drill core by measurement of the total FeO concentration is characterized along with the FMR surface exposure (maturity) index Is/FeO, the metallic iron concentration Fe-vsm, and the FMR linewidth delta-H. For stratigraphic characterization, the first two parameters are the most important. Most of the core is characterized by a FeO concentration of approximately 15.5 wt. %; there is a more mafic zone in the upper approximately 75 cm where the maximum FeO concentration is approximately 18.5 wt. %, and a more felsic zone between approximately 225 and 260 cm where the minimum FeO concentration is approximately 14.0%. As indicated by Is/FeO, most of the soil in the core is submature to mature; the only immature zone is located between approximately 20 and 60 cm and is one of the most distinctive features in the core. A two stage model for the depositional and evolutionary history of the Apollo 17 deep drill core is proposed: (1) deposition by one event approximately 110 m.y. ago or deposition by a sequence of closely spaced events initating a maximum of approximately 200 m.y. ago and terminating approximately 110 m.y. ago, (2) in situ reworking (gardening) to a depth of approximately 26 cm in the period between approximately 110 m.y. ago and the present day.|

J.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1269|Data for 35 major, minor, and trace elements in 40 bulk and size fractions of core 70005-70003 (140-250 cm) are presented. The core is heterogeneous with depth. Moreover, the 1000 to 90 micron coarse fractions are nearly identical but quite different from the less than 20 micron fine fraction. The bulk soil chemistry is governed by the coarse fractions, because of their greater weight proportion in the sample. The 1000-90 micron fraction contains more ilmenite basalt and less orange glass components than the 90-20 micron fraction. The less than 20 micron fraction is consistently enriched in highland material at all depths in the drill core.|

V.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1801|The in situ reworking (gardening) of the lunar surface by impacting projectiles creates an in situ reworking zone extending horizontally over the entire regolith surface and extending vertically from the surface to a depth which varies from place-to-place on the moon. On the basis of available evidence, the 'high-maturity' zones observed at the top of the lunar cores have resulted from the in situ reworking of the present-day lunar surface. The temporal variation of the in situ reworking depth was investigated using depths inferred from maturity I<SUB>s/FeO</SUB> and Al-26 profiles of Apollo cores. The observed temporal variation of the in situ reworking depth in units of centimeters is equal to 2.2 times the time (in units of million years) to the 0.45th power.|

The principal aim of the study was to tackle the difficult problem of solving a set of integral equations from which the depositional histories of the Apollo 15, 16, and 17 core tubes could be inferred from the corresponding depth profiles so far available from these core tubes. For this purpose a 'graphical' method for finding the solutions of these equations was developed which depends on the analysis of a great number (about 2000) of features imprinted on the 200 sets of depth profiles.|
