R., Wegmuller, F., Krahenbuhl, U.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|87||279|The concentrations of volatile elements in grain-size separated agglutinate and mineral fractions of samples 76240 (permanently shadowed) and 76260 were compared in heating experiments. The surface concentrations of Hg were found to be considerably higher in the shadowed sample. For the rest of the investigated elements only small or insignificant differences in the concentrations were observed between the two samples which differ in the storage temperature during the last 10<SUP>4</SUP> y. The difference in the concentrations of Hg must be the result of the shadowing. Based on the present investigation and on our earlier heating experiments, it can be concluded that Hg and Cd are mobilized by solar heating of the uppermost lunar soil and are trapped in cold places on the moon. This low-temperature volatilization leads to a redistribution of volatiles (e.g., Hg and Cd) on the lunar surface.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB087iS01p0A279
