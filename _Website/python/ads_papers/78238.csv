2009GeCoA..73..514E|2009|A combined Sm Nd, Rb Sr, and U Pb isotopic study of Mg-suite norite 78238: Further evidence for early differentiation of the Moon|Edmunson, J., Borg, L. E., Nyquist, L. E., Asmerom, Y.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|73|2|514|Lunar Mg-suite norite 78238 was dated using the Sm-Nd, Rb-Sr, and U-Pb isotopic systems in order to constrain the age of lunar magma ocean solidification and the beginning of Mg-suite magmatism, as well as to provide a direct comparison between the three isotopic systems. The Sm-Nd isotopic system yields a crystallization age for 78238 of 4334 ± 37 Ma and an initial ∊Nd143 value of -0.27 ± 0.74. The age-initial ∊Nd143 (T-I) systematics of a variety of KREEP-rich samples, including 78238 and other Mg-suite rocks, KREEP basalts, and olivine cumulate NWA 773, suggest that lunar differentiation was completed by 4492 ± 61 Ma assuming a Chondritic Uniform Reservoir bulk composition for the Moon. The Rb-Sr isotopic systematics of 78238 were disturbed by post-crystallization processes. Nevertheless, selected data points yield two Rb-Sr isochrons. One is concordant with the Sm-Nd crystallization age, 4366 ± 53 Ma. The other is 4003 ± 95 Ma and is concordant with an Ar-Ar age for 78236. The <SUP>207</SUP>Pb- <SUP>206</SUP>Pb age of 4333 ± 59 Ma is concordant with the Sm-Nd age. The U-Pb isotopic systematics of 78238 yield linear arrays equivalent to younger ages than the Pb-Pb system, and may reflect fractionation of U and Pb during sample handling. Despite the disturbed nature of the U-Pb systems, a time-averaged μ ( <SUP>238</SUP>U/ <SUP>204</SUP>Pb) value of the source can be estimated at 27 ± 30 from the Pb-Pb isotopic systematics. Because KREEP-rich samples are likely to be derived from source regions with the highest U/Pb ratios, the relatively low μ value calculated for the 78238 source suggests the bulk Moon does not have an exceedingly high μ value.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2008.10.021

I.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||343|Calculated compositions for metal crystallized from anorthositic melt rocks or feldspathic basalts such as 14310, 68415, and 77017 are (1) meteoritic in the initial stages or if metal is the only phase crystallized, and (2) higher in Co than meteoritic metal as a result of fractional crystallization of metals and silicates. Metal in coarse anorthositic rocks 15415, 15455, 60015, 64435, and 78238 is not of meteoritic composition and has Co contents from 0 to 9% with a Ni/Co ratio of about 1. The formation of anorthosites and the composition of the earliest metal are discussed with attention to Ni concentrations and the Ni/Co ratio. It is shown that anorthositic hornfels and breccias contain metal of a composition not found in their source material, coarse anorthosite; it is suggested that the hornfels includes metal grains probably derived with little change in composition from ancient meteorites.|
