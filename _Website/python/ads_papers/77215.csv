Most sample-based studies have focused on assessing the water contents of the younger mare basalts and pyroclastic glasses, which are partial-melting products of the lunar mantle. In contrast, little attention has been paid to the inventory and source(s) of water in the lunar highlands rocks which are some of the oldest and most pristine materials available for laboratory investigations, and that have the potential to reveal the original history of water in the Earth-Moon system. Here, we report in-situ measurements of hydroxyl (OH) content and H isotopic composition of the mineral apatite from four lunar highlands samples (two norites, a troctolite, and a granite clast) collected during the Apollo missions. Apart from troctolite in which the measured OH contents in apatite are close to our analytical detection limit and its H isotopic composition appears to be severely compromised by secondary processes, we have measured up to ∼2200 ppm OH in the granite clast with a weighted average δD of ∼ -105±130‰, and up to ∼3400 ppm OH in the two norites (77215 and 78235) with weighted average δD values of -281±49‰ and -27±98‰, respectively. The apatites in the granite clast and the norites are characterised by higher OH contents than have been reported so far for highlands samples, and have H isotopic compositions similar to those of terrestrial materials and some carbonaceous chondrites, providing one of the strongest pieces of evidence yet for a common origin for water in the Earth-Moon system. In addition, the presence of water, of terrestrial affinity, in some samples of the earliest-formed lunar crust suggests that either primordial terrestrial water survived the aftermath of the putative impact-origin of the Moon or water was added to the Earth-Moon system by a common source immediately after the accretion of the Moon.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2014.01.015

K.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|88||603|Mg-suite noritic rocks can be divided into two groups, the Mg-gabbronorites and the Mg-norites. The rocks of these groups differ in ratios of high-Ca pyroxene to total pyroxene, compositions of pyroxene and plagioclase, assemblages of Ti-, Nb-, and Zr-bearing minerals, compositions of chrome spinel, bulk-rock Ti/Sm and Sc/Sm, and measured ages. The two groups probably crystallized from different types of parent magmas. Two hypotheses are offered for the differences in composition of the parent magmas. One hypothesis ascribes the differences to compositional heterogeneity of the mantle source areas. The other hypothesis ascribes the differences to variations in extent of partial melting of the mantle source regions and variations in extent of assimilation of the anorthosite and the highly differentiated residual liquid that were produced during the primordial lunar differentiation.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB088iS02p0A603

J.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|88||887|Experimentally determined pyroxene phase relations at 800°-1200°C are combined with calculated phase equilibria for the Di-En and Hd-Fs joins to produce a graphical two-pyroxene thermometer that should be applicable to a wide variety of rocks from the earth, moon, and meteorites. The thermometer can be used directly with natural pyroxenes that have low contents of Al and other minor components. Samples with higher contents of ‘others’ components require special projection onto the Ca-Mg-Fe pyroxene quadrilateral; Wo, En, and Fs as normally calculated will not yield correct temperatures! The special projection is necessary to approximate the activities of those components in natural pyroxenes. The effects of pressure are nonnegligible but can be corrected for. Use of the thermometer for slowly-cooled rocks may pose special problems if the pyroxenes have undergone granule exsolution (coalescence of exsolved material to form separate grains). For example, published analyses of Mg-rich augites from the Skaergaard intrusion give temperatures that are 50°-100°C below expected magmatic values. Textural and experimental evidence confirms that these augites have undergone granule exsolution. The primary pyroxene compositions must be reconstructed from textural evidence before correct igneous or peak-metamorphic temperatures can be obtained from this or any two-pyroxene thermometer. Of the numerous two-pyroxene thermometers proposed in the literature, those of Ross and Huebner [1975] and of Kretz [1982] Ca-reaction] yield temperatures most similar to our own, although the former tends to give temperatures about 50°C lower for some igneous pyroxenes. Other thermometers generally overestimate temperatures for metamorphic rocks (hornblende granulite facies) by 50°-100°C.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB088iS02p0A887

Both clasts are igneous rocks crystallized from melts that were probably internally generated; clast 27,80 is a cumulate, and the parent magmas of both rocks probably crystallized below the lunar surface. Despite similar history, the parent rocks of the two clasts appear to be derived from distinct magma types: the 27,80 is characterized by plagioclase and orthopyroxene as the major constituents and by a high K, Nb, and Zr content, while the 27,45 type also contains augite and has a low content of K, Nb, and Zr.|

The cooling rate deduced from a computer simulation on the augite exsolution suggests that this pyroxene may have been produced several km below the lunar crust surface; pyroxene compositions and textures in light-matrix breccia 60016.97 show that it is a lunar analogue of the eucritic polymict breccia. It is concluded that this type of breccia may supply information on the pristine nonmare pyroxene components within the original lunar crust.|

Apart from being of interest in its own right, such a comparison provides a test of Delano and Ringwood's (1979) contention that 'abundances of Ge, Au, and other siderophile elements in pristine highland rocks are not consistent with magmatic differentiation'. The other topics reexamined in this paper are the correlation of siderophiles and volatiles in pristine rocks with Rb and Cs (likewise questioned by Delano and Ringwood), the relationship of 'non-mare' basalts (14053, 60639) to their mare counterparts, and the abundance of some incompatible elements in the lunar bulk.|

A regression line corresponding to an age of 4.07 plus or minus 0.09 b.y. is obtained with an Rb-87 decay constant of 1.41 x 10 to the -11th/yr and an initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio of approximately 0.69918. It is noted that the intrusion age of the dikelets provides the most reliable criterion for determining the age of the entire boulder, i.e., the boulder is not an extension of 77115, which formed more recently.

The Apollo 17 boulders are found to be identical or nearly so in major, minor and trace element composition, suggesting that they all originated as an impact melt analogous to melt sheets found in larger terrestrial craters. The matrix dates ( <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar) and Rb/Sr systematics available suggest that this impact melt formed by a single impact about 4 b.y. ago. This impact excavated, shocked, brecciated and melted norites, norite cumulates and possibly anorthositic gabbros and dunites about 4.4 b.y. old.

1976mmc..reptQ....W|1976|Petrographic and petrological study of lunar rock materials|Winzer, S. R.|Martin Marietta Corp. Report||||Samples returned from Apollo 14 (14171, 14305, 14319), Apollo 15 (15255), Apollo 16 (61175, 67455), and Apollo 17 (77215) were studied optically and selected polished sections by SEM/Microprobe. Splits and separates from 77215, 67455, 61175 and 15255 were prepared; 77215 and 67455 were analyzed for major, minor and LIL trace elements. The data indicate that 77215, a noritic breccia clast found in the Station7 boulder, is a norite cumulate similar to and probably derived from the same body as 78235. The Apollo 17 boulders are found to be part of the same melt sheet, which was formed by a major impact event, possibly Serenitatis, about 4 B. Y. ago. The Apollo 14 and 16 breccias are polymict, their clast populations indicating quite different provenance. The Apollo 14 breccias are possibly the result of multiple impacts, while the other breccias studied appear to have been formed by single impacts. ANT suite clasts included in 61175 are, for the most part, granulites resulting from subsolidus recrystallization of norites, anorthosites or gabbros. This metamorphism appears to have occurred prior to the impact event forming 61175.|

A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||707|The origin of the matrix types from the Apollo 17 Station 7 boulder is considered along with the origin of boulder material from Station 2, Boulder 1, and 73215. It is pointed out that the formation of the matrix rocks in this boulder and in the other Apollo 17 boulders in a single impact event is consistent with the isotopic evidence, ages, major-element chemistry, large ion lithophile (LIL) trace-element abundances, and textures. It had been suggested by Winzer et al. (1974), based on calculations from crystal-liquid partition coefficients for LIL trace elements, that target rocks corresponding in trace-element composition to the matrix types could have been produced by partial fusion of rocks similar to 77215. Using the same type of calculation, liquids quite similar in trace-element composition to the Station 7 boulder matrix types can be produced.|

L.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|23|3|413|Preliminary petrographic description and mineral composition of four hand samples (77135, 77115, 77075 and 77215) are presented. 77135, 77115, and 77075 all crystallized from fragment-laden melts; they are similar in textures but differ in grain size. 77135 and 77115 are pigeonite feldspathic basalts. On the basis of geologic and petrographic evidence, 77115 and 77075 are related; they formed, cooled, and consolidated before being engulfed in the vesicular 77135. The impact or igneous origin of the melts from which these rocks crystallized cannot be determined. 77215 is a shocked, strongly sheared and granulated microbreccia consisting of three major lithologies dominated by mineral clasts of orthopyroxene and calcic plagioclase. The orthopyroxene clasts contain coarse exsolved blebs of augite, suggesting a deep-seated origin. The major, minor, and trace element compositions of 77135, 77115, and 77075 are in general similar. They represent a major highland rock type, perhaps more important than anorthosites.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(74)90130-7

The age of the dark veinlet material 77015of3.98 ± 0.04AE is interpreted as representing the time of intrusion of this veinlet into the 77215 clast. The data obtained so far indicate that the vesicular basalt 77135 formed 100-200 m.y. later. However, this has to be confirmed by <SUP>39</SUP>Ar- <SUP>40</SUP>Ar investigations on separated mineral and/or grain-size fractions. A small clast enclosed in the 77135 basalt gives a well-defined high temperature age of 3.99 ± 0.02AE. A sample of the noritic clast 77215 gave 4.04 ± 0.03AE, the highest age found so far in this boulder. The <SUP>39</SUP>Ar- <SUP>40</SUP>Ar ages obtained are in agreement with the age relationships deduced from the stratigraphic evidence.

These internal isochron age are interpreted as reflecting metamorphic events, probably related to impacts, which reset Rb sbnd Sr and U sbnd Pb mineral systems of older rocks. Six portions of boulder 7 were analyzed for U, Th, and Pb as whole rocks. Two chemical groups appear to be defined by the U, Th, and Pb concentration data. Chemical group A is characterized by U, Th, and Pb concentrations and <SUP>238</SUP>U/ <SUP>204</SUP>Pb values which are higher than those of group B. Group A rocks have typical <SUP>232</SUP>Th/ <SUP>238</SUP>U ratios of ∼ 3.85, whereas-group B rocks have unusually high Th/U values of ∼ 4.1. Whole-rock U sbnd Pb and Pb sbnd Pb ages are nearly concordant. Two events appear to be reflected in these data — one at ∼ 4.4 b.y. and one at ∼ 4.5 b.y. The chemical groupings show no correlation with documented ages. The old ages of ∼ 4.4 b.y. and ∼ 4.5 b.y. may, like the younger ∼ 4.0 b.y. ages, be related to basin excavation events.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(74)90134-4
