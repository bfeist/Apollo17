R., Yinnon, H., Fang, C. -Y.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|12||281|The simplified model of glass formation and the development of partial crystallinity in cooled bodies has been applied to lunar compositions 10060, 15028, 15086, 15101, 15286, 15301, 15498, 15499, 60255, 65016, 77017, Apollo 15 green glass and LUNA 24 highland basalt. The critical cooling rates for glass formation predicted by the simplified model are found to be in good agreement (to within an order of magnitude) with those predicted by the exact treatment of crystallization statistics. These predicted critical cooling rates are in even better agreement (a factor of 2) with measured values of the rates required to form glasses of the materials.|
1978LPSC....9..465L|1978|Causes of compositional variations within mare basalt suites.|Lindstrom, M. M., Haskin, L. A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||465|The short-range unmixing model, which explains compositional variations produced during crystallization of a single undifferentiated basalt flow, has been applied to the variations found within each of the suites of mare basalts. Based on this modelling, the following suites of mare basalts could represent random samples from single, undifferentiated lava flows: Apollo 11 A (high K), Apollo 15 olivine, Apollo 17 A-U, Apollo 17 B, Apollo 17 C. The short range unmixing model fails to account for variations within the Apollo 12 olivine-pigeonite group and Apollo 12 ilmenite group, which are well explained by fractional crystallization. The fact that the compositional variations within a suite of samples of unknown affinity can be explained in terms of short-range unmixing of a single lava does not mean that they are necessarily related in that way. It does, however, mean that independent evidence (stratigraphic, petrographic, isotropic, or age) is required to support arguments for the variations being caused by fraction crystallization or different magma batches.|
1978LPSC....9...59J|1978|Trace element evidence for a laterally inhomogeneous moon.|Jovanovic, S., Reed, G. W., Jr.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||59|A number of trace element interrelationships support the concept of a laterally inhomogeneous moon based originally on Clr/P2O5 ratios. The correspondence between Clr/P2O3 and Rb/Sr ratios in basalts are of special interest since the isotropic evolution of the latter pair of elements relates to the earliest history of the moon. This implies the times when the Clr/P2O5 relationships were established. The early magma ocean is conjectured to have been made up of non-intermixing seas resulting either from large convection cells or large body accretion. These mutually exclusive regions could be lunar geological provinces. It is proposed that the diversity of basalts from the Apollo 17 site is related to the lateral inhomogeneity of the moon. Ca/Na ratios in basalts show a trend which parallels that of Ru/Os and in a corresponding fashion may serve as a depth indicator.|

1974Icar...22..459S|1974|Microcrater Populations on Apollo 17 Rocks|Schneider, E., Hoerz, F.|Icarus|22|4|459|Approximately 6000 microcrates were investigated using binocular microscope techniques on Apollo 17 rocks 70215, 72215, 72235, 72395, 72435, 73216, 73218, 73275, 74275, 76135, 76136 and 79155. The crater populations observed have identical characteristics to those obtained from previous missions. Special emphasis was placed on assessing the influence of target properties on the observable crater populations. Although these properties cannot be quantitatively evaluated at present, the empirical results indicate that crater populations on glass, breccia, and crystalline rock surfaces may differ fundamentally. As a consequence, lunar surface exposure ages of individual rocks based on micrometeoroid craters may be subject to criticism.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0019-1035(74)90079-7
