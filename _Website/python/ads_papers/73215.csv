These zircon grains preserve deformation microstructures that show a wide range in style and complexity. Planar deformation features (PDFs) are documented in lunar zircon for the first time, and occur along {001}, {110}, and {112}, typically with 0.1-25 μm spacing. The widest PDFs associated with {112} contain microtwin lamellae with 65°/<110> misorientation relationships. Deformation bands parallel to {100} planes and irregular low-angle (<10°) boundaries most commonly have <001> misorientation axes. This geometry is consistent with a dislocation glide system with <100>{010} during dislocation creep. Nonplanar fractures, recrystallized domains with sharp, irregular interfaces, and localized annealing textures along fractures are also observed. No occurrences of reidite were detected. Shock-deformation microstructures in zircon are explained in terms of elastic anisotropy of zircon. PDFs form along a limited number of specific {hkl} planes that are perpendicular to directions of high Young's modulus, suggesting that PDFs are likely to be planes of longitudinal lattice damage. Twinned {112} PDFs also contain directions of high shear modulus. A conceptual model is proposed for the development of different deformation microstructures during an impact event. This “shock-deformation mechanism map” is used to explain the relative timing, conditions, and complexity relationships between impact-related deformation microstructures in zircon.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1945-5100.2011.01316.x
2008GeCoA..72.3022P|2008|Osmium isotope and highly siderophile element systematics of lunar impact melt breccias: Implications for the late accretion history of the Moon and Earth|Puchtel, Igor S., Walker, Richard J., James, Odette B., Kring, David A.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|72|12|3022|To characterize the compositions of materials accreted to the Earth-Moon system between about 4.5 and 3.8 Ga, we have determined Os isotopic compositions and some highly siderophile element (HSE: Re, Os, Ir, Ru, Pt, and Pd) abundances in 48 subsamples of six lunar breccias. These are: Apollo 17 poikilitic melt breccias 72395 and 76215; Apollo 17 aphanitic melt breccias 73215 and 73255; Apollo 14 polymict breccia 14321; and lunar meteorite NWA482, a crystallized impact melt. Plots of Ir versus other HSE define excellent linear correlations, indicating that all data sets likely represent dominantly two-component mixtures of a low-HSE target, presumably endogenous component, and a high-HSE, presumably exogenous component. Linear regressions of these trends yield intercepts that are statistically indistinguishable from zero for all HSE, except for Ru and Pd in two samples. The slopes of the linear regressions are insensitive to target rock contributions of Ru and Pd of the magnitude observed; thus, the trendline slopes approximate the elemental ratios present in the impactor components contributed to these rocks. The <SUP>187</SUP>Os/<SUP>188</SUP>Os and regression-derived elemental ratios for the Apollo 17 aphanitic melt breccias and the lunar meteorite indicate that the impactor components in these samples have close affinities to chondritic meteorites. The HSE in the Apollo 17 aphanitic melt breccias, however, might partially or entirely reflect the HSE characteristics of HSE-rich granulitic breccia clasts that were incorporated in the impact melt at the time of its creation. In this case, the HSE characteristics of these rocks may reflect those of an impactor that predated the impact event that led to the creation of the melt breccias. The impactor components in the Apollo 17 poikilitic melt breccias and in the Apollo 14 breccia have higher <SUP>187</SUP>Os/<SUP>188</SUP>Os, Pt/Ir, and Ru/Ir and lower Os/Ir than most chondrites. These compositions suggest that the impactors they represent were chemically distinct from known chondrite types, and possibly represent a type of primitive material not currently delivered to Earth as meteorites.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2008.04.006

D., Horan, M. F.|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|36|9|1257|The platinum group elements (PGE; Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, Pt), Re and Au comprise the highly siderophile elements (HSE). We re-examine selected isotopic and abundance data sets for HSE in upper mantle peridotites to resolve a longstanding dichotomy. Re-Os and Pt-Os isotope systematics, and approximately chondritic proportions of PGE in these rocks suggest the presence in undepleted mantle of a chondrite-like component, which is parsimoniously explained by late influx of large planetisimals after formation of the Earth's core and the Moon. But some suites of xenolithic and orogenic spinel lherzolites, and abyssal peridotites, have a CI-normalized PGE pattern with enhanced Pd that is sometimes termed "non-chondritic". We find that this observation is consistent with other evidence of a late influx of material more closely resembling enstatite, rather than ordinary or carbonaceous, chondrites. Regional variations in HSE patterns may be a consequence of a late influx of very large objects of variable composition. Studies of many ancient (>3.8 Ga) lunar breccias show regional variations in Au/Ir and suggest that "graininess" existed during the early bombardment of the Earth and Moon. Reliable Pd values are available only for Apollo 17 breccias 73215 and 73255, however. Differences in HSE patterns between the aphanitic and anorthositic lithologies in these breccias show fractionation between a refractory group (Re, Os and Ir) and a normal (Pd, Ni, and Au) group and may reflect the compositions of the impacting bodies. Similar fractionation is apparent between the EH and EL chondrites, whose PGE patterns resemble those of the aphanitic and anorthositic lithologies, respectively. The striking resemblance of HSE and chalcogen (S, Se) patterns in the Apollo aphanites and high Pd terrestrial peridotites suggest that the "non-chondritic" abundance ratios in the latter may be reflected in the composition of planetisimals striking the Moon in the first 700 Ma of Earth-Moon history. Most notably, high Pd may be part of a general enhancement of HSE more volatile than Fe suggesting that the Au abundance in at least parts of the upper mantle may be 1.5 to 2 times higher than previously estimated. The early lunar influx may be estimated from observed basin-sized craters. Comparison of relative influx to Earth and Moon suggests that the enrichment of HSE is limited to the upper mantle above 670 km. To infer enrichment of the whole mantle would require several large lunar impacts not yet identified.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1945-5100.2001.tb01959.x

The melt rocks show a remarkable diversity of chemical composition, although all but one have typical KREEP incompatible-element patterns. They appear to form five chemical groups, all but the most KREEP-rich of which may represent single impacts. Three groups are of low-K Fra Mauro composition; none correspond to very high alumina (VHA) compositions. The compositions are unlike nearly all other impact melts and regoliths from highland sites, indicating a distinct provenance for the Apollo 15 samples. Serenitatis basin impact melt compositions (Apollo 17 poikilitic boulders) are not duplicated, although one Apollo 17 aphanitic melt sample (73215) is similar to one of the Apollo 15 groups. The Apollo 15 group consisting only of 15445 and 15455 remains the best candidate for Imbrium basin impact melt, while the most KREEP-rich group probably consists of melts produced in varied post-Imbrium impacts into the Apennine Bench Formation (Apollo 15 KREEP basalt flows). The most populated group was previously unrecognized and could be either pre- or post-Imbrium basin; it is possible that it, not 15445/15455, represents Imbrium melt. One unique sample has a non-KREEP incompatible element pattern with low abundances and a positive Eu anomaly. Its target was rather primitive and would not appear to be of regional extent or present in the area in post-Imbrium times; it is either a pre-Imbrian melt or exotic.

It was shown that the basalts are high-alumina, and contain low, unfractionated abundances; the felsite is similar in major element composition and relative REE abundances to the felsites from 73215 and 12013; and the ANT materials are similar to the ANT clasts in other Apollo 17 breccias. Model calculations show that the pyroxene anorhosite has equilibrated with a very evolved liquid, and it is indicated that there was once a liquid with an evolved REE composition which was the parent of the pyroxene anorthosite.|

Thirteen samples from this exceptional breccia have now been dated. The methodological implications of the various types of age spectra are discussed in some detail. The results of this study and of previous studies of breccia 73215 indicate that the date of the South Serenitatis basin-forming event was 3.87 + or - 0.03 AE. This age is confirmed by recent dating of a felsite clast of 73255 with a plateau age of 3.89 + or - 0.03 AE. Some lithic clasts incorporated in the breccia are as old as 4.20 AE.

K.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||789|Fifteen siderophile and volatile trace elements (Os, Re, Ir, Pd, Ni, Au, Sb, Ge, Se, Ag, In, Zn, Cd, Bi, Tl) and U were determined by radiochemical neutron activation analysis in a spheroidal aphanitic clast and a clast of coarse-grained anorthositic gabbro from breccia 73215 and in three types of aphanite and two clasts of fine-grained anorthositic gabbro from breccia 73255. In common with most Apollo 17 fragment-laden melt rocks, the aphanites from 73215 and 73255 predominantly contain a Group 2 meteoritic component, which is apparently derived from the Serenitatis impact. All aphanitic lithologies contain the same meteoritic component, and are probably cogenetic. The clasts of fine-grained anorthositic gabbro contain substantial amounts (2% to 6% Cl equivalent based on Au) of a pre-Serenitatis Group 3 component. The clast of coarse-grained anorthositic gabbro is low in siderophile elements (0.4% Cl equivalent), and the meteoritic component (Group 5) is not well-defined. A strong correlation exists between Ir and Au in both the aphanites and the anorthositic gabbro clasts, which argues against the breccias 73215 and 73255 being open systems for Au|

G.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2459|One felsite ('granite') and three ANT-suite anorthositic gabbro clasts extracted from breccia 73215 are described. The felsite clast has two components - fragments of crystalline felsite and veins and patches of felsic glass. The crystalline felsite, which consists largely of a vermicular intergrowth of quartz and Ba-K-feldspar, crystallized from a highly differentiated melt between 3.90 and 4.05 b.y. The felsic glass component consists of crystallized brown and colorless glasses and uncrystallized colorless glass which are all K and Si rich. The relation of glass features to past heating and the breccia-forming event is considered. In the three anorthositic gabbros, which have similar mineralogies and gradational textures, plagioclase is dominant, and olivine and orthopyroxene are the major mafic minerals. The petrologic data suggest that the gabbros formed as heated, partly melted, and/or recrystallized polymict breccias. It is possible that the approximately 4.25 b.y. age obtained for the three rocks is the date of the melting/recrystallization event.|

The diversity demonstrates the limited resetting power of basin-forming events. Determination of the age of felsite, an exceptional rock type found as a clast within the breccia, indicates that the date of the breccia-forming event is 3.92 + or - 0.04 eons. If 73215 is consolidated Serenitatis ejecta, then all circular basins must have formed between 3.78 and 3.92 eons; ages determined on most Apollo 17 highland rocks predate this period due to incomplete resetting.|

Evidence is given that the age of the melt-derived ground mass, 4.01 + or - 0.05 billion years, has no chronological significance. Instead, the best estimate for the age of the breccia-forming event, about 3.90 billion years, comes from the study of two clasts only a few hundred micrometers in size. The interpretation of this age as the age of the breccia-forming event is also supported by the studies of other consortium members and suggests a reinterpretation of the ages of most of the other Apollo 17 highland breccias.|

Minimum and maximum age estimates for primary crystallization are reported. The nature of the unidentified component that causes some aphanites to show apparent ages of 4.6 eons is considered, and the anomalous age is attributed to volatile loss of Rb at approximately 3.9 eons, the date of crystallization. Clasts of anorthositic gabbro are found to have a Rb-Sr age of approximately 4.25 eons from inprecise internal isochrons, while the model ages are 4.35 eons. It is suggested that if the clasts remained chemically closed during breccia formation, the model ages are older limits to their primary igneous or metamorphic ages.|

It is proposed that the breccias under consideration consist of primary Serenitatis ejecta, texturally modified by secondary impact mixing. When applied to a model of the Serenitatis impact event, unshocked clasts are interpreted as samples of the upper 25 km of the lunar crust with the coarser grained, shocked, plagioclase-rich clasts as material excavated from the lower crust.|

Ar-Ar ages of eleven clast and matrix samples yield plateau ages between 4.04 and 4.28 b.y. This is direct evidence against purely 'basin-dominated' chronologies. Matrix dominated by melts produced in the excavation event yields a basin age of about 4.05 b.y. The clasts were not completely reset upon excavation. Their ages probably reflect the age diversity of the impacted source regions in which the oldest clasts consolidated at or before about 4.25 b.y. ago.|

It is pointed out that the formation of the matrix rocks in this boulder and in the other Apollo 17 boulders in a single impact event is consistent with the isotopic evidence, ages, major-element chemistry, large ion lithophile (LIL) trace-element abundances, and textures. It had been suggested by Winzer et al. (1974), based on calculations from crystal-liquid partition coefficients for LIL trace elements, that target rocks corresponding in trace-element composition to the matrix types could have been produced by partial fusion of rocks similar to 77215. Using the same type of calculation, liquids quite similar in trace-element composition to the Station 7 boulder matrix types can be produced.|

If this is correct, studies of this sample will make it possible to date the Serenitatis event and will provide an insight into the breccia-forming processes associated with such events. Studies of the clasts in the breccia will provide an opportunity to formulate a partial characterization of the preimpact source terrain. An investigation of the deep lunar crust might perhaps also be possible.|
