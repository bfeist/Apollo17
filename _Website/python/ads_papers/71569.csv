H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||259|The paper deals with new and more accurate determinations of uranium, thorium, and isotopic lead data for five bulk samples and separate pyroxene, ilmenite, and plagioclase from basalt 71055. In a concordia diagram, the samples suggest a postcrystallization disturbance of the U-Pb systems of the rock. There is no compelling reason, from U-Pb data, to believe that the moon is younger than 4.55 AE.|
1978LPSC....9..465L|1978|Causes of compositional variations within mare basalt suites.|Lindstrom, M. M., Haskin, L. A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||465|The short-range unmixing model, which explains compositional variations produced during crystallization of a single undifferentiated basalt flow, has been applied to the variations found within each of the suites of mare basalts. Based on this modelling, the following suites of mare basalts could represent random samples from single, undifferentiated lava flows: Apollo 11 A (high K), Apollo 15 olivine, Apollo 17 A-U, Apollo 17 B, Apollo 17 C. The short range unmixing model fails to account for variations within the Apollo 12 olivine-pigeonite group and Apollo 12 ilmenite group, which are well explained by fractional crystallization. The fact that the compositional variations within a suite of samples of unknown affinity can be explained in terms of short-range unmixing of a single lava does not mean that they are necessarily related in that way. It does, however, mean that independent evidence (stratigraphic, petrographic, isotropic, or age) is required to support arguments for the variations being caused by fraction crystallization or different magma batches.|
1977LPSC....8.3083N|1977|Exposure histories of lunar rocks 71135 and 71569.|Niemeyer, S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||3083|Rare-gas isotopic analyses have been performed on lunar rocks 71135 and 71569. The conventional (Kr-81)-Kr cosmic-ray exposure ages are 103 + or - 3 m.y. for 71135 and 134 + or - 7 m.y. for 71569. An approach is outlined to deducing complex exposure histories from rare-gas data using depth profiles of the production rates of the cosmogenic rare-gas isotopes. Examination of the Xe isotopes by means of a 'concordia' plot suggests that 71569 may have a simple one-stage exposure history whereas 71135 has a more complex history. An attempt is made to construct exposure models for these two rocks which account for the abundances of all the cosmogenic rare gases, the Xe isotopic compositions, and the apparent (Kr-81)-Kr exposure ages. This study demonstrates the depreciation of (Kr-81)-Kr ages for rocks exposed at shallow depths, caused by the relatively rapid variation of the Kr-81 production as the rock is eroded. Possible implications of the tentative results for the formation age of the Central Cluster unit are discussed.|

F.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||447|Petrographic studies of Apollo 17 mare basalts indicate that 70215 and 71569 arrived at the lunar surface as liquids. Low-pressure melting experiments show that compositional variations within the Apollo 17 and Apollo 11 ophitic basalt suites may be generated by near-surface fractional crystallization of liquids with compositions similar to 70215 and 70017. High-pressure melting experiments show that liquids similar in composition to 70017 and 70215 can be generated by partial melting of an olivine+clinopyroxene+Fe-Ti-oxide source at depths of 100-150 km within the moon.|
