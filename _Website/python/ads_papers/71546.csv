R., Barker, S., Keil, K., Ma, M. -S., Schmitt, R.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||225|Bulk compositional and mineral chemical data for 28 previously unanalyzed samples support the classification of Apollo-17 high-Ti mare basalts into three-types (A, B, and C), defined on the basis of analyses of fine-grained basalts. The most MgO- and TiO2-rich fine-grained basalts of these types appear to be the best choices for representing the compositions of the parent magmas.|
1978LPSC....9..465L|1978|Causes of compositional variations within mare basalt suites.|Lindstrom, M. M., Haskin, L. A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||465|The short-range unmixing model, which explains compositional variations produced during crystallization of a single undifferentiated basalt flow, has been applied to the variations found within each of the suites of mare basalts. Based on this modelling, the following suites of mare basalts could represent random samples from single, undifferentiated lava flows: Apollo 11 A (high K), Apollo 15 olivine, Apollo 17 A-U, Apollo 17 B, Apollo 17 C. The short range unmixing model fails to account for variations within the Apollo 12 olivine-pigeonite group and Apollo 12 ilmenite group, which are well explained by fractional crystallization. The fact that the compositional variations within a suite of samples of unknown affinity can be explained in terms of short-range unmixing of a single lava does not mean that they are necessarily related in that way. It does, however, mean that independent evidence (stratigraphic, petrographic, isotropic, or age) is required to support arguments for the variations being caused by fraction crystallization or different magma batches.|

L.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||487|Regression and pattern recognition techniques were applied to 16 chemical species in 34 Apollo 17 basalts. The classification scheme of Pratt et al., (1977) was used. Data were absent for 8 MnO, 3 Hf, 3 Tb, and 8 Cr2O3 analyses. Linear regression studies were utilized to predict these and values obtained were added to the original data base. Pattern recognition techniques were then applied to predict classifications for 30 different Apollo 17 rake basalts analyzed by Murali et al., (1977).|
