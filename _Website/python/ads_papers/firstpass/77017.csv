2011AGUFM.P13D1696F|2011|Lunar paleomagnetism: a new analysis of the Apollo-era paleomagnetic measurements|Fuller, M., Weiss, B. P.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||P13D|The Apollo era lunar paleomagnetism suffered from the lack of modern instrumentation and data analysis techniques. However, paleomagnetic data for nearly 100 samples were reported. We have completed a reanalysis of these old Apollo paleomagnetic data using modern techniques of analysis. The principal result from the mare basalts is that many samples such as 10020, 10017, 10049, 12022, and 70215 appear to be carrying primary natural remanent magnetization (NRM) acquired on the Moon as they initially cooled on the lunar surface, but in almost every case alternating field (AF) demagnetization was not carried out to strong enough fields to isolate this primary magnetization properly. When modern measurements are available, the agreement between old Apollo era data and new data is strikingly good. It also appears that the fields recorded by the basalts of Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 may be stronger than those recorded by Apollo 12 basalts, but the small number of high fidelity magnetic recorders among the latter group make this tentative at present. The histories of breccias are more complicated than those of mare basalts and their NRM is harder to interpret. The regolith and fragmental breccias have NRM, which is either a combination of shock remanent magnetization (SRM) acquired during shock lithification and partial to total thermal remanent magnetization (TRM) depending upon the residual temperature after the shock event. For regolith breccias, interpretations are complicated because of their strong superparamagnetic components and their complex, polymict lithologies. It would be unwise to use these samples for paleointensity estimates unless one can be sure that the NRM was entirely acquired as TRM during cooling after the shock event, such as may be the case for 15498. In contrast, the melt rock and melt breccias, which are formed at high temperatures far above the Curie point of any magnetic carriers, have an excellent chance of recording lunar fields faithfully when they cool. This cooling may have taken place in a melt pool in a simple crater, or in a melt layer in a complex crater. Such samples would then have been excavated and deposited in the regolith. Samples 14310, 68416, 77017 and 77135 may have had such simple histories and some appear to have recorded strong fields, but more work needs to be done to test this suggestion. Other melt rocks and melt breccias have had more complicated histories and appear to have been deposited in ejecta blankets, where final cooling took place. The samples from the Apollo 17 layered boulder 1 at station 2 provide an example of this history. If a pTRM can be related to this secondary cooling, then we may recover a record of the field during this cooling. Samples such as 62235 and 72215 may provide just such a record, with Apollo-era and modern estimates of fields of the order of around 100 microT. Explaining such high paleointensities so late in lunar history is a major challenge to dynamo models given the small size of the lunar core.
2009PhDT.......253H|2009|Mineralogy, petrology, and chronology of the lunar granulitic breccias|Hudgins, Jillian Amy|Ph.D. Thesis||||Before the return of the Apollo and Luna samples, many basic geological questions about the Moon remained unanswered. The study of returned samples, in addition to remote sensing data and the growing collection of meteorites has revealed that the Moon is a geologically complex body with a history dominated by impact events. Lunar meteorites provide samples of the crust far removed from the Apollo landing sites and are probably more representative of the average lunar crust. SaU 300 was previously misclassified as an anorthositic regolith breccia. Here, I reclassify it as a polymict crystalline impact-melt breccia with an anorthositic norite bulk composition. SaU 300 is a new meteorite that is unpaired with any of the currently known lunar meteorite samples. The main objective of this study was to gain a better understanding of the early evolution of the Moon by studying some of the oldest samples available: the granulitic breccias. The following samples were studied: Apollo samples 60035, 77017, 78155, and 79215 and paired meteorites NWA 3163/4881/4483. Granulitic breccias exhibit poikiloblastic to granoblastic matrix textures and occur as individual rocks and as fragments in impact-melt rocks, the regolith, and in lunar meteorites. These rocks contain 70 -- 80% anorthite, low concentrations of incompatible trace elements, and moderately high concentrations of siderophile elements. Their history was dominated by impact events and thermal metamorphism. Matrix pyroxenes in the granulitic breccias last equilibrated at ̃1050+/-50°C. 40Ar/39Ar data reveal that 60035, 77017, and 78155 have peak metamorphic ages of 4.1 Ga, while 79215 has a peak metamorphic age of 3.9 Ga. NWA 3163 has a peak metamorphic age of 3.3 Ga. Samples 60035, 77017, and NWA 4881 were partially reset by low temperature heating events following metamorphism. Granulitic breccias have been described as "homogeneous on a millimetre scale" throughout the literature. Although they appear to be compositionally homogeneous under petrographic and electron microscopes EMP analysis shows that they retain relic igneous minor and trace element zoning in their larger mafic mineral clasts. Based on the results of this study, I proposed that granulitic breccias form beneath thick, superheated melt sheets associated with impact basins and that they were heated for 104 -- 106 years.
2008GeCoA..72.5781H|2008|A laser probe <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar and INAA investigation of four Apollo granulitic breccias|Hudgins, Jillian A., Spray, John G., Kelley, Simon P., Korotev, Randy L., Sherlock, Sarah C.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|72|23|5781|Infrared laser probe <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar geochronology, instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and analytical electron microscopy have been performed on four 0.5 × 1.0 × 0.3 cm polished rock tiles of Apollo 16 and 17 granulitic breccias (60035, 77017, 78155, and 79215). Pyroxene thermometry indicates that these samples were re-equilibrated and underwent peak metamorphic sub-solidus recrystallization at 1000-1100 °C, which resulted in homogeneous mineral compositions and granoblastic textures. <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar data from this study reveal that three samples (60035, 77017, and 78155) have peak metamorphic ages of ̃4.1 Ga. Sample 79215 has a peak metamorphic age of 3.9 Ga, which may be related to Serenitatis basin formation. All four samples contain moderately high concentrations of meteoritic siderophiles. Enhanced siderophile contents in three of the samples provide evidence for projectile contamination of their target lithologies occurring prior to peak metamorphism. Post-peak metamorphism, low-temperature (<300 °C) events caused the partial resetting of argon in the two finer-grained granulites (60035 and 77017). These later events did not alter the mineralogy or texture of the rocks, but caused minor brecciation and the partial release of argon from plagioclase. Interpretation of the low-temperature data indicates partial resetting of the argon systematics to as young as 3.2 Ga for 60035 and 2.3 Ga for 77017. Cosmic ray exposure ages range from 6.4 to ̃339 Ma. Our results increase the amount of high-precision data available for the granulitic breccias and lunar highlands crustal samples. The results demonstrate the survival of pre-Nectarian material on the lunar surface and document the effects of contact metamorphic and impact processes during the pre-Nectarian Epoch, as well as the low-temperature partial resetting of ages by smaller impact events after 3.9 Ga. The mineralogy and chemical composition of these rocks, as well as exhumation constraints, indicate that the source of heat for metamorphism was within kilometers of the surface via burial beneath impact-melt sheets or hot ejecta blankets.
1993LPI....24..369C|1993|The Granulite Suite: Impact Melts and Metamorphic Breccias of the Early Lunar Crust|Cushing, J. A., Taylor, G. J., Norman, M. D., Keil, K.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference|24||369|The granulite suite consists of two major types of rocks. One is coarse-grained and poikilitic with many euhedral crystals of olivine and plagioclase. These characteristics indicate crystallization from a melt; the poikilitic granulites are impact melt breccias. The other group is finer-grained and granoblastic, with numerous triple junctions; the granoblastic granulites are metamorphic rocks. Compositional groups identified by Lindstrom and Lindstrom contain both textural types. Two pyroxene thermometry indicates that both groups equilibrated at 1000 to 1150 C. Calculations suggest that the granoblastic group, which has an average grain size of about 80 microns, was annealed for less than 6 x 10 exp 4 y at 1000 C, and for less than 2500 y at 1150 C. Similar equilibration temperatures suggest that both groups were physically associated after impact events produced the poikilitic melts. Granulitic impactites hold important information about the pre-Nectarian bombardment history of the Moon, and the composition and thermal evolution of the early lunar crust. Granulitic impactites are widely considered to be an important rock type in the lunar crust, but how they formed is poorly understood. Metal compositions and elevated concentrations of meteoritic siderophile elements suggest that most lunar granulites are impact breccias. Their occurrence as clasts in approximately 3.9 Ga breccias, and Ar-(40-39) ages greater than or = 4.2 Ga for some granulites show that they represent a component of the lunar crust which formed prior to the Nectarian cataclysm. Petrographic characteristics of lunar granulites indicate at least two endmember textural variants which apparently formed in fundamentally different ways. One type has granoblastic textures consisting of equant, polygonal to rounded grains, and abundant triple junctions with small dispersions around 120 degrees indicating a close approach to textural equilibrium. As suggested by many authors, granoblastic granulites probably formed by subsolidus annealing and recrystallization of fragmental or glassy protoliths. Examples of this type include 15418, 78155, and 79215. The other textural type consists of poikilitic to poikiloblastic rocks with euhedral to subhedral plagioclase and olivine enclosed by interstitial pyroxene. In some cases, the texture resembles that of an orthocumulate. Examples of this type include 60035, 67955, and 77017. Rounding of grain edges is common in poikilitic granulites, but the regular crystal shapes and widely dispersed dihedral angles show they are far from textural equilibrium. <The textures of poikilitic granulites are more consistent with the formation of these rocks by crystallization from a melt than by subsolidus metamorphism. &A few samples have been recognized with textural characteristics transitional between those of the granoblastic and poikiloblastic endmembers (e.g., 72559, 78527). Pyroxene compositions taken from the literature and determined for this study by electron microprobe were used to calculate equilibration temperatures. The Kretz Ca transfer (solvus) thermometer and the Lindsley and Anderson graphical method both give similar temperatures, which range from approximately 1000 to 1150 C. There is no apparent temperature difference between granoblastic and poikilitic varieties, but there is a hint in these data that the more ferroan varieties equilibrated to lower temperatures. *Additional studies are in progress to test this possibility.

R., Yinnon, H., Fang, C. -Y.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|12||281|The simplified model of glass formation and the development of partial crystallinity in cooled bodies has been applied to lunar compositions 10060, 15028, 15086, 15101, 15286, 15301, 15498, 15499, 60255, 65016, 77017, Apollo 15 green glass and LUNA 24 highland basalt. The critical cooling rates for glass formation predicted by the simplified model are found to be in good agreement (to within an order of magnitude) with those predicted by the exact treatment of crystallization statistics. These predicted critical cooling rates are in even better agreement (a factor of 2) with measured values of the rates required to form glasses of the materials.
1975LPSC....6.1593P|1975|<SUP>40</SUP>Ar-<SUP>39</SUP>Ar dating of Apollo 16 and 17 rocks.|Phinney, D., Kahl, S. B., Reynolds, J. H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1593|The reported study is a continuation of an investigation begun by Alexander and Kahl (1974), with primary emphasis on (Ar-40)-(Ar-39) dating of lunar breccias. A primary objective of the study was related to the resolution of small plateau-age differences between Apollo 16 and 17 samples which have been irradiated in the same irradiation. This objective was not realized because (1) neither of the considered Apollo 16 samples has a well-defined plateau, and (2) the release patterns of the two Apollo 17 samples with plateaux (73235 and 77017) are sufficiently complex to suggest caution in interpretation of fine-scale differences among apparent ages. The plateau age of 73235 agrees well with plateau ages measured for a nearby boulder at the South Massif. The plateau age of 77017, on the other hand, agrees well with plateau ages measured in an nearby boulder at the base of the North Massif. These rock and boulder ages are tightly clustered about 3.99 b.y., and this clustering suggests that the North and South Massifs were made in the same basin-forming event, presumably Serenitatis.

D.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||221|Clasts of anorthositic norite in 67955 and 77017, and several other samples, are suggested to represent material which crystallized from a silicate magma in a plutonic environment. Although no statement can be made regarding the ultimate origin of the parent melt, its composition was relatively felsic, starting within the primary field of crystallization of either plagioclase or spinel. The sequence of crystallization was: plagioclase (and/or spinel) olivine - low-Ca pyroxene - high-Ca pyroxene.
1975LPSC....6..343H|1975|The provenance of metal in anorthositic rocks.|Hewins, R. H., Goldstein, J. I.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||343|Calculated compositions for metal crystallized from anorthositic melt rocks or feldspathic basalts such as 14310, 68415, and 77017 are (1) meteoritic in the initial stages or if metal is the only phase crystallized, and (2) higher in Co than meteoritic metal as a result of fractional crystallization of metals and silicates. Metal in coarse anorthositic rocks 15415, 15455, 60015, 64435, and 78238 is not of meteoritic composition and has Co contents from 0 to 9% with a Ni/Co ratio of about 1. The formation of anorthosites and the composition of the earliest metal are discussed with attention to Ni concentrations and the Ni/Co ratio. It is shown that anorthositic hornfels and breccias contain metal of a composition not found in their source material, coarse anorthosite; it is suggested that the hornfels includes metal grains probably derived with little change in composition from ancient meteorites.
