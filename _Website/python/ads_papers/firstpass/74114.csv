W.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|21||51|The authors report new chemical analyses and petrographic descriptions for 10 previously unanalyzed Apollo 17 rock samples. Only one of these samples is unambiguously pristine, albeit several others show low levels of siderophile elements and might reasonably be regarded as "quasipristine". The clearly pristine sample, 74114,5, is the first unambiguously pristine ferroan-anorthositic suite (FAS) sample from Apollo 17. As an FAS rock, this sample is extraordinary in several respects. It appears that 74114,5, and Apollo 17 anorthosites in general, formed at a relatively late stage in the evolution of the primordial magmasphere.
