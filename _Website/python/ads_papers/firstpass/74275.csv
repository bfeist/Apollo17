2015M&PS...50.1449S|2015|Exploring the Moon's surface for remnants of the lunar mantle 1. Dunite xenoliths in mare basalts. A crustal or mantle origin?|Shearer, Charles K., Burger, Paul V., Bell, Aaron S., Guan, Yunbin, Neal, Clive R.|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|50|8|1449|Remotely sensed observations from recent missions (e.g., GRAIL, Kaguya, Chandrayaan-1) have been interpreted as indicating that the deep crust and upper mantle are close to or at the lunar surface in many large impact basins (e.g., Crisium, Apollo, Moscoviense). If this is correct, the capability of either impact or volcanic processes to transport mantle lithologies to the lunar surface should be enhanced in these regions. Somewhat problematic to these observations and interpretations is that examples of mantle lithologies in the lunar sample collection (Apollo Program, Luna Program, lunar meteorites) are at best ambiguous. Dunite xenoliths in high-Ti mare basalt 74275 are one of these ambiguous examples. In this high-Ti mare basalt, olivine occurs in three generations: olivine associated with dunite xenoliths, olivine megacrysts, and olivine microphenocrysts. The dunite xenoliths are anhedral in shape and are generally greater than 800 μm in diameter. The interior of the xenoliths are fairly homogeneous with regard to many divalent cations. For example, the Mg# (Mg/Mg + Fe × 100) ranges from 82 to 83 in their interiors and decreases from 82 to 68 over the 10-30 μm wide outer rim. Titanium and phosphorus X-ray maps of the xenolith illustrate that these slow diffusing elements preserve primary cumulate zoning textures. These textures indicate that the xenoliths consist of many individual olivine grains approximately 150-200 μm in diameter with low Ti, Al, and P cores. These highly incompatible elements are enriched in the outer Fe-rich rims of the xenoliths and slightly enriched in the rims of the individual olivine grains. Highly compatible elements in olivine such as Ni exhibit a decrease in the rim surrounding the xenolith, an increase in the incompatible element depleted cores of the individual olivine grains, and a slight decrease in the "interior rims" of the individual olivine grains. Inferred melt composition, liquid lines of descent, and zoning profiles enable the reconstruction of the petrogenesis of the dunite xenoliths. Preservation of primary magmatic zoning (Ti, P, Al) and lack of textures similar to high-pressure mineral assemblages exhibited by the Mg-suite (Shearer et al. 2015) indicate that these xenoliths do not represent deep crustal or shallow mantle lithologies. Further, they are chemically and mineralogically distinct from Mg-suite dunites identified from the Apollo 17 site. More likely, they represent olivine cumulates that crystallized from a low-Ti mare basalt at intermediate to shallow crustal levels. The parent basalt to the dunite xenolith lithology was more primitive than low-Ti basalts thus far returned from the Moon. Furthermore, this parental magma and its more evolved daughter magmas are not represented in the basalt sample suite returned from the Taurus-Littrow Valley by the Apollo 17 mission. The dunite xenolith records several episodes of crystallization and re-equilibration. During the last episode of re-equilibration, the dunite cumulate was sampled by the 74275 high-Ti basalt and transported over a period of 30-70 days to the lunar surface.
2015E&PSL.431..195F|2015|Indigenous nitrogen in the Moon: Constraints from coupled nitrogen-noble gas analyses of mare basalts|Füri, Evelyn, Barry, Peter H., Taylor, Lawrence A., Marty, Bernard|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|431||195|Nitrogen and noble gas (Ne-Ar) abundances and isotope ratios, determined by step-wise CO<SUB>2</SUB> laser-extraction, static-mass spectrometry analysis, are reported for bulk fragments and mineral separates of ten lunar mare basalts (10020, 10057, 12008, 14053, 15555, 70255, 71557, 71576, 74255, 74275), one highland breccia (14321), and one ferroan anorthosite (15414). The mare basalt sub-samples 10057,183 and 71576,12 contain a large amount of solar noble gases, whereas neon and argon in all other samples are purely cosmogenic, as shown by their <SUP>21</SUP>Ne/<SUP>22</SUP>Ne ratios of ≈0.85 and <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/<SUP>38</SUP>Ar ratios of ≈0.65. The solar-gas-free basalts contain a two-component mixture of cosmogenic <SUP>15</SUP>N and indigenous nitrogen (<0.5 ppm). Mare basalt 74255 and the olivine fraction of 15555,876 record the smallest proportion of <SUP>15</SUP>N<SUB>cosm</SUB>; therefore, their δ<SUP>15</SUP> N values of -0.2 to + 26.7 ‰ (observed at the low-temperature steps) are thought to well represent the isotopic composition of indigenous lunar nitrogen. However, δ<SUP>15</SUP> N values ≤ - 30 ‰ are found in several basalts, overlapping with the isotopic signature of Earth's primordial mantle or an enstatite chondrite-like impactor. While the lowest δ<SUP>15</SUP> N values allow for nitrogen trapped in the Moon's interior to be inherited from the proto-Earth and/or the impactor, the more <SUP>15</SUP>N-enriched compositions require that carbonaceous chondrites provided nitrogen to the lunar magma ocean prior to the solidification of the crust. Since nitrogen can efficiently be incorporated into mafic minerals (olivine, pyroxene) under oxygen fugacities close to or below the iron-wustite buffer (Li et al., 2013), the mare basalt source region is likely characterized by a high nitrogen storage capacity. In contrast, anorthosite 15414 shows no traces of indigenous nitrogen, suggesting that nitrogen was not efficiently incorporated into the lunar crust during magma ocean differentiation.
2013GeCoA.106..429F|2013|Distinguishing between Apollo 14 impact melt and pristine mare basalt samples by geochemical and textural analyses of olivine|Fagan, A. L., Neal, C. R., Simonetti, A., Donohue, P. H., O'Sullivan, K. M.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|106||429|Apollo 14 (A-14) impact melt olivine vitrophyres (OVs), composed of olivine phenocrysts in an opaque glass matrix with minor amounts of pyroxene and plagioclase, are petrographically similar to pristine quenched A-14 high-alumina (high-Al) and Apollo 12 (A-12) basalts. Textural and chemical analyses have been conducted on olivines within impact melt and pristine mare basalt clasts from A-14 breccia 14321 as well as various olivine-phyric Apollo 12 and 17 basalts to be able to distinguish between the petrographically similar samples. The A-14 high-Al basalts examined here represent samples from each of the three chemical groups (A, B, C). Examples from the three A-12 basalt suites (Ilmenite, Olivine, Pigeonite) and olivine-rich Apollo 17 (A-17) Type C basalt, 74275, have also been analyzed. As a complement to the chemical analyses, crystal size distributions (CSDs) were determined for approximately half of the samples investigated here (due to a small number of olivine crystals that did not produce statistically meaningful CSDs on half of the samples), and confirm that although similar, the basalts and impact melts are texturally distinct. Olivines from A-14 impact melts have the highest average forsterite contents (average Fo ̃0.82) and generally the lowest average Co (37 ppm) and Mn (1544 ppm) abundances, thus chemically distinguishing them from the pristine basalts. In addition, chemical compositions obtained for olivine from 14321,1486 are most likely representative of an impact melt and thus contradict its previous classification as a high-Al basalt (Neal et al., 1988); olivine from, 1486 have similar average forsterite (average Fo ̃0.82) and Ti/V-ratio to the OVs. Furthermore, on the basis of their chemical compositions, olivines have been identified within the impact melts that are likely inherited from basalts; these olivines are chemically distinct from the rest of the impact melt olivine population with lower forsterite (0.67-0.80) and low Ti/V (̃10), which are similar to olivine compositions from the A-14 high-Al basalts. In addition to distinguishing between sample types from A-14, olivine compositions can also be used to distinguish between pristine mare basalts from various missions. Olivine within the selected samples from the individual A-12 basalt suites can also be distinguished chemically from one another using the Ti/V ratio, where Olivine suite basalts have Ti/V <3 and Ilmenite suite basalts have Ti/V >3.5. The results indicate that combined use of CSDs and chemical analyses of olivine can be used to reliably distinguish between (1) impact melts and pristine Apollo 14 basalts, (2) basalts from different landing sites, and (3) individual basalt suites from a single site.

2006GeCoA..70.6103M|2006|Isotopic composition of zinc, copper, and iron in lunar samples|Moynier, F., Albarède, F., Herzog, G. F.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|70|24|6103|We determined by ICP-MS the concentrations and isotopic ratios of Fe, Cu, and Zn in the Ti-rich lunar basalt 74275, in the lunar orange glass 74220, and in up to 10 lunar soils, namely, 14163, 15231, 64501, 66041, 68841, 69941, 70011, 72501, 75081, and 76501. Two analyses of zinc in lunar basalt 74275 give δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn = 0.17‰ and 0.75‰, values within the range of those measured in terrestrial basalts; copper in lunar basalt 74275 has δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu ̃ +1.4‰, which is isotopically heavier than values observed in terrestrial basalts. In the orange glass, we measured δ <SUP>56</SUP>Fe = -0.24‰, δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu = -0.42‰, and δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn ̃ -3.6‰. These values of δ are more negative than those obtained for 74275 and for typical lunar basalts, but for Cu, comparable to those observed in terrestrial sulfides and meteorites. In lunar soils we found 0.11‰ ⩽ δ <SUP>56</SUP>Fe ⩽ 0.51‰, 2.6‰ ⩽ δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu ⩽ 4.5‰, and 2.2‰ ⩽ δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn ⩽ 6.4‰. Insofar as we can generalize from a small sample set, S, Fe, Cu, Zn, and Cd show similar trends in isotopic fractionation on the Moon. Lunar basalts have nearly terrestrial isotopic ratios. Relative to the lunar basalt 74275, the pyroclastic glass 74220 is enriched in the lighter isotopes of Fe, Cu, and Zn, and the soils are enriched in the heavier isotopes of Fe, Cu, and Zn. The patterns in the basalts are likely inherited from the source material; the light-isotope enrichments seen in the orange glass originated during lava fountaining or, less probably, during partial condensation of vapor; and the heavy-isotope enrichments in the lunar soils were likely created by a combination of processes that included micrometeorite vaporization and sputtering. In the orange glass, the light-isotope enrichments (relative to lunar basalts) of Zn are larger than those of Cu. If these enrichments reflect accurately the isotopic composition of the gas, they suggest that Cu is more volatile than Zn in the liquid from which the gas derived. A simple model built on the known flux of micrometeorites to the lunar surface and a published estimate that micrometeorites generate 10 times their own mass of vapor, predicts heavy-isotope enrichments comparable to those observed in soils but only if the regolith gardening rate is set at about one twentieth of the generally accepted value of 1 cm/My. This discrepancy may reflect the difference in the time constants for micrometeorite milling and decimeter-scale gardening, or the importance of sputtering.

The <SUP>26</SUP>Al profile shows the steep decrease with increasing depth that is characteristic of nuclides whose production is dominated by solar cosmic rays. <SUP>41</SUP>Ca activities decrease from about 22 dpm/kg at the surface to a minimum of ̃9 dpm/kg at a depth of 4.7 g/cm <SUP>2</SUP> and then increase to ̃11 dpm/kg at a depth of 15.8 g/cm <SUP>2</SUP>. The sharp decrease near the surface identifies for the first time production of <SUP>41</SUP>Ca by solar cosmic rays. We also report <SUP>10</SUP>Be measurements for six samples from lunar core 74002/1. The <SUP>10</SUP>Be activities range from approximately 8 to 14 dpm/kg. We model the production of <SUP>10</SUP>Be, <SUP>26</SUP>Al, and <SUP>41</SUP>Ca in lunar rock 74275 by including published data that indicate a long exposure to galactic cosmic rays at a depth of 140 g/cm <SUP>2</SUP> followed by one at the surface lasting 2.8 Ma. Cosmogenic radionuclide production by galactic cosmic rays, and, in the case of <SUP>41</SUP>Ca, by thermal neutrons is estimated from published measurements and semi-empirical calculations. Our model includes a new calculation of production rates due to solar cosmic rays and incorporates recently published cross section measurements. Although many parameterizations of the flux of solar energetic particles give acceptable fits to the experimental data for 74275, we prefer a best fit obtained for <SUP>10</SUP>Be and <SUP>26</SUP>Al alone, which incorporates an erosion rate of ̃2 mm/Ma, a rigidity of 100 MV, and a 4π flux of protons with energies greater than 10 MeV of 89 cm <SUP>-2</SUP> s <SUP>-1</SUP>. For <SUP>41</SUP>Ca alone, the corresponding values are 2 mm/Ma, 80 MV, and 198 cm <SUP>-2</SUP> s <SUP>-1</SUP>. The differences between the two sets of parameters may reflect uncertainties in the calculations of <SUP>41</SUP>Ca production or a secular change in the solar cosmic ray flux. Calculations for a slab and for a hemispherical knob with a radius of 23 cm yield similar results.

J.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference|27||1249|Analysis of oxygen on the electron microprobe has been seldom done in the past. The measurement of oxygen (and other light elements) has its share of unique problems, such as weak signal due to the low fluorescence yield of low atomic numbers and the high absorption of their X-rays, along with other problems that have lead to the usual condition in mineral analysis of calculating oxygen from the stoichiometry of the mineral analyzed. However, with the advent of synthetic multi-layer analyzing crystals with large d-spacing and improved matrix correction methods, the direct measurement of oxygen can yield additional information. For example, by measuring O on hydrous minerals and glasses, close estimates of H2O can reached. In anhydrous minerals, in which one or more constituents have variable oxidation states, the valance states may be determined by calculation from the oxygen analysis. Here we attempt to measure oxygen in pyroxene from Apollo 17 high-Ti mare basalt 74275. This a quickly-cooled basalt with TiO2 ~ 13 wt% and TiO2 in pyroxene >6.0 wt%. Our goal in this study is to estimate Ti3+/Ti4+.

Results of the calculations show that most mare basalts are not derived by simple low-pressure fractionation from parents with the compositions of picritic glasses as tabulated by Delano [1986a]. Also, there is no indirect evidence as yet for posteruption fractionation of picritic magmas in the form of sufficiently magnesian, mare-type olivines at the Apollo 12 and 15 landing sites.

These latter results favor the hypothesis that mare basalts have fractionated, “nonprimary” compositions and that the small number of observed linkages between basalts and picritic parents is a consequence of limited sampling.

This is a function of the oxygen fugacity occurring at the time of its formation, with lower fugacities being reflected in higher Ti(3+) contents. Controlled cooling-rate and isothermal experimentation on synthetic analog and natural specimens of 70017 and 74275 have been used to calibrate an oxygen geobarometer. Most lunar rocks have followed crystallization paths in oxygen fugacity/T space such that the prevailing oxygen fugacity can be represented by a curve near parallel to the I/W buffer curve. The oxygen fugacity estimates derived from Ti(3+) considerations of armalcolites range from the iron/wustite curve to about 1.5 log units below.

This 'primitive' sample was chosen for study because its major and trace element chemistry as well as its equilibrium phase relations at atmospheric pressure are known from previous studies. Beta-track analytical techniques were used so that partition coefficients could be measured in an environment whose bulk trace element composition is similar to that of the natural basalt. Partition coefficients for Cr and Mn were determined in the same experiments by microprobe analysis. The only equilibrium partial melting model appears to be one in which ilmenite is initially present in the source region but is consumed by melting before segregation of the high-Ti mare basalt liquid from the residue.

The study of the cosmic-ray-produced isotopes He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe in the basaltic rocks 74235, 74255, and 74275, in bulk soil samples from the orange soil 74220, from the gray soils 74241 and 74261, and from the black soil 74001, and in grain size separates from the black soil allows the determination of the cosmic-ray exposure history of these samples. All three rocks experienced at least a two-stage exposure as can be judged from the comparison of their irradiation geometry at the time of collection with that inferred from depth-dependent relative abundances of cosmic-ray-produced nuclei. The exposure histories of the rocks and soils are characterized by four events or periods. These results show that the Shorty impact occurred no more than 30 m.y. ago. The most probable age of this crater is 19 m.y., when the large boulder was excavated from the subfloor. The trapped solar-wind concentration in the black soil is extremely low, on the average only 0.3% of that usually found for lunar soil.

These materials are thought to be extraneous and to compromise the primary nature of 74275. Recognition of the small chemical variations present may aid in understanding some discrepancies in the experimental petrology literature. However, these small variations have a distressing petrogenetic significance since they severely limit resolution in recognizing the number and depth of origin of primary magmas.

The crater populations observed have identical characteristics to those obtained from previous missions. Special emphasis was placed on assessing the influence of target properties on the observable crater populations. Although these properties cannot be quantitatively evaluated at present, the empirical results indicate that crater populations on glass, breccia, and crystalline rock surfaces may differ fundamentally. As a consequence, lunar surface exposure ages of individual rocks based on micrometeoroid craters may be subject to criticism.
