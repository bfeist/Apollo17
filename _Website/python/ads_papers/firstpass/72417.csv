1980GeCoA..44.2111W|1980|Moon and Earth : compositional differences inferred from siderophiles, volatiles, and alkalis in basalts|Wolf, Rainer, Anders, Edward|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|44|12|2111|We have compared RNAA analyses of 18 trace elements in 25 low-Ti lunar and 10 terrestrial oceanic basalts. According to Ringwood and Kesson, the abundance ratio in basalts for most of these elements approximates the ratio in the two planets. Volatiles (Ag, Bi, Br, Cd, In, Sb, Sn, Tl, Zn) are depleted in lunar basalts by a nearly constant factor of 0.026 ± 0.013, relative to terrestrial basalts. Given the differences in volatility among these elements, this constancy is not consistent with models that derive the Moon's volatiles from partial recondensation of the Earth's mantle or from partial degassing of a captured body. It is consistent with models that derive planetary volatiles from a thin veneer (or a residuum) of C-chondrite material; apparently the Moon received only 2.6% of the Earth's endowment of such material per unit mass. Chalcogens (Se and Te) have virtually constant and identical abundances in lunar and terrestrial basalts, probably reflecting saturation with Fe(S, Se, Te) in the source regions. Siderophiles show diverse trends. Ni is relatively abundant in lunar basalts (4 × 10 <SUP>-3</SUP> × Cl-chondrites), whereas Ir, Re, Ge, Au are depleted to 10 <SUP>-4</SUP>-10 <SUP>-5</SUP>× Cl. Except for Ir, these elements are consistently enriched in terrestrial basalts: Ni 3 × , Re 370 ×, Ge 330 × , Au 9 × . This difference apparently reflects the presence of nickel-iron phase in the lunar mantle, which sequesters these metals. On Earth, where such metal is absent, these elements partition into the crust to a greater degree. Though no lunar mantle rock is known, an analogue is provided by the siderophile-rich dunite 72417 (~0.1% metal) and the complementary, siderophile-poor troctolite 76535. The implied metal-siderophile distribution coefficients range from 10 <SUP>4</SUP> to 10 <SUP>6</SUP>, and are consistent with available laboratory data. The evidence does not support the alternative explanation advanced by Ringwood—that Re was volatilized during the Moon's formation, and is an incompatible element (like La or W <SUP>4+</SUP>) in igneous processes. Re is much more depleted than elements of far greater volatility: (Re/U) <SUB>Cl</SUB>̃- 4 × 10 <SUP>-6</SUP> vs ( T1/ U) <SUB>Cl</SUB> = 1.3 × 10 <SUP>-4</SUP>, and Re does not correlate with La or other incompatibles. Heavy alkalis (K, Rb, Cs) show increasing depletion with atomic number. Cs/Rb ratios in lunar basalts, eucrites, and shergottites are 0.44, 0.36, and 0.65 × Cl, whereas the value for the bulk Earth is 0.15-0.26. These ratios fall within the range observed in LL and E6 chondrites. supporting the suggestion that the alkali depletion in planets, as in chondrites, was caused by localized remelting of nebular dust (= chondrule formation). Indeed, the small fractionation of K, Rb and Cs, despite their great differences in volatility, suggests that the planets, like the chondrites, formed from a mixture of depleted and undepleted material, not from a single, partially devolatilized material.

J.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2035|Rb-Sr systematics is studied for the lunar troctolite 76535 in phases covering a wide range of Rb and Sr concentrations. A line is obtained corresponding to an age of 4.61 plus or minus 0.07 AE and an initial Sr-87/Sr-86 of 0.69900 plus or minus 0.00003. The Rb-Sr age of 4.55 plus or minus 0.10 AE for the dunite (72417) and that of the troctolite are in approximate agreement and permit an interpretation that these rocks formed during a single major lunar differentiation which presumbly produced an anorthositic-gabbroic lunar crust and layered upper mantle.

H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1845|The deformation and thermal history of lunar dunite 72417 has been elucidated from optical and electron petrographic study. Accepting the suggestion that 72417 crystallized as a differentiate of the primary lunar crust, a model of its history is presented which involves four stages of shock deformation and at least two stages of annealing; at least one heating event may have accompanied shock deformation.

A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1231|The rock selected for the study is one of the rare ultrabasic rocks, which seems to have survived early lunar differentiation. The Rb-Sr internal isochron for this dunite gave an age of about 4.55 AE. The dunite was sampled at Apollo 17, Station 2 from a single 10x20-cm clast incorporated into a KREEP-rich blue-gray breccia 72435, Boulder 3. Nine dunite samples were analyzed with the aid of instrumental and radiochemical neutron activation analysis procedures. Data for 27 elements are shown in a table. Attention is given to trapped liquid (magma), a garnet hypothesis, models for the dunite genesis, and magma compositions from which 15415 and 72417 crystallized.
