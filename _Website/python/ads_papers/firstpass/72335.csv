A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2335|The paper presents petrographic and mineralogical data for five samples from Boulder 2 (72315, 72335, 72355, 72375, and 72395) and sample 72435 from Boulder 3 at Apollo 17 Station 2. All the samples were found to consist of a few percent megaclasts set in a fine-grained matrix, which is comprised of microclasts and a poikilitic to subophitic-textured groundmass that crystallized from a melt. The samples have similar modal mineralogies, mineral compositions, and bulk-chemical compositions.
1974E&PSL..23..206L|1974|Chemical composition of boulder-2 rocks and soils, Apollo 17, station 2|Laul, J. C., Schmitt, R. A.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|23|2|206|Forty-two elements have been measured via INAA and RNAA in six samples of five rocks from a 2-m tan-gray boulder-2 breccia (South Massif), in four soils from the South Massif and a valley soil. The chemical composition of the four metaclastic rocks corresponds to "high alumina" (52% Pl) and medium-K KREEP-type rocks. Rock 72335,2 is a medium K anorthositic gabbro (74% Pl). Both the North and South Massifs appear to be medium-K KREEP in composition and thus may represent a single stratigraphic unit of the Serenitatis basin event. Four soils of the South Massif are identical in composition to medium-K KREEP; they are more feldspathic and lower in LIL trace elements relative to the boulder-2 rocks. The valley soil 75081 is like the 10084 soil; both soils are high in TiO <SUB>2</SUB> and both are deficient in KREEP. Th and U give a sharp distinction between the valley and highland soils. The South Massif rocks and soils contain siderophiles at the 2-4% Cl level and show an ancient meteoritic pattern. Five samples of the four rocks have Ir/Au ratios of Â± 0.02 which we assign to the Serenitatis basis planetesimal. The valley soil at Camelot Crater has low siderophiles (1% Cl). Our systematic study of four shadowed and exposed soils does not support the labile hypothesis for Cd, In, Tl and Zn. We observe no volatile (atmophile) movement from the South Massif highland soils to the valley soil 75081. The volatiles Cs and Tl appear to have been fractionated in the boulder-2 rocks during cratering, brecciation and metamorphic processes. The uniform ratio of FeO/MnO = 80-85, observed for all previous mare and highland sites, also holds for the Taurus-Littrow site.
