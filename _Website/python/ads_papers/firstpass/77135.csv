While much of Earth’s impact record has been erased, its Moon preserves an extensive history of bombardment. Quantifying the timing of lunar impact events is crucial to understanding how impacts have shaped the evolution of early Earth, and provides the basis for estimating the ages of other cratered surfaces in the Solar System. Many lunar impact melt rocks are complex mixtures of glassy and crystalline “melt” materials and inherited clasts of pre-impact minerals and rocks. If analyzed in bulk, these samples can yield complicated incremental release 40Ar/39Ar spectra, making it challenging to uniquely interpret impact ages. Here, I have used a combination of high-spatial resolution 40Ar/39Ar geochronology and thermal-kinetic modeling to gain new insights into the impact histories recorded by such lunar samples. To compare my data to those of previous studies, I developed a software tool to account for differences in the decay, isotopic, and monitor age parameters used for different published 40Ar/39Ar datasets. Using an ultraviolet laser ablation microprobe (UVLAMP) system I selectively dated melt and clast components of impact melt rocks collected during the Apollo 16 and 17 missions. UVLAMP 40Ar/39Ar data for samples 77135, 60315, 61015, and 63355 show evidence of open-system behavior, and provide new insights into how to interpret some complexities of published incremental heating 40Ar/39Ar spectra. Samples 77115, 63525, 63549, and 65015 have relatively simple thermal histories, and UVLAMP 40Ar/39Ar data for the melt components of these rocks indicate the timing of impact events—spanning hundreds of millions of years—that influenced the Apollo 16 and 17 sites. My modeling and UVLAMP 40Ar/39Ar data for sample 73217 indicate that some impact melt rocks can quantitatively retain evidence for multiple melt-producing impact events, and imply that such polygenetic rocks should be regarded as high-value sampling opportunities during future exploration missions to cratered planetary surfaces. Collectively, my results complement previous incremental heating 40Ar/39Ar studies, and support interpretations that the Moon experienced a prolonged period of heavy bombardment early in its history.

V., Jolliff, B. L., Van Soest, M. C., Wartho, J. A., Weirich, J. R.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||P33C|Several boulders located at the bases of the North and South Massifs were among the primary field targets of the Apollo 17 mission to the Taurus-Littrow Valley on the Moon [1]. Some boulders are polylithologic, including Boulder 1 at Station 2 and the boulders at Stations 6 and 7. These boulders were the subjects of consortium studies [2, 3] that included 40Ar/39Ar geochronology to determine the ages of distinct lithologies within each boulder [e.g., 4-6]. We report new 40Ar/39Ar data for the impact melt breccias 72255, 76315, 77075, and 77135 obtained using the UV laser ablation microprobe (UVLAMP) methods of [7]. For 72255, we obtained a preliminary isochron date ca. 3814 Ma from 22 melt analyses, which is younger than published plateau dates (e.g., 3951-3835 Ma [4, 8]). Fifteen melt analyses of 76315 yield a preliminary isochron date ca. 3850 Ma, younger than the 3900 ± 16 Ma date reported by [8]. Melt analyses of 77075 yield preliminary dates between ca. 3797-3584 Ma, possibly reflecting partial loss of 40Ar. In this case, the oldest date may provide a minimum age for the formation of melt in 77075. Finally, the UVLAMP dates for the 77135 melt range from 3810-3361 Ma and corresponding Ca/K ratios range from ca. 100-6. Electron microprobe analyses of small (ca. 10s of microns wide) pockets of K-rich materials show that both K-rich glass and K-feldspar are present. The UVLAMP dates for 77135 likely reflect spatially variable 40Ar loss, consistent with published step heating results [e.g., 6]. References: [1] Schmitt (1973) Science, 182, 681-690.

2011AGUFM.P13D1696F|2011|Lunar paleomagnetism: a new analysis of the Apollo-era paleomagnetic measurements|Fuller, M., Weiss, B. P.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||P13D|The Apollo era lunar paleomagnetism suffered from the lack of modern instrumentation and data analysis techniques. However, paleomagnetic data for nearly 100 samples were reported. We have completed a reanalysis of these old Apollo paleomagnetic data using modern techniques of analysis. The principal result from the mare basalts is that many samples such as 10020, 10017, 10049, 12022, and 70215 appear to be carrying primary natural remanent magnetization (NRM) acquired on the Moon as they initially cooled on the lunar surface, but in almost every case alternating field (AF) demagnetization was not carried out to strong enough fields to isolate this primary magnetization properly. When modern measurements are available, the agreement between old Apollo era data and new data is strikingly good. It also appears that the fields recorded by the basalts of Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 may be stronger than those recorded by Apollo 12 basalts, but the small number of high fidelity magnetic recorders among the latter group make this tentative at present. The histories of breccias are more complicated than those of mare basalts and their NRM is harder to interpret. The regolith and fragmental breccias have NRM, which is either a combination of shock remanent magnetization (SRM) acquired during shock lithification and partial to total thermal remanent magnetization (TRM) depending upon the residual temperature after the shock event. For regolith breccias, interpretations are complicated because of their strong superparamagnetic components and their complex, polymict lithologies. It would be unwise to use these samples for paleointensity estimates unless one can be sure that the NRM was entirely acquired as TRM during cooling after the shock event, such as may be the case for 15498. In contrast, the melt rock and melt breccias, which are formed at high temperatures far above the Curie point of any magnetic carriers, have an excellent chance of recording lunar fields faithfully when they cool. This cooling may have taken place in a melt pool in a simple crater, or in a melt layer in a complex crater. Such samples would then have been excavated and deposited in the regolith. Samples 14310, 68416, 77017 and 77135 may have had such simple histories and some appear to have recorded strong fields, but more work needs to be done to test this suggestion. Other melt rocks and melt breccias have had more complicated histories and appear to have been deposited in ejecta blankets, where final cooling took place. The samples from the Apollo 17 layered boulder 1 at station 2 provide an example of this history. If a pTRM can be related to this secondary cooling, then we may recover a record of the field during this cooling. Samples such as 62235 and 72215 may provide just such a record, with Apollo-era and modern estimates of fields of the order of around 100 microT. Explaining such high paleointensities so late in lunar history is a major challenge to dynamo models given the small size of the lunar core.

Brent, Ryder, Graham|Journal of Geophysical Research|101|E11|26069|We have obtained high-resolution (21-63 steps) <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/<SUP>39</SUP>Ar age spectra using a continuous laser system on 19 submilligram samples of melt rocks and clasts from Apollo 17 samples collected from the pre-Imbrian highlands in the easternmost part of the Serenitatis basin. The samples include poikilitic melt rocks inferred to have been formed in the Serenitatis basin-forming impact, aphanitic melt rock whose compositions vary and whose provenance is uncertain, and granulite, gabbro, and melt clasts. Three of the poikilitic melts have similar age spectrum plateau ages (72395,96, 3893+/-16 Ma (2σ) 72535, 7, 3887+/-16 Ma; 76315, 150, 3900+/-16 Ma) with a weighted mean age of 3893+/-9 Ma, which we interpret as the best age for the Serenitatis basin-forming impact. Published <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/<SUP>39</SUP>Ar age spectrum ages of Apollo 17 poikilitic melts are consistent with our new age but are much less precise. Two poikilitic melts did not give plateaus and the maxima in their age spectra indicate ages of >=3869 Ma (72558,7) and >=3743 Ma (77135,178). Plateau ages of two poikilitic melts and two gabbro clasts from 73155 range from 3854+/-16 Ma to 3937+/-16 Ma and have probably been affected by the ubiquitous (older?) clasts and by post-formation heating (impact) events. Plateau ages from two of the aphanitic melt ``blobs'' and two granulites in sample 72255 fall in the narrow range of 3850+/-16 Ma to 3869+/-16 Ma with a weighted mean of 3862+/-8 Ma. Two of the aphanitic melt blobs from 72255 have ages of 3883+/-16 Ma and >=3894 Ma, whereas a poikilitic melt clast (of different composition from the ``Serenitatis'' melts) has an age of 3835+/-16 Ma, which is the upper limit for the accretion of 72255. These data suggest that either the aphanitic melts vary in age, as is also suggested by their varying chemical compositions, or they formed in the 72255 accretionary event about 3.84-3.85 Ga and older relict material is responsible for the dispersion of ages. In any case the aphanitic melts do not appear to be Serenitatis products. Our age for the Serenitatis impact shows, on the basis of the isotopic age evidence alone, that Serenitatis is >20-25 Ma and probably >55-60 Ma older than Imbrium (<=3870 Ma and probably <=3836 Ma [Dalrymple and Ryder, 1993]). Noritic granulite sample 78527 has a plateau age of 4146+/-17 Ma, representing a minimum age for cooling of this sample in the early lunar crust. So far there is no convincing evidence in the lunar melt rock record for basin-forming impacts significantly older than 3.9 Ga.

From the shielding at the early stage, a lower limit of 50 cm is estimated for the thickness of the lava flows from which the investigated basalts originate.

Notable similarities between the lunar and chondritic melt breccias include: abundant vesicles, similar pyroxene chemical zoning trends, the presence of variable amounts of clastic material, and similar chemical compositions except for K and Na contents of glass and mesostasis. Some constraints on the cooling history are estimated from Mg-Fe diffusion profiles in olivine and pyroxene. The burial depth of lunar sample 77135 during cooling was 0.2-100 m; the depth for the chondrite was probably smaller. Impact melts were probably produced and a layer of regolith retained on the parent body sufficiently thick to allow the olivines to homogenize during slow cooling.

The astronauts observed four lithologies: a large white clast represented by 77215, cut by dark dikelets (77075) and enclosed in blue-gray breccia (77115); the assemblage of these three rock types is in turn surrounded by green-gray breccia (77135). The history of the station 7 boulder, as construed from the results of the consortium study, is presented.

T., Minkin, Jean A., Thompson, Carolyn L.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|23|3|413|Preliminary petrographic description and mineral composition of four hand samples (77135, 77115, 77075 and 77215) are presented. 77135, 77115, and 77075 all crystallized from fragment-laden melts; they are similar in textures but differ in grain size. 77135 and 77115 are pigeonite feldspathic basalts. On the basis of geologic and petrographic evidence, 77115 and 77075 are related; they formed, cooled, and consolidated before being engulfed in the vesicular 77135. The impact or igneous origin of the melts from which these rocks crystallized cannot be determined. 77215 is a shocked, strongly sheared and granulated microbreccia consisting of three major lithologies dominated by mineral clasts of orthopyroxene and calcic plagioclase. The orthopyroxene clasts contain coarse exsolved blebs of augite, suggesting a deep-seated origin. The major, minor, and trace element compositions of 77135, 77115, and 77075 are in general similar. They represent a major highland rock type, perhaps more important than anorthosites.

The age of the dark veinlet material 77015of3.98 ± 0.04AE is interpreted as representing the time of intrusion of this veinlet into the 77215 clast. The data obtained so far indicate that the vesicular basalt 77135 formed 100-200 m.y. later. However, this has to be confirmed by <SUP>39</SUP>Ar- <SUP>40</SUP>Ar investigations on separated mineral and/or grain-size fractions. A small clast enclosed in the 77135 basalt gives a well-defined high temperature age of 3.99 ± 0.02AE. A sample of the noritic clast 77215 gave 4.04 ± 0.03AE, the highest age found so far in this boulder. The <SUP>39</SUP>Ar- <SUP>40</SUP>Ar ages obtained are in agreement with the age relationships deduced from the stratigraphic evidence. Taking into account the shielding by the boulder itself, an average <SUP>37</SUP>Ar- <SUP>38</SUP>Ar exposure age of (27.5 ± 2.5)m.y. is obtained for the samples collected from the boulder.

The petrography and lack of evidence of crystallization in the 1280-1150°C interval suggest that the matrix is either a devitrified, shock-melted and supercooled glass, or a devitrified, depressurised liquid whose liquidus temperature had been depressed by the presence of a small amount of water at pressures attainable in the upper part of the lunar crust.

These internal isochron age are interpreted as reflecting metamorphic events, probably related to impacts, which reset Rb sbnd Sr and U sbnd Pb mineral systems of older rocks.

Chemical group A is characterized by U, Th, and Pb concentrations and <SUP>238</SUP>U/ <SUP>204</SUP>Pb values which are higher than those of group B. Group A rocks have typical <SUP>232</SUP>Th/ <SUP>238</SUP>U ratios of ̃ 3.85, whereas-group B rocks have unusually high Th/U values of ̃ 4.1. Whole-rock U sbnd Pb and Pb sbnd Pb ages are nearly concordant. Two events appear to be reflected in these data — one at ̃ 4.4 b.y. and one at ̃ 4.5 b.y. The chemical groupings show no correlation with documented ages. The old ages of ̃ 4.4 b.y. and ̃ 4.5 b.y. may, like the younger ̃ 4.0 b.y. ages, be related to basin excavation events.
