D., Shih, C. -Y., Park, J., Reese, Y. D., Irving, A. J.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|73|14|4288|Multiple lines of evidence show that the Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, and Ar-Ar isotopic systems individually give robust crystallization ages for basaltic (or diabasic) shergottite Northwest Africa (NWA) 1460. In contrast to other shergottites, NWA 1460 exhibits minimal evidence of excess <SUP>40</SUP>Ar, thus allowing an unambiguous determination of its Ar-Ar age. The concordant Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, and Ar-Ar results for NWA 1460 define its crystallization age to be 346 ± 17 Ma (2 σ). In combination with petrographic and trace element data for this specimen and paired meteorite NWA 480, these results strongly refute the suggestion by others that the shergottites are ̃4.1 Ga old. Current crystallization and cosmic-ray exposure (CRE) age data permit identification of a maximum of nine ejection events for Martian meteorites (numbering more than 50 unpaired specimens as of 2008) and plausibly as few as five such events. Although recent high resolution imaging of the Martian surface has identified limited areas of sparsely cratered terrains, the meteorite data suggest that either these areas are representative of larger areas from which the meteorites might come, or that the cratering chronology needs recalibration. Time-averaged <SUP>87</SUP>Rb/ <SUP>86</SUP>Sr = 0.16 for the mantle source of the parent magma of NWA 1460/480 over the ̃4.56 Ga age of the planet is consistent with previously estimated values for bulk silicate Mars in the range 0.13-0.16, and similar to values of ̃0.18 for the "lherzolitic" shergottites. Initial ∊<SUB>Nd</SUB> for NWA 1460/480 at 350 ± 16 Ma ago was +10.6 ± 0.5, which implies a time-averaged <SUP>147</SUP>Sm/ <SUP>144</SUP>Nd of 0.217 in the Martian mantle prior to mafic melt extraction, similar to values of 0.211-0.216 for the "lherzolitic" shergottites. These time-averaged values do not imply a simple two-stage mantle/melt evolution, but must result from multiple episodes of melt extractions from the source regions. Much higher "late-stage" ∊<SUB>Nd</SUB> values for the depleted shergottites imply similar processes carried to a greater degree. Thus, NWA 1460/480, the "lherzolitic" shergottites and perhaps EET 79001 give the best (albeit imperfect) estimate of the Sr- and Nd-isotopic characteristics of bulk silicate Mars.
2009E&PSL.288..564H|2009|Cosmic-ray exposure histories of Martian meteorites studied from neutron capture reactions of Sm and Gd isotopes|Hidaka, Hiroshi, Yoneda, Shigekazu, Nishiizumi, Kunihiko|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|288|3-4|564|The isotopic compositions of Sm and Gd in twelve Martian meteorites, ALH 77005, ALH 84001, DaG 735, Dhofar 019, EET 79001, Lafayette, Los Angeles, Nakhla, SaU 005, Y 000593, Y 000749 and Zagami, were determined to quantify the neutron capture records of individual meteorite specimens. Seven of these twelve samples, ALH 84001, Y 000749, DaG 735, Dhofar 019, EET 79001, SaU 005 and Zagami, showed significant isotopic shifts of <SUP>150</SUP>Sm/ <SUP>149</SUP>Sm and/or <SUP>158</SUP>Gd/ <SUP>157</SUP>Gd corresponding to neutron fluences of (0.7-3.4) × 10 <SUP>15</SUP> n cm <SUP>- 2 </SUP>. Among these seven meteorites, the neutron fluences of ALH 84001, Y 000749, and Dhofar 019 apparently correlated with their cosmic-ray exposure ages, indicating that most of the irradiation took place while the meteoroids were small bodies in space after the ejection from Mars. However, our results suggest an accumulation of their inherited irradiation occurred on Mars. On the other hand, the exposure histories of the other four meteorites (basaltic shergottites), DaG 735, EET 79001, SaU 005, and Zagami, cannot be explained as single- or multistage irradiations in space, or as a single irradiation on the Martian surface. The mixing between basaltic lava with a significantly irradiated Martian regolith is a reasonable interpretation of the excess neutron capture records observed in these four basaltic shergottites.

A.|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|38|12|1773|We examine the occurrences, textures, and compositional patterns of spinels in the olivine- phyric shergottites Sayh al Uhaymir (SaU) 005, lithology A of Elephant Moraine A79001 (EET-A), Dhofar 019, and Northwest Africa (NWA) 1110, as well as the lherzolitic shergottite Allan Hills (ALH) A77005, in order to identify spinel-olivine-pyroxene assemblages for the determination of oxygen fugacity (using the oxybarometer of Wood [1991]) at several stages of crystallization. In all of these basaltic martian rocks, chromite was the earliest phase and crystallized along a trend of strict Cr-Al variation. Spinel (chromite) crystallization was terminated by the appearance of pyroxene but resumed later with the appearance of ulvospinel. Ulvospinel formed overgrowths on early chromites (except those shielded as inclusions in olivine or pyroxene), retaining the evidence of the spinel stability gap in the form of a sharp core/rim boundary (except in ALH A77005, where subsolidus reequilibration diffused this boundary). Secondary effects seen in chromites include reaction with melt before ulvospinel overgrowth, reaction with melt inclusions, reaction with olivine hosts (in ALH A77005), and exsolution of ulvospinel or ilmenite. All chromites experienced subsolidus Fe/Mg reequilibration. Spinel-olivine-pyroxene assemblages representing the earliest stages of crystallization in each rock essentially consist of the highest-Cr#, lowest-fe# chromites not showing secondary effects plus the most magnesian olivine and equilibrium low-Ca pyroxene. Assemblages representing the onset of ulvospinel crystallization consist of the lowest-Ti ulvospinel, the most magnesian olivine in which ulvospinel occurs as inclusions, and equilibrium low-Ca pyroxene. The results show that, for early crystallization conditions, oxygen fugacity (fO2) increases from SaU 005 and Dhofar 019 (~QFM -3.8), to EET-A (QFM -2.8) and ALH A77005 (QFM -2.6), to NWA 1110 (QFM -1.7). Estimates for later conditions indicate that in SaU 005 and Dhofar 019 oxidation state did not change during crystallization. In EET-A, there was an increase in fO2 that may have been due to mixing of reduced material with a more oxidized magma. In NWA 1110, there was a dramatic increase, indicating a non-buffered system, possibly related to its high oxidation state. Differences in fO2 among shergottites are not primarily due to igneous fractionation but, rather, to derivation from (and possibly mixing of) different reservoirs.
2003GeCoA..67.3735G|2003|Petrogenesis of olivine-phyric shergottites Sayh al Uhaymir 005 and Elephant Moraine A79001 lithology A|Goodrich, Cyrena Anne|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|67|19|3735|Martian meteorites Sayh al Uhaymir (SaU) 005 and lithology A of EETA79001 (EET-A) belong to a newly emerging group of olivine-phyric shergottites. Previous models for the origin of such shergottites have focused on mixing between basaltic shergottite-like magmas and lherzolitic shergottite-like material. Results of this work, however, suggest that SaU 005 and EET-A formed from olivine-saturated magmas that may have been parental to basaltic shergottites. SaU 005 and EET-A have porphyritic textures of large (up to ̃3 mm) olivine crystals (̃25% in SaU 005; ̃13% in EET-A) in finer-grained groundmasses consisting principally of pigeonite (̃50% in SaU 005; ̃60% in EET-A), plagioclase (maskelynite) and < 7% augite. Low-Ti chromite occurs as inclusions in the more magnesian olivine, and with chromian ulvöspinel rims in the more ferroan olivine and the groundmass. Crystallization histories for both rocks were determined from petrographic features (textures, crystal shapes and size distributions, phase associations, and modal abundances), mineral compositions, and melt compositions reconstructed from magmatic inclusions in olivine and chromite. The following observations indicate that the chromite and most magnesian olivine (Fo 74-70 in SaU 005; Fo 81-77 in EET-A) and pyroxenes (low-Ca pyroxene [Wo 4-6] of mg 77-74 and augite of mg 78 in SaU 005; orthopyroxene [Wo 3-5] of mg 84-80 in EET-A) in these rocks are xenocrystic. (1) Olivine crystal size distribution (CSD) functions show excesses of the largest crystals (whose cores comprise the most magnesian compositions), indicating addition of phenocrysts or xenocrysts. (2) The most magnesian low-Ca pyroxenes show near-vertical trends of mg vs. Al <SUB>2</SUB>O <SUB>3</SUB> and Cr <SUB>2</SUB>O <SUB>3</SUB>, which suggest reaction with a magma. (3) In SaU 005, there is a gap in augite composition between mg 78 and 73. (4) Chromite cores of composite spinel grains are riddled with cracks, indicating that they experienced some physical stress before being overgrown with ulvöspinel. (5) Magmatic inclusions are absent in the most magnesian olivine, but abundant in the more ferroan, indicating slower growth rates for the former. (6) The predicted early crystallization sequence of the melt trapped in chromite (the earliest phase) in each rock produces its most magnesian olivine-pyroxene assemblage. However, in neither case is the total crystallization sequence of this melt consistent with the overall crystallization history of the rock or its bulk modal mineralogy. Further, the following observations indicate that in both SaU 005 and EET-A the fraction of solid xenocrystic or xenolithic material is small (in contrast to previous models for EET-A), and most of the material in the rock formed by continuous crystallization of a single magma (possibly mixed). (1) CSD functions and correlations of crystal size with composition show that most of the olivine (Fo 69-62 in SaU 005; Fo 76-53 in EET-A) formed by continuous nucleation and growth. (2) Groundmass pigeonites are in equilibrium with this olivine, and show continuous compositional trends that are typical for basalts. (3) The CSD function for groundmass pigeonite in EET-A indicates continuous nucleation and growth (Lentz and McSween, 2000). (4) The melt trapped in olivine of Fo 76 to 67 in EET-A has a predicted crystallization sequence similar to that inferred for most of the rock and produces an assemblage similar to its modal mineralogy. (5) Melt trapped in late olivine (Fo ̃ 64) in SaU 005 has a composition consistent with the inferred late crystallization history of the rock. The conclusion that only a small fraction of either SaU 005 or EET-A is xenocrystic or xenolithic implies that both rocks lost fractionated liquids in the late stages of crystallization. This is supported by: (1) high pigeonite/plagioclase ratios; (2) low augite contents; and (3) olivine CSD functions, which show a drop in nucleation rate at high degrees of crystallization, consistent with loss of liquid. For EET-A, this fractionated liquid may be represented by EET-B.

D., Lentz, R. C., Clayton, R. N., Mayeda, T. K.|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|37|8|1107|Dhofar 019 is a new martian meteorite found in the desert of Oman. In texture, mineralogy, and major and trace element chemistry, this meteorite is classified as a basaltic shergottite. Olivine megacrysts are set within a groundmass composed of finer grained olivine, pyroxene (pigeonite and augite), and maskelynite. Minor phases are chromite-ulvöspinel, ilmenite, silica, K-rich feldspar, merrillite, chlorapatite, and pyrrhotite. Secondary phases of terrestrial origin include calcite, gypsum, celestite, Fe hydroxides, and smectite. Dhofar 019 is most similar to the Elephant Moraine (EETA) 79001 lithology A and Dar al Gani (DaG) 476/489 shergottites. The main features that distinguish Dhofar 019 from other shergottites are lack of orthopyroxene; lower Ni contents of olivine; the heaviest oxygen-isotopic bulk composition; and larger compositional ranges for olivine, maskelynite, and spinel, as well as a wide range for pyroxenes. The large compositional ranges of the minerals are indicative of relatively rapid crystallization. Modeling of olivine chemical zonations yield minimum cooling rates of 0.5-0.8 ?C/h. Spinel chemistry suggests that crystallization took place under one of the most reduced conditions for martian meteorites, at an oxygen fugacity of 3 log units below the quartz-fayalite-magnetite (QFM) buffer. The olivine megacrysts are heterogeneously distributed in the rock. Crystal size distribution analysis suggests that they constitute a population formed under steady-state conditions of nucleation and growth, although a few grains may be cumulates. The parent melt is thought to have been derived from partial melting of a light rare earth element- and platinum group element-depleted mantle source. Shergottites, EETA79001 lithology A, DaG 476/489, and Dhofar 019, although of different ages, comprise a particular type of martian rocks. Such rocks could have formed from chemically similar source(s) and parent melt(s), with their bulk compositions affected by olivine accumulation.

Planetary Microcosm Bioassays of Martian and Carbonaceous Chondrite Materials: Nutrients, Electrolyte Solutions, and Algal and Plant Responses|Mautner, Michael N.|Icarus|158|1|72|The biological fertilities of planetary materials can be assessed using microcosms based on meteorites. This study applies microcosm tests to martian meteorites and analogues and to carbonaceous chondrites. The biological fertilities of these materials are rated based on the soluble electrolyte nutrients, the growth of mesophile and cold-tolerant algae, and plant tissue cultures. The results show that the meteorites, in particular the Murchison CM2 carbonaceous chondrite and DaG 476 martian shergottite, contain high levels of water-extractable Ca, Mg, and SO <SUB>4</SUB>-S. The martian meteorites DaG 476 and EETA 79001 also contain higher levels of extractable essential nutrients NO <SUB>3</SUB>-N (0.013-0.017 g kg <SUP>-1</SUP>) and PO <SUB>4</SUB>-P (0.019-0.046 g kg <SUP>-1</SUP>) than the terrestrial analogues. The yields of most of the water-extractable electrolytes vary only by factors of 2-3 under a wide range of planetary conditions. However, the long-term extractable phosphate increases significantly under a CO <SUB>2</SUB> atmosphere. The biological yields of algae and plant tissue cultures correlate with extractable NO <SUB>3</SUB>-N and PO <SUB>4</SUB>-P, identifying these as the limiting nutrients. Mesophilic algae and Asparagus officinalis cultures are identified as useful bioassay agents. A fertility rating system based on microcosm tests is proposed. The results rate the fertilities in the order martian basalts > terrestrial basalt, agricultural soil > carbonaceous chondrites, lava ash > cumulate igneous rock. The results demonstrate the application of planetary microcosms in experimental astroecology to rate planetary materials as targets for astrobiology exploration and as potential space bioresources. For example, the extractable materials in Murchison suggest that concentrated internal solutions in carbonaceous asteroids (3.8 mol L <SUP>-1</SUP> electrolytes and 10 g L <SUP>-1</SUP> organics) can support and disperse microorganisms introduced by natural or directed panspermia in early solar systems. The results also suggest that carbonaceous asteroids and martian basalts can serve as potential future resources for substantial biological populations in the Solar System.

S., Masarik, J.|Icarus|156|2|352|Impact-produced glasses in some martian meteorites have trapped significant amounts of the recent martian atmosphere. From literature data, we estimate that ̃9% of the trapped <SUP>80</SUP>Kr in these meteorites was produced from neutron capture on <SUP>79</SUP>Br. Estimates of neutron fluences made from <SUP>80</SUP>Kr and <SUP>149</SUP>Sm for bulk samples of meteorite EET79001 indicate that <SUP>80</SUP>Kr excesses in the impact glass were not produced in situ. Theoretical calculations independently predict production of a large neutron-capture component of <SUP>80</SUP>Kr and <SUP>36</SUP>Ar in the martian regolith, and part of this component presumably escaped into the martian atmosphere. These calculations were made by using the Los Alamos High-Energy Transport Code to calculate the fluxes of galactic cosmic ray (GCR)-produced thermal neutrons as a function of depth in the uppermost 500 g cm <SUP>-2</SUP> of the martian surface, and by adopting average Cl, Br, and I concentrations of the upper martian surface of ̃0.3%, ̃20 ppm, and ̃0.5 ppm, respectively. Combining these data with the appropriate neutron-capture cross sections, we calculate Mars global production rates of <SUP>80</SUP>Kr <SUB>n</SUB>=2.4×10 <SUP>16</SUP>atoms sec <SUP>-1</SUP>, <SUP>36</SUP>Ar <SUB>n</SUB>=5.5×10 <SUP>18</SUP> atoms sec <SUP>-1</SUP>, and <SUP>128</SUP>Xe <SUB>n</SUB>=3×10 <SUP>13</SUP> atoms sec <SUP>-1</SUP>. Calculated global production rates of spallogenic <SUP>80</SUP>Kr <SUB>sp</SUB>, and <SUP>36</SUP>Ar <SUB>sp</SUB>, are smaller by factors of ̃770 and ̃29, respectively. It would require ̃330 Myr to produce an amount of <SUP>80</SUP>Kr <SUB>n</SUB> equivalent to the amount inferred to be present today in the martian atmosphere (̃2.5×10 <SUP>32</SUP> atoms). Production of these neutron-capture components probably has occurred over the past ̃4 Gyr, as only an atmospheric pressure substantially higher than today's would appreciably decrease the neutron flux in the regolith. Thus, most of the neutron-capture noble gases produced over time probably remain in the martian regolith and would make sensitive indicators of the time period a sample has resided near the martian surface. Assuming mixing of the martian surface to an average depth of 100 m, the predicted average regolith concentrations of <SUP>80</SUP>Kr <SUB>n</SUB>, <SUP>36</SUP>Ar <SUB>n</SUB>, and <SUP>128</SUP>Xe <SUB>n</SUB> are ̃4×10 <SUP>-9</SUP> cm <SUP>-3</SUP> g <SUP>-1</SUP>, ̃1×10 <SUP>-6</SUP> cm <SUP>3</SUP> g <SUP>-1</SUP>, and ̃5×10 <SUP>-12</SUP> cm <SUP>3</SUP> g <SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively. If similar fractions of these neutron-capture isotopes have escaped into the atmosphere, they would comprise ̃3% and ̃0.2% of the present atmospheric inventories of <SUP>36</SUP>Ar and <SUP>128</SUP>Xe, respectively. The fractional excess of <SUP>80</SUP>Kr <SUB>n</SUB> in ancient martian meteorite ALH84001 appears similar to that in shock-glass phases of young shergottite meteorites. If ALH84001 acquired its atmospheric gases ̃4 Gyr ago, this implies that, prior to that time, halogens were greatly concentrated at the martian surface by crustal formational and weathering processes, impacts efficiently degassed the regolith, and Mars did not have a significant atmosphere to shield the surface.

In this context, the solubility of phosphate is measured in planetary materials, represented by the Mars meteorites Nakhla, Dar al Gani 476 (DaG 476), Elephant Morraine 79001 (EETA 79001), and terrestrial analogs, and in the Murchison CM2 and Allende CV3 carbonaceous chondrites. The Mars meteorites contain high levels of phosphate that is readily extracted by water, up to 15 mg kg <SUP>-1</SUP> in Nakhla and DaG 476 and 38 mg kg <SUP>-1</SUP> in EETA 79001, while the terrestrial analogs and the carbonaceous chondrites contain 0.5 to 6 mg kg <SUP>-1</SUP>. Correspondingly, high phosphate concentrations of 4 to >28 mg L <SUP>-1</SUP> are obtained in extracts of the Mars meteorites at high solid/solution ratios, exceeding the concentrations of 0.4 to 2.0 mg L <SUP>-1</SUP> in the extracts of the terrestrial analogs. A wide range of planetary conditions, including N <SUB>2</SUB> and CO <SUB>2</SUB> atmospheres, solid/solution ratios of 0.01 to 1.0 kg L <SUP>-1</SUP>, extraction times of 1 to 21 d, and temperatures of 20 to 121°C affect the amounts of extractable phosphate by factors of only 2 to 5 in most materials. Phosphate-fixing capacity and exchangeable phosphate are assessed by the isotopic exchange kinetics (IEK) method, which quantifies the amount of P isotopically exchangeable within 1 min (E <SUB>1min</SUB>) and between 1 min and 3 months (E <SUB>1min-3m</SUB>) and the amount of P that cannot be exchanged within 3 months (E <SUB>>3m</SUB>). The IEK results show that the DaG 476 Mars meteorite and terrestrial analogs have low P-fixing capacities, while the carbonaceous chondrites have high P-fixing capacities. Aqueous processing under early planetary CO <SUB>2</SUB> atmospheres has large effects on the available phosphate. For example, the fraction of total P that is exchangeable in 3 months increases from 1.6 to 11%, 13 to 51.6%, and 43.9 to 90.4% in the DaG 476 Mars meteorite, Allende, and Murchison, respectively. The results show that solutions with high phosphate concentrations can form in the pores of planetary lava ash and basalts and in carbonaceous asteroids and meteorites. These solutions can help prebiotic synthesis and early microbial nutrition. The Martian and carbonaceous chondrite materials contain sufficient phosphate for space-based agriculture.

N.|Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors|117|1-4|421|In this study, we use the technique of petrophysical modeling [Sobolev, S.V., Babeyko, A.Yu., 1994. Modelling of mineralogical composition, density and elastic wave velocities in the anhydrous rocks. Surv. Geophys. 15, 515-544.] to construct mineralogical, density, and velocity models of the deep Martian crust. Calculations are performed in two steps. First, given bulk chemical composition and PT conditions, the equilibrium mineralogical composition is calculated by numerical thermodynamic simulation. Effect of kinetics on mineral transformations was modeled by accepting a "freezing" temperature. Second, density and velocities are calculated from the mineralogy. In computations, bulk chemical composition of the crust was accepted to be the average of four basaltic SNC meteorites (Shergotty, Zagami, BETA79001, lithologies A and B). Four various temperature models of the crust were considered: with the temperature gradient of 21, 13, 6, and 2 K/km. The mineral composition of the consolidated crust varies with depth due to a gabbro-eclogite type transition; density and velocities increase correspondingly. The generally accepted data on the structure of the outer layer of the Moon are taken into account in modeling the outer (̃11 km), porous layer of the planet. The maximum thickness of the crust was determined from the condition that the density at the crust-mantle boundary equals 3.45-3.5 g/cm <SUP>3</SUP>. The computations showed that, in the case of a cold marsotherm, the crustal density at a depth of 60 km ranges from 3.3 to 3.5 g/cm <SUP>3</SUP>, and at a depth of 120 km, it is ̃3.5 g/cm <SUP>3</SUP>. In the case of a hot marsotherm, the density 3.45 g/cm <SUP>3</SUP> is reached at a depth of 150 km; 3.5 g/cm <SUP>3</SUP>, at a depth of ̃170 km. The consolidated crust may be divided into several zones according to the distribution of density and its seismic-wave velocities. Regions with a high heat flow have a low velocity (and density) zone in the 10-120-km depth range, underlain by a zone of steep gradients of these parameters. For small temperature gradients, computations yield a qualitatively different picture. In the ̃10 to (30-65)-km depth range, the density and velocities are approximately constant. From 30-65 to 80-120 km follows a zone of steep gradients. Below velocities and density are nearly constant or slightly decrease down to the crust-mantle boundary. Since density in the lowermost crust exceeds values of ̃3.5 g/cm <SUP>3</SUP>, the lower crust is likely to be gravitationally unstable over geologic time intervals.
2000M&PS...35..919L|2000|Crystallization of the basaltic shergottites: Insights from crystal size distribution (CSD) analysis of pyroxenes|Lentz, Rachel C. F., McSween, Harry Y., Jr.|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|35|5|919|Quantitative petrographic analysis, using the crystal size distribution (CSD) method, provides a novel approach for examining the crystallization histories of basaltic shergottites. Grain number densities at different sizes are plotted against grain size, and the resulting curve relates to the geologic processes involved with the crystallization of the grain population. Most basaltic shergottites are dominated by pigeonite and augite, and since plagioclase is primarily interstitial, and therefore constrained in its growth by the surrounding pyroxenes, we limited our size measurements to the pyroxene phases. The groundmasses of EET A79001 lithology A and DaG 476 are fine-grained with cumulus pyroxene and interstitial plagioclase glass. Their simple linear CSD plots record a single stage of pyroxene crystallization under steady state conditions of continuous nucleation and growth. The textures of QUE 94201 and EET A79001 lithology B are quite different from the other shergottites, with intergrown pyroxene and plagioclase. Likewise, their CSD plots are also distinct, with curved trends suggesting a lack of large grains, most likely due to interference between simultaneously growing silicate phases. However, the CSD plot shapes are smooth, also implying a single stage of growth. Shergotty and Zagami, with coarser cumulus textures, display CSD plots that are generally linear over most grain sizes. This implies that conditions of nucleation and growth were dominant during formation of the pyroxene populations. Both plots, however, also display kinks, implying multiple stages of growth. A similar kink is also visible in a CSD plot of only the Mg-rich cores of Shergotty pyroxenes, suggesting the feature represents changes in conditions during core crystallization, rather than an event coincident with the change in composition to the Fe-rich rims. The plot may be interpreted as representing two stages of core growth with an intervening short hiatus of nucleation, with continued crystallization associated with ascent of the magma. Eruption onto the surface probably triggered the compositional change to Fe-rich rims. CSD analysis of products from a controlled crystallization study agree with experimental and petrologic estimates that cooling rates for Zagami were on the order of a few tenths of a degree per hour. Growth rates derived from these cooling rates suggest crystallization of Shergotty and Zagami pyroxenes occurred over a period of a few weeks to months.

S.|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|34|6|853|Previous studies of Apollo 17 double drive tube 79001/2 showed that portions of this lunar regolith segment have some unusual properties, such as very high Is/FeO values (Morris et al., 1989) and nitrogen contents (Stone and Clayton, 1989). To understand the geologic significance of these features in this core, we determined the grain-size distribution and modal abundance of the petrographic constituents for samples from 12 depths of the core. Also, we measured the elemental and isotopic compositions of noble gases in the coarse-grained (150-250?m) and fine-grained (<20?m) sample fractions from 4 depths of this core. The agglutinate abundance and 36Ar contents show depth-related variations similar to those observed for Is/FeO and nitrogen in this core. Samples from the top (~0.5 cm depth) and the bottom (~45 cm depth) of the drive tube are related to Apollo 17 sub-mature soils with ~250-300 Ma GCR (galactic cosmic ray) exposure age. But the soil at the top of the drive tube received additional surface irradiation for ~2 Ma after deposition at Van Serg. The samples at intermediate depths i.e. ~7 cm (upper zone) and ~20 cm (lower zone) of the 79001/2 core show features characteristic of mixtures of Apollo 17 mature soils and finely comminuted regolith breccias having ~600-800 Ma GCR exposure age. The mixing ratios between the coarse and fine fractions of the intermediate-depth samples are similar to each other. Though the mixing ratios for the samples from the top and the bottom of the core are also similar to each other, they differ significantly from the ratios at intermediate depths. The results presented here are consistent with the two component Van Serg core model proposed by Stone and Clayton (1989) and McKay et al. (1988).
1999M&PS...34..357M|1999|An impact melt origin for Lithology A of Martian meteorite EETA79001|Mittlefehldt, David W., Lindstrom, David J., Lindstrom, Marilyn M., Martinez, Rene R.|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|34|3|357|Mixing models using major and trace elements show that the bulk composition of lithology A (xenocryst-bearing magnesian basalt) of EETA79001 can be reasonably approximated as a simple mixture of ~44% EETA79001 lithology B (ferroan basalt) and ~56% of ALHA77005 light lithology (incompatible element-poor lherzolite). Micro-INAA data on xenocryst-free groundmass samples of lithology A show that about 20-25% of the melt phase could be dissolved lherzolite. The bulk and groundmass samples of lithology A have excesses in Au, indicating either meteoritic contamination or addition by some unknown martian geochemical process. Previous workers have suggested that lithology A was formed by either assimilation of cumulates like ALHA77005 by a basalt like lithology B, or by mixing of basaltic and lherzolitic magmas. The former scenario is energetically improbable and unlikely to explain the normal Fe/Mg zonation in lithology A groundmass pyroxenes, while the latter is unlikely to satisfy the constraints of the mixing model indicating the ultramafic component is poor in incompatible elements. We suggest rather that EETA79001 lithology A is an impact melt composed dominantly of basalt like lithology B and lherzolitic cumulates like the trace element poor fraction of ALHA77005 or Y-793605. This model can satisfy the energetic, petrologic and geochemical constraints imposed by the samples. If EETA79001 lithology A is an impact melt, this would have considerable consequences for current models of martian petrologic evolution. It would call into question the generally accepted age of magmatism of martian basalts, and preclude the use of lithology A groundmass as a primary martian basalt composition in experimental studies. Regardless, the latter is required because lithology A groundmass is a hybrid composition.
1999GeCoA..63.2105W|1999|Origin of planetary cores: Evidence from highly siderophile elements in Martian meteorites|Warren, Paul H., Kallemeyn, Gregory W., Kyte, Frank T.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|63|13|2105|We present new bulk compositional data for 6 martian meteorites, including highly siderophile elements Ni, Re, Os, Ir and Au. These and literature data are utilized for comparison versus the siderophile systematics of igneous rocks from Earth, the Moon, and the HED asteroid. The siderophile composition of ALH84001 is clearly anomalous. Whether this reflects a more reducing environment on primordial Mars when this ancient rock first crystallized, or secondary alteration, is unclear. QUE94201 shows remarkable similarity with EET79001-B for siderophile as well as lithophile elements; both are extraordinarily depleted in the "noblest" siderophiles (Os and Ir), to roughly 0.00001 × CI chondrites. As in terrestrial igneous rocks, among martian rocks Ni, Os and Ir show strong correlations vs. MgO. In the case of MgO vs. Ni, the martian trend is displaced toward lower Ni by a large factor (5), but the Os and Ir trends are not significantly displaced from their terrestrial counterparts. For Mars, Re shows a rough correlation with MgO, indicating compatible behavior, in contrast to its mildly incompatible behavior on Earth. Among martian MgO-rich rocks, Au shows a weak anticorrelation vs. MgO, resembling the terrestrial distribution except for a displacement toward 2-3 times lower Au. The same elements (Ni, Re, Os, Ir and Au) show similar correlations with Cr substituted for MgO. Data for lunar and HED rocks generally show less clear-cut trends (relatively few MgO-rich samples are available). These trends are exploited to infer the compositions of the primitive Earth, Mars, Moon and HED mantles, by assuming that the trend intercepts the bulk MgO or Cr content of the primitive mantle at the approximate primitive mantle concentration of the siderophile element. Results for Earth show good agreement with earlier estimates. For Mars, the implied primitive mantle composition is remarkably similar to the Earth's, except for 5 times lower Ni. The best constrained of the extremely siderophile elements, Os and Ir, are present in the martian mantle at 0.005 times CI, in comparison to 0.007 times CI in Earth's mantle. This similarity constitutes a key constraint on the style of core-mantle differentiation in both Mars and Earth. Successful models should predict similarly high concentrations of noble siderophile elements in both the martian and terrestrial mantles ("high" compared to the lunar and HED mantles, and to models of simple partitioning at typical low-pressure magmatic temperatures), but only predict high Ni for the Earth's mantle. Models that engender the noble siderophile excess in Earth's mantle through a uniquely terrestrial process, such as a Moon-forming giant impact, have difficulty explaining the similarity of outcome (except for Ni) on Mars. The high Ni content of the terrestrial mantle is probably an effect traceable to Earth's size. For the more highly siderophile elements like Os and Ir, the simplest model consistent with available constraints is the veneer hypothesis. Core-mantle differentiation was notably inefficient on the largest terrestrial planets, because during the final ̃ 1% of accretion these bodies acquired sufficient H <SUB>2</SUB>O to oxidize most of the later-accreting Fe-metal, thus eliminating the carrier phase for segregation of siderophile elements into the core.

It also contains impact melt. Complex zoning patterns in QUE94201 pyroxenes revealed by elemental map analyses using an electron microprobe suggest a crystallization sequence from Mg-rich pigeonite (En62Fs30Wo8) to extremely Fe-rich pigeonite (En5Fs81Wo14) via {110} Mg-rich augite bands (En44Fs20Wo36) in a single crystal. These textures, along with the abundant plagioclase (maskelynite), indicates single-stage rapid cooling (> 5 oC/yr) of this rock from a supercooled magma. Transition from Mg-rich augite to Fe-rich pigeonite reflects the onset of plagioclase crystallization. Enrichment of late-stage phases in QUE94201 implies crystallization from an evolved magma and suggests a different parent magma composition from the other basaltic shergottites. Lithology B of EETA79001 basaltic shergottite contains pyroxenes that show complex zoning with augite bands similar to those in QUE94201 pyroxene, suggesting similar one-stage rapid cooling. Lithology B of EETA79001 also resembles QUE94201 in its coarse-grained texture of silicates and its high abundance of maskelynite, although QUE94201 probably crystallized from a more fractionated magma. We also note that some Apollo lunar mare basalts (e.g., 12020 and 12021) have similar mineralogy and petrology to QUE94201, especially in pyroxene zoning. All these basaltic rocks with complex pyroxene zoning suggest rapid metastable crystallization from supercooled magmas.

W.|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|32|6|803|The magnetic properties of samples of seven Martian meteorites (EET79001, Zagami, Nakhla, Lafayette, Governador Yaladares, Chassigny and ALH 84001) have been investigated. All possess a weak, very stable primary natural remanent rnagnetization (NRM), and some have less stable secondary components. In some cases the latter are associated with magnetic contamination of the samples, imparted since their recovery, and with viscous magnetization, acquired during exposure of the meteorites to the geomagnetic field since they fell. The magnetic properties are carried by a small content (<1%) of titanomagnetite and, in ALH 84001, possibly by magnetite as well. The most likely source of the primary NRM is a thermoremanent magnetization, acquired when the meteorite material last cooled from a high temperature in the presence of a magnetic field. Current evidence is that this was 1.3 Ga ago for the nakhlites and Chassigny and 180 Ma for shergottites: the time of the last relevant cooling of ALH 84001 is not presently known. Preliminary estimates of the strength of the magnetizing field are in the range 0.5-5 deg T, at least an order of magnitude greater than the present field. It is tentatively concluded that the magnetic field was generated by a dynamo process in a Martian core with appropriate structure and properties.

QUE94201, a recently discovered basaltic shergottite, contains coarse-grained, complexly-zoned crystals of pyroxene. The QUE94201 pyroxene is zoned from Mg-rich pigeonite cores through an intermediate zone of Mg-rich augite and then to extremely Fe-rich pigeonite rims. This unique zoning of pyroxene has been reported from Apollo lunar mare basalts; however, no similar zoning of pyroxene has been reported from Martian meteorites. We have surveyed pyroxenes of Martian meteorites, especially shergottites using an elemental mapping technique by JEOL JXA8900L electron microprobe, and found that pyroxenes from lithology B of EETA79001 show similar complex zoning to QUE94201 pyroxenes. Zoning of this type has not been detected from pyroxenes in Zagami, ALH77005, LEW88516, and Y793605. The affinity of zoning pattern and chemical composition between QUE94201 and EETA79001B pyroxenes indicate similar crystallization condition of these shergottites, although QUE94201 is more enriched in late-crystallized phases.

The core is a mixture of basalt and highland fragments, lithics, agglutinates, and impact and volcanic glasses. The core is significantly different from the 74001/2 core taken on the rim of the impact crater Shorty. While the 74001/2 core is composed of only orange glasses and their crystallized equivalents and therefore represents a stratigraphic section at depth, the 79001/2 core represents a mixture of components making up the regolith. Our interest in the 79001/2 core was to search for volcanic glasses and determine their relationship to those found at Shorty. Each of the 19 thin sections in the Van Serg core was studied and glasses were identified. Impact and volcanic glasses that had a unique texture were compositionally analyzed, as were 128 glasses from two thin sections in the core.

The latter one was separated into orthopyroxene, chromite, and maskelynite fractions. Ejection times were calculated for all Martian meteorites using cosmic-ray exposure ages based on <SUP>3</SUP>He, <SUP>21</SUP>Ne, and <SUP>38</SUP>Ar concentrations and literature data on the terrestrial ages. We discuss the arguments for a scenario in which they were ejected from Mars by asteroidal or cometary impact as small meteoroids and were delivered to Earth within and up to 15 million years. The basaltic shergottites QUE94201, Shergotty, and Zagami show an ejection age cluster at 2.76 Ma, the fourth basaltic shergottite EET79001 being younger (0.82 Ma). Lherzolites LEW88516 and ALH77005 were ejected by a later event 3.84 Ma ago. All nakhlites, Nakhla, Governador Valadares, and Lafayette, originate from an event 11.0 Ma ago. Although Chassigny is chemically distinct from the nakhlites, its ejection age is 11.6 Ma. Whether this is a separate event cannot be decided from the available data. Finally, orthopyroxenite ALH84001 was launched from Mars 14.4 Ma ago. The distribution of the delivery times for Martian meteorites to Earth reflect individual impact events onto five or six different source terrains. This result is significant in the context of a comprehensive knowledge of the Martian crust composition. Finally, we derived the K- <SUP>40</SUP>Ar gas retention age of ALH84001 mineral fractions adopting two different models: Assuming a component of Martian atmospheric Ar with <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/<SUP>36</SUP>Ar = 1790 trapped by this meteorite we obtained an age of 3390 Ma. On the other hand, assuming no contribution of Martian atmospheric Ar, the resulting K- <SUP>40</SUP>Ar age is about 4100 Ma, that is, roughly 500 Ma younger than the reported SmNd crystallization age.

ALH84001, a newly recognized martian orthopyroxenite, has a high <SUP>129</SUP>Xe/<SUP>132</SUP>Xe ratio (≈2.1), which is similar to that observed for the glass portion (lithology C) of shergottite EETA79001. The elemental ratios of trapped Ar, Kr, and Xe, the cosmic-ray exposure age (14.5 ± 1.8 m.y.) and the KAr age (3-4 b.y.) of ALH84001 are not identical with those of EETA79001 or any other martian meteorite. Therefore, ALH84001 may not originate from the same area as the other martian meteorites. The noble gas data of ALH77005 shergottite are compatible with previously reported data. Argon, Kr, and Xe are heavily contaminated by elementally fractionated terrestrial atmospheric gases. A cosmic-ray exposure age of 2.9 ± 0.7 m.y. and a KAr age of 1.33 ± 0.13 b.y. were obtained for this meteorite.

Electron microprobe analyses of glasses from the double drive tube 79001/2 (90-150 μm size fraction of soils from mean depths of 0.8-16.8 cm) indicate that 34 of 90 (38%) are of VLT composition. A subset of twenty glasses was removed from the thin sections using a micro-coring device and analyzed using special micro-INAA techniques to obtain major and trace element abundances. On the basis of the results, we delineate three distinct groups which have been named for their relative amounts of Co: HICo, MECo, and LOCo Apollo 17 VLTs. The most magnesian HICo basalt glasses (4 of 34, or about 12% of the VLT glasses) are probably pristine pyroclastics. Soil breccias 79135 and 70295 apparently contain only this type of VLT glass. The medium-Co MECo glasses (6 of 34, 18%) strongly resemble the largest sample of VLT composition, the olivine vitrophyre 78526, as well as all three of the Apollo 17 VLT lithic fragments that have been analyzed for trace elements. The LOCo VLT glasses (23 of 34, 68%) are more enigmatic. Trace element concentrations require that these three VLT compositions cannot be related by simple igneous processes. The distribution of the three types provides important information on the sequence of events that produced the regolith at the Apollo 17 site.

S.|Geology of the Apollo 17 Landing Site|||29|The Apollo 17 double drive tube 79001/2 (station 9, Van Serg Crater) is distinctive because of its extreme maturity, abundance, and variety of glass clasts. It contains mare glasses of both high Ti and very low Ti (VLT) compositions, and highland glasses of all compositions common in lunar regolith samples: highland basalt (feldspathic; Al2O3 greater than 23 wt percent), KREEP (Al2O3 less than 23 wt percent, K2O greater than 0.25 wt percent), and low-K Fra Mauro (LKFM; Al2O3 less than 23 wt percent, K2O less than 0.25 wt percent). It also contains rare specimens of high-alumina, silica-poor (HASP), and ultra Mg glasses. HASP glasses contain insufficient SiO2 to permit the calculation of a standard norm, and are thought to be the product of volatilization during impact melting. They have been studied by electron microprobe major-element analysis techniques but have not previously been analyzed for trace elements. The samples analyzed for this study were polished grain mounts of the 90-160 micron fraction of four sieved samples from the 79001/2 core (depth range 2.3-11.5 cm). A total of 80 glasses were analyzed by SEM/EDS and electron microprobe, and a subset of 33 of the glasses, representing a wide range of compositional types, was chosen for high-sensitivity INAA. A microdrilling device removed disks (mostly 50-100 micron diameter, weighing approx. 0.1-0.5 micro-g) for INAA. Preliminary data reported here are based only on short counts done within two weeks of irradiation.

It is suggested that this enrichment may have resulted from a significant exposure at some time in the past. A soil component of metallic Fe may be related to micrometeorite impact.

N.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|19||285|Variations in abundance and isotopic composition of nitrogen in 79002/79001 drive tube samples result from mixing of two soil components: one mature, N-rich, and isotopically light, resembling breccia material in the core, and the other immature, N-poor, and isotopically heavy. That these materials are common to soil at each stratigraphic level in the core suggests widespread distribution in the local regolith. Preservation of mixing correlations involving nitrogen isotopic compositions and cosmogenic N-15 concentrations suggests relatively recent mixing, perhaps in association with emplacement of the core stratigraphy. Characteristics of nitrogen release from the endmember materials, relationships between their nitrogen contents and maturity, and contrasts in their cosmogenic N-15 contents are consistent with models involving secular increase of the N-15/N-14 ratio of the solar wind.

Conclusions presented earlier (OTT and Begemann, 1985), which were based on results for trapped Ar, Kr and Xe only, are reaffirmed by the complete set of data. These include: 1) Shergotty contains trapped gases that can be described as a mixture of the gas type found in the glass of shergottite EETA 79001 (SPB-type gases; possibly introduced by shock from the Martian atmosphere) and a second component characterized by low <SUP>36</SUP>Ar /<SUP>132</SUP>Xe , <SUP>84</SUP>Kr /<SUP>132</SUP>Xe and <SUP>129</SUP>Xe /<SUP>132</SUP>Xe . Trapped gases found in Chassigny ( <SUP>36</SUP>Ar /<SUP>132</SUP>Xe ~ 10 ; <SUP>84</SUP>Kr /<SUP>132</SUP>Xe ~ 1 ; <SUP>129</SUP>Xe /<SUP>132</SUP>Xe = 1.03 ) could be a pure sample of this second component. 2) Trapped gases in Nakhla cannot be described as such a simple mixture. 3) Xe in Chassigny has a solar-like isotopic composition, with <SUP>129</SUP>Xe /<SUP>132</SUP>Xe significantly lower than in SPB-Xe (~ 1.03 vs. ~ 2.4). If these values are characteristic for interior and atmosphere, respectively, of the SPB, the evolution of the SPB and Earth must have differed greatly. Arguments are presented that Chassigny-type gases are a better choice than (fractionated) terrestrial air for the second component, that, when mixed with SPB-gases produces the Shergotty composition. The ratios <SUP>40</SUP>Ar /<SUP>36</SUP>Ar <SUB>t</SUB> and <SUP>40</SUP>Ar /<SUP>129</SUP>Xe <SUP>∗</SUP> (where <SUP>129</SUP>Xe <SUP>∗</SUP> is <SUP>129</SUP>Xe in excess of a <SUP>129</SUP>Xe /<SUP>132</SUP>Xe ratio of ~ 1) in Shergotty agree with the respective values for EETA 79001 glass. This is taken as evidence for a late introduction of the supposedly shock implanted atmospheric component into Shergotty; it is at odds with scenarios that introduce the atmospheric component ~180 m.y. ago. Based on the variable ratio <SUP>40</SUP>Ar /<SUP>129</SUP>Xe <SUP>∗</SUP> and its unshocked nature, Nakhla acquired its excess <SUP>129</SUP>Xe by a different process. <SUP>21</SUP>Ne-based cosmic-ray exposure ages agree well with values in the literature, but do not readily agree with the younger ages based on the abundance of cosmogenic <SUP>126</SUP>Xe. Neutron capture products are present in Nakhla Kr and there is evidence for a fission-like component in Xe of both Shergotty and Nakhla. GCR interactions with the SPB are unlikely to be the reason for the low <SUP>36</SUP>Ar /<SUP>38</SUP>Ar ratio in SPB-Ar.

O.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|52|2|295|Basalt samples have been analyzed mass spectrometrically for shock-implanted noble gases, N <SUB>2</SUB>, and CO <SUB>2</SUB> after exposure to 20-60 GPa (200-600 kbar) shock in the presence of .0045-3.0 atm of ambient gas. Isotopically labelled gases were used in some samples to distinguish implanted atmospheric gases from contaminant or indigenous gases. Abundances of emplaced gases varied linearly with ambient gas pressure for constant shock pressure, and gas emplacement was most efficient in the range of 35-50 GPa shock pressure. Uncrushed samples shocked in this range gave emplacement efficiencies (number densities of gases in shocked samples/number densities in ambient gas) of 2.0-6.7% for heavy noble gases and nitrogen, while powdered samples with higher effective porosity yielded 40-50% efficiencies, indicating that ~50% of noble gases and nitrogen available in porespaces was emplaced. No elemental or isotopic fractionation was detected with Ar, Kr, Xe, or N <SUB>2</SUB>. Helium and, in some samples, Ne were lost by diffusion subsequent to shock. Emplacement efficiencies for CO <SUB>2</SUB> averaged a factor of 1.8 ± 0.2 greater than those of N <SUB>2</SUB> and noble gases in 4 samples with 20-50 GPa shock, and yielded 3.2 times greater efficiency in a sample shocked to 60 GPa. Enhanced CO <SUB>2</SUB> emplacement is thought to be due to reaction with silicate materials. Data from shergottite EETA 79001 glass may be consistent with CO <SUB>2</SUB> efficiencies a factor of 2-3 greater than noble gas efficiencies. Trapped gases in EETA 79001 glass were probably emplaced by shock. However, apparent emplacement efficiencies are somewhat higher than even shocked powder samples. Possible explanations for the difference include atmospheric overpressure at the time of shock, trapping of gas already in vugs by intruding melt material, or collapse of gas-filled vugs to form gas-laden glass inclusions. Not enough is yet known about the behavior of vugs under shock to discount the latter possibility.

To study the phenomenon of shock-implantation of gases, we artificially shocked whole-rock and powder samples of a terrestrial basalt to pressures of 2-40 GPa in the presence of controlled gas mixtures ranging from 10<SUP>-4</SUP> to 3 atmospheres. Argon, Kr, and Xe, and to a lesser extent Ne, were readily implanted into the silicate under a wide range of experimental conditions. As exemplified by Ar, the amount of implanted gas is linearly proportional to its partial pressure over a partial pressure range of 0.0001 to 0.1 atmosphere, the former value being similar to the partial pressure of Ar on Mars. The implanted gas showed no evidence of isotopic fractionation, and for Kr and Xe fractionation limits of 0.1% per mass unit could be set. The elemental composition of shock-implanted gas also closely resembles the ambient gas phase, except that Ne is only lightly retained and readily leaks from the samples after the shock. Stepwise temperature releases of gas implanted at 2, 5, 20, and 35 GPa indicate two or more lattice sites for the implanted gas that are possibly related to microcracks and other lattice defects. Activation energies, Q, for diffusion of shock-implanted gas from the samples increase dramatically with increasing shock; values of Q for Ar diffusion for the four shock levels 2, 5, 20, and 35 GPa are 7, 9, 14, and ̃25 kcal/mol, compared to 30-45 kcal/mol for typical radiogenic Ar. Diffusion of Kr and Xe is considerably slower than Ar. The amounts of gas that would have been implanted with 100% efficiency were calculated from the measured porosities of the powder samples and were compared to observed abundances. The implantation efficiencies were approximately 0.5% at 2 GPa, 7% at 5 GPa, and greater than 50% at both 20 and 35 GPa. These high gas implantation efficiencies occur for shock pressures where modest amounts of sample melting at grain boundaries begins, and they suggest that higher shock pressures generating substantial melting could not achieve appreciably greater efficiencies. These experimental data are consistent with shock-implantation of Martian gases without mass fractionation into shock-melted phases of EETA 79001; the progenitor of these melts may have been porous, fragmental material.

Phosphates have U-concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 1.3 ppm.

Sm-isotope studies, while not showing any clear cut excess in <SUP>150</SUP>Sm, enable us to derive meaningful upper limits to thermal neutron fluences of 2 to 3 × 10 <SUP>15</SUP> n/cm <SUP>2</SUP>, during a possible regolith irradiation. These limits are consistent with the track data and also enable us to derive an upper limit to the neutron exposure age of EETA 79001 of 55 Myr in the SPB regolith.
1986GeCoA..50..955C|1986|Formation ages and evolution of Shergotty and its parent planet from U-Th-Pb systematics|Chen, J. H., Wasserburg, G. J.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|50|6|955|The isotopic composition of lead was determined in different phases from Shergotty, Zagami and EETA 79001. Using phases with low <SUP>238</SUP>U /<SUP>204</SUP>Pb , the initial leads of these meteorites could be well defined and are distinct from each other and have high <SUP>204</SUP>Pb /<SUP>206</SUP>Pb (from 0.0652 to 0.0739). These leads evolved in different reservoirs over most of solar system history in a low <SUP>238</SUP>U /<SUP>204</SUP>Pb ≈ 5 environment. It follows that the parent planet of the shergottites has a high <SUP>204</SUP>Pb concentration relative to U and must also be high in other volatiles. If the parent planet of the shergottites is Mars, then this planet must be volatile-rich compared to the Earth by a factor of ~ 1.8. This implies that Mars lost its original atmosphere and that the present atmosphere was derived from a previously outgassed Martian upper mantle. The U-Th-Pb isotopic relationships involving phases with high <SUP>238</SUP>U /<SUP>204</SUP>Pb are quite regular and give ages for three shergottites which indicate an event of U-Th-Pb fractionation at ~200 m.y. The initial leads at that time were highly evolved relative to the primordial lead. The absence of substantial additions of radiogenic lead (above the initial lead) in high U phases precludes an older age for the U-Th-Pb fractionation. However, details of the data arrays are complex. The young age is in general agreement with some of the ages obtained by other methods, but precise concordance between the different methods is not established. It is suggested that the shock event that produced maskelynite may possibly be associated with the late-stage breakup at ~2.5 m.y. and not necessarily related to the ~ 180 m.y. record. The major event of chronometer resetting is taken to be ~ 180 m.y. This event does not appear to be an endogenic igneous event but an almost complete equilibration during a major impact on more ancient igneous rocks which were contained in the target. Problems of the polymetamorphic history of meteorites appear as complicated as those of polymetamorphic terrestrial terranes.
1986GeCoA..50..909L|1986|Chemical systematics of the shergotty meteorite and the composition of its parent body (Mars)|Laul, J. C., Smith, M. R., Wänke, H., Jagoutz, E., Dreibus, G., Palme, H., Spettel, B., Burghele, A., Lipschutz, M. E., Verkouteren, R. M.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|50|6|909|We report chemical data for 60 elements by INAA and RNAA in two bulk samples, for 30 elements in various mineral separates of Shergotty, and results of leaching experiments with 1M HCl on powdered aliquots of Shergotty and BETA 79001, lithologies A and B. Shergotty is homogeneous in major element composition but heterogeneous with respect to LIL trace elements (~20%). The heterogeneity is even greater for volatile and siderophile trace elements. The mineral data, including three clinopyroxene fractions with variable FeO contents, maskelynite and minor phases (Ti-magnetite, ilmenite, quartz, K-rich phase), show that major minerals do not account for the rare earth elements (REE) in the bulk meteorite. Instead, the REE are to a large extent concentrated in accessory whitlockite and apatite (shown by leaching with 1M HCl): together with the majority of REE (La, 96%, Yb 70%), Cl and Br are quantitatively dissolved by leaching. The REE patterns of the leachate of Shergotty and EETA 79001 are different. The Shergotty leachate may consist of two components. Component l is similar to that of EETA 79001 leachate (whitlockite), component 2 is enriched in light REE and may be responsible for the higher LREE contents of Shergotty in comparison to the other shergottites. There is some evidence that Shergotty was an open system and component 2 was introduced after crystallization. The REE patterns of the residues of Shergotty and EETA 79001 are identical indicating that the parent magmas of both meteorites are compositionally similar. Based on cpx separates with the lowest REE content, the REE pattern in the Shergotty parent magma was calculated. It is enriched in LREE and has a subchondritic Nd/Sm ratio. The negative Eu anomaly in the phosphates indicates that at least some plagioclase crystallized before phosphate. Based on several element correlations in SNC meteorites, it was suggested (Dreibus and Wänke, 1984) that both the Shergotty parent body (SPB, very probably Mars), and the Earth accreted from the same two chemically different components: component A, highly reduced and devoid of volatile elements and an oxidized component B containing also volatile elements. The SPB (Mars) mantle is 2-4 times richer in volatile and moderately siderophile elements than the Earth, indicating a higher portion of component B in the SPB. The concentrations of chalcophile elements in the SPB mantle are low, reflecting equilibration with a sulfide phase and subsequent segregation of sulfide into the core. Unlike the Earth (Wänke, 1981), the SPB (Mars) may therefore have accreted almost homogeneously.
1986GeCoA..50.1017N|1986|Exposure history of shergottites|Nishiizumi, K., Klein, J., Middleton, R., Elmore, D., Kubik, P. W., Arnold, J. R.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|50|6|1017|The cosmogenic nuclides <SUP>36</SUP>Cl ( t<SUB>1/2</SUB> = 3.0 × 10 <SUP>5</SUP> years). <SUP>26</SUP>Al (7.05 × 10 <SUP>5</SUP> years). <SUP>10</SUP>Be (1.6 × 10 <SUP>6</SUP> years) and <SUP>53</SUP>Mn (3.7 × 10 <SUP>6</SUP> years) were measured in three shergottites, ALHA 77005, EETA 79001, and Shergotty by accelerator mass spectrometry and neutron activation. The cosmogenic nuclide data constrain the history and origin of shergottites. ALHA 77005 was ejected from its parent body about 2.7 My ago and was exposed to cosmic rays as a body of 5-6 cm radius. Solar cosmic ray produced <SUP>26</SUP>A1 and <SUP>53</SUP>Mn were first clearly observed in this meteorite. The exposure age of EETA 79001 was 0.6 My and the preatmospheric radius was about 15 cm. The exposure age of Shergotty was calculated to be 2.2 My and the preatmospheric size was about 10-15 cm in radius. The terrestrial age of ALHA 77005 was 0.2 My and that of EETA 79001 was less than 0.06 My. All cosmogenic nuclide data indicate that the three shergottites were never exposed to cosmic rays in their parent bodies, whether that parent body was Mars or an asteroid. All shergottites were ejected from greater than a 3 m depth in their parent bodies. The ejection of EETA 79001 was a different event from that of the other shergottites.
1986GeCoA..50.1001S|1986|Xenon and other noble gases in shergottites|Swindle, T. D., Caffee, M. W., Hohenberg, C. M.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|50|6|1001|We have determined the isotopic composition of the xenon component trapped in EETA 79001 lithologies B and C, which we refer to as SPB-xenon. SPB-xenon is isotopically distinct from known xenon reservoirs, but differs in regular fashion. Normalized to <SUP>132</SUP>Xe, the light isotope ratios are indistinguishable from air, the <SUP>129</SUP>Xe/ <SUP>132</SUP>Xe ratio is about 2.4, and <SUP>134</SUP>Xe and <SUP>136</SUP>Xe are enhanced relative to the terrestrial atmosphere or AVCC. The apparent heavy-isotope enrichments are not generated by in situ fission and there is no spectral evidence for the presence of <SUP>244</SUP>Pu fission xenon. However, the xenon composition does match that of fractionated AVCC except at <SUP>129</SUP>Xe, and consequently may be derived from or related to that component. ALHA 77005, Shergotty and EETA 79001 lithology A also have enhanced <SUP>129</SUP>Xe/ <SUP>132</SUP>Xe ratios in most temperature steps, and are seemingly consistent with varying mixtures of SPB-xenon and terrestrial xenon. Our results for neon and argon in EETA 79001 confirm earlier results on the exposure ages. We have also verified that the trapped <SUP>38</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>36</SUP>Ar ratio in lithology C is apparently substantially different from the terrestrial or meteoritic value. Krypton in EETA 79001,C is more fractionated with respect to AVCC than is terrestrial krypton and in the opposite direction as xenon. EETA 79001,C contains excess <SUP>80</SUP>Kr (and perhaps <SUP>82</SUP>Kr and <SUP>128</SUP>Xe), presumably from neutron capture on bromine and iodine, but these neutron captures do not appear to have occurred by in situ processes.

J., Beauchamp, R. H.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|50|6|889|The Shergotty subsamples 1 and 12 consist of augite and pigeonite (67.5%), maskelynite (24%), ilmenite and titanomagnetite (2%), pyrrhotite (0.4%), whitlockite (1.8%), apatite (0.1%), quartz (0.5%), baddeleyite (trace), fayalite (0.4%), mesostasis (3%), and shock-induced local, polymineralic melt products (0.6%). The overall modal composition is similar to other Shergotty samples except for the rather high whitlockite content. The shock effects observed in the mineral constituents include mosaicism, deformation bands, planar fractures, and mechanical twin lamellae in clinopyroxene; isotropization of plagioclase with very rare remnants of birefringence; planar deformation structures, mosaicism, and strongly reduced birefringence in quartz; mechanical twinning of ilmenite; localized in situ melting of neighbouring minerals at the contact of low and high density phases. Based on the refractive index of maskelynite (average: 1.5467 with average An-content of 49%) and the degree of isotropization of the plagioclase an equilibrium shock pressure of 29 ± 1 GPa is derived. The inferred post-shock temperature is 200 ± 20° C. No heating event could have exceeded 400°C (DUKE, 1968). Local stress and temperature concentrations reach 60-80 GPa and 1600-2000°C. The observed shock effects can be explained by a single shock event. A second, weaker shock event as found by others appears to be highly improbable. Equilibrium shock pressures and post-shock temperatures for the other known shergottites are 31 ±2 GPa and 220 ± 50° C (Zagami), 43 ± 2 GPa and 400-800°C (ALHA 77005). The pressure estimate for EETA 79001 by Lambert (1985) is confirmed: 34 ± 1 GPa; the post-shock temperature is 250 ± 50° C. The abundance and textural setting of localized melt products in these meteorites confirm increasing shock pressures in the sequence Shergotty, Zagami, EETA 79001, ALHA 77005. Undoubtedly, the melts could have been formed by the same single shock which produced the equilibrium shock effects ( e.g. maskelynitization) in these meteorites. The shock-induced particle velocities inferred from Hugoniot data of basalts are in the 1.5-2.0 km/s range for the parental rocks of the shergottites. Ejection velocities are therefore in the order of 3-4 km/s. Special ejection mechanisms are required in order to exceed the escape velocity of a planet like Mars without producing higher degrees of shock ( e.g. melting) than those observed in the shergottites.
1986GeCoA..50..993B|1986|Nitrogen and light noble gases in Shergotty|Becker, Richard H., Pepin, Robert O.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|50|6|993|Two samples of Shergotty and one of EETA 79001 lithology A have been analyzed for nitrogen and light noble gases. Nitrogen yields are of the order of one ppm, with isotopic ratios within a few per mil of the terrestrial atmospheric composition after correction for spallogenic nitrogen. The nitrogen data do not indicate the presence of any significant amounts of the high-δ <SUP>15</SUP>N component seen in EETA 79001 glass, nor do they show the isotopically light component, with δ <SUP>15</SUP>N of about -35% <SUB>o</SUB>, reported previously for Shergotty. The possibility that these components are present but masked by variations in the Ar/N ratio of the light component cannot be excluded. The spallogenic noble gas data are consistent with cosmic ray irradiation of both Shergotty and EETA 79001 at shallow shielding depths. Cosmic-ray exposure ages are in the range 0.5 to 0.8 My for EETA 79001 and 2.0 to 5.2 My for Shergotty, depending on the choice of object size and shielding. Interpretation of the spallation data is complicated by uncertainties in production rates, unknown contributions from solar cosmic rays, and the possibility that Shergotty has suffered some He loss. In the absence of He loss, the exposure age of Shergotty would lie in the range ~2.0 to ~3.5 My. Radiogenic argon appears to be very heterogeneously distributed on a small scale in Shergotty, due either to small scale mineralogical inhomogeneity or to significant variation in the degree of degassing of minerals during shock, although the presence of trapped argon with a high <SUP>40</SUP>Ar /<SUP>36</SUP>Ar ratio and heterogeneous distribution cannot be ruled out. The present study does not provide evidence for or against an origin of Shergotty on Mars.

The agreement of the <SUP>3</SUP>He, <SUP>21</SUP>Ne, and <SUP>10</SUP>Be exposure ages of the shergottites also supports small-body irradiation.

The new data fall on the mixing line through the martian atmospheric composition defined by δ <SUP>15</SUP>N vs. <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>14</SUP>N for two smaller samples analyzed previously. The results from all three samples are consistent with a two-component nitrogen system in which ̃ 84 ppb of trapped martian atmospheric N is mixed in variable proportions with another, more thermally labile N component during stepped heating. This second component, which appears to be indigenous to the glass rather than adsorbed from air and is present in amounts that vary by more than a factor of 3 from sample to sample, may represent volatiles from the martian interior. Data from crystalline phases of several SNC meteorites indicate that the indigenous gas may have δ <SUP>15</SUP>N < -35‰ and <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>14</SUP>N≲ 3 × 10 <SUP>-6</SUP>, similar to the enstatite chondrites. Neon compositions in EETA 79001 glass samples suggest an earth-like value of ̃ 10.1 ± 0.7 for the unknown <SUP>20</SUP>Ne/ <SUP>22</SUP>Ne ratio in the martian atmosphere. The nitrogen-argon correlation systematics yield trapped <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>36</SUP>Ar= 2260 ± 200 , within error of the Viking value. There is evidence that <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>38</SUP>Ar in the martian atmosphere is 4.1 ± 0.2, strikingly different from terrestrial or typical chondritic ratios near 5.3. Attribution of this low value to excess <SUP>38</SUP>Ar generated over martian history by galactic cosmic-ray (GCR) spallation of surface materials would be difficult for a number of reasons, among them the excessive GCR fluences required and the absence of a corresponding <SUP>21</SUP>Ne excess.

E., Johnson, P.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|48|9|1723|Isotopic concentrations of the noble gases have been measured in several different phases of Elephant Moraine A79001 and in whole rock samples of Zagami and Allan Hills A77005, three meteorites which belong to the rare group of SNC achondrites that may have originated from the planet Mars. Shocked phases of EETA79001 contain a trapped Ar, Kr, and Xe component characterized by <SUP>84</SUP>Kr /<SUP>132</SUP>Xe ̃15, <SUP>40</SUP>Ar /<SUP>36</SUP>Ar > 2000 , <SUP>129</SUP>Xe /<SUP>132</SUP>Xe ≥ 2 , and <SUP>4</SUP>He /<SUP>40</SUP>Ar ≤ 0.1 . These elemental and isotopic ratios are unlike those for any other noble gas component except analyses of the Martian atmosphere made by Viking spacecraft. The isotopic composition of the trapped Kr shows an approximate 1% per mass unit enrichment of lighter isotopes compared to terrestrial Kr, and the traped Xe may show either a fission component or a fractionated enrichment of heavier isotopes compared to terrestrial Xe. It is hypothesized that these gases represent a portion of the Martian atmosphere which was shock-implanted into EETA79001, and that they constitute direct evidence of a Martian origin for the shergottite meteorites. Cosmic ray-produced gases in the eight known SNC meteorites form three distinct groups with exposure ages of ̃11 MY (Chassigny and the nakhlites), ̃2.6 MY (Shergotty, Zagami, and ALHA77005), and ̃0.5 MY (EETA79001). These ages suggest three distinct events and cannot have been produced by irradiation for a common time under greatly different shielding. Comparison of cosmogenic <SUP>3</SUP>He /<SUP>21</SUP>Ne measured in EETA79001 with two independent models for the production of this ratio as a function of shielding indicates that this meteorite was irradiated in space as a relatively small object. If the SNC meteorites were ejected from Mars ̃ 180 My ago, the shock age of the shergottites, they must have been relatively large objects (>6 meters diameter) which experienced at least three space collisions to initiate cosmic ray exposure. Ejection from Mars by three events at the times of initiation of cosmic ray exposure would permit the ejected objects to have been much smaller (<1 meter diameter), but would require three such events on 1.3 Gy Martian terraine in the past ̃10 MY and would not explain the common 180 MY shock age seen in all four shergottites.

O.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|69|2|225|Nitrogen and noble gases were measured in samples of a glass inclusion and the surrounding basaltic matrix from the antarctic shergottite EETA 79001. A nitrogen component trapped in the glass, but not present in the matrix, has a δ <SUP>15</SUP>N value at least as high as +190‰. Ratios of <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>14</SUP>N and <SUP>15</SUP>N/ <SUP>14</SUP>N in the glass are consistent with dilution of a martian atmospheric component ( δ <SUP>15</SUP>N = 620 ± 160‰, <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>14</SUP>N= 0.33 ± 0.03 ) by either terrestrial atmosphere adsorbed on the samples or by indigenous nitrogen from the minerals of the rock. Trapped noble gases in the glass reproduce, within error, the elemental and isotopic compositions measured in Mars' atmosphere by Viking, and are in general agreement with previous measurements except for much lower abundances of neutron-generated krypton and xenon isotopes. The most reasonable explanation at the present time for the noble gas pattern and the isotopically heavy nitrogen is that a sample of martian atmosphere has been trapped in the EETA 79001 glass, and that this meteorite, and thus the shergottites and probably the nakhlites and chassignites as well, originated on Mars. Nitrogen in the non-glassy matrix of EETA 79001 amounts to less than 0.5 ppm and has a spallation-corrected δ <SUP>15</SUP>N value in the range 0 to -20‰; it may reflect indigenous nitrogen in the basalt or a mixture of indigenous and adsorbed terrestrial nitrogen. Spallogenic noble gases yield single-stage exposure ages between 400,000 and 900,000 years, depending on irradiation geometry. Trapped argon may have an unusually low <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>38</SUP>Ar ratio. Trapped krypton, except for a small excess at <SUP>80</SUP>Kr, is smoothly mass-fractionated with respect to either terrestrial or chondritic Kr. The trapped xenon composition is consistent with addition of neutron-capture, radiogenic and fissiogenic isotopes to a base composition resembling terrestrial atmospheric Xe. The elemental <SUP>84</SUP>Kr/ <SUP>132</SUP>Xe ratio of 25 is close to the terrestrial value and very different from the chondritic ratio.

It may be a more pristine sample of the lunar highlands than any rock returned by the Apollo missions because it is very low in KREEP. It is explained how a rock could have been ejected from the moon by an impact without being melted or pulverized by the impact. Even though the geochemical evidence is strong that an Antarctic shergottite (Elephant Moraine 79001) is of Martian origin, there is still no satisfactory explanation of how the rock could have been ejected from that planet.
