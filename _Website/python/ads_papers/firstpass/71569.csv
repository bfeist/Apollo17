The conventional (Kr-81)-Kr cosmic-ray exposure ages are 103 + or - 3 m.y. for 71135 and 134 + or - 7 m.y. for 71569. An approach is outlined to deducing complex exposure histories from rare-gas data using depth profiles of the production rates of the cosmogenic rare-gas isotopes. Examination of the Xe isotopes by means of a 'concordia' plot suggests that 71569 may have a simple one-stage exposure history whereas 71135 has a more complex history. An attempt is made to construct exposure models for these two rocks which account for the abundances of all the cosmogenic rare gases, the Xe isotopic compositions, and the apparent (Kr-81)-Kr exposure ages. This study demonstrates the depreciation of (Kr-81)-Kr ages for rocks exposed at shallow depths, caused by the relatively rapid variation of the Kr-81 production as the rock is eroded. Possible implications of the tentative results for the formation age of the Central Cluster unit are discussed.

F.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||447|Petrographic studies of Apollo 17 mare basalts indicate that 70215 and 71569 arrived at the lunar surface as liquids. Low-pressure melting experiments show that compositional variations within the Apollo 17 and Apollo 11 ophitic basalt suites may be generated by near-surface fractional crystallization of liquids with compositions similar to 70215 and 70017. High-pressure melting experiments show that liquids similar in composition to 70017 and 70215 can be generated by partial melting of an olivine+clinopyroxene+Fe-Ti-oxide source at depths of 100-150 km within the moon.
