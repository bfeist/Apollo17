H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference|47|1903|2339|Symplectites of Cr-spinel, Ca-cpx, and Mg-opx samples 72415 and 76535 provide mineralogical and textural evidence in that they originated in the lunar mantle.

Olivines from ferroan anorthosite 62237 and samples from the Stillwater intrusion were analyzed; literature data for other lunar and terrestrial plutonic samples were used for comparisons. The analyses show that the lunar dunite 72415 contains a range of olivine compositions, that the olivines are zoned, and that they have CaO abundances that are consistent with shallow hypabyssal rather than deep plutonic accumulation.
1992ga17.conf...48R|1992|The Apollo 17 Samples: The Massifs and Landslide|Ryder, G.|Geology of the Apollo 17 Landing Site|||48|More than 50 kg of rock and regolith samples, a little less than half the total Apollo 17 sample mass, was collected from the highland stations at Taurus-Littrow. Twice as much material was collected from the North Massif as from the South Massif and its landslide (the apparent disproportionate collecting at the mare sites is mainly a reflection of the large size of a few individual basalt samples). Descriptions of the collection, documentation, and nature of the samples are given. A comprehensive catalog is currently being produced. Many of the samples have been intensely studied over the last 20 years and some of the rocks have become very familiar and depicted in popular works, particularly the dunite clast (72415), the troctolite sample (76535), and the station 6 boulder samples. Most of the boulder samples have been studied in Consortium mode, and many of the rake samples have received a basic petrological/geochemical characterization.

Both samples contain relatively few open microcracks but many sealed and healed microcracks. Dunite 72415 contains abundant healed cracks that formed tectonically, symplectic intergrowths spatially and probably genetically related to microcracks, and a cataclastic matrix that has been extensively sintered. Metamorphosed breccia 15418 contains many post-metamorphic healed cracks, large shock induced cracks that have been sealed with glass, and a few younger, thin, open shock induced cracks.
1975LPSC....6..833S|1975|Shock-induced deformation features in terrestrial peridot and lunar dunite.|Snee, L. W., Ahrens, T. J.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||833|Single crystals of terrestrial olivine were experimentally shock-loaded along the 010 line to peak pressures 280, 330, and 440 kbar, and the resulting deformation features were compared to those in olivine from lunar dunite 72415. Recovered fragments were examined to determine the orientation of the planar fractures. With increasing pressure the percentage of pinacoids and prisms decreases, whereas the percentage of bipyramids increases. The complexity of the distribution of bipyramids also increases with increasing pressure. Other shock-induced deformation features, including varying degrees of recrystallization, are found to depend on pressure, as observed by others. Lunar dunite 72415 was examined and found to contain olivine with well-developed shock-deformation features. The relative proportion of pinacoid, prism, and bipyramid planar fractures measured for olivine from 72415 indicates that this rock appears to have undergone shock pressure in the range 330-440 kbar. If this dunite was brought to the surface of the moon as a result of excavation of an Imbrium event-sized impact crater, the shock-pressure range experienced by the sample and the results of cratering calculations suggest that it could have originated no deeper than 50-150 km.
1974LPSC....5.1823G|1974|Sulfur abundances and distributions in the valley of Taurus-Littrow.|Gibson, E. K., Jr., Moore, G. W.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1823|Total sulfur abundances have been determined for 36 Apollo 17 soil, breccia and crystalline rock samples. Sulfur concentrations range from 550 to 1300 micrograms S/g for soil samples, with the orange soil containing the lowest amount of sulfur. Noritic breccias contain between 720 and 950 micrograms S/g, while the anorthositic rocks have sulfur contents of 270 and 368 micrograms S/g. The dunite 72415 contained the lowest sulfur content (44 micrograms S/g) of any Apollo 17 sample studied. Apollo 17 basalts have unusually high sulfur contents (1580-2770 micrograms S/g) as compared to Apollo 12 and 15 basalts and terrestrial basalts. Sulfur abundances for the Apollo 17 basalts are almost identical to those from Apollo 11 basalts. A negative correlation between percent metallic iron and total sulfur for the Apollo 17 and 15 basalts was found and suggests that a portion of the metallic iron in lunar basalts may result from desulfuration of the melt prior to crystallization from the lunar magma.
