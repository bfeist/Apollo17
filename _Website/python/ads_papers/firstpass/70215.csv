2013AGUSMGP24A..05F|2013|Lunar Paleomagnetism|Fuller, M., Weiss, B. P.|AGU Spring Meeting Abstracts|||GP24A|We have completed a reanalysis of the old Apollo paleomagnetic data using modern techniques of analysis and presentation. The principal result from the mare basalts is that several samples, such as 10020, 10017, 10049, and 70215 appear to be carrying primary natural remanent magnetization (NRM) acquired on the Moon as they cooled initially on the lunar surface, but in almost every case alternating field (AF) demagnetization was not carried out to strong enough fields to isolate this primary magnetization properly. When modern measurements are available, the agreement between old Apollo era data and new data is strikingly good. It also appears that the fields recorded by the basalts of Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 are stronger than those recorded by Apollo 12 and Apollo 15 basalts. Indeed it is not clear that any reliable records have come from these younger samples. The histories of breccias are more complicated than those of mare basalts and their NRM is harder to interpret. For regolith breccias, interpretations are complicated because of their strong superparamagnetic components and their complex, polymict lithologies. It would be unwise to use these samples for paleointensity estimates unless one can be sure that the NRM was entirely acquired as TRM during cooling after the shock event, as may be the case for 15498. In contrast, the melt rock and melt breccias, which include samples formed at high temperatures far above the Curie point of any magnetic carriers, have an excellent chance of recording lunar fields faithfully as they cool. This cooling may have taken place in a melt pool in a simple crater, or in a melt layer in a complex crater. Such samples would then have been excavated and deposited in the regolith and some appear to have recorded strong fields, but more work needs to be done to test this suggestion. Other melt rocks and melt breccias have had more complicated histories and appear to have been deposited in ejecta blankets, where final cooling took place. A useful, if imperfect, analogy may be pyroclastic volcanic deposits. The samples from the Apollo 17 layered boulder 1 at station 2 provide an example of this history. If a pTRM can be related to this secondary cooling, then we may recover a record of the field during this cooling. Samples such as 62235 and 72215 may provide just such a record, with Apollo-era and modern estimates of fields of the order of around 100 microT. Explaining such high paleointensities so late in lunar history is a major challenge to dynamo models based on cooling of the core, given its small size, and has led to alternative models.
2011AGUFM.P13D1696F|2011|Lunar paleomagnetism: a new analysis of the Apollo-era paleomagnetic measurements|Fuller, M., Weiss, B. P.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||P13D|The Apollo era lunar paleomagnetism suffered from the lack of modern instrumentation and data analysis techniques. However, paleomagnetic data for nearly 100 samples were reported. We have completed a reanalysis of these old Apollo paleomagnetic data using modern techniques of analysis. The principal result from the mare basalts is that many samples such as 10020, 10017, 10049, 12022, and 70215 appear to be carrying primary natural remanent magnetization (NRM) acquired on the Moon as they initially cooled on the lunar surface, but in almost every case alternating field (AF) demagnetization was not carried out to strong enough fields to isolate this primary magnetization properly. When modern measurements are available, the agreement between old Apollo era data and new data is strikingly good. It also appears that the fields recorded by the basalts of Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 may be stronger than those recorded by Apollo 12 basalts, but the small number of high fidelity magnetic recorders among the latter group make this tentative at present. The histories of breccias are more complicated than those of mare basalts and their NRM is harder to interpret. The regolith and fragmental breccias have NRM, which is either a combination of shock remanent magnetization (SRM) acquired during shock lithification and partial to total thermal remanent magnetization (TRM) depending upon the residual temperature after the shock event. For regolith breccias, interpretations are complicated because of their strong superparamagnetic components and their complex, polymict lithologies. It would be unwise to use these samples for paleointensity estimates unless one can be sure that the NRM was entirely acquired as TRM during cooling after the shock event, such as may be the case for 15498.

2009GeCoA..73.5884H|2009|Isotopic and elemental abundances of copper and zinc in lunar samples, Zagami, Pele’s hairs, and a terrestrial basalt|Herzog, G. F., Moynier, F., Albarède, F., Berezhnoy, A. A.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|73|19|5884|We used ICP-MS to measure the elemental concentrations and isotopic abundances of Cu and Zn in: nine Ti-rich lunar basalts (10017, 10022, 10024, 10057, 70215, 71055, 74255, 75055, and 75075); size-separated samples prepared by sieving of pyroclastic black glass 74001, orange glass 74022, and the lunar soils 15021, 15231, 70181, and 79221; a basalt from the Piton des Neiges volcano, Reunion Island; two samples of Pele's hairs from the Nyiragongo volcano, Democratic Republic of Congo, and the martian meteorite Zagami. The isotopic fractionation of zinc in lunar basalts and Zagami is mass dependent relative to a terrestrial standard (JMC 400882B). These and published results imply that lunar, terrestrial, meteoritic, and perhaps martian zinc all come from one or more reservoirs linked by mass-dependent fractionation processes. Relative to terrestrial basalts, Ti-rich lunar basalts are enriched in the heavier isotopes of Cu and Zn: we find for Ti-rich lunar basalts the following ranges and averages ±1 - σ (‰): δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu/ <SUP>63</SUP>Cu ≡ δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu, 0.1-1.4, 0.5 ± 0.1‰ ( N = 7); δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn/ <SUP>64</SUP>Zn ≡ δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn = 0.2-1.9, 1.2 ± 0.2‰ ( N = 8; 10017 excluded). For two terrestrial samples, we find δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn ̃ +0.3‰ and δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu ̃ 0‰, which are consistent with published values. The differences between the lunar basalts and terrestrial basalts could reflect minor, planetary-scale vaporization or igneous processes on the Moon. Data for size separates of the pyroclastic glasses 74001 and 74220 confirm the well-known surface correlation of Cu and Zn, but modeling calculations reveal no sharp differences between either the elemental ratios or the isotopic composition of grain interiors and exteriors. The absence of such differences indicates that the isotopic compositions for bulk samples are dominated by a light-isotope-rich surface component. Data for size separates of lunar soils also confirm the surface correlation of Cu and Zn, but an enrichment of heavy rather than light isotopes. Averages for bulk lunar soils from this work and the literature are (‰): δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu, from 1.4 to 4.1, average 3.0 ± 0.3 ( N = 9); δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn, from 2.2 to 6.4, average 4.0 ± 0.3 ( N = 14). As with the glasses, in all but soil 15231 our data show no strong differences between the isotopic composition of soil sub-samples with small and large grains. The size of the isotopic fractionation inferred for the surface component in the soils is 3× smaller than predicted by a published model of sputtering primarily by solar particles. At the same time, the observed fractionation is larger than predicted by calculations based on a model of micrometeorite impact heating and hydrodynamic quenching. Because impact heating appears unable to explain the observations, we conclude that sputtering must be important even though samples with very large isotopic fractionation of Cu and Zn have not yet been found.
1980LPSC...11.2059A|1980|Dynamic properties of mare basalts: relation of equations of state to petrology.|Ahrens, T. J., Watt, J. P.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||2059|A comparison of shock compression and release adiabat data to 160 GPa for the 12063 low-titanium mare basalt with previous results for the high-titanium, 70215 mare basalt shows that, while the two rocks have very similar zero-pressure densities, the former is much less compressible above 100 GPa. This demonstrates that rocks with complex mineralogies can have significantly different dynamic properties despite a similarity of oxide components. The 10% higher ilmenite content of 70215 is suggested as an explanation for the contrasting dynamic properties of the two rocks. Because the 12063 high-pressure data presented lie midway between the 70215 data and those previously obtained for the anorthosite that is the dominant constituent of the lunar highlands, it is concluded that the behavior of lunar surface material under dynamic compression is terrane-dependent; where this dependence is (1) found to extend to different regions of the maria, and (2) may affect the determination of the relative ages of different rock units from areal crater densities.
1977RSPTA.285..159K|1977|Mare Basalt Petrogenesis|Kesson, Susan E.|Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series A|285|1327|159|Melting experiments in vacuum at Fe-saturation for high-Ti basalt compositions 70215 and 15318 Red Glass, and low-Ti basalt composition 15555-15016, have defined equilibrium crystallization sequences and the liquid-lines-of-descent, and show that much of the chemical variety in the natural samples is due to near-surface fractionation processes. However, the various groups within the high-Ti suite (Apollo 11 low-K, Apollo 11 high-K and Apollo 17 basalts; Apollo 17 Orange Glass) cannot be interrelated by such processes, nor can the high-Ti suite be a near-surface derivative of a low-Ti parent magma. Likewise, the low-Ti Apollo 12 basalts and Apollo 15 basalts and Green Glass cannot be interrelated by simple fractionation, although much of the chemical variety within each group is explained by olivine fractionation. On the basis of high-pressure studies, low-Ti basalts are believed to originate as a spectrum of partial melts from a previously differentiated olivine-pyroxenite lunar mantle, at depths ranging from approximately 200-500 km. High-Ti basalts are interpreted as hybrid liquids resulting from the assimilation of subcrustal Ti-rich material by a parental magma of low-Ti type.

L.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1489|Three Apollo 17 basalts were studied by the laser Ar-39-Ar-40 method. The 70215 basalt has a normal well-behaved Ar-39-Ar-40 release pattern; the 70017 basalt has a disturbed release pattern which indicates a limited intermediate maximum age followed by a broad low-age region; and the 75035 basalt has a pattern initially similar to 70017 that is followed by a high-temperature maximum age. The laser study shows that all mineral systems in 70215 have small and uniform temperature losses, while the laser-determined ages for 70017 and 75035 are, apparently, primarily controlled by the minerals containing mesostasis inclusions. It is possible that the drop in ages observed by the conventional Ar-39-Ar-40 method was due not only to recoil of Ar-39 during neutron irradiation but also to gas loss from some minerals. It is suggested that the plagioclases are the best minerals to use for a reliable age.
1977LPSC....8.1201S|1977|The moon and Q.|Schreiber, E.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||1201|The acoustic attenuation of a sample of lunar basalt 70215 was measured by the method of sphere resonance. A Q of 1185 was achieved under a vacuum of 7 millionths torr after heating the sample. He and CO2 gas caused a small decrease of Q. H2O vapor, however, resulted in a major decrease in Q. The Q of lunar material when measured on earth is low because of adsorbed gases. However, it is not clear that this effect explains completely the observed high lunar Q.
1977LPSC....8.3437A|1977|Shock compression and adiabatic release of a titaniferous mare basalt.|Ahrens, T. J., Jackson, I., Jeanloz, R.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||3437|A report is presented regarding the dynamic properties of a rock indigenous to the mare basins of the moon. The reported data were obtained in a study of sample 70215, a very titanium-rich basalt (58% pyroxene, 18% ilmenite, 15% plagioclase, 6% olivine, and 3% quartz by weight). This rock is probably representative of a class of the earliest mare-filling extrusive rocks which are exposed on the present lunar surface. Two series of experiments were performed. One set of experiments involved the measuring of Hugoniot and release adiabats to 15.7 GPa with a propellant gun apparatus. In the second set of experiments, a light-gas gun was employed to yield Hugoniot data at about 120 GPa and release states at about 90 GPa. Lunar basalt 70215 appears to be among the densest rocks in the present lunar sample collection, having a crystal density of 3.38 g/cu cm and a porosity of about 1.3%. The results of the experiments have important implications for both the degree of shock metamorphism expected for impact processes and the extent of ejecta transport on mare surfaces with high-titanium basalt composition.
1976LPSC....7..649M|1976|Spallation deuterium in rock 70215.|Merlivat, L., Lelu, M., Nief, G., Roth, E.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||649|Hydrogen, water, and deuterium contents have been measured in eight pieces of the basalt sample 70215. For five of the eight pieces, the locations in the whole rock sample are accurately known. Terrestrial contamination seems to be the source of the water extracted from each of the pieces. The average deuterium content of this water is 138 ppm. The relationship observed between the quantities of hydrogen and deuterium released from each piece allows one to estimate the amount of deuterium formed by nuclear reaction on the lunar surface. For rock 70215 this value is equal to 0.46 by 10 to the -10th power mole D2/g for an exposure age of 100 million yr. No depth dependence is found for the amount of deuterium formed. This observation is consistent with a minimum erosion rate of 0.5 mm per million yr. Good agreement is observed between the measured value and the calculations made by Yokoyama and Tobailem (1976). Comparison between deuterium and tritium production rates is tentatively presented.
1975LPSC....6..921K|1975|Mare basalts: melting experiments and petrogenetic interpretations.|Kesson, S. E.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||921|Equilibrium crystallization sequences are determined in melting experiments in vacuum at Fe saturation on synthetic mare basalt compositions 70215 and 15318 Red Glass (both high-Ti) as well as 15555-15016 (low-Ti). The experiments confirm that much of the chemical variation within both the high- and low-Ti suites is controlled by near-surface fractionation processes, although the two suites cannot be related by such mechanisms. The components and crystallization products of the liquidus at various temperatures and pressures are reported. Mare basalt petrogenesis is interpreted in terms of high-pressure equilibria at Fe saturation; it is suggested that low-Ti basalts represent partial melts of a differentiated olivine-pyroxenite lunar mantle at 240 km or deeper, while cumulus clinopyroxene in the source is responsible for their REE characteristics. The formation of high-Ti basalts is considered.
1974LPSC....5.2927W|1974|Ultrasonic attenuation: Q measurements on 70215,29.|Warren, N., Trice, R., Stephens, J.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||2927|Ultrasonic attenuation measurements have been made on an aluminum alloy, obsidian, and rock samples including lunar sample 70215,29. The measurement technique is based on a combination of the pulse transmission method and the forced resonance method. The technique is designed to explore the problem of defining experimentally, the Q of a medium or sample in which mode conversion may occur. If modes are coupled, the measured attenuation is strongly dependent on individual modes of vibration, and a range of Q-factors may be measured over various resonances or from various portions of a transient signal. On 70215,29, measurements were made over a period of a month while the sample outgassed in hard varuum. During this period, the highest measured Q of this sample increased from a few hundred into the range of 1000-1300.

It is concluded that dc conductivity undergoes a three order-of-magnitude change between lunar day and lunar night. The assumption is made that strong k' increments at the lower frequencies are partially induced by electrode and dc conductivity effects. Corrections were applied to the experimental data; corrected results suggest relaxation processes occurring at frequencies below 1 kHz.

F.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||447|Petrographic studies of Apollo 17 mare basalts indicate that 70215 and 71569 arrived at the lunar surface as liquids. Low-pressure melting experiments show that compositional variations within the Apollo 17 and Apollo 11 ophitic basalt suites may be generated by near-surface fractional crystallization of liquids with compositions similar to 70215 and 70017. High-pressure melting experiments show that liquids similar in composition to 70017 and 70215 can be generated by partial melting of an olivine+clinopyroxene+Fe-Ti-oxide source at depths of 100-150 km within the moon.
1974Icar...22..459S|1974|Microcrater Populations on Apollo 17 Rocks|Schneider, E., Hörz, F.|Icarus|22|4|459|Approximately 6000 microcrates were investigated using binocular microscope techniques on Apollo 17 rocks 70215, 72215, 72235, 72395, 72435, 73216, 73218, 73275, 74275, 76135, 76136 and 79155. The crater populations observed have identical characteristics to those obtained from previous missions. Special emphasis was placed on assessing the influence of target properties on the observable crater populations. Although these properties cannot be quantitatively evaluated at present, the empirical results indicate that crater populations on glass, breccia, and crystalline rock surfaces may differ fundamentally. As a consequence, lunar surface exposure ages of individual rocks based on micrometeoroid craters may be subject to criticism.
