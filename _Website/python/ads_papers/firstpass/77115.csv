While much of Earth’s impact record has been erased, its Moon preserves an extensive history of bombardment. Quantifying the timing of lunar impact events is crucial to understanding how impacts have shaped the evolution of early Earth, and provides the basis for estimating the ages of other cratered surfaces in the Solar System. Many lunar impact melt rocks are complex mixtures of glassy and crystalline “melt” materials and inherited clasts of pre-impact minerals and rocks. If analyzed in bulk, these samples can yield complicated incremental release 40Ar/39Ar spectra, making it challenging to uniquely interpret impact ages. Here, I have used a combination of high-spatial resolution 40Ar/39Ar geochronology and thermal-kinetic modeling to gain new insights into the impact histories recorded by such lunar samples. To compare my data to those of previous studies, I developed a software tool to account for differences in the decay, isotopic, and monitor age parameters used for different published 40Ar/39Ar datasets. Using an ultraviolet laser ablation microprobe (UVLAMP) system I selectively dated melt and clast components of impact melt rocks collected during the Apollo 16 and 17 missions. UVLAMP 40Ar/39Ar data for samples 77135, 60315, 61015, and 63355 show evidence of open-system behavior, and provide new insights into how to interpret some complexities of published incremental heating 40Ar/39Ar spectra. Samples 77115, 63525, 63549, and 65015 have relatively simple thermal histories, and UVLAMP 40Ar/39Ar data for the melt components of these rocks indicate the timing of impact events—spanning hundreds of millions of years—that influenced the Apollo 16 and 17 sites. My modeling and UVLAMP 40Ar/39Ar data for sample 73217 indicate that some impact melt rocks can quantitatively retain evidence for multiple melt-producing impact events, and imply that such polygenetic rocks should be regarded as high-value sampling opportunities during future exploration missions to cratered planetary surfaces. Collectively, my results complement previous incremental heating 40Ar/39Ar studies, and support interpretations that the Moon experienced a prolonged period of heavy bombardment early in its history.

Roedderite (Na,K)2(Mg,Fe)5Si12O30 (na greater than 0.5, fe less than 0.5) has been found only in enstatite chondrites and in the reduced, subchondritic silicate inclusions in IAB irons (Fuchs, 1966; Rambaldi et al., 1984; Olsen, 1967). We described silica-roedderite-bearing clasts in L/LL3.5 ALHA77011 and LL3.7 ALHA77278, a silica-roedderite-bearing chondrule in L3 Mezo-Madaras, and a silica-merrihueite-bearing chondrule in L/LL3.5 ALHA77115. The findings of merrihueite and roedderite in ALHA77011, ALHA77115, ALHA77278 and Mezo-Madaras fill the compositional gap betweeen previously described roedderite in enstatite chondrites and silicate inclusions in IAB irons and merrihueite in Mezo-Madaras, suggesting that there is a complete solid solution of roedderite and merrihueite in meteorites. We infer that the silica- and merrihueite/roedderite-bearing chondrules and clasts experienced a complex formational history including: (a) fractional condensation in the solar nebular that produced Si-rich and Al-poor precursors, (b) melting of fractionated nebular solids resulting in the formation of silica-pyroxene chondrules, (c) in some cases, fragmentation in the nebula or on a parent body, (d) reaction of silica with alkali-rich gas that formed merrihueite/roedderite on a parent body, (e) formation of fayalitic olivine and feerosilite-rich pyroxene due to reaction of silica with oxidized Fe on a parent body, and (f) minor thermal metamorphism, possibly generated by impacts.

W.|Geology of the Apollo 17 Landing Site|||61|Alkalic suite pristine nonmare rocks are distinctly enriched in plagiophile elements such as Na and K, as well as generally incompatible elements, despite modes and textures more characteristic of typical crustal cumulates (most commonly anorthosites) than of the basaltic KREEP rocks that appear to account for the bulk of the lunar crust's total complement of incompatible elements. Our studies indicate that the 77115 troctolitic clasts of Winzer et al. is actually a troctolitic anorthosite (or anorthositic troctolite), probably best classified as a member of the alkalic suite. We managed to obtain a thin section with pyroxene and olivine, and analyzed a 13.4-mg chip by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). The results of this analysis are briefly discussed.

S.|Lunar Highlands Crust|||233|Phase equilibrium and dynamic crystallization experiments using a synthetic analog of the 77115 matrix composition restrict interpretations of the thermal history of the lunar sample. Rapid early cooling (10-25 G/hr) of melt containing a large number of a nuclei and slow late stage cooling (less than 7 C/hr) are required to crystallize the textures and mineralogy of the 77115 matrix. This result is in agreement with that predicated by the nature and extent of diffusive cation exchange between various xenocrysts phases and the 77115 matrix.

T.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||877|A systematic interdisciplinary study of the Apollo 17 station 7 boulder, from the foot of the North Massif at Taurus-Littrow, is described. The astronauts observed four lithologies: a large white clast represented by 77215, cut by dark dikelets (77075) and enclosed in blue-gray breccia (77115); the assemblage of these three rock types is in turn surrounded by green-gray breccia (77135). The history of the station 7 boulder, as construed from the results of the consortium study, is presented.

A regression line corresponding to an age of 4.07 plus or minus 0.09 b.y. is obtained with an Rb-87 decay constant of 1.41 x 10 to the -11th/yr and an initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio of approximately 0.69918. It is noted that the intrusion age of the dikelets provides the most reliable criterion for determining the age of the entire boulder, i.e., the boulder is not an extension of 77115, which formed more recently. Attention is given to a generalized lunar history during the first 600 m.y.

S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||493|77115, a fragment-laden feldspathic pigeonite basalt, is one of four hand specimen-size samples collected from a boulder about 2.5 m across at Station 7, Taurus-Littrow. 77115 crystallized rapidly from a melt at or near the lunar surface and contains a population of xenoliths and xenocrysts which must have come from two or more separate sources. Broad reaction rims present in many of the xenocrysts suggest that cooling of the melt may have been very slow initially and rapid in the latter stage to produce the very fine-grained matrix. If the requirement for two cooling rates can be established, this will favor an endogenous igneous origin rather than an impact origin for the melt. Another interpretation is that the matrix crystallized first, followed by subsolidus reaction between xenocrysts and matrix to form the rims. The Apollo 17 feldspathic pigeonite basalts are postulated to be the dominant rock types of the early lunar crust.
1974E&PSL..23..413C|1974|Preliminary petrographic description and geologic implications of the Apollo 17 Station 7 boulder consortium samples|Chao, E. C. T., Minkin, Jean A., Thompson, Carolyn L.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|23|3|413|Preliminary petrographic description and mineral composition of four hand samples (77135, 77115, 77075 and 77215) are presented. 77135, 77115, and 77075 all crystallized from fragment-laden melts; they are similar in textures but differ in grain size. 77135 and 77115 are pigeonite feldspathic basalts. On the basis of geologic and petrographic evidence, 77115 and 77075 are related; they formed, cooled, and consolidated before being engulfed in the vesicular 77135. The impact or igneous origin of the melts from which these rocks crystallized cannot be determined. 77215 is a shocked, strongly sheared and granulated microbreccia consisting of three major lithologies dominated by mineral clasts of orthopyroxene and calcic plagioclase. The orthopyroxene clasts contain coarse exsolved blebs of augite, suggesting a deep-seated origin. The major, minor, and trace element compositions of 77135, 77115, and 77075 are in general similar. They represent a major highland rock type, perhaps more important than anorthosites.

K.

Lithophile trace element abundances were determined by stable isotope dilution mass spectrometry. Three matrix types samples (77135, 77115, and 77075) were found to be KREEP-rich fragment-laden melts with analogues throughout the Apollo 17 landing site. Of the five clasts analyzed, at least one (77115,19, troctolite) is thought to be a cumulate; 77135, 77115, and 77075 are thought to have originated by impact fusion of material with similar composition. This original material may represent a partial melt of a parent material of the composition of an included, shocked norite breccia (77215).

E.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|23|3|429|The Apollo 17 astronauts removed four rocks samples to represent each of the lithologies they recognized in the boulder at station 7: sample 77215 from an off-white meter-sized block; sample 77075 from one of the thin dikes that cross the off-white block; 77115 from the blue-gray rock adjacent to the off-white block and apparently continuous with thin dikes that cross the block; sample 77135 of the tan-gray or green-gray vesicular rock adjacent to the blue-gray (77115) rock. A consortium of investigators has been organized, under the leadership of E.C.T. Chao, to study the samples. Each sample shows a number of lithologic types in terms of clasts (or xenoliths) and matrices. A table shows how subsamples have been allocated for consortium study. Maps and photographs show the relations between subsample locations and lithologies for the two more dissected samples, 77115 and 77135.
