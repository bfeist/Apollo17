2015E&PSL.431..195F|2015|Indigenous nitrogen in the Moon: Constraints from coupled nitrogen-noble gas analyses of mare basalts|Füri, Evelyn, Barry, Peter H., Taylor, Lawrence A., Marty, Bernard|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|431||195|Nitrogen and noble gas (Ne-Ar) abundances and isotope ratios, determined by step-wise CO<SUB>2</SUB> laser-extraction, static-mass spectrometry analysis, are reported for bulk fragments and mineral separates of ten lunar mare basalts (10020, 10057, 12008, 14053, 15555, 70255, 71557, 71576, 74255, 74275), one highland breccia (14321), and one ferroan anorthosite (15414). The mare basalt sub-samples 10057,183 and 71576,12 contain a large amount of solar noble gases, whereas neon and argon in all other samples are purely cosmogenic, as shown by their <SUP>21</SUP>Ne/<SUP>22</SUP>Ne ratios of ≈0.85 and <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/<SUP>38</SUP>Ar ratios of ≈0.65. The solar-gas-free basalts contain a two-component mixture of cosmogenic <SUP>15</SUP>N and indigenous nitrogen (<0.5 ppm). Mare basalt 74255 and the olivine fraction of 15555,876 record the smallest proportion of <SUP>15</SUP>N<SUB>cosm</SUB>; therefore, their δ<SUP>15</SUP> N values of -0.2 to + 26.7 ‰ (observed at the low-temperature steps) are thought to well represent the isotopic composition of indigenous lunar nitrogen. However, δ<SUP>15</SUP> N values ≤ - 30 ‰ are found in several basalts, overlapping with the isotopic signature of Earth's primordial mantle or an enstatite chondrite-like impactor. While the lowest δ<SUP>15</SUP> N values allow for nitrogen trapped in the Moon's interior to be inherited from the proto-Earth and/or the impactor, the more <SUP>15</SUP>N-enriched compositions require that carbonaceous chondrites provided nitrogen to the lunar magma ocean prior to the solidification of the crust. Since nitrogen can efficiently be incorporated into mafic minerals (olivine, pyroxene) under oxygen fugacities close to or below the iron-wustite buffer (Li et al., 2013), the mare basalt source region is likely characterized by a high nitrogen storage capacity. In contrast, anorthosite 15414 shows no traces of indigenous nitrogen, suggesting that nitrogen was not efficiently incorporated into the lunar crust during magma ocean differentiation.
2004CoPhC.159..121B|2004|Programs for generating Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of SU(3) in SU(2) and SO(3) bases|Bahri, C., Rowe, D. J., Draayer, J. P.|Computer Physics Communications|159|2|121|Computer codes are developed to calculate Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of SU(3) in both SU(2)- and SO(3)-coupled bases. The efficiency of this code derives from the use of vector coherent state theory to evaluate the required coefficients directly without recursion relations. The approach extends to other compact semi-simple Lie groups. The codes are given in subroutine form so that users can incorporate the codes into other programs. Program summaryTitle of program: SU3CGVCS Catalogue identifier: ADTN Program summary URL:http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/ADTN Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University of Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: Persons requesting the program must sign the standard CPC non-profit use license Computers for which the program is designed and others on which it is operable: SGI Origin 2000, HP Apollo 9000, Sun, IBM SP, Pentium Operating systems under which the program has been tested: IRIX 6.5, HP UX 10.01, SunOS, AIX, Linux Programming language used: FORTRAN 77 Memory required to execute with typical data: On the HP system, it requires about 732 KBytes. Disk space used for output: 2100+2460 bytes No. of bits in a word: 32 bit integer and 64 bit floating point numbers. No. of processors used: 1 Has the code been vectorized: No No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 26 309 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 3969 Distribution format: tar gzip file Nature of physical problem: The group SU(3) and its Lie algebra su(3) have important applications, for example, in elementary particle physics, nuclear physics, and quantum optics [1-3]. The code presented is particularly relevant for the last two fields. Clebsch-Gordan (CG) coefficients are required whenever the symmetries of many-body systems are used for the evaluation of matrix elements of tensor operators. Moreover, the construction of CG coefficients for SU(3) serves as a nontrivial prototype for larger compact semi-simple Lie algebras and even for non semi-simple Lie algebras. It is the simplest Lie algebra to have multiplicity in its outer products and a non-canonical subalgebra, i.e., SO(3). Method of solution: Vector coherent state theory is first used to construct bases for the products of two irreducible representations (irreps) [4]. The bases are SU(2)-coupled so that SU(2)-reduced CG (or isoscalar factors) can be constructed naturally. The CG coefficients in the SO(3) bases are constructed subsequently from the overlaps between the SU(2) and SO(3) bases. Restriction on the complexity of the problem: The programs are limited by computer memory and the maximum size of variable arrays. As dimension overflow conditions are possible, they are flagged and can be fixed by following the directions given as part of the error message. Typical running time: The calculation time for a single SU(3) CG coefficient is very different for SU(2) and SO(3) bases. It varies between 7.3-54.1 ns in SGI Origin 2000, 0.81-5.48 ms in HP Apollo 9000, or 0.055-0.373 ms in Intel Pentium 4 for SU(2) bases while it is between 0.027-0.255 s in Intel Pentium 4 for SO(3) bases. Unusual features of the program: Intrinsic bit functions: and, or, and shift, called iand, ior, and ishft, respectively, in FORTRAN, are used for packing and unpacking the labels for the irreps. Intrinsic logical btest is used to test the bit for the phase factor. References: [1] Y. Ne'eman, Nucl. Phys. 26 (1961) 222; M. Gell-Man, Y. Ne'eman, The Eightfold Way, Benjamin, New York, 1964.
