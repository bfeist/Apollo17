2014GeCoA.131...62S|2014|Characterization of the dominant impactor signature for Apollo 17 impact melt rocks|Sharp, Miriam, Gerasimenko, Iva, Loudin, Lorne C., Liu, Jingao, James, Odette B., Puchtel, Igor S., Walker, Richard J.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|131||62|Concentrations of the highly siderophile elements (HSE) Re, Os, Ir, Ru, Pt, and Pd and <SUP>187</SUP>Os/<SUP>188</SUP>Os isotopic compositions are reported for seven Apollo 17 impact melt rocks. These data are used to examine the dominant chemical signature of the impactor that formed the melts. Six of the samples (72355, 72435, 72535, 76035, 76055, and 76135) have poikilitic textures; one sample (73235) has an aphanitic texture. Data for the samples define linear correlations when Ir is plotted versus other HSE concentrations, with y-intercepts indistinguishable from zero for most HSE in most rocks. Scatter about some of the trends, and occasional trends with positive y-intercepts, indicate either mixing of additional components that are heterogeneously distributed within several rocks, or modest fractionation of some HSE by volatilization, crystal fractionation, or other processes, during formation and evolution of the melt sheet. There is no statistical difference between the aphanitic and poikilitic samples in terms of HSE ratios after visible granulitic clasts were removed from aphanite 73235. Hence, earlier speculations that the two types of impact melt rocks at this site may have been generated by different impactors are not supported by our data. Most Apollo 17 samples examined here and in prior studies are characterized by very similar HSE signatures, consistent with a common impactor. These samples are characterized by elevated Ru/Ir, Pd/Ir, and Re/Os, relative to most chondrites. Collectively, the data indicate that the impactor was characterized by the following HSE ratios (2σ): Re/Ir 0.093 ± 0.020, Os/Ir 1.03 ± 0.28, Ru/Ir 1.87 ± 0.30, Pt/Ir 2.36 ± 0.31, Pd/Ir 1.85 ± 0.41, and present-day <SUP>187</SUP>Os/<SUP>188</SUP>Os of 0.1322 ± 0.0013. The results most likely mean that the impactor was a body with a bulk composition that was just outside the range of meteoritic compositions currently sampled on Earth.
2012M&PS...47..120T|2012|Resolution of impact-related microstructures in lunar zircon: A shock-deformation mechanism map|Timms, Nicholas E., Reddy, Steven M., Healy, David, Nemchin, Alexander A., Grange, Marion L., Pidgeon, Robert T., Hart, Robert|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|47|1|120|The microstructures of lunar zircon grains from breccia samples 72215, 73215, 73235, and 76295 collected during the Apollo 17 mission have been characterized via optical microscopy, cathodoluminescence imaging, and electron backscatter diffraction mapping. These zircon grains preserve deformation microstructures that show a wide range in style and complexity. Planar deformation features (PDFs) are documented in lunar zircon for the first time, and occur along {001}, {110}, and {112}, typically with 0.1-25 μm spacing. The widest PDFs associated with {112} contain microtwin lamellae with 65°/<110> misorientation relationships. Deformation bands parallel to {100} planes and irregular low-angle (<10°) boundaries most commonly have <001> misorientation axes. This geometry is consistent with a dislocation glide system with <100>{010} during dislocation creep. Nonplanar fractures, recrystallized domains with sharp, irregular interfaces, and localized annealing textures along fractures are also observed. No occurrences of reidite were detected. Shock-deformation microstructures in zircon are explained in terms of elastic anisotropy of zircon. PDFs form along a limited number of specific {hkl} planes that are perpendicular to directions of high Young's modulus, suggesting that PDFs are likely to be planes of longitudinal lattice damage. Twinned {112} PDFs also contain directions of high shear modulus. A conceptual model is proposed for the development of different deformation microstructures during an impact event. This “shock-deformation mechanism map” is used to explain the relative timing, conditions, and complexity relationships between impact-related deformation microstructures in zircon.

2011GeCoA..75.2213G|2011|Complex magmatic and impact history prior to 4.1 Ga recorded in zircon from Apollo 17 South Massif aphanitic breccia 73235|Grange, M. L., Nemchin, A. A., Timms, N., Pidgeon, R. T., Meyer, C.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|75|8|2213|Sample 73235 is one of several aphanitic impact melt breccias collected by the Apollo 17 mission at stations 2 and 3 on the slopes of the South Massif. This study presents a detailed investigation of internal structures and U-Pb ages of large zircon grains from this breccia sample. New data combined with the results of previous studies of zircon grains from the same location indicate that most zircon clasts in breccias from stations 2 and 3 formed during multiple magmatic events between 4.37 and 4.31 Ga, although the oldest zircon crystallized at about 4.42 Ga and the youngest at 4.21 Ga. In addition, zircons from the aphanitic breccias record several impact events prior to the ̃3.9 Ga Late Heavy Bombardment. The results indicate that the zircons probably crystallized at different locations within the Procellarum KREEEP Terrane and were later excavated and modified by several impacts and delivered to the same locality within separate ejecta blankets. This locality became a source of material that formed the aphanitic impact melt breccias of the South Massif during a ̃3.9 Ga impact. However, the zircons, showing old impact features, are not modified by this ̃3.9 Ga impact event suggesting that (i) this common source area was located at the periphery of excavation cavity, and (ii) the > 3.9 Ga ages recorded by the zircon grains could date large (basin-forming) events as significant as major later (̃3.9 Ga) collisions such as Imbrium and Serenitatis.
2007GeCoA..71.1370P|2007|Complex history of a zircon aggregate from lunar breccia 73235|Pidgeon, R. T., Nemchin, A. A., van Bronswijk, W., Geisler, T., Meyer, C., Compston, W., Williams, I. S.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|71|5|1370|Results are reported of an investigation of the age and origin of the exceptional zircon aggregate in an anorthositic clast from lunar breccia 73235. Cathodoluminescence and birefringence images show that the aggregate consists of numerous angular fragments of sector zoned primary zircon in a matrix of secondary zircon with an overall texture that resembles a pseudotachylite. SIMS U-Pb analyses of the primary fragments and the matrix yielded two clearly defined ages, an age of 4.315 ± 0.015 Ga and initial Th/U ratio of 0.21-0.35 for the primary zircon and an age of 4.187 ± 0.011 Ga and Th/U of 0.04-0.17, for the secondary zircon matrix. A Raman spectroscopic study the secondary matrix zircon was undertaken to investigate its structure. Results showed that the matrix has a zircon structure but there is also evidence for the presence of an amorphous component. Implications of the structural and U-Pb age data are discussed in terms of the origin and evolution of the aggregate and the history of lunar events. It is proposed that an original single, millimetre-sized, sector zoned zircon, formed at 4.31 Ga, was subjected to a severe shock event at 4.18 Ga. This event resulted in the fracturing of the zircon, the displacement and rotation of fragments, the compression of the aggregate to a lensoid shape, and the shock reduction of zircon to sub-micron-sized and amorphous granules in crush zones in the mosaic of fractures. Volatilisation loss of Pb and the addition of U to the secondary zircon is attributed to processes activated by the extreme thermal pulse which accompanied the 4.18 Ga shock event. Shock effects are seen in some of the primary fragments but Raman spectra of the primary and secondary zircon show no evidence for pressure-induced transformation of zircon to a scheelite structure. The zircon U-Pb system has not been affected by the ca. 3.95 Ga thermal pulse that accompanied formation of the host breccia although this event has largely reset the K-Ar systems.
1976LPSC....7.1821D|1976|Apollo 17 grey breccias and crustal composition in the Serenitatis Basin region.|Dence, M. R., Grieve, R. A. F., Plant, A. G.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1821|It is noted that Apollo 17 grey breccias, as represented by 73235 and 73215, are texturally and compositionally similar mixtures of two clast-rich lithologies: coherent, very fine grained, dark matrix breccia and more porous, light matrix breccia. It is proposed that the breccias under consideration consist of primary Serenitatis ejecta, texturally modified by secondary impact mixing. When applied to a model of the Serenitatis impact event, unshocked clasts are interpreted as samples of the upper 25 km of the lunar crust with the coarser grained, shocked, plagioclase-rich clasts as material excavated from the lower crust.
1975LPSC....6.1593P|1975|<SUP>40</SUP>Ar-<SUP>39</SUP>Ar dating of Apollo 16 and 17 rocks.|Phinney, D., Kahl, S. B., Reynolds, J. H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1593|The reported study is a continuation of an investigation begun by Alexander and Kahl (1974), with primary emphasis on (Ar-40)-(Ar-39) dating of lunar breccias. A primary objective of the study was related to the resolution of small plateau-age differences between Apollo 16 and 17 samples which have been irradiated in the same irradiation. This objective was not realized because (1) neither of the considered Apollo 16 samples has a well-defined plateau, and (2) the release patterns of the two Apollo 17 samples with plateaux (73235 and 77017) are sufficiently complex to suggest caution in interpretation of fine-scale differences among apparent ages. The plateau age of 73235 agrees well with plateau ages measured for a nearby boulder at the South Massif. The plateau age of 77017, on the other hand, agrees well with plateau ages measured in an nearby boulder at the base of the North Massif. These rock and boulder ages are tightly clustered about 3.99 b.y., and this clustering suggests that the North and South Massifs were made in the same basin-forming event, presumably Serenitatis.
