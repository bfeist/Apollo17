2006GeCoA..70.6103M|2006|Isotopic composition of zinc, copper, and iron in lunar samples|Moynier, F., Albarède, F., Herzog, G. F.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|70|24|6103|We determined by ICP-MS the concentrations and isotopic ratios of Fe, Cu, and Zn in the Ti-rich lunar basalt 74275, in the lunar orange glass 74220, and in up to 10 lunar soils, namely, 14163, 15231, 64501, 66041, 68841, 69941, 70011, 72501, 75081, and 76501. Two analyses of zinc in lunar basalt 74275 give δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn = 0.17‰ and 0.75‰, values within the range of those measured in terrestrial basalts; copper in lunar basalt 74275 has δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu ̃ +1.4‰, which is isotopically heavier than values observed in terrestrial basalts. In the orange glass, we measured δ <SUP>56</SUP>Fe = -0.24‰, δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu = -0.42‰, and δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn ̃ -3.6‰. These values of δ are more negative than those obtained for 74275 and for typical lunar basalts, but for Cu, comparable to those observed in terrestrial sulfides and meteorites. In lunar soils we found 0.11‰ ⩽ δ <SUP>56</SUP>Fe ⩽ 0.51‰, 2.6‰ ⩽ δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu ⩽ 4.5‰, and 2.2‰ ⩽ δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn ⩽ 6.4‰. Insofar as we can generalize from a small sample set, S, Fe, Cu, Zn, and Cd show similar trends in isotopic fractionation on the Moon. Lunar basalts have nearly terrestrial isotopic ratios. Relative to the lunar basalt 74275, the pyroclastic glass 74220 is enriched in the lighter isotopes of Fe, Cu, and Zn, and the soils are enriched in the heavier isotopes of Fe, Cu, and Zn. The patterns in the basalts are likely inherited from the source material; the light-isotope enrichments seen in the orange glass originated during lava fountaining or, less probably, during partial condensation of vapor; and the heavy-isotope enrichments in the lunar soils were likely created by a combination of processes that included micrometeorite vaporization and sputtering. In the orange glass, the light-isotope enrichments (relative to lunar basalts) of Zn are larger than those of Cu. If these enrichments reflect accurately the isotopic composition of the gas, they suggest that Cu is more volatile than Zn in the liquid from which the gas derived. A simple model built on the known flux of micrometeorites to the lunar surface and a published estimate that micrometeorites generate 10 times their own mass of vapor, predicts heavy-isotope enrichments comparable to those observed in soils but only if the regolith gardening rate is set at about one twentieth of the generally accepted value of 1 cm/My. This discrepancy may reflect the difference in the time constants for micrometeorite milling and decimeter-scale gardening, or the importance of sputtering.
2001M&PS...36.1097E|2001|The antiquity indicator argon-40/argon-36 for lunar surface samples calibrated by uranium-235-xenon-136 dating|Eugster, Otto, Terribilini, Dario, Polnau, Ernst, Kramers, Jan|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|36|8|1097|Several solar gas rich lunar soils and breccias have trapped 40Ar/36Ar ratios >10, although solar Ar is expected to yield a ratio of <0.01. Radiogenic 40Ar produced in the lunar crust from 40K decay was outgassed into the lunar atmosphere, ionized, accelerated in the electromagnetic field of the solar wind, and reimplanted into lunar surface material. The 40Ar loss rate depends on the decreasing abundance of 40K. In order to calibrate the time dependence of the 40Ar/36Ar ratio in lunar surface material, the period of reimplantation of lunar atmospheric ions and of solar wind Ar was determined using the 235U-136Xe dating method that relies on secondary cosmic-ray neutron-induced fission of 235U. We identified the trapped, fissiogenic, and cosmogenic noble gases in lunar breccia 14307 and lunar soils 70001-8, 70181, 74261, and 75081. Uranium and Th concentrations were determined in the 74261 soil for which we obtain the 235U-136Xe time of implantation of Ga ago. On the basis of several cosmogenic noble gas signatures we calculate the duration of this near surface exposure of 393 +/- 45 Ma and an average shielding depth below the lunar surface of 73 +/- 7 g/cm2. A second, recent exposure to solar and cosmic-ray particles occurred after this soil was excavated from Shorty crater 17.2 +/- 1.4 Ma ago. Using a compilation of all lunar data with reliable trapped Ar isotopic ratios and pre-exposure times we infer a calibration curve of implantation times, based on the trapped 40Ar/36Ar ratio. A possible trend for the increase with time of the solar 3He/4He and 20Ne/22Ne ratios of about 12%/Ga and about 2%/Ga, respectively, is also discussed.
1995GeCoA..59.4983R|1995|Noble gases and nitrogen released from lunar soils by acid etching|Rider, Paul E., Pepin, Robert O., Becker, Richard H.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|59|23|4983|A stepwise acid-etching technique similar to the closed system stepwise etching (CSSE) method developed at ETH Zurich was used to examine the solar wind reservoirs of lunar soil grains. Samples were treated with weak acids (H <SUB>2</SUB>O, H <SUB>2</SUB>SO <SUB>3</SUB>) to facilitate the release of the most shallowly implanted gases. Noble gas abundances and isotopic compositions, including Kr and Xe in some cases, and a few nitrogen data were obtained for mineral or grain-size separates of three lunar soils (plagioclase from 60051, pyroxene from 75081, and <25 ym bulk 79035). The 60051 plagioclase grains, considered to be a possibly unique resource for determining the modern-day solar wind composition, show unusually low contents of solar wind He, Ne, and particularly Ar, but do not otherwise possess any characteristics clearly attributable to a modem-day solar wind exposure. Initial water and acid treatments of the grains, however, release an apparently pure SEP component. The 75081 pyroxene and the size separate of bulk 79035 both yield Kr and Xe compositions in initial etch steps that are characteristic of undiffused solar wind, significantly increasing the database for measurements of solar wind Kr and Xe where possible laboratory thermal diffusion and fractionation effects are not a concern. Pyroxene in particular appears to be a suitable alternative to ilmenite for the purpose of making measurements of this kind. Nitrogen release by acid etching is not at present quantitative, and while it appears possible to obtain reasonable isotopic ratios for solar wind N, we are unable to use the technique to determine solar nitrogen to noble gas ratios. Light noble gases in all three soil separates, other than the aforementioned behavior of 60051, appear to behave in accord with expectations based on acid-etching analyses performed by the Züirich group.

M.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|12||529|The concentration of surface (low temperature site) and interior (high temperature site) Cd, Zn, and Pb in 13 Apollo 16 highland fines samples, pristine rock 65325, and mare fines sample 75081 were analyzed directly from the thermal release profiles obtained by flameless atomic absorption technique (FLAA). Cd and Zn in pristine ferroan anothosite 65325, anorthositic grains of the most mature fines 65701, and basaltic rock fragments of mare fines 75081 were almost all surface Cd and Zn indicating that most volatiles were deposited on the surfaces of vugs, vesicles and microcracks during the initial cooling process. A considerable amount of interior Cd and Zn was observed in agglutinates. This result suggests that high temperature site interior volatiles originate from entrapment during the lunar maturation processes. Interior Cd found in the most mature fines sample 65701 was only about 15% of the total Cd in the sample. Interior Pb present in Apollo 16 fines samples went up to 60%. From our Cd studies we can assume that this interior Pb in highland fines samples is largely due to the radiogenic decay which occurred after the redistribution of the volatiles took place. We obtained an average age of 4.0 b.y. for the parent rocks of Apollo 16 highland regolith from our interior Pb analyses.

H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2249|An Apollo 17 surface fines sample 75081,78, collected from Station 5, was extracted and examined fluorometrically. No porphyrins were found with fluorometric methods capable of detecting 2 times 10 to the minus 14th moles/g of Ni-mesoporphyrin IX in the sample. Also aromatic hydrocarbons were undetected.
1974LPSC....5.2919T|1974|Implications of electric wave velocities for Apollo 17 rock powders.|Talwani, P., Nur, A., Kovach, R. L.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||2919|Ultrasonic P- and S-wave velocities of lunar rock powders 172701, 172161, 170051, and 175081 were measured at room temperature and to 2.5 kb confining pressure. The results compare well with those of terrestrial volcanic ash and powdered basalt. P-wave velocity values up to pressures corresponding to a lunar depth of 1.4 km preclude cold compaction alone as an explanation for the observed seismic velocity structure at the Apollo 17 site. Application of small amounts of heat with simultaneous application of pressure causes rock powders to achieve equivalence of seismic velocities for competent rocks.
1974E&PSL..23..206L|1974|Chemical composition of boulder-2 rocks and soils, Apollo 17, station 2|Laul, J. C., Schmitt, R. A.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|23|2|206|Forty-two elements have been measured via INAA and RNAA in six samples of five rocks from a 2-m tan-gray boulder-2 breccia (South Massif), in four soils from the South Massif and a valley soil. The chemical composition of the four metaclastic rocks corresponds to "high alumina" (52% Pl) and medium-K KREEP-type rocks. Rock 72335,2 is a medium K anorthositic gabbro (74% Pl). Both the North and South Massifs appear to be medium-K KREEP in composition and thus may represent a single stratigraphic unit of the Serenitatis basin event. Four soils of the South Massif are identical in composition to medium-K KREEP; they are more feldspathic and lower in LIL trace elements relative to the boulder-2 rocks. The valley soil 75081 is like the 10084 soil; both soils are high in TiO <SUB>2</SUB> and both are deficient in KREEP. Th and U give a sharp distinction between the valley and highland soils. The South Massif rocks and soils contain siderophiles at the 2-4% Cl level and show an ancient meteoritic pattern. Five samples of the four rocks have Ir/Au ratios of ± 0.02 which we assign to the Serenitatis basis planetesimal. The valley soil at Camelot Crater has low siderophiles (1% Cl). Our systematic study of four shadowed and exposed soils does not support the labile hypothesis for Cd, In, Tl and Zn. We observe no volatile (atmophile) movement from the South Massif highland soils to the valley soil 75081. The volatiles Cs and Tl appear to have been fractionated in the boulder-2 rocks during cratering, brecciation and metamorphic processes. The uniform ratio of FeO/MnO = 80-85, observed for all previous mare and highland sites, also holds for the Taurus-Littrow site.

The ilmenites, particularly in 74241, contain up to 7.8 wt.% MgO and display higher bireflectance than low-Mg ilmenites. They commonly contain exsolution-like chromite and rutile and occasionally are in association with native Fe in an assemblage probably resulting from reduction. The chromian ulvöspinels are similar to Apollo 11 spinels in that they contain near-equal amounts of chromite and ulvöspinel molecules. No primary chromites were observed. Most native Fe has No and Co contents of < 1 wt.%; some in 74220 contained 5-6% Ni and < 1% Co in association with schreibersite. All armalcolites examined are optically and chemically similar and the common mantling by Mg ilmenite leads us to conclude they are the ortho-armalcolite of S.E. Haggerty. We have collected optical (reflectivety and bireflectance) and microhardness data for the ilmenites, ulvöspinels and armalcolites. These are the first microhardness determinations for the last two minerals.
