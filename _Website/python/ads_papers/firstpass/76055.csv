2017M&PS...52..584T|2017|Impact history of the Apollo 17 landing site revealed by U-Pb SIMS ages|Thiessen, Fiona, Nemchin, Alexander A., Snape, Joshua F., Whitehouse, Martin J., Bellucci, Jeremy J.|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|52|4|584|Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) U-Pb ages of Ca-phosphates from four texturally distinct breccia samples (72255, 76055, 76015, 76215) collected at the Apollo 17 landing site were obtained in an attempt to identify whether they represent a single or several impact event(s). The determined ages, combined with inferences from petrologic relationships, may indicate two or possibly three different impact events at 3920 ± 3 Ma, 3922 ± 5 Ma, and 3930 ± 5 Ma (all errors 2σ). Searching for possible sources of the breccias by calculating the continuous ejecta radii of impact basins and large craters as well as their expected ejecta thicknesses, we conclude that Nectaris, Crisium, Serenitatis, and Imbrium are likely candidates. If the previous interpretation that the micropoikilitic breccias collected at the North Massif represent Serenitatis ejecta is correct, then the average <SUP>207</SUP>Pb/<SUP>206</SUP>Pb age of 3930 ± 5 Ma (2σ) dates the formation of the Serenitatis basin. The occurrence of zircon in the breccias sampled at the South Massif, which contain Ca-phosphates yielding an age of 3922 ± 5 Ma (2σ), may indicate that the breccia originated from within the Procellarum KREEP terrane (PKT) and the Imbrium basin appears to be the only basin that could have sourced them. However, this interpretation implies that all basins suggested to fall stratigraphically between Serenitatis and Imbrium formed within a short (<11 Ma) time interval, highlighting serious contradictions between global stratigraphic constraints, sample interpretation, and chronological data. Alternatively, the slightly older age of the two micropoikilitic breccias may be a result of incomplete resetting of the U-Pb system preserved in some phosphate grains. Based on the currently available data set this possibility cannot be excluded.

2014GeCoA.131...62S|2014|Characterization of the dominant impactor signature for Apollo 17 impact melt rocks|Sharp, Miriam, Gerasimenko, Iva, Loudin, Lorne C., Liu, Jingao, James, Odette B., Puchtel, Igor S., Walker, Richard J.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|131||62|Concentrations of the highly siderophile elements (HSE) Re, Os, Ir, Ru, Pt, and Pd and <SUP>187</SUP>Os/<SUP>188</SUP>Os isotopic compositions are reported for seven Apollo 17 impact melt rocks. These data are used to examine the dominant chemical signature of the impactor that formed the melts. Six of the samples (72355, 72435, 72535, 76035, 76055, and 76135) have poikilitic textures; one sample (73235) has an aphanitic texture. Data for the samples define linear correlations when Ir is plotted versus other HSE concentrations, with y-intercepts indistinguishable from zero for most HSE in most rocks. Scatter about some of the trends, and occasional trends with positive y-intercepts, indicate either mixing of additional components that are heterogeneously distributed within several rocks, or modest fractionation of some HSE by volatilization, crystal fractionation, or other processes, during formation and evolution of the melt sheet. There is no statistical difference between the aphanitic and poikilitic samples in terms of HSE ratios after visible granulitic clasts were removed from aphanite 73235. Hence, earlier speculations that the two types of impact melt rocks at this site may have been generated by different impactors are not supported by our data. Most Apollo 17 samples examined here and in prior studies are characterized by very similar HSE signatures, consistent with a common impactor. These samples are characterized by elevated Ru/Ir, Pd/Ir, and Re/Os, relative to most chondrites. Collectively, the data indicate that the impactor was characterized by the following HSE ratios (2σ): Re/Ir 0.093 ± 0.020, Os/Ir 1.03 ± 0.28, Ru/Ir 1.87 ± 0.30, Pt/Ir 2.36 ± 0.31, Pd/Ir 1.85 ± 0.41, and present-day <SUP>187</SUP>Os/<SUP>188</SUP>Os of 0.1322 ± 0.0013. The results most likely mean that the impactor was a body with a bulk composition that was just outside the range of meteoritic compositions currently sampled on Earth.
1992Metic..27R.284R|1992|A Distinct Poikilitic Impact Melt Rock from the Apollo 17 Landing Site that is not from the Serenitatis Melt Sheet|Ryder, G.|Meteoritics|27|3|284|A poikilitic impact melt rock fragment in a sample from Boulder 1, Station 2, is distinct and important: 1) no such poikilitic- textured melt rock has been observed in Boulder 1 before; 2) although superficially similar to typical coarse samples of the Serenitatis melt sheet, it is chemically and petrographically distinct from them. It extends the known range of significant low-K Fra Mauro impact melt rock compositions that potentially can provide us with information about lunar crustal components and structure. Lunar sample 72255 is a fine-grained aphanitic melt representing Boulder 1 on the South Massif. It contains many clasts, including granitic fragments, but more typically fine basaltic-composition impact melts, feldspathic breccias, and granulitic impactites. The aphanitic melt groundmass of 72255 is distinct in composition from typical Serenitatis impact melt samples, but even if it formed in a distinct event, the relative ages are radiometrically indistinguishable (at present). The discovery of a poikilitic impact melt rock fragment during new investigations of 72255 at first led me to conclude that Boulder 1 contained fragments of the Serenitatis melt sheet, hence must be slightly younger. However, a closer inspection and analysis reveals that this fragment is distinct from the Serenitatis melt sheet samples, thus stratigraphy cannot be inferred from it. The distinction of the fragment instead gives it a different potential significance, that of furthering our understanding of crustal components. The fragment was observed in saw-cut faces as a sharply defined pale brown clast embedded in the groundmass. It was about 7 mm in diameter, although not all was exposed. The fragment was crystalline, with dark brown pyroxenes, white plagioclases, and a pale yellow minor phase. Its texture and the presence of small vugs suggested an igneous rock, and it was chipped for chemical and thin section studies. The thin section revealed a clast-bearing impact melt rock with pyroxene oikocrysts, plagioclase chadacrysts, and ilmenite chains, very similar to Apollo 15, 16, and 17 coarser poikilitic impact melt samples. The chemistry of its mineral phases (both clasts and groundmass) is identical with Apollo 17 poikilitic boulder samples, e.g., pigeonite oikocrysts with a range of En82- 70. It does contain rather more high-Ca pyroxene oikocrysts than do the poikilitic boulders: pig/cpx of 2 rather than about 4. The oikocrysts, about a millimeter across, contain many plagioclase chadacrysts. They are normally zoned outward from their cores, with superimposed normal zoning toward each plagioclase chadacryst. The clasts are dominantly plagioclases, with some olivine and rare lithic fragments such as a feldspathic granulite. A small amount of olivine may have crystallized from the melt, but none forms oikocrysts. The INAA shows the melt rock fragment to be a little higher in Ca and a little lower in Fe than the poikilitic boulders. The main difference is the much lower abundance of all large ion lithophile elements in the new clast, e.g., Sm 8 ppm cf. 15 ppm in the poikilitic boulders. This result was confirmed by analysis of both a second chip and a second analysis of the first chip. The difference is far too great to result merely from a larger clast content in the new fragment; the chemistry suggests an entirely separate impact event, not a phase of Serenitatis. The higher modal clinopyroxene suggests the same. The melt rock fragment is also distinct from the few other unique Apollo 17 melts, such as 76055, or any of the Apollo 15 and 16 poikilitic melts. It extends the range of known low-K Fra Mauro samples, and gives us more potential to understand both the lunar crust, and Boulder 1. Its investigation will continue with more complete mineralogical and chemical data, an age determination, and a detailed comparison with all other known poikilitic melt samples.
1977PhDT.........7D|1977|Constraints on the composition and chemical evolution of the earth's moon|Delano, J. W.|Ph.D. Thesis||||The origin, composition, and evolution of the earth's moon remain controversial topics in the post-Apollo era. In an attempt to provide additional constraints on these complex, multifaceted problems, three topics were investigated. Chapter 2 involves the experimental determination of the melting relations for three rocks (63545; 76055; 76015) from the lunar highlands. The experiments were performed for the purpose of establishing whether any of these compositions could have been derived by partial melting of the lunar interior. The results suggest that none of these rocks are likely to have originated by partial melting of either cosmic or differentiated reservoirs at any depth in the moon. Instead, these samples are probably impact-melts of a multilithologic system in the lunar crust. Chapter 3 mathematically evaluates the possibility of generating the abundances of Sr, Ce, Sm, and Yb in three, highlands noritic rocks (62295; 76015; 15386) by partial melting of cosmic reservoirs. Chapter 4 describes the calculation and melting relations of a refractory, moon composition.

W.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2097|The experiments discussed were conducted for the purpose of placing additional constraints on the origin of lunar highlands noritic compositions. The sample 63545 represents a fine-grained, crystalline melt rock consisting of pink spinel, plagioclase, divine, interstitial glass, minor oxides, and metal. According to Chao (1973), 76055 is an olivine-bearing micronorite hornfels with abundant xenocrysts and xenoliths. The sample 76015 is a vesicular, poikilitic impact melt with a homogeneous matrix. The obtained experimental melting relations of 63545, 76055, and 76015, are examined, taking into account experimental petrology and trace element chemistry of mare basalts. It is concluded that the studied compositions do not represent magmas derived by partial melting of either cosmic or differentiated source regions at any pressure in the moon. Presently available information would seem to favor an origin by impact-fusion of several highlands components.

The gas retention age of 75055 raises the lower limit for the time of formation of all lunar basins. Of the breccia represents metamorphosed Serenitatis basin ejecta, then the formation of at least 28 lunar basins occurred between 3.82 × 10 <SUP>9</SUP> and 4.05 × 10 <SUP>9</SUP> yr ago. The formation of these basins during a timespan of only about 0.2 × 10 <SUP>9</SUP> yr is consistent with the very rapid decrease of the flux of crater-forming projectiles that collided with the Moon about 4.0 × 10 <SUP>9</SUP> yr ago. According to Hartman and Wood this could be due to a catastrophic event in the Earth-Moon system at that time.
