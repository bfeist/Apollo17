2009PhDT.......253H|2009|Mineralogy, petrology, and chronology of the lunar granulitic breccias|Hudgins, Jillian Amy|Ph.D. Thesis||||Before the return of the Apollo and Luna samples, many basic geological questions about the Moon remained unanswered. The study of returned samples, in addition to remote sensing data and the growing collection of meteorites has revealed that the Moon is a geologically complex body with a history dominated by impact events. Lunar meteorites provide samples of the crust far removed from the Apollo landing sites and are probably more representative of the average lunar crust. SaU 300 was previously misclassified as an anorthositic regolith breccia. Here, I reclassify it as a polymict crystalline impact-melt breccia with an anorthositic norite bulk composition. SaU 300 is a new meteorite that is unpaired with any of the currently known lunar meteorite samples. The main objective of this study was to gain a better understanding of the early evolution of the Moon by studying some of the oldest samples available: the granulitic breccias. The following samples were studied: Apollo samples 60035, 77017, 78155, and 79215 and paired meteorites NWA 3163/4881/4483. Granulitic breccias exhibit poikiloblastic to granoblastic matrix textures and occur as individual rocks and as fragments in impact-melt rocks, the regolith, and in lunar meteorites. These rocks contain 70 -- 80% anorthite, low concentrations of incompatible trace elements, and moderately high concentrations of siderophile elements. Their history was dominated by impact events and thermal metamorphism. Matrix pyroxenes in the granulitic breccias last equilibrated at ̃1050+/-50°C. 40Ar/39Ar data reveal that 60035, 77017, and 78155 have peak metamorphic ages of 4.1 Ga, while 79215 has a peak metamorphic age of 3.9 Ga. NWA 3163 has a peak metamorphic age of 3.3 Ga. Samples 60035, 77017, and NWA 4881 were partially reset by low temperature heating events following metamorphism. Granulitic breccias have been described as "homogeneous on a millimetre scale" throughout the literature. Although they appear to be compositionally homogeneous under petrographic and electron microscopes EMP analysis shows that they retain relic igneous minor and trace element zoning in their larger mafic mineral clasts. Based on the results of this study, I proposed that granulitic breccias form beneath thick, superheated melt sheets associated with impact basins and that they were heated for 104 -- 106 years.
2008GeCoA..72.5781H|2008|A laser probe <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar and INAA investigation of four Apollo granulitic breccias|Hudgins, Jillian A., Spray, John G., Kelley, Simon P., Korotev, Randy L., Sherlock, Sarah C.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|72|23|5781|Infrared laser probe <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar geochronology, instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and analytical electron microscopy have been performed on four 0.5 × 1.0 × 0.3 cm polished rock tiles of Apollo 16 and 17 granulitic breccias (60035, 77017, 78155, and 79215). Pyroxene thermometry indicates that these samples were re-equilibrated and underwent peak metamorphic sub-solidus recrystallization at 1000-1100 °C, which resulted in homogeneous mineral compositions and granoblastic textures. <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar data from this study reveal that three samples (60035, 77017, and 78155) have peak metamorphic ages of ̃4.1 Ga. Sample 79215 has a peak metamorphic age of 3.9 Ga, which may be related to Serenitatis basin formation. All four samples contain moderately high concentrations of meteoritic siderophiles. Enhanced siderophile contents in three of the samples provide evidence for projectile contamination of their target lithologies occurring prior to peak metamorphism. Post-peak metamorphism, low-temperature (<300 °C) events caused the partial resetting of argon in the two finer-grained granulites (60035 and 77017). These later events did not alter the mineralogy or texture of the rocks, but caused minor brecciation and the partial release of argon from plagioclase. Interpretation of the low-temperature data indicates partial resetting of the argon systematics to as young as 3.2 Ga for 60035 and 2.3 Ga for 77017. Cosmic ray exposure ages range from 6.4 to ̃339 Ma. Our results increase the amount of high-precision data available for the granulitic breccias and lunar highlands crustal samples. The results demonstrate the survival of pre-Nectarian material on the lunar surface and document the effects of contact metamorphic and impact processes during the pre-Nectarian Epoch, as well as the low-temperature partial resetting of ages by smaller impact events after 3.9 Ga. The mineralogy and chemical composition of these rocks, as well as exhumation constraints, indicate that the source of heat for metamorphism was within kilometers of the surface via burial beneath impact-melt sheets or hot ejecta blankets.
1993LPI....24..369C|1993|The Granulite Suite: Impact Melts and Metamorphic Breccias of the Early Lunar Crust|Cushing, J. A., Taylor, G. J., Norman, M. D., Keil, K.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference|24||369|The granulite suite consists of two major types of rocks. One is coarse-grained and poikilitic with many euhedral crystals of olivine and plagioclase. These characteristics indicate crystallization from a melt; the poikilitic granulites are impact melt breccias. The other group is finer-grained and granoblastic, with numerous triple junctions; the granoblastic granulites are metamorphic rocks. Compositional groups identified by Lindstrom and Lindstrom contain both textural types. Two pyroxene thermometry indicates that both groups equilibrated at 1000 to 1150 C. Calculations suggest that the granoblastic group, which has an average grain size of about 80 microns, was annealed for less than 6 x 10 exp 4 y at 1000 C, and for less than 2500 y at 1150 C. Similar equilibration temperatures suggest that both groups were physically associated after impact events produced the poikilitic melts. Granulitic impactites hold important information about the pre-Nectarian bombardment history of the Moon, and the composition and thermal evolution of the early lunar crust. Granulitic impactites are widely considered to be an important rock type in the lunar crust, but how they formed is poorly understood. Metal compositions and elevated concentrations of meteoritic siderophile elements suggest that most lunar granulites are impact breccias. Their occurrence as clasts in approximately 3.9 Ga breccias, and Ar-(40-39) ages greater than or = 4.2 Ga for some granulites show that they represent a component of the lunar crust which formed prior to the Nectarian cataclysm. Petrographic characteristics of lunar granulites indicate at least two endmember textural variants which apparently formed in fundamentally different ways. One type has granoblastic textures consisting of equant, polygonal to rounded grains, and abundant triple junctions with small dispersions around 120 degrees indicating a close approach to textural equilibrium. As suggested by many authors, granoblastic granulites probably formed by subsolidus annealing and recrystallization of fragmental or glassy protoliths. Examples of this type include 15418, 78155, and 79215. The other textural type consists of poikilitic to poikiloblastic rocks with euhedral to subhedral plagioclase and olivine enclosed by interstitial pyroxene. In some cases, the texture resembles that of an orthocumulate. Examples of this type include 60035, 67955, and 77017. Rounding of grain edges is common in poikilitic granulites, but the regular crystal shapes and widely dispersed dihedral angles show they are far from textural equilibrium. <The textures of poikilitic granulites are more consistent with the formation of these rocks by crystallization from a melt than by subsolidus metamorphism. &A few samples have been recognized with textural characteristics transitional between those of the granoblastic and poikiloblastic endmembers (e.g., 72559, 78527). Pyroxene compositions taken from the literature and determined for this study by electron microprobe were used to calculate equilibration temperatures. The Kretz Ca transfer (solvus) thermometer and the Lindsley and Anderson graphical method both give similar temperatures, which range from approximately 1000 to 1150 C. There is no apparent temperature difference between granoblastic and poikilitic varieties, but there is a hint in these data that the more ferroan varieties equilibrated to lower temperatures. *Additional studies are in progress to test this possibility.
1986JGR....91D.263L|1986|Lunar granulites and their precursor anorthositic norites of the early lunar crust|Lindstrom, Marilyn M., Lindstrom, David J.|Journal of Geophysical Research|91|B4|D263|Lunar granulites are breccias with metamorphic textures. They are not pristine, having been contaminated with meteoritic siderophiles. Nonetheless, they constitute an abundant class of highlands rocks that are important because they are ancient and KREEP-free. They may represent our best samples of the early lunar crust. The granulites can be divided into ferroan and magnesian groups, and each group can be subdivided on the basis of mineral composition and REE concentrations. Textural and compositional data show that some of the granulites (especially 67215 and 67415) may be derived from distinct anorthositic norite precursors, while some other granulites (79215, 78155) are clearly polymict. Even the polymict granulites probably had anorthositic norites as their dominant precursors, and not anorthosites, norites, or troctolites. The granulites have compositions similar to those of the two lunar meteorites, one of which (Yamato-791197) is ferroan, the other (ALHA81005) magnesian. These meteorites are soil breccias from an unknown location distant from the Apollo landing sites and contain anorthositic norites as abundant clasts. Compositions of granulites and lunar meteorites more closely resemble the average composition of lunar highlands, as determined by remote sensing, than do those of any other returned lunar samples. The predominance of plutonic anorthositic norite precursors in material having the composition typical of highlands suggests that plutonic anorthositic norites were more abundant in the early lunar crust than is implied by their scarcity among pristine rocks from Apollo missions.

E.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2007|Polymict breccia 78155, which has a bulk composition of anorthositic norite, was brecciated and thermally metamorphosed before the final lunar bombardment of 4.0-3.9 eons. The constituents of the granoblastic matrix and the characteristics of the clasts and the mafic silicates are described. The clasts represent the lunar crust prior to 4.2 eons, the age of the granoblastic matrix. The persistence of uninverted pigeonite in matrix and clasts indicates that metamorphism was at a very high temperature and may have been terminated catastrophically. Evidence that the rock was further brecciated after thermal metamorphism is reported.
