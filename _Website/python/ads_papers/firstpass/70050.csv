2016P&SS..126....1T|2016|Evaluations of lunar regolith simulants|Taylor, Lawrence A., Pieters, Carle M., Britt, Daniel|Planetary and Space Science|126||1|Apollo lunar regolith samples are not available in quantity for engineering studies with In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU). Therefore, with expectation of a return to the Moon, dozens of regolith (soil) simulants have been developed, to some extent a result of inefficient distribution of NASA-sanctioned simulants. In this paper, we review many of these simulants, with evaluations of their short-comings. In 2010, the NAC-PSS committee instructed the Lunar Exploration Advisory Group (LEAG) and CAPTEM (the NASA committee recommending on the appropriations of Apollo samples) to report on the status of lunar regolith simulants. This report is reviewed here-in, along with a list of the plethora of lunar regolith simulants and references. In addition, and importantly, a special, unique Apollo 17 soil sample (70050) discussed, which has many of the properties sought for ISRU studies, should be available in reasonable amounts for ISRU studies.
1994E&PSL.126....1M|1994|Primitive <SUP>87</SUP>Sr/<SUP>86</SUP>Sr from an Archean barite and conjecture on the Earth's age and origin|McCulloch, Malcolm T.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|126|1-3|1|A primitive measured<SUP>87</SUP>Sr/<SUP>86</SUP>Sr ratio of 0.700510 ± 9 is reported for an early Archean (3450 Ma) barite from the Pilbara Block of Western Australia. The low <SUP>87</SUP>Rb/<SUP>86</SUP>Sr ratio in the barite (0.00015) enables a precise initial <SUP>87</SUP>Sr/<SUP>86</SUP>Sr ratio of 0.700502 ± 10 to be calculated at 3450 Ma. This initial ratio is the same as that previously inferred for mineral separates from Onverwacht Group basalts of similar age and, if reliable, implies a relatively high <SUP>87</SUP>Sr/<SUP>86</SUP>Sr ratio of 0.70050 ± 2 for the early Archean mantle. Assuming that the upper mantle has become progressively depleted in Rb/Sr due to the growth of continental crust, then this allows an estimate to be placed on the Earth's initial Sr ratio of 0.69940 ± 10 (relative to NBS 987 = 0.71021). This ratio, designated 'BEBI' (Bulk Earth Best Initial), is significantly higher than that measured for the Moon (LUNI = 0.69900 ± 2) or the well-characterised achondrite Angra dos Reis (ADOR = 0.69893 ± 2). Assuming a <SUP>87</SUP>Rb/<SUP>86</SUP>Sr ratio of ̃ 0.4 ( ̃ 50% of chondrites) for the terrestrial precursors gives an accretion interval for the Earth of ̃ 60-100 Ma after ADOR and ̃ 40-80 Ma after the formation of the Moon. This chronology is compatible with either an early ( ̃ 4540 Ma) impact origin for the Moon or, alternatively, a late-stage ( ̃ 4480 Ma) giant impact, with the Moon being derived predominantly from a low <SUP>87</SUP>Sr/<SUP>86</SUP>Sr (0.6990) impactor. In both scenarios the final accretion of the Earth was completed relatively late at ̃ 4480 Ma. An ̃ 60-100 Ma timescale for the accretion of the Earth is consistent with Pb isotopic constraints for core formation and also allows an extended interval for cooling of the terrestrial magma ocean, and hence avoids the dilemma of a highly differentiated early Earth.
