2008GeCoA..72.4874A|2008|The U Pb systematics of angrite Sahara 99555|Amelin, Yuri|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|72|19|4874|Angrite Sahara 99555 (hereafter SAH), precisely dated by Baker et al. (Baker J., Bizzarro M., Wittig N., Connelly J. and Haack H. (2005) Early planetesimal melting from an age of 4.5662 Gyr for differentiated meteorites. Nature436, 1127-1131), has been proposed as a new reference point for the early Solar System timescale and for calculation of the revised minimum age of our Solar System. The Pb-Pb age of SAH of 4566.18 ± 0.14 Ma, reported by Baker et al., differs from the Pb-Pb age of D'Orbigny, another basaltic angrite, of 4564.42 ± 0.12 Ma (Amelin Y. (2008) U-Pb ages of angrites. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta72, 221-232), despite the fact that the relative <SUP>53</SUP>Mn- <SUP>53</SUP>Cr and <SUP>182</SUP>Hf- <SUP>182</SUP>W ages of these meteorites are identical. Here I report U-Pb data for 21 whole rock and pyroxene fractions from SAH, analyzed using the same approach as D'Orbigny (Amelin, 2008). These fractions contain between 1.3 and 8.9 pg of total common Pb, slightly more than analytical blank. Measured <SUP>206</SUP>Pb/ <SUP>204</SUP>Pb ratios are between 625 and 2817 for D'Orbigny, blank-corrected <SUP>206</SUP>Pb/ <SUP>204</SUP>Pb ratios are between 1173 and 6675. Eight acid-washed whole rock fractions yielded an isochron age of 4564.86 ± 0.38 Ma, MSWD = 1.5. Data for pyroxene fractions plot mostly above the whole rock isochron, and do not form a linear array in <SUP>207</SUP>Pb/ <SUP>206</SUP>Pb vs. <SUP>204</SUP>Pb/ <SUP>206</SUP>Pb isochron coordinates. The <SUP>207</SUP>Pb <SUP>∗</SUP>/ <SUP>206</SUP>Pb <SUP>∗</SUP> model dates of the pyroxene fractions vary from 4563.8 ± 0.3 to 4567.1 ± 0.5 Ma. The difference between whole rock and pyroxene U-Pb systematics may be a result of re-distribution of radiogenic Pb at a mineral grain scale several million years after crystallization. Complexities of Sm-Nd, Lu-Hf, and possibly <SUP>26</SUP>Al- <SUP>26</SUP>Mg mineral systematics of SAH, described previously, may be related to the same process that caused the re-distribution of radiogenic Pb. Disturbance of isotopic chronometers renders SAH an imperfect anchor for the early Solar System timescale. The problems with age determination revealed by the studies of SAH call for greater attention in Pb-isotopic dating of angrites and other achondrites.
