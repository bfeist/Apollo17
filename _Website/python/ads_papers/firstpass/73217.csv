While much of Earth’s impact record has been erased, its Moon preserves an extensive history of bombardment. Quantifying the timing of lunar impact events is crucial to understanding how impacts have shaped the evolution of early Earth, and provides the basis for estimating the ages of other cratered surfaces in the Solar System. Many lunar impact melt rocks are complex mixtures of glassy and crystalline “melt” materials and inherited clasts of pre-impact minerals and rocks. If analyzed in bulk, these samples can yield complicated incremental release 40Ar/39Ar spectra, making it challenging to uniquely interpret impact ages. Here, I have used a combination of high-spatial resolution 40Ar/39Ar geochronology and thermal-kinetic modeling to gain new insights into the impact histories recorded by such lunar samples. To compare my data to those of previous studies, I developed a software tool to account for differences in the decay, isotopic, and monitor age parameters used for different published 40Ar/39Ar datasets. Using an ultraviolet laser ablation microprobe (UVLAMP) system I selectively dated melt and clast components of impact melt rocks collected during the Apollo 16 and 17 missions. UVLAMP 40Ar/39Ar data for samples 77135, 60315, 61015, and 63355 show evidence of open-system behavior, and provide new insights into how to interpret some complexities of published incremental heating 40Ar/39Ar spectra. Samples 77115, 63525, 63549, and 65015 have relatively simple thermal histories, and UVLAMP 40Ar/39Ar data for the melt components of these rocks indicate the timing of impact events—spanning hundreds of millions of years—that influenced the Apollo 16 and 17 sites. My modeling and UVLAMP 40Ar/39Ar data for sample 73217 indicate that some impact melt rocks can quantitatively retain evidence for multiple melt-producing impact events, and imply that such polygenetic rocks should be regarded as high-value sampling opportunities during future exploration missions to cratered planetary surfaces. Collectively, my results complement previous incremental heating 40Ar/39Ar studies, and support interpretations that the Moon experienced a prolonged period of heavy bombardment early in its history.

2009GeCoA..73.3093G|2009|Thermal history recorded by the Apollo 17 impact melt breccia 73217|Grange, M. L., Nemchin, A. A., Pidgeon, R. T., Timms, N., Muhling, J. R., Kennedy, A. K.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|73|10|3093|Lunar breccia 73217 is composed of plagioclase and pyroxene clasts originating from a single gabbronorite intrusion, mixed with a silica-rich glass interpreted to represent an impact melt. A study of accessory minerals in a thin section from this breccia (73217,52) identified three different types of zircon and anhedral grains of apatite which represent distinct generations of accessory phases and provide a unique opportunity to investigate the thermal history of the sample. Equant, anhedral zircon grains that probably formed in the gabbronorite, referred to as type-1, have consistent U-Pb ages of 4332 ± 7 Ma. A similar age of 4335 ± 5 Ma was obtained from acicular zircon (type-2) grains interpreted to have formed from impact melt. A polycrystalline zircon aggregate (type-3) occurs as a rim around a baddeleyite grain and has a much younger age of 3929 ± 10 Ma, similar to the 3936 ± 17 Ma age of apatite grains found in the thin section. A combined apatite-type-3 zircon age of 3934 ± 12 Ma is proposed as the age of the Serenitatis impact event and associated thermal pulse. X-ray mapping and electron probe analyses showed that Ti is inhomogeneous in the zircon grains on the sub-micrometer scale. However, model temperatures estimated from SHRIMP analyses of Ti-concentration in the 10 μm diameter spots on the polished surfaces of type-1 and type-2 zircons range between about 1300 and 900 °C respectively, whereas Ti-concentrations determined for the type-3 zircon are higher at about 1400-1500 °C. A combination of U-Pb ages, Ti-concentration data and detailed imaging and petrographic studies of the zircon grains shows that the gabbronorite parent of the zircon clasts formed shortly before the 4335 ± 5 Ma impact, which mixed the clasts and the felsic melt and projected the sample closer to the surface where fast cooling resulted in the crystallization of acicular zircon (type-2). The 3934 ± 12 Ma Serenitatis event resulted in partial remelting of the glass and formation of polycrystalline zircon (type-3). This event also reset the U-Pb system of apatite, formed merrillite coronas around some apatite grains, and probably re-equilibrated some pyroxenes in the clasts. Although there have been arguments for pre-3.9 Ga impacts based on other types of samples, the age of the acicular zircon at 4335 ± 5 Ma provides the first evidence of impact melt significantly predating the lunar cataclysm. Our data, combined with other chronological results, demonstrate the occurrence of pre-3.9 Ga impacts on the Moon and suggest that the lunar impact history consisted of a series of intense bombardment episodes interspersed with relatively calm periods of low impact flux.

H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference|39|1391|2405|Lunar breccia 73217 consists largely of a uniformly granitic (7.5% K<SUB>2</SUB>O) mesostasis glass, which imparts high alkalis, including 2% K<SUB>2</SUB>O, to the bulk-rock. The origin of this breccia is enigmatic. The mesostasis may not in the strictest sense be impact melt.

S., Meyer, C.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|89||B525|U-Pb age determinations on four lunar zircons from existing thin-sections of one highland breccia, 73217, using the recently constructed ion microprobe SHRIMP, are reported. The analytical reproducibility of SHRIMP is demonstrated, and procedures for measuring Pb/U, Th/U, and corecting for initial Pb are explained. Electron microprobe analyses for the zircons are also are reported. The results show that the four zircons survived the lunar cataclysm without any identifiable effects on their U-Pb systematics. All four indicate a single age of 4356 +23 or -14 m.y. The zircons have experienced small variable amounts of Pb loss since crystallization, from almost zero up to about 10 percent. If this occurred during one later event, then age of the latter is between 1100 and 2300 m.y.

1983LPSC...13..631I|1983|Petrological and Thermal Histories of a Lunar Breccia 73217 AS Inferred from Pyroxene Crystallization Sequences, Exsolution Phenomena and Pyroxene Geothermometry|Ishii, T., McCallum, S., Ghose, S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|88||631|Electron probe microanalyses, X ray diffraction studies, and pyroxene geothermometry of blue-gray breccia 73217 indicate a record of an early plutonic period and a later thermal event. The breccia contains two domains; one (breccia A) contains coarse orthopyroxene clasts, whereas the other (breccia B) contains coarse pigeonite clasts. Pyroxene trends, deduced from pyroxene clasts from breccias A and B, are analogous to the early and late fractionation stages, respectively, of terrestrial basic layered intrusions. Minor element compositions of both augite and Ca-poor pyroxenes from breccias A and B vary continuously with FeO/(MgO + FeO) ratio. Optical and X ray observations reveal that pyroxene clasts show a great variety of exsolution textures, but that individual pyroxene grains show relatively simple and less intensive exsolution patterns. There is no overlap in mineral compositions of pyroxenes as well as plagioclase and ilmenite clasts between breccias A and B. These characteristics are consistent with a model that the coarse mineral clasts of both breccias A and B possibly originated from the same relatively small layered intrusion, i.e., breccia A being derived from an early stage (1100°-1060°C±20°C) and B from a later stage of fractionation (1060°-1050°C). Both breccias experienced a later common annealing event (1040°-1070°C).

L.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||249|Blue-gray breccia 73217 represents a brecciated and partially melted assemblage of plutonic rock fragments. The textural and chemical evidence leads to the conclusion that the melt was generated within the lunar crust and that subsequent cooling and crystallization occurred prior to the transportation of this rock to the surface. The melt generated in this fashion, by in situ melting at depth, of moderately Mg-rich rocks, produced a liquid enriched in Fe, Ti, K, and P which could produce sodic ferrogabbro and granitic rocks similar to the light portion of 12013, but not KREEP.
