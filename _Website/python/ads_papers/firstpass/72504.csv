1987JGR....92E.526J|1987|A potpourri of regolith breccias: “New” samples from the Apollo 14, 16, and 17 landing sites|Jerde, Eric A., Warren, Paul H., Morris, Richard V., Heiken, Grant H., Vaniman, David T.|Journal of Geophysical Research|92|B4|E526|Forty suspected regolith breccias from the Apollo 14, 16, and 17 landing sites were studied as part of a search for regolith samples exotic to the small traverse areas associated with these missions, as well as a general effort to constrain the nature and origins of regolith breccias. Of these 40 samples, 31 are indeed regolith breccias. Regolith breccias from Apollo 14 exhibit much greater compositional diversity than their soil (sensu stricto) counterparts: 14004,55 displays incompatible element concentrations about 1.4× those found in typical Apollo 14 regolith, while 14315 is radically different in many respects (higher Al, lower Mg and Fe, lower incompatible elements) from all other Apollo 14 regolith materials, and hence probably exotic to the Apollo 14 traverse area. Application of “mixing” models to Apollo 14 regolith materials suggests that whereas “normal” Apollo 14 regolith contains only slightly more ferroan anorthosite (FA) than alkali anorthosite (AA) and far more KREEP than FA and AA combined, 14315 contains more FA than KREEP and roughly 10 times more FA than AA. Three “new” regolith breccias from Apollo 16 bring to 20 the total number of regolith breccias that have been analyzed for Mg and Fe from the site. The molar Mg/(Mg + Fe) (or mg<SUP>*</SUP>) ratios of lunar regolith breccias are of great interest, because lunar-meteorite ALHA81005 has a much higher mg<SUP>*</SUP> than two other lunar-meteoritic regolith breccias (Y791197 and Y82192/3), even though these three samples are remarkably similar in all other compositional respects. A bimodality in mg<SUP>*</SUP> among Apollo 16 regolith breccias may result from: (1) statistical scattering among the small number of samples, (2) a tendency for older regolith breccias from this site to be compositionally distinct from their younger counterparts, or (3) differences between the Cayley and Descartes Formations. Among 10 samples from Apollo 17, all but one proved to be typical Apollo 17 regolith breccias. However, 72504,10 is >99% pure pyroclastic glass, compositionally identical to the Apollo 17 orange glass (74220), even though 72504,10 was obtained at a location over 4 km from Shorty Crater where 74220 was obtained. The nearly pure concentration of 74220-identical glass spherules in 72504,10 attests to the widespread distribution of these distinctive deposits.

T.|Journal of Geophysical Research|92||E526|Compositional (by INAA) and petrographic studies were performed among the smaller rocks (not analyzed previously) from the Apollo 14, 16, and 17 sites as part of a search for regolith samples exotic to the small traverse areas associated with these missions. Of the 40 samples studied, 31 were regolith breccias. Among these, three of the Apollo 14 samples proved to be compositionally unique, particularly the 14315 sample, which is radically different from all other Apollo 14 regolith materials (lower Mg and Fe, far higher Al and far lower REE abundances), and is probably exotic to the Apollo 14 traverse area. Among 10 samples from Apollo 17, all but one proved to be typical Apollo 17 regolith breccia. However, the 72504,10 sample is more than 99 percent pure pyroclastic glass, compositionally identical to the Apollo 17 orange glass obtained at a location 4 km away, attesting to the widespread distribution of orange glass deposits.
