The <SUP>147</SUP>Sm-<SUP>143</SUP>Nd, <SUP>146</SUP>Sm-<SUP>142</SUP>Nd, and Rb-Sr ages derived from plagioclase, olivine, and pyroxene mineral isochrons yield concordant ages of 4307 ± 11 Ma, 4299<SUP>+29</SUP>/<SUB>-35</SUB> Ma, and 4279 ± 52 Ma, respectively. These ages are slightly younger than the age determined on ferroan anorthosite suite (FAS) rock 60025 and are therefore consistent with the traditional magma ocean model of lunar differentiation in which the Mg-suite is intruded into the anorthositic crust. However, the Sm-Nd ages record when the rock passed below the closing temperature of the Sm-Nd system in this rock at ∼825 °C, whereas the Rb-Sr age likely records the closure temperature of ∼650 °C. A cooling rate of 3.9 °C/Ma is determined using the ages reported here and in the literature and calculated closure temperatures for the Ar-Ar, Pb-Pb, Rb-Sr, and Sm-Nd systems. This cooling rate is in good agreement with cooling rates estimated from petrographic observations. Slow cooling can lower apparent Sm-Nd crystallization ages by up to ∼80 Ma in the slowest cooled rocks like 76535, and likely accounts for some of the variation of ages reported for lunar crustal rocks. Nevertheless, slow cooling cannot account for the overlap in FAS and Mg-suite rock ages. Instead, this overlap appears to reflect the concordance of Mg-suite and FAS magmatism in the lunar crust as indicated by ages calculated for the solidus temperature of 76535 and 60025 of 4384 ± 24 Ma and 4383 ± 17, respectively. Not only are the solidus ages of 76535 and 60025 nearly concordant, but the Sm-Nd isotopic systematics suggest they are derived from reservoirs that were minimally differentiated prior to ∼4.38 Ga. Although the Sr isotopic composition of 60025 indicates its source was minimally differentiated, the Sr isotopic composition of 76535 indicates it underwent fractionation just prior to solidification of the 76535. These observations are consistent with both a magma ocean or a serial magmatism model of lunar differentiation. In either model, differentiation of lunar source regions must occur near the solidification age of thee samples. Perhaps the best estimate for the formation age of lunar source regions is the Rb-Sr model age of the 76535 source region age of 4401 ± 32 Ma. This is in good agreement with Sm-Nd model ages for the formation of ur-KREEP and suggests that differentiation of a least part of the Moon could not have occurred prior to ∼4.43 Ga.

2015EGUGA..17.8498H|2015|Constraints on lunar dynamo mechanism for interpreting lunar-wide magnetic field|Hemant Singh, Kumar, Kuang, Weijia|EGU General Assembly Conference Abstracts|17||8498|Moon, once considered an in-active celesitial body, surprisingly showed evidences of magnetized crust in satellite and returned samples from Apollo mission. Several mechanisms have been suggested in the past for the origin of the lunar magnetization, but the origin of the magnetization remains unknown. Among the suggested mechanisms is the paleo lunar dynamo, i.e. the crustal magnetization was acquired in an internal magnetic field generated by a dynamo once operated in the lunar core. A key for this to work is that the generated field strength should be sufficient to explain observations. The paleo field strengths from the past paleomagnetic measurements of returned samples show that they vary from different sample sites, ranging from 33.3 (±8.18) to 5430 (±1330) nT. Results from the satellite data are more than an order of magnitude weaker than those from the samples. The dynamo field strength could be significantly weaker. Simple envelope estimation of magnetic induction can lead to the necessary condition for a dynamo is magnetic Reynolds number ≥ 10, which is approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than that estimated for the Earth's core. Our estimation with a strong-field lunar dynamo suggests that the field strengths are between 155 and 700 nT, depending on the lunar core size. This estimation is consistent with more recent results from paleomagnetic analysis of Apollo sample (76535) which provides paleointensity of the Moon to be at least 300 to 1000 nT.

L.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||GP51B|Apollo-era paleomagnetic studies of lunar samples suggested that the Moon generated an ancient core dynamo. However, the temporal evolution of the magnetic field was unclear. One group proposed that the lunar dynamo ceased by 3.6 Ga, and that all paleointensity determinations from younger samples were indistinguishable from zero (Cisowski and Fuller, 1986). A second group proposed that the lunar dynamo persisted to at least 3.1 Ga, but surface field intensities declined to values 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than those during the period of 3.9-3.65 Ga (Runcorn, 1996). Recent re-analysis of samples 76535, 10020, and 10017 confirm that a lunar core dynamo generated a long-lived, stable magnetic field from 4.2 Ga to at least 3.6 Ga, with ~ 70 μT fields at 3.6-3.7 Ga (Garrick-Bethell et al., 2009; Shea et al., 2012; Suavet et al., 2012). Determining when the dynamo ultimately decayed is difficult because retrieving high-fidelity paleointensities for weak fields is difficult for the vast majority of lunar samples due to their poor magnetic recording properties (Tikoo et al., 2012). Thus far, no lunar samples with ages < 3.6 Ga have been reported which unambiguously record a thermoremanence (TRM) acquired while cooling in the presence of a core dynamo-generated field. We investigated the state of the lunar dynamo after 3.6 Ga by studying the natural remanent magnetization of high magnetic fidelity mare basalts 15597 (~ 3.3 Ga) and 12022 (~ 3.2 Ga). Our alternating field and thermal demagnetization as well as rock magnetic data indicate that, by 3.2 Ga, any surface fields on the Moon were too weak (< 7 μT) to be retrieved by our methods. Because our upper limit of 7 μT is consistent with predictions of dynamo scaling laws, it is possible that the lunar dynamo was still active at 3.2 Ga (Dwyer et al., 2011; LeBars et al., 2011). Nevertheless. such weak fields contrast strongly with the 60-70 μT paleointensities inferred for the Moon just 300-400 million years earlier. Furthermore, although Apollo-era paleointensity compilations have identified lunar paleofields ranging from 0.1-10 μT at 3.3 Ga to <200 Ma, we have recently shown that many or all of these values are likely only upper limits (Tikoo et al. 2012).

Previously proposed symplectite formation mechanisms include crystallization of trapped interstitial melt, diffusion of Cr from cumulus olivine, and/or remobilization of cumulus chromite grains. These mechanisms would imply that the highly Cr-depleted nature of Mg-suite parental magmas and their source materials inferred from cumulus olivine may be illusory. We have conducted a detailed petrologic and textural study of symplectites, as well as chromite veins, intercumulus assemblages, olivine-hosted melt inclusions and clinopyroxene-troilite veins in 76535 with the goals of constraining the origin of the symplectites, and the degree of Cr-depletion in Mg-suite magmas relative to other lunar basalts. Orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene in melt inclusions are depleted in Cr relative to their symplectite counterparts, averaging 900 and 1200 ppm vs. 7400 and 8100 ppm Cr<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>, respectively. Olivine in contact with symplectite assemblages may exhibit a diffusion profile of Cr going into olivine, whereas olivine boundaries away from symplectites show no diffusion profile. There is also a distinct lack of primary chromite as inclusions in cumulus phases and melt inclusions. Multiple textural observations, melt inclusion chemistry, and modeling of chromite-olivine equilibrium rule out previously proposed symplectite formation mechanisms, and strongly suggest that chromite was not a primary crystallization product of the 76535 parental magma. Accordingly, the post-cumulus addition of Cr and Fe is required to produce the symplectites. After considering multiple models, the addition of Cr and Fe to 76535 via infiltration metasomatism by an exogenous chromite-saturated melt is the model most consistent with multiple textural and geochemical observations. Failure of models that call upon Cr diffusion out of olivine grains imply that the observed Cr-depleted nature of olivine observed in many Mg-suite lithologies is a primary feature of the Cr-depleted nature of the Mg-suite parental magmas and their source materials. This substantial depletion of Cr in the magma relative to mare basalt magmas still requires a satisfactory explanation in order to be consistent with Mg-suite petrogenetic models and currently accepted bulk-Moon compositions. Additionally, if the intimate interaction of migrating melts with early lunar crustal lithologies was a widespread phenomenon after LMO solidification, it provides another mechanism by which to reset or delay closure of radiogenic isotopic systems and explain the Mg-suite-ferroan anorthosite age overlap.

However, a longstanding problem has been interpreting the unstable alternating field (AF) demagnetization behavior observed in the remaining majority of the Apollo lunar sample suite. Similar unstable behavior has also been observed for many meteorites. It is unclear whether the behavior of these samples indicates that they formed in the absence of an ancient magnetizing field or whether they simply have poor magnetic recording properties. It is necessary to distinguish between these two possibilities in order to determine whether paleomagnetic fields were present on a sample's parent body. To address this issue, we analyzed five samples whose rock magnetic properties span the full suite of observed demagnetization behaviors: mare basalts 15556, 15016, 12017, 10020, and troctolite 76535. We demonstrate that the effects of spurious anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) during AF demagnetization, in combination with multidomain magnetic carriers and magnetic remanence anisotropy, are likely responsible for the apparently poor magnetic behavior of many lunar samples. Therefore, the unstable AF demagnetization behavior observed for many lunar samples is not alone sufficient for ruling out the presence of an ancient lunar core dynamo. Nevertheless, spurious ARM may explain the observation of surprisingly high (≥1 μT) Apollo-era paleointensity measurements for samples thought to have formed after the cessation of a lunar core dynamo (<1.5 Ga).
2012AGUFM.P43B1930H|2012|Water in a young Moon constrained from ferroan anorthosites|Hui, H., Peslier, A. H., Zhang, Y., Neal, C. R.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||P43B|One of the most important conclusions resulting from the Apollo and Luna missions was the lack of water detected in the returned samples or at the surface of the Moon. This notion has been included in most geophysical and geochemical models of lunar formation and evolution. The view of an anhydrous lunar interior, however, has been challenged by the recent discoveries of hydrogen in picritic glass beads, apatites and olivine melt inclusions that were facilitated by the improvements of analytical detection limit of hydrogen. Indigenous water is now considered to be heterogeneously distributed in the lunar interior, some parts containing as much water as Earth's upper mantle. Hydrogen isotopic compositions of apatites in mare basalts have been used to identify the source of this water, with results indicating a combination of indigenous lunar water, water from comets, and solar wind protons. However, magma ocean crystallization modeling suggests that the water contents estimated for the lunar mantle from mare basalts may be overestimated. We present here measurements of water in the primary products of the lunar magma ocean (LMO) in order to potentially bypass the processes of later addition of water through impact event and/or solar wind implantation, and to estimate the water content of the Moon's interior at the time of the magma ocean crystallization, and that of the mare basalt source regions. Ferroan anorthosite is the only available lithology that is believed to be a primary product of the LMO. It is generally understood that plagioclase, after crystallization, floated in the LMO and formed ferroan anorthosite as the original permanent crust of the Moon. Therefore, any indigenous water preserved in pristine ferroan anorthosite was partitioned from the LMO. Using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, we have measured ~6 ppm of indigenous water as hydroxyl species in plagioclases from ferroan anorthosite 15415 and 60015. As plagioclase becomes a liquidus phase after 80% LMO crystallization, we calculated the initial water content of the latter to have been ~320 ppm H2O. Water accumulated in the final 2 vol.% LMO residuum as crystallization proceeded could reach amounts of ~1.4 wt.%. We therefore show that water has been present in the lunar interior since its earliest history, during LMO formation and crystallization. This water can affect magma ocean crystallization dynamics and the following mantle cumulate overturn process, and hence the genesis of the mare basalts. Furthermore, the amount of water calculated for the LMO is sufficient to explain those detected in lunar mare basalts, which are thought to be derived from more recently remelted magma ocean cumulates. Finally, ~6 ppm of indigenous water measured in ferroan anorthosite together with up to ~2.7 ppm that we have detected in plagioclase of troctolite 76535 may contribute a significant portion to the trace amount of water/hydroxyl recently detected on the surface of the lunar highland crust by spacecraft.

L.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||GP11B|Following the Apollo missions, twenty years of paleomagnetic studies of returned samples have failed to demonstrate unambiguously the existence of an ancient lunar core dynamo. As a result of new technologies, more robust analytical methods, and a better understanding of rock magnetism, it is now possible to revisit lunar paleomagnetism. A set of criteria that must be met in order to demonstrate that a sample has recorded a core dynamo field has been defined: the samples must not show petrologic evidence of shock, the magnetization must be a stable thermoremanent magnetization (TRM), mutually oriented subsamples should agree in direction and intensity, and the thermal history should be well constrained, with a cooling timescale longer than the lifetime of impact generated fields (>1h). A critical review of the literature has allowed us to identify Apollo samples that are most likely to provide good records of ancient lunar magnetic fields. The first samples to be studied within this framework were troctolite 76535 (Garrick-Bethell et al., 2009) and mare basalt 10020 (Shea et al., 2010), which have recorded a core dynamo field at 4.2 and 3.7 Ga, respectively. Mare basalt 10017 is a fine grained, vesicular, high-K ilmenite basalt with a crystallization age of 3.6 Ga. It was studied by different groups (Fuller and Meshkov, 1979; Hoffman et al., 1979; Runcorn et al., 1970; Stephenson et al., 1977), all of whom noted the stability of its magnetization. We have measured 7 subsamples of chip 10017,378. Their magnetizations agree in direction, with a low coercivity overprint removed by 10 mT AF demagnetization, and a stable high coercivity component consistent with a TRM. Paleointensity estimations give a conservative minimum of 12 μT for the paleofield. This sample is ~100 Myr younger than the end of the late heavy bombardment, which rules out basin-forming impacts as a possible candidate to explain its magnetization. It extends the lifetime of the putative ancient lunar core dynamo well after thermal convection of the liquid core could have sustained an Earth-like lunar dynamo, thereby supporting non-standard dynamo scenarios such as a mechanical-stirring driven dynamo that could have been triggered by lunar librations from Earth tides or by impacts.

Osmium isotopes permit more refined discrimination than previously possible of samples that have been contaminated by meteoritic additions and the new results show that some rocks, previously identified as pristine, contain meteorite-derived HSE. Low HSE abundances in FAN and MGS rocks are consistent with derivation from a strongly HSE-depleted lunar mantle. At the time of formation, the lunar floatation crust, represented by FAN, had 1.4 ± 0.3 pg g <SUP>- 1 </SUP> Os, 1.5 ± 0.6 pg g <SUP>- 1 </SUP> Ir, 6.8 ± 2.7 pg g <SUP>- 1 </SUP> Ru, 16 ± 15 pg g <SUP>- 1 </SUP> Pt, 33 ± 30 pg g <SUP>- 1 </SUP> Pd and 0.29 ± 0.10 pg g <SUP>- 1 </SUP> Re (̃ 0.00002 × CI) and Re/Os ratios that were modestly elevated ( <SUP>187</SUP>Re/ <SUP>188</SUP>Os = 0.6 to 1.7) relative to CI chondrites. MGS samples are, on average, characterised by more elevated HSE abundances (̃ 0.00007 × CI) compared with FAN. This either reflects contrasting mantle-source HSE characteristics of FAN and MGS rocks, or different mantle-crust HSE fractionation behaviour during production of these lithologies. Previous studies of lunar impact-melt rocks have identified possible elevated Ru and Pd in lunar crustal target rocks. The new results provide no supporting evidence for such enrichments. If maximum estimates for HSE in the lunar mantle are compared with FAN and MGS averages, crust-mantle concentration ratios ( D-values) must be ≤ 0.3. Such D-values are broadly similar to those estimated for partitioning between the terrestrial crust and upper mantle, with the notable exception of Re. Given the presumably completely different mode of origin for the primary lunar floatation crust and tertiary terrestrial continental crust, the potential similarities in crust-mantle HSE partitioning for the Earth and Moon are somewhat surprising. Low HSE abundances in the lunar crust, coupled with estimates of HSE concentrations in the lunar mantle implies there may be a 'missing component' of late-accreted materials (as much as 95%) to the Moon if the Earth/Moon mass-flux estimates are correct and terrestrial mantle HSE abundances were established by late accretion.
2010AGUFMGP43B1049T|2010|Fidelity of Mare Basalts as Magnetic Recorders and Implications for Lunar Paleomagnetism|Tikoo, S. M., Weiss, B. P., Buz, J., Silva, M. G., Grove, T. L., Gattacceca, J.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||GP43B|Forty years after the Apollo program, the source of the magnetization observed in the lunar crust and in returned samples remains unresolved. The two leading explanations for lunar remanent magnetism are transient magnetic fields created by impact events and the existence of an ancient lunar core dynamo. In order for a lunar sample to present strong evidence that it acquired its primary remanent magnetism from an ancient lunar dynamo, several criteria should be met. First, the sample should not bear any petrologic evidence of shock, implying a peak pressure of ≤ 5 GPa. Then, during demagnetization experiments, the natural remanent magnetization (NRM) ideally should converge to a stable direction, with intensity decreasing towards the origin. The magnitude and direction of primary magnetic remanence should also agree across mutually oriented subsamples. Finally, the initial cooling timescale for the sample should be ≥ ~1 hour in order to effectively rule out impact events as magnetizing field sources. Recent studies on lunar troctolite 76535 (Garrick-Bethell et al. 2009) and ilmenite basalt 10020 (Shea et al. 2010) have demonstrated that these samples meet all of the aforementioned criteria and support the possibility that an ancient lunar dynamo existed at 4.2 Ga and 3.7 Ga, respectively. However, the stable magnetic behaviors observed in 76535 and 10020 appear to represent exceptions rather than the rule when compared to the rest of returned lunar samples. The vast majority of lunar samples subjected to paleomagnetic studies display chaotic NRM behavior, evidenced by non-monotonic decline of magnetic moment and unstable directions of magnetization when undergoing demagnetization experiments (see Brecher, 1976). Before a lunar dynamo can be a fully accepted, it is vital to demonstrate that the poor magnetic behaviors evident in the rest of the lunar sample collection do not indicate the absence of a magnetic field. Here we present results of a study which investigates the alternating field (AF) demagnetization behavior and magnetic recording capacities of mare basalts 15556, 12017 and 15016. All of these samples appear to be unshocked (peak pressures ≤ 5 GPa) and have cooling timescales longer than the expected duration of impact fields. Our results reveal that these three samples display unstable AF demagnetization behavior. The samples also appear to be imprecise paleointensity recorders of fields with intensities under ~ 30 μT (near the lower bound of the Earth’s present field strength), at least when measured using AF demagnetization. Based on these findings, we posit that many lunar samples are intrinsically unable to preserve robust paleointensity records of magnetic fields when analyzed using AF methods. Therefore, their chaotic demagnetization behavior does not rule out the existence of an ancient lunar dynamo.
2010AGUFMGP42A..04F|2010|Lunar Paleomagnetism: The Case for an Ancient Lunar Dynamo. (Invited)|Fuller, M., Weiss, B. P., Gattacceca, J.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||GP42A|The failure of lunar samples to satisfy minimal criteria for classical paleointensity determinations has led to skepticism of the case for an ancient lunar dynamo. There are however practical and fundamental reasons why such experiments are doomed to failure in most lunar samples. In such methods, NRMs in successive blocking temperatures ranges are thermally demagnetized and replaced with partial thermoremanent magnetization (pTRMs) given in a known field (Thellier, 1938). A practical difficulty is that it is hard to heat lunar samples without altering them. A fundamental problem is that whereas pottery, for which these methods were designed, carries a primary (TRM) from its initial cooling and little secondary magnetization, lunar samples are likely to carry weak field isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) and shock remanent magnetization (SRM) as secondary overprints. Thermal demagnetization does not isolate weak field IRM well. For example, on thermal demagnetization of the Apollo sample 14053.48 carrying a 2000nT TRM with a superposed 5mT IRM, the IRM persists to the Curie point obscuring the TRM. Fortunately, weak field IRM is removed by AF demagnetization to fields comparable to that in which it is acquired. Furthermore, Gattacceca et al. (2008) demonstrated that experimentally generated SRM from several GPa, like weak field IRM, is demagnetized by AF fields of between ~20 and 30 mT, leaving the pre-shock remanent magnetization essentially untouched. This agrees with our theoretical understanding of SRM, which at pressures below approximately the Hugoniot elastic limit (several GPa for most rocks) should essentially be a pressure remanent magnetization (e.g., Dunlop and Ozdemir, 1997). Unlike IRM, SRM in the range of a few GPa may carry recoverable lunar field records (Gattacceca et al., 2008). NRM in samples shocked to less than ~5 GPa, which is stable against AF demagnetization beyond the fields necessary to eliminate weak SRM (~20-30 mT), requires some other explanation. Such NRM carried by the small amount of single domain iron and iron nickel present in the samples can be very stable. The troctolite 76535 is an example of such a sample. It cooled over thousands of years, or longer, which is far too long for any possible transient fields associated with impacts and must carry a TRM like NRM. Note that despite predictions that even km sized craters may generate fields up to 0.1T at 1 crater radius, no unambiguous evidence for paleomagnetic recording of such fields over individual craters has materialized. There are numerous other candidate samples having experienced <~5 GPa carrying stable NRM, which have been analyzed, or are being presently investigated. The only other obvious source of a field to explain stable TRM in lunar rocks is that of surface lunar fields, but over the mare these are too weak to account for the NRM of mare basalts. In summary, recent advances in our understanding of SRM and reanalysis of lunar paleomagnetism lead us to conclude that lunar paleomagnetism is most easily explained by a lunar dynamo.

L., Fuller, M.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||DI33B|The discovery of remnant magnetization in returned Apollo samples and the lunar crust has long suggested that the Moon has a metallic core and once had a core-dynamo magnetic field (Fuller and Cisowski, 1987). However, the association of magnetization with the antipodes of impact basins suggests that meteoroid impacts may also be the source of lunar magnetization (e.g., Hood and Artemieva, 2008). Distinguishing between these two hypotheses is difficult as most lunar samples are poor recorders of paleomagnetic fields (Fuller and Cisowski, 1987; Tikoo et al., 2010). Since impact-generated shock waves can remagnetize low-coercivity (<~30 mT) grains, samples must have high coercivities and show no petrographic evidence for shock (Gattacceca et al., 2009). Recent paleomagnetic analyses of one lunar sample, troctolite 76535, observed a stable NRM blocked up to >200 mT (Garrick-Bethell et al., 2009). The slow cooling timescale of this rock (millions of years) relative the lifetime of impact-produced fields (<1 day maximum) suggests that the moon had a core dynamo at 4.2 Ga. We present a new paleomagnetic study of another high coercivity, unshocked lunar rock, mare basalt 10020. This sample records evidence for lunar magnetism 500 Ma after troctolite 76535. Our results suggest it too has a stable NRM acquired over timescales that are long relative to impact-produced fields. 10020 is a fine-grained, vesicular, ilmenite basalt with a 40Ar/39Ar age of 3.72 ±0.04 Ga that is within error of Rb/Sr crystallization ages of similar composition Apollo 11 basalts (Geiss et al., 1977, Guggisberg et al., 1979). Collinson et al. (1972) and Stephenson et al. 1977 found that a 10020 has one of the most stable NRMs of any studied lunar sample (blocked up to >65 mT). We have now found that two mutually oriented samples of 10020 have a stable (> 65-80 mT) origin-trending unidirectional NRM component. Petrographic analyses of this sample find no evidence for shock such as alteration to maskelynite or fracturing. Pressure remanent experiments on 10020 show that the magnetism could not have been produced by an impact. We therefore suggest that the magnetization recorded in 10020 was generated by a core dynamo. We are currently conducting Ar/Ar dating and further magnetic analyses to further test this hypothesis.

Our new paleointensity experiments on four samples use modern absolute and relative measurement techniques, with ages ranging from 3.3 to 4.3 Ga, bracketing the putative period of an ancient lunar field. Samples 60015 (anorthosite) and 76535 (troctolite) failed during absolute paleointensity experiments. Samples 72215 and 62235 (impact breccias) recorded a complicated, multi-component magnetic history that includes a low-temperature (<500 °C) component associated with a high intensity (̃90 μT) and a high temperature (>500 °C) component associated with a low intensity (̃2 μT). Similar multi-component behavior has been observed in several published absolute intensity experiments on lunar samples. Additional material from 72215 and 62235 was subjected to a relative paleointensity experiment (a saturation isothermal remanent magnetization, or sIRM, experiment); neither sample provided unambiguous evidence for a thermal origin of the recorded remanent magnetization. We test several magnetization scenarios in an attempt to explain the complex magnetization recorded in lunar samples. Specifically, an overprint from exposure to a small magnetic field (an isothermal remanent magnetization) results in multi-component behavior (similar to absolute paleointensity results) from which we could not recover the correct magnitude of the original thermal remanent magnetization. In light of these new experiments and a thorough re-evaluation of existing paleointensity measurements, we conclude that although some samples with ages of 3.6 to 3.9 Ga are strongly magnetized, and sometimes exhibit stable directional behavior, it has not been demonstrated that these observations indicate a primary thermal remanence. Particularly problematic in the interpretation of lunar sample magnetizations are the effects of shock. As relative paleointensity measurements for lunar samples are calibrated using absolute paleointensities, the lack of acceptable absolute paleointensity measurements renders the interpretation of relative paleointensity measurements unreliable. Consequently, current paleointensity measurements do not support the existence of a 3.9-3.6 Ga lunar dynamo with 100 μT surface fields, a result that is in better agreement with satellite measurements of crustal magnetism and that presents fewer challenges for thermal evolution and dynamo models.

Our new paleointensity experiments on four Apollo samples use modern absolute and relative measurement techniques. Our samples (60015, 76535, 72215, 62235) have ages ranging from 3.3 to 4.2 Ga, bracketing the putative period of a lunar dynamo. Samples 60015 (anorthosite) and 76535 (troctolite) failed during absolute paleointensity experiments, using the IZZI-modified Thellier-Thellier method. Samples 72215 and 62235 recorded a complicated, multi-component magnetic history that includes a low temperature (< 500°C) component with a high intensity (~90 μT), and a high temperature (> 500°C) component with a low intensity (~2 μT). These two samples were also subjected to a relative paleointensity experiment (sIRM), from which neither provided unambiguous evidence for a thermal origin of the recorded remanent magnetization. We found similar multi-component behavior in several published experiments on lunar samples. We test and present several magnetization scenarios in an attempt to explain the complex magnetization recorded in lunar samples. Specifically, an overprint from exposure to a small magnetic field (i.e. IRM) results in multi-component behavior (similar to lunar sample results), from which we could not recover the correct magnitude of the original TRM. The non-unique interpretation of these multi-component results combined with IRM (isothermal remanent magnetization) contamination during Apollo sample return ( Strangway et al., 1973), indicates that techniques incapable of distinguishing between single- and multi-component records (e.g., sIRM), cannot be reliably used to infer magnetic conditions of the early Moon. In light of these new experiments and a thorough reevaluation of existing paleointensity measurements, we conclude that there is a paucity of lunar samples that demonstrate a primary thermal remanent magnetization. As relative paleointensity measurements for lunar samples are calibrated using absolute paleointensities, the lack of acceptable absolute paleointensity measurements renders the interpretation of relative paleointensity measurements unreliable. Consequently, current lunar paleointensity measurements are inadequate to determine the existence and strength of an early lunar magnetic field. Surface magnetometry measurements and the return of magnetically uncontaminated samples from future missions are much needed for further progress in understanding the characteristics and origin of lunar crustal remanent magnetization.

Stewart, Domeneghetti, M. Chiara, Schwartz, Jeffrey M., Mullen, Emily K., Zema, Michele, Cámara, Fernando, McCammon, Catherine, Ganguly, Jibamitra|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|70|24|6068|We have determined cooling rates of orthopyroxene crystals from two Mg-suite lunar samples (gabbronorite 76255 and troctolite 76535) and one terrestrial sample (orthopyroxenite SC-936 from the Stillwater Complex), on the basis of their Fe-Mg ordering states. In addition, a cooling rate of 76255 was determined by modeling the formation of exsolution lamellae in pyroxenes. The M1-M2 site occupancies of the orthopyroxene crystals were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction and the rate constant for the ordering reaction was used along with calibrations of the equilibrium intracrystalline fractionation of Fe and Mg as a function of temperature to calculate cooling rates. The closure temperatures ( T<SUB>C</SUB>) of cation ordering are ̃525 °C for 76255, ̃500 °C for 76535 and ̃350 °C for SC-936 corresponding to cooling rates of ̃4 × 10 <SUP>-2</SUP> °C/year at the closure temperature for the lunar samples and ̃10 <SUP>-6</SUP> °C/year for the Stillwater sample. A cooling rate for 76255, determined by simulating the exsolution process, is 1.7 × 10 <SUP>-2</SUP> °C/year at a closure temperature for exsolution of 700 °C. The Fe-Mg ordering cooling rate determined for 76535 reflects a complex thermal history superimposed on the initial plutonic provenance established for this sample [McCallum, I.S., Schwartz, J.M., 2001. Lunar Mg suite: thermobarometry and petrogenesis of parental magmas. J. Geophys. Res.106, 27969-27983]. The preservation of a crystallization age of 4.51 Ga and a metamorphic age of 4.25 Ga for 76535 is consistent with a model in which excavation of this sample from the lower lunar crust took place while the sample was at a temperature above the closure temperatures for the Sm-Nd, U-Pb and Ar-Ar isotopic systems. Temperatures in excess of the isotopic closure temperatures (i.e., >600 °C) in the lower lunar crust were maintained by heat diffusing from concentrations of U- and Th-rich KREEP material at the base of the crust. On the other hand, 76255 formed at a much shallower depth in the lunar crust (̃2 km) and was well below its isotopic closure temperatures at the time of excavation, most likely during the Serenitatis basin-forming impact event. Both lunar samples were reheated during transport to the surface and deposition in hot ejecta blankets. The reheating was short lived but apparently sufficient to redistribute Fe and Mg in M sites in orthopyroxenes. For the lunar samples, the cooling rates based on Fe-Mg ordering represent final stage cooling within an ejecta blanket.
2001JGR...10627969M|2001|Lunar Mg suite: Thermobarometry and petrogenesis of parental magmas|McCallum, I. S., Schwartz, J. M.|Journal of Geophysical Research|106|E11|27969|Using compilations of internally consistent thermodynamic data on minerals and advances in quantifying the energetics of crystalline solid solutions, we have recalculated the pressures and temperatures of equilibration of troctolite sample 76535 and a number of spinel cataclasites. The five phase assemblage (olivine+orthopyroxene+clinopyroxene+Cr-spinel+plagioclase), which occurs in symplectite assemblages in 76535, gives equilibration temperatures from 800°-900°C and pressures from 200 to 250 MPa, indicating a deep (40-50 km) crustal source. Spinel cataclasite assemblages give minimum pressures of ~100 MPa. Mg suite magmas were apparently intruded throughout the lunar crust early in lunar history. The textures and equilibration temperatures in many Mg suite samples are consistent with subsolidus recrystallization and the Mg-rich minerals of some refractory troctolites and dunites may be residues of a crustal melting process or products of subsolidus elemental redistribution. The Sm-Nd age of 4.26+/-0.06Ga of troctolite 76535 most likely represents the time of subsolidus recrystallization and/or partial melting. In an attempt to identify the primary source material for the Mg suite magmas, a variety of models were tested using the MELTS and MAGFOX codes. A good fit between mineral compositions and crystallization sequences is obtained by ~20% batch melting at 0.5 GPa of an average whole Moon composition with an Mg # of 0.85. Melts formed by batch melting at higher pressures and melts formed by polybaric partial fusion over the pressure range from 2.0 to 0.3 GPa were either too poor in Mg and/or crystallized clinopyroxene before orthopyroxene. Mixing with 10-20% urKREEP, which is required to satisfy the REE constraints of the Mg suite, reduces the Mg # of the parental magmas and requires a whole Moon Mg # closer to that of the terrestrial mantle.

The data indicate that the cumulate was in isotopic equilibrium with a fluid or magma characterized by a high U-238/Pb-204 (mu) value of 600 at 4.236 Ga. Two and three stage Pb evolution calculations define even greater source mu values of about 1000, assuming low lunar initial mu values between 5 and 40 prior to about 4.43 Ga. These results are similar to mu values for KREEP sources and are also consistent with values from 78235, suggesting that at least some high-Mg suite rocks were derived from magma sources with high-mu values similar to KREEP, and support that idea that these rocks postdate primary lunar differentiation and formation of ferroan anorthosites.

Twice as much material was collected from the North Massif as from the South Massif and its landslide (the apparent disproportionate collecting at the mare sites is mainly a reflection of the large size of a few individual basalt samples). Descriptions of the collection, documentation, and nature of the samples are given. A comprehensive catalog is currently being produced. Many of the samples have been intensely studied over the last 20 years and some of the rocks have become very familiar and depicted in popular works, particularly the dunite clast (72415), the troctolite sample (76535), and the station 6 boulder samples. Most of the boulder samples have been studied in Consortium mode, and many of the rake samples have received a basic petrological/geochemical characterization.

Long-exposure X ray precession photographs indicate that all classes of diffracted intensities are equally sharp. The final weighted R-factor for all reflections is 0.042. The results indicate that Na is ordered into the A(000) and A(0i0), and that there may be up to 10% vacancy in these two sites. The vacancy is consistent with a significant deviation from stoichiometry in the electron microprobe analyses. Two of the four A sites are modeled using split atom positions indicating substantial positional disorder in the primitive structure. Observed cation ordering is consistent with slow cooling above the I1̄ to P1̄ transition, and there is no conclusive evidence of cation ordering in violation of body-centering.

A description is presented of noble gas studies of separated minerals from 76535. The quantity of fission xenon from the in situ decay of Pu-244 provides further evidence for different, mineral-specific, isotopic closure times. The presented data shows that 76535 loses its surface-correlated xenon component upon disaggregation. No other xenon component is lost. The presence of solar gases in 76535 would seem to argue in favor of the external acquisition of the parentless extinct isotope effects and consequently favor 'thermal diffusion' and 'adsorption' over local redistribution models.
1980luhc.conf..419H|1980|Fission xenon in troctolite 76535.|Hohenberg, C. M., Hudson, B., Kennedy, B. M., Podosek, F. A.|Lunar Highlands Crust|||419|Xenon released in stepwise heating of troctolite 76535 shows remarkable similarity to that from the gas-rich breccias. The low temperature fractions are highly enriched in fissiogenic xenon from Pu-244. Although the quantity of fission xenon is not inconsistent with reported age data, release patterns demonstrate that this component is not due to in situ decay. However, in contrast with the gas-rich breccias, the parentless radionuclear component in 76535 is not accompanied by solar wind xenon. Mechanisms for the emplacement of this component in 76535 cannot, therefore, involve exposure on the lunar surface but most likely involve adsorption along intergranular boundaries or thermally driven redistribution. The fact that xenon released from a gas-poor igneous cumulate can mimic that from gas-rich breccias, except for the presence of solar wind xenon in the latter, suggests that direct exposure to space is not required for the incorporation of these weakly bound, surface-correlated, parentless radionuclear components in lunar samples.
1980GeCoA..44.2111W|1980|Moon and Earth : compositional differences inferred from siderophiles, volatiles, and alkalis in basalts|Wolf, Rainer, Anders, Edward|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|44|12|2111|We have compared RNAA analyses of 18 trace elements in 25 low-Ti lunar and 10 terrestrial oceanic basalts. According to Ringwood and Kesson, the abundance ratio in basalts for most of these elements approximates the ratio in the two planets. Volatiles (Ag, Bi, Br, Cd, In, Sb, Sn, Tl, Zn) are depleted in lunar basalts by a nearly constant factor of 0.026 ± 0.013, relative to terrestrial basalts. Given the differences in volatility among these elements, this constancy is not consistent with models that derive the Moon's volatiles from partial recondensation of the Earth's mantle or from partial degassing of a captured body. It is consistent with models that derive planetary volatiles from a thin veneer (or a residuum) of C-chondrite material; apparently the Moon received only 2.6% of the Earth's endowment of such material per unit mass. Chalcogens (Se and Te) have virtually constant and identical abundances in lunar and terrestrial basalts, probably reflecting saturation with Fe(S, Se, Te) in the source regions. Siderophiles show diverse trends. Ni is relatively abundant in lunar basalts (4 × 10 <SUP>-3</SUP> × Cl-chondrites), whereas Ir, Re, Ge, Au are depleted to 10 <SUP>-4</SUP>-10 <SUP>-5</SUP>× Cl. Except for Ir, these elements are consistently enriched in terrestrial basalts: Ni 3 × , Re 370 ×, Ge 330 × , Au 9 × . This difference apparently reflects the presence of nickel-iron phase in the lunar mantle, which sequesters these metals. On Earth, where such metal is absent, these elements partition into the crust to a greater degree. Though no lunar mantle rock is known, an analogue is provided by the siderophile-rich dunite 72417 (~0.1% metal) and the complementary, siderophile-poor troctolite 76535. The implied metal-siderophile distribution coefficients range from 10 <SUP>4</SUP> to 10 <SUP>6</SUP>, and are consistent with available laboratory data. The evidence does not support the alternative explanation advanced by Ringwood—that Re was volatilized during the Moon's formation, and is an incompatible element (like La or W <SUP>4+</SUP>) in igneous processes. Re is much more depleted than elements of far greater volatility: (Re/U) <SUB>Cl</SUB>̃- 4 × 10 <SUP>-6</SUP> vs ( T1/ U) <SUB>Cl</SUB> = 1.3 × 10 <SUP>-4</SUP>, and Re does not correlate with La or other incompatibles. Heavy alkalis (K, Rb, Cs) show increasing depletion with atomic number. Cs/Rb ratios in lunar basalts, eucrites, and shergottites are 0.44, 0.36, and 0.65 × Cl, whereas the value for the bulk Earth is 0.15-0.26. These ratios fall within the range observed in LL and E6 chondrites. supporting the suggestion that the alkali depletion in planets, as in chondrites, was caused by localized remelting of nebular dust (= chondrule formation). Indeed, the small fractionation of K, Rb and Cs, despite their great differences in volatility, suggests that the planets, like the chondrites, formed from a mixture of depleted and undepleted material, not from a single, partially devolatilized material.

The Rb-Sr age of 4.55 plus or minus 0.10 AE for the dunite (72417) and that of the troctolite are in approximate agreement and permit an interpretation that these rocks formed during a single major lunar differentiation which presumbly produced an anorthositic-gabbroic lunar crust and layered upper mantle.

R.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||821|Lunar sample 76535 appears to be one of the most slowly cooled bits of silicate material yet studied. It provides, therefore, a unique opportunity for the study of ordering processes in the minerals present. A better understanding of these processes may permit better characterization of the thermal history of this and similar rocks. The cation ordering in the olivine is consistent with terrestrial olivines favoring the interpretation that ordering in olivines increases with increasing temperature. In low bronzite, the deviations from the common orthopyroxene space group appear to be caused by cation order on the basis of four M sites instead of two. The degree of cation order in each of these minerals is consistent with the rock having been excavated from its depth of formation by tectonic or impact processes without being reheated above 300 C.

This rock is believed to have formed as a result of very slow cooling at a depth of 10 - 40 km, and hence furnishes direct evidence that the moon was chemically zoned before 4.26 G.y. The age of the rock is associated with the Serenitatis Basin forming event. The age of formation of the Serenitatis Basin is then deduced at 4.26 ± 0.02 G.y. ago, about 300 million years before the Imbrium event. It appears that the major basin forming era on the near side of the moon lasted longer than 300 million years. The grouping of many lunar rock ages at 3.9 - 4.0 G.y. is most likely due to the fact that the Imbrium ejecta predominates all highland landing sites.

Rb-Sr data do not define an isochron. Rb/Sr and <SUP>87</SUP>Sr/ <SUP>86</SUP>Sr ratios of the plagioclase and the whole rock are identical, whereas data for various "olivine" separates show considerable scatter, presumably because of disturbance of the isotopic system.

However, the rock apparently contains <SUP>40</SUP>Ar which is not the product of in-situ decay of <SUP>40</SUP>K and <SUP>36</SUP>Ar, <SUP>38</SUP>Ar, and Ne which are not the result of cosmic-ray interactions during the 195-m.y. cosmic-ray exposure history.

A K sbnd Ar gas retention age for the plagioclase of 4.34 ± 0.08 × 10 <SUP>9</SUP>yr is derived. This K sbnd Ar age can be used to calculate an initial <SUP>87</SUP>Sr/ <SUP>86</SUP>Sr ratio of 0.69913 ± 0.00005 from whole-rock and plagioclase analyses. The trapped Ne and Ar in 76535 cannot be uniquely characterized as either "planetary derived" or solar wind derived, but appear to have characteristics of both. The data suggest that 76535 formed 4.3-4.6 AE ago, and the accumulation process and/or subsequent annealing may have incorporated excess noble gases. Separation of radiogenic parents and daughters with incomplete isotopic equilibration may also have occurred during cooling or during a subsequent "event".

The amount of trapped parent liquid in the rock is estimated to be in the range of 8-16%.

R.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|38|9|1329,IN1,1331|Lunar sample 76535 is a coarse-grained troctolitic granulite exhibiting a texture indicative of long annealing times. It is composed of homogeneous crystals of plagioclase (58 per cent, An <SUB>96</SUB>), olivine (37 per cent, Fo <SUB>88</SUB>) and bronzite (4 per cent, En <SUB>86</SUB>). Chromian spinel-bronzite-diopside (Wo <SUB>46</SUB>En <SUB>50</SUB>Fs <SUB>4</SUB>) symplectic intergrowths commonly occur along olivine-plagioclase boundaries and as tiny inclusions within olivine grains. These symplectites apparently formed by a reaction of the type: OI + An + Chromite → Opx + Cpx + Al-Mg-chromite. The reaction is related to the experimentally determined reaction OI + An = Opx + Cpx + Sp of Kushiro and Yoder (1966). The enstatite content of the diopside coexisting with the bronzite indicates equilibration at about 1000°C. Thermodynamic calculations for 1000°C indicate that the symplectites formed at a minimum pressure of about 0.6 kb. Low alumina contents of the pyroxenes indicate equilibration near this minimum pressure. Clusters of the same assemblage found in the symplectic intergrowths, but containing accessory metal, troilite, Ca-phosphates, baddeleyite, plagioclase and/or K-feldspar occur sporadically throughout the rock. These apparent late stage products crystallized in the low temperature-high pressure region discussed above. Phase relations of co-existing metal phases indicate that the rock cooled at a few tens of degrees/my, corresponding to depths of 10-20 km below the lunar surface, in agreement with the above pressure estimate. We infer that 76535 represents an original cumulate deposited at a depth between about 10 and 30 km. The last liquid crystallized in the relatively high pressure-low temperature field opx + cpx + Al- Mg- chromite. Cooling was extremely slow and accompanied by extensive chemical and textural re-equilibration. Reaction to form the symplectites occurred during the late stages of re-equilibration.
