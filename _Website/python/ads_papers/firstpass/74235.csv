The study of the cosmic-ray-produced isotopes He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe in the basaltic rocks 74235, 74255, and 74275, in bulk soil samples from the orange soil 74220, from the gray soils 74241 and 74261, and from the black soil 74001, and in grain size separates from the black soil allows the determination of the cosmic-ray exposure history of these samples. All three rocks experienced at least a two-stage exposure as can be judged from the comparison of their irradiation geometry at the time of collection with that inferred from depth-dependent relative abundances of cosmic-ray-produced nuclei. The exposure histories of the rocks and soils are characterized by four events or periods. These results show that the Shorty impact occurred no more than 30 m.y. ago. The most probable age of this crater is 19 m.y., when the large boulder was excavated from the subfloor. The trapped solar-wind concentration in the black soil is extremely low, on the average only 0.3% of that usually found for lunar soil.
