A.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|73|19|5884|We used ICP-MS to measure the elemental concentrations and isotopic abundances of Cu and Zn in: nine Ti-rich lunar basalts (10017, 10022, 10024, 10057, 70215, 71055, 74255, 75055, and 75075); size-separated samples prepared by sieving of pyroclastic black glass 74001, orange glass 74022, and the lunar soils 15021, 15231, 70181, and 79221; a basalt from the Piton des Neiges volcano, Reunion Island; two samples of Pele's hairs from the Nyiragongo volcano, Democratic Republic of Congo, and the martian meteorite Zagami. The isotopic fractionation of zinc in lunar basalts and Zagami is mass dependent relative to a terrestrial standard (JMC 400882B). These and published results imply that lunar, terrestrial, meteoritic, and perhaps martian zinc all come from one or more reservoirs linked by mass-dependent fractionation processes. Relative to terrestrial basalts, Ti-rich lunar basalts are enriched in the heavier isotopes of Cu and Zn: we find for Ti-rich lunar basalts the following ranges and averages ±1 - σ (‰): δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu/ <SUP>63</SUP>Cu ≡ δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu, 0.1-1.4, 0.5 ± 0.1‰ ( N = 7); δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn/ <SUP>64</SUP>Zn ≡ δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn = 0.2-1.9, 1.2 ± 0.2‰ ( N = 8; 10017 excluded). For two terrestrial samples, we find δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn ̃ +0.3‰ and δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu ̃ 0‰, which are consistent with published values. The differences between the lunar basalts and terrestrial basalts could reflect minor, planetary-scale vaporization or igneous processes on the Moon. Data for size separates of the pyroclastic glasses 74001 and 74220 confirm the well-known surface correlation of Cu and Zn, but modeling calculations reveal no sharp differences between either the elemental ratios or the isotopic composition of grain interiors and exteriors. The absence of such differences indicates that the isotopic compositions for bulk samples are dominated by a light-isotope-rich surface component. Data for size separates of lunar soils also confirm the surface correlation of Cu and Zn, but an enrichment of heavy rather than light isotopes. Averages for bulk lunar soils from this work and the literature are (‰): δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu, from 1.4 to 4.1, average 3.0 ± 0.3 ( N = 9); δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn, from 2.2 to 6.4, average 4.0 ± 0.3 ( N = 14). As with the glasses, in all but soil 15231 our data show no strong differences between the isotopic composition of soil sub-samples with small and large grains. The size of the isotopic fractionation inferred for the surface component in the soils is 3× smaller than predicted by a published model of sputtering primarily by solar particles. At the same time, the observed fractionation is larger than predicted by calculations based on a model of micrometeorite impact heating and hydrodynamic quenching. Because impact heating appears unable to explain the observations, we conclude that sputtering must be important even though samples with very large isotopic fractionation of Cu and Zn have not yet been found.

S., Marshall, J.|Studies of Mineralogical and Textural Properties of Martian Soil: An Exobiological Perspective|||48|The upcoming Mars 01 mission will carry an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) as part of the Mars Environmental Compatibility Assessment (MECA) instrument. By operating in a tapping mode, the AFM is capable of sub-nanometer resolution in three dimensions and can distinguish between substances of different compositions by employing phase contrast imaging. To prepare for the Mars 01 mission, we are testing the AFM on a lunar soil to determine its ability to define particle shapes and sizes and grain-surface textures. The test materials are from the Apollo 17 soil 79221, which is a mixture of agglutinates, impact and volcanic beads, and mare and highland rock and mineral fragments. The majority of the lunar soil particles are less than 100 microns in size, comparable to the sizes estimated for martian dust. We have used the AFM to examine several different soil particles at various resolutions. The instrument has demonstrated the ability to identify parallel ridges characteristic of twinning on a 150 micron plagioclase feldspar particle. Extremely small (10-100 nanometer) adhering particles are visible on the surface of the feldspar grain, and they appear elongate with smooth surfaces. Phase contrast imaging of the nanometer particles shows several compositions to be present. When the AFM was applied to a 100 micron glass spherule, it was possible to define an extremely smooth surface; this is in clear contrast to results from a basalt fragment which exhibited a rough surface texture. Also visible on the surface of the glass spherule were chains of 100 nanometer and smaller impact melt droplets. For the '01 Mars mission, the AFM is intended to define the size and shape distributions of soil particles, in combination with the NMCA optical microscope system and images from the Robot Arm Camera (RAC). These three data sets will provide a means of assessing potentially hazardous soil and dust properties. The study that we have conducted on the lunar soils now suggests that the NMCA experiment will be able to define grain transport and weathering processes. For example, it should be possible to determine if Martian grains have been subjected to aeolian or water transport, volcanic activity, impact melting processes, in-situ weathering, and a host of other processes. Additionally, textural maturity could be assessed (via freshness and form of fracture patterns and grain shapes). Thus, the AFM has the potential to shed new light on Martian surface processes by adding the submicroscopic dimension to planetary investigations.

V.|New Views of the Moon 2: Understanding the Moon Through the Integration of Diverse Datasets|||32|The effects of space weathering on the optical properties of lunar materials have been well documented. These effects include a reddened continuum slope, lowered albedo, and attenuated absorption features in reflectance spectra of lunar soils as compared to finely comminuted rocks from the same Apollo sites. However, the regolith processes that cause these effects are not well known, nor is the petrographic setting of the products of these processes fully understood. A Lunar Soil Characterization Consortium has been formed with the purpose of systematically integrating chemical and mineralogical data with the optical properties of lunar soils. Understanding space-weathering effects is critical in order to fully integrate the lunar sample collection with remotely-sensed data from recent robotic missions (e.g., Lunar Prospector, Clementine, and Galileo) We have shown that depositional processes (condensation of impact-derived vapors, sputter deposits, accreted impact material, e.g., splash glass, spherules, etc.) are a major factor in the modification of the optical surfaces of lunar regolith materials. In mature soils, it is the size and distribution of the nanophase metal in the soil grains that has the major effect on optical properties. In this report, we compare and contrast the space-weathering effects in an immature and a mature soil with similar elemental compositions. For this study, we analyzed <10 micron sieve fractions of two Apollo 17 soils, 79221 (mature, Is/FeO = 81) and 71061 (immature, Is/FeO = 14). Details of the sieving procedures and allocation scheme are given else where. The results of other detailed chemical, mineralogical, and spectroscopic analyses of these soil samples are reported elsewhere. A representative sample of each soil was embedded in low-viscosity epoxy, and thin sections (about 70nm thick) were obtained through ultra microtomy. The thin sections used for these analyses typically contained cross sections of up to 500 individual grains. The thin sections were studied using a JEOL 2010 transmission electron microscope (TEM) equipped with a thin window energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer. An individual thin section was selected from each soil, and for each grain in the section we determined (1) the elemental composition by EDX; (2) whether the grain was crystalline or glassy using electron diffraction and darkfield imaging; (3) the presence or absence of rims and accreted material; and (4) the distribution of nanophase Fe where present. Most of the categories are self-evident; however, we divide the agglutinate derived material into agglutinitic glass (glass with approximately the same composition as the bulk soil that contains nanophase Fe with or without vesicles) and agglutinate fragments, which are composed of crystalline grains and agglutinitic glass. Lithic fragments are defined as polymineralic grains with no glass. Pyroxene grains have been divided into high- and low-Ca groups. As expected, there are a number of differences in the petrography of the <10-microns fractions of 79221 and 71061 given the great difference in their respective maturities, but we focus here on two major distinctions: agglutinate content and the number of grains with micropatina. Slightly over 50% of the particles in 79221 consist of agglutinitic glass and agglutinate fragments, while the remainder are predominantly crystalline mineral grains. The agglutinic glass particles contain abundant nanophase Fe and vesicles. Angular particles are rare, with most showing smooth, rounded exteriors, Of the mineral grains analyzed thus far, over 90% of the grains have amorphous rims that contain nanophase Fe (these rims are believed to have formed by vapor deposition and irradiation effects). The nanophase Fe in these rims probably accounts for a significant fraction of the increase in Is/FeO measured in these size fractions. In addition to the rims, the majority of particles also show abundant accreted material in the form of glass splashes and spherules that also contain nanophase Fe. In stark contrast, the surfaces of the mineral grains in the 71061 sample are relatively prisitine, as only about 14% of the mineral grains in the sample exhibited amorphous rims. Furthermore, the mineral particles are more angular and show greater surface roughness than in the mature sample. Accreted material on particle surfaces is rare. Agglutinitic material is a major component of the 71061 sample; however, nanophase Fe and vesicles are not as well developed as in the 79221 sample. It is now recognized that nanophase Fe is probably the main agent in modifying the optical properties of lunar soil grains. The most important result of this study is the observation that in the fine size fractions of mature soils, nearly every grain has nanophase Fe within 100 run of the particle surface.
