2008GeCoA..72.3022P|2008|Osmium isotope and highly siderophile element systematics of lunar impact melt breccias: Implications for the late accretion history of the Moon and Earth|Puchtel, Igor S., Walker, Richard J., James, Odette B., Kring, David A.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|72|12|3022|To characterize the compositions of materials accreted to the Earth-Moon system between about 4.5 and 3.8 Ga, we have determined Os isotopic compositions and some highly siderophile element (HSE: Re, Os, Ir, Ru, Pt, and Pd) abundances in 48 subsamples of six lunar breccias. These are: Apollo 17 poikilitic melt breccias 72395 and 76215; Apollo 17 aphanitic melt breccias 73215 and 73255; Apollo 14 polymict breccia 14321; and lunar meteorite NWA482, a crystallized impact melt. Plots of Ir versus other HSE define excellent linear correlations, indicating that all data sets likely represent dominantly two-component mixtures of a low-HSE target, presumably endogenous component, and a high-HSE, presumably exogenous component. Linear regressions of these trends yield intercepts that are statistically indistinguishable from zero for all HSE, except for Ru and Pd in two samples. The slopes of the linear regressions are insensitive to target rock contributions of Ru and Pd of the magnitude observed; thus, the trendline slopes approximate the elemental ratios present in the impactor components contributed to these rocks. The <SUP>187</SUP>Os/<SUP>188</SUP>Os and regression-derived elemental ratios for the Apollo 17 aphanitic melt breccias and the lunar meteorite indicate that the impactor components in these samples have close affinities to chondritic meteorites. The HSE in the Apollo 17 aphanitic melt breccias, however, might partially or entirely reflect the HSE characteristics of HSE-rich granulitic breccia clasts that were incorporated in the impact melt at the time of its creation. In this case, the HSE characteristics of these rocks may reflect those of an impactor that predated the impact event that led to the creation of the melt breccias. The impactor components in the Apollo 17 poikilitic melt breccias and in the Apollo 14 breccia have higher <SUP>187</SUP>Os/<SUP>188</SUP>Os, Pt/Ir, and Ru/Ir and lower Os/Ir than most chondrites. These compositions suggest that the impactors they represent were chemically distinct from known chondrite types, and possibly represent a type of primitive material not currently delivered to Earth as meteorites.

The data indicate that some of the lunar rocks diverge from the known chondrite groups.

B.|37th Annual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference|37||1428|New 187Os/188Os and HSE data for lunar impact melt rocks indicate that 73215 and 73255 aphanites plot in the middle of the chondrite range, whereas 72395 poikilitic rocks and 14321 microbreccias plot beyond the highest end of the range for ordinary and enstatite chondrites.
2001M&PS...36.1257M|2001|Siderophile elements in Earth's upper mantle and lunar breccias: Data synthesis suggests manifestations of the same late influx|Morgan, J. W., Walker, R. J., Brandon, A. D., Horan, M. F.|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|36|9|1257|The platinum group elements (PGE; Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, Pt), Re and Au comprise the highly siderophile elements (HSE). We re-examine selected isotopic and abundance data sets for HSE in upper mantle peridotites to resolve a longstanding dichotomy. Re-Os and Pt-Os isotope systematics, and approximately chondritic proportions of PGE in these rocks suggest the presence in undepleted mantle of a chondrite-like component, which is parsimoniously explained by late influx of large planetisimals after formation of the Earth's core and the Moon. But some suites of xenolithic and orogenic spinel lherzolites, and abyssal peridotites, have a CI-normalized PGE pattern with enhanced Pd that is sometimes termed "non-chondritic". We find that this observation is consistent with other evidence of a late influx of material more closely resembling enstatite, rather than ordinary or carbonaceous, chondrites. Regional variations in HSE patterns may be a consequence of a late influx of very large objects of variable composition. Studies of many ancient (>3.8 Ga) lunar breccias show regional variations in Au/Ir and suggest that "graininess" existed during the early bombardment of the Earth and Moon. Reliable Pd values are available only for Apollo 17 breccias 73215 and 73255, however. Differences in HSE patterns between the aphanitic and anorthositic lithologies in these breccias show fractionation between a refractory group (Re, Os and Ir) and a normal (Pd, Ni, and Au) group and may reflect the compositions of the impacting bodies. Similar fractionation is apparent between the EH and EL chondrites, whose PGE patterns resemble those of the aphanitic and anorthositic lithologies, respectively. The striking resemblance of HSE and chalcogen (S, Se) patterns in the Apollo aphanites and high Pd terrestrial peridotites suggest that the "non-chondritic" abundance ratios in the latter may be reflected in the composition of planetisimals striking the Moon in the first 700 Ma of Earth-Moon history. Most notably, high Pd may be part of a general enhancement of HSE more volatile than Fe suggesting that the Au abundance in at least parts of the upper mantle may be 1.5 to 2 times higher than previously estimated. The early lunar influx may be estimated from observed basin-sized craters. Comparison of relative influx to Earth and Moon suggests that the enrichment of HSE is limited to the upper mantle above 670 km. To infer enrichment of the whole mantle would require several large lunar impacts not yet identified.
1993GeCoA..57..915S|1993|Ages of pristine noritic clasts from lunar breccias 15445 and 15455|Shih, C. -Y., Nyquist, L. E., Dasch, E. J., Bogard, D. D., Bansal, B. M., Wiesmann, H.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|57|4|915|Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isotopic studies were undertaken of two Apollo 15 breccias, 15445 and 15455, collected near Spur Crater on the Apennine Front. Seven pristine lithic clasts including four norites, one anorthositic norite, one troctolitic anorthosite and one spinel troctolite, as well as a matrix sample of 15445, were analysed. In addition, a K-Ar age determination was also made for a plagioclase separate from a different anorthositic norite clast. Sm-Nd isotopic data of a pristine Mg-norite sample, 15445,17, from the large white Clast B of breccia 15445 yielded a precise internal isochron age of 4.46 ± 0.07 Ga for λ( <SUP>147</SUP>Sm) = 0.00654 Ga<SUP>-1</SUP> and an initial <SUP>143</SUP>Nd /<SUP>144</SUP>Nd of 0.506058 ∓ 0.000078 (normalized to <SUP>148</SUP>Nd /<SUP>144</SUP>Nd = 0.24308) corresponding to an initial ∊<SUB>Nd</SUB> of +0.71. However, Sm-Nd isotopic results of another Mg-norite sample, 15445,247, chipped from the same Clast B, about 1 cm away from 15445,17, yielded a significantly younger isochron age of 4.28 ± 0.03 Ga and a higher initial <SUP>143</SUP>Nd /<SUP>144</SUP>Nd of 0.506246 ∓ 0.000037 corresponding to an initial ∊<SUB>Nd</SUB> of -0.35. The Sm-Nd data indicate that Clast B is heterogeneous and contains at least two similar lithologies. The Rb-Sr isotopic systems were severely disturbed for both norites. No useful isochron ages were observed. The Sm-Nd age and ∊<SUB>Nd</SUB> data for A-15 Mg-norites 15445,17 and 15445,247, A-17 Mgnorite 78236, and two Mg-gabbronorites 73255,27,45 and 67667 are clearly resolved from each other. Four distinct parental magmas are required for derivation of these two major groups of Mg-suite noritic rocks. The Rb-Sr isotopic system of an anorthositic norite clast, 15455,228, was slightly disturbed; and isotopic data defined an isochron age of 4.59 ± 0.13 Ga for λ( <SUP>87</SUP>Rb) = 0.0139 Ga<SUP>-1</SUP> or 4.55 ± 0.13 Ga for λ( <SUP>87</SUP>Rb) = 0.01402 Ga<SUP>-1</SUP>. The corresponding initial <SUP>87</SUP>Sr /<SUP>86</SUP>Sr for the rock is 0.69899 ∓ 0.00006 and is in satisfactory agreement with the LUNI value of NYQUIST et al. (1974). The Sm-Nd system is more disturbed than the Rb-Sr system for this rock. A tie-line between whole-rock samples and a pyroxene separate gives a Sm-Nd age of 4.53 ± 0.29 Ga, which is in nominal agreement with the Rb-Sr isochron age. The <SUP>39</SUP>Ar <SUP>40</SUP>Ar age of a plagioclase separate of the rock has a weighted average value of ~ 3.83 Ga, suggesting that the age was reset by the Imbrium impact event. Probably, the Sm-Nd and Rb-Sr systems of the clast were also partly reset by this event. Our age results indicate that some Mg-suite rocks are as old as ferroan-anorthosite-suite rocks. Furthermore, age data of three major crustal rocks (a Mg suite, a ferroan-anorthosite suite, and an evolved suite) show that they all have variable ages. These observations are difficult to explain by the "magma ocean" hypothesis alone. Petrogenetic processes such as production of Mg-suite rocks by "serial magmatism" ( WALKER, 1983), of ferroan-anorthosite-suite rocks by "multiple diapiric intrusions" ( LONGHI and ASHWAL, 1985), and evolved-suite rocks by "continuous magmatism" ( MEYER et al., 1988, 1989) probably all played a role. These processes seem to be able to accommodate the wide ranges of ages and different origins observed for lunar crustal rocks.
1981E&PSL..52..227C|1981|Time and duration of lunar highlands crust formation|Carlson, R. W., Lugmair, G. W.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|52|2|227|All radiometric systems indicate that crust-mantle differentiation on the moon is dominated by events which occurred very early in lunar history. However, due to remaining uncertainties in model parameters and assumptions in the calculation of model ages, it is not yet possible to resolve the precise times of occurrence of these events nor the duration of the formation of the highlands crust. The strongest time constraints are offered by direct radiometric ages of samples formed during this earliest period. Two possible candidates for this material, norites 78236 and 73255,27,45, were examined utilizing the Sm-Nd radiometric system. Sm-Nd systematics of 78236 show post-crystallization disturbance but indicate that this norite crystallized in the lunar crust about 4.34 AE ago. Data for 73255,27,45 define an isochron and yield a crystallization age of 4.23 ± 0.05 AE. The initial Nd isotopic composition of both norites is within uncertainty of a "chondritic" reference reservoir at the time of their respective crystallizations. The implications for lunar crustal formation persisting over a time span of close to 350 m.y. are discussed.

J.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||67|Breccia 73255 contains sparse small clasts of basalts that have mare affinities; the basalts are members of a single differentiated suite. The clasts have been fractured throughout and locally granulated. Textural and compositional evidence indicates that the fracturing and granulation were produced by the 73255 breccia-forming event, and this event took place before the basalts had completely solidified. Thus, it appears that the eruption of the basalts took place at about the same time as the formation of the 73255 breccia, about 3.9 b.y. ago. The mineral assemblages and modes of the basalt clasts are those typical of mare basalts, but the clasts are not identical in detail with any basalts returned from the mare surfaces. They are instead most similar to the 14053-type basalts from the Apollo 14 site.

J.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||713|A study of two clasts of coarse-grained anorthositic-noritic-troctolitic-suite norites from the fragment-laden melt rock 73255 is presented. Both clasts are igneous rocks crystallized from melts that were probably internally generated; clast 27,80 is a cumulate, and the parent magmas of both rocks probably crystallized below the lunar surface. Despite similar history, the parent rocks of the two clasts appear to be derived from distinct magma types: the 27,80 is characterized by plagioclase and orthopyroxene as the major constituents and by a high K, Nb, and Zr content, while the 27,45 type also contains augite and has a low content of K, Nb, and Zr.

R.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||803|The paper examines analyses of clasts from consortium breccia 73255. It was shown that the basalts are high-alumina, and contain low, unfractionated abundances; the felsite is similar in major element composition and relative REE abundances to the felsites from 73215 and 12013; and the ANT materials are similar to the ANT clasts in other Apollo 17 breccias. Model calculations show that the pyroxene anorhosite has equilibrated with a very evolved liquid, and it is indicated that there was once a liquid with an evolved REE composition which was the parent of the pyroxene anorthosite.

Thirteen samples from this exceptional breccia have now been dated. The methodological implications of the various types of age spectra are discussed in some detail. The results of this study and of previous studies of breccia 73215 indicate that the date of the South Serenitatis basin-forming event was 3.87 + or - 0.03 AE. This age is confirmed by recent dating of a felsite clast of 73255 with a plateau age of 3.89 + or - 0.03 AE. Some lithic clasts incorporated in the breccia are as old as 4.20 AE. The (Ar-38)C exposure age of 73255 is 91 + or - 3 my.

K.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||789|Fifteen siderophile and volatile trace elements (Os, Re, Ir, Pd, Ni, Au, Sb, Ge, Se, Ag, In, Zn, Cd, Bi, Tl) and U were determined by radiochemical neutron activation analysis in a spheroidal aphanitic clast and a clast of coarse-grained anorthositic gabbro from breccia 73215 and in three types of aphanite and two clasts of fine-grained anorthositic gabbro from breccia 73255. In common with most Apollo 17 fragment-laden melt rocks, the aphanites from 73215 and 73255 predominantly contain a Group 2 meteoritic component, which is apparently derived from the Serenitatis impact. All aphanitic lithologies contain the same meteoritic component, and are probably cogenetic. The clasts of fine-grained anorthositic gabbro contain substantial amounts (2% to 6% Cl equivalent based on Au) of a pre-Serenitatis Group 3 component. The clast of coarse-grained anorthositic gabbro is low in siderophile elements (0.4% Cl equivalent), and the meteoritic component (Group 5) is not well-defined. A strong correlation exists between Ir and Au in both the aphanites and the anorthositic gabbro clasts, which argues against the breccias 73215 and 73255 being open systems for Au

The estimate for the time of the breccia-forming event from thermal release studies is compared to the upper limit of the event from the laser studies; this work also shows that ages in excess of 4.0 G.y. determined on rocks containing devitrified maskelynite clasts probably have no chronological significance.

K., Staudacher, T., Dominik, B., Kirsten, T.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||841|As part of the continuing effort of the O. B. James Consortium to better understand the process of formation of lunar highland breccias, the Ar-40/Ar-39 systematics of samples of vesicular and nonvesicular aphanite from Apollo 17 light gray breccia 73255 has been studied. These aphanites formed as mechanical mixtures of impact melt and crystalline clasts probably during the South Serenitatis basin-forming impact. Results indicate that the date of this event was 3.88 plus or minus .03 AE. In the nonvesicular aphanite samples, the K-Ar system of the clast material was only partly reset when the breccia formed, but the clasts in the vesicular aphanite samples were totally outgassed at that time. The apparent age spectra and gas release patterns show two regimes, which we relate to outgassing of the melt-derived groundmass and the clastic material, respectively.
