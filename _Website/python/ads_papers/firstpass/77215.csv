2017E&PSL.475...15K|2017|Tungsten isotopes and the origin of the Moon|Kruijer, Thomas S., Kleine, Thorsten|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|475||15|The giant impact model of lunar origin predicts that the Moon mainly consists of impactor material. As a result, the Moon is expected to be isotopically distinct from the Earth, but it is not. To account for this unexpected isotopic similarity of the Earth and Moon, several solutions have been proposed, including (i) post-giant impact Earth-Moon equilibration, (ii) alternative models that make the Moon predominantly out of proto-Earth mantle, and (iii) formation of the Earth and Moon from an isotopically homogeneous disk reservoir. Here we use W isotope systematics of lunar samples to distinguish between these scenarios. We report high-precision <SUP>182</SUP>W data for several low-Ti and high-Ti mare basalts, as well as for Mg-suite sample 77215, and lunar meteorite Kalahari 009, which complement data previously obtained for KREEP-rich samples. In addition, we utilize high-precision Hf isotope and Ta/W ratio measurements to empirically quantify the superimposed effects of secondary neutron capture on measured <SUP>182</SUP>W compositions. Our results demonstrate that there are no resolvable radiogenic <SUP>182</SUP>W variations within the Moon, implying that the Moon differentiated later than 70 Ma after Solar System formation. In addition, we find that samples derived from different lunar sources have indistinguishable <SUP>182</SUP>W excesses, confirming that the Moon is characterized by a small, uniform ∼+26 parts-per-million excess in <SUP>182</SUP>W over the present-day bulk silicate Earth. This <SUP>182</SUP>W excess is most likely caused by disproportional late accretion to the Earth and Moon, and after considering this effect, the pre-late veneer bulk silicate Earth and the Moon have indistinguishable <SUP>182</SUP>W compositions. Mixing calculations demonstrate that this Earth-Moon <SUP>182</SUP>W similarity is an unlikely outcome of the giant impact, which regardless of the amount of impactor material incorporated into the Moon should have generated a significant <SUP>182</SUP>W excess in the Moon. Consequently, our results imply that post-giant impact processes might have modified <SUP>182</SUP>W, leading to the similar <SUP>182</SUP>W compositions of the pre-late veneer Earth's mantle and the Moon.
2014E&PSL.390..244B|2014|The origin of water in the primitive Moon as revealed by the lunar highlands samples|Barnes, Jessica J., Tartèse, Romain, Anand, Mahesh, McCubbin, Francis M., Franchi, Ian A., Starkey, Natalie A., Russell, Sara S.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|390||244|The recent discoveries of hydrogen (H) bearing species on the lunar surface and in samples derived from the lunar interior have necessitated a paradigm shift in our understanding of the water inventory of the Moon, which was previously considered to be a ‘bone-dry’ planetary body. Most sample-based studies have focused on assessing the water contents of the younger mare basalts and pyroclastic glasses, which are partial-melting products of the lunar mantle. In contrast, little attention has been paid to the inventory and source(s) of water in the lunar highlands rocks which are some of the oldest and most pristine materials available for laboratory investigations, and that have the potential to reveal the original history of water in the Earth-Moon system. Here, we report in-situ measurements of hydroxyl (OH) content and H isotopic composition of the mineral apatite from four lunar highlands samples (two norites, a troctolite, and a granite clast) collected during the Apollo missions. Apart from troctolite in which the measured OH contents in apatite are close to our analytical detection limit and its H isotopic composition appears to be severely compromised by secondary processes, we have measured up to ̃2200 ppm OH in the granite clast with a weighted average δD of ̃ -105±130‰, and up to ̃3400 ppm OH in the two norites (77215 and 78235) with weighted average δD values of -281±49‰ and -27±98‰, respectively. The apatites in the granite clast and the norites are characterised by higher OH contents than have been reported so far for highlands samples, and have H isotopic compositions similar to those of terrestrial materials and some carbonaceous chondrites, providing one of the strongest pieces of evidence yet for a common origin for water in the Earth-Moon system. In addition, the presence of water, of terrestrial affinity, in some samples of the earliest-formed lunar crust suggests that either primordial terrestrial water survived the aftermath of the putative impact-origin of the Moon or water was added to the Earth-Moon system by a common source immediately after the accretion of the Moon.

2010E&PSL.289..595D|2010|Osmium isotope and highly siderophile element systematics of the lunar crust|Day, James M. D., Walker, Richard J., James, Odette B., Puchtel, Igor S.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|289|3-4|595|Coupled <SUP>187</SUP>Os/ <SUP>188</SUP>Os and highly siderophile element (HSE: Os, Ir, Ru, Pt, Pd, and Re) abundance data are reported for pristine lunar crustal rocks 60025, 62255, 65315 (ferroan anorthosites, FAN) and 76535, 78235, 77215 and a norite clast in 15455 (magnesian-suite rocks, MGS). Osmium isotopes permit more refined discrimination than previously possible of samples that have been contaminated by meteoritic additions and the new results show that some rocks, previously identified as pristine, contain meteorite-derived HSE. Low HSE abundances in FAN and MGS rocks are consistent with derivation from a strongly HSE-depleted lunar mantle. At the time of formation, the lunar floatation crust, represented by FAN, had 1.4 ± 0.3 pg g <SUP>- 1 </SUP> Os, 1.5 ± 0.6 pg g <SUP>- 1 </SUP> Ir, 6.8 ± 2.7 pg g <SUP>- 1 </SUP> Ru, 16 ± 15 pg g <SUP>- 1 </SUP> Pt, 33 ± 30 pg g <SUP>- 1 </SUP> Pd and 0.29 ± 0.10 pg g <SUP>- 1 </SUP> Re (̃ 0.00002 × CI) and Re/Os ratios that were modestly elevated ( <SUP>187</SUP>Re/ <SUP>188</SUP>Os = 0.6 to 1.7) relative to CI chondrites. MGS samples are, on average, characterised by more elevated HSE abundances (̃ 0.00007 × CI) compared with FAN. This either reflects contrasting mantle-source HSE characteristics of FAN and MGS rocks, or different mantle-crust HSE fractionation behaviour during production of these lithologies. Previous studies of lunar impact-melt rocks have identified possible elevated Ru and Pd in lunar crustal target rocks. The new results provide no supporting evidence for such enrichments. If maximum estimates for HSE in the lunar mantle are compared with FAN and MGS averages, crust-mantle concentration ratios ( D-values) must be ≤ 0.3. Such D-values are broadly similar to those estimated for partitioning between the terrestrial crust and upper mantle, with the notable exception of Re. Given the presumably completely different mode of origin for the primary lunar floatation crust and tertiary terrestrial continental crust, the potential similarities in crust-mantle HSE partitioning for the Earth and Moon are somewhat surprising. Low HSE abundances in the lunar crust, coupled with estimates of HSE concentrations in the lunar mantle implies there may be a 'missing component' of late-accreted materials (as much as 95%) to the Moon if the Earth/Moon mass-flux estimates are correct and terrestrial mantle HSE abundances were established by late accretion.

Internal isochrons were determined for two early highland rocks, 77215 and 60025. No resolvable Zr isotopic variations were detected in this wide range of lunar samples and thus there is no evidence for the former existence of live <SUP>92</SUP>Nb on the Moon. The Nb/Zr ratios of lunar ilmenites and bulk rock samples vary by only a factor of two to three relative to the chondritic Nb/Zr ratio. No evidence for larger Nb/Zr fractionation was found. This limited fractionation and late isotopic closure of the source region prevents the formation of measurable <SUP>92</SUP>Zr anomalies in high-Ti mare basalts. As a consequence, it is not possible to draw conclusions from the <SUP>92</SUP>Nb- <SUP>92</SUP>Zr chronometer about the timing of early lunar differentiation and to constrain the role of ilmenite in the source region of high-Ti mare basalts. However, the fractionation is still sufficient to deduce an upper limit for the initial <SUP>92</SUP>Nb/ <SUP>93</SUP>Nb ratio of the solar system of <5 × 10 <SUP>-4</SUP>.

T.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||877|A systematic interdisciplinary study of the Apollo 17 station 7 boulder, from the foot of the North Massif at Taurus-Littrow, is described. The astronauts observed four lithologies: a large white clast represented by 77215, cut by dark dikelets (77075) and enclosed in blue-gray breccia (77115); the assemblage of these three rock types is in turn surrounded by green-gray breccia (77135). The history of the station 7 boulder, as construed from the results of the consortium study, is presented.

A regression line corresponding to an age of 4.07 plus or minus 0.09 b.y. is obtained with an Rb-87 decay constant of 1.41 x 10 to the -11th/yr and an initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio of approximately 0.69918. It is noted that the intrusion age of the dikelets provides the most reliable criterion for determining the age of the entire boulder, i.e., the boulder is not an extension of 77115, which formed more recently. Attention is given to a generalized lunar history during the first 600 m.y.

A.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|33|3|389|Major, minor and trace element compositions, age data and Rb/Sr systematics of Apollo 17 boulders have been compiled, and additional analyses performed on a norite breccia clast (77215) included in the Apollo 17, Station 7 boulder. The Apollo 17 boulders are found to be identical or nearly so in major, minor and trace element composition, suggesting that they all originated as an impact melt analogous to melt sheets found in larger terrestrial craters. The matrix dates ( <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar) and Rb/Sr systematics available suggest that this impact melt formed by a single impact about 4 b.y. ago. This impact excavated, shocked, brecciated and melted norites, norite cumulates and possibly anorthositic gabbros and dunites about 4.4 b.y. old. The impact was likely a major one, possibly the Serenitatis basin-forming event.
1976mmc..reptQ....W|1976|Petrographic and petrological study of lunar rock materials|Winzer, S. R.|Martin Marietta Corp. Report||||Samples returned from Apollo 14 (14171, 14305, 14319), Apollo 15 (15255), Apollo 16 (61175, 67455), and Apollo 17 (77215) were studied optically and selected polished sections by SEM/Microprobe. Splits and separates from 77215, 67455, 61175 and 15255 were prepared; 77215 and 67455 were analyzed for major, minor and LIL trace elements. The data indicate that 77215, a noritic breccia clast found in the Station7 boulder, is a norite cumulate similar to and probably derived from the same body as 78235. The Apollo 17 boulders are found to be part of the same melt sheet, which was formed by a major impact event, possibly Serenitatis, about 4 B. Y. ago. The Apollo 14 and 16 breccias are polymict, their clast populations indicating quite different provenance. The Apollo 14 breccias are possibly the result of multiple impacts, while the other breccias studied appear to have been formed by single impacts. ANT suite clasts included in 61175 are, for the most part, granulites resulting from subsolidus recrystallization of norites, anorthosites or gabbros. This metamorphism appears to have occurred prior to the impact event forming 61175.

It is pointed out that the formation of the matrix rocks in this boulder and in the other Apollo 17 boulders in a single impact event is consistent with the isotopic evidence, ages, major-element chemistry, large ion lithophile (LIL) trace-element abundances, and textures. It had been suggested by Winzer et al. (1974), based on calculations from crystal-liquid partition coefficients for LIL trace elements, that target rocks corresponding in trace-element composition to the matrix types could have been produced by partial fusion of rocks similar to 77215. Using the same type of calculation, liquids quite similar in trace-element composition to the Station 7 boulder matrix types can be produced.

S., Ross, M., Hickling, N.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||529|Lunar breccia 77215 was originally an essentially bimineralic, pigeonite-anorthite cumulate. As cooling took place, pigeonite exsolved augite bodies having minimum dimensions as great as 30 microns. The reaction of host pigeonite to form orthopyroxene was delayed until very near the end of the recorded cooling history. Simplified diffusion calculations based on a limiting experimental value for Ca-(Mg,Fe) volume diffusion suggest that the augite lamellae formed in as short a period as 30,000 yr. The presence of coarse pyroxene exsolution lamellae do not necessarily indicate extensive periods of annealing which can only occur at depth within the lunar crust. It is possible that such lamellae could form at only moderate depths in an ejecta blanket.

On the basis of geologic and petrographic evidence, 77115 and 77075 are related; they formed, cooled, and consolidated before being engulfed in the vesicular 77135. The impact or igneous origin of the melts from which these rocks crystallized cannot be determined. 77215 is a shocked, strongly sheared and granulated microbreccia consisting of three major lithologies dominated by mineral clasts of orthopyroxene and calcic plagioclase. The orthopyroxene clasts contain coarse exsolved blebs of augite, suggesting a deep-seated origin. The major, minor, and trace element compositions of 77135, 77115, and 77075 are in general similar. They represent a major highland rock type, perhaps more important than anorthosites.

The age of the dark veinlet material 77015of3.98 ± 0.04AE is interpreted as representing the time of intrusion of this veinlet into the 77215 clast. The data obtained so far indicate that the vesicular basalt 77135 formed 100-200 m.y. later. However, this has to be confirmed by <SUP>39</SUP>Ar- <SUP>40</SUP>Ar investigations on separated mineral and/or grain-size fractions.

The <SUP>39</SUP>Ar- <SUP>40</SUP>Ar ages obtained are in agreement with the age relationships deduced from the stratigraphic evidence. Taking into account the shielding by the boulder itself, an average <SUP>37</SUP>Ar- <SUP>38</SUP>Ar exposure age of (27.5 ± 2.5)m.y. is obtained for the samples collected from the boulder.

These internal isochron age are interpreted as reflecting metamorphic events, probably related to impacts, which reset Rb sbnd Sr and U sbnd Pb mineral systems of older rocks. Six portions of boulder 7 were analyzed for U, Th, and Pb as whole rocks. Two chemical groups appear to be defined by the U, Th, and Pb concentration data. Chemical group A is characterized by U, Th, and Pb concentrations and <SUP>238</SUP>U/ <SUP>204</SUP>Pb values which are higher than those of group B. Group A rocks have typical <SUP>232</SUP>Th/ <SUP>238</SUP>U ratios of ̃ 3.85, whereas-group B rocks have unusually high Th/U values of ̃ 4.1.
