A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2335|The paper presents petrographic and mineralogical data for five samples from Boulder 2 (72315, 72335, 72355, 72375, and 72395) and sample 72435 from Boulder 3 at Apollo 17 Station 2. All the samples were found to consist of a few percent megaclasts set in a fine-grained matrix, which is comprised of microclasts and a poikilitic to subophitic-textured groundmass that crystallized from a melt. The samples have similar modal mineralogies, mineral compositions, and bulk-chemical compositions.
1974LPSC....5.2561H|1974|Improved determination of the long-term average Fe spectrum from ≡ 1 to ≡ 460 MeV/amu.|Hutcheon, I. D., MacDougall, D., Price, P. B.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||2561|It is shown that lunar rock 72315, because of its brief surface exposure age and a geometry which minimizes corrosion, makes it possible to obtain a virtually uneroded Fe spectrum, averaged over several hundred thousand years. The absolute exposure age of the rock is determined by taking into account the intensity of solar flares and galactic cosmic rays. The galactic cosmic ray production spectrum reported by Walker and Yuhas (1973) is used in the determination of the exposure age.
