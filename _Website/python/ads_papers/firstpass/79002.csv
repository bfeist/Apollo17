1997LPI....28..477G|1997|A New Set of Measurements of 26Al in Lunar Core 79002/1|Grismore, R., Llewellyn, R. A., Amoranto, A. G., Brown, M. D.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference|28||477|The authors were loaned four samples of lunar core 79002/1 for the purpose of measuring Al-26 in the core samples in order to study surface anomalies such as the effects of gardening and/or possible accretion of particles from the solar wind or other sources. The anomalies were to be detected and assessed by comparing the measured values of Al-26 concentration with cosmic-ray production predictions from the Reedy-Arnold (1972) model. The samples from 79002/1 were measured for Al-26 using a multidimensional gamma-ray spectrometer built by one of the authors. The results of the Al-26 measurements are shown in a table and are compared with analyses previously done on 79002/1 by Nishiizumi (1994).
1994E&PSL.126..421C|1994|Magnetic properties of howardite, eucrite and diogenite (HED) meteorites: Ancient magnetizing fields and meteorite evolution|Collinson, D. W., Morden, S. J.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|126|4|421|The remanent magnetism and other magnetic properties of four howardites (Kapoeta, Petersburg, Le Teilleul and EET 87503), two eucrites (Sioux County and PCA 82502) and three diogenites (Shalka, Johnstown and EET 79002) have been investigated. The dominant carrier of magnetic properties is low-nickel kamacite, present to the extent of 3-5% by weight in Petersburg and 0.1-1% in the others. A wide range of remanent magnetization (NRM) intensities, characteristics and behaviour during alternating field and thermal demagnetization is observed. Two common features are scattered directions of NRM between meteorite subsamples and anomalous behaviour of NRM direction and intensity during demagnetization. All the meteorites show evidence of a primary NRM acquired during an early evolutionary and some acquired secondary NRM. The heterogeneous NRM, with which anomalous demagnetization appears to be associated, implies magnetization of constituent fragments of the meteorite prior to, and no remagnetization after final meteorite assembly. It is tentatively proposed that the primary magnetizing field was of internal origin in the parent body, and that thermoremanent magnetization occurred when the body cooled after differentiation. The coherent magnetic fabric observed in all but two of the HEDs was most probably imparted at the time of final assembly of the meteorites.
1991GeCoA..55.3167S|1991|The natural thermoluminescence of meteorites: III. lunar and basaltic meteorites|Sears, Derek W. G., Benoit, Paul H., Sears, Hazel, Batchelor, J. David, Symes, Steve|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|55|11|3167|Natural thermoluminescence (TL) data have been obtained for the lunar meteorite MacAlpine Hills 88104/5 and for 65 eucrites, howardites, diogenites, and mesosiderites in order to investigate their recent thermal and radiation histories. All these meteorites have low levels of natural TL compared to chondrites, which is primarily because they display "anomalous fading" (i.e., fading by non-classical mechanisms). However, some have especially low natural TL (<5 krad at 250Â°C in the glow curve) which cannot be attributed to anomalous fading or thermal fading over especially large terrestrial ages, and which must reflect heating within the last 10 <SUP>5</SUP>-10 <SUP>6</SUP> y. In some cases, this heating may have been associated with shock (e.g., LEW85303) or regolith processes (Kapoeta), but in most cases (Bununu, Lowicz, the diogenites ALHA77256, ALHA84001, EET79002, and maybe others) solar heating at perihelia <0.8 AU may be responsible for the low TL values. The fraction of basaltic meteorites thought to have had small perihelia (about 20%) is comparable to the fraction of chondrites with low natural TL and to the fraction of observed falls and fireballs with small perihelia. This may imply ejection from the asteroid belt via similar mechanisms. Assuming plausible values for cosmic ray dose rate, and that the natural TL of MAC88104/5 was totally drained by ejection from the moon, the parameters for TL decay determined in the present study suggest that the Moon-Earth transit times for MAC88104 and MAC88105 were 2,000 and 1,800 y, respectively, compared with 19,000 and 2,500 y for Y791197 and ALHA81005, respectively. Although they are clearly not paired, the possibility that MAC88104/5 and ALHA81005 were ejected from the moon by the same event should be considered, since diverse rock types are found in close proximity on the lunar surface. The natural TL data confirm most previous published pairings among basaltic meteorites and suggest others.

N.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|19||285|Variations in abundance and isotopic composition of nitrogen in 79002/79001 drive tube samples result from mixing of two soil components: one mature, N-rich, and isotopically light, resembling breccia material in the core, and the other immature, N-poor, and isotopically heavy. That these materials are common to soil at each stratigraphic level in the core suggests widespread distribution in the local regolith. Preservation of mixing correlations involving nitrogen isotopic compositions and cosmogenic N-15 concentrations suggests relatively recent mixing, perhaps in association with emplacement of the core stratigraphy. Characteristics of nitrogen release from the endmember materials, relationships between their nitrogen contents and maturity, and contrasts in their cosmogenic N-15 contents are consistent with models involving secular increase of the N-15/N-14 ratio of the solar wind.
