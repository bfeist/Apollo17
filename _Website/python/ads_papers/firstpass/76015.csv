2017M&PS...52..584T|2017|Impact history of the Apollo 17 landing site revealed by U-Pb SIMS ages|Thiessen, Fiona, Nemchin, Alexander A., Snape, Joshua F., Whitehouse, Martin J., Bellucci, Jeremy J.|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|52|4|584|Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) U-Pb ages of Ca-phosphates from four texturally distinct breccia samples (72255, 76055, 76015, 76215) collected at the Apollo 17 landing site were obtained in an attempt to identify whether they represent a single or several impact event(s). The determined ages, combined with inferences from petrologic relationships, may indicate two or possibly three different impact events at 3920 ± 3 Ma, 3922 ± 5 Ma, and 3930 ± 5 Ma (all errors 2σ). Searching for possible sources of the breccias by calculating the continuous ejecta radii of impact basins and large craters as well as their expected ejecta thicknesses, we conclude that Nectaris, Crisium, Serenitatis, and Imbrium are likely candidates. If the previous interpretation that the micropoikilitic breccias collected at the North Massif represent Serenitatis ejecta is correct, then the average <SUP>207</SUP>Pb/<SUP>206</SUP>Pb age of 3930 ± 5 Ma (2σ) dates the formation of the Serenitatis basin. The occurrence of zircon in the breccias sampled at the South Massif, which contain Ca-phosphates yielding an age of 3922 ± 5 Ma (2σ), may indicate that the breccia originated from within the Procellarum KREEP terrane (PKT) and the Imbrium basin appears to be the only basin that could have sourced them. However, this interpretation implies that all basins suggested to fall stratigraphically between Serenitatis and Imbrium formed within a short (<11 Ma) time interval, highlighting serious contradictions between global stratigraphic constraints, sample interpretation, and chronological data. Alternatively, the slightly older age of the two micropoikilitic breccias may be a result of incomplete resetting of the U-Pb system preserved in some phosphate grains. Based on the currently available data set this possibility cannot be excluded.
1999M&PS...34..593W|1999|Space weathering on the moon: Patina on Apollo 17 samples 75075 and 76015|Wentworth, Susan J., Keller, Lindsay P., McKay, David S., Morris, Richard V.|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|34|4|593|We studied patinas on lunar rocks 75075 and 76015 from the Apollo collection using a multidisciplinary approach, including SEM, EDS, TEM, WDS X-ray mapping, Mössbauer spectroscopy, spectral reflectance, and microspectrophotometry. Based on SEM petrography, we have defined three textural types of patina: glazed, fragmental, and classic (cratered). The presence of classic patina is diagnostic of lunar samples that have been exposed directly to the space weathering environment. It is characterized by the presence of microcraters and glass pancakes, and is the patina type studied by earlier workers. Classic patina is found on 76015 but not on 75075. Glazed patina is found on both 76015 and 75075, while fragmental patina is found only on 75075. The glazed and fragmental patinas on 75075 were probably formed as a result of relatively large nearby impacts, and although these two types of patina are not strictly the result of direct exposure to the space weathering environment, they are important because they affect the optical properties of the rocks. Field emission gun SEM (FE-SEM) of classic patina on 76015 shows evidence of possible solar wind sputtering erosion. TEM studies of 76015 reveal the presence of impact-generated deposits and solar flare particle tracks which, like microcraters and pancakes, are diagnostic of direct exposure to space weathering processes. The outermost surface of the 76015 patina consists of an amorphous rim very much like the rims found on individual lunar soil grains; this amorphous patina rim probably formed by similar processes of impact-generated vapor condensation and possible sputter deposition. Wavelength-dispersive X-ray (WDS) element maps of polished thin sections of 75075 and 76015 indicate that patina compositions are poor indicators of the compositions and mineralogies of the rocks underlying them. On average, the reflectance spectra of patinas on both samples are slightly darker than those of their unweathered equivalents. Microreflectance measurements show that a thick patina can dramatically alter the optical properties of the rock on which it forms. The backscatter MöF6ssbauer (BaMS) spectrum of a patina-covered surface of 76015 is very similar to that of an unweathered surface, indicating that the Mössbauer signal is generated from beneath the patina. Because BaMS "sees" through surface space-weathering effects to the underlying rock, this technique has great potential for use in robotic missions to other planetary bodies.

S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference|28||1541|We recently defined three basic types of patina for Apollo 17 crystalline matrix breccia 76015 and high-Ti mare basalt 75075. Accretionary microcratered pancake-bearing (AMP) patina, found on 76015 is characterized by the presence of microcraters and glass pancakes (small circular glass splashes) in all size ranges. These microcraters and pancakes are evidence of direct exposure to space, as are solar flare tracks and possible solar wind sputtering erosion. The other two types of patina we recently defined, which were found on mare basalt 75075, include accretionary coalesced (AC) patina, consisting of thin discontinuous layers of glass, and accretionary welded fragmental (AWF) patina, made up of accreted layers of rounded, well-sorted mineral and glass grains. The AC and AWF patinas on 75075 showed no evidence of microcraters, pancakes, or any direct interaction with the solar wind.

S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference|27||1423|A number of rocks in the lunar sample collection have surface patinas which formed as a result of exposure to the space weathering environment on the surface of the moon. It is important to understand patinas and their relationships to the rocks on which they formed because it is likely that patinas on surface- exposed rocks on the moon and other planetary bodies would affect data obtained by either remote sensing or unmanned landers. We have undertaken a multidisciplinary study of patinas on selected Apollo samples using a wide range of techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), backscattered electron imaging (BEI), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), backscatter Mossbauer spectrometry (BaMS), spectral reflectance spectroscopy, ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) analysis, and wavelength dispersive spectrometry (WDS). SEM/EDX results for patina on high-Ti mare basalt 75075 were reported by McKay et al in LPSC XXVI. Our current focus is on the patina on crystalline matrix breccia 76015. Our initial results show that the 76015 patina is very complex with characteristics that vary widely over a short distance. The 76015 patina is a good example of classic patina with typical lunar surface exposure features such as microcraters and glass pancakes, and is defined here as accretionary microcratered pancake-bearing (AMP) patina.

S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference|27||661|The surfaces of lunar materials that are exposed to the space environment are modified by a number of processes which alter their chemical and physical characteristics. These surface modifications on lunar rocks result in the formation of patina. The presence of patina obscures the underlying mineralogy and can strongly affect the optical properties of the substrate. Patinas are important in the further exploration of the Moon and other airless bodies in the Solar System because of their effects on remotely-sensed data (both spectral and chemical). We present here the results of a detailed study of a small region of patina on 76015 as part of a consortium study on the nature and effects of space weathering on the lunar surface (see companion abstract Wentworth S. J. et al.).

S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1649|Microcraters from about 100-200 A to larger than 1000 A true diameter have been measured by SEM at magnifications of 100,000x on lunar samples 76015,24,9003 and 76015,28,9004. The cumulative size frequency distribution has a slope of approximately -2.5 for craters larger than or equal to 1000 A, approximately -1.3 between 1000 A and 400 A diameters, and approaches zero at the smallest diameters. Distributions from lunar soil grains exposed during ancient epochs have the same form. Ninety-six of ninety-seven craters observed are equidimensional, indicating equidimensional dust particles with masses as low as 10 to the -20th grams. No lower limit on cosmic dust grain sizes was established. The flux and the crater production rate derived are consistent with 12054 measurements.
1977PhDT.........7D|1977|Constraints on the composition and chemical evolution of the earth's moon|Delano, J. W.|Ph.D. Thesis||||The origin, composition, and evolution of the earth's moon remain controversial topics in the post-Apollo era. In an attempt to provide additional constraints on these complex, multifaceted problems, three topics were investigated. Chapter 2 involves the experimental determination of the melting relations for three rocks (63545; 76055; 76015) from the lunar highlands. The experiments were performed for the purpose of establishing whether any of these compositions could have been derived by partial melting of the lunar interior. The results suggest that none of these rocks are likely to have originated by partial melting of either cosmic or differentiated reservoirs at any depth in the moon. Instead, these samples are probably impact-melts of a multilithologic system in the lunar crust. Chapter 3 mathematically evaluates the possibility of generating the abundances of Sr, Ce, Sm, and Yb in three, highlands noritic rocks (62295; 76015; 15386) by partial melting of cosmic reservoirs. Chapter 4 describes the calculation and melting relations of a refractory, moon composition.

W.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2097|The experiments discussed were conducted for the purpose of placing additional constraints on the origin of lunar highlands noritic compositions. The sample 63545 represents a fine-grained, crystalline melt rock consisting of pink spinel, plagioclase, divine, interstitial glass, minor oxides, and metal. According to Chao (1973), 76055 is an olivine-bearing micronorite hornfels with abundant xenocrysts and xenoliths. The sample 76015 is a vesicular, poikilitic impact melt with a homogeneous matrix. The obtained experimental melting relations of 63545, 76055, and 76015, are examined, taking into account experimental petrology and trace element chemistry of mare basalts. It is concluded that the studied compositions do not represent magmas derived by partial melting of either cosmic or differentiated source regions at any pressure in the moon. Presently available information would seem to favor an origin by impact-fusion of several highlands components.

A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2251|Eighteen sections representing five matrix samples - 76015, 76215, 76275, 76295, and 76315 - from the Station 6 boulder were examined with emphasis on the textures and compositions of their native FeNi metal particles. It is found that many of the complex multiphase structures of the metal particles observed in the study cannot be explained by a continuous two-stage cooling of the impact-melt sheet. It is suggested that at least locally the boulder samples must have experienced multistage cooling and heating.

M.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||719|Vugs from 76015 and 76215 are lined with euhedral crystals of plagioclase, pyroxene, ilmenite, Ni-Fe, and troilite. Smaller crystals of chromite, pentlandite, and chalcopyrite occur on the surface of the troilite in 76015. Wire Cu and dendritic-metallic Cu occurs with metallic Ni-Fe and troilite in some vugs of 76215. Troilite in both samples may have crystallized from an immiscible sulfide liquid. With falling temperature, chalcopyrite, and pentlandite may have exsolved from the troilite in 76015. By contrast, metallic Cu may have formed in 76215 by thermal breakdown of a bornite, troilite, and Ni-Fe assemblage which originally crystallized from a low-Ni immiscible sulfide liquid.

Processes which alter the albedo and possibly the chemistry of exposed lunar surfaces are also considered. Measurements are reported of solar flare track gradients in rock 64455 which is sufficiently young to have uneroded surfaces on its sides. Attention is also given to accretionary particles adhering to host surfaces, microcraters on soil particles, and microcraters on the oriented surfaces of sample 76015 from a boulder at Station 6 of the Apollo 17 site.
