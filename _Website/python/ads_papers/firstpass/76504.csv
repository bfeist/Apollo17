1986JGR....91..319W|1986|A potpourri of pristine moon rocks, including a VHK mare basalt and aunique, augite-rich Apollo 17 anorthosite.|Warren, P. H., Shirley, D. N., Kallemeyn, G. W.|Journal of Geophysical Research|91||D319|The anorthosite fragment, 76504,18, the first of the Apollo 17's pristine anorthosites, was found to have: (1) a higher ratio of high-Ca pyroxine to low-Ca pyroxene, (2) higher Na in its plagioclase, (3) higher contents of incompatible elements, and (4) a higher Eu/Al ratio in comparison to ferroan anorthosites. With a parent melt having a negative Eu anomaly, 76504,18 closely resembles a typical mare basalt. This anorthosite was among the latest to be formed by plagioclase flotation above a primordial magmasphere; typical mare basalt regions accumulated at about the same time or even earlier. Another fragment 14181c, a very high potassium basalt, was studied and found to be similar to typical Apollo 14 mare basalt though it has a K/La ratio of 1050. It is suggested that this lithology formed after a normal Apollo 14 mare basaltic melt partially assimilated granite. New data for siderphile elements in Apollo 12 mare basalts indicate that only the lowest of earlier data are trustworthy as being free of laboratory contamination.
1986JGR....91D.319W|1986|A potpourri of pristine moon rocks, including a VHK mare basalt and a unique, augite-rich Apollo 17 anorthosite|Warren, Paul H., Shirley, David N., Kallemeyn, Gregory W.|Journal of Geophysical Research|91|B4|D319|Analysis of previously unstudied Apollo lithic fragments continues to yield surprising results. Among this year's samples is a small anorthosite fragment, 76504,18, the first pristine anorthosite found from Apollo 17. This unique lithology strongly resembles the main type of Apollo anorthosites ferroan anorthosites), but 76504,18 has a far higher ratio (about 9) of high-Ca pyroxene to low-Ca pyroxene, higher Na in its plagioclase, higher contents of incompatible elements such as REE, and a higher Eu/Al ratio. Assuming that 76504,18 is a cumulate with less than 45% trapped liquid, its parent melt probably had a negative Eu anomaly. In all these respects, 76504,18 seems more likely than (other) ferroan anorthosites to be closely related to typical mare basalts. Apparrently this anorthosite was among the latest to form by plagioclase flotation abovbe a primordial magmasphere; typical mare basalt source regions probably accumulated at about the same time or even earlier. Another previusly unstudied fragment, 14181c,is a VKH (very high potassium) basalt that is similar in most respects to typical (``aluminous'') Apollo 14 mare basalt but has a K/La ratio of 1050. This lithology probably formed after a normal Apollo 14 mare basaltic melt partially assimilated granite. New data for siderophile elements in Apollo 1 mare basalts indicate that only the lowest of earlier data are trustworthy a being free of laboratory contamination.
