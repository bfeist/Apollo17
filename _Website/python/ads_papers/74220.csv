2019AGUFM.V43D0115Z|2019|Stable isotope fractionations in the Moon|Zhang, Y.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2019||V43D-0115|Investigations of isotope fractionation of many traditional and nontraditional stable isotopes in the Moon reveal large fractionation in H, Cl, Li, B, Zn, Cu, and S isotopes (1-3), but much smaller fractionation, less than 1‰, in K and Rb stable isotopes (4,5). For some elements such as Li, B and S, isotope fractionation in lunar rocks is expected due to known fractionation in terrestrial rocks at similar magnitude. For others, the magnitude of fractionation is much greater in lunar rocks than in terrestrial rocks. What controls the magnitude of stable isotope fractionation in the Moon? <P />One might first think that large stable isotope fractionation in the Moon is due to "volatility" of volatile elements, possibly inversely related to the condensation temperature Tc (6), or to the degree of volatile depletion in the Moon. However, the magnitude of stable isotope fractionation is not inversely related to the condensation temperature, or positively related to the degree of depletion. For example, Cl and Cu are less volatile (higher Tc) but have greater magnitude of stable isotope fractionation than Rb. <P />Recently, Ni et al. (7) compared elemental concentrations in olivine-hosted melt inclusions (approximating pre-eruptive concentrations) and orange glass beads (reflecting post-eruptive loss) in Apollo sample 74220. The degree of post-eruptive loss follows the following sequence: H (99% loss) &gt;&gt; Cl &gt;&gt; Zn ≈ Cu &gt; S &gt; Rb &gt; K ≈ Li (no loss). The sequence almost perfectly matches the trend of isotope fractionation magnitude in the Moon. It is hence concluded that the global depletion of the Moon relative to the Earth did not result in significant stable isotope fractionation, and the large stable isotope fractionation for some elements in the Moon is mainly due to magmatic degassing at high temperature and near vacuum environment, similar to post-eruptive devolatization of fire fountain orange glass beads. <P />References Saal AE, Hauri E, Van Orman JA, Rutherford M (2013) Science 340:1317-1320 Wang Y, Hsu W, Guan Y (2019) Sci Reports 9:5727 Teng FZ, Watkins J, Dauphas N (eds) (2017) Non-Traditional Stable Isotopes.

2018AGUFM.P51C..07H|2018|Ferrobasalt from the Snake River Plain and its utility as a spectral planetary analog|Haberle, C. W., Christensen, P. R.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2018||P51C-07|The Snake River Plain (SRP) is host to extensive intra-plate volcanism characterized by a bi-modal distribution of tholeiitic basalt and potassic rhyolite. Rare compositionally intermediate lavas are located in Craters of the Moon (COTM) and represent fractionated liquids evolved from the same parental magma which gave rise to the tholeiitic plains basalts common on the SRP. Chemically, the SRP suite exhibits a tholeiitic differentiation trend with initial fractional crystallization leading to synchronous enrichment of Fe and Ti in the residual liquids. Abundances reach peaks of 16.0 (FeO<SUB>total</SUB>) and 3.0 wt% (TiO<SUB>2</SUB>) before rapidly diminishing in more evolved lavas. It has been shown experimentally that coupled Fe-Ti enrichment and depletion trends are the result of ilmenite (FeTiO<SUB>3</SUB>) saturation and fractionation (Juster et al. 1989). Detailed petrographic analysis of COTM ferrobasalts reveals two populations of Fe-Ti oxides, clusters of octahedral titanomagnetite microphenocrysts (10-50 μm) set in the glassy groundmass and acicular ilmenite crystals (&lt;10μm) mantling microphenocrysts. Ilmenite crystals likely grew rapidly as the ferrobasaltic magma was erupted near ilmenite saturation and rapidly cooled, consistent with the high glass contents observed. Visible near-IR reflectance spectra of the COTM ferrobasalts are characterized by an absorption near 0.59 μm with a smooth red-sloped spectrum &gt;1.0 μm with weak absorptions near 1.05 and 1.2 μm. These bands can be assigned to Fe<SUP>2+</SUP>-Ti<SUP>4+</SUP>charge transfer absorption in ilmenite (0.59 μm) and Fe<SUP>2+</SUP>crystal field absorptions in olivine (1.05 and 1.2 μm). The presence of fine-grained ilmenite mantling phenocrysts in the COTM ferrobasalts results in a spectrum dominated by ilmenite with little evidence for olivine, despite containing an estimated 10-15% olivine by volume. A similar petrographic texture, described as olivine needles/microlites set in a glassy matrix and mantled with feathery ilmenite, was observed in the black vitrophyric beads found in the Apollo 17 soil (74001/74220) near Shorty crater and the VNIR spectra also show striking similarities to the COTM ferrobasalts. Here we discuss the ability of fine-grained opaques to mask the signatures of mafic silicates and the implications for compositional remote-sensing studies of terrestrial bodies.|

A., Basu, A.|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|53|5|1096|Lunar samples provide ground-truth for all planetary exploration. Lunar soils, especially their &lt;1 mm fraction, constitute the only primary standards for remotely sensing the composition of small airless planetary bodies. Therefore, maintaining the integrity, especially of the &lt;1 mm fraction, takes on a much larger, big picture responsibility. A possibility has been suggested that lunar soils may disintegrate (to smaller grain sizes) if exposed to the Earth's moist atmosphere, thus losing some of their intrinsic value to science. We have tested that possibility by multiple, independent reanalyses with three techniques (wet-sieving in water and in alcohol, and laser diffractometry) using a fresh allocation of Apollo 17 "orange soil," 74220. Our results are very similar to each other despite repeated soaking-drying in water, and also to those originally determined in the 1970s. We have also used a laser diffractometry technique to reanalyze the grain sizes of 50 mg splits of eight soils that were initially analyzed three to four decades ago. The results are randomly different from previous measurements, which we attribute to nonrepresentative subsampling of very small amounts from previous allocations; 50 mg is too small for obtaining representative aliquots. The results of grain-size analyses presented and discussed in this study indicate that the integrity of the lunar soil 74220, and indeed, all lunar soils, has not been physically compromised in the last four decades.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maps.13060

L., Peslier, Anne H., Lange, Rebecca A., Dingwell, Donald B., Neal, Clive R.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|503||88|It is widely accepted that the Apollo 17 orange glass beads are of volcanic origin. The degree of degassing of the glass beads depends on their cooling rates, so the estimation of volatile contents in the parental magmas of these lunar pyroclastic glasses also depends on the cooling rates. The cooling rate can be estimated using the calorimetric properties of the glass across the glass transition. In this study, a series of heat capacity measurements were carried out on hand-picked lunar volcanic orange glass beads during several cycles of heating to temperatures above their glass transition using a differential scanning calorimeter. The cooling rate of orange glass beads (sample 74220,867) was calculated to be 101 K/min using the correlation between glass cooling rates and fictive temperatures estimated from their heat capacity-temperature paths. This cooling rate is close to the lower end of the range that best fits the diffusion profiles of several volatile species in the glass beads, and at the upper end of the cooling-rate range recorded in glasses quenched subaerially on Earth. The cooling rate is likely to be controlled by the cooling environment (cooling medium) such that the lunar volcanic glass beads could have been cooled in a gaseous medium released from volcanic eruptions on the Moon, but not during "free flight" in vacuum. The existence of a gas medium suggests, in turn, that there may have been at least a short-lived or episodic atmosphere on the early Moon at around 3.5 Ga.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2018.09.019

2017PhDT........61N|2017|Copper Diffusion in Silicate Melts and Melt Inclusion Study on Volatiles in The Lunar Interior|Ni, Peng|Ph.D. Thesis||||This thesis focuses on the application of diffusion kinetics to both terrestrial and lunar geochemistry. In Chapters II and III, diffusivities of Cu in silicate melts were experimentally determined and used to discuss the role of Cu diffusion in formation of Cu ore deposits and also Cu isotope fractionation in tektites. In Chapters IV and V, lunar olivine-hosted melt inclusions are studied to understand their volatile loss during homogenization in lab, to estimate cooling rate for lunar Apollo sample 74220, and to estimate volatile abundance in the lunar mantle. Magmatic sulfide deposits and porphyry-type Cu deposits are two major types of Cu deposits that supply the world's Cu. In particular, porphyry-type Cu deposits provide ∼57% of the world's total discovered Cu. Recent studies suggest a potential role of diffusive transport of metals (e.g. Cu, Au, PGE, Mo) in the formation of magmatic sulfide deposits and porphyry-type deposits. Diffusivities of Cu in silicate melts, however, are poorly determined. In Chapters II and III of this thesis, Cu diffusion in basaltic melt and rhyolitic melts are studied by diffusion couple and chalcocite "dissolution" methods. Our results indicate high diffusivities of Cu and a general equation for Cu diffusion in silicate melts is obtained. The high diffusivity of Cu indicate that partition of Cu between the silicate phase and the sulfide or fluid phase can be assumed to be in equilibrium during the formation of magmatic sulfide deposits or porphyry-type deposits. In addition, our Cu diffusion data helps explain why Cu isotopes are more fractionated than Zn isotopes in tektites. Volatile abundances in the lunar mantle have profound implications for the origin of the Moon, which was thought to be bone-dry till about a decade ago, when trace amounts of H2O were detected in various types of lunar samples. In particular, high H2O concentrations comparable to mid-ocean ridge basalts were reported in lunar melt inclusions. There are still uncertainties, however, for lunar melt inclusion studies in at least two aspects. One is whether the low H2O/Ce ratios measured in homogenized crystalline inclusions are affected by the homogenization process. The other is that current estimation of volatile abundances in lunar mantle relies heavily on 74220, which is argued to be a local anomaly by some authors. In order to reach a conclusive answer on volatile abundances in lunar mantle, the above two questions have to be answered. To improve our understanding about these questions, in Chapter IV of this thesis, a series of experiments are carried out to understand possible volatile loss from lunar melt inclusions during homogenization. Our results indicate significant H2O loss from inclusions during homogenization in minutes, whereas loss of F, Cl or S is unlikely a concern under our experimental conditions. The most applicable way to preserve H2O during homogenization is to use large inclusions. In Chapter V of this thesis, volatile, trace and major element data for melt inclusions from 10020, 12040, 15016, 15647 and 74235 are reported. Our new data indicate large variation in H2O/Ce ratios from ∼77 to ∼1 across different lunar samples, which is at least partially due to H2O loss on lunar surface during cooling. In addition, evidences were found in F/Nd and S/Dy ratios that might suggest lunar mantle heterogeneity in terms of its volatile abundances.|

The picritic glasses were collected from the lunar surface during the Apollo missions, and they are hypothesized to have rapidly quenched as glass beads during pyroclastic fire fountain eruptions. The specific melt compositions investigated in the present study are the Apollo 15 green glass Type C (A15C, TiO<SUB>2</SUB> = 0.26 wt%), the Apollo 14 yellow glass (A14Y, TiO<SUB>2</SUB> = 4.58 wt%), the Apollo 17 orange glass 74220-type (A17O TiO<SUB>2</SUB> = 9.12 wt%), and the Apollo 14 black glass (A14B, TiO<SUB>2</SUB> = 16.40 wt%). These glasses are reported to represent primary unfractionated melts, making them a prime candidate for experimental studies into lunar basalt density and compressibility during partial melting of the lunar mantle. Sink-float experiments were conducted on the synthetic molten lunar glass compositions using a piston-cylinder apparatus (P &lt; 2 GPa) and a Walker-style multi-anvil device (P &gt; 2.5 GPa) in order to bracket the density of the melts. New sink-float data are reported for A15C, A14Y, and A17O, which are combined with previously published density and compressibility data on A15C, A17O, and A14B. Although the Ti-rich liquids are highly compressible at lower pressures, they become nearly incompressible at much higher pressures when compared to the molten low-Ti glasses. Consequently, the melts with the most TiO<SUB>2</SUB> (A14B) are the least dense at higher pressures, a reversal of what is seen at lower pressures. This change in density and compressibility is attributed to changes in coordination of Ti and Fe in the silicate melt structure. As Ti<SUP>4+</SUP> abundances in the silicate melt increase, predominantly <SUP>[IV]</SUP>Ti<SUP>4+</SUP> and <SUP>[IV]</SUP>Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> change to <SUP>[VI]</SUP>Ti<SUP>4+</SUP> and <SUP>[VI]</SUP>Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> in the melt structure. All of the data from the present study were used to calculate a Birch-Murnaghan equation-of-state (BM-EOS) for each melt composition. The BM-EOS model for each composition was then combined with previously published estimates for the residual mantle source mineralogy and depth of origin for each of the glasses to assess the density of the partial melt with respect to its point of origin. This information was used to determine whether or not the melt would rise or sink with respect to its source region. We determined that all melt compositions, with the exception of the A17O melt, should have been able to rise to the crust-mantle boundary as a result of buoyancy forces alone, although different mechanisms are likely required for magma ascent through the lunar crust. For the rise of A17O, other modes of ascent through the lunar mantle are required to extract this melt composition from the mantle, and volatiles are not a plausible solution on the grounds of melt density alone.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2014.10.029

J., Mahadevan, S., Rutherford, M. J.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2014||P12B-01|The oxidation state of igneous materials on a planet is a critically-important variable in understanding magma evolution on bodies in our solar system. However, direct and indirect methods for quantifying redox states are challenging, especially across the broad spectrum of silicate glass compositions found on airless bodies. On the Moon, early Mössbauer studies of bulk samples suggested the presence of significant Fe3+ (&gt;10%) in lunar glasses (green, orange, brown); lunar analog glasses synthesized at fO2 &lt;10-11 have similar Fe3+. All these Mössbauer spectra are challenging to interpret due to the presence of multiple coordination environments in the glasses. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) allows pico- and nano-scale interrogation of primitive planetary materials using the pre-edge, main edge, and EXAFS regions of absorption edge spectra. Current uses of XAS require availability of standards with compositions similar to those of unknowns and complex procedures for curve-fitting of pre-edge features that produce results with poorly constrained accuracy. A new approach to accurate and quantitative redox measurements with XAS is to couple use of spectra from synthetic glass standards covering a broad compositional range with multivariate analysis (MVA) techniques. Mössbauer and XAS spectra from a suite of 33 synthetic glass standards covering a wide range of compositions and fO2(Dyar et al., this meeting) were used to develop a MVA model that utilizes valuable predictive information not only in the major spectral peaks/features, but in all channels of the XAS region. Algorithms for multivariate analysis t were used to "learn" the characteristics of a data set as a function of varying spectral characteristics. These models were applied to the study of lunar glasses, which provide a challenging test case for these newly-developed techniques due to their very low fO2. Application of the new XAS calibration model to Apollo 15 green (15426, 15427 and 15425), Apollo 17 orange (74220 ), and other lunar glasses confirms the Fe3+ contents from Mössbauer and shows that higher-Si glasses tend to have slightly elevated Fe3+.|

In the lunar pressure range, two experiments containing pure forsterite (Fo <SUB>100</SUB>) spheres at 1.0 GPa and 1727 K, and at 1.3 GPa-1739 K, showed neutral buoyancies, indicating that the density of molten orange glass was equal to the density of Fo <SUB>100</SUB> at these conditions (3.09 ± 0.02 g cm <SUP>-3</SUP>). A third tight sink/float bracket using Fo <SUB>90</SUB> spheres corresponds to a melt density of 3.25 ± 0.02 g cm <SUP>-3</SUP> at ∼2.8 GPa and ∼1838 K. Our data predict a density crossover for the molten orange glass composition with equilibrium orthopyroxene at ∼2.8 GPa, equivalent to a depth of ∼600 km in the lunar mantle, and a density of ∼3.25 g cm <SUP>-3</SUP>. This crossover depth is close to the orange glass multiple saturation point, representing its minimum formation depth, at the appropriate oxygen fugacity (2.8-2.9 GPa). A density crossover with equilibrium olivine is predicted to fall outside the lunar pressure range (&gt;4.7 GPa), indicating that molten orange glass is always less dense than its equilibrium olivines in the Moon. Our data therefore suggest that that lunar liquids with orange glass composition are buoyant with respect to their source region at P &lt; ∼2.8 GPa, enabling their initial rise to the surface without the need for additional external driving forces. Fitting the density data to a Birch-Murnaghan equation of state at 2173 K leads to an array of acceptable solutions ranging between 16.1 and 20.3 GPa for the isothermal bulk modulus K<SUB>2173</SUB> and 3.6-8 for its pressure derivative K', with best-fit values K<SUB>2173</SUB> = 18.8 GPa and K' = 4.4 when assuming a model 1 bar density value of 2.86 g cm <SUP>-3</SUP>. When assuming a slightly lower 1 bar density value of 2.84 g cm <SUP>-3</SUP> we find a range for K<SUB>2173</SUB> of 14.4-18.0 and K' 3.7-8.7, with best-fit values of 17.2 GPa and 4.5, respectively.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2010.11.022

E., Agee, C. B., McCubbin, F. M.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2011||MR21A-2109|This study focuses on the density and compressibility of three lunar glass compositions encountered during the Apollo missions to the Moon. These glasses are hypothesized to have rapidly quenched as glass beads during lunar fire fountain eruptions. The lunar glass beads have distinctive colors that correspond to TiO<SUB>2</SUB> content. The glasses of interest for this study are the Apollo 15 green glass Type C (A15C) which has a low TiO<SUB>2</SUB> content of only 0.26 wt%, the Apollo 17 orange glass (74220-type), which has a moderately high TiO<SUB>2</SUB> content of 9.12 wt%, and the Apollo 14 black glass which has the highest TiO<SUB>2</SUB> content with 16.40 wt%. These glasses represent primary, unfractionated melts making them a prime candidate for experimental studies into lunar basalt density and eruptability during partial melting of the lunar mantle. Sink/float experiments were performed on both A15C and the A17 74220-type, and previously published data from the A14 black glass were used. Experiments were performed in both a piston cylinder apparatus for pressures up to 2.5 GPa and a Walker-style multi-anvil device for pressures greater than 2.5 GPa. Thus far we have estimated the density and compressibility of the orange glass successfully up to 8 GPa with future experiments planned for 10 GPa. Although these pressures exceed that of the lunar interior (~4.7 GPa), higher experimental pressures are important for determination of melt bulk modulus and identification of such factors as compositional effects on melt compressibility. Experiments have also been run on A15C for pressures relevant to the lunar interior. Our sink/float observations at 8 GPa confirm that the orange glass density curve can be approximated by a straight line at liquidus temperatures, while the black glass shows a strong decrease in slope with pressure, especially above 3 GPa. The different slopes between these two glasses creates a density crossover at approximately 6 GPa. SiO<SUB>2</SUB>, TiO<SUB>2</SUB>, and FeO are the largest compositional differences between the volcanic glasses investigated; however Ti<SUP>4+</SUP> has the ability to exist in the silicate melt both as a network former and a network modifier (whereas Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> is typically a network modifier and Si<SUP>4+</SUP> is typically a network former under the experimental conditions we investigate). Certainly, the pronounced flattening of the molten black glass compression curve at pressures above 3 GPa may be reflecting the completion of the coordination change to 6-fold in a large number of Ti-sites. If so, then one would expect to see a compressibility decrease as melt density experiences little or no boost from coordination change with higher compressions as we see in our orange glass results. Therefore, Ti<SUP>4+</SUP> has the greatest potential to be the primary driving force behind the differences in compressibility and density observed in this and previous studies of the lunar picritic glasses.|

J.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|224|3-4|399|Abundances of the highly siderophile elements (HSE) Re, Ir, Os, Ru, Pt and Pd were determined for etchates and residues of highly purified lunar orange (74220 and 74001,1217 and 1218) and green (15421,65 and 15426,164) volcanic glasses. Most etchates have &gt;100 pg/g Os and Ir, and in some instances have HSE concentrations that approach chondritic relative abundances. Some etchates also have <SUP>187</SUP>Os/ <SUP>188</SUP>Os within the range of chondritic meteorites. In contrast, most residues have Os concentrations of &lt;50 pg/g and have considerably suprachondritic <SUP>187</SUP>Os/ <SUP>188</SUP>Os ratios. The disparities in Os isotopic compositions between etchates and residues reflect the presence of at least two components in each of the glass fractions. The components are interpreted to be the indigenous lunar glasses and a meteoritic contaminant. Mixing models suggest the indigenous components in orange and green glasses have Os concentrations ≤25 pg/g. Compared to terrestrial rocks with comparable MgO contents, the concentration estimates suggest the lunar mantle sources of the volcanic glasses were depleted in HSE by at least a factor of 20 relative to the terrestrial mantle, consistent with Os and Ir concentrations in the lunar mantle of ≤0.15 ng/g. The HSE depletion in the lunar mantle indicates that it may be missing a substantial share of late accreted materials. The depletion is best explained as a consequence of the early formation of the lunar crust and subsequent isolation of the lunar mantle from late accreted materials. Given that the lunar crust was largely formed by 4.4 Ga, this suggests a preponderance of late accreted materials were added to the Earth-Moon system subsequent to 4.4 Ga, and requires a substantial influx of mass into the inner solar system more than 150 Ma after the formation of the solar system.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2004.05.036

Changes of <SUP>114</SUP>Cd/<SUP>113</SUP>Cd of 0.3-0.5% in samples 60501,105, 65701,23 and 72161,73, of 0.4 and 0.8% in <SUP>158</SUP>Gd/<SUP>157</SUP>Gd in samples 14163,848 and 60501,105 and of 0.8, 1.2 and 0.06% for <SUP>150</SUP>Sm/<SUP>149</SUP>Sm in samples 14163,848 and 60501,105 and 74220,125 respectively, have been observed. This is the first time that neutron capture on Cd has been detected in lunar samples. Thermal neutrons are captured preferentially at resonance energies of 0.03 eV by <SUP>155</SUP>Gd and <SUP>157</SUP>Gd, at 0.09 eV by <SUP>149</SUP>Sm and at 0.178 eV by <SUP>113</SUP>Cd.

Previous work has compared changes in <SUP>158</SUP>Gd/<SUP>157</SUP>Gd and <SUP>150</SUP>Sm/<SUP>149</SUP>Sm, while this study extends the comparison to <SUP>114</SUP>Cd/<SUP>113</SUP>Cd, where the resonance energy is significantly higher. This has enabled us to confirm evidence for a harder neutron energy spectrum in lunar soil than is predicted theoretically. This can be seen in significantly higher capture rates than predicted for <SUP>149</SUP>Sm compared to <SUP>157</SUP>Gd. We also present evidence of enhanced capture rates on <SUP>113</SUP>Cd compared with <SUP>149</SUP>Sm and <SUP>157</SUP>Gd. The concentrations of Cd, Gd and Sm in nine lunar samples have also been measured by isotope dilution mass spectrometry with Cd being measured in lunar samples for the first time by this method.

The Moon's rocks and soil contain resources that could be used to support a future lunar base for research or for launching expeditions into deep space. Lunar O is the resource most likely to be exploited first, for both propulsion and life support. The efficiency of O extraction from lunar materials has been shown to depend strongly on the material's chemical and mineralogical composition.Some lunar materials may be rare and vital enough on Earth to justify the cost of their return. The rare isotope He-3, which can be used in an efficient and low-polluting fusion power reaction, has been cited as one such resource. Over 20 different processes have been proposed for O production on the Moon. Among the simplest and best studied of these processes is the reduction of oxides in lunar minerals and glass using H gas. It was reported that the results of O extraction experiments on 16 lunar soils. Each sample was reacted in flowing H for 3 h at 1050 C. Total O yield correlated strongly to each sample's initial Fe2+ abundance. A linear least-squares fit of O yield vs. Fe2+ for 16 lunar soils yielded a regression line with a slope of 0.19, an intercept of 0.55 wt% O and an r-square value of 0.87. Oxygen yield did not significantly correlate with the abundance of any element except Fe. Thus, O yield from lunar soils can be predicted with nearly 90% confidence based solely on their iron abundances. The potential for O production at any location on the Moon can be predicted if the soil's Fe concentration is known. On a global scale, Fe concentration in the near surface has been estimated from data returned by a variety of spacecraft. Iron was one of several elements measured from near equatorial orbits during the Apollo 15 and 16 missions, using gamma ray spectrometry. These data covered approximately 20% of the lunar surface, with spatial resolutions of about 100 km. An improved gamma ray spectrometer and a neutron spectrometer, flown on the Lunar Prospector spacecraft in a polar orbit, provided Fe abundance data for the entire lunar surface, again at a spatial resolution of about 100 km. A technique for iron assessment based on orbital multispectral imaging has been developed. This method correlates Fe abundance to a parameter derived from reflectance values at 750 and900nm. The authors use data from the Clementine spacecraft to map Fe abundances across nearly the entire lunar surface. These data can support identification of Fe-rich regions as small as a few hundred meters across. Researchers find good agreement between gamma-ray/neutron and multispectral Fe determinations for most areas on the Moon. The H-reduction experiments cited above also showed submillimeter volcanic glass beads could be highly desirable feedstocks for lunar O production. Iron-rich species, represented by glassy (orange) and crystalline (black) beads, promise particularly high O yields. Apollo 17 volcanic glass sample 74220, composed predominantly of orange glass beads with an average diameter of 40 mm, contains 17.8 wt% Fe2+. Reduction of this sample yielded 4.3 wt% O, well above the regression line defined by the experiments on 16 lunar soils. Sample 74001 is dominated by black crystalline beads, the isochemical equivalent of orange glasses. Reduction of 74001 yielded 4.7 wt% O, the highest value for any lunar sample. Extensive areas of the lunar surface covered by volcanic glass beads have been delineated using Earth based data and spacecraft orbital photography. Chemical compositions of the deposits have been estimated and mixing ratios of glassy and crystalline glass beads have been determined. Clementine multispectral imagery has been employed to determine the precise extent and estimate the thickness of one widespread deposit, that of the Aristarchus Plateau. Lunar ice could prove to be a highly advantageous O source, compared to O derived from soil reduction, in terms of process complexity and power requirements. Thus, a deposit of ice on the Moon is a potentially important resource.Permanently shadowed polar craters have been modeled as possible cold traps for water ice, derived either from indigenous sources or from comets. Any lunar ice deposits must occur in extremely restricted areas near the poles. Only crater interiors that are permanently shadowed from sunlight are cold enough to have retained volatiles for a significant part of the Moon's history. Clementine images and Earth-based radar have demonstrated that craters whose interiors are never exposed to sunlight do exist near the lunar poles. Water ice has been tentatively identified in some of these craters using Clementine bi-static radar data. Lunar Prospector mapped the epithermal and fast-neutron fluxes across the entire Moon. Low epithermal fluxes are correlated with concentrations of H, and by extension ice, in the near-surface. Such signatures were observed near permanently-shadowed craters at both lunar poles. Calculation of the actual amount of water ice in these cold traps is strongly model-dependent but each polar region could contain as much as 3x10<SUP>9</SUP> t of water ice. The concentration of solar wind-implanted He in mare regolith increases with the soil's Ti content. This correlation is apparently due to preferential adsorption of He by ilmenite grains. Thus, Ti in mare soils is a predictor of the He-3 resource. Additional information is contained in the original.|
1999nvm..conf...12F|1999|Subpixel Detection of Pyroclastic Materials in Clementine Ultra Violet-Visible Data|Farrand, W. H., Gaddis, L. R.|New Views of the Moon 2: Understanding the Moon Through the Integration of Diverse Datasets|||12|Lunar pyroclastic deposits represent a style of volcanism different from that responsible for the flood basalts that fill the mare basins. As volatile-coated, primitive materials originating deep (about 400 km) within the Moon, these products of explosive volcanic eruptions are also important as probes of mantle composition and as a potential resource for future settlers. While many of the lunar pyroclastic deposits are spatially restricted and relatively small in size, they are easily resolvable at the spatial scale (about 100 m/pixel) of the Clementine UV-VIS camera. Recent studies confirm previous results indicating that these deposits are not compositionally uniform, and suggest that further analyses can help to identify possible genetic relationships among lunar pyroclastic deposits, characterize their juvenile components, and clarify their relationships to nearby maria. Among the juvenile materials from sampled lunar pyroclastic deposits are the orange glass and devitrified black beads found in the Taurus-Littrow Valley and the green glass found by Apollo 15. Recent studies suggest that deposits dominated by materials such as these may represent end members in the observed compositional variations among the lunar pyroclastic deposits. Here we present preliminary results of analyses focused on the use of the Clementine UV-VIS data for characterizing the composition and distribution of juvenile pyroclastic materials. Our test case for detailed mapping of a lunar pyroclastic deposit is that of the Apollo 17 landing site in the Taurus-Littrow (TL) Valley. Although black beads dominate the observed spectral reflectance at this site, sample data show that the pyroclastic eruption changed character, producing first orange glass and then black beads. To assess the compositional variability of this deposit, especially our ability to distinguish the orange glasses, we apply techniques based on spectral mixture analysis to detect materials at subpixel scales. The low albedo and subdued absorption features of the Taurus-Littrow deposit make this a challenging task. In recent years, several subpixel detection techniques have been developed for use with terrestrial airborne imaging spectrometer data. A technique that is functionally equivalent to spectral mixture analysis, the orthogonal subspace projection (OSP) technique is used for the simulations presented here. In OSP, a target spectrum is projected onto a subspace that is orthogonal to a set of background spectra. In this process, the response from the background spectra are nulled and that of the target is maximized. For the TL site, the spectra used for the simulation included three laboratory-measured sample spectra convolved to the five UV/VIS bandpasses, and two spectra extracted from UV-VIS data over the TL Valley. The target spectrum was the orange soil sample 74220 from the Shorty Crater rim. "Background" spectra were from samples 74221 (a gray soil found near the orange soil) and 75111 (a dark mare soil). From the UV/VIS data, additional background spectra were obtained at the mare/highland interface and from the "crater cluster" area in the TL Valley. In the simulation, the background spectra were randomly mixed in each of 100 samples with 0.1% Gaussian noise added. For samples 20,40, 60, and 80, the orange soil target was added in abundances of 90, 80, 60, and 40%. The 100-sample set was then reduced via OSP. For this example, the orange soil was detectable only at the 90 and 80% abundance levels. It was found that the addition of higher noise levels (about 1%), made the orange glass undetectable even at the 90% level. However, using background materials more representative of the highlands made the orange soil detectable at lower abundances. These results suggest that we should be able to map the distribution of juvenile pyroclastic materials, such as the orange glasses, using the Clementine UV-VIS data and subpixel analysis techniques such as spectral mixture analysis and foreground background analysis. Given the low albedo of these materials, a high fill factor will be required on a per pixel basis in order to achieve that mapping; however, observations made by others, including orbital observations by the Apollo 17 astronauts, have indicated that these abundances are met for several pyroclastic deposits. The production of such maps will help to constrain the dynamics of pyroclastic eruptions on the Moon by providing information on die type, relative quantity, and distribution of juvenile volcanic materials.

The sulphur contents of the bulk samples ate much lower than those of other lunar soils. These samples, along with the surface orange soil 74220 analysed previously, show an increase of sulphur concentration with decreasing particle size which is more marked than for other soils and indicates that the orange and black glass droplets have a coating enriched in sulphur and other volatile elements. In sharp contrast with other soils, the orange and black glasses have slight positive δ<SUP>34</SUP>S values for large particles while the smallest particle sizes show negative δ<SUP>34</SUP>S values. This indicates that the coating of the glassy droplets is enriched in isotopically light sulphur.

The anomalously high δ<SUP>34</SUP>S values of the fine fractions of the core bottom sample, 74001-135, combined with the results of an acid leaching experiment, indicate that these fractions are contaminated, possibly by a mature soil of high sulphur content and relatively positive δ<SUP>34</SUP>S value.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(83)90271-5

They are composed of three chemical groups connected by a pronounced trend. The liquidus phase relations are compatible with the view that the most Mg-rich group (A) was produced by partial melting of Ti-rich cumulates at a depth of about 480 km. The other red glasses (B and C) may have been derived from the group A magma by fractional crystallization at pressures less than 5 kbar. The fact that high-Ti mare liquids were produced at depths greatly in excess of 100 km requires an important revision of cumulate-remelting models. It is suggested that 4.4-AE cumulate rockbergs sank into the deep lunar interior soon after the global differentiation event. These blocks have a wide range of compositions and underwent partial melting at depths of 400 to 500 km to produce low- and high-Ti magmas.|

Also notable in this image are several strikingly bright (high 2.26 micron/0.56 micron ratio) areas which are likely to contain pyroclastic, glass-related materials. Some of these bright areas correspond to dark mantling material.

H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||2995|Multispectral mapping of the Apollo 15-Apennine region has allowed the identification of numerous dark mantle deposits of probable pyroclastic origin. The deposits display a low albedo, appear to mantle and slightly subdue subjacent terrain, are spectrally distinct on the multispectral maps (high in the infrared but low in the ultraviolet) and generally exhibit a weak depolarized 3.8 cm radar echo. These characteristics are consistent with an origin by pyroclastic eruption. The regional dark mantle deposits are commonly associated with vents along marginal fractures and faults near the base of the Apennines, thereby emphasizing the role of basin-controlled weaknesses in providing channels for the upward migration of magma generated at depth. The spectral properties of the pyroclastic deposits are incompatible with those of Apollo 15 green glass but the deposits may be composed of material similar to the Apollo 15 brown or yellow glass. If so, the widespread distribution of the deposits suggest that mare basalts genetically related to the brown or yellow glass may occur in the Apollo 15 region. Moreover, pyroclastic volcanic activity has apparently been a more important and widespread process in the Apollo 15-Apennine region than has previously been thought.|

A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||327|Eight siderophile elements, seven volatile elements, and U were determined in three samples from 74001 by radiochemical neutron activation analysis. The siderophile pattern closely corresponds to the addition of approximately 0.1% of II B iron meteorites, and the enrichment of nonsiderophile volatile elements seems to be derived from lunar sources with variation generally following Se content. In addition, in 74001 (predominantly black glass), moderately volatile elements (Ag, Zn) are more abundant than In, Cd, and particularly Bi, while in 74220 (mainly orange glass), Ag, Zn, In, and Cd are almost equally abundant, but Bi is as low as in 74001.|

S., Waits, G., Fuhrman, R.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1945|SEM-EDX analysis of the surface morphology of the 74001 and 74002 orange and black glassy droplets has revealed the presence of ubiquitous micromound coatings. Assuming that the diameter of an individual micromound is an indication of total coating thickness, then the thickness of this volatile and metal-rich layer ranges from less than 20 A to over 300 A in thickness. On rare droplets the micromound coating is partially covered by a sparse population of crystals and masses that are essentially NaCl in composition. Additionally, an irregular mass on the surface of one black droplet may contain free sulfur. Amoeboid masses of iron, some with incipient crystal faces, are also present on a few droplet surfaces. The above features, i.e., halite crystals, sulfur-rich masses and amoeboid iron, are rare; the more common occurrence of metals and volatiles is in the micromound coating. Based on our observations of several hundred spheres from both Apollo and Luna missions, the classic micromound coating is unique to the Apollo 15 green and Apollo 17 orange and black droplets. Although some investigators have proposed various impact sequences to produce these unique droplets, the volcanic fire fountain origin is favored.|

An exposure history of the core is proposed: accumulation (about 3.6 billion years ago), shallow burial (during the first 20 million years), deep burial (till about 10-15 million years ago), followed by excavation (10-15 million years ago), and in situ reworking (till the present).|

Significant reworking of the soil only occurred down to a few cm from the lunar surface since this event. Complementary investigations in this core by other groups are discussed. Most of the evidence available leads to a two stage model in which the orange and black soils collected at Shorty Crater were first irradiated for approximately 25 m.y. at some depth and then were deposited only a few m.y. ago as an overturned ejecta blanket.|

Since these droplets have S + Zn surface coatings with characteristics that fit a volcanic origin, the presence of similar coatings on dispersed droplets are taken as a good criterion of their volcanic origin. This criterion in concert with other criteria (homogeneity, absence of shocked relicts) that distinguish between volcanic and impact origins, has led to identification of a new ultramafic endogenous liquid that was erupted at Apollo 15. The brown glass droplets representing this liquid have a higher TiO2 content and are more mafic than any of the Apollo 15 basalts.|

The samples, taken from the core section below 5.5 cm and representing most of the major stratigraphic units described by Nagle (1978), consist entirely of whole and fragmented orange and black droplets. The grain shape, degree of crystallinity, breakage, vesicularity, predominant olivine shapes, and phenocryst content of about 18,000 droplets were investigated. The crystalline droplets were found to contain olivine and ilmenite as major phases and pyroxene, Cr-spinel and metallic Fe as minor phases. The grain shape, degree of crystallization, olivine shape and olivine composition suggest that a wide range of cooling rates is represented. The upper part of the core section (above 5.5 cm) has undergone in situ reworking by micrometeorites. The 74001/2 samples are believed to be from an ultramafic pyroclastic deposit brought to the surface by the Shorty Crater impact and originally formed by a lava fountain active in the Taurus-Littrow valley 3.5 b.y. ago. The sequence represented in the sample was most likely deposited over a very short period of time.|

In addition, redistribution of the volatiles by a cratering event is indicated by continuous decreases in Pb and Cd with core depth. Studies of Zn on individual regolith grains are also reported.|

The measurements required the use of newly established microanalytical techniques to obtain high quality analyses on about 0.5 mg particles with only a few hundred ppm K. An age of 3.60 plus or minus 0.04 b.y. is determined for the orange glass. No corrections for a trapped Ar-40 component were required. The glass forming event occurred at the very end of or after the extrusion of the mare basalts at the Apollo 17 site. An extremely well defined age plateau at 3.86 plus or minus 0.04 b.y. was determined for a 72435 plagioclase clast with attached matrix. A second large plagioclase crystal yielded significantly older ages over the last 60% of Ar release at high temperatures and is a relict clast incompletely degassed at the time of breccia formation. 72435 also contains plagioclase clasts with primitive Sr and a 4.55 AE old dunite clast. The Ar results provide additional evidence for the association of chemically unequilibrated, relict clasts with both primitive Sr and older K/Ar ages.|

The orange-black droplets in this section were probably formed from pyroclastic eruptions about 3.6 billion years ago; they give little indication of surface exposure. The isotopic concentrations suggest that cosmic ray irradiation of the core occurred in two stages and that the core stratigraphy was inverted between stages. The first irradiation stage may have taken place immediately after pyroclastic deposition of the droplets and could have lasted about 20 million years.|

The orange and black glassy soils in the core 74001/2 are homogeneous in composition and due to their unusual compositional characteristics probably have derived from a single source with the same composition. The top of the core has been reworked to a depth of about 5 cm. The reworked layer is marked by compositional differences in the first 3 cm which reflect the addition (at least 10%) of materials including mare basalt and a CaO-rich component. The maturity profile (I<SUB>s/FeO)</SUB> clearly indicates reworking depth of about 5 cm. It is likely that at least some of the ferro-magnetically active component (including agglutinitic glass) has been 'inherited' with the added material.|

A relatively recent disturbance to the U-Pb system during meteorite impact or burial in hot ejecta is suggested by the findings. According to three-stage U-Pb evolution model calculations, the source cumulates of the Luna 24 basalt evolved in a U-238/Pb-204 environment much lower than that of the Apollo mare basalts. A laterally heterogeneous lunar magma ocean, U-Pb fractionation during cumulate formation, and/or lack of KREEP addition to the Luna 24 basalt are also reflected in the calculations.|

S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||3243|The origin is considered of droplets of ultramafic composition which are present in all soils collected from the mare surface at the Apollo 17 landing site. The droplets consist of homogeneous orange glass or their partially crystallized equivalent, the black droplets. These clastic deposits have a mean grain size of 40 micrometers. The droplet formation ages range from 3.5 to 3.83 b.y. It has been proposed that the droplets formed as a spray of low viscosity melt during lava fountaining. Based upon the thermal history as determined by studying olivine and particle shapes, two models for the formation of the sequence of droplets represented by samples 74001 and 74220 are presented. Both models assume, as proposed by Heiken et al. (1974), that the droplets were formed as a spray from a lava fountain and the compound forms were evidence for 'recycling' of solid, cooler droplets back into the fountain, encountering molten droplets before being deposited.|

N.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||3685|Previous studies have shown that the bulk of the nitrogen in soils has been implanted by the solar wind, that the N-15/N-14 ratio of the implanted nitrogen has apparently increased with time, and that both soils and rocks contain a nitrogen component greatly enriched in N-15, relative to natural abundance ratios, due to cosmic-ray spallation. An investigation was, therefore, conducted to test the feasibility of using spallation-produced N-15 for determining cosmic-ray exposure ages. Samples from several depths in the Apollo 15 deep drill core were analyzed. The data obtained have also been evaluated with regard to possible models for the prior history of the material now in the Apollo 15 core. In addition, analyses have been performed of several other soil samples considered for various reasons to be of particular interest, such as orange soil 74220 and its companion 74240, Apollo 16 drill core sample 60002, and the apparently peculiar fillet soil 67461. Wherever possible, analyses were carried out by step-wise heating rather than by total pyrolysis. On the basis of the results of the investigation it is concluded that nitrogen isotope ratio determinations provide a usable method for determining cosmic-ray exposures for soils.|

It is proposed that in Apollo 17 mare and terra soils the fractions of Pb-204, Zn, and Tl that are insoluble under mild, hot pH 5 HNO3, leaching conditions and involatile at 600 C were originally surface deposits which became immobilized by migration into the silicate substrate or by chemisorption. Most of the Bi does not seem to be the result of such a deposit. The implication is also that the soils, over their respective times of evolution, were exposed to heavy metal vapors or that an episodic exposure occurred after they had evolved. A sequence of events is proposed to account for orange 74220 and black 74001 glasses by lava fountaining and for soil 74241 as tephra from an explosive volcanic eruption.|

In agreement with results for samples from other missions, both samples had low initial specific surface areas, consisted of nonporous particles, and were attacked by water vapor at high relative pressures to give an increased specific surface area and create a pore system which gave rise to a capillary condensation hysteresis loop in the adsorption isotherms. In contrast to previous samples, both of the Apollo 17 soils were partially hydrophobic in their initial interaction with water vapor (both samples were completely hydrophilic after the reaction with water). The results are consistent with formation at high temperatures without subsequent exposure to significant amounts of water.|

The use of inert gas sputtering to obtain thickness profiles of surface films is shown to be important in this type of investigation. Four anorthite grains from the Apollo 17 fines have been examined for evidence of vapor-deposited surface coatings of micrometeorite impact origin. The results indicate that the thickness of surface deposits, if they exist at all, are orders of magnitude less than expected.

The remaining 1 % is chiefly crystalline basalt fragments. Although the colour of the individual orange spherule varies with thickness from yellow-orange to red-brown, all orange glass in our sample (74220, 70; 0.25 g) has a uniform index of refraction (~ 1.712). By contrast, other lunar soils contain spherules ranging from 1.50 to 1.75. The orange glass is also completely free of bubbles, to the limit of resolution of the light microscope, whereas bubbles are present in many other spherule samples. The spherules generally appear spherical in a normal microscope mount, but when viewed from two directions many are found to be oblate spheroids with axial ratios varying from near 1.00 to as low as 0.42 (Fig. 1a). Some have fissioned during free flight<SUP>1</SUP> and all stages of the fission process are found, as described for the Apollo 11 samples. Only a few spherules seem to have been distorted by landing while still soft.
