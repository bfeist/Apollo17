2017E&PSL.478..214N|2017|Volatile loss during homogenization of lunar melt inclusions|Ni, Peng, Zhang, Youxue, Guan, Yunbin|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|478||214|Volatile abundances in lunar mantle are critical factors to consider for constraining the model of Moon formation. Recently, the earlier understanding of a ;dry; Moon has shifted to a fairly ;wet; Moon due to the detection of measurable amount of H<SUB>2</SUB>O in lunar volcanic glass beads, mineral grains, and olivine-hosted melt inclusions. The ongoing debate on a ;dry; or ;wet; Moon requires further studies on lunar melt inclusions to obtain a broader understanding of volatile abundances in the lunar mantle. One important uncertainty for lunar melt inclusion studies, however, is whether the homogenization of melt inclusions would cause volatile loss. In this study, a series of homogenization experiments were conducted on olivine-hosted melt inclusions from the sample 74220 to evaluate the possible loss of volatiles during homogenization of lunar melt inclusions. Our results suggest that significant loss of H<SUB>2</SUB>O could occur even during minutes of homogenization, while F, Cl and S in the inclusions remain unaffected. We model the trend of H<SUB>2</SUB>O loss in homogenized melt inclusions by a diffusive hydrogen loss model. The model can reconcile the observed experimental data well, with a best-fit H diffusivity in accordance with diffusion data explained by the ;slow; mechanism for hydrogen diffusion in olivine. Surprisingly, no significant effect for the low oxygen fugacity on the Moon is observed on the diffusive loss of hydrogen during homogenization of lunar melt inclusions under reducing conditions. Our experimental and modeling results show that diffusive H loss is negligible for melt inclusions of >25 μm radius. As our results mitigate the concern of H<SUB>2</SUB>O loss during homogenization for crystalline lunar melt inclusions, we found that H<SUB>2</SUB>O/Ce ratios in melt inclusions from different lunar samples vary with degree of crystallization. Such a variation is more likely due to H<SUB>2</SUB>O loss on the lunar surface, while heterogeneity in their lunar mantle source is also a possibility. A similar size-dependence trend of H<SUB>2</SUB>O concentrations was also observed in natural unheated melt inclusions in 74220. By comparing the trend of diffusive H loss in the natural MIs and in our homogenized MIs, the cooling rate for 74220 was estimated to be ∼1 °C/s or slower.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2017.09.010

The picritic glasses were collected from the lunar surface during the Apollo missions, and they are hypothesized to have rapidly quenched as glass beads during pyroclastic fire fountain eruptions. The specific melt compositions investigated in the present study are the Apollo 15 green glass Type C (A15C, TiO<SUB>2</SUB> = 0.26 wt%), the Apollo 14 yellow glass (A14Y, TiO<SUB>2</SUB> = 4.58 wt%), the Apollo 17 orange glass 74220-type (A17O TiO<SUB>2</SUB> = 9.12 wt%), and the Apollo 14 black glass (A14B, TiO<SUB>2</SUB> = 16.40 wt%). These glasses are reported to represent primary unfractionated melts, making them a prime candidate for experimental studies into lunar basalt density and compressibility during partial melting of the lunar mantle. Sink-float experiments were conducted on the synthetic molten lunar glass compositions using a piston-cylinder apparatus (P < 2 GPa) and a Walker-style multi-anvil device (P > 2.5 GPa) in order to bracket the density of the melts. New sink-float data are reported for A15C, A14Y, and A17O, which are combined with previously published density and compressibility data on A15C, A17O, and A14B. Although the Ti-rich liquids are highly compressible at lower pressures, they become nearly incompressible at much higher pressures when compared to the molten low-Ti glasses. Consequently, the melts with the most TiO<SUB>2</SUB> (A14B) are the least dense at higher pressures, a reversal of what is seen at lower pressures. This change in density and compressibility is attributed to changes in coordination of Ti and Fe in the silicate melt structure. As Ti<SUP>4+</SUP> abundances in the silicate melt increase, predominantly <SUP>[IV]</SUP>Ti<SUP>4+</SUP> and <SUP>[IV]</SUP>Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> change to <SUP>[VI]</SUP>Ti<SUP>4+</SUP> and <SUP>[VI]</SUP>Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> in the melt structure. All of the data from the present study were used to calculate a Birch-Murnaghan equation-of-state (BM-EOS) for each melt composition. The BM-EOS model for each composition was then combined with previously published estimates for the residual mantle source mineralogy and depth of origin for each of the glasses to assess the density of the partial melt with respect to its point of origin. This information was used to determine whether or not the melt would rise or sink with respect to its source region. We determined that all melt compositions, with the exception of the A17O melt, should have been able to rise to the crust-mantle boundary as a result of buoyancy forces alone, although different mechanisms are likely required for magma ascent through the lunar crust. For the rise of A17O, other modes of ascent through the lunar mantle are required to extract this melt composition from the mantle, and volatiles are not a plausible solution on the grounds of melt density alone.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2014.10.029

J., Mahadevan, S., Rutherford, M. J.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||P12B|The oxidation state of igneous materials on a planet is a critically-important variable in understanding magma evolution on bodies in our solar system. However, direct and indirect methods for quantifying redox states are challenging, especially across the broad spectrum of silicate glass compositions found on airless bodies. On the Moon, early Mössbauer studies of bulk samples suggested the presence of significant Fe3+ (>10%) in lunar glasses (green, orange, brown); lunar analog glasses synthesized at fO2 <10-11 have similar Fe3+. All these Mössbauer spectra are challenging to interpret due to the presence of multiple coordination environments in the glasses. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) allows pico- and nano-scale interrogation of primitive planetary materials using the pre-edge, main edge, and EXAFS regions of absorption edge spectra. Current uses of XAS require availability of standards with compositions similar to those of unknowns and complex procedures for curve-fitting of pre-edge features that produce results with poorly constrained accuracy. A new approach to accurate and quantitative redox measurements with XAS is to couple use of spectra from synthetic glass standards covering a broad compositional range with multivariate analysis (MVA) techniques. Mössbauer and XAS spectra from a suite of 33 synthetic glass standards covering a wide range of compositions and fO2(Dyar et al., this meeting) were used to develop a MVA model that utilizes valuable predictive information not only in the major spectral peaks/features, but in all channels of the XAS region. Algorithms for multivariate analysis t were used to "learn" the characteristics of a data set as a function of varying spectral characteristics. These models were applied to the study of lunar glasses, which provide a challenging test case for these newly-developed techniques due to their very low fO2. Application of the new XAS calibration model to Apollo 15 green (15426, 15427 and 15425), Apollo 17 orange (74220 ), and other lunar glasses confirms the Fe3+ contents from Mössbauer and shows that higher-Si glasses tend to have slightly elevated Fe3+.|

[1977]. Proc. Lunar Sci. Conf. 8, 3357-3374). While metal rapidly segregates out of the melt and sinks into the core, the vaporized material orbits the Earth and eventually rains back onto its surface. The content of the mantle in siderophile elements and their chondritic relative abundances hence is accounted for, not by the impactors themselves, as in the original late-veneer model (Chou, C.L. [1978]. Proc. Lunar Sci. Conf. 9, 219-230; Morgan, J.W. et al. [1981]. Tectonophysics 75, 47-67), but by the vapor resulting from impacts. The impactor's non-siderophile volatiles, notably hydrogen, are added to the mantle and hydrosphere. The addition of late veneer may have lasted for 130 Ma after isolation of the Solar System and probably longer, i.e., well beyond the giant lunar impact. Constraints from the stable isotopes of oxygen and other elements suggest that, contrary to evidence from highly siderophile elements, ̃4% of CI chondrites accreted to the Earth. The amount of water added in this way during the waning stages of accretion, and now dissolved in the deep mantle or used to oxidize Fe in the mantle and the core, may correspond to 10-25 times the mass of the present-day ocean. The Moon is at least 100 times more depleted than the Earth in volatile elements with the exception of some isolated domains, such as the mantle source of 74220 pyroclastic glasses, which appear to contain significantly higher concentrations of water and other volatiles.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2012.10.026

In the lunar pressure range, two experiments containing pure forsterite (Fo <SUB>100</SUB>) spheres at 1.0 GPa and 1727 K, and at 1.3 GPa-1739 K, showed neutral buoyancies, indicating that the density of molten orange glass was equal to the density of Fo <SUB>100</SUB> at these conditions (3.09 ± 0.02 g cm <SUP>-3</SUP>). A third tight sink/float bracket using Fo <SUB>90</SUB> spheres corresponds to a melt density of 3.25 ± 0.02 g cm <SUP>-3</SUP> at ̃2.8 GPa and ̃1838 K. Our data predict a density crossover for the molten orange glass composition with equilibrium orthopyroxene at ̃2.8 GPa, equivalent to a depth of ̃600 km in the lunar mantle, and a density of ̃3.25 g cm <SUP>-3</SUP>. This crossover depth is close to the orange glass multiple saturation point, representing its minimum formation depth, at the appropriate oxygen fugacity (2.8-2.9 GPa). A density crossover with equilibrium olivine is predicted to fall outside the lunar pressure range (>4.7 GPa), indicating that molten orange glass is always less dense than its equilibrium olivines in the Moon. Our data therefore suggest that that lunar liquids with orange glass composition are buoyant with respect to their source region at P < ̃2.8 GPa, enabling their initial rise to the surface without the need for additional external driving forces. Fitting the density data to a Birch-Murnaghan equation of state at 2173 K leads to an array of acceptable solutions ranging between 16.1 and 20.3 GPa for the isothermal bulk modulus K<SUB>2173</SUB> and 3.6-8 for its pressure derivative K', with best-fit values K<SUB>2173</SUB> = 18.8 GPa and K' = 4.4 when assuming a model 1 bar density value of 2.86 g cm <SUP>-3</SUP>. When assuming a slightly lower 1 bar density value of 2.84 g cm <SUP>-3</SUP> we find a range for K<SUB>2173</SUB> of 14.4-18.0 and K' 3.7-8.7, with best-fit values of 17.2 GPa and 4.5, respectively.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2010.11.022

E., Agee, C. B., McCubbin, F. M.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||MR21A|This study focuses on the density and compressibility of three lunar glass compositions encountered during the Apollo missions to the Moon. These glasses are hypothesized to have rapidly quenched as glass beads during lunar fire fountain eruptions. The lunar glass beads have distinctive colors that correspond to TiO<SUB>2</SUB> content. The glasses of interest for this study are the Apollo 15 green glass Type C (A15C) which has a low TiO<SUB>2</SUB> content of only 0.26 wt%, the Apollo 17 orange glass (74220-type), which has a moderately high TiO<SUB>2</SUB> content of 9.12 wt%, and the Apollo 14 black glass which has the highest TiO<SUB>2</SUB> content with 16.40 wt%. These glasses represent primary, unfractionated melts making them a prime candidate for experimental studies into lunar basalt density and eruptability during partial melting of the lunar mantle. Sink/float experiments were performed on both A15C and the A17 74220-type, and previously published data from the A14 black glass were used. Experiments were performed in both a piston cylinder apparatus for pressures up to 2.5 GPa and a Walker-style multi-anvil device for pressures greater than 2.5 GPa. Thus far we have estimated the density and compressibility of the orange glass successfully up to 8 GPa with future experiments planned for 10 GPa. Although these pressures exceed that of the lunar interior (~4.7 GPa), higher experimental pressures are important for determination of melt bulk modulus and identification of such factors as compositional effects on melt compressibility. Experiments have also been run on A15C for pressures relevant to the lunar interior. Our sink/float observations at 8 GPa confirm that the orange glass density curve can be approximated by a straight line at liquidus temperatures, while the black glass shows a strong decrease in slope with pressure, especially above 3 GPa. The different slopes between these two glasses creates a density crossover at approximately 6 GPa. SiO<SUB>2</SUB>, TiO<SUB>2</SUB>, and FeO are the largest compositional differences between the volcanic glasses investigated; however Ti<SUP>4+</SUP> has the ability to exist in the silicate melt both as a network former and a network modifier (whereas Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> is typically a network modifier and Si<SUP>4+</SUP> is typically a network former under the experimental conditions we investigate). Certainly, the pronounced flattening of the molten black glass compression curve at pressures above 3 GPa may be reflecting the completion of the coordination change to 6-fold in a large number of Ti-sites. If so, then one would expect to see a compressibility decrease as melt density experiences little or no boost from coordination change with higher compressions as we see in our orange glass results. Therefore, Ti<SUP>4+</SUP> has the greatest potential to be the primary driving force behind the differences in compressibility and density observed in this and previous studies of the lunar picritic glasses.|

A.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|73|19|5884|We used ICP-MS to measure the elemental concentrations and isotopic abundances of Cu and Zn in: nine Ti-rich lunar basalts (10017, 10022, 10024, 10057, 70215, 71055, 74255, 75055, and 75075); size-separated samples prepared by sieving of pyroclastic black glass 74001, orange glass 74022, and the lunar soils 15021, 15231, 70181, and 79221; a basalt from the Piton des Neiges volcano, Reunion Island; two samples of Pele's hairs from the Nyiragongo volcano, Democratic Republic of Congo, and the martian meteorite Zagami. The isotopic fractionation of zinc in lunar basalts and Zagami is mass dependent relative to a terrestrial standard (JMC 400882B). These and published results imply that lunar, terrestrial, meteoritic, and perhaps martian zinc all come from one or more reservoirs linked by mass-dependent fractionation processes. Relative to terrestrial basalts, Ti-rich lunar basalts are enriched in the heavier isotopes of Cu and Zn: we find for Ti-rich lunar basalts the following ranges and averages ±1 - σ (‰): δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu/ <SUP>63</SUP>Cu ≡ δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu, 0.1-1.4, 0.5 ± 0.1‰ ( N = 7); δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn/ <SUP>64</SUP>Zn ≡ δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn = 0.2-1.9, 1.2 ± 0.2‰ ( N = 8; 10017 excluded). For two terrestrial samples, we find δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn ̃ +0.3‰ and δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu ̃ 0‰, which are consistent with published values. The differences between the lunar basalts and terrestrial basalts could reflect minor, planetary-scale vaporization or igneous processes on the Moon. Data for size separates of the pyroclastic glasses 74001 and 74220 confirm the well-known surface correlation of Cu and Zn, but modeling calculations reveal no sharp differences between either the elemental ratios or the isotopic composition of grain interiors and exteriors. The absence of such differences indicates that the isotopic compositions for bulk samples are dominated by a light-isotope-rich surface component. Data for size separates of lunar soils also confirm the surface correlation of Cu and Zn, but an enrichment of heavy rather than light isotopes. Averages for bulk lunar soils from this work and the literature are (‰): δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu, from 1.4 to 4.1, average 3.0 ± 0.3 ( N = 9); δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn, from 2.2 to 6.4, average 4.0 ± 0.3 ( N = 14). As with the glasses, in all but soil 15231 our data show no strong differences between the isotopic composition of soil sub-samples with small and large grains. The size of the isotopic fractionation inferred for the surface component in the soils is 3× smaller than predicted by a published model of sputtering primarily by solar particles. At the same time, the observed fractionation is larger than predicted by calculations based on a model of micrometeorite impact heating and hydrodynamic quenching. Because impact heating appears unable to explain the observations, we conclude that sputtering must be important even though samples with very large isotopic fractionation of Cu and Zn have not yet been found.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2009.05.067

F.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|70|24|6103|We determined by ICP-MS the concentrations and isotopic ratios of Fe, Cu, and Zn in the Ti-rich lunar basalt 74275, in the lunar orange glass 74220, and in up to 10 lunar soils, namely, 14163, 15231, 64501, 66041, 68841, 69941, 70011, 72501, 75081, and 76501. Two analyses of zinc in lunar basalt 74275 give δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn = 0.17‰ and 0.75‰, values within the range of those measured in terrestrial basalts; copper in lunar basalt 74275 has δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu ̃ +1.4‰, which is isotopically heavier than values observed in terrestrial basalts. In the orange glass, we measured δ <SUP>56</SUP>Fe = -0.24‰, δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu = -0.42‰, and δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn ̃ -3.6‰. These values of δ are more negative than those obtained for 74275 and for typical lunar basalts, but for Cu, comparable to those observed in terrestrial sulfides and meteorites. In lunar soils we found 0.11‰ ⩽ δ <SUP>56</SUP>Fe ⩽ 0.51‰, 2.6‰ ⩽ δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu ⩽ 4.5‰, and 2.2‰ ⩽ δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn ⩽ 6.4‰. Insofar as we can generalize from a small sample set, S, Fe, Cu, Zn, and Cd show similar trends in isotopic fractionation on the Moon. Lunar basalts have nearly terrestrial isotopic ratios. Relative to the lunar basalt 74275, the pyroclastic glass 74220 is enriched in the lighter isotopes of Fe, Cu, and Zn, and the soils are enriched in the heavier isotopes of Fe, Cu, and Zn. The patterns in the basalts are likely inherited from the source material; the light-isotope enrichments seen in the orange glass originated during lava fountaining or, less probably, during partial condensation of vapor; and the heavy-isotope enrichments in the lunar soils were likely created by a combination of processes that included micrometeorite vaporization and sputtering. In the orange glass, the light-isotope enrichments (relative to lunar basalts) of Zn are larger than those of Cu. If these enrichments reflect accurately the isotopic composition of the gas, they suggest that Cu is more volatile than Zn in the liquid from which the gas derived. A simple model built on the known flux of micrometeorites to the lunar surface and a published estimate that micrometeorites generate 10 times their own mass of vapor, predicts heavy-isotope enrichments comparable to those observed in soils but only if the regolith gardening rate is set at about one twentieth of the generally accepted value of 1 cm/My. This discrepancy may reflect the difference in the time constants for micrometeorite milling and decimeter-scale gardening, or the importance of sputtering.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2006.02.030

J.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|224|3-4|399|Abundances of the highly siderophile elements (HSE) Re, Ir, Os, Ru, Pt and Pd were determined for etchates and residues of highly purified lunar orange (74220 and 74001,1217 and 1218) and green (15421,65 and 15426,164) volcanic glasses. Most etchates have >100 pg/g Os and Ir, and in some instances have HSE concentrations that approach chondritic relative abundances. Some etchates also have <SUP>187</SUP>Os/ <SUP>188</SUP>Os within the range of chondritic meteorites. In contrast, most residues have Os concentrations of <50 pg/g and have considerably suprachondritic <SUP>187</SUP>Os/ <SUP>188</SUP>Os ratios. The disparities in Os isotopic compositions between etchates and residues reflect the presence of at least two components in each of the glass fractions. The components are interpreted to be the indigenous lunar glasses and a meteoritic contaminant. Mixing models suggest the indigenous components in orange and green glasses have Os concentrations ≤25 pg/g. Compared to terrestrial rocks with comparable MgO contents, the concentration estimates suggest the lunar mantle sources of the volcanic glasses were depleted in HSE by at least a factor of 20 relative to the terrestrial mantle, consistent with Os and Ir concentrations in the lunar mantle of ≤0.15 ng/g. The HSE depletion in the lunar mantle indicates that it may be missing a substantial share of late accreted materials. The depletion is best explained as a consequence of the early formation of the lunar crust and subsequent isolation of the lunar mantle from late accreted materials. Given that the lunar crust was largely formed by 4.4 Ga, this suggests a preponderance of late accreted materials were added to the Earth-Moon system subsequent to 4.4 Ga, and requires a substantial influx of mass into the inner solar system more than 150 Ma after the formation of the solar system.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2004.05.036

1999nvm..conf....1A|1999|Prospecting for Lunar Resources with Global Geochemical and Multispectral Data|Allen, C. C.|New Views of the Moon 2: Understanding the Moon Through the Integration of Diverse Datasets|||1|Laboratory experiments have demonstrated correlations between the abundances of some lunar resources and specific chemical and mineralogical parameters of surface materials. Global remote sensing from the Apollo, Galileo, Clementine, and Lunar Prospector missions, combined with Earth-based observations, has now quantified these parameters. Combining experiments and remote sensing allows the first prospecting for resources across the entire lunar surface. The Moon's rocks and soil contain resources that could be used to support a future lunar base for research or for launching expeditions into deep space. Lunar O is the resource most likely to be exploited first, for both propulsion and life support. The efficiency of O extraction from lunar materials has been shown to depend strongly on the material's chemical and mineralogical composition.Some lunar materials may be rare and vital enough on Earth to justify the cost of their return. The rare isotope He-3, which can be used in an efficient and low-polluting fusion power reaction, has been cited as one such resource. Over 20 different processes have been proposed for O production on the Moon. Among the simplest and best studied of these processes is the reduction of oxides in lunar minerals and glass using H gas. It was reported that the results of O extraction experiments on 16 lunar soils. Each sample was reacted in flowing H for 3 h at 1050 C. Total O yield correlated strongly to each sample's initial Fe2+ abundance. A linear least-squares fit of O yield vs. Fe2+ for 16 lunar soils yielded a regression line with a slope of 0.19, an intercept of 0.55 wt% O and an r-square value of 0.87. Oxygen yield did not significantly correlate with the abundance of any element except Fe. Thus, O yield from lunar soils can be predicted with nearly 90% confidence based solely on their iron abundances. The potential for O production at any location on the Moon can be predicted if the soil's Fe concentration is known. On a global scale, Fe concentration in the near surface has been estimated from data returned by a variety of spacecraft. Iron was one of several elements measured from near equatorial orbits during the Apollo 15 and 16 missions, using gamma ray spectrometry. These data covered approximately 20% of the lunar surface, with spatial resolutions of about 100 km. An improved gamma ray spectrometer and a neutron spectrometer, flown on the Lunar Prospector spacecraft in a polar orbit, provided Fe abundance data for the entire lunar surface, again at a spatial resolution of about 100 km. A technique for iron assessment based on orbital multispectral imaging has been developed. This method correlates Fe abundance to a parameter derived from reflectance values at 750 and900nm. The authors use data from the Clementine spacecraft to map Fe abundances across nearly the entire lunar surface. These data can support identification of Fe-rich regions as small as a few hundred meters across. Researchers find good agreement between gamma-ray/neutron and multispectral Fe determinations for most areas on the Moon. The H-reduction experiments cited above also showed submillimeter volcanic glass beads could be highly desirable feedstocks for lunar O production. Iron-rich species, represented by glassy (orange) and crystalline (black) beads, promise particularly high O yields. Apollo 17 volcanic glass sample 74220, composed predominantly of orange glass beads with an average diameter of 40 mm, contains 17.8 wt% Fe2+. Reduction of this sample yielded 4.3 wt% O, well above the regression line defined by the experiments on 16 lunar soils. Sample 74001 is dominated by black crystalline beads, the isochemical equivalent of orange glasses. Reduction of 74001 yielded 4.7 wt% O, the highest value for any lunar sample. Extensive areas of the lunar surface covered by volcanic glass beads have been delineated using Earth based data and spacecraft orbital photography. Chemical compositions of the deposits have been estimated and mixing ratios of glassy and crystalline glass beads have been determined. Clementine multispectral imagery has been employed to determine the precise extent and estimate the thickness of one widespread deposit, that of the Aristarchus Plateau. Lunar ice could prove to be a highly advantageous O source, compared to O derived from soil reduction, in terms of process complexity and power requirements. Thus, a deposit of ice on the Moon is a potentially important resource.Permanently shadowed polar craters have been modeled as possible cold traps for water ice, derived either from indigenous sources or from comets. Any lunar ice deposits must occur in extremely restricted areas near the poles. Only crater interiors that are permanently shadowed from sunlight are cold enough to have retained volatiles for a significant part of the Moon's history. Clementine images and Earth-based radar have demonstrated that craters whose interiors are never exposed to sunlight do exist near the lunar poles. Water ice has been tentatively identified in some of these craters using Clementine bi-static radar data. Lunar Prospector mapped the epithermal and fast-neutron fluxes across the entire Moon. Low epithermal fluxes are correlated with concentrations of H, and by extension ice, in the near-surface. Such signatures were observed near permanently-shadowed craters at both lunar poles. Calculation of the actual amount of water ice in these cold traps is strongly model-dependent but each polar region could contain as much as 3x10<SUP>9</SUP> t of water ice. The concentration of solar wind-implanted He in mare regolith increases with the soil's Ti content. This correlation is apparently due to preferential adsorption of He by ilmenite grains. Thus, Ti in mare soils is a predictor of the He-3 resource. Additional information is contained in the original.|

R.|New Views of the Moon 2: Understanding the Moon Through the Integration of Diverse Datasets|||12|Lunar pyroclastic deposits represent a style of volcanism different from that responsible for the flood basalts that fill the mare basins. As volatile-coated, primitive materials originating deep (about 400 km) within the Moon, these products of explosive volcanic eruptions are also important as probes of mantle composition and as a potential resource for future settlers. While many of the lunar pyroclastic deposits are spatially restricted and relatively small in size, they are easily resolvable at the spatial scale (about 100 m/pixel) of the Clementine UV-VIS camera. Recent studies confirm previous results indicating that these deposits are not compositionally uniform, and suggest that further analyses can help to identify possible genetic relationships among lunar pyroclastic deposits, characterize their juvenile components, and clarify their relationships to nearby maria. Among the juvenile materials from sampled lunar pyroclastic deposits are the orange glass and devitrified black beads found in the Taurus-Littrow Valley and the green glass found by Apollo 15. Recent studies suggest that deposits dominated by materials such as these may represent end members in the observed compositional variations among the lunar pyroclastic deposits. Here we present preliminary results of analyses focused on the use of the Clementine UV-VIS data for characterizing the composition and distribution of juvenile pyroclastic materials. Our test case for detailed mapping of a lunar pyroclastic deposit is that of the Apollo 17 landing site in the Taurus-Littrow (TL) Valley. Although black beads dominate the observed spectral reflectance at this site, sample data show that the pyroclastic eruption changed character, producing first orange glass and then black beads. To assess the compositional variability of this deposit, especially our ability to distinguish the orange glasses, we apply techniques based on spectral mixture analysis to detect materials at subpixel scales. The low albedo and subdued absorption features of the Taurus-Littrow deposit make this a challenging task. In recent years, several subpixel detection techniques have been developed for use with terrestrial airborne imaging spectrometer data. A technique that is functionally equivalent to spectral mixture analysis, the orthogonal subspace projection (OSP) technique is used for the simulations presented here. In OSP, a target spectrum is projected onto a subspace that is orthogonal to a set of background spectra. In this process, the response from the background spectra are nulled and that of the target is maximized. For the TL site, the spectra used for the simulation included three laboratory-measured sample spectra convolved to the five UV/VIS bandpasses, and two spectra extracted from UV-VIS data over the TL Valley. The target spectrum was the orange soil sample 74220 from the Shorty Crater rim. "Background" spectra were from samples 74221 (a gray soil found near the orange soil) and 75111 (a dark mare soil). From the UV/VIS data, additional background spectra were obtained at the mare/highland interface and from the "crater cluster" area in the TL Valley. In the simulation, the background spectra were randomly mixed in each of 100 samples with 0.1% Gaussian noise added. For samples 20,40, 60, and 80, the orange soil target was added in abundances of 90, 80, 60, and 40%. The 100-sample set was then reduced via OSP. For this example, the orange soil was detectable only at the 90 and 80% abundance levels. It was found that the addition of higher noise levels (about 1%), made the orange glass undetectable even at the 90% level. However, using background materials more representative of the highlands made the orange soil detectable at lower abundances. These results suggest that we should be able to map the distribution of juvenile pyroclastic materials, such as the orange glasses, using the Clementine UV-VIS data and subpixel analysis techniques such as spectral mixture analysis and foreground background analysis. Given the low albedo of these materials, a high fill factor will be required on a per pixel basis in order to achieve that mapping; however, observations made by others, including orbital observations by the Apollo 17 astronauts, have indicated that these abundances are met for several pyroclastic deposits. The production of such maps will help to constrain the dynamics of pyroclastic eruptions on the Moon by providing information on die type, relative quantity, and distribution of juvenile volcanic materials.

As a continuation of previous work, additional analyses of high-Ti, volcanic glass spherules handpicked from soil sample 74220,680 have been made by electron microprobe in order to acquire more information about processes associated with melt generation and melt eruption on the Moon. The present work has developed microprobe procedures for making high-precision analyses of the major- (Si, Ti, Al, Fe, Mg, Ca) and minor- (Cr, Mn) elements. The JEOL 733 electron microprobe was operated at a 15-keV accelerating potential with a counting time of 300-seconds per element per analysis at a beam current of 75 nanoamps.

S.|Journal of Geophysical Research|100|E7|14391|Efficient lunar resource utilization requires accurate and quantitative evaluation of mineral and glass abundances, distribution, and extraction feasibility, especially for ilmenite. With this in mind, true modal analyses were performed on high-Ti mare basalts and soils with X ray/backscattered electron signal digital-imaging techniques, and these data indicate that (1) ilmenite concentrations are similar for basalts and immature-submature soils with similar TiO<SUB>2</SUB> content; (2) ilmenite liberation of crushed mare basalts and immature-submature mare soils are comparable (i.e., both contain similar amounts of free ilmenite); and (3) because of impact melting and agglutination of primary minerals, mature mare soils contain less ilmenite (both free and attached). Modal analyses of magnetic separates of high-Ti mare basalts and soils show that (1) ilmenite was concentrated by a factor of >=3.3 and (2) soil ilmenite was concentrated to factors of 1.7-2.3. The lower soil ilmenite separation efficiency is attributed to Fe°-bearing agglutinitic glass and amorphous rinds adhered to soil particles. Mass yields of magnetically generated feedstocks were generally less than 5 wt.% in most cases. Calculation of oxygen yield (as released by hydrogen gas reduction of ilmenite) show that (1) beneficiated basalt will provide the most oxygen (8-10%), because of higher ilmenite concentration; (2) reduction of raw immature-submature mare soils and basalts will produce similar amounts of lunar liquid oxygen (LLOX) (2.1-3.1%) and (3) raw Fe-rich pyroclastic soil, 74220, will provide more oxygen (5.4%) than beneficiated high-Ti mare soils and half that of beneficiated high-Ti mare basalts. High-Ti mare soils are attractive resources for lunar liquid oxygen (LLOX) production because of their unconsolidated nature, high ilmenite abundance, and widespread occurrence. Energy-intensive excavation and comminution likely prohibits the basalt mining during early lunar occupation. Orange soils are important resources for LLOX and various volatile elements, but slower reaction kinetics and glass sintering pose potential difficulties for large-scale operations.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/95JE00503

Of these 40 samples, 31 are indeed regolith breccias. Regolith breccias from Apollo 14 exhibit much greater compositional diversity than their soil (sensu stricto) counterparts: 14004,55 displays incompatible element concentrations about 1.4× those found in typical Apollo 14 regolith, while 14315 is radically different in many respects (higher Al, lower Mg and Fe, lower incompatible elements) from all other Apollo 14 regolith materials, and hence probably exotic to the Apollo 14 traverse area. Application of “mixing” models to Apollo 14 regolith materials suggests that whereas “normal” Apollo 14 regolith contains only slightly more ferroan anorthosite (FA) than alkali anorthosite (AA) and far more KREEP than FA and AA combined, 14315 contains more FA than KREEP and roughly 10 times more FA than AA. Three “new” regolith breccias from Apollo 16 bring to 20 the total number of regolith breccias that have been analyzed for Mg and Fe from the site. The molar Mg/(Mg + Fe) (or mg<SUP>*</SUP>) ratios of lunar regolith breccias are of great interest, because lunar-meteorite ALHA81005 has a much higher mg<SUP>*</SUP> than two other lunar-meteoritic regolith breccias (Y791197 and Y82192/3), even though these three samples are remarkably similar in all other compositional respects.

In addition, in 74001 (predominantly black glass), moderately volatile elements (Ag, Zn) are more abundant than In, Cd, and particularly Bi, while in 74220 (mainly orange glass), Ag, Zn, In, and Cd are almost equally abundant, but Bi is as low as in 74001.|

C.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2345|Ar-40-Ar-39 age measurements on single orange glass balls from the Apollo 17 soil 74220 and individual clasts from the Apollo 17 highland breccia 72435 are reported. The measurements required the use of newly established microanalytical techniques to obtain high quality analyses on about 0.5 mg particles with only a few hundred ppm K. An age of 3.60 plus or minus 0.04 b.y. is determined for the orange glass. No corrections for a trapped Ar-40 component were required. The glass forming event occurred at the very end of or after the extrusion of the mare basalts at the Apollo 17 site. An extremely well defined age plateau at 3.86 plus or minus 0.04 b.y. was determined for a 72435 plagioclase clast with attached matrix. A second large plagioclase crystal yielded significantly older ages over the last 60% of Ar release at high temperatures and is a relict clast incompletely degassed at the time of breccia formation. 72435 also contains plagioclase clasts with primitive Sr and a 4.55 AE old dunite clast. The Ar results provide additional evidence for the association of chemically unequilibrated, relict clasts with both primitive Sr and older K/Ar ages.|

The study of the cosmic-ray-produced isotopes He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe in the basaltic rocks 74235, 74255, and 74275, in bulk soil samples from the orange soil 74220, from the gray soils 74241 and 74261, and from the black soil 74001, and in grain size separates from the black soil allows the determination of the cosmic-ray exposure history of these samples. All three rocks experienced at least a two-stage exposure as can be judged from the comparison of their irradiation geometry at the time of collection with that inferred from depth-dependent relative abundances of cosmic-ray-produced nuclei. The exposure histories of the rocks and soils are characterized by four events or periods. These results show that the Shorty impact occurred no more than 30 m.y. ago. The most probable age of this crater is 19 m.y., when the large boulder was excavated from the subfloor. The trapped solar-wind concentration in the black soil is extremely low, on the average only 0.3% of that usually found for lunar soil.|

S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||3243|The origin is considered of droplets of ultramafic composition which are present in all soils collected from the mare surface at the Apollo 17 landing site. The droplets consist of homogeneous orange glass or their partially crystallized equivalent, the black droplets. These clastic deposits have a mean grain size of 40 micrometers. The droplet formation ages range from 3.5 to 3.83 b.y. It has been proposed that the droplets formed as a spray of low viscosity melt during lava fountaining. Based upon the thermal history as determined by studying olivine and particle shapes, two models for the formation of the sequence of droplets represented by samples 74001 and 74220 are presented. Both models assume, as proposed by Heiken et al. (1974), that the droplets were formed as a spray from a lava fountain and the compound forms were evidence for 'recycling' of solid, cooler droplets back into the fountain, encountering molten droplets before being deposited.|

O., Jr., Jovanovic, S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||3917|Parallel leaching and volatilization experiments conducted on lunar samples and similar experiments on sphalerite do not supply the information needed to resolve the question of the chemical nature of Pb-204, Zn, Bi, and Tl deposits on lunar soil surfaces. It is proposed that in Apollo 17 mare and terra soils the fractions of Pb-204, Zn, and Tl that are insoluble under mild, hot pH 5 HNO3, leaching conditions and involatile at 600 C were originally surface deposits which became immobilized by migration into the silicate substrate or by chemisorption. Most of the Bi does not seem to be the result of such a deposit. The implication is also that the soils, over their respective times of evolution, were exposed to heavy metal vapors or that an episodic exposure occurred after they had evolved. A sequence of events is proposed to account for orange 74220 and black 74001 glasses by lava fountaining and for soil 74241 as tephra from an explosive volcanic eruption.|

N.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||3685|Previous studies have shown that the bulk of the nitrogen in soils has been implanted by the solar wind, that the N-15/N-14 ratio of the implanted nitrogen has apparently increased with time, and that both soils and rocks contain a nitrogen component greatly enriched in N-15, relative to natural abundance ratios, due to cosmic-ray spallation. An investigation was, therefore, conducted to test the feasibility of using spallation-produced N-15 for determining cosmic-ray exposure ages. Samples from several depths in the Apollo 15 deep drill core were analyzed. The data obtained have also been evaluated with regard to possible models for the prior history of the material now in the Apollo 15 core. In addition, analyses have been performed of several other soil samples considered for various reasons to be of particular interest, such as orange soil 74220 and its companion 74240, Apollo 16 drill core sample 60002, and the apparently peculiar fillet soil 67461. Wherever possible, analyses were carried out by step-wise heating rather than by total pyrolysis. On the basis of the results of the investigation it is concluded that nitrogen isotope ratio determinations provide a usable method for determining cosmic-ray exposures for soils.|

Six elements - In, Cd, Zn, Ga, Ge, and Au - were strongly concentrated in the leach, indicating that they were present as a surface deposit, probably a sublimate resulting from condensation of lava-fountain volatiles which expelled the orange glass onto the lunar surface.|

Orange soil 74220, which is enriched in <SUP>204</SUP>Pb, Tl and Zn, is included in these relationships. In addition the submicron metallic phase generally associated with agglutinate formation is correlated with all three of these elements; this relationship has already been reported for <SUP>204</SUP>Pb in other samples. Thus, orange soil and agglutinates appear to be involved in concentrating heavy volatile metals. A process other than mixing is required to account for this. As a consequence of the isolation of the landing site by the surrounding massifs, local supply and recycling of volatile trace elements in soils may account for some of the interelement relations.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(75)90025-4

B.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||2275|The surface chemistry of Apollo 17 lunar fines samples 74220 (the orange soil) and 74241 (the gray control soil) has been studied by measuring the adsorption of nitrogen, argon, and oxygen (all at -196 C) and also water vapor (at 20 C or 22 C). In agreement with results for samples from other missions, both samples had low initial specific surface areas, consisted of nonporous particles, and were attacked by water vapor at high relative pressures to give an increased specific surface area and create a pore system which gave rise to a capillary condensation hysteresis loop in the adsorption isotherms. In contrast to previous samples, both of the Apollo 17 soils were partially hydrophobic in their initial interaction with water vapor (both samples were completely hydrophilic after the reaction with water). The results are consistent with formation at high temperatures without subsequent exposure to significant amounts of water.|

L.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||2423|Auger spectroscopy has been employed to study the surface composition of a number of grains from the submillimeter lunar fines. Some of the problems associated with using this technique for lunar sample analyses are discussed in terms of relevant physical principles. The use of inert gas sputtering to obtain thickness profiles of surface films is shown to be important in this type of investigation. Four anorthite grains from the Apollo 17 fines have been examined for evidence of vapor-deposited surface coatings of micrometeorite impact origin. The results indicate that the thickness of surface deposits, if they exist at all, are orders of magnitude less than expected. Auger analysis of orange glass balls form the 74220,107 fines have established sulfur-rich surface coatings on the order of 30 A in thickness.|

K.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||187|Scanning electron microprobe and nondispersive X-ray analysis have revealed small (less than 0.5 millimicrons in diameter) particles on an iron-rich phase imbedded in the surfaces of orange glass spheres selected from a soil sample collected at Shorty Crater during the Apollo 17 mission. The surface particles also contain significant amounts of chlorine and copper. In the Apollo 16 and 17 samples, iron chloride is related to significant oxyhydration. The glass spheres in sample 74220 are free of detectable quantities of metallic iron. Their magnetic properties (Curie point of magnetite) may originate in the surface particles.|
1973Natur.244..210R|1973|Apollo 17 ``Orange Soil'' and Meteorite Impact on Liquid Lava|Roedder, Edwin, Weiblen, Paul W.|Nature|244|5413|210|THE ``orange soil'' from Shorty Crater differs greatly from ordinary lunar soils in that it consists of ~99% 10-300 µm smooth shiny spherules and broken fragments of spherules of transparent orange glass, about 20% of which contain partly crystallized to opaque material. The remaining 1 % is chiefly crystalline basalt fragments. Although the colour of the individual orange spherule varies with thickness from yellow-orange to red-brown, all orange glass in our sample (74220, 70; 0.25 g) has a uniform index of refraction (~ 1.712). By contrast, other lunar soils contain spherules ranging from 1.50 to 1.75. The orange glass is also completely free of bubbles, to the limit of resolution of the light microscope, whereas bubbles are present in many other spherule samples. The spherules generally appear spherical in a normal microscope mount, but when viewed from two directions many are found to be oblate spheroids with axial ratios varying from near 1.00 to as low as 0.42 (Fig. 1a). Some have fissioned during free flight<SUP>1</SUP> and all stages of the fission process are found, as described for the Apollo 11 samples. Only a few spherules seem to have been distorted by landing while still soft. One notable exception is the occurrence of small spherules of orange glass conforming and adhering to the surface of larger black spherules (Fig. 1b).|http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/244210a0

The ilmenites, particularly in 74241, contain up to 7.8 wt.% MgO and display higher bireflectance than low-Mg ilmenites. They commonly contain exsolution-like chromite and rutile and occasionally are in association with native Fe in an assemblage probably resulting from reduction. The chromian ulvöspinels are similar to Apollo 11 spinels in that they contain near-equal amounts of chromite and ulvöspinel molecules. No primary chromites were observed. Most native Fe has No and Co contents of < 1 wt.%; some in 74220 contained 5-6% Ni and < 1% Co in association with schreibersite. All armalcolites examined are optically and chemically similar and the common mantling by Mg ilmenite leads us to conclude they are the ortho-armalcolite of S.E. Haggerty. We have collected optical (reflectivety and bireflectance) and microhardness data for the ilmenites, ulvöspinels and armalcolites. These are the first microhardness determinations for the last two minerals.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(73)90219-7
