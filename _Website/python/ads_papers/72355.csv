2014GeCoA.131...62S|2014|Characterization of the dominant impactor signature for Apollo 17 impact melt rocks|Sharp, Miriam, Gerasimenko, Iva, Loudin, Lorne C., Liu, Jingao, James, Odette B., Puchtel, Igor S., Walker, Richard J.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|131||62|Concentrations of the highly siderophile elements (HSE) Re, Os, Ir, Ru, Pt, and Pd and <SUP>187</SUP>Os/<SUP>188</SUP>Os isotopic compositions are reported for seven Apollo 17 impact melt rocks. These data are used to examine the dominant chemical signature of the impactor that formed the melts. Six of the samples (72355, 72435, 72535, 76035, 76055, and 76135) have poikilitic textures; one sample (73235) has an aphanitic texture. Data for the samples define linear correlations when Ir is plotted versus other HSE concentrations, with y-intercepts indistinguishable from zero for most HSE in most rocks. Scatter about some of the trends, and occasional trends with positive y-intercepts, indicate either mixing of additional components that are heterogeneously distributed within several rocks, or modest fractionation of some HSE by volatilization, crystal fractionation, or other processes, during formation and evolution of the melt sheet. There is no statistical difference between the aphanitic and poikilitic samples in terms of HSE ratios after visible granulitic clasts were removed from aphanite 73235. Hence, earlier speculations that the two types of impact melt rocks at this site may have been generated by different impactors are not supported by our data. Most Apollo 17 samples examined here and in prior studies are characterized by very similar HSE signatures, consistent with a common impactor. These samples are characterized by elevated Ru/Ir, Pd/Ir, and Re/Os, relative to most chondrites. Collectively, the data indicate that the impactor was characterized by the following HSE ratios (2σ): Re/Ir 0.093 ± 0.020, Os/Ir 1.03 ± 0.28, Ru/Ir 1.87 ± 0.30, Pt/Ir 2.36 ± 0.31, Pd/Ir 1.85 ± 0.41, and present-day <SUP>187</SUP>Os/<SUP>188</SUP>Os of 0.1322 ± 0.0013. The results most likely mean that the impactor was a body with a bulk composition that was just outside the range of meteoritic compositions currently sampled on Earth.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2014.01.014

A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2335|The paper presents petrographic and mineralogical data for five samples from Boulder 2 (72315, 72335, 72355, 72375, and 72395) and sample 72435 from Boulder 3 at Apollo 17 Station 2. All the samples were found to consist of a few percent megaclasts set in a fine-grained matrix, which is comprised of microclasts and a poikilitic to subophitic-textured groundmass that crystallized from a melt. The samples have similar modal mineralogies, mineral compositions, and bulk-chemical compositions.|
