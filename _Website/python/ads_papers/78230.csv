J., Keil, K., Clayton, R. N., Mayeda, T. K., Bogard, D. D., Garrison, D. H., Huss, G. R., Hutcheon, I. D., Wieler, R.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|60|14|2681|We have conducted petrologic, chemical, and isotopic studies of acapulcoites (Acapulco, Monument Draw, Yamato 74063, ALH A77081, ALH A81261, ALH A81315, ALH 78230, ALH A81187 and ALH 84190) in an attempt to constrain their genesis. Acapulcoites have distinctly different oxygen isotopic compositions than silicate inclusions in IAB and IIICD irons, winonaites and ureilites and, thus, formed on a different parent body. Oxygen isotopic compositions, which are slightly heterogeneous within the group, overlap with lodranites, indicating a likely origin on a common parent body. These groups can be distinguished on the basis of mafic silicate grain size. All acapulcoites have mafic silicate compositions intermediate between E and H chondrites, roughly chondritic mineralogies, achondritic, equigranular textures, micrometer to centimeter sized veins of Fe,NiFeS which cross-cut silicate phases, rapid metallographic cooling rates at ̃600-400°C (10 <SUP>3</SUP>-10 <SUP>5</SUP>°C/Myr) and trapped noble gas abundances comparable to type 3-4 ordinary chondrites. They exhibit variable mafic silicate zoning, abundance of Fe,NiFeS veins, REE abundances and patterns and, possibly, cosmic ray exposure ages (̃5-7 Ma). Momument Draw and Yamato 74063 retain rare relict chondrules. Phosphates are associated with Fe,NiFeS veins or form separate veins in Monument Draw and Acapulco. Heating and cooling of acapulcoites occurred very early in the history of the Solar System, as evidenced by the <SUP>39</SUP>Ar <SUP>40</SUP>Ar ages of ̃4.51 Ga. These ages appear distinctly younger than the likely formation time for Acapulco of 4.557 Ga, but are older than analogous <SUP>39</SUP>Ar <SUP>40</SUP>Ar ages for most chondrites. Acapulcoites formed from a precursor chondrite which differs from known chondrites in mineral and oxygen isotopic compositions. Heating to ̃950-1000°C resulted in melting at the Fe,NiFeS cotectic, but silicates did not melt. Silicate textures resulted from extensive solid-state recrystallization. Heating was by noncollisional sources (e.g., <SUP>26</SUP>Al, electromagnetic induction). Despite uncertainties owing to a lack of data, acapulcoites may have experienced a three-stage thermal history of slow cooling at high temperature, rapid cooling at intermediate temperatures, and slow cooling at low temperatures, possibly resulting from breakup and gravitational reassembly of the parent body. The complex thermal history is also reflected in disequilibrium REE abundances. One or at most two impact events (̃7 Ma and possibly ̃5 Ma ago) are consistent with the cosmic ray exposure ages of all four acapulcoites for which cosmogenic noble gas data exist.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(96)00109-3
