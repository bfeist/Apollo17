The new age adds further constraints on the significance of pre-4.0 Ga basin forming impacts on the Moon and possible mixing of ancient impactor compositions in lunar impact rocks. <P />Linear correlations displayed by subsamples of a given impact rock in plots of HSE versus Ir concentrations are explained by dilution processes through essentially HSE-free anorthositic lunar crustal target rocks or binary mixing between a high HSE meteoritic end-member and a low HSE end-member composition. Slope-derived HSE ratios and <SUP>187</SUP>Os/<SUP>188</SUP>Os of the meteoritic component in granulitic impactites 67915, 67955 and 79215 are similar to slightly volatile element depleted carbonaceous chondrites. Suprachondritic ratios of Ru/Ir, Pt/Ir, Rh/Ir, and Pd/Ir for Apollo 14 impact melt rock 14310 are similar to ratios observed for other Apollo 14 samples and Apollo 17 poikilitic impact melt rocks. Apollo 16 poikilitic and subophitic impact melt rocks 60315 and 67935 show slightly subchondritic Os/Ir and suprachondritic ratios of <SUP>187</SUP>Os/<SUP>188</SUP>Os, Ru/Ir, Pt/Ir, Rh/Ir, Pd/Ir and Au/Ir. Their strongly fractionated HSE compositions are similar to some members of the IVA iron meteorite group and provide further evidence for an iron meteorite impactor component in Apollo 16 impact melt rocks. <P />The range of chondritic to suprachondritic ratios of <SUP>187</SUP>Os/<SUP>188</SUP>Os, Ru/Ir, Pt/Ir, Pd/Ir, and chondritic to slightly subchondritic Os/Ir of Apollo 17 and 14 impact melt rocks may be explained by variable mixing of a carbonaceous chondrite-like HSE composition (as in granulitic impactites) with a suprachondritic iron meteorite-like impactor composition as inferred from 67935 and 60315, and subsequent homogenization by younger impact events. The inferred dispersal of these two components across the lunar nearside and their antiquity (4.2 Ga) suggest at least two basin-forming impacts that predate the 3.9-3.8 Ga basin forming era. The HSE composition of the silicate Earth can be matched by a late veneer comprised of ∼80% volatile depleted carbonaceous chondrite-like material and ∼20% differentiated meteoritic metal, similar to what has been identified in ancient lunar impact rocks.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2011.11.014
2009PhDT.......253H|2009|Mineralogy, petrology, and chronology of the lunar granulitic breccias|Hudgins, Jillian Amy|Ph.D. Thesis||||Before the return of the Apollo and Luna samples, many basic geological questions about the Moon remained unanswered. The study of returned samples, in addition to remote sensing data and the growing collection of meteorites has revealed that the Moon is a geologically complex body with a history dominated by impact events. Lunar meteorites provide samples of the crust far removed from the Apollo landing sites and are probably more representative of the average lunar crust. SaU 300 was previously misclassified as an anorthositic regolith breccia. Here, I reclassify it as a polymict crystalline impact-melt breccia with an anorthositic norite bulk composition. SaU 300 is a new meteorite that is unpaired with any of the currently known lunar meteorite samples. The main objective of this study was to gain a better understanding of the early evolution of the Moon by studying some of the oldest samples available: the granulitic breccias. The following samples were studied: Apollo samples 60035, 77017, 78155, and 79215 and paired meteorites NWA 3163/4881/4483. Granulitic breccias exhibit poikiloblastic to granoblastic matrix textures and occur as individual rocks and as fragments in impact-melt rocks, the regolith, and in lunar meteorites. These rocks contain 70 -- 80% anorthite, low concentrations of incompatible trace elements, and moderately high concentrations of siderophile elements. Their history was dominated by impact events and thermal metamorphism. Matrix pyroxenes in the granulitic breccias last equilibrated at ∼1050+/-50°C. 40Ar/39Ar data reveal that 60035, 77017, and 78155 have peak metamorphic ages of 4.1 Ga, while 79215 has a peak metamorphic age of 3.9 Ga. NWA 3163 has a peak metamorphic age of 3.3 Ga. Samples 60035, 77017, and NWA 4881 were partially reset by low temperature heating events following metamorphism. Granulitic breccias have been described as "homogeneous on a millimetre scale" throughout the literature. Although they appear to be compositionally homogeneous under petrographic and electron microscopes EMP analysis shows that they retain relic igneous minor and trace element zoning in their larger mafic mineral clasts. Based on the results of this study, I proposed that granulitic breccias form beneath thick, superheated melt sheets associated with impact basins and that they were heated for 104 -- 106 years.|
2008GeCoA..72.5781H|2008|A laser probe <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar and INAA investigation of four Apollo granulitic breccias|Hudgins, Jillian A., Spray, John G., Kelley, Simon P., Korotev, Randy L., Sherlock, Sarah C.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|72|23|5781|Infrared laser probe <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar geochronology, instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and analytical electron microscopy have been performed on four 0.5 × 1.0 × 0.3 cm polished rock tiles of Apollo 16 and 17 granulitic breccias (60035, 77017, 78155, and 79215). Pyroxene thermometry indicates that these samples were re-equilibrated and underwent peak metamorphic sub-solidus recrystallization at 1000-1100 °C, which resulted in homogeneous mineral compositions and granoblastic textures. <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar data from this study reveal that three samples (60035, 77017, and 78155) have peak metamorphic ages of ∼4.1 Ga. Sample 79215 has a peak metamorphic age of 3.9 Ga, which may be related to Serenitatis basin formation. All four samples contain moderately high concentrations of meteoritic siderophiles. Enhanced siderophile contents in three of the samples provide evidence for projectile contamination of their target lithologies occurring prior to peak metamorphism. Post-peak metamorphism, low-temperature (&lt;300 °C) events caused the partial resetting of argon in the two finer-grained granulites (60035 and 77017). These later events did not alter the mineralogy or texture of the rocks, but caused minor brecciation and the partial release of argon from plagioclase. Interpretation of the low-temperature data indicates partial resetting of the argon systematics to as young as 3.2 Ga for 60035 and 2.3 Ga for 77017. Cosmic ray exposure ages range from 6.4 to ∼339 Ma. Our results increase the amount of high-precision data available for the granulitic breccias and lunar highlands crustal samples. The results demonstrate the survival of pre-Nectarian material on the lunar surface and document the effects of contact metamorphic and impact processes during the pre-Nectarian Epoch, as well as the low-temperature partial resetting of ages by smaller impact events after 3.9 Ga. The mineralogy and chemical composition of these rocks, as well as exhumation constraints, indicate that the source of heat for metamorphism was within kilometers of the surface via burial beneath impact-melt sheets or hot ejecta blankets.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2008.08.024

1986JGR....91D.263L|1986|Lunar granulites and their precursor anorthositic norites of the early lunar crust|Lindstrom, Marilyn M., Lindstrom, David J.|Journal of Geophysical Research|91|B4|D263|Lunar granulites are breccias with metamorphic textures. They are not pristine, having been contaminated with meteoritic siderophiles. Nonetheless, they constitute an abundant class of highlands rocks that are important because they are ancient and KREEP-free. They may represent our best samples of the early lunar crust. The granulites can be divided into ferroan and magnesian groups, and each group can be subdivided on the basis of mineral composition and REE concentrations. Textural and compositional data show that some of the granulites (especially 67215 and 67415) may be derived from distinct anorthositic norite precursors, while some other granulites (79215, 78155) are clearly polymict. Even the polymict granulites probably had anorthositic norites as their dominant precursors, and not anorthosites, norites, or troctolites. The granulites have compositions similar to those of the two lunar meteorites, one of which (Yamato-791197) is ferroan, the other (ALHA81005) magnesian. These meteorites are soil breccias from an unknown location distant from the Apollo landing sites and contain anorthositic norites as abundant clasts. Compositions of granulites and lunar meteorites more closely resemble the average composition of lunar highlands, as determined by remote sensing, than do those of any other returned lunar samples. The predominance of plutonic anorthositic norite precursors in material having the composition typical of highlands suggests that plutonic anorthositic norites were more abundant in the early lunar crust than is implied by their scarcity among pristine rocks from Apollo missions.|

1980LPSC...11..365J|1980|Rocks of the early lunar crust.|James, O. B.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||365|Data are summarized which suggest a model for the early evolution of the lunar crust. According to the model, during the final stages of accretion, the outer part of the moon melted to form a magma ocean approximately 300 km deep. This ocean fractionated to form mafic and ultramafic cumulates at depth and an overlying anorthositic crust made up of ferroan anorthosites. Subsequent partial melting in the primitive mantle underlying the crystallized magma ocean produced melts which segregated, moved upward, intruded the primordial crust, and crystallized to form layered plutons consisting of Mg-rich plutonic rocks. Intense impact bombardment at the lunar surface mixed and melted the rocks of the two suites to form a thick layer of granulated debris, granulitic breccias, and impact-melt rocks.|

H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||493|It is noted that the partitioning of Fe(2+) and Mg between olivine and ilmenite is temperature-dependent and can serve as a geothermometer if the activity-composition relations are determined. The paper reports on the study of the partitioning from 700-980 C at 1 kbar and 800-900 C at 13 kbar, and develops a solution model to account for the nonideality of olivine in the binary system fosterite-fayalite and for ilmenite in the ternary system ilmenite-geikielite-hematite. A comparison with crystallization experiments shows that this thermometer may be safely extrapolated to temperatures higher than those of the exchange experiments.|
