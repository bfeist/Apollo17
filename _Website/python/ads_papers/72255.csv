2020EGUGA..22.1169C|2020|Lunar Phosphates Record Impact Cratering Events at Micro to Nano Scales|Cernok, Ana, White, Lee, Tait, Kimberly, Anand, Mahesh, Kamo, Sandra, Whitehouse, Martin, Darling, James|EGU General Assembly Conference Abstracts|||1169|The field of planetary mineralogy has greatly benefited from recent studies of accessory minerals that utilise µm- and nm-scale analytical techniques such as EBSD, APT, TEM and SIMS. Apatite and merrillite have been of particular interest, as they record vital information on the volatile content, U-Pb ages and trace-element composition of various planetary materials. However, the extent to which shock-deformation, pervasive among all planetary materials, affects the distribution of these valuable geochemical tracers is still poorly understood. Here we focus on exploring the U-Pb and Pb-Pb ages of apatite and merrillite in a set of variably shocked lunar rocks, building on previous nanostructural analyses of the phosphates.We carried out U-Pb and Pb-Pb analyses of phosphates in Apollo 17 samples of the Mg-suite rocks (76535, 76335, 76255, 72255, 78235 and 78236) using the CAMECA 1280 ion microprobe at the NordSIMS facility (Stockholm). In addition, we applied a recently developed approach of conducting high-precision U-Pb and Pb-Pb analyses by ID-TIMS of extracted phosphate grains (Jack Satterly Lab, University of Toronto). For this purpose, individual ~50x50x30 µm crystals of apatite and merrillite were extracted directly from thin sections using a Xe+ plasma FIB.As determined by SIMS, 207Pb/206Pb systematics of the unshocked or weakly shocked apatite in 76535 and 76335 is undisturbed, implying cooling of the rock below the closure temperature of Pb diffusion in apatite (~450°C) at ~4.2 Ga, ~100 Ma younger than what is interpreted as the rock's crystallization age. Phosphates that experienced similar levels of deformation but were in proximity or in direct contact with the impact melt in samples 76255 and 72255 show almost complete age resetting (~3.92 Ga). The SIMS determined age of 16 phosphates in sample 76255 is 3922.2 ± 6.7 Ma (2σ) and agrees with the previously published 207Pb/206Pb phosphate ages of impact melt breccias found within the same boulder and was interpreted as the timing of the Imbrium impact. These recrystallized phosphates yield comparable TIMS Pb-Pb ages (3917.8 ± 1.8 Ma and 3921.0 ± 1.3 Ma, 2σ) with significantly lower internal uncertainties than that of the individual SIMS measurements and may represent multiple impact-events close to the Imbrium event.SIMS U-Pb analyses of highly shocked phosphates (78235 and 78236) reveal a discordia line with an upper intercept of ~4.2 Ga and a lower intercept of ~0.5 Ga. We interpret this new, younger age as a minor thermal event that reactivated existing shock-induced nm-scale grain boundaries, as visualised by APT, within the apatite population to allow for Pb-loss at ~0.5 Ga. We propose a small crater located near the Apollo 17 landing site as a possible source of this sample.By correlating micro- to nanostructural characterization with in-situ age systematics we show that apatite and merrillite are powerful thermochronometers that provide a new approach to dating which has the potential to discriminate between temporally similar events. This can greatly aid in unravelling the bombardment record of solar system and be helpful when dealing with samples of limited availability (e.g. space return missions).|
2019M&PS...54.1262C|2019|Shock-induced microtextures in lunar apatite and merrillite|Černok, Ana, White, Lee Francis, Darling, James, Dunlop, Joseph, Anand, Mahesh|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|54|6|1262|Apatite and merrillite are the most common phosphate minerals in a wide range of planetary materials and are key accessory phases for in situ age dating, as well as for determination of the volatile abundances and their isotopic composition. Although most lunar and meteoritic samples show at least some evidence of impact metamorphism, relatively little is known about how these two phosphates respond to shock-loading. In this work, we analyzed a set of well-studied lunar highlands samples (Apollo 17 Mg-suite rocks 76535, 76335, 72255, 78235, and 78236), in order of displaying increasing shock deformation stages from S1 to S6. We determined the stage of shock deformation of the rock based on existing plagioclase shock-pressure barometry using optical microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and SEM-based panchromatic cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging of plagioclase. We then inspected the microtexture of apatite and merrillite through an integrated study of Raman spectroscopy, SEM-CL imaging, and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). EBSD analyses revealed that microtextures in apatite and merrillite become progressively more complex and deformed with increasing levels of shock-loading. An early shock-stage fragmentation at S1 and S2 is followed by subgrain formation from S2 onward, showing consistent decrease in subgrain size with increasing level of deformation (up to S5) and finally granularization of grains caused by recrystallization (S6). Starting with 2°-3° of intragrain crystal-plastic deformation in both phosphates at the lowest shock stage, apatite undergoes up to 25° and merrillite up to 30° of crystal-plastic deformation at the highest stage of shock deformation (S5). Merrillite displays lower shock impedance than apatite; hence, it is more deformed at the same level of shock-loading. We suggest that the microtexture of apatite and merrillite visualized by EBSD can be used to evaluate stages of shock deformation and should be taken into account when interpreting in situ geochemically relevant analyses of the phosphates, e.g., age or volatile content, as it has been shown in other accessory minerals that differently shocked domains can yield significantly different ages.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maps.13278
2017M&PS...52..584T|2017|Impact history of the Apollo 17 landing site revealed by U-Pb SIMS ages|Thiessen, Fiona, Nemchin, Alexander A., Snape, Joshua F., Whitehouse, Martin J., Bellucci, Jeremy J.|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|52|4|584|Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) U-Pb ages of Ca-phosphates from four texturally distinct breccia samples (72255, 76055, 76015, 76215) collected at the Apollo 17 landing site were obtained in an attempt to identify whether they represent a single or several impact event(s). The determined ages, combined with inferences from petrologic relationships, may indicate two or possibly three different impact events at 3920 ± 3 Ma, 3922 ± 5 Ma, and 3930 ± 5 Ma (all errors 2σ). Searching for possible sources of the breccias by calculating the continuous ejecta radii of impact basins and large craters as well as their expected ejecta thicknesses, we conclude that Nectaris, Crisium, Serenitatis, and Imbrium are likely candidates. If the previous interpretation that the micropoikilitic breccias collected at the North Massif represent Serenitatis ejecta is correct, then the average <SUP>207</SUP>Pb/<SUP>206</SUP>Pb age of 3930 ± 5 Ma (2σ) dates the formation of the Serenitatis basin. The occurrence of zircon in the breccias sampled at the South Massif, which contain Ca-phosphates yielding an age of 3922 ± 5 Ma (2σ), may indicate that the breccia originated from within the Procellarum KREEP terrane (PKT) and the Imbrium basin appears to be the only basin that could have sourced them. However, this interpretation implies that all basins suggested to fall stratigraphically between Serenitatis and Imbrium formed within a short (&lt;11 Ma) time interval, highlighting serious contradictions between global stratigraphic constraints, sample interpretation, and chronological data. Alternatively, the slightly older age of the two micropoikilitic breccias may be a result of incomplete resetting of the U-Pb system preserved in some phosphate grains. Based on the currently available data set this possibility cannot be excluded.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maps.12814

V., Jolliff, B. L., Van Soest, M. C., Wartho, J. A., Weirich, J. R.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2015||P33C-2136|Several boulders located at the bases of the North and South Massifs were among the primary field targets of the Apollo 17 mission to the Taurus-Littrow Valley on the Moon [1]. Some boulders are polylithologic, including Boulder 1 at Station 2 and the boulders at Stations 6 and 7. These boulders were the subjects of consortium studies [2, 3] that included 40Ar/39Ar geochronology to determine the ages of distinct lithologies within each boulder [e.g., 4-6]. We report new 40Ar/39Ar data for the impact melt breccias 72255, 76315, 77075, and 77135 obtained using the UV laser ablation microprobe (UVLAMP) methods of [7]. For 72255, we obtained a preliminary isochron date ca. 3814 Ma from 22 melt analyses, which is younger than published plateau dates (e.g., 3951-3835 Ma [4, 8]). Fifteen melt analyses of 76315 yield a preliminary isochron date ca. 3850 Ma, younger than the 3900 ± 16 Ma date reported by [8]. Melt analyses of 77075 yield preliminary dates between ca. 3797-3584 Ma, possibly reflecting partial loss of 40Ar. In this case, the oldest date may provide a minimum age for the formation of melt in 77075. Finally, the UVLAMP dates for the 77135 melt range from 3810-3361 Ma and corresponding Ca/K ratios range from ca. 100-6. Electron microprobe analyses of small (ca. 10s of microns wide) pockets of K-rich materials show that both K-rich glass and K-feldspar are present. The UVLAMP dates for 77135 likely reflect spatially variable 40Ar loss, consistent with published step heating results [e.g., 6]. References: [1] Schmitt (1973) Science, 182, 681-690.

Brent, Ryder, Graham|Journal of Geophysical Research|101|E11|26069|We have obtained high-resolution (21-63 steps) <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/<SUP>39</SUP>Ar age spectra using a continuous laser system on 19 submilligram samples of melt rocks and clasts from Apollo 17 samples collected from the pre-Imbrian highlands in the easternmost part of the Serenitatis basin. The samples include poikilitic melt rocks inferred to have been formed in the Serenitatis basin-forming impact, aphanitic melt rock whose compositions vary and whose provenance is uncertain, and granulite, gabbro, and melt clasts. Three of the poikilitic melts have similar age spectrum plateau ages (72395,96, 3893+/-16 Ma (2σ) 72535, 7, 3887+/-16 Ma; 76315, 150, 3900+/-16 Ma) with a weighted mean age of 3893+/-9 Ma, which we interpret as the best age for the Serenitatis basin-forming impact. Published <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/<SUP>39</SUP>Ar age spectrum ages of Apollo 17 poikilitic melts are consistent with our new age but are much less precise. Two poikilitic melts did not give plateaus and the maxima in their age spectra indicate ages of &gt;=3869 Ma (72558,7) and &gt;=3743 Ma (77135,178). Plateau ages of two poikilitic melts and two gabbro clasts from 73155 range from 3854+/-16 Ma to 3937+/-16 Ma and have probably been affected by the ubiquitous (older?) clasts and by post-formation heating (impact) events. Plateau ages from two of the aphanitic melt ``blobs'' and two granulites in sample 72255 fall in the narrow range of 3850+/-16 Ma to 3869+/-16 Ma with a weighted mean of 3862+/-8 Ma. Two of the aphanitic melt blobs from 72255 have ages of 3883+/-16 Ma and &gt;=3894 Ma, whereas a poikilitic melt clast (of different composition from the ``Serenitatis'' melts) has an age of 3835+/-16 Ma, which is the upper limit for the accretion of 72255. These data suggest that either the aphanitic melts vary in age, as is also suggested by their varying chemical compositions, or they formed in the 72255 accretionary event about 3.84-3.85 Ga and older relict material is responsible for the dispersion of ages. In any case the aphanitic melts do not appear to be Serenitatis products. Our age for the Serenitatis impact shows, on the basis of the isotopic age evidence alone, that Serenitatis is &gt;20-25 Ma and probably &gt;55-60 Ma older than Imbrium (&lt;=3870 Ma and probably &lt;=3836 Ma [Dalrymple and Ryder, 1993]). Noritic granulite sample 78527 has a plateau age of 4146+/-17 Ma, representing a minimum age for cooling of this sample in the early lunar crust. So far there is no convincing evidence in the lunar melt rock record for basin-forming impacts significantly older than 3.9 Ga.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/96JE02806
1992Metic..27R.284R|1992|A Distinct Poikilitic Impact Melt Rock from the Apollo 17 Landing Site that is not from the Serenitatis Melt Sheet|Ryder, G.|Meteoritics|27|3|284|A poikilitic impact melt rock fragment in a sample from Boulder 1, Station 2, is distinct and important: 1) no such poikilitic- textured melt rock has been observed in Boulder 1 before; 2) although superficially similar to typical coarse samples of the Serenitatis melt sheet, it is chemically and petrographically distinct from them. It extends the known range of significant low-K Fra Mauro impact melt rock compositions that potentially can provide us with information about lunar crustal components and structure. Lunar sample 72255 is a fine-grained aphanitic melt representing Boulder 1 on the South Massif. It contains many clasts, including granitic fragments, but more typically fine basaltic-composition impact melts, feldspathic breccias, and granulitic impactites. The aphanitic melt groundmass of 72255 is distinct in composition from typical Serenitatis impact melt samples, but even if it formed in a distinct event, the relative ages are radiometrically indistinguishable (at present). The discovery of a poikilitic impact melt rock fragment during new investigations of 72255 at first led me to conclude that Boulder 1 contained fragments of the Serenitatis melt sheet, hence must be slightly younger. However, a closer inspection and analysis reveals that this fragment is distinct from the Serenitatis melt sheet samples, thus stratigraphy cannot be inferred from it. The distinction of the fragment instead gives it a different potential significance, that of furthering our understanding of crustal components. The fragment was observed in saw-cut faces as a sharply defined pale brown clast embedded in the groundmass. It was about 7 mm in diameter, although not all was exposed. The fragment was crystalline, with dark brown pyroxenes, white plagioclases, and a pale yellow minor phase. Its texture and the presence of small vugs suggested an igneous rock, and it was chipped for chemical and thin section studies. The thin section revealed a clast-bearing impact melt rock with pyroxene oikocrysts, plagioclase chadacrysts, and ilmenite chains, very similar to Apollo 15, 16, and 17 coarser poikilitic impact melt samples. The chemistry of its mineral phases (both clasts and groundmass) is identical with Apollo 17 poikilitic boulder samples, e.g., pigeonite oikocrysts with a range of En82- 70. It does contain rather more high-Ca pyroxene oikocrysts than do the poikilitic boulders: pig/cpx of 2 rather than about 4. The oikocrysts, about a millimeter across, contain many plagioclase chadacrysts. They are normally zoned outward from their cores, with superimposed normal zoning toward each plagioclase chadacryst. The clasts are dominantly plagioclases, with some olivine and rare lithic fragments such as a feldspathic granulite. A small amount of olivine may have crystallized from the melt, but none forms oikocrysts. The INAA shows the melt rock fragment to be a little higher in Ca and a little lower in Fe than the poikilitic boulders. The main difference is the much lower abundance of all large ion lithophile elements in the new clast, e.g., Sm 8 ppm cf. 15 ppm in the poikilitic boulders. This result was confirmed by analysis of both a second chip and a second analysis of the first chip. The difference is far too great to result merely from a larger clast content in the new fragment; the chemistry suggests an entirely separate impact event, not a phase of Serenitatis. The higher modal clinopyroxene suggests the same. The melt rock fragment is also distinct from the few other unique Apollo 17 melts, such as 76055, or any of the Apollo 15 and 16 poikilitic melts. It extends the range of known low-K Fra Mauro samples, and gives us more potential to understand both the lunar crust, and Boulder 1. Its investigation will continue with more complete mineralogical and chemical data, an age determination, and a detailed comparison with all other known poikilitic melt samples.|

The rocks of these groups differ in ratios of high-Ca pyroxene to total pyroxene, compositions of pyroxene and plagioclase, assemblages of Ti-, Nb-, and Zr-bearing minerals, compositions of chrome spinel, bulk-rock Ti/Sm and Sc/Sm, and measured ages. The two groups probably crystallized from different types of parent magmas. Two hypotheses are offered for the differences in composition of the parent magmas. One hypothesis ascribes the differences to compositional heterogeneity of the mantle source areas. The other hypothesis ascribes the differences to variations in extent of partial melting of the mantle source regions and variations in extent of assimilation of the anorthosite and the highly differentiated residual liquid that were produced during the primordial lunar differentiation.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB088iS02p0A603

B.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||365|Data are summarized which suggest a model for the early evolution of the lunar crust. According to the model, during the final stages of accretion, the outer part of the moon melted to form a magma ocean approximately 300 km deep. This ocean fractionated to form mafic and ultramafic cumulates at depth and an overlying anorthositic crust made up of ferroan anorthosites. Subsequent partial melting in the primitive mantle underlying the crystallized magma ocean produced melts which segregated, moved upward, intruded the primordial crust, and crystallized to form layered plutons consisting of Mg-rich plutonic rocks. Intense impact bombardment at the lunar surface mixed and melted the rocks of the two suites to form a thick layer of granulated debris, granulitic breccias, and impact-melt rocks.|

Evidence points to pristine norites as substantial contributors to highlands breccias; the bulk major element compositions of breccias average noritic anorthosite, and norites are the second-most abundant of pristine samples. In addition, plots of element abundances in breccias indicate that KREEP in highlands breccias is not of Apollo 14 composition but is higher in Ti and Sc, and probably lower in incompatibles.|

One clast from 72275 yielded a stable NRM direction which was different from that of the matrix. Approximate paleointensity measurements showed that 72255 and 72275 could have obtained their stable remanence from an ancient magnetic field of the same magnitude. However, 72215 probably was magnetized by a magnetic field of a different intensity. We concluded that the coincident NRM directions owe their origin to a secondary imprint of less stable magnetization imparted during the assembly of the boulder at moderate temperatures (∼ 450°C) on the South Massif. The stable directions, on the other hand, date from the last, higher-temperature (∼ 770°C) magnetizing event experienced by the mineral and lithic components while they were part of the immature pre-Serenitatis regolith.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00569677

Two samples from rock 72255, the Civet Cat clast and a sample of adjacent breccia, have concordant<SUP>40</SUP>Ar-<SUP>39</SUP> Ar ages of 3.99±0.03 b.y. and 4.01±0.03 b.y., respectively. Several samples from rock 72275 have complex thermal release patterns with no datable features, but an intermediate-temperature plateau from the dark rim material of the Marble Cake clast yields an age of 3.99±0.03 b.y. - indistinguishable from the age of rock 72255. We regard these ages as upper limits on the time of the Serenitatis basin-forming event. The absence of fossil solar-wind trapped gases in the breccia samples implies that a prior existence for the boulder as near-surface regolith material can be regarded as extremely unlikely. Instead, the small trapped rare-gas components have isotopic and elemental compositions diagnostic of the terrestrial-type trapped component which has previously been identified in several Apollo 16 breccias and in rock 14321. Excess fission Xe is found in all Boulder 1 samples in approximately 1:1 proportions with Xe from spontaneous fission of<SUP>238</SUP>U.

However a distinctly different<SUP>81</SUP>Kr-Kr exposure age of 52.5±1.4 m.y. is obtained for samples from rock 72275. A two-stage exposure model is developed to account for this discordance and for the remaining cosmogenic rare-gas data. The first stage was initiated at least 55 m.y. ago, probably as a result of the excavation of the boulder source-crop. A discrete change in shielding depths ∼ 35 m.y. ago probably corresponds to the dislodgement of Boulder 1 from the South Massif and emplacement in its present position.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00569674
1975Moon...14..463N|1975|U-Th-Pb systematics of selected samples from Apollo 17, Boulder 1, Station 2|Nunes, P. D., Tatsumoto, M.|Moon|14|3-4|463|Nine U-Th-Pb whole-rock analyses of selected brecciated materials from sample 72215 and one analysis of a pigeonite basalt clast from 72275 are presented. Both samples are from Boulder 1, Apollo 17. These data supplement previous Boulder 1 U-Th-Pb analyses of samples 72275 and 72255. U and Th concentrations indicate that most of the samples contain a moderate to large KREEP component. Samples containing the least KREEP are a noritic clast (72255,49; Civet Cat clast) and an anorthositic clast (72275,117). Evidence for the migration of Pb from Pb-rich matrix material into relatively Pb-poor clasts is presented for two clasts. Most of the Boulder 1 data define a linear trend that intersects concordia at ∼ 3.9 and 4.4 b.y. when plotted on a U-Pb concordia diagram. The presence of one anorthositic clast distinctly off this trend indicates that a simple two-stage U-Pb evolution history is inadequate to explain all the data. Accordingly physical significance is only attached to the lower concordia intercept age of 3.9 4.0 b.y. The older concordia intercept age of ∼ 4.4 b.y. is interpreted to reflect an averaging of events both older and younger than 4.4 b.y. The data suggest that significant differentiation and/or metamorphism occurred ∼ 4.2 b.y. ago. The age of this event, however, is not accurately defined by these data.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00569676
1975Moon...14..445C|1975|Rb-Sr Ages of Clasts from Within Boulder 1, Station 2, Apollo 17|Compston, W., Foster, J. J., Gray, C. M.|Moon|14|3-4|445|Rb, Sr and<SUP>87</SUP>Sr/<SUP>86</SUP>Sr have been determined for fragments of matrix and clasts from three of the hand-specimens of Boulder 1, 72275, 72255, and 72215. Total-rock and certain plagioclase samples from a crushed norite clast (Civet Cat) define an age of 4.17±0.05AE (2σ) for the pre-Serenitatis igneous differentiation of the norite. Pyroxene and other mineral separates were affected by a later event at about 3.9±0.1AE. An unshocked clast of pigeonite basalt has a well-fitted mineral isochron of 4.01±0.04AE. Samples of the competent breccia matrix comparatively rich in small clasts of highly radiogenic microgranite define a mixing line equivalent to 4.03±0.03AE, which denotes the age of the microgranite. Other samples of the matrix dominated by small anorthosite clasts define a 4.4AE mixing-line and demonstrate that Sr isotope equilibration between plagioclase and matrix did not occur during the high-temperature event that indurated the matrix.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00569675
