2009GeCoA..73.5884H|2009|Isotopic and elemental abundances of copper and zinc in lunar samples, Zagami, Pele’s hairs, and a terrestrial basalt|Herzog, G. F., Moynier, F., Albarède, F., Berezhnoy, A. A.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|73|19|5884|We used ICP-MS to measure the elemental concentrations and isotopic abundances of Cu and Zn in: nine Ti-rich lunar basalts (10017, 10022, 10024, 10057, 70215, 71055, 74255, 75055, and 75075); size-separated samples prepared by sieving of pyroclastic black glass 74001, orange glass 74022, and the lunar soils 15021, 15231, 70181, and 79221; a basalt from the Piton des Neiges volcano, Reunion Island; two samples of Pele's hairs from the Nyiragongo volcano, Democratic Republic of Congo, and the martian meteorite Zagami. The isotopic fractionation of zinc in lunar basalts and Zagami is mass dependent relative to a terrestrial standard (JMC 400882B). These and published results imply that lunar, terrestrial, meteoritic, and perhaps martian zinc all come from one or more reservoirs linked by mass-dependent fractionation processes. Relative to terrestrial basalts, Ti-rich lunar basalts are enriched in the heavier isotopes of Cu and Zn: we find for Ti-rich lunar basalts the following ranges and averages ±1 - σ (‰): δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu/ <SUP>63</SUP>Cu ≡ δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu, 0.1-1.4, 0.5 ± 0.1‰ ( N = 7); δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn/ <SUP>64</SUP>Zn ≡ δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn = 0.2-1.9, 1.2 ± 0.2‰ ( N = 8; 10017 excluded). For two terrestrial samples, we find δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn ̃ +0.3‰ and δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu ̃ 0‰, which are consistent with published values. The differences between the lunar basalts and terrestrial basalts could reflect minor, planetary-scale vaporization or igneous processes on the Moon. Data for size separates of the pyroclastic glasses 74001 and 74220 confirm the well-known surface correlation of Cu and Zn, but modeling calculations reveal no sharp differences between either the elemental ratios or the isotopic composition of grain interiors and exteriors. The absence of such differences indicates that the isotopic compositions for bulk samples are dominated by a light-isotope-rich surface component. Data for size separates of lunar soils also confirm the surface correlation of Cu and Zn, but an enrichment of heavy rather than light isotopes. Averages for bulk lunar soils from this work and the literature are (‰): δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu, from 1.4 to 4.1, average 3.0 ± 0.3 ( N = 9); δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn, from 2.2 to 6.4, average 4.0 ± 0.3 ( N = 14). As with the glasses, in all but soil 15231 our data show no strong differences between the isotopic composition of soil sub-samples with small and large grains. The size of the isotopic fractionation inferred for the surface component in the soils is 3× smaller than predicted by a published model of sputtering primarily by solar particles. At the same time, the observed fractionation is larger than predicted by calculations based on a model of micrometeorite impact heating and hydrodynamic quenching. Because impact heating appears unable to explain the observations, we conclude that sputtering must be important even though samples with very large isotopic fractionation of Cu and Zn have not yet been found.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2009.05.067
2001E&PSL.184..659M|2001|Lunar nitrogen: indigenous signature and cosmic-ray production rate|Mathew, K. J., Marti, K.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|184|3-4|659|Indigenous lunar nitrogen composition and abundances have been determined in old ferroan anorthosite 60025 and in anorthositic breccia 67915 from North Ray Crater, as well as in 55 cm deep volcanic glasses of 74001 double-drive core from Shorty Crater. Also included in the set is the well-documented lunar basalt 75075, collected near the Camelot Crater. Indigenous lunar N abundances are low (at ppm level), but there is some variation between glass-rich cores, mare basalts and anorthosites. The uniform indigenous N isotopic signature of δ <SUP>15</SUP>N=+13.0±1.2‰, is consistent with data reported previously for Shorty Crater samples. The indigenous δ <SUP>15</SUP>N cannot account for the light nitrogen component, observed in the lunar regolith samples. We have determined cosmic-ray production rates P( <SUP>15</SUP>N) for the above rocks and the drill core samples. The average production rate estimate (for low shielding) of P( <SUP>15</SUP>N)=5.8±0.6 pg <SUP>15</SUP>N/g/Ma is ̃60% higher than published lunar <SUP>15</SUP>N production rates, but consistent with the meteoritic production rate derived from silicates in the Enon meteorite, when normalized to 2π-irradiation geometry. From the observed cosmogenic <SUP>15</SUP>N excesses and the reported cosmogenic <SUP>21</SUP>Ne abundances in core 74001 we derive a ( <SUP>15</SUP>N <SUB>C</SUB>/ <SUP>21</SUP>Ne <SUB>C</SUB>) production rate ratio of 4.0±0.3 for silicates.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0012-821X(00)00327-7
1999M&PS...34..593W|1999|Space weathering on the moon: Patina on Apollo 17 samples 75075 and 76015|Wentworth, Susan J., Keller, Lindsay P., McKay, David S., Morris, Richard V.|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|34|4|593|We studied patinas on lunar rocks 75075 and 76015 from the Apollo collection using a multidisciplinary approach, including SEM, EDS, TEM, WDS X-ray mapping, Mössbauer spectroscopy, spectral reflectance, and microspectrophotometry. Based on SEM petrography, we have defined three textural types of patina: glazed, fragmental, and classic (cratered). The presence of classic patina is diagnostic of lunar samples that have been exposed directly to the space weathering environment. It is characterized by the presence of microcraters and glass pancakes, and is the patina type studied by earlier workers. Classic patina is found on 76015 but not on 75075. Glazed patina is found on both 76015 and 75075, while fragmental patina is found only on 75075. The glazed and fragmental patinas on 75075 were probably formed as a result of relatively large nearby impacts, and although these two types of patina are not strictly the result of direct exposure to the space weathering environment, they are important because they affect the optical properties of the rocks. Field emission gun SEM (FE-SEM) of classic patina on 76015 shows evidence of possible solar wind sputtering erosion. TEM studies of 76015 reveal the presence of impact-generated deposits and solar flare particle tracks which, like microcraters and pancakes, are diagnostic of direct exposure to space weathering processes. The outermost surface of the 76015 patina consists of an amorphous rim very much like the rims found on individual lunar soil grains; this amorphous patina rim probably formed by similar processes of impact-generated vapor condensation and possible sputter deposition. Wavelength-dispersive X-ray (WDS) element maps of polished thin sections of 75075 and 76015 indicate that patina compositions are poor indicators of the compositions and mineralogies of the rocks underlying them. On average, the reflectance spectra of patinas on both samples are slightly darker than those of their unweathered equivalents. Microreflectance measurements show that a thick patina can dramatically alter the optical properties of the rock on which it forms. The backscatter MöF6ssbauer (BaMS) spectrum of a patina-covered surface of 76015 is very similar to that of an unweathered surface, indicating that the Mössbauer signal is generated from beneath the patina. Because BaMS "sees" through surface space-weathering effects to the underlying rock, this technique has great potential for use in robotic missions to other planetary bodies.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1945-5100.1999.tb01366.x

S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference|28||1541|We recently defined three basic types of patina for Apollo 17 crystalline matrix breccia 76015 and high-Ti mare basalt 75075. Accretionary microcratered pancake-bearing (AMP) patina, found on 76015 is characterized by the presence of microcraters and glass pancakes (small circular glass splashes) in all size ranges. These microcraters and pancakes are evidence of direct exposure to space, as are solar flare tracks and possible solar wind sputtering erosion. The other two types of patina we recently defined, which were found on mare basalt 75075, include accretionary coalesced (AC) patina, consisting of thin discontinuous layers of glass, and accretionary welded fragmental (AWF) patina, made up of accreted layers of rounded, well-sorted mineral and glass grains. The AC and AWF patinas on 75075 showed no evidence of microcraters, pancakes, or any direct interaction with the solar wind.|

S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference|27||1423|A number of rocks in the lunar sample collection have surface patinas which formed as a result of exposure to the space weathering environment on the surface of the moon. It is important to understand patinas and their relationships to the rocks on which they formed because it is likely that patinas on surface- exposed rocks on the moon and other planetary bodies would affect data obtained by either remote sensing or unmanned landers. We have undertaken a multidisciplinary study of patinas on selected Apollo samples using a wide range of techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), backscattered electron imaging (BEI), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), backscatter Mossbauer spectrometry (BaMS), spectral reflectance spectroscopy, ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) analysis, and wavelength dispersive spectrometry (WDS). SEM/EDX results for patina on high-Ti mare basalt 75075 were reported by McKay et al in LPSC XXVI. Our current focus is on the patina on crystalline matrix breccia 76015. Our initial results show that the 76015 patina is very complex with characteristics that vary widely over a short distance. The 76015 patina is a good example of classic patina with typical lunar surface exposure features such as microcraters and glass pancakes, and is defined here as accretionary microcratered pancake-bearing (AMP) patina.|
1995GeCoA..59.2817N|1995|<SUP>146</SUP>Sm-<SUP>142</SUP>Nd formation interval for the lunar mantle|Nyquist, L. E., Wiesmann, H., Bansal, B., Shih, C. -Y., Keith, J. E., Harper, C. L.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|59|13|2817|Now-extinct <SUP>146</SUP>Sm (t<SUB>1/2</SUB>= 103Ma) was present in the early solar system, and lunar basalts might be expected to have inherited small anomalies in <SUP>142</SUP>Nd abundances from mantle sources with variable Sm/Nd ratios established during the early global differentiation of the Moon. <SUP>142</SUP>Nd/<SUP>144</SUP>Nd ratios were measured for several lunar basalts, and values of ∊Nd142, (deviations from terrestrial <SUP>142</SUP>Nd/<SUP>144</SUP>Nd in parts in 10<SUP>4</SUP>) calculated for them. The ∊Nd142 values show very small variations attributable to <SUP>146</SUP>Sm decay. Neutron capture near the lunar surface also modified both the samarium and neodymium isotopic compositions of the basalt samples. The calculated neutron fluences range from ̃0 to ̃7.8 × 10<SUP>16</SUP> n/cm<SUP>2</SUP>. Both thermal and epithermal neutron fluences were calculated from the Sm isotopic compositions of the basalts and used to correct the ∊Nd142 values for neutron capture by neodymium. Well-resolved radiogenic enrichments ∊Nd142 and +0.17 ± 0.08 (2σ), respectively, were measured for lunar meteorite Asuka 881757 and Apollo 17 basalt 74255, respectively, for which the neutron fluences were nil. Basalts 70135 and 75075, which were exposed to small, measureable neutron fluences of ̃2.5 × 10<SUP>15</SUP> and ̃7.7 × 10<SUP>15</SUP> n/cm<SUP>2</SUP>, respectively, have neutron-corrected ∊Nd142 values of +0.25± 0.15 and +0.29 ± 0.11, respectively. The average value of radiogenic ∊Nd142 for the three high-Ti basalts from Apollo 17 is +0.22 ± 0.06. Neutron capture effects were greater for the other basalts, but can be corrected using the measured neutron fluences derived from the samarium isotopic data. The neutron-corrected ∊Nd142 for Apollo 12 ilmenite basalt 12056, consistent with its derivation from a highly depleted mantle source also. Three low-Ti basalts from Apollo 12 and Apollo 15 (12038, 15076, 15555), have neutron corrected ∊Nd142 which are not resolved from zero, and average +0.04 ± 0.06. A fourth low-Ti basalt, 12039, has neutron-corrected ∊Nd142, but is subject to the largest neutron correction of ̃0.32 ∊-units. KREEP basalt 14078 was exposed to only a small neutron fluence of ̃6.4 × 10<SUP>15</SUP> n/cm<SUP>2</SUP>, and has a small deficit of <SUP>142</SUP>Nd, corresponding to ∊Nd142. The average neutron-corrected ∊Nd142 of three KREEP basalts is -0.05 ± 0.04. The ∊Nd142 values of the basalts correlate with <SUP>147</SUP>Sm/<SUP>144</SUP>Nd values for their source regions as calculated from their ages and initial ∊Nd142 values. <SUP>147</SUP>Sm- <SUP>143</SUP>Nd and <SUP>146</SUP>Sm- <SUP>142</SUP>Nd systematics were combined in a three-stage model yielding an isochron equation for the lunar mantle formation interval, which was calculated to be 238<SUB>-40</SUB><SUP>+56</SUP> Ma (2σ). Sm/Nd ratios for the source regions also are derived from the model and compare favorably with values from conventional geochemical models of mare basalt petrogenesis. If the Moon were formed by impact of a large, Mars-sized planetesimal with the Earth, the impact was early enough that the lunar mantle cooled to neodymium isotopic closure by ̃4.32 Ga ago. The bulk lunar ∊moon142 evaluated from the mantle isochron at (<SUP>147</SUP>Sm/<SUP>144</SUP>Nd)<SUB>CHUR</SUB> = 0.1967 is -0.01 ± 0.03 (2σ), consistent with derivation of lunar and terrestrial neodymium from a common reservoir.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(95)00175-Y

M., Vidal, P.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||509|Uranium, thorium and isotopic lead data are reported for two bulk samples and separated pyroxene, ilmenite and plagioclase from basalt 75075. In a concordia diagram the whole rock, ilmenite and four pyroxene samples define a chord intersecting the concordia curve at approximately 4.25 and 2.8 AE. Three plagioclase samples plot distinctly off the chord. The crystallization age of 75075 is accurately determined at 3.74 AE by Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd and K-Ar measurements from other laboratories. It is not possible to adjust the isotopic composition of initial lead so as to reconcile the U-Pb data with a crystallization age of 3.74 AE. The data therefore indicate some type of post-crystallization disturbance of the U-Pb system that is not detected by the other systems. The 75075 data are one of the few examples of this type of age pattern found on the moon. If the disturbance was a single event, it probably occurred around 2.8 AE ago, the time indicated by the pyroxene, whole rock and ilmenite data.|

This rotation characteristic is much more pronounced in grains from rock 75035 than in those from rock 75075. The diffraction patterns indicate the exsolution of pigeonite and augite. There is only one exception: a pigeonite-free twinned augite. Electron microscopy of one of these grains revealed small areas with bent (100) planes.|
