V., Jolliff, B. L., Van Soest, M. C., Wartho, J. A., Weirich, J. R.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2015||P33C-2136|Several boulders located at the bases of the North and South Massifs were among the primary field targets of the Apollo 17 mission to the Taurus-Littrow Valley on the Moon [1]. Some boulders are polylithologic, including Boulder 1 at Station 2 and the boulders at Stations 6 and 7. These boulders were the subjects of consortium studies [2, 3] that included 40Ar/39Ar geochronology to determine the ages of distinct lithologies within each boulder [e.g., 4-6]. We report new 40Ar/39Ar data for the impact melt breccias 72255, 76315, 77075, and 77135 obtained using the UV laser ablation microprobe (UVLAMP) methods of [7]. For 72255, we obtained a preliminary isochron date ca. 3814 Ma from 22 melt analyses, which is younger than published plateau dates (e.g., 3951-3835 Ma [4, 8]). Fifteen melt analyses of 76315 yield a preliminary isochron date ca. 3850 Ma, younger than the 3900 ± 16 Ma date reported by [8]. Melt analyses of 77075 yield preliminary dates between ca. 3797-3584 Ma, possibly reflecting partial loss of 40Ar. In this case, the oldest date may provide a minimum age for the formation of melt in 77075. Finally, the UVLAMP dates for the 77135 melt range from 3810-3361 Ma and corresponding Ca/K ratios range from ca. 100-6. Electron microprobe analyses of small (ca. 10s of microns wide) pockets of K-rich materials show that both K-rich glass and K-feldspar are present. The UVLAMP dates for 77135 likely reflect spatially variable 40Ar loss, consistent with published step heating results [e.g., 6]. References: [1] Schmitt (1973) Science, 182, 681-690.

1996JGR...10126069D|1996|Argon-40/argon-39 age spectra of Apollo 17 highlands breccia samples by laser step heating and the age of the Serenitatis basin|Dalrymple, G. Brent, Ryder, Graham|Journal of Geophysical Research|101|E11|26069|We have obtained high-resolution (21-63 steps) <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/<SUP>39</SUP>Ar age spectra using a continuous laser system on 19 submilligram samples of melt rocks and clasts from Apollo 17 samples collected from the pre-Imbrian highlands in the easternmost part of the Serenitatis basin. The samples include poikilitic melt rocks inferred to have been formed in the Serenitatis basin-forming impact, aphanitic melt rock whose compositions vary and whose provenance is uncertain, and granulite, gabbro, and melt clasts. Three of the poikilitic melts have similar age spectrum plateau ages (72395,96, 3893+/-16 Ma (2σ) 72535, 7, 3887+/-16 Ma; 76315, 150, 3900+/-16 Ma) with a weighted mean age of 3893+/-9 Ma, which we interpret as the best age for the Serenitatis basin-forming impact. Published <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/<SUP>39</SUP>Ar age spectrum ages of Apollo 17 poikilitic melts are consistent with our new age but are much less precise. Two poikilitic melts did not give plateaus and the maxima in their age spectra indicate ages of &gt;=3869 Ma (72558,7) and &gt;=3743 Ma (77135,178). Plateau ages of two poikilitic melts and two gabbro clasts from 73155 range from 3854+/-16 Ma to 3937+/-16 Ma and have probably been affected by the ubiquitous (older?) clasts and by post-formation heating (impact) events. Plateau ages from two of the aphanitic melt ``blobs'' and two granulites in sample 72255 fall in the narrow range of 3850+/-16 Ma to 3869+/-16 Ma with a weighted mean of 3862+/-8 Ma. Two of the aphanitic melt blobs from 72255 have ages of 3883+/-16 Ma and &gt;=3894 Ma, whereas a poikilitic melt clast (of different composition from the ``Serenitatis'' melts) has an age of 3835+/-16 Ma, which is the upper limit for the accretion of 72255. These data suggest that either the aphanitic melts vary in age, as is also suggested by their varying chemical compositions, or they formed in the 72255 accretionary event about 3.84-3.85 Ga and older relict material is responsible for the dispersion of ages. In any case the aphanitic melts do not appear to be Serenitatis products. Our age for the Serenitatis impact shows, on the basis of the isotopic age evidence alone, that Serenitatis is &gt;20-25 Ma and probably &gt;55-60 Ma older than Imbrium (&lt;=3870 Ma and probably &lt;=3836 Ma [Dalrymple and Ryder, 1993]). Noritic granulite sample 78527 has a plateau age of 4146+/-17 Ma, representing a minimum age for cooling of this sample in the early lunar crust. So far there is no convincing evidence in the lunar melt rock record for basin-forming impacts significantly older than 3.9 Ga.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/96JE02806

Jeffrey, Spudis, Paul, Ryder, Graham|Geology of the Apollo 17 Landing Site|||42|LKFM basaltic impact melts are abundant among Apollo lunar samples, especially those from Apollo 15, 16, and 17. They are generally basaltic in composition, but are found exclusively as impact melts. They seem to be related to basins and so could represent the composition of the lower lunar crust. They contain lithic clasts that cannot be mixed in any proportion to produce the composition of the melt matrix; components rich in transition elements (Ti, Cr, Sc) and REE are not considered. To search for the mysterious cryptic component, we previously investigated the mineral clast population in two Apollo 14 LKFM basaltic impact melts, 15445 and 15455. The cryptic component was not present in the mineral clast assemblage of these breccias either, but some olivine and pyroxene grains appeared to be from lithologies not represented among identified igneous rocks from the lunar highlands. In addition, none of the mineral clasts could be unambiguously assigned to a ferroan anorthosite source. We have now extended this study to Apollo 17, starting with two LKFM impact melt breccias (76295 and 76315) from the Apollo 17 station 6 boulder. The results from the study are presented.|

The absolute amount of the meteoritic contamination, as well as the observed variations in concentrations of meteoritic elements in the Apollo 17 melt sheet, is comparable to what is observed in some large terrestrial melt sheets. In favorable cases, concentrations of siderophile meteoritic elements in the basement (indigenous component) can be found on the basis of correlations of two meteoritic elements in impact melt samples. Indigenous Ni and Co concentrations found in this way for the Apollo 17 melt are, respectively, 40 + or - 15 ppm Ni and 21.6 + or - 3.5 ppm Co. It is noted that these values are consistent with a chondritic Ni/Co ratio of the projectile.|

J.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1269|Data for 35 major, minor, and trace elements in 40 bulk and size fractions of core 70005-70003 (140-250 cm) are presented. The core is heterogeneous with depth. Moreover, the 1000 to 90 micron coarse fractions are nearly identical but quite different from the less than 20 micron fine fraction. The bulk soil chemistry is governed by the coarse fractions, because of their greater weight proportion in the sample. The 1000-90 micron fraction contains more ilmenite basalt and less orange glass components than the 90-20 micron fraction. The less than 20 micron fraction is consistently enriched in highland material at all depths in the drill core.|

M.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||661|Petrographic, chemical and isotopic similarities between 14078 and other Apollo-14 KREEP basalts suggest that these samples were derived from the same parent liquid and possibly from the same cooling unit. The liquid was probably generated via meteorite impact. Subtle differences are noted in the shapes of REE patterns of KREEP-rich samples from different landing sites; the origin of these differences is not well understood. Calculated Ti/Sm values in liquids parental to primitive cumulate samples are similar to values proposed for the whole moon.|
1978E&PSL..38..373G|1978|Origin of magnetization in lunar breccias: An example of thermal overprinting|Gose, W. A., Strangway, D. W., Pearce, G. W.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|38|2|373|Twenty six samples from seven hand specimens, collected from the station 6 boulder at the Apollo 17 landing site, were studied magnetically. The boulder is a breccia consisting of three lithologic units distinguished by their clast population. The direction of magnetization of samples from unit B which is almost devoid of large clasts cluster fairly well after alternating field demagnetization. Samples from unit C which is characterized by abundant large clasts up to 1 m in size do not contain a uniform direction of magnetization but the distribution is not random. Based on these data we propose that the natural remanent magnetization (NRM) in these breccias is the vector sum of two magnetizations, a pre-impact magnetization and a partial thermoremanence acquired during breccia formation. The relative contribution of the two components is controlled by the thermal history of the ejecta, which in turn is determined by its clast population. Depending on the clast population, the NRM can be a total thermoremanence, a partial thermoremanence plus a pre-impact magnetization, or a pre-impact magnetization. This model of thermal overprinting might be applicable to all lunar breccias of medium and higher metamorphic grade.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(78)90111-5

A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2251|Eighteen sections representing five matrix samples - 76015, 76215, 76275, 76295, and 76315 - from the Station 6 boulder were examined with emphasis on the textures and compositions of their native FeNi metal particles. It is found that many of the complex multiphase structures of the metal particles observed in the study cannot be explained by a continuous two-stage cooling of the impact-melt sheet. It is suggested that at least locally the boulder samples must have experienced multistage cooling and heating.|

Fractions of the Cl, Br, and Hg that are mobilized by water leaching and/or volatilization at moderate temperatures (⩽450°C) place constraints on the thermal history of Boulder 1 and its component breccias. Since, and possibly during, consolidation, the boulder has probably not been subjected to temperatures of ⩾450°C. The parent rocks of the Apollo 17 boulder and breccia samples studied could have been derived from two initial magmas. Boulder 1, Station 2 gray competent breccias 72255 and 72275 Clast #2 appear to be genetically unrelated to gray competent breccia and anorthositic material 72215, or to light friable breccia 72275; they do appear to be related to samples 72395 (Boulder 2) and 76315 (Station 6 boulder). Vapor clouds from apparently external sources permeated the source regions of the boulders.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00569672
