2009GeCoA..73.5884H|2009|Isotopic and elemental abundances of copper and zinc in lunar samples, Zagami, Pele’s hairs, and a terrestrial basalt|Herzog, G. F., Moynier, F., Albarède, F., Berezhnoy, A. A.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|73|19|5884|We used ICP-MS to measure the elemental concentrations and isotopic abundances of Cu and Zn in: nine Ti-rich lunar basalts (10017, 10022, 10024, 10057, 70215, 71055, 74255, 75055, and 75075); size-separated samples prepared by sieving of pyroclastic black glass 74001, orange glass 74022, and the lunar soils 15021, 15231, 70181, and 79221; a basalt from the Piton des Neiges volcano, Reunion Island; two samples of Pele's hairs from the Nyiragongo volcano, Democratic Republic of Congo, and the martian meteorite Zagami. The isotopic fractionation of zinc in lunar basalts and Zagami is mass dependent relative to a terrestrial standard (JMC 400882B). These and published results imply that lunar, terrestrial, meteoritic, and perhaps martian zinc all come from one or more reservoirs linked by mass-dependent fractionation processes. Relative to terrestrial basalts, Ti-rich lunar basalts are enriched in the heavier isotopes of Cu and Zn: we find for Ti-rich lunar basalts the following ranges and averages ±1 - σ (‰): δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu/ <SUP>63</SUP>Cu ≡ δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu, 0.1-1.4, 0.5 ± 0.1‰ ( N = 7); δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn/ <SUP>64</SUP>Zn ≡ δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn = 0.2-1.9, 1.2 ± 0.2‰ ( N = 8; 10017 excluded). For two terrestrial samples, we find δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn ̃ +0.3‰ and δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu ̃ 0‰, which are consistent with published values. The differences between the lunar basalts and terrestrial basalts could reflect minor, planetary-scale vaporization or igneous processes on the Moon. Data for size separates of the pyroclastic glasses 74001 and 74220 confirm the well-known surface correlation of Cu and Zn, but modeling calculations reveal no sharp differences between either the elemental ratios or the isotopic composition of grain interiors and exteriors. The absence of such differences indicates that the isotopic compositions for bulk samples are dominated by a light-isotope-rich surface component. Data for size separates of lunar soils also confirm the surface correlation of Cu and Zn, but an enrichment of heavy rather than light isotopes. Averages for bulk lunar soils from this work and the literature are (‰): δ <SUP>65</SUP>Cu, from 1.4 to 4.1, average 3.0 ± 0.3 ( N = 9); δ <SUP>66</SUP>Zn, from 2.2 to 6.4, average 4.0 ± 0.3 ( N = 14). As with the glasses, in all but soil 15231 our data show no strong differences between the isotopic composition of soil sub-samples with small and large grains. The size of the isotopic fractionation inferred for the surface component in the soils is 3× smaller than predicted by a published model of sputtering primarily by solar particles. At the same time, the observed fractionation is larger than predicted by calculations based on a model of micrometeorite impact heating and hydrodynamic quenching. Because impact heating appears unable to explain the observations, we conclude that sputtering must be important even though samples with very large isotopic fractionation of Cu and Zn have not yet been found.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2009.05.067

J.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|224|3-4|399|Abundances of the highly siderophile elements (HSE) Re, Ir, Os, Ru, Pt and Pd were determined for etchates and residues of highly purified lunar orange (74220 and 74001,1217 and 1218) and green (15421,65 and 15426,164) volcanic glasses. Most etchates have >100 pg/g Os and Ir, and in some instances have HSE concentrations that approach chondritic relative abundances. Some etchates also have <SUP>187</SUP>Os/ <SUP>188</SUP>Os within the range of chondritic meteorites. In contrast, most residues have Os concentrations of <50 pg/g and have considerably suprachondritic <SUP>187</SUP>Os/ <SUP>188</SUP>Os ratios. The disparities in Os isotopic compositions between etchates and residues reflect the presence of at least two components in each of the glass fractions. The components are interpreted to be the indigenous lunar glasses and a meteoritic contaminant. Mixing models suggest the indigenous components in orange and green glasses have Os concentrations ≤25 pg/g. Compared to terrestrial rocks with comparable MgO contents, the concentration estimates suggest the lunar mantle sources of the volcanic glasses were depleted in HSE by at least a factor of 20 relative to the terrestrial mantle, consistent with Os and Ir concentrations in the lunar mantle of ≤0.15 ng/g. The HSE depletion in the lunar mantle indicates that it may be missing a substantial share of late accreted materials. The depletion is best explained as a consequence of the early formation of the lunar crust and subsequent isolation of the lunar mantle from late accreted materials. Given that the lunar crust was largely formed by 4.4 Ga, this suggests a preponderance of late accreted materials were added to the Earth-Moon system subsequent to 4.4 Ga, and requires a substantial influx of mass into the inner solar system more than 150 Ma after the formation of the solar system.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2004.05.036
2003EAEJA.....7064H|2003|Osmium isotopes and highly siderophile elements in lunar glasses|Horan, M., Walker, R., Shearer, C., Papike, J.|EGS - AGU - EUG Joint Assembly|||7064|The absolute and relative abundances of the highly siderophile elements (HSE) present in planetary mantles are primarily controlled by silicate-metal partitioning during core-mantle differentiation and by later planetary accretion. Constraints on HSE distributions in the lunar mantle will provide insights to the formation and late accretionary history of not only the Moon, but also Earth. Because no samples of the lunar mantle have been collected, the only materials presently available for constraining mantle abundances are lunar volcanic rocks. The Apollo 15 green and Apollo 17 orange glasses are spherules derived from fire-fountain eruptions of mare basalts. These glasses are more primitive than the mare basalts, and probably were derived by the melting of cumulate assemblages from the lunar magma ocean in the deep interior (> 400 km). Despite our limited understanding of mantle-melt partitioning of the HSE, even for terrestrial systems, these glasses provide the best hope for constraining the HSE composition of the lunar interior. We report Os isotopic composition data and Re, Os, Ir, Ru, Pt and Pd isotope dilution concentration data for green glass (15426,164) and orange glass (74001,1217). Absolute and relative abundances of HSE are variable. The green glass has elemental ratios of the HSE and an Os isotopic composition within the range defined by chondritic meteorites, suggesting that the HSE were dominated by a meteoritic contaminant. This sample probably provides little information about the lunar interior, but may help constrain the types of meteorites impacting the lunar surface. Two size fractions (180-325 mesh and 75-180 mesh) of the orange glass were analyzed. HSE patterns for both size fractions are fractionated, having higher chondrite-normalized abundances of Pt and Pd, compared with Os and Ir. The supra-chondritic 187Os/188Os ratio (0.1339) of the finer fraction indicates modestly fractionated Re/Os relative to chondritic. The coarser size fraction has greater depletions in Os and Ir, and more radiogenic 187Os/188Os, indicating substantially fractionated Re/Os since its formation. These features of the coarser orange glass most likely reflect a signature dominantly from the deep lunar mantle. Abundances of Pt and Pd of both size fractions of orange glass are factors of 3-10 less than terrestrial rocks with similar MgO and may indi-cate somewhat lower abundances of HSE in the lunar mantle relative to the terrestrial mantle.|

Also included in the set is the well-documented lunar basalt 75075, collected near the Camelot Crater. Indigenous lunar N abundances are low (at ppm level), but there is some variation between glass-rich cores, mare basalts and anorthosites. The uniform indigenous N isotopic signature of δ <SUP>15</SUP>N=+13.0±1.2‰, is consistent with data reported previously for Shorty Crater samples. The indigenous δ <SUP>15</SUP>N cannot account for the light nitrogen component, observed in the lunar regolith samples. We have determined cosmic-ray production rates P( <SUP>15</SUP>N) for the above rocks and the drill core samples. The average production rate estimate (for low shielding) of P( <SUP>15</SUP>N)=5.8±0.6 pg <SUP>15</SUP>N/g/Ma is ̃60% higher than published lunar <SUP>15</SUP>N production rates, but consistent with the meteoritic production rate derived from silicates in the Enon meteorite, when normalized to 2π-irradiation geometry.

1999nvm..conf....1A|1999|Prospecting for Lunar Resources with Global Geochemical and Multispectral Data|Allen, C. C.|New Views of the Moon 2: Understanding the Moon Through the Integration of Diverse Datasets|||1|Laboratory experiments have demonstrated correlations between the abundances of some lunar resources and specific chemical and mineralogical parameters of surface materials. Global remote sensing from the Apollo, Galileo, Clementine, and Lunar Prospector missions, combined with Earth-based observations, has now quantified these parameters. Combining experiments and remote sensing allows the first prospecting for resources across the entire lunar surface. The Moon's rocks and soil contain resources that could be used to support a future lunar base for research or for launching expeditions into deep space. Lunar O is the resource most likely to be exploited first, for both propulsion and life support. The efficiency of O extraction from lunar materials has been shown to depend strongly on the material's chemical and mineralogical composition.Some lunar materials may be rare and vital enough on Earth to justify the cost of their return. The rare isotope He-3, which can be used in an efficient and low-polluting fusion power reaction, has been cited as one such resource. Over 20 different processes have been proposed for O production on the Moon. Among the simplest and best studied of these processes is the reduction of oxides in lunar minerals and glass using H gas. It was reported that the results of O extraction experiments on 16 lunar soils. Each sample was reacted in flowing H for 3 h at 1050 C. Total O yield correlated strongly to each sample's initial Fe2+ abundance. A linear least-squares fit of O yield vs. Fe2+ for 16 lunar soils yielded a regression line with a slope of 0.19, an intercept of 0.55 wt% O and an r-square value of 0.87. Oxygen yield did not significantly correlate with the abundance of any element except Fe. Thus, O yield from lunar soils can be predicted with nearly 90% confidence based solely on their iron abundances. The potential for O production at any location on the Moon can be predicted if the soil's Fe concentration is known. On a global scale, Fe concentration in the near surface has been estimated from data returned by a variety of spacecraft. Iron was one of several elements measured from near equatorial orbits during the Apollo 15 and 16 missions, using gamma ray spectrometry. These data covered approximately 20% of the lunar surface, with spatial resolutions of about 100 km. An improved gamma ray spectrometer and a neutron spectrometer, flown on the Lunar Prospector spacecraft in a polar orbit, provided Fe abundance data for the entire lunar surface, again at a spatial resolution of about 100 km. A technique for iron assessment based on orbital multispectral imaging has been developed. This method correlates Fe abundance to a parameter derived from reflectance values at 750 and900nm. The authors use data from the Clementine spacecraft to map Fe abundances across nearly the entire lunar surface. These data can support identification of Fe-rich regions as small as a few hundred meters across. Researchers find good agreement between gamma-ray/neutron and multispectral Fe determinations for most areas on the Moon. The H-reduction experiments cited above also showed submillimeter volcanic glass beads could be highly desirable feedstocks for lunar O production. Iron-rich species, represented by glassy (orange) and crystalline (black) beads, promise particularly high O yields. Apollo 17 volcanic glass sample 74220, composed predominantly of orange glass beads with an average diameter of 40 mm, contains 17.8 wt% Fe2+. Reduction of this sample yielded 4.3 wt% O, well above the regression line defined by the experiments on 16 lunar soils. Sample 74001 is dominated by black crystalline beads, the isochemical equivalent of orange glasses. Reduction of 74001 yielded 4.7 wt% O, the highest value for any lunar sample. Extensive areas of the lunar surface covered by volcanic glass beads have been delineated using Earth based data and spacecraft orbital photography. Chemical compositions of the deposits have been estimated and mixing ratios of glassy and crystalline glass beads have been determined. Clementine multispectral imagery has been employed to determine the precise extent and estimate the thickness of one widespread deposit, that of the Aristarchus Plateau. Lunar ice could prove to be a highly advantageous O source, compared to O derived from soil reduction, in terms of process complexity and power requirements. Thus, a deposit of ice on the Moon is a potentially important resource.Permanently shadowed polar craters have been modeled as possible cold traps for water ice, derived either from indigenous sources or from comets. Any lunar ice deposits must occur in extremely restricted areas near the poles. Only crater interiors that are permanently shadowed from sunlight are cold enough to have retained volatiles for a significant part of the Moon's history. Clementine images and Earth-based radar have demonstrated that craters whose interiors are never exposed to sunlight do exist near the lunar poles. Water ice has been tentatively identified in some of these craters using Clementine bi-static radar data. Lunar Prospector mapped the epithermal and fast-neutron fluxes across the entire Moon. Low epithermal fluxes are correlated with concentrations of H, and by extension ice, in the near-surface. Such signatures were observed near permanently-shadowed craters at both lunar poles. Calculation of the actual amount of water ice in these cold traps is strongly model-dependent but each polar region could contain as much as 3x10<SUP>9</SUP> t of water ice. The concentration of solar wind-implanted He in mare regolith increases with the soil's Ti content. This correlation is apparently due to preferential adsorption of He by ilmenite grains. Thus, Ti in mare soils is a predictor of the He-3 resource. Additional information is contained in the original.|

Equilibrium between melt and metal blebs (Fe85Ni14Co1) within the core along with Cr contents in olivine phenocrysts suggest there was an oxidation of carbon and a reduction of the melt at an oxygen fugacity of IW-1.3 and 1320 C to form CO gas at 200 bars or about 4 km depth. This was followed by development of more oxidized conditions during ascent. Also during ascent, there was formation of euhedral, homogeneous Fo81 olivine crystals and spinel crystals with higher Al and Mg contents than the smaller spinels in the crystallized beads. Both the metal blebs and Al-rich spinels were trapped inside the Fo81 olivine phenocrysts as they grew prior to eruption. The composition of the orange glasses are homogeneous throughout the core, except for a few distinct glasses at the top that appear to have been mixed in by micrometeorite reworking. A few glassy melt inclusions of orange glass composition trapped in the Fo81 phenocrysts contain 600-1100 ppm S and ~50 ppm Cl compared to the 200 ppm S and 50 ppm Cl in the orange glass melt when quenched. These inclusions therefore document the addition of 400 ppm S to the CO-rich volcanic gas during the eruption. The size and distribution of different volcanic beads in the Apollo 17 deposit indicate a mode of eruption in which the orange glasses and partially crystallized beads formed further away from the volcanic vent where cooling rates were faster. Progressively larger and more numerous crystals in the black beads reflect slower cooling rates at higher optical densities in the volcanic plume. The development of a brown texture in the orange glasses at the bottom of the core, where the black beads dominate, is interpreted to result from devitrification by subsolidus heating either as the orange glasses fell back through the hot plume or after deposition on the surface. The change from domination by orange glasses to black beads in the core probably reflects a decrease in gas content over time, which would consequently would increase the plume optical density and favor slower cooling rates.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1945-5100.1999.tb01361.x

The study of such variation requires knowledge of the antiquity of a particular sample, that is, the time when a sample was exposed to solar and lunar atmospheric particles. A practical and sensitive antiquity indicator is the ratio Ar-40/Ar-36 of trapped Ar. The authors present new data on breccia 14307 and some other soils and breccias that support a previous calibration of the evolution of Ar-40/Ar-36 with time based on the quantity of Xe-136 produced by neutron-induced fission of U-235 in soils 74001 and 74261.|

The core is a mixture of basalt and highland fragments, lithics, agglutinates, and impact and volcanic glasses. The core is significantly different from the 74001/2 core taken on the rim of the impact crater Shorty. While the 74001/2 core is composed of only orange glasses and their crystallized equivalents and therefore represents a stratigraphic section at depth, the 79001/2 core represents a mixture of components making up the regolith. Our interest in the 79001/2 core was to search for volcanic glasses and determine their relationship to those found at Shorty. Each of the 19 thin sections in the Van Serg core was studied and glasses were identified. Impact and volcanic glasses that had a unique texture were compositionally analyzed, as were 128 glasses from two thin sections in the core.|

The 74001/2 core is composed of ̃99% orange volcanic glasses and their crystallized equivalents (black beads), with olivine phenocrysts, metal blebs, and, in the upper 8 cm of the core, lithic fragments composing the remaining 1%. In an analysis of this core, twenty-nine metal blebs larger than 4 μm in size were discovered in thin sections taken along the length of the 68 cm deep core. These blebs are classified into three types on the basis of their shape, composition, and distribution. Fourteen of the metal blebs were found trapped inside or between olivine phenocrysts (Type I blebs). Microprobe analyses showed that these spherical blebs have a homogeneous composition of 85% Fe, 14% Ni, and 1.1% Co from core to rim. Six Type II rounded blebs were discovered trapped inside volcanic beads. Their core compositions are similar to the Type I but near the rim these blebs have a sharp decrease in Fe and increase in Ni content. In the lower half of the 74001/2 core where the beads are predominantly black, many contain ≤5 μm amoeba-shaped Type III metal blebs. Type III blebs are composed of Fe with trace amounts of Ni. Two angular metal fragments could not be classified into any of the three types. We propose that the Type I blebs formed initially at 4.0 km depth and 1.3 log units below IW at a pressure of 200 bars and a temperature of 1320°C by the formation of CO gas during graphite oxidation. Once trapped by olivine phenocrysts, the blebs were buffered from further reactions with the melt. The Type II blebs remained in contact with the melt during ascent and experienced loss of Fe to the surrounding melt phase by oxidation reactions which range from 1.3 to 0.9 log below IW. Finally, Type III blebs formed either by exsolution of Fe during crystallization in the fire fountain or by loss of volatiles originally coordinated with Fe to the volcanic gas phase under the reduced conditions in the fountain.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0016-7037(97)00119-1

The source(s) location and eruption conditions that produced the volcanic beads at Taurus-Littrow and other regional dark mantle deposits is still under debate. In this study, we have examined thin sections and determined the cooling histories for the volcanic beads based upon their textures. In addition, several digital elemental images were made of four of the thin sections taken at different depths within the core. Our goal is to use the petrology of the beads to determine the eruption conditions in the fire fountain and the most likely location and number of vent sources associated with the Taurus-Littrow deposit. Eventually, we intend to apply our results from the Taurus-Littrow study to other regional dark mantle deposits on the Moon using Clementine multispectral data.|

S., Kim, Y., Marti, K.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|22||215|Ilmenite and pyroxene grain-size separates from 79035 were analyzed for trapped N; the ilmenite was also analyzed for trapped Xe. Ilmenite N contains two or more isotopically distinct trapped components differing in release temperature and therefore plausibly in implantation energy. The isotopically light, higher-temperature (higher-energy?) component has a delta N-15 value equal to -180 percent, significantly above the minimum value observed in bulk 79035, suggesting that parts of 79035 were exposed on the lunar surface earlier than the ilmenite. Using trapped Ar-40/Ar-36 and cosmogenic Ne-21 (Benkert, 1989) a compaction age of about 1 Ga was derived for the ilmenite. This implies a considerably more recent exposure than previously thought, and suggests that the long-term change in delta N-15 of regolith N was more rapid than generally believed. Comparison of these results with those for black/orange glass from 74001/74002 (compaction age 3.7 Ga; delta N-15 in the range -36 to +18 percent (Kerridge et al., 1991) indicates that the long-term trend may have followed a complex evolutionary path. Data for 79035 pyroxenes are consistent with the ilmenite compaction age but suggest a more complex exposure history.|

Indigenous lunar N is found to have the same δ<SUP>15</SUP>N value as N in terrestrial mantle samples with high <SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He ratios.

The sulphur contents of the bulk samples ate much lower than those of other lunar soils. These samples, along with the surface orange soil 74220 analysed previously, show an increase of sulphur concentration with decreasing particle size which is more marked than for other soils and indicates that the orange and black glass droplets have a coating enriched in sulphur and other volatile elements. In sharp contrast with other soils, the orange and black glasses have slight positive δ<SUP>34</SUP>S values for large particles while the smallest particle sizes show negative δ<SUP>34</SUP>S values. This indicates that the coating of the glassy droplets is enriched in isotopically light sulphur.

The anomalously high δ<SUP>34</SUP>S values of the fine fractions of the core bottom sample, 74001-135, combined with the results of an acid leaching experiment, indicate that these fractions are contaminated, possibly by a mature soil of high sulphur content and relatively positive δ<SUP>34</SUP>S value.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(83)90271-5

The concentrations of the trapped noble gases are the lowest observed so far for lunar soils, and the slopes of the log concentration vs log grain size plots are the steepest known. The light noble gas isotopes are relatively more depleted, probably due to diffusion out of the glassy material. In contrast, the isotopes Ar-40, Kr-80, Kr-82, Xe-128, Xe-134, and Xe-136 are enriched relative to the corresponding isotope ratios observed in typical surface soil. These differences suggest that the surface correlated gases in the 74001/2 core are mixtures of three components: (1) particles implanted by the solar wind, (2) lunar atmospheric ions accelerated by the solar wind field and implanted into the lunar surface, and (3) products of neutron capture reactions in adsorbed lunar Br and I.|

It is concluded from the measured Au/Ir ratios and from the absence of a surface enrichment of Co that the material in the drive tube 74001/2 is not the result of an impact of an iron meteorite into a lava lake, but originated in at least three volcanic eruptions. No indication of a later disturbance of the stratigraphy of the layers is observed. Exposure ages of 345,000 and 225,000 years result from Ir deposits for the two layers of 74002.|

The track densities indicate significant reworking of the soil only to a depth of 4 cm. Allowing for 2 cms of missing material (Fruchter et al., 1978), this corresponds to a 6 cm reworking depth during the last 10 m.y. (when the material was presumably emplaced).|

A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||327|Eight siderophile elements, seven volatile elements, and U were determined in three samples from 74001 by radiochemical neutron activation analysis. The siderophile pattern closely corresponds to the addition of approximately 0.1% of II B iron meteorites, and the enrichment of nonsiderophile volatile elements seems to be derived from lunar sources with variation generally following Se content. In addition, in 74001 (predominantly black glass), moderately volatile elements (Ag, Zn) are more abundant than In, Cd, and particularly Bi, while in 74220 (mainly orange glass), Ag, Zn, In, and Cd are almost equally abundant, but Bi is as low as in 74001.|

S., Waits, G., Fuhrman, R.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1945|SEM-EDX analysis of the surface morphology of the 74001 and 74002 orange and black glassy droplets has revealed the presence of ubiquitous micromound coatings. Assuming that the diameter of an individual micromound is an indication of total coating thickness, then the thickness of this volatile and metal-rich layer ranges from less than 20 A to over 300 A in thickness. On rare droplets the micromound coating is partially covered by a sparse population of crystals and masses that are essentially NaCl in composition. Additionally, an irregular mass on the surface of one black droplet may contain free sulfur. Amoeboid masses of iron, some with incipient crystal faces, are also present on a few droplet surfaces. The above features, i.e., halite crystals, sulfur-rich masses and amoeboid iron, are rare; the more common occurrence of metals and volatiles is in the micromound coating. Based on our observations of several hundred spheres from both Apollo and Luna missions, the classic micromound coating is unique to the Apollo 15 green and Apollo 17 orange and black droplets. Although some investigators have proposed various impact sequences to produce these unique droplets, the volcanic fire fountain origin is favored.|

W.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2019|Measurements of the Al-26 and Mn-53 in interior portions of lunar rocks have shown that lunar surface processes which move a significant fraction of kilogram size rocks on the lunar surface occur on time scales of a few million years. These measurements, together with noble gas age dating have made it possible to define the history for nine rock samples selected from whole rock counting data because of anomalously low Al-26 relative to Na-22. Six of the rocks from the Apollo 15 and 16 missions showed evidence of movement during the past five million years. Of these six, only two are of an age consistent with their origin from the South Ray Crater Event. In addition, our measurements of Na-22 and Al-26 in Apollo 17 double drive tube 74001-74002 suggest that one to two cm of soil is missing from the top of this core tube. Even with this loss, at least two cm of gardening is indicated in the top portion of 74002.|

Significant reworking of the soil only occurred down to a few cm from the lunar surface since this event. Complementary investigations in this core by other groups are discussed. Most of the evidence available leads to a two stage model in which the orange and black soils collected at Shorty Crater were first irradiated for approximately 25 m.y. at some depth and then were deposited only a few m.y. ago as an overturned ejecta blanket.|

H., Waits, G.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1913|A suite of samples from the double drive tube 74001/2 has been studied. Material from this core mainly consists of orange and black droplets interpreted to be volcanic pyroclastic ejecta. Grain size analysis indicates that this material is very homogeneous in its grain size properties. It is also the finest and best sorted suite of soil samples in the lunar collection having a mean grain size of 40 microns and a mean standard deviation of 1.75 phi. The upper 5.5 cm of this core has apparently undergone in situ reworking by meteorites over a period of about 10 million years. This reworked zone contains 'exotic' grains including basalt, mineral fragments, vitric breccias, and agglutinates. One type of agglutinate is unique and has been made primarily from orange and black glass droplets melted and welded together by micrometeorite impacts. Other agglutinates are made mainly from basaltic fragments and minerals. The amount of 'exotic' material added to the core combined with an estimate of the location of the source areas for the 'exotic' material allows us to estimate that a maximum of about 0.36 gm per sq cm of regolith surface is added from a radius of about 1 meter in 10 million years. Furthermore, no more than about 0.01 gm per sq cm of regolith surface is added from a radius of about 100 meters in 10 million years.|
1978LPSC....9.1933H|1978|Petrology of a sequence of pyroclastic rocks from the valley of Taurus-Littrow (Apollo 17 landing site).|Heiken, G. H., McKay, D. S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1933|Thirteen samples of core 74001/2, collected at Shorty Crater by Apollo 17, have been analyzed. The samples, taken from the core section below 5.5 cm and representing most of the major stratigraphic units described by Nagle (1978), consist entirely of whole and fragmented orange and black droplets. The grain shape, degree of crystallinity, breakage, vesicularity, predominant olivine shapes, and phenocryst content of about 18,000 droplets were investigated. The crystalline droplets were found to contain olivine and ilmenite as major phases and pyroxene, Cr-spinel and metallic Fe as minor phases. The grain shape, degree of crystallization, olivine shape and olivine composition suggest that a wide range of cooling rates is represented. The upper part of the core section (above 5.5 cm) has undergone in situ reworking by micrometeorites. The 74001/2 samples are believed to be from an ultramafic pyroclastic deposit brought to the surface by the Shorty Crater impact and originally formed by a lava fountain active in the Taurus-Littrow valley 3.5 b.y. ago. The sequence represented in the sample was most likely deposited over a very short period of time.|

R.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1969|Double core 74001/2 soils were studied. Bulk soils and the 90-150 micrometer and less than 20 micrometer size fractions of 13 soils from the core for both major and trace elements by instrumental neutron activation analysis were analyzed. The orange and black glassy soils in the core 74001/2 are homogeneous in composition and due to their unusual compositional characteristics probably have derived from a single source with the same composition. The top of the core has been reworked to a depth of about 5 cm. The reworked layer is marked by compositional differences in the first 3 cm which reflect the addition (at least 10%) of materials including mare basalt and a CaO-rich component. The maturity profile (I<SUB>s/FeO)</SUB> clearly indicates reworking depth of about 5 cm. It is likely that at least some of the ferro-magnetically active component (including agglutinitic glass) has been 'inherited' with the added material.|

The study of the cosmic-ray-produced isotopes He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe in the basaltic rocks 74235, 74255, and 74275, in bulk soil samples from the orange soil 74220, from the gray soils 74241 and 74261, and from the black soil 74001, and in grain size separates from the black soil allows the determination of the cosmic-ray exposure history of these samples. All three rocks experienced at least a two-stage exposure as can be judged from the comparison of their irradiation geometry at the time of collection with that inferred from depth-dependent relative abundances of cosmic-ray-produced nuclei. The exposure histories of the rocks and soils are characterized by four events or periods. These results show that the Shorty impact occurred no more than 30 m.y. ago. The most probable age of this crater is 19 m.y., when the large boulder was excavated from the subfloor. The trapped solar-wind concentration in the black soil is extremely low, on the average only 0.3% of that usually found for lunar soil.|
1977LPSC....8.3113M|1977|Depositional history of core section 74001: depth profiles of maturity, FeO, and metal.|Morris, R. V., Gose, W. A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||3113|Samples from every 0.5-cm interval of soil in core section 74001 have been studied by ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and magnetic techniques. The values of the FMR maturity index show that the 74001 samples are very immature (the index ranges from 0.14 to 0.29 units) and have not seen appreciable, if any, surface exposure since their deposition. In fact, the small amount of fine-grained metal in the 74001 samples is probably not acquired as a result of their exposure to the micrometeoroid flux at the lunar surface. Thus, the black-glass soil of 74001 was deposited very rapidly, probably in a single episode or several closely spaced episodes of lunar fire fountaining. The average concentration of FeO and its standard deviation for all the 74001 samples are 22.5 + or - 0.3 wt.%. Since the FeO concentration is so uniform, no large variations in the major-element chemistry of 74001 are expected, with the possible exception of the volatile elements. The concentration of coarse-grained metal, which is measured magnetically, and its standard deviation are 0.15 + or - 0.01 wt.%. The coarse-grained metal probably precipitated contemporaneously with the silicate and oxide phases in the black-glass droplets.|
1977LPSC....8.3243H|1977|A model for eruption behavior of a volcanic vent in eastern Mare Serenitatis.|Heiken, G., McKay, D. S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||3243|The origin is considered of droplets of ultramafic composition which are present in all soils collected from the mare surface at the Apollo 17 landing site. The droplets consist of homogeneous orange glass or their partially crystallized equivalent, the black droplets. These clastic deposits have a mean grain size of 40 micrometers. The droplet formation ages range from 3.5 to 3.83 b.y. It has been proposed that the droplets formed as a spray of low viscosity melt during lava fountaining. Based upon the thermal history as determined by studying olivine and particle shapes, two models for the formation of the sequence of droplets represented by samples 74001 and 74220 are presented. Both models assume, as proposed by Heiken et al. (1974), that the droplets were formed as a spray from a lava fountain and the compound forms were evidence for 'recycling' of solid, cooler droplets back into the fountain, encountering molten droplets before being deposited.|

O., Jr., Jovanovic, S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||3917|Parallel leaching and volatilization experiments conducted on lunar samples and similar experiments on sphalerite do not supply the information needed to resolve the question of the chemical nature of Pb-204, Zn, Bi, and Tl deposits on lunar soil surfaces. It is proposed that in Apollo 17 mare and terra soils the fractions of Pb-204, Zn, and Tl that are insoluble under mild, hot pH 5 HNO3, leaching conditions and involatile at 600 C were originally surface deposits which became immobilized by migration into the silicate substrate or by chemisorption. Most of the Bi does not seem to be the result of such a deposit. The implication is also that the soils, over their respective times of evolution, were exposed to heavy metal vapors or that an episodic exposure occurred after they had evolved. A sequence of events is proposed to account for orange 74220 and black 74001 glasses by lava fountaining and for soil 74241 as tephra from an explosive volcanic eruption.|

Other Apollo 17 samples contain only a component of this material. The underlying basalt in the Taurus-Littrow valley appears to be an extension of material forming the low-albedo ring around part of Mare Serenitatis and much of the surface of Mare Tranquillitatis. The surface of this basalt region is spectrally distinct from areas with dark mantling material. These results are derived from telescopic and laboratory measurements of the optical properties of lunar soil. Digital vidicon color images are used to map the extent of these material units in the Taurus-Littrow region.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.183.4130.1191
