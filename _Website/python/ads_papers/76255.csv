Apatite and merrillite have been of particular interest, as they record vital information on the volatile content, U-Pb ages and trace-element composition of various planetary materials. However, the extent to which shock-deformation, pervasive among all planetary materials, affects the distribution of these valuable geochemical tracers is still poorly understood. Here we focus on exploring the U-Pb and Pb-Pb ages of apatite and merrillite in a set of variably shocked lunar rocks, building on previous nanostructural analyses of the phosphates.We carried out U-Pb and Pb-Pb analyses of phosphates in Apollo 17 samples of the Mg-suite rocks (76535, 76335, 76255, 72255, 78235 and 78236) using the CAMECA 1280 ion microprobe at the NordSIMS facility (Stockholm). In addition, we applied a recently developed approach of conducting high-precision U-Pb and Pb-Pb analyses by ID-TIMS of extracted phosphate grains (Jack Satterly Lab, University of Toronto). For this purpose, individual ~50x50x30 µm crystals of apatite and merrillite were extracted directly from thin sections using a Xe+ plasma FIB.As determined by SIMS, 207Pb/206Pb systematics of the unshocked or weakly shocked apatite in 76535 and 76335 is undisturbed, implying cooling of the rock below the closure temperature of Pb diffusion in apatite (~450°C) at ~4.2 Ga, ~100 Ma younger than what is interpreted as the rock's crystallization age. Phosphates that experienced similar levels of deformation but were in proximity or in direct contact with the impact melt in samples 76255 and 72255 show almost complete age resetting (~3.92 Ga). The SIMS determined age of 16 phosphates in sample 76255 is 3922.2 ± 6.7 Ma (2σ) and agrees with the previously published 207Pb/206Pb phosphate ages of impact melt breccias found within the same boulder and was interpreted as the timing of the Imbrium impact. These recrystallized phosphates yield comparable TIMS Pb-Pb ages (3917.8 ± 1.8 Ma and 3921.0 ± 1.3 Ma, 2σ) with significantly lower internal uncertainties than that of the individual SIMS measurements and may represent multiple impact-events close to the Imbrium event.SIMS U-Pb analyses of highly shocked phosphates (78235 and 78236) reveal a discordia line with an upper intercept of ~4.2 Ga and a lower intercept of ~0.5 Ga. We interpret this new, younger age as a minor thermal event that reactivated existing shock-induced nm-scale grain boundaries, as visualised by APT, within the apatite population to allow for Pb-loss at ~0.5 Ga. We propose a small crater located near the Apollo 17 landing site as a possible source of this sample.By correlating micro- to nanostructural characterization with in-situ age systematics we show that apatite and merrillite are powerful thermochronometers that provide a new approach to dating which has the potential to discriminate between temporally similar events. This can greatly aid in unravelling the bombardment record of solar system and be helpful when dealing with samples of limited availability (e.g. space return missions).|

K.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|88||603|Mg-suite noritic rocks can be divided into two groups, the Mg-gabbronorites and the Mg-norites. The rocks of these groups differ in ratios of high-Ca pyroxene to total pyroxene, compositions of pyroxene and plagioclase, assemblages of Ti-, Nb-, and Zr-bearing minerals, compositions of chrome spinel, bulk-rock Ti/Sm and Sc/Sm, and measured ages. The two groups probably crystallized from different types of parent magmas. Two hypotheses are offered for the differences in composition of the parent magmas. One hypothesis ascribes the differences to compositional heterogeneity of the mantle source areas. The other hypothesis ascribes the differences to variations in extent of partial melting of the mantle source regions and variations in extent of assimilation of the anorthosite and the highly differentiated residual liquid that were produced during the primordial lunar differentiation.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB088iS02p0A603
1983LPSC...13..887L|1983|A Two-Pyroxene Thermometer|Lindsley, D. H., Andersen, D. J.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|88||887|Experimentally determined pyroxene phase relations at 800°-1200°C are combined with calculated phase equilibria for the Di-En and Hd-Fs joins to produce a graphical two-pyroxene thermometer that should be applicable to a wide variety of rocks from the earth, moon, and meteorites. The thermometer can be used directly with natural pyroxenes that have low contents of Al and other minor components. Samples with higher contents of ‘others’ components require special projection onto the Ca-Mg-Fe pyroxene quadrilateral; Wo, En, and Fs as normally calculated will not yield correct temperatures! The special projection is necessary to approximate the activities of those components in natural pyroxenes. The effects of pressure are nonnegligible but can be corrected for. Use of the thermometer for slowly-cooled rocks may pose special problems if the pyroxenes have undergone granule exsolution (coalescence of exsolved material to form separate grains). For example, published analyses of Mg-rich augites from the Skaergaard intrusion give temperatures that are 50°-100°C below expected magmatic values. Textural and experimental evidence confirms that these augites have undergone granule exsolution. The primary pyroxene compositions must be reconstructed from textural evidence before correct igneous or peak-metamorphic temperatures can be obtained from this or any two-pyroxene thermometer. Of the numerous two-pyroxene thermometers proposed in the literature, those of Ross and Huebner [1975] and of Kretz [1982] Ca-reaction] yield temperatures most similar to our own, although the former tends to give temperatures about 50°C lower for some igneous pyroxenes. Other thermometers generally overestimate temperatures for metamorphic rocks (hornblende granulite facies) by 50°-100°C.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB088iS02p0A887

1980LPSC...11..591W|1980|Significance of major and minor element variations in plagioclase in sodic ferrogabbro and breccia matrix in lunar highlands sample 67915.|Weiblen, P. W., Day, W. C., Miller, J. D., Jr.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||591|Attention is given to the significance of the results of a study of Ca, K, Ti, Fe, Mn, and Mg variations in plagioclase in highlands sample 67915,84. This polymict breccia from Outhouse Rock station 11 at the Apollo 16 site has been selected for study because it contains a wide variety of clast types, including a differentiated type-sodic ferrogabbro. It is found that the data on Ca, K, Ti, Fe, Mn, and Mg in plagioclase show no evidence of reaction between sodic ferrogabbro and breccia matrix clasts. Two groups of plagioclase compositions have been recognized in the breccia matrix. The data suggest that the prebreccia characteristics of plagioclase compositions have been preserved in 67915. Data on Mg/(Mg+FE) ratios suggest that the sodic ferrogabbro and the intermediate-Ca plagioclase clasts could be related to the Mg-rich plutonic rock suite and the high-Ca plagioclase clasts to the ferroan anorthosites.|
1980LPSC...11..365J|1980|Rocks of the early lunar crust.|James, O. B.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||365|Data are summarized which suggest a model for the early evolution of the lunar crust. According to the model, during the final stages of accretion, the outer part of the moon melted to form a magma ocean approximately 300 km deep. This ocean fractionated to form mafic and ultramafic cumulates at depth and an overlying anorthositic crust made up of ferroan anorthosites. Subsequent partial melting in the primitive mantle underlying the crystallized magma ocean produced melts which segregated, moved upward, intruded the primordial crust, and crystallized to form layered plutons consisting of Mg-rich plutonic rocks. Intense impact bombardment at the lunar surface mixed and melted the rocks of the two suites to form a thick layer of granulated debris, granulitic breccias, and impact-melt rocks.|
1980LPSC...11..481P|1980|The meteoritic contamination of terrestrial and lunar impact melts and the problem of indigenous siderophiles in the lunar highland.|Palme, H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||481|It is noted that similarities in chemistry and texture between terrestrial and lunar impact melts can be extended to meteoritic elements. The absolute amount of the meteoritic contamination, as well as the observed variations in concentrations of meteoritic elements in the Apollo 17 melt sheet, is comparable to what is observed in some large terrestrial melt sheets. In favorable cases, concentrations of siderophile meteoritic elements in the basement (indigenous component) can be found on the basis of correlations of two meteoritic elements in impact melt samples. Indigenous Ni and Co concentrations found in this way for the Apollo 17 melt are, respectively, 40 + or - 15 ppm Ni and 21.6 + or - 3.5 ppm Co. It is noted that these values are consistent with a chondritic Ni/Co ratio of the projectile.|

H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||507|A coarse-grained plagioclase-pyroxene gabbro (61224,6) with a cumulate texture suggestive of a slowly cooled plutonic rock was recovered from the 4-10 mm fraction of an Apollo 16 soil. The rock is uncommonly poor in feldspar and rich in Na for a lunar highlands lithology. Trace element analyses show extremely low siderophile element concentrations which confirm the pristine character indicated by the texture. The composition of 61224,6 is compared with those of 3 other pristine, exceptionally mafic, nonmare gabbros and of certain eucrites. 61224,6 and the three other gabbros have notable chemical differences but share relatively high ratios of Ti/Sm and Sc/Sm which suggest a possible genetic relationship. We conclude that 61224,6 represents a Na-rich cumulate from a layered intrusion within the highlands crust.|

D., Ryder, G.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||531|The petrology and geochemistry of pristine lunar highlands rock samples consisting of ferroan anorthosites, norites, troctolites, spinel troctolites/dunite/lherzolite, and KREEP, are described. In addition, petrographic and chemical evidence is presented which shows that low-siderophile rocks are the result of endogenous igneous activity and not impact melt differentiation. For example, these rocks contain Fe-metal as a late-crystallizing phase, and have W/La ratios higher than polymict breccias.|

J.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||713|A study of two clasts of coarse-grained anorthositic-noritic-troctolitic-suite norites from the fragment-laden melt rock 73255 is presented. Both clasts are igneous rocks crystallized from melts that were probably internally generated; clast 27,80 is a cumulate, and the parent magmas of both rocks probably crystallized below the lunar surface. Despite similar history, the parent rocks of the two clasts appear to be derived from distinct magma types: the 27,80 is characterized by plagioclase and orthopyroxene as the major constituents and by a high K, Nb, and Zr content, while the 27,45 type also contains augite and has a low content of K, Nb, and Zr.|

Apart from being of interest in its own right, such a comparison provides a test of Delano and Ringwood's (1979) contention that 'abundances of Ge, Au, and other siderophile elements in pristine highland rocks are not consistent with magmatic differentiation'. The other topics reexamined in this paper are the correlation of siderophiles and volatiles in pristine rocks with Rb and Cs (likewise questioned by Delano and Ringwood), the relationship of 'non-mare' basalts (14053, 60639) to their mare counterparts, and the abundance of some incompatible elements in the lunar bulk.|

1978E&PSL..38..373G|1978|Origin of magnetization in lunar breccias: An example of thermal overprinting|Gose, W. A., Strangway, D. W., Pearce, G. W.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|38|2|373|Twenty six samples from seven hand specimens, collected from the station 6 boulder at the Apollo 17 landing site, were studied magnetically. The boulder is a breccia consisting of three lithologic units distinguished by their clast population. The direction of magnetization of samples from unit B which is almost devoid of large clasts cluster fairly well after alternating field demagnetization. Samples from unit C which is characterized by abundant large clasts up to 1 m in size do not contain a uniform direction of magnetization but the distribution is not random. Based on these data we propose that the natural remanent magnetization (NRM) in these breccias is the vector sum of two magnetizations, a pre-impact magnetization and a partial thermoremanence acquired during breccia formation. The relative contribution of the two components is controlled by the thermal history of the ejecta, which in turn is determined by its clast population. Depending on the clast population, the NRM can be a total thermoremanence, a partial thermoremanence plus a pre-impact magnetization, or a pre-impact magnetization. This model of thermal overprinting might be applicable to all lunar breccias of medium and higher metamorphic grade.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(78)90111-5
