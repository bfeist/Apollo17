After traversing the landing site during the first two lunar days, four different areas are detected, and Level 2A and 2B radiance data have been released to the scientific community. The released data have been processed by dark current subtraction, correction for the effect of temperature, radiometric calibration and geometric calibration. We emphasize approaches for reflectance analysis and mineral identification for in-situ analysis with VNIS. Then the preliminary spectral and mineralogical results from the landing site are derived. After comparing spectral data from VNIS with data collected by the M<SUP>3</SUP> instrument and samples of mare that were returned from the Apollo program, all the reflectance data have been found to have similar absorption features near 1000 nm except lunar sample 71061. In addition, there is also a weak absorption feature between 1750~2400 nm on VNIS, but the slopes of VNIS and M<SUP>3</SUP> reflectance at longer wavelengths are lower than data taken from samples of lunar mare. Spectral parameters such as Band Centers and Integrated Band Depth Ratios are used to analyze mineralogical features. The results show that detection points E and N205 are mixtures of high-Ca pyroxene and olivine, and the composition of olivineat point N205 is higher than that at point E, but the compositions of detection points S3 and N203 are mainly olivine-rich. Since there are no obvious absorption features near 1250 nm, plagioclase is not directly identified at the landing site.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1674-4527/14/12/007

V.|New Views of the Moon 2: Understanding the Moon Through the Integration of Diverse Datasets|||32|The effects of space weathering on the optical properties of lunar materials have been well documented. These effects include a reddened continuum slope, lowered albedo, and attenuated absorption features in reflectance spectra of lunar soils as compared to finely comminuted rocks from the same Apollo sites. However, the regolith processes that cause these effects are not well known, nor is the petrographic setting of the products of these processes fully understood. A Lunar Soil Characterization Consortium has been formed with the purpose of systematically integrating chemical and mineralogical data with the optical properties of lunar soils. Understanding space-weathering effects is critical in order to fully integrate the lunar sample collection with remotely-sensed data from recent robotic missions (e.g., Lunar Prospector, Clementine, and Galileo) We have shown that depositional processes (condensation of impact-derived vapors, sputter deposits, accreted impact material, e.g., splash glass, spherules, etc.) are a major factor in the modification of the optical surfaces of lunar regolith materials. In mature soils, it is the size and distribution of the nanophase metal in the soil grains that has the major effect on optical properties. In this report, we compare and contrast the space-weathering effects in an immature and a mature soil with similar elemental compositions. For this study, we analyzed <10 micron sieve fractions of two Apollo 17 soils, 79221 (mature, Is/FeO = 81) and 71061 (immature, Is/FeO = 14). Details of the sieving procedures and allocation scheme are given else where. The results of other detailed chemical, mineralogical, and spectroscopic analyses of these soil samples are reported elsewhere. A representative sample of each soil was embedded in low-viscosity epoxy, and thin sections (about 70nm thick) were obtained through ultra microtomy. The thin sections used for these analyses typically contained cross sections of up to 500 individual grains. The thin sections were studied using a JEOL 2010 transmission electron microscope (TEM) equipped with a thin window energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer. An individual thin section was selected from each soil, and for each grain in the section we determined (1) the elemental composition by EDX; (2) whether the grain was crystalline or glassy using electron diffraction and darkfield imaging; (3) the presence or absence of rims and accreted material; and (4) the distribution of nanophase Fe where present. Most of the categories are self-evident; however, we divide the agglutinate derived material into agglutinitic glass (glass with approximately the same composition as the bulk soil that contains nanophase Fe with or without vesicles) and agglutinate fragments, which are composed of crystalline grains and agglutinitic glass. Lithic fragments are defined as polymineralic grains with no glass. Pyroxene grains have been divided into high- and low-Ca groups. As expected, there are a number of differences in the petrography of the <10-microns fractions of 79221 and 71061 given the great difference in their respective maturities, but we focus here on two major distinctions: agglutinate content and the number of grains with micropatina. Slightly over 50% of the particles in 79221 consist of agglutinitic glass and agglutinate fragments, while the remainder are predominantly crystalline mineral grains. The agglutinic glass particles contain abundant nanophase Fe and vesicles. Angular particles are rare, with most showing smooth, rounded exteriors, Of the mineral grains analyzed thus far, over 90% of the grains have amorphous rims that contain nanophase Fe (these rims are believed to have formed by vapor deposition and irradiation effects). The nanophase Fe in these rims probably accounts for a significant fraction of the increase in Is/FeO measured in these size fractions. In addition to the rims, the majority of particles also show abundant accreted material in the form of glass splashes and spherules that also contain nanophase Fe. In stark contrast, the surfaces of the mineral grains in the 71061 sample are relatively prisitine, as only about 14% of the mineral grains in the sample exhibited amorphous rims. Furthermore, the mineral particles are more angular and show greater surface roughness than in the mature sample. Accreted material on particle surfaces is rare. Agglutinitic material is a major component of the 71061 sample; however, nanophase Fe and vesicles are not as well developed as in the 79221 sample. It is now recognized that nanophase Fe is probably the main agent in modifying the optical properties of lunar soil grains. The most important result of this study is the observation that in the fine size fractions of mature soils, nearly every grain has nanophase Fe within 100 run of the particle surface.

M.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||2911|The mid infrared emittance spectrum contains compositional information about lunar soils. In order to be able to properly interpret remotely obtained data, it was necessary to develop a theoretical model of the emittance of particulate minerals. This theory was shown to simulate the spectra of analog lunar soils satisfactorily provided that good values of the optical constants of the component minerals were available. Optical constants have been obtained for dunite, bytownite, augite, ilmenite, and a mare glass analog during this work. Our first measurements on lunar soils indicated that 67711 is very immature (high contrast) and is dominated by feldspar; that 10084 shows very low contrast with some evidence of pyroxene and feldspar bands. 71061 is intermediate between the other two having a gross similarity to 10084 but with considerably more contrast.|

B.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||405|The inquiry is centered on the composition of agglutinate glasses examined via microprobe techniques. The glass chemistry of the agglutinates is brought into relation with compositions of constituent detritus and bulk compositions of the parent soils, with recent reported results taken into cognizance. Electron microprobe analysis data were examined for possible chemical fractionation resulting from meteoritic impacts and formation of agglutinates in the lunar regolith; individual agglutinates from lunar soils 78222, 71061, and 60009 were probed. Differences between impact glasses and corresponding bulk soils were scrutinized. Agglutinate glass analyses tend to cluster near the bulk soil compositions. A slight enrichment in mafic elements in grand averages of the agglutinate clusters relative to the bulk soils was found. Evidence of total impact melts and minor partial shock melts is examined.|
