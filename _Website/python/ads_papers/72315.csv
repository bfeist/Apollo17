1980LPSC...11..481P|1980|The meteoritic contamination of terrestrial and lunar impact melts and the problem of indigenous siderophiles in the lunar highland.|Palme, H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||481|It is noted that similarities in chemistry and texture between terrestrial and lunar impact melts can be extended to meteoritic elements. The absolute amount of the meteoritic contamination, as well as the observed variations in concentrations of meteoritic elements in the Apollo 17 melt sheet, is comparable to what is observed in some large terrestrial melt sheets. In favorable cases, concentrations of siderophile meteoritic elements in the basement (indigenous component) can be found on the basis of correlations of two meteoritic elements in impact melt samples. Indigenous Ni and Co concentrations found in this way for the Apollo 17 melt are, respectively, 40 + or - 15 ppm Ni and 21.6 + or - 3.5 ppm Co. It is noted that these values are consistent with a chondritic Ni/Co ratio of the projectile.|

It is shown that the six types of individual textural units found in terrestrial impact formations are subunits of three structural groups of breccia formations which differ in their crater setting.|

A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2335|The paper presents petrographic and mineralogical data for five samples from Boulder 2 (72315, 72335, 72355, 72375, and 72395) and sample 72435 from Boulder 3 at Apollo 17 Station 2. All the samples were found to consist of a few percent megaclasts set in a fine-grained matrix, which is comprised of microclasts and a poikilitic to subophitic-textured groundmass that crystallized from a melt. The samples have similar modal mineralogies, mineral compositions, and bulk-chemical compositions.|

B.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||2561|It is shown that lunar rock 72315, because of its brief surface exposure age and a geometry which minimizes corrosion, makes it possible to obtain a virtually uneroded Fe spectrum, averaged over several hundred thousand years. The absolute exposure age of the rock is determined by taking into account the intensity of solar flares and galactic cosmic rays. The galactic cosmic ray production spectrum reported by Walker and Yuhas (1973) is used in the determination of the exposure age.|
