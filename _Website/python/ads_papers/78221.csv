1992ga17.conf....1A|1992|Lunar Resources-Oxygen from Rocks and Soil|Allen, C. C., Gibson, M. A., Knudsen, C. W., Kanamori, H., Morris, R. V., Keller, L. P., McKay, D. S.|Geology of the Apollo 17 Landing Site|||1|The first set of hydrogen reduction experiments to use actual lunar material was recently completed. The sample, 70035, is a coarse-grained vesicular basalt containing 18.46 wt. percent FeO and 12.97 wt. percent TiO2. The mineralogy includes pyroxene, ilmenite, plagioclase, and minor olivine. The sample was crushed to a grain size of less than 500 microns. The crushed basalt was reduced with hydrogen in seven tests at temperatures of 900-1050 C and pressures of 1-10 atm for 30-60 minutes. A capacitance probe, measuring the dew point of the gas stream, was used to follow reaction progress. Experiments were also conducted using a terrestrial basalt similar to some lunar mare samples. Minnesota Lunar Simulant (MLS-1) contains 13.29 wt. percent FeO, 2.96 wt. percent Fe2O3, and 6.56 wt. percent TiO2. The major minerals include plagioclase, pyroxene, olivine, ilmenite, and magnetite. The rock was ground and seived, and experiments were run on the less than 74- and 500-1168-micron fractions. Experiments were also conducted on less than 74-micron powders of olivine, pyroxene, synthetic ilmenite, and TiO2. The terrestrial rock and mineral samples were reduced with flowing hydrogen at 1100 C in a microbalance furnace, with reaction progress monitored by weight loss. Experiments were run at atmospheric pressure for durations of 3-4 hr. Solid samples from both sets of experiments were analyzed by Mossbauer spectroscopy, petrographic microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, tunneling electron microscopy, and x-ray diffraction. Apollo 17 soil 78221 was examined for evidence of natural reduction in the lunar environment. This sample was chosen based on its high maturity level (I<SUB>s/FeO</SUB> = 93.0). The FeO content is 11.68 wt. percent and the TiO2 content is 3.84 wt. percent. A polished thin section of the 90-150 micron size fraction was analyzed by petrographic microscopy and scanning electron microscopy.|

C.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|12||371|A progress report is presented concerning an investigation involving a comprehensive chemical and petrologic study of surface soils from all nine lunar sampling sites. The soils selected for this study are part of the lunar highlands soils suite and represent the soils at each site that contain abundant highland-derived material. The current report takes into consideration, in addition to the eight soils discussed by Labotka et al. (1980) and by Laul and Papike (1980), three Apollo 17 soils (72501, 76501, and 78221), and three Luna soils (21000, L-16; 22001, L-20; and 24999, L-24). Attention is given to the modal petrology of the 1000-90 micrometer fraction of all 14 soils, and the modes and mineral and glass chemistries of the 90-20 and 20-10 micrometer fractions of the Apollo 17 and Luna soils. In an evaluation of the obtained results, it is found that except for rare, large-scale impacts, lateral mixing is an inefficient process. Comminution and vertical mixing appear to be the dominant process.|
