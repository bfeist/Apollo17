2017AJ....153..274H|2017|Isotopic Evidence for Multi-stage Cosmic-ray Exposure Histories of Lunar Meteorites: Long Residence on the Moon and Short Transition to the Earth|Hidaka, Hiroshi, Sakuma, Keisuke, Nishiizumi, Kunihiko, Yoneda, Shigekazu|The Astronomical Journal|153|6|274|It is known that most lunar meteorites have complicated cosmic-ray exposure experiences on the Moon and in space. In this study, cosmic-ray irradiation histories of six lunar meteorites, Dhofar 489, Northwest Africa 032 (NWA 032), NWA 479, NWA 482, NWA 2995, and NWA 5000, were characterized from neutron-captured isotopic shifts of Sm and Gd, and from the abundances of long-lived cosmogenic radionuclides like <SUP>10</SUP>Be, <SUP>26</SUP>Al, <SUP>36</SUP>Cl, and <SUP>41</SUP>Ca. Sm and Gd isotopic data of all of six meteorites show significant isotopic shifts of <SUP>149</SUP>Sm-<SUP>150</SUP>Sm and <SUP>157</SUP>Gd-<SUP>158</SUP>Gd caused by accumulation of neutron capture reactions due to cosmic-ray irradiation, corresponding to the neutron fluences of (1.3-9.6) × 10<SUP>16</SUP> n cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. In particular, very large Sm and Gd isotopic shifts of NWA 482 are over those of a lunar regolith 70002, having the largest isotopic shifts among the Apollo regolith samples, corresponding to cosmic-ray exposure duration over 800 million years in the lunar surface (2π irradiation). Meanwhile, the concentrations of cosmogenic radionuclides for individual six meteorites show the short irradiation time less than one million years as their bodies in space (4π irradiation). Our data also support the results of previous studies, revealing that most of lunar meteorites have long exposure ages at shallow depths on the Moon and short transit times from the Moon to the Earth.|http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/aa7139

The agglutinate sequence suggests a scenario in which several closely-spaced depositional events were involved in the formation of the drill core, rather than a continuous accumulation process.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB089iS01p0C161

S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|12||519|A description is presented of data and new calculations which support the idea that the Apollo 17 drill string has a long depositional history. Attention is given to a new interpretation, that a very ancient avalanche was a major depositional event in the history of the core. Important implications for composition of soil components then result from the avalanche interpretation. It is pointed out that single-slab deposition of the entire Apollo 17 drill string would require some extremely unusual events, including preferential disappearance of a 75-150 m crater, and redeposition of 11 oriented features in an upright, instead of the normal overturned position. It appears to be more likely that the oldest valley floor surface is the basalt-rich zone below 275 cm.|

J.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1395|It is shown that the Apollo 17 drill core 70009-70001 is heterogeneous with depth, containing five stratigraphic units, and has a bulk soil chemistry governed by the coarse fractions because of their greater weight proportions. The four components (1) KREEP, (2) anorthositic gabbro, (3) mare basalt, and (4) orange glass are used to model the compositions of the coarse and fine fractions of the entire drill core. It is found that the chemistry of the fused soil component in the five stratigraphic units is more similar to the chemistry of the fine, less than 20-micron fractions than the coarse fraction, suggesting that agglutinates may prefferentially meld and replicate the chemistry of the finer size fractions. The sources of Zn are the orange/black glasses, and the Zn profile is anticorrelated with the maturity index of Morris et al (1979), indicating the liberation of Zn during soil maturation.|

W.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1497|Measurements of Al-26 and Mn-53 in the Apollo 17 drive tube 76001 show a clear integral excess of activity above expected production down to a depth of at least 9 gm/sq cm. This excess is interpreted as a continuous accretion of highly irradiated surface material slowly transported downslope by impact or other processes at a buildup rate of 1.5 cm/m.y. This drive tube, 76001, was collected near a change in slope on the North Massif. Integral excesses have also been observed in other Apollo 16 and 17 cores. Evidence in the Al-26 and Mn-53 record for continuous accretion is shown for Apollo 16 cores 60007 and 60010 and the Apollo 16 deep drill string 70009-70001. This evaluation shows that accretion at specific sites, either through continuous downslope movement or regolith material on the moon, or simply through small impact redistribution, is common on both small and large scales.|

The Apollo 15 drill core was completely filled, with a straightforward scale accurately representing in situ lunar conditions. A large void in the Apollo 16 drill core was found, although there is evidence that only the upper half of the core has been disturbed. Voids were also found in the upper part of the Apollo 17 drill core, which are explained by sample migration in the tube, and thus the scale for the core closely represents in situ lunar conditions|

N.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1435|It is established that the greatest distinction in origin of the soils in the Apollo 17 drill core is between the surface layer, down to 25 cm, and the remainder. The surface layer was not derived by the reworking of underlying material, but was deposited from elsewhere. The soils in the core below 25 cm have had similar surface histories, with first exposure to the solar wind 1.0-1.5 million years ago and accumulation of solar wind continuously over hundreds of millions of years thereafter. The soil with the least, and most ancient, surface exposure is 25-60 cm deep, while that with the greatest and most recent exposure, other than the present surface layer, lies at a depth of 110-170 cm. A major stratigraphic sequence disturbance has therefore deposited the soils in their present positions.|

J., Wyszynski, J.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1609|Twelve polished thin sections from Apollo 17 drive tube 76001 have been studied by optical petrography. The entire core is found to be mature showing little variation in depth, which is consistent with a depositional model involving slow downslope movement of the regolith by mass wasting. However, within the core some major differences are preserved between two stratigraphic units. Unit A (20-31 cm depth) is enriched in gabbroic anorthosite relative to unit B (0-20 cm depth), while unit B is enriched in KREEPY noritic breccias relative to unit A. This observation is interpreted in terms of a stratigraphy for North Massif involving a noritic breccia unit overlying a unit enriched in gabbroic anorthosite. Pronounced differences between the highland/mare ratios in drive tube 76001 and the Apollo 17 drill core separated by only 3.5 km demonstrate the relative inefficiency of lateral transport as a regolith mixing mechanism on the moon.|

A more complex depositional history consistent with cosmogenic exposure ages, sedimentology and soil maturity, which involves major cratering events as well as depositional ones over a period of more than one billion years, has been independently proposed by Langevin and Maurette (1978) and Nagle and Waltz (1979).|

W.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1243|Measurements of the cosmogenic radionuclides 22-Na, 26-Al and 53-Mn in the Apollo 17 deep drill string 70002-70009 have shown that this core sample was taken in an area of considerable recent surface activity. Measurements of 22-Na indicate that the core had not been significantly altered during its collection and subsequent handling, while measurements of the 26-Al and 53-Mn showed a very substantial excess in these isotopes in the top 25 cm and a depletion below about 50 cm. The analysis of the data indicates that a crater excavation occurred to a depth of 50 to 60 cm at the site of the deep drill string no longer that 0.5 m.y. ago, and probably 0.3 m.y. ago. Since that time, the crater has filled to a depth of about 25 cm with near-surface material which contains high concentrations of 26-Al and 53-Mn. This recent activity at the site of the Apollo 17 drill string places firm time constraints on the models developed by other investigators which describe the history of this site.|

N., Lal, D.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1253|Eighty samples from various depths of the 3-meter Apollo 17 deep drill core are analyzed using the particle track method. The track data indicate that the depositional history of the core has a time scale of 500-600 million years and is composed of a series of depositional sequences involving both slow and fast accretion as well as removal of material due to erosion events. Track parameters show a systematic trend as a function of depth: low values are observed at depths 20-70, 95-105, 165-175, 225-250 and 285 cm with high values in between, which corresponds to a repetition depth of 0.5 m. The observed variations correlate with agglutinate and FMR data.|

A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1141|With a depth resolution of about 0.5 cm, the stratigraphy of the approximately 3 m Apollo 17 deep drill core by measurement of the total FeO concentration is characterized along with the FMR surface exposure (maturity) index Is/FeO, the metallic iron concentration Fe-vsm, and the FMR linewidth delta-H. For stratigraphic characterization, the first two parameters are the most important. Most of the core is characterized by a FeO concentration of approximately 15.5 wt. %; there is a more mafic zone in the upper approximately 75 cm where the maximum FeO concentration is approximately 18.5 wt. %, and a more felsic zone between approximately 225 and 260 cm where the minimum FeO concentration is approximately 14.0%. As indicated by Is/FeO, most of the soil in the core is submature to mature; the only immature zone is located between approximately 20 and 60 cm and is one of the most distinctive features in the core. A two stage model for the depositional and evolutionary history of the Apollo 17 deep drill core is proposed: (1) deposition by one event approximately 110 m.y. ago or deposition by a sequence of closely spaced events initating a maximum of approximately 200 m.y. ago and terminating approximately 110 m.y. ago, (2) in situ reworking (gardening) to a depth of approximately 26 cm in the period between approximately 110 m.y. ago and the present day.|

The lower 2 meters of this core do not appear to have been emplaced rapidly as suggested by other authors. The model of Crozaz and Plachy (1976) for the emplacement of the upper part of the core is still valid. There is no evidence for periodic variations in the flux of meteorites in the centimeter to meter range or for the presence in the core of unusually low track density coarse fragments which may have been associated with a Tycho origin.|

C.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1185|Modal data support a five-unit stratigraphy for the Apollo 17 drill core. The upper unit E (0-22 cm depth) is marked by high content of fused soil, brown glass, and mare basalt fragments. This unit corresponds with a portion of the core excavated and refilled within the last 2 m.y. The underlying unit D (22071 cm depth) has a low abundance of fused soil (i.e., low maturity) and is rich in coarse (less than 200 microns) mare fragments. A large section of the core, unit C (71-224 cm depth), is finer-grained, more mature (richer in agglutinates), more feldspathic and has more highland lithic, mineral and glass fragments than unit D. The next underlying unit, B (224-256 cm depth), has yellow/colorless KREEP glasses with a high Si, low-alkali composition unlike the common Apollo 15 or Apollo 17 KREEP series. The petrologic (fused soil) and Is/FeO maturity of this layer is also lower than the units above and below. The deepest unit, A (256-284 cm depth), is marked by its relatively higher maturity and lower yellow/colorless KREEP glass content. The most prominent petrographic/stratigraphic indicators are the pyroxene-rich immature mare unit D and the abundance of KREEP glass in unit B. This KREEP glass is distinctive petrographically and compositionally, and is probably exotic to the Apollo 17 site. It is suggested here that the KREEP glass in unit B is derived from Tycho, which implies widespread distribution of KREEP on the lunar nearside.|

The core is heterogeneous with depth. Moreover, the 1000 to 90 micron coarse fractions are nearly identical but quite different from the less than 20 micron fine fraction. The bulk soil chemistry is governed by the coarse fractions, because of their greater weight proportion in the sample. The 1000-90 micron fraction contains more ilmenite basalt and less orange glass components than the 90-20 micron fraction. The less than 20 micron fraction is consistently enriched in highland material at all depths in the drill core.|

V.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1801|The in situ reworking (gardening) of the lunar surface by impacting projectiles creates an in situ reworking zone extending horizontally over the entire regolith surface and extending vertically from the surface to a depth which varies from place-to-place on the moon. On the basis of available evidence, the 'high-maturity' zones observed at the top of the lunar cores have resulted from the in situ reworking of the present-day lunar surface. The temporal variation of the in situ reworking depth was investigated using depths inferred from maturity I<SUB>s/FeO</SUB> and Al-26 profiles of Apollo cores. The observed temporal variation of the in situ reworking depth in units of centimeters is equal to 2.2 times the time (in units of million years) to the 0.45th power.|

W., Jr.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||59|A number of trace element interrelationships support the concept of a laterally inhomogeneous moon based originally on Clr/P2O5 ratios. The correspondence between Clr/P2O3 and Rb/Sr ratios in basalts are of special interest since the isotropic evolution of the latter pair of elements relates to the earliest history of the moon. This implies the times when the Clr/P2O5 relationships were established. The early magma ocean is conjectured to have been made up of non-intermixing seas resulting either from large convection cells or large body accretion. These mutually exclusive regions could be lunar geological provinces. It is proposed that the diversity of basalts from the Apollo 17 site is related to the lateral inhomogeneity of the moon. Ca/Na ratios in basalts show a trend which parallels that of Ru/Os and in a corresponding fashion may serve as a depth indicator.|
