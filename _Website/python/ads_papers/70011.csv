2016GeCoA.172..357E|2016|The origin of amino acids in lunar regolith samples|Elsila, Jamie E., Callahan, Michael P., Dworkin, Jason P., Glavin, Daniel P., McLain, Hannah L., Noble, Sarah K., Gibson, Everett K.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|172||357|We analyzed the amino acid content of seven lunar regolith samples returned by the Apollo 16 and Apollo 17 missions and stored under NASA curation since collection using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection and time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Consistent with results from initial analyses shortly after collection in the 1970s, we observed amino acids at low concentrations in all of the curated samples, ranging from 0.2 parts-per-billion (ppb) to 42.7 ppb in hot-water extracts and 14.5-651.1 ppb in 6 M HCl acid-vapor-hydrolyzed, hot-water extracts. Amino acids identified in the Apollo soil extracts include glycine, D- and L-alanine, D- and L-aspartic acid, D- and L-glutamic acid, D- and L-serine, L-threonine, and L-valine, all of which had previously been detected in lunar samples, as well as several compounds not previously identified in lunar regoliths: α-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB), D- and L-β-amino-n-butyric acid (β-ABA), DL-α-amino-n-butyric acid, γ-amino-n-butyric acid, β-alanine, and ε-amino-n-caproic acid. We observed an excess of the L enantiomer in most of the detected proteinogenic amino acids, but racemic alanine and racemic β-ABA were present in some samples. <P />We also examined seven samples from Apollo 15, 16, and 17 that had been previously allocated to a non-curation laboratory, as well as two samples of terrestrial dunite from studies of lunar module engine exhaust that had been stored in the same laboratory. The amino acid content of these samples suggested that contamination had occurred during non-curatorial storage. <P />We measured the compound-specific carbon isotopic ratios of glycine, β-alanine, and L-alanine in Apollo regolith sample 70011 and found values of -21‰ to -33‰. These values are consistent with those seen in terrestrial biology and, together with the enantiomeric compositions of the proteinogenic amino acids, suggest that terrestrial biological contamination is a primary source of the amino acids in these samples. However, the presence of the non-proteinogenic amino acids such as AIB and β-ABA suggests the possibility of some contribution from exogenous sources. <P />We did not observe a correlation of amino acid content with proximity to the Apollo 17 lunar module, implying that lunar module exhaust was not a primary source of amino acid precursors. Solar-wind-implanted precursors such as HCN also appear to be at most a minor contributor, given a lack of correlation between amino acid content and soil maturity (as measured by I<SUB>s</SUB>/FeO ratio) and the differences between the δ<SUP>13</SUP>C values of the amino acids and the solar wind.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2015.10.008

M., Pillinger, C. T.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|88||B200|Using stepped heating extraction techniques, determinations of carbon and nitrogen content and delta C-13 and delta N-15 values have been obtained for selected lunar soils and breccias. Only nitrogen data have been gathered for representative splits separated by size, density and magnetic properties from 12023. A plot of the total delta C-13 (after terrestrial contamination is removed) versus delta N-15 values for bulk samples reveals little evidence for a correlation between isotopically light carbon and isotopically light nitrogen of putative ancient solar wind origin. Soil 12023 is used to examine the current interpretation for the stepped release profile of nitrogen from bulk lunar samples. Mature agglutinates, postulated by previous workers to be the host of the light nitrogen, are shown to have a very constant delta N-15 value which is heavy rather than light. The actual host of the light nitrogen in 12023 has not been identified. The lowest values encountered during the study were found associated with the finest soil, but none of these was as low as for some temperature steps of the bulk soil. Interpretations regarding the origin of light nitrogen, if it is not present in agglutinates, await the results of more definitive efforts to identify the host phase.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB088iS01p0B200

N.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1435|It is established that the greatest distinction in origin of the soils in the Apollo 17 drill core is between the surface layer, down to 25 cm, and the remainder. The surface layer was not derived by the reworking of underlying material, but was deposited from elsewhere. The soils in the core below 25 cm have had similar surface histories, with first exposure to the solar wind 1.0-1.5 million years ago and accumulation of solar wind continuously over hundreds of millions of years thereafter. The soil with the least, and most ancient, surface exposure is 25-60 cm deep, while that with the greatest and most recent exposure, other than the present surface layer, lies at a depth of 110-170 cm. A major stratigraphic sequence disturbance has therefore deposited the soils in their present positions.|
