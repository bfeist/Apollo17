A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2251|Eighteen sections representing five matrix samples - 76015, 76215, 76275, 76295, and 76315 - from the Station 6 boulder were examined with emphasis on the textures and compositions of their native FeNi metal particles. It is found that many of the complex multiphase structures of the metal particles observed in the study cannot be explained by a continuous two-stage cooling of the impact-melt sheet. It is suggested that at least locally the boulder samples must have experienced multistage cooling and heating.|
