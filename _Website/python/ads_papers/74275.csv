Valences of Ti in pyroxene of both suites range from 3.6 to 4, or from 40% to 0% Ti<SUP>3+</SUP>, averaging 15-20% Ti<SUP>3+</SUP>. Assuming Ti<SUP>3+</SUP> is more compatible in pyroxene than Ti<SUP>4+</SUP>, then even lower Ti<SUP>3+</SUP> proportions are indicated for the parental melts. The VLT pyroxene exhibits a slightly wider range of V valences (2.57-2.96) than the high-Ti pyroxene (2.65-2.86) and a much wider range of Cr valences (2.32-2.80 versus 2.68-2.86); Cr is generally reduced in VLT pyroxene compared to high-Ti pyroxene. Valences of Ti and Cr in VLT pyroxene become less reduced with increasing FeO contents, possibly indicating change in oxygen fugacity during crystallization. Olivine in all samples has very low (&lt;20%) proportions of Ti<SUP>3+</SUP>, with no Ti<SUP>3+</SUP> and higher proportions of Ti in tetrahedral coordination in the VLTs than in the high-Ti basalts. Olivine in 74275, including that in a dunite clast, has much higher proportions of Cr<SUP>2+</SUP> than the pyroxene in that sample, consistent with previous studies indicating that the olivine grains in this sample are xenocrysts and possibly indicating oxidation just prior to pyroxene crystallization. Results for this sample, the VLTs, and previously studied Apollo 14 and 15 basalts all indicate that mare magmas were in reducing environments at depth, as recorded in early crystallization products, and that later, presumably shallower environments, were relatively oxidizing; single, characteristic fO<SUB>2</SUB>s of formation cannot be assigned to these samples. A process likely to account for this feature seen in multiple samples is loss by degassing of a reducing, H-rich vapor (probably H<SUB>2</SUB>) during ascent and/or eruption, causing oxidation of the residual melt, recorded in relatively late-crystallized pyroxene.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maps.13123
2015M&PS...50.1449S|2015|Exploring the Moon's surface for remnants of the lunar mantle 1. Dunite xenoliths in mare basalts. A crustal or mantle origin?|Shearer, Charles K., Burger, Paul V., Bell, Aaron S., Guan, Yunbin, Neal, Clive R.|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|50|8|1449|Remotely sensed observations from recent missions (e.g., GRAIL, Kaguya, Chandrayaan-1) have been interpreted as indicating that the deep crust and upper mantle are close to or at the lunar surface in many large impact basins (e.g., Crisium, Apollo, Moscoviense). If this is correct, the capability of either impact or volcanic processes to transport mantle lithologies to the lunar surface should be enhanced in these regions. Somewhat problematic to these observations and interpretations is that examples of mantle lithologies in the lunar sample collection (Apollo Program, Luna Program, lunar meteorites) are at best ambiguous. Dunite xenoliths in high-Ti mare basalt 74275 are one of these ambiguous examples. In this high-Ti mare basalt, olivine occurs in three generations: olivine associated with dunite xenoliths, olivine megacrysts, and olivine microphenocrysts. The dunite xenoliths are anhedral in shape and are generally greater than 800 μm in diameter. The interior of the xenoliths are fairly homogeneous with regard to many divalent cations. For example, the Mg# (Mg/Mg + Fe × 100) ranges from 82 to 83 in their interiors and decreases from 82 to 68 over the 10-30 μm wide outer rim. Titanium and phosphorus X-ray maps of the xenolith illustrate that these slow diffusing elements preserve primary cumulate zoning textures. These textures indicate that the xenoliths consist of many individual olivine grains approximately 150-200 μm in diameter with low Ti, Al, and P cores. These highly incompatible elements are enriched in the outer Fe-rich rims of the xenoliths and slightly enriched in the rims of the individual olivine grains. Highly compatible elements in olivine such as Ni exhibit a decrease in the rim surrounding the xenolith, an increase in the incompatible element depleted cores of the individual olivine grains, and a slight decrease in the "interior rims" of the individual olivine grains. Inferred melt composition, liquid lines of descent, and zoning profiles enable the reconstruction of the petrogenesis of the dunite xenoliths. Preservation of primary magmatic zoning (Ti, P, Al) and lack of textures similar to high-pressure mineral assemblages exhibited by the Mg-suite (Shearer et al. 2015) indicate that these xenoliths do not represent deep crustal or shallow mantle lithologies. Further, they are chemically and mineralogically distinct from Mg-suite dunites identified from the Apollo 17 site. More likely, they represent olivine cumulates that crystallized from a low-Ti mare basalt at intermediate to shallow crustal levels. The parent basalt to the dunite xenolith lithology was more primitive than low-Ti basalts thus far returned from the Moon. Furthermore, this parental magma and its more evolved daughter magmas are not represented in the basalt sample suite returned from the Taurus-Littrow Valley by the Apollo 17 mission. The dunite xenolith records several episodes of crystallization and re-equilibration. During the last episode of re-equilibration, the dunite cumulate was sampled by the 74275 high-Ti basalt and transported over a period of 30-70 days to the lunar surface.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maps.12480
2013GeCoA.106..429F|2013|Distinguishing between Apollo 14 impact melt and pristine mare basalt samples by geochemical and textural analyses of olivine|Fagan, A. L., Neal, C. R., Simonetti, A., Donohue, P. H., O'Sullivan, K. M.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|106||429|Apollo 14 (A-14) impact melt olivine vitrophyres (OVs), composed of olivine phenocrysts in an opaque glass matrix with minor amounts of pyroxene and plagioclase, are petrographically similar to pristine quenched A-14 high-alumina (high-Al) and Apollo 12 (A-12) basalts. Textural and chemical analyses have been conducted on olivines within impact melt and pristine mare basalt clasts from A-14 breccia 14321 as well as various olivine-phyric Apollo 12 and 17 basalts to be able to distinguish between the petrographically similar samples. The A-14 high-Al basalts examined here represent samples from each of the three chemical groups (A, B, C). Examples from the three A-12 basalt suites (Ilmenite, Olivine, Pigeonite) and olivine-rich Apollo 17 (A-17) Type C basalt, 74275, have also been analyzed. As a complement to the chemical analyses, crystal size distributions (CSDs) were determined for approximately half of the samples investigated here (due to a small number of olivine crystals that did not produce statistically meaningful CSDs on half of the samples), and confirm that although similar, the basalts and impact melts are texturally distinct. Olivines from A-14 impact melts have the highest average forsterite contents (average Fo ∼0.82) and generally the lowest average Co (37 ppm) and Mn (1544 ppm) abundances, thus chemically distinguishing them from the pristine basalts. In addition, chemical compositions obtained for olivine from 14321,1486 are most likely representative of an impact melt and thus contradict its previous classification as a high-Al basalt (Neal et al., 1988); olivine from, 1486 have similar average forsterite (average Fo ∼0.82) and Ti/V-ratio to the OVs. Furthermore, on the basis of their chemical compositions, olivines have been identified within the impact melts that are likely inherited from basalts; these olivines are chemically distinct from the rest of the impact melt olivine population with lower forsterite (0.67-0.80) and low Ti/V (∼10), which are similar to olivine compositions from the A-14 high-Al basalts. In addition to distinguishing between sample types from A-14, olivine compositions can also be used to distinguish between pristine mare basalts from various missions. Olivine within the selected samples from the individual A-12 basalt suites can also be distinguished chemically from one another using the Ti/V ratio, where Olivine suite basalts have Ti/V &lt;3 and Ilmenite suite basalts have Ti/V &gt;3.5. The results indicate that combined use of CSDs and chemical analyses of olivine can be used to reliably distinguish between (1) impact melts and pristine Apollo 14 basalts, (2) basalts from different landing sites, and (3) individual basalt suites from a single site.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2012.12.032

J.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference|27||1249|Analysis of oxygen on the electron microprobe has been seldom done in the past. The measurement of oxygen (and other light elements) has its share of unique problems, such as weak signal due to the low fluorescence yield of low atomic numbers and the high absorption of their X-rays, along with other problems that have lead to the usual condition in mineral analysis of calculating oxygen from the stoichiometry of the mineral analyzed. However, with the advent of synthetic multi-layer analyzing crystals with large d-spacing and improved matrix correction methods, the direct measurement of oxygen can yield additional information. For example, by measuring O on hydrous minerals and glasses, close estimates of H2O can reached. In anhydrous minerals, in which one or more constituents have variable oxidation states, the valance states may be determined by calculation from the oxygen analysis. Here we attempt to measure oxygen in pyroxene from Apollo 17 high-Ti mare basalt 74275. This a quickly-cooled basalt with TiO2 ~ 13 wt% and TiO2 in pyroxene &gt;6.0 wt%. Our goal in this study is to estimate Ti3+/Ti4+.|

W.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||251|Electron microprobe analyses indicate that the Apollo 15 red glasses with 13.8 wt.% TiO2 were produced in a volcanic fire-fountain. They are composed of three chemical groups connected by a pronounced trend. The liquidus phase relations are compatible with the view that the most Mg-rich group (A) was produced by partial melting of Ti-rich cumulates at a depth of about 480 km. The other red glasses (B and C) may have been derived from the group A magma by fractional crystallization at pressures less than 5 kbar. The fact that high-Ti mare liquids were produced at depths greatly in excess of 100 km requires an important revision of cumulate-remelting models. It is suggested that 4.4-AE cumulate rockbergs sank into the deep lunar interior soon after the global differentiation event. These blocks have a wide range of compositions and underwent partial melting at depths of 400 to 500 km to produce low- and high-Ti magmas.|

The analyzed samples of 74275 show sulfur contents of 1650 ppm S, which indicates that 74275 was 50% undersaturated at the time of eruption.|

Results show that armalcolite and ilmenite compositions are dependent upon the liquid composition and temperature at the time of crystallization. Furthermore, the different armalcolite/ilmenite textures rely to a greater extent on f<SUB>O2</SUB> than on cooling rate or bulk rock composition, and the Ti(3+) content of armalcolite can be used as an indicator of the approximate f<SUB>O2</SUB> prevailing at the time of crystallization.|

Significant reworking of the soil only occurred down to a few cm from the lunar surface since this event. Complementary investigations in this core by other groups are discussed. Most of the evidence available leads to a two stage model in which the orange and black soils collected at Shorty Crater were first irradiated for approximately 25 m.y. at some depth and then were deposited only a few m.y. ago as an overturned ejecta blanket.|

The orange-black droplets in this section were probably formed from pyroclastic eruptions about 3.6 billion years ago; they give little indication of surface exposure. The isotopic concentrations suggest that cosmic ray irradiation of the core occurred in two stages and that the core stratigraphy was inverted between stages. The first irradiation stage may have taken place immediately after pyroclastic deposition of the droplets and could have lasted about 20 million years.|

W., Jr.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||59|A number of trace element interrelationships support the concept of a laterally inhomogeneous moon based originally on Clr/P2O5 ratios. The correspondence between Clr/P2O3 and Rb/Sr ratios in basalts are of special interest since the isotropic evolution of the latter pair of elements relates to the earliest history of the moon. This implies the times when the Clr/P2O5 relationships were established. The early magma ocean is conjectured to have been made up of non-intermixing seas resulting either from large convection cells or large body accretion. These mutually exclusive regions could be lunar geological provinces. It is proposed that the diversity of basalts from the Apollo 17 site is related to the lateral inhomogeneity of the moon. Ca/Na ratios in basalts show a trend which parallels that of Ru/Os and in a corresponding fashion may serve as a depth indicator.|

The crater populations observed have identical characteristics to those obtained from previous missions. Special emphasis was placed on assessing the influence of target properties on the observable crater populations. Although these properties cannot be quantitatively evaluated at present, the empirical results indicate that crater populations on glass, breccia, and crystalline rock surfaces may differ fundamentally. As a consequence, lunar surface exposure ages of individual rocks based on micrometeoroid craters may be subject to criticism.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0019-1035(74)90079-7
