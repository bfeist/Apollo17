Intimate and linear mixing modeling of these spectra coupled with visible spectra [1] show SO<SUB>2</SUB> is more abundant on the leading side, commensurate with earlier findings [2,3]. Three component modeling was performed on these combined spectra using seven candidate end-members: fine- and medium-grained SO<SUB>2</SUB> frost [4], sulfur, forsterite, fayalite, Allende meteorite, and Apollo lunar soil #70017 [5]. SO<SUB>2</SUB> was present in all viable results. The second most abundant component was alternatively sulfur or fayalite. The third component was present at 0%--20% levels with the most common being fayalite, forsterite, and the Apollo sample. Quantitative estimates of SO<SUB>2</SUB> abundance have varied by 30%--60% depending on whether the estimates were made from UV or IR observations. UV observations have estimated 20% global coverage [4] while IR based estimates range from 85% on the leading and 50% on the trailing side [3]. McEwen et al. (1988) calculated disk-integrated SO<SUB>2</SUB> abundance on Io using both intimate and linear mixing models. The components they chose were SO<SUB>2</SUB> frost and hypothetical constituents based on component analysis of the Voyager color data set. Both our intimate and linear mixing model results estimate 25% +/- 8% SO<SUB>2</SUB> on the trailing side, on the low end of the range estimated from the Voyager data analysis [6]. While the SO<SUB>2</SUB> abundance on the leading side varies more with longitude, ranging from 37% +/- 16% at 15(deg) --45(deg) longitude and 60% +/- 16% at 135(deg) --165(deg) longitude, well above previous mixing model estimates based on IUE, 4.08-mm, and Voyager data sets [6].

The samples were irradiated in the thermal column of a heavy water reactor; after irradiation, the muscovite sheets and polycarbonate foils were removed and etched in 40 percent HF at 25 C for 20 min and in 6 N NaOH at 70 C for 10 min. The U-concentration in basaltic fragments range from 3.0 ppb to 43.4 ppb, and in pyroxene from 0.95 ppb to 15 ppb. The pyroxene data show a tendency to decreasing U-concentration with increasing crystal size. The U-microdistribution pattern of rock fragments shows that U is mainly concentrated in intergranular material. The higher the silicon content, the higher the U-content. This is due to the residual liquid being preferentially isolated in the final stage of crystallization, and being highly enriched in U.|
1981Geoch...4..365W|1981|A preliminary study on chemical composition and genesis of Apollo 17 high-Ti mare basalt|Wang, D., Ouyang, Z.|Geochemistry|4||365|The results of chemical, petrological, and mineralogical examinations of the lunar mare basalt sample 70017-291 are presented. The sample was identified as a Type B of A-17 basalts with a texture of plagioclase-poikilitic ilmenite basalt. The mean chemical composition was SiO2 39.01, TiO2 11.32, Al2O3 9.24, FeO 18.52, MgO 8.61, and CaO 10.86. Additional microprobe measurements of seven Apollo 17 pyroxene grains revealed the presence of pigeonite and augite-subcalicaugite. The plagioclase grains contained detectable Fe, K, and Ti, while the ilmenite composition was analyzed as TiO2 53.98, FeO 41.02, AlO3 0.21, MgO 2.41, and Cr2O3 0.74. The high Ti-content basalts were concluded to have formed by partial melting of early cumulates through assimilation and migmatization, basically multigenetic processes.|

About 5 mg of lunar rock sample powder, without any conductive material mixed in it, was pressed on the surface of a T-type electrode. A single exposure was made under the optimum conditions. After development, the relative sensitivity coefficients are calculated on the basis of the single exposure by U.S. Geological Survey Standard Rock AGV-1. More than 20 elements can be determined by this technique, with a typical precision of + or - 20%.|

A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||117|Lunar armaloclites, (Fe, Mg)Ti2O5, contain appreciable amounts of Ti(3+) (less than 1 to 17% of Ti mole fraction). This is a function of the oxygen fugacity occurring at the time of its formation, with lower fugacities being reflected in higher Ti(3+) contents. Controlled cooling-rate and isothermal experimentation on synthetic analog and natural specimens of 70017 and 74275 have been used to calibrate an oxygen geobarometer. Most lunar rocks have followed crystallization paths in oxygen fugacity/T space such that the prevailing oxygen fugacity can be represented by a curve near parallel to the I/W buffer curve. The oxygen fugacity estimates derived from Ti(3+) considerations of armalcolites range from the iron/wustite curve to about 1.5 log units below.|
1980Geoch......230L|1980|Petrographic and mineralogical studies on Apollo-17 mare basalt|Li, W., Yang, S., Xu, Y., Wang, D., Cao, J., Hou, W.|Geochemistry|||230|Petrographic and mineralogical studies on 70017-291 mare basalt indicate that the mare basalt consists principally of augite, pigeonite, plagioclase and ilmenite with minor olivine, cristobalite, metallic iron, troilite, rutile, Cr-Al-Mg ulvospinel and residual glass. X-ray microprobe analyses of whole rock and major minerals confirm that the 70017-291 sample is a medium-grained, high-Ti mare basalt, similar to those collected by the Apollo-11 mission. Chemically, this mare basalt is characterized by its higher contents of TiO2 and FeO. Electronprobe analysis gives (weight percent) pyroxene, 51.64; plagioclase, 25.69; ilmenite 21.43; olivine less than 1 and mesostasis. The sample exhibits a texture of plagioclase-ilmenite poikilitic basalt. According to Sm content, 70017-291 belongs to Type B of A-17 basalt.|

For most of the elements, the analytical error is confined to + or - 10%. A comparison was made between the analytical results and those obtained from Apollo-11 and Apollo-12 mare basalt samples.|
1980Geoch......243L|1980|Surface morphological and textural studies of Apollo-17 mare basalt by scanning electron microscope|Li, W., Yang, S., Xu, Y., Wang, D., Cao, J.|Geochemistry|||243|Scanning electron microscopic observation of rock fragments, minerals and glass from the 70017-291 mare basalt indicates the presence of glassy spheres of silicate caused by impact melting. Silicate glass fragments were noticed as impact ejecta adhering to the surface of glassy sphere. Metallic grains are enclosed by silicate glassy materials and exhibit fluidal structure. This indicates that mare basalts were subjected to repeated meteoritic impact. It is suggested that the lunar crystalline rock sample that was investigated was probably collected from the soil near the landing site of Apollo-17. Some microfractures and undulatory extinction have been observed within pyroxene grains under microscope and plastic deformation noticed in plagioclase. So, there are some signs of impact metamorphism in the mare basalt.|

L.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1489|Three Apollo 17 basalts were studied by the laser Ar-39-Ar-40 method. The 70215 basalt has a normal well-behaved Ar-39-Ar-40 release pattern; the 70017 basalt has a disturbed release pattern which indicates a limited intermediate maximum age followed by a broad low-age region; and the 75035 basalt has a pattern initially similar to 70017 that is followed by a high-temperature maximum age. The laser study shows that all mineral systems in 70215 have small and uniform temperature losses, while the laser-determined ages for 70017 and 75035 are, apparently, primarily controlled by the minerals containing mesostasis inclusions. It is possible that the drop in ages observed by the conventional Ar-39-Ar-40 method was due not only to recoil of Ar-39 during neutron irradiation but also to gas loss from some minerals. It is suggested that the plagioclases are the best minerals to use for a reliable age.|
1977LPSC....8.1473M|1977|Lead isotope studies of mare basalt 70017.|Mattinson, J. M., Tilton, G. R., Todt, W., Chen, J. H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1473|Uranium, thorium, and isotopic lead data for components of basalt 70017 are reported, and it is found that the whole rock, pyroxene, and ilmenite points in a concordia diagram plot along a chord intersecting the curve at 3.7 and 4.33 eons. The plagioclase data do not seem to lie on this line. The data for 70017 appear to plot along a distinctly different chord in a concordia diagram than do the data for 75055 and 75035, two other Apollo 17 mare basalts. The lead data are in accord with Sm-Nd results. A 3.7 eon crystallization age for 70017 would be consistent with the same kind of parentless lead that is indicated by previous studies of soils and soil breccias from stations at Taurus-Littrow. The Th/U ratio in ilmenite is 2.2, and the concentrations of these two elements are approximately twice those in pyroxene.|

H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||569|The paper describes one possible liquid line of descent produced for a high-titanium mare basalt composition through an arbitrarily chosen series of partial equilibrium and fractional crystallization experiments on basalt 70017. The liquid line of descent leading to immiscibility at 994 C is characterized by enrichment of FeO, K2O, SiO2, and MnO and depletion of MgO and TiO2 in the residual liquids. The composition of the residual liquid at the onset of immiscibility is ferrobasaltic, and the initial appearance of immiscible liquids in the form of silica-rich spherules is in the vicinity of plagioclase-liquid contacts. The integrated bulk composition of the areas of finely exsolved liquids indicates that the trend of the liquid line of descent is at a small angle to the tie lines joining the two liquids.|

Low-pressure melting experiments show that compositional variations within the Apollo 17 and Apollo 11 ophitic basalt suites may be generated by near-surface fractional crystallization of liquids with compositions similar to 70215 and 70017. High-pressure melting experiments show that liquids similar in composition to 70017 and 70215 can be generated by partial melting of an olivine+clinopyroxene+Fe-Ti-oxide source at depths of 100-150 km within the moon.|
