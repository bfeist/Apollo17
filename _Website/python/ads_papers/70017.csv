Recently, the chlorine isotope signatures of lunar rocks have been attributed to large-scale degassing processes that occurred during the existence of a magma ocean. In this study we investigated how well a suite of lunar basalts, most of which have not previously been analyzed, conform to previous models. The Cl isotope compositions (δ<SUP>37</SUP>Cl (‰) = [(<SUP>37</SUP>Cl/<SUP>35</SUP>Cl<SUB>sample</SUB>/<SUP>37</SUP>Cl/<SUP>35</SUP>Cl<SUB>SMOC</SUB>) - 1] × 1000, where SMOC refers to standard mean ocean chloride) recorded range from ∼+7 to +14‰ (Apollo 15), +10 to +19‰ (Apollo 12), +9 to +15‰ (70017), +4 to +8‰ (MIL 05035), and +15 to +22‰ (Kalahari 009). The Cl isotopic data from the present study support the mixing trends previously reported by Boyce et al. (2015) and Barnes et al. (2016), as the Cl isotopic composition of apatites are positively correlated with bulk-rock incompatible trace element abundances in the low-Ti basalts, inclusive of low-Ti and KREEP basalts. This trend has been interpreted as evidence that incompatible trace elements, including Cl, were concentrated in the urKREEP residual liquid of the lunar magma ocean, rather than the mantle cumulates, and that urKREEP Cl had a highly fractionated isotopic composition. The source regions for the basalts were thus created by variable mixing between the mantle (Cl-poor and relatively unfractionated) and urKREEP. The high-Ti basalts show much more variability in measured Cl isotope ratios and scatter around the trend formed by the low-Ti basalts. Most of the data for lunar meteorites also fits the mixing of volatiles in their sources, but Kalahari 009, which is highly depleted in incompatible trace elements, contains apatites with heavily fractionated Cl isotopic compositions. Given that Kalahari 009 is one of the oldest lunar basalts and ought to have been derived from very early-formed mantle cumulates, a heavy Cl isotopic signature is likely not related to its mantle source, but more likely to magmatic or secondary alteration processes, perhaps via impact-driven vapor metasomatism of the lunar crust.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2018.12.032
2018M&PS...53.2138S|2018|Valences of Ti, Cr, and V in Apollo 17 high-Ti and very low-Ti basalts and implications for their formation|Simon, Steven B., Sutton, Stephen R.|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|53|10|2138|To assess the variability of redox states among mare basalt source regions, investigation of the valence of Ti, Cr, and V and the coordination environment of Ti in pyroxene and olivine in lunar rocks via XANES (X-ray absorption near-edge structure) spectroscopy has been extended to Apollo 17 basalts: two high-Ti (70017 and 74275) hand samples, and three very low-Ti (70006,371, 70007,289B, and 70007,296) basalt fragments from the Apollo 17 deep drill core. Valences of Ti in pyroxene of both suites range from 3.6 to 4, or from 40% to 0% Ti<SUP>3+</SUP>, averaging 15-20% Ti<SUP>3+</SUP>. Assuming Ti<SUP>3+</SUP> is more compatible in pyroxene than Ti<SUP>4+</SUP>, then even lower Ti<SUP>3+</SUP> proportions are indicated for the parental melts. The VLT pyroxene exhibits a slightly wider range of V valences (2.57-2.96) than the high-Ti pyroxene (2.65-2.86) and a much wider range of Cr valences (2.32-2.80 versus 2.68-2.86); Cr is generally reduced in VLT pyroxene compared to high-Ti pyroxene. Valences of Ti and Cr in VLT pyroxene become less reduced with increasing FeO contents, possibly indicating change in oxygen fugacity during crystallization. Olivine in all samples has very low (&lt;20%) proportions of Ti<SUP>3+</SUP>, with no Ti<SUP>3+</SUP> and higher proportions of Ti in tetrahedral coordination in the VLTs than in the high-Ti basalts. Olivine in 74275, including that in a dunite clast, has much higher proportions of Cr<SUP>2+</SUP> than the pyroxene in that sample, consistent with previous studies indicating that the olivine grains in this sample are xenocrysts and possibly indicating oxidation just prior to pyroxene crystallization. Results for this sample, the VLTs, and previously studied Apollo 14 and 15 basalts all indicate that mare magmas were in reducing environments at depth, as recorded in early crystallization products, and that later, presumably shallower environments, were relatively oxidizing; single, characteristic fO<SUB>2</SUB>s of formation cannot be assigned to these samples. A process likely to account for this feature seen in multiple samples is loss by degassing of a reducing, H-rich vapor (probably H<SUB>2</SUB>) during ascent and/or eruption, causing oxidation of the residual melt, recorded in relatively late-crystallized pyroxene.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maps.13123

Intimate and linear mixing modeling of these spectra coupled with visible spectra [1] show SO<SUB>2</SUB> is more abundant on the leading side, commensurate with earlier findings [2,3]. Three component modeling was performed on these combined spectra using seven candidate end-members: fine- and medium-grained SO<SUB>2</SUB> frost [4], sulfur, forsterite, fayalite, Allende meteorite, and Apollo lunar soil #70017 [5]. SO<SUB>2</SUB> was present in all viable results. The second most abundant component was alternatively sulfur or fayalite. The third component was present at 0%--20% levels with the most common being fayalite, forsterite, and the Apollo sample. Quantitative estimates of SO<SUB>2</SUB> abundance have varied by 30%--60% depending on whether the estimates were made from UV or IR observations. UV observations have estimated 20% global coverage [4] while IR based estimates range from 85% on the leading and 50% on the trailing side [3]. McEwen et al. (1988) calculated disk-integrated SO<SUB>2</SUB> abundance on Io using both intimate and linear mixing models. The components they chose were SO<SUB>2</SUB> frost and hypothetical constituents based on component analysis of the Voyager color data set. Both our intimate and linear mixing model results estimate 25% +/- 8% SO<SUB>2</SUB> on the trailing side, on the low end of the range estimated from the Voyager data analysis [6]. While the SO<SUB>2</SUB> abundance on the leading side varies more with longitude, ranging from 37% +/- 16% at 15(deg) --45(deg) longitude and 60% +/- 16% at 135(deg) --165(deg) longitude, well above previous mixing model estimates based on IUE, 4.08-mm, and Voyager data sets [6].

The samples were irradiated in the thermal column of a heavy water reactor; after irradiation, the muscovite sheets and polycarbonate foils were removed and etched in 40 percent HF at 25 C for 20 min and in 6 N NaOH at 70 C for 10 min. The U-concentration in basaltic fragments range from 3.0 ppb to 43.4 ppb, and in pyroxene from 0.95 ppb to 15 ppb. The pyroxene data show a tendency to decreasing U-concentration with increasing crystal size. The U-microdistribution pattern of rock fragments shows that U is mainly concentrated in intergranular material. The higher the silicon content, the higher the U-content. This is due to the residual liquid being preferentially isolated in the final stage of crystallization, and being highly enriched in U.|

The sample was identified as a Type B of A-17 basalts with a texture of plagioclase-poikilitic ilmenite basalt. The mean chemical composition was SiO2 39.01, TiO2 11.32, Al2O3 9.24, FeO 18.52, MgO 8.61, and CaO 10.86. Additional microprobe measurements of seven Apollo 17 pyroxene grains revealed the presence of pigeonite and augite-subcalicaugite. The plagioclase grains contained detectable Fe, K, and Ti, while the ilmenite composition was analyzed as TiO2 53.98, FeO 41.02, AlO3 0.21, MgO 2.41, and Cr2O3 0.74. The high Ti-content basalts were concluded to have formed by partial melting of early cumulates through assimilation and migmatization, basically multigenetic processes.|

More than 20 elements can be determined by this technique, with a typical precision of + or - 20%.|

X-ray microprobe analyses of whole rock and major minerals confirm that the 70017-291 sample is a medium-grained, high-Ti mare basalt, similar to those collected by the Apollo-11 mission. Chemically, this mare basalt is characterized by its higher contents of TiO2 and FeO. Electronprobe analysis gives (weight percent) pyroxene, 51.64; plagioclase, 25.69; ilmenite 21.43; olivine less than 1 and mesostasis.

Silicate glass fragments were noticed as impact ejecta adhering to the surface of glassy sphere. Metallic grains are enclosed by silicate glassy materials and exhibit fluidal structure. This indicates that mare basalts were subjected to repeated meteoritic impact. It is suggested that the lunar crystalline rock sample that was investigated was probably collected from the soil near the landing site of Apollo-17. Some microfractures and undulatory extinction have been observed within pyroxene grains under microscope and plastic deformation noticed in plagioclase. So, there are some signs of impact metamorphism in the mare basalt.|

The core is heterogeneous with depth. Moreover, the 1000 to 90 micron coarse fractions are nearly identical but quite different from the less than 20 micron fine fraction. The bulk soil chemistry is governed by the coarse fractions, because of their greater weight proportion in the sample. The 1000-90 micron fraction contains more ilmenite basalt and less orange glass components than the 90-20 micron fraction. The less than 20 micron fraction is consistently enriched in highland material at all depths in the drill core.|

A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||465|The short-range unmixing model, which explains compositional variations produced during crystallization of a single undifferentiated basalt flow, has been applied to the variations found within each of the suites of mare basalts. Based on this modelling, the following suites of mare basalts could represent random samples from single, undifferentiated lava flows: Apollo 11 A (high K), Apollo 15 olivine, Apollo 17 A-U, Apollo 17 B, Apollo 17 C. The short range unmixing model fails to account for variations within the Apollo 12 olivine-pigeonite group and Apollo 12 ilmenite group, which are well explained by fractional crystallization. The fact that the compositional variations within a suite of samples of unknown affinity can be explained in terms of short-range unmixing of a single lava does not mean that they are necessarily related in that way. It does, however, mean that independent evidence (stratigraphic, petrographic, isotropic, or age) is required to support arguments for the variations being caused by fraction crystallization or different magma batches.|

The correspondence between Clr/P2O3 and Rb/Sr ratios in basalts are of special interest since the isotropic evolution of the latter pair of elements relates to the earliest history of the moon. This implies the times when the Clr/P2O5 relationships were established. The early magma ocean is conjectured to have been made up of non-intermixing seas resulting either from large convection cells or large body accretion. These mutually exclusive regions could be lunar geological provinces. It is proposed that the diversity of basalts from the Apollo 17 site is related to the lateral inhomogeneity of the moon. Ca/Na ratios in basalts show a trend which parallels that of Ru/Os and in a corresponding fashion may serve as a depth indicator.|

L.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1489|Three Apollo 17 basalts were studied by the laser Ar-39-Ar-40 method. The 70215 basalt has a normal well-behaved Ar-39-Ar-40 release pattern; the 70017 basalt has a disturbed release pattern which indicates a limited intermediate maximum age followed by a broad low-age region; and the 75035 basalt has a pattern initially similar to 70017 that is followed by a high-temperature maximum age. The laser study shows that all mineral systems in 70215 have small and uniform temperature losses, while the laser-determined ages for 70017 and 75035 are, apparently, primarily controlled by the minerals containing mesostasis inclusions. It is possible that the drop in ages observed by the conventional Ar-39-Ar-40 method was due not only to recoil of Ar-39 during neutron irradiation but also to gas loss from some minerals. It is suggested that the plagioclases are the best minerals to use for a reliable age.|
