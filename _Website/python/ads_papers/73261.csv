J.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|136|3|693|Experiments to determine if the presence could be confirmed of excess <SUP>14</SUP>C implantation in lunar soils and a rock surface sample were undertaken. Stepwise HF etchings of near-surface lunar soil 73221, collected from 0 to 0.5 cm depth and surface soil 10084, and a sample of surface scrapings from rock 68815 released appreciable amounts of <SUP>14</SUP>C. Considering the amount of material dissolved, we find that the amounts of <SUP>14</SUP>C released are significantly in excess of the amounts that would be necessary for both galactic and solar cosmic-ray-produced <SUP>14</SUP>C, even for the very surface. Further, there is an excess of <SUP>14</SUP>C released compared to deeper samples of rock and soil, based on our analyses of subsurface soils (73241 and 73261) from the same trench location of 73221, and earlier studies of <SUP>14</SUP>C in rock 68815[1]. Based on the observed release pattern of <SUP>14</SUP>C, we estimate that the excess <SUP>14</SUP>C in the lunar surficial samples may be released from depths of up to several microns. We conclude that this is an implanted solar component.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(95)00163-7
