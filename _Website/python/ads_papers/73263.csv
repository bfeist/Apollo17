T.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||319|Subsolidus thermodynamic calculations have been made to define the temperature and pressure conditions required to equilibrate lunar spinel cataclasites (olivine + high alumina orthopyroxene + pleonaste spinel + plagioclase + or - cordierite) that occur as clasts in 15445, 73263, and 72435. The results, which are subject to modification by improved thermodynamic data and experiment, indicate that those samples that are cordierite-free and of high Mg/(Mg + Fe) were derived from the lower crust and possibly from a high-velocity zone of the uppermost mantle. However, the cordierite-bearing type in 72435,8 /low Mg/(Mg + Fe)/ resided in the upper levels of the crust prior to excavation by impact. Consideration of the relevant supersolidus phase equilibria indicates that the whole-rock chemistry of all spinel cataclasites can only be explained by pleonaste spinel accumulation. These materials are interpreted to be primordial cumulate rocks formed during the differentiation of the lunar magma ocean.|

E.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2029|The petrographies and phase chemistries of five lunar crystalline anorthositic fragments with Ar-40/Ar-39 plateau 'ages' ranging from 4.1 to 4.3 AE are reported. An investigation is conducted to determine whether the individual fragments are monomict or polymict breccias. For polymict breccias it is attempted to establish whether clasts and matrix have equilibrated chemically. On the basis of the results of the investigation it is suggested that sample 73263,1,1 was a breccia (possibly a clast-laden melt) containing old clasts, incorporated in an ejecta blanket that was annealed at about 4.1 AE in a transient high-temperature event. The sample 73263,1,6 studied is an annealed anorthositic breccia containing approximately 20% clasts dominated by single-crystal plagioclase fragments. The obtained data are consistent with a two-component system containing old plagioclase clasts in a young (about 4.0 AE) annealed, matrix. The annealing event at approximately 4.0 AE was insufficient to equilibrate the argon. It is found that four of the breccias having ages of about 4.2 AE or more are polymict. The most striking feature of all of the samples studied is the presence of a significant amount of 4.2-4.3 AE argon.|
