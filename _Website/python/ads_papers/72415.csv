2018GeCoA.238..580P|2018|Experimentally determined effects of olivine crystallization and melt titanium content on iron isotopic fractionation in planetary basalts|Prissel, Kelsey B., Krawczynski, Michael J., Nie, Nicole X., Dauphas, Nicolas, Couvy, Hélène, Hu, Michael Y., Alp, E. Ercan, Roskosz, Mathieu|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|238||580|Olivine is the most abundant mantle mineral at depths relevant to oceanic crust production through melting. It is also a liquidus phase for a wide range of mafic and ultramafic magma compositions. We have experimentally investigated the effects of olivine crystallization and melt composition on the fractionation of Fe isotopes in igneous systems. To test whether there is a melt compositional control on Fe isotopic fractionation, we have conducted nuclear resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (NRIXS) measurements on a suite of synthetic glasses ranging from 0.4 to 16.3 wt.% TiO<SUB>2</SUB>. The resulting force constants are similar to those of the reduced (fO<SUB>2</SUB> = IW) terrestrial basalt, andesite, and dacite glasses reported by Dauphas et al. (2014), indicating that there is no measurable effect of titanium composition on Fe isotopic fractionation in the investigated compositional range. We have also conducted olivine crystallization experiments and analyzed the Fe isotopic composition of the experimental olivines and glasses using solution MC-ICPMS. Olivine and glass separates from a given experimental charge have the same iron isotopic composition within error. This result is robust in both the high-Ti glass (Apollo 14 black) and low-Ti glass (Apollo 14 VLT) compositions, and at the two oxygen fugacities investigated (IW-1, IW+2). Additionally, we have determined that Fe loss in reducing one-atmosphere gas-mixing experiments occurs not only as loss to the Re wire container, but also as evaporative loss, and each mechanism of experimental Fe loss has an associated Fe isotopic fractionation. <P />We apply our results to interpreting Fe isotopic variations in the lunar mare basalts and lunar dunite 72415-8. Our experimental results indicate that neither melt TiO<SUB>2</SUB> composition nor equilibrium olivine crystallization can explain the observed difference in the iron isotopic composition of the lunar mare basalts. Additionally, equilibrium iron isotopic fractionation between olivine and melt cannot account for the "light" iron isotopic composition of lunar dunite 72415-8, unless the melt from which it is crystallizing was already enriched in light iron isotopes. Our results support models of diffusive fractionation to explain the light iron isotopic compositions measured in olivine from a variety of rock types and reduced (fO<SUB>2</SUB> = IW-1 to IW+2) igneous environments (e.g., lunar dunite and basalts, terrestrial peridotites and basalts, martian shergottites).|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2018.07.028

Olivines from ferroan anorthosite 62237 and samples from the Stillwater intrusion were analyzed; literature data for other lunar and terrestrial plutonic samples were used for comparisons. The analyses show that the lunar dunite 72415 contains a range of olivine compositions, that the olivines are zoned, and that they have CaO abundances that are consistent with shallow hypabyssal rather than deep plutonic accumulation.|
1992ga17.conf...48R|1992|The Apollo 17 Samples: The Massifs and Landslide|Ryder, Graham|Geology of the Apollo 17 Landing Site|||48|More than 50 kg of rock and regolith samples, a little less than half the total Apollo 17 sample mass, was collected from the highland stations at Taurus-Littrow. Twice as much material was collected from the North Massif as from the South Massif and its landslide (the apparent disproportionate collecting at the mare sites is mainly a reflection of the large size of a few individual basalt samples). Descriptions of the collection, documentation, and nature of the samples are given. A comprehensive catalog is currently being produced. Many of the samples have been intensely studied over the last 20 years and some of the rocks have become very familiar and depicted in popular works, particularly the dunite clast (72415), the troctolite sample (76535), and the station 6 boulder samples. Most of the boulder samples have been studied in Consortium mode, and many of the rake samples have received a basic petrological/geochemical characterization.|

B.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||365|Data are summarized which suggest a model for the early evolution of the lunar crust. According to the model, during the final stages of accretion, the outer part of the moon melted to form a magma ocean approximately 300 km deep. This ocean fractionated to form mafic and ultramafic cumulates at depth and an overlying anorthositic crust made up of ferroan anorthosites. Subsequent partial melting in the primitive mantle underlying the crystallized magma ocean produced melts which segregated, moved upward, intruded the primordial crust, and crystallized to form layered plutons consisting of Mg-rich plutonic rocks. Intense impact bombardment at the lunar surface mixed and melted the rocks of the two suites to form a thick layer of granulated debris, granulitic breccias, and impact-melt rocks.|

D., Ryder, G.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||531|The petrology and geochemistry of pristine lunar highlands rock samples consisting of ferroan anorthosites, norites, troctolites, spinel troctolites/dunite/lherzolite, and KREEP, are described. In addition, petrographic and chemical evidence is presented which shows that low-siderophile rocks are the result of endogenous igneous activity and not impact melt differentiation. For example, these rocks contain Fe-metal as a late-crystallizing phase, and have W/La ratios higher than polymict breccias.|

Apart from being of interest in its own right, such a comparison provides a test of Delano and Ringwood's (1979) contention that 'abundances of Ge, Au, and other siderophile elements in pristine highland rocks are not consistent with magmatic differentiation'. The other topics reexamined in this paper are the correlation of siderophiles and volatiles in pristine rocks with Rb and Cs (likewise questioned by Delano and Ringwood), the relationship of 'non-mare' basalts (14053, 60639) to their mare counterparts, and the abundance of some incompatible elements in the lunar bulk.|

M.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||661|Petrographic, chemical and isotopic similarities between 14078 and other Apollo-14 KREEP basalts suggest that these samples were derived from the same parent liquid and possibly from the same cooling unit. The liquid was probably generated via meteorite impact. Subtle differences are noted in the shapes of REE patterns of KREEP-rich samples from different landing sites; the origin of these differences is not well understood. Calculated Ti/Sm values in liquids parental to primitive cumulate samples are similar to values proposed for the whole moon.|

W.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1823|Total sulfur abundances have been determined for 36 Apollo 17 soil, breccia and crystalline rock samples. Sulfur concentrations range from 550 to 1300 micrograms S/g for soil samples, with the orange soil containing the lowest amount of sulfur. Noritic breccias contain between 720 and 950 micrograms S/g, while the anorthositic rocks have sulfur contents of 270 and 368 micrograms S/g. The dunite 72415 contained the lowest sulfur content (44 micrograms S/g) of any Apollo 17 sample studied. Apollo 17 basalts have unusually high sulfur contents (1580-2770 micrograms S/g) as compared to Apollo 12 and 15 basalts and terrestrial basalts. Sulfur abundances for the Apollo 17 basalts are almost identical to those from Apollo 11 basalts. A negative correlation between percent metallic iron and total sulfur for the Apollo 17 and 15 basalts was found and suggests that a portion of the metallic iron in lunar basalts may result from desulfuration of the melt prior to crystallization from the lunar magma.|
