L., Wang, Alian|Icarus|226|1|891|Much work has been devoted to the correlation between the remotely sensed UV-VIS slope and the TiO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration of the lunar surface, and this correlation has been used to map the lunar surface TiO<SUB>2</SUB> distributions using data obtained from various missions. However, additional work is needed to fully evaluate the UV-VIS-TiO<SUB>2</SUB> correlation. Such work would help ongoing efforts to improve TiO<SUB>2</SUB> mapping (e.g., as currently underway with LROC Wide Angle Camera (WAC) data). To evaluate the UV-VIS-TiO<SUB>2</SUB> correlation, we are investigating soil petrographic factors (e.g., modal abundances of Ti bearing minerals, lithic, and glass hosts, ilmenite morphology, grain size, and maturity) that may influence the spectra. This “ground truth” approach will be useful in comparing between sample information and laboratory spectra to investigate the influence of petrographic factors on the spectra. In this work, we report the quantitative results of a systematic laboratory investigation of three size fractions (210-100 μm, 100-48 μm, 48-20 μm) of two high Ti lunar soils 10084 and 71501 using a combined digital imaging (backscattered electron image and X-ray maps) method. For each size fraction, the results include: (1) the modal abundances for single phase minerals and lithologic components; (2) the Ti distributions among Ti host components; and (3) the shape of ilmenite grains. We compile and compare the data together for the three size fractions of the two high Ti soils with different maturities as well as data from previous studies. Future work will include the investigation of finer size fractions (<20 μm) and more samples (Apollo 12, Apollo 15) covering a larger range of Ti concentration and maturity, and comparison with their spectra.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2013.07.007

C., Wang, Alian, Jolliff, Bradley L.|Icarus|211|1|101|Laser Raman spectroscopy is used to investigate four lunar soils, focusing on mineralogy of grains of <45 μm size. Apollo samples 14163, 15271, 67511, and 71501 were selected as endmembers to study, based on their soil chemistry, maturity, and sample locations. Typical Raman spectral features for major and minor lunar minerals are discussed on the basis of major vibrational modes. We used the Raman peak shift to calculate Mg/(Mg + Fe + Ca) and Ca/(Mg + Fe + Ca) for pyroxene and Mg/(Mg + Fe) for olivine, and thus obtained the compositional distributions of these two minerals in each of the four lunar soils. Classification of feldspar grains was made based on recognition of their Raman patterns. A Raman point-counting procedure was applied to derive mineral modes of the soils, and these are found to be consistent with published modal analysis of these soils. The compositional distributions of pyroxene and olivine grains in each soil sample, as well as the mineral modes, reflect characteristics of the main source materials for these soils. Raman patterns and peak positions also reflect shock effects on plagioclase and quartz, found in 14163.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2010.08.020

The δ <SUP>18</SUP>O range found for the <SUP>16</SUP>O-poor component may reflect various processes such as isotope exchange reaction during oxidation of metallic iron and/or isotope fractionation by evaporation/condensation at the surface of the Moon or during implantation at depth in the lunar metallic grains.

Samples and simulants of lunar soil must be established for these studies. We present here the bulk and mineral chemistries of unusual Apollo 17 sample 70051, the <45-μm fraction of 70051, and the bulk and mineral chemistries of lunar soil simulants MLS-1A, JSC-1A, and JSC-1Af. Comparison to lunar soils collected during the Apollo missions shows that 70051 has bulk chemistry similar to that of soils from the North Massif bounding the Valley of Taurus-Littrow. Particle-size distribution reveals 70051 to differ significantly from bona fide lunar soils. It is a coarse, immature sample with >80 % of particles >50 μm, and a constrained range of particle sizes (~50% of particles are 50-100 μm in size) when compared to typical Apollo 17 soils (e.g., 71501,1 has ~20% of particles in the 50-100 μm range). Plagioclase, present in rock fragments and as mineral fragments (up to sizes ~1 mm), is the main phase present (50.5 vol%). Simulant JSC-1A has a chemistry that is atypical for most of the Moon and contains 49.3 vol% glass. Simulant MLS-1A resembles the FeO, TiO<SUB>2</SUB> and Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB> contents of mare basalt soils. Both lunar soil simulants have specific properties for certain in situ resource utilization studies, however, neither fully matches both the physical and chemical characteristics of lunar soil. Sample 70051, as a 1.4-kg haphazard mixture of lunar soil particles, is probably the best of the Apollo ``soil'' samples to be allocated for various ISRU investigations, where the uniqueness of lunar soils is deemed a necessity for study.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2006JE002767

SW He and Ne composition has been analyzed in ilmenites of lunar soils (71501, 12001, 74241) and regolith breccias (79135, 79035, 14301) by closed system stepwise etching. The samples have SW antiquities ranging from ~0.1 to ~3.7 Gyr. The experiments have a very high depth resolution; thus, possible artifacts that may compromise the precise determination of the SW composition can be controlled. The nominal average (<SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He)<SUB>SW</SUB> ratios correlate with the SW antiquity, suggesting at first glance a (<SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He)<SUB>SW</SUB> increase of 6% per Gyr. In addition, also the (<SUP>20</SUP>Ne/<SUP>22</SUP>Ne)<SUB>SW</SUB> ratio seems to have increased with time by about 2% per Gyr. However, there are reasons indicating that the apparent temporal increase of (<SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He)<SUB>SW</SUB> is an artifact. First, there is no straightforward explanation for a concurrent temporal change of (<SUP>20</SUP>Ne/<SUP>22</SUP>Ne)<SUB>SW</SUB> to the extent observed. Second, the average nominal (<SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He)<SUB>SW</SUB> and (<SUP>20</SUP>Ne/<SUP>22</SUP>Ne)<SUB>SW</SUB> ratios correlate with each other, and this correlation parallels the one displayed by the single etch steps, indicating a progressive admixture of the deeper sited, isotopically heavier solar energetic particles with ongoing etching. We suggest that the nominal temporal variation of (<SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He)<SUB>SW</SUB> and (<SUP>20</SUP>Ne/<SUP>22</SUP>Ne)<SUB>SW</SUB> is the result of secondary processes that cause erosion of the outermost layers of the regolith grains and thus a partial removal of the very surface-sited SW. Correcting this partial grain surface loss, assuming a constant SW Ne isotopic composition throughout the Sun's lifetime, leads to constant (<SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He)<SUB>SW</SUB> at (4.47+/-0.13)×10<SUP>-4</SUP> within the last ~4 Gyr. The results suggest that the present-day (<SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He)<SUB>SW</SUB> can directly be used to deduce the protosolar (D+<SUP>3</SUP>He)/<SUP>4</SUP>He composition and that a possible mixing between radiative interior and convective zone must be restricted to a thin boundary layer.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/378402

Cosmogenic and trapped components were discriminated using stepwise heating with a power-controlled CO <SUB>2</SUB> laser. Cosmogenic <SUP>15</SUP>N and <SUP>38</SUP>Ar correlate among different ilmenite grains, yielding a mean <SUP>15</SUP>N <SUB>c</SUB>/ <SUP>38</SUP>Ar <SUB>c</SUB> production ratio of 14.4±1.0 atoms/atom. This yields a <SUP>15</SUP>N production rate in bulk lunar samples of 3.8-5.6 pg (g rock) <SUP>-1</SUP> Ma <SUP>-1</SUP>, which agrees well with previous estimates. The trapped δ <SUP>15</SUP>N values show large variations (up to 300‰) among different grains of a given soil, reflecting complex histories of mixing between different end-members. The <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>14</SUP>N ratio, which is expected to increase with increasing contribution of solar ions, varies from 0.007 to 0.44 times the solar abundance ratio. The trapped δ <SUP>15</SUP>N values correlate roughly with the <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>14</SUP>N ratios from a non-solar end-member characterized by a <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>14</SUP>N ratio close to 0 and variable but generally positive δ <SUP>15</SUP>N values, to lower δ <SUP>15</SUP>N values accompanied by increasing <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>14</SUP>N ratios, supporting the claim of Hashizume et al. (2000) that solar nitrogen is largely depleted in <SUP>15</SUP>N relative to meteoritic or terrestrial nitrogen. Nevertheless, the <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>14</SUP>N ratio of the <SUP>15</SUP>N-depleted (solar) end-member is lower than the solar abundance ratio by a factor of 2.5-5. We explain this by a reprocessing of implanted solar wind atoms, during which part of the chemically inert rare gases were lost. We estimate that the flux of non-solar N necessary to account for the observed δ <SUP>15</SUP>N values is comparable to the flux of micrometeorites and interplanetary dust particles estimated for the Earth. Hence we propose that the variations in δ <SUP>15</SUP>N values observed in lunar regolith can be simply explained by mixing between solar wind contributions and micrometeoritic ones infalling on the Moon. Temporal variations of δ <SUP>15</SUP>N values among samples of different antiquities could be due to changes in the micrometeoritic flux through time, in which case such flux has increased by up to an order of magnitude during the last 0.5 Ga.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0012-821X(02)00781-1

J.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|63|13|2145|We have applied a stepwise pyrolytic extraction technique to eleven individual lunar regolith grains to investigate the compositions of light noble gases embedded in grain surfaces by solar wind irradiation, with emphasis on the rather poorly known isotopic composition of solar-wind argon. Results are intriguing: average <SUP>20</SUP>Ne/ <SUP>22</SUP>Ne ratios observed in early pyrolytic releases from ilmenite grains separated from lunar soils 71501, 79035 and 10084 agree very well with both direct measures of the solar wind neon composition in the Apollo foils and with values obtained in first releases from acid-etched ilmenites by the Zürich laboratory, whereas these same pyrolytic and acid-etch fractions carry argon isotopic signatures that significantly disagree - average <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>38</SUP>Ar ratios near 5.8 for thermal extraction compared to 5.4-5.5 for chemical etching at Zürich. Consideration of the isotopic and elemental data from these grains in the context of first-order diffusive modeling calculations points to gas release at low temperatures, without significant isotopic or elemental fractionation, from isolated grain-surface reservoirs of solar wind composition. The physical nature of these reservoirs is presently unknown. In this interpretation the preferred solar wind <SUP>20</SUP>Ne/ <SUP>22</SUP>Ne and <SUP>21</SUP>Ne/ <SUP>22</SUP>Ne ratios deduced from this study are respectively 13.81 ± 0.08 and 0.0333 ± 0.0003, both within error of the Zürich acid-etch values, and <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>38</SUP>Ar = 5.77 ± 0.08. It may be possible to reconcile the discrepancy between the acid-etch and pyrolytic estimates for the solar wind <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>38</SUP>Ar ratio in the context of arguments originally advanced by Benkert et al. (1993) to account for their He and Ne isotopic compositions. At the other, high-temperature end of the release profile from one of these grains there are clear isotopic indications of the presence of a Ne constituent with <SUP>20</SUP>Ne/ <SUP>22</SUP>Ne close to the 11.2 ratio found at Zürich and attributed by these workers to a deeply-sited component implanted by solar energetic particles.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00002-2
1994Metic..29..724B|1994|Solar Wind Noble Gases and Nitrogen in Metal from Lunar Soil 68501|Becker, R. H., Pepin, R. O.|Meteoritics|29||724|Noble gases and N were analyzed in handpicked metal separates from lunar soil 68501 by a combination of step-wise combustions and pyrolyses. Helium and Ne were found to be unfractionated with respect to one another when normalized to solar abundances, for both the bulk sample and for all but the highest temperature steps. However, they are depleted relative to Ar, Kr and Xe by at least a factor of 5. The heavier gases exhibit mass-dependent fractionation relative to solar system abundance ratios but appear unfractionated, both in the bulk metal and in early temperature steps, when compared to relative abundances derived from lunar ilmenite 71501 by chemical etching, recently put forward as representing the abundance ratios in solar wind. Estimates of the contribution of solar energetic particles (SEP) to the originally implanted solar gases, derived from a basic interpretation of He and Ne isotopes, yield values of about 10%. Analysis of the Ar isotopes requires a minimum of 20% SEP, and Kr isotopes, using our preferred composition for solar wind Kr, yield a result that overlaps both these values. It is possible to reconcile the data from these gases if significant loss of solar wind Ar, Kr and presumably Xe has occurred relative to the SEP component, most likely by erosive processes that are mass independent, although mass-dependent losses (Ar greater than Kr greater than Xe) cannot be excluded. If such losses did occur, the SEP contribution to the solar implanted gases must have been no more than a few percent. Nitrogen is a mixture of indigenous meteoritic N, whose isotopic composition is inferred to be relatively light, and implanted solar N, which has probably undergone diffusive redistribution and fractionation. If the heavy noble gases have not undergone diffusive loss, then N/Ar in the solar wind can be inferred to be at least several times the accepted solar ratio. The solar wind N appears, even after correction for fractionation effects, to have a minimum delta N-15 value equal to or greater than +150% and a more probable value equal to or greater than +200%.|

Grains from lunar samples 71501 and 79035, believed to have been exposed to solar corpuscular radiation at greatly different times, were studied. The results found were consistent with the hypothesis that in addition to solar-wind-implanted gas, a second more deeply implanted component was present in both species of grains. Average isotopic ratios were determined giving equal weight to each of the particles. As found in depth studies employing chemical etching, both the He-3/He-4 and Ne-20/Ne-22 ratios were lower in the more deeply implanted gas than in the solar wind component. The He-3/He-4 ratio in the solar wind component of the more ancient grains was lower than that in the more recently exposed ones, whereas no difference was found for the more deeply embedded He. In the deeply embedded component of the ancient grains, the He-4/Ne-20 ratio was approx. 2x that found in the more recently exposed grains. In the shallowly implanted component, the ratio varied greatly from grain to grain, preventing comparison with the solar wind elemental composition.|

H., Jr., Hohenberg, C. M., Olinger, C. T.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|58|2|1031|Solar implanted helium, neon, and argon were extracted from individual ilmenite grains from lunar soil 71501 and soil breccia 79035 using laser vaporization and analyzed by static mass spectrometry. Clear differences were observed for these two grain populations, one from a contemporary soil and the other from an ancient soil exposed on the lunar surface approximately 1 Ga ago. The different trends between the <SUP>20</SUP>Ne /<SUP>22</SUP>Ne ratios and the He/Ne ratios do not simply reflect differences either in regolith gardening or in diffusive losses but rather suggest a greater relative helium abundance in the ancient solar wind by a factor of about 1.8. The majority of the grains are enriched in solar energetic particle (SEP) Ne relative to solar wind (SW) Ne in a manner that increases with surface exposure. The progressive enrichment in retained SEP Ne relative to SW Ne is explained by a combination of diffusion and nonfractionating losses of the less deeply implanted SW component. The neon isotopic differences observed in various analyses of ilmenite separates from these two soils and previously attributed to a secular variation of either the SW/SEP flux ratio or the SW Ne isotopic composition may alternatively be a natural consequence of greater SW losses which accompany an enhanced helium flux in the ancient solar wind.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(94)90524-X
1993Metic..28Q.412N|1993|Extraction of He and NE from Individual Lunar Ilmenite Grains by Pulse Heating|Nier, A. O., Schlutter, D. J.|Meteoritics|28|3|412|The pulse-heating technique employed for extracting helium and neon from individual interplanetary dust particles [1] has been extended to a similar study of individual lunar grains. A succession of 5-s constant power pulses is applied to the oven holding the particle. The power is increased in 0.25-W increments until all the gas is removed. The peak temperature reached during a pulse lasts about 2 s and increases by roughly 75 degrees C for each 0.25-W increment in power. In the present investigation six individual ilmenite grains of lunar soil 71501 and of breccia 79035 were studied. It was felt that this method of extracting the gas might help in distinguishing between surface embedded solar wind (SW) particles and more deeply embedded constituents such as solar energetic particles (SEP) [2], or gas of trapped or primordial origin. Although only six particles of each type have been studied to date, interesting results are beginning to emerge. For example, for both types of particles, for the initial low power pulses where the maximum pulse temperature does not exceed 500 degrees C, the ^3He/^4He ratio falls near 4 x 10^-4, as expected, if the helium is primarily unfractionated solar wind implanted near the surface. As the pulse temperature is increased to around 1000 degrees C and the solar wind gas presumably has been removed, the ^3He/^4He ratio falls to around 2.5 x 10^-4, in rough agreement with the layer etching results [2]. Likewise, the ^20Ne/^22Ne ratio falls from around 14 to a value near 12, as in the etching experiments [2]. In the case of ^4He/^20Ne ratios there appears to be a real difference between the particles from the two ilmenites. For the 79035 grains, the ratio falls from around 600 for the surface gas to around 150 for the later high-temperature extractions. On the other hand, for the 71501 grains, the ratio starts somewhat lower, near 400, and drops below 100 as the pulse temperature is raised. A qualitatively similar difference was observed in the total gas released by laser beam extractions performed on single grains from the same lunar ilmenite samples [3]. While there is considerable scatter in the data, the overall results are gratifying, and should become more definitive as more particles are investigated. The initial releases, almost certainly from the surfaces of the particles, come closer to the solar wind values [4] than generally reported for lunar grains. It will be interesting to see whether or not the differences observed are real and have a bearing on the general problem of the variation of the solar wind with time [5].

The gases appear to be distributed between two distinct reservoirs in the ilmenite, defined by release patterns and isotopic considerations. One of the reservoirs, near grain surfaces, yields elemental ratios that for the most part are "solar" while the other, sited at greater depths within grains, has severely fractionated elemental abundances and generally heavier isotopic ratios as well. Xenon provides an exception to the solar abundance pattern in the near-surface reservoir, being enhanced by about a factor of 2 relative to the expected value. A comparison of the 79035 separate with a previously analyzed ilmenite from soil 71501, which received its solar wind exposure much more recently, indicates that the two-fold xenon enhancement occurs in the fractionated reservoir as well as the "solar" one, and that it may therefore be attributable to a change in the solar wind elemental abundances. Other differences between the two ilmenites occur in helium and neon isotopic ratios and in He/Ar elemental ratios. Since mineralogical influences on retentivities of the gases in the two samples should be the same, and possible contributions of non-solar wind components to one ilmenite in preference to the other can generally be eliminated or accounted for, all of these differences may reflect changes in the solar wind over time.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(89)90219-6

The two reservoirs correspond to a saturated highly radiation-damaged 300 A surface layer with strongly fractionated implanted gases and a less damaged zone underneath which is populated by range straggling of incident solar wind ions and, to a lesser extent, by ions from the high energetic tail of the Maxwellian velocity distribution of the solar wind. The absence of parentless Ar-40 in the deeper region excludes the possibility that this zone is populated by solid state diffusion. For the first time, parentless Ar-40 has been physically separated from Ar-36. The transient K-coating hypothesis is not feasible.|

A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||3645|Rhodes et al. (1975, 1976) and Adams et al. (1975) have reported that the agglutinate fraction of the soils on the lunar surface displays a marked enrichment in Fe, Mg, Ti, K, and La, and a depletion in Ca, Na, Al, and Eu, relative to the bulk soils. The reported investigation is concerned with a testing of the theory of chemical fractionation involving magnetic separation which was developed in connection with these findings. Soils 64421 and 71501 were sieved and the magnetic fractions separated according to the method developed by Adams and McCord (1973). Analyses of agglutinitic glass did not indicate any appreciable chemical fractionation for the major and minor elements accompanying the agglutination process. It was found that most, if not all fractionations reported can be accounted for completely by the magnetic nonagglutinate impurities in the agglutinate fraction. It is, therefore, concluded that there appears to be no reason to make use of any chemical fractionation theory, whose validity remains to be demonstrated.|

W.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||2963|Gas conductances and diffusivities have been experimentally determined for He-4, Ar-40, and Kr-83 gas through lunar soil 71501,1 and a basalt lunar soil simulant. Values of diffusivity as a function of density at 24 C under steady-state molecular gas flow conditions for the lunar and simulant soils were found to be identical within experimental limits. Gas diffusivities were found to be inversely proportional to density with diffusivities for the heavier argon and krypton molecules being smaller than that for helium. A general description of the diffusivities was found to be radical (MD) = (75/rho)-33, where D is diffusivity and M the molecular weight of the gas under consideration.|
