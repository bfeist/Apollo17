S., Isheim, Dieter, Seidman, David N., Wieler, Rainer, Heck, Philipp R.|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|55|2|426|The surfaces of airless bodies, such as the Moon and asteroids, are subject to space weathering, which alters the mineralogy of the upper tens of nanometers of grain surfaces. Atom probe tomography (APT) has the appropriate 3-D spatial resolution and analytical sensitivity to investigate such features at the nanometer scale. Here, we demonstrate that APT can be successfully used to characterize the composition and texture of space weathering products in ilmenite from Apollo 17 sample 71501 at near-atomic resolution. Two of the studied nanotips sampled the top surface of the space-weathered grain, while another nanotip sampled the ilmenite at about 50 nm below the surface. These nanotips contain small nanophase Fe particles (~3 to 10 nm diameter), with these particles becoming less frequent with depth. One of the nanotips contains a sequence of space weathering products, compositional zoning, and a void space (~15 nm in diameter) which we interpret as a vesicle generated by solar wind irradiation. No noble gases were detected in this vesicle, although there is evidence for <SUP>4</SUP>He elsewhere in the nanotip. This lunar soil grain exhibits the same space weathering features that have been well documented in transmission electron microscope studies of lunar and Itokawa asteroidal regolith grains.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maps.13443

L., Wang, Alian|Icarus|226|1|891|Much work has been devoted to the correlation between the remotely sensed UV-VIS slope and the TiO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration of the lunar surface, and this correlation has been used to map the lunar surface TiO<SUB>2</SUB> distributions using data obtained from various missions. However, additional work is needed to fully evaluate the UV-VIS-TiO<SUB>2</SUB> correlation. Such work would help ongoing efforts to improve TiO<SUB>2</SUB> mapping (e.g., as currently underway with LROC Wide Angle Camera (WAC) data). To evaluate the UV-VIS-TiO<SUB>2</SUB> correlation, we are investigating soil petrographic factors (e.g., modal abundances of Ti bearing minerals, lithic, and glass hosts, ilmenite morphology, grain size, and maturity) that may influence the spectra. This “ground truth” approach will be useful in comparing between sample information and laboratory spectra to investigate the influence of petrographic factors on the spectra. In this work, we report the quantitative results of a systematic laboratory investigation of three size fractions (210-100 μm, 100-48 μm, 48-20 μm) of two high Ti lunar soils 10084 and 71501 using a combined digital imaging (backscattered electron image and X-ray maps) method. For each size fraction, the results include: (1) the modal abundances for single phase minerals and lithologic components; (2) the Ti distributions among Ti host components; and (3) the shape of ilmenite grains. We compile and compare the data together for the three size fractions of the two high Ti soils with different maturities as well as data from previous studies. Future work will include the investigation of finer size fractions (&lt;20 μm) and more samples (Apollo 12, Apollo 15) covering a larger range of Ti concentration and maturity, and comparison with their spectra.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2013.07.007

C., Wang, Alian, Jolliff, Bradley L.|Icarus|211|1|101|Laser Raman spectroscopy is used to investigate four lunar soils, focusing on mineralogy of grains of &lt;45 μm size. Apollo samples 14163, 15271, 67511, and 71501 were selected as endmembers to study, based on their soil chemistry, maturity, and sample locations. Typical Raman spectral features for major and minor lunar minerals are discussed on the basis of major vibrational modes. We used the Raman peak shift to calculate Mg/(Mg + Fe + Ca) and Ca/(Mg + Fe + Ca) for pyroxene and Mg/(Mg + Fe) for olivine, and thus obtained the compositional distributions of these two minerals in each of the four lunar soils. Classification of feldspar grains was made based on recognition of their Raman patterns. A Raman point-counting procedure was applied to derive mineral modes of the soils, and these are found to be consistent with published modal analysis of these soils. The compositional distributions of pyroxene and olivine grains in each soil sample, as well as the mineral modes, reflect characteristics of the main source materials for these soils. Raman patterns and peak positions also reflect shock effects on plagioclase and quartz, found in 14163.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2010.08.020

The compositions of these impact glasses show that some have been produced by impact events within the Apollo 17 region, whereas others appear to be exotic to the landing site.

Samples and simulants of lunar soil must be established for these studies. We present here the bulk and mineral chemistries of unusual Apollo 17 sample 70051, the &lt;45-μm fraction of 70051, and the bulk and mineral chemistries of lunar soil simulants MLS-1A, JSC-1A, and JSC-1Af. Comparison to lunar soils collected during the Apollo missions shows that 70051 has bulk chemistry similar to that of soils from the North Massif bounding the Valley of Taurus-Littrow. Particle-size distribution reveals 70051 to differ significantly from bona fide lunar soils. It is a coarse, immature sample with &gt;80 % of particles &gt;50 μm, and a constrained range of particle sizes (~50% of particles are 50-100 μm in size) when compared to typical Apollo 17 soils (e.g., 71501,1 has ~20% of particles in the 50-100 μm range). Plagioclase, present in rock fragments and as mineral fragments (up to sizes ~1 mm), is the main phase present (50.5 vol%). Simulant JSC-1A has a chemistry that is atypical for most of the Moon and contains 49.3 vol% glass. Simulant MLS-1A resembles the FeO, TiO<SUB>2</SUB> and Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB> contents of mare basalt soils. Both lunar soil simulants have specific properties for certain in situ resource utilization studies, however, neither fully matches both the physical and chemical characteristics of lunar soil. Sample 70051, as a 1.4-kg haphazard mixture of lunar soil particles, is probably the best of the Apollo ``soil'' samples to be allocated for various ISRU investigations, where the uniqueness of lunar soils is deemed a necessity for study.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2006JE002767
1999GeCoA..63.2145P|1999|Irradiation records in regolith materials, I: Isotopic compositions of solar-wind neon and argon in single lunar mineral grains|Pepin, R. O., Becker, R. H., Schlutter, D. J.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|63|13|2145|We have applied a stepwise pyrolytic extraction technique to eleven individual lunar regolith grains to investigate the compositions of light noble gases embedded in grain surfaces by solar wind irradiation, with emphasis on the rather poorly known isotopic composition of solar-wind argon. Results are intriguing: average <SUP>20</SUP>Ne/ <SUP>22</SUP>Ne ratios observed in early pyrolytic releases from ilmenite grains separated from lunar soils 71501, 79035 and 10084 agree very well with both direct measures of the solar wind neon composition in the Apollo foils and with values obtained in first releases from acid-etched ilmenites by the Zürich laboratory, whereas these same pyrolytic and acid-etch fractions carry argon isotopic signatures that significantly disagree - average <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>38</SUP>Ar ratios near 5.8 for thermal extraction compared to 5.4-5.5 for chemical etching at Zürich. Consideration of the isotopic and elemental data from these grains in the context of first-order diffusive modeling calculations points to gas release at low temperatures, without significant isotopic or elemental fractionation, from isolated grain-surface reservoirs of solar wind composition. The physical nature of these reservoirs is presently unknown. In this interpretation the preferred solar wind <SUP>20</SUP>Ne/ <SUP>22</SUP>Ne and <SUP>21</SUP>Ne/ <SUP>22</SUP>Ne ratios deduced from this study are respectively 13.81 ± 0.08 and 0.0333 ± 0.0003, both within error of the Zürich acid-etch values, and <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>38</SUP>Ar = 5.77 ± 0.08. It may be possible to reconcile the discrepancy between the acid-etch and pyrolytic estimates for the solar wind <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>38</SUP>Ar ratio in the context of arguments originally advanced by Benkert et al. (1993) to account for their He and Ne isotopic compositions. At the other, high-temperature end of the release profile from one of these grains there are clear isotopic indications of the presence of a Ne constituent with <SUP>20</SUP>Ne/ <SUP>22</SUP>Ne close to the 11.2 ratio found at Zürich and attributed by these workers to a deeply-sited component implanted by solar energetic particles.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00002-2
1993Metic..28Q.412N|1993|Extraction of He and NE from Individual Lunar Ilmenite Grains by Pulse Heating|Nier, A. O., Schlutter, D. J.|Meteoritics|28|3|412|The pulse-heating technique employed for extracting helium and neon from individual interplanetary dust particles [1] has been extended to a similar study of individual lunar grains. A succession of 5-s constant power pulses is applied to the oven holding the particle. The power is increased in 0.25-W increments until all the gas is removed. The peak temperature reached during a pulse lasts about 2 s and increases by roughly 75 degrees C for each 0.25-W increment in power. In the present investigation six individual ilmenite grains of lunar soil 71501 and of breccia 79035 were studied. It was felt that this method of extracting the gas might help in distinguishing between surface embedded solar wind (SW) particles and more deeply embedded constituents such as solar energetic particles (SEP) [2], or gas of trapped or primordial origin. Although only six particles of each type have been studied to date, interesting results are beginning to emerge. For example, for both types of particles, for the initial low power pulses where the maximum pulse temperature does not exceed 500 degrees C, the ^3He/^4He ratio falls near 4 x 10^-4, as expected, if the helium is primarily unfractionated solar wind implanted near the surface. As the pulse temperature is increased to around 1000 degrees C and the solar wind gas presumably has been removed, the ^3He/^4He ratio falls to around 2.5 x 10^-4, in rough agreement with the layer etching results [2]. Likewise, the ^20Ne/^22Ne ratio falls from around 14 to a value near 12, as in the etching experiments [2]. In the case of ^4He/^20Ne ratios there appears to be a real difference between the particles from the two ilmenites. For the 79035 grains, the ratio falls from around 600 for the surface gas to around 150 for the later high-temperature extractions. On the other hand, for the 71501 grains, the ratio starts somewhat lower, near 400, and drops below 100 as the pulse temperature is raised. A qualitatively similar difference was observed in the total gas released by laser beam extractions performed on single grains from the same lunar ilmenite samples [3]. While there is considerable scatter in the data, the overall results are gratifying, and should become more definitive as more particles are investigated. The initial releases, almost certainly from the surfaces of the particles, come closer to the solar wind values [4] than generally reported for lunar grains. It will be interesting to see whether or not the differences observed are real and have a bearing on the general problem of the variation of the solar wind with time [5].

1993JGR....9813147B|1993|He, Ne, and Ar from the solar wind and solar energetic particles in lunar ilmenites and pyroxenes|Benkert, J. -P., Baur, H., Signer, P., Wieler, R.|Journal of Geophysical Research|98|E7|13147|He, Ne, and Ar in ilmenite and pyroxene separates from two lunar regolith samples exposed to the solar corpuscular radiation at widely different epochs were analyzed by the closed system stepped etching technique. This method avoids element or isotope fractionation due to diffusion during the experiment and thus depth profiles of element and isotopic composition of implanted solar noble gases can be determined. Ilmenites from a relatively recently irradiated soil release in the first steps He and Ne with isotopic compositions identical to modern solar wind values. We conclude that ilmenite retains isotopically unfractionated He, Ne, and Ar from the solar wind (SW) in the outermost grain layers. The isotopic composition of SW noble gases has remained constant over the last 100 Ma but there is some evidence for a slight change over a Ga timescale. The ratio <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/<SUP>38</SUP>Ar in the solar wind is 2-3% larger than that in the terrestrial atmosphere. We give further evidence for the identification of a solar energetic particle component (SEP), which was implanted with energies exceeding those in the solar wind. All ilmenites and pyroxenes contain SEP-Ne with <SUP>20</SUP>Ne/<SUP>22</SUP>Ne=11.2+/-0.2, in agreement with SEP-Ne found earlier in lunar plagioclase. (<SUP>21</SUP>Ne/<SUP>22</SUP>Ne)<SUB>SEP</SUB> is consistent with SEP-Ne being derived from SW-Ne by mass dependent fractionation. In addition, the new data reveal SEP-He and SEP-Ar, both isotopically heavier than the SW components. The isotopic fractionation factors required to relate SW and SEP gases are approximately equal to the square of the mass ratios. Element ratios in the SEP dominated steps are similar (He:Ar) or identical (Ne:Ar) to present-day solar wind values, indicating little or no element fractionation in the SEP reservoir.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/93JE01460
1989GeCoA..53.1135B|1989|Long-term changes in solar wind elemental and isotopic ratios: A comparison of two lunar ilmenites of different antiquities|Becker, R. H., Pepin, R. O.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|53|5|1135|An ilmenite separate from lunar regolith breccia 79035, a sample presumed to have been exposed to solar wind more than 2 Ga ago, was analyzed for noble gas and nitrogen elemental and isotopic abundances by stepwise oxidation and pyrolysis. The gases appear to be distributed between two distinct reservoirs in the ilmenite, defined by release patterns and isotopic considerations. One of the reservoirs, near grain surfaces, yields elemental ratios that for the most part are "solar" while the other, sited at greater depths within grains, has severely fractionated elemental abundances and generally heavier isotopic ratios as well. Xenon provides an exception to the solar abundance pattern in the near-surface reservoir, being enhanced by about a factor of 2 relative to the expected value. A comparison of the 79035 separate with a previously analyzed ilmenite from soil 71501, which received its solar wind exposure much more recently, indicates that the two-fold xenon enhancement occurs in the fractionated reservoir as well as the "solar" one, and that it may therefore be attributable to a change in the solar wind elemental abundances. Other differences between the two ilmenites occur in helium and neon isotopic ratios and in He/Ar elemental ratios. Since mineralogical influences on retentivities of the gases in the two samples should be the same, and possible contributions of non-solar wind components to one ilmenite in preference to the other can generally be eliminated or accounted for, all of these differences may reflect changes in the solar wind over time.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(89)90219-6

He, Ne, Ar and solar flare tracks are measured on plagioclase separates of 12 surface soils and two Apollo 15 drill core samples, and track density histograms are compared with gas concentration distributions obtained from aliquot samples. Results show that solar wind Ar is probably well retained in all minerals. He, Ne, and Ar are not saturated macroscopically, and semi-microscopic or microscopic saturation is very rare for Ar, even in gas-rich plagioclase populations. All grains contain trapped noble gases, even in relatively gas-poor mineral populations, and for clean minerals in the size range of 150-200 microns, the time between the first and last surface exposure is in the order of 10 to the 7th to 10 to the 8th years.|
