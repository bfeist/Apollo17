W.|Earth, Planets, and Space|68||11|Argon isotopic data is used to assess the potential of low-mass samples collected by sample return missions on planetary objects (e.g., Moon, Mars, asteroids), to reveal planetary surface processes. We report the first <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/<SUP>39</SUP>Ar ages and <SUP>38</SUP>Ar cosmic ray exposure (CRE) ages, determined for eleven submillimeter-sized (ranging from 0.06 to 1.2 mg) plagioclase-rich lithic fragments from Apollo 17 regolith sample 78461 collected at the base of the Sculptured Hills. Total fusion analysis was used to outgas argon from the lithic fragments. Three different approaches were used to determine <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/<SUP>39</SUP>Ar ages and illustrate the sensitivity of age determination to the choice of trapped (<SUP>40</SUP>Ar/<SUP>36</SUP>Ar)<SUB>t</SUB>. <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/<SUP>39</SUP>Ar ages range from ~4.0 to 4.4 Ga with one exception (Plag#10). Surface CRE ages, based on <SUP>38</SUP>Ar, range from ~1 to 24 Ma. The relatively young CRE ages suggest recent re-working of the upper few centimeters of the regolith. The CRE ages may result from the effect of downslope movement of materials to the base of the Sculptured Hills from higher elevations. The apparent <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/<SUP>39</SUP>Ar age for Plag#10 is &gt;5 Ga and yielded the oldest CRE age (i.e., ~24 Ma). We interpret this data to indicate the presence of parentless <SUP>40</SUP>Ar in Plag#10, originating in the lunar atmosphere and implanted in lunar regolith by solar wind. Based on a chemical mixing model, plagioclase compositions, and <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/<SUP>39</SUP>Ar ages, we conclude that lithic fragments originated from Mg-suite of highland rocks, and none were derived from the mare region.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40623-016-0381-9

V.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2287|Surface exposure (or, equivalently, maturity) indices of lunar soils are a measure of residence time of soil in the upper one millimeter of the regolith. Several concepts concerning the use of and terminology associated with maturity indices are discussed. For reasons which include its generally-applicable nature and large data base, the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) surface exposure (maturity) index I<SUB>s/FeO</SUB> (the ratio of the value of the intensity in arbitrary units of the FMR resonance at g equal to about 2.1 to the FeO concentration) is particularly suitable and useful. A compilation of values of I<SUB>s/FeO</SUB> for 164 Apollo surface and trench soils and six Luna 24 core soils is given.|
