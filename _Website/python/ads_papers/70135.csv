2015E&PSL.423..114D|2015|Highly siderophile element depletion in the Moon|Day, James M. D., Walker, Richard J.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|423||114|Coupled <SUP>187</SUP>Os/<SUP>188</SUP>Os and highly siderophile element (HSE: Os, Ir, Ru, Pt, Pd, Re) abundance data are reported for Apollo 12 (12005, 12009, 12019, 12022, 12038, 12039, 12040), Apollo 15 (15555) and Apollo 17 (70135) mare basalts, along with mare basalt meteorites La Paz icefield (LAP) 04841 and Miller Range (MIL) 05035. These mare basalts have consistently low HSE abundances, at ∼ 2 ×10<SUP>-5</SUP> to 2 ×10<SUP>-7</SUP> the chondritic abundance. The most magnesian samples have broadly chondrite-relative HSE abundances and chondritic measured and calculated initial <SUP>187</SUP>Os/<SUP>188</SUP>Os. The lower abundances and fractionated HSE compositions of more evolved mare basalts can be reproduced by modeling crystal-liquid fractionation using rock/melt bulk-partition coefficients of ∼2 for Os, Ir, Ru, Pt and Pd and ∼1.5 for Re. Lunar mare basalt bulk-partition coefficients are probably higher than for terrestrial melts as a result of more reducing conditions, leading to increased HSE compatibility. The chondritic-relative abundances and chondritic <SUP>187</SUP>Os/<SUP>188</SUP>Os of the most primitive high-MgO mare basalts cannot readily be explained through regolith contamination during emplacement at the lunar surface. Mare basalt compositions are best modeled as representing ∼5-11% partial melting of metal-free sources with low Os, Ir, Ru, Pd (∼0.1 ng g<SUP>-1</SUP>), Pt (∼0.2 ng g<SUP>-1</SUP>), Re (∼0.01 ng g<SUP>-1</SUP>) and S (∼75 μg g<SUP>-1</SUP>), with sulphide-melt partitioning between 1000 and 10,000. Apollo 12 olivine-, pigeonite- and ilmenite normative mare basalts define an imprecise <SUP>187</SUP>Re-<SUP>187</SUP>Os age of 3.0 ± 0.9 Ga with an initial <SUP>187</SUP>Os/<SUP>188</SUP>Os of 0.107 ± 0.010. This age is within uncertainty of <SUP>147</SUP>Sm-<SUP>143</SUP>Nd ages for the samples. The initial Os isotopic composition of Apollo 12 samples indicates that the source of these rocks evolved with Re/Os within ∼10% of chondrite meteorites, from the time that the mantle source became a system closed to siderophile additions, to the time that the basalts erupted. Similarity in absolute HSE abundances between mare basalts from the Apollo 12, 15 and 17 sites, and from unknown regions of the Moon (La Paz mare basalts, MIL 05035), indicates relatively homogeneous and low HSE abundances within the lunar interior. Low absolute HSE abundances and chondritic Re/Os of mare basalts are consistent with a late accretion addition of ∼0.02 wt.% of the Moon's mass to the mantle, prior to the formation of the lunar crust. Late accretion must also have occurred significantly prior to cessation of lunar mantle differentiation (>4.4 Ga), to enable efficient mixing and homogenization within the mantle. Low lunar HSE abundances are consistent with proportionally 40 times more late accretion to Earth than the Moon. Disproportional late accretion to the two bodies is consistent with the small <SUP>182</SUP>W excess (∼21-28 ppm) measured in lunar rocks, compared to the silicate Earth.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2015.05.001
1999nvm..conf...36K|1999|Lunar Meteorites and Implications for Compositional Remote Sensing of the Lunar Surface|Korotev, R. L.|New Views of the Moon 2: Understanding the Moon Through the Integration of Diverse Datasets|||36|Lunar meteorites (LMs) are rocks found on Earth that were ejected from the Moon by impact of an asteroidal meteoroid. Three factors make the LMs important to remote-sensing studies: (1) Most are breccias composed of regolith or fragmental material; (2) all are rocks that resided (or breccias composed of material that resided) in the upper few meters of the Moon prior to launch and (3) most apparently come from areas distant from the Apollo sites. How Many Lunar Locations? At this writing (June 1999), there are 18 known lunar meteorite specimens. When unambiguous cases of terrestrial pairing are considered, the number of actual LMs reduces to 13. (Terrestrial pairing is when a single piece of lunar rock entered Earth's atmosphere, but multiple fragments were produced because the meteoroid broke apart on entry, upon hitting the ground or ice, or while being transported through the ice.) We have no reason to believe that LMs preferentially derive from any specific region(s) of the Moon; i.e., we believe that they are samples from random locations. However, we do not know how many different locations are represented by the LMs; mathematically, it could be as few as 1 or as many as 13. The actual maximum is < 13 because in some cases a single impact appears to have yielded more than one LM. Yamato 793169 and Asuka 881757 are considered "source-crater paired" or "launch paired" because they are compositionally and petrographically similar to each other and distinct from the others, and both have similar cosmic-ray exposure (CRE) histories. The same can be said of QUE 94281 and Y 793274. Thus the 13 meteorites probably represent a maximum of 11 locations on the Moon. The minimum number of likely source craters is debated and in flux as new data for different isotopic systems are obtained. Conservatively, considering CRE data only, a minimum of about 5 impacts is required. Compositional and petrographic data offer only probabilistic constraints. An extreme, but not unreasonable viewpoint, is that such data offer no constraint. For example, if one were to cut up the Apollo 17 landing site (which was selected for its diversity) into softball-sized pieces, some of those pieces (e.g., sample 70135) would be crystalline mare basalts like Y 793169 whereas others (e.g., sample 73131 would be feldspathic regolith breccias like MAC 88104/ 88105. However, nature is not so devious. Warren argues that LMs come from craters of only a few kilometers in diameter. If so, even though CRE data allow, for example, that ALHA 81005 and Y 791197) were launched simultaneously from the same crater, the probability is nevertheless low because the two meteorites are compositionally and mineralogically distinct. Thus, within the allowed range (5-11) for the number of locations represented by the LMs, values at the high end of the range are probably more likely. Mare Meteorites: Three LMs consist almost entirely of mare basalt. Two, Y 793169 and Asuka 881757, are unbrecciated, low-Ti, crystalline rocks that are compositionally and mineralogically similar (but not identical) to each other; they probably derive from a single lunar-mare location. The third, EET 87521/96008, is a fragmental breccia consisting predominantly of VLT mare basalt. Thus, these LMs probably represent only two lunar mare locations. The basaltic LMs have mineral and bulk compositions distinct from Apollo mare basalts. The petrography of Calcalong Creek has not been described in detail, but compositionally it is unique in that it corresponds to a mixture (breccia) of about one-half feldspathic material (i.e., the mean composition of the feldspathic lunar meteorites, below), one-fourth KREEP norite, one-fourth VLT mare basalt (like EET 87521), and 1% CI chondrite. With 4 micro g/g Th and correspondingly high concentrations of other incompatible elements, it is the only lunar meteorite that is likely to have come from within the Procellarum KREEP Terrane (PKT). Yamato 793274 and QUE 94281 are together distinct in being fragmental breccias containing subequal parts of feldspathic highland material and VLT mare basalt. Jolliff et al. estimate a mare to highland ratio of 54:46 for QUE 94281 and 62:38 for Y 793274; this difference is well within the range observed for soils collected only centimeters apart (in cores) at interface site like Apollo 15 and 17 [11]. Although the two meteorites were found on opposite sides of Antarctica, they are probably launch-paired. The strongest evidence is that the pyroclastic glass spherules that occur in both are of two compositional groups and the two groups are essentially the same in both meteorites. Yamato 791197 is nominally a feldspathic lunar meteorite (below), but among FLMs, it probably contains the highest abundance of clasts and glasses of mare derivation. As a consequence, its composition is at the high-Fe, low-Mg end of the range for FLMs and is not included in the FLM average of Table 1. Its composition is consistent with about 10% mare-derived material. Similarly, the two small (Y 82) pieces of Y 82192/82193186032 are more mafic than the large (Y 86) piece, probably as a result of about 7% mare-derived material. All Apollo missions went to areas in or near the PKT, and, consequently, all Apollo regolith samples are contaminated with Th-rich material from the PKT. At the nominally "typical" highland site, Apollo 16, about 30% of the regolith (<1-mm fines) is Th-rich ejecta from the Imbrium impact and about 6% is mare material probably derived from mare basins. Thus Apollo 16 regolith is not typical of the highlands. Among Apollo rocks, the compositions of the FLMs correspond most closely to the feldspathic granulitic breccias of Apollo 16 and 17.

L.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|59|13|2817|Now-extinct <SUP>146</SUP>Sm (t<SUB>1/2</SUB>= 103Ma) was present in the early solar system, and lunar basalts might be expected to have inherited small anomalies in <SUP>142</SUP>Nd abundances from mantle sources with variable Sm/Nd ratios established during the early global differentiation of the Moon. <SUP>142</SUP>Nd/<SUP>144</SUP>Nd ratios were measured for several lunar basalts, and values of ∊Nd142, (deviations from terrestrial <SUP>142</SUP>Nd/<SUP>144</SUP>Nd in parts in 10<SUP>4</SUP>) calculated for them. The ∊Nd142 values show very small variations attributable to <SUP>146</SUP>Sm decay. Neutron capture near the lunar surface also modified both the samarium and neodymium isotopic compositions of the basalt samples. The calculated neutron fluences range from ̃0 to ̃7.8 × 10<SUP>16</SUP> n/cm<SUP>2</SUP>. Both thermal and epithermal neutron fluences were calculated from the Sm isotopic compositions of the basalts and used to correct the ∊Nd142 values for neutron capture by neodymium. Well-resolved radiogenic enrichments ∊Nd142 and +0.17 ± 0.08 (2σ), respectively, were measured for lunar meteorite Asuka 881757 and Apollo 17 basalt 74255, respectively, for which the neutron fluences were nil. Basalts 70135 and 75075, which were exposed to small, measureable neutron fluences of ̃2.5 × 10<SUP>15</SUP> and ̃7.7 × 10<SUP>15</SUP> n/cm<SUP>2</SUP>, respectively, have neutron-corrected ∊Nd142 values of +0.25± 0.15 and +0.29 ± 0.11, respectively. The average value of radiogenic ∊Nd142 for the three high-Ti basalts from Apollo 17 is +0.22 ± 0.06. Neutron capture effects were greater for the other basalts, but can be corrected using the measured neutron fluences derived from the samarium isotopic data. The neutron-corrected ∊Nd142 for Apollo 12 ilmenite basalt 12056, consistent with its derivation from a highly depleted mantle source also. Three low-Ti basalts from Apollo 12 and Apollo 15 (12038, 15076, 15555), have neutron corrected ∊Nd142 which are not resolved from zero, and average +0.04 ± 0.06. A fourth low-Ti basalt, 12039, has neutron-corrected ∊Nd142, but is subject to the largest neutron correction of ̃0.32 ∊-units. KREEP basalt 14078 was exposed to only a small neutron fluence of ̃6.4 × 10<SUP>15</SUP> n/cm<SUP>2</SUP>, and has a small deficit of <SUP>142</SUP>Nd, corresponding to ∊Nd142. The average neutron-corrected ∊Nd142 of three KREEP basalts is -0.05 ± 0.04. The ∊Nd142 values of the basalts correlate with <SUP>147</SUP>Sm/<SUP>144</SUP>Nd values for their source regions as calculated from their ages and initial ∊Nd142 values. <SUP>147</SUP>Sm- <SUP>143</SUP>Nd and <SUP>146</SUP>Sm- <SUP>142</SUP>Nd systematics were combined in a three-stage model yielding an isochron equation for the lunar mantle formation interval, which was calculated to be 238<SUB>-40</SUB><SUP>+56</SUP> Ma (2σ). Sm/Nd ratios for the source regions also are derived from the model and compare favorably with values from conventional geochemical models of mare basalt petrogenesis. If the Moon were formed by impact of a large, Mars-sized planetesimal with the Earth, the impact was early enough that the lunar mantle cooled to neodymium isotopic closure by ̃4.32 Ga ago. The bulk lunar ∊moon142 evaluated from the mantle isochron at (<SUP>147</SUP>Sm/<SUP>144</SUP>Nd)<SUB>CHUR</SUB> = 0.1967 is -0.01 ± 0.03 (2σ), consistent with derivation of lunar and terrestrial neodymium from a common reservoir.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(95)00175-Y
1993LPI....24.1095N|1993|^{146,147}Sm-^{142,143}Nd Formation Interval for the Lunar Mantle and Implications for Lunar Evolution|Nyquist, L. E., Shih, C. -Y., Wiesmann, H., Bansal, B. M.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference|24||1095|Small anomalies in the isotopic abundance of Nd-142 have been measured for two A17 high-Ti basalts, ilmenite basalt 12056, olivine-pigeonite basalt 12039, feldspathic basalt 12038, and two KREEP basalts. These anomalies correlate with Sm-147/Nd-144 for the basalt source regions as calculated from initial Nd-143/Nd-144 ratios in the basalts, and are interpreted to be from decay of Sm-146 (t<SUB>1/2</SUB> = 103 Ma) in distinct lunar mantle reservoirs. A three-stage model for evolution of Nd-143/Nd-144 and Nd-142/Nd-144 yields reservoir Sm-147/Nd-144 ratios which, with the Nd-142/Nd-144 ratios in the basalts, form a 'mantle isochron' giving a lunar mantle formation interval of 94+2230 Ma (2c(rho)). Calculated reservoir Sm/Nd ratios are in the range expected from some earlier models of basalt petrogenesis. The isochron value of Nd-142/Nd-144 at Sm-147/Nd-144<SUB>CHUR</SUB> = 0.1967 is within error limits of the average Nd-142/Nd-144 measured for an L6 chondrite, an H5 chondrite, and the Orgueil carbonaceous chondrite. Evolution of Nd-143 and Nd-142 for high-Ti basalt 70135 was modeled precisely, starting from chondritic relative REE and Nd-isotopic abundances and using the initial (Sm-146/Sm-144)<SUB>0</SUB> ratio inferred from a previous study of angrite LEW86010 as the initial solar system value of this parameter. We infer that the initial Sm/Nd ratio in precursor lunar materials was very nearly chondritic (within approximately 8 percent) prior to lunar differentiation.|
