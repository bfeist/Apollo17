R.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference|27||1415|Since the discovery of very low-Ti (VLT) basalts as tiny clasts and glasses in Apollo 17 drill cores, VLT basalts have been recognized as an important lunar rock type. Lunar sample 78526 (8.77 g), our largest specimen of VLT basaltic composition, is an impact melt composed of vitrophyric green glass with minor lithic and mineral inclusions. Major and trace element abundances of bulk 78526 are intermediate between those of Apollo 17 VLT basalt fragments, but the lithic clasts are less well-defined because no trace element data are available. This work utilizes a micro-coring technique to extract microgram-sized samples from a thin-section of 78526, and micro-INAA techniques to obtain trace element abundances. The results show that the two major clasts are distinct from bulk 78526, but are similar to several VLT basalt clasts found in a highland breccia, 72235.|

T., Anders, E.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1537|Radiochemical neutron activation analyses for Ag, Au, Bi, Br, Cd, Cs, Ge, In, Ir, Ni, Os, Pd, Rb, Re, Sb, Te, Tl, U and Zn were carried out on 11 samples from the Apollo 11 and 12 sites (two samples of rock 12013, one granitic and one KREEPy; 4 KREEP fragments from 2-4 mm soil 12033,2; 4 anorthositic fragments from 1-3 mm soil 10085,104; 1 sample of 'Luny' rock-felsite-KREEP breccia 12013 10085,31 LR-1). Most Apollo 12 samples were found to have an Imbrium meteoritic component; others, typified by the Luny breccia, apparently contain a new meteoritic component of low Re content. Components of higher Ir/Au ratio (3L, 5L and 7) were found in Apollo 11 anorthositic samples; the fact that their enrichment in meteoritic siderophiles parallels that of Fe, Mg, REE and other KREEP elements is consistent with progressive contamination of an anorthositic crust. The Luny rock was tentatively classified Group 2, supporting the assignment of this group to Serenitatis.|

T.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||877|A systematic interdisciplinary study of the Apollo 17 station 7 boulder, from the foot of the North Massif at Taurus-Littrow, is described. The astronauts observed four lithologies: a large white clast represented by 77215, cut by dark dikelets (77075) and enclosed in blue-gray breccia (77115); the assemblage of these three rock types is in turn surrounded by green-gray breccia (77135). The history of the station 7 boulder, as construed from the results of the consortium study, is presented.|

D., Keil, K.|Mare Crisium: The view from Luna 24|||357|Available major-element compositions of very low-Ti (VLT) mare basalt lithic fragments and glasses are examined. Many of the lithic fragments contain relic mineral and sometimes lithic clasts, which suggests that many samples of VLT mare basalt glasses and lithic fragments were formed by impact melting. Therefore, some may have compositions that represent mixtures of VLT mare basalts and other types of rocks, not authentic igneous rock compositions. In spite of this problem, a number of possible parent magma compositions are identified. These hypothetical magmas vary in CaO/Al2O3(0.9-1.1), FeO (17 to 24 wt. %), Fe/(Fe + Mg) (0.34-0.46), and K2O (0-0.2 wt. %). Each may have differentiated to produce a wide variety of derivative magmas. Calculations involving olivine fractionation from the proposed parent magmas indicate the Luna 24 ferrobasalts might have formed from a magma whose composition is similar to that of a group of high-MgO (about 13-14 wt. %) Apollo 17 VLT mare basalt glasses.|

The crater populations observed have identical characteristics to those obtained from previous missions. Special emphasis was placed on assessing the influence of target properties on the observable crater populations. Although these properties cannot be quantitatively evaluated at present, the empirical results indicate that crater populations on glass, breccia, and crystalline rock surfaces may differ fundamentally. As a consequence, lunar surface exposure ages of individual rocks based on micrometeoroid craters may be subject to criticism.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0019-1035(74)90079-7
