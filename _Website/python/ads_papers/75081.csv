M.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|12||529|The concentration of surface (low temperature site) and interior (high temperature site) Cd, Zn, and Pb in 13 Apollo 16 highland fines samples, pristine rock 65325, and mare fines sample 75081 were analyzed directly from the thermal release profiles obtained by flameless atomic absorption technique (FLAA). Cd and Zn in pristine ferroan anothosite 65325, anorthositic grains of the most mature fines 65701, and basaltic rock fragments of mare fines 75081 were almost all surface Cd and Zn indicating that most volatiles were deposited on the surfaces of vugs, vesicles and microcracks during the initial cooling process. A considerable amount of interior Cd and Zn was observed in agglutinates. This result suggests that high temperature site interior volatiles originate from entrapment during the lunar maturation processes. Interior Cd found in the most mature fines sample 65701 was only about 15% of the total Cd in the sample. Interior Pb present in Apollo 16 fines samples went up to 60%. From our Cd studies we can assume that this interior Pb in highland fines samples is largely due to the radiogenic decay which occurred after the redistribution of the volatiles took place. We obtained an average age of 4.0 b.y. for the parent rocks of Apollo 16 highland regolith from our interior Pb analyses.|

J., Simon, S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2065|Instrumental neutron activation analysis was used to examine 34 major, minor and trace elements in 48 bulk soils and size fractions (90-1000 microns, 20-90 microns and less than 20 microns) of the Apollo 17 deep drill core sections 70009-70006 (upper 130 cm). Modal data were also obtained for the less than 20 micron size fraction. Preliminary results indicate that (1) the chemistry of the greater than 90 micron and 20-90 micron coarse fractions is identical but quite different from the less than 20 micron fine fraction; (2) the upper 50 cm of the drill core is highly enriched in mare material; (3) the dominant source of highland material is KREEPy instead of anorthositic; and (4) indigenous volatiles such as Zn are quite high in all size fractions.|

V.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2287|Surface exposure (or, equivalently, maturity) indices of lunar soils are a measure of residence time of soil in the upper one millimeter of the regolith. Several concepts concerning the use of and terminology associated with maturity indices are discussed. For reasons which include its generally-applicable nature and large data base, the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) surface exposure (maturity) index I<SUB>s/FeO</SUB> (the ratio of the value of the intensity in arbitrary units of the FMR resonance at g equal to about 2.1 to the FeO concentration) is particularly suitable and useful. A compilation of values of I<SUB>s/FeO</SUB> for 164 Apollo surface and trench soils and six Luna 24 core soils is given.|

1974E&PSL..23..206L|1974|Chemical composition of boulder-2 rocks and soils, Apollo 17, station 2|Laul, J. C., Schmitt, R. A.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|23|2|206|Forty-two elements have been measured via INAA and RNAA in six samples of five rocks from a 2-m tan-gray boulder-2 breccia (South Massif), in four soils from the South Massif and a valley soil. The chemical composition of the four metaclastic rocks corresponds to "high alumina" (52% Pl) and medium-K KREEP-type rocks. Rock 72335,2 is a medium K anorthositic gabbro (74% Pl). Both the North and South Massifs appear to be medium-K KREEP in composition and thus may represent a single stratigraphic unit of the Serenitatis basin event. Four soils of the South Massif are identical in composition to medium-K KREEP; they are more feldspathic and lower in LIL trace elements relative to the boulder-2 rocks. The valley soil 75081 is like the 10084 soil; both soils are high in TiO <SUB>2</SUB> and both are deficient in KREEP. Th and U give a sharp distinction between the valley and highland soils. The South Massif rocks and soils contain siderophiles at the 2-4% Cl level and show an ancient meteoritic pattern. Five samples of the four rocks have Ir/Au ratios of ± 0.02 which we assign to the Serenitatis basis planetesimal. The valley soil at Camelot Crater has low siderophiles (1% Cl). Our systematic study of four shadowed and exposed soils does not support the labile hypothesis for Cd, In, Tl and Zn. We observe no volatile (atmophile) movement from the South Massif highland soils to the valley soil 75081. The volatiles Cs and Tl appear to have been fractionated in the boulder-2 rocks during cratering, brecciation and metamorphic processes. The uniform ratio of FeO/MnO = 80-85, observed for all previous mare and highland sites, also holds for the Taurus-Littrow site.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(74)90195-2

The ilmenites, particularly in 74241, contain up to 7.8 wt.% MgO and display higher bireflectance than low-Mg ilmenites. They commonly contain exsolution-like chromite and rutile and occasionally are in association with native Fe in an assemblage probably resulting from reduction. The chromian ulvöspinels are similar to Apollo 11 spinels in that they contain near-equal amounts of chromite and ulvöspinel molecules. No primary chromites were observed. Most native Fe has No and Co contents of &lt; 1 wt.%; some in 74220 contained 5-6% Ni and &lt; 1% Co in association with schreibersite. All armalcolites examined are optically and chemically similar and the common mantling by Mg ilmenite leads us to conclude they are the ortho-armalcolite of S.E. Haggerty. We have collected optical (reflectivety and bireflectance) and microhardness data for the ilmenites, ulvöspinels and armalcolites. These are the first microhardness determinations for the last two minerals.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(73)90219-7
