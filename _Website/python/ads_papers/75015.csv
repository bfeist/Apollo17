The cooling rate deduced from a computer simulation on the augite exsolution suggests that this pyroxene may have been produced several km below the lunar crust surface; pyroxene compositions and textures in light-matrix breccia 60016.97 show that it is a lunar analogue of the eucritic polymict breccia. It is concluded that this type of breccia may supply information on the pristine nonmare pyroxene components within the original lunar crust.|

A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||465|The short-range unmixing model, which explains compositional variations produced during crystallization of a single undifferentiated basalt flow, has been applied to the variations found within each of the suites of mare basalts. Based on this modelling, the following suites of mare basalts could represent random samples from single, undifferentiated lava flows: Apollo 11 A (high K), Apollo 15 olivine, Apollo 17 A-U, Apollo 17 B, Apollo 17 C. The short range unmixing model fails to account for variations within the Apollo 12 olivine-pigeonite group and Apollo 12 ilmenite group, which are well explained by fractional crystallization. The fact that the compositional variations within a suite of samples of unknown affinity can be explained in terms of short-range unmixing of a single lava does not mean that they are necessarily related in that way. It does, however, mean that independent evidence (stratigraphic, petrographic, isotropic, or age) is required to support arguments for the variations being caused by fraction crystallization or different magma batches.|
