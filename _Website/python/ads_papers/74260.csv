Since these droplets have S + Zn surface coatings with characteristics that fit a volcanic origin, the presence of similar coatings on dispersed droplets are taken as a good criterion of their volcanic origin. This criterion in concert with other criteria (homogeneity, absence of shocked relicts) that distinguish between volcanic and impact origins, has led to identification of a new ultramafic endogenous liquid that was erupted at Apollo 15. The brown glass droplets representing this liquid have a higher TiO2 content and are more mafic than any of the Apollo 15 basalts.|

S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||3095|Ropy glasses are a major soil component in the Apollo 17 gray soils 74240 and 74260. These particles form a distinct morphological type characterized by a wide range of dynamic shapes with a diagnostic sorted and welded fine-grained debris coating. Apollo 17 ropy glasses show abundant evidence for shock. Shocked lithic and mineral inclusions, lack of any igneous textures, and lechatelierite, all indicate an impact origin. A striking similarity is observed between the lunar ropy glasses and the glass impact bombs (Flaedle) of the Ries Crater in Germany. A highland basaltic composition was observed for the Apollo 17 ropy glasses in contrast to the KREEP composition of ropy glasses from the Apollo 12 and Apollo 14 landing sites. Other workers have presented convincing evidence that ejecta from Tycho reached the Taurus-Littrow Valley, and these ropy glasses may represent Tycho ejecta. However, the close stratigraphic association of the ropy glasses with the greater than 3.5 b.y. old orange glass suggests the ropy glasses may be too old to be Tycho ejecta, which should be only about 100 m.y. old. If this is the case, the ropy glasses represent impact glasses from a very old impact in an unknown highlands source area.|
