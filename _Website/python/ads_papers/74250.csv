G., Veverka, J., Noland, M., Hilgeman, T.|Icarus|19|3|358|Photometric and polarimetric laboratory measurements were made as a function of phase angle in the U(0.36 μm), G(0.54 μm) and R(0.67 μm) bands for 0°, 30° and 60° incident illumination on four particle size ranges of Bruderheim, an L6 olivine-hypersthene chondritic meteorite. The four particle size ranges were: 0.25-4.76 mm, 0.25-4.76 mm coated with <74 μm powder, 74-250 μm, and <37 μm. In addition, normal reflectance measurements were made in the spectral range from 0.31 to 1.1 μm. Comparison with astronomical data reveals that none of the asteroids in the main belt for which adequate observations exist can be matched with Bruderheim, which is representative of the most common meteoritic material encountered by the Earth. However, it appears from the polarization and photometry data that the surface of the Apollo asteroid Icarus is consistent with an ordinary chondrite composition. This suggests the possibility that this material, although common in Earth-crossing orbits, is rare as a surface constituent in the main asteroid belt.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0019-1035(73)90114-0
