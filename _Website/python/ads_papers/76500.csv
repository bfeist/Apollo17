S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1385|Lunar core 76001 is a 4 cm-diameter drive tube, collected 12 meters downhill and to the side of the Station 6 boulder complex at the foot of the North Massif. The core contains dark, fine-grained, FMR-mature soil with scattered, very-large fragments of crystallized-matrix breccia. Except for the large rock fragments, the soil column is unusually fine and homogeneous for a lunar core. Petrographically, soil in 76001 is different from dark fine soils in 14211/10, 60010 and 70009. Although there is evidence that maturation was an important process in formation of dark soils in 14211/10, 60010 and 70009, clast populations and particle interrelationships in 76001 show no evidence of maturation, but they show no clear-cut indication of mixing, either. These characteristics are best explained if the core had been deposited by slow continuous accumulation, rather than by gardening, landslide or impact ejection. Because the coring site is at the foot of a mountain, downslope creep is the most favored mechanism for the slow accumulation of soil. A perturbation in the mode of accumulation occurred at 22 m.y. ago, when the Station 6 boulders were emplaced; soils at the coring site, in the downhill wake of the boulders, became finer and laced with boulder fragments.|
