H.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2018||P13B-05|Paleomagnetic studies of lunar samples collected during the Apollo missions suggest the Moon generated a core dynamo for at least 2 billion years. The early lunar dynamo (4.25 - 3.56 Ga) was intense, recording paleointensities of 20 - 110 µT. The lunar dynamo field subsequently declined to 5 ± 2 µT at 2.5 - 1 Ga. The strength and longevity of this dynamo field is challenging to explain via a single mechanism. Thermal convection could not have driven a dynamo for such a sustained period of time, whilst thermochemical convection during core solidification is unlikely to have started so early. <P />There is also debate surrounding the dipolar nature of the lunar magnetic field. A recent study of lunar crustal magnetization inferred paleopoles oriented with both the rotation axis and the equator. Providing a robust constraint on the direction of the lunar magnetic field over time is essential for establishing: (a) the mechanism by which the lunar dynamo was driven, (b) whether the magnetic field underwent reversals, and (c) whether the Moon experienced true polar wander. <P />Here we present new results for the paleoinclination and paleointensity of the lunar magnetic field recorded 3.8 Ga by Apollo samples 75055 and 75075, respectively. These samples were collected during the Apollo 17 mission at Camelot crater. They were sampled from boulders which are thought to represent an overturned flap formed during impact cratering or else nearly in-place subfloor basalts exposed by recent mass-wasting. <P />At the latitude of the Camelot crater (20.19 °N), a dipolar field aligned along the rotation axis would have had a paleoinclination of 36.3°. Using alternating field demagnetization techniques on a 2G SQUID magnetometer in the MIT Paleomagnetism Laboratory, sample 75055 returned a paleoinclination of 38.6 ± 13.5° suggesting the Moon had a dipolar, dynamo-generated field that was stable for extended periods of time. <P />Preliminary results from sample 75075, which was analysed using the same methods, suggest this sample experienced a very weak magnetic field (0 ± 2 μT), despite acquiring remanence during the high intensity epoch. This supports a recent theoretical proposal that the early lunar dynamo may have been intermittently weak during the period before 3.56 Ga due to a lack of sufficient energy for continuously driving a high intensity magnetic field.|

Apart from being of interest in its own right, such a comparison provides a test of Delano and Ringwood's (1979) contention that 'abundances of Ge, Au, and other siderophile elements in pristine highland rocks are not consistent with magmatic differentiation'. The other topics reexamined in this paper are the correlation of siderophiles and volatiles in pristine rocks with Rb and Cs (likewise questioned by Delano and Ringwood), the relationship of 'non-mare' basalts (14053, 60639) to their mare counterparts, and the abundance of some incompatible elements in the lunar bulk.|

J.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1269|Data for 35 major, minor, and trace elements in 40 bulk and size fractions of core 70005-70003 (140-250 cm) are presented. The core is heterogeneous with depth. Moreover, the 1000 to 90 micron coarse fractions are nearly identical but quite different from the less than 20 micron fine fraction. The bulk soil chemistry is governed by the coarse fractions, because of their greater weight proportion in the sample. The 1000-90 micron fraction contains more ilmenite basalt and less orange glass components than the 90-20 micron fraction. The less than 20 micron fraction is consistently enriched in highland material at all depths in the drill core.|

In a concordia diagram, the samples suggest a postcrystallization disturbance of the U-Pb systems of the rock. There is no compelling reason, from U-Pb data, to believe that the moon is younger than 4.55 AE.|
1978LPSC....9..465L|1978|Causes of compositional variations within mare basalt suites.|Lindstrom, M. M., Haskin, L. A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||465|The short-range unmixing model, which explains compositional variations produced during crystallization of a single undifferentiated basalt flow, has been applied to the variations found within each of the suites of mare basalts. Based on this modelling, the following suites of mare basalts could represent random samples from single, undifferentiated lava flows: Apollo 11 A (high K), Apollo 15 olivine, Apollo 17 A-U, Apollo 17 B, Apollo 17 C. The short range unmixing model fails to account for variations within the Apollo 12 olivine-pigeonite group and Apollo 12 ilmenite group, which are well explained by fractional crystallization. The fact that the compositional variations within a suite of samples of unknown affinity can be explained in terms of short-range unmixing of a single lava does not mean that they are necessarily related in that way. It does, however, mean that independent evidence (stratigraphic, petrographic, isotropic, or age) is required to support arguments for the variations being caused by fraction crystallization or different magma batches.|
1978LPSC....9...59J|1978|Trace element evidence for a laterally inhomogeneous moon.|Jovanovic, S., Reed, G. W., Jr.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||59|A number of trace element interrelationships support the concept of a laterally inhomogeneous moon based originally on Clr/P2O5 ratios. The correspondence between Clr/P2O3 and Rb/Sr ratios in basalts are of special interest since the isotropic evolution of the latter pair of elements relates to the earliest history of the moon. This implies the times when the Clr/P2O5 relationships were established. The early magma ocean is conjectured to have been made up of non-intermixing seas resulting either from large convection cells or large body accretion. These mutually exclusive regions could be lunar geological provinces. It is proposed that the diversity of basalts from the Apollo 17 site is related to the lateral inhomogeneity of the moon. Ca/Na ratios in basalts show a trend which parallels that of Ru/Os and in a corresponding fashion may serve as a depth indicator.|

A relatively recent disturbance to the U-Pb system during meteorite impact or burial in hot ejecta is suggested by the findings. According to three-stage U-Pb evolution model calculations, the source cumulates of the Luna 24 basalt evolved in a U-238/Pb-204 environment much lower than that of the Apollo mare basalts. A laterally heterogeneous lunar magma ocean, U-Pb fractionation during cumulate formation, and/or lack of KREEP addition to the Luna 24 basalt are also reflected in the calculations.|

H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1473|Uranium, thorium, and isotopic lead data for components of basalt 70017 are reported, and it is found that the whole rock, pyroxene, and ilmenite points in a concordia diagram plot along a chord intersecting the curve at 3.7 and 4.33 eons. The plagioclase data do not seem to lie on this line. The data for 70017 appear to plot along a distinctly different chord in a concordia diagram than do the data for 75055 and 75035, two other Apollo 17 mare basalts. The lead data are in accord with Sm-Nd results. A 3.7 eon crystallization age for 70017 would be consistent with the same kind of parentless lead that is indicated by previous studies of soils and soil breccias from stations at Taurus-Littrow. The Th/U ratio in ilmenite is 2.2, and the concentrations of these two elements are approximately twice those in pyroxene.|

The gas retention age of 75055 raises the lower limit for the time of formation of all lunar basins. Of the breccia represents metamorphosed Serenitatis basin ejecta, then the formation of at least 28 lunar basins occurred between 3.82 × 10 <SUP>9</SUP> and 4.05 × 10 <SUP>9</SUP> yr ago. The formation of these basins during a timespan of only about 0.2 × 10 <SUP>9</SUP> yr is consistent with the very rapid decrease of the flux of crater-forming projectiles that collided with the Moon about 4.0 × 10 <SUP>9</SUP> yr ago. According to Hartman and Wood this could be due to a catastrophic event in the Earth-Moon system at that time.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(73)90149-0
