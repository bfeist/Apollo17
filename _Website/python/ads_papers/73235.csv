2014GeCoA.131...62S|2014|Characterization of the dominant impactor signature for Apollo 17 impact melt rocks|Sharp, Miriam, Gerasimenko, Iva, Loudin, Lorne C., Liu, Jingao, James, Odette B., Puchtel, Igor S., Walker, Richard J.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|131||62|Concentrations of the highly siderophile elements (HSE) Re, Os, Ir, Ru, Pt, and Pd and <SUP>187</SUP>Os/<SUP>188</SUP>Os isotopic compositions are reported for seven Apollo 17 impact melt rocks. These data are used to examine the dominant chemical signature of the impactor that formed the melts. Six of the samples (72355, 72435, 72535, 76035, 76055, and 76135) have poikilitic textures; one sample (73235) has an aphanitic texture. Data for the samples define linear correlations when Ir is plotted versus other HSE concentrations, with y-intercepts indistinguishable from zero for most HSE in most rocks. Scatter about some of the trends, and occasional trends with positive y-intercepts, indicate either mixing of additional components that are heterogeneously distributed within several rocks, or modest fractionation of some HSE by volatilization, crystal fractionation, or other processes, during formation and evolution of the melt sheet. There is no statistical difference between the aphanitic and poikilitic samples in terms of HSE ratios after visible granulitic clasts were removed from aphanite 73235. Hence, earlier speculations that the two types of impact melt rocks at this site may have been generated by different impactors are not supported by our data. <P />Most Apollo 17 samples examined here and in prior studies are characterized by very similar HSE signatures, consistent with a common impactor. These samples are characterized by elevated Ru/Ir, Pd/Ir, and Re/Os, relative to most chondrites. Collectively, the data indicate that the impactor was characterized by the following HSE ratios (2σ): Re/Ir 0.093 ± 0.020, Os/Ir 1.03 ± 0.28, Ru/Ir 1.87 ± 0.30, Pt/Ir 2.36 ± 0.31, Pd/Ir 1.85 ± 0.41, and present-day <SUP>187</SUP>Os/<SUP>188</SUP>Os of 0.1322 ± 0.0013. The results most likely mean that the impactor was a body with a bulk composition that was just outside the range of meteoritic compositions currently sampled on Earth.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2014.01.014

These zircon grains preserve deformation microstructures that show a wide range in style and complexity. Planar deformation features (PDFs) are documented in lunar zircon for the first time, and occur along {001}, {110}, and {112}, typically with 0.1-25 μm spacing. The widest PDFs associated with {112} contain microtwin lamellae with 65°/&lt;110&gt; misorientation relationships. Deformation bands parallel to {100} planes and irregular low-angle (&lt;10°) boundaries most commonly have &lt;001&gt; misorientation axes. This geometry is consistent with a dislocation glide system with &lt;100&gt;{010} during dislocation creep. Nonplanar fractures, recrystallized domains with sharp, irregular interfaces, and localized annealing textures along fractures are also observed. No occurrences of reidite were detected. Shock-deformation microstructures in zircon are explained in terms of elastic anisotropy of zircon. PDFs form along a limited number of specific {hkl} planes that are perpendicular to directions of high Young's modulus, suggesting that PDFs are likely to be planes of longitudinal lattice damage. Twinned {112} PDFs also contain directions of high shear modulus. A conceptual model is proposed for the development of different deformation microstructures during an impact event. This “shock-deformation mechanism map” is used to explain the relative timing, conditions, and complexity relationships between impact-related deformation microstructures in zircon.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1945-5100.2011.01316.x

2011GeCoA..75.2213G|2011|Complex magmatic and impact history prior to 4.1 Ga recorded in zircon from Apollo 17 South Massif aphanitic breccia 73235|Grange, M. L., Nemchin, A. A., Timms, N., Pidgeon, R. T., Meyer, C.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|75|8|2213|Sample 73235 is one of several aphanitic impact melt breccias collected by the Apollo 17 mission at stations 2 and 3 on the slopes of the South Massif. This study presents a detailed investigation of internal structures and U-Pb ages of large zircon grains from this breccia sample. New data combined with the results of previous studies of zircon grains from the same location indicate that most zircon clasts in breccias from stations 2 and 3 formed during multiple magmatic events between 4.37 and 4.31 Ga, although the oldest zircon crystallized at about 4.42 Ga and the youngest at 4.21 Ga. In addition, zircons from the aphanitic breccias record several impact events prior to the ∼3.9 Ga Late Heavy Bombardment. The results indicate that the zircons probably crystallized at different locations within the Procellarum KREEEP Terrane and were later excavated and modified by several impacts and delivered to the same locality within separate ejecta blankets. This locality became a source of material that formed the aphanitic impact melt breccias of the South Massif during a ∼3.9 Ga impact. However, the zircons, showing old impact features, are not modified by this ∼3.9 Ga impact event suggesting that (i) this common source area was located at the periphery of excavation cavity, and (ii) the &gt; 3.9 Ga ages recorded by the zircon grains could date large (basin-forming) events as significant as major later (∼3.9 Ga) collisions such as Imbrium and Serenitatis.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2011.01.036

J.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|88||887|Experimentally determined pyroxene phase relations at 800°-1200°C are combined with calculated phase equilibria for the Di-En and Hd-Fs joins to produce a graphical two-pyroxene thermometer that should be applicable to a wide variety of rocks from the earth, moon, and meteorites. The thermometer can be used directly with natural pyroxenes that have low contents of Al and other minor components. Samples with higher contents of ‘others’ components require special projection onto the Ca-Mg-Fe pyroxene quadrilateral; Wo, En, and Fs as normally calculated will not yield correct temperatures! The special projection is necessary to approximate the activities of those components in natural pyroxenes. The effects of pressure are nonnegligible but can be corrected for. Use of the thermometer for slowly-cooled rocks may pose special problems if the pyroxenes have undergone granule exsolution (coalescence of exsolved material to form separate grains). For example, published analyses of Mg-rich augites from the Skaergaard intrusion give temperatures that are 50°-100°C below expected magmatic values. Textural and experimental evidence confirms that these augites have undergone granule exsolution. The primary pyroxene compositions must be reconstructed from textural evidence before correct igneous or peak-metamorphic temperatures can be obtained from this or any two-pyroxene thermometer. Of the numerous two-pyroxene thermometers proposed in the literature, those of Ross and Huebner [1975] and of Kretz [1982] Ca-reaction] yield temperatures most similar to our own, although the former tends to give temperatures about 50°C lower for some igneous pyroxenes. Other thermometers generally overestimate temperatures for metamorphic rocks (hornblende granulite facies) by 50°-100°C.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB088iS02p0A887

1980LPSC...11..481P|1980|The meteoritic contamination of terrestrial and lunar impact melts and the problem of indigenous siderophiles in the lunar highland.|Palme, H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||481|It is noted that similarities in chemistry and texture between terrestrial and lunar impact melts can be extended to meteoritic elements. The absolute amount of the meteoritic contamination, as well as the observed variations in concentrations of meteoritic elements in the Apollo 17 melt sheet, is comparable to what is observed in some large terrestrial melt sheets. In favorable cases, concentrations of siderophile meteoritic elements in the basement (indigenous component) can be found on the basis of correlations of two meteoritic elements in impact melt samples. Indigenous Ni and Co concentrations found in this way for the Apollo 17 melt are, respectively, 40 + or - 15 ppm Ni and 21.6 + or - 3.5 ppm Co. It is noted that these values are consistent with a chondritic Ni/Co ratio of the projectile.|
1978LPSC....9...83W|1978|Primary matter in the lunar highlands: The case of the siderophile elements.|Waenke, H., Dreibus, G., Palme, H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||83|Most highland breccias of the Apollo 16 mission contain considerable amounts of siderophiles. The Ni/Co ratio of about 17 in these breccias is close to the Cl value of 21.6 and hence a meteoritic origin of these siderophiles is generally assumed. However, the Ni/Co ratio of the earth's mantle of about 18 would give an even closer match. Any reduction process on such terrestrial material would yield a metal almost indistinguishable from meteoritic metal on the basis of the Ni/Co ratio alone. It is argued that the distribution of siderophiles in highland samples is consistent with evidence in favor of the hypothesis that the moon formed from material of the earth's mantle.|

W.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||689|Sm-Nd whole rock measurements on a variety of KREEP-rich samples from different landing sites are reported. Despite a variation of Nd and Sm concentrations of almost a factor of 3, the Sm-Nd ratios, as well as the Nd-143/Nd-144 values, show an extremely close grouping. No systematic differences between samples from different landing sites are resolved. These results are taken to be indicative of a moon-wide process having been responsible for the generation of the KREEP source reservoir, 4.36 plus or minus 0.06 AE ago, as estimated from model age calculation.|

G.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1821|It is noted that Apollo 17 grey breccias, as represented by 73235 and 73215, are texturally and compositionally similar mixtures of two clast-rich lithologies: coherent, very fine grained, dark matrix breccia and more porous, light matrix breccia. It is proposed that the breccias under consideration consist of primary Serenitatis ejecta, texturally modified by secondary impact mixing. When applied to a model of the Serenitatis impact event, unshocked clasts are interpreted as samples of the upper 25 km of the lunar crust with the coarser grained, shocked, plagioclase-rich clasts as material excavated from the lower crust.|

H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1593|The reported study is a continuation of an investigation begun by Alexander and Kahl (1974), with primary emphasis on (Ar-40)-(Ar-39) dating of lunar breccias. A primary objective of the study was related to the resolution of small plateau-age differences between Apollo 16 and 17 samples which have been irradiated in the same irradiation. This objective was not realized because (1) neither of the considered Apollo 16 samples has a well-defined plateau, and (2) the release patterns of the two Apollo 17 samples with plateaux (73235 and 77017) are sufficiently complex to suggest caution in interpretation of fine-scale differences among apparent ages. The plateau age of 73235 agrees well with plateau ages measured for a nearby boulder at the South Massif. The plateau age of 77017, on the other hand, agrees well with plateau ages measured in an nearby boulder at the base of the North Massif. These rock and boulder ages are tightly clustered about 3.99 b.y., and this clustering suggests that the North and South Massifs were made in the same basin-forming event, presumably Serenitatis.|
