Whole-rock and mineral separates for one of the least-evolved Type B1 basalts, 70139, yield Sm-Nd and Rb-Sr isochron ages of 3.71 ± 0.12 Ga and 3.65 ± 0.13 Ga, respectively. A more-evolved, Type A basalt, 71539, exhibits a slightly older Sm-Nd isochron age of 3.75 ± 0.07 Ga and a Rb-Sr isochron age of 3.67 ±0.10 Ga. Although these two ages are non-resolvable by themselves, compilation of all available geochronological data allows resolution of Type A and B1/B2 ages at high levels of confidence (>99%). The most reliably dated samples, classified according to their geochemical type, yield weighted average ages of 3.75 ± 0.02 Ga for Type A ( N = 4) and 3.69 ± 0.02 Ga for Type B1/B2 ( N = 3) basalts. Insufficient geochronological data are available to place the rare, Type C basalts within this stratigraphy. We propose that age differences correlate with geochemical magma type, and that early magmatism was dominated by eruption of Type A basalts while later activity was dominated by effusion of Type B1 and B2 basalts. Whole-rock isotopic data yield distinct differences in initial Sr and Nd isotopic compositions between Types A, B1, B2, and C basalts. Types A, B1, and C exhibit restricted intra-group compositional variations and lie along well-defined whole-rock isochrons. These data are consistent with petrogenetic models involving closed-system fractionation of observed microphenocrysts from chemically and isotopically distinct parental magmas. In contrast, a wide range of Type B2 initial isotopic compositions indicates mixing of several distinct components during magma evolution. The Sm-Nd whole-rock isochron age for Type A, Bl, and C basalts of 3.79 ± 0.15 Ga is within error of Apollo 17 eruptive activity. However, the very well-defined Sr whole-rock isochron age of 4.02 ± 0.05 Ga is 270 to 330 Ma older than eruptive ages. Isotopic and petrological arguments indicate that extensive Rb/Sr fractionation did not occur at the time of melt generation. Therefore, the 4.0 Ga Sr whole-rock isochron age records a significant event at which time geochemical heterogeneities were established within the originally homogeneous basalt source regions. Types A and C sources were enriched in Rb/Sr, with little or no concurrent modification of <SUP>87</SUP>Sr /<SUP>86</SUP>Sr , Sm/Nd, or <SUP>143</SUP>Nd /<SUP>144</SUP>Nd . Infiltration of similar-aged KREEP magmas into mantle cumulate sources cannot explain both Sr and Nd isotopic data. Instead, we suggest a metasomatic origin in which Rb, transported as a chloride complex in halogen-rich fluids, was preferentially mobilized relative to Sr and the REEs.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(91)90040-C
1972PrAeS..13...81T|1972|Some design aspects of space shuttle orbiters|Townend, L. H.|Progress in Aerospace Sciences|13||81|In this paper two observations are made in the context of lifting re-entry. One is that, during re-entry itself, much higher lift coefficients (both at maximum lift and per unit lift-drag ratio) can be provided by variants of the caret wing than by flat-bottomed delta wings or other vehicles that give high spillage. The second is that, after re-entry and whether vehicles are flat-bottomed or recessed, they can glide hypersonically at much higher lift-drag ratios than are commonly assumed. These features are additional to that of aerodynamic simplicity, on which the caret wing was originally advocated by Nonweiler. Both would be desirable for Space Shuttle orbiters: the first because, for a given wing loading, it will moderate re-entry heating rates and/or increase re-entry range: and the second, because it improves cross-range during the subsequent glide by many hundreds of miles, and thereby the operational flexibility which is a primary requirement for Space Shuttle systems. This paper replaces A.R.C. 31973 and A.R.C. 32104, and is a modified version of R.A.E.
