			<div class="afjpao"><span class="afjwho">PAO</span> Ail indications are we are GO for launch as we approach the 2 minute 30 second mark. Pressurization of the various propellant tanks now aboard the space vehicle is starting. At two, our second stage liquid oxygen tanks now pressurized. These propellant tanks are pressurized with helium to insure that during the flight the fuel flows properly down through the engine. It's quiet here in the firing room now as the men are monitoring their consoles, looking at the temperatures, checking pressures and a variety of parameters to ensure everything is in a GO condition. Pressurization continuing on the fuel tanks at this time we'll go to the critical power transfer at the T-50 second mark in the count down. At that time we'll transfer external power source to the flight battery aboard the space vehicle. The final action by the crew aboard the spacecraft America will be a final guidance alignment conducted by the Spacecraft Commander Gene Cernan. The flight of Apollo 17 will be able to be seen depending on weather conditions, some 500 miles away as it goes into Earth orbit. Pressurization continuing, liquid hydrogen tanks now aboard the second stage have now been pressurized, all propellants aboard the second stage now pressurized. A cover aboard the que ball. This is the que ball system on top of the launch escape system will be pulled off just shortly before launch. First stage propellant tanks have been pressurized.</div>

We'll be looking for the engine start sequence at the 8.9 second mark in the countdown. Engines will build up to a thrust of 7.6 million pounds.</div>

The gimbals were moving and the rocket, you could feel it. You're lying there on your back, you could feel the engines moving down a football field below you or more, as it prepared for ignition.</div>

			<div class="afjed">[  At T-3 minutes and 7 seconds, the automatic sequencer took over. This sequencer, the oldest and most reliable piece of automation on LC-39, chose this moment in the launching of the last Apollo to cause trouble. At T-30 seconds it went into an automatic cutoff indicating that one of the essential operations leading to the launch of the space vehicle had not been properly completed. Besides halting the countdown, the cutoff started a series of "safing" procedures which included the return of swing arm 9 to a standby position. <i><a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/ch23-7.html" class="external text" title="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/ch23-7.html" rel="nofollow">Moonport</a></i> ]</div>

It has to be noisy, has lots of vibration, and smoothed out somewhat after max-q, but still was a rumbling bird.
