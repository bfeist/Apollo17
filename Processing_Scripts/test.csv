END OF TAPE||||||||||||Tape 3/1|||||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION CARNARVON (REV l)|00|00|52|20|LMP|Hello, Houston; how do you read 17?|||||CC|17, read you loud and clear.|||||LMP|Hey, we're going real well up here, Bob. Have no significant anomalies as yet; and we've just about completed our part of the insertion checklist. Gene has his SCS check yet, and Ron's got some P52 numbers for you. And the only thing I've seen so far is a - some spurious MASTER ALARM without caution and warning that seem to be associated with moving switches on panel 2.|||||CC|Okay. Can you get a sudden - what switches anywhere - any ... any switches on?|||||LMP|So far, it's been fairly random. Some that I remember is the SECONDARY COOLANT LOOP EVAP switch, the LAMP TEST switch, - see - I think I got one with the TEMP IN AUTO switch. Gene got one doing something. I can't remember exactly what it was.|||||CC|Okay - -|||||LMP|Probably random.|||||CC|- - we copy. Jack, we're standing by for that P52 data. We've only got about a 4-minute - a 5-minute pass here. We'll take the 52 data, and I got a few updates for you.|||||LMP|Okay.|||||CMP|Okay; 52 data is coming. NOUN 71 is 24 and 30; NOUN 05 is .01; NOUN 93s are plus .080, plus .029, plus .018; and we torqued at 35:25.|||||CC|Okay. We copy that. Okay, while we're filling in some here, you might want to know this, Jack. Your sunset and sunrise times in the Launch Checklist|||||||Tape 3/2|||||||||||are all off by 8 - approximately 8 minutes and 30 seconds. That every - sunset and sunrise will occur about 8 minutes and 30 seconds sooner than in the - in the Launch Checklist. That's an approximate number.|||||LMP|Okay, we got you.|||||CC|Okay. And on page 2-17 of the Launch Checklist, you're going to want to delete all reference to Honeysuckle AOS and LOS and delete all reference to Canaries AOS and LOS.|||||LMP|Wilco.|||||CC|And we want to add an Ascension pass; AOS at Ascension, 01 plus 54 plus 00, and Ascension LOS will be 02:00:16.|00|00|55|13|LMP|Okay, Bob; you're going to have to repeat that.|||||CC|Okay, stand by. Let me give you a page. On 2-17 - let's go Hawaii AOS first of all. On Hawaii AOS, on page 2-17. AOS - -|||||LMP|Go.|||||CC|- - is 01 plus 17 plus 24. Hawaii LOS, 01 plus 22 plus 49.|||||LMP|Roger. Now what about the Ascension?|||||CC|Okay, here - give you the Ascension again now. AOS, 01 plus 54 plus 00. Ascension LOS will be 02:00:16. Over.|||||LMP|Okay, I got those. Hawaii is 01 plus 17 plus 24, and LOS is 01 plus 22 plus 49. And Ascension is AOS, 01 plus 54:00; and LOS, 02 plus 00:16.|||||CC|Roger, Jack. Good copy. And booster's looking good down here and you're looking good.|||||LMP|Okay, and I'll do a better job of itemizing those switches. We were pressing pretty hard, and I'll -I’ll be able to go back and get most of them, I think. And we'11 keep an eye on it - on the MASTER ALARMS.||||||||||||Tape 3/3|||||CC|Roger, Jack. We understand. And I think we copied most of what you said there, and we're working on it.|||||CDR|Okay, Bob; other than that MASTER ALARM, all is well on America, and I understand the booster is looking good to you.|||||CC|That's affirmative.|||||LMP|And, Bob, let me add that not - we did get spurious MASTER ALARMs without switch movement, but many came with switch movements. We’ve had about seven.|||||CC|Okay; understand.|||||LMP|That was only after insertion.|||||CC|Seven times that your heart doesn't need, huh?|||||LMP|Oh, we were paying attention to a sunset that was the biggest - -|||||CDR|Sunrise.|||||IMP|- - or sunrise or something that we saw. It was the biggest rainbow I'd ever seen.|||||CC|Beautiful. We can't wait to hear what you had to say about that - the ignition on the S-II. It sounded pretty spectacular.|||||LMP|Bob, just let it be said that that was quite a booster ride. When we get a chance a little later - -|||||CC|Roger.|||||LMP|- - maybe we'll be able to tell you something.|||||CC|We’re about ready to lose comm here. You're looking great, guys, and we’ll pick you up in Hawaii here shortly.|||||CDR|Okay, we're looking at the deserts of Australia right now and, again, everything's good on board.|||||||Tape 3/4||||||||||CC|Roger. Pick you up at 01:17:24.|00|00|58|24|LMP|Roger. STDN (REV 1/2)|00|01|17|25|IMP|Hello, earthlings. We're back with you.|||||CC|Roger, Jack. Read you loud and clear; how us?|||||LMP|You're loud and clear. And no change systems-wise that I've seen.|||||CC|Roger, Jack. Any more MASTER ALARMs?|||||LMP|We had one when Ron's - looked like his neck ring hit panel 2. ...|||||CC|Okay. Sounds like we had something loose in panel 2, huh?|||||LMP|Yes. 1 don't know - It may be annoying, but so far it doesn't seem to be a problem.|||||CC|Roger. Just for your information, everything is looking outstanding and no problems. We're taking a good look at the data here at Hawaii, and we'll make a GO/NO GO decision about 60 seconds after acquisition at Goldstone. But there's nothing right now to lead us to believe that zero opportunity will be required.|||||LMP|Okay, Bob, understand that. We are prepared, however . Spacecraft, other than those MASTER ALARMs, is looking very good. We got the docking probe extended. The SCS reference attitude check is complete.|||||CC|Roger.|||||LMP|Hey, Bob, 1 just remembered smother switch that 1 think gave us a MASTER ALARM was HO QUANTITY INDICATOR.||||||||||||Tape 3/5|||||CC|Roger. Copy that, Jack. H^O QUANTITY INDICATOR.|||||CC|Roger - 17, we're going to lose you in about 30 seconds. But when you get over the stateside here, we're going to take - take the dump on the data, and we'll read it out real carefully so when you get in TLC we ought to be able to see where that MASTER ALARM glitch is coming in to.|||||LMP|Okay, Bob. And - yell at me if you want anything done on the comm with this change in AOS LOS stuff.|||||CC|Negative on that right now. We’ll see you at 01:28:59 through Goldstone.|||||CDR|Okay, 01:28:59, Bob. We'll be there.|00|01|22|48|CC|Roger, Gene.||||||GOLDSTONE (REV 2}|00|01|28|00|CC|17, Houston. We're back with you.|||||CDR|Okay, Bob. We're still same as before and ready when you are for TLI.|||||CC|Roger.|||||LMP|I can see the lights of southern California, Bob.|||||CC|Roger, Jack.|||||LMP|We're going to be going a little bit south of that area.|||||CC|Right. Your ground track looks like it's taking you right up over the mid part of Baja California.|||||LMP|Yes, sir; I'll believe that. I'll bet you I can see Ensenada right now.|||||CC|Roger.|||||CMP|Bob, I expect he'll probably be able to see the lights of Silver City, too.|||||||||||||||||LMP|Well, I'm sure going to be looking for them, I'll tell you.|00|01|29|59|CC|Jack, just for your information, you’ll probably -when you come up a little farther in this orbit here and get over Mexico, you should be able to see all that bad weather that was giving us so much worry and had Tindall and New Orleans and everything all messed up this morning when I went through there. They had a pretty bad line of weather along there.|||||LMP|I assume it wasn't too bad. I think you made it, didn't you?|||||CC|Oh, yeah, I made it, but I had to - you know, I had to work at it. But it's a - we were - I was worried about it getting down as towards MILA there after - you know if we had to scrub and go tomorrow night. Boy, I'm sure glad we got you off tonight.|||||LMP|Guess who else is.|||||CC|No, I can't - I wouldn't believe that.|||||CC|Parker can't make it back. He's got to come back on the ... So you might have to have Young on for a while after we do a TLI.|||||LMP|Hey, you just wouldn't believe, Bob, the light you can see in the west right now. It must be absolutely clear.|||||CC|Roger, Jack. Sounds spectacular. Jack, people in the room here want to know if you've been down your checklist yet?|00|01|31|24|LMP|Oh, we got that out of the way in about 5 minutes. Have we missed something?|||||CC|There's a different checklist here we're talking about.|||||LMP|(Laughter) If you're talking about the Flight Plan, yes.|||||CC|Roger.||||||||||||Tape 3/7|||||CMP|What a waste.|||||LMP|If I'm not mistaken, we must be just south of Arizona now. Is that right, Bob?|||||CC|That looks real good. Yes, you’re over Mexico there, and looks like you're - oh - maybe a hundred miles south of the border there.|||||LMP|Okay. I was pretty sure I was looking up in the Phoenix-Tucson complex there.|||||CC|Roger. Understand.|||||LMP|Clear night.|||||CC|Little better than ... Florida.|||||LMP|The west is always that way. I wish it was daylight so we could see Sonora and that country. That's spectacular, I'll bet you.|||||CC|Roger.|||||LMP|Man's field of stars on the Earth is competing with the heavens, Bob.|||||CDR|Bob, you're coming through with a large squeal right now in the background.|||||CC|Understand ...|||||LMP|Okay, I think we got the Gulf Coast showing up now by the band of lights, Bob.|||||CC|Roger.|||||CDR|Okay, Bob. Assume the booster is still looking good, and we'll be GO for a nominal TLI.|||||CC|That's affirmative.|||||LMP|Okay.|||||CDR|And you're still coming up with a loud squeal.|||||CC|Roger. ...|||||||Tape 3/8||||||||||CC|17, how do you read?|||||CDR|No, Bob, you still got the loud squeal.|||||LMP|Would you believe we're just south of Houston now, Bob?|00|01|35|17|CC|17, axe you receiving Houston now?|||||CDR|All right, Bob. You came up unreadable with the squeal that time.|||||CC|Am I still squealing? This is Houston.|||||CDR|That's affirm. You're very loud, almost unreadable with the squeal. Bob, why don't you give us the short count?|||||CC|Geno, don't change anything. We think it's a ground site situation here, and just stand by.|||||CDR|I believe it's in the VHF, Bob.|||||LMP|Okay, Bob. I'm not sure exactly where we are, but I’m looking out - to an awful lot of horiz - lights on the horizon out there at 12 o'clock, and an awful lot of lightning in the clouds out there.|||||CC|Roger. I - we show you just about over the middle of the Gulf. Looking ahead, you're probably seeing the very southern tip of Florida there.|||||CDR|It looks like almost the entire Florida peninsula has got lights - got lightning on it somewhere.|||||CC|Roger. How does my comm sound to you now, Gene?|||||CDR|Okay, give us a quick short count.|||||CC|Roger. Short count follows: 5 > ^, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; short count out.|||||CDR|Bob, you’re all right now.|||||CC|Okay.||||||||||||Tape 3/9|||||CDR|And can you give us a feel for what the final weather was at the Cape - at launch?|||||CC|Yes. Let me get that for you. The reason why we had that problem on the comm is we just handed over from Texas to MILA, and we're - and you're going through MILA now. And it's great. So we have a little problem with our Texas site.|||||CDR|Okay.|||||CC|The television coverage had you all the way through staging very well on - and the S-II ignition. Then, you went right behind a cloud for a while, but they were tracking you pretty well.|||||CDR|Okay.|||||CC|They also - cut in for about a half minute or so and showed a view of the crowd in just the available light from the booster, and it stood out pretty well.|||||LMP|Okay, Bob. We're going right over Florida now, looking down at Miami. A beautiful view of the Keys all lit up, and I just saw a shooting star right over Miami.|||||CC|Roger.|||||LMP|That's a very, very fine view of Miami. Hard to believe.|||||CC|I'll bet they sat there and watched you go.|00|01|38|44|LMP|Looks like we're right over the Bahamas now, Bob.|||||CC|Roger. I'11 buy that.|||||LMP|Well, I'm not easily impressed, Bob. But I'm certainly impressed by this one.|||||CC|Roger. What's the CMP doing? We haven't heard much from him. Is - is he at the other window?|||||CMP|He's crawling around looking for things down in the LEB.|||||||Tape 3/10||||||||||CC|(Laughter) Okay. They won't let you have a window tonight, huh, Ron?|||||CMP|No, I'll catch one here pretty quick.|||||CC|Just a reminder, if you haven't already done it. There is no need to unstow the TV, because due to this late launch, there's just no site available.|||||CDR|Okay, Bob. We're not going to unstow it.|||||LMP|Bob, I don't - I guess there's no site available for some time, is that correct?|||||CC|That's affirmative. And if I can pull one of you guys away from a window, I've got a TLI plus 90 pad.|||||LMP|Oh, I’d love to copy that. Just a minute.|00|01|4l|29|LMP|Hello, Houston; Apollo 17.

Zero - Sirius and Rigel; 318; 148; 358; no ullage; 009:00; 4897; minus 175; 033:49. Over.|||||CC|Okay, Jack. Good readback.|||||LMP|Okay, Bob. We had - as usual - up here (laughter) a spectacular sunrise, and Gene wants to talk to you.|||||CDR|I got some numbers on Ron's P52 for you, Bob.|||||CC|Okay; standing by to copy. Go ahead.|||||CDR|Okay. NOUN 71 were stars 22 and 24; NOUN 05 are all balls; NOUN 93s are all minus. They're 00.037, 00.007, and 00.021. That's minus 37> minus 07, and minus 21; and they were torqued at 01:51:40.|||||CC|Okay. We copy.|||||LMP|Bob, we're over - what might be - intermediate to low strata that have a very strong crenulation pattern - pulling out some geological terms here. I don't think I've ever seen anything like it -flying.|||||||Tape 4/2||||||||||CC|Roger.|||||LMP|Looks like about a north-south lineation with a very strong crinkling, roughly east-west.|||||CC|Roger. Copy that; that's interesting. You know, you're just directly over that South Atlantic area. Your - you - your path just kind of kept you going right between the - Africa and South America, right dead center all the way.|00|01|57|44|CC|And, 17, just for your information, we've searched all the data we can, and we cannot find anything wrong with the spacecraft or the booster at all. Everything is looking real fine, and the only problem in the air is that - those master alarms that you have reported - we're not able to tie in anything common yet to any of those things either.|||||CDR|Okay, Bob. We have not had any for - quite some time, I think, since the last time we talked to you about them.|||||CC|Roger. Understand. We'll probably get a good workout on that after TLI and try and track it down one more.|||||CDR|Okay. But, also, we have not really been doing much switching since the insertion checklist was complete, either.|||||CC|Roger. Understand. It's got you glued to the windows, I guess, huh.?|||||CDR|They are interesting; I'll say that.|||||IMP|Well, I certainly am, Bob, and - again there's a big - a fairly continuous intermediate cloud deck, I think. And it has patterns comparable to what I've seen on pictures of ice floes.|||||CC|Roger. Understand.|||||LMP|And - of pack ice; I should say pictures of pack ice in the Antarctic.||||||||||||Tape 4/3|00|01|59|00|CC|17, Houston. We've got two questions concerning the MASTER ALARMs. One, do you get the MASTER ALARM on the LEB also; and, two, do you get the tone with the MASTER ALARM?|||||LMP|We did get the tones. The MASTER ALARMs were on both - panel 1 and panel 3. I can’t tell you about the LEB right now. Maybe Ron can.|||||CMP|No, I didn't pay that much attention.|||||CC|Okay.|||||CDR|And, Bob, there was something interesting I wanted to get around to tell you. The - MISSION TIMER down in the LEB, when Ron went down there to get things squared away, was about 15 seconds or so behind all the other clocks.|||||CC|Roger. We copy that.|||||CDR|Okay; and we reset it - resynced it - and it's been running okay. I don’t know whether that's a clue to anything or not, but apparently it happened either during launch - or somewhere before we got down there right after insertion.|||||CC|Okay. We’re going to lose you here in about 9 seconds. You are GO and looking great, and we'll work on it. And if you get another MEV [?], will you check the T/FIR for us?|||||CDR|Yes, sir; sure will do, Bob. We’ll see you. What's our next AOS?|||||CC|Stand by. It's Carnarvon at 02:25-|||||CDR|Thank you.|00|02|25|18|CDR|I see you’re trying.|||||CC|17, Houston. How are you doing?|||||LMP|Well, we're pretty good. You’re wavery here a little bit on signal strength.|||||||Tape 4/4||||||||||CC|Okay. We've got a TLI pad any time you're ready to copy it, Jack.|||||LMP|Goodness; okay, let me get rid of something here. Ron, I'm putting that right underneath you.|||||CC|And, guys, we'd like POO and ACCEPT, please.|||||LMP|Okay.|||||CC|You'll get a CSM state vector if you'll give us POO and ACCEPT.|00|02|25|51|CDR|Got POO and ACCEPT.|||||LMP|Okay. Let me have my favorite pad.|00|02|25|54|CC|Okay. Here's the TLI pad. Time base 6 at 3:02:57; 180, 312, 000; 5:51; DELTA-Vc is 10359.6, 35582; 000, 345, 040; extraction will be at 300, 165, 320; 312.0, 306.0, 57:10, yaw is 0; ejection time, 4 plus 39 plus 00. Over.|||||LMP|Okay, Houston. Here's your TLI pad. 3:02:57; 180, 312, 000; 5:51; 10359.6, 35582; 000, 345, 040; 300, 165, 320; 312.0, 306.0 57:10, 000; ejection time, 4 plus 39 plus 00.|||||CC|Good readback, Jack; and we'd like OMNI Charlie, and it's your computer, and you've got your state vector.|00|02|28|04|LMP|Okay. You’ve got 0MRI Charlie. And, Bob, we had almost a completely weather-free pass over Africa and Madagascar. And the scenery - both aesthetically and geologically - was something like I've never seen before, for sure.|||||CC|Roger.|||||LMP|We got odds and ends on the tape and quite a bit on the film.|||||CC|Roger; good show. Are you saying that you didn't have any weather over that southern Africa there?||||||||||||Tape 4/5|||||LMP|Not very much. Barely broken clouds in some places. Most of the countryside was clear.|||||CC|Roger.|||||LMP|There were - patterns - like I haven’t even seen in textbooks. Maybe I haven’t been looking enough, but some of the desert and grassland patterns were - had the appearance of ice crystals almost, except on a megascale, if you - have ever looked at ice crystals in sand.|||||CC|Roger.|||||LMP|Or, better yet, ice crystals on your car window when you - get out early in the morning up in -northern areas.|||||CC|Roger. And just be advised, we'll be standing by for the GO/NO GO for PYRO ARM when we get to Hawaii, and we'll be giving you a GO for TLI about that time.|||||LMP|Okay; and we'll be ready.|||||CC|And, Ron, in - on the Launch Checklist, on 2-25, on the manual and nominal S-IVB TLI-1, add 34 degrees on the nominal pad for all the pitch angles; and on the manual pad, add 34.5 degrees to all the pitch angles, and you'll have it right.|||||CMP|Okay, Bob. You ... - -|||||CC|And - -|||||CM?|- - let me get set. That's - okay, we'll just add 34 to the nominal and 34.5 to all the manual ones ... - -|||||CC|And you'll want to do that on your cue card also, Ron.|||||CMP|Yes, that's affirm.|||||CC|And we're about ready to LOS; we'll see you at Hawaii.|||||||Tape 4/6||||||||||CDR|Okay, Bob, we'll see you - -|||||CC|02 plus 50 at Hawaii.|||||CDR|Okay, 50. And we'll be into our TLI checklist, and - we'll be ready for that PYRO ARM.|||||CC|Okay.||||||HAWAII (REV 2)|00|02|49|52|CC|Apollo 17, Houston.|||||LMP|Go ahead.|||||CMP|Houston, this is Apollo 17. Go ahead.|||||CC|Hey, Ron, you're sounding great. Good voice here.|||||LMP|Golly, we've got things all set up here and we're kind of standing by for a logic check - whenever you guys - can give us a GO.|||||CC|Roger. As soon as we get some TM in here, we'll give you a GO.|||||LMP|Okay.|00|02|50|37|CC|17, Houston. We’re ready for the logic check.|||||CDR|Okay, Bob. Okay. Wait 1.|00|02|50|55|CDR|Okay. SECS ARM breakers are closed.|||||CC|Roger.|00|02|51|00|CDR|Okay; and LOGIC 1 is ON -|00|02|51|02|CDR|MARK it; and LOGIC 2 is ON -|00|02|51|05|CDR|MARK it.|00|02|51|16|CC|17, you're GO for PYRO ARM.|||||CDR|Thank you; understand GO for PYRO ARM.|||||CC|17 - -||||||||||||Tape 4/7|||||LMP|And, Bob, in case you're interested, there - all through the nightside pass here - there's a -quite a strong - well - stronger than I would have ever expected - horizon glow off to the north. I suspect that, I think Gene said a while ago that it's around on his side also.|||53|15|CC|Roger. Guys, I've got the word you wanted to hear; you are GO for TLI - you're GO for the Moon.|||||CDR|Okay, Robert. I understand. America and Challenger with their S-IVB are GO for TLI.|||||CC|That's affirmative.|||||CDR|You're a sweet talker.|||||CC|We try to please here, Gene.|||||CDR|You know, somehow, Bob, I knew you were going to say that - we were GO - and that you try to please.|||||CC|We've been working together too long, I guess.|||||CDR|Not long enough, yet.|||||CC|And, 17; Houston. You're about 1 minute from LOS, and we'll pick you up at Goldstone at about 3 hours and 00 minutes; and that's only a couple of minutes prior to time base 6 start.|||||CDR|Okay, Bob. We'll be with you.|||||CC|Roger.|||||LMP|Bob, that glow is actually above the horizon, just in case you're curious. I can see - stars below the top of the glow - down closer to the Earth.|00|02|55|21|CC|Roger, Jack.||||||GOLDSTONE (REV 2)|00|03|01|16|CC|17, Houston. We're with you again, and you're looking good.|||||||Tape 4/8||||||||||CMP|Okay; mighty fine, Bob.||||23|CDR|And, Bob, we've got the PYROs ARMED now.|||||CC|Roger. And you can expect some different OMNI calls as we go LOS and AOS again.|||||CDR|Okay.|||||CMP|I always expect that, Bob.|||||CC|Roger.|00|03|03|00|CDR|SEP light is ON on time.|||||CC|Roger.|00|03|03|07|CC|And it shows time base 6 right on time, Gene.|||||CDR|Okay.|||||CC|We'd like OMNI Delta, please.|00|03|03|27|LMP|Okay, you've got it.|||||CC|Roger.|||||IMP|I'll just switch, Bob.

Don't want to forget me. We're just watching everything; we can't find anything wrong, so we're just trying to keep quiet here.|||||CDR|Okay, Bob. We're watching the S-IVB tanks pressurize.||||||||||||Tape 4/9|||||CC|Roger.|||||CDR|You ought to look for the good things rather than the bad.|||||CC|Well, that's good when we don't find anything wrong.|||||CDR|Can't agree more.|00|03|07|30|CC|17, the chilldown is in progress, and the tank pressures are looking good.|||||CDR|Okay, Bob; looking down here.|00|03|09|35|CC|17, Houston.

We'd like OMNI Delta.|00|03|22|59|LMP|Okay. I picked it up a little bit. How do you read now?|||||CC|Read you loud and clear.|||||LMP|Okay. I hope you got all that. It was a beautiful burn, right through sunrise. Did you get the numbers?|||||||Tape 5/2||||||||||CC|Yes, we copied your V and your EMS numbers, and we've got a number for you.

We're making plans here for a spacecraft SEP time of 03 plus 43.|||||LMP|03 plus 43. Roger.|00|03|27|27|CC|17, Houston. We're copying cabin press of 5-9 this time.|||||CMP|Roger. We - we just got it, Bob.|||||CC|Okay.|||||CMP|Thank you.|00|03|31|55|LMP|Frame 65 for the LMPs mag November November.|00|03|34|10|LMP|Okay. We - we are maneuvering, Houston.|||||CC|Roger. We're watching it.|||||CMP|Now we've got a few very bright particles or fragments or something that go drifting by as we maneuver.|||||CC|Roger. Understand.|||||LMP|There's a whole bunce of big ones on my window down there - just bright. It looks like the Fourth of July out of Ron's window.|||||CMP|Yes. Now you can see some of them in shape. They're very Jagged, angular fragments that arc-tumbling.||||||||||||Tape 5/3|||||CC|Roger. They look like fluid of some sort?|||||CMP|Not to me. They look like pieces of something.|||||CC|Roger.|||||CMP|They're very bright.|||||CC|Jack, we'd like OMNI Charlie.|||||CMP|Bob, for the most part, these fragments are not -or are tumbling at a very slow rate. I tried a couple of pictures of them - different settings. You may get an idea of what, at least, the patterns look like.|||||CC|Roger. I've got you. We're all ears on these fragments. Do you think you can figure out what t?iey might be?|||||CMP|Well, you know I - I don't know. There are a number of possibilities. If you had some kind of a -I got the impression maybe they were curved a little bit, as if they might be - off the side of the S-IVB. And that's a wild guess - -|||||CDR|Okay. RCS LOGIC is ... --|||||CMP|- - ice chunks, possibly. Or maybe there's paint coming off of it.|00|03|37|34|CC|Roger. I noticed on one trip up the elevator last weak near one of the flags. I thought it was on the S-II, but it might have been on the S-IVB. Looked like it was peeling. Maybe that's what you've got.|00|03|37|45|CC|And the S-IVB maneuver is complete.|00|03|37|46|LMP|... in 1 minute.|||||CDR|Okay. We'll set the old clock.|||||CMP|Okay. And the - with the maneuver complete, the fragment field is essentially static, except for very slight tumbling within the fragments.|||||||Tape 5/4||||||00|03|38|01|CC|Roger. Cut in.|||||CMP|Every once in a while, a fragment of considerably higher velocity than the others goes across my window. But that's very rare.|||||CC|Roger.|||||CMP|Hey, that's that field of view I saw out rcy window Jack, do you see it now?|||||LMP|Yes.|||||CMP|And, Bob. At least, there - there's no apparent relative motion between fragments.|||||CC|Roger. Understand.|||||CMP|I'll take two pictures about a minute apart if I can. And it'll be Frame 70.|||||CC|Okay. Frame 70.|||||CDR|And, Bob. This is Geno. My impression is that they are - flat, flakelike particles. Some may be 6 inches across. And, although there's no relative motion between the two, most of them seem to be twinkling. And I think, for the most part, they're all moving away from us.|||||CC|Roger, Gene. Thank you.|00|03|39|35|CMP|Okay. We've got 0l80 and 0 on the old thumbwheels|||||LMP|Okay.|||||CC|Roger, Ron.|00|03|39|53|CMP|Okay.

We don't have a very good knock - lockon here in REACQ.|||||CC|Roger, Jack. We're reading you pretty good -voice.|||||LMP|Okay. It looks like it's improving.

I don't know - about a hundred ... - -|||||LMP|That's good news. It seemed to smoo - slew very smoothly, so it looks all right.|||||CC|Roger, Jack.|||||LMP|ATT l/RATE 2?|||||||Tape 5/8||||||||||CDR|I can't tell you too much, Bob, from the center seat other than Captain America is very intent on getting Challenger at the moment.|||||CC|Roger. I can believe that.|00|03|48|26|CMP|Yes, I'm coming in a little slow, but we've got plenty of time.|00|03|48|59|CDR|Okay, Houston. While we're moving in here, I can see a few chunks of that platy material, possibly paint, down in the SLA sort of bouncing around between the S-IVB and the LM.|||||CC|Roger.|||||CDR|But, so far, LM looks very clean. Can't see anything abnormal from this view yet.|||||CC|Okay.|||||LMP|Isn't it, though? That thing is really stable out there.|00|03|50|31|LMP|Yes. Can you see it at all, Gene?|00|03|51|20|LMP|Got one little chunk coming out - it just came out of the SLA, and it's spinning along the long axis, and it looks very stable.|||||CC|Roger.|||||LMP|Every once in a while, a small particle flies off of it though.|||||CC|How big of a chunk are you talking about, Jack?|||||LMP|Say again?|||||CC|How big an item are you talking about?||||||||||||||||||||||||Tape 5/9|||||LMP|That's how long it was, and about - oh, a fifth that thick or that wide.|||||CC|Roger.|||||LMP|And I don't think - I don't think it's more than a quarter of an inch or maybe even less thick.|||||CDR|That same particle, Bob, came by and as it went spinning, it was throwing off pieces of itself -radially out.|||||CC|Roger. We copy.|00|03|52|31|CDR|There's a small one come floating by and it looked like flakes. And I think I caught three of the four SLA panels going as we were maneuvering. I've got one out the hatch window now. It's quite a ways out.|||||CC|Roger.|||||CDR|It's tumbling in all three axes.|||||LMP|And I saw the fourth one out my side, so we saw them all.|||||LMP|Area around the two spacecraft is cleaned up pretty well by now.

Is that what you’re looking at?|||||LMP|Yes, I'm looking right at it. And I got a good view of the MESA top anyway. It's pretty well covered, but it looks all right also.|||||CC|Roger.|||||LMP|All the antennas look good; thruster quads all look great. I could see all four of them a minute ago.|||||||Tape 5-10||||||||||CMP|Okay, about 10 feet there, Gene. Stand by for a ... on the barber pole.|||||CDR|Okay.|||||CMP|All right; in good shape.|00|03|56|35|CMP|It' s out now.|00|03|56|45|CDR|Capture, Houston.|||||CC|Roger. We copy.|||||CMP|Okay, we're FREE; rates look pretty good. Let's lock it together.|||||LMP|Okay. You ready?|||||CMP|Ready. She's lined up not bad.|||||CDR|Okay.|||||CMP|PRIM 1.|00|03|57|03|CDR|MARK it. Stand by.|00|03|57|04|CMP|Here she comes.|00|03|57|10|CMP|Ka-chunk. My gosh!|00|03|57|13|CDR|Okay, Houston, ripple fire; but we still have number A barber pole.|||||CC|Roger. We copy.|00|03|57|19|CDR|And we have a MASTER - and a MASTER ALARM.|||||CC|Roger.|||||CDR|We got - we got the most of the latches, but A is barber pole, and B is gray.|00|03|57|29|CMP|Okay, check both circuit breakers; they're IN. Yes, Okay.|||||CMP|We had one clear fire, maybe one or two latches and then a ripple fire on the rest.||||||||||||Tape 5/11|||||CC|Roger.|||||CMP|And, by the way, I had a good view into the ACT, and I can still look in there, and it's very clean.|||||CC|Roger.|||||CMP|In fact - -|||||CC|Ron and Gene, we saw your MASTER ALARM. Did you have any - anything on the matrix light up?|||||CDR|No, not a thing. I looked.|||||CC|Roger.|00|03|59|20|CDR|Okay, Bob, we're going to go ahead and take a look at that docking malfunction before we press on here further and check this barber pole out.|||||CC|Roger, We're working some words up here. We'll be back with you in a second on that, Gene.|00|03|59|33|CDR|Okay. We're down on the checklist through the EDS POWER breakers, OPEN.|||||CC|Understand.|||||CDR|And, Houston, in case we didn't tell you, it's talkback A that's barber pole.|||||CC|Understand. We have it.|||||CC|Say - say, Gene, we don't think it's a problem. We'll find out what it is when you get in. We think we should just press right on with the Flight Plan checklist and keep going.|||||CDR|Okay, we concur with that. Okay, we'll press on, Bob.|00|04|01|38|CDR|Okay, Bob. We just got a MASTER ALARM when I went to the RETRACT PRIM, from 1 to OFF.|||||CC|Roger. We copy that.

We're reading a DELTA-P of greater than 4, and I'm going to open the PRESSURE EQUALIZATION VALVE now.|||||CC|Roger, 17. We copy that.|00|04|08|44|CDR|Okay, the DELTA-P is coming down, Bob.|||||CC|Roger.|||||CC|Gene, while you're watching that, I just thought you'd be interested. We talked to some of our friends down at the Cape who watched the launch , and they said you were aglow all the way until you faded into - you couldn't tell you from a star. They saw staging, and they could just see you as a star way off in the distance until you faded out. Not a cloud in the way at all.|00|04|09|31|CDR|Beautiful. Okay, we're at - we're at 2, and we're monitoring it for 3 minutes.|||||CC|Okay.|00|04|09|46|LMP|And, Houston. While we're checking the integrity here, on mag Alfa Alfa, there's about 50 percent.|||||CC|Mag Alfa Alfa, 50 percent. Roger.|00|ou|12|28|CDR|Okay, Bob. That's 3 minutes. It's - DELTA-P change is less than 0.1.|||||CC|Three minutes and less than 0.1.|||||CDR|We are pressing on.|||||CC|Roger; press.|00|04|14|18|CMP|Okay, you want cabin's at 4.8 now; REPRESS is about empty. Okay. No, not yet, it's still getting a little bit.|||||CMP|That REPRESS PACKAGE VALVE is kind of noisy.||||||||||||Tape 5/13|00|04|i4|56|CMP|That's all the REPRESS 0 . We'll turn that OFF. Okay, Houston, the REPRESS PACKAGE is empty now, and we're down to a DELTA-P of 0.2.|||||CC|Roger. We copy that.|||||CC|And, 17. Just be advised, you're going to have an S-IVB nonpropulsive vent start 04:18:27- You've got about 3 minutes on that.|||||CDR|(Laughter) Okay. Thank you.|00|04|16|4o|LMP|Can you reach ... there?|||||CMP|Yes, I'll get them.|00|04|16|43|CDR|Okay, Bob. We seem to be holding DELTA-P at about 0.2. I suspect that's probably zero.|||||CC|Roger. We copy that.|00|04|17|00|CDR|And the cabin pressure's about 4.5. You want us to wait until 5 psi for the EMERGENCY CABIN PRESSURE SELECTS?|||||CC|Negative on that. Let's just go ahead and let's press on.|||||CDR|Okay. They should be BOTH.|00|04|17|33|CMP|Okay, EMERGENCY register working.|||||CMP|Coming down though, Gene. Let's wait until it gets down a little ways.|||||CMP|Yes .|||||CMP|Yes. Straight up and down as well.|||||CMP|Up one one. Must be the nonpropulsive VENT that's banging. (Laughter) Here comes all the - look at all the stuff going again.
