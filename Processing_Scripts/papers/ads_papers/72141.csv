2020AGUFMV017...02S|2020|Geological Context of ANSGA Apollo 17 Double Drive Tube Core 73001/2|Schmitt, H. H.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2020||V017-02|Apollo 17 Station 3 is located in Taurus-Littrow on the younger of two light mantle avalanche units, ~50 m southeast of the rim of the partially buried Lara Crater, and on a lobe of the Lee Lincoln fault scarp. (For location details, see figures in Wolfe, et al., 1983). High Sun LROC images led Schmitt, et al. (2017) to conclude that an older, partially buried avalanche lies southeast of the main light mantle deposit. Rover sample 72141 was obtained on the older unit and appears to confirm this conclusion. The young light mantle avalanche settled in place at about 0.100-0.075 Ga (Schmitt, et al. 2017). <P />Primary Nature of a Light Mantle Avalanche: The light mantle consists of regolith that previously formed on the northeast side of the South Massif. This avalanche source material largely included both commutated melt-breccia, similar to rake sample 72500, and pre-mare litho-clastic ash similar to that present included in rake sample 76500 from the North Massif (Schmitt, 2016). Based on fluidized deposition, collected rock samples, and visual observations, the following are expected: (1) Fines would be concentrated at the top of the avalanche; (2) Coarse fragments would increase in size with depth; (3) the ratio of basalt to impact breccias in the core may be about 1:7; (4) sulfur content about half that of the North Massif regolith (Schmitt, et al. 2017) indicates that trolite (FeS - specific gravity 4.9 g/cm<SUP>3</SUP>) may be concentrated at depth. <P />The minimum depth of the light mantle in the vicinity of Station 3 is about 2 m. Immediately underlying the young light mantle unit, from younger to older, are (1) regolith developed on the old light mantle unit, (2) the old light mantle unit, (3) regolith developed on Lara ejecta, (4) Lara basaltic ejecta, and (5) dark mantle basalt+pyroclastic regolith. <P />Station 3 Trench Samples: The author dug a shallow trench in the rim of the 10 m diameter Ballet Crater and sampled the four irregular, visible units (73220, 40, 60, 80). These same contrasting regolith units may be encountered in the drive tube core. <P />References: <P />Schmittt, H. H. et al. (2017) Icarus, 298. <P />Schmitt, H. H. (2016) LEAG Ann. Mtg.

2020AGUFMV013.0002S|2020|Petrology of soils from the landslide deposit at Taurus-Littrow: Context for the ANGSA double drive tube 73001/73002 from Apollo 17|Simon, S., Jolliff, B. L., Shearer, C. K.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2020||V013-0002|The Apollo Next Generation Sample Analysis (ANGSA) initiative involves the study of previously unopened or uniquely processed lunar samples returned by Apollo missions. Among these samples is the Apollo 17 double drive tube 73001/73002, collected at Station 3 in the landslide deposit ("light mantle", LM) at the base of South Massif. <P />Grain mounts from 73001/73002 are not yet available but to improve our understanding of its geologic context and the geology of the Apollo 17 site we studied four surface soils collected during lunar roving vehicle (LRV) traverses. Two (72141 and 74121, from stations LRV-2 and LRV-6, resp.) are from the LM and two (72150 and 75111, from LRV-3 and LRV-7, resp.) are from the mare floor immediately adjacent to the LM. A polished grain mount of the 90-150 µm fraction of each soil was studied with a scanning electron microscope and electron probe. Until now only modal, maturity, and bulk chemical data were available for these samples. <P />We found that 72141 surprisingly lacks the Mg-rich, Ca-poor pyroxenes found in the other soils considered here. Most of the plagioclase grains in the LM soils are more calcic than An<SUB>89</SUB> and are probably derived from highland rocks. Both LM soils have olivine more forsteritic than Fo<SUB>90</SUB>, suggesting a troctolitic source. One grain of pink spinel was found in 74121, also indicative of a plutonic component. Pink spinel lithologies have also been found at other locations in the LM (Stations 2 and 3). The pyroxene populations in the valley floor soils extend to more Fe-rich compositions than those from the LM, owing to their larger mare basalt components, and are comparable to that of Sculptured Hills soil 78221. The minimum highland fraction of pyroxene, on the basis of quadrilateral components, is very low in all soils studied. Orange glass beads with compositions indistinguishable from that of 74220 were found in all samples except 74121. <P />In addition to the glasses and monomineralic grains the samples contain fragments of high-Ti mare basalts and various non-mare lithologies such as recrystallized noritic breccias, crystalline matrix breccias, and feldspathic plutonic rocks. The lithic fragment populations are typical of Apollo 17 regolith. These samples and those from the Station 3 trench will provide a valuable basis for comparison with the new samples from the 73001/73002 drive tube.|
2010Icar..208..548G|2010|A new look at photometry of the Moon|Goguen, Jay D., Stone, Thomas C., Kieffer, Hugh H., Buratti, Bonnie J.|Icarus|208|2|548|We use ROLO photometry (Kieffer, H.H., Stone, T.C. [2005]. Astron. J. 129, 2887-2901) to characterize the before and after full Moon radiance variation for a typical highlands site and a typical mare site. Focusing on the phase angle range 45° &lt; α &lt; 50°, we test two different physical models, macroscopic roughness and multiple scattering between regolith particles, for their ability to quantitatively reproduce the measured radiance difference. Our method for estimating the rms slope angle is unique and model-independent in the sense that the measured radiance factor I/ F at small incidence angles (high Sun) is used as an estimate of I/ F for zero roughness regolith. The roughness is determined from the change in I/ F at larger incidence angles. We determine the roughness for 23 wavelengths from 350 to 939 nm. There is no significant wavelength dependence. The average rms slope angle is 22.2° ± 1.3° for the mare site and 34.1° ± 2.6° for the highland site. These large slopes, which are similar to previous "photometric roughness" estimates, require that sub-mm scale "micro-topography" dominates roughness measurements based on photometry, consistent with the conclusions of Helfenstein and Shepard (Helfenstein, P., Shepard, M.K. [1999]. Icarus 141, 107-131). We then tested an alternative and very different model for the before and after full Moon I/ F variation: multiple scattering within a flat layer of realistic regolith particles. This model consists of a log normal size distribution of spheres that match the measured distribution of particles in a typical mature lunar soil 72141,1 (McKay, D.S., Fruland, R.M., Heiken, G.H. [1974]. Proc. Lunar Sci. Conf. 5, Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 1 (5), 887-906). The model particles have a complex index of refraction 1.65-0.003 i, where 1.65 is typical of impact-generated lunar glasses. Of the four model parameters, three were fixed at values determined from Apollo lunar soils: the mean radius and width of the log normal size distribution and the real part of the refraction index. We used FORTRAN programs from Mishchenko et al. (Mishchenko, M.I., Dlugach, J.M., Yanovitskij, E.G., Zakharova, N.T. [1999]. J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Trans. 63, 409-432; Mishchenko, M.I., Travis, L.D., Lacis, A.A. [2002]. Scattering, Absorption and Emission of Light by Small Particles. Cambridge Univ. Press, New York. &lt; http://www.giss.nasa.gov/staff/mmishchenko/books.html&gt;) to calculate the scattering matrix and solve the radiative transfer equation for I/ F. The mean single scattering albedo is ω = 0.808, the asymmetry parameter is &lt;cos Θ&gt; = 0.77 and the phase function is very strongly peaked in both the forward and backward scattering directions. The fit to the observations for the highland site is excellent and multiply scattered photons contribute ⩾80% of I/ F. We conclude that either model, roughness or multiple scattering, can match the observations, but that the strongly anisotropic phase functions of realistic particles require rigorous calculation of many orders of scattering or spurious photometric roughness estimates are guaranteed. Our multiple scattering calculation is the first to combine: (1) a regolith model matched to the measured particle size distribution and index of refraction of the lunar soil, (2) a rigorous calculation of the particle phase function and solution of the radiative transfer equation, and (3) application to lunar photometry with absolute radiance calibration.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2010.03.025
