2013AGUSMGP24A..05F|2013|Lunar Paleomagnetism|Fuller, M., Weiss, B. P.|AGU Spring Meeting Abstracts|2013||GP24A-05|We have completed a reanalysis of the old Apollo paleomagnetic data using modern techniques of analysis and presentation. The principal result from the mare basalts is that several samples, such as 10020, 10017, 10049, and 70215 appear to be carrying primary natural remanent magnetization (NRM) acquired on the Moon as they cooled initially on the lunar surface, but in almost every case alternating field (AF) demagnetization was not carried out to strong enough fields to isolate this primary magnetization properly. When modern measurements are available, the agreement between old Apollo era data and new data is strikingly good. It also appears that the fields recorded by the basalts of Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 are stronger than those recorded by Apollo 12 and Apollo 15 basalts. Indeed it is not clear that any reliable records have come from these younger samples. The histories of breccias are more complicated than those of mare basalts and their NRM is harder to interpret. For regolith breccias, interpretations are complicated because of their strong superparamagnetic components and their complex, polymict lithologies. It would be unwise to use these samples for paleointensity estimates unless one can be sure that the NRM was entirely acquired as TRM during cooling after the shock event, as may be the case for 15498. In contrast, the melt rock and melt breccias, which include samples formed at high temperatures far above the Curie point of any magnetic carriers, have an excellent chance of recording lunar fields faithfully as they cool. This cooling may have taken place in a melt pool in a simple crater, or in a melt layer in a complex crater. Such samples would then have been excavated and deposited in the regolith and some appear to have recorded strong fields, but more work needs to be done to test this suggestion. Other melt rocks and melt breccias have had more complicated histories and appear to have been deposited in ejecta blankets, where final cooling took place. A useful, if imperfect, analogy may be pyroclastic volcanic deposits. The samples from the Apollo 17 layered boulder 1 at station 2 provide an example of this history. If a pTRM can be related to this secondary cooling, then we may recover a record of the field during this cooling. Samples such as 62235 and 72215 may provide just such a record, with Apollo-era and modern estimates of fields of the order of around 100 microT. Explaining such high paleointensities so late in lunar history is a major challenge to dynamo models based on cooling of the core, given its small size, and has led to alternative models.|
2011AGUFM.P13D1696F|2011|Lunar paleomagnetism: a new analysis of the Apollo-era paleomagnetic measurements|Fuller, M., Weiss, B. P.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2011||P13D-1696|The Apollo era lunar paleomagnetism suffered from the lack of modern instrumentation and data analysis techniques. However, paleomagnetic data for nearly 100 samples were reported. We have completed a reanalysis of these old Apollo paleomagnetic data using modern techniques of analysis. The principal result from the mare basalts is that many samples such as 10020, 10017, 10049, 12022, and 70215 appear to be carrying primary natural remanent magnetization (NRM) acquired on the Moon as they initially cooled on the lunar surface, but in almost every case alternating field (AF) demagnetization was not carried out to strong enough fields to isolate this primary magnetization properly. When modern measurements are available, the agreement between old Apollo era data and new data is strikingly good. It also appears that the fields recorded by the basalts of Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 may be stronger than those recorded by Apollo 12 basalts, but the small number of high fidelity magnetic recorders among the latter group make this tentative at present. The histories of breccias are more complicated than those of mare basalts and their NRM is harder to interpret. The regolith and fragmental breccias have NRM, which is either a combination of shock remanent magnetization (SRM) acquired during shock lithification and partial to total thermal remanent magnetization (TRM) depending upon the residual temperature after the shock event. For regolith breccias, interpretations are complicated because of their strong superparamagnetic components and their complex, polymict lithologies. It would be unwise to use these samples for paleointensity estimates unless one can be sure that the NRM was entirely acquired as TRM during cooling after the shock event, such as may be the case for 15498.

This cooling may have taken place in a melt pool in a simple crater, or in a melt layer in a complex crater. Such samples would then have been excavated and deposited in the regolith. Samples 14310, 68416, 77017 and 77135 may have had such simple histories and some appear to have recorded strong fields, but more work needs to be done to test this suggestion.

E.|Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series A|285|1327|159|Melting experiments in vacuum at Fe-saturation for high-Ti basalt compositions 70215 and 15318 Red Glass, and low-Ti basalt composition 15555-15016, have defined equilibrium crystallization sequences and the liquid-lines-of-descent, and show that much of the chemical variety in the natural samples is due to near-surface fractionation processes. However, the various groups within the high-Ti suite (Apollo 11 low-K, Apollo 11 high-K and Apollo 17 basalts; Apollo 17 Orange Glass) cannot be interrelated by such processes, nor can the high-Ti suite be a near-surface derivative of a low-Ti parent magma. Likewise, the low-Ti Apollo 12 basalts and Apollo 15 basalts and Green Glass cannot be interrelated by simple fractionation, although much of the chemical variety within each group is explained by olivine fractionation. On the basis of high-pressure studies, low-Ti basalts are believed to originate as a spectrum of partial melts from a previously differentiated olivine-pyroxenite lunar mantle, at depths ranging from approximately 200-500 km. High-Ti basalts are interpreted as hybrid liquids resulting from the assimilation of subcrustal Ti-rich material by a parental magma of low-Ti type.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsta.1977.0052
1977LPSC....8.1201S|1977|The moon and Q.|Schreiber, E.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||1201|The acoustic attenuation of a sample of lunar basalt 70215 was measured by the method of sphere resonance. A Q of 1185 was achieved under a vacuum of 7 millionths torr after heating the sample. He and CO2 gas caused a small decrease of Q. H2O vapor, however, resulted in a major decrease in Q. The Q of lunar material when measured on earth is low because of adsorbed gases. However, it is not clear that this effect explains completely the observed high lunar Q.|

L.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1489|Three Apollo 17 basalts were studied by the laser Ar-39-Ar-40 method. The 70215 basalt has a normal well-behaved Ar-39-Ar-40 release pattern; the 70017 basalt has a disturbed release pattern which indicates a limited intermediate maximum age followed by a broad low-age region; and the 75035 basalt has a pattern initially similar to 70017 that is followed by a high-temperature maximum age. The laser study shows that all mineral systems in 70215 have small and uniform temperature losses, while the laser-determined ages for 70017 and 75035 are, apparently, primarily controlled by the minerals containing mesostasis inclusions. It is possible that the drop in ages observed by the conventional Ar-39-Ar-40 method was due not only to recoil of Ar-39 during neutron irradiation but also to gas loss from some minerals. It is suggested that the plagioclases are the best minerals to use for a reliable age.|

F.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||447|Petrographic studies of Apollo 17 mare basalts indicate that 70215 and 71569 arrived at the lunar surface as liquids. Low-pressure melting experiments show that compositional variations within the Apollo 17 and Apollo 11 ophitic basalt suites may be generated by near-surface fractional crystallization of liquids with compositions similar to 70215 and 70017. High-pressure melting experiments show that liquids similar in composition to 70017 and 70215 can be generated by partial melting of an olivine+clinopyroxene+Fe-Ti-oxide source at depths of 100-150 km within the moon.|
1974Icar...22..459S|1974|Microcrater Populations on Apollo 17 Rocks|Schneider, E., Hoerz, F.|Icarus|22|4|459|Approximately 6000 microcrates were investigated using binocular microscope techniques on Apollo 17 rocks 70215, 72215, 72235, 72395, 72435, 73216, 73218, 73275, 74275, 76135, 76136 and 79155. The crater populations observed have identical characteristics to those obtained from previous missions. Special emphasis was placed on assessing the influence of target properties on the observable crater populations. Although these properties cannot be quantitatively evaluated at present, the empirical results indicate that crater populations on glass, breccia, and crystalline rock surfaces may differ fundamentally. As a consequence, lunar surface exposure ages of individual rocks based on micrometeoroid craters may be subject to criticism.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0019-1035(74)90079-7
