These zircon grains preserve deformation microstructures that show a wide range in style and complexity. Planar deformation features (PDFs) are documented in lunar zircon for the first time, and occur along {001}, {110}, and {112}, typically with 0.1-25 μm spacing. The widest PDFs associated with {112} contain microtwin lamellae with 65°/&lt;110&gt; misorientation relationships. Deformation bands parallel to {100} planes and irregular low-angle (&lt;10°) boundaries most commonly have &lt;001&gt; misorientation axes. This geometry is consistent with a dislocation glide system with &lt;100&gt;{010} during dislocation creep. Nonplanar fractures, recrystallized domains with sharp, irregular interfaces, and localized annealing textures along fractures are also observed. No occurrences of reidite were detected. Shock-deformation microstructures in zircon are explained in terms of elastic anisotropy of zircon. PDFs form along a limited number of specific {hkl} planes that are perpendicular to directions of high Young's modulus, suggesting that PDFs are likely to be planes of longitudinal lattice damage. Twinned {112} PDFs also contain directions of high shear modulus. A conceptual model is proposed for the development of different deformation microstructures during an impact event. This “shock-deformation mechanism map” is used to explain the relative timing, conditions, and complexity relationships between impact-related deformation microstructures in zircon.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1945-5100.2011.01316.x
1992ga17.conf...42N|1992|Lithologies Contributing to the Clast Population in Apollo 17 LKFM Basaltic Impact Melts|Norman, Marc D., Taylor, G. Jeffrey, Spudis, Paul, Ryder, Graham|Geology of the Apollo 17 Landing Site|||42|LKFM basaltic impact melts are abundant among Apollo lunar samples, especially those from Apollo 15, 16, and 17. They are generally basaltic in composition, but are found exclusively as impact melts. They seem to be related to basins and so could represent the composition of the lower lunar crust. They contain lithic clasts that cannot be mixed in any proportion to produce the composition of the melt matrix; components rich in transition elements (Ti, Cr, Sc) and REE are not considered. To search for the mysterious cryptic component, we previously investigated the mineral clast population in two Apollo 14 LKFM basaltic impact melts, 15445 and 15455. The cryptic component was not present in the mineral clast assemblage of these breccias either, but some olivine and pyroxene grains appeared to be from lithologies not represented among identified igneous rocks from the lunar highlands. In addition, none of the mineral clasts could be unambiguously assigned to a ferroan anorthosite source. We have now extended this study to Apollo 17, starting with two LKFM impact melt breccias (76295 and 76315) from the Apollo 17 station 6 boulder. The results from the study are presented.|

A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2251|Eighteen sections representing five matrix samples - 76015, 76215, 76275, 76295, and 76315 - from the Station 6 boulder were examined with emphasis on the textures and compositions of their native FeNi metal particles. It is found that many of the complex multiphase structures of the metal particles observed in the study cannot be explained by a continuous two-stage cooling of the impact-melt sheet. It is suggested that at least locally the boulder samples must have experienced multistage cooling and heating.|
