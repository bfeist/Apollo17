2022M&PS...57.1759K|2022|Composition of the Apollo 17 drive tube 76001 and the nonmare lithologies of the North Massif and Luna 20|Korotev, Randy L.|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|57|9|1759|Bulk composition data for 24 chemical elements are presented for regolith samples (&lt;1 mm fines) from each of the 62 half-centimeter dissection intervals along the 31 cm length of the 76001 vertical drive tube collected by astronauts at the base of the North Massif at station 6 of the Apollo 17 landing site. The core regolith is nearly uniform in composition with depth although the concentrations of Sc and Sm, for example, decrease from 28.5 μg g<SUP>−1</SUP> Sc and 5.93 μg g<SUP>−1</SUP> Sm at the top 2.5 cm to 26.9 μg g<SUP>−1</SUP> Sc and 5.55 μg g<SUP>−1</SUP> Sm at the bottom 2.5 cm. This change reflects an increase with depth in the relative abundance of Sm-poor, feldspathic material, from 48.4% at the top to 50.1% at the bottom. On the basis of compositional mass balance, the feldspathic (nonmare) material of the station 6 regolith requires a substantial proportion of an Mg-rich lithology, ~27% when modeled as troctolite sample 76535. The remaining 73% is nominally Sm-poor anorthositic norite in composition. No such Mg-rich component is required to account for the composition of the regolith of the South Massif (stations 2 and 3). The total feldspathic component of the North Massif regolith, normatively an anorthositic troctolite (74 vol% plagioclase, olivine:pyroxene = 55:45, Mg' = 78%), is very similar to that of the nonmare component of the Luna 20 regolith collected 910 km to the southeast on the Crisium ejecta deposit. We also present new composition data for 21, 25, and 16 small lithic fragments (0.1-3.9 mg each) from the regoliths of the Luna 16, 20, and 24 missions.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maps.13900
1998GeCoA..62.3025J|1998|<SUP>14</SUP>C depth profiles in Apollo 15 and 17 cores and lunar rock 68815|Jull, A. J. T., Cloudt, S., Donahue, D. J., Sisterson, J. M., Reedy, R. C., Masarik, J.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|62|17|3025|Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) was used to measure the activity vs. depth profiles of <SUP>14</SUP>C produced by both solar cosmic rays (SCR) and galactic cosmic rays (GCR) in Apollo 15 lunar cores 15001-6 and 15008, Apollo 17 core 76001, and lunar rock 68815. Calculated GCR production rates are in good agreement with <SUP>14</SUP>C measurements at depths below ∼10 cm. Carbon-14 produced by solar protons was observed in the top few cm of the Apollo 15 cores and lunar rock 68815, with near-surface values as high as 66 dpm/kg in 68815. Only low levels of SCR-produced <SUP>14</SUP>C were observed in the Apollo 17 core 76001. New cross sections for production of <SUP>14</SUP>C by proton spallation on O, Si, Al, Mg, Fe, and Ni were measured using AMS. These cross sections are essential for the analysis of the measured <SUP>14</SUP>C depth profiles. The best fit to the activity-depth profiles for solar-proton-produced <SUP>14</SUP>C measured in the tops of both the Apollo 15 cores and 68815 was obtained for an exponential rigidity spectral shape R <SUB>0</SUB> of 110-115 MV and a 4π flux (J <SUB>10</SUB>, Ep &gt; 10 MeV) of 103-108 protons/cm <SUP>2</SUP>/s. These values of R <SUB>0</SUB> are higher, indicating a harder rigidity, and the solar-proton fluxes are higher than those determined from <SUP>10</SUP>Be, <SUP>26</SUP>Al, and <SUP>53</SUP>Mn measurements.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0016-7037(98)00193-8

T., Cloudt, S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference|27||627|Due to their long exposure times, lunar soils and rocks provide a continuous record of galactic (GCR) and solar-cosmic-ray (SCR) intensities. Lunar cores are very useful in studies of the production of nuclides by GCR particles in very large objects. Lunar samples also contain especially good records of SCR effects and variations of SCR fluxes in the past. We report on new 14C measurements obtained as a function of depth in the Apollo 17 drive tube core, 76001. This core was described as undisturbed by NASA documentation. The core was collected at a break in the slope of North Massif, on an 11o slope. Results are shown in the figure and compared to our earlier experimental results on the apparently undisturbed Apollo 15 cores 15001-15006 and 15008. The results show a disturbance of the core data in the top few g/cm^2 of this core.|
1993LPI....24..819K|1993|Composition of Apollo 17 Core 76001|Korotev, Randy L., Bishop, Kaylynn M.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference|||819|Core 76001 is a single drive tube containing a column of regolith taken at the base of the North Massif, station 6, Apollo 17. The core material is believed to have accumulated through slow downslope mass wasting from the massif. As a consequence, the core soil is mature throughout its length. Results of INAA for samples taken every half centimeter along the length of the core indicate that there is only minor systematic compositional variation with depth. Concentrations of elements primarily associated with mare basalt (Sc, Fe) and noritic impact melt breccia (Sm) decrease slightly with depth, particularly between 20 cm and the bottom of the core at 32 cm depth. This is consistent with petrographic studies that indicate a greater proportion of basalt and melt breccia in the top part of the core. However, Sm/Sc and La/Sm ratios are remarkably constant with depth, indicating no variation in the ratio of mare material to Sm-rich highlands material with depth. Other than these subtle changes, there is no compositional evidence for the two stratigraphic units (0-20 cm and 20-32 cm) defined on the basis of modal petrography, although all samples with anomalously high Ni concentrations (Fe-Ni metal nuggets) occur above 20 cm depth.|

W.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1497|Measurements of Al-26 and Mn-53 in the Apollo 17 drive tube 76001 show a clear integral excess of activity above expected production down to a depth of at least 9 gm/sq cm. This excess is interpreted as a continuous accretion of highly irradiated surface material slowly transported downslope by impact or other processes at a buildup rate of 1.5 cm/m.y. This drive tube, 76001, was collected near a change in slope on the North Massif. Integral excesses have also been observed in other Apollo 16 and 17 cores. Evidence in the Al-26 and Mn-53 record for continuous accretion is shown for Apollo 16 cores 60007 and 60010 and the Apollo 16 deep drill string 70009-70001. This evaluation shows that accretion at specific sites, either through continuous downslope movement or regolith material on the moon, or simply through small impact redistribution, is common on both small and large scales.|

Track densities of individual grains and quartile track densities as a function of depth are presented for the Apollo 14 core; and although they are characteristic of typical mature soils, they show striking variations with depth. A gradual accumulation of the Apollo 15 core is favored, and the Apollo 17 core is found to be heavily irradiated. With the exception of a sample taken at 27 cm depth, and in contrast with the other sections studied, the whole core 76001 consists of material in which the quartile track density is in excess of 10 to the 8th per sq cm.|
1980LPSC...11.1609P|1980|Apollo 17 drive tube 76001: modal petrology.|Papike, J. J., Wyszynski, J.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1609|Twelve polished thin sections from Apollo 17 drive tube 76001 have been studied by optical petrography. The entire core is found to be mature showing little variation in depth, which is consistent with a depositional model involving slow downslope movement of the regolith by mass wasting. However, within the core some major differences are preserved between two stratigraphic units. Unit A (20-31 cm depth) is enriched in gabbroic anorthosite relative to unit B (0-20 cm depth), while unit B is enriched in KREEPY noritic breccias relative to unit A. This observation is interpreted in terms of a stratigraphy for North Massif involving a noritic breccia unit overlying a unit enriched in gabbroic anorthosite. Pronounced differences between the highland/mare ratios in drive tube 76001 and the Apollo 17 drill core separated by only 3.5 km demonstrate the relative inefficiency of lateral transport as a regolith mixing mechanism on the moon.|
1979LPSC...10.1385N|1979|Drive tube 76001 - continuous accumulation with complications?|Nagle, J. S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1385|Lunar core 76001 is a 4 cm-diameter drive tube, collected 12 meters downhill and to the side of the Station 6 boulder complex at the foot of the North Massif. The core contains dark, fine-grained, FMR-mature soil with scattered, very-large fragments of crystallized-matrix breccia. Except for the large rock fragments, the soil column is unusually fine and homogeneous for a lunar core. Petrographically, soil in 76001 is different from dark fine soils in 14211/10, 60010 and 70009. Although there is evidence that maturation was an important process in formation of dark soils in 14211/10, 60010 and 70009, clast populations and particle interrelationships in 76001 show no evidence of maturation, but they show no clear-cut indication of mixing, either. These characteristics are best explained if the core had been deposited by slow continuous accumulation, rather than by gardening, landslide or impact ejection. Because the coring site is at the foot of a mountain, downslope creep is the most favored mechanism for the slow accumulation of soil. A perturbation in the mode of accumulation occurred at 22 m.y. ago, when the Station 6 boulders were emplaced; soils at the coring site, in the downhill wake of the boulders, became finer and laced with boulder fragments.|
