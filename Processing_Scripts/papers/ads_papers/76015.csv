The geology of this site, on the eastern edge of Mare Serenitatis, was thoroughly investigated during extra vehicular activities performed during three days spent at the surface [1, 2]. A total of 111 kg of well-documented rock and soil samples were collected and brought back to Earth during this last Apollo mission. Among several waypoints of interest, astronauts spent more than one hour to investigate five large boulder fragments at Station 6, lying at the base of a long boulder trail descending from the North Massif. These boulders might originate in material emplaced as a result from the ejected melt sheet from the Crisium impact event [2], or Serenitatis impact event [3, 4]. In a recent study [5], we used scanned photographs taken in situ with astronaut's Hasselblad cameras to reconstruct a 3D model of each of the boulders using photogrammetry techniques [6].In addition to the 3D reconstruction of the boulders themselves reported in [5], we pushed the reconstruction process one step further by taking advantage of the fact that the rock samples hammered from the boulders at Station 6 were thoroughly documented once brought back on Earth in the Lunar Receiving Lab facility in Houston. In particular, several stereoscopic photographic pairs were systematically acquired for a significant number of the samples. When a sufficient number of viewpoints have been acquired, this potentially allows a complete photogrammetric 3D reconstruction of the rocks themselves. We used as input original photographs available on the Lunar and Planetary Institute website (https://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/samples/atlas/). We first performed a color balancing of the scans of these photos. Then, masks corresponding to a detouring of the rocks were applied to avoid errors induced by the fixed background in the photogrammetric project. By manually adding tie points, we were able to compute a detailed textured 3D model of sample 76315 (a micropoikilitic impact melt breccia), sample 76215 (a vesicular micropoikilitic impact melt breccia), and sample 76015 (another vesicular micropoikilitic impact melt breccia, which was chipped off top corner of Block 5 of the big boulder at Station 6). The full reconstruction process is illustrated in Fig. 1 for sample 76215. We have posted the 3D models of these samples on the Sketchfab web platform at https://sketchfab.com/LPG-3D to allow their easy visual inspection. These 3D models are of particular interest as these lunar samples have been broken into multiple pieces after being photographed. The 3D numerical model can therefore be thought as a kind of historical heritage of the original rocks, which do not exist anymore in their original form. Using this reconstruction, we can obtain a copy of the shape of these original rocks using a 3D-Printer (Fig. 2). They can also be viewed using augmented reality, with a cellphone or a tablet, or even manipulated in virtual reality on Sketchfab using a VR headset (Fig 2). From a more scientific point of view, the 3D models theoretically allow to replace the samples in their original position and orientation directly on the 3D models of the original boulders themselves (Fig 3). This is of particular interest to retrieve the precise original orientation of the sample, to investigate for example the characteristics of coatings. On sample 76015, at least three different units show various degree of alteration, which can be correlated with the original position of the sample with respect to its environment. The upper sky-facing side is the most affected by space weathering effects, with a well-developed patina. On its lower edge, a less altered face protected by a crevice might correspond to a lower alteration degree developed during only 20 million years, the approximate age of the impact generating the fall of the boulders from the North Massif slopes according to radiogenic dating.

2017M&PS...52..584T|2017|Impact history of the Apollo 17 landing site revealed by U-Pb SIMS ages|Thiessen, Fiona, Nemchin, Alexander A., Snape, Joshua F., Whitehouse, Martin J., Bellucci, Jeremy J.|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|52|4|584|Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) U-Pb ages of Ca-phosphates from four texturally distinct breccia samples (72255, 76055, 76015, 76215) collected at the Apollo 17 landing site were obtained in an attempt to identify whether they represent a single or several impact event(s). The determined ages, combined with inferences from petrologic relationships, may indicate two or possibly three different impact events at 3920 ± 3 Ma, 3922 ± 5 Ma, and 3930 ± 5 Ma (all errors 2σ). Searching for possible sources of the breccias by calculating the continuous ejecta radii of impact basins and large craters as well as their expected ejecta thicknesses, we conclude that Nectaris, Crisium, Serenitatis, and Imbrium are likely candidates. If the previous interpretation that the micropoikilitic breccias collected at the North Massif represent Serenitatis ejecta is correct, then the average <SUP>207</SUP>Pb/<SUP>206</SUP>Pb age of 3930 ± 5 Ma (2σ) dates the formation of the Serenitatis basin. The occurrence of zircon in the breccias sampled at the South Massif, which contain Ca-phosphates yielding an age of 3922 ± 5 Ma (2σ), may indicate that the breccia originated from within the Procellarum KREEP terrane (PKT) and the Imbrium basin appears to be the only basin that could have sourced them. However, this interpretation implies that all basins suggested to fall stratigraphically between Serenitatis and Imbrium formed within a short (&lt;11 Ma) time interval, highlighting serious contradictions between global stratigraphic constraints, sample interpretation, and chronological data. Alternatively, the slightly older age of the two micropoikilitic breccias may be a result of incomplete resetting of the U-Pb system preserved in some phosphate grains. Based on the currently available data set this possibility cannot be excluded.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maps.12814

Based on SEM petrography, we have defined three textural types of patina: glazed, fragmental, and classic (cratered). The presence of classic patina is diagnostic of lunar samples that have been exposed directly to the space weathering environment. It is characterized by the presence of microcraters and glass pancakes, and is the patina type studied by earlier workers. Classic patina is found on 76015 but not on 75075. Glazed patina is found on both 76015 and 75075, while fragmental patina is found only on 75075. The glazed and fragmental patinas on 75075 were probably formed as a result of relatively large nearby impacts, and although these two types of patina are not strictly the result of direct exposure to the space weathering environment, they are important because they affect the optical properties of the rocks. Field emission gun SEM (FE-SEM) of classic patina on 76015 shows evidence of possible solar wind sputtering erosion. TEM studies of 76015 reveal the presence of impact-generated deposits and solar flare particle tracks which, like microcraters and pancakes, are diagnostic of direct exposure to space weathering processes. The outermost surface of the 76015 patina consists of an amorphous rim very much like the rims found on individual lunar soil grains; this amorphous patina rim probably formed by similar processes of impact-generated vapor condensation and possible sputter deposition. Wavelength-dispersive X-ray (WDS) element maps of polished thin sections of 75075 and 76015 indicate that patina compositions are poor indicators of the compositions and mineralogies of the rocks underlying them. On average, the reflectance spectra of patinas on both samples are slightly darker than those of their unweathered equivalents. Microreflectance measurements show that a thick patina can dramatically alter the optical properties of the rock on which it forms. The backscatter MöF6ssbauer (BaMS) spectrum of a patina-covered surface of 76015 is very similar to that of an unweathered surface, indicating that the Mössbauer signal is generated from beneath the patina. Because BaMS "sees" through surface space-weathering effects to the underlying rock, this technique has great potential for use in robotic missions to other planetary bodies.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1945-5100.1999.tb01366.x

Accretionary microcratered pancake-bearing (AMP) patina, found on 76015 is characterized by the presence of microcraters and glass pancakes (small circular glass splashes) in all size ranges. These microcraters and pancakes are evidence of direct exposure to space, as are solar flare tracks and possible solar wind sputtering erosion. The other two types of patina we recently defined, which were found on mare basalt 75075, include accretionary coalesced (AC) patina, consisting of thin discontinuous layers of glass, and accretionary welded fragmental (AWF) patina, made up of accreted layers of rounded, well-sorted mineral and glass grains. The AC and AWF patinas on 75075 showed no evidence of microcraters, pancakes, or any direct interaction with the solar wind.|

S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference|27||1423|A number of rocks in the lunar sample collection have surface patinas which formed as a result of exposure to the space weathering environment on the surface of the moon. It is important to understand patinas and their relationships to the rocks on which they formed because it is likely that patinas on surface- exposed rocks on the moon and other planetary bodies would affect data obtained by either remote sensing or unmanned landers. We have undertaken a multidisciplinary study of patinas on selected Apollo samples using a wide range of techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), backscattered electron imaging (BEI), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), backscatter Mossbauer spectrometry (BaMS), spectral reflectance spectroscopy, ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) analysis, and wavelength dispersive spectrometry (WDS). SEM/EDX results for patina on high-Ti mare basalt 75075 were reported by McKay et al in LPSC XXVI. Our current focus is on the patina on crystalline matrix breccia 76015. Our initial results show that the 76015 patina is very complex with characteristics that vary widely over a short distance. The 76015 patina is a good example of classic patina with typical lunar surface exposure features such as microcraters and glass pancakes, and is defined here as accretionary microcratered pancake-bearing (AMP) patina.|

S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference|27||661|The surfaces of lunar materials that are exposed to the space environment are modified by a number of processes which alter their chemical and physical characteristics. These surface modifications on lunar rocks result in the formation of patina. The presence of patina obscures the underlying mineralogy and can strongly affect the optical properties of the substrate. Patinas are important in the further exploration of the Moon and other airless bodies in the Solar System because of their effects on remotely-sensed data (both spectral and chemical). We present here the results of a detailed study of a small region of patina on 76015 as part of a consortium study on the nature and effects of space weathering on the lunar surface (see companion abstract Wentworth S. J. et al.).|
1977PhDT.........7D|1977|Constraints on the composition and chemical evolution of the earth's moon|Delano, John Warren|Ph.D. Thesis||||The origin, composition, and evolution of the earth's moon remain controversial topics in the post-Apollo era. In an attempt to provide additional constraints on these complex, multifaceted problems, three topics were investigated. Chapter 2 involves the experimental determination of the melting relations for three rocks (63545; 76055; 76015) from the lunar highlands. The experiments were performed for the purpose of establishing whether any of these compositions could have been derived by partial melting of the lunar interior. The results suggest that none of these rocks are likely to have originated by partial melting of either cosmic or differentiated reservoirs at any depth in the moon. Instead, these samples are probably impact-melts of a multilithologic system in the lunar crust. Chapter 3 mathematically evaluates the possibility of generating the abundances of Sr, Ce, Sm, and Yb in three, highlands noritic rocks (62295; 76015; 15386) by partial melting of cosmic reservoirs. Chapter 4 describes the calculation and melting relations of a refractory, moon composition.|

It is found that many of the complex multiphase structures of the metal particles observed in the study cannot be explained by a continuous two-stage cooling of the impact-melt sheet. It is suggested that at least locally the boulder samples must have experienced multistage cooling and heating.|

Processes which alter the albedo and possibly the chemistry of exposed lunar surfaces are also considered. Measurements are reported of solar flare track gradients in rock 64455 which is sufficiently young to have uneroded surfaces on its sides. Attention is also given to accretionary particles adhering to host surfaces, microcraters on soil particles, and microcraters on the oriented surfaces of sample 76015 from a boulder at Station 6 of the Apollo 17 site.|
