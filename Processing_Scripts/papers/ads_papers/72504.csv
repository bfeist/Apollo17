Of the 40 samples studied, 31 were regolith breccias. Among these, three of the Apollo 14 samples proved to be compositionally unique, particularly the 14315 sample, which is radically different from all other Apollo 14 regolith materials (lower Mg and Fe, far higher Al and far lower REE abundances), and is probably exotic to the Apollo 14 traverse area. Among 10 samples from Apollo 17, all but one proved to be typical Apollo 17 regolith breccia. However, the 72504,10 sample is more than 99 percent pure pyroclastic glass, compositionally identical to the Apollo 17 orange glass obtained at a location 4 km away, attesting to the widespread distribution of orange glass deposits.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB092iB04p0E526
