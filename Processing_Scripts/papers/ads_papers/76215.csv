The geology of this site, on the eastern edge of Mare Serenitatis, was thoroughly investigated during extra vehicular activities performed during three days spent at the surface [1, 2]. A total of 111 kg of well-documented rock and soil samples were collected and brought back to Earth during this last Apollo mission. Among several waypoints of interest, astronauts spent more than one hour to investigate five large boulder fragments at Station 6, lying at the base of a long boulder trail descending from the North Massif. These boulders might originate in material emplaced as a result from the ejected melt sheet from the Crisium impact event [2], or Serenitatis impact event [3, 4]. In a recent study [5], we used scanned photographs taken in situ with astronaut's Hasselblad cameras to reconstruct a 3D model of each of the boulders using photogrammetry techniques [6].In addition to the 3D reconstruction of the boulders themselves reported in [5], we pushed the reconstruction process one step further by taking advantage of the fact that the rock samples hammered from the boulders at Station 6 were thoroughly documented once brought back on Earth in the Lunar Receiving Lab facility in Houston. In particular, several stereoscopic photographic pairs were systematically acquired for a significant number of the samples. When a sufficient number of viewpoints have been acquired, this potentially allows a complete photogrammetric 3D reconstruction of the rocks themselves. We used as input original photographs available on the Lunar and Planetary Institute website (https://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/samples/atlas/). We first performed a color balancing of the scans of these photos. Then, masks corresponding to a detouring of the rocks were applied to avoid errors induced by the fixed background in the photogrammetric project. By manually adding tie points, we were able to compute a detailed textured 3D model of sample 76315 (a micropoikilitic impact melt breccia), sample 76215 (a vesicular micropoikilitic impact melt breccia), and sample 76015 (another vesicular micropoikilitic impact melt breccia, which was chipped off top corner of Block 5 of the big boulder at Station 6). The full reconstruction process is illustrated in Fig. 1 for sample 76215. We have posted the 3D models of these samples on the Sketchfab web platform at https://sketchfab.com/LPG-3D to allow their easy visual inspection. These 3D models are of particular interest as these lunar samples have been broken into multiple pieces after being photographed. The 3D numerical model can therefore be thought as a kind of historical heritage of the original rocks, which do not exist anymore in their original form. Using this reconstruction, we can obtain a copy of the shape of these original rocks using a 3D-Printer (Fig. 2). They can also be viewed using augmented reality, with a cellphone or a tablet, or even manipulated in virtual reality on Sketchfab using a VR headset (Fig 2). From a more scientific point of view, the 3D models theoretically allow to replace the samples in their original position and orientation directly on the 3D models of the original boulders themselves (Fig 3). This is of particular interest to retrieve the precise original orientation of the sample, to investigate for example the characteristics of coatings. On sample 76015, at least three different units show various degree of alteration, which can be correlated with the original position of the sample with respect to its environment. The upper sky-facing side is the most affected by space weathering effects, with a well-developed patina. On its lower edge, a less altered face protected by a crevice might correspond to a lower alteration degree developed during only 20 million years, the approximate age of the impact generating the fall of the boulders from the North Massif slopes according to radiogenic dating.

2017M&PS...52..584T|2017|Impact history of the Apollo 17 landing site revealed by U-Pb SIMS ages|Thiessen, Fiona, Nemchin, Alexander A., Snape, Joshua F., Whitehouse, Martin J., Bellucci, Jeremy J.|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|52|4|584|Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) U-Pb ages of Ca-phosphates from four texturally distinct breccia samples (72255, 76055, 76015, 76215) collected at the Apollo 17 landing site were obtained in an attempt to identify whether they represent a single or several impact event(s). The determined ages, combined with inferences from petrologic relationships, may indicate two or possibly three different impact events at 3920 ± 3 Ma, 3922 ± 5 Ma, and 3930 ± 5 Ma (all errors 2σ). Searching for possible sources of the breccias by calculating the continuous ejecta radii of impact basins and large craters as well as their expected ejecta thicknesses, we conclude that Nectaris, Crisium, Serenitatis, and Imbrium are likely candidates. If the previous interpretation that the micropoikilitic breccias collected at the North Massif represent Serenitatis ejecta is correct, then the average <SUP>207</SUP>Pb/<SUP>206</SUP>Pb age of 3930 ± 5 Ma (2σ) dates the formation of the Serenitatis basin. The occurrence of zircon in the breccias sampled at the South Massif, which contain Ca-phosphates yielding an age of 3922 ± 5 Ma (2σ), may indicate that the breccia originated from within the Procellarum KREEP terrane (PKT) and the Imbrium basin appears to be the only basin that could have sourced them. However, this interpretation implies that all basins suggested to fall stratigraphically between Serenitatis and Imbrium formed within a short (&lt;11 Ma) time interval, highlighting serious contradictions between global stratigraphic constraints, sample interpretation, and chronological data. Alternatively, the slightly older age of the two micropoikilitic breccias may be a result of incomplete resetting of the U-Pb system preserved in some phosphate grains. Based on the currently available data set this possibility cannot be excluded.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maps.12814

These are: Apollo 17 poikilitic melt breccias 72395 and 76215; Apollo 17 aphanitic melt breccias 73215 and 73255; Apollo 14 polymict breccia 14321; and lunar meteorite NWA482, a crystallized impact melt. Plots of Ir versus other HSE define excellent linear correlations, indicating that all data sets likely represent dominantly two-component mixtures of a low-HSE target, presumably endogenous component, and a high-HSE, presumably exogenous component. Linear regressions of these trends yield intercepts that are statistically indistinguishable from zero for all HSE, except for Ru and Pd in two samples. The slopes of the linear regressions are insensitive to target rock contributions of Ru and Pd of the magnitude observed; thus, the trendline slopes approximate the elemental ratios present in the impactor components contributed to these rocks. The <SUP>187</SUP>Os/<SUP>188</SUP>Os and regression-derived elemental ratios for the Apollo 17 aphanitic melt breccias and the lunar meteorite indicate that the impactor components in these samples have close affinities to chondritic meteorites. The HSE in the Apollo 17 aphanitic melt breccias, however, might partially or entirely reflect the HSE characteristics of HSE-rich granulitic breccia clasts that were incorporated in the impact melt at the time of its creation. In this case, the HSE characteristics of these rocks may reflect those of an impactor that predated the impact event that led to the creation of the melt breccias. The impactor components in the Apollo 17 poikilitic melt breccias and in the Apollo 14 breccia have higher <SUP>187</SUP>Os/<SUP>188</SUP>Os, Pt/Ir, and Ru/Ir and lower Os/Ir than most chondrites. These compositions suggest that the impactors they represent were chemically distinct from known chondrite types, and possibly represent a type of primitive material not currently delivered to Earth as meteorites.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2008.04.006

A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2251|Eighteen sections representing five matrix samples - 76015, 76215, 76275, 76295, and 76315 - from the Station 6 boulder were examined with emphasis on the textures and compositions of their native FeNi metal particles. It is found that many of the complex multiphase structures of the metal particles observed in the study cannot be explained by a continuous two-stage cooling of the impact-melt sheet. It is suggested that at least locally the boulder samples must have experienced multistage cooling and heating.|
