Apatite and merrillite have been of particular interest, as they record vital information on the volatile content, U-Pb ages and trace-element composition of various planetary materials. However, the extent to which shock-deformation, pervasive among all planetary materials, affects the distribution of these valuable geochemical tracers is still poorly understood. Here we focus on exploring the U-Pb and Pb-Pb ages of apatite and merrillite in a set of variably shocked lunar rocks, building on previous nanostructural analyses of the phosphates.We carried out U-Pb and Pb-Pb analyses of phosphates in Apollo 17 samples of the Mg-suite rocks (76535, 76335, 76255, 72255, 78235 and 78236) using the CAMECA 1280 ion microprobe at the NordSIMS facility (Stockholm). In addition, we applied a recently developed approach of conducting high-precision U-Pb and Pb-Pb analyses by ID-TIMS of extracted phosphate grains (Jack Satterly Lab, University of Toronto). For this purpose, individual ~50x50x30 µm crystals of apatite and merrillite were extracted directly from thin sections using a Xe+ plasma FIB.As determined by SIMS, 207Pb/206Pb systematics of the unshocked or weakly shocked apatite in 76535 and 76335 is undisturbed, implying cooling of the rock below the closure temperature of Pb diffusion in apatite (~450°C) at ~4.2 Ga, ~100 Ma younger than what is interpreted as the rock's crystallization age. Phosphates that experienced similar levels of deformation but were in proximity or in direct contact with the impact melt in samples 76255 and 72255 show almost complete age resetting (~3.92 Ga). The SIMS determined age of 16 phosphates in sample 76255 is 3922.2 ± 6.7 Ma (2σ) and agrees with the previously published 207Pb/206Pb phosphate ages of impact melt breccias found within the same boulder and was interpreted as the timing of the Imbrium impact. These recrystallized phosphates yield comparable TIMS Pb-Pb ages (3917.8 ± 1.8 Ma and 3921.0 ± 1.3 Ma, 2σ) with significantly lower internal uncertainties than that of the individual SIMS measurements and may represent multiple impact-events close to the Imbrium event.SIMS U-Pb analyses of highly shocked phosphates (78235 and 78236) reveal a discordia line with an upper intercept of ~4.2 Ga and a lower intercept of ~0.5 Ga. We interpret this new, younger age as a minor thermal event that reactivated existing shock-induced nm-scale grain boundaries, as visualised by APT, within the apatite population to allow for Pb-loss at ~0.5 Ga. We propose a small crater located near the Apollo 17 landing site as a possible source of this sample.By correlating micro- to nanostructural characterization with in-situ age systematics we show that apatite and merrillite are powerful thermochronometers that provide a new approach to dating which has the potential to discriminate between temporally similar events. This can greatly aid in unravelling the bombardment record of solar system and be helpful when dealing with samples of limited availability (e.g. space return missions).|http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-1169
2019M&PS...54.1262C|2019|Shock-induced microtextures in lunar apatite and merrillite|Černok, Ana, White, Lee Francis, Darling, James, Dunlop, Joseph, Anand, Mahesh|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|54|6|1262|Apatite and merrillite are the most common phosphate minerals in a wide range of planetary materials and are key accessory phases for in situ age dating, as well as for determination of the volatile abundances and their isotopic composition. Although most lunar and meteoritic samples show at least some evidence of impact metamorphism, relatively little is known about how these two phosphates respond to shock-loading. In this work, we analyzed a set of well-studied lunar highlands samples (Apollo 17 Mg-suite rocks 76535, 76335, 72255, 78235, and 78236), in order of displaying increasing shock deformation stages from S1 to S6. We determined the stage of shock deformation of the rock based on existing plagioclase shock-pressure barometry using optical microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and SEM-based panchromatic cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging of plagioclase. We then inspected the microtexture of apatite and merrillite through an integrated study of Raman spectroscopy, SEM-CL imaging, and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). EBSD analyses revealed that microtextures in apatite and merrillite become progressively more complex and deformed with increasing levels of shock-loading. An early shock-stage fragmentation at S1 and S2 is followed by subgrain formation from S2 onward, showing consistent decrease in subgrain size with increasing level of deformation (up to S5) and finally granularization of grains caused by recrystallization (S6). Starting with 2°-3° of intragrain crystal-plastic deformation in both phosphates at the lowest shock stage, apatite undergoes up to 25° and merrillite up to 30° of crystal-plastic deformation at the highest stage of shock deformation (S5). Merrillite displays lower shock impedance than apatite; hence, it is more deformed at the same level of shock-loading. We suggest that the microtexture of apatite and merrillite visualized by EBSD can be used to evaluate stages of shock deformation and should be taken into account when interpreting in situ geochemically relevant analyses of the phosphates, e.g., age or volatile content, as it has been shown in other accessory minerals that differently shocked domains can yield significantly different ages.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maps.13278

M., Wiesmann, H.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|57|4|915|Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isotopic studies were undertaken of two Apollo 15 breccias, 15445 and 15455, collected near Spur Crater on the Apennine Front. Seven pristine lithic clasts including four norites, one anorthositic norite, one troctolitic anorthosite and one spinel troctolite, as well as a matrix sample of 15445, were analysed. In addition, a K-Ar age determination was also made for a plagioclase separate from a different anorthositic norite clast. Sm-Nd isotopic data of a pristine Mg-norite sample, 15445,17, from the large white Clast B of breccia 15445 yielded a precise internal isochron age of 4.46 ± 0.07 Ga for λ( <SUP>147</SUP>Sm) = 0.00654 Ga<SUP>-1</SUP> and an initial <SUP>143</SUP>Nd /<SUP>144</SUP>Nd of 0.506058 ∓ 0.000078 (normalized to <SUP>148</SUP>Nd /<SUP>144</SUP>Nd = 0.24308) corresponding to an initial ɛ<SUB>Nd</SUB> of +0.71. However, Sm-Nd isotopic results of another Mg-norite sample, 15445,247, chipped from the same Clast B, about 1 cm away from 15445,17, yielded a significantly younger isochron age of 4.28 ± 0.03 Ga and a higher initial <SUP>143</SUP>Nd /<SUP>144</SUP>Nd of 0.506246 ∓ 0.000037 corresponding to an initial ɛ<SUB>Nd</SUB> of -0.35. The Sm-Nd data indicate that Clast B is heterogeneous and contains at least two similar lithologies. The Rb-Sr isotopic systems were severely disturbed for both norites. No useful isochron ages were observed. The Sm-Nd age and ɛ<SUB>Nd</SUB> data for A-15 Mg-norites 15445,17 and 15445,247, A-17 Mgnorite 78236, and two Mg-gabbronorites 73255,27,45 and 67667 are clearly resolved from each other. Four distinct parental magmas are required for derivation of these two major groups of Mg-suite noritic rocks. The Rb-Sr isotopic system of an anorthositic norite clast, 15455,228, was slightly disturbed; and isotopic data defined an isochron age of 4.59 ± 0.13 Ga for λ( <SUP>87</SUP>Rb) = 0.0139 Ga<SUP>-1</SUP> or 4.55 ± 0.13 Ga for λ( <SUP>87</SUP>Rb) = 0.01402 Ga<SUP>-1</SUP>. The corresponding initial <SUP>87</SUP>Sr /<SUP>86</SUP>Sr for the rock is 0.69899 ∓ 0.00006 and is in satisfactory agreement with the LUNI value of NYQUIST et al. (1974). The Sm-Nd system is more disturbed than the Rb-Sr system for this rock. A tie-line between whole-rock samples and a pyroxene separate gives a Sm-Nd age of 4.53 ± 0.29 Ga, which is in nominal agreement with the Rb-Sr isochron age. The <SUP>39</SUP>Ar <SUP>40</SUP>Ar age of a plagioclase separate of the rock has a weighted average value of ~ 3.83 Ga, suggesting that the age was reset by the Imbrium impact event. Probably, the Sm-Nd and Rb-Sr systems of the clast were also partly reset by this event. Our age results indicate that some Mg-suite rocks are as old as ferroan-anorthosite-suite rocks. Furthermore, age data of three major crustal rocks (a Mg suite, a ferroan-anorthosite suite, and an evolved suite) show that they all have variable ages. These observations are difficult to explain by the "magma ocean" hypothesis alone. Petrogenetic processes such as production of Mg-suite rocks by "serial magmatism" ( WALKER, 1983), of ferroan-anorthosite-suite rocks by "multiple diapiric intrusions" ( LONGHI and ASHWAL, 1985), and evolved-suite rocks by "continuous magmatism" ( MEYER et al., 1988, 1989) probably all played a role. These processes seem to be able to accommodate the wide ranges of ages and different origins observed for lunar crustal rocks.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(93)90178-Y
1982LPSC...12...67N|1982|A comparative Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, and K-Ar study of shocked norite 78236: evidence of slow cooling in the lunar crust?|Nyquist, L. E., Reimold, W. U., Bogard, D. D., Wooden, J. L., Bansal, B. M., Wiesmann, H., Shih, C. -Y.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|12||67|The sample 78236 was chipped from the top of a norite boulder at Station 8 by the Apollo 17 landing team. Jackson et al. (1975) concluded that this rock formed at a depth of 8-30 km in the lunar crust and suggested that it was excavated by a large basin-forming impact event. A petrographic description of the boulder is provided, and isotopic analyses are discussed. Attention is given to a chronology for 78236 which seems to be most consistent with radiometric and other evidence. It is proposed that cumulate norite 78236 formed deep in the lunar crust approximately 4.4 AE ago. The rock cooled slowly in the crust until it was excavated by a major basin-forming event. Excavation may have occurred about 4.2 AE ago, but the time of this event is not well constrained.|
