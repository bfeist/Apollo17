2017AJ....153..274H|2017|Isotopic Evidence for Multi-stage Cosmic-ray Exposure Histories of Lunar Meteorites: Long Residence on the Moon and Short Transition to the Earth|Hidaka, Hiroshi, Sakuma, Keisuke, Nishiizumi, Kunihiko, Yoneda, Shigekazu|The Astronomical Journal|153|6|274|It is known that most lunar meteorites have complicated cosmic-ray exposure experiences on the Moon and in space. In this study, cosmic-ray irradiation histories of six lunar meteorites, Dhofar 489, Northwest Africa 032 (NWA 032), NWA 479, NWA 482, NWA 2995, and NWA 5000, were characterized from neutron-captured isotopic shifts of Sm and Gd, and from the abundances of long-lived cosmogenic radionuclides like <SUP>10</SUP>Be, <SUP>26</SUP>Al, <SUP>36</SUP>Cl, and <SUP>41</SUP>Ca. Sm and Gd isotopic data of all of six meteorites show significant isotopic shifts of <SUP>149</SUP>Sm-<SUP>150</SUP>Sm and <SUP>157</SUP>Gd-<SUP>158</SUP>Gd caused by accumulation of neutron capture reactions due to cosmic-ray irradiation, corresponding to the neutron fluences of (1.3-9.6) × 10<SUP>16</SUP> n cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. In particular, very large Sm and Gd isotopic shifts of NWA 482 are over those of a lunar regolith 70002, having the largest isotopic shifts among the Apollo regolith samples, corresponding to cosmic-ray exposure duration over 800 million years in the lunar surface (2π irradiation). Meanwhile, the concentrations of cosmogenic radionuclides for individual six meteorites show the short irradiation time less than one million years as their bodies in space (4π irradiation). Our data also support the results of previous studies, revealing that most of lunar meteorites have long exposure ages at shallow depths on the Moon and short transit times from the Moon to the Earth.|http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/aa7139

W.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1243|Measurements of the cosmogenic radionuclides 22-Na, 26-Al and 53-Mn in the Apollo 17 deep drill string 70002-70009 have shown that this core sample was taken in an area of considerable recent surface activity. Measurements of 22-Na indicate that the core had not been significantly altered during its collection and subsequent handling, while measurements of the 26-Al and 53-Mn showed a very substantial excess in these isotopes in the top 25 cm and a depletion below about 50 cm. The analysis of the data indicates that a crater excavation occurred to a depth of 50 to 60 cm at the site of the deep drill string no longer that 0.5 m.y. ago, and probably 0.3 m.y. ago. Since that time, the crater has filled to a depth of about 25 cm with near-surface material which contains high concentrations of 26-Al and 53-Mn. This recent activity at the site of the Apollo 17 drill string places firm time constraints on the models developed by other investigators which describe the history of this site.|
