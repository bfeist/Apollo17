2009PhDT.......253H|2009|Mineralogy, petrology, and chronology of the lunar granulitic breccias|Hudgins, Jillian Amy|Ph.D. Thesis||||Before the return of the Apollo and Luna samples, many basic geological questions about the Moon remained unanswered. The study of returned samples, in addition to remote sensing data and the growing collection of meteorites has revealed that the Moon is a geologically complex body with a history dominated by impact events. Lunar meteorites provide samples of the crust far removed from the Apollo landing sites and are probably more representative of the average lunar crust. SaU 300 was previously misclassified as an anorthositic regolith breccia. Here, I reclassify it as a polymict crystalline impact-melt breccia with an anorthositic norite bulk composition. SaU 300 is a new meteorite that is unpaired with any of the currently known lunar meteorite samples. The main objective of this study was to gain a better understanding of the early evolution of the Moon by studying some of the oldest samples available: the granulitic breccias. The following samples were studied: Apollo samples 60035, 77017, 78155, and 79215 and paired meteorites NWA 3163/4881/4483. Granulitic breccias exhibit poikiloblastic to granoblastic matrix textures and occur as individual rocks and as fragments in impact-melt rocks, the regolith, and in lunar meteorites. These rocks contain 70 -- 80% anorthite, low concentrations of incompatible trace elements, and moderately high concentrations of siderophile elements. Their history was dominated by impact events and thermal metamorphism. Matrix pyroxenes in the granulitic breccias last equilibrated at ∼1050+/-50°C. 40Ar/39Ar data reveal that 60035, 77017, and 78155 have peak metamorphic ages of 4.1 Ga, while 79215 has a peak metamorphic age of 3.9 Ga. NWA 3163 has a peak metamorphic age of 3.3 Ga. Samples 60035, 77017, and NWA 4881 were partially reset by low temperature heating events following metamorphism. Granulitic breccias have been described as "homogeneous on a millimetre scale" throughout the literature. Although they appear to be compositionally homogeneous under petrographic and electron microscopes EMP analysis shows that they retain relic igneous minor and trace element zoning in their larger mafic mineral clasts. Based on the results of this study, I proposed that granulitic breccias form beneath thick, superheated melt sheets associated with impact basins and that they were heated for 104 -- 106 years.|
2008GeCoA..72.5781H|2008|A laser probe <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar and INAA investigation of four Apollo granulitic breccias|Hudgins, Jillian A., Spray, John G., Kelley, Simon P., Korotev, Randy L., Sherlock, Sarah C.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|72|23|5781|Infrared laser probe <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar geochronology, instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and analytical electron microscopy have been performed on four 0.5 × 1.0 × 0.3 cm polished rock tiles of Apollo 16 and 17 granulitic breccias (60035, 77017, 78155, and 79215). Pyroxene thermometry indicates that these samples were re-equilibrated and underwent peak metamorphic sub-solidus recrystallization at 1000-1100 °C, which resulted in homogeneous mineral compositions and granoblastic textures. <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar data from this study reveal that three samples (60035, 77017, and 78155) have peak metamorphic ages of ∼4.1 Ga. Sample 79215 has a peak metamorphic age of 3.9 Ga, which may be related to Serenitatis basin formation. All four samples contain moderately high concentrations of meteoritic siderophiles. Enhanced siderophile contents in three of the samples provide evidence for projectile contamination of their target lithologies occurring prior to peak metamorphism. Post-peak metamorphism, low-temperature (&lt;300 °C) events caused the partial resetting of argon in the two finer-grained granulites (60035 and 77017). These later events did not alter the mineralogy or texture of the rocks, but caused minor brecciation and the partial release of argon from plagioclase. Interpretation of the low-temperature data indicates partial resetting of the argon systematics to as young as 3.2 Ga for 60035 and 2.3 Ga for 77017. Cosmic ray exposure ages range from 6.4 to ∼339 Ma. Our results increase the amount of high-precision data available for the granulitic breccias and lunar highlands crustal samples. The results demonstrate the survival of pre-Nectarian material on the lunar surface and document the effects of contact metamorphic and impact processes during the pre-Nectarian Epoch, as well as the low-temperature partial resetting of ages by smaller impact events after 3.9 Ga. The mineralogy and chemical composition of these rocks, as well as exhumation constraints, indicate that the source of heat for metamorphism was within kilometers of the surface via burial beneath impact-melt sheets or hot ejecta blankets.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2008.08.024
