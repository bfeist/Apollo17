L., Simon, S., Papike, J. J., Shearer, C. K.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2020||V013-0004|With the opening of Apollo 17 double drive tube 73001/73002 as part of the Apollo Next Generation Sample Analysis (ANGSA) program, we present information about the lithologic makeup of rock components of Station 3 regolith. We report compositions and petrologic classification of 2-4 mm rock fragments (73243) of Station 3 trench soil 73240. The trench was 40 m from the rim of 620 m diameter Lara crater and within its ejecta blanket. The drive tube was collected 10 m SE of the trench and 50 m from Lara's rim. Station 3 was selected for its location on the "light mantle" and contains landslide material from South Massif. Soil samples, including 73001/2, an ~70 cm core, offer the possibility to identify lithologic components associated with the landslide, and perhaps ejecta from Tycho crater, the event thought to have triggered the landslide. <P />Known nonmare rock types at Apollo 17 include impact-melt breccias (IMB) of the poikilitic, aphanitic, and incompatible-element-rich types; (2) granulitic breccias; (3) Mg-suite rocks (dunite, troctolite, anorthosite, norite, gabbro); and (4) regolith and fragmental breccias. Rocks from Station 3 include 73215 and 73235 aphanitic IMBs; 73216 and 73218 crystalline IMBs, 73275 poikilitic IMB, and clast-rich IMBs 73217 and 73255. These groups of IMBs have distinctive petrographic and compositional characteristics. The poikilitic IMBs, more abundant in North Massif samples, are those most commonly interpreted to represent Serenitatis impact melt. The aphanitic and unusual IMBs among the station 3 rocks may come from Serenitatis or from another impact basin such as Imbrium. <P />If ejecta from Tycho struck the top of South Massif and caused the South Massif landslide 110 Myr ago, a glass component in the soil might be the best candidate for a remnant of this material. Such a component would have to record the ~110 Myr age associated with cosmic ray exposure evidence at the Apollo 17 site. Given current knowledge of Apollo 17 compositional and lithologic components, Sta. 3 drive tube 73001/2, collected in the light mantle, may provide the best opportunity for a fresh search for Tycho components and a new test of the hypothesis that Tycho ejecta caused the landslide. Of particular interest will be lithic fragments in 73001/2, which may represent regolith samples from different parts of the South Massif slope.|

These zircon grains preserve deformation microstructures that show a wide range in style and complexity. Planar deformation features (PDFs) are documented in lunar zircon for the first time, and occur along {001}, {110}, and {112}, typically with 0.1-25 μm spacing. The widest PDFs associated with {112} contain microtwin lamellae with 65°/&lt;110&gt; misorientation relationships. Deformation bands parallel to {100} planes and irregular low-angle (&lt;10°) boundaries most commonly have &lt;001&gt; misorientation axes. This geometry is consistent with a dislocation glide system with &lt;100&gt;{010} during dislocation creep. Nonplanar fractures, recrystallized domains with sharp, irregular interfaces, and localized annealing textures along fractures are also observed. No occurrences of reidite were detected. Shock-deformation microstructures in zircon are explained in terms of elastic anisotropy of zircon. PDFs form along a limited number of specific {hkl} planes that are perpendicular to directions of high Young's modulus, suggesting that PDFs are likely to be planes of longitudinal lattice damage. Twinned {112} PDFs also contain directions of high shear modulus. A conceptual model is proposed for the development of different deformation microstructures during an impact event. This “shock-deformation mechanism map” is used to explain the relative timing, conditions, and complexity relationships between impact-related deformation microstructures in zircon.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1945-5100.2011.01316.x

These are: Apollo 17 poikilitic melt breccias 72395 and 76215; Apollo 17 aphanitic melt breccias 73215 and 73255; Apollo 14 polymict breccia 14321; and lunar meteorite NWA482, a crystallized impact melt. Plots of Ir versus other HSE define excellent linear correlations, indicating that all data sets likely represent dominantly two-component mixtures of a low-HSE target, presumably endogenous component, and a high-HSE, presumably exogenous component. Linear regressions of these trends yield intercepts that are statistically indistinguishable from zero for all HSE, except for Ru and Pd in two samples. The slopes of the linear regressions are insensitive to target rock contributions of Ru and Pd of the magnitude observed; thus, the trendline slopes approximate the elemental ratios present in the impactor components contributed to these rocks. The <SUP>187</SUP>Os/<SUP>188</SUP>Os and regression-derived elemental ratios for the Apollo 17 aphanitic melt breccias and the lunar meteorite indicate that the impactor components in these samples have close affinities to chondritic meteorites. The HSE in the Apollo 17 aphanitic melt breccias, however, might partially or entirely reflect the HSE characteristics of HSE-rich granulitic breccia clasts that were incorporated in the impact melt at the time of its creation. In this case, the HSE characteristics of these rocks may reflect those of an impactor that predated the impact event that led to the creation of the melt breccias. The impactor components in the Apollo 17 poikilitic melt breccias and in the Apollo 14 breccia have higher <SUP>187</SUP>Os/<SUP>188</SUP>Os, Pt/Ir, and Ru/Ir and lower Os/Ir than most chondrites. These compositions suggest that the impactors they represent were chemically distinct from known chondrite types, and possibly represent a type of primitive material not currently delivered to Earth as meteorites.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2008.04.006

2001M&PS...36.1257M|2001|Siderophile elements in Earth's upper mantle and lunar breccias: Data synthesis suggests manifestations of the same late influx|Morgan, J. W., Walker, R. J., Brandon, A. D., Horan, M. F.|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|36|9|1257|The platinum group elements (PGE; Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, Pt), Re and Au comprise the highly siderophile elements (HSE). We re-examine selected isotopic and abundance data sets for HSE in upper mantle peridotites to resolve a longstanding dichotomy. Re-Os and Pt-Os isotope systematics, and approximately chondritic proportions of PGE in these rocks suggest the presence in undepleted mantle of a chondrite-like component, which is parsimoniously explained by late influx of large planetisimals after formation of the Earth's core and the Moon. But some suites of xenolithic and orogenic spinel lherzolites, and abyssal peridotites, have a CI-normalized PGE pattern with enhanced Pd that is sometimes termed "non-chondritic". We find that this observation is consistent with other evidence of a late influx of material more closely resembling enstatite, rather than ordinary or carbonaceous, chondrites. Regional variations in HSE patterns may be a consequence of a late influx of very large objects of variable composition. Studies of many ancient (&gt;3.8 Ga) lunar breccias show regional variations in Au/Ir and suggest that "graininess" existed during the early bombardment of the Earth and Moon. Reliable Pd values are available only for Apollo 17 breccias 73215 and 73255, however. Differences in HSE patterns between the aphanitic and anorthositic lithologies in these breccias show fractionation between a refractory group (Re, Os and Ir) and a normal (Pd, Ni, and Au) group and may reflect the compositions of the impacting bodies. Similar fractionation is apparent between the EH and EL chondrites, whose PGE patterns resemble those of the aphanitic and anorthositic lithologies, respectively. The striking resemblance of HSE and chalcogen (S, Se) patterns in the Apollo aphanites and high Pd terrestrial peridotites suggest that the "non-chondritic" abundance ratios in the latter may be reflected in the composition of planetisimals striking the Moon in the first 700 Ma of Earth-Moon history. Most notably, high Pd may be part of a general enhancement of HSE more volatile than Fe suggesting that the Au abundance in at least parts of the upper mantle may be 1.5 to 2 times higher than previously estimated. The early lunar influx may be estimated from observed basin-sized craters. Comparison of relative influx to Earth and Moon suggests that the enrichment of HSE is limited to the upper mantle above 670 km. To infer enrichment of the whole mantle would require several large lunar impacts not yet identified.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1945-5100.2001.tb01959.x

K.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||789|Fifteen siderophile and volatile trace elements (Os, Re, Ir, Pd, Ni, Au, Sb, Ge, Se, Ag, In, Zn, Cd, Bi, Tl) and U were determined by radiochemical neutron activation analysis in a spheroidal aphanitic clast and a clast of coarse-grained anorthositic gabbro from breccia 73215 and in three types of aphanite and two clasts of fine-grained anorthositic gabbro from breccia 73255. In common with most Apollo 17 fragment-laden melt rocks, the aphanites from 73215 and 73255 predominantly contain a Group 2 meteoritic component, which is apparently derived from the Serenitatis impact. All aphanitic lithologies contain the same meteoritic component, and are probably cogenetic. The clasts of fine-grained anorthositic gabbro contain substantial amounts (2% to 6% Cl equivalent based on Au) of a pre-Serenitatis Group 3 component. The clast of coarse-grained anorthositic gabbro is low in siderophile elements (0.4% Cl equivalent), and the meteoritic component (Group 5) is not well-defined. A strong correlation exists between Ir and Au in both the aphanites and the anorthositic gabbro clasts, which argues against the breccias 73215 and 73255 being open systems for Au|

R.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||803|The paper examines analyses of clasts from consortium breccia 73255. It was shown that the basalts are high-alumina, and contain low, unfractionated abundances; the felsite is similar in major element composition and relative REE abundances to the felsites from 73215 and 12013; and the ANT materials are similar to the ANT clasts in other Apollo 17 breccias. Model calculations show that the pyroxene anorhosite has equilibrated with a very evolved liquid, and it is indicated that there was once a liquid with an evolved REE composition which was the parent of the pyroxene anorthosite.|

K., Kirsten, T., Staudacher, T.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2567|The Ar-40-Ar-39 dating of six subsamples of consortium breccia 73215 is reported, and the ages for a total of 17 subsamples are found to range from 3.92 to 4.28 eons. The diversity demonstrates the limited resetting power of basin-forming events. Determination of the age of felsite, an exceptional rock type found as a clast within the breccia, indicates that the date of the breccia-forming event is 3.92 + or - 0.04 eons. If 73215 is consolidated Serenitatis ejecta, then all circular basins must have formed between 3.78 and 3.92 eons; ages determined on most Apollo 17 highland rocks predate this period due to incomplete resetting.|

A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2551|The unique capacity of the laser-probe (Ar-39)-(Ar-40) method to determine ages of constituents in a rock sample which are only of the order of 100 microns apart has been applied to measure ages of the different constituents of consortium breccia 73215. Evidence is given that the age of the melt-derived ground mass, 4.01 + or - 0.05 billion years, has no chronological significance. Instead, the best estimate for the age of the breccia-forming event, about 3.90 billion years, comes from the study of two clasts only a few hundred micrometers in size. The interpretation of this age as the age of the breccia-forming event is also supported by the studies of other consortium members and suggests a reinterpretation of the ages of most of the other Apollo 17 highland breccias.|

Minimum and maximum age estimates for primary crystallization are reported. The nature of the unidentified component that causes some aphanites to show apparent ages of 4.6 eons is considered, and the anomalous age is attributed to volatile loss of Rb at approximately 3.9 eons, the date of crystallization. Clasts of anorthositic gabbro are found to have a Rb-Sr age of approximately 4.25 eons from inprecise internal isochrons, while the model ages are 4.35 eons. It is suggested that if the clasts remained chemically closed during breccia formation, the model ages are older limits to their primary igneous or metamorphic ages.|

G.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1821|It is noted that Apollo 17 grey breccias, as represented by 73235 and 73215, are texturally and compositionally similar mixtures of two clast-rich lithologies: coherent, very fine grained, dark matrix breccia and more porous, light matrix breccia. It is proposed that the breccias under consideration consist of primary Serenitatis ejecta, texturally modified by secondary impact mixing. When applied to a model of the Serenitatis impact event, unshocked clasts are interpreted as samples of the upper 25 km of the lunar crust with the coarser grained, shocked, plagioclase-rich clasts as material excavated from the lower crust.|

A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||707|The origin of the matrix types from the Apollo 17 Station 7 boulder is considered along with the origin of boulder material from Station 2, Boulder 1, and 73215. It is pointed out that the formation of the matrix rocks in this boulder and in the other Apollo 17 boulders in a single impact event is consistent with the isotopic evidence, ages, major-element chemistry, large ion lithophile (LIL) trace-element abundances, and textures. It had been suggested by Winzer et al. (1974), based on calculations from crystal-liquid partition coefficients for LIL trace elements, that target rocks corresponding in trace-element composition to the matrix types could have been produced by partial fusion of rocks similar to 77215. Using the same type of calculation, liquids quite similar in trace-element composition to the Station 7 boulder matrix types can be produced.|

The significance of the 73215 studies is considered and the relationship of 73215 to other Apollo 17 highland breccias is discussed. According to a tentative hypothesis 73215 is an aggregate of fragments plus melt generated in a very large impact, possibly the Serenitatis basin-forming event. If this is correct, studies of this sample will make it possible to date the Serenitatis event and will provide an insight into the breccia-forming processes associated with such events. Studies of the clasts in the breccia will provide an opportunity to formulate a partial characterization of the preimpact source terrain. An investigation of the deep lunar crust might perhaps also be possible.|
