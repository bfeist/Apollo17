1975LPSC....6.1491N|1975|Pb loss from Apollo 17 glassy samples and Apollo 16 revisited.|Nunes, P. D.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1491|U-Th-Pb analyses of bulk samples of soil breccia 70019, when compared to KREEP data, indicate that different lunar samples are sometimes characterized by distinctly different initial Pb isotopic compositions. U-Th-Pb analyses on nonglassy samples and a glassy separate of soil breccia 70019, and bulk and agglutinate samples of soil 72701 showed that the glassy samples did lose considerable Pb relative to U less than 200 million years ago. These data support the contention of other investigators that vaporization of volatile elements owing to impact events significantly alters the chemistry of the lunar regolith. Metaclastic rock 60315 was reanalyzed and was found to be concordant at 3.93 billion years rather than slightly discordant, as was previously reported.|
