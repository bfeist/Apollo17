2022Icar..38815216G|2022|New interpretations of lunar mare basalt flow emplacement from XCT analysis of Apollo samples|Gawronska, Aleksandra J., McLeod, Claire L., Blumenfeld, Erika H., Hanna, Romy D., Zeigler, Ryan A.|Icarus|388||115216|The study of basaltic samples returned half a century ago through the Apollo missions has provided unparalleled insights into the magmatic processes associated with volcanism on planetary bodies. Traditional study of these samples has been conducted in two dimensions (2D) via interrogation of thin sections and subsequent in-situ chemical analyses, yet returned samples are three-dimensional (3D) objects and therefore preserve evidence of lunar volcanic processes in 3D. Here, X-ray computed tomography (XCT) was used for the first time to evaluate lava emplacement mechanisms on the lunar surface. A total of six samples from the Apollo 11, 12, 15, and 17 missions were studied. From volumetric mineralogies, textures, and petrofabrics, lunar lava cooling histories were inferred. Collectively, these physical characteristics were then correlated with pāhoehoe lava flow lobe stratigraphy. Samples 10057 and 15556 are inferred to have crystallized in the lobe crust of their respective lava flow lobes. Samples 12038, 12043, and 70017 may mark the transition between the vesiculated, fine-grained lobe crust, and the dense, coarse-grained lobe core in their respective flows. Finally, coarse-grained, and non-vesiculated sample 15085 is inferred to have crystallized in a lobe core. No statistically significant petrofabric is preserved in any of the samples, indicating that the basalt samples studied here, and the lava flows they originated from, experienced minimal strain during emplacement and solidification on the lunar surface. This is consistent with the low viscosities attributed to lunar mare lavas. Future in-situ sampling of extraterrestrial basaltic products should focus on detailed documentation of, and collection from, stratigraphically well-characterized lava flows to further evaluate the interpretations presented here.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2022.115216
2021AGUFM.P55E1981G|2021|New insights into lunar magmatism: Investigating open system processes in basaltic magma reservoirs on the Moon.|Gawronska, Aleksandra, McLeod, Claire|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2021||P55E-1981|Extensive research on Earth throughout the past several decades has demonstrated the dynamic nature of magmatic storage regions within the crust. Molten material at depth likely exists in the form of crystal mushes, where crystals and liquid coexist (and interact to varying degrees) prior to transport and emplacement. Within this dynamic framework, magmas within a storage reservoir may exist separately from each other and evolve to have distinct compositions through both closed and open system processes. In addition, during recharge, remobilization, and ascent, distinct magma batches may mix and mingle leading to the preservation of phenocrystic, antecrystic, and xenocrystic crystal populations in the magmatic rock record. At present, the occurrence of such processes in magmatic systems on other bodies in our Solar System remains largely unexplored. The research presented here aims to investigate the petrogenetic history of crystal cargoes within Apollo lunar basalts in order to evaluate whether magmatic processes on the Moon operated in open and/or closed systems. Specifically, six Apollo basalts (10057, 12038, 12043, 15085, 15556, 70017) are being investigated using in-situ analytical techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Initial mapping of major elements via SEM energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) has revealed that pyroxenes in all samples are zoned in Mg, Fe, and Ca. The zoning in finer-grained samples (e.g., sample 10057 from Apollo 11) is normal, whereas a transition from Mg- and Fe-rich cores to Fe-poor zones, and finally to Fe-rich rims is preserved in the coarser grained samples (e.g., Apollo 15 sample 15085). Furthermore, several of the samples contain megacrysts (e.g., pyroxene in Apollo 12 sample 12043 and olivine in Apollo 15 sample 15556) that preserve normal zoning with respect to Mg and Fe. Additional SEM-EDS mapping, complemented by quantitative EPMA and LA-ICP-MS analyses, will be utilized in order to 1) evaluate the presence of distinct crystal populations (as determined by morphology, texture, and elemental abundances) and 2) assess the extent to which these populations interacted in open magmatic systems prior to crystallization on the lunar surface.|
2019GeCoA.266..144B|2019|Multiple reservoirs of volatiles in the Moon revealed by the isotopic composition of chlorine in lunar basalts|Barnes, Jessica J., Franchi, Ian A., McCubbin, Francis M., Anand, Mahesh|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|266||144|The isotopes of chlorine (<SUP>37</SUP>Cl and <SUP>35</SUP>Cl) are highly fractionated in lunar samples compared to most other Solar System materials. Recently, the chlorine isotope signatures of lunar rocks have been attributed to large-scale degassing processes that occurred during the existence of a magma ocean. In this study we investigated how well a suite of lunar basalts, most of which have not previously been analyzed, conform to previous models. The Cl isotope compositions (δ<SUP>37</SUP>Cl (‰) = [(<SUP>37</SUP>Cl/<SUP>35</SUP>Cl<SUB>sample</SUB>/<SUP>37</SUP>Cl/<SUP>35</SUP>Cl<SUB>SMOC</SUB>) - 1] × 1000, where SMOC refers to standard mean ocean chloride) recorded range from ∼+7 to +14‰ (Apollo 15), +10 to +19‰ (Apollo 12), +9 to +15‰ (70017), +4 to +8‰ (MIL 05035), and +15 to +22‰ (Kalahari 009). The Cl isotopic data from the present study support the mixing trends previously reported by Boyce et al. (2015) and Barnes et al. (2016), as the Cl isotopic composition of apatites are positively correlated with bulk-rock incompatible trace element abundances in the low-Ti basalts, inclusive of low-Ti and KREEP basalts. This trend has been interpreted as evidence that incompatible trace elements, including Cl, were concentrated in the urKREEP residual liquid of the lunar magma ocean, rather than the mantle cumulates, and that urKREEP Cl had a highly fractionated isotopic composition. The source regions for the basalts were thus created by variable mixing between the mantle (Cl-poor and relatively unfractionated) and urKREEP. The high-Ti basalts show much more variability in measured Cl isotope ratios and scatter around the trend formed by the low-Ti basalts. Most of the data for lunar meteorites also fits the mixing of volatiles in their sources, but Kalahari 009, which is highly depleted in incompatible trace elements, contains apatites with heavily fractionated Cl isotopic compositions. Given that Kalahari 009 is one of the oldest lunar basalts and ought to have been derived from very early-formed mantle cumulates, a heavy Cl isotopic signature is likely not related to its mantle source, but more likely to magmatic or secondary alteration processes, perhaps via impact-driven vapor metasomatism of the lunar crust.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2018.12.032
2018M&PS...53.2138S|2018|Valences of Ti, Cr, and V in Apollo 17 high-Ti and very low-Ti basalts and implications for their formation|Simon, Steven B., Sutton, Stephen R.|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|53|10|2138|To assess the variability of redox states among mare basalt source regions, investigation of the valence of Ti, Cr, and V and the coordination environment of Ti in pyroxene and olivine in lunar rocks via XANES (X-ray absorption near-edge structure) spectroscopy has been extended to Apollo 17 basalts: two high-Ti (70017 and 74275) hand samples, and three very low-Ti (70006,371, 70007,289B, and 70007,296) basalt fragments from the Apollo 17 deep drill core. Valences of Ti in pyroxene of both suites range from 3.6 to 4, or from 40% to 0% Ti<SUP>3+</SUP>, averaging 15-20% Ti<SUP>3+</SUP>. Assuming Ti<SUP>3+</SUP> is more compatible in pyroxene than Ti<SUP>4+</SUP>, then even lower Ti<SUP>3+</SUP> proportions are indicated for the parental melts. The VLT pyroxene exhibits a slightly wider range of V valences (2.57-2.96) than the high-Ti pyroxene (2.65-2.86) and a much wider range of Cr valences (2.32-2.80 versus 2.68-2.86); Cr is generally reduced in VLT pyroxene compared to high-Ti pyroxene. Valences of Ti and Cr in VLT pyroxene become less reduced with increasing FeO contents, possibly indicating change in oxygen fugacity during crystallization. Olivine in all samples has very low (&lt;20%) proportions of Ti<SUP>3+</SUP>, with no Ti<SUP>3+</SUP> and higher proportions of Ti in tetrahedral coordination in the VLTs than in the high-Ti basalts. Olivine in 74275, including that in a dunite clast, has much higher proportions of Cr<SUP>2+</SUP> than the pyroxene in that sample, consistent with previous studies indicating that the olivine grains in this sample are xenocrysts and possibly indicating oxidation just prior to pyroxene crystallization. Results for this sample, the VLTs, and previously studied Apollo 14 and 15 basalts all indicate that mare magmas were in reducing environments at depth, as recorded in early crystallization products, and that later, presumably shallower environments, were relatively oxidizing; single, characteristic fO<SUB>2</SUB>s of formation cannot be assigned to these samples. A process likely to account for this feature seen in multiple samples is loss by degassing of a reducing, H-rich vapor (probably H<SUB>2</SUB>) during ascent and/or eruption, causing oxidation of the residual melt, recorded in relatively late-crystallized pyroxene.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maps.13123

Intimate and linear mixing modeling of these spectra coupled with visible spectra [1] show SO<SUB>2</SUB> is more abundant on the leading side, commensurate with earlier findings [2,3]. Three component modeling was performed on these combined spectra using seven candidate end-members: fine- and medium-grained SO<SUB>2</SUB> frost [4], sulfur, forsterite, fayalite, Allende meteorite, and Apollo lunar soil #70017 [5]. SO<SUB>2</SUB> was present in all viable results. The second most abundant component was alternatively sulfur or fayalite. The third component was present at 0%--20% levels with the most common being fayalite, forsterite, and the Apollo sample. Quantitative estimates of SO<SUB>2</SUB> abundance have varied by 30%--60% depending on whether the estimates were made from UV or IR observations. UV observations have estimated 20% global coverage [4] while IR based estimates range from 85% on the leading and 50% on the trailing side [3]. McEwen et al. (1988) calculated disk-integrated SO<SUB>2</SUB> abundance on Io using both intimate and linear mixing models. The components they chose were SO<SUB>2</SUB> frost and hypothetical constituents based on component analysis of the Voyager color data set. Both our intimate and linear mixing model results estimate 25% +/- 8% SO<SUB>2</SUB> on the trailing side, on the low end of the range estimated from the Voyager data analysis [6]. While the SO<SUB>2</SUB> abundance on the leading side varies more with longitude, ranging from 37% +/- 16% at 15(deg) --45(deg) longitude and 60% +/- 16% at 135(deg) --165(deg) longitude, well above previous mixing model estimates based on IUE, 4.08-mm, and Voyager data sets [6].

The samples were irradiated in the thermal column of a heavy water reactor; after irradiation, the muscovite sheets and polycarbonate foils were removed and etched in 40 percent HF at 25 C for 20 min and in 6 N NaOH at 70 C for 10 min. The U-concentration in basaltic fragments range from 3.0 ppb to 43.4 ppb, and in pyroxene from 0.95 ppb to 15 ppb. The pyroxene data show a tendency to decreasing U-concentration with increasing crystal size. The U-microdistribution pattern of rock fragments shows that U is mainly concentrated in intergranular material. The higher the silicon content, the higher the U-content. This is due to the residual liquid being preferentially isolated in the final stage of crystallization, and being highly enriched in U.|

The sample was identified as a Type B of A-17 basalts with a texture of plagioclase-poikilitic ilmenite basalt. The mean chemical composition was SiO2 39.01, TiO2 11.32, Al2O3 9.24, FeO 18.52, MgO 8.61, and CaO 10.86. Additional microprobe measurements of seven Apollo 17 pyroxene grains revealed the presence of pigeonite and augite-subcalicaugite. The plagioclase grains contained detectable Fe, K, and Ti, while the ilmenite composition was analyzed as TiO2 53.98, FeO 41.02, AlO3 0.21, MgO 2.41, and Cr2O3 0.74. The high Ti-content basalts were concluded to have formed by partial melting of early cumulates through assimilation and migmatization, basically multigenetic processes.|

X-ray microprobe analyses of whole rock and major minerals confirm that the 70017-291 sample is a medium-grained, high-Ti mare basalt, similar to those collected by the Apollo-11 mission. Chemically, this mare basalt is characterized by its higher contents of TiO2 and FeO. Electronprobe analysis gives (weight percent) pyroxene, 51.64; plagioclase, 25.69; ilmenite 21.43; olivine less than 1 and mesostasis. The sample exhibits a texture of plagioclase-ilmenite poikilitic basalt. According to Sm content, 70017-291 belongs to Type B of A-17 basalt.|

Silicate glass fragments were noticed as impact ejecta adhering to the surface of glassy sphere. Metallic grains are enclosed by silicate glassy materials and exhibit fluidal structure. This indicates that mare basalts were subjected to repeated meteoritic impact. It is suggested that the lunar crystalline rock sample that was investigated was probably collected from the soil near the landing site of Apollo-17. Some microfractures and undulatory extinction have been observed within pyroxene grains under microscope and plastic deformation noticed in plagioclase. So, there are some signs of impact metamorphism in the mare basalt.|

L.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1489|Three Apollo 17 basalts were studied by the laser Ar-39-Ar-40 method. The 70215 basalt has a normal well-behaved Ar-39-Ar-40 release pattern; the 70017 basalt has a disturbed release pattern which indicates a limited intermediate maximum age followed by a broad low-age region; and the 75035 basalt has a pattern initially similar to 70017 that is followed by a high-temperature maximum age. The laser study shows that all mineral systems in 70215 have small and uniform temperature losses, while the laser-determined ages for 70017 and 75035 are, apparently, primarily controlled by the minerals containing mesostasis inclusions. It is possible that the drop in ages observed by the conventional Ar-39-Ar-40 method was due not only to recoil of Ar-39 during neutron irradiation but also to gas loss from some minerals. It is suggested that the plagioclases are the best minerals to use for a reliable age.|

The plagioclase data do not seem to lie on this line. The data for 70017 appear to plot along a distinctly different chord in a concordia diagram than do the data for 75055 and 75035, two other Apollo 17 mare basalts. The lead data are in accord with Sm-Nd results. A 3.7 eon crystallization age for 70017 would be consistent with the same kind of parentless lead that is indicated by previous studies of soils and soil breccias from stations at Taurus-Littrow. The Th/U ratio in ilmenite is 2.2, and the concentrations of these two elements are approximately twice those in pyroxene.|
