V.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2237|An investigation was conducted of the composition of lunar highlands samples rich in mafics. Most of the samples were Apollo 16 rocks. The compositional data for 13 lunar rocks are listed in a table. The nonpristine rocks 64815 and 77545 having essentially identical KREEP contents of about 32% have very similar, high contents of the mafic component SCCRV. The same amounts of rather similar ingredients were mixed at locations 1000 km apart. The composition of SCCRV is discussed. According to the three most plausible hypotheses for the origin of SCCRV which are proposed the SCCRV is primordial material, SCCRV consists entirely or mainly of a single type of lunar rock, or SCCRV resulted from the mixing of two or more lunar materials.|
