L., Simon, S., Papike, J. J., Shearer, C. K.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2020||V013-0004|With the opening of Apollo 17 double drive tube 73001/73002 as part of the Apollo Next Generation Sample Analysis (ANGSA) program, we present information about the lithologic makeup of rock components of Station 3 regolith. We report compositions and petrologic classification of 2-4 mm rock fragments (73243) of Station 3 trench soil 73240. The trench was 40 m from the rim of 620 m diameter Lara crater and within its ejecta blanket. The drive tube was collected 10 m SE of the trench and 50 m from Lara's rim. Station 3 was selected for its location on the "light mantle" and contains landslide material from South Massif. Soil samples, including 73001/2, an ~70 cm core, offer the possibility to identify lithologic components associated with the landslide, and perhaps ejecta from Tycho crater, the event thought to have triggered the landslide. <P />Known nonmare rock types at Apollo 17 include impact-melt breccias (IMB) of the poikilitic, aphanitic, and incompatible-element-rich types; (2) granulitic breccias; (3) Mg-suite rocks (dunite, troctolite, anorthosite, norite, gabbro); and (4) regolith and fragmental breccias. Rocks from Station 3 include 73215 and 73235 aphanitic IMBs; 73216 and 73218 crystalline IMBs, 73275 poikilitic IMB, and clast-rich IMBs 73217 and 73255. These groups of IMBs have distinctive petrographic and compositional characteristics. The poikilitic IMBs, more abundant in North Massif samples, are those most commonly interpreted to represent Serenitatis impact melt. The aphanitic and unusual IMBs among the station 3 rocks may come from Serenitatis or from another impact basin such as Imbrium. <P />If ejecta from Tycho struck the top of South Massif and caused the South Massif landslide 110 Myr ago, a glass component in the soil might be the best candidate for a remnant of this material. Such a component would have to record the ~110 Myr age associated with cosmic ray exposure evidence at the Apollo 17 site. Given current knowledge of Apollo 17 compositional and lithologic components, Sta. 3 drive tube 73001/2, collected in the light mantle, may provide the best opportunity for a fresh search for Tycho components and a new test of the hypothesis that Tycho ejecta caused the landslide. Of particular interest will be lithic fragments in 73001/2, which may represent regolith samples from different parts of the South Massif slope.|
2020AGUFMDI0190012P|2020|Can the Late Heavy Bombardment hypothesis be resuscitated?|Parisi, A. F., Harrison, T. M., Mercer, C. M., Hodges, K. V.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2020||DI019-0012|The concept of a Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) of Moon at ~3.9 Ga, based on geochemical arguments, was initially controversial but became widely accepted when <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/<SUP>39</SUP>Ar step-heating analyses of Apollo samples appeared to yield ~3.9 Ga "plateau" ages. Recently, application of the "plateau age" model for dating complex impact melt rocks (not the simpler mineral systems for which the model was developed) has attracted criticism [1]. For impact melt rocks, degassing artifacts and the variation of Argon diffusivity in constituent phases frustrate attempts to extract robust impact age estimates from conventional <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/<SUP>39</SUP>Ar incremental heating data alone. While it has been argued that highly clustered ages from multiple isotopic methods on individual lunar rocks provide confidence that interpreted impact ages are meaningful [2], the actual data backing up this assertion are sparse. <P />We are attempting to rectify this through SIMS U-Th-Pb dating of neoformed zircon, apatite, and merrillite in well-documented lunar melt rocks 77115 and 73217, previously found to contain three discrete melt domains ranging from 3.8 to 3.3 Ga by <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/<SUP>39</SUP>Ar laserprobe dating [3]. Replication of the existing <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/<SUP>39</SUP>Ar laserprobe ages would provide the first evidence that multiple isotopic systems can yield concordant ages of lunar melt rocks and increase our confidence in interpreted impact ages. But even so, a multichronometric analytical campaign conducted on many samples would be required to confirm the LHB hypothesis. Such efforts would be complicated by the fact that not all lunar melt rocks are likely to contain accessory minerals appropriate for such studies. Their presence depends on both the thermal state and chemistry of the melt. Most lunar rocks outside the Procellarum KREEP terrane are not capable of crystallizing accessory phases large enough for in situ chronologic investigation because high levels of P and Zr needed to stabilize magmatic phosphates and zircon. This imposes an inherent bias in using them to establish global impact chronologies. Nonetheless, it should be possible to constrain the ages of large, nearside, basin-forming impacts. <P />[1] Boehnke &amp; Harrison (2016) PNAS 113, 10802; [2] Bottke &amp; Norman (2017), AREPS 45, 619; [3] Mercer et al.

2017PhDT.......143M|2017|High Spatial Resolution 40Ar/39Ar Geochronology of Lunar Impact Melt Rocks|Mercer, Cameron Mark|Ph.D. Thesis||||Impact cratering has played a key role in the evolution of the solid surfaces of Solar System bodies. While much of Earth’s impact record has been erased, its Moon preserves an extensive history of bombardment. Quantifying the timing of lunar impact events is crucial to understanding how impacts have shaped the evolution of early Earth, and provides the basis for estimating the ages of other cratered surfaces in the Solar System. Many lunar impact melt rocks are complex mixtures of glassy and crystalline “melt” materials and inherited clasts of pre-impact minerals and rocks. If analyzed in bulk, these samples can yield complicated incremental release 40Ar/39Ar spectra, making it challenging to uniquely interpret impact ages. Here, I have used a combination of high-spatial resolution 40Ar/39Ar geochronology and thermal-kinetic modeling to gain new insights into the impact histories recorded by such lunar samples. To compare my data to those of previous studies, I developed a software tool to account for differences in the decay, isotopic, and monitor age parameters used for different published 40Ar/39Ar datasets. Using an ultraviolet laser ablation microprobe (UVLAMP) system I selectively dated melt and clast components of impact melt rocks collected during the Apollo 16 and 17 missions. UVLAMP 40Ar/39Ar data for samples 77135, 60315, 61015, and 63355 show evidence of open-system behavior, and provide new insights into how to interpret some complexities of published incremental heating 40Ar/39Ar spectra. Samples 77115, 63525, 63549, and 65015 have relatively simple thermal histories, and UVLAMP 40Ar/39Ar data for the melt components of these rocks indicate the timing of impact events—spanning hundreds of millions of years—that influenced the Apollo 16 and 17 sites. My modeling and UVLAMP 40Ar/39Ar data for sample 73217 indicate that some impact melt rocks can quantitatively retain evidence for multiple melt-producing impact events, and imply that such polygenetic rocks should be regarded as high-value sampling opportunities during future exploration missions to cratered planetary surfaces. Collectively, my results complement previous incremental heating 40Ar/39Ar studies, and support interpretations that the Moon experienced a prolonged period of heavy bombardment early in its history.|

2009GeCoA..73.3093G|2009|Thermal history recorded by the Apollo 17 impact melt breccia 73217|Grange, M. L., Nemchin, A. A., Pidgeon, R. T., Timms, N., Muhling, J. R., Kennedy, A. K.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|73|10|3093|Lunar breccia 73217 is composed of plagioclase and pyroxene clasts originating from a single gabbronorite intrusion, mixed with a silica-rich glass interpreted to represent an impact melt. A study of accessory minerals in a thin section from this breccia (73217,52) identified three different types of zircon and anhedral grains of apatite which represent distinct generations of accessory phases and provide a unique opportunity to investigate the thermal history of the sample. Equant, anhedral zircon grains that probably formed in the gabbronorite, referred to as type-1, have consistent U-Pb ages of 4332 ± 7 Ma. A similar age of 4335 ± 5 Ma was obtained from acicular zircon (type-2) grains interpreted to have formed from impact melt. A polycrystalline zircon aggregate (type-3) occurs as a rim around a baddeleyite grain and has a much younger age of 3929 ± 10 Ma, similar to the 3936 ± 17 Ma age of apatite grains found in the thin section. A combined apatite-type-3 zircon age of 3934 ± 12 Ma is proposed as the age of the Serenitatis impact event and associated thermal pulse. X-ray mapping and electron probe analyses showed that Ti is inhomogeneous in the zircon grains on the sub-micrometer scale. However, model temperatures estimated from SHRIMP analyses of Ti-concentration in the 10 μm diameter spots on the polished surfaces of type-1 and type-2 zircons range between about 1300 and 900 °C respectively, whereas Ti-concentrations determined for the type-3 zircon are higher at about 1400-1500 °C. A combination of U-Pb ages, Ti-concentration data and detailed imaging and petrographic studies of the zircon grains shows that the gabbronorite parent of the zircon clasts formed shortly before the 4335 ± 5 Ma impact, which mixed the clasts and the felsic melt and projected the sample closer to the surface where fast cooling resulted in the crystallization of acicular zircon (type-2). The 3934 ± 12 Ma Serenitatis event resulted in partial remelting of the glass and formation of polycrystalline zircon (type-3). This event also reset the U-Pb system of apatite, formed merrillite coronas around some apatite grains, and probably re-equilibrated some pyroxenes in the clasts. Although there have been arguments for pre-3.9 Ga impacts based on other types of samples, the age of the acicular zircon at 4335 ± 5 Ma provides the first evidence of impact melt significantly predating the lunar cataclysm. Our data, combined with other chronological results, demonstrate the occurrence of pre-3.9 Ga impacts on the Moon and suggest that the lunar impact history consisted of a series of intense bombardment episodes interspersed with relatively calm periods of low impact flux.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2009.02.032

S., Meyer, C.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|89||B525|U-Pb age determinations on four lunar zircons from existing thin-sections of one highland breccia, 73217, using the recently constructed ion microprobe SHRIMP, are reported. The analytical reproducibility of SHRIMP is demonstrated, and procedures for measuring Pb/U, Th/U, and corecting for initial Pb are explained. Electron microprobe analyses for the zircons are also are reported. The results show that the four zircons survived the lunar cataclysm without any identifiable effects on their U-Pb systematics. All four indicate a single age of 4356 +23 or -14 m.y. The zircons have experienced small variable amounts of Pb loss since crystallization, from almost zero up to about 10 percent. If this occurred during one later event, then age of the latter is between 1100 and 2300 m.y.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB089iS02p0B525
