L., Simon, S., Papike, J. J., Shearer, C. K.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2020||V013-0004|With the opening of Apollo 17 double drive tube 73001/73002 as part of the Apollo Next Generation Sample Analysis (ANGSA) program, we present information about the lithologic makeup of rock components of Station 3 regolith. We report compositions and petrologic classification of 2-4 mm rock fragments (73243) of Station 3 trench soil 73240. The trench was 40 m from the rim of 620 m diameter Lara crater and within its ejecta blanket. The drive tube was collected 10 m SE of the trench and 50 m from Lara's rim. Station 3 was selected for its location on the "light mantle" and contains landslide material from South Massif. Soil samples, including 73001/2, an ~70 cm core, offer the possibility to identify lithologic components associated with the landslide, and perhaps ejecta from Tycho crater, the event thought to have triggered the landslide. <P />Known nonmare rock types at Apollo 17 include impact-melt breccias (IMB) of the poikilitic, aphanitic, and incompatible-element-rich types; (2) granulitic breccias; (3) Mg-suite rocks (dunite, troctolite, anorthosite, norite, gabbro); and (4) regolith and fragmental breccias. Rocks from Station 3 include 73215 and 73235 aphanitic IMBs; 73216 and 73218 crystalline IMBs, 73275 poikilitic IMB, and clast-rich IMBs 73217 and 73255. These groups of IMBs have distinctive petrographic and compositional characteristics. The poikilitic IMBs, more abundant in North Massif samples, are those most commonly interpreted to represent Serenitatis impact melt. The aphanitic and unusual IMBs among the station 3 rocks may come from Serenitatis or from another impact basin such as Imbrium. <P />If ejecta from Tycho struck the top of South Massif and caused the South Massif landslide 110 Myr ago, a glass component in the soil might be the best candidate for a remnant of this material. Such a component would have to record the ~110 Myr age associated with cosmic ray exposure evidence at the Apollo 17 site. Given current knowledge of Apollo 17 compositional and lithologic components, Sta. 3 drive tube 73001/2, collected in the light mantle, may provide the best opportunity for a fresh search for Tycho components and a new test of the hypothesis that Tycho ejecta caused the landslide. Of particular interest will be lithic fragments in 73001/2, which may represent regolith samples from different parts of the South Massif slope.|
2014GeCoA.131...62S|2014|Characterization of the dominant impactor signature for Apollo 17 impact melt rocks|Sharp, Miriam, Gerasimenko, Iva, Loudin, Lorne C., Liu, Jingao, James, Odette B., Puchtel, Igor S., Walker, Richard J.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|131||62|Concentrations of the highly siderophile elements (HSE) Re, Os, Ir, Ru, Pt, and Pd and <SUP>187</SUP>Os/<SUP>188</SUP>Os isotopic compositions are reported for seven Apollo 17 impact melt rocks. These data are used to examine the dominant chemical signature of the impactor that formed the melts. Six of the samples (72355, 72435, 72535, 76035, 76055, and 76135) have poikilitic textures; one sample (73235) has an aphanitic texture. Data for the samples define linear correlations when Ir is plotted versus other HSE concentrations, with y-intercepts indistinguishable from zero for most HSE in most rocks. Scatter about some of the trends, and occasional trends with positive y-intercepts, indicate either mixing of additional components that are heterogeneously distributed within several rocks, or modest fractionation of some HSE by volatilization, crystal fractionation, or other processes, during formation and evolution of the melt sheet. There is no statistical difference between the aphanitic and poikilitic samples in terms of HSE ratios after visible granulitic clasts were removed from aphanite 73235. Hence, earlier speculations that the two types of impact melt rocks at this site may have been generated by different impactors are not supported by our data. <P />Most Apollo 17 samples examined here and in prior studies are characterized by very similar HSE signatures, consistent with a common impactor. These samples are characterized by elevated Ru/Ir, Pd/Ir, and Re/Os, relative to most chondrites. Collectively, the data indicate that the impactor was characterized by the following HSE ratios (2σ): Re/Ir 0.093 ± 0.020, Os/Ir 1.03 ± 0.28, Ru/Ir 1.87 ± 0.30, Pt/Ir 2.36 ± 0.31, Pd/Ir 1.85 ± 0.41, and present-day <SUP>187</SUP>Os/<SUP>188</SUP>Os of 0.1322 ± 0.0013. The results most likely mean that the impactor was a body with a bulk composition that was just outside the range of meteoritic compositions currently sampled on Earth.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2014.01.014

These zircon grains preserve deformation microstructures that show a wide range in style and complexity. Planar deformation features (PDFs) are documented in lunar zircon for the first time, and occur along {001}, {110}, and {112}, typically with 0.1-25 μm spacing. The widest PDFs associated with {112} contain microtwin lamellae with 65°/&lt;110&gt; misorientation relationships. Deformation bands parallel to {100} planes and irregular low-angle (&lt;10°) boundaries most commonly have &lt;001&gt; misorientation axes. This geometry is consistent with a dislocation glide system with &lt;100&gt;{010} during dislocation creep. Nonplanar fractures, recrystallized domains with sharp, irregular interfaces, and localized annealing textures along fractures are also observed. No occurrences of reidite were detected. Shock-deformation microstructures in zircon are explained in terms of elastic anisotropy of zircon. PDFs form along a limited number of specific {hkl} planes that are perpendicular to directions of high Young's modulus, suggesting that PDFs are likely to be planes of longitudinal lattice damage. Twinned {112} PDFs also contain directions of high shear modulus. A conceptual model is proposed for the development of different deformation microstructures during an impact event. This “shock-deformation mechanism map” is used to explain the relative timing, conditions, and complexity relationships between impact-related deformation microstructures in zircon.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1945-5100.2011.01316.x

2011GeCoA..75.2213G|2011|Complex magmatic and impact history prior to 4.1 Ga recorded in zircon from Apollo 17 South Massif aphanitic breccia 73235|Grange, M. L., Nemchin, A. A., Timms, N., Pidgeon, R. T., Meyer, C.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|75|8|2213|Sample 73235 is one of several aphanitic impact melt breccias collected by the Apollo 17 mission at stations 2 and 3 on the slopes of the South Massif. This study presents a detailed investigation of internal structures and U-Pb ages of large zircon grains from this breccia sample. New data combined with the results of previous studies of zircon grains from the same location indicate that most zircon clasts in breccias from stations 2 and 3 formed during multiple magmatic events between 4.37 and 4.31 Ga, although the oldest zircon crystallized at about 4.42 Ga and the youngest at 4.21 Ga. In addition, zircons from the aphanitic breccias record several impact events prior to the ∼3.9 Ga Late Heavy Bombardment. The results indicate that the zircons probably crystallized at different locations within the Procellarum KREEEP Terrane and were later excavated and modified by several impacts and delivered to the same locality within separate ejecta blankets. This locality became a source of material that formed the aphanitic impact melt breccias of the South Massif during a ∼3.9 Ga impact. However, the zircons, showing old impact features, are not modified by this ∼3.9 Ga impact event suggesting that (i) this common source area was located at the periphery of excavation cavity, and (ii) the &gt; 3.9 Ga ages recorded by the zircon grains could date large (basin-forming) events as significant as major later (∼3.9 Ga) collisions such as Imbrium and Serenitatis.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2011.01.036

G.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1821|It is noted that Apollo 17 grey breccias, as represented by 73235 and 73215, are texturally and compositionally similar mixtures of two clast-rich lithologies: coherent, very fine grained, dark matrix breccia and more porous, light matrix breccia. It is proposed that the breccias under consideration consist of primary Serenitatis ejecta, texturally modified by secondary impact mixing. When applied to a model of the Serenitatis impact event, unshocked clasts are interpreted as samples of the upper 25 km of the lunar crust with the coarser grained, shocked, plagioclase-rich clasts as material excavated from the lower crust.|
1975LPSC....6.1593P|1975|<SUP>40</SUP>Ar-<SUP>39</SUP>Ar dating of Apollo 16 and 17 rocks.|Phinney, D., Kahl, S. B., Reynolds, J. H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1593|The reported study is a continuation of an investigation begun by Alexander and Kahl (1974), with primary emphasis on (Ar-40)-(Ar-39) dating of lunar breccias. A primary objective of the study was related to the resolution of small plateau-age differences between Apollo 16 and 17 samples which have been irradiated in the same irradiation. This objective was not realized because (1) neither of the considered Apollo 16 samples has a well-defined plateau, and (2) the release patterns of the two Apollo 17 samples with plateaux (73235 and 77017) are sufficiently complex to suggest caution in interpretation of fine-scale differences among apparent ages. The plateau age of 73235 agrees well with plateau ages measured for a nearby boulder at the South Massif. The plateau age of 77017, on the other hand, agrees well with plateau ages measured in an nearby boulder at the base of the North Massif. These rock and boulder ages are tightly clustered about 3.99 b.y., and this clustering suggests that the North and South Massifs were made in the same basin-forming event, presumably Serenitatis.|
