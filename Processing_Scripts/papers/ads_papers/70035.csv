2018AGUFM.P13B..03N|2018|A New View of Apollo 17 Basaltic Samples|Neal, C. R.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2018||P13B-03|The Apollo 17 high-Ti basalts were originally classified into types on the basis of whole rock data. Initial types were A, B, C, and U. Type U represented unclassified basalts or those of uncertain affiliation. Four different types of volcanic glass have been described from the Apollo 17 sample collection based on color and composition: VLT, Green, Yellow, and Orange. There are three subdivisions of the orange glasses, based upon major elements. <P />An elemental database of analyses from the Apollo 17 basaltic samples (i.e., both glasses and crystalline basalts) has been compiled in an attempt to re-examine the origins of the crystalline basalts and glasses. This study also highlights those samples where more data are required to properly classify them. The database was used to create results for elements that are common to both basalts and glasses. The "Unclassified" Type U samples were examined on several plots (e.g., La vs. La/Sm, Fig. 1) and assigned to Types A, B1, B2, C, and D depending on their affinities. Where multiple analyses were reported for these samples, averages were taken and data were only omitted if the analysis was clearly different from the others that have been reported. Remarkably, only 4 samples (70035, 74235, 75035, 78579) did not plot consistently with the designated groups from Figure 1 and require more sophisticated analyses (larger sample mas needs to be homogenized). <P />The data show the following: <P />- Type B1 and B2 high-Ti basalts are distinct; <P />- Two new Type D basalts are defined (71597 and 78508 in addition to 79001); <P />- Type A, B1 and C basalts fall on the same trends, as do Types B2 and D; <P />- Orange glass groups are distinct from high-Ti mare basalts; <P />- VLT glasses are similar in composition to the average VLT basalt compositions. <P />Ratios of REE and HFSE elements demonstrate that these basaltic materials are derived from distinct sources. This can also be extended to the transition elements, but these can also be used to demonstrate that the crystalline basalt and glass groups are highly fractionated. The data from the Apollo 17 basaltic samples has allowed us to demonstrate mantle heterogeneity beneath Taurus Littrow. However, the magmas produced from these sources underwent similar evolutionary pathways.|
2016M&PS...51.1555P|2016|Characterization of mesostasis regions in lunar basalts: Understanding late-stage melt evolution and its influence on apatite formation|Potts, Nicola J., TartèSe, Romain, Anand, Mahesh, Westrenen, Wim, Griffiths, Alexandra A., Barrett, Thomas J., Franchi, Ian A.|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|51|9|1555|Recent studies geared toward understanding the volatile abundances of the lunar interior have focused on the volatile-bearing accessory mineral apatite. Translating measurements of volatile abundances in lunar apatite into the volatile inventory of the silicate melts from which they crystallized, and ultimately of the mantle source regions of lunar magmas, however, has proved more difficult than initially thought. In this contribution, we report a detailed characterization of mesostasis regions in four Apollo mare basalts (10044, 12064, 15058, and 70035) in order to ascertain the compositions of the melts from which apatite crystallized. The texture, modal mineralogy, and reconstructed bulk composition of these mesostasis regions vary greatly within and between samples. There is no clear relationship between bulk-rock basaltic composition and that of bulk-mesostasis regions, indicating that bulk-rock composition may have little influence on mesostasis compositions. The development of individual melt pockets, combined with the occurrence of silicate liquid immiscibility, exerts greater control on the composition and texture of mesostasis regions. In general, the reconstructed late-stage lunar melts have roughly andesitic to dacitic compositions with low alkali contents, displaying much higher SiO<SUB>2</SUB> abundances than the bulk compositions of their host magmatic rocks. Relevant partition coefficients for apatite-melt volatile partitioning under lunar conditions should, therefore, be derived from experiments conducted using intermediate compositions instead of compositions representing mare basalts.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maps.12681

V., Keller, L. P., Mckay, D. S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference|||531|The Carbotek/Shimizu process to produce oxygen from lunar soils has been successfully demonstrated on actual lunar samples in laboratory facilities at Carbotek with Shimizu funding and support. Apollo sample 70035 containing approximately 25 percent ilmenite (FeTiO3) was used in seven separate reactions with hydrogen varying temperature and pressure: FeTiO3 + H2 yields Fe + TiO2 + H2O. The experiments gave extremely encouraging results as all ilmenite was reduced in every experiment. The lunar ilmenite was found to be about twice as reactive as terrestrial ilmenite samples. Analytical techniques of the lunar and terrestrial ilmenite experiments performed by NASA Johnson Space Center include iron Mossbauer spectroscopy (FeMS), optical microscopy, SEM, TEM, and XRD. The Energy and Environmental Research Center at the University of North Dakota performed three SEM techniques (point count method, morphology determination, elemental mapping), XRD, and optical microscopy.|

S.|Geology of the Apollo 17 Landing Site|||1|The first set of hydrogen reduction experiments to use actual lunar material was recently completed. The sample, 70035, is a coarse-grained vesicular basalt containing 18.46 wt. percent FeO and 12.97 wt. percent TiO2. The mineralogy includes pyroxene, ilmenite, plagioclase, and minor olivine. The sample was crushed to a grain size of less than 500 microns. The crushed basalt was reduced with hydrogen in seven tests at temperatures of 900-1050 C and pressures of 1-10 atm for 30-60 minutes. A capacitance probe, measuring the dew point of the gas stream, was used to follow reaction progress. Experiments were also conducted using a terrestrial basalt similar to some lunar mare samples. Minnesota Lunar Simulant (MLS-1) contains 13.29 wt. percent FeO, 2.96 wt. percent Fe2O3, and 6.56 wt. percent TiO2. The major minerals include plagioclase, pyroxene, olivine, ilmenite, and magnetite. The rock was ground and seived, and experiments were run on the less than 74- and 500-1168-micron fractions. Experiments were also conducted on less than 74-micron powders of olivine, pyroxene, synthetic ilmenite, and TiO2. The terrestrial rock and mineral samples were reduced with flowing hydrogen at 1100 C in a microbalance furnace, with reaction progress monitored by weight loss. Experiments were run at atmospheric pressure for durations of 3-4 hr. Solid samples from both sets of experiments were analyzed by Mossbauer spectroscopy, petrographic microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, tunneling electron microscopy, and x-ray diffraction. Apollo 17 soil 78221 was examined for evidence of natural reduction in the lunar environment. This sample was chosen based on its high maturity level (I<SUB>s/FeO</SUB> = 93.0). The FeO content is 11.68 wt. percent and the TiO2 content is 3.84 wt. percent. A polished thin section of the 90-150 micron size fraction was analyzed by petrographic microscopy and scanning electron microscopy.|
1971E&PSL..12...36P|1971|Rb sbnd Sr ages of igneous rocks from the Apollo 14 mission and the age of the Fra Mauro formation|Papanastassiou, D. A., Wasserburg, G. J.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|12|1|36|Internal Rb-Sr isochrons were determined on four basaltic rocks and on a basaltic clast from a breccia from the Fra Mauro landing site. Rocks 14310, 14073 and 14001,7,3 yield essentially identical ages T = 3.88 ± 0.04 AE and identical high initial <SUP>87</SUP>Sr/ <SUP>86</SUP>Sr, I = 0.70035 ± 4. Rock 14053 and the clast from breccia 14321 both yield a higher age T = 3.95 ± 0.04 AE and a distinctly lower I = 0.69945 ± 4. Model ages relative to BABI for these rocks range from 4.3 to 4.6 AE. Model ages were determined for soil samples 14141, 14149, 14163, 14259 yielding T<SUB>BABI</SUB> of 4.4, 4.5, 4.5 and 4.7 AE respectively. An internal isochron was determined for 12004 and yielded (3.29 ± 0.07 AE, 0.69948 ± 5) in agreement with our previous results for basaltic rocks from the Apollo 12 site. The crystallization ages for Apollo 14 basalts are only 0.2 to 0.3 AE older than were found for mare basalts from the Sea of Tranquillity. Assuming these leucocratic igneous rocks to be representative of the Fra Mauro site, it follows that there were major igneous processes active in these regions, and presumably throughout the highlands, at times only slightly preceding the periods at which the maria were last flooded. If the breccias represent the Fra Mauro formation and if this is the result of excavation of the Imbrium Basin, we must conclude that a major bombardment of the earth-moon system continued to take place at least as late as 3.9 AE or about 0.7 AE after the formation of the solar system. Such a late major bombardment could remove the need for internal heat sources to explain some mare lava flows. Some of the lunar differentiation processes could possibly represent the result of collisional melting of a thin outer layer. This late bombardment requires that planetary objects ∼ 100 km in size must be stored in unstable orbits with lifetimes of 10 <SUP>8</SUP> yr or more.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(71)90052-5
