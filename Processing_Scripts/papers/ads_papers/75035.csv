However, the geometry of the lunar magnetic field is still largely unknown because the original orientations of essentially all Apollo samples have not been well-constrained. Determining the direction of the lunar magnetic field over time could elucidate the mechanism by which the lunar dynamo was powered and whether the Moon experienced true polar wander. Here we present measurements of the lunar magnetic field 3.7 billion years ago as recorded by Apollo 17 mare basalts 75035 and 75055. We find that 75035 and 75055 record a mean paleointensity of 50 T. Furthermore, we could infer from 75055 and the layering of its parent boulder that the inclination of the magnetic field at the time was 34 11. Lunar paleodirectional data enables a test of whether the Moon's dynamo was described by an equivalent selenocentric axial dipole (SAD) relationship and to assess the implications for the dynamo mechanism and the possibility of true polar wander. Our recovered inclination is consistent with a SAD field geometry: a dipole in the center of the Moon and aligned along the spin axis.|

2018AGUFM.P13B..03N|2018|A New View of Apollo 17 Basaltic Samples|Neal, C. R.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2018||P13B-03|The Apollo 17 high-Ti basalts were originally classified into types on the basis of whole rock data. Initial types were A, B, C, and U. Type U represented unclassified basalts or those of uncertain affiliation. Four different types of volcanic glass have been described from the Apollo 17 sample collection based on color and composition: VLT, Green, Yellow, and Orange. There are three subdivisions of the orange glasses, based upon major elements. <P />An elemental database of analyses from the Apollo 17 basaltic samples (i.e., both glasses and crystalline basalts) has been compiled in an attempt to re-examine the origins of the crystalline basalts and glasses. This study also highlights those samples where more data are required to properly classify them. The database was used to create results for elements that are common to both basalts and glasses. The "Unclassified" Type U samples were examined on several plots (e.g., La vs. La/Sm, Fig. 1) and assigned to Types A, B1, B2, C, and D depending on their affinities. Where multiple analyses were reported for these samples, averages were taken and data were only omitted if the analysis was clearly different from the others that have been reported. Remarkably, only 4 samples (70035, 74235, 75035, 78579) did not plot consistently with the designated groups from Figure 1 and require more sophisticated analyses (larger sample mas needs to be homogenized). <P />The data show the following: <P />- Type B1 and B2 high-Ti basalts are distinct; <P />- Two new Type D basalts are defined (71597 and 78508 in addition to 79001); <P />- Type A, B1 and C basalts fall on the same trends, as do Types B2 and D; <P />- Orange glass groups are distinct from high-Ti mare basalts; <P />- VLT glasses are similar in composition to the average VLT basalt compositions. <P />Ratios of REE and HFSE elements demonstrate that these basaltic materials are derived from distinct sources. This can also be extended to the transition elements, but these can also be used to demonstrate that the crystalline basalt and glass groups are highly fractionated. The data from the Apollo 17 basaltic samples has allowed us to demonstrate mantle heterogeneity beneath Taurus Littrow. However, the magmas produced from these sources underwent similar evolutionary pathways.|

F.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|3||2547|The paper deals with an extensive series of shock-recovery experiments performed on both nonporous crystalline basalt and its granulated and sieved counterpart to study the role of porosity and grain size in shock motomorphic effects under otherwise identical conditions. Shocked samples are compared with unshocked starting material in terms of textural and mineralogical modifications attributable to shock. A comparative petrographic and chemical characterization is presented of pulverized and sieved lunar basalt 75035 shocked between 6 and 75 GPa in comparison with holocrystalline disks of the same basalts shocked in 10 earlier experiments. Specifically, a petrographic classification of shock features is given, along with an estimation of relative amounts of shock glasses and a chemical characterization of shock glasses in each shocked granular basalt.|

L.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1489|Three Apollo 17 basalts were studied by the laser Ar-39-Ar-40 method. The 70215 basalt has a normal well-behaved Ar-39-Ar-40 release pattern; the 70017 basalt has a disturbed release pattern which indicates a limited intermediate maximum age followed by a broad low-age region; and the 75035 basalt has a pattern initially similar to 70017 that is followed by a high-temperature maximum age. The laser study shows that all mineral systems in 70215 have small and uniform temperature losses, while the laser-determined ages for 70017 and 75035 are, apparently, primarily controlled by the minerals containing mesostasis inclusions. It is possible that the drop in ages observed by the conventional Ar-39-Ar-40 method was due not only to recoil of Ar-39 during neutron irradiation but also to gas loss from some minerals. It is suggested that the plagioclases are the best minerals to use for a reliable age.|

H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1473|Uranium, thorium, and isotopic lead data for components of basalt 70017 are reported, and it is found that the whole rock, pyroxene, and ilmenite points in a concordia diagram plot along a chord intersecting the curve at 3.7 and 4.33 eons. The plagioclase data do not seem to lie on this line. The data for 70017 appear to plot along a distinctly different chord in a concordia diagram than do the data for 75055 and 75035, two other Apollo 17 mare basalts. The lead data are in accord with Sm-Nd results. A 3.7 eon crystallization age for 70017 would be consistent with the same kind of parentless lead that is indicated by previous studies of soils and soil breccias from stations at Taurus-Littrow. The Th/U ratio in ilmenite is 2.2, and the concentrations of these two elements are approximately twice those in pyroxene.|

H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1509|Ar-40-Ar-39 age determinations for some Apollo 16 and 17 highland rocks are reported, and the chronology of lunar highland samples is discussed. While basalt 75035 is found to have an age of 3.77 b.y., the argon release patterns from two plagioclase separates of 75035 both show high-temperature increases in apparent age to 3.85 b.y., for unknown reasons. Two models of the chronology are examined. One model assumes that the ages are dominated by basin-forming events; the alternative model, in which the chronology is dominated by cratering events of subbasin size, may be used to determine cratering as a function of time close to 4.0 b.y. The association of the ages of the Apollo 17 massif rocks with the Serenitatis event restricts the basin chronology within very narrow limits, regardless of model.|

Z.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||707|Rock 75035 is a medium-grained, holocrystalline, subophitic ilmenite basalt collected from the rim of Camelot Crater, and is believed to represent the subfloor basalts of the Taurus-Littrow valley. The rock consists of the major minerals pyroxene (45%), plagioclase (31%), and ilmenite (17%). Minor minerals include cristobalite (about 5%), troilite, native Fe, tranquillityite, baddeleyite, zirconolite, and rare ulvospinel. No olivine or armalcolite was observed in the specimen 75035,76. Mineralogically and chemically, as well as in age, this rock is similar to others collected from Camelot and other stations during the Apollo 17 mission. These rocks are almost identical to the Type B ilmenite basalts of Mare Tranquillitatis.|
