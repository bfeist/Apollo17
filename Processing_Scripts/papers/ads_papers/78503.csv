A., Husain, L.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1541|The lunar anorthositic rocks 60025,86 and 60015,22 give Ar-40/Ar-39 ages of about 4.19 and 3.50 b.y., respectively. Two coarse fine anorthositic rock fragments 78503,7,1 and 72503,8,12 have ages of 4.13 and 3.96 b.y., respectively. The rock 60025 is the first large lunar rock with an age well in excess of 4.0 b.y. Evidence for the conclusion that the cratering events reset the radiometric ages is discussed. The chronology of the lunar basin forming events is deduced from the ages of the lunar highland impact breccias. Using the ages of lunar breccias, we have deduced a chronology for the last five lunar basin forming events. It is concluded that the 'lunar cataclysm' is the Imbrium event.|
