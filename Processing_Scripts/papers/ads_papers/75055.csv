However, the geometry of the lunar magnetic field is still largely unknown because the original orientations of essentially all Apollo samples have not been well-constrained. Determining the direction of the lunar magnetic field over time could elucidate the mechanism by which the lunar dynamo was powered and whether the Moon experienced true polar wander. Here we present measurements of the lunar magnetic field 3.7 billion years ago as recorded by Apollo 17 mare basalts 75035 and 75055. We find that 75035 and 75055 record a mean paleointensity of 50 T. Furthermore, we could infer from 75055 and the layering of its parent boulder that the inclination of the magnetic field at the time was 34 11. Lunar paleodirectional data enables a test of whether the Moon's dynamo was described by an equivalent selenocentric axial dipole (SAD) relationship and to assess the implications for the dynamo mechanism and the possibility of true polar wander. Our recovered inclination is consistent with a SAD field geometry: a dipole in the center of the Moon and aligned along the spin axis.|

2018AGUFM.P13B..05N|2018|The Paleoinclination and Paleointensity of the Early Lunar Dynamo|Nichols, C. I. O., Getzin, B. L., Weiss, B. P., Wells, R., Schmitt, H. H.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2018||P13B-05|Paleomagnetic studies of lunar samples collected during the Apollo missions suggest the Moon generated a core dynamo for at least 2 billion years. The early lunar dynamo (4.25 - 3.56 Ga) was intense, recording paleointensities of 20 - 110 µT. The lunar dynamo field subsequently declined to 5 ± 2 µT at 2.5 - 1 Ga. The strength and longevity of this dynamo field is challenging to explain via a single mechanism. Thermal convection could not have driven a dynamo for such a sustained period of time, whilst thermochemical convection during core solidification is unlikely to have started so early. <P />There is also debate surrounding the dipolar nature of the lunar magnetic field. A recent study of lunar crustal magnetization inferred paleopoles oriented with both the rotation axis and the equator. Providing a robust constraint on the direction of the lunar magnetic field over time is essential for establishing: (a) the mechanism by which the lunar dynamo was driven, (b) whether the magnetic field underwent reversals, and (c) whether the Moon experienced true polar wander. <P />Here we present new results for the paleoinclination and paleointensity of the lunar magnetic field recorded 3.8 Ga by Apollo samples 75055 and 75075, respectively. These samples were collected during the Apollo 17 mission at Camelot crater. They were sampled from boulders which are thought to represent an overturned flap formed during impact cratering or else nearly in-place subfloor basalts exposed by recent mass-wasting. <P />At the latitude of the Camelot crater (20.19 °N), a dipolar field aligned along the rotation axis would have had a paleoinclination of 36.3°. Using alternating field demagnetization techniques on a 2G SQUID magnetometer in the MIT Paleomagnetism Laboratory, sample 75055 returned a paleoinclination of 38.6 ± 13.5° suggesting the Moon had a dipolar, dynamo-generated field that was stable for extended periods of time. <P />Preliminary results from sample 75075, which was analysed using the same methods, suggest this sample experienced a very weak magnetic field (0 ± 2 μT), despite acquiring remanence during the high intensity epoch. This supports a recent theoretical proposal that the early lunar dynamo may have been intermittently weak during the period before 3.56 Ga due to a lack of sufficient energy for continuously driving a high intensity magnetic field.|

H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1473|Uranium, thorium, and isotopic lead data for components of basalt 70017 are reported, and it is found that the whole rock, pyroxene, and ilmenite points in a concordia diagram plot along a chord intersecting the curve at 3.7 and 4.33 eons. The plagioclase data do not seem to lie on this line. The data for 70017 appear to plot along a distinctly different chord in a concordia diagram than do the data for 75055 and 75035, two other Apollo 17 mare basalts. The lead data are in accord with Sm-Nd results. A 3.7 eon crystallization age for 70017 would be consistent with the same kind of parentless lead that is indicated by previous studies of soils and soil breccias from stations at Taurus-Littrow. The Th/U ratio in ilmenite is 2.2, and the concentrations of these two elements are approximately twice those in pyroxene.|

The gas retention age of 75055 raises the lower limit for the time of formation of all lunar basins.

The formation of these basins during a timespan of only about 0.2 × 10 <SUP>9</SUP> yr is consistent with the very rapid decrease of the flux of crater-forming projectiles that collided with the Moon about 4.0 × 10 <SUP>9</SUP> yr ago. According to Hartman and Wood this could be due to a catastrophic event in the Earth-Moon system at that time.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(73)90149-0
