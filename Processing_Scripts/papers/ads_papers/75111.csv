K.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2020||V013-0002|The Apollo Next Generation Sample Analysis (ANGSA) initiative involves the study of previously unopened or uniquely processed lunar samples returned by Apollo missions. Among these samples is the Apollo 17 double drive tube 73001/73002, collected at Station 3 in the landslide deposit ("light mantle", LM) at the base of South Massif. <P />Grain mounts from 73001/73002 are not yet available but to improve our understanding of its geologic context and the geology of the Apollo 17 site we studied four surface soils collected during lunar roving vehicle (LRV) traverses. Two (72141 and 74121, from stations LRV-2 and LRV-6, resp.) are from the LM and two (72150 and 75111, from LRV-3 and LRV-7, resp.) are from the mare floor immediately adjacent to the LM. A polished grain mount of the 90-150 µm fraction of each soil was studied with a scanning electron microscope and electron probe. Until now only modal, maturity, and bulk chemical data were available for these samples. <P />We found that 72141 surprisingly lacks the Mg-rich, Ca-poor pyroxenes found in the other soils considered here. Most of the plagioclase grains in the LM soils are more calcic than An<SUB>89</SUB> and are probably derived from highland rocks. Both LM soils have olivine more forsteritic than Fo<SUB>90</SUB>, suggesting a troctolitic source. One grain of pink spinel was found in 74121, also indicative of a plutonic component. Pink spinel lithologies have also been found at other locations in the LM (Stations 2 and 3). The pyroxene populations in the valley floor soils extend to more Fe-rich compositions than those from the LM, owing to their larger mare basalt components, and are comparable to that of Sculptured Hills soil 78221. The minimum highland fraction of pyroxene, on the basis of quadrilateral components, is very low in all soils studied. Orange glass beads with compositions indistinguishable from that of 74220 were found in all samples except 74121. <P />In addition to the glasses and monomineralic grains the samples contain fragments of high-Ti mare basalts and various non-mare lithologies such as recrystallized noritic breccias, crystalline matrix breccias, and feldspathic plutonic rocks. The lithic fragment populations are typical of Apollo 17 regolith. These samples and those from the Station 3 trench will provide a valuable basis for comparison with the new samples from the 73001/73002 drive tube.|

P., Baker, D. M. H.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2018||P23E-3500|Observations of the Taurus-Littrow Valley by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M<SUP>3</SUP>) instrument have enabled new interpretations of the geology of the Apollo 17 landing site. A recent investigation by Schmitt et al. [2017] characterized a debris deposit located at the base of the North Massif and at the expression of an apparent fissure that transects the massif. The main debris deposit is 50 meters thick and is 2 x 2 km across. A more extensive debris apron extending to the South covers an area including Victory Crater, and may be a source of samples 75111 and 75121 (LRV-8). Additionally, 75121 and 75111 may have an enhanced KREEP component (Th and U) by 5x relative to Shorty crater ash and basalt samples, but lower than North Massif melt by 5x, consistent with the addition of Mg-rich material. Mini-RF and Diviner data from LRO suggests that the deposit is block-free within the upper 1 m. Using data from M<SUP>3</SUP> we have characterized the composition of this deposit, identifying it as unique compared to other areas of the valley floor or massifs. On the basis of the 1 and 2 µm pyroxene absorption bands, the deposits composition is Mg-rich compared to the basalts in Taurus-Littrow and is unlike the mafic materials in the Sculptured Hills [Schmitt et al., 2017]. It is unclear how much of this deposit may have been sampled at Victory Crater. Korotev and Kremser [1992] identify a Mg-enhancement in soils from Camelot Crater and conclude that the soils contain "an unidentified magnesian lithology or… primitive basalt different from typical high-Ti mare basalt." We conclude that the debris deposit at the base of the North Massif represents the source of this enhancement and is a late-stage volcanic deposit from the fissure. Based on M<SUP>3</SUP> data this material is compositionally similar in composition to a high-Mg volcanic unit within the South Pole-Aitken Basin [Moriarty and Pieters, 2018]. <P />References: <P />Korotev, R.

R.|New Views of the Moon 2: Understanding the Moon Through the Integration of Diverse Datasets|||12|Lunar pyroclastic deposits represent a style of volcanism different from that responsible for the flood basalts that fill the mare basins. As volatile-coated, primitive materials originating deep (about 400 km) within the Moon, these products of explosive volcanic eruptions are also important as probes of mantle composition and as a potential resource for future settlers. While many of the lunar pyroclastic deposits are spatially restricted and relatively small in size, they are easily resolvable at the spatial scale (about 100 m/pixel) of the Clementine UV-VIS camera. Recent studies confirm previous results indicating that these deposits are not compositionally uniform, and suggest that further analyses can help to identify possible genetic relationships among lunar pyroclastic deposits, characterize their juvenile components, and clarify their relationships to nearby maria. Among the juvenile materials from sampled lunar pyroclastic deposits are the orange glass and devitrified black beads found in the Taurus-Littrow Valley and the green glass found by Apollo 15. Recent studies suggest that deposits dominated by materials such as these may represent end members in the observed compositional variations among the lunar pyroclastic deposits. Here we present preliminary results of analyses focused on the use of the Clementine UV-VIS data for characterizing the composition and distribution of juvenile pyroclastic materials. Our test case for detailed mapping of a lunar pyroclastic deposit is that of the Apollo 17 landing site in the Taurus-Littrow (TL) Valley. Although black beads dominate the observed spectral reflectance at this site, sample data show that the pyroclastic eruption changed character, producing first orange glass and then black beads. To assess the compositional variability of this deposit, especially our ability to distinguish the orange glasses, we apply techniques based on spectral mixture analysis to detect materials at subpixel scales. The low albedo and subdued absorption features of the Taurus-Littrow deposit make this a challenging task. In recent years, several subpixel detection techniques have been developed for use with terrestrial airborne imaging spectrometer data. A technique that is functionally equivalent to spectral mixture analysis, the orthogonal subspace projection (OSP) technique is used for the simulations presented here. In OSP, a target spectrum is projected onto a subspace that is orthogonal to a set of background spectra. In this process, the response from the background spectra are nulled and that of the target is maximized. For the TL site, the spectra used for the simulation included three laboratory-measured sample spectra convolved to the five UV/VIS bandpasses, and two spectra extracted from UV-VIS data over the TL Valley. The target spectrum was the orange soil sample 74220 from the Shorty Crater rim. "Background" spectra were from samples 74221 (a gray soil found near the orange soil) and 75111 (a dark mare soil). From the UV/VIS data, additional background spectra were obtained at the mare/highland interface and from the "crater cluster" area in the TL Valley. In the simulation, the background spectra were randomly mixed in each of 100 samples with 0.1% Gaussian noise added. For samples 20,40, 60, and 80, the orange soil target was added in abundances of 90, 80, 60, and 40%. The 100-sample set was then reduced via OSP. For this example, the orange soil was detectable only at the 90 and 80% abundance levels. It was found that the addition of higher noise levels (about 1%), made the orange glass undetectable even at the 90% level. However, using background materials more representative of the highlands made the orange soil detectable at lower abundances. These results suggest that we should be able to map the distribution of juvenile pyroclastic materials, such as the orange glasses, using the Clementine UV-VIS data and subpixel analysis techniques such as spectral mixture analysis and foreground background analysis. Given the low albedo of these materials, a high fill factor will be required on a per pixel basis in order to achieve that mapping; however, observations made by others, including orbital observations by the Apollo 17 astronauts, have indicated that these abundances are met for several pyroclastic deposits. The production of such maps will help to constrain the dynamics of pyroclastic eruptions on the Moon by providing information on die type, relative quantity, and distribution of juvenile volcanic materials.
