1996M&PS...31..116J|1996|Lithologic distribution and geologic history of the Apollo 17 site: The record in soils and small rock particles from the highland massifs|Jolliff, Bradley L., Rockow, Kaylynn M., Korotev, Randy L., Haskin, Larry A.|Meteoritics and Planetary Science|31|1|116|Through analysis by instrumental neutron activation (INAA) of 789 individual lithic fragments from the 2 mm-4 mm grain-size fractions of five Apollo 17 soil samples (72443, 72503, 73243, 76283, and 76503) and petrographic examination of a subset, we have determined the diversity and proportions of rock types recorded within soils from the highland massifs. The distribution of rock types at the site, as recorded by lithic fragments in the soils, is an alternative to the distribution inferred from the limited number of large rock samples. The compositions and proportions of 2 mm-4 mm fragments provide a bridge between compositions of &lt;1 mm fines, and types and proportions of rocks observed in large collected breccias and their clasts. The 2 mm-4 mm fraction of soil from South Massif, represented by an unbiased set of lithic fragments from station-2 samples 72443 and 72503, consists of 71% noritic impact-melt breccia, 7% incompatible-trace-element-(ITE)-poor highland rock types (mainly granulitic breccias), 19% agglutinates and regolith breccias, 1% high-Ti mare basalt, and 2% others (very-low-Ti (VLT) basalt, monzogabbro breccia, and metal). In contrast, the 2 mm-4 mm fraction of a soil from the North Massif, represented by an unbiased set of lithic fragments from station-6 sample 76503, has a greater proportion of ITE-poor highland rock types and mare-basalt fragments: it consists of 29% ITE-poor highland rock types (mainly granulitic breccias and troctolitic anorthosite), 25% impact-melt breccia, 13% high-Ti mare basalt, 31% agglutinates and regolith breccias, 1% orange glass and related breccia, and 1% others. Based on a comparison of mass-weighted mean compositions of the lithic fragments with compositions of soil fines from all Apollo 17 highland stations, differences between the station-2 and station-6 samples are representative of differences between available samples from the two massifs. <P />From the distribution of different rock types and their compositions, we conclude the following: (1) North-Massif and South-Massif soil samples differ significantly in types and proportions of ITE-poor highland components and ITE-rich impact-melt-breccia components. These differences reflect crudely layered massifs and known local geology. The greater percentage of impact-melt breccia in the South-Massif light-mantle soil stems from derivation of the light mantle from the top of the massif, which apparently is richer in noritic impact-melt breccia than are lower parts of the massifs. (2) At station 2, the 2 mm-4 mm grain-size fraction is enriched in impact-melt breccias compared to the &lt;1 mm fraction, suggesting that the &lt;1 mm fraction within the light mantle has a greater proportion of lithologies such as granulitic breccias which are more prevalent lower in the massifs and which we infer to be older (pre-basin) highland components. (3) Soil from station 6, North Massif, contains magnesian troctolitic anorthosite, which is a component that is rare in station-2 South-Massif soils. (4) Compositional differences between poikilitic impact-melt breccias from the two massifs suggest broad-scale heterogeneity in impact-melt breccia interpreted by most investigators to be ejecta from the Serenitatis basin. <P />We have found rock types not previously recognized or uncommon at the Apollo 17 site. These include (1) ITE-rich impact-melt breccias that are compositionally distinct from previously recognized "aphanitic" and "poikilitic" groups at Apollo 17; (2) regolith breccias that are free of mare components and poor in impact melt of the types associated with the main melt-breccia groups, and that, if those groups derive from the Serenitatis impact, may represent the pre-Serenitatis surface; (3) several VLT basalts, including an unusual very-high-K basaltic breccia; (4) orange-glass regolith breccias; (5) aphanitic-matrix melt breccias at station 6; (6) fragments of alkali-rich composition, including alkali anorthosite, and monzogabbro; (7) one fragment of 72275-type KREEP basalt from station 3; (8) seven lithic fragments of ferroan-anorthositic-suite rocks; and (9) a fragment of metal, possibly from an L chondrite. Some of these lithologies have been found only as lithic fragments in the soils and not among the large rock samples. In contrast, we have not found among the 2 mm-4 mm lithic fragments individual samples of certain lithologies that have been recognized as clasts in breccias (e.g., dunite and spinel troctolite). <P />The diversity of lithologic information contained in the lithic fragments of these soils nearly equals that found among large rock samples, and most information bearing on petrographic relationships is maintained, even in such small samples. Given a small number of large samples for "petrologic ground truth," small lithic fragments contained in soil "scoop" samples can provide the basis for interpreting the diversity of rock types and their proportions in remotely sensed geologic units. They should be considered essential targets for future automated sample-analysis and sample-return missions.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1945-5100.1996.tb02061.x

M., Wiesmann, H.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|108|4|203|Sm-Nd and Rb-Sr mineral isochrons were determined for an Apollo 17 KREEP (pigeonite) basalt clast (,543) from breccia 72275 collected from Boulder 1, Station 2 in the Valley of Taurus-Littrow. Sm-Nd analyses of the basalt yield a precise mineral isochron age of 4.08 ± 0.07 Ga for λ( <SUP>147</SUP>Sm= 0.00654 Ga <SUP>-1</SUP>. The Rb-Sr mineral isochron age of 4.13 ± 0.08 Ga for λ( <SUP>87</SUP>Rb) = 0.0139 Ga <SUP>-1</SUP> is concordant with the Sm-Nd age. However, the Rb-Sr isotopic system has been slightly disturbed, probably by the Serenitatis impact event ∼ 3.95 Ga ago. The Sm-Nd age is interpreted as the crystallization age of this Apollo 17 KREEP basalt. Ages and initial <SUP>87</SUP>Sr/ <SUP>86</SUP>Sr and ɛ <SUB>Nd</SUB> values for this basalt and Apollo 14 and 15 KREEP basalts suggest that these two types of KREEP basalts could be produced from sources having similar Rb/Sr and Sm/Nd ratios. These new age data suggest that KREEP basaltic volcanism started ∼ 200 Ma earlier than the ∼ 3.85 Ga age generally accepted from studies of Apollo 15 pristine KREEP basalts. Apollo 17 KREEP basalts probably pre-date the Serenitatis impact, strongly indicating that not all KREEP basaltic volcanism was necessarily related to basin-forming impacts. The younger Apollo 15 and 14 KREEP basalts probably are related to the Imbrium impact, however. The ages and ɛ <SUB>Nd</SUB> values for KREEP basalts, granites, troctolites and norites from a variety of lunar sites form a linear array corresponding to source(s) with Sm/Nd lower by ∼ 15% than the chondritic value (slightly enriched in LREE), suggesting that these rocks could be genetically related. Formation of a common Sm-Nd isotopic growth curve by these data is most easily explained by an early moon-wide differentiation accompanying the formation and subsequent solidification of a global magma ocean.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(92)90023-O

A.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|18||11|A suite of Apollo 17 feldspathic highland clasts from polymict breccia 72275 have been studied. The clasts include six granulites and a rare Apollo 17 ferroan anorthosite. This anorthosite possesses elevated incompatible trace element compositions, as does the only other possible sample so far described from the site. The paper discusses three possibilities regarding the petrogenesis of Apollo 17 ferroan anorthosites.|

These basalts occur as discrete clasts and as clasts enclosed within basaltic microbreccias. Mineral and whole-rock chemical analyses reveal that the microbreccias are compositionally indistinguishable from the basalt clasts. Samples of the 72275 matrix also have the same compositions as the basalts and the basaltic microbreccias. 72275 was assembled in situ from a single flow or series of closely related flows of Apollo 17 KREEPy basalt before it was transported to the Apollo 17 site. As a rock type, Apollo 17 KREEPy basalts are distinct from Apollo 15 KREEP basalts. The Apollo 17 samples have lower REE concentrations, steeper negative slopes of the HREE, and are less magnesian than the Apollo 15 samples. The two basalt types cannot be related by fractional crystallization, partial melting, or assimilation. This is evidence for the compositional nonuniformity of KREEP as a function of geography.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB092iB04p0E340
1977E&PSL..35....1R|1977|Apollo 17 KREEPy basalt: A rock type intermediate between mare and KREEP basalts|Ryder, G., Stoeser, D. B., Wood, J. A.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|35|1|1|The Apollo 17 KREEPy basalt is a unique lunar volcanic rock, observed only as clasts in the light friable breccia matrix (72275) of Boulder 1, Station 2 at Taurus-Littrow. Its status as a volcanic rock is confirmed by the absence of any meteoritic contamination, a lack of cognate inclusions or xenocrystal material, and low Ni contents in metal grains. The basalt was extruded 4.01 ± 0.04 b.y. ago, approximately contemporaneously with the high-alumina mare basalts at Fra Mauro; shortly afterwards it was disrupted, probably by the Serenitatis impact, and its fragments emplaced in the South Massif. The basalt, which is quartz-normative and aluminous, is chemically and mineralogically intermediate between the Apollo 15 KREEP basalts and the high-alumina mare basalts in most respects. It consists mainly of plagioclase and pigeonitic pyroxene in approximately equal amounts, and 10-30% of mesostatis. Minor phases outside of the mesostatis are chromite, a silica mineral, Fe-metal, and rare olivine; the mesostatis consists primarily of ilmenite, Fe-metal, troilite, and ferroaugite, set in a glassy or microcrystalline Si-rich base. Chemical and isotopic data indicate that an origin by partial melting of a distinct source region is more probable than hybridization or contamination of magmas, and is responsible for the transitional composition of the basalt. The moon did not produce two completely distinct volcanic groups, the KREEP basalts and the mare/mare-like basalts; some intermediate rock types were generated as well. A corresponding spectrum of source regions must exist in the interior of the moon.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(77)90021-8

K., Swits, G.|Moon|14|3-4|473|The average directions of natural remanent magnetization (NRM) of three texturally distinct layers (72215, 72255, and 72275) of a 2 m-sized breccia boulder were found to be the same, while the directions of their stable components of NRM were found to be widely divergent. One clast from 72275 yielded a stable NRM direction which was different from that of the matrix. Approximate paleointensity measurements showed that 72255 and 72275 could have obtained their stable remanence from an ancient magnetic field of the same magnitude. However, 72215 probably was magnetized by a magnetic field of a different intensity. We concluded that the coincident NRM directions owe their origin to a secondary imprint of less stable magnetization imparted during the assembly of the boulder at moderate temperatures (∼ 450°C) on the South Massif. The stable directions, on the other hand, date from the last, higher-temperature (∼ 770°C) magnetizing event experienced by the mineral and lithic components while they were part of the immature pre-Serenitatis regolith.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00569677

W., Jr.|Moon|14|3-4|385|Correlations among the trace and minor element pairs Cl and Br, Cl and P<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB>, and Ru and Os, present in parent igneous rocks, generally survived the processes of boulder breccia formation. Fractions of the Cl, Br, and Hg that are mobilized by water leaching and/or volatilization at moderate temperatures (⩽450°C) place constraints on the thermal history of Boulder 1 and its component breccias. Since, and possibly during, consolidation, the boulder has probably not been subjected to temperatures of ⩾450°C. The parent rocks of the Apollo 17 boulder and breccia samples studied could have been derived from two initial magmas. Boulder 1, Station 2 gray competent breccias 72255 and 72275 Clast #2 appear to be genetically unrelated to gray competent breccia and anorthositic material 72215, or to light friable breccia 72275; they do appear to be related to samples 72395 (Boulder 2) and 76315 (Station 6 boulder). Vapor clouds from apparently external sources permeated the source regions of the boulders.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00569672

R., Niemeyer, S., Phinney, D.|Moon|14|3-4|407|Rare gas isotopic analyses have been performed on both pile-irradiated and unirradiated samples from Boulder 1, Station 2. Two samples from rock 72255, the Civet Cat clast and a sample of adjacent breccia, have concordant<SUP>40</SUP>Ar-<SUP>39</SUP> Ar ages of 3.99±0.03 b.y. and 4.01±0.03 b.y., respectively. Several samples from rock 72275 have complex thermal release patterns with no datable features, but an intermediate-temperature plateau from the dark rim material of the Marble Cake clast yields an age of 3.99±0.03 b.y. - indistinguishable from the age of rock 72255. We regard these ages as upper limits on the time of the Serenitatis basin-forming event. The absence of fossil solar-wind trapped gases in the breccia samples implies that a prior existence for the boulder as near-surface regolith material can be regarded as extremely unlikely. Instead, the small trapped rare-gas components have isotopic and elemental compositions diagnostic of the terrestrial-type trapped component which has previously been identified in several Apollo 16 breccias and in rock 14321. Excess fission Xe is found in all Boulder 1 samples in approximately 1:1 proportions with Xe from spontaneous fission of<SUP>238</SUP>U. This excess fission Xe is attributed to spontaneous fission of<SUP>244</SUP>Puin situ. Cosmic-ray exposure ages for samples from rocks 72215 and 72255 are concordant, with mean<SUP>81</SUP>Kr-Kr exposure ages of 41.4±1.4 m.y. and 44.1±3.3 m.y., respectively. However a distinctly different<SUP>81</SUP>Kr-Kr exposure age of 52.5±1.4 m.y. is obtained for samples from rock 72275. A two-stage exposure model is developed to account for this discordance and for the remaining cosmogenic rare-gas data. The first stage was initiated at least 55 m.y. ago, probably as a result of the excavation of the boulder source-crop. A discrete change in shielding depths ∼ 35 m.y. ago probably corresponds to the dislodgement of Boulder 1 from the South Massif and emplacement in its present position.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00569674

D., Tatsumoto, M.|Moon|14|3-4|463|Nine U-Th-Pb whole-rock analyses of selected brecciated materials from sample 72215 and one analysis of a pigeonite basalt clast from 72275 are presented. Both samples are from Boulder 1, Apollo 17. These data supplement previous Boulder 1 U-Th-Pb analyses of samples 72275 and 72255. U and Th concentrations indicate that most of the samples contain a moderate to large KREEP component. Samples containing the least KREEP are a noritic clast (72255,49; Civet Cat clast) and an anorthositic clast (72275,117). Evidence for the migration of Pb from Pb-rich matrix material into relatively Pb-poor clasts is presented for two clasts. Most of the Boulder 1 data define a linear trend that intersects concordia at ∼ 3.9 and 4.4 b.y. when plotted on a U-Pb concordia diagram. The presence of one anorthositic clast distinctly off this trend indicates that a simple two-stage U-Pb evolution history is inadequate to explain all the data. Accordingly physical significance is only attached to the lower concordia intercept age of 3.9 4.0 b.y. The older concordia intercept age of ∼ 4.4 b.y. is interpreted to reflect an averaging of events both older and younger than 4.4 b.y. The data suggest that significant differentiation and/or metamorphism occurred ∼ 4.2 b.y. ago. The age of this event, however, is not accurately defined by these data.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00569676

M.|Moon|14|3-4|445|Rb, Sr and<SUP>87</SUP>Sr/<SUP>86</SUP>Sr have been determined for fragments of matrix and clasts from three of the hand-specimens of Boulder 1, 72275, 72255, and 72215. Total-rock and certain plagioclase samples from a crushed norite clast (Civet Cat) define an age of 4.17±0.05AE (2σ) for the pre-Serenitatis igneous differentiation of the norite. Pyroxene and other mineral separates were affected by a later event at about 3.9±0.1AE. An unshocked clast of pigeonite basalt has a well-fitted mineral isochron of 4.01±0.04AE. Samples of the competent breccia matrix comparatively rich in small clasts of highly radiogenic microgranite define a mixing line equivalent to 4.03±0.03AE, which denotes the age of the microgranite. Other samples of the matrix dominated by small anorthosite clasts define a 4.4AE mixing-line and demonstrate that Sr isotope equilibration between plagioclase and matrix did not occur during the high-temperature event that indurated the matrix.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00569675
