R.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2018||P13B-03|The Apollo 17 high-Ti basalts were originally classified into types on the basis of whole rock data. Initial types were A, B, C, and U. Type U represented unclassified basalts or those of uncertain affiliation. Four different types of volcanic glass have been described from the Apollo 17 sample collection based on color and composition: VLT, Green, Yellow, and Orange. There are three subdivisions of the orange glasses, based upon major elements. <P />An elemental database of analyses from the Apollo 17 basaltic samples (i.e., both glasses and crystalline basalts) has been compiled in an attempt to re-examine the origins of the crystalline basalts and glasses. This study also highlights those samples where more data are required to properly classify them. The database was used to create results for elements that are common to both basalts and glasses. The "Unclassified" Type U samples were examined on several plots (e.g., La vs. La/Sm, Fig. 1) and assigned to Types A, B1, B2, C, and D depending on their affinities. Where multiple analyses were reported for these samples, averages were taken and data were only omitted if the analysis was clearly different from the others that have been reported. Remarkably, only 4 samples (70035, 74235, 75035, 78579) did not plot consistently with the designated groups from Figure 1 and require more sophisticated analyses (larger sample mas needs to be homogenized). <P />The data show the following: <P />- Type B1 and B2 high-Ti basalts are distinct; <P />- Two new Type D basalts are defined (71597 and 78508 in addition to 79001); <P />- Type A, B1 and C basalts fall on the same trends, as do Types B2 and D; <P />- Orange glass groups are distinct from high-Ti mare basalts; <P />- VLT glasses are similar in composition to the average VLT basalt compositions. <P />Ratios of REE and HFSE elements demonstrate that these basaltic materials are derived from distinct sources. This can also be extended to the transition elements, but these can also be used to demonstrate that the crystalline basalt and glass groups are highly fractionated. The data from the Apollo 17 basaltic samples has allowed us to demonstrate mantle heterogeneity beneath Taurus Littrow. However, the magmas produced from these sources underwent similar evolutionary pathways.|
2017PhDT........61N|2017|Copper Diffusion in Silicate Melts and Melt Inclusion Study on Volatiles in The Lunar Interior|Ni, Peng|Ph.D. Thesis||||This thesis focuses on the application of diffusion kinetics to both terrestrial and lunar geochemistry. In Chapters II and III, diffusivities of Cu in silicate melts were experimentally determined and used to discuss the role of Cu diffusion in formation of Cu ore deposits and also Cu isotope fractionation in tektites. In Chapters IV and V, lunar olivine-hosted melt inclusions are studied to understand their volatile loss during homogenization in lab, to estimate cooling rate for lunar Apollo sample 74220, and to estimate volatile abundance in the lunar mantle. Magmatic sulfide deposits and porphyry-type Cu deposits are two major types of Cu deposits that supply the world's Cu. In particular, porphyry-type Cu deposits provide ∼57% of the world's total discovered Cu. Recent studies suggest a potential role of diffusive transport of metals (e.g. Cu, Au, PGE, Mo) in the formation of magmatic sulfide deposits and porphyry-type deposits. Diffusivities of Cu in silicate melts, however, are poorly determined. In Chapters II and III of this thesis, Cu diffusion in basaltic melt and rhyolitic melts are studied by diffusion couple and chalcocite "dissolution" methods. Our results indicate high diffusivities of Cu and a general equation for Cu diffusion in silicate melts is obtained. The high diffusivity of Cu indicate that partition of Cu between the silicate phase and the sulfide or fluid phase can be assumed to be in equilibrium during the formation of magmatic sulfide deposits or porphyry-type deposits. In addition, our Cu diffusion data helps explain why Cu isotopes are more fractionated than Zn isotopes in tektites. Volatile abundances in the lunar mantle have profound implications for the origin of the Moon, which was thought to be bone-dry till about a decade ago, when trace amounts of H2O were detected in various types of lunar samples. In particular, high H2O concentrations comparable to mid-ocean ridge basalts were reported in lunar melt inclusions. There are still uncertainties, however, for lunar melt inclusion studies in at least two aspects. One is whether the low H2O/Ce ratios measured in homogenized crystalline inclusions are affected by the homogenization process. The other is that current estimation of volatile abundances in lunar mantle relies heavily on 74220, which is argued to be a local anomaly by some authors. In order to reach a conclusive answer on volatile abundances in lunar mantle, the above two questions have to be answered. To improve our understanding about these questions, in Chapter IV of this thesis, a series of experiments are carried out to understand possible volatile loss from lunar melt inclusions during homogenization. Our results indicate significant H2O loss from inclusions during homogenization in minutes, whereas loss of F, Cl or S is unlikely a concern under our experimental conditions. The most applicable way to preserve H2O during homogenization is to use large inclusions. In Chapter V of this thesis, volatile, trace and major element data for melt inclusions from 10020, 12040, 15016, 15647 and 74235 are reported. Our new data indicate large variation in H2O/Ce ratios from ∼77 to ∼1 across different lunar samples, which is at least partially due to H2O loss on lunar surface during cooling. In addition, evidences were found in F/Nd and S/Dy ratios that might suggest lunar mantle heterogeneity in terms of its volatile abundances.|
