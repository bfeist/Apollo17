M., Crow, C., Mosenfelder, J., Zega, T., Angsa Science Team|52nd Lunar and Planetary Science Conference||2548|1572|We report the oxidation state of sulfur in apatite and associated phases in Apollo-era thin sections of 71035 and 71055, in preparation for measurements of new thin sections of the same samples, and the special frozen sample 71036.|

H.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|1||259|The paper deals with new and more accurate determinations of uranium, thorium, and isotopic lead data for five bulk samples and separate pyroxene, ilmenite, and plagioclase from basalt 71055. In a concordia diagram, the samples suggest a postcrystallization disturbance of the U-Pb systems of the rock. There is no compelling reason, from U-Pb data, to believe that the moon is younger than 4.55 AE.|
