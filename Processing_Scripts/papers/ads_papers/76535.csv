The core regolith is nearly uniform in composition with depth although the concentrations of Sc and Sm, for example, decrease from 28.5 μg g<SUP>−1</SUP> Sc and 5.93 μg g<SUP>−1</SUP> Sm at the top 2.5 cm to 26.9 μg g<SUP>−1</SUP> Sc and 5.55 μg g<SUP>−1</SUP> Sm at the bottom 2.5 cm. This change reflects an increase with depth in the relative abundance of Sm-poor, feldspathic material, from 48.4% at the top to 50.1% at the bottom. On the basis of compositional mass balance, the feldspathic (nonmare) material of the station 6 regolith requires a substantial proportion of an Mg-rich lithology, ~27% when modeled as troctolite sample 76535. The remaining 73% is nominally Sm-poor anorthositic norite in composition. No such Mg-rich component is required to account for the composition of the regolith of the South Massif (stations 2 and 3). The total feldspathic component of the North Massif regolith, normatively an anorthositic troctolite (74 vol% plagioclase, olivine:pyroxene = 55:45, Mg' = 78%), is very similar to that of the nonmare component of the Luna 20 regolith collected 910 km to the southeast on the Crisium ejecta deposit. We also present new composition data for 21, 25, and 16 small lithic fragments (0.1-3.9 mg each) from the regoliths of the Luna 16, 20, and 24 missions.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maps.13900

Reconciling the paradoxical geochemical features of this suite constitutes a feasibility test of lunar differentiation models. Here we present the results of a microanalytical examination of the archetypal specimen, troctolite 76535, previously thought to have cooled slowly from a large magma body. We report a degree of intra-crystalline compositional heterogeneity (phosphorus in olivine and sodium in plagioclase) fundamentally inconsistent with prolonged residence at high temperature. Diffusion chronometry shows these heterogeneities could not have survived magmatic temperatures for &gt;~20 My, i.e., far less than the previous estimated cooling duration of &gt;100 My. Quantitative modeling provides a constraint on the thermal history of the lower lunar crust, and the textural evidence of dissolution and reprecipitation in olivine grains supports reactive melt infiltration as the mechanism by which the magnesian suite formed.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-26841-4

Their geochronology is, therefore, important for constraining evolution models of the LMO. Petrogenetic models of the Mg-suite hold that their parent magmas were derived from primary LMO sources (Mg-cumulates, An-rich plagioclase, and melts enriched in KREEP-potassium, rare earth elements, and phosphorus). Previous radiogenic isotopic age interpretations of Mg-suite and putatively older, related ferroan anorthosites (FANs) overlap over a 200-million-year interval. The Apollo 78238 norite is an exemplary Mg-suite rock, with a relict coarse igneous texture modified by shock metamorphism. In-situ secondary ion mass spectrometry U-Pb analyses of zircon and baddeleyite in 78238 yield discordant arrays, attributed to recent impact metamorphism, with upper intercepts that constrain its crystallization age. The four oldest baddeleyite analyses give a weighted mean <SUP>207</SUP>Pb/<SUP>206</SUP>Pb age of 4332 ± 18 Ma (2σ, MSWD = 0.06, P = 0.98), which is interpreted as the crystallization age of the norite. The overlap of the baddeleyite age with previously reported Sm-Nd and Pb-Pb mineral isochron ages for 78238 (Edmunson et al., 2009) supports a moderately fast cooling of the norite. Moreover, it is distinguishably younger than the most precisely dated sample of FAN (Apollo 60025), measured at 4360 ± 3 Ma by Sm-Nd and Pb-Pb mineral isochrons (Borg et al., 2011). Together with the baddeleyite <SUP>207</SUP>Pb/<SUP>206</SUP>Pb age of Apollo Mg-suite troctolite 76535 at 4328 ± 8 Ma (White et al., 2020), the chronological record of the 78238 norite indicates a significant Mg-suite magmatic event at 4.33 Ga and a lower age limit on LMO differentiation.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2021.117046

H., Cayron, C., Dunlop, J., Tait, K. T., Anand, M.|Nature Astronomy|4||974|Accurately constraining the formation and evolution of the lunar magnesian suite is key to understanding the earliest periods of magmatic crustal building that followed accretion and primordial differentiation of the Moon. However, the origin and evolution of these unique rocks is highly debated. Here, we report on the microstructural characterization of a large (~250-μm) baddeleyite (monoclinic-ZrO<SUB>2</SUB>) grain in Apollo troctolite 76535 that preserves quantifiable crystallographic relationships indicative of reversion from a precursor cubic-ZrO<SUB>2</SUB> phase. This observation places important constraints on the formation temperature of the grain (&gt;2,300 °C), which endogenic processes alone fail to reconcile. We conclude that the troctolite crystallized directly from a large, differentiated impact melt sheet 4,328 ± 8 Myr ago. These results suggest that impact bombardment would have played a critical role in the evolution of the earliest planetary crusts.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41550-020-1092-5

A notable exception is the Sm-Nd age previously determined on Mg-suite gabbronorite 67667 which is at least 100 Ma younger than the youngest ferroan anorthosite. New chronologic measurements of 67667 presented here yield concordant Sm-Nd and Rb-Sr mineral isochron ages of 4349 ± 31 Ma and 4368 ± 67 Ma, suggesting the sample is older than previous estimates. Furthermore, a whole rock Sm-Nd isochron of Mg-suite rocks from the Apollo 14, 15, 16, and 17 landing sites yields an age of 4348 ± 25 Ma, indicating that Mg-suite magmatism was widespread and roughly contemporaneous on the lunar nearside. Analysis of Sm-Nd internal isochron ages confirms that Mg-suite magmatism was restricted to a period between about 4.33 and 4.35 Ga at the Apollo 14, 15, 16, and 17 landing sites and was synchronous with magmatism at the Apollo 16 site associated with the ferroan anorthosite suite between 4.35 and 4.37 Ga. Magnesian- and ferroan anorthosite suite rocks with ages younger than ∼4.33 Ga appear to have experienced slow cooling in the deep lunar interior, so that the ages record when the samples cooled below the closure temperature of the Sm-Nd isotopic system and not the time they crystallized. <P />The ages determined for Mg-suite and ferroan anorthosite suite rocks are concordant with the age determined for the formation of urKREEP of 4350 ± 34 Ma using the Sm-Nd isotopic systematics of 67667 and measurements completed on norite 78238, troctolite 76535, KREEP basalt 15386, and gabbronorite NWA 773. Crystallization ages of Mg-suite and FAS are also concordant with the average of <SUP>146</SUP>Sm-<SUP>142</SUP>Nd ages previously determined for the formation of the mare basalt source region of 4333 ± 30 Ma. The similarity of ages for Mg-suite magmatism, ferroan anorthosite suite magmatism, urKREEP formation, and formation of the mare basalt source regions implies the processes that produced these rocks were petrogenetically linked. It also implies that both early-stage and late-stage lunar magma ocean cumulates formed over a relatively short duration of &lt;40 Ma. Late and somewhat rapid solidification of a lunar magma ocean can account for the concordance of ferroan anorthosite suite rocks, urKREEP, and the mare basalt source regions. However, the major and trace element compositions of Mg-suite magmas preclude them from being a primary differentiation product of the lunar magma ocean. Instead, the Mg-suite could be produced as a result of mixing of magma ocean solidification products during density driven overturn occurring immediately after, or perhaps during, solidification of the lunar magma ocean. This scenario not only accounts for the chronology of the various rock suites, but is consistent with the petrogenesis of the Mg-suite that involves the interaction between pre-existing Mg-rich, plagioclase-rich, and urKREEP-rich cumulates of the magma ocean.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2020.09.013

Apatite and merrillite have been of particular interest, as they record vital information on the volatile content, U-Pb ages and trace-element composition of various planetary materials. However, the extent to which shock-deformation, pervasive among all planetary materials, affects the distribution of these valuable geochemical tracers is still poorly understood. Here we focus on exploring the U-Pb and Pb-Pb ages of apatite and merrillite in a set of variably shocked lunar rocks, building on previous nanostructural analyses of the phosphates.We carried out U-Pb and Pb-Pb analyses of phosphates in Apollo 17 samples of the Mg-suite rocks (76535, 76335, 76255, 72255, 78235 and 78236) using the CAMECA 1280 ion microprobe at the NordSIMS facility (Stockholm). In addition, we applied a recently developed approach of conducting high-precision U-Pb and Pb-Pb analyses by ID-TIMS of extracted phosphate grains (Jack Satterly Lab, University of Toronto). For this purpose, individual ~50x50x30 µm crystals of apatite and merrillite were extracted directly from thin sections using a Xe+ plasma FIB.As determined by SIMS, 207Pb/206Pb systematics of the unshocked or weakly shocked apatite in 76535 and 76335 is undisturbed, implying cooling of the rock below the closure temperature of Pb diffusion in apatite (~450°C) at ~4.2 Ga, ~100 Ma younger than what is interpreted as the rock's crystallization age. Phosphates that experienced similar levels of deformation but were in proximity or in direct contact with the impact melt in samples 76255 and 72255 show almost complete age resetting (~3.92 Ga). The SIMS determined age of 16 phosphates in sample 76255 is 3922.2 ± 6.7 Ma (2σ) and agrees with the previously published 207Pb/206Pb phosphate ages of impact melt breccias found within the same boulder and was interpreted as the timing of the Imbrium impact. These recrystallized phosphates yield comparable TIMS Pb-Pb ages (3917.8 ± 1.8 Ma and 3921.0 ± 1.3 Ma, 2σ) with significantly lower internal uncertainties than that of the individual SIMS measurements and may represent multiple impact-events close to the Imbrium event.SIMS U-Pb analyses of highly shocked phosphates (78235 and 78236) reveal a discordia line with an upper intercept of ~4.2 Ga and a lower intercept of ~0.5 Ga. We interpret this new, younger age as a minor thermal event that reactivated existing shock-induced nm-scale grain boundaries, as visualised by APT, within the apatite population to allow for Pb-loss at ~0.5 Ga. We propose a small crater located near the Apollo 17 landing site as a possible source of this sample.By correlating micro- to nanostructural characterization with in-situ age systematics we show that apatite and merrillite are powerful thermochronometers that provide a new approach to dating which has the potential to discriminate between temporally similar events. This can greatly aid in unravelling the bombardment record of solar system and be helpful when dealing with samples of limited availability (e.g. space return missions).|http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-1169

However, no samples were returned from the lunar farside, where one of the Moon's most geologically important features resides: the 2500-km-diameter South Pole-Aitken basin (SPA). Here, we explore the hypothesis that lunar troctolite 76535 was excavated by SPA. This hypothesis is motivated by the sample's low peak shock pressure (&lt;6 GPa), its substantial depth of origin (45-65 km), and its ancient <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/<SUP>39</SUP>Ar age of 4.25 Ga. We use hydrodynamic simulations of crater formation to show that for vertically incident impactors, SPA is the only known basin that can excavate material from the depth and shock pressure range relevant to 76535. The thermal history of 76535 also rules out excavation where a magma ocean was locally present. However, for the vertical impacts modeled, delivery of 76535 to the Apollo 17 site, where it was collected, requires a second impact event that preserved the sample's low shock state. An alternative interpretation of the SPA origin is that 76535 originates from the Serenitatis, Fecunditatis, or Australe basins, if the inferred origin depth of 76535 is in error by ~20 km, or its inferred peak shock pressure is in error by a factor of ~2. These basins could also be candidates for excavating 76535, if oblique impacts yield lower shock pressures of material excavated from the relevant depth. If troctolite 76535 is in fact a sample of SPA, we find that its 4.25 Ga excavation age and the density of large (100-300 km diameter) impact basins within and on the rim of SPA are consistent with the monotonically decaying Neukum (1983) chronology.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2019.113430

J.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2019||V51F-0114|Any description of lunar evolution requires explanation of the chemically paradoxical magnesian suite (Mg-suite) of lunar highlands rocks, which is characterized by chemical characteristics consistent with extreme differentiation alongside primitive mineral compositions. A better understanding of the magmatic cooling history of these samples is an essential step toward evaluating existing petrogenetic models [1]. An ideal candidate for evaluating magmatic cooling history is the well-studied, highly pristine Apollo 17 troctolite 76535. Subtle compositional zoning in olivine and plagioclase crystals can be leveraged for geospeedometry, in which quantitative line scans alongside x-ray intensity maps are utilized to obtain diffusion timescales. These diffusion timescales are combined with constraints provided by radiometric data [2], in order to obtain possible thermal histories. We tested temperature-time profiles corresponding to continuous, differentiable, and monotonous functions. These functions are not actual cooling paths, but rather end-member cooling styles that provide constraints on overall cooling times. We find the early cooling of this sample was rapid, taking at most 9.7 million years to cool from 1293 to 850 ̊C, which is well within error of the current Sm-Nd age of this sample. Not only was the cooling rapid, but evidence of dissolution and regrowth of olivine suggests at least one excursion out of the olivine stability field. An initially rapid, possibly multi-stage magmatic cooling history for the Mg-suite would be consistent with impact melting or shallow emplacement of a small intrusion. <P />[1] Shearer C, Elardo S, Petro N, Borg L, McCubbin F, (2015), American Mineralogist, V100, PP204-32 <P />[2] Borg L, Connelly J, Cassata W, Gaffney A, Bizzarro M, (2016), Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, V 201, pp 377-391|

Although most lunar and meteoritic samples show at least some evidence of impact metamorphism, relatively little is known about how these two phosphates respond to shock-loading. In this work, we analyzed a set of well-studied lunar highlands samples (Apollo 17 Mg-suite rocks 76535, 76335, 72255, 78235, and 78236), in order of displaying increasing shock deformation stages from S1 to S6. We determined the stage of shock deformation of the rock based on existing plagioclase shock-pressure barometry using optical microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and SEM-based panchromatic cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging of plagioclase. We then inspected the microtexture of apatite and merrillite through an integrated study of Raman spectroscopy, SEM-CL imaging, and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). EBSD analyses revealed that microtextures in apatite and merrillite become progressively more complex and deformed with increasing levels of shock-loading. An early shock-stage fragmentation at S1 and S2 is followed by subgrain formation from S2 onward, showing consistent decrease in subgrain size with increasing level of deformation (up to S5) and finally granularization of grains caused by recrystallization (S6). Starting with 2°-3° of intragrain crystal-plastic deformation in both phosphates at the lowest shock stage, apatite undergoes up to 25° and merrillite up to 30° of crystal-plastic deformation at the highest stage of shock deformation (S5). Merrillite displays lower shock impedance than apatite; hence, it is more deformed at the same level of shock-loading. We suggest that the microtexture of apatite and merrillite visualized by EBSD can be used to evaluate stages of shock deformation and should be taken into account when interpreting in situ geochemically relevant analyses of the phosphates, e.g., age or volatile content, as it has been shown in other accessory minerals that differently shocked domains can yield significantly different ages.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maps.13278

The <SUP>147</SUP>Sm-<SUP>143</SUP>Nd, <SUP>146</SUP>Sm-<SUP>142</SUP>Nd, and Rb-Sr ages derived from plagioclase, olivine, and pyroxene mineral isochrons yield concordant ages of 4307 ± 11 Ma, 4299<SUP>+29</SUP>/<SUB>-35</SUB> Ma, and 4279 ± 52 Ma, respectively. These ages are slightly younger than the age determined on ferroan anorthosite suite (FAS) rock 60025 and are therefore consistent with the traditional magma ocean model of lunar differentiation in which the Mg-suite is intruded into the anorthositic crust. However, the Sm-Nd ages record when the rock passed below the closing temperature of the Sm-Nd system in this rock at ∼825 °C, whereas the Rb-Sr age likely records the closure temperature of ∼650 °C. A cooling rate of 3.9 °C/Ma is determined using the ages reported here and in the literature and calculated closure temperatures for the Ar-Ar, Pb-Pb, Rb-Sr, and Sm-Nd systems. This cooling rate is in good agreement with cooling rates estimated from petrographic observations. Slow cooling can lower apparent Sm-Nd crystallization ages by up to ∼80 Ma in the slowest cooled rocks like 76535, and likely accounts for some of the variation of ages reported for lunar crustal rocks. Nevertheless, slow cooling cannot account for the overlap in FAS and Mg-suite rock ages. Instead, this overlap appears to reflect the concordance of Mg-suite and FAS magmatism in the lunar crust as indicated by ages calculated for the solidus temperature of 76535 and 60025 of 4384 ± 24 Ma and 4383 ± 17, respectively. Not only are the solidus ages of 76535 and 60025 nearly concordant, but the Sm-Nd isotopic systematics suggest they are derived from reservoirs that were minimally differentiated prior to ∼4.38 Ga. Although the Sr isotopic composition of 60025 indicates its source was minimally differentiated, the Sr isotopic composition of 76535 indicates it underwent fractionation just prior to solidification of the 76535. These observations are consistent with both a magma ocean or a serial magmatism model of lunar differentiation. In either model, differentiation of lunar source regions must occur near the solidification age of thee samples. Perhaps the best estimate for the formation age of lunar source regions is the Rb-Sr model age of the 76535 source region age of 4401 ± 32 Ma. This is in good agreement with Sm-Nd model ages for the formation of ur-KREEP and suggests that differentiation of a least part of the Moon could not have occurred prior to ∼4.43 Ga.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2016.11.021
2015EGUGA..17.8498H|2015|Constraints on lunar dynamo mechanism for interpreting lunar-wide magnetic field|Hemant Singh, Kumar, Kuang, Weijia|EGU General Assembly Conference Abstracts|||8498|Moon, once considered an in-active celesitial body, surprisingly showed evidences of magnetized crust in satellite and returned samples from Apollo mission. Several mechanisms have been suggested in the past for the origin of the lunar magnetization, but the origin of the magnetization remains unknown. Among the suggested mechanisms is the paleo lunar dynamo, i.e. the crustal magnetization was acquired in an internal magnetic field generated by a dynamo once operated in the lunar core. A key for this to work is that the generated field strength should be sufficient to explain observations. The paleo field strengths from the past paleomagnetic measurements of returned samples show that they vary from different sample sites, ranging from 33.3 (±8.18) to 5430 (±1330) nT. Results from the satellite data are more than an order of magnitude weaker than those from the samples. The dynamo field strength could be significantly weaker. Simple envelope estimation of magnetic induction can lead to the necessary condition for a dynamo is magnetic Reynolds number ≥ 10, which is approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than that estimated for the Earth's core. Our estimation with a strong-field lunar dynamo suggests that the field strengths are between 155 and 700 nT, depending on the lunar core size. This estimation is consistent with more recent results from paleomagnetic analysis of Apollo sample (76535) which provides paleointensity of the Moon to be at least 300 to 1000 nT.|

L.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2012||GP51B-03|Apollo-era paleomagnetic studies of lunar samples suggested that the Moon generated an ancient core dynamo. However, the temporal evolution of the magnetic field was unclear. One group proposed that the lunar dynamo ceased by 3.6 Ga, and that all paleointensity determinations from younger samples were indistinguishable from zero (Cisowski and Fuller, 1986). A second group proposed that the lunar dynamo persisted to at least 3.1 Ga, but surface field intensities declined to values 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than those during the period of 3.9-3.65 Ga (Runcorn, 1996). Recent re-analysis of samples 76535, 10020, and 10017 confirm that a lunar core dynamo generated a long-lived, stable magnetic field from 4.2 Ga to at least 3.6 Ga, with ~ 70 μT fields at 3.6-3.7 Ga (Garrick-Bethell et al., 2009; Shea et al., 2012; Suavet et al., 2012). Determining when the dynamo ultimately decayed is difficult because retrieving high-fidelity paleointensities for weak fields is difficult for the vast majority of lunar samples due to their poor magnetic recording properties (Tikoo et al., 2012). Thus far, no lunar samples with ages &lt; 3.6 Ga have been reported which unambiguously record a thermoremanence (TRM) acquired while cooling in the presence of a core dynamo-generated field. We investigated the state of the lunar dynamo after 3.6 Ga by studying the natural remanent magnetization of high magnetic fidelity mare basalts 15597 (~ 3.3 Ga) and 12022 (~ 3.2 Ga). Our alternating field and thermal demagnetization as well as rock magnetic data indicate that, by 3.2 Ga, any surface fields on the Moon were too weak (&lt; 7 μT) to be retrieved by our methods. Because our upper limit of 7 μT is consistent with predictions of dynamo scaling laws, it is possible that the lunar dynamo was still active at 3.2 Ga (Dwyer et al., 2011; LeBars et al., 2011). Nevertheless. such weak fields contrast strongly with the 60-70 μT paleointensities inferred for the Moon just 300-400 million years earlier. Furthermore, although Apollo-era paleointensity compilations have identified lunar paleofields ranging from 0.1-10 μT at 3.3 Ga to &lt;200 Ma, we have recently shown that many or all of these values are likely only upper limits (Tikoo et al. 2012).|

However, it was unclear whether this magnetization was produced by a core dynamo field or by plasmas generated by meteoroid impacts. We have been reexamining the paleomagnetism of lunar rocks with the goal of establishing the origin of the magnetizing field and its temporal history. Our recent analyses of troctolite 76535 and mare basalts 10020, 10017, and 10049 have now confirmed that a lunar core dynamo existed with a surface intensity of ~60-70 μT from at least 4.2 to 3.6 billion years (Ga) ago. Furthermore, our analyses of mare basalts 12022 and 15597 have identified no stable magnetization, indicating that the dynamo field had declined to weak (&lt;7 μT) or null intensities by 3.3 Ga. The protracted lifetime of the lunar dynamo may require an unusual power source like mechanical stirring. Furthermore, the strong inferred intensities present a challenge to current dynamo theory.|

However, a longstanding problem has been interpreting the unstable alternating field (AF) demagnetization behavior observed in the remaining majority of the Apollo lunar sample suite. Similar unstable behavior has also been observed for many meteorites. It is unclear whether the behavior of these samples indicates that they formed in the absence of an ancient magnetizing field or whether they simply have poor magnetic recording properties. It is necessary to distinguish between these two possibilities in order to determine whether paleomagnetic fields were present on a sample's parent body. To address this issue, we analyzed five samples whose rock magnetic properties span the full suite of observed demagnetization behaviors: mare basalts 15556, 15016, 12017, 10020, and troctolite 76535. We demonstrate that the effects of spurious anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) during AF demagnetization, in combination with multidomain magnetic carriers and magnetic remanence anisotropy, are likely responsible for the apparently poor magnetic behavior of many lunar samples. Therefore, the unstable AF demagnetization behavior observed for many lunar samples is not alone sufficient for ruling out the presence of an ancient lunar core dynamo. Nevertheless, spurious ARM may explain the observation of surprisingly high (≥1 μT) Apollo-era paleointensity measurements for samples thought to have formed after the cessation of a lunar core dynamo (&lt;1.5 Ga).|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2012.05.024

L., Gattacceca, J., Fuller, M.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2012||P34B-01|By the end of the Apollo era, paleomagnetic studies had established that lunar rocks carry a remanent magnetization that was acquired on the Moon. However, it was unclear whether this magnetization was produced by a core dynamo field or by plasmas generated by meteoroid impacts. We have been reexamining the paleomagnetism of lunar rocks with the goal of establishing the origin of the magnetizing field and its temporal history. Our recent analyses of troctolite 76535 and mare basalts 10020, 10017, and 10049 have now confirmed that a lunar core dynamo existed with a surface intensity of ~60-70 μT from at least 4.2 to 3.6 billion years (Ga) ago. Furthermore, our analyses of mare basalts 12022 and 15597 have identified no stable magnetization, indicating that the dynamo field had declined to weak (&lt;7 μT) or null intensities by 3.3 Ga. The protracted lifetime of the lunar dynamo may require an unusual power source like mechanical stirring. Furthermore, the strong inferred intensities present a challenge to current dynamo theory.|

R.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2012||P43B-1930|One of the most important conclusions resulting from the Apollo and Luna missions was the lack of water detected in the returned samples or at the surface of the Moon. This notion has been included in most geophysical and geochemical models of lunar formation and evolution. The view of an anhydrous lunar interior, however, has been challenged by the recent discoveries of hydrogen in picritic glass beads, apatites and olivine melt inclusions that were facilitated by the improvements of analytical detection limit of hydrogen. Indigenous water is now considered to be heterogeneously distributed in the lunar interior, some parts containing as much water as Earth's upper mantle. Hydrogen isotopic compositions of apatites in mare basalts have been used to identify the source of this water, with results indicating a combination of indigenous lunar water, water from comets, and solar wind protons. However, magma ocean crystallization modeling suggests that the water contents estimated for the lunar mantle from mare basalts may be overestimated. We present here measurements of water in the primary products of the lunar magma ocean (LMO) in order to potentially bypass the processes of later addition of water through impact event and/or solar wind implantation, and to estimate the water content of the Moon's interior at the time of the magma ocean crystallization, and that of the mare basalt source regions. Ferroan anorthosite is the only available lithology that is believed to be a primary product of the LMO. It is generally understood that plagioclase, after crystallization, floated in the LMO and formed ferroan anorthosite as the original permanent crust of the Moon. Therefore, any indigenous water preserved in pristine ferroan anorthosite was partitioned from the LMO. Using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, we have measured ~6 ppm of indigenous water as hydroxyl species in plagioclases from ferroan anorthosite 15415 and 60015. As plagioclase becomes a liquidus phase after 80% LMO crystallization, we calculated the initial water content of the latter to have been ~320 ppm H2O. Water accumulated in the final 2 vol.% LMO residuum as crystallization proceeded could reach amounts of ~1.4 wt.%. We therefore show that water has been present in the lunar interior since its earliest history, during LMO formation and crystallization. This water can affect magma ocean crystallization dynamics and the following mantle cumulate overturn process, and hence the genesis of the mare basalts. Furthermore, the amount of water calculated for the LMO is sufficient to explain those detected in lunar mare basalts, which are thought to be derived from more recently remelted magma ocean cumulates. Finally, ~6 ppm of indigenous water measured in ferroan anorthosite together with up to ~2.7 ppm that we have detected in plagioclase of troctolite 76535 may contribute a significant portion to the trace amount of water/hydroxyl recently detected on the surface of the lunar highland crust by spacecraft.|

L.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2011||GP11B-04|Following the Apollo missions, twenty years of paleomagnetic studies of returned samples have failed to demonstrate unambiguously the existence of an ancient lunar core dynamo. As a result of new technologies, more robust analytical methods, and a better understanding of rock magnetism, it is now possible to revisit lunar paleomagnetism. A set of criteria that must be met in order to demonstrate that a sample has recorded a core dynamo field has been defined: the samples must not show petrologic evidence of shock, the magnetization must be a stable thermoremanent magnetization (TRM), mutually oriented subsamples should agree in direction and intensity, and the thermal history should be well constrained, with a cooling timescale longer than the lifetime of impact generated fields (&gt;1h). A critical review of the literature has allowed us to identify Apollo samples that are most likely to provide good records of ancient lunar magnetic fields. The first samples to be studied within this framework were troctolite 76535 (Garrick-Bethell et al., 2009) and mare basalt 10020 (Shea et al., 2010), which have recorded a core dynamo field at 4.2 and 3.7 Ga, respectively. Mare basalt 10017 is a fine grained, vesicular, high-K ilmenite basalt with a crystallization age of 3.6 Ga. It was studied by different groups (Fuller and Meshkov, 1979; Hoffman et al., 1979; Runcorn et al., 1970; Stephenson et al., 1977), all of whom noted the stability of its magnetization. We have measured 7 subsamples of chip 10017,378. Their magnetizations agree in direction, with a low coercivity overprint removed by 10 mT AF demagnetization, and a stable high coercivity component consistent with a TRM. Paleointensity estimations give a conservative minimum of 12 μT for the paleofield. This sample is ~100 Myr younger than the end of the late heavy bombardment, which rules out basin-forming impacts as a possible candidate to explain its magnetization. It extends the lifetime of the putative ancient lunar core dynamo well after thermal convection of the liquid core could have sustained an Earth-like lunar dynamo, thereby supporting non-standard dynamo scenarios such as a mechanical-stirring driven dynamo that could have been triggered by lunar librations from Earth tides or by impacts.|

L., Fuller, M.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2010||DI33B-08|The discovery of remnant magnetization in returned Apollo samples and the lunar crust has long suggested that the Moon has a metallic core and once had a core-dynamo magnetic field (Fuller and Cisowski, 1987). However, the association of magnetization with the antipodes of impact basins suggests that meteoroid impacts may also be the source of lunar magnetization (e.g., Hood and Artemieva, 2008). Distinguishing between these two hypotheses is difficult as most lunar samples are poor recorders of paleomagnetic fields (Fuller and Cisowski, 1987; Tikoo et al., 2010). Since impact-generated shock waves can remagnetize low-coercivity (&lt;~30 mT) grains, samples must have high coercivities and show no petrographic evidence for shock (Gattacceca et al., 2009). Recent paleomagnetic analyses of one lunar sample, troctolite 76535, observed a stable NRM blocked up to &gt;200 mT (Garrick-Bethell et al., 2009). The slow cooling timescale of this rock (millions of years) relative the lifetime of impact-produced fields (&lt;1 day maximum) suggests that the moon had a core dynamo at 4.2 Ga. We present a new paleomagnetic study of another high coercivity, unshocked lunar rock, mare basalt 10020. This sample records evidence for lunar magnetism 500 Ma after troctolite 76535. Our results suggest it too has a stable NRM acquired over timescales that are long relative to impact-produced fields. 10020 is a fine-grained, vesicular, ilmenite basalt with a 40Ar/39Ar age of 3.72 ±0.04 Ga that is within error of Rb/Sr crystallization ages of similar composition Apollo 11 basalts (Geiss et al., 1977, Guggisberg et al., 1979). Collinson et al. (1972) and Stephenson et al. 1977 found that a 10020 has one of the most stable NRMs of any studied lunar sample (blocked up to &gt;65 mT). We have now found that two mutually oriented samples of 10020 have a stable (&gt; 65-80 mT) origin-trending unidirectional NRM component. Petrographic analyses of this sample find no evidence for shock such as alteration to maskelynite or fracturing. Pressure remanent experiments on 10020 show that the magnetism could not have been produced by an impact. We therefore suggest that the magnetization recorded in 10020 was generated by a core dynamo. We are currently conducting Ar/Ar dating and further magnetic analyses to further test this hypothesis.|

L., Gattacceca, J.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2010||GP43B-1049|Forty years after the Apollo program, the source of the magnetization observed in the lunar crust and in returned samples remains unresolved. The two leading explanations for lunar remanent magnetism are transient magnetic fields created by impact events and the existence of an ancient lunar core dynamo. In order for a lunar sample to present strong evidence that it acquired its primary remanent magnetism from an ancient lunar dynamo, several criteria should be met. First, the sample should not bear any petrologic evidence of shock, implying a peak pressure of ≤ 5 GPa. Then, during demagnetization experiments, the natural remanent magnetization (NRM) ideally should converge to a stable direction, with intensity decreasing towards the origin. The magnitude and direction of primary magnetic remanence should also agree across mutually oriented subsamples. Finally, the initial cooling timescale for the sample should be ≥ ~1 hour in order to effectively rule out impact events as magnetizing field sources. Recent studies on lunar troctolite 76535 (Garrick-Bethell et al. 2009) and ilmenite basalt 10020 (Shea et al. 2010) have demonstrated that these samples meet all of the aforementioned criteria and support the possibility that an ancient lunar dynamo existed at 4.2 Ga and 3.7 Ga, respectively. However, the stable magnetic behaviors observed in 76535 and 10020 appear to represent exceptions rather than the rule when compared to the rest of returned lunar samples. The vast majority of lunar samples subjected to paleomagnetic studies display chaotic NRM behavior, evidenced by non-monotonic decline of magnetic moment and unstable directions of magnetization when undergoing demagnetization experiments (see Brecher, 1976). Before a lunar dynamo can be a fully accepted, it is vital to demonstrate that the poor magnetic behaviors evident in the rest of the lunar sample collection do not indicate the absence of a magnetic field. Here we present results of a study which investigates the alternating field (AF) demagnetization behavior and magnetic recording capacities of mare basalts 15556, 12017 and 15016. All of these samples appear to be unshocked (peak pressures ≤ 5 GPa) and have cooling timescales longer than the expected duration of impact fields. Our results reveal that these three samples display unstable AF demagnetization behavior. The samples also appear to be imprecise paleointensity recorders of fields with intensities under ~ 30 μT (near the lower bound of the Earth’s present field strength), at least when measured using AF demagnetization. Based on these findings, we posit that many lunar samples are intrinsically unable to preserve robust paleointensity records of magnetic fields when analyzed using AF methods. Therefore, their chaotic demagnetization behavior does not rule out the existence of an ancient lunar dynamo.|
2010AGUFMGP42A..04F|2010|Lunar Paleomagnetism: The Case for an Ancient Lunar Dynamo. (Invited)|Fuller, M., Weiss, B. P., Gattacceca, J.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2010||GP42A-04|The failure of lunar samples to satisfy minimal criteria for classical paleointensity determinations has led to skepticism of the case for an ancient lunar dynamo. There are however practical and fundamental reasons why such experiments are doomed to failure in most lunar samples. In such methods, NRMs in successive blocking temperatures ranges are thermally demagnetized and replaced with partial thermoremanent magnetization (pTRMs) given in a known field (Thellier, 1938). A practical difficulty is that it is hard to heat lunar samples without altering them. A fundamental problem is that whereas pottery, for which these methods were designed, carries a primary (TRM) from its initial cooling and little secondary magnetization, lunar samples are likely to carry weak field isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) and shock remanent magnetization (SRM) as secondary overprints. Thermal demagnetization does not isolate weak field IRM well. For example, on thermal demagnetization of the Apollo sample 14053.48 carrying a 2000nT TRM with a superposed 5mT IRM, the IRM persists to the Curie point obscuring the TRM. Fortunately, weak field IRM is removed by AF demagnetization to fields comparable to that in which it is acquired. Furthermore, Gattacceca et al. (2008) demonstrated that experimentally generated SRM from several GPa, like weak field IRM, is demagnetized by AF fields of between ~20 and 30 mT, leaving the pre-shock remanent magnetization essentially untouched. This agrees with our theoretical understanding of SRM, which at pressures below approximately the Hugoniot elastic limit (several GPa for most rocks) should essentially be a pressure remanent magnetization (e.g., Dunlop and Ozdemir, 1997). Unlike IRM, SRM in the range of a few GPa may carry recoverable lunar field records (Gattacceca et al., 2008). NRM in samples shocked to less than ~5 GPa, which is stable against AF demagnetization beyond the fields necessary to eliminate weak SRM (~20-30 mT), requires some other explanation. Such NRM carried by the small amount of single domain iron and iron nickel present in the samples can be very stable. The troctolite 76535 is an example of such a sample. It cooled over thousands of years, or longer, which is far too long for any possible transient fields associated with impacts and must carry a TRM like NRM. Note that despite predictions that even km sized craters may generate fields up to 0.1T at 1 crater radius, no unambiguous evidence for paleomagnetic recording of such fields over individual craters has materialized. There are numerous other candidate samples having experienced &lt;~5 GPa carrying stable NRM, which have been analyzed, or are being presently investigated. The only other obvious source of a field to explain stable TRM in lunar rocks is that of surface lunar fields, but over the mare these are too weak to account for the NRM of mare basalts. In summary, recent advances in our understanding of SRM and reanalysis of lunar paleomagnetism lead us to conclude that lunar paleomagnetism is most easily explained by a lunar dynamo.|

Our new paleointensity experiments on four samples use modern absolute and relative measurement techniques, with ages ranging from 3.3 to 4.3 Ga, bracketing the putative period of an ancient lunar field. Samples 60015 (anorthosite) and 76535 (troctolite) failed during absolute paleointensity experiments. Samples 72215 and 62235 (impact breccias) recorded a complicated, multi-component magnetic history that includes a low-temperature (&lt;500 °C) component associated with a high intensity (∼90 μT) and a high temperature (&gt;500 °C) component associated with a low intensity (∼2 μT). Similar multi-component behavior has been observed in several published absolute intensity experiments on lunar samples. Additional material from 72215 and 62235 was subjected to a relative paleointensity experiment (a saturation isothermal remanent magnetization, or sIRM, experiment); neither sample provided unambiguous evidence for a thermal origin of the recorded remanent magnetization. We test several magnetization scenarios in an attempt to explain the complex magnetization recorded in lunar samples. Specifically, an overprint from exposure to a small magnetic field (an isothermal remanent magnetization) results in multi-component behavior (similar to absolute paleointensity results) from which we could not recover the correct magnitude of the original thermal remanent magnetization. In light of these new experiments and a thorough re-evaluation of existing paleointensity measurements, we conclude that although some samples with ages of 3.6 to 3.9 Ga are strongly magnetized, and sometimes exhibit stable directional behavior, it has not been demonstrated that these observations indicate a primary thermal remanence. Particularly problematic in the interpretation of lunar sample magnetizations are the effects of shock. As relative paleointensity measurements for lunar samples are calibrated using absolute paleointensities, the lack of acceptable absolute paleointensity measurements renders the interpretation of relative paleointensity measurements unreliable. Consequently, current paleointensity measurements do not support the existence of a 3.9-3.6 Ga lunar dynamo with 100 μT surface fields, a result that is in better agreement with satellite measurements of crustal magnetism and that presents fewer challenges for thermal evolution and dynamo models.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pepi.2008.05.007

These two samples were also subjected to a relative paleointensity experiment (sIRM), from which neither provided unambiguous evidence for a thermal origin of the recorded remanent magnetization. We found similar multi-component behavior in several published experiments on lunar samples. We test and present several magnetization scenarios in an attempt to explain the complex magnetization recorded in lunar samples. Specifically, an overprint from exposure to a small magnetic field (i.e. IRM) results in multi-component behavior (similar to lunar sample results), from which we could not recover the correct magnitude of the original TRM. The non-unique interpretation of these multi-component results combined with IRM (isothermal remanent magnetization) contamination during Apollo sample return ( Strangway et al., 1973), indicates that techniques incapable of distinguishing between single- and multi-component records (e.g., sIRM), cannot be reliably used to infer magnetic conditions of the early Moon. In light of these new experiments and a thorough reevaluation of existing paleointensity measurements, we conclude that there is a paucity of lunar samples that demonstrate a primary thermal remanent magnetization. As relative paleointensity measurements for lunar samples are calibrated using absolute paleointensities, the lack of acceptable absolute paleointensity measurements renders the interpretation of relative paleointensity measurements unreliable. Consequently, current lunar paleointensity measurements are inadequate to determine the existence and strength of an early lunar magnetic field. Surface magnetometry measurements and the return of magnetically uncontaminated samples from future missions are much needed for further progress in understanding the characteristics and origin of lunar crustal remanent magnetization.|

A.|Lunar Highlands Crust|||419|Xenon released in stepwise heating of troctolite 76535 shows remarkable similarity to that from the gas-rich breccias. The low temperature fractions are highly enriched in fissiogenic xenon from Pu-244. Although the quantity of fission xenon is not inconsistent with reported age data, release patterns demonstrate that this component is not due to in situ decay. However, in contrast with the gas-rich breccias, the parentless radionuclear component in 76535 is not accompanied by solar wind xenon. Mechanisms for the emplacement of this component in 76535 cannot, therefore, involve exposure on the lunar surface but most likely involve adsorption along intergranular boundaries or thermally driven redistribution. The fact that xenon released from a gas-poor igneous cumulate can mimic that from gas-rich breccias, except for the presence of solar wind xenon in the latter, suggests that direct exposure to space is not required for the incorporation of these weakly bound, surface-correlated, parentless radionuclear components in lunar samples.|

The age of formation of the Serenitatis Basin is then deduced at 4.26 ± 0.02 G.y. ago, about 300 million years before the Imbrium event. It appears that the major basin forming era on the near side of the moon lasted longer than 300 million years. The grouping of many lunar rock ages at 3.9 - 4.0 G.y. is most likely due to the fact that the Imbrium ejecta predominates all highland landing sites.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/GL002i001p00029

Rb-Sr data do not define an isochron. Rb/Sr and <SUP>87</SUP>Sr/ <SUP>86</SUP>Sr ratios of the plagioclase and the whole rock are identical, whereas data for various "olivine" separates show considerable scatter, presumably because of disturbance of the isotopic system. Total <SUP>40</SUP>Ar sbnd K ages of whole rock and plagioclase range from 4.40-4.54 × 10 <SUP>9</SUP> yr. However, the rock apparently contains <SUP>40</SUP>Ar which is not the product of in-situ decay of <SUP>40</SUP>K and <SUP>36</SUP>Ar, <SUP>38</SUP>Ar, and Ne which are not the result of cosmic-ray interactions during the 195-m.y. cosmic-ray exposure history.

A K sbnd Ar gas retention age for the plagioclase of 4.34 ± 0.08 × 10 <SUP>9</SUP>yr is derived. This K sbnd Ar age can be used to calculate an initial <SUP>87</SUP>Sr/ <SUP>86</SUP>Sr ratio of 0.69913 ± 0.00005 from whole-rock and plagioclase analyses. The trapped Ne and Ar in 76535 cannot be uniquely characterized as either "planetary derived" or solar wind derived, but appear to have characteristics of both. The data suggest that 76535 formed 4.3-4.6 AE ago, and the accumulation process and/or subsequent annealing may have incorporated excess noble gases. Separation of radiogenic parents and daughters with incomplete isotopic equilibration may also have occurred during cooling or during a subsequent "event".|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(75)90178-8
