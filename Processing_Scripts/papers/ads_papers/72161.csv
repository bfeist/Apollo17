H.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2013||P54B-05|Synthesis of Is/FeO maturity indexes for Apollo 17 regolith samples in the valley of Taurus-Littrow on the Moon indicate that high levels of ilmenite in the samples significantly reduces the level of this indicator of space exposure. The analysis, along with consideration of regolith glass characteristics, also discloses that micro-meteor fluxes vary over geologic time, presumably in response to significant impact events in the Asteroid Belt. Surface samples of ilmenite-poor, silicate-rich regolith have about 80-90% higher maturity indexes than surface samples of ilmenite-rich, basaltic regolith of comparable exposure. For comparison of the history of various regolith exposures to the space environment, Taurus-Littrow's light mantle avalanche deposit, the youngest large area stratigraphic unit, provides a specific time horizon. For at least the last ~110 million years, the currently estimated age of the light mantle avalanche, most near surface (upper 1-5cm) regolith has had approximately the same exposure to micro-meteors. The surface of the largely ilmenite-rich basalt fill in the valley has been exposed to space at least as long or possibly 30 million years longer than the light mantle, based on exposure ages for large boulder ejecta in the Camelot cluster of craters. High apparent maturity (Is/FeO &gt;80), however, exists only on three types of regolith surfaces: (1) the North Massif apron (e.g., 77431), (2) the light mantle avalanche deposit (e.g., 72161), and (3) low ilmenite basalt (e.g., 72150). Only intermediate to low maturity (Is/FeO &lt;60) has developed in surface regolith overlying high titanium basalt (e.g., 70181). TiO2/TiO2+FeO ratios provide a good measure of original ilmenite content, ilmenite being the only quantitatively significant titanium-bearing mineral in the regolith. Those ratios for samples showing high and intermediate apparent maturity are about 0.35 and 0.25, respectively. A well documented, 3.5 billion year old basaltic regolith (77240, 77260) exposed at Shorty Crater as a unit stratigraphically overlying the orange ash, has exceptionally low maturity (8% agglutinates and Is/FeO = 5) but an unusually high amount of "ropy" glass (14-18%). (Ropy glass normally constitutes less than on percent of new Taurus-Littrow regolith. It forms within fresh impact craters as a result of macro-meteor impacts, but the current flux of micro-meteors disaggregates such glass within a million years or less.) The light mantle avalanche deposit protected this ancient regolith unit at Shorty Crater for at up to 90 million years prior to the Shorty impact 14-17 million years ago. A significant micro-meteor flux cannot have existed during the formation of this ancient regolith or it would have a higher maturity index and little or no ropy glass. Variable maturities observed in core samples from elsewhere in the valley of Taurus-Littrow may be the result of either variable mirco-meteor flux or variable exposure during periods of moderate flux or a combination of both.|

R.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|186|3-4|335|The bombardment of the lunar surface by cosmic rays produces secondary neutrons, some of which are thermalized by the lunar soil and then interact strongly with the isotopes of Cd, Gd and Sm which have high neutron capture cross sections at thermal energies causing changes in their isotopic compositions. We have measured these changes in samples from the Apollo 14, 16 and 17 missions using thermal ionization mass spectrometry. Changes of <SUP>114</SUP>Cd/<SUP>113</SUP>Cd of 0.3-0.5% in samples 60501,105, 65701,23 and 72161,73, of 0.4 and 0.8% in <SUP>158</SUP>Gd/<SUP>157</SUP>Gd in samples 14163,848 and 60501,105 and of 0.8, 1.2 and 0.06% for <SUP>150</SUP>Sm/<SUP>149</SUP>Sm in samples 14163,848 and 60501,105 and 74220,125 respectively, have been observed. This is the first time that neutron capture on Cd has been detected in lunar samples. Thermal neutrons are captured preferentially at resonance energies of 0.03 eV by <SUP>155</SUP>Gd and <SUP>157</SUP>Gd, at 0.09 eV by <SUP>149</SUP>Sm and at 0.178 eV by <SUP>113</SUP>Cd. A comparison of the changes in <SUP>114</SUP>Cd/<SUP>113</SUP>Cd, <SUP>156</SUP>Gd/<SUP>155</SUP>Gd, <SUP>158</SUP>Gd/<SUP>157</SUP>Gd and <SUP>150</SUP>Sm/<SUP>149</SUP>Sm due to neutron capture can therefore indicate the energy distribution of the neutrons. Previous work has compared changes in <SUP>158</SUP>Gd/<SUP>157</SUP>Gd and <SUP>150</SUP>Sm/<SUP>149</SUP>Sm, while this study extends the comparison to <SUP>114</SUP>Cd/<SUP>113</SUP>Cd, where the resonance energy is significantly higher. This has enabled us to confirm evidence for a harder neutron energy spectrum in lunar soil than is predicted theoretically. This can be seen in significantly higher capture rates than predicted for <SUP>149</SUP>Sm compared to <SUP>157</SUP>Gd. We also present evidence of enhanced capture rates on <SUP>113</SUP>Cd compared with <SUP>149</SUP>Sm and <SUP>157</SUP>Gd. The concentrations of Cd, Gd and Sm in nine lunar samples have also been measured by isotope dilution mass spectrometry with Cd being measured in lunar samples for the first time by this method. While Cd was found to be heterogeneously distributed in some samples, Gd and Sm showed good agreement with previous measurements, except for sample 14163,848 where it was significantly lower.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0012-821X(01)00231-X
1998nvmi.conf...63R|1998|Average Mineral Composition of Apollo Landing Site Soils|Riegsecker, Sue E., Tieman, A., Basu, Abhijit|New Views of the Moon: Integrated Remotely Sensed, Geophysical, and Sample Datasets|||63|The purpose of this paper is to express the average composition of lunar soils at Apollo landing sites in terms of four principal mineral groups, i.e., plagioclase, pyroxene, olivine and opaque (mostly ilmenite) Several studies have shown that lunar soil predominantly consists of lithic fragments of mare and highland rocks, glass fragments, fused soil particles, and the single grains of minerals. To achieve this goal, we have compiled modal data from the literature and recast them in terms of these minerals. The distribution of percentages for the lithic and mineral components of the lunar soil samples (90-150 pm) was compiled from the modal data in the Handbook of Lunar Soils and checked against primary sources. We used our own analyses for soils 14141, 15271, 15401, 15431, 67941, and 72161. The population of glass, regolith breccia, and fused soil was neglected on the assumption that they approximately represented the modal distribution of the minerals in the soil. Grains classified as anorthosites, gabbronorite, crystalline breccias, and highland basalt were grouped as "higuand rocks"; those classified as mare basalt and KREEP basalt were grouped as "mare rocks."|
