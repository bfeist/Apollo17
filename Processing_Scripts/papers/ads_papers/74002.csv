2014Icar..229..109F|2014|New evidence for chondritic lunar water from combined D/H and noble gas analyses of single Apollo 17 volcanic glasses|Füri, Evelyn, Deloule, Etienne, Gurenko, Andrey, Marty, Bernard|Icarus|229||109|In order to assess the proportion of solar, cosmogenic, and indigenous water (hydrogen) trapped in individual Ti-rich lunar volcanic glasses (LVGs) from the 74002 core obtained during the Apollo 17 mission, we coupled ion microprobe measurements of water abundances and D/H ratios with CO<SUB>2</SUB> laser extraction-static mass spectrometry analyses of noble gases (He, Ne, Ar). The large (∼300-400 μm in diameter) LVGs studied here contain a small amount of solar wind (SW) volatiles implanted at the grain surfaces, as indicated by the small concentrations of solar helium and neon that represent ⩽5% of the respective total noble gas abundances. The large proportion of volume-correlated cosmogenic gases reflects an exposure duration of ∼28 Ma, on average, of the glasses at the lunar surface. Hydrogen abundances determined in the grain interiors of glassy and partially-crystalline LVGs are equivalent to between 6.5 and 54.3 ppm H<SUB>2</SUB>O. Based on the noble gas exposure ages, the correction of the measured hydrogen isotope composition for in situ production of cosmogenic deuterium by spallation reactions varies between -5‰ to -254‰ for the different grains. Corrected δD values range from +38‰ to +809‰ in the LVGs and are anti-correlated with the water content, consistent with extensive hydrogen isotope fractionation during kinetic H<SUB>2</SUB> loss from a lunar melt with an inferred initial isotope signature of the order of -100‰ and a water content of 100-300 ppm. The detection of water in these primitive lunar melts confirms the presence of a non-anhydrous mantle reservoir within the Moon. Furthermore, our results reveal that the hydrogen isotope composition of water in the melt source of the 74002 LVGs is similar to that of carbonaceous chondrites. These observations indicate that the contribution of deuterium-enriched cometary water to the Earth-Moon system is negligible.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2013.10.029

S., Marti, K.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|21||291|Trapped N in the black/orange glass at different levels of the 74001/74002 double-drive tube can be used to address two questions: the isotopic composition of indigenous N exhaled from the lunar interior 3.7 Ga ago; and the nature of extralunar N incident upon the lunar surface during the same epoch. Indigenous lunar N is found to have the same δ<SUP>15</SUP>N value as N in terrestrial mantle samples with high <SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He ratios. This suggests that the lunar interior and the terrestrial mantle acquired their N, and possibly other volatiles, from a common nebular reservoir. The ancient extralunar N reveals evidence for a <SUP>15</SUP>N-enriched component present on the lunar surface 3.7 Ga ago, together with <SUP>15</SUP>N-depleted N. However, the role of these components, for neither of which a solar origin can be excluded, in explaining the long-term increase in <SUP>15</SUP>N/<SUP>14</SUP>N ratio of regolith N on the Moon is not yet clear.|

R.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|88||B211|Mn-53 data are presented for four Apollo cores with an emphasis on the past 10-to-the-7th-year history of these samples: (1) Core 15011 has excess Mn-53 down to a depth of at least 9 cm, which is probably due to the continuous addition of near-surface irradiated material. (2) The Mn-53 profile for 64002 above 12 cm is relatively flat and in excess of that calculated for a static core, which suggests that the upper part of this core was deposited rapidly about 2 m.y. ago. (3) Results for the Apollo 17 drill stem show a large excess of Mn-53 from at least 3 cm downwards. Some magnetic separates obtained from this core have very high Mn-53 activities, probably due to the presence of agglutinates that were recently irradiated very near the surface. (4) The Mn-53 content of the upper part of 74002 is similar to that of trench samples collected nearby and indicates that the gray, orange, and black soils at this site have been exposed together near the surface for at least the last 10 m.y.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JB088iS01p0B211
1983GeCoA..47..491D|1983|Sulphur content and sulphur isotope composition of orange and black glasses in Apollo 17 drive tube 74002/1|Ding, T. P., Thode, H. G., Rees, C. E.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|47|3|491|The sulphur contents and δ<SUP>34</SUP>S values have been determined for the bulk and various grain size fractions of three 74002/1 lunar drive tube samples. The sulphur contents of the bulk samples ate much lower than those of other lunar soils. These samples, along with the surface orange soil 74220 analysed previously, show an increase of sulphur concentration with decreasing particle size which is more marked than for other soils and indicates that the orange and black glass droplets have a coating enriched in sulphur and other volatile elements. In sharp contrast with other soils, the orange and black glasses have slight positive δ<SUP>34</SUP>S values for large particles while the smallest particle sizes show negative δ<SUP>34</SUP>S values. This indicates that the coating of the glassy droplets is enriched in isotopically light sulphur. These observations favour the theory that the orange and black glasses were generated by a volcanic fire fountain. The anomalously high δ<SUP>34</SUP>S values of the fine fractions of the core bottom sample, 74001-135, combined with the results of an acid leaching experiment, indicate that these fractions are contaminated, possibly by a mature soil of high sulphur content and relatively positive δ<SUP>34</SUP>S value.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(83)90271-5
1980LPSC...11.1551K|1980|Distribution of volatile and non vilatile elements in grain-size fractions of Apollo 17 drive tube 74001/2.|Kraehenbuehl, U.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1551|A study of four samples of double drive tube 74001/2 originating from 12, 25, 38, and 58 cm depths indicates that the concentrations of major and nonvolatile elements are fairly uniform for the four layers and the individual size fractions, while volatile elements as well as Au and Ir are enriched in the smaller grain-size fractions. It is concluded from the measured Au/Ir ratios and from the absence of a surface enrichment of Co that the material in the drive tube 74001/2 is not the result of an impact of an iron meteorite into a lava lake, but originated in at least three volcanic eruptions. No indication of a later disturbance of the stratigraphy of the layers is observed. Exposure ages of 345,000 and 225,000 years result from Ir deposits for the two layers of 74002.|

S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1593|Multispectral images of a lunar core segment are a new form of continuous data along the length of the core. A new laboratory arrangement was developed to obtain these images. Data processing and initial data analysis for core section 74002 were performed. The images are sensitive to variations in mineralogy and/or maturity of the soil and are easily used (1) in stratigraphic studies of the lunar regolith, (2) for sample selection of representative material, and (3) as ground truth for remote sensing studies.|

S., Waits, G., Fuhrman, R.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1945|SEM-EDX analysis of the surface morphology of the 74001 and 74002 orange and black glassy droplets has revealed the presence of ubiquitous micromound coatings. Assuming that the diameter of an individual micromound is an indication of total coating thickness, then the thickness of this volatile and metal-rich layer ranges from less than 20 A to over 300 A in thickness. On rare droplets the micromound coating is partially covered by a sparse population of crystals and masses that are essentially NaCl in composition. Additionally, an irregular mass on the surface of one black droplet may contain free sulfur. Amoeboid masses of iron, some with incipient crystal faces, are also present on a few droplet surfaces. The above features, i.e., halite crystals, sulfur-rich masses and amoeboid iron, are rare; the more common occurrence of metals and volatiles is in the micromound coating. Based on our observations of several hundred spheres from both Apollo and Luna missions, the classic micromound coating is unique to the Apollo 15 green and Apollo 17 orange and black droplets. Although some investigators have proposed various impact sequences to produce these unique droplets, the volcanic fire fountain origin is favored.|

W.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||2019|Measurements of the Al-26 and Mn-53 in interior portions of lunar rocks have shown that lunar surface processes which move a significant fraction of kilogram size rocks on the lunar surface occur on time scales of a few million years. These measurements, together with noble gas age dating have made it possible to define the history for nine rock samples selected from whole rock counting data because of anomalously low Al-26 relative to Na-22. Six of the rocks from the Apollo 15 and 16 missions showed evidence of movement during the past five million years. Of these six, only two are of an age consistent with their origin from the South Ray Crater Event. In addition, our measurements of Na-22 and Al-26 in Apollo 17 double drive tube 74001-74002 suggest that one to two cm of soil is missing from the top of this core tube. Even with this loss, at least two cm of gardening is indicated in the top portion of 74002.|

Significant reworking of the soil only occurred down to a few cm from the lunar surface since this event. Complementary investigations in this core by other groups are discussed. Most of the evidence available leads to a two stage model in which the orange and black soils collected at Shorty Crater were first irradiated for approximately 25 m.y. at some depth and then were deposited only a few m.y. ago as an overturned ejecta blanket.|
