This program was intended as a participating scientist program for these Apollo samples, as well as a preparation for upcoming lunar sample return missions (e.g., Artemis). The work began with studies of unsealed core tube 73002 [1,2] that is the upper ~35 cm of an Apollo 17 double drive tube (~70 cm total depth) collected on the landslide deposit near Lara Crater at Station 3 in the Taurus Littrow Valley. More recently the program extended to the study of a variety of frozen Apollo 17 samples [3], as well as the gas extraction [4] and dissection [5] of 73001, the lower half of the station 3 double drive tube. Sample 73001 was sealed under vacuum on the Moon in a Core Sample Vacuum Container (CSVC). In this abstract we will examine the role of X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) during the preliminary examination process for sealed core 73001, including: (1) engineering scans to aid in understanding the gas extraction process, (2) whole-core scanning prior to opening to inform extrusion and dissection work, and (3) individual particle scanning to characterize rock fragment lithologies for follow on studies. Methodology: Sample 73001 is a 33 cm long, 4 cm diameter regolith sample collected inside a lunar drive tube (~1 mm aluminum walls). That drive tube was sealed inside a 0.5 mm thick stainless steel (SS) CSVC. XCT scans for engineering purposes were done on the Nikon XTH 320 system at Johnson Space Center using the 225 kV multi-metal reflection source at 215 kV, 179 mA, and a 38.49 mm voxel size. Individual &gt;4 mm particles separated from the core during processing (then triply sealed in Teflon bags) were also scanned at JSC using the 180 kV source at 90 kV, 33 mA, and a 2.98 - 10.65 mm voxel size. Whole-core scans were done at the University of Texas High-Resolution X-ray Computed Tomography Facility (UTCT) on the 225 kV reflection source on the North Star Imaging cabinet XCT system. These scans included: (1) a series of 9 overlapping super-resolution scans each covering a ~4 cm length of the tube at 190 kV, 180 µA, and a 12.9 µm voxel size and (2) a lower resolution continuous helical scan of the entire core at 190 kV, 180 µA, and a 51.8 µm voxel size. Progress and Results: Before piercing and extracting the gas from sample 73001, an XCT scan of the bottom portion of the CSVC was used to confirm the location of the Teflon cap on the inner drive tube and whether there was an "air" gap between the Teflon cap and the CSVC. This was to ensure the Teflon cap (which immobilized the soil inside the drive tube) was not accidentally pierced during gas extraction. Similarly, after piercing, the bottom and top portions of the CSVC were scanned in order to capture engineering knowledge about the results of the piercing process, as well as the metal knife edge vacuum seal (SS into an In-Ag alloy). Both scans will provide constraints on future work of this type, both for the design of tools used on the lunar surface during Artemis, as well as how we open future samples of this type. An unexpected finding from these engineering scans was that the device in the drive tube that immobilizes the regolith (the keeper) was not seated in the tube properly. This meant that (1) the drive tube could not be removed from the CSVC for the trip to UTCT, and (2) the procedure for opening and extruding the drive tube had to be modified. Had either of these things not been known prior to opening the CSVC, it could have led to an inability to XCT scan the whole core at high resolution and/or potential disruption of the core stratigraphy during extrusion. At UTCT, the entire length of the core was scanned at high resolution (12.9 microns per voxel). This scan serves multiple purposes: (1) A lower resolution (and uncorrected) version of these scans stitched together was used to help inform the processors of potential pitfalls during extrusion and dissection (voids, angular fragments at the edges of the sample, etc.); and (2) the full resolution corrected data will serve as the permanent in situ record of the stratigraphy of the sample and will enable future researchers to perform a variety of analyses. All 121 &gt;4 mm particles separated during dissection pass 1 of sample 73001 have been individually scanned. These scans clearly show the lithology of each particle while keeping the particles in pristine condition (they are individually triply bagged in Teflon within our N2 purged processing cabinets). Because of the dust adhering to particle exteriors, it would otherwise be impossible to determine lithologies in a non-contaminating way. Thus far the types of lithologies seen in sample 73001 (e.g., regolith breccias, impact-melt breccias, agglutinates, and basalts) are similar to those previously identified in sample 73002 [2]. By the time of the meeting, all particles from all 3 dissection passes will have been scanned and statistics on the different lithologies in 73001 compiled. References: [1] Shearer et al.

An update on the progress of the ANGSA initiative.|Shearer, Charles, Zeigler, Ryan|European Planetary Science Congress|||EPSC2022-747|Introduction:Analyses of samples returned by the Apollo Program have provided fundamental insights into the origin-history of the Earth-Moon system and how planets and solar systems work. Several special samples that were collected or preserved in unique containers or environments (e.g., Core Sample Vacuum Container (CSVC), frozen samples) have remained unexamined by standard or advanced analytical approaches. The Apollo Next Generation Sample Analysis (ANGSA) initiative was designed to examine a subset of these samples. The initiative was purposely designed to function as a participating scientist program for these samples, and as a preparation for new sample return missions from the Moon (e.g., Artemis) with processing, preliminary examination (PE), and analyses utilizing new and advanced technologies, lunar mission observations, and post-Apollo science concepts. ANGSA links the first generations of lunar explorers (Apollo) with future generations of lunar explorers (Artemis) [1-4].Progress and Results:Teamwork for gas extraction from CSVC 73001: To extract any potential gas phase from the CSVC, the European Space Agency (ESA) designed, built, tested, and delivered to JSC a CSVC piercing tool. To collect-store the gas phase, WUStL designed, built, and delivered to JSC a gas manifold system. Together these tools were used to open and sample the CSVC. Preliminary analyses of these gases are being carried out at UNM (Z. Sharp) and WUStL (R. Parai), which will determine whether a lunar component can be detected in the gas.Extrusion of 73001: Following extraction of gas, the lower part of the double drive tube (73001) was imaged (µXCT, multi-spectral imaging), extruded, dissected, sieved, and examined (Pass 1 and 2). Pass 3 will remain unsieved and will be a target for PE by early career ANGSA scientists-engineers. ANGSA team members participated in the PE of 73002.Frozen samples: The cold curation facility for processing Apollo 17 frozen samples was approved in mid-December 2021. These samples were processed and allocated in early 2022. Studies are advancing to define differences in preservation of (a) volatiles between frozen and unfrozen samples; (b) thermoluminescence kinetics in lunar samples [e.g., 5]; and (c) chronology.Stratigraphy of 73001-73002: The stratigraphy of the double drive tube has been examined by multiple approaches. For 73001-73002, the stratigraphy was documented by µXCT imaging [6], reflectance properties [7,8], IS/FeO [8], major, minor, and trace element geochemistry [9,10], grain size/modal proportions [8,11,12], and continuous thin sections [13]. µXCT imaging of lithic fragments: Lithic fragments &gt;4 mm in size were removed from the double drive tube during sampling passes 1-2 (73001-73002); from unsieved Pass 3 &gt; 1cm fragments were removed. µXCT images of hundreds of these lithic fragments were produced. Fragments include a variety of breccias (some with a significant number of spherical glasses), high-Ti basalts with different cooling histories, a variety of "lower-Ti" basalts, and unique lithologies presumably derived from the South Massif. The ANGSA lithic analysis group is carrying out collaborative studies of these fragments [6,14].Less than 1mm lithic fragments: During processing of Passes 1 and 2 from the double drive tube, samples were sieved into &gt; 1 mm and &lt; 1 mm size fractions. The &lt; 1 mm size fractions were further sieved into 1000-500, 500-250, 250-150, 150-90, 90-20, and &lt;20µm size fractions for selected intervals. In addition to determining modes of each size fraction within the stratigraphy, lithic fragments were also classified and documented. Impact melt rocks and breccias were abundant. Igneous lithologies include ferroan anorthosites, Mg-suite, "felsites", low-Ti basalts, pyroclastic glasses, and a variety of high-Ti basalts [11,12,15]. Observations (e.g., volatiles, stable isotopes, organics, cosmogenic radionuclides, space weathering) were placed within the context of core stratigraphy [e.g., 16-21].References: [1] Shearer et al.

One of these samples is an Apollo 17 double drive-tube core (73001/73002) [1], which samples down to 70 cm below the lunar surface within the 'light mantle' unit in the Taurus Littrow Valley (TLV) [2]. Models estimate a low temperature of ~250 K [3] at this depth, conducive for cold-trapping of volatiles. The lower core segment (73001) has been kept within a Core Sample Vacuum Container (CSVC) since 1972 when it was sealed under vacuum at the surface of the Moon [4]. On Earth, CSVC 73001 was sealed in a secondary outer vacuum container (OVC) at a pressure of ~6×10-2 mbar [5]. One of the science goals for Apollo 17 was to target samples that may have trapped gases released from the lunar interior via the Lee-Lincoln fault [1]. The vacuum sealed CSVC 73001 presents a prime opportunity to investigate for such gases. Here we present the preparation and execution of a unique gas extraction event of CSVC 73001, as part of the Apollo Next Generation Sample Analyses (ANGSA) Program. This activity was led by an ANGSA subteam including the European Space Agency (ESA), Washington University St Louis (WUStL), JSC Apollo Sample Curation Facility and University of New Mexico (UNM).Gas Extraction Set-Up &amp; Challenges: A gas extraction set-up was created composed of two main hardware components: a piercing tool, designed and built by ESA, which interfaces with an ultra-high vacuum (UHV, order of pressure, ×10-9 mbar) gas extraction manifold developed and built by WUStL [6]. Technical and scientific challenges for the hardware design include: preserving the pristinity of the regolith and sample gases, avoiding contamination, preventing isotopic fractionation, capability to operate under UHV; accounting for limitations of dexterity when working within a dry N2 glovebox, and delivering on precision piercing of the CSVC stainless steel base without piercing the Teflon cap of the sample holder within.Design and Manufacture: Following a hardware literature review [e.g., 4,7], an 'agile' iterative design approach was undertaken. This included: deriving a set of design requirements based on science, curation and technical needs; experimentally deriving the required piercing force and piercing tip dimension; iterative breadboarding; and regular consultation with ANGSA team members. The piercing tool was machined and manufactured at ESA and the extraction manifold built and calibrated at WUStL. Mechanical testing of the piercing tool under ambient conditions aided operational refinement and piercing tip calibration. Subsequent extensive testing under UHV demonstrated efficient, repeatable use of the piercing tool in meeting the objectives and identified challenges and requirements. The tested hardware underwent stringent cleaning and baking (heated in a vacuum oven at 180ºC for 72 hours) prior to being installed at JSC.Outer Vacuum Container Gas Extraction: The OVC containing the CSVC and constituent sample was interfaced directly with the gas extraction manifold and a 'blank' sample of the background collected under UHV (order of ×10-9 mbar). A 100 cc 'test' aliquot and two gas samples were sequentially collected of the OVC gas, each for a duration of 15 minutes. The OVC gas could be important, if the CSVC may have leaked over the past 50 years. Initial (uncalibrated for system volume) pressures of the OVC sample (order of ×10-2 mbar) are consistent with that of the OVC when it was originally sealed.Piercing the CSVC: The CSVC was extracted from the OVC and rendered XCT images showed the most challenging scenario of the sample holder with the Teflon cap in direct contact with the CSVC base. The CSVC was transferred to the piercing tool and interfaced with the gas extraction manifold (Fig.1). Extensive He-leak testing indicated no atmospheric leaks. Monitoring of pressures and RGA spectra (using a quadrupole mass spectrometer) indicated that the CSVC may be leaking. The manifold was isolated with the system pressure at 8.7×10-9 mbar and the piercing commenced. A satisfying 'pop' marked successful piercing of the CSVC base. Test aliquots (100 cc); two 'short' 15 minute duration samples (uncalibrated pressure, ~6 mbar) and 'long' extraction (~1-2 week duration) samples were collected. Pressures and RGA spectra were monitored throughout from which a set of hypotheses on how well the OVC and the CSVC have performed have been made and will be tested as part of laboratory analyses of the gas. Analyses include determining general gas composition (Z. Sharp at UNM) and noble gas isotope ratios (R. Parai at WUStL). In particular, 20Ne/22Ne and 128Xe/130Xe can assess for presence of lunar gas [8].Findings and Lessons Learned: The full performance of the piercing tool and CSVC is still to be fully assessed. First XCT and optical images of the CSVC base indicate a high-level of tool performance in terms of not having pierced the Teflon cap and producing an adequate size of hole. A baseline set of requirements and sequence of events have been demonstrated for a gas extraction procedure, which is informing a new generation of (volatile-rich) sample return missions (e.g., Artemis; Mars Sample Return). Synthesis of the CSVC performance will also inform development of easy to use containers with longer lasting, contaminant-free seals.Other lessons learned include recommendations to: produce physical duplicates and digital twins of flight hardware; further research into hardware degradation during flight and with time; ensure early definition of mission goals and consultation with science teams and curators (critical for providing clear driving requirements for hardware development); include flexibility in sample container designs and interfaces that account for the entire return sample life-time needs and not just at point of collection.Figure 1: Gas extraction setup composed of an UHV manifold and piercing tool.References: [1] Meyer C.

K.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2020||V017-07|We utilize a step-heated continuous-flow mass spectrometry method to measure the hydrogen isotope concentrations of samples from the sealed Apollo 17 double drive tube 73001/73002 through the ANGSA program. 73001/73002 was sealed after collection on the moon, stored in a dry nitrogen atmosphere, and all processing of material has been done in a dry-nitrogen glovebox. No sample has ever been exposed to terrestrial atmosphere. The bulk hydrogen isotope value of lunar soil has been interpreted as light (-1000‰) hydrogen mixing with at least one of many possible heavier sources, including comets (Greenwood et al., 2011), chondrites (Tartèse &amp; Anand, 2013; Saal et al., 2913) or degassing of H2 (Sharp et al., 2013). The bulk value can be further subdivided into individual soil components, including glass, individual mineral crystals, different breccia types, and agglutinates. Each component has been shown to have distinct concentrations of hydrogen ranging from 4ppm plagioclase crystals to over 100ppm agglutinates (DeMaris et al, 1974), and each may derive their heavy hydrogen component from different sources. <P />Initial measurements have proven the efficacy of our method and shown a detection limit of roughly 100 nanograms of H<SUB>2</SUB> with an error of ±20‰ decreasing to less than ±5‰ at higher concentrations. To date, one 102.4mg aliquot of unsieved rind from the top 1cm of 73002 has been measured, with a total H<SUB>2</SUB> content of 18.4ppm and a δD of -142‰ spallation-corrected to -521‰. Of particular interest was our 0-200°C step, which released no hydrogen. The absence of hydrogen in the lowest step indicates that our processing procedures were successful, and no terrestrial water adsorption occurred in this sample. Our measured H<SUB>2</SUB> content is on the extreme low end for measured lunar soils (8.85 to 35.7ppm; Epstein et al., 1971-1974), but not out of range. According to hydrogen content measurements reported by DeMaris et al in 1974, this would indicate the measured 73002 sample contained a larger fraction of glass, plagioclase crystals, and light breccia, than many other measured samples. An uncorrected bulk H<SUB>2</SUB> δD of -142‰ is on the extreme heavy end of measured lunar soils (-144 to -690‰; Epstein et al., 1971-1974). A heavier δD could also be explained by a larger fraction of breccia fragments and glass than most previously measured soils.|

Although most Apollo samples are well characterized, several types of samples remain wholly or largely unstudied since their return: unopened and/or sealed drive tube samples, samples frozen upon return, and samples stored in a He-purged environment. NASA selected nine teams to participate in the Apollo Next Generation Sample Analysis (ANGSA) Program to study representative samples from each of these categories. <P />The first sample studied as part of the ANGSA program is drive tube 73002, a 4 cm diameter unopened (but unsealed) drive tube collected on a landslide deposit near Lara Crater at the Apollo 17 landing site.

As part of the preliminary examination of sample 73002, the entire drive tube was imaged with a high resolution X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) scan prior to opening and dissecting the sample. Additionally, &gt;50 XCT scans have been made of "large" clasts (&gt;4 mm) removed from the core as part of the ongoing dissection process. <P />Here we will present both the whole drive tube XCT data showing the overall structure of sample 73002 prior to dissection, as well as XCT scans of individual clasts that reveal the types and abundance of different lithologies present within the drive tube.

E.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2020||V017-01|The opportunity to open unstudied and sealed samples from the Apollo 17 mission through the Apollo Next Generation Sample Analysis Program (ANGSA) enables an unprecedented opportunity to study "pristine" samples with 21<SUP>st</SUP> century analytical techniques. ANGSA allows us to use modern remote sensing datasets to constrain what may be contained within a double core tube prior to its detailed analysis (73001/2). Here we use multiple datasets to provide a remote sensing context for Apollo 17's Station 3 (S3), with a focus on the regolith components that are expected in the double core tube. <P />Geologic Context from Recent Remote Observations: <P />Mini-RF Radar data is valuable for assessing regolith properties up the upper meter of the lunar surface. The m-chi deconvolution enables for an assessment of the scattering properties of the regolith and, given the area sampled during Apollo 17, a comparison of regolith properties across the Taurus-Littrow Valley. The regolith at S3 appears to be due to fragments larger than 12.6 cm (l of Mini-RF S-band data), there is a surface and volume scattering component within the upper 1 m of the regolith. There may be more fragments within the upper meter or the deposit is denser due to the emplacement of the light mantle. <P />Compositional data from the Moon Mineralogy Mapper informs our understanding of what may have been sampled in the drive tube. Knowing that there is variability in the sample composition collected at S3, the data shows that the light mantle is homogenous and similar to the South Massif. <P />S3 soils and rock fragments were collected along the rim of Ballet crater within the light-mantle landside from the South Massif. Samples 73001/2 were collected ~15 m from the rim of Ballet crater and samples the light-mantle landslide as well. Nearly all fragments collected from S3 are breccias from the South Massif light mantle. Lithic clasts are composed predominantly of non-mare materials. S3 soils were collected from a trench dug on the rim of Ballet crater. From this trench, 5 soil samples were taken. The trench soils exhibit a distinct marbling of light and darker gray material owing to varying agglutinate content (maturity). The soils are reflective of the light mantle materials as breccia is the most common material in the samples but also contain other fragments of interest including basalt and volcanic glass.|

M., Bullock, E.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2020||V013-0007|Over the last ~4.5 Gyr, particles from the solar wind, the lunar interior, and the wider environment (e.g., solar cosmic rays, galactic cosmic rays, micrometeorites) have directly interacted with and/or been implanted into regolith exposed at the lunar surface. During this time, volatiles and organic compounds have also been added to the lunar regolith as a result of these interactions. For example, volatiles and organic molecules are delivered to the Moon by impacts, and may be produced and/or degraded during the interaction of the solar wind and cosmic rays with surface exposed regolith. Therefore, the regolith provides a unique archive of the processes that have affected the surface of the Moon through time. <P />The Moon United team (as part of the Apollo Next Generation Sample Analysis (ANGSA) consortium) will analyze a variety of particles (impact-melts, basalts and regolith breccias) and bulk soils from several regolith samples collected during the Apollo 17 mission, including two shadowed soils (72320 and 76240) and a double-drive tube (73001/2). These samples provide the opportunity to assess the input budget from the solar wind and exogenous sources, understand exposure histories with depth, and explore how the local region has evolved over time. The petrology (scanning electron microscope), mineral and bulk rock chemistry (electron microprobe), and noble gas budget (mass spectrometry) will be measured for each particle and soil sample. These data will be used to determine parent lithology and constrain the regolith history (e.g., cosmic ray exposure age, maturity, gardening history) of the samples and provide crucial context to the exposure history experienced by volatile and organic compounds within them. These measurements will offer significant value to the ANGSA consortium efforts to understand the complete geologic history of the samples, the Apollo 17 landing site, and lunar processes.|

K.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2020||V013-0005|The oxygen isotope composition of surface samples from the moon has long been of interest. Near-identical Earth and Moon have been a challenging constraint for lunar formation models. <P />The recent release of sealed Apollo 17 double drive tube 73001/73002 (ANGSA program) has allowed the analyses of pristine samples by high-precision laser fluorination. Initial analyses were made on rind-scrapings collected from the surface of the upper 1 cm of Station 3 core sample 73002. Future isotopic/petrologic analyses will be made on sieved samples and lithic fragments. One objective of this study is whether effects of solar wind on lunar surface material exist. Loose bulk samples (n=10) and fragments (n=2) (2 - 4 mg each) were analyzed by laser-assisted fluorination and mass spectrometry. <P />Results show that the average Δ'<SUP>17</SUP>O values (Δ' <SUP>17</SUP>O = δ' <SUP>17</SUP>O - 0.528 × δ ' <SUP>18</SUP>O) of our lunar material and that of bulk silicate Earth (measured in 10 San Carlos olivine standards) are essentially indistinguishable with Δ' <SUP>17</SUP>O<SUB>lunar</SUB> = -0.056‰ vs. Δ' <SUP>17</SUP>O<SUB>BSE</SUB> = -0.053‰. The difference, however, is the Δ' <SUP>17</SUP>O variability: Δ' <SUP>17</SUP>O<SUB>BSE </SUB>1σ s.d. is 0.0056‰ (-0.061 to -0.046‰), whereas Δ'<SUP>17</SUP>O<SUB>lunar</SUB> 1σ s.d. is 0.0103‰ (-0.075 to -0.041‰) - nearly twice as large. This difference indicates that even in this 1 cm interval we clearly have oxygen isotopic variability that is most likely due to mineralogical / lithological variations. Once we have petrologically characterized size fractions, we can assess a possible correlation between that and Δ'<SUP>17</SUP>O values (as also seen by Cano et al., Nature Geoscience 13, 270-274, 2020). <P />We will obtain better vertical resolution with samples from individual depth intervals within the 1 cm section, as well as from depth intervals along the entire length of the 73001/73002 core. "Stratigraphic" Δ' <SUP>17</SUP>O profiles will show whether or not isotopic changes exist as we move away from the immediate lunar surface. The question of solar wind effects, however, can be answered from our initial results: NO. Solar wind, captured by NASA's Genesis mission, has Δ'<SUP>17</SUP>O-values of ~ -30‰ (McKeegan et al., Science 332, 1528-1532, 2011), and, hence, any small contribution to lunar soils would be easily detectable. However, low solar wind input could be offset by sputtering, which raises the δ <SUP>18</SUP>O values (Epstein &amp; Taylor, Proc. LSC 2, 1421-1441, 1971).|

L., Simon, S., Papike, J. J., Shearer, C. K.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2020||V013-0004|With the opening of Apollo 17 double drive tube 73001/73002 as part of the Apollo Next Generation Sample Analysis (ANGSA) program, we present information about the lithologic makeup of rock components of Station 3 regolith. We report compositions and petrologic classification of 2-4 mm rock fragments (73243) of Station 3 trench soil 73240. The trench was 40 m from the rim of 620 m diameter Lara crater and within its ejecta blanket. The drive tube was collected 10 m SE of the trench and 50 m from Lara's rim. Station 3 was selected for its location on the "light mantle" and contains landslide material from South Massif. Soil samples, including 73001/2, an ~70 cm core, offer the possibility to identify lithologic components associated with the landslide, and perhaps ejecta from Tycho crater, the event thought to have triggered the landslide. <P />Known nonmare rock types at Apollo 17 include impact-melt breccias (IMB) of the poikilitic, aphanitic, and incompatible-element-rich types; (2) granulitic breccias; (3) Mg-suite rocks (dunite, troctolite, anorthosite, norite, gabbro); and (4) regolith and fragmental breccias. Rocks from Station 3 include 73215 and 73235 aphanitic IMBs; 73216 and 73218 crystalline IMBs, 73275 poikilitic IMB, and clast-rich IMBs 73217 and 73255. These groups of IMBs have distinctive petrographic and compositional characteristics. The poikilitic IMBs, more abundant in North Massif samples, are those most commonly interpreted to represent Serenitatis impact melt. The aphanitic and unusual IMBs among the station 3 rocks may come from Serenitatis or from another impact basin such as Imbrium. <P />If ejecta from Tycho struck the top of South Massif and caused the South Massif landslide 110 Myr ago, a glass component in the soil might be the best candidate for a remnant of this material. Such a component would have to record the ~110 Myr age associated with cosmic ray exposure evidence at the Apollo 17 site. Given current knowledge of Apollo 17 compositional and lithologic components, Sta. 3 drive tube 73001/2, collected in the light mantle, may provide the best opportunity for a fresh search for Tycho components and a new test of the hypothesis that Tycho ejecta caused the landslide. Of particular interest will be lithic fragments in 73001/2, which may represent regolith samples from different parts of the South Massif slope.|

R., Shearer, C. K.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2020||V013-0003|Station 3 of Apollo 17 was positioned in the light mantle landslide deposit nearly 50m east of Lara Crater in the Taurus-Littrow valley. Among the samples collected from this station was a double-drive tube, which comprises drive tube samples 73002 above 73001. These form part of the Apollo Next Generation Sample Analysis (ANGSA) project. Recently, drive tube 73002 was imaged in its entirety through use of computerized tomography (CT), from which three basalt clasts (,51A, ,51C, and ,80A) were identified. The full CT results will be presented in another abstract in this session <P />Images of these clasts were used to perform ilmenite crystal size distribution (CSD) analyses, a non-destructive method to determine the crystallization history for igneous samples. The CSD data collected for this study uses a process similar to that in Neal et. al, 2015 (GCA 146, 62-80). Several frames captured from the CT scans were imported into Corel Paintshop Pro 2020. Between 800 - 1800 ilmenite crystals were traced and processed for each clast to determine the size distribution and population density of the crystals in each.|

K.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2020||V013-0002|The Apollo Next Generation Sample Analysis (ANGSA) initiative involves the study of previously unopened or uniquely processed lunar samples returned by Apollo missions. Among these samples is the Apollo 17 double drive tube 73001/73002, collected at Station 3 in the landslide deposit ("light mantle", LM) at the base of South Massif. <P />Grain mounts from 73001/73002 are not yet available but to improve our understanding of its geologic context and the geology of the Apollo 17 site we studied four surface soils collected during lunar roving vehicle (LRV) traverses. Two (72141 and 74121, from stations LRV-2 and LRV-6, resp.) are from the LM and two (72150 and 75111, from LRV-3 and LRV-7, resp.) are from the mare floor immediately adjacent to the LM. A polished grain mount of the 90-150 µm fraction of each soil was studied with a scanning electron microscope and electron probe. Until now only modal, maturity, and bulk chemical data were available for these samples. <P />We found that 72141 surprisingly lacks the Mg-rich, Ca-poor pyroxenes found in the other soils considered here. Most of the plagioclase grains in the LM soils are more calcic than An<SUB>89</SUB> and are probably derived from highland rocks. Both LM soils have olivine more forsteritic than Fo<SUB>90</SUB>, suggesting a troctolitic source. One grain of pink spinel was found in 74121, also indicative of a plutonic component. Pink spinel lithologies have also been found at other locations in the LM (Stations 2 and 3). The pyroxene populations in the valley floor soils extend to more Fe-rich compositions than those from the LM, owing to their larger mare basalt components, and are comparable to that of Sculptured Hills soil 78221. The minimum highland fraction of pyroxene, on the basis of quadrilateral components, is very low in all soils studied. Orange glass beads with compositions indistinguishable from that of 74220 were found in all samples except 74121. <P />In addition to the glasses and monomineralic grains the samples contain fragments of high-Ti mare basalts and various non-mare lithologies such as recrystallized noritic breccias, crystalline matrix breccias, and feldspathic plutonic rocks. The lithic fragment populations are typical of Apollo 17 regolith. These samples and those from the Station 3 trench will provide a valuable basis for comparison with the new samples from the 73001/73002 drive tube.|

M., Zeigler, R. A., Gross, J.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2020||V013-0001|The Apollo Program returned 382 kg of samples. Some special samples that were collected or preserved in unique containers or environments remain unexamined since they were sealed or initially processed. These samples include material sealed on the lunar surface in vacuum containers, frozen samples, and samples processed in an organically clean glovebox and stored under helium. The goal of the ANGSA initiative is to examine a subset of these special samples to fulfil some of the proposed but never achieved Apollo mission science objectives (e.g., degassing from scarps) and to enable future science that will be carried out during the Artemis program (e.g., lunar volatile cycle). The initiative was purposely designed to function as a "new" sample return mission with processing, preliminary examination, and analyses utilizing new and improved technologies and recent mission observations. One of the samples that is being examined by the ANGSA consortium is the Apollo 17 double drive tube soil core 73001/73002 that penetrated a landslide deposit to a depth of up to 70 cm. Sample 73001 is the deeper part of the core and it was sealed on the lunar surface in a Core Sample Vacuum Container (CSVC). The temperature at the bottom of the core was approximately 250K when collected. We will summarize the results of the ANGSA team's progress in processing these double drive tube samples, documenting the lithologies found during curation and preliminary examination, analyzing the initial samples, and placing samples within local geologic and planetary contexts. These data will improve our understanding of the volatile cycles on the Moon, the role of volatiles in lunar processes, dynamics and chronology of lunar tectonics and landslide deposits, and evolution of the regolith.|

A.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2019||P31C-3480|The lunar regolith is the boundary between the surface of the Moon and the dynamic space environment. As a result, the regolith preserves an archive of processes that have modified the surface of the Moon over the last ~4 billion years. Of particular interest to us is the impact history of the Moon, preserved as clasts of impact-melted materials created in impact crater events. These clasts date the creation of the impact crater and build a statistical view of the lunar bombardment history. However, the repeated burial, exhumation and transportation (i.e., 'gardening') of the regolith plays a major role in redistributing impact-melt samples. The gardening process may affect the location and preservation of impact-melt rocks in the regolith, which could bias the age distribution of samples collected at the surface. For example, many older (e.g., &gt;3.9 Ga) impact-melt rocks experienced much longer residency in the regolith, potentially being diluted by subsequently-deposited material and making older rocks volumetrically rare at the surface. The opposite may be true for younger impact-melt rocks, particularly if the samples were collected near small, young craters. <P />Double-drive tubes present an opportunity to investigate the age distribution of populations of impact-melt rocks with depth in the regolith and to evaluate the effect of gardening. We have begun this work on Apollo sample 68001/68002. We separated 50-70 particles (250+ μm size fraction) from six compositionally distinct horizons extending to ~70 cm below the surface, including particles from the immediate surface. We grouped the particles from each horizon based on texture, major element, and trace-element, and determined the parent lithology for each group. We will measure the crystallization age (Ar-Ar dating), maturity and cosmic-ray exposure age to understand the regolith history of each particle during its lifetime in the lunar regolith. <P />We will apply these techniques to particles from unopened and unstudied Apollo double-drive tube 73001 as part of the Apollo Next Generation Sample Analysis (ANGSA) Program. Determining the regolith history for these two double-drive tubes will allow direct comparison of the parentage of impact-melt rocks and their exposure histories at the Apollo 16 and Apollo 17 landing site.|
