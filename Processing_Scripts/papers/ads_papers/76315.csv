2022EPSC...16..348L|2022|3D reconstruction of lunar rock samples collected at North Massif Station 6 during the Apollo 17 mission|Le Mouélic, Stéphane, Macquet, Louis, Schmitt, Harrison, Mangold, Nicolas, Caravaca, Gwénaël, Seignovert, Benoît, Le Menn, Erwan|European Planetary Science Congress|||EPSC2022-348|The Apollo 17 manned mission landed in the Taurus Littrow valley on the Moon in December 1972. The geology of this site, on the eastern edge of Mare Serenitatis, was thoroughly investigated during extra vehicular activities performed during three days spent at the surface [1, 2]. A total of 111 kg of well-documented rock and soil samples were collected and brought back to Earth during this last Apollo mission. Among several waypoints of interest, astronauts spent more than one hour to investigate five large boulder fragments at Station 6, lying at the base of a long boulder trail descending from the North Massif. These boulders might originate in material emplaced as a result from the ejected melt sheet from the Crisium impact event [2], or Serenitatis impact event [3, 4]. In a recent study [5], we used scanned photographs taken in situ with astronaut's Hasselblad cameras to reconstruct a 3D model of each of the boulders using photogrammetry techniques [6].In addition to the 3D reconstruction of the boulders themselves reported in [5], we pushed the reconstruction process one step further by taking advantage of the fact that the rock samples hammered from the boulders at Station 6 were thoroughly documented once brought back on Earth in the Lunar Receiving Lab facility in Houston. In particular, several stereoscopic photographic pairs were systematically acquired for a significant number of the samples. When a sufficient number of viewpoints have been acquired, this potentially allows a complete photogrammetric 3D reconstruction of the rocks themselves. We used as input original photographs available on the Lunar and Planetary Institute website (https://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/samples/atlas/). We first performed a color balancing of the scans of these photos. Then, masks corresponding to a detouring of the rocks were applied to avoid errors induced by the fixed background in the photogrammetric project. By manually adding tie points, we were able to compute a detailed textured 3D model of sample 76315 (a micropoikilitic impact melt breccia), sample 76215 (a vesicular micropoikilitic impact melt breccia), and sample 76015 (another vesicular micropoikilitic impact melt breccia, which was chipped off top corner of Block 5 of the big boulder at Station 6). The full reconstruction process is illustrated in Fig. 1 for sample 76215. We have posted the 3D models of these samples on the Sketchfab web platform at https://sketchfab.com/LPG-3D to allow their easy visual inspection. These 3D models are of particular interest as these lunar samples have been broken into multiple pieces after being photographed. The 3D numerical model can therefore be thought as a kind of historical heritage of the original rocks, which do not exist anymore in their original form. Using this reconstruction, we can obtain a copy of the shape of these original rocks using a 3D-Printer (Fig. 2). They can also be viewed using augmented reality, with a cellphone or a tablet, or even manipulated in virtual reality on Sketchfab using a VR headset (Fig 2). From a more scientific point of view, the 3D models theoretically allow to replace the samples in their original position and orientation directly on the 3D models of the original boulders themselves (Fig 3). This is of particular interest to retrieve the precise original orientation of the sample, to investigate for example the characteristics of coatings. On sample 76015, at least three different units show various degree of alteration, which can be correlated with the original position of the sample with respect to its environment. The upper sky-facing side is the most affected by space weathering effects, with a well-developed patina. On its lower edge, a less altered face protected by a crevice might correspond to a lower alteration degree developed during only 20 million years, the approximate age of the impact generating the fall of the boulders from the North Massif slopes according to radiogenic dating.

V., Jolliff, B. L., Van Soest, M. C., Wartho, J. A., Weirich, J. R.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2015||P33C-2136|Several boulders located at the bases of the North and South Massifs were among the primary field targets of the Apollo 17 mission to the Taurus-Littrow Valley on the Moon [1]. Some boulders are polylithologic, including Boulder 1 at Station 2 and the boulders at Stations 6 and 7. These boulders were the subjects of consortium studies [2, 3] that included 40Ar/39Ar geochronology to determine the ages of distinct lithologies within each boulder [e.g., 4-6]. We report new 40Ar/39Ar data for the impact melt breccias 72255, 76315, 77075, and 77135 obtained using the UV laser ablation microprobe (UVLAMP) methods of [7]. For 72255, we obtained a preliminary isochron date ca. 3814 Ma from 22 melt analyses, which is younger than published plateau dates (e.g., 3951-3835 Ma [4, 8]). Fifteen melt analyses of 76315 yield a preliminary isochron date ca. 3850 Ma, younger than the 3900 ± 16 Ma date reported by [8]. Melt analyses of 77075 yield preliminary dates between ca. 3797-3584 Ma, possibly reflecting partial loss of 40Ar. In this case, the oldest date may provide a minimum age for the formation of melt in 77075. Finally, the UVLAMP dates for the 77135 melt range from 3810-3361 Ma and corresponding Ca/K ratios range from ca. 100-6. Electron microprobe analyses of small (ca. 10s of microns wide) pockets of K-rich materials show that both K-rich glass and K-feldspar are present. The UVLAMP dates for 77135 likely reflect spatially variable 40Ar loss, consistent with published step heating results [e.g., 6]. References: [1] Schmitt (1973) Science, 182, 681-690.

Brent, Ryder, Graham|Journal of Geophysical Research|101|E11|26069|We have obtained high-resolution (21-63 steps) <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/<SUP>39</SUP>Ar age spectra using a continuous laser system on 19 submilligram samples of melt rocks and clasts from Apollo 17 samples collected from the pre-Imbrian highlands in the easternmost part of the Serenitatis basin. The samples include poikilitic melt rocks inferred to have been formed in the Serenitatis basin-forming impact, aphanitic melt rock whose compositions vary and whose provenance is uncertain, and granulite, gabbro, and melt clasts. Three of the poikilitic melts have similar age spectrum plateau ages (72395,96, 3893+/-16 Ma (2σ) 72535, 7, 3887+/-16 Ma; 76315, 150, 3900+/-16 Ma) with a weighted mean age of 3893+/-9 Ma, which we interpret as the best age for the Serenitatis basin-forming impact. Published <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/<SUP>39</SUP>Ar age spectrum ages of Apollo 17 poikilitic melts are consistent with our new age but are much less precise. Two poikilitic melts did not give plateaus and the maxima in their age spectra indicate ages of &gt;=3869 Ma (72558,7) and &gt;=3743 Ma (77135,178). Plateau ages of two poikilitic melts and two gabbro clasts from 73155 range from 3854+/-16 Ma to 3937+/-16 Ma and have probably been affected by the ubiquitous (older?) clasts and by post-formation heating (impact) events. Plateau ages from two of the aphanitic melt ``blobs'' and two granulites in sample 72255 fall in the narrow range of 3850+/-16 Ma to 3869+/-16 Ma with a weighted mean of 3862+/-8 Ma. Two of the aphanitic melt blobs from 72255 have ages of 3883+/-16 Ma and &gt;=3894 Ma, whereas a poikilitic melt clast (of different composition from the ``Serenitatis'' melts) has an age of 3835+/-16 Ma, which is the upper limit for the accretion of 72255. These data suggest that either the aphanitic melts vary in age, as is also suggested by their varying chemical compositions, or they formed in the 72255 accretionary event about 3.84-3.85 Ga and older relict material is responsible for the dispersion of ages. In any case the aphanitic melts do not appear to be Serenitatis products. Our age for the Serenitatis impact shows, on the basis of the isotopic age evidence alone, that Serenitatis is &gt;20-25 Ma and probably &gt;55-60 Ma older than Imbrium (&lt;=3870 Ma and probably &lt;=3836 Ma [Dalrymple and Ryder, 1993]). Noritic granulite sample 78527 has a plateau age of 4146+/-17 Ma, representing a minimum age for cooling of this sample in the early lunar crust. So far there is no convincing evidence in the lunar melt rock record for basin-forming impacts significantly older than 3.9 Ga.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/96JE02806
1992ga17.conf...42N|1992|Lithologies Contributing to the Clast Population in Apollo 17 LKFM Basaltic Impact Melts|Norman, Marc D., Taylor, G. Jeffrey, Spudis, Paul, Ryder, Graham|Geology of the Apollo 17 Landing Site|||42|LKFM basaltic impact melts are abundant among Apollo lunar samples, especially those from Apollo 15, 16, and 17. They are generally basaltic in composition, but are found exclusively as impact melts. They seem to be related to basins and so could represent the composition of the lower lunar crust. They contain lithic clasts that cannot be mixed in any proportion to produce the composition of the melt matrix; components rich in transition elements (Ti, Cr, Sc) and REE are not considered. To search for the mysterious cryptic component, we previously investigated the mineral clast population in two Apollo 14 LKFM basaltic impact melts, 15445 and 15455. The cryptic component was not present in the mineral clast assemblage of these breccias either, but some olivine and pyroxene grains appeared to be from lithologies not represented among identified igneous rocks from the lunar highlands. In addition, none of the mineral clasts could be unambiguously assigned to a ferroan anorthosite source. We have now extended this study to Apollo 17, starting with two LKFM impact melt breccias (76295 and 76315) from the Apollo 17 station 6 boulder. The results from the study are presented.|

It is found that many of the complex multiphase structures of the metal particles observed in the study cannot be explained by a continuous two-stage cooling of the impact-melt sheet. It is suggested that at least locally the boulder samples must have experienced multistage cooling and heating.|

Fractions of the Cl, Br, and Hg that are mobilized by water leaching and/or volatilization at moderate temperatures (⩽450°C) place constraints on the thermal history of Boulder 1 and its component breccias. Since, and possibly during, consolidation, the boulder has probably not been subjected to temperatures of ⩾450°C. The parent rocks of the Apollo 17 boulder and breccia samples studied could have been derived from two initial magmas. Boulder 1, Station 2 gray competent breccias 72255 and 72275 Clast #2 appear to be genetically unrelated to gray competent breccia and anorthositic material 72215, or to light friable breccia 72275; they do appear to be related to samples 72395 (Boulder 2) and 76315 (Station 6 boulder). Vapor clouds from apparently external sources permeated the source regions of the boulders.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00569672
