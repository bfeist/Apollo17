2002E&PSL.202..217N|2002|Targeting the impactors: siderophile element signatures of lunar impact melts from Serenitatis|Norman, Marc D., Bennett, Vickie C., Ryder, Graham|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|202|2|217|Highly siderophile element compositions of lunar impact melt breccias provide a unique record of the asteroid population responsible for large cratering events in the inner Solar System. Melt breccias associated with the 3.89 Ga Serenitatis impact basin resolve at least two separate impact events. KREEP-rich melt breccias representing the Apollo 17 poikilitic suite are enriched in highly siderophile elements (3.6-15.8 ppb Ir) with CI-normalized patterns that are elevated in Re, Ru and Pd relative to Ir and Pt. The restricted range of lithophile element compositions combined with the coherent siderophile element signatures indicate formation of these breccias in a single impact event involving an EH chondrite asteroid, probably as melt sheet deposits from the Serenitatis Basin. One exceptional sample, a split from melt breccia 77035, has a distinctive lithophile element composition and a siderophile element signature more like that of ordinary chondrites, indicating a discrete impact event. The recognition of multiple impact events, and the clear signatures of specific types of meteoritic impactors in the Apollo 17 melt breccias, shows that the lunar crust was not comprehensively reworked by prior impacts from 3.9 to 4.5 Ga, an observation more consistent with a late cataclysm than a smoothly declining accretionary flux. Late accretion of enstatite chondrites during a 3.8-4.0 Ga cataclysm may have contributed to siderophile element heterogeneity on the Earth, but would not have made a significant contribution to the volatile budget of the Earth or oxidation of the terrestrial mantle. Siderophile element patterns of Apollo 17 poikilitic breccias become more fractionated with decreasing concentrations, trending away from known meteorite compositions to higher Re/Ir and Pd/Pt ratios. The compositions of these breccias may be explained by a two-stage impact melting process involving: (1) deep penetration of the Serenitatis impactor into meteorite-free lower crust, followed by (2) incorporation of upper crustal lithologies moderately contaminated by prior meteoritic infall into the melt sheet. Trends to higher Re/Ir with decreasing siderophile element concentrations may indicate an endogenous lunar crustal component, or a non-chondritic late accretionary veneer in the pre-Serenitatis upper crust.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0012-821X(02)00780-X
2001AGUFM.V21D..04B|2001|Targeting the (3.8-4.0 Ga) Impactors: Siderophile Element Signatures of Lunar Impact Melts|Bennett, V., Norman, M., Ryder, G.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2001||V21D-04|Significant gaps remain in our understanding of the early impact history of the Earth and Moon, and their influence on geologic and biologic development. Outstanding controversies include whether or not the Moon, and by inference the early Earth, was hit by an unusually heavy "terminal cataclysm" of collisions during the period 3.8 to 4.0 Ga, and the number of large impact events represented by lunar samples. Coincidentally or not, the large nearside lunar basins are almost identical in age with the oldest terrestrial rocks, and are therefore relevant for consideration of the possible role of impacts in shaping the terrestrial continents and early life environments. To improve our understanding of the impact history of the Moon and to provide new information about the types of planetesimals that were involved in the early impact history of the inner Solar System, we measured the concentrations of highly siderophile elements (HSE: Re, Ir, Pt, Pd, Ru) in a suite of Apollo 17 impact melt breccias using high precision ID-ICPMS methods. These breccias all have poikilitic textures, relatively mafic bulk compositions, and high levels of incompatible trace elements and all likely represent ejecta from the Serenitatis basin. Ar-Ar ages are consistent with the formation of these breccias in a single impact event at 3893 +/- 9 Ma. HSE from 11 representative samples have W-shaped patterns on CI-normalized diagrams, with enrichments in Re, Ru and Pd relative to Ir and Pt, and absolute abundances ranging from \sim0.5 to 4% of CI reference values. Stronger depletions of Ir and Pt relative to Re, Ru, and Pd are correlated with decreasing HSE concentrations. The samples with the highest HSE concentrations have patterns that are identical to those of EH chondrites, but the patterns become increasingly less diagnostic of meteorite group with decreasing concentrations. The systematic variation of HSE patterns with decreasing concentration suggests that simple chemical fingerprints of impactor type using individual samples can potentially give misleading results and consideration of impact-related fractionation using high precision data for suites of impact breccias is required. An additional sample (77035) has a distinctly different HSE pattern and is more consistent with an impactor of ordinary or EL-type chondrite composition. It likely represents a discrete impact event that was sampled at the Apollo 17 site. The clear recognition of specific and different types of meteoritic impactors indicates a diverse population of planetesimals bombarded the Moon, and that the lunar crust was not heavily contaminated with HSE prior to 3.8-4.0 Ga, a feature more consistent with a late cataclysm than a smoothly declining accretionary flux.|
