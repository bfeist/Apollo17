K.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2020||V013-0002|The Apollo Next Generation Sample Analysis (ANGSA) initiative involves the study of previously unopened or uniquely processed lunar samples returned by Apollo missions. Among these samples is the Apollo 17 double drive tube 73001/73002, collected at Station 3 in the landslide deposit ("light mantle", LM) at the base of South Massif. <P />Grain mounts from 73001/73002 are not yet available but to improve our understanding of its geologic context and the geology of the Apollo 17 site we studied four surface soils collected during lunar roving vehicle (LRV) traverses. Two (72141 and 74121, from stations LRV-2 and LRV-6, resp.) are from the LM and two (72150 and 75111, from LRV-3 and LRV-7, resp.) are from the mare floor immediately adjacent to the LM. A polished grain mount of the 90-150 Âµm fraction of each soil was studied with a scanning electron microscope and electron probe. Until now only modal, maturity, and bulk chemical data were available for these samples. <P />We found that 72141 surprisingly lacks the Mg-rich, Ca-poor pyroxenes found in the other soils considered here. Most of the plagioclase grains in the LM soils are more calcic than An<SUB>89</SUB> and are probably derived from highland rocks. Both LM soils have olivine more forsteritic than Fo<SUB>90</SUB>, suggesting a troctolitic source. One grain of pink spinel was found in 74121, also indicative of a plutonic component. Pink spinel lithologies have also been found at other locations in the LM (Stations 2 and 3). The pyroxene populations in the valley floor soils extend to more Fe-rich compositions than those from the LM, owing to their larger mare basalt components, and are comparable to that of Sculptured Hills soil 78221. The minimum highland fraction of pyroxene, on the basis of quadrilateral components, is very low in all soils studied. Orange glass beads with compositions indistinguishable from that of 74220 were found in all samples except 74121. <P />In addition to the glasses and monomineralic grains the samples contain fragments of high-Ti mare basalts and various non-mare lithologies such as recrystallized noritic breccias, crystalline matrix breccias, and feldspathic plutonic rocks. The lithic fragment populations are typical of Apollo 17 regolith. These samples and those from the Station 3 trench will provide a valuable basis for comparison with the new samples from the 73001/73002 drive tube.|
2013AGUFM.P54B..05S|2013|Lunar Regolith Maturity Controlled By Ilmenite Content And Micro-Meteor Flux Variability|Schmitt, H. H.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2013||P54B-05|Synthesis of Is/FeO maturity indexes for Apollo 17 regolith samples in the valley of Taurus-Littrow on the Moon indicate that high levels of ilmenite in the samples significantly reduces the level of this indicator of space exposure. The analysis, along with consideration of regolith glass characteristics, also discloses that micro-meteor fluxes vary over geologic time, presumably in response to significant impact events in the Asteroid Belt. Surface samples of ilmenite-poor, silicate-rich regolith have about 80-90% higher maturity indexes than surface samples of ilmenite-rich, basaltic regolith of comparable exposure. For comparison of the history of various regolith exposures to the space environment, Taurus-Littrow's light mantle avalanche deposit, the youngest large area stratigraphic unit, provides a specific time horizon. For at least the last ~110 million years, the currently estimated age of the light mantle avalanche, most near surface (upper 1-5cm) regolith has had approximately the same exposure to micro-meteors. The surface of the largely ilmenite-rich basalt fill in the valley has been exposed to space at least as long or possibly 30 million years longer than the light mantle, based on exposure ages for large boulder ejecta in the Camelot cluster of craters. High apparent maturity (Is/FeO &gt;80), however, exists only on three types of regolith surfaces: (1) the North Massif apron (e.g., 77431), (2) the light mantle avalanche deposit (e.g., 72161), and (3) low ilmenite basalt (e.g., 72150). Only intermediate to low maturity (Is/FeO &lt;60) has developed in surface regolith overlying high titanium basalt (e.g., 70181). TiO2/TiO2+FeO ratios provide a good measure of original ilmenite content, ilmenite being the only quantitatively significant titanium-bearing mineral in the regolith. Those ratios for samples showing high and intermediate apparent maturity are about 0.35 and 0.25, respectively. A well documented, 3.5 billion year old basaltic regolith (77240, 77260) exposed at Shorty Crater as a unit stratigraphically overlying the orange ash, has exceptionally low maturity (8% agglutinates and Is/FeO = 5) but an unusually high amount of "ropy" glass (14-18%). (Ropy glass normally constitutes less than on percent of new Taurus-Littrow regolith. It forms within fresh impact craters as a result of macro-meteor impacts, but the current flux of micro-meteors disaggregates such glass within a million years or less.) The light mantle avalanche deposit protected this ancient regolith unit at Shorty Crater for at up to 90 million years prior to the Shorty impact 14-17 million years ago. A significant micro-meteor flux cannot have existed during the formation of this ancient regolith or it would have a higher maturity index and little or no ropy glass. Variable maturities observed in core samples from elsewhere in the valley of Taurus-Littrow may be the result of either variable mirco-meteor flux or variable exposure during periods of moderate flux or a combination of both.|
