P., Baker, D. M. H.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2018||P23E-3500|Observations of the Taurus-Littrow Valley by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M<SUP>3</SUP>) instrument have enabled new interpretations of the geology of the Apollo 17 landing site. A recent investigation by Schmitt et al. [2017] characterized a debris deposit located at the base of the North Massif and at the expression of an apparent fissure that transects the massif. The main debris deposit is 50 meters thick and is 2 x 2 km across. A more extensive debris apron extending to the South covers an area including Victory Crater, and may be a source of samples 75111 and 75121 (LRV-8). Additionally, 75121 and 75111 may have an enhanced KREEP component (Th and U) by 5x relative to Shorty crater ash and basalt samples, but lower than North Massif melt by 5x, consistent with the addition of Mg-rich material. Mini-RF and Diviner data from LRO suggests that the deposit is block-free within the upper 1 m. Using data from M<SUP>3</SUP> we have characterized the composition of this deposit, identifying it as unique compared to other areas of the valley floor or massifs. On the basis of the 1 and 2 µm pyroxene absorption bands, the deposits composition is Mg-rich compared to the basalts in Taurus-Littrow and is unlike the mafic materials in the Sculptured Hills [Schmitt et al., 2017]. It is unclear how much of this deposit may have been sampled at Victory Crater. Korotev and Kremser [1992] identify a Mg-enhancement in soils from Camelot Crater and conclude that the soils contain "an unidentified magnesian lithology or… primitive basalt different from typical high-Ti mare basalt." We conclude that the debris deposit at the base of the North Massif represents the source of this enhancement and is a late-stage volcanic deposit from the fissure. Based on M<SUP>3</SUP> data this material is compositionally similar in composition to a high-Mg volcanic unit within the South Pole-Aitken Basin [Moriarty and Pieters, 2018]. <P />References: <P />Korotev, R.
