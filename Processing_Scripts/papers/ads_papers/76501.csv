C.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|12||371|A progress report is presented concerning an investigation involving a comprehensive chemical and petrologic study of surface soils from all nine lunar sampling sites. The soils selected for this study are part of the lunar highlands soils suite and represent the soils at each site that contain abundant highland-derived material. The current report takes into consideration, in addition to the eight soils discussed by Labotka et al. (1980) and by Laul and Papike (1980), three Apollo 17 soils (72501, 76501, and 78221), and three Luna soils (21000, L-16; 22001, L-20; and 24999, L-24). Attention is given to the modal petrology of the 1000-90 micrometer fraction of all 14 soils, and the modes and mineral and glass chemistries of the 90-20 and 20-10 micrometer fractions of the Apollo 17 and Luna soils. In an evaluation of the obtained results, it is found that except for rare, large-scale impacts, lateral mixing is an inefficient process. Comminution and vertical mixing appear to be the dominant process.|

R.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1389|Isotopic lead data from bulk samples of Apollo 17 soils were analyzed, and they define a chord in a concordia diagram, showing the presence of a component or components containing excess radiogenic lead with Pb-207/Pb-206 equal to about 1.32. The chord is distinctly different from the cataclysm chord, for which Pb-207/Pb-206 is approximately 1.45. Nitric acid analysis of plagioclase indicates lead ages of around 4.35 AE, in agreement with previous findings. Agglutinates from soil 76501,34 show loss of approximately 15% of lead.|
