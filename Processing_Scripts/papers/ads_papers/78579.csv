R.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2018||P13B-03|The Apollo 17 high-Ti basalts were originally classified into types on the basis of whole rock data. Initial types were A, B, C, and U. Type U represented unclassified basalts or those of uncertain affiliation. Four different types of volcanic glass have been described from the Apollo 17 sample collection based on color and composition: VLT, Green, Yellow, and Orange. There are three subdivisions of the orange glasses, based upon major elements. <P />An elemental database of analyses from the Apollo 17 basaltic samples (i.e., both glasses and crystalline basalts) has been compiled in an attempt to re-examine the origins of the crystalline basalts and glasses. This study also highlights those samples where more data are required to properly classify them. The database was used to create results for elements that are common to both basalts and glasses. The "Unclassified" Type U samples were examined on several plots (e.g., La vs. La/Sm, Fig. 1) and assigned to Types A, B1, B2, C, and D depending on their affinities. Where multiple analyses were reported for these samples, averages were taken and data were only omitted if the analysis was clearly different from the others that have been reported. Remarkably, only 4 samples (70035, 74235, 75035, 78579) did not plot consistently with the designated groups from Figure 1 and require more sophisticated analyses (larger sample mas needs to be homogenized). <P />The data show the following: <P />- Type B1 and B2 high-Ti basalts are distinct; <P />- Two new Type D basalts are defined (71597 and 78508 in addition to 79001); <P />- Type A, B1 and C basalts fall on the same trends, as do Types B2 and D; <P />- Orange glass groups are distinct from high-Ti mare basalts; <P />- VLT glasses are similar in composition to the average VLT basalt compositions. <P />Ratios of REE and HFSE elements demonstrate that these basaltic materials are derived from distinct sources. This can also be extended to the transition elements, but these can also be used to demonstrate that the crystalline basalt and glass groups are highly fractionated. The data from the Apollo 17 basaltic samples has allowed us to demonstrate mantle heterogeneity beneath Taurus Littrow. However, the magmas produced from these sources underwent similar evolutionary pathways.|
