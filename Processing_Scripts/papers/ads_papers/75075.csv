H.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2018||P13B-05|Paleomagnetic studies of lunar samples collected during the Apollo missions suggest the Moon generated a core dynamo for at least 2 billion years. The early lunar dynamo (4.25 - 3.56 Ga) was intense, recording paleointensities of 20 - 110 µT. The lunar dynamo field subsequently declined to 5 ± 2 µT at 2.5 - 1 Ga. The strength and longevity of this dynamo field is challenging to explain via a single mechanism. Thermal convection could not have driven a dynamo for such a sustained period of time, whilst thermochemical convection during core solidification is unlikely to have started so early. <P />There is also debate surrounding the dipolar nature of the lunar magnetic field. A recent study of lunar crustal magnetization inferred paleopoles oriented with both the rotation axis and the equator. Providing a robust constraint on the direction of the lunar magnetic field over time is essential for establishing: (a) the mechanism by which the lunar dynamo was driven, (b) whether the magnetic field underwent reversals, and (c) whether the Moon experienced true polar wander. <P />Here we present new results for the paleoinclination and paleointensity of the lunar magnetic field recorded 3.8 Ga by Apollo samples 75055 and 75075, respectively. These samples were collected during the Apollo 17 mission at Camelot crater. They were sampled from boulders which are thought to represent an overturned flap formed during impact cratering or else nearly in-place subfloor basalts exposed by recent mass-wasting. <P />At the latitude of the Camelot crater (20.19 °N), a dipolar field aligned along the rotation axis would have had a paleoinclination of 36.3°. Using alternating field demagnetization techniques on a 2G SQUID magnetometer in the MIT Paleomagnetism Laboratory, sample 75055 returned a paleoinclination of 38.6 ± 13.5° suggesting the Moon had a dipolar, dynamo-generated field that was stable for extended periods of time. <P />Preliminary results from sample 75075, which was analysed using the same methods, suggest this sample experienced a very weak magnetic field (0 ± 2 μT), despite acquiring remanence during the high intensity epoch. This supports a recent theoretical proposal that the early lunar dynamo may have been intermittently weak during the period before 3.56 Ga due to a lack of sufficient energy for continuously driving a high intensity magnetic field.|

Based on SEM petrography, we have defined three textural types of patina: glazed, fragmental, and classic (cratered). The presence of classic patina is diagnostic of lunar samples that have been exposed directly to the space weathering environment. It is characterized by the presence of microcraters and glass pancakes, and is the patina type studied by earlier workers. Classic patina is found on 76015 but not on 75075. Glazed patina is found on both 76015 and 75075, while fragmental patina is found only on 75075. The glazed and fragmental patinas on 75075 were probably formed as a result of relatively large nearby impacts, and although these two types of patina are not strictly the result of direct exposure to the space weathering environment, they are important because they affect the optical properties of the rocks. Field emission gun SEM (FE-SEM) of classic patina on 76015 shows evidence of possible solar wind sputtering erosion. TEM studies of 76015 reveal the presence of impact-generated deposits and solar flare particle tracks which, like microcraters and pancakes, are diagnostic of direct exposure to space weathering processes. The outermost surface of the 76015 patina consists of an amorphous rim very much like the rims found on individual lunar soil grains; this amorphous patina rim probably formed by similar processes of impact-generated vapor condensation and possible sputter deposition. Wavelength-dispersive X-ray (WDS) element maps of polished thin sections of 75075 and 76015 indicate that patina compositions are poor indicators of the compositions and mineralogies of the rocks underlying them. On average, the reflectance spectra of patinas on both samples are slightly darker than those of their unweathered equivalents. Microreflectance measurements show that a thick patina can dramatically alter the optical properties of the rock on which it forms. The backscatter MöF6ssbauer (BaMS) spectrum of a patina-covered surface of 76015 is very similar to that of an unweathered surface, indicating that the Mössbauer signal is generated from beneath the patina. Because BaMS "sees" through surface space-weathering effects to the underlying rock, this technique has great potential for use in robotic missions to other planetary bodies.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1945-5100.1999.tb01366.x

Accretionary microcratered pancake-bearing (AMP) patina, found on 76015 is characterized by the presence of microcraters and glass pancakes (small circular glass splashes) in all size ranges. These microcraters and pancakes are evidence of direct exposure to space, as are solar flare tracks and possible solar wind sputtering erosion. The other two types of patina we recently defined, which were found on mare basalt 75075, include accretionary coalesced (AC) patina, consisting of thin discontinuous layers of glass, and accretionary welded fragmental (AWF) patina, made up of accreted layers of rounded, well-sorted mineral and glass grains. The AC and AWF patinas on 75075 showed no evidence of microcraters, pancakes, or any direct interaction with the solar wind.|

S.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference|27||1423|A number of rocks in the lunar sample collection have surface patinas which formed as a result of exposure to the space weathering environment on the surface of the moon. It is important to understand patinas and their relationships to the rocks on which they formed because it is likely that patinas on surface- exposed rocks on the moon and other planetary bodies would affect data obtained by either remote sensing or unmanned landers. We have undertaken a multidisciplinary study of patinas on selected Apollo samples using a wide range of techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), backscattered electron imaging (BEI), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), backscatter Mossbauer spectrometry (BaMS), spectral reflectance spectroscopy, ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) analysis, and wavelength dispersive spectrometry (WDS). SEM/EDX results for patina on high-Ti mare basalt 75075 were reported by McKay et al in LPSC XXVI. Our current focus is on the patina on crystalline matrix breccia 76015. Our initial results show that the 76015 patina is very complex with characteristics that vary widely over a short distance. The 76015 patina is a good example of classic patina with typical lunar surface exposure features such as microcraters and glass pancakes, and is defined here as accretionary microcratered pancake-bearing (AMP) patina.|

The ɛNd142 values show very small variations attributable to <SUP>146</SUP>Sm decay. Neutron capture near the lunar surface also modified both the samarium and neodymium isotopic compositions of the basalt samples. The calculated neutron fluences range from ∼0 to ∼7.8 × 10<SUP>16</SUP> n/cm<SUP>2</SUP>. Both thermal and epithermal neutron fluences were calculated from the Sm isotopic compositions of the basalts and used to correct the ɛNd142 values for neutron capture by neodymium. Well-resolved radiogenic enrichments ɛNd142 and +0.17 ± 0.08 (2σ), respectively, were measured for lunar meteorite Asuka 881757 and Apollo 17 basalt 74255, respectively, for which the neutron fluences were nil. Basalts 70135 and 75075, which were exposed to small, measureable neutron fluences of ∼2.5 × 10<SUP>15</SUP> and ∼7.7 × 10<SUP>15</SUP> n/cm<SUP>2</SUP>, respectively, have neutron-corrected ɛNd142 values of +0.25± 0.15 and +0.29 ± 0.11, respectively. The average value of radiogenic ɛNd142 for the three high-Ti basalts from Apollo 17 is +0.22 ± 0.06. Neutron capture effects were greater for the other basalts, but can be corrected using the measured neutron fluences derived from the samarium isotopic data. The neutron-corrected ɛNd142 for Apollo 12 ilmenite basalt 12056, consistent with its derivation from a highly depleted mantle source also. Three low-Ti basalts from Apollo 12 and Apollo 15 (12038, 15076, 15555), have neutron corrected ɛNd142 which are not resolved from zero, and average +0.04 ± 0.06. A fourth low-Ti basalt, 12039, has neutron-corrected ɛNd142, but is subject to the largest neutron correction of ∼0.32 ɛ-units. KREEP basalt 14078 was exposed to only a small neutron fluence of ∼6.4 × 10<SUP>15</SUP> n/cm<SUP>2</SUP>, and has a small deficit of <SUP>142</SUP>Nd, corresponding to ɛNd142. The average neutron-corrected ɛNd142 of three KREEP basalts is -0.05 ± 0.04. The ɛNd142 values of the basalts correlate with <SUP>147</SUP>Sm/<SUP>144</SUP>Nd values for their source regions as calculated from their ages and initial ɛNd142 values. <SUP>147</SUP>Sm- <SUP>143</SUP>Nd and <SUP>146</SUP>Sm- <SUP>142</SUP>Nd systematics were combined in a three-stage model yielding an isochron equation for the lunar mantle formation interval, which was calculated to be 238<SUB>-40</SUB><SUP>+56</SUP> Ma (2σ). Sm/Nd ratios for the source regions also are derived from the model and compare favorably with values from conventional geochemical models of mare basalt petrogenesis. If the Moon were formed by impact of a large, Mars-sized planetesimal with the Earth, the impact was early enough that the lunar mantle cooled to neodymium isotopic closure by ∼4.32 Ga ago. The bulk lunar ɛmoon142 evaluated from the mantle isochron at (<SUP>147</SUP>Sm/<SUP>144</SUP>Nd)<SUB>CHUR</SUB> = 0.1967 is -0.01 ± 0.03 (2σ), consistent with derivation of lunar and terrestrial neodymium from a common reservoir.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(95)00175-Y
