J.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|63|13|2145|We have applied a stepwise pyrolytic extraction technique to eleven individual lunar regolith grains to investigate the compositions of light noble gases embedded in grain surfaces by solar wind irradiation, with emphasis on the rather poorly known isotopic composition of solar-wind argon. Results are intriguing: average <SUP>20</SUP>Ne/ <SUP>22</SUP>Ne ratios observed in early pyrolytic releases from ilmenite grains separated from lunar soils 71501, 79035 and 10084 agree very well with both direct measures of the solar wind neon composition in the Apollo foils and with values obtained in first releases from acid-etched ilmenites by the Zürich laboratory, whereas these same pyrolytic and acid-etch fractions carry argon isotopic signatures that significantly disagree - average <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>38</SUP>Ar ratios near 5.8 for thermal extraction compared to 5.4-5.5 for chemical etching at Zürich. Consideration of the isotopic and elemental data from these grains in the context of first-order diffusive modeling calculations points to gas release at low temperatures, without significant isotopic or elemental fractionation, from isolated grain-surface reservoirs of solar wind composition. The physical nature of these reservoirs is presently unknown. In this interpretation the preferred solar wind <SUP>20</SUP>Ne/ <SUP>22</SUP>Ne and <SUP>21</SUP>Ne/ <SUP>22</SUP>Ne ratios deduced from this study are respectively 13.81 ± 0.08 and 0.0333 ± 0.0003, both within error of the Zürich acid-etch values, and <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>38</SUP>Ar = 5.77 ± 0.08. It may be possible to reconcile the discrepancy between the acid-etch and pyrolytic estimates for the solar wind <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>38</SUP>Ar ratio in the context of arguments originally advanced by Benkert et al. (1993) to account for their He and Ne isotopic compositions. At the other, high-temperature end of the release profile from one of these grains there are clear isotopic indications of the presence of a Ne constituent with <SUP>20</SUP>Ne/ <SUP>22</SUP>Ne close to the 11.2 ratio found at Zürich and attributed by these workers to a deeply-sited component implanted by solar energetic particles.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00002-2
1993Metic..28Q.412N|1993|Extraction of He and NE from Individual Lunar Ilmenite Grains by Pulse Heating|Nier, A. O., Schlutter, D. J.|Meteoritics|28|3|412|The pulse-heating technique employed for extracting helium and neon from individual interplanetary dust particles [1] has been extended to a similar study of individual lunar grains. A succession of 5-s constant power pulses is applied to the oven holding the particle. The power is increased in 0.25-W increments until all the gas is removed. The peak temperature reached during a pulse lasts about 2 s and increases by roughly 75 degrees C for each 0.25-W increment in power. In the present investigation six individual ilmenite grains of lunar soil 71501 and of breccia 79035 were studied. It was felt that this method of extracting the gas might help in distinguishing between surface embedded solar wind (SW) particles and more deeply embedded constituents such as solar energetic particles (SEP) [2], or gas of trapped or primordial origin. Although only six particles of each type have been studied to date, interesting results are beginning to emerge. For example, for both types of particles, for the initial low power pulses where the maximum pulse temperature does not exceed 500 degrees C, the ^3He/^4He ratio falls near 4 x 10^-4, as expected, if the helium is primarily unfractionated solar wind implanted near the surface. As the pulse temperature is increased to around 1000 degrees C and the solar wind gas presumably has been removed, the ^3He/^4He ratio falls to around 2.5 x 10^-4, in rough agreement with the layer etching results [2]. Likewise, the ^20Ne/^22Ne ratio falls from around 14 to a value near 12, as in the etching experiments [2]. In the case of ^4He/^20Ne ratios there appears to be a real difference between the particles from the two ilmenites. For the 79035 grains, the ratio falls from around 600 for the surface gas to around 150 for the later high-temperature extractions. On the other hand, for the 71501 grains, the ratio starts somewhat lower, near 400, and drops below 100 as the pulse temperature is raised. A qualitatively similar difference was observed in the total gas released by laser beam extractions performed on single grains from the same lunar ilmenite samples [3]. While there is considerable scatter in the data, the overall results are gratifying, and should become more definitive as more particles are investigated. The initial releases, almost certainly from the surfaces of the particles, come closer to the solar wind values [4] than generally reported for lunar grains. It will be interesting to see whether or not the differences observed are real and have a bearing on the general problem of the variation of the solar wind with time [5].

1992Metic..27Q.206B|1992|An Interstellar Component in the Lunar Regolith|Brilliant, D. R., Franchi, I. A., Arden, J. W., Pillinger, C. T.|Meteoritics|27|3|206|On the basis of trace element studies the lunar regolith is known to contain on average about 1 to 2 wt% of carbonaceous chondrite debris (Ganapathy et al., 1970; Wasson and Baedecker, 1970). Such a component might be expected to be highly modified as a result of impacts at undiminished cosmic velocity. Nevertheless it could be supposed that resilient species such as diamond and silicon carbide, presolar grains recognised in all primitive meteorites, could survive to be distributed within the regolith. Interestingly both the presolar species mentioned are the carriers of characteristic isotopically light nitrogen. A well- known, but so far inadequately explained phenomenon concerning lunar ancient regolith materials is the high abundance of isotopically light nitrogen seen most prominently on soil breccias (Thiemens and Clayton, 1980). Since most of the nitrogen in the lunar soil is believed to have been derived from solar wind implantation, in the absence of any more plausible explanation, a secular change of 30-40% in ^14N/^15N of the sun's corona has been proposed (Kerridge, 1975; Becker and Clayton, 1975). It long ago occurred to us that we could investigate the occurrence of primitive meteorite debris at the lunar surface and possibly shed some light on the problem of light lunar nitrogen by stepped combusting the acid residue of an ancient lunar breccia. In order to avoid the use of excessive amounts of material, the experiment has been postponed until the advent of a new nitrogen isotope mass spectrometer and gas extraction system capable of measuring picomole quantities of the gas to a precision of +-0.1o/oo. Using such an instrument we have measured ca. 0.5-mg samples of 79035 and a residue after destruction of 99.9% of the parent in HF/HCl. Stepped combustion of whole rock 79035 liberated a total of 46 ng nitrogen (82 ppm, SIGMA delta^15N = -l60o/oo isotopic minimum -217o/oo at 850 degrees C) in the now well-known heavy-light-heavy pattern characteristic of ancient breccias. In contrast, the acid residue evolved 90% of its nitrogen 52 ng (103 ppm, SIGMA delta^15N -54o/oo isotopic minimum -74o/oo at 500 degrees C) as a single peak. Additionally delta^15N values of -72 and -45o/oo have been measured at temperatures above 800 degrees C corresponding with small peaks in the release profile, but the amounts of gas were within a factor of two of the blank. The nitrogen release and isotope profile of the major component correspond exactly to that encountered when interstellar diamonds from primitive meteorites are analysed before removal of contaminating organic material. Therefore, we tentatively interpret our data as the first recognition of interstellar grains in the lunar regolith. The appropriate investigation to confirm this conclusion is in progress. Using limiting values for the N abundance in presolar diamonds, we calculate that 79035 contains about 2 ppm diamond, about a factor of 5 less than the theoretical limit, assuming 2wt% CM2 equivalent carbonaceous chondrite material in the sample. The low delta^15N values measured at temperatures greater than 850 degrees would be consistent with about a factor of 50-100 less SiC carbide than diamond in 79035, a figure that corresponds well with the known relative abundance of diamond and SiC in CM2 meteorites. Clearly the abundances of diamond and SiC proposed here are totally incapable of accounting for any significant amount of the light lunar nitrogen. We cannot, however, discount that degassing of an abundant source of interstellar material early in the history of the lunar surface did not provide a source of the light lunar nitrogen by some indirect route.

1991E&PSL.103...55B|1991|Composition of solar wind noble gases released by surface oxidation of a metal separate from the Weston meteorite|Becker, R. H., Pepin, R. O.|Earth and Planetary Science Letters|103|1-4|55|Surface-sited noble gases were released from metal separates from the Weston meteorite by step-wise oxidation at temperatures below 400°C. Gas release from residual silicates in the separates was successfully suppressed by prior pyrolysis at somewhat higher temperatures than the combustions. Helium, neon and argon extracted from the metal show clear evidence of a solar wind signature. Xenon and nitrogen, on the other hand, were dominated by air, so that no solar component could be identified for these gases. Uncertainties on krypton isotopes were too large to yield useful conclusions. Helium, neon and argon elemental and isotopic ratios appear to depend on depth within the metal grains, in most cases becoming heavier with increasing oxidation of the metal. The cause of this dependence on amount of oxidation is not yet known. Ratios derived for the surface-sited component are therefore somewhat model dependent. Our best estimates are that, at the time of Weston's exposure, the solar wind <SUP>4</SUP>He <SUP>36</SUP>Ar ratio was around 3.6 × 10 <SUP>4</SUP>, <SUP>20</SUP>Ne <SUP>36</SUP>Ar was close to 45, <SUP>4</SUP>He <SUP>3</SUP>He was about 2500, <SUP>20</SUP>Ne <SUP>22</SUP>Ne about 13.3-13.4, <SUP>21</SUP>Ne <SUP>22</SUP>Ne about 0.033-0.035, and <SUP>36</SUP>Ar <SUP>38</SUP>Ar about 5.5-5.7. These ratios indicate that Weston did not acquire its solar wind gases from a recent exposure to solar wind, but more probably at a time in the past similar to or even earlier than the exposure time of Apollo 17 breccias such as 79035. The <SUP>36</SUP>Ar <SUP>38</SUP>Ar ratio, in conjunction with other recent determinations of this value, suggests that it is no longer appropriate to assume that the solar and terrestrial values are equivalent.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(91)90149-C
1989GeCoA..53.1135B|1989|Long-term changes in solar wind elemental and isotopic ratios: A comparison of two lunar ilmenites of different antiquities|Becker, R. H., Pepin, R. O.|Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|53|5|1135|An ilmenite separate from lunar regolith breccia 79035, a sample presumed to have been exposed to solar wind more than 2 Ga ago, was analyzed for noble gas and nitrogen elemental and isotopic abundances by stepwise oxidation and pyrolysis. The gases appear to be distributed between two distinct reservoirs in the ilmenite, defined by release patterns and isotopic considerations. One of the reservoirs, near grain surfaces, yields elemental ratios that for the most part are "solar" while the other, sited at greater depths within grains, has severely fractionated elemental abundances and generally heavier isotopic ratios as well. Xenon provides an exception to the solar abundance pattern in the near-surface reservoir, being enhanced by about a factor of 2 relative to the expected value. A comparison of the 79035 separate with a previously analyzed ilmenite from soil 71501, which received its solar wind exposure much more recently, indicates that the two-fold xenon enhancement occurs in the fractionated reservoir as well as the "solar" one, and that it may therefore be attributable to a change in the solar wind elemental abundances. Other differences between the two ilmenites occur in helium and neon isotopic ratios and in He/Ar elemental ratios. Since mineralogical influences on retentivities of the gases in the two samples should be the same, and possible contributions of non-solar wind components to one ilmenite in preference to the other can generally be eliminated or accounted for, all of these differences may reflect changes in the solar wind over time.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(89)90219-6
