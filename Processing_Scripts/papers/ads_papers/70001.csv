H.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2019||P33C-06|Apollo 11's Field Geology Experiment team included small core tubes for use on the first lunar landing 50 years ago. The rationale for coring on this and other missions rested primarily on the hypothesis that development of the regolith would have recorded the history of the solar wind and the flux and composition of meteors and comets impacting the Moon. The most complete core is the 298 cm Apollo 17 deep drill core 70001/9 and a synthesis of geologic, petrographic and geochemical data from numerous papers (published 1974-2017) produced the following conclusions: 70001/9 consists of nine major regolith units, based on differences in maturity indexes, agglutinate and pyroclastic ash content, and particle size- and type-frequency. The nine units probably span at least 1 billion years of solar system history. Primary indicators of maturity of each unit (Is/FeO, GCR tracks, decreased Zn content, and agglutinate percent) are highly correlated. After deposition, the surface of each unit was disturbed by small impacts, defined by reductions in Is/FeO. The second highest unit correlates petrographically and chemically with600-meter diameter Camelot Crater (rim 1 km away), estimated by topographic diffusion analysis to be 500 ± 200 Myr old. Several units in the core can be correlated with ejecta from impact craters within the valley of Taurus-Littrow morphologically older than Camelot. δ<SUP>15</SUP>Nat specific points in the lower 7 units of 70001/9 increases linearly with Is/FeOwith a slope of +1.22 δ<SUP>15</SUP>N‰ per Is/FeO point increase. Correcting δ<SUP>15</SUP>N‰ in the lower 7 units for their maturity gives a consistent solar wind δ<SUP>15</SUP>N value of -105 ± 5‰ at their times of deposition. The top two core units, including the Camelot-correlated unit (500 ± 200 Myr), require an increase in the rate of maturation to +2.07δ<SUP>15</SUP>N‰ per Is/FeO point to equal a solar wind δ<SUP>15</SUP>N value of -105 ± 5‰. <P />Assuming no change in solar wind δ<SUP>15</SUP>N‰, this synthesis of data on 70001/9 indicates that the Sun's luminosity would have increased by a factor of about 1.7 about 500 million years ago. Could this solar warming have triggered the Cambrian Explosion of life's quantity and diversity on Earth 540 million years ago? <P />Plans for future coring on the Moon should include deep cores that reach to the entire depth of regolith now present on dated mare and basin ejecta.|

J.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1395|It is shown that the Apollo 17 drill core 70009-70001 is heterogeneous with depth, containing five stratigraphic units, and has a bulk soil chemistry governed by the coarse fractions because of their greater weight proportions. The four components (1) KREEP, (2) anorthositic gabbro, (3) mare basalt, and (4) orange glass are used to model the compositions of the coarse and fine fractions of the entire drill core. It is found that the chemistry of the fused soil component in the five stratigraphic units is more similar to the chemistry of the fine, less than 20-micron fractions than the coarse fraction, suggesting that agglutinates may prefferentially meld and replicate the chemistry of the finer size fractions. The sources of Zn are the orange/black glasses, and the Zn profile is anticorrelated with the maturity index of Morris et al (1979), indicating the liberation of Zn during soil maturation.|

W.|Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|2||1497|Measurements of Al-26 and Mn-53 in the Apollo 17 drive tube 76001 show a clear integral excess of activity above expected production down to a depth of at least 9 gm/sq cm. This excess is interpreted as a continuous accretion of highly irradiated surface material slowly transported downslope by impact or other processes at a buildup rate of 1.5 cm/m.y. This drive tube, 76001, was collected near a change in slope on the North Massif. Integral excesses have also been observed in other Apollo 16 and 17 cores. Evidence in the Al-26 and Mn-53 record for continuous accretion is shown for Apollo 16 cores 60007 and 60010 and the Apollo 16 deep drill string 70009-70001. This evaluation shows that accretion at specific sites, either through continuous downslope movement or regolith material on the moon, or simply through small impact redistribution, is common on both small and large scales.|
