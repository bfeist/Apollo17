However, pre-impact tectonic pseudotachylites might also occur in the same rocks [1]. In the absence of convenient and robust distinguishing criteria, all pseudotachylites found within the Vredefort impact structure are commonly assumed to be impact-related [3]. A sample from metamorphosed granitic basement, collected in approx. 13 km NW from the Inlandsee - the geographical center of the crater, contains two pseudotachylitic veins. Vein 1 is parallel to the metamorphic foliation, has consistent thickness and locally is folded. It contains a moderate amount of relatively undeformed and rounded clasts, and reveals a high re-crystallization degree. In contrast, Vein 2 cuts the foliation at sharp angles, is undeformed and shows variable thickness and geometry at cm scale. Vein 2 contains multiple angular mosaic clasts, is cryptocrystalline and crosscuts Vein 1. Crosscutting relationships and the different degree of deformation and re-crystallization point to an earlier crystallization of Vein 1. Moreover, the irregular geometry and thickness of Vein 2, and a large amount of highly strained clasts, suggest a different mechanism of Vein 2 formation. Deformed zircon is present in both veins. Vein 1 hosts zircon with a lower degree of internal strain compared to either Vein 2 or host rock. However, zircon from Vein 1 reveals planar deformation bands (PDBs), which are evidence of seismicity, as they were found in zircon from co-seismic zones [4,5,6]. Zircon from Vein 2 is highly-strained and contains abundant shock microtwins, which represent a robust evidence of shock deformation [7,8]. This suggests that Vein 1 originated from pre-impact tectonics, whereas Vein 2 is unambiguously impact-related. The association of specific deformation microstructures in zircon with particular deformational settings provides hints on the hosting pseudotachylite origin. Moreover, internal microstructures in zircon could be the origin key for grains that have been removed from their geological context. A possible implication of our finding is that the deformation histories of some reported zircon grains might need revision. The deformation features associated with zircon from Apollo 17 breccia 72215, "The Oldest Zircon" [9,10], are PDBs rather than shock microtwins, and, therefore, are not directly linkable with impact processes. Even though this does not necessarily imply tectonic activity on the early Moon, as tectonic-like processes can also occur during the modification stage of impact cratering, our finding suggests that the interpretation of deformation features in zircon should be reconsidered and supported by experimental work.

P.|AGU Spring Meeting Abstracts|2013||GP24A-05|We have completed a reanalysis of the old Apollo paleomagnetic data using modern techniques of analysis and presentation. The principal result from the mare basalts is that several samples, such as 10020, 10017, 10049, and 70215 appear to be carrying primary natural remanent magnetization (NRM) acquired on the Moon as they cooled initially on the lunar surface, but in almost every case alternating field (AF) demagnetization was not carried out to strong enough fields to isolate this primary magnetization properly. When modern measurements are available, the agreement between old Apollo era data and new data is strikingly good. It also appears that the fields recorded by the basalts of Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 are stronger than those recorded by Apollo 12 and Apollo 15 basalts. Indeed it is not clear that any reliable records have come from these younger samples. The histories of breccias are more complicated than those of mare basalts and their NRM is harder to interpret. For regolith breccias, interpretations are complicated because of their strong superparamagnetic components and their complex, polymict lithologies. It would be unwise to use these samples for paleointensity estimates unless one can be sure that the NRM was entirely acquired as TRM during cooling after the shock event, as may be the case for 15498. In contrast, the melt rock and melt breccias, which include samples formed at high temperatures far above the Curie point of any magnetic carriers, have an excellent chance of recording lunar fields faithfully as they cool. This cooling may have taken place in a melt pool in a simple crater, or in a melt layer in a complex crater. Such samples would then have been excavated and deposited in the regolith and some appear to have recorded strong fields, but more work needs to be done to test this suggestion. Other melt rocks and melt breccias have had more complicated histories and appear to have been deposited in ejecta blankets, where final cooling took place. A useful, if imperfect, analogy may be pyroclastic volcanic deposits. The samples from the Apollo 17 layered boulder 1 at station 2 provide an example of this history. If a pTRM can be related to this secondary cooling, then we may recover a record of the field during this cooling. Samples such as 62235 and 72215 may provide just such a record, with Apollo-era and modern estimates of fields of the order of around 100 microT. Explaining such high paleointensities so late in lunar history is a major challenge to dynamo models based on cooling of the core, given its small size, and has led to alternative models.|

These zircon grains preserve deformation microstructures that show a wide range in style and complexity. Planar deformation features (PDFs) are documented in lunar zircon for the first time, and occur along {001}, {110}, and {112}, typically with 0.1-25 μm spacing. The widest PDFs associated with {112} contain microtwin lamellae with 65°/&lt;110&gt; misorientation relationships. Deformation bands parallel to {100} planes and irregular low-angle (&lt;10°) boundaries most commonly have &lt;001&gt; misorientation axes. This geometry is consistent with a dislocation glide system with &lt;100&gt;{010} during dislocation creep. Nonplanar fractures, recrystallized domains with sharp, irregular interfaces, and localized annealing textures along fractures are also observed. No occurrences of reidite were detected. Shock-deformation microstructures in zircon are explained in terms of elastic anisotropy of zircon. PDFs form along a limited number of specific {hkl} planes that are perpendicular to directions of high Young's modulus, suggesting that PDFs are likely to be planes of longitudinal lattice damage. Twinned {112} PDFs also contain directions of high shear modulus. A conceptual model is proposed for the development of different deformation microstructures during an impact event. This “shock-deformation mechanism map” is used to explain the relative timing, conditions, and complexity relationships between impact-related deformation microstructures in zircon.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1945-5100.2011.01316.x

P.|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|2011||P13D-1696|The Apollo era lunar paleomagnetism suffered from the lack of modern instrumentation and data analysis techniques. However, paleomagnetic data for nearly 100 samples were reported. We have completed a reanalysis of these old Apollo paleomagnetic data using modern techniques of analysis. The principal result from the mare basalts is that many samples such as 10020, 10017, 10049, 12022, and 70215 appear to be carrying primary natural remanent magnetization (NRM) acquired on the Moon as they initially cooled on the lunar surface, but in almost every case alternating field (AF) demagnetization was not carried out to strong enough fields to isolate this primary magnetization properly.

It also appears that the fields recorded by the basalts of Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 may be stronger than those recorded by Apollo 12 basalts, but the small number of high fidelity magnetic recorders among the latter group make this tentative at present. The histories of breccias are more complicated than those of mare basalts and their NRM is harder to interpret. The regolith and fragmental breccias have NRM, which is either a combination of shock remanent magnetization (SRM) acquired during shock lithification and partial to total thermal remanent magnetization (TRM) depending upon the residual temperature after the shock event. For regolith breccias, interpretations are complicated because of their strong superparamagnetic components and their complex, polymict lithologies. It would be unwise to use these samples for paleointensity estimates unless one can be sure that the NRM was entirely acquired as TRM during cooling after the shock event, such as may be the case for 15498.

Our new paleointensity experiments on four samples use modern absolute and relative measurement techniques, with ages ranging from 3.3 to 4.3 Ga, bracketing the putative period of an ancient lunar field. Samples 60015 (anorthosite) and 76535 (troctolite) failed during absolute paleointensity experiments. Samples 72215 and 62235 (impact breccias) recorded a complicated, multi-component magnetic history that includes a low-temperature (&lt;500 °C) component associated with a high intensity (∼90 μT) and a high temperature (&gt;500 °C) component associated with a low intensity (∼2 μT). Similar multi-component behavior has been observed in several published absolute intensity experiments on lunar samples. Additional material from 72215 and 62235 was subjected to a relative paleointensity experiment (a saturation isothermal remanent magnetization, or sIRM, experiment); neither sample provided unambiguous evidence for a thermal origin of the recorded remanent magnetization. We test several magnetization scenarios in an attempt to explain the complex magnetization recorded in lunar samples. Specifically, an overprint from exposure to a small magnetic field (an isothermal remanent magnetization) results in multi-component behavior (similar to absolute paleointensity results) from which we could not recover the correct magnitude of the original thermal remanent magnetization. In light of these new experiments and a thorough re-evaluation of existing paleointensity measurements, we conclude that although some samples with ages of 3.6 to 3.9 Ga are strongly magnetized, and sometimes exhibit stable directional behavior, it has not been demonstrated that these observations indicate a primary thermal remanence. Particularly problematic in the interpretation of lunar sample magnetizations are the effects of shock. As relative paleointensity measurements for lunar samples are calibrated using absolute paleointensities, the lack of acceptable absolute paleointensity measurements renders the interpretation of relative paleointensity measurements unreliable. Consequently, current paleointensity measurements do not support the existence of a 3.9-3.6 Ga lunar dynamo with 100 μT surface fields, a result that is in better agreement with satellite measurements of crustal magnetism and that presents fewer challenges for thermal evolution and dynamo models.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pepi.2008.05.007

Our new paleointensity experiments on four Apollo samples use modern absolute and relative measurement techniques. Our samples (60015, 76535, 72215, 62235) have ages ranging from 3.3 to 4.2 Ga, bracketing the putative period of a lunar dynamo. Samples 60015 (anorthosite) and 76535 (troctolite) failed during absolute paleointensity experiments, using the IZZI-modified Thellier-Thellier method. Samples 72215 and 62235 recorded a complicated, multi-component magnetic history that includes a low temperature (&lt; 500°C) component with a high intensity (~90 μT), and a high temperature (&gt; 500°C) component with a low intensity (~2 μT). These two samples were also subjected to a relative paleointensity experiment (sIRM), from which neither provided unambiguous evidence for a thermal origin of the recorded remanent magnetization. We found similar multi-component behavior in several published experiments on lunar samples. We test and present several magnetization scenarios in an attempt to explain the complex magnetization recorded in lunar samples. Specifically, an overprint from exposure to a small magnetic field (i.e. IRM) results in multi-component behavior (similar to lunar sample results), from which we could not recover the correct magnitude of the original TRM. The non-unique interpretation of these multi-component results combined with IRM (isothermal remanent magnetization) contamination during Apollo sample return ( Strangway et al., 1973), indicates that techniques incapable of distinguishing between single- and multi-component records (e.g., sIRM), cannot be reliably used to infer magnetic conditions of the early Moon. In light of these new experiments and a thorough reevaluation of existing paleointensity measurements, we conclude that there is a paucity of lunar samples that demonstrate a primary thermal remanent magnetization. As relative paleointensity measurements for lunar samples are calibrated using absolute paleointensities, the lack of acceptable absolute paleointensity measurements renders the interpretation of relative paleointensity measurements unreliable. Consequently, current lunar paleointensity measurements are inadequate to determine the existence and strength of an early lunar magnetic field. Surface magnetometry measurements and the return of magnetically uncontaminated samples from future missions are much needed for further progress in understanding the characteristics and origin of lunar crustal remanent magnetization.|

K., Swits, G.|Moon|14|3-4|473|The average directions of natural remanent magnetization (NRM) of three texturally distinct layers (72215, 72255, and 72275) of a 2 m-sized breccia boulder were found to be the same, while the directions of their stable components of NRM were found to be widely divergent. One clast from 72275 yielded a stable NRM direction which was different from that of the matrix. Approximate paleointensity measurements showed that 72255 and 72275 could have obtained their stable remanence from an ancient magnetic field of the same magnitude. However, 72215 probably was magnetized by a magnetic field of a different intensity. We concluded that the coincident NRM directions owe their origin to a secondary imprint of less stable magnetization imparted during the assembly of the boulder at moderate temperatures (∼ 450°C) on the South Massif. The stable directions, on the other hand, date from the last, higher-temperature (∼ 770°C) magnetizing event experienced by the mineral and lithic components while they were part of the immature pre-Serenitatis regolith.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00569677

Fractions of the Cl, Br, and Hg that are mobilized by water leaching and/or volatilization at moderate temperatures (⩽450°C) place constraints on the thermal history of Boulder 1 and its component breccias. Since, and possibly during, consolidation, the boulder has probably not been subjected to temperatures of ⩾450°C. The parent rocks of the Apollo 17 boulder and breccia samples studied could have been derived from two initial magmas. Boulder 1, Station 2 gray competent breccias 72255 and 72275 Clast #2 appear to be genetically unrelated to gray competent breccia and anorthositic material 72215, or to light friable breccia 72275; they do appear to be related to samples 72395 (Boulder 2) and 76315 (Station 6 boulder).

R., Niemeyer, S., Phinney, D.|Moon|14|3-4|407|Rare gas isotopic analyses have been performed on both pile-irradiated and unirradiated samples from Boulder 1, Station 2. Two samples from rock 72255, the Civet Cat clast and a sample of adjacent breccia, have concordant<SUP>40</SUP>Ar-<SUP>39</SUP> Ar ages of 3.99±0.03 b.y. and 4.01±0.03 b.y., respectively. Several samples from rock 72275 have complex thermal release patterns with no datable features, but an intermediate-temperature plateau from the dark rim material of the Marble Cake clast yields an age of 3.99±0.03 b.y. - indistinguishable from the age of rock 72255. We regard these ages as upper limits on the time of the Serenitatis basin-forming event. The absence of fossil solar-wind trapped gases in the breccia samples implies that a prior existence for the boulder as near-surface regolith material can be regarded as extremely unlikely. Instead, the small trapped rare-gas components have isotopic and elemental compositions diagnostic of the terrestrial-type trapped component which has previously been identified in several Apollo 16 breccias and in rock 14321. Excess fission Xe is found in all Boulder 1 samples in approximately 1:1 proportions with Xe from spontaneous fission of<SUP>238</SUP>U. This excess fission Xe is attributed to spontaneous fission of<SUP>244</SUP>Puin situ. Cosmic-ray exposure ages for samples from rocks 72215 and 72255 are concordant, with mean<SUP>81</SUP>Kr-Kr exposure ages of 41.4±1.4 m.y. and 44.1±3.3 m.y., respectively. However a distinctly different<SUP>81</SUP>Kr-Kr exposure age of 52.5±1.4 m.y. is obtained for samples from rock 72275. A two-stage exposure model is developed to account for this discordance and for the remaining cosmogenic rare-gas data. The first stage was initiated at least 55 m.y. ago, probably as a result of the excavation of the boulder source-crop. A discrete change in shielding depths ∼ 35 m.y. ago probably corresponds to the dislodgement of Boulder 1 from the South Massif and emplacement in its present position.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00569674

D., Tatsumoto, M.|Moon|14|3-4|463|Nine U-Th-Pb whole-rock analyses of selected brecciated materials from sample 72215 and one analysis of a pigeonite basalt clast from 72275 are presented. Both samples are from Boulder 1, Apollo 17. These data supplement previous Boulder 1 U-Th-Pb analyses of samples 72275 and 72255. U and Th concentrations indicate that most of the samples contain a moderate to large KREEP component. Samples containing the least KREEP are a noritic clast (72255,49; Civet Cat clast) and an anorthositic clast (72275,117). Evidence for the migration of Pb from Pb-rich matrix material into relatively Pb-poor clasts is presented for two clasts. Most of the Boulder 1 data define a linear trend that intersects concordia at ∼ 3.9 and 4.4 b.y. when plotted on a U-Pb concordia diagram. The presence of one anorthositic clast distinctly off this trend indicates that a simple two-stage U-Pb evolution history is inadequate to explain all the data. Accordingly physical significance is only attached to the lower concordia intercept age of 3.9 4.0 b.y. The older concordia intercept age of ∼ 4.4 b.y. is interpreted to reflect an averaging of events both older and younger than 4.4 b.y. The data suggest that significant differentiation and/or metamorphism occurred ∼ 4.2 b.y. ago. The age of this event, however, is not accurately defined by these data.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00569676
