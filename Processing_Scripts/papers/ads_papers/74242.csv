Systematic trace element analysis among coexisting mineral phases requires the measurement of the elemental concentrations in a small volume, which can be obtained by applying a proton microprobe. <P />Different opaque minerals, like armalcolite (Fe, Mg) Ti<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB>, ilmenite FeTiO<SUB>3</SUB>, ulvöspinel Fe<SUB>2</SUB>TiO<SUB>4</SUB> and chromite FeCr<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>4</SUB> (of the spinel solid solution series Fe<SUB>2</SUB>TiO<SUB>4</SUB>-FeCr<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>4</SUB>) in samples of three Apollo missions were investigated. <P />Comparative analyses of the mineral pair armalcolite/ilmenite in two Apollo 17 basalts (sample 74242,19), which differ in their crystallization sequences, show that the partitioning of Zr among the two mineral phases is different in the two basalt types. <P />Coexisting ilmenite/ulvöspinel were studied in the Apollo 15 basalts (samples 15065,93; 15555,42). The trace elements Zr and Nb were found to partition in favour of ilmenite. <P />The investigated mineral pairs of chromite/ulvöspinel in Apollo 12 (samples 12051,60; 12051,62) and Apollo 15 basalts are zoned in their major element contents. The trace element Zr detected by proton microprobe analyses also shows zoning behaviour. Primarily, crystallized chromite does not incorporate Zr, whereas the Zr content in the coexisting ulvöspinel rises with increasing Ti content.|http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0168-583X(84)90463-4
