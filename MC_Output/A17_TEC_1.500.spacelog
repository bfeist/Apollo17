LMP: I've been carrying very low amps on the BAT BUS, and I did not see a drop. I'm carrying about 2 amps now. Volts are 3 - 30.5.
     CC Jack, go ahead and take the B/C motor switch OFF.

[00:00:14:48]
LMP: Okay. It's OFF. And I confirm that one.
     CC And we think it's the EDS POWER switch and the fuel cell ... switch that are drawing the current that you're seeing there.
     LMP Okay. That could well be.
     CC Okay, Jack, we're going to lose you in about 1 minute off of Vanguard here and see you at 52:20.
     LMP Roger; we're pressing and thanks, Bob.

[00:00:15:11]
CDR: Okay, Bob. Everything is looking GO on board. Everything's stable. We can see the APS firing, and our altitudes look good.
     CC Geno, everything is in good shape down here. The booster's in good shape; you're looking good; and their AOS time is 52:20 as I'gave you.
     CDR We got that, babe. We'll see you coming around.
     CC Good show, babe. A little late but a good show.
     CDR Outstanding ride.

LMP: Hello, Houston; how do you read 17?
     CC 17, read you loud and clear.
     LMP Hey, we're going real well up here, Bob. Have no significant anomalies as yet; and we've just about completed our part of the insertion checklist. Gene has his SCS check yet, and Ron's got some P52 numbers for you. And the only thing I've seen so far is a - some spurious MASTER ALARM without caution and warning that seem to be associated with moving switches on panel 2.
     CC Okay. Can you get a sudden - what switches anywhere - any ... any switches on?
     LMP So far, it's been fairly random. Some that I remember is the SECONDARY COOLANT LOOP EVAP switch, the LAMP TEST switch, - see - I think I got one with the TEMP IN AUTO switch. Gene got one doing something. I can't remember exactly what it was.
     CC Okay - -
     LMP Probably random.
     CC - - we copy. Jack, we're standing by for that P52 data. We've only got about a 4-minute - a 5-minute pass here. We'll take the 52 data, and I got a few updates for you.
     LMP Okay.
     CMP Okay; 52 data is coming. NOUN 71 is 24 and 30; NOUN 05 is .01; NOUN 93s are plus .080, plus .029, plus .018; and we torqued at 35:25.
     CC Okay. We copy that. Okay, while we're filling in some here, you might want to know this, Jack. Your sunset and sunrise times in the Launch Checklist
     LMP Okay, we got you.
     CC Okay. And on page 2-17 of the Launch Checklist, you're going to want to delete all reference to Honeysuckle AOS and LOS and delete all reference to Canaries AOS and LOS.
     LMP Wilco.
     CC And we want to add an Ascension pass; AOS at Ascension, 01 plus 54 plus 00, and Ascension LOS will be 02:00:16.

[00:00:55:13]
_page : 18
_tape : Tape 3/2
LMP: Okay, Bob; you're going to have to repeat that.
     CC Okay, stand by. Let me give you a page. On 2-17 - let's go Hawaii AOS first of all. On Hawaii AOS, on page 2-17. AOS - -
     LMP Go.
     CC - - is 01 plus 17 plus 24. Hawaii LOS, 01 plus 22 plus 49.
     LMP Roger. Now what about the Ascension?
     CC Okay, here - give you the Ascension again now. AOS, 01 plus 54 plus 00. Ascension LOS will be 02:00:16. Over.
     LMP Okay, I got those. Hawaii is 01 plus 17 plus 24, and LOS is 01 plus 22 plus 49. And Ascension is AOS, 01 plus 54:00; and LOS, 02 plus 00:16.
     CC Roger, Jack. Good copy. And booster's looking good down here and you're looking good.
     LMP Okay, and I'll do a better job of itemizing those switches. We were pressing pretty hard, and I'll -IԬl be able to go back and get most of them, I think. And we'11 keep an eye on it - on the MASTER ALARMS.
     CC Roger, Jack. We understand. And I think we copied most of what you said there, and we're working on it.
     CDR Okay, Bob; other than that MASTER ALARM, all is well on America, and I understand the booster is looking good to you.
     CC That's affirmative.
     LMP And, Bob, let me add that not - we did get spurious MASTER ALARMs without switch movement, but many came with switch movements. WeԶe had about seven.
     CC Okay; understand.
     LMP That was only after insertion.
     CC Seven times that your heart doesn't need, huh?
     LMP Oh, we were paying attention to a sunset that was the biggest - -
     CDR Sunrise.
     LMP - - or sunrise or something that we saw. It was the biggest rainbow I'd ever seen.
     CC Beautiful. We can't wait to hear what you had to say about that - the ignition on the S-II. It sounded pretty spectacular.
     LMP Bob, just let it be said that that was quite a booster ride. When we get a chance a little later - -
     CC Roger.
     LMP - - maybe we'll be able to tell you something.
     CC WeԲe about ready to lose comm here. You're looking great, guys, and weԬl pick you up in Hawaii here shortly.
     CDR Okay, we're looking at the deserts of Australia right now and, again, everything's good on board.

IMP: Hello, earthlings. We're back with you.
     CC Roger, Jack. Read you loud and clear; how us?
     LMP You're loud and clear. And no change systems-wise that I've seen.
     CC Roger, Jack. Any more MASTER ALARMs?
     LMP We had one when Ron's - looked like his neck ring hit panel 2. ...
     CC Okay. Sounds like we had something loose in panel 2, huh?
     LMP Yes. 1 don't know - It may be annoying, but so far it doesn't seem to be a problem.
     CC Roger. Just for your information, everything is looking outstanding and no problems. We're taking a good look at the data here at Hawaii, and we'll make a GO/NO GO decision about 60 seconds after acquisition at Goldstone. But there's nothing right now to lead us to believe that zero opportunity will be required.
     LMP Okay, Bob, understand that. We are prepared, however . Spacecraft, other than those MASTER ALARMs, is looking very good. We got the docking probe extended. The SCS reference attitude check is complete.
     CC Roger.
     LMP Hey, Bob, 1 just remembered another switch that 1 think gave us a MASTER ALARM was HO QUANTITY INDICATOR.
     CC Roger. Copy that, Jack. HgO QUANTITY INDICATOR.
     CC Roger - 17, we're going to lose you in about 30 seconds. But when you get over the stateside here, we're going to take - take the dump on the data, and we'll read it out real carefully so when you get in TLC we ought to be able to see where that MASTER ALARM glitch is coming in to.
     LMP Okay, Bob. And - yell at me if you want anything done on the coram with this change in AOS LOS stuff.
     CC Negative on that right now. WeԬl see you at 01:28:59 through Goldstone.

     LMP We're going to be going a little bit south of that area.
     CC Right. Your ground track looks like it's taking you right up over the mid part of Baja California.
     LMP Yes, sir; I'll believe that. I'll bet you I can see Ensenada right now.
     CC Roger.
     CMP Bob, I expect he'll probably be able to see the lights of Silver City, too.

CC: Jack, just for your information, youԬl probably -when you come up a little farther in this orbit here and get over Mexico, you should be able to see all that bad weather that was giving us so much worry and had Tindall and New Orleans and everything all messed up this morning when I went through there. They had a pretty bad line of weather along there.
     LMP I assume it wasn't too bad. I think you made it, didn't you?
     CC Oh, yeah, I made it, but I had to - you know, I had to work at it. But it's a - we were - I was worried about it getting down as towards MILA there after - you know if we had to scrub and go tomorrow night. Boy, I'm sure glad we got you off tonight.
     LMP Guess who else is.
     CC No, I can't - I wouldn't believe that.
     CC Parker can't make it back. HeԳ got to come back on the ... So you might have to have Young on for a while after we do a TLI.
     LMP Hey, you just wouldn't believe, Bob, the light you can see in the west right now. It must be absolutely clear.
     CC Roger, Jack. Sounds spectacular. Jack, people in the room here want to know if you've been down your checklist yet?

[00:01:31:24]
LMP: Oh, we got that out of the way in about 5 minutes. Have we missed something?
     CC There's a different checklist here we're talking about.
     LMP (Laughter) If you're talking about the Flight Plan, yes.
     CC Roger.
     CMP What a waste.
     LMP If I'm not mistaken, we must be just south of Arizona now. Is that right, Bob?
     CC That looks real good. Yes, youԲe over Mexico there, and looks like you're - oh - maybe a hundred miles south of the border there.
     LMP Okay. I was pretty sure I was looking up in the Phoenix-Tucson complex there.
     CC Roger. Understand.
     LMP Clear night.
     CC Little better than ... Florida.
     LMP The west is always that way. I wish it was daylight so we could see Sonora and that country. That's spectacular, I'll bet you.
     CC Roger.
     LMP Man's field of stars on the Earth is competing with the heavens, Bob.
     CDR Bob, you're coming through with a large squeal right now in the background.
     CC Understand ...
     LMP Okay, I think we got the Gulf Coast showing up now by the band of lights, Bob.
     CC Roger.
     CDR Okay, Bob. Assume the booster is still looking good, and we'll be GO for a nominal TLI.
     CC That1s affirmative.
     LMP Okay.
     CDR And you're still coming up with a loud squeal.
     CC Roger. ...
     CC 17, how do you read?

     CC Am I still squealing? This is Houston.
     CDR That's affirm. You're very loud, almost unreadable with the squeal. Bob, why don't you give us the short count?
     CC Geno, don't change anything. We think it's a ground site situation here, and just stand by.
     CDR I believe it's in the VHP, Bob.
     LMP Okay, Bob. I'm not sure exactly where we are, but Iԭ looking out - to an awful lot of horiz - lights on the horizon out there at 12 o'clock, and an awful lot of lightning in the clouds out there.
     CC Roger. I - we show you just about over the middle of the Gulf. Looking ahead, you're probably seeing the very southern tip of Florida there.
     CDR It looks like almost the entire Florida peninsula has got lights - got lightning on it somewhere.
     CC Roger. How does my comm sound to you now, Gene?
     CDR Okay, give us a quick short count.
     CC Roger. Short count follows: 5 > 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; short count out.
     CDR Bob, you're all right now.
     CC Okay.
     CDR And can you give us a feel for what the final weather was at the Cape - at launch?
     CC Yes. Let me get that for you. The reason why we had that problem on the comm is we just handed over from Texas to MILA, and we're - and you're going through MILA now. And it's great. So we have a little problem with our Texas site.
     CDR Okay.
     CC The television coverage had you all the way through staging very well on - and the S-II ignition. Then, you went right behind a cloud for a while, but they were tracking you pretty well.
     CDR Okay.
     CC They also - cut in for about a half minute or so and showed a view of the crowd in just the available light from the booster, and it stood out pretty well.
     LMP Okay, Bob. We're going right over Florida now, looking down at Miami. A beautiful view of the Keys all lit up, and I just saw a shooting star right over Miami.
     CC Roger.
     LMP That's a very, very fine view of Miami. Hard to believe.

     CMP He's crawling around looking for things down in the LEB.
     CC (Laughter) Okay. They won't let you have a window tonight, huh, Ron?
     CMP No, I'll catch one here pretty quick.
     CC Just a reminder, if you haven't already done it. There is no need to unstow the TV, because due to this late launch, there's just no site available.
     CDR Okay, Bob. We're not going to unstow it.
     LMP Bob, I don't - I guess there's no site available for some time, is that correct?
     CC That's affirmative. And if I can pull one of you guys away from a window, I've got a TLI plus 90 pad.

     CC That's affirmative. Stand by. We've got Vanguard, I can continue on with - after trunnion, the bore-sight Star is not applicable, Jack. NOUN 6l, plus 13.29, minus 032.00; 1099-2, 34904; GET of .05G, 024:38:09. Want to read back that much of the pad, Jack?
     LMP Okay, Bob. It's TLI plus 90 pad, SPS/G&N; 66953; minus 0.59, plus 1.88; 004:40:01.48; minus 0351.8, minus four zeros 1, plus 3378.2; 180, 073, 003; Ha is NA; plus 0020.1; 3396.4, 4:54, 3380.8; 11, 342.4 32.3. Boresight is NA; plus 13.29, minus 032.00; 1099-2, 34904; 024:38:09. Over.
     CC Roger, Jack. Good readback except burn time is 4:50 and not 4:54. And we'll be losing you here in about a minute, so wait on the rest of that pad. Just a reminder for Ron, we'll be standing by at Ascension for the next gyro torquing and -we, might have a drift update on the - IMU there,
     LMP Okay, he copied that. And we'll wait for the rest of the pad.
     CC Okay.
     LMP Burn time was 4:50 - I think that was when you started to cut out.
     CC Roger.

[00:01:48:11]
CC: 17, this is Houston through ARIA. How do you read? Over.

CC: 17 Houston through ARIA. How do you read?
     CC 17, Houston. How do you read through ARIA?
     00 01 5U 07 CC 17, Houston.
     LMP Go ahead.
     CC Roger. You're back with us. I'll finish up that TLI plus 90 pad so we can talk a little here if you want.
     LMP Go ahead.

[00:01:54:19]
CC: Okay. Set stars are Sirius and Rigel; R^IGN is 318; 148; 358. There'll be no ullage. Okay. Down at the bottom of the pad we've got the P37 for lift-off plus 9. GET is 009 00; DELTA-V^, 4897; longitude, minus 175; GET of 400K, 033 49. Over.

[00:01:55:09]
LMP: Okay, Bob. Zero - Sirius and Rigel; 318; 148; 358; no ullage; 009 00; 4897; minus 175; 033 4-9. Over.
     CC Okay, Jack. Good readback.
     LMP Okay, Bob. We had - as usual - up here (laughter) a spectacular sunrise, and Gene wants to talk to you.
     CDR I got some numbers on Ron's P52 for you, Bob.
     CC Okay; standing by to copy. Go ahead.
     CDR Okay. NOUN 71 were stars 22 and 24; NOUN 05 are all balls; NOUN 93s are all minus. They're 00.037, 00.007, and 00.021. That's minus 37> minus 07, and minus 21; and they were torqued at 01:51:40.
     CC Okay. We copy.
     LMP Bob, we're over - what might be - intermediate to low strata that have a very strong crenulation pattern - pulling out some geological terms here. I don't think I've ever seen anything like it -flying.
     CC Roger.
     LMP Looks like about a north-south lineation with a very strong crinkling, roughly east-west.
     CC Roger. Copy that; that's interesting. You know, you're just directly over that South Atlantic area. Your - you - your path just kind of kept you going right between the - Africa and South America, right dead center all the way.

[00:01:57:44]
_page : 29
_tape : Tape 4/2
CC: And, 17, just for your information, we've searched all the data we can, and we cannot find anything wrong with the spacecraft or the booster at all. Everything is looking real fine, and the only problem in the air is that - those master alarms that you have reported - we're not able to tie in anything common yet to any of those things either.
     CDR Okay, Bob. We have not had any for - quite some time, I think, since the last time we talked to you about them.
     CC Roger. Understand. We'll probably get a good workout on that after TLI and try and track it down one more.
     CDR Okay. But, also, we have not really been doing much switching since the insertion checklist was complete, either.
     CC Roger. Understand. It's got you glued to the windows, I guess, huh?
     CDR They are interesting; I'll say that.
     IMP Well, I certainly am, Bob, and - again there's a big - a fairly continuous intermediate cloud deck, I think. And it has patterns comparable to what I've seen on pictures of ice floes.
     CC Roger. Understand.
     LMP And - of pack ice; I should say pictures of pack ice in the Antarctic.

_tape : Tape 4/3
CC: 17, Houston. We've got two questions concerning the MASTER ALARMs. One, do you get the MASTER ALARM on the LEB also; and, two, do you get the tone with the MASTER ALARM?
     LMP We did get the tones. The MASTER ALARMs were on both - panel 1 and panel 3. I can't tell you about the LEB right now. Maybe Ron can.
     CMP No, I didn't pay that ranch attention.
     CC Okay.
     CDR And, Bob, there was something interesting I wanted to get around to tell you. The - MISSION TIMER down in the LEB, when Ron went down there to get things squared away, was about 15 seconds or so behind all the other clocks.
     CC Roger. We copy that.
     CDR Okay; and we reset it - re synced it - and it's been running okay. I don't know whether that's a clue to anything or not, but apparently it happened either during launch - or somewhere before we got down there right after insertion.
     CC Okay. We're going to lose you here in about 9 seconds. You are GO and looking great, and we'll work on it. And if you get another MEV [?], will you check the T/FIR for us?
     CDR Yes, sir; sure will do, Bob. We'll see you. What's our next AOS?
     CC Stand by. It's Carnarvon at 02:25-
     CDR Thank you.

[00:02:25:18]
CDR: I see you're trying.
     CC 17, Houston. How are you doing?
     LMP Well, we're pretty good. You're wavery here a little bit on signal strength.
     CC Okay. We've got a TLI pad any time you're ready to copy it, Jack.
     LMP Goodness; okay, let me get rid of something here. Ron, I'm putting that right underneath you.
     CC And, guys, we'd like POO and ACCEPT, please.
     LMP Okay.
     CC You'll get a CSM state vector if you'll give us POO and ACCEPT.

     LMP Okay. Let me have my favorite pad.

[00:02:25:54]
CC: Okay. Here's the TLI pad. Time base 6 at 3 02 57; 180, 312, 000; 5 51; DELTA-Vc is 10359.6, 35582; 000, 345, 040; extraction will be at 300, 165, 320; 312.0, 306.0, 57 10, yaw is 0; ejection time, 4 plus 39 plus 00. Over.
     LMP Okay, Houston. Here1s your TLI pad. 3:02:57; 180, 312, 000; 5:51; 10359.6, 35582; 000, 345, 040; 300, 165, 320; 312.0, 306.0 57:10, 000; ejection time, 4 plus 39 plus 00.
     CC Good readback, Jack; and we'd like OMNI Charlie, and it's your computer, and you've got your state vector.

[00:02:28:04]
_extra : HAWAII (REV 2)
IMP: Okay. You've got OMNI Charlie. And, Bob, we had almost a completely weather-free pass over Africa and Madagascar. And the scenery - both aesthetically and geologically - was something like I've never seen before, for sure.
     CC Roger.
     LMP We got odds and ends on the tape and quite a bit on the film.
     CC Roger; good show. Are you saying that you didn't have any weather over that southern Africa there?
     LMP Not very much. Barely broken clouds in some places. Most of the countryside was clear.
     CC Roger.
     LMP There were - patterns - like I havenԴ even seen in textbooks. Maybe I haven't been looking enough, but some of the desert and grassland patterns were - had the appearance of ice crystals almost, except on a megascale, if you - have ever looked at ice crystals in sand.
     CC Roger.
     LMP Or, better yet, ice crystals on your car window when you - get out early in the morning up in -northern areas.
     CC Roger. And just be advised, we'll be standing by for the GO/NO GO for PYRO ARM when we get to Hawaii, and we'll be giving you a GO for TLI about that time.
     LMP Okay; and we'll be ready.
     CC And, Ron, in - on the Launch Checklist, on 2-25, on the manual and nominal S-IVB TLI-1, add 34 degrees on the nominal pad for all the pitch angles; and on the manual pad, add 34.5 degrees to all the pitch angles, and you'll have it right.
     CMP Okay, Bob. You ... - -
     CC And - -
     CM? - - let me get set. That's - okay, we'll just add 34 to the nominal and 34.5 to all the manual ones ... - -
     CC And you'll want to do that on your cue card also, Ron.
     CMP Yes, that's affirm.
     CC And we're about ready to LOS; we'll see you at Hawaii.
     CDR Okay, Bob, we'll see you - -
     CC 02 plus 50 at Hawaii.

     LMP And, Bob, in case you're interested, there - all through the nightside pass here - there's a -quite a strong - well - stronger than I would have ever expected - horizon glow off to the north. I suspect that, I think Gene said a while ago that it's around on his side also.

     CDR Okay, Robert. I understand. America and Challenger with their S-IVB are GO for TLI.
     CC That's affirmative.
     CDR You're a sweet talker.
     CC We try to please here, Gene.
     CDR You know, somehow, Bob, I knew you were going to say that - we were GO - and that you try to please.

     CDR Not long enough, yet.
     CC And, 17; Houston. You're about 1 minute from LOS, and we'll pick you up at Goldstone at about 3 hours and 00 minutes; and that's only a couple of minutes prior to time base 6 start.
     CDR Okay, Bob. We'll be with you.
     CC Roger.

     CC Roger. Understand.
     LMP There's a whole bunce of big ones on my window down there - just bright. It looks like the Fourth of July out of Ron's window.
     CMP Yes. Now you can see some of them in shape. They're very Jagged, angular fragments that arc-tumbling.
     CC Roger. They look like fluid of some sort?
     CMP Not to me. They look like pieces of something.
     CC Roger.
     CMP They're very bright.
     CC Jack, we'd like OMNI Charlie.
     CMP Bob, for the most part, these fragments are not -or are tumbling at a very slow rate. I tried a couple of pictures of them - different settings. You may get an idea of what, at least, the patterns look like.
     CC Roger. I've got you. We're all ears on these fragments. Do you think you can figure out what t?iey might be?
     CMP Well, you know I - I don't know. There are a number of possibilities. If you had some kind of a -I got the impression maybe they were curved a little bit, as if they might be - off the side of the S-IVB. And that's a wild guess - -
     CDR Okay. RCS LOGIC is ... --

     LMP Yes.

     CC Okay. Frame 70.
     CDR And, Bob. This is Geno. My impression is that they are - flat, flakelike particles. Some may be 6 inches across. And, although there's no relative motion between the two, most of them seem to be twinkling. And I think, for the most part, they're all moving away from us.

     CMP We're not there yet. Long ways to go yet. It's on the other side of the Earth, if the simulator's any good.
     CMP Oh, man!

[00:03:43:58]
CDR: There goes another SLA panel, Houston, going the other way.
     CMP Yes.
     CDR I've - -

[00:03:44:03]
LMP: Hey, there's the booster!
     CC Roger. Bet you never saw the SLA panels on the simulator.
     CDR No, but we've got the booster and is she pretty. Challenger's just sitting in her nest.
     CC Roger. We'd like OMNI Bravo, now, Jack.
     LMP Okay, we'll plus-X it. We'll see the - oh, you can't see ... Okay. Oh, I can't see my C0AS.
     CDR And, Houston, some of the particles going by the window - -
     LMP Okay, did you change the DAC?
     CDR - - were obvious enough - fairly obvious to me -paint.
     CC Okay. We'11 buy that.
     LMP Okay. There it is. Okay, did you change the PAC? Got ATT l/rate 2?
     CDR Okay, Houston, you want the high gain?
     CC Roger. We're standing by for it, and the angles as published on L/3-3 should be good.
     CDR Okay.

LMP: Okay, it's flying pretty good.
     LMP Okay, we're in REACQ here.
     LMP Houston, how do you read? We donԴ have a very good knock - lockon here in REACQ.
     CC Roger, Jack. We're reading you pretty good -voice.
     LMP Okay. It looks like it's improving. It dropped off - signal strength dropped off, and now it's picking up again.
     CC Roger.
     CC We're getting good signal now, Jack.
     CC Jack, the high gain is looking good.
     LMP Oh, okay.
     CMP I'm guessing. I don't know - about a hundred ... - -
     LMP That's good news. It seemed to smoo - slew very smoothly, so it looks all right.
     CC Roger, Jack.
     LMP ATT l/RATE 2?
     CDR I can't tell you too much, Bob, from the center seat other than Captain America is very intent on getting Challenger at the moment.

CMP: Yes, I'm coming in a little slow, but we've got plenty of time.

[00:03:48:59]
CDR: Okay, Houston. While we're moving in here, I can see a few chunks of that platy material, possibly paint, down in the SLA sort of bouncing around between the S-IVB and the LM.
     CC Roger.
     CDR But, so far, LM looks very clean. Can't see anything abnormal from this view yet.
     CC Okay.
     LMP Isn't it, though? That thing is really stable out there.

[00:03:50:31]
LMP: Yes. Can you see it at all, Gene?

[00:03:51:20]
LMP: Got one little chunk coming out - it just came out of the SLA, and It's spinning along the long axis, and it looks very stable.
     CC Roger.
     LMP Every once in a while, a small particle flies off of it though.
     CC How big of a chunk are you talking about, Jack?
     LMP Say again?
     CC How big an item are you talking about?
     LMP Oh, I - reference to the thrusters, about the same diameter as the thruster on the LM.
     CC Oh, Roger.
     LMP That's how long it was, and about - oh, a fifth that thick or that wide.
     CC Roger.
     LMP And I don't think - I don't think it's more than a quarter of an inch or maybe even less thick.
     CDR That same particle, Bob, came by and as it went spinning, it was throwing off pieces of itself -radially out.
     CC Roger. We copy.

CDR: There's a small one come floating by and it looked like flakes. And I think I caught three of the four SLA panels going as we were maneuvering. I've got one out the hatch window now. It's quite a ways out.
     CC Roger.
     CDR It's tumbling in all three axes.
     LMP And I saw the fourth one out my side, so we saw them all.
     LMP Area around the two spacecraft is cleaned up pretty well by now. There are just a few fragments moving around.
     CMP Now she's coming in.

[00:03:54:58]
LMP: Rover looks in good shape, so far.
     CC Roger, Jack. Can you see down on that quad? Is that what youԲe looking at?
     LMP Yes, I'm looking right at it. And I got a good view of the MESA top anyway. It's pretty well covered, but it looks all right also.
     CC Roger.
     LMP All the antennas look good; thruster quads all look great. I could see all four of them a minute ago.
     CMP Okay, about 10 feet there, Gene. Stand by for a ... on the barber pole.

     CMP We had one clear fire, maybe one or two latches and then a ripple fire on the rest.
     CC Roger.
     CMP And, by the way, I had a good view into the ACT, and I can still look in there, and it's very clean.
     CC Roger.
     CMP In fact - -
     CC Ron and Gene, we saw your MASTER ALARM. Did you have any - anything on the matrix light up?

     CC Roger, We're working some words up here. We'll be back with you in a second on that, Gene.

[00:03:59:33]

     CDR And, Houston, in case we didn't tell you, it's talkback A that's barber pole.
     CC Understand. We have it.
     CC Say - say, Gene, we don't think it's a problem. We'll find out what it is when you get in. We think we should just press right on with the Flight Plan checklist and keep going.
     CDR Okay, we concur with that. Okay, we'll press on, Bob.

[00:04:01:38]
CDR: Okay, Bob. We just got a MASTER ALARM when I went to the RETRACT PRIM, from 1 to OFF.

[00:04:08:44]
CDR: Okay, the DELTA-P is coming down, Bob.
     CC Roger.
     CC Gene, while you're watching that, I just thought you'd be interested. We talked to some of our friends down at the Cape who watched the launch , and they said you were aglow all the way until you faded into - you couldn't tell you from a star. They saw staging, and they could just see you as a star way off in the distance until you faded out. Not a cloud in the way at all.

[00:04:09:31]

[00:04:16:43]

     CC Roger. We copy that.

[00:04:17:00]
CDR: And the cabin pressure's about 4.5. You want us to wait until 5 psi for the EMERGENCY CABIN PRESSURE SELECTS?

     CC Understand, Gene. All of them are locked.
     CDR Let me give them a good check.
     CMP Yes . You'd better check them, because we got a barber pole on that one.
     CDR Okay, here's one that *** over.
     CMP What is the position of it?
     CDR 7 #**
     CMP 7 and 9?
     CDR Hey, Bob. Maybe we aren't all going to be so happy.
     CC Go ahead.
     CDR Okay, 7,9, and 10 - the handle is flush; the bungee is vertical, but the handle is not locked down, and the - and the red button is showing. And I can pull each one of them back slowly. I haven't done anything with them. That's 7, 9, and 10.
     CC Roger. We copy that. The handle is flush; the bungees are vertical, but the handle is not locked down, and the red button is showing on 7, 9, and 10.

     CC Roger; understand.
     CC Geno, go ahead and try the handle on 9 and 7; and, if that doesn't work, cock them and refire them starting with 9, please.
     CDR Okay; the handle doesn't work. I'll have to recock them.
     CC Okay.
     CMP When you trip it with your - did you cock it twice?

     CC Roger. How about the barber pole now?
     CMP Okay. Wait a minute, I've got - DOCKING PROBE MAIN A circuit breaker's IN and gone to RETRACT, and it's gray.
     CC Okay - -
     CDR Aha! That did it.

     CC And -

[00:04:25:47]
CDR: Okay, Bob. Cocked 7 twice and tripped it, and it's overcenter and locked.

CMP: Okay, DOCKING PROBE circuit breakers are OUT and EXTEND/RETRACT is OFF.

     CC They're your NOUN 22 attitude maneuver for APS burn out of the hatch window. They're in the middle of the page L/3-5-
     CMP Oh, okay.
     CC Instead of 270, we want 274.
     CMP Wait 1. We're not quite with you.

     CC Okay. You notice there's three angles there -270, make that 274.
     LMP Okay. That the only change?
     CC And the - N, the next one, the 129-8, change that to 164. And 4.3 on the yaw, change that to zero. It's close enough; zero on the yaw.
     LMP Okay. We got them 274, 164, 00.

     CMP I see what you mean (laughter).
     LMP РРHg and 0^ flow into fuel cell 3 - well, actually, in all three fuel cells, look pretty good to you?
     CC Jack, the flows look just right for the current.
     LMP Okay. Used to seeing them more or less lined up, and I hadn't calculated any further than that.
     CC Roger.
     LMP 02 - 02 seems a little higher H , relatively speaking.

     CMP Okay, we'll verify them again. We doublechecked them.
     CC Okay, we just didn't hear your call and we want to make sure of that. Didn't want to miss anything here.

     CDR Yes, we can see it. You've got the GO for the yaw
     CC Roger. Thank you, 17-
     CDR Looks like she came out of there clean as a whistle.
     CC 17, Houston. The yaw maneuver will be starting in about 4 plus 52, a little less than 2 minutes from now.

     CC Roger, 17. Yaw maneuver started.
     LMP The old S-IVB had a flare for the dramatic, but it certainly did its job for us.
     CC Roger, Jack. Preliminary data indicate that you are about as nominal as you can be.
     CDR That's the way we'd like to keep it, Bob.
     CC You'd better believe it.
     CDR Okay. She's - as we're looking at it, she's pitching up. She was looking right at us - we were looking right at the dome - and now she's pitching up. The shroud around the IU seems to be totally intact. It - it looked like a super clean separation. I can't really see where there's any paint or anything externally chipped off the -the booster from here. We're beginning to - to pick up the bell. It's really a shame you don't have this - this whole thing on TV; it's really quite a sight.
     CC Roger. We concur with that.
     CDR The Mylar and the gold coating on the inside of the shroud that's now visible is also intact. It looks like you could use it again if you could get it back.
     CC Well, it's got a job to do when it hits the Moon yet.
     CDR Okay, Bob. We've - we're almost looking at it broadside now.
     CC Roger.
     CDR Okay. She's spitting a little; looks like the yaw maneuver may be complete.
     CDR We got a - full view of the - entire J2 from here; and no kidding, Bob, the whole bird, the shroud at the top by the IU, the separation plane down by the S-II, from here all looks as clean as a whistle, all the way.
     CC Roger, Gene. If you're happy, we'd like a GO from you for the evasive burn.
     CDR Okay. You're going to burn on the boosters plus X-axis, is that right?
     CC That's affirmative.
     CDR Let's get a picture or two here yet, and we'll give you a GO.
     CC And, Gene, it'll be about 7 minutes until the evasive burn; 5 plus 03.

     CC Roger. That's a good data point. Have you gotten a good look at any of that weather down there on the Antarctic?
     CDR Well, on Ron's window number 1 - maybe he can tell you a little about it.
     CMP You know, it's yeal funny there in Antarctica the -You can see the snow, but there isn't any weather at all in it. All of the weather's around it in the water.

     LMP That's where the moisture is. I don't know what to take a picture of.
     CMP I can't see the U.S. at all.

     CDR Go ahead.
     CC Look's like you've got a superconservative CMP up there. We've run off some numbers - Looks like you used about 40 pounds of RCS on the T&D, and you've used about a total of 42 pounds RCS total; so we're hanging right in there. Beautiful.

     CC Sounds like a winner, Gene.
     CDR Okay.
     LMP I guess you saw that one, Houston. That had no caution or warning with it.

     LMP Yes, sir.
     CC How about the LEB?
     LMP ... say again. (Laughter) You caught me. I forgot to look. Keep after us; we'll get you that data point.
     CC Roger, Jack.
     LMP Gene's got his hands all over panel 2, which probably is what caused it.
     CC Jack, we think that might have been a real one due to the accumulator cycle with the 0^ makeup flow going on there - it gave - it held the 0£ flow higher for - greater than l6 seconds.

[00:05:11:35]
LMP: Well, that's certainly a possibility. We didn't notice it - Looked upright at the time. But it -Sure that was the right time?

     LMP Well, I'll tell you it's a different world without that old one g on you. The old suit's a little bit friendlier.
     LMP And, as you may have noticed, Bob, we've come to the end of the Launch Checklist.
     CC That's affirmative, and we've put ours away for posterity. We also stored it with our TLI zero data that we worked so hard to generate.
     LMP Well, I'm just happy - didn't - use it. That view of the Earth for a rev there was something I was looking forward to and I was not disappointed.
     CC That's great, Jack.
     CDR Bob, you've got a pretty good size storm over the north - I guess the northwestern coast of India, where it starts to wrap up and around to the west. It's a - rounded out on the horizon, so I can't make out exactly where it is too well.
     CC Roger.
     CC Could we get a read-out on the LM/CM DELTA-P?

LMP: Plus 0.4.
     CC Roger. We copy that. '
     CDR Bob, Antarctica is what I would call effectively just a solid white cap down on the - South Pole. There's definite contact between the continent and the water. But, as Ron said, most of the clouds seem to be very artistic, very picturesque - some in clockwise rotating fashion but appear to be
     CC Roger.
     CDR The continent - the continent itself is - is the same color as the clouds; but, of course, more dense - and striking difference than any of the other white background around because you can definitely see that contact with the water and with the clouds over the water.
     CC Roger. Understand. There'll soon be a comm switch over to Madrid here shortly. We may break ... in just a few minutes here. Or a few seconds, rather.
     CC And you might watch - your accumulator's going to cycle in about 20 seconds here. Let's see what happens on the MASTER ALARM.

CMP: You're loud and clear, Bob, and could you give us our distance from the Earth?
     CC Roger. I'm looking up at the board. I'd guess at about 19,000 miles. Want me to get it exact?
     CMP No, just approximate's good enough.
     CC 18,100, FIDO says.
     CDR Okay. And I suppose we're seeing as 100 percent full Earth as we'll ever see; certainly as I've ever seen. It appears to be - it may be a little bit - a little bit of a terminator way out to the -well, to the east - out beyond Australia and beyond India. But beyond that it's about 99 percent pure.
     CDR Bob, it's these kind of views - these kind of views that stick with you forever.
     CC Roger, Gene.

[00:05:22:39]
_extra : third of the - of the world. We can see the Sinai; we can see up into the Mediterranean; we can see across the Mediterranean, although we can't quite make out the countries up there; we can see across into India. I catch a glimpse of Australia out in the far horizon. Got Zanzibar on the southern tip of Africa, the Cape down there just almost directly below us. And, I don't know exactly how big Antarctica is, but I guess we can certainly see more than 50 percent of it. And - the rest of it is all ocean. The Indian Ocean out into the Pacific Ocean and back into the Atlantic Ocean. And for the most part relatively clear of clouds except in the Antarctica region, and up towards Europe which is - which is on the horizon, across the Mediterranean, it looks like there might be some clouds back up in that way. I probably -probably - well, not probably - I can make out the entire coast of Africa from Mediterranean around to the west, coming back to the south back where it takes its big dip to the east , back around the Cape, back around up through the Suez Canal, almost perfectly.
CDR: We've got a - I guess probably the continent of Africa dominates the world right now. It's covering the - oh, the upper third - upper and western
     CC Roger. We understand.
     CDR And there's one batch of clouds in northern Africa, just a small batch, it looks like it may be up near the - well, no, it's not near the mouth of the Nile; it's quite a bit west of that, as a matter of fact, I can see the mouth of the Nile; I can see it running straight down towards us as it parallels the Suez and then sort of fades out into the central darker brown or darker green portions of Africa.
     CC Roger, Gene. Sure be nice to have that on TV, wouldn't it?
     CDR Boy, I'd love to give it to you; any way I could.
     CDR You know - and there's no strings holding it up either. It's out there all by itself.
     CC Roger. I just was - going through the 17 status report on CSM systems and, boy, everything is absolutely nominal, with the exception of glitching MASTER ALARMs that we're trying to ntii.l track down; but every other system is just nominal. Everything is great.

[00:05:26:01]
_page : 68
_tape : Tape 6/10
CDR: Okay. Sounds good. That's the way they built it for us.
     CC Gene, looking at our plot board, you're directly over the southern tip of Africa or just slightly out in the Indian Ocean there, according to our plot board, which isn't exactly accurate all the time. But shortly you're going to start going backwards on the Earth here and head back across the Atlantic. That ought to be some sort of a first. You cross the Atlantic twice, going from west to east, and then, now you're going to cross it going from east to west here shortly. All in a very short span of time.

[00:05:27:40]
CDR: Yes. I guess that does sound like a first.

[00:05:29:53]
CDR: Bob, I can assume that from what you said there will be - probably not be a midcourse 1?
     CC That's exactly what we're working towards, Gene. And I - I'm sorry I didn't convey that feeling to you a little earlier. There's no reason for mid-course 1 right now.
     CDR Okay. Because we prefer to press on and get the suits off and hit the sack rather than make It, unless we have to.
     CC That's for sure. Roger. The earlier data showed us midcourse 1 would have been less than 3 feet per second, and we wouldn't have done it. And the dataԳ been fluctuating, but they're smoothing it out, and it's still holding that way; so we won't be doing it, probably.
     CDR Okay. Very good.
     LMP Bob, I'm looking over Gene's shoulder here at the Earth, and it must be an awful clear day for the so-called convergence zone across Africa. Gene, I think, Indicated, as it looked to us as we crossed it earlier, most of Africa is clear. Only some - probably are broken and scattered clouds -cumulus in the east central portion that are running along the line of - north/south lines.
     CC Roger.
     LMP Looks like a major circulation system off the southern tip of Africa, as Gene mentioned, plus one west of that, 20 or 30 degrees of longitude. Make that east of that.
     CC Roger.
     LMP And, southwest of the - make that south southwest of the tip of Africa at Cape Good Hope, there looks like an incipient circulation system developing about half way between the coast of Antarctica and Africa. If I had to guess, it's going to swing up north towards the Cape and - and then swing west The whole pattern, ... it looks like now, is a fairly equally spaced cyclones that are sort of circling around the Antarctic continent, as we can see it now.
     CC Roger, Jack.

[00:05:33:50]
_page : 69
_tape : Tape 6/11
LMP: But I would guess that South Africa is going to have good weather for several more days, at least. And if the pattern is - is apparent in the clouds we see is correct, the last disturbance I mentioned probably is going to pass south of the Cape also,
     CC Roger. Understand.
     LMP As we were going - over our daylight around the Earth in orbit, it was very clear looking at the various clouds, Bob, what were high clouds and what were low clouds, particularly when you had them together. The high clouds cast very distinct shadow patterns on the lower ones and, very commonly, had entirely different orientations -pattern orientations. The low ones seem to be more associated with arcuate front patterns; whereas, the high clouds were generally transverse to that, roughly north/south directions. That's not completely general observation, but I noticed it several times.
     CC Roger. Understand.
     CC I just noticed on the plot board here, it looks like you're come up on 20,000 miles out, right about now.

[00:05:35:27]
_page : 70
_tape : Tape 6/12
LMP: It feels like about, 20,000 miles.
     CC Okay.
     LMP Bob, I have the first hint of contamination on window 5* It's covering, probably, the central -well, I'd say, - roughly around - it's square about - 7 inches in - on the side with a very thin film that's catching the sunlight; and slightly irridescent, but also very finely granular - very finely granular. You can just barely tell what it is, actually.
     CC Roger. Understand.

[00:05:37:45]
LMP: Looks like very uniform in thickness right now.

[00:05:46:31]
LMP: Bob, this is Jack. We've got a UCTA dump scheduled, or is possible, at 6 o'clock. There's nothing sacred about that time, is there?
     CC Nothing at all. Whenever you're ready, just go ahead and dump.

[00:05:49:03]
LMP: Okay.
     LMP Bob, one of the things that we miss in our training is a good geography lesson, and particularly on Antarctica. I got the monocular out, and apparently the dark band that Gene - Ron mentioned as interface between the continental water is that between the pack ice and the water. And you can, by very subtle changes in the apparent smoothness of the ground, probably make out where the actual continent begins and the pack ice ends. There are a few exposed ranges, I guess it's midsummer down there now, and you can make out the snow-free areas scattered at least in the northern portion of the continent.
     CC Roger. Did you get any pictures of that, Jack?
     LMP Oh, yes. We got some pictures earlier. I'm going to get another one here in a minute. I'll tell you, if there ever was a fragile-appearing piece of blue in space, it's the Earth right now.
     CC Roger.

CDR: And we got a MASTER ALARM.
     CC Okay. We copy that.
     CDR And there's one in the LEB.
     CC Okay. Good data point.
     CDR And there are no caution lights.
     CC It came right ... accumulator cycle, along with the high 0^ flow again.
     CDR Yes, I just checked the time, and I think you are right on that one. Well, we gave you your LEB data point.
     CC Yes, sir.
     LMP The problem with looking at the Earth (laughter) particularly Antarctica, is it's too bright.
     CC Understand.
     LMP And so I'm using my sunglasses through the monocular, which is not the best (laughter) viewing platform. I think I can see some of the areas of the Dry Valley, but, again, I'm not too sure of my geography, Bob. There are clouds over the continent, I believe. But, of course, they're just as white as the snow, and you only see differences in texture brought out by - probably varying photometric return because of fairly low sun angles down there.
     CC Roger.
     LMP But you can see patterns of what I believe is pack ice - leading off from that sharp interface that was talked about earlier. And those patterns seem to merge directly with the patterns of the clouds as if the - at least near the continent -the oceanic currents are controlling the air currents, up to a point , along with the movement of the pack ice.
     CC Roger.
     LMP I'm distinguishing the pack ice from clouds mainly by the angularity of the patterns within them. There is no good clear color or albedo distinction. So, I could - I could be looking entirely at clouds, but I suspect there are some pack ice patterns, too. I'm not keeping you awake, am I, Bob?
     CC No, sir. Just keep talking; we're listening. And I'm sure not much of the world is listening, but this will all be recorded, and you can read it all when you get back and think it through and tie it up with the pictures. And I'm sure there's going to be people interested in this. And we're interested ourselves; just keep talking.

[00:05:53:29]
_page : 72
_tape : Tape 6/l4
LMP: All I want to do is read what I say.
     CC Roger. If I had a little more geology training, I'd be asking you some better questions. I'm afraid, right now, I can't think of anything to ask you.
     LMP Well, I can't - I really wish I knew that geography. I don't know - I wish I'd thought of bringing a good map of Antarctica. Could somebody do a little researching for me and see if they could tell me if we're - have a Little American view - say on the eastern edge of the continent?
     CC Roger. We'll see if we can get some Antarctica geographers around.
     LMP Yes, I'd like to - and, also, whether or not they think the Dry Valley area is visible to us. Let's see, there's some - some of the people over there in Bill Bennett's group, I think, have a little Antarctic experience, or used to. They might be able to help you out.
     CC Okay. We'll see what we can track down on it.
     LMP Don't use up a lot of people's time on it, but -but I'd be interested.
     CC Roger. It's getting pretty empty around here. It's 5:00 in the morning, so - (laughter)
     LMP Okay. There is a good strong northern hemisphere cyclone up near India, and I think Gene mentioned that. It, I think, was one I saw in some of the forecast sheets as a dissipating hurricane or typhoon. I'm not sure which it is there. I guess it's a typhoon. And I see something here that I noticed in Earth orbit, Bob. That as you approach the terminator - and now I'm looking at the eastern terminator - have to keep all my directions straight here - yes, eastern terminator. The clouds - those associated with the cyclone over India and one that's - appears to be due south of there - maybe 30 degrees of latitude - have a gray appearance. The - instead of the brilliant white of other clouds as you approach the terminator, those - at least the high level clouds are gray. Now, when we were going over them in orbit, the lower level clouds were still white, and I think I can see a hint of that right now. The Sun gives a strong light reflection off of the buildups in the low-level clouds; whereas, the high-level and probably layered cirrus and maybe some of the intermediate level stratus tend to look gray because of grazing Sun, I suspect.

[00:05:56:46]
_page : 73
_tape : Tape 6/15
CC: Roger. You mentioned something in Earth orbit that kind of intrigued me. You mentioned seeing the rainbow, and we were trying to figure out how you saw a rainbow up there. And you were in orbit already at that time. Do you remember that?
     LMP Well, - we're not - we were speaking of the merits of the sunrise.
     CC Okay. Roger.
     LMP Of having a banded color appearance that varied as you approached sunrise. I can't remember what we - I think we put some of that on tape, and we were probably LOS at the time. But the banded character of the sunrise in the atmosphere was very, very marked. There was a gray-blue upper layer followed - that merged or graded Into a brilliant blue intermediate zone that was just above the cloud levels. And within the clouds, you cot a orange to yellow band, getting more yellow as the Sun rose, that was broken by the dark patterns of the buildups.
     CC Roger. Good show.
     LMP The interesting thing was the continual glow on the horizon we had, even at night, on the darkside pass -And that glow was in the atmosphere because I could see stars rise over the horizon in it and then pass on through it.
     CC Roger. You were talking - the airglow, I guess, is the phenomenon most of the guys had seen before. It's kind of Interesting, huh?
     LMP Yes, that's - that's right. It's interesting - I guess standard airglow, but it is very striking that it's a continuous thing even in the dark pass.
     CC Roger.
     LMP I think I did see the eastern tip of South America, now.
     CC Roger. You're starting to back up now, coming the other way. So you're still over Africa, according to our chart here, but you're backing up towards the - South America.
     LMP Yes, I can see the part of South America that Mercator thought that fitted in with the bend in Africa so many decades ago and started people thinking about moving continents around on the crust.
     CC Roger. Jack, how'd the PGA doffing go? Most of you - are you all out of the PGAs now?

[00:06:00:01]
_page : 74
_tape : Tape 6/16
_extra : together, that the - any frontal systems that move off the Antarctic continent do not take on any well-defined character until they get into the ... regions of the ocean. And when they do, they seem to pick up an arcuate circ - circulation that, in the view we have, seem to get fairly regularly spaced cyclone patterns that lie between the Jape of Good Hope and northern portion of Antarctica.. And these - circulations of cyclones follow roughly an east/west pattern, and the curve - and the arcs of the fronts are more north/south than - let's say northwest, swinging around to the south./nlook like they're as concentrated and localized. More like just masses of fairly dense clouds that are developing in that band of green that crosses the lower portion of Africa.
LMP: That's in work. We're taking it slow and easy up here, Bob.
     CC Roger. Understand. I'll just be curious to see if they all fit in that bag.
     LMP I think you'll find that Ronald Evans will also be curious about that. He's already made comments.
     CC Roger.
     LMP Bob, you certainly do have a very clear inlui t, i v<-impression, although the evidence is hard to pull
     CC Roger.
     LMP All of them - all of them very - very nicely defined as southern hemisphere cyclones. There are about four of those visible swinging around -oh, I guess, that's latitude - I'm having to guess here, but I'd say latitude 50 to 60 south.
     CC Okay; 50 or 60 south on that, huh?
     LMP Yes, I have to look at the map here in a minute and see if that puts me between Antarctica and the Cape.
     CC Roger.
     CC Well, the tip - the tip of Africa there is at about 32 south.
     LMP Well, that sounds like a pretty good guess, then. It looks like the intertropical convergence zone over Africa is starting to get more and more clouds in it now. I suspect as midday approaches, which is what we're seeing there, we can expect to see more and more moisture indications.
     CC Roger. They're - they're probably about noontime right there right now. It's 11:36 at the zero meridian at Greenwich, so it's just a little bit before noon right in that area you're talking about.
     LMP Yes, some of those masses of what I suspect are cumulus buildups - well, not really. They don't

LMP: Stay tuned for the next installment on the Earth. IԬl try to get out of this suit.
     CC Okay. Just take it easy, Jack, and we'll be listening.
     LMP Man, I've never taken it so easy in my life. I'll tell you, Bob, I couldn't have believed this would be an experience like it is now.
     CC Roger.
     LMP Every time you turn around, there is something else to see and wonder what's causing it. Whether it's a particle zipping across the window, or one zipping across the cabin, or spring mechanics here in zero g; there's always something going on.
     CC Roger.

[00:06:10:20]
LMP: Bob, if I'm not waking you up, an observer from another planet certainly - probably could decide that we have such things as clouds and at least large thunderstorms because right at the terminator you get a brightening of the sunlit side and a long, long shadow out to the - out to the east that is reminiscent of what we saw in the early days looking at the Moon at the terminator.
     CC Roger.
     LMP However, in the next pass around, I'll bet you wouldn't see them.
     LMP I've never been a big - Well, I didn't grow up with the idea of drifting continents and sea-floor spreadings, but I tell you, when you look at the way the pieces of the - of the northeastern portion of the African continent seem to fit together separated by a narrow gulf, you could almost make a believer of anybody.
     CC Roger. It's beginning to look like the globe that you might buy down at the store, huh?
     LMP Oh, I don't think so, Bob. (laughter)
     CC Okay.
     LMP I don't think we'd better put this one up for sale. Somewhere there might be somebody who would like to buy it.

_extra : down now. We're wondering, did you all close the waste storage vent valve?
CC: Say, Jack. We noticed the 0^ flow has dropped
     CMP I don't think so; let me check on that. It might have gotten closed inadvertently in this game we were playing down in the LEB.
     LMP Ron says it's still on VENT.
     CC It's on VENT. Roger.
     CC Okay. We're noticing the flow is coming back up slowly; so something caused it to drop, and it's coming back up.

[00:06:13:42]
LMP: Okay.

[00:06:18:09]
CC: 17, Houston.
     LMP Go ahead.
     CC Jack, just to ease those words I said before, we looked at the schematics here a second, and you'd be dumping urine out of that same line as that waste vent, and that would probably cause the pressure to build up enough to slow the 0^ flow. And we noticed that the 0^ flow is climbing back up to where it belongs.
     LMP Well, that's clever. Okay.
     CC Didn't mean to worry you there. Shouldn't have said it, I guess, before we looked at the schematic.
     LMP Oh, I really hadn't started to worry about it yet, Bob, so no sweat.

     CC Seven degrees south and 8 degrees west, Jack.

     CC Read you loud and clear, Gene.
     CDR Okay.
     LMP Bob, LMP's going off the air for a little while.
     CC Roger, Jack.
     LMP It sounded like a sigh of relief.
     CC No, sir. Been enjoying listening to you; keeping -keep me awake down here.
     LMP You had a long day.
     CC Not as long as you've had.
     LMP I've just been lying around, floating around.
     CC You make it sound so good.
     LMP Piece of cake. I111 talk to you in a little while.

     CC Go ahead, Ron.
     CMP Okay; we had another MASTER ALARM, and I just glanced up and it was the MAIN A UNDERVOLT light that was on, just for a second.
     CC Okay. Ron, we didn't see anything at all on MAIN A down here. We did have an ACCUMULATOR cycle again. Don't know if that ties in or not.
     CMP Well, the MAIN A UNDERVOLT - I just happened to be looking right at the panel and the MAIN A UNDERVOLT light blinked on for a second. And, of course, obviously, MAIN A is up now.
     CC Roger.

     CMP That little MASTER ALARM there, I can't be absolutely positive, but out of the corner of my eye, I think it was the SUIT COMPRESSOR light that glitched.
     CC Okay. We copy that. You - we believe down here it was the HIGH 02 FLOW.
     CMP Well, they're pretty close. I thought it was red and I thought, okay; that's good. That's the right time, I guess.
     CC Okay; because we'd just called it out. I was just read for you 5 seconds before you called me.
     CMP Very good, Doctor.
     CC Roger. And Tony is back in Houston on the console.
     CMP That's hard to believe. What are you doing back there? We're - we haven't even had time to go to sleep.

     CDR Go ahead.
     CC Roger. We've been discussing the question of what your sleep configuration is going to be in terms of headsets or not, particularly with reference to all of these various MASTER ALARMs. And I guess we'd feel better if one of you guys slept with his headset on. We were curious as to what your plans are?
     CDR Bob, since I've got to wear the biomed anyway, I might just as well go ahead and keep it on.
     CC Okay. The other option is for us, - if we were trying to get hold of you - is to put the Klaxon up. But we're a little - un-in-favor of that, because of the possibility of one of these spurious things waking everybody up that way.
     CDR Yes, I'll go ahead and keep it on and see how it works out for a while.
     CC Okay. We copy that. And, when you guys are ready, we have a couple of - we have three items to read up to you, three updates in the Flight Plan.
     CMP Okay. Go ahead, Bob.

[00:08:15:34]
CC: Okay. The first's in the Flight Plan itself, and it's the quads for the PTC spinup, and they'll be Alfa and Bravo.
     CMP Okay. For PTC spinup, quads Alfa and Bravo.

[00:08:16:06]
CC: All right, we just took that back. It should be Bravo and Delta for spinup; Alfa and Bravo only for damping. Copy Bravo and Delta for spinup; Alfa and Bravo for damping.

[00:08:17:45]
CC: And, 17, if you have that, I have two others. One in the Flight Plan Supplement Book, and the other one is in the G&C Checklist.
     CMP Okay. Go with the Supplement.
     CC Okay. In the Flight Plan Supplement, we have an E-LOAD update on page 1-43. Okay; 1-43 - give me a call when you get to that page.

LMP: Okay, Bob. This is Jack. I'm going to be moving into the presleep checklist here. Are there any things you want to change or alter in that? Are you ready for the waste - waste stowage vent to be closed?

[00:08:23:30]
CC: Roger, 17. We're ready for the vent valve to go closed. WASTE STOWAGE VENT to CLOSED. And we have no anticipated changes, at the present time, in the Flight Plan, Jack.
     LMP Okay, I'm just looking at 1-29 in the presleep checklist and - wondering if there was anything there.
     CC Stand by, Jack.

[00:08:24:43]
CC: Okay, 17. For antenna management tonight, we'd like you to select OMNI Bravo at the current time, and stow the high-gain antenna. And we'll take care of managing our antennas from here on.
     CMP Okay. We'll give you OMNI Bravo and stow the high-gain.
     CC Okay.
     CC And, Jack, we indeed do not have anything to add to the presleep checklist tonight.
     LMP Okay.

[00:08:25:56]
LMP: And - with your concurrence, I'll take the H FANS all to AUTO now.
     CC Stand by.

[00:08:26:07]
_page : 86
_tape : Tape 8/6
CC: Roger. We're ready for that. All to AUTO.

[00:08:27:10]
CC: Okay, Jack. I guess that you - we're not quite sure what you said or meant there - or what - what it is. In the Flight Plan itself, we want H2 HEATERS 1 and 2 to AUTO, and we want FANS, on tank 3 only, to AUTO. They're three there for Hg tank 3.
     IMP Okay. You're teaching me to read carefully early, aren't you?
     CC We're trying. The 1 and 2 HEATERS will be in AUTO and 3 FAN will be in AUTO.

[00:08:27:46]
LMP: That's the way it is now, and consider the fans have been cycled.
     CC Roger.
     LMP According to the checklist, you might look at the third line on 1-29, and look at the H^ line on the Flight Plan, and see why I was confused.
     CC Roger. We were just discussing whether or not there was a fan or fans in each tank.
     LMP That ought to keep you awake this morning.
     CC Going to take something.
     LMP What I was really trying to do, Bob, was get out of chlorinating the potable water, but you wouldn't bite.

CC: Okay. WeԲe going to give you a little high-gain antenna practice here. We'd like to pick up with the high-gain antenna again so that we can get your PTC or can watch your PTC develop. We'd like you
     LMP Okay. You want the higji gain selected, I presume.
     CC That helps, yes.

     LMP Oh, I don't expect that'll be the last time you have to apologize. I think we're running about even now.
     LMP You're missing quite a view, Bob. Sorry you're not here.
     CC That makes two of us. White just said; "That makes three of us."
     LMP What are you trying to tell me?
     CC Look out.
     LMP Who's your friend off on your right, tonight?
     CC Wally Moon, would you believe?
     LMP Say again?
     CC Wally Moon.
     LMP Oh, a Moon, huh? Why don't you ask him what he's reading at H^ tank 3 quantity?
     CC Okay. Iԭ asking him.
     IMP In percent.

[00:08:34:05]
CC: Okay, 17. On tanks 3 of H^, we're reading 84.38.

[00:08:34:13]
LMP: Okay, it looks like we're reading almost the same nowadays.
     CC Good.

     CMP Okay. We'll see if we can't get it right this time.
     CMP Houston, 17.
     CC Go ahead, 17.
     CMP Does it make any difference with the plus or minus roll there with the - now that you are going to use the high gain?
     CC Okay. Well, the Flight Plan says minus roll, why don't we do it that way?
     CMP Oh, okay.

[00:08:38:59]
CC: And after you start the roll, 17, we'd like to go back to OMNI Bravo and stow the high gain.
     CMP Okay.
     CC We only needed the high gain to just keep a good check on your rates.
     CC And, 17, that means stow the high gain after you -after the startup. We'd like to watch the startup itself.
     CMP Okay. I was just going to ask you when.

[00:08:42:18]
CC: Okay, 17- We're ready for high gain to stow and select OMNI Bravo.
     CMP Okay.

[00:08:49:35]
CC: 17, Houston. We gather you're ready for sleep, almost. One thing we'd like to check at the end here is your 0^ heater configuration. Over.
     CMP Okay. Go ahead, Bob .
     CC Roger. Can you give us your 0 heater configuration?
     CMP Okay. We've got 1 and 2 in AUTO, and 3 is OFF.

     CDR Well, I'll tell you, it was (laughter) looked forward to.
     CDR Give us a few minutes here and we'll - get operational.
     CC Roger. Give us a call when you're ready to talk to people.
     CDR Okay.

[00:15:09:44]
CDR: Yes, from the looks of things, Bob, down there, it looks like getting off last night was a good idea.
     CC Got a new CAP COM now, Geno. Why? Looks kind of cloudy down there?
     CDR Yes. Hello, Gordo. How you doing? Yes, I'm looking - oh, we're probably directly over - just west of the - out in the Pacific, but abeam of the bottom third of South America, I suppose. And I've got North America, Mexico, and the U.S. on the top third - the top 25 percent of the Earth. And it looks like you've got cloud cover from somewhere where the coast bends around Corpus right on north into the Great Lakes and is completely out into the Atlantic, including covering Florida out there.
     CC Roger. I can verify the part between the Cape and Houston, anyway.
     CDR Yes, the Gulf looks like it's pretty well filled with clouds. Looks pretty thick from here.
     CC Roger.
     CDR However, if you're interested in going to South America, the whole continent looks - looks pretty good. A few clouds; but, for the most part, you can see the entire continent.
     CC Roger. Guess it's summertime down there.
     CDR Okay, Gordo. We're - we're stirring slowly. We'll get back with you here.
     CC Okay.
     CDR Gordo, one question. How does the spacecraft look to you? I didn't hear anything all night long as far as any MASTER ALARMs or anything.
     CC I'm getting the word that nothing was seen here either. It looks absolutely super.
     CDR Very good.

[00:15:15:26]
_page : 93
_tape : Tape 13/2
CDR: Okay, Bob - or Gordo, I've got H2 HEATERS 1 and 2, OFF, now.
     CC Roger, Gene.

[00:15:16:54]
CDR: Hello, Houston; America.
     CC Go ahead, America.
     CDR Okay, Gordo. I'm looking over the Flight Plan today. We'll be with you with the postsleep checklist, and primarily it looks like a P23 day for Ron And what we'd primarily like to do is spend a good part of that time getting the spacecraft cleaned up, reshuffled, restowed a little bit, and get it in order for the next few days ahead. It doesn't look like today's that big of a day.
     CC Okay. Geno, I might give you some words on what we have in mind to get the GET back in sync here, if - if you want to hear those while you're looking through the upcoming hours.
     CDR Yes, why don't you - why don't you pass a few words on that?
     CC Okay. The plan we're considering, and we're offering it to you now for your opinion, is at 65 hours GET, we'll update, and at the time the clock goes to 65, we'll update it 2 hours and 40 minutes to 67:40. And we're shaping your trajectory such that you'll arrive at the Moon at the same time G.m.t. as you would have had you launched on time. In other words, your translunar time is 2 hours and 40 minutes less. So once we do that, we'll be back with all the right times in the Flight Plan without any updating. And the one thing we think of is that your next day will, which is now a 16-hour day, will shorten to a 13-hour and 20-minute day-. But that's about the only real effect we can see. How does that sound?
     CDR Yes, we - we'll get to the Moon, you say, the same G.m.t., so all our sunrise, sunset, lunar-orbit activities, and Sun angle at landing will be the same. And let me - I'll - It sounds pretty good, Gordo. I just want to take a look at that day that you're shortening and see what we're doing in there.
     CC Okay. It doesnԴ cut out anything. In fact, we picked a time that's pretty much dead time as far as the Flight Plan goes. Take a look, and we'll talk about it later.
     CDR Okay.
     LMP Good morning, Gordy. This is Jack.
     CC Good morning, Jack.
     LMP Let me fill my square on the postsleep checklist. I've got 24030, PRD.
     CC Okay.
     LMP And I slept in and out - probably totaled about 4 hours in that last period. But I feel pretty good in spite of that, and expect now that I've educated myself on how to sleep, that it'll pick up the next time around.
     CC Roger.
     LMP No medication yet, but I'm considering a couple of aspirin. I'll let you know if I take them.
     CC Roger.
     LMP And, fluids? Let's see, I guess I've had two of your little water-measurement-containers-full so far, plus the meal I had in my pocket. And I'll catch up on - I think I'm a little dehydrated. I'll catch up on fluids with breakfast.
     CC Okay.
     LMP And my meal yesterday was the meal B in the pocket.
     CC Roger. Meal B.
     LMP And I guess consumables update. That's mainly yours.
     CC Roger.
     LMP There's plenty there. And I'll wait for your words on that. And the watch is wound.
     CC Roger. Okay. Got the consumables update numbers, if you're ready to copy.

     CC Roger.
     LMP Gordy, this is Jack. How do you want to send the consumable - consumables information?
     CC We were just discussing that here. Used to - in flights gone by, there was a place in the Flight Plan, a little form to fill out. But we're trying to figure out if there is such a place in the current data file. Do you know of one?
     LMP Well, I'll tell you what I've got. I've got the consumables curves, and if there are any major changes to those curves, I guess you could give them to me, and I'll put them on as points.
     CC There's no - -
     CDR Hey, Jack.
     CC - - changes at all.
     LMP Okay. And why don't we just do it that way in the future in case there is anything. And that's on page 1-45 and subsequent in the Flight Plan Supplement.
     CC Okay.
     LMP Looks like you took good care of my space - my systems last night.
     CC No troubles at all.

LMP: Okay, Gordy. Your friendly medical officer up here has some more information for you. CMP, continuing, had about 3 hours of sleep, had - three cans of fluid - of water, that is. And he ate everything In meal B but the fruitcake, and he didn't use the brownies and the beverage in meal C.
     CC Okay.
     LMP Okay. And continuing, the CDRs PD - PRD is 17019. He had 3 hours of fair sleep, no medication, and 1-1/2 cans of water, and one-half a sandwich. The CMPs sleep was 3 hours. And I'll try to get more systematic as we go along here.
     CC Okay.
     CC Jack, we are assuming no - no medication on the CMP. Is that right?
     LMP That's affirm. We havenԴ gotten that kit out yet
     CC Okay.

LMP: Gordy, this is Jack. Looks like the windows have cleared up pretty well in PTC from the - ice crystals, anyway, that were on window - window 1. The hatch window still seems to have a film of something on it. But, otherwise, they look pretty good.
     CC Okay, sounds good. Jack, while you're there, I might try - we've been talking about consumable updates and what would be the most meaningful way to give you the information. As a trial, for 14 hours, with reference to the charts in the back of the book, which in the case of - in case of all of them, are listed in percentages except the RCS, which is in pounds. On the cryo quantities, when I take all the tank percentages and plot them, it turns out that there's no real significant difference from the lines that are plotted on either hydrogen or oxygen. On RCS, you're running about 3 percent ahead of the line. And if thatԳ a satisfactory way to put it, that's the way weԬl give you the - the updates rather than giving you every tank percent by percent. Over.
     LMP Okay, that's good. That's outstanding.

[00:16:12:20]
LMP: MARK. Two aspirin for the LMP.
     CC Roger, LMP.
     CC Jack, next time the Surgeon would like a mark on each individual aspirin.
     LMP Well, I gave it to you since I swallowed them both simultaneously.
     CC Roger.
     LMP I knew they wanted that, Gordy, and that's why I only gave you one.
     CC Okay.
     LMP Would they rather have them go down one at a time?

_extra : there. You can go ahead with a P52, but before you do the P23, we have some updates to it.
CC: 17, Houston. We see the optics starting to stir
     CMP Hey, okay, Gordo. We'll do that.
     CC 17, Houston. Can you confirm that you did change the LiOH canister before going to sleep last night?
     CMP Well, we can confirm that we didn't. How about that?
     CC Okay.
     CMP We'll - Thanks - thanks for reminding us. We'll try that first thing this morning. I was just getting too tired, and the CO^ didn't look quite that high last night, so I - -
     CC Roger.
     CMP - - I let it go.
     CC Okay, that's - that's fine. We're not concerned about being late with it.

[00:16:46:22]
CMP: Okay.

[00:16:53:15]
CMP: Okay, Houston. That looks like a pretty good one that time. You note the star angle difference?
     CC Roger. We copy.
     CMP Okay (chuckle). I can't see squat out through that telescope. I just hope it lines it up and does the right thing. Okay. Those are the torquing angles, and you can let me know when you have them.
     CC Okay. Stand by.
     CMP The telescope is no different than any other time. There is just a lot of reflection from the lunar module. And even though everybody said that before, you don't quite believe it until you see it yourself.
     CC Okay, Ron. You're clear to torque it.
     CMP Okay. We'll torque it at 54 30.
     CC Okay.

[00:16:55:35]

_tape : Tape 14/2
CC: 17, Houston. When you - if you can find a stenographer, I got some dictation, some pads for you and also a Flight Plan update.
     CMP Stand by 1, Gordon.

[00:16:57:49]
LMP: Okay, Gordy.
     CMP P37.
     LMP Oh, okay. Stand by. Okay, Ron's ready to copy.
     CMP P37 pad's first.
     CC Okay. Okay, the P37 block data for 35 hours. Well, we've got 35, 45, 55, 65. GET ignition of 035:00. DELTA-Vt is 5326, minus 175, 081:39. For a GET of 045:00, 7728, minus 177, 08l:l8. For a GET of 055:00, 5859, minus 175, 105:30. GET of 065:00, 4703, minus 175, 129:40.
     CMP Okay, I'll read that. Let's see, 35:00 at 532o, minus 175, and 81:39¥ At 45:00, 7728, minus 177, and 8l:l8. At 55:00, it's 5859, minus 175, 105:30. At 65:00, it's 4703, minus 175, and 129:40.
     CC Okay, that's correct. I've got a maneuver pad for you. It's a flyby maneuver at a time of 8l hours, which is 5 hours prior to L0I, This is required because you're presently on an impacting trajectory. And this is assuming you wouldn't do midcourse 2. Midcourse 2 will put you on a - on the proper trajectory. If you can get a maneuver pad out, I'll give it to you.
     LMP Okay. ThatԳ in work.

[00:17:02:23]
_page : 101
_tape : Tape 14/3
CMP: Okay, Houston. This is 17. Ready for the flyby pad.
     CC Okay, Ron. We were just watching your roll angle. You're going to - we're going to be updating the optics cal attitude. And the roll will be lo4, and you're coming up on that. Maybe you want to stop the PTC near that roll angle.
     CMP Hey, that's a good idea.
     LMP Gordy ...
     LMP Gordy, did you read Jack?
     CC Loud and clear, Jack.
     LMP I can take the pad, if you want to while Ron stops PTC.
     CC Okay. Why don't I give you the update to the Flight Plan, since that'll give you the new attitude and also the - change in the star for the P23. And then Ron can get on with that. The pad we can get after that.
     LMP Go ahead.
     CC Okay. Turn to 17 hours in the Flight Plan, page l8.
     LMP Go ahead.
     CC Okay. The "VERB 49 maneuver to optics cal attitude" right at the top of the page. Cross out the attitude numbers and replace them with "Roll l64, pitch 301, and yaw 348 at a high-gain pitch angle of minus 48 and a yaw of 315." Over.
     LMP Okay; 164, 301, 348, minus 48, and 315¥
     CC That's correct. Now go down a few lines to the sighting attitude at - one's at 17 hours and 15 minutes. And cross out that attitude and the high-gain pitch angle and change to a "Roll of 196, pitch 304, and yaw 348." High-gain pitch is minus 6l, and the yaw remains the same, 357. Over.
     LMP Okay, 196, 304, 348, minus 6l.
     CC That's correct. And now, on the first star of P23, we're going to change the star, so cross out - replace the NOUN 70 numbers with star 21. That would be three balls 21. And delete the NOUN 88 and the vector numbers there.

[00:17:06:25]
_page : 102
_tape : Tape 14/4
LMP: Okay, start 21 and no NOUN 88s.
     CC Right. And over on the right where it says "Merak," you can write in "Alphard." That's what 21 is.
     LMP Okay.
     CC Okay. Now down on the next pate, at 18 hours 20 minutes, where it says "Optics calibration attitude." We got to put in the same thing as -the same change as above. We want, instead of "175, 298, 330," change that to "l64, 301, and 348. High gain of minus 48 and 315." Over.
     LMP Okay, l64, 301, 348, minus 48, 315. Over.
     CC Okay. Now, about 10 lines down, delete "Charge battery A." We're going to leave battery A charged for a while longer, since we used up so much of it on the pad last night.
     LMP Okay. Delete "Battery charge A," and you want to leave it on B.
     CC Yes. Right. Flip the page. Might as well clean up all of these checklist changes. At 19 hours 40 minutes, change "Magazine Kilo Kilo" to "Magazine November November."
     LMP Okay. That's done.
     CC And then skip a few pages to 24 hours and 30 minutes
     LMP Go ahead.
     CC And just above the "CSM Systems Checklist" callout there, write in "Charge battery A."
     LMP Okay, I got you.
     CC And weԬl be leaving it on battery A all night long. Okay, that's all the Flight Plan changes. I've got that flyby pad when you're ready.
     LMP Okay, I'm all set.

     LMP Okay, Strangely enough, that's even scheduled at 35:30.
     CC Roger.
     CC I have one reminder to open the WASTE STOWAGE VENT valve as shown on the - at 17 hours there.
     LMP Oh, okay. We were just going back to clean up. I think we owe you a LiOH canister change, too.

[00:17:16:25]
CC: Roger. We concur with changing it.

[00:17:20:15]
CMP: And, Houston. Apollo 17 will maneuver to the optics calibration attitude now.
     CC Okeydoke.
     CMP It's funny eating potato soup, and all the soup is all around the outside of the bag. And you get a little hole right down through the middle of it.
     CC How about that?
     CMP It's just like in one g. The spoon isn't quite long enough to reach the bottom without getting your fingers on the side of the bowl.

[00:17:21:09]
CC: Roger.

[00:17:24:11]
LMP: Gordy, I don't know what your weather is like down there, but from here it looks like you're probably overcast today. Might even have a pretty good storm going.
     CC Well, it's gray and cold and a little rain, so your - your cal is correct.
     LMP Yes, it looks like Mexico, in general, is pretty nice, although there is a band of east-west trending clouds that start from the Gulf of California, cross Sonora and probably up through New Mexico, and over into Texas as far around as I can see. Southern California looks like it's in pretty good shape today, but northern California looks like it's probably overcast. And a major system probably associated with that that stretches into the northern western United States. But a band of clear weather looks like it stretches from Arizona right on up through, I would guess it - through Colorado and Kansas and probably into the Midwest pretty well.
     CC Roger. You're a regular human weather satellite.
     LMP If Ron would just stop his maneuvers I'd tell you some more, but the Earth just set behind the LM.
     CC Roger.
     LMP More specifically, it set behind the Rover, which may be a space first. Pretty impressive storm system down off the west coast of Antarctica.

LMP: And, Houston. The canister has been changed. Number 3 is in A as per the earlier Flight Plan instructions.
     CC Okay.
     LMP Sorry we were late, but we got a little tired last night.

[00:17:28:57]
CC: Jack, Houston. We'd like you to go ahead and get that WASTE STOWAGE VENT open now, so we can keep to the schedule on cabin enrichment.
     LMP Okay; Ron is getting that. Keep nagging.

CMP: That the same as I had before?
     CMP Hey, that looks like a pretty good optics cal right there. That's three times. Okay. No, that's not very good.
     CC Ron, we're copying your comments.
     CMP Okay. Think we'll use that one there for the optics cal.
     CC Roger.

[00:17:37:07]

CMP: Okay, we're CMC OPTICS ZERO'S OFF and ... Now letԳ see if we can see the old star in there.
     LMP Gordy, this is Jack. You guys did a good job fixing that MAS - MASTER ALARM problem. What did you do?
     CC Jack, did you call?
     LMP I was wondering what you did to fix the MASTER ALARM problem.
     CC Let me check and see.
     CMP (Laughter) Yes, I've got to find the subsolar point. A little bit of an error looks like. Let me see, we'll fix it down a little bit. That really jars us back, doesn't it?
     CC Jack, I guess all we've done is wish it away, Actually, we think it's still there, and you may -you may get them here later after the waste stowage vent - 0g flow gets on up.

     CMP Okay, there's the old star. Works just like the simulator; you can't see the star when it goes down in the Earth.
     CC It's still being worked on, Jack. Though we don't have any real concrete story to give you on it yet
     LMP Okay, it seemed to be pretty quiet last night, so that's the only problem. Okay. Gene, you want to give me CMC FREE?

_extra : information about progress in the talks. President Nixon selected Claude S. Brinegar, a California oil executive and a doctor of economics, to be Secretary of Transportation succeeding John A. Volpe. Volpe will become the U.S. ambassador to Italy. Here's one concerning last night's launch. Mrs. Spiro Agnew reportedly made a wish on a falling star just before the delayed launch of Apollo 17-Sitting beside her at the VIP viewing site was Barbara Cernan, who said that she was nervous when the lift-off was postponed. She added, "But A1 Bean was there with me. He said not to be concerned." Mrs. Cernan was accompanied by her daughter, Tracy, and her mother, Mrs. Jackie Ashley. Mrs. Ron Evans, who saw the launch with her children, Jamie and John, said that she was never worried because everybody knew what they were doing.

     LMP Hello, Houston; 17. Are you reading?
     CC Go ahead, Jack.
     LMP Yes, you got any news today - to read up to us?
     CC Well, yes. As a matter of fact, we have a little bit made up here. I guess along the personal line, we checked with Barbara and Jan and the kids, and they're all back home safe and sound and they mentioned that they're going into their own personal quarantine period, glued to the squawk box. Over.
     CDR Okay.
     CMP I was afraid you were going to get too personal there, for a minute. (Laughter)
     CC I'll run down a few quick summaries of this morning's news. Former President Harry Truman has rallied slightly, despite his weakened heart and labored breathing. His doctors report that their main worry is whether his heart is strong enough to withstand the strain, the physical strain of 88 years. Despite the slight rally, Truman's condition is still considered critical. In Paris, Henry Kissinger met with Hanoi's Le Due Tho for 4 hours yesterday in planned secret talks. Paris newspapers report an imminent cease-fire, but neither Kissinger or Tho indicate that this is true. After the 4-hour talks, Kissinger shook hands; and ... - got a little typo error here -but neither representative made any comment concerning their meeting. At Camp David, Maryland, President NixonԳ press secretary, Ron L. Ziegler, said that Kissinger and Nixon are in close communication by cable concerning the secret peace talks. But Ziegler declined to provide more

CMP: Hey, Gordy, we haven't really had a clear and detailed description of what you or somebody else saw at the launch, in terms of the lighting around the countryside, the state of the flame, and how long the - exhaust was under the S-IC. Do you have anything to add to that?
     CC Well, I can give you my feelings, anyway. It was a spectacular sight, and no doubt about it. I'd say the level of illumination would have made it easy to - to read a newspaper or anything like that from my vantage point near the VAB. The -the plume itself actually looked no larger or - or even any brighter, really, except in contrast, than it does on a day launch by comparison. But -well, the effect, I guess, was about what I expected just trying to extrapolate previous launches into a nighttime situation. The weather was very clear. That was one advantage gained by delaying the launch the 2 hours and 40 minutes that you did. By that time, there were very few clouds around at all. And we could see a brilliant flash there when the first stage cut off and the second stage ignited. And I lost you visually probably, oh, 4 to 5 minutes into the second stage, as best I can remember. Part of the problem was the brightness of the plume during the first stage, it kind of burned a spot on my eye; and so then I was -had reduced efficiency at looking for a small

Although, in reality, all we're trying to do here is get a DELTA-H measurement anyhow. And, Houston, do you have any feel yet for what the DELTA-H is - line has been?

[00:18:16:14]
CC: Stand by, Ron.
     CC Ron, this is Houston. We're not going to be able to give you a handle on the DELTA-H until we have a chance to take all the data and reduce it and work it around a little.

     CC Sure am enjoying your descriptions.
     LMP Well, if I could get Ron off his - work with the optics, we'd look at the Earth some more. But that will come. Right now I'm seeing all sorts of little ice crystals of various composition, (laughter) that are moving around, and every one of them bounces off the LM that I can see. No, none of them stick. I noticed that some of them will go into a corner with a fairly high velocity and either be turned around by a double bounce, or just get lodged in the corner and have very low velocity when they come out.
     CC Roger.
     LMP Most of them look like they have at least a foot or 2 per second.
     CC Roger.
     CC Hey, Jack, I was surprised when you said when you got Ron off the optics. Don't tell me that Ron is going to let you look through his optics.
     LMP Oh, heavens no! We just move the windows. (Laughter)
     CC (Laughter) Okay.

     LMP Stu, apparently you get - do get some particle/ particle collisions, because some of the trajectories are back towards us.
     CC Okay; we're waiting for the explanation of that.
     LMP Well, I think it's because the particles and -some of them, you know, are bouncing off the LM and get out into the stream, which normally would have no collisions. How's that? You can say it's not very good. I don't care.

LMP: Bob, did you ever find out what part of Antarctica we were seeing at various Earth orientations?
     CC Jack, I've - I tried that this afternoon, and I couldn't get hold of anybody, and I looked on a map for a while, and I - I'm not sure where Little America was. I can't truthfully say I did it - get it. I'll keep looking at it.
     LMP Okay. I - at any rate, it looks like thereԳ a very well-developed front coming out of the northwestern portion of Antarctic ice shelf. And -and it - let's see here. Well, stand by 1.
     CC Roger.
     LMP Have to change windows.

[00:19:58:25]
LMP: Okay, Bob. That front looks like it starts and develops as a small - it - it actually seems to start with an anticyclone development off the coast of Antarctica. Moves up across New Zealand. Looks like the South Island primarily, a little bit of the North Island is still visible and into the eastern coast of Australia. And I'll give you a spot where it intersects and crosses the whole of Australia. However, it - it breaks up and is not very well formed, once it gets inland away from the coast. I see no well-developed waves on it at this time, so it's hard to say how strong it is. There might be one developing just to the south of New Zealand or right off the coast of New Zealand.
     CC Roger. I copy that, Jack.
     LMP There at least is some sinusoidal motion or appearance to the front ... And you'll have to wait, because I lost it again.
     CC Roger.

     CC Jack, Houston. Was that - were those pictures of those fronts you are talking about?

[00:20:02:59]
LMP: Bob, I got our orbital map out now, and that front is going off across to the coast of Australia north of Sidney and largely a little south of Brisbane and - and swings across the whole of Australia and seems to come - near as I can tell, go by into the Indian Ocean about - well, where the Great Sandy Desert intersects the northwestern coast of Australia.
     CC Roger, Jack.

CC: 17, I've got a Flight Plan update here.
     LMP Stand by, please.
     CC Roger. It's just a short one. One item to change.
     LMP Well, if you saw my hands right now (laughter), you'd know why I said wait 1.
     CC Understand. I'm Just - just waiting for your call. Just didn't want you to think weԲe going to give you a whole rafter of it.
     LMP Oh, we know you wouldn't do that.
     CC If you're eating, Jack, just go ahead and eat. This is nothing that can - we can just wait, and any time, just go ahead.
     LMP Yes, I'm not panicking.

LMP: Okay, Bob. Go with the update, and LM/CM DELTA-P at 20 ... 09.
     CC Want you to know, Jack, we just cut out by the antenna switching. Say again the LM/CM DELTA-P.
     LMP Okay, 0.6 at 20 plus 09.
     CC Roger. Okay. My update is just simply on the botton of page 3-23 at 2300 hours in the Flight Plan or 23 hours in the Flight Plan. "WASTE STOWAGE VENT valve, CLOSED." Just delete that one, and move it over to 24:30, ThatԳ because you got started late on that.
     LMP Okay. You could've just said, move it.
     CC Okay. Just change it down to 24:30.
     LMP 24:30.

[00:20:11:48]
_extra : anticyclone circulation is centered on the ice shelf. And I think that - well, I Just don't know. I think that's the Ross Ice Shelf, but I'm not sure, off Antarctic. And the clouds from that circulation do extend over the ice shelf and barely into the Antarctic con - continent.
LMP: Okay. Bob - about revision one on my previous discussion of the weather around Australia. That front does cross. Probably Brisbane is probably cloudy. It does cross about that area, and - however, there is a bank of clouds that runs off of it down the coastline. So Sidney is either cloudy or has some pretty nice clouds off - off shore. And the remnants of the front as it dissipates in the hinterland of Australia dies out at about the Great Sandy Desert, and there is not a good indication that it crosses into the Ind - Indian Ocean. But we're getting over near the LM, and that's a little hard to tell.
     CC Roger.
     LMP Now, it - more - looks more and more like the cyclone circulation developing right over the top of New Zealand; the South Island, I think. And now I'm looking with the binoc, and as much at
     CC Roger, Jack.

[00:20:13:46]
_page : 122
_tape : Tape 16/4
LMP: Now to the north of Antarctica. Let's see now. I ought to give you a better orientation than that. But, anyway, there is a large cyclone circulation pattern that has its southern extremity right on the edge of the ice shelf. And that - that is east by 20 or 30 degrees of longitude of the front that I just was discussing. By the way, that front intersects Antarctica.
     CC Roger, Jack.

[00:20:16:21]
LMP: Between New Zealand and Australia, the front I was discussing previously has some fairly strong transverse cloud patterns. It's hard to say whether they're high cirrus or not. But the clear area to the south of the front suggests that maybe the jet stream is roughly paralleling that front in that area.
     CC Roger. I'd have to look up and see - -
     LMP If I had to guess, I'd -
     CC - - if they do have any jet stream down there right now.
     LMP I - if I had to guess, if you were flying - west from Sidney this afternoon, you'd have a pretty strong tailwind behind you, Bob.
     CC Roger.
     LMP Let's see, did I get that right?
     LMP Would you believe a headwind?
     CC Okay. I'll believe that.
     LMP But the bulk of Australia is very clear, all the south and the north. It's just that one line of -of clouds that crosses the center section.
     CC Roger.

[00:20:18:45]
_page : 123
_tape : Tape 16/5
LMP: That put all the major cities of the south, Perth and Adelaide, at least, and Melbourne, certainly in the clear. And in the North Darwin, in those areas, are very nicely clear today.
     CC Roger. I hope we can get this out to them and let them know that you're watching and tell them how good the weather is.
     LMP Oh, that's all right. I'm just having fun, Bob,
     CC Understand. I imagine they'd appreciate it though.

[00:20:34:06]
LMP: Bob, I tried to pick out the Hawaiian Islands on that last little turn here through window 5. And I can't say that I did. I think I've got them -the area spotted. It looks like they might be under some fairly heavy cloud cover today. I do not see the islands. I'm not sure I could, if it was clear.
     CC Roger. Hey, Jack, I got some answers to your question from last night on where Little America is with respect to - on Antarctica.
     LMP Go ahead.
     CC There's a - inden - indentation that looks like a gulf that's called the Ross Sea, and on the northwest edge of the Ross Sea is Little America, That's the location of it.
     LMP Okay. And that would be the coast of Antarctica that sort of faces New Zealand and Australia. Is that correct?
     CC Negative. According to the map I've got, it's -the Ross Sea looks like it would be more facing up towards the South America area. It's actually kind of facing up sort of the middle between Australia and South America, Jack.
     LMP Okay, Bob. You cut out, and I presume you meant that - the Ross Sea was facing north - sort of the Pacific between South America and Australia?
     CC That's affirmative, Jack. It's a very sharp indentation or sea or gulf onto the Antarctic.
     LMP Okay. I think I know the area you mean, and I'll check it out again when it comes by.
     CC Okay. That's Little America on that west-northwest edge of that Ross Sea. That's where Little America is.
     LMP Yes, all that - those names are familiar. I just had forgotten my geography. I'll see if I can recognize them.

[00:20:50:13]
_page : 124
_tape : Tape 16/6
LMP: Okay, Bob, checking on the Ross Sea, and if I've got her pegged right, it's got a fair amount of open water in it this time of year.
     CC Roger.
     LMP Although it's completely surrounded, I think, completely surrounded, I think by portions of the icepack. And off to the west of there, it looks like there's an area that might be - clear of snow, and - does my memory serve me correctly, that that's where McMurdo Sound is, and some of the dry valleys?
     CC I believe so. That's the Little America area right now, all that general vicinity, Jack.
     LMP Okay. It looks like the prime recovery area and the Samoa Island region is clear, and my guess would be from the fairly subdued zero phase point, that they might have fairly nice seas out there. The boys on the Ticonderoga are probably enjoying themselves immensely, I hope.
     CC Roger.
     LMP Indonesia looks like it's having a nice day, with the possible exception of the region over just north of Australia. New Guinea and that area they - some clouds in there. I can't tell whether they are high or low clouds though. They look like they're probably fairly high clouds. But north of New Guinea, there's a strong concentration of clouds. Although small, it looks fairly dense like there might be a little tropical depression in that area.
     CC Roger.
     LMP The folks in Carnarvon ought to be enjoying a very nice day.

LMP: I've been trying to spot tropical storm Teresa, which is - a couple of days ago was in the Philippines. But I can't - I don't think I quite have that visible to me right now.
     CC Roger, Jack. Say, you might want to put something in the back of your mind here a minute. We made a run of the DSE recording just now of the TLI to get an idea of the quality of the DSE recording, and Gene came through loud and clear. Ron was very weak and almost unreadable, and we never caught you, Jack, in there. We don't - maybe you weren't saying anything during TLI, but we never did catch anything you said.
     LMP Okay. I don't recall talking too much during TLI.
     CC Roger. Understand. Now Gene - Gene came through real loud and clear. So whatever technique he was using went on that tape real well.

[00:20:55:48]
_extra : this - this really makes a difference, because the DSE - The volume is - is fairly low, and if you're muddled just the least bit, why, it - it's going to be difficult to pick it up. So talk slow, and - and get right up next to the mike, because I know you - you're doing it. Just some voices come across a little better than others.
CC: Hey, Jack; Houston.
     LMP Hello.
     CC Hey, Jack. Just a couple more comments on that DSE. I think, as you well know, it's very critical on the position of your - of your boom there, and those areas that you're critical in, why, make sure that you've - you've really got those beauties up or you're talking right in - right into it. And
     LMP Roger, Stu. Thanks for the comments. As a matter of fact, you probably called it just right. I think during - once I got the helmet off, I lessened up my chinstrap, and my mike booms had moved away from my mouth some. And I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the reminder.
     CC Yes. It's - that's probably the most critical item is that - is the position of those, and this has been true of - in the past, and it just really makes a difference in - in that - being able to pick up the data off the voice.
     LMP Roger. I've - Ron and I did some experimentation with that in the chamber, and couldn't agree more. But I sometimes don't remember it. Thank you.
     CDR Well, Stu, I just - -
     LMP I - I ύ
     CDR - - thought I'd -
     LMP Okay. Go ahead, Stu.
     CC No, I was saying I was - I'm sure you - you're aware of that, but I think the fact that the volume is - is down just accentuates the - the problem.
     LMP Okay. Gene had something he wanted to ask you.
     CDR Stu, I - I just thought you'd like to be aware of it, as much time as we've all spent down at the cape, probably May is one of the nicest months down there. However, having had the opportunity to - to be up here during May, I find out that it's not nearly as nice up here.

     CC Roger. We wouldn't go away, Jack. We're listening. Did you call?
     LMP Well, I just - Yes, I almost lost a pass here, and just a couple more words about Australia. As a -as a general landmass, it's red. Very strong red hues, except for the north and eastern coasts, where that red gradually merges into a greenish-gray. ItԳ as - as red as portions of - of northern Africa appeared to be yesterday.
     CC Roger.
     LMP Very striking color. It would be more of an orange-red, really, with brown subduing it. It's not -obviously not crimson or anything like that.
     CC You think it's a function of Sun angle, Jack, or is it just - just a red like we see out in New Mexico area sometimes - some of the areas?
     LMP Yes. No, it's not Sun angle, because that'll hold a good red color right - right in towards sunset or sunrise. It's - it's due primarily, I'm sure, like most desert areas, to the oxidation of the iron-bearing minerals in the sands and rocks in those regions.
     CC Roger.
     LMP Getting limonite and hematite. Little geology thrown in there , Bob. Sorry.
     CC That's all right. Got to keep you warmed up for the next couple of days.
     LMP Well, I think the Flight Plan will probably keep me warmed up, too.

_extra : the windows - but I could definitely see it. Of course, it disappeared in short order. When the S-II shut down, the delay time between shutdown there and the S-IVB igniting, the entire - the entire flame overtook us, and we literally through -flew through the S-II flame when the S-IVB ignited, if you can imagine that. It's very similar to the Titan staging, where you actually fly through tne fireball on the S-II. And that's something you never see - none of those things you ever see quite that way in daylight. On the S-IV, I could see -Of course, once we got going, I couldn't see any light from that plume again, but we could see the APS firing all the way through the burn. And once we got in orbit, as other guys have seen, you could see the APS firing at night without any difficulty. One of the most significant things about TLI is the fact that we, of course, started at night and flew right on up and through a sunrise, which in itself was a pretty spectacular thing. But, when you do it during a TLI burn, it even adds a little bit of momentum to your effort.
CDR: Okay, Bob. The entire boost itself was not unlike what you've heard and what Stu down there understands from the physical cues, and what have you. But the significant part of going at night is that as soon as we did have ignition down there in the bottom of the S-IC stack - even though I only have a little slit out of - out of the rendezvous window here, and Ron doesn't have much of a hole in the boost protective cover out of the hatch window, we could definitely confirm ignition because we could see the reflected light on out through in front of us. It was by no means blinding, of course; we had the cockpit pretty well lit up. We - as soon as we lifted off, that light immediately went behind us We came into just S-IC staging, and I had an opportunity to say, "I told you so," to Jack and Ron. It was just like the great train wrecks of the past. I definitely could see the S-II ignite; and, then, of course, the - I could see the significance of the reflection through the window, besides all the other cues we had for ignition, very much like the S-IC lit up the windows on the stack. Tower jett was pretty spectacular. I could see - the entire boost protective cover and some flames from somewhere -I'm not sure - maybe it was through the hole in

_extra : in a dynamic phase of the burn. But my window just gave me a very deep purplish hue, a hue of which I could not, literally, see through to look to see any stars at all. Now, that may have been due to the very low intensity of our interior flood lights.
CC: Roger, Gene. Any comment you might make on the possibility of picking up your yaw, if you'd lost your platform at that time - remember the discussion we had about the yaw in the late - like a Mode IV or something like that?
     CDR Yes, Bob. I not only will comment - I was aware of it, and I was looking for it. And during parts of the S-II and parts of the S-IVB burn, I even turned the lights down in the cockpit - in hopes that I could see stars out there; but I could not make out a one. Ron, I think, may have saw Saturn out the overhead hatch; but looking through the rendezvous window, during a boost phase and during a time-critical phase like a Mode II or Mode IV, I am very much afraid that we would not have been able to pick up that reference.
     CC Roger.
     CDR As I remember it, as low as I had the interior lights there for a period of time - and I didn't want to keep them that low, of course - to see if I could get adapted very fast because we were

_tape : Tape 17/4
CC: Roger, Gene.
     LMP Bob, this is Jack. A little lay impression there. I think I - saw just about everything Gene was talking about - as far as his description - and felt like it was - although everything was an amazing experience, each one in itself, after each one was over, you could think back and say, "Yes, that's what other guys said it was like." The old Saturn V has got to be a pretty consistently performing vehicle. But - with the added night-time contrast, I think it made it probably the best ride any three guys have ever had.
     CC Roger.
     CDR Bob, I might add, that the S-I was, as usual, pretty shakey on lift-off. I saw all the maneuvers as I called them out - the yaw and small reverse roll. Going through max q, I got up to 25 percent; but my yaw attitude error was zero and my pitch attitude error probably wasn't even at -oh, certainly less than 2 degrees. After max q, she smoothed out by comparison quite a bit ; and the S-II was a very quiet ride, a very smooth ride. However, you are always aware, due to just a little rumbling out in the S-IVB, that she was still burning for you. The S-IVB, I think, was just a continually - rumble but smooth or consistent ride, all the way through TLI.
     CC Roger.

[00:21:22:06]
_extra : streaming away from it. I could not see - did not notice or remember seeing the actual cover or tower itself; but I - we were inside the cone of the burn and with a lot of streaming. It looked very much like a sky rocket - portion of one at any rate. Reminded me of the Fourth of July out in Silver City a few years ago.
LMP: Gee! I think one of the big things that impressed me was the - how instantaneous the decelerations were of each one of the boosters when they cut off. That included the S-IV TLI cut-off. No physical appreciation of tailoff at all.
     LMP And, Bob, from my rendez - from the right-hand rendezvous window when the tower jett occurred, there seemed to be a lot of burning particles
     CC Roger. Say, any time you got your Flight Plan handy, I've got a discussion here I'd like to run through with you on the - how we're going to recover those 2 hours and 40 minutes from the launch delay - and you'll need to copy it into the Flight Plan. And then just wanted - want you to be advised, we're not happy with the PTC. We get a half angle of about 17 degrees; and so sometime after the P52 coming up at 23:00, we'll want to do another PTC, or initiate PTC again.

[00:21:24:05]
_page : 132
_tape : Tape 17/5
CDR: Well, that was the commander who initiated PTC, and I've already heard about that.
     CMP (Laughter) You bet he has. Okay. We've got the Flight Plan here, Bob. Which part of it are you talking about ...?

[00:21:24:17]
CC: Well, let's just talk some words here for a minute, and then I'll go through some specifics that you can just write down on a page because you don't want to do it until a little later. Okay, what we're going to set up here - You will arrive at lunar orbit at the same GMT time. The landing Sun angle - Sun elevation angle - and the camera settings and everything will be unchanged when you get to lunar orbit. To compensate for the 2 hour 40 minute late launch, we're going to hack 2 hours and 40 minutes out of the timeline. And we're going to - They'll be out of the TLC timeline - and we're going to do it in two groups. And this is where you might want to start copying now, Ron. Delete 1 hour from 46 to 47. From 46 to 47, we're just going to delete the activities that are presently scheduled at 46 30 to 47 00, youԬl perform at 45 - move those to 45. Let me read that again. Delete 1 hour from 46 00 to 47 00. The activities that are listed at 46 30 to 47 = 00, perform at 4rj 00.

[00:21:25:41]
_page : 133
_tape : Tape 17/6
CMP: Okay, Bob, looks like we delete 1 hour from 46 to 47 hours. And then the activities that are at 46 30, we'll do those at 45 00.
     CC Roger, Ron. And then starting at 4 7, just take -just scratch 1 hour off of each time, just subtract 1 hour from each of those times up through 66 hours. Just subtract 1 hour from 47 up through 66.
     CMP Okay, we can do that. Subtract 1 hour from 47 through 66 hours.
     CC Okay. And then just for your information - you won't have to do it - but we're going to play the old simulator step-ahead game at 66 hours of the old time, which will be 65 hours of the new time. So however you want to call it, we'll call you; and we're going to sync you up at 67:40 at that point. WeԬl play the old step-ahead game there.

[00:21:26:44]
CDR: Okay, Bob. That means that you're not going to actually do any clock updates or syncs until -until somewhere in the 60's there and not in the 40's.
     CC Roger. It'll be 65 hours of the new time or 66 hours under the old time; depends on how you want to look at it. But that's when we 111 sync you up.
     CDR Okay.
     CC You'll be in sync all the way out to that time; just - we're just going to delete and jump you to 67:40.

[00:21:27:17]
SC: Okay.
     CC And just another note of interest - You don't have to write this down - what - let's see; I'll read it to you. The awake periods will be - on day 3, you'll be 15 hours, 8 hours sleep starting at 11:33 CST; then at day 4, youԬl be 14 and 20 hours, with 8 hours sleep. So - it actually just shortens a couple days there.

[00:21:27:49]
CMP: Okay. Mighty fine.
     CC The beauty of that - that Tommy came up with on that, Ron - is that all you have to do is go subtract those 1 hours and no more reading or anything else; just subtract them and we're in business.
     CMP Yes, it looks real fine.
     CC We're going to give Tommy a gold star for that one.

CMP: (Laughter) You bet.
     LMP (Cough) Bob, this is Jack. I'm going to try and get a little exercise. I'd be interested to know how high I can get my heart rate just fooling around up here.

[00:21:28:44]
CC: Okay, if we can - We'll keep you posted, Jack.
     CDR Bob, just to keep you and the people there thinking a little bit, today is a relatively short day; but it is a good day because it gives us a chance to again get acclimated finish our stowage and just generally go through all the things that have to be gone through for the rest of the mission. WeԶe got 3 eating days today, and judging from what we're thinking and talking about now - that the last two are going to be sort of stretched into one eating period because three meals on this particular day just is not really going to be stomachable.
     CC Roger. We understand that.
     SC I think you'll find out that our eating and drinking, for the most part, is starting off relatively slow; but - I think we'll pick it up here by tomorrow.

[00:21:30:24]
CC: Roger.

[00:21:33:18]
CDR: Bob, one other thing while Iԭ thinking about it. The PU shifts were all noticeable, but probably the one that really caught me a little bit by surprise was the PU shift on the S-IVB during -during TLI.
     CC Roger.
     CDR It just felt like you lit in the other burner.

[00:21:33:41]
_page : 135
_tape : Tape 17/8
CC: Roger. Understand.
     CC Just for Jack's information, you're running in the 80s on your heartbeat. We saw a 91 or 2 there for a few minutes. Are you working - still working out?
     LMP (Laughter) Yes. That's sort of discouraging.
     CC I'm sorry, babe (laughter).
     CDR Hey, Bob, what was Jack running before he started that?
     CC He was running in the 60s; the count's somewhere in the mid 60s.

[00:21:34:40]
CDR: Okay.

[00:21:35:29]
CC: Okay, Jack. You're running about 105 and 103 right now.
     CC Kind of interesting, Jack. You slowed down, and then you're back up to 105 right now. Now you're slowing down again.

     CC Okay. That was our network problem, not your problem on board.
     CDR Okay thank you, I just figured out what happened on my PTC. Here - with his exercises, Jack is shaking all of America in all three axes, here.
     CC Roger. He finally got to 115 on the heart rate.

[00:21:42:52]
LMP: Yes, my rate needles are bouncing back and forth a half a degree (laughter).

CC: Jack. Surgeon over here says you got a 120 on the heartbeat for a moment there - 122 right now. Okay, 130, Jack. 130. 140 , Jack, l4o.

[00:21:47:18]
CC: 17, we've got a serious one here. You might be interested. All that exercise banging around in there has destratified tank 3 , so it stirred it all up good.
     LMP Yes, glad we brought him along then. We found some use for him. Once an EEC0M, always an EEC0M. I have to ere - create my own g in order to run in place.
     CC Roger.
     LMP How high up did the heart rate get, Bob?
     CC We got you at l40, Jack. Were you running in place? Is that - -
     LMP l40 was - Yes, I was - I'm underneath the right-hand couch holding on to the main Y-Y strut with my hands and running against the LEB.
     CC Roger. It worked real well. l4o and you were running in the mid-60's, so you picked up about -almost 70 beats there, no problem. The surgeon is very happy.
     LMP Roger. Well, I'm happy too. You know, it took a while to find a technique I was - initially, I got up to 90 with just isometrics - pushing against the couch, and the running is obviously what it takes .
     CC Roger.
     LMP But I don't - Bob, I don't I really don't feel -I guess I lost you.

[00:21:51:33]
LMP: Hello, Houston; 17. You still there?
     CC Roger. We're with you. We had a little comm problem there as - you know, coning on this - as we were changing on the antenna - but we're with you.
     LMP Okay. What's the heartrate right now?
     CC Right at - Stand by. We ha.d a data dropout, Jack, that's why I'm holding up. And it just came on and we'll tell you in a second here. About 60, Jack. Right about 60 even.
     LMP Okay. That's where I was when I started, so that's - you certainly recover fast. I don't know whether that's faster than in one g or not.
     CC Well, weԲe happy with it - the Surgeon is happy with it, so it's good.
     LMP Well, I just - How does that compare - do they have any data on how that compares with the recovery - say, the 5-minute recovery time on the ergometer?
     CC We can look it up, Jack, if you're interested. We - we'll have to check your records, they don't have it right in front of us.
     LMP No big deal. I was just curious.

[00:21:52:54]
_page : 138
_tape : Tape 17/11
CC: Roger.

[00:21:55:47]
CC: Jack, just for your information - the Surgeons pulled out the recovery rate data and it's the same with our data, which is a little rough here. It's the same for zero g as your one-g ergometer data.
     LMP Okay. That's very interesting.

[00:21:56:12]
CC: Roger.

[00:21:59:43]
_extra : or film of frost - not very thick like crystals at all. As you come through the sunlight, it tends to sublime away, but never - you never fully lose it until you go back into darkness again. The very artistic definite ice crystals that we had on my number 1 window over here yesterday - I think we reported to you this morning that they were gone or they sublimed away. But the impression they left on the window is still there; it's very sharp and very evident.
LMP: Bob, since we've got a few moments to talk - which I know we won't have later in the mission. Something I don't ever remember happening, but it's happening now in the windows. That's the 1, 3 , and 5, but not 2 and 4, is that in the center of the window about 6 or 8 inches in diameter, as you come through the night side of the rotation, you pick up a very light - oh, you might call it even a frost. Very light frost on the window -more like a - a moisture frost, film of moisture,

[00:22:01:14]
_page : 139
_tape : Tape 17/12
CC: Roger. We copy that.

[00:22:02:38]
LMP: Bob, I don't know whether you were copying Honeysuckle's call to us, while you lost comm there for a while.
     CC Roger. We copy.
     LMP But they said that they had - -
     LMP Okay.
     CC They kind of concurred with your - -
     LMP Okay - -
     CC - - weather report there, Jack.
     LMP Oh, lucky guess. I might say that the sub - the zero phase point that we're looking at is right at the northeast coast of Australia, and it's much brighter. Very - it's a very bright point now -oh, it's hard to say how far across. But, quite unlike what I mentioned being in the vicinity of the Samoan Islands earlier. And it's right at the shore, and it could be just that the shore area has somewhat choppier seas. So maybe - maybe the brightness of that point is a function of sea state, although I don't know exactly what type of seas it would take to brighten it up. I suspect choppy seas are better than long swells.
     CC Roger, Jack.

[00:22:04:15]
_page : 140
_tape : Tape 17/13
LMP: That front is - seems to have slowed down its progress . It's about in the same position, possibly slightly farther north than when I started talking about it this morning. The wave that has - seems to be developing off the - now off the southwest coast of New Zealand is much more pronounced than it was. Definitely seems to now have a slight cyclonic pattern - clockwise pattern. And I wouldn't be surprised if the next couple of days that moves along the front over towards Sydney. And maybe a little farther north than that might -Brisbane is probably more likely.
     CC Roger, Jack.
     LMP Except I got the movement wrong again. Although it does seem to have progressed west from New Zealand.
     CC Roger.
     LMP I take back what I said about forecasting Sydney's weather. I think that will - I would suspect that would move to the northeast like - now that I look -it seems like an earlier front, which is partly dissipated, had the same kind of motion, and now lies considerably north and east of the one I've been talking about.
     CC Roger.

[00:22:06:46]
LMP: Thinking back on some weather briefings we had last week, Bob - Are you there?
     CC That's affirmative.
     LMP I'll talk to you later. I think you're - We're losing you for a little bit here.
     CC Okay, Jack. We're reading you loud and clear right now. Oh, you're going out a little bit now.

[00:22:10:36]
LMP: You back with us, Bob?
     CC ThatԳ affirmative.
     LMP Okay, I was going to try to recover there from that last few statements. As I recall, the weather briefings that we had at the Cape last week, that -talking with Ken Nabor and Jim Nicholson down there, that the patterns we were seeing from the satellite pictures in their forecast - or analysis anyway, charts in the New Zealand part of the Pacific, those waves formed along the front would move north and then curve east. And that appears to be the pattern that was visible in one of the older fronts. And I suspect if that pattern would hold with the wave that's developed off the coast - right on the coast of New Zealand now, that it might move on up the western coast of New Zealand. We'll probably have a chance to watch that the next few days and see what happens to it.

[00:22:12:44]
CDR: Houston, how are you reading now?
     CC Reading you loud and clear.
     CDR Okay, Bob. As I look at the clock, we're - just 24 hours ago we were about within our hold somewhere. For this period yesterday we were in our hold, and I think it goes without saying; but we'd sure like to pass on our bit of gratitude and thanks for the response that the people down at the Cape came up with. And particularly at Marshall. I think we all knew no one would be going anywhere unless everyone was satisfied that we were going all the way. And that's certainly the way we felt, but we do want to thank everybody who had a part in making that come true.
     CC Roger, Gene. I think it was a superb show between the Cape and Marshall and Houston and probably even Goddard, with the Network and just about everybody concerned, really, had to do some work there to bring it off. And it went off real smoothly.
     CDR Yes. After flying with Stafford a couple of times and having that happen a few times back, I thought maybe he was aboard.
     CC (Chuckle) Okay. I think that was a first for getting a Saturn V to 30 seconds before ignition and - or rather actually 30 seconds before liftoff and holding there.
     CDR It got mighty quiet onboard about 30 seconds.
     CC I sure imagine.
     LMP We all felt like old hands the second time around, though.
     CC Roger.
     CDR Bob, I've been at that 30-second count one other time and itԳ no different the second time around.
     CC Roger.
     CDR But we do appreciate the work, and I think it's typical of - of what made this manned space program such a superprogram. The response of people like that.
     CC We concur with that, Gene, wholeheartedly.
     CDR And with that in mind, tell everyone to stick around because there's a lot yet to be done.

     LMP Yes, sir. That's how we tell these days. Although it doesn't happen all the time, and I guess as long as - Whenever we have that WASTE VENT, CLOSED, we probably wouldn't be bothered by it at night.
     CC Roger. That's - that's our feelings here, Jack.

[00:22:21:24]
_extra : when launch and they noticed that when the booster lit up, something scared all the fish because the water literally began to boil with fish jumping from the light, I guess, or from the shock wave or something. It must have made a very distinct impression because that's the first thing both of them told me about.
CC: Say, Gene and Ron, I talked to your fraus on the phone here a little while ago, and they gave me a very interesting observation you might appreciate. They were standing close to some water
     CMP Yes, thatԳ pretty neat.
     CC A neat way to go scare up the fish, I guess.
     CMP (Laughter) Right.
     CDR How are they doing today, Bob?
     CC Really fine, really fine. They're just - like I said, they're just really tickled pink, and Barbara said that she wants you to know she's going into quarantine until after the weekend here, until after landing.
     CDR If she goes into quarantine, it'll be a space first
     CC Roger.
     CC You got to be careful - -
     CDR Well, you know what to tell them - -
     CC - - about all this.
     CDR Go ahead, Bob.
     CC You got to be careful now - The hotboxes are open -the hotlines are open at the houses there, so everything you say is being listened to.
     CDR Yes; okay. In that case, just want to say hello and we're having a super good time looking forward to what's coming, and we thank you for the news, Robert.
     CC Roger.
     CDR And my impression of the world, philosophically, I suppose youԬl be getting from time to time, but it sure hasn't changed.
     CC Roger, Gene.
     CDR It's sure beautiful. It's sure beautiful and, looking back at it, there's several billion people who have got a lot to work for because it's one of the most beautiful sights we've ever seen here.
     CC Roger, Gene. You guys are sounding great and doing real great. We're pressing right on here.
     CDR 1    just want to emphasize, Bob, that these first 2    days - of course, yesterday was a pretty good day, but today we're catching up and - and, as I say, on the food consumption, don't be expecting too much.
     CC Roger.
     CDR Acclimation and familiarity, and stowage and preparation, and enjoyment and relaxation - are ready to call it a day today, which is probably the most ideal day in the Flight Plan to put it, because it's probably the only one we'll have.
     CC Roger.
     CDR Not that they aren't all going to be enjoyable.
     LMP Hey, Bob, your hourly weather report is due and -(laughter) I'll wait awhile. I keep losing your comm.

CC: Okay.

[00:22:26:06]
LMP: Bob, you there?
     CC Roger, Jack. We're standing by.
     LMP Okay, I had a quick - quick look and just to bring you up to date, we're starting to be able to see the coast of Asia. The Philippines are wide open today. And the - that tropical storm Theresa that I mentioned I thought I could see - indeed, I'm sure that's what that little concentrated mass of clouds was north of New Guinea. And, I suspect, although I didn't get a good fix on it, that the folks in Guam may be in for some heavy weather.
     CC Roger.
     LMP Oh, and, Bob, I got another pair of pictures. And that would be up to 134.
     CC Roger. That's on November November, is that affirm?
     LMP That's affirm.
     CC Good. Good show.
     LMP And that was taken - the last pass , about 10 minutes ago, if you want to keep track of GET.
     CC Roger. Thanks, Jack; I'm doing that.
     CC Just for some information for Ron, in particular. We've evaluated the data from the mapping camera and the pan camera cycling there and it looks real good. Everything looks right normal.

_extra : arrow or another convex point on that front that's fitting right into the same circulation pattern.
LMP: Bob, how do you read 17?
     CC 17, read you 5 by.
     LMP That's the strangest-sounding Bob I ever heard.
     CC He's taking a short break.
     LMP Okay. Good. Nice to talk with you. Hey, I don't know whether you were around, Gene, the other day when I was talking about the circulation patterns around Antarctica. We were looking then at the Indian Ocean - actually, South Atlantic in the Indian Ocean region. And you see the same pattern at about the same latitude, say 60 degrees south, where all the linear cloud patterns which presumably are - reflect the various cold fronts have -are arcuate with their convex sides , or more actually, almost pointed sides are all lined up in a west-to-east direction around that latitude. It's quite a spectacular appearing circulation pattern. And the little wave that I mentioned on New Zealand seems to be beginning to form another
     CC Okay, copy.
     LMP That would make four of those major convex fronts that I can see from this view crossing - south of Australia up into the South Pacific.
     CC Okay.
     LMP On - on that tropical storm that was Theresa, I don't know whether they're still calling it now -that now, but I'm not sure it may be a little south of Guam. Guam may not be in trouble with that one.
     CC It looks like it's just a bit to the west of Manila there - about 5 or 6 degrees, no more than that about. It looks like it's about 5 degrees west of Manila and about 5 degrees south. And it is still called Theresa.

[00:22:39:54]

LMP: Okay, Gene, if you're still there, I don't like to argue with you but I think our analysis chart is a little more up to date.
     CC Okay.
     LMP That center - that area that you just mentioned is very clear now - east of the Philippines. Did you say west or east of the Philippines?
     CC West of the Philippines.
     LMP Okay, that a.rea that you mentioned, 5 degrees east, is very clear and the center of the - what appears ~o be the storm that I'm speaking of, would be about 142 longitude and maybe 8 degrees north latitude.
     CC Okay.
     LMP Which would put it south of Guam.
     CC Okay, yes, you're over in the area between Guam and the Carolines, then.
     LMP Say again, Gene?
     CC You're over in the area between Guam and the Carolines, then. You're saying it would be just about due west of the Carolines, then.
     CC Okay.

LMP: 12-hour-old prog, or something.
     CC Yes, that's the one I had for launch date.
     LMP Okay. Well, it's - it's - moved quite a bit now, and I guess it's the same storm; still seems to be very well organized but quite concentrated and small.
     CC Okay. I'll get a new prog in and compare your estimage there.

LMP: Okay. I think that's pretty good - those - 142 and 8 degrees would be pretty good center of that storm. I've got some pretty good coor - I can see Mindanao, and I can see the - let's see -just a second - what is that on Australia?
     0C 22 42 12 LMP Yes, of course, that is Port Moresby. I can see that point there, and between those two - I can pin that one down probably within a couple of degrees.
     CC Okay. We'll get a satellite photo and bring it in here in just a bit.

[00:22:50:23]
LMP: Houston, canister number 4 is in Bravo now.
     CC Roger. We copy that.

[00:22:56:36]
_extra : from, oh, let's say, the south coast of - or southeast coast of Vietnam up - up between and across Tai - between the Philippines and Taiwan and across Taiwan. And right along, and I can't tell I think, just off - just south of Japan. I can't tell whether Japan is in the front or not. I'll look at it some more. The strongest storm center that I can see on that is - is way north, and probably - Hokkaido is - has a fair amount of weather from that storm system. There seems to be a tropical depression just north of Borneo. A very strong circulation system north of Borneo and, I guess, just south of - of Vietnam.
LMP: Houston, 17¥
     CC Go ahead, 17.
     LMP Okay, Bob. That storm off the - just off the southwest coast of New Zealand is still intensifying and has both high and low level clouds as you can see by shadow lines. It looks like it may go into pretty - pretty fair storm system. Borneo is very clear today; and, as is the'Philippines . And as I mentioned, there's a - looks like a very strong frontal system that stretches
     CC Roger.

[00:22:59:01]
_page : 149
_tape : Tape 18/2
LMP: Probably south - probably southeast. I hadn't noticed it before, but it's extremely concentrated northern hemisphere cycl - cyclone pattern. I don't know whether that's on your prog or not. That's not what's left of Sally, is it?
     CC Stand by. Let me look at the prog over here a sec. Okay. We - it doesn't show on the old one; the new one is coming in there shortly, Jack.
     LMP Okay. If that is a developing depression, it's approaching Luzon and not very far away -2 or 3 degrees of longitude now, although Luzon is clear.
     CC Roger.

[00:23:00:02]
LMP: I can see Korea quite well, Bob. It's clear today.
     CC Yes, we - we've got the fronts. The leading edge of the front on our prog was past Korea and on Japan, and you've got it moving quite a bit further east there.
     LMP Well, I'm not absolutely sure -

[00:23:00:22]
LMP: MASTER ALARM on the accumulator.
     CC Roger. We copy.

[00:23:00:33]
_page : 150
_tape : Tape 18/3
LMP: I can't make out Japan spe - specifically yet; but it's clearly past Korea, and, by - by inspection, it looks like it would be also past Japan by now, the trailing edge of the front. However, the circulation center on farther northeast may be affecting Hokkaido, as I said.
     CC Roger. Like I said, the front on the old prog for yesterday showed that front on the other side of Japan, so it's moved across pretty well.

[00:23:01:26]
LMP: As I recall, they had a tropical storm called Sally that went into - ... a few days ago, and so I suspect this new one that seems - that I think I see between Borneo and Vietnam maybe something else; a new depression or I may be - be fooled by it.

[00:23:02:16]
LMP: Mainland China, Bob, was the last pass here. I can't see the Ear - see the Earth now, but Mainland China looked like it was clear as far as I could see. There might be another front quite a ways inland, but that gets right at the LM, and I can't tell. But Korea, Yellow Sea, and the regions of China south of there - Shanghai , Nanking and those places are - look as if they are quite clear today. I'll check that again next time around.

[00:23:02:50]
CC: Roger. And, Jack, we are ready to terminate the charge on BATTERY B and start the charge on BATTERY A.

[00:23:03:04]
LMP: Okay. That's in work.

[00:23:04:23]
LMP: Houston, for your information, system test 7A is about 0.6.
     CC Say that again, Jack. I missed that. 0.6 on system test 7A?

[00:23:04:36]
LMP: That's affirm. Battery compartment pressure.
     CC Thank you, J ack.

[00:23:05:13]
_page : 151
_tape : Tape 18/4
LMP: Okay, Bob. BATTERY A is being charged now.
     CC Roger, Jack.

[00:23:07:02]
LMP: Bob, you got any of the LMies in there today?
     CC Any of your LMies? Roger. They're all sitting by. Just gave me a big thumbs up, Jack.
     LMP Okay. Give them a thumbs up on the rendezvous radar antenna. It looks real good.
     CC Roger.
     LMP I'm nose-to-nose with it practically here at about 2 feet, and it's extremely clean. And I see absolutely no sign of any - anything abnormal with it.
     CC Roger.
     LMP Matter of fact, compared to some of the flaking problems and things like that we've heard about in the past, I never saw a cleaner piece of hardware that that LM looks right now.
     CC Roger.
     LMP Appropriately, finally we're getting - we're starting to use it during the Christmas season. It sure looks like a Christmas package with all the orange tape on it.
     CC Roger.

[00:23:08:38]
CC: Ron, we got your NOUN - NOUN 05¥

[00:23:08:42]
CMP: Okay. I'll go ahead and accept that one this time.

[00:23:09:29]
CC: We got the 9 degrees, Ron. You can torque.

[00:23:09:36]
CMP: Okay. I'll torque at 940.

[00:23:09:44]
_page : 152
_tape : Tape 18/5
CC: Okay. We got it.

[00:23:09:56]
CC: And, Jack, we've been looking at our records. We don't have a previous SYSTEMS TEST reading for 7 Alfa. Do you recall any previous readings on that one?

[00:23:10:34]
LMP: Okay. That looks like another accumulator cycle -got a MASTER ALARM.
     CC We dropped data just then, Jack, so we canԴ concur or confirm it. That's exactly the right time - -
     LMP ... all right.

[00:23:11:05]
LMP: Bob, you cut out about your SYSTEMS TEST meter discussion.
     CC Roger, Jack. Do you have any previous 7 Alfa readings? We don't have any in our log here written. We're just wondering what the past readings on that were.
     LMP No, I think that was the first one we would have been called to make after a battery charge, right?
     CC That's affirm, Jack.
     CC Go ahead, Jack. I - you're coming in very weak.
     LMP Well, I didn't intend to be transmitting. We were just discussing the battery vent and things. We may have missed something in the dump checklist. We'11 check it out.
     CC No, sir. We don't think so. We just thought may-you might have read it earlier.

[00:23:12:22]
LMP: Oh, yes, you want the battery vent - It should be closed now, right?
     CC Stand by, Jack.
     LMP Okay. Ron says it ought to be open.
     CC That - that's affirm.
     LMP ... checked the checklist.

[00:23:12:38]
_page : 153
_tape : Tape 18/6
CC: It should be open. That - there's no question about that. It should be open.

[00:23:12:41]
LMP: Okay. It's open.
     CC Really, there's no problem, Jack. It should be open, but the value appears a bit low to us, and we'd like to read it again before you go to sleep. We may want to close it. And a nominal reading would be 1.7 - -
     CC - - on that.

[00:23:13:06]
LMP: Okay. We - we closed it when we were doing all our dumping some time back and neglected to open it again. So, it was closed when I gave you the reading, and it has been closed during some 2 hours, anyway. I'll - you can figure out how long.
     CC Okay. We - we copy that.

[00:23:13:57]
CC: Jack, would you mind opening the vent and watching the system meter concurrently with it?
     LMP Stand by.

[00:23:15:11]
LMP: Well, it's - it's CLOSED now, and it's still reading what it - 0.6. Do you want us to open it again?

[00:23:15:21]
CC: Roger. Open the VENT and - -

[00:23:15:23]
LMP: I mean, it's open now. I'm - I'm sorry, Bob. It is now open and reading 0.6. It read 0.6 when it was CLOSED.
     CC Okay. Just leave it open now.
     LMP Okay.
     CC And we will want to still check it prior to your sleep period.
     LMP Okay.

[00:23:15:07]
_page : 154
_tape : Tape 18/7
LMP: Okay, Bob, a little update on the coast of Asia. It looks like some residual cloudiness would be affecting the Pusan region of Korea. And, also, that's residual after the frontal passage. And it looks like maybe Shanghai, after all, may have some storms associated with it, but it's really hard to pick out exactly - the exact coast line of Asia, but I - there are some clouds in the Yellow Sea behind the front, Look like they might be possibly some high cirrus is all.
     CC Jack, do you still see that storm that you said was sitting between Guam and - Borneo in that area?

[00:23:17:07]
LMP: Okay. I see there is this cloud concentration between New Guinea and Guam. The more I look at it the less well developed it appears to me compared to some of the other circulation patterns. It could be just a residual depression from Teresa that has moved out into that area. It is an isolated, a relatively isolated cloud pattern, fairly small, but apparently fairly dense. But has - does not have a strong cyclonic pattern to it. Nothing at all like the pattern that now exists above Borneo and seems to be moving towards Luzon.
     CC Roger. We copy.
     SC Okay.

[00:23:22:09]
CMP: Okay, Houston. We're moving in the pieces of a Presleep Checklist. Here's some more read-outs for you. BATTERY C is 37-0; PYR0 BAT A, 37.2; PYR0 BAT B, 37-2; RCS A, 95; Bravo, 91*; Charlie, 94; Delta is 96.

CC: Roger. We copy that. And if you've started it, we don't want you to reinitialize the PTC until about 2400 on the time line.
     CMP Okay. We're - we're just getting a little ahead -we - took us longer last night on the presleep than we expected. We're trying to work it out again.
     CC Yes. We don't to - we want to terminate the waste stowage vent at that time, because we think that that vent is what's contributing to our PTC coning.
     CMP Okay. We're - we're not - we're not really ready to go to sleep yet, but we're just moving ahead.
     CC Roger.
     CMP And if it's okay, I'll cycle the H^ fans.
     CC Roger. We're standing by.

[00:23:24:53]
CMP: Okay. The fans are off.
     CC Roger.

[00:23:29:06]
CC: Say, Jack, we got a request in here from our ARIA friends.
     LMP Go ahead.
     CC They were just wondering if your looking out that way, if you could give them some sort of update of what the weather in the Wake Island - Kwaj alein -the south of the Wake area looks like.
     LMP Okay. Let me work on that one.
     CC Okay. You're going to mearn - earn your American Meteorological Society badge here pretty quick.

[00:23:29:46]
LMP: Okay. Let me get the monocular, and we'll look at Wake Island. I miss having all those nice latitude and longitude lines on the globe.
     CC ... there,

[00:23:34:26]
_page : 156
_tape : Tape 18/9
LMP: Okay, Bob. I'll probably have to work on this one a little more, but - but it looks like around Wake, or in the vicinity of the Kwajaleins and north of Wake, about all you have is a lot of cloudiness although - and in a generally - over wide part of that Pacific, I'm talking about 15 or 20 degrees of longitude and latitude, there's a - roughly a clock - a clockwise circulation pattern. But the clouds do not look very dense or concentrated in any one area. And at leading off to the southeast from that general cloud mass , there're cyclonic - anticyclonic cloud mass is a - is one of the old fronts - or at least one of the old linear cloud patterns that extends down into the South Pacific.
     CC Roger, Jack. I'm sure that the ARIA troops are listening down at Patrick and caught all that.
     LMP Well, my guess is, Bob, and it's purely a guess, is that there - probably - if they were out there right now, would be experiencing an intermediate layer of clouds with scattered showers. And a not too strongly developed circulation system, so I can't predict the winds. But I wouldn't expect them to be anything - anything what might be down - associated with the remnants of the tropical depression Theresa. Now that Theresa - what's left of it, if Iԭ correct in - in picking it out there, probably is - is moving in that direction, although it looks weak enough. But right now I don't think it would be any big problem. And it may, in fact, go south of there.

[00:23:36:55]
CC: Roger. The prog I got in my hand for 3-hour-old weather has Theresa located just about in the Manila area. Did you concur with that, or do you think it passed the - the Philippines?

[00:23:37:09]
LMP: Well, I donԴ - Manila's clear. The only thing approaching near Manila is - is this other storm center that now is north of Borneo. And to the east of Manila, it's clear all the way over to this little cloud mass that I was guess might be Theresa.
     CC Roger. All I say, this is 3 hours old so - -
     LMP - - And that's about - I gave Gene Kranz some coordinates on it. You can look it up. Those were pretty good coordinates for that cloud mass. Now whether that's really Theresa or not, I don't know.

[00:23:37:45]
_page : 157
_tape : Tape 18/10
CC: We got one thing with - for the last couple of hours here, we've been getting high-bit-rate data through our new facility - a new facility at Tidbinbilla, Tidbinbilla is to a 210 dish, and they're covering the first - -
     LMP - - between Wake in the Kwajaleins , Marshall Islands, in that area, it doesnԴ look like a very concentrated weather pattern, although it looks like you'll have ceilings in that region. And they're overcast ceilings rather than broken. Except around the fringes of it.
     CC Roger.
     LMP We'll keep an eye on it of course.

[00:23:38:35]
CC: Jack, how do you read us now?
     LMP You're loud and clear.
     CC Okay, 17, for the last 2 hours, we've been getting high-bit-rate data from a new facility, the facility at Tidbinbilla and they're working their first Apollo flight ever, you might give them a cheery hellow.
     LMP Tidbinbilla, is that correct?
     CC That's affirmative. It's very close to the Honeysuckle base - -
     LMP Where is that?
     CC Very close to Honeysuckle.

CC: The computer is yours, Gene - -
     CDR Go ahead. We're reading you.
     CC You can go to attitude and reinitialize PTC when-ever you want to.

[00:23:46:19]
CDR: Okay. Did you mean to leave the computer with VERB 21 NOUN 01 up?

[00:23:46:23]

     CDR Okay; that's right. That's l4 62. Okay.
     CC 17, Houston.
     LMP Roger. Go ahead.

CC: Roger. We've got a recommended configuration for your H2 fans and H2 heaters. We would like the H2 HEATERS 1 and 2 to AUTO and H2 FANS 1 and 2, OFF; 3 to AUTO. Your 02 heaters look good.
     LMP Okay. Let me verify that I've got these right. H2 HEATERS 1, 2, AUTO. 02 HEATERS, 1 OFF; 2, OFF; 3, AUTO. H2 FANS - Hg FANS, you want OFF; OFF; and AUTO. Is that correct?
     CC That's what we want on the Hg FANS. And the 02 is fine, as you've got it.

[00:23:51:14]

[00:23:51:35]
CDR: Okay, Bob. I just cleaned the suit circuit return valve screen, here. It was probably, as expected, a little crud on it. A few things have collected, but really not too bad.
     CC Roger, Gene.

[00:23:53:30]
LMP: Bob, a little more about Wake and the Marshalls and Kwajalein. That large pattern of what appear to be broken to overcast clouds in a - a clockwise circulation pattern - crosses the equator region now that I've tried to project that through.
     CC Roger, Jack.

[00:23:57:27]
CC: 17, Houston.
     CMP 17, go ahead.

[00:23:57:36]
CC: Roger, Ron. When you stop the present roll on the PTC to reinitialize, pick a roll angle of 315 or 130 for stopping, so that we have good comm during the damping period.
     CMP Okay. 315 or 120, okay?
     CC 130, Ron.
     CMP Okay. 315 or 130.

[01:00:04:51]
CC: 17, Houston.
     CMP Go ahead.
     CC If one of you want to break out the Flight Plan Supplement, we have a change to the E-LOADS on page 143 due to the change of gyro-compensation parameters. If you want to copy them down when you get the Supplement out.

LMP: Bob? This is Jack. Your last report for the day as the Earth goes past window 5. The first thing I noticed was that our zero phase point is not nearly as bright on the west coast of Australia as it is on the - was on the east. And it's looking right at the coastline now and see no bright spot in the center. Also, that circulation pattern or tropical depression possibly that I saw earlier north of Borneo is now even more strongly developed at the tail end of the front that stretches up toward Japan. And it - it really looks like a humdinger from here. Beautiful circulation pattern and very concentrated. And it is now east of Vietnam, and again between Vietnam and - and the island of Luzon.
     CC Roger. We copy.
     LMP And I'd be very - be very curious to know tomorrow morning if you - you people are carrying that one on their progs or on their analysis chart.
     CC Roger.

[01:00:41:33]
LMP: Okay, Bob. You want me to erase something on page 1-43 and insert something else?
     CC That's affirmative, Jack. On 1-43 under column A, down at line 11 and 12 and 13. Just to make sure you're at the right spot, the line 11 0-data is 00115. Do you copy that? Do you see that?

Tomorrow, you're probably not going to be giving us our weather report, You'll be too far out, but we'll probably be starting to hear from the Moon, huh?
     IMP We're not going to see much of the Moon, you know. It's going to be pretty dark, so I'll have to keep looking at the Earth.
     CC Roger.
     LMP Pretty good - pretty interesting place. Very interesting place.
     CC I'm real sure.
     LMP And I guess - I guess, maybe, I - 100,000 miles. My goodness gracious. That's impressive.
     CC Yes, sir. You're slowing down all the way, Jack.
     LMP Well, it's sure downhill all - all the way back, isn't it?
     CC That's for sure.
     CC Jack, did the CMP get off the line, and is he sacked out now, too?
     LMP Yes, I lost both those guys. They - they decided they wanted to sleep, and I may be rumbling around here for a while but I took - we all three took Seconal, so I think we'll get to sleep before long.
     CC Roger. Just give us a call if you need anything, and we'll be watching everything there, and pleasant dreams.
     LMP Now, you don't really mean that, do you?
     CC Well, I can't come up and tuck you in so - hope you have a good sleep. You need lots of rest up there, gang.
     LMP I'll tell you, Bob, about halfway though this day, I think I acclimated. And I really feel good. IԶe been eating a lot better, and I'm not - the only thing I ever really felt was a slight headache. It really - not the fullness of the head that people described, I guess, but just a little headache. I could have been looking at the Earth too much. I don't know.
     CC Roger, Jack. You've been sounding good.
     LMP Oh, actually, I feel - I've been feeling fine. Just - none of us have felt like eating. And that's probably normal, and everybody's eating more now, and we'll start getting to sleep, I think.
     CC Roger. Jack, just a reminder on that comm for the presleep checklist. It's important to us because we can get the - we can get high-bit-rate data more.
     LMP Bob, he cut out, but I'm in the comm sleep configuration now. I'm working that way.
     CC Okay. Ed Grindell was shaking his head for a minute. Now he says as long as you're working that way.
     LMP Bob, you still cut out. Let's try it again.
     CC No - no problem, Jack, Just a reminder on the comm; that's all. We're watching you go through the checklist here.
     LMP Okay.

LMP: I'm on HIGH GAIN now, and OMNI Bravo selected.
     LMP How do you read, Bob, on the HIGH GAIN?
     CC Read you loud and clear, Jack.
     LMP Okay. And it's in REACQ and NARROW.

[01:00:49:50]
CC: Stand by. Stand by on that, Jack.
     CC Say, Jack, can we refer you to the checklist on S/1-27, a sleep configuration there, where you S-BAND SQUELCH, ENABLE, et cetera?

[01:00:50:50]
LMP: Roger. I'm ENABLED.
     LMP Oh, et cetera. Yes.
     CC Roger.
     LMP Okay. I'll get to that in a minute, Bob. Who knows, I might have something else to say.
     CC Okay. (Laught er)
     LMP Bob, I just probably ought to qualify all those remarks about the Earth's weather. It's purely novice talking about something he is very unfamiliar with, except for having a longstanding interest in it. And I think the one philosophical point, if any, that comes out of it is that somebody, probably 3-1/2 billion years ago or so, could have looked at the Earth and described patterns not too dissimilar. And it was within those patterns that life developed, and now you see, I think, and obvious to everybody, what that life has progressed to doing. And I certainly think all of us feel that it has not stopped doing that progression, and we'll probably see it do things that even you and I can't imagine them doing I certainly hope so.
     CC Roger, Jack. We concur.

[01:00:54:11]
_page : 168
_tape : Tape 19/7
LMP: Bob, you always wished that you had a poet on board one of these missions, so he could describe things that we're seeing and looking at and feeling in terms that might - might transmit at least a part of that feeling to everybody in the world. Unfortunately, that's not the case. But he certainly couldnԴ look at that fragile blue globe and not think about the ancient sails of life that are crossing its paths and wonder ahead to the - up to the present, to the modern sails of life that are represented by men that developed out of that life that are sitting there next to you and that are the country in all sorts of different guises and working towards the same end, and that is to put that life farther into the universe. I certainly hope that someday, in the not-too-distant future, the guy can fly who can express these things.
     CC Roger, Jack. You're doing a pretty good job expressing them.

[01:00:58:29]
CC: Jack, Houston.
     LMP Go ahead.
     CC Jack, we'd like to go to select OMNI Bravo, and stow the high gain the the normal stowage. It's customary we do not use the high gain for PTC going TLC.
     LMP Okay, Bob. I'm sorry, but the checklist indicated that you do all go back to OMNI Bravo.
     CC Roger. It's probably ambiguous. If you end up going up on the checklist, up to the top of 1-28, it shows you where you want OMNI Bravo.
     LMP Ambiguous is the best word I can think of for it,
     CC Say again, Jack.
     LMP Ambiguous is the best word I can think of for it.
     CC Roger. We - I concur. I should have probably called you earlier and just pointed out on the Flight Plan where it says presleep checklist. And then there's the word "coram," and it says "omni," and that leads you into the checklist and makes sure you use the OMNI setup for - for the sleep configuration.
     LMP Ho, ho, ho. Tricky fellows. I guess you're right.
     CC Yes, it's something we don't - we don't - sim PTCs, TLCs, and TECs very often. That's for sure.
     LMP Well, that's because we have a whole day to learn out here.
     CC ThatԳ affirmat ive.

     LMP We all feel pretty good this morning. Got some reports for you.
     CC Okay. Ready to copy.
     LMP Okay, on the CDR. PRD is 17025; 6-1/2 hours good sleep. One Seconal, which is the one I reported last night, so that's just one now. Had a -yesterday, midday or so - he had a nausea pill for gas. And we hadn't found the other gas pill, so he tried that one. And he drank, since I last reported, two and a half containers of water.
     CC Roger.
     LMP The CDR food intake, as with all of us, is a little bit random, and I don't know exactly the best way to report it, unless you want it all in detail.
     CC Let me check while you - Go on, and I'll see if they want a detailed description of the food or not
     LMP Okay. LMP medical. PRD 24036; 5-1/2 to 6 hours good sleep, 1 intermittent. Again, I had a Seconal but that's the same Seconal I mentioned last night. And since last report - I guess one - two and a half containers of fluid. Water.
     CC Okay.
     LMP And just for checking on the water intake, you should have me down for six containers of water.
     CC Roger. Six total.
     LMP That's affirm.
     LMP CMP medical. PRD is 15023; 7-1/2 hours very good sleep. He had the same Seconal we had. And, since last report, has three water containers for a total of six now.
     CC Roger.

     CC Roger.
     LMP Okay, The LMP: cinnamon toast bread, mixed fruit, instant breakfast, coffee, lemonade, peach ambrosia, one vitamin, one slice of bread, grapefruit drink, gingerbread, orange drink. And I have one complaint . Somebody slighted me on a caramel candy in meal C.
     CC Roger. We'll start an investigation.
     LMP Yes, it was not there. Okay. CMP: the spiced oat cereal, mixed fruit, instant breakfast, and coffee, potato soup, and peach ambrosia. That's all for breakfast. And then later on, he had chocolate pudding and a grape drink. And let's see - we all - You might log him for a vitamin pill and me for a vitamin pill.
     CC Okay.
     LMP Oh, yes, I forgot. It's here; one frankfurter, for lunch.

     CC Okay, one question G&C had. Do you do that null bias at plus 100 or minus 100 on the EMS counter?
     LMP Plus 100.
     CC Okay, and it's increased up to 101.9, right?
     LMP No, it increased to 100.9.
     CC Roger. Miscopied you; 0.9. Okay; thank you.
     LMP Yes, okay. Seems to me like last night it was 100.7.
     CC Roger.

[01:09:42:22]
LMP: Stand by, Gordy.

[01:09:45:11]
LMP: Gordy, we'll take your consumables in a second. Let me bring you up to date on the weather around the world, if you're interested.
     CC Yes, we are; go ahead.
     LMP Africa, looks in pretty good shape. There is a -except for an area probably around Zambia and Rhodesia in the tropical convergence zone there, where it looks pretty cloudy and probably quite rainy. There's a very strong circulation pattern and presumably a storm off - just off the coast of northwest Africa. Very spectacular spiral formation of clouds in a cyclone development. It looks like there are probably two fairly weak cyclones -Southern Hemisphere cyclones in the South Atlantic. One, southwest of Cape of Good Hope, and the other about due west of - of the Falkland Islands, maybe a little bit north of that. South America looks to be in quite good shape weatherwise, except possibly Uruguay and maybe northern Argentina which appear to have a - at least some fairly thick clouds there, although no strong circulation associated with this.

[01:09:48:01]
_page : 175
_tape : Tape 25/4
CC: Okay, Jack. We got all that up to Argentina, then the omni switch kind of cut you off.
     CC Jack, we got the - at least the first part of your weather report fine up through the clouds in northern Argentina, and then the switch in omnis cut you out.
     LMP Okay, that was about it, Gordy. That's - I'll talk to you some more later about it. I guess the main thing I need now is - are your consumables.
     CC Okay. By the way, you were looking back from more than halfway to the Moon. You're about 125,000 out now. On the consumables, the RCS is running at 1.3 percent over the Flight Plan line. On the C>2Z tanks 2 and 3 are right on the line, end tank 1 is about 4 percent below the line. But it's been there all the way since launch, that same bias on tank 1. On the hydrogen: tanks 1 and 3 are right on the line, tank 2 is about 3 percent above the line. All in all, you're looking real good consumablewise.
     LMP Okay. That's hardly worth writing down, I guess.
     CMP That's the way we like to see it.
     CC Same here. The only other thing I have in the way of updates is a PIPA bias update. You can load it yourself, or we can load it when we come up with the up-link prior to the bum. Your choice. And then we'11 have an update to the erasable load update and a supplement to correspond with that bias update.
     CDR Gordy, why donԴ you go ahead and load it yourself when you send up the vector?
     CC Okay, and I'll give you that update for the supplement . ItԳ on 1-43 whenever you're - whenever it's convenient.
     CDR Okay, Jack's getting that out. I ran another PIPA bias at minus 100, and it confirmed the first one. It ended up at 99-2.
     CC Roger.
     LMP Go ahead with your update on 1-43, Gordy.
     CC Okay. It's in the load A of the octal ID of 03, which now reads 77252. Change that to 77655¥
     LMP Did you copy, Gordy?
     CC I didn't copy your readback; no. Okay, 306 03 and Alfa 77655.

     LMP Okay. For the reference on - on those menus, at least for the LMP, I think I'm probably putting 8 or 9 ounces of water in the citrus drinks and those kind of things, rather than 7, which has probably upped my water intake some.
     CC Okay.

In Paris, Henry Kissinger met for 30 minutes this morning with French President George Pompidou at the Elysee Palace just hours before his scheduled conference with North Vietnamese Politburo member Le Due Tho - Tho, that is. North Vietnamese spokesmen accused Kissinger of attempting to force a peace settlement by threatening further escalation of the war. As both U.S. and North Vietnamese negotiators expressed disappointment at the continued deadlock, Chief American delegate William J. Porter traveled to Brussels to brief Secretary of State William B. Rogers. Rogers will - will return later today from the NATO Conference of Ministers. This one is datel - date - datelined Brussels. Diplomatic sources indicated today that NATO allies will request negotiations with the Soviet Union and its allies on mutual troop reductions in central Europe. Exploratory talks expected to begin about January 31, with full-scale negotiations to follow sometime next fall. In Kansas City, vital life signs for Harry S. Truman appear to have stabilized. But the 88-year-old former President remains on the critical list at Kansas City's Research Hospital. Truman is suffering from lung congestion and heart weakness. In Argentina, aides to popular Argentine politician Juan Peron said that Peron will refuse the nomination to the presidency of Argentina and will return to exile during the coming week. And, on the sports page, Rice coach A1 Conover is expected to reveal today - sometime today his decision to either remain at Rice as head coach or move to his alma mater Wake Forest in a similar position.

Most of them are drifting right along with us. Some of them are going against us and away from us. But before we did the burn -you know, the propulsion, they got out of the vent.

     CMP Okay, I don't have the other one on yet. But I was a little bit curious because I left the electrodes in this thing, and - you know, the little sponges, I left those inside the electrodes, but they stuck to - to the back of the electrodes and kind of corroded the inside of it there a little bit.

CC: Okay. We're still trying to get the answer on whether you'll have a window. Stand by. I might have it here.

[01:13:50:06]
_extra : we've started to work on and if you wanted to do is you can go to kind of Intermediate attitude, which will be the LM attitude except for roll which will be off by about 60 degrees, which will - will give you a good view of the Earth out of window 1. And then when we get ready to do the LM entry, you can roll that additional 60 degrees to get to the proper attitude, if you wish. Your choice. Over.
CC: America, Houston.
     CDR Go ahead.

_extra : developed cyclone pattern that's hanging pretty much over Buenos Aires now, I think. Uruguay and Buenos Aires. I think I mentioned that earlier in the day. And that still is there, and I suspect those folks are getting a fair amount of weather out of it.
LMP: Houston, 17. How do you read?
     CC Go ahead. You're loud and clear.
     LMP Okay, Gordy, going from south to north on noontime, at least our noontime weather, it looks like there is a fairly strong mass of polar air moving from the southwest up towards Tierra del Fuego. It's mixed with some cloudiness that extends from that area all the way down to the Antarctic ice shelf. But it looks like some pretty good movement patterns from the southwest, north - northeast. No strong weather waves or cyclone development on that yet, although one may be picking up about halfway between Tierra del Fuego and the coast of Antarctica, the - where the front, or at least the cloud masses, curve from the east-west direction to an almost due south direction. Most of South America still looks like pretty good weather. There is cloudiness along the Andean Ridge and also in the Amazon Basin, stretching from the eastern coast of South America on up about, oh, two-thirds of the way towards Central America. It doesn't look like frontal weather there. It's probably tropical convergence weather. Now there is this - still this small, moderately
     CC Roger.

[01:14:22:00]
_page : 196
_tape : Tape 28/2
LMP: Except for scattered clouds, Central America and Mexico, for the most part, are clear - as is most of the Caribbean Islands - Cuba and the others are -all look like they've pretty good weather. There's a little clouds off - cloud pattern off to the east of those islands, but it doesn't look like any major weather in that area. The eastern half and Midwest of the United States is completely cloud covered right now. There - however, the - extending from Mexico to Sonora and up into Arizona and New Mexico, and possibly as far north as Colorado, is a clear band. But then there is more cloudiness to the north of that. The Pacific regions west of - The West Coast of the United States is cloudy, at least west of Southern California. I cannot see Baja, so that cloudiness extends down south of - into Baja California. I see no strong new frontal patterns, although I'm looking right across the limb at the Earth now. There may be one that would be lying maybe across northern California and - and into Colorado, with a little clear area ahead of it, possibly in Kansas. But then into this, a solid bank of clouds that stretches from Brownsville, at least, clear up to - well, along the Gulf Coast across the panhandle of Florida, up the East Coast and on out past Nova Scotia, I'm sure. Florida is clear. Florida - the peninsular portion of Florida is - it looks very clear and some of the deep turquoise green waters to the south and southeast of that area are - are very obvious at this time.

[01:14:24:43]
CC: Roger, Jack. I'm following along on the satellite weather picture here that's taken from about your same vantage point and - although nowhere near the detail that you're describing.
     LMP Have you seen today's analysis charts of the United States or North America?
     CC No, I haven't. I was just told, Jack, that the -the weathermen and a lot of other people around here, too, are following your weather reports with great interest.
     LMP Yes. Does that mean they're right or wrong?
     CC You've got the better view, by far.
     LMP That doesn't prove much. Okay, Gordy, I'm - I suspect that that's a pretty healthy front. I don't know. Your weather must be cloudy and bad today. Is that right?
     CC It is. We've got about a half-mile vis and drizzly rain.
     LMP Okay. Well, I suspect comparable weather extends all the way across the eastern United States. That looks like awful dense clouds, although there's no obvious frontal pattern. It just stretches from the Midwest to the East Coast. And, also, there's no good indication of stratification of those clouds, as if theyԤ be fairly - fairly thick up into the cirrus levels.
     CC Roger, Jack.
     LMP Looks like Arizona, New Mexico, and northern Sonora probably have some - one band of high cirrus. But other than that, probably a beautiful day out in that area.

[01:14:27:20]
_page : 197
_tape : Tape 28/3
LMP: There's some transverse cloud patterns over the Mississippi-Alabama area. It suggests maybe that the Jetstream may be just north of that region. But otherwise, there's no good indication of Jetstream position right now.
     CC Roger.

[01:14:29:11]
_page : 198
_tape : Tape 28/4
LMP: Gordy, there is one minor weather disturbance, possibly just about over Puerto Rico or maybe just -just to the east of that island. No strong circulation' patterns, although thereԳ a hint of a cyclone development. There might be just a small depression in that area. I don't know whether your maps are carrying anything down there or not.
     CC I think I see what you're talking about on the satellite picture, but I don't have a surface analysis that goes that far. I do - I just now got a copy of the surface charts for the United States. And there's - there's a front stretching from northern Texas northeastward up through Tennessee and Virginia and another one sort of parallel to it. But, this ... southward from Louisiana along the Gulf Coast across northern Florida and on out into the Atlantic. And I guess the two are kind of blending together to make that irregular mass of clouds you mentioned.
     LMP Okay, Gordy. If I'd been a little more observant I could see that there was a little bit, looks like a decrease in at least the thickness of the clouds, vertical thickness, between the two areas you just mentioned. So, there is some indication here of those two fronts, although they are contributing to a general weather pattern in the eastern United States.
     CC Roger.

[01:14:31:06]
LMP: I think, with a little experience in this business, you might have picked those two out of that mass. But it's not immediately obvious.
     CC Roger.
     LMP You got anything on there coming in from the northwest now, say up in Wyoming and Colorado?
     CC The way it's drawn on this surface charts shows that - that northern front that I mentioned, just now, sort of curving on up through central Colorado, and then bending westward toward - through Utah. That's about the only other frontal activity. There's one, probably dry front, then a short one through central Arizona and southern Utah.
     LMP Okay. Well, that makes sense. That would match with that - what I was thinking was high cirrus in Arizona. And also I can see how you could bend - that's the northern front up through Colorado and then back westward to explain the patterns we're seeing in the clear areas south of that.
     CC Roger.

LMP: Gordy, the zero-phase point now is off the coast of Chile and Ecuador - oh, maybe 10 or 15 degrees of longitude, and it is fairly dull. It does not seem to indicate any great amount of choppiness or wave action in that area.
     CC Roger.
     LMP And about 15 minutes ago, Gordy, I took two more Hasselblad shots of the Earth.
     CC Okay.
     CMP And, also, Houston, frame number - let's see, that's 16 and 17 - were taken of the Earth about 15 minutes ago, too. And that's magazine Sierra Sierra.
     LMP Okay, Ron. We copy that.

[01:14:34:55]
_extra : and - but it does not seem to be closely associated with the frontal activity that I mentioned when I started out speaking at this - this particular time,
LMP: Gordy, with respect to the icepack off the coast of Antarctica, it's difficult to distinguish pack ice from clouds, in general. However, the clouds seem to pick up reflection patterns with respect to the Sun. And using that as a - and some shadows in below as the criteria, it looks as if the pack ice in the South Atlantic would extend to a latitude almost comparable to that of Tierra del Fuego. I don't know whether that - that's reasonable or not.
     CC Okay. I don't either. But maybe someone who's more of an expert can clear up your question on that. I111 let you know.
     LMP Now to the southwest of Tierra del Fuego there's a - looks like a small cyclone developing, clockwise rotation, just off the edge of the pack ice,
     CC Roger,

[01:14:36:36]
_page : 200
_tape : Tape 28/6
LMP: There is another - there is another one, maybe a front, a little bit ahead of that cyclone that's now extending north-south. Starts in the pack ice area and extends up - oh, about halfway from there to Buenos Aires - in the direction of Buenos Aires. It doesn't look like a very major mass of air or frontal system. It may develop into something over the next couple days though.
     CC Okay.

[01:14:38:08]
LMP: And centered, Gordy, at about 45 south and say 30 west, there is another cyclone area that's ahead of the last front I talked about that doesn't look - I think I talked about it yesterday - still does not look too strong, although the clouds, as I recall, the cloud cover is somewhat more well developed, and circulation patterns seem to be better developed. It may be an intensifying storm over what we saw yesterday.
     CC Roger.
     LMP I cannot see that it's associated with any clear frontal activity, however.
     CC Okay.
     LMP That, I presume, should be migrating in the direction of the - of the southeast coast of Africa, so we'll keep an eye on it.
     CC Roger.
     LMP And that reminds me, did you get any information cn the - that - what looked like a very strong, concentrated typhoon or hurricane in the South Pacific between Borneo and the Philippines?
     CC Let me check and see what we got on that. I wasn't here when you first talked about it evidently.
     LMP Well, it was one that they didn't seem to be carrying, and it looked extremely well developed from here.

[01:14:40:34]
_page : 201
_tape : Tape 28/7
LMP: Gordy, yesterday that - the one I'm speaking of -was centered at about 15 north and a hundred and -make that about 117 east.
     CC Okay. I've been informed that they are - the satellite people are carrying that one now. I'm not sure whether they had seen it before or didn't see it until after you did. But they are aware of it now and are tracking it.
     LMP Well, we're not competing. They just didn't have any information for me on it yesterday. We'll probably be able to see that again late this afternoon.
     CC Okay. The one that you just gave the coordinates on is - does have a name, - that's Therese, Hurricane Therese. And - so the - the other one must be the - must not have the name.
     LMP Okay. Now which one has - is Therese.
     CC The one you just - the coordinates you gave almost exactly pinpoint Therese.
     LMP Okay. That's near the Philippines.
     CC That's affirmative. Between there and Vietnam,

[01:14:42:38]
LMP: Okay. Well, then that sounds like - if that's an up-to-date position, it has relatively little movement since yesterday.
     CC Roger. They show it moving just very slightly westward.
     LMP Okay. Are they carrying anything south of Guam now that we talked about yesterday?
     CC Take a minute to get something on that. They don't have a current map showing anything in Guam right now.
     LMP And we also had a storm developing south of - or southwest of New Zealand. Might look at that one, too.
     CC Okay.
     CC Jack, are you making these observations through the monocular?
     LMP Yes, sir.
     CC Okay.
     LMP Although most of them - well, at this distance, Gordy, the circulation - detailed circulation patterns to say what's a cyclone and what isn't are not visible to the naked eye, at least not to mine.
     CC Roger.
     LMP The major frontal patterns are, however.

[01:14:46:49]
_page : 202
_tape : Tape 28/8
CC: Jack, that disturbance you mentioned near Guam isn't being carried on the current charts here as anything significant. They do show some cloudiness north of the tropical convergence zone, but just that.
     LMP Okay. Well, I had a feeling what I was seeing yesterday might have just been the remnants of Teresa [sic], which I think went - got into that area a couple days ago. It was not a very well-developed system, but did seem - seem to be isolated from the other cloudiness that I would have put into the tropical convergence zone. That was between Wake and Kwajalein.
     CC Roger.

[01:14:49:03]
_page : 203
_tape : Tape 28/9
LMP: Gordy, let me try to give you a description of something that is a little bit unusual than what we've been seeing. The - there's an axis that runs from, say, the outer portion of the Ross ice shelf along the - and just off the coast of Antarctica, then bends up so that it would pass just to the east of Tierra del Fuego and - and then continues on that heading so that it would intersect the far east coast of South America, if it continued. Now along that axis, the - what appear to be multiple frontal patterns or at least linear cloud bands, bend very sharply and change from a heading that roughly parallels the axis around the one that is roughly north-south. And some of the front - frontal direction changes that I gave you earlier, down in that area, are - also bend around that axis.
     CC Okay.
     LMP And there just, oh, there are probably a dozen, if you tried to pull them out, cloud bands between the Ross Sea and Tierra del Fuego that bend around the same axis. Quite striking.
     CC Roger.

[01:14:51:06]
LMP: Now there's some indications, to me at any rate, that the Jetstream in that area may be essentially east-west - oh, maybe 20 degrees of latitude north of the Ross Sea, and then bends down very sharply so that it intersects the - or approaches the coa -Antarctic ice shelf to the east of the Ross Sea, and then maybe it bends up and forms the axis that I just described that's causing that bending of the cloud patterns.
     CC Okay. Sounds like a good, theory.

[01:14:52:08]
LMP: There's a linear clear area in that area north of the Ross Sea that - and to the north of that is a sharply defined front that I talked about earlier. And then, both the - that front continues. The clear area is cut off by the axis that I described, a cloud axis.
     CC Roger.
     LMP Now that should show up real well on the 250-millimeter pictures we took. Gordy, I'm back looking at zero-phase. And now, apparently, the exact zero-phase was partially obscured by a cloud pattern earlier. Now, when I - There is a very, very small bright spot in the center of the zero-phase area. Nothing comparable to what I described off the coast of Australia yesterday, but an extremely small spot. I suspect that the size of your bright spot in zero-phase has some direct -or indirect, at any rate, relationship to sea state.
     CC Roger.

[01:14:55:49]

_tape : Tape 28/10
LMP: Gordy, as you might expect, the whole coastline of Chile is - or all of Chile, practically, is clear. Beautifully exposed to us here, particular the Atacama Desert, which is noted for that particular characteristic, and - at least among geologists it is. And the coast of Peru is also clear with clouds following the Andean Ridge, probably the - certainly the coast side of the Andean Ridge. Lima ought to be enjoying a very nice day today. The - Ecuador, however, looks like it might have a little more cloudy weather, although it doesnԴ look like any major storm activity.
     CC Roger.

[01:15:03:12]
CC: America, Houston. We have a couple of words here on medications. Is everyone listening?
     CDR Yes; we're on, Gordo. Go ahead.
     CC Okay. Geno, you mentioned taking a nausea pill for some gas yesterday, and we were looking into some of the side effects. You definitely don't want to use that particular pill for gas. One of the side effects is that it's an appetite depressor. And there are some pills loaded in A-7, along with the vitamin pills, specifically for the purpose of eliminating gas. We would appreciate if you'd give us a call in advance prior to taking any medications except the Seconal and aspirin. Over.
     CDR Okay, Gordy, will do. I was aware that those gas depressors were around. At the time, we couldn't find them in A-7- And so I took one of those other things, whatever it is. And while you're talking about that, as per the preflight food check, gas is very evident on - particularly on me - and I think I'm suppressing it slowly. But is there any problem, or what do you recommend on that Mylinol [sic] or Mylicon or whatever it is?
     CC Okay. Stand by 1.
     CDR This goes hand-in-hand with the amount of gas that I experienced preflight.
     CC Okay.
     CDR And it's the kind of gas - it's the kind of gas that just stays in your stomach.
     CC Roger.

[01:15:05:43]
_page : 205
_tape : Tape 28/11
CC: Okay, Geneo. The recommended use of those gas pills is to chew one after each meal. And then, if needed, chew up another one before going to sleep at night.
     CDR Okay; fine. I chewed one after breakfast.
     CC Okay. A little water after you chew it up, I guess, helps its effectiveness.
     CDR That's a basic requirement, I believe. The effect of it has not been too obvious yet though.
     CC Roger.

[01:15:07:51]
CDR: Gordy, you want the 02 HEATERS 1 and 2 to AUTO now?
     CC That's affirmative.

[01:15:08:06]
CDR: Okay, They're there.

[01:15:09:05]
CDR: Gordy?
     CC Go ahead.
     CDR I don't want to cause any concern on that gas. It's no real great problem. It's just a slight discomfort; that's all.
     CC Okay, Gene. I think we understand.

CDR: Gordy, I have just eaten my first peanut butter sandwich in orbit around the Earth.
     CC Roger. How was it?
     CDR What's that? Well, it was just as good as it was when I was growing up - which means it was great. I grew up on those things, as I recall.
     CC Charlie Duke's here with me and he - -
     CMP Miss the lettuce. Sure have missed the lettuce and mayonnaise on mine though.

CMP: CSM/LM pressure equalization, huh? Okay. CRYO PRESSURE INDICATOR to SURGE/3 and verify the cryo. Wait a minute. See if I got the right one here. DIRECT 02 is ON.
     CDR Okay, Gordo, I cycled the CRYO PRESSURE INDICATOR from up to down, back to SURGE/3. And we got a MASTER ALARM and there was no 0 HIGH FLOW with it at all.
     CC Okay.

[01:15:36:32]
CDR: Okay, I just did it again to verify it. And that picked up - it picked up the MASTER ALARM, although it might be associated with the fact that the surge tank is down and coming back up.
     CMP No, I don't think so.
     CC Roger, Gene. Although, the surge tank shouldn't have caused it.
     CDR Okay, let me give you one more try on it. Well, that time it didn't ... it. All I did was go up to 1 slash 2 and the ALARM came on.
     CC Roger.
     CDR Okay, I went back to surge/3; it did not. So maybe it's coming on when I go up to 1 slash 2.
     CC Roger,
     CDR Yes, there it is, Gordy. It's definitely repeat-able. I can go up to PRESSURE CRYO QUANTITY 1 slash 2 and the ALARM comes on.
     CC Okay, Geno; understand.
     CDR You might note that - hey -
     CMP Okay.
     CDR Gordo, you might think about the fact that we were getting them when the cabin pressure was high after launch. And there might be some association there, also.
     CC Okay, a good observation.

CMP: Okay. There's the DELTA-P of 2. We'll close the equalization valve. Yes, we'll monitor for 3 minutes now.

[01:15:44:01]
CC: Geno, Houston. We just wanted to verify that no -none of the lights in the matrix were - flashed when you operated that switch and got the MASTER ALARM.
     CDR That's affirmative, Gordo; none of the lights flashed at all.

     CMP Well, it's kind of the conclusion I came to when I didn't find it in the system data - Hey, I got a little bit to tell you about that. Oh, those little ones underneath the power bungee.
     CC Okay, go ahead.
     CMP Okay, if you look at the docking lights, number 4 up beside of that - Oh, kind of a ... looking thing. There is a snowman. In other words, a great big fat thing with a head on top of it. And if you consider the fat thing with the head on it as a snowman, well then, the snowman's head is pointing out a 09:00 on that one. Whereas one that's fully cocked and latched over there, the snowman's head points up at about 11:00. And -Okay, there is a lever that comes right out of the bottom of the power bungee, it looks like, and then it comes out of the bottom then left out of that lever, is another silver slot or silver bar that goes from the lever to the J-hook with the snowman on it. That particular thing that connects the J-hook to the lever coming out of the bottom of the bungee is visible. In other words, it's not sticking back underneath the J-hook. It's visible.
     CC Ron, we've got just a line drawing here and we've still haven't got with you on what's what according to the drawing. Maybe you can hold off until we get a model of the latch, then we can stay with your description.

     LMP Okay. I took it V to 2, so it's the same kind of thing, I guess.
     LMP Okay, Houston. How do you read Challenger? Counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5- Over.

CC: Challenger, this is Houston. You're loud and clear, although we have a lot of background noise. Not sure whether that's getting through. Do you know if Ron is still on VOX?
     SC Hello, Houston; America. How do you read?
     CC America, this is Houston. Over.
     SC Okay. Stand by, and Challenger is going to give you a call on S-band, and VHF checks are both GO on A and B.
     CC I think I side marked on Challenger. We are getting some data. We'll stand by for another check.

[01:17:19:21]
CMP: Do you acknowledge that?
     LMP I heard him the first time.
     CDR Okay. ... me get S-band in

[01:17:19:29]
LMP: Okay, Houston; this is Challenger. Counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5¥ How do you read?
     CC Challenger, Houston. YouԲe loud and clear, with the background noise.
     LMP They don't have a good up-link, Gene. I - I had signal strength. And now I don't have any at all.
     CDR Okay. Houston, Challenger.
     LMP There it is. Now I do; 2.2.
     CDR Okay.
     LMP Tell them I heard their transmission to you.
     LMP No, a few minutes ago.

[01:17:20:34]
_page : 219
_tape : Tape 30/3
LMP: I was at zero signal strength, and I heard their transmission ... One of them. The first time they acknowledged that your - that I was going to do it.
     LMP Did you shift my hose back? Oh,

[01:17:21:13]
CC: Hello, Challenger; this is Houston. Do you read me?
     LMP Okay, Houston. I read you. You're weak but clear. Signal strength is fluctuating. When you called me, it fluctuated down to about 1.6. Over. And it's 2 now.
     CC Okay, Jack. You're loud and clear. The background noise I've been mentioning, although I guess you haven't heard me mention it until now, is what we expect in DOWN VOICE BACKUP and LOW BIT RATE. How have you read this transmission all the way through? Over.
     LMP Did he say "say again?" Gene? Gene, did he say "say again?"
     LMP I got a little bit. Oh, he's got 3. - -
     SC . . .
     LMP What? Okay, Houston. I've got 3-4 on the signal strength, and try me again.

[01:17:22:18]
CC: Okay, Challenger. You're coming in loud and clear. How do you read me?
     LMP Okay, Houston. I know you tried to transmit. I could just barely tell that. I could see the signal strength vary down to 3. You were modulating, aparently, but you're not getting through to me.
     CC Okay, Challenger. I'm transmitting simul now in both S-band frequencies, and it sounds to us like for some reason when I transmit, the up-link signal starts to break up. It's just the way you see it. Over.

[01:17:22:59]
_page : 220
_tape : Tape 30/4
LMP: Okay, Gordy. You're breaking up there. Still modulating, but I cannot read you. Would you -would you tell America what you said?
     CDR Yes, Gordy, we read you in America loud and clear on that simul.

[01:17:23:15]
CC: Okay, Geno.
     LMP Is he talking, Gene?
     LMP As soon as he starts trying to talk, the signal strength drops off about 0.4. Now, I have had -I heard him loud and clear one time when he called you guys.

[01:17:24:31]
CC: America and Challenger, we're going to hand over to a different site and try that here in about 30 seconds.
     CMP What else do we have to do, get some of these mags stowed?

[01:17:25:01]
CMP: We've got to stow the mags. Here, put the PPK where it belongs.

[01:17:27:40]
CC: Hello, Challenger; this is Houston through Bermuda. How do you copy?
     CC Challenger, this is Houston. How do you read me?
     CC Back in Houston?
     SC Right, Gordo.
     CC Okay, Jack. I think he answered us, but he was completely lost in the noise. I could just barely hear somebody talking. Could he hear us okay?
     sc No. If he did hear you, he didn't answer.
     CC Okay. It was my imagination then.

[01:17:29:00]

     CC Can you tell Jack - ask him to verify he's on AFT OMNI?
     SC Okay. I'll have him verify he's - That's affirm. He's verified.
     CC Okay.
     SC ... earlier when he was .,. that he
     CC Roger.
     CC But on this last set of checks, we didn't hear anything ...
     SC Apparently not.
     CC Okay.
     SC There was one time earlier when he had zero signal strength where he said he could hear you transmitting to us very weak but clear.
     CC Okay.

[01:17:34:04]
CC: Hello, Challenger. Hello, Challenger; this is Houston. How do you read?
     LMP Okay. You're loud - well, you're about 3 by, Gordy, but very clear.

[01:17:34:16]
CC: Okay, Jack. We can hear about 1 by 1 in the midst of a lot of noise, but we could tell you're sounding much better.

[01:17:36:33]

[01:17:37:48]
CC: Challenger, Houston. How do you read?

[01:17:37:57]
LMP: You're 1.8, 1.8. Yes. Never heard him.

[01:17:38:41]
CC: Hello, Challenger; Houston. How do you read?

[01:17:39:52]
LMP: Gordy received me, didn't he? Well, he started to say something; then he dropped off.

[01:17:41:13]
LMP: Now he's up. Haven't heard him.
     CC Roger, Houston.
     CC Okay. We're going to go back to Goldstone, both up and down, and we'd like Jack to do step 4o6 on the checklist; in other words, go to VOICE. S-BAND VOICE to VOICE, the BIOMED to RIGHT. And we're going to give it a try in the normal configuration. Over.
     SC A 174 and 76, gentlemen. BIOMED, RIGHT; and S-BAND VOICE to VOICE.
     CC That's affirmative.
     CC Roger.
     LMP Houston, do you read Challenger?

[01:17:42:08]
CC: Roger, Challenger. Read you weak but clear. How do you read?
     LMP Okay, Houston, You just came in loud and clear. How do you read?
     CC Okay. And that time, you're loud and clear, Jack and sounds read good.

[01:17:42:26]
_page : 223
_tape : Tape 30/7
LMP: Okay, Gordy. Let me say once again, way back when we first started and Gene was talking to you, I heard one of your answers, weak but clear, with zero signal strength showing here. Now, that might have been through Ron's VOX, I don't know. Since then, you've been able to modulate the signal strength, with occasional weak words. And - and then, when that signal strength was up around 3.2, where it is now, then you came in loud and clear with a broadcast. I answered you, you said about three words, then dropped off completely. And then we - we changed configuration.

[01:17:43:09]
CC: Okay, Jack. That correlates with what we've seen here in the way of signal strengths dropping in and out. Stand by, and I'll see where we want to go from here.

[01:17:44:25]
CC: Challenger, Houston. We'd like you to do step 7-We'll check out the telemetry and have that ready.
     LMP Okay; step 7-
     CC And, Challenger; Houston. Making a voice check. How do you copy?
     LMP Roger. You're loud and clear. How me?

[01:17:44:54]
CC: You're loud and clear.

[01:17:45:57]
CC: Challenger, Houston. We're looking at the HIGH BIT RATE for a minute here while we're waiting. Would you check the CROSS TIE circuit breakers , panel lo? Verify they're open.

[01:17:46:09]
LMP: That's verified. CROSS TIEs BUS and BAL LOADS open.

[01:17:46:14]
CC: Roger.
     C1 17 46 56 CC Challenger, Houston. We'd like you to accomplish step number 8.

[01:17:47:09]
LMP: Roger. Step 8.

[01:17:47:28]
LMP: Okay, Houston. How do you read the Challenger? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Over.
     CC Challenger, you're loud and clear. How me?
     LMP Loud and clear.

[01:17:49:16]
LMP: Wilco. Stand by.

[01:17:50:07]
LMP: Okay, Houston. ED BATs A and B are 37-2.
     CC Roger. Okay. And go ahead with step 10, and then we'll go back and try to find out what's wrong with DOWN VOICE BACKUP.
     LMP Gordo, say again, please.
     CC Go ahead and check the sequence camera, if you haven't already, Jack, and then we'll have some steps for you to check out what was wrong with D0WNV0ICE BACKUP.

[01:17:51:00]
LMP: All righty. Stand by.

[01:17:51:19]
LMP: Sequence camera - sequence camera is GO.
     CC Okay.
     LMP And I'm ready for your step.

[01:17:51:30]
CC: Stand by 1.

[01:17:53:41]
CC: Challenger, Houston. We'd like the RANGING switch to OFF/RESET, and the VOICE switch to DOWNVOICE BACKUP, then give us a call. Over.
     LMP Okay. OFF/RESET on RANGE, and DOWNVOICE BACKUP on VOICE.
     CC That's affirmative.

[01:17:54:05]
LMP: Okay, Gordy. On DOWNVOICE BACKUP, how do you read? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
     CC Okay, Jack. You're readable. You're - okay, Challenger. We read your transmission, but you're just about - just about lost in the noise. Give us another count, please.

[01:17:54:34]
_page : 225
_tape : Tape 30/9
LMP: Okay, Houston; this is the Challenger. You were loud and clear, loud and clear. No different from the transmissions in VOICE, and counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5¥ How do you read? Over.
     CC Okay, Jack. It got a lot better. You're - you're perfectly readable now. Sounding good.

[01:17:54:57]
LMP: That sounds good.

[01:17:55:13]
CC: Okay, Jack. Would you go to HIGH BIT RATE?

[01:17:55:17]
LMP: Roger. Challenger's HIGH BIT RATE. How do you read HIGH BIT RATE?
     CC Okay. Still the same. Loud and clear.

[01:17:55:40]
CC: Okay. We'd like BIOMED, OFF now, Jack.

[01:17:55:49]
LMP: Roger. Going BIOMED, OFF. Okay, Houston. How do you read the LM? DOWNVOICE BACKUP; BIOMED, OFF; PCM, HI. Over.

[01:17:55:58]
CC: Okay, Jack. You're loud and clear.

[01:17:56:04]
LMP: Okay, Gordy. And that was hot mike, so that's working fine up here. And you're loud and clear, also.

[01:17:56:16]
CC: Okay, Jack. Let's try PCM, L0, now.

[01:17:56:23]
LMP: Okay. Talking to you DOWNVOICE BACKUP; BIOMED, OFF; and PCM, L0. How do you read? Over.
     CC Okay. Same old loud and dear.
     LMP Okay, Gordy. Certainly is clear up here. You're coming through 5 by at signal strength 3-2, and -all appearances up here, that previous problem was an up-link. But I guess you were not reading me. Is that correct?
     CC Well, I was - The answer is yes and no at various times. We think, though, we have a good handle on the problem.
     LMP Okay; very good.
     LMP Are you ready for us to press on here, Gordy? We're all stowed and - in pretty good shape in the LM.

[01:17:57:29]
_page : 226
_tape : Tape 30/10
CC: Okay. We'd like you to check one more switch first before moving on. Check the UPDATA LINK switch to OFF.

[01:17:57:40]
LMP: Okay, That is verified OFF.

[01:17:57:43]
CC: Roger.

[01:17:58:01]
CC: Want you to stand by a minute or 2, Jack, until we verify a funny-looking parameter here on that up-link switch.

[01:17:58:17]
LMP: Standing by. What's that? No, they want - they got something looking funny on the up-link -they're - I guess on the up-link switch.
     CC Challenger, Houston.
     LMP They want to look at it.
     CC That was a bad call. We were reading the data wrong. You're clear to press on with the checklist now on page 1-20.

[01:17:58:50]
LMP: Okay. We'll press on. Geno, here is your jettison bag. You can get back to Ron.

[01:17:59:08]

     SC Gordo, we're about wrapped up here in Challenger. It looks like there's some life in the old bird, huh?
     CC Roger.
     CDR Okay. We'll give you a call when we get the hatch closed. Ron's doing some housekeeping in the command module, and we're going to take it slow getting back in.
     CC Okay, Gene.
     CMP Okay, Houston. The drogues are going in.

[01:18:21:40]
CC: Roger, Ron. Got a couple of questions on those -that latch number 4, if you can answer them for me.

[01:18:22:00]
CC: America, Houston.

[01:18:22:43]
CC: America, Houston. We're back with you after some site changeover. How do you read?
     CMP Okay; loud and clear. How me, Bob?
     CC Real good, Ron. On that number 4, latch number 4, is the hook back away from the ring about 1 inch as opposed to resting against the ring? Do you have about an inch clearance on that hook right now?
     CMP Well, there's about 1/2 inch.
     CC Okay. Understand about 1/2 inch. In what position was the latch handle when the hook was first moved back, Ron? We it kind of like in a normal stroke-back, or was it just flopping back?
     CMP No, when I first looked at it, the latch handle was - see, the hook itself was over the ring when I first looked at it.
     CC Roger. We understand that.
     CMP The hook was over the ring, and the - and the latch handle was flush, you know. It looks just like a normal - hooked docking latch, you know.
     CC Roger. Understand.
     CDR And, Bob, this is Gene. I can confirm that it did not fold back easily, because I - I checked it yesterday. I didn't check - I checked to see that the hooks were over as well as where the handles would fold back, but I obviously didn't check to see whether that one was seated. But the handle was locked.
     CMP That's right.
     CC Roger. Understand. And the first thing you saw was the depression in the Bungee. Is that - is that affirm?
     CMP Yes, that's affirm. And the bungee is depressed about 3/8 - 3/8 to a 1/2 inch.
     CC Roger.
     CMP You can push the - you can push the hook about an inch away from the ring, but the normal - just a resting position on the thing is about a finger's width or 1/2 inch from the ring.
     CC Roger. In other words, the loose - The hook is loose so it flops a little bit; you can move it back and forth. Is that affirm?
     CMP Yes. I can move it from about 1/2 inch to an inch from the edge of the ring - clearing the edge of the docking ring.
     CC Roger. Ron, when you pulled the hook - when you pulled the handle back, did you reach and pull the hook back with it, or did it come back with the handle like a normal pullback then?
     CMP No, the - the hook did not come back with the handle. The hook did not come back with the handle. Although, when I - when I pulled the handle back to - you know, which is - which is kind of a normally uncocked position - and then it wouldn't go any further, you know. It wouldn't go an further. And then the latch itself - or the hook - the J-hook; I'll call it the hook. I moved it off the docking ring back to this position that was about an inch or 1/2 inch from the docking ring. And it stays right there now. And I can't push it back up into the docking ring at all. Can't push the hook back up to the docking ring at all.

     CC Okay, Ron. Our plan here is to leave it like it is. And we're going to think about it tonight, and we'd like you to just keep pressing on. Just leave it alone, okay?

[02:18:26:56]
CMP: Okay. Sounds good. It'll clear the docking ring; no problem.

[01:18:29:17]
CDR: Bob, are you all going to want OMNI or HIGH GAIN on this?

[01:18:29:24]
CC: Stand by on that.
     CC We're all locked on the HIGH GAIN. We'd just like you to leave it on HIGH GAIN. The angles you see in the Flight Plan are in case it breaks lock. That's what you need for - with this attitude.

     CC Okay, Ron. We got that.

[01:19:02:24]
CMP: Okay, Houston. We've started on the heat select radial and lineal part - part of it. The little pie-shaped things are changing color as we go out. The lineal part of it - all of the chips seemed to have been concentrated on the front edge of the glass, and they're all pretty much in the linear direction or in XX-direction. At this point in time, I haven't seen any movement yet.
     CC Roger, Ron. Aren't they on ... heads the same way they were on the backup unit the other evening in the White Room - on the lamp?
     CMP Yes, all those chips seem to be - well - in an XX-I got the lineal direction, the lineal part of the experiment in the XX-direction. And all the chips are lined up in that XX-direction on the front or the top of the glass.
     CC Roger. That's just the way ou were in the backup unit the other day in the White Room.
     CMP Yes, that's right.

[01:19:11:36]
CMP: Okay, Houston. We've started the cooldown in LIGHT 5 position there. The radial cells, they all started to change color except the one from about 10 o'clock to 12 o'clock.
     CC Roger. Except from 10 to 12. We've got It. Did the lineal ... stay right in line there, Ron?
     CMP Yes, the crystals or chips that are inside there didn't move at all. Yes, they're ... - -
     CC Roger.
     CMP On the color patterns behind there - the one on the left, as you look at the unit - the color crystals only changed down to about 0-9 of the first square as you come down from the top. The rest of them are all black on that partic - on the left row.

[01:19:12:59]
CMP: You might check and see if the guys want to heat it a little bit longer the next time, when they do it in the PTC.
     CC Yes. Roger, Ron. We're copying everything you're saying, and we've got all kinds of support here; we - in fact, we've got one backup unit here watching what you're doing, so we'll keep you posted on what we think.
     CMP Oh, okay. Is the backup CMP operating it?
     CC Matter of fact, that's affirm.
     CMP That's the way to do things.
     CC And, Ron, we'd like you to stay nominal on the heating time due to the film limitation.
     CMP Okay; will do.

[01:19:15:09]
CMP: Okay, Houston; 17 here. Is there enough film in there to allow me to keep the camera running while I try to fill up that flow pattern.
     CC Stand by on that, Ron.
     CC It's affirmative, Ron. You can leave it running.
     CMP Okay.

[01:19:16:51]
_page : 233
_tape : Tape 31/3
CMP: Okay, Houston. The first thing I noticed, as soon as I opened the FLOW four turns, it started running out a little bit, even - even without doing the inject. Okay; that's because the INJECT thing was open just a little bit, but It's all right.
     CC Roger. We copy.

[01:19:17:22]

     CC Okay.
     CMP With the fluid inject thing.
     01. 19 18 11 CMP Okay; I'm taking it in quite slow. It's noted there are quite a few small bubbles coming out with it. So far, so good. It hasn't overflowed the - the first capillary ring. And it's taken off, and it's going by capillary action toward the bottom and toward the top.
     CC Roger, Ron.

[01:19:19:26]
CMP: Okay; it finally met together at - that part going around the top and around the bottom - met together 180 degrees opposite of the inject port and now is starting to go out across the middle and fill up from the inject port.
     CC Roger.

[01:19:20:58]
CMP: We're getting a lot of big bubbles coming out now. That's after about a turn and a half.
     CC Roger. We copy.

_extra : of an inch - fourth of an inch circumference coming around from the left side opposite the injection port.
CMP: Okay; that's two turns now. the meniscus is still holding on the first inner ring - it looks like all the way around, at least as far as I can see. The bubbles - big bubbles that have been coming out now, and also the fluid have taken over the right half of the bottom of the dish. We're starting to fill in a little bit, maybe a fourth
     CC Roger.

CMP: Okay; I'll keep going here. We're about two and
     CC Roger.

[01:19:22:55]
CMP: Okay; that's three turns. I don't believe we're going to be able to cover the entire bottom with the four turns.

[01:19:23:27]
CMP: Okay. That's four turns, and - it's covered up the right - oh, three-fourths of the floor of the thing and about three-eights of an inch on the left side of the - of the floor - three-eights of an inch annulus all the way around, except for the right - oh, say right two-thirds of the floor.
     CC Roger, Ron. You can use more than four turns if you need it.

[01:19:24:02]
CMP: Okay; let's go ahead and try to cover up the whole floor on the thing before we do it. The bubbles are in there, and I'm afraid they're going to stay un - unless they disappear when we heat it.
     CC Roger.

[01:19:24:35]
_extra : spreading of its own accord now, and it should go on over and cover up the bottom, I think. Once it completely covers up the bottom, I think we should go ahead and start the heat HIGH on this pattern.
CMP: There now it's - it's coming out with no bubbles now, and it looks like it almost formed a meniscus on top of itself - on top of where the bubbles were.
     CC Roger, Ron. Is it continuing to spread out?
     CMP Yes, it's continuing to spread out now, and without pumping anything into it at all - I did that last turn fairly fast - and it seems to be

CMP: Okay. Now the - Everything's all hooked together now. We completely filled up the bottom of the floor.

[01:19:26:15]
CMP: Hey, for some reason, the bubbles seem to be starting to break now.
     CC Roger. We copy that, Ron.

[01:19:26:53]
CMP: Okay. I don't know if it's coincidence or what, but all the bubbles are formed together, essentially in the center - in more or less at least -I mean - yes, along the plus-X-axis direction. And they're about 1 inch wide. And then they start about three-quarters - I mean three-eights of an inch in from the circumference.
     CC Roger.

[01:19:27:58]
CMP: Okay; I was going to try to break the bubbles with a pencil, but if you try to push a pencil into the bubble, it just moves aside.

[01:19:28:23]
CMP: So that being the case, I'm going to go ahead and start the - start the timer.
     CC We concur on that, Ron.
     LMP That's called the old push-a-bubble-with-a-pencil trick.
     CC Roger. Just need a sharper pencil, Jack.
     LMP Either that or a thinner bubble.

[01:19:29:18]
LMP: This is the best Friday afternoon matinee I've ever been to.
     CC How about Friday evening, Jack?
     LMP Well, I've lost track. I don't think - I don't think there's any ... -
     CMP Stand by.

CMP: MARK. That was 1 minute after the start.
     CC Roger.
     CMP I'll give you another mark when I go to HIGH on the - with the SELECT switch.

[01:19:30:38]
CMP: MARK it.
     CC Roger.

[01:19:31:36]
CMP: Each bubble looks like it's locus of - it looks like it's starting one of the Be mu - Bernudi cells.
     CC Say that again, Ron?
     CMP Okay; each one of those bubbles looks like it1c the locus - or the start of one of the Benard cells.
     CC Roger.
     CMP So far, the bubbles aren't breaking.
     CC We copy that.
     LMP Is Stu getting - did Stu get bubbles on his pattern, Bob?
     CC We're not running it down here. We're just demonstrating on the demonstrator there, but Stu can tell you.
     LMP Oh, I thought you were running - -
     CC Roger, Jack. Yes, I - you're talking of the one that - that we did, right?
     LMP That's right. Well, I am now. I thought you were running it down there also.
     CC No. Okay. The one that we did in flight - Yes, I had - I had a lot of bubbles, but I couldn't get mine - Krytox out across the center. So, you all are already well ahead of what I did.
     LMP Gee, I'm sorry you had to admit that, Stu.
     CC Oh, you all just do such good work.

[01:19:33:05]
_page : 237
_tape : Tape 31/7
CMP: Okay, the thing is, it seems to me like, in one g, the Benard cells started completely back to the edge, you know, right back to the edge of the circle. And in this case, at least, they haven't filled in yet back to the edge of the circle at all. They all started out in the center and are working around the bubbles, and then it's now -just now starting to form a few of them where there aren't any bubbles.
     CC Roger, Ron,.

[01:19:33:37]
CC: How large are the cells, Ron?
     CMP Well, they're varying considerably in size. I can see one that's about a half an inch across, and then the other ones - they've got a great big bubble in it, and yet the cell itself is down to maybe an eighth of an inch. The bigger ones seem to be on the outside; and, of course, there are very few bubbles on the outside also.
     CC Okay.
     CMP And the bigger ones, generally right now, are averaging about - oh, a fourth to three-eights of an inch in their cross - cross section ,..

[01:19:34:57]
CMP: The cells tend to be somewhat polygonal. Let's see, we've been going 6 minutes - 4 minutes into the heating part of it, and the - the cells are polygonal, but they don't seem to be quite as - as straightlined as they were on the ground.
     CC Roger. We copy.

CMP: It almost looks like it's reached a steady state now. It's 9 minus 2-7 minutes.
     CC Roger.

[01:19:36:30]
CMP: Hey, I think the one thing I neglected to mention is that we essentially have a convex surface from the - the material; in other words, con - convex with the high part in the middle; and, of course, that's where the bubbles are, too, but I think you'd generally have that type of a surface anyhow And, It hasnԴ broken the meniscus of the lower, or the thinnest ring.

[01:19:37:35]
LMP: We should have had some popcorn on our stowage list.
     CC Roger.

[01:19:39:48]
CMP: Okay; now the Benard cells are starting to form in that outer annulus that went all the way around

[01:19:45:55]
CC: CMP Roger. Okay; we went back to light 4 now. And we never did get any real beliginal [sic] cells formed around the outer annulus. And even the cells that were formed on the thing, it seemed like the particle flow within the cells was very slow when you compare that with the way it was in one g.
     CC Roger, Ron.

[01:19:48:03]
CMP: Okay; I'm trying to - such the stuff back in the -the entry tube there, and it looks like part of it's going in.
     CC Roger, Ron. We copy that.

[01:19:49:07]
CMP: And the camera is down to about 50 percent here, so I'm going to go ahead and turn it off now.
     CC Roger, Ron.

CC: Ron, if I didn't tell you, we concur with turning the DAC off there.
     CMP Okay; yes, I got you. I'll turn it off.

[01:19:50:06]
CMP: You know, I just happened to think, after I've already sucked part of those bubbles back in there, we've got enough fluid in there to pump it out the next time without sucking that back in there, don't we?
     CC I'm sorry, Ron. Say that again.
     CMP Don't we have enough of the Krytox fluid without sucking that back in there? Maybe I can just wipe the Krytox off with some Kleenex, and maybe there won't be any bubbles the next time.
     CC Okay; stand by.

[01:19:51:00]
CC: Ron, I guess we understand you've pulled some back in, but you haven't pulled any of the bubbles. Now, if you pull any more in, you're going to start the bubbles back In. Is that correct?
     CMP Yes; that's correct.
     CC Okay; why don't you stand by here on that then?
     CMP Let me see - I'll see if I can push the bubbles out of the way here with something.

[01:19:51:29]
CC: Okay. The consensus is that we would like to not pull the bubbles back in. I think you've got a good idea.
     CMP Okay.
     CC It's the old keep-the-bubbles-out-of-the-Krytox trick.

[01:19:51:48]
CMP: (Laughter) Okay; I'll see if I can do It.

[01:19:52:09]
LMP: I see you're finally getting caught up in the humor of the thing there, Stu.
     CC Oh, I've always been in good humor. It sure sounded like that batt did the trick, Ron.
     CMP Yes, I think it did, too. It looks like it worked real well.

     CC Okay.

_extra : a cherry bar, and an orange drink. And that hero of the matinee, the matinee idol of Spaceship America, had scrambled eggs, bacon squares, peaches, cinnamon toast, orange juice, and cocoa for breakfast. That's how he keeps his form. And, for lunch, he had a peanut butter sandwich and citrus beverage. And that's it, since there's nobody else up here.
LMP: Okay. The CDR today had scrambled eggs and three bacon squares and a can of peaches and pineapple drink for breakfast. And then later on in the day, he had peanut butter, jelly, and bread with a chocolate bar and some dried apricots.

CC: Jack, we appreciate all your information, and weԤ like to just pass on some recommendations here from the ground that we'd like you to keep on with your regular menu as much as possible. And, if you do cut anything off, we'd like you to concentrate on eating the meats, the juices, and the fruitcake, which are the most effective for maintaining your electrolyte balance.

     CC Roger. We understand, Gene, Also, on that group of foods, peanut butter's great for the bal -electrolyte balance, also; so you're doing okay.
     CDR I knew it was good for something. It couldn't be that good without being good for something.
     LMP I think we're all trying to make a concentrated effort also to keep quite a bit of water down.

     LMP Okay. Got a little information on what we were talking about yesterday with respect to southern Pacific weather, if you've got nothing else going on.
     CC Go; speak to me.
     LMP Okay, looks like a little - cyclonic circulation we had over New Zealand is still there. It's -looks like the front it was associated with is broken up a little bit; however, that pattern is -seems to be hugging the New Zealand area, and -but not - has not intensified. If - if not - it may have even weakened a little bit since yestery-day. It's hard to be sure exactly. The front does not look as strong, and it still seems to be hanging just stabilized and with all of Australia clear now and the western edge of that front being just offshore north of Brisbane. The - there is -east of New Guinea - in the vicinity of the Solomon Islands, it looks like a fairly moderate-sized cyclone developing at the western edge of the - of a front that was somewhat farther north and west than the one over New Zealand. North of that -Wake/Kwajalein region that was of interest
