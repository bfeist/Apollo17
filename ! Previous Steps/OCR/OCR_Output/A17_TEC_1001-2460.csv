Tape 91A/16||||LMP-LM|Okay. Hold on for 30 seconds.|05 15 49 22|CDR-LM|Hey, while John's talking to me, why don't you check my biopad out. We're going left.||CC|Okay, fine. We'll take a check, Geno. Let me ask you one question here on the - on Jack's water - on his PLSS water cell. We're showing about 3 pounds too much water in the LM system, and we're wondering if you got the AUX tanks filled up In Jack's PLSS. Two questions. Did you - were you sure to have the AUX valve open and did you see good clear water in the sight gage with no bubbles after the fill? Over.||LMP-LM|I guess we'd have to say yes to those questions, but if you've got a question on it we can go through it again. I'd rather do that than take a chance.|05 15 50 21|CC|Let me make sure we want to do that. While we're making sure, I checked with both homefronts and Nassau Bay and Tucson are both in good shape. Geno, Tracy upstaged you for about 30 minutes last night on local TV during her own Interview there and drew everybody away from watching EVA during that time. She did very well.||CDR-LM|Yes, that sort of - that sort of figures. Key, Gordo, why do you say Jack's PLSS? Did you see the water drop In the LM when we charged mine?||CC|It was the profile of the water quantity as you were filling both PLSS's, and it was the fill -during Jack's fill that looked suspicious like just maybe 3 pounds less than there should have been flow when you were filling Jack's.||CDR-LM|Yes, well, you know there - it's all - it's only ... to know whether or not you've got it filled. I sure don't want to go out there and have him just have some partial water. So let's do the conservative thing.||CC|Okay. I'll - I'll verify that. There was some drinking water going - going out at that time, too, which muddles up the data a little bit, so we're not absolutely certain on that.||||||Tape 91A/17||LMP-LM|Okay. We weren't drinking water while we were filling the PLSS, however.||CDR-LM|Okay. You come up with what you think best on that, and I going to copy John.|05 15 52 00|MCC|"Okay, Geno, I don't think you need to copy this. Sort of just - ad-lib it. With your four chrono-paque maps, tape two maps and allow about a 1-inch overlap to a 15-inch by 10-1/2-inch configuration. That's an estimate. And then repeat with two other maps, and then tape both the two maps - now four maps - tape them together, and you'll end up with a sheet that's about 15 inches by 19 inches, a sheet of chronopaque. And then tape both sides of it - the overlapping edges to strengthen it. And you can further strengthen it, if you tape an ""X"" of tape across both sides of it. And then, on the roll up, on the long axis, and secure it with a strip of tape and put it in the ETB. And on that strip of tape you secure it with - be sure and leave a tab on the end of it so you can get it off with your gloves. And then remove clamps from both the utility light units, and open the clamp jaws to max. And then tighten the mounting bracket that you've got on it so it will be swinging around; and stow the clamps in the ETB, You got that, Gene?"||CDR-LM|Yes, sir.|05 15 53 43|MCC|Okay. And then - now you've got everything you need. And it's all put together and all ready to - to be fastened to the - to the Rover. And then when you get the ETB in the seat, you unroll the chronopaque sheet and you locate the front edge with the long axis fore and aft, even with - even with the axle. And you lay the edge of the sheet over the inboard guide rail and you clamp it. And you lay the other edge of the sheet over the outboard guide rail and clamp it. And, as I said, the inboard clamp must be directly over the axle to avoid interference while steering. And tighten the clamps securely, both of them. And then while you're driving around out there by yourself, it would be good if Jack could take a look at it and||||Tape 91A/18|||||see if you're getting any unusual dynamics. And at station 2, you should inspect the fender for any unusual wear that might have been caused by this mass out there on the fender, of those clamps bouncing up and down. One thing about it, doing it in a suit, Gene, you have to push in with your leg and hold - and it's sort of a two-handed job. And I'm not sure in 1/6 g if you can position the fender, the pseudofender, on there without Jack say holding on to the long end behind the Rover so that won't - won't fall off. It works okay in one g for one man. But I'm not sure it's not a 2-g proposition - a two-man proposition in 1/6. Over.|05 15 55 27|CDR-LM|Okay. We'll take a look at it, babe.||MCC|Okay, and you really have to bear down to get those - -||CDR-LM|I just - -||MCC|- - things on a dovetail there.||CDR-LM|I just want to make sure of the geometry now. We want to put the - take two of those pages and put the 10-inch sides together overlapping, right?||MCC|Yes, sir.||CDR-LM|Then take two more and put the 10-inch sides together overlapping, right?||MCC|That's true.||CDR-LM|And then take those two pieces you've got now and put them end to end, so you've got the long - a long fender. Sounds right to me. Sound right to you?||MCC|Well, you end up with - you end up with four -you end up with all four pieces in a big rectangle. See what I'm - you see what I'm saying, you've got a 15-inch by 19-inch sheet of paper.||||||Tape 91A/19||CDR-LM|Yes, we got it - we got it, John. And I copy the overlap and everything. If you had no overlap, I guess you'd have about 16 by 20.||MCC|That's correct. But you need to overlap, and taping both sides of it gives it more strength, which you need in that situation. You just want to make sure it's not more than an inch, or you won't have enough to cover up those dovetails.||CDR-LM|Okay, babe, we're going to work on it right now.|05 15 57 25|CC|Jack and Gene, this is Gordo again. On the PLSS charge, we're recommending you hook up Jack's according to the decal. Go right ahead and - stand by 1. Okay. Go by the decal and do the full 5-minute fill on Jack's PLSS. It'll take that long to get the AUX tanks filled up, if It was indeed empty. And maybe that's something you can start and then work on the - the paper taping. Over.||CDR-LM|Okay.|05 16 00 30|LMP-LM|Okay, Gordy. I started - I'm on step 4 on the decal - step 5 on the decal.||CC|Okay, Jack. John Covington advises that the sight gage is not a certain indicator that you're filled, and so we're just going to go by time to be sure, and try to disregard the sight gage readings as a positive Indication anyway.||LMP-LM|Okay, understand that from the past, and we went exactly by time before. We'll try it again here.|05 l6 01 06|CC|Okay.|05 l6 05 41|CDR-LM|Okay, Gordy. Is that about 5 minutes?||CC|Stand by. See if anybody timed you here. That's affirm; 5 minutes now.||LMP-LM|Okay. Step 7 is complete.||CC|Okay. And we did not see any water flow to speak of, so it probably was full.||||Tape 91A/20||||LMP-LM|Yes, the condensate indications here were that it was full.||CC|Okay. Better to be sure.|05 16 07 11|LMP-LM|No questions.|05 16 09 38|CC|Geno, this is Houston - we want to be sure to have one look at your BIOMED before you get into the suit in case something is wrong with it. And if you go right by the checklist, we'll miss that look. So when you get to a convenient place, if you can go to LEFT and have us take a look at it, we'd appreciate it.||CDR-LM|Gordy, apparently you - Okay. Stand by. I called it out. I didn't give it to you. Stand by.|05 16 10 27|CDR-LM|Okay. Now it's yours.||CC|Okay.||CC|Okay. That looks good, Geno. You can press on with the suiting operation, there.||CDR-LM|Okay. Call me the little old fender maker.||CC|Roger.||CDR-LM|S-BAND VOICE going to VOICE.|05 16 12 06|CC|Roger.|05 16 18 47|CC|Jack, Houston. With respect to the PLSS water fill, last thing we heard you say was doing step 7- We just want to verify that you did go ahead and do step 8, which is connect the waste management system to the PLSS AUX vent for 10 seconds. Over.||LMP-LM|Yes, that was all done, Gordy. We just got sidetracked, and I didn't call you.|05 16 19 08|CC|Okay, Thank you.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 91B/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|05 16 25 05|CC|Ron, you should not see a tape motion light at LOS here, be - or - flag, because we've got the dump done and rewound ahead of time. They're rewinding it right now.||CMP|Oh, okay. Want me to configure the DSE, though, at 39:32 right?||CC|That's affirmative.||CMP|Okay.|05 16 28 49|CMP|How's the crew of Challenger? Are they getting about ready to go out again?||CC|They're a little bit delayed, Ron, but there's no problem. They just slept a little longer and -Yes, they're in their prep - pre-EVA prep.||CMP|Yes .||CC|And everything's going good.||CMP|Bet they're going to find that Scarp is a pretty good hill.|05 16 29 19|CC|Roger. We understand.||CC|America, Houston. At your convenience, Ron - no hurry on this - we'd like you to service your ZPN sensors on each side there. We're getting some bad data on that now.||CMP|'They're itching. (Laughter)||CC|Roger.||CMP|Yes, it's pretty dry.||CC|Roger. The - Dr. Z. recommends you might find a new location for them - just move them around a little bit, and put some cream on the other ones.||CMP|Okay.||||Tape 91B/2||||CC|There's no hurry on that, Ron, I wouldn't interrupt what you're doing now to - for that - it's not critical.||CMP|Okay, I understand, Bob. I'll - -||CC|You sound like a tour - -||CMP|I will as soon as I get a chance. Okay?||CC|Roger. You sound like a tourist up there.||CMP|(Laughter) That's right.||CC|Going to need a Kodak store here shortly, I'm afraid.||CMP|(Laughter)||CC|Okay, Ron, you might want to look at your Flight Plan when you get a chance. We're coming up on a SIM bay reconfiguration here shortly.||CMP|Ah-ha. Okay.||CMP|56, 57, 58, 59 -|05 16 35 02|CMP|MARK it. OFF.||CC|Roger. We got it.||CMP|... wherever that is.||CMP|Okay. RECORDER is going OFF, not the HEATERS. RADAR is OFF. DATA SYSTEM is ON. Uh-oh. Should have the SM/AC POWER switch up - up there (laughter) at 230, as much as we use It.||CC|Roger. I concur with that one. I thought it would only be in the simulation that it would get to you on that one.||CDR|(Laughter) Yes. Okay. SM/AC POWER is ON. The old MAPPER's going to STANDBY. IR is going ON. SELF TEST is going to HEATERS. UV is going ON, Now, we're going to open IR and we're going to wait on UV.||||||Tape 91B/3|05 16 37 19|CC|We concur with that, Ron.||CMP|Okay.||CC|We'll give you a cue on that UV COVER, OPEN, here.|05 16 37 33|CMP|Okay, there's the IR. Barber pole. And a gray.||CMP|Houston, America.||CC|Go ahead, Ron.||CMP|Okay. Are you going to try to ship the back-side DSE back in there for this next pass - on the Orbital science visuals and stuff?||CC|Ron, we're calling for the DSE operation exactly as - as it is in the Flight Plan. Is that - do you concur with that?||CMP|Oh, yes. I concur, but I mean - sure, that's -that's no problem there. But I mean getting it back to Houston before the end of the flight, you know.||CC|Negative. That was not in the plans unless you want us to, Ron. We don't have any provision to - to - to record it and send it back here, until it comes back in the transcript form.||CMP|Okay, no problem. I'll paraphrase what I say then, and when I get into AOS over there.||CC|Okay. No sweat. And if you have something you really want us to listen to, we can bring up the loop to get It, but it takes a little effort, Ron. That's all.||CMP|Okay. Yes. No, I - it's - let's don't do it, yet.||CC|Ron, I just heard the voice quality has been real good. We've listened to it several different times, and it's been real good and we can bring it in without too much problem. Probably wouldn't be ready for the next rev, but we can get it In here without too much strain, if you want it brought in.||||Tape 91B/4||||CMP|Okay. I think it might be worthwhile, especially on - on this particular one, where I'll be essentially talking all the way across, on this one.||CC|Okay, we'll just plan on it, Ron.||CMP|If it's not too much of a problem. Yes.|05 16 40 32|CC|Okay, Ron. You can UV COVER, OPEN, anytime.||CMP|... Okay. Okay.|05 16 40 40|CMP|OFF, OPEN, barber pole. And it's gray.||CC|Ron, we need to precondition our tanks again. We'd like tank 2 FANs to OFF, please.|05 16 4l 07|CMP|tank 2 FANs are OFF.||CC|Roger.||CC|And, Ron, just a reminder, ve will bring in that voice from the - the rev 27 backside pass.||CMP|Oh, okay, good. Thank you. Tell the lunar sounder guys I'm sorry if I pointed their antenna in the wrong direction there, for a short period of time.||CC|No problem. Just one question, Ron, that is the Hasselblad we're hearing every once in a while, isn't it?||CMP|There's what?||CC|Is that your camera running? Every once in a while?||CMP|||CC|Yes .||CMP|No, not now.||||||Tape 91B/5||CC|How about during this eat period - on this pass, were you running the camera quite a bit?||CMP|Wo. The only thing was - was the Nikon.||CC|Okay, understand. We keep hearing something that sure sounds like the camera is chugging - -||CMP|The - might have been picking up the tape re -no, it might have been the tape recorder. Might have been me, trying to clear my ears, you know?||CC|No, I don't think so.|05 16 45 29|CC|Ron, we're a few minutes from LOS. And you're looking real good.||CMP|Okay, Robert. Thank you much. We'll see you on the other side.||CC|Okeydoke. And I'll try and get through to the -the homefront here, maybe for this next pass. And you are going to be pretty busy, but I'll give you a little update.|05 16 45 49|CMP|Okay.|05 IT 06 XX||BEGIN LUNAR REV 27|05 17 33 16|CMP|... it as well as the - some of the more Eratosthenian craters around Saenger. Looks to me like you can still have a little bit of a hint - at least of the layering, or a broken-up different-colored material at the top of all these craters.||CMP|And supposed to stop and rewind the DSE. Forgot to do that.||CC|Roger, Ron. We'll take care of the DSE.||CMP|Okay. Okay, I'll let you do it.||||Tape 91B/6||||CC|Roger, Ron.||CMP|Okay.||CMP|Okay. I took three, or four, pictures on mag 00 up to frame 104 kind of looking north across the Arabia.||CC|Roger, Ron. We copy.||CC|Ron. Just some words for you. We placed - -||CMP|Okay, kind of a - Okay, go ahead.||CC|No, go ahead - go ahead with yours. We don't want to interrupt.||CMP|I was just going to say that on the crater Aitken, on the other side, is probably - there are no -no - rays - visible rays that I can see at the low Sun angle, anyhow, coming across there. There's definitely a mare floor in there. It's a dark albedo-type - flat floor with swirls in it; no definite expression of swirls. One thing that's quite apparent, you have a flow scarp in the northeast corner of it coming out of - oh, a little cloverleaf-type of an area there. I'm going to have to look the next pass over it to see if, on account of the south domical structure that's in there, it's breached. And I can't tell if the flow of material is flowing to the east out of that domical structure or if the flow is flowing into the domical structure. I ought to take a better look at that the next time - the next time around.|05 IT 37 11|CC|Roger. We got you. See any lava marks on the crater rims, there?||CMP|Well, that's - that's the - the lava mark is what I'd call - is almost a lava scarp - in - up in the northeast corner. There are some lava marks along the central peak. They aren't nearly as apparent as the one up in the northeast corner. The northeast corner is definitely a flow front -a lava flow front, that has flown up the - the old interior wall of the crater.||||||Tape 91B/T||CC|Roger, Ron. What's the color of the dome in Aitken?||CMP|Well, the color of the dome in Aitken is - the colors are hard to - to visualize - the color of the dome is essentially the same as, as - pretty much the surrounding material around there. Maybe a little bit lighter - a little bit lighter than the surrounding material. Of course it's definitely lighter than the floor. The floor itself, to me, has a tan - had a tan to it.||CC|Okay, Ron. We'll have to break away here a second. PAN CAMERA MODE to STANDBY.|05 17 38 41|CMP|Okay.||CC|If you haven't got your Plight Plan, it's PAN CAMERA MODE to STANDBY, then POWER ON.|05 17 38 55|CMP|... Okay, POWER is going ON.||CC|Okay, Ron. And it's time to charge battery A and we'll cue you on the PAN CAMERA POWER OFF. Okay, that should have been deleted. We've already charged the bat A, so - -||CMP|... Yes. Yes. It's already charging.||CC|Right. Sorry about that, Ron.||CMP|Okay, no problem.|05 17 39 17|CC|How about the freshness of the wall and ejecta materials, and the brightness of the rim deposits on Aitken while we have a minute here.||CMP|Okay. The brightness of the rim deposits are a little bit brighter than the surrounding area on the thing. The way that you put It, probably early Eratosthenian. It's definitely not Copernican because I can't see - well, at least in that low Sun - I can't see any rays - any rays around it. But probably late Eratosthenian -somewhere in that area because you have the slumping - Well, it's not subdued at all. The walls themselves - of the crater are not subdued. They are fairly fresh - not as fresh as Copernican.||||Tape 91B/8|||||And - and I just can't remember whether we had the - seems to me like it was brighter at the higher Sun angles around there, which indicate that there would still be some remnants of a -of a bright ring around it.||CC|Okay, Ron. And whenever you're ready, PAN CAMERA POWER to OFF.|05 17 40 35|CMP|PAN CAMERA POWER is going OFF.||CC|And -we're with all eyes here waiting for a Crisium-Serenitatis visual.||CMP|(Laughter) Okay.||CC|Anything at all, Ron, while we've got an open area, anything you want to say - we're following you on the map - just sing out.||CMP|Okay.||CC|Ron, while you're thinking here a second, do you have any views on the possible origin of the domes in Aitken?||CMP|Well, I'm pretty sure they've got to be volcanic in origin. That's what - that's what it looks like to me anyhow. And especially if I can determine that the material in the northeast corner of Aitken has flown out of that domical little structure in there.||CC|Roger. Understand.|05 17 42 51 »•|CMP|You know something - the observation that I think is pretty significant is the fact that most of the 30-kilometer craters on the back side of the Moon seem to be fairly fresh. And any of them that are fresh - by fresh I mean you don't have any real definite ray pattern to them, but you've got a real smooth - not smooth but streaked straight - slope, 45-degree angle going down into the crater and the crater wall. And then you get down to the bottom of the crater, and you got a flat floor down there or sometimes there is a domical type of a floor. And the domical material down there doesn't resemble anything like the stuff that's slumped down the side.||||||Tape 91B/9||CC|Okay, we copy. Ron, if you're handy, you might hit Error RESET on the DSKY. It looks like you might have hit a MARK button or something.||CMP|... Yes, might have hit the MARK button.||CC|That - that makes it.||CMP|Okay. I just got used to the other attitude, and now I'm at a different attitude. (Laughter) ... attitude, though.||CC|Roger. Understand. Roger. Are you able to pick anything up on the Crisium yet?|05 17 44 37|CMP|No, just now coming up on Crisium. I just now see it out of window 5» Just off the southern edge. Let me try window 3; I think it might be better.||CC|Okay; you might remember we're looking for the colored tones , the shades between units up on Crisium, and we're looking for location of color boundaries relative to the mare ridge system.|05 17 45 10|CMP|Okay, I'm looking at the eastern edge of Crisium now. As you come across there, it looks there might be - a little bit darker - You know, I keep seeing browns all the time up here instead of grays - gray tones. Maybe that's just the way I interpret them. They are - to me kind of a brownish tint to them, and it's a darker brown than the - the stuff to the - to the south of the ridge system there.||CC|Roger. Ron, our data would show that CM5 might be a better window.||CMP|Take a look at that one. Yes, it's a little better. Looking straight down. I am just now passing that crater I took a picture of on the last time - of the pass on there. And instead of having a round bottom, it's got a diamond-shape fill in the bottom. And the diamond, Itself, is about - oh, a half of the crater diameter. And this is on the south rim of Crisium.||||Tape 91B/10||||CC|Okay. We copy. Does the ridge system cross the color boundary, Ron, in Crisium?|05 17 46 52|CMP|Well, this ridge system is running east and west down here. The color boundary isn't nearly as apparent in Crisium as it is in Serenitatis. Except that right under me right now there's kind of a subdued crater-type thing and with a southern part of a ridge. The ridge runs east - west, and it looks like we've got a flow coming out of it. Let me see if I can get a quick picture of that one. Well, lost my camera (laughter). Here it is. Oh, it's too late; it's gone now. You know something, you see this subsolar point, it's kind of -zero phase - zero phase point, I mean, is following me right along out here in Crisium, so I get a different color straight out from the window than I do out from the edge of it. So I think that's going to influence my thinking.||CC|Roger, Ron. How does color of Picard - the rim deposits on Picard compare to the surrounding mare material there?|05 17 48 35|CMP|Okay. The color on Picard is - is definitely darker. It's got a darker rim, darker material that goes out to - oh about a half a crater and some points extending out to a crater diameter. And then from south arcing around to the west to -to the northwest corner, you got some light-colored material on top of that.||CC|Is any of that tan or brown?||CMP|It's kind of a - the darker material I'd call tannish-gray. More gray than tan. In other words, the whole mare, itself, I'd consider kind of a - kind of a light tan. And then the type of material, the dark material that's flowing out -has flown out - is kind of a tannish-gray.||CC|Okay. In the inner appearances of Picard, for color variations, can you determine different units based on color and flow characteristics?||||||Tape 91B/11|05 17 49 42|CMP|Yes, you can. In the area where you have the white thrown out on top, you essentially got a -as - as you go down the crater wall, you've got a white streak that goes all the way around it, and then you've got a dark layer underneath that. And then a white layer on below that.||CC|Roger. Are you saying the color zones are concentric?||CMP|Yes, the color zones are concentric going around.||CC|Beautiful. How about the central peak material to that of the crater walls?|05 17 50 30|CMP|Well, the central peak material is - you know, it's more smooth-type stuff. This stuff in the crater walls is - fine, straight sloping, except where it is slumped down. Where it's slumped down, it's just kind of piled up - a jumble of -type stuff, you know?||CC|Roger.||CMP|You know, in the crater nearest over there has the same color distinction around it for - out for about a crater diameter, except it doesn't have any of the light material on it at all.||CC|Okay, Ron, we might direct your attention to the dark halo craters in the western Mare Crisium. Are they impact or volcanic in origin?||CMP|You can see some of the rays from the crater Proclus have spread out all the way across here. And they completely cover up the ridge system that goes around there, so I can't see any color distinction on the eastern - or on the western edge of Crisium.||CC|Roger. We copy. How about those dark halo craters? Are they volcanic in origin?||||Tape 91B/12|||05 17 51 40|CMP|Some of the - Yes, I was looking at the volcanic -or the dark-rimmed craters, and some of them have what I'd call a - an ejecta pattern around them; and the others just have kind of a raised rim with no apparent blocks. The one to the west - let's see, southwest - of that little V that sticks out there by Yerkes - that hill that sticks out there by Yerkes - now, that's the one that, to me, looks like it has an ejecta pattern around it with blocks It's about a - oh, a thousand-meter crater.||CC|Roger. Got it. Oh that crater that you mentioned was a flow pattern, will you be sure and make a mark on your map on that, please? We're really interested in that.||CMP|Okay.||CC|Should be coming up on Macrobius by now, aren't you?|05 17 53 07|CMP|Yes, I can just barely see Macrobius. And - ... be better out of window 3.||CC|Okay. We're standing by.||CMP|I'm looking for any dark-halo craters in - I was looking for any dark-halo .craters in this area that might be sticking through the Proclus rays. Well, you know, you compare on either side of the Proclus ray, though, and the same size crater rather ... Tranquilitatis or the - the moundy stuff before you get to Tranquilitatis are really underneath Coper - the - the Proclus ray. You get the same albedo of ray material from the small craters in either case.||CC|Roger. We understand.|05 17 54 12|CMP|Oh, here's a Macrobius A and B. Course, J-3 is up there. The two dark craters - well, the one just - north, I guess, of Macrobius A, and also north of J-3 - that's the one that has the dark mound around it. It's got a small dome down in the center. It - it doesn't have any ejecta pattern around it - you know, no rays, no nothing. To me, that looks like - it sure looks like a||||||Tape 9IB/13|||cinder cone to me. You get that same type of feeling. The dark halo that goes around it goes out for at least a crater and a half diameter. The raised dome down in the center of the crater is about a fourth of a crater diameter. And there are no rays. And it has a dark halo.||CC|See any color tones on that crater at all, Ron?|05 17 56 05|CMP|Yes, the color on that particular - color of that is the same color as you see in Maraldi and as you see in the landing site. And that is what I consider the dark tannish - tannish gray.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 92A/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|05 16 40 09|CDR-LM|Okay, Gordy.

Thank you.|05 16 51 40|LMP-LM|Bob, how do you read the BIOMED on the LMP?||CC|Stand by, Jack. It looks beautiful, Jack. I think that means loud and clear.||CC|And, Challenger, have you changed your ECS LiOH can?||LMP-LM|Bob, we did not. I guess we missed that in the checklist.||CC|Okay. That's sort of towards the end of 3-9-||LMP-LM|Bob, I guess we're not quite there yet.||CC|Okay . Copy that.|05 16 59 l4|CDR-LM|Okay, Bob. The canister's changed.||CC|Roger. We saw that.

I got good data up here.|05 17 02 15|CC|Yes, we're GO to do the battery management now, Jack. Pick up the HIGH BIT RATE.||LMP-LM|Roger.||CC|And a thought for the day. We're not sure if there is going to be any need for the scissors outside today. And if you guys wanted to keep from picking them up off the ground and worrying about them, you might just leave them inside if you haven't packed them already.||CDR-LM|Bob, you never know. We're going to take them out with us. So just make a note that we bring them back In, would you?||CC|Okay. I'll make a little note again.||||||Tape 92A/3||LMP-LM|Okay.

That's good.||LMP-LM|Let's get another zap of water here.||CDR-LM|If I have any more water I'll float out there.||CDR-LM|(Laughter)||CDR-LM|Good Navy man.||LMP-LM|Be a good place to fill with water, you'd make a nice rec site out of this valley. You could put some cabins up on the side of the massif. Nice flat bottom, no trees. Both mags up. The fishing ought to be pretty good if you stocked it.||CDR-LM|Have a bear island and a family island.||LMP-LM|(Laughter)||LMP-LM|We're going to fill up the other end though, so it doesn't drain out.||CDR-LM|Looks funny like that.||LMP-LM|... turn your DESCENT WATER OFF.||CDR-LM|Snaps, snaps, snaps; the whole world is held together with snaps!|05 17 36 11|LMP-LM|Okay, I've got my hand lube. You can position your mikes.|05 17 36 l4|CDR-LM|Water is going off.||LMP-LM|Okay.||LMP-LM|Fasten your mikes now, before we turn the fans on you'd better -||||Tape 92A/10||||LMP-LM|Well let's just look ahead; we've got helmets ready to go - big bag position you happy with.||CDR-LM|Yes, more or less a little far out, but I think -||LMP-LM|Make sure you've got the plug out.|05 17 36 30|CDR-LM|Okay. Plug is out. My end's red now, but that's all you can get it out.||CDR-LM|Feel a little pressure in there. You might let out.||LMP-LM|Okay. And then we'll lower our protective visor and secure tool harness and self doff straps.||CDR-LM|Okay, and that's ...||LMP-LM|That's already stowed. Okay. Let's start with you first. You can turn your - let me get your ... then you can get it over your head and turn your 02 - your fan on rather.||CDR-LM|Okay.||LMP-LM|Okay, you ready?||CDR-LM|Okay, check all that -||LMP-LM|Wait what is this right here? Okay, now let me make sure it's in front of everything.||CDR-LM|Okay.||LMP-LM|The alignment is way over here.||LMP-LM|Let me -||CDR-LM|That's good. Okay. That's aligned right there.||LMP-LM|Oh, boy.||CDR-LM|That will never do. With that down in there. Okay. You're still clear. Starting.||CDR-LM|Manischewitz.||||||Tape 92A/11||LMP-LM|I think it's caught on the food stick. I think you ought to open it up.||CDR-LM|I think you're right.||CDR-LM|Okay. Get it all the way off.||LMP-LM|Okay. Now let's try it. Looks like it's going to be much better. Getting it back.||LMP-LM|Want to make sure that thing is on.||LMP-LM|No, not happy yet. Not happy yet.||LMP-LM|Guess what now. I tell you, I got my fingers on it all the way around.||CDR-LM|Okay. It's locked. It's aligned. Better put your .fan on here pretty quick.|05 17 39 13|CDR-LM|Okay. Fan's on.||CDR-LM|Okay, let me get you dressed up back here. If that center doesn't work, you're going to keep this thing -|05 17 39 22|LMP-LM|And I'm vertical.||CDR-LM|You are vertical alright. Okay. You're covered down there. You are locked. Okay - whoo! Okay?||LMP-LM|This is my turn.||CDR-LM|Let's verify all these things.||LMP-LM|Okay. Go ahead.|05 17 39 57|CDR-LM|Okay. Got your comm. That’s you OPS, that's your inlet, that's your oxygen or your exhaust and your purge valve.||LMP-LM|Okay.||CDR-LM|And your water||LMP-LM|Okay, let me take a look at all yours. Okay. That's locked - locked, that's locked, you're vertical. That's locked. That's locked. That's||||Tape 92A/12|||||locked. Okay. Get my helmet on. The main thing is to get this stuff back over here.||CDR-LM|Yes.||CDR-LM|Way out.||LMP-LM|Okay. Can you grab your food stick, cause that -that hung up on mine.||CDR-LM|Okay.||CDR-LM|Got it. You're locked.||LMP-LM|Feels good in the back?||CDR-LM|Yes. And it's locked.||LMP-LM|It's hard to see with that visor on there.||CDR-LM|Okay. That's latched down. You're locked again.||CDR-LM|And, she's in the engaged position here, huh?||LMP-LM|That's affirm. I'm engaged.||LMP-LM|Okay. Verify, verify, verify. Circuit breaker wiped out plus EVA decals.||CDR-LM|Whoo! Can you give me a little room to turn?||LMP-LM|Yep. Go ahead.||CDR-LM|Okay. White, white. Leave the pump on for a minute . You want.||LMP-LM|Yes.||CDR-LM|Okay; and EVA decals, all right?||LMP-LM|Okay.||LMP-LM|You want me over here?||LMP-LM|Let me turn the page. Don our EV gloves.||CDR-LM|Okay. In work.||||||Tape 92A/13||CC|Geno, we don't see your fan on. If you've got your helmet on, you ought to have your fan on.||CDR-LM|Thank you, Bob. Good call. The royal MOCK ... Boy, grease and lunar dust really make a nice mobile graphite material.|05 17 43 52|LMP-LM|Okay. I'm locked on the right, verified. The old gauntlet's coming on. Okay, and I've got my cover on over here. Get yours?||CDR-LM|Yes, I'm getting one of them anyway.||LMP-LM|I can get the other one for you.||LMP-LM|Okay. Number 2. Okay, ... many.||CDR-LM|And it's on, and locked, and locked verified.||LMP-LM|I may be learning how on these, finally. Okay. Mine's or. and locked. If I can get my black band on here. I think I'm learning how, Geno. Crazy. Like a trained band putter onner. Okay. I feel pretty good. Need some help?||CDR-LM|No, mine's all on. I can't figure that out. Must be easier in 1/6 g.||CDR-LM|(Laughter)||CDR-LM|Get my gauntlet donned. And that's dirt protecting dirt.||LMP-LM|Don't throw down a gauntlet, Gene.||CDR-LM|That's dirt protecting dirt. Okay. It's all on, Jack.||LMP-LM|Okay. Where did we leave off?|05 17 46 11|CDR-LM|Right up here.||LMP-LM|Okay, PGA is not biting, LCG's cold, let's leave it cold.||CDR-LM|Well, I guess you've got to open it now. We've got to disconnect the water.||||Tape 92A/14||||LMP-LM|You ready?||CDR-LM|Yes.||LMP-LM|Let's do it then.|05 17 46 27|LMP-LM|Okay. It's disconnected.||CDR-LM|Okay, and did you disconnect your -||LMP-LM|Let me come around - okay, let's turn around and let's help each other. Let's get the -||CDR-LM|It's still 3 degrees. Pitch up 5 degrees.||LMP-LM|Pitch up yours - its an awful nuisance, Cernan.||CDR-LM|Hold that for a minute.||LMP-LM|I don't know why you don't learn how to land one of these things.||CDR-LM|"Hold that for a minute - it was a pitching deck. Okay, that is in. Boy, its in. Locked - took a lot to ""in"" it."||LMP-LM|Okay. Dust cover is covering it.||CDR-LM|Okay. You know those chamber runs we had were probably some of the best training we ever did. I hate to say that, because it was some work. Push that thing on. There you go. Good. Keep trying. It was just a little sluggish. Let me verify it.||LMP-LM|Lock?||CDR-LM|It won't turn.||CDR-LM|Oh, every time you do that, my stomach gurgles. (Laughter) Okay, let me turn around to stow.||LMP-LM|You can stow that, and mine's over here.|05 17 48 07|CDR-LM|Okay. Attach our PLSS water hoses. PLSS diverter valve, MIN. Want to verify that?||||||Tape 92A/15|05 17 48 21|LMP-LM|And, connect PLSS water hose, verify lock, PLSS diverter valve MIN, and PLSS pump. Okay?||CDR-LM|Wait a minute. I want to make sure this is out of the way when I come in.||LMP-LM|Okay. Watch my diverter MIN.||CDR-LM|Watch your diverter -||CDR-LM|It's MIN.||LMP-LM|It's MIN? Your pump's on and PRESS REGs A and B egress.||CDR-LM|Okay. Pump's on.||LMP-LM|Man, I'm getting a little bite ...||CDR-LM|Okay. The next thing is to turn your PLSS 0^ on, anyway.||LMP-LM|Oh, okay.||CDR-LM|Then we go to egress.||LMP-LM|Egress.||CDR-LM|Egress on the REGs.||LMP-LM|The REGs are egress.||CDR-LM|Okay. You ready on my mark.||LMP-LM|Wait a minute.||CDR-LM|Tell me when you're ready.||LMP-LM|Find it.||CDR-LM|Say when.||LMP-LM|Well, where is it? Okay, let's go aft.|05 17 49 42|CDR-LM|Okay mark it. Get it?||CDR-LM|If not, I'll get it for you.||||Tape 92A/16||||LMP-LM|Mo.||CDR-LM|Here. Let me get it for you.||CDR-LM|Wait a minute. I didn't get it. No, there it is. Okay, I've got it. Okay. We going at the same time I've got us marked.|05 17 49 57|CDR-LM|Okay. PLSS 0^, tone on; 0^ flag. PLSS flag clear 3 to 4 - 3.4. CUFF gauge 3.7 to 4.0.||LMP-LM|Do you need me to watch the panel or you got it?||CDR-LM|No, no sweat I've got that. We'll have to get the PLSS 0^ OFF. I'll get mine; I can reach yours real easy. I can get it in a minute. As soon as we get up I'll get it. Yes, I can reach it, I think, now. And we're going up to HIGH PRESSURE here when we start dumping the cabin.||CDR-LM|I've gone through 3.5 now - 3.4 really.||LMP-LM|Just off the peg here. My press flag didn't clear.||CDR-LM|There's mine.|05 17 51 22|LMP-LM|Turn mine off. Okay. Mark it. It's off.||LMP-LM|Where are you?||CDR-LM|At 385.||LMP-LM|Okay, when you get up, you can turn yours off. Give me a hand, and I'll check the time.|05 17 51 32|CDR-LM|Okay. Mine's off.||LMP-LM|Okay. Check your pressure.||CDR-LM|38. I went at 20, you went at 30.||LMP-LM|It looks like It's a little tighter.||CDR-LM|That was the suit loop we were checking yesterday up in orbit, though.||||||Tape 92A/17||LMP-LM|Yes, but you know we got two tenths.||LMP-LM|Yesterday, too,||LMP-LM|I did.||CDR-LM|I'm coming down 20 more seconds, you got 30 more seconds.||CDR-LM|I’m over about a tenth I guess.|05 17 52 20|CDR-LM|Okay; 1 minute for me Houston; 85 to 7 - about 7-2.||CC|Copy that, Geno.||CDR-LM|Okay.

OVERHEAD FORWARD DUMP valve, OPEN.||LMP-LM|Okay, baby!||LMP-LM|It's open all the way.||CDR-LM|Okay, and pressure's coming down.||LMP-LM|Okay. I believe it.||CDR-LM|I get a tone and an HO flag, and you should pop your RELIEF, I think.||LMP-LM|Yes, I'm at my relief pressure now.||CDR-LM|What's CABIN now?||LMP-LM|Cabin is one - a little 1.2. One.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 92B/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUWD VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|05 17 55 59|CC|See any color tones on that crater at all, Ron?||CMP|Yes, the color on that particular - the color cf that is the same color as you see in Maraldi and as you see in the - the landing site. And that is what I - what I consider the dark - tannish -tannish-gray type of material. And again, the fresh craters around Maraldi still look kind of bluish to me, not as much as they did yesterday, but they still look kind of a - have a bluish tint to them from the reflection of the Sun. In other words, they are fresh craters and they are about the size of - one of them is about the size of MOCR, and the other one is about the size of Sherlock or Camelot.||CC|Okay. You're around Maraldi now ... - -||CMP|... same way. Yes, I'm still on Maraldi. Yes.||CC|Okay - -||CMP|I was on Maraldi, and - -||CC|How about comparing the floor fill of Maraldi to the light plains In Maraldi E?||CMP|The floor fill in Maraldi is definitely a darker color. The light plains in Maraldi E are the -the light-tan material. And Maraldi - The floor of Maraldi looks just like the landing site.||CC|How about the color, tone, and texture of Maraldi Gamma?|05 17 57 44|CMP|Okay. Maraldi Gamma looks just like the rest of all of the surrounding hills around there. I think that's just a - some of the - what do you call it, the Sculptured Hills type of material that has been - was high and has been inundated by mare flow at one time or another. It had - mare flows kind of come up around it.||CC|Okay. How about the domical hills inside of Vitruvius A, as compared to Aitken?||||Tape 92B/2||||CMP|Okay. I just missed that one. We'll have to pet that one on the way by.||CC|Okay.|05 17 58 23|CMP|Next time I guess. Right now, I'm looking at the ridge system around the annulus of Serenitatis. And the dark material stops before you get up to -Oh, what's the crater that sticks into the side of Serenitatis and sticks out beyond the eastern edge of Serenitatis? Anyhow, the dark material stops before you get to there. The dark material only goes up to - let's see - There's a definite rllle. There's a wrinkled ridge and at the east of the wrinkled ridge, there are two craters, about 20 kilometers in diameter. And then farther east of that is the - the rille. A graben, it looks like that goes up - and that's about the extent of the dark area that's the same as the - the same material as the landing site.||CC|Roger. We copy.||CC|Okay, Ron. That - that completes the visuals on this pass. We - if you want to look some more, we've got some time. We do have some Flight Plan camera pads and all that, but no hurry on any of it.||CC|We do have some attitude changes - -||CMP|- - continue looking here until we pass - oh, do you need an attitude change now?||CC|No, that's not until 46. We got some time on that. It's a VERB - change of NOUN 78.||CMP|Okay. Give me a clue about a minute ahead of that,.||CC|Yes, I'll do that, Ron. Just keep talking.|05 18 00 09|CMP|Okay. We're in the Tacquet area now, and in this case, the wrinkled ridge system that's out in the middle does not make a change in the color boundary. The color boundary is completely out to the outer edge and is - in the area of those - the rille. Those are - There's kind of arcuate rilles, straight||||||Tape 92B/3|||rilles, and in the Tacquet, yesterday, I said this was Sulpicius Callus, but it's Tacquet - Tacquet area, but ... - -||CC|Roger, Ron. Can you give us a color difference on the dark mantle and the mare at this Sun angle?|05 18 01 07|CMP|Yes, the color difference - again the - You know, I just - I just now noticed that when I get down at this Sun angle, out in front of me, I got one color, and then I look straight down and I have a different color. But in this Tacquet area, you've definitely got some cinder cone type - No, I don't want to say cinder cone, but anyhow - volcanic. And it almost looks like a breached cinder cone right next to - I think it's Melrose [?] - is the name of that - that crater - the big one that's right on the edge of Serenitatis. I'll find it on the map and mark it for sure. But just to the east of that, it sure looks like a breached cinder cone in - in - in one of those rilles down there. And then that type of material is - is - kind of a dark tan in - at this Sun angle. And it's definitely darker than the - than the Serenitatis Basin material.||CC|I think it's Tacquet is the name of that crater. Isn't it, Ron?||CMP|Tacquet is the little one, and then - then there's a bigger one right next to Tacquet.||CC|Okay. Menelaus is just to the east of Tacquet there.|05 18 03 04|CC|Hey, Ron, I - I blew that. Menelaus is west of Tacquet up there.||CMP|Yes, Menelaus; that's the one.||CC|Any textural difference between the dark mantle in the site and the Sulpicius Callus formation, Ron?||CMP|Yes, there is.||||Tape 92B/4||||CC|Would you attribute it to the actual ground or would you attribute it to possibly the Sun angle difference?||CMP|I think, I would attribute it really to the - to the actual ground. I guess what I am going to have to do is really wait until the Sun angle gets a little bit higher there in that Tacquet region to answer that for sure. But it seems to me like the - the material in the landing site area is -is more smooth, you know, or smoother than what's in the Tacquet region. The part in the Tacquet region seemed to me like it was - is - It's just a rougher-looking-type material. You know, not - not massive. Hey. There's D - D-Caldera. Hey, what do you know?|05 18 05 06|CC|Do you have - do have any dark - do you have any dark halo craters near Sulpicius Gallus?||CMP|Yes. The - I'll be darned.||CC|We're - we're with bated breath, waiting.||CMP|... Picture 28 of D-Caldera with the Hasselblad. I mean with the Nikon (laughter), and Sun angle must be about 1 or 2 degrees.||CC|Roger. We copy.||CMP|You know, I really didn't concentrate too much on - on Sulpicius Gallus at that - that particular passing, I was concentrating on the Tacquet area, and in that - in that case, all of the - the rilles and the ridges - not the wrinkled ridges out in the middle out in there, but the rilles and the area built up around the rilles and also associated maybe - Oh, I was going to say 10 times the will -the rilles width is all one color.||CC|Okay, Ron. We'd like HIGH GAIN to AUTO, and we'd like to load your NOUN 78.|05 18 06 41|CMP|Okay. HIGH GAIN to AUTO. Let me see, 22 NOUN 70 to ENTER. Okay. Let's see, plus 5?.25- Plus 52.25. Up-1ink. VERB 58 ENTER.||||||Tape 92B/5|||... PROCEED to ... gets out of the way. Okay. D-Caldera was taken on picture number 28. It was f/8 at 1/500, and then I took three more before that. They're terminator photos, looking north across Sulpicius Gallus and farther north. And they were 1/500 at f/l6 to start with and then f/11.||CC|Roger, Ron.||CMP|That's probably about all I'm allowed, I think, on this XX film.||CC|What was your last frame number on XX, Ron?||CMP|Yes, that was - I'm on number 29 now.||CC|29- Roger. You're on 29, right here.||CMP|Say, on magazine Oscar Oscar, did we get enough of our required photos out of that, or are the rest of those - opportunity or not?||CC|We'll check on that with FA0, Ron. I do have one Flight Plan update for you on the pan camera photo pad. But you first ought to go to the IMAGE MOTION, INCREASE, barber pole plus four steps, to ON, and LASER ALTIMETER, ON.||CMP|Right now, you mean?||CC|Yes, it's - It's time, Ron. It's time for that.|05 18 09 35|CMP|Okay. IMAGE MOTION - let's see - I think that was barber pole plus three before. There it is, 3 - 4 -|05 18 09 56|CMP|LASER ALTIMETER, ON.||CC|Okay, Ron. That pan camera - -||CMP|I hope to pick up some answers to some of t,hos--.o things on a couple more pasties. Okuy. That's right. Go ahead.||CC|Okay. Did - did it bother you, me - me reading some of those questions to you? I know you'd probably had time to study them, but I thought I'd jog your memory on them.||||Tape 92B/6||||CMP|Oh, no. That's - no, that's good. I appreciate it.||CC|Okay. I'll get a conference here with Farouk before we start the next pass on the next- rev around and see if we can improve it. Things worked perfect down here. We - I had the questions in front of me, and Farouk flipped them into the screen and it really worked great.||CC|Okay, Ron - -||CMP|Yes. That's good, okay.|05 18 10 44|CC|- - at l4l:50, I've got the pan camera photo pad.||CMP|Okay. Ready to copy.|05 18 10 54|CC|Okay. T-start time, 141:54:01; T-stop time, 142:18:24.||CMP|Okay. T-start, 141:54:01; T-stop, l42:l8:2U.||CC|Good show, Ron. It's - your bird now for a while.||CMP|Okay.|05 18 12 37|CC|Ron, just for your information, we're playing back the voice playback from the last rev, and it'll be recorded in house. It is readable, and we can read it.||CMP|Oh, okay. Good. I purposely tried to keep one of the microphones right on my mouth on those things. I don't know if that helps or hinders it .||CC|Roger, Ron - -||CMP|At least I could hear myself talk that way.||CC|Roger. It worked. We can read it, and somebody can listen to it here when we get a chance. How about on this back side of this next rev? Looks like you're pretty busy with some pads and - and some photo work in there. Do you expect to be doing any recording - much recording there?||||||Tape 92B/7||CMP|No, probably not. I'll just try to - try to make notes of it or something, and then pass it on out when I come out the other side.||CC|Good show, Ron. Good show.|05 18 14 07|CC|And your - your grounded friends down there are busy working around the LM right now and doing some loading the Rover and that, getting ready for the EVA-2 work. They're out on the surface and loading the Rover.||CMP|Very good. I'll be glad to - curious to know if they can make it up that hill or not - to Scarp.||CC|Roger.||CMP|Looks like they should be able to go right up that valley, the way they've got it planned there.||CC|Gene's got to take some time here on this EVA and make a fender. We're - we're piecing together a couple of maps and trying to get a fender, because they lost a piece of the fender last night.||CMP|(Laughter) They did, huh?||CC|We're going to give Gene his auto mechanic's license if it works.|05 18 14 57|CMP|How's my - yes, right. How's my ZPN? All I did was move it. I didn't put in a new sensor yet. Do I need to put on a new sensor?|05 18 17 34|CC|Ron, the ZPN data isn't too good. It's the sensor sponges need to be replaced, if you didn't already replace them.||CMP|(Laughter) Thought I'd get by without replacement. Yes, I'll replace them pretty quick.||CC|Hey - you know - your choice. We can - we can stand the crew exercise period without replacing them, I'm sure.||||Tape 92B/8||||CMP|Okay. While I was eating my peanut butter awhile ago, I lost my lobster bisque and my Juice. And I just now found it.|05 18 19 08|CC|Okay, Ron. Here's your word on some magazines here X-ray X-ray has to be left for the Zodiacal light. You - you should not take any more on X-ray X-ray until after Zodiacal light. Mag Oscar Oscar and Papa Papa are yours to play with, as long as you stay with the Flight Plan on the rest of the mags .||CMP|Okay.||CC|And those are your crew options for the rest of the mission, those two mags.||CMP|Okay. In other words, we made it up on Oscar Oscar, I guess, on that one pass, huh? Rest of them are - are crew options.||CC|Roger.|05 18 25 38|CC|Hey, Ron. You got a 110 heart rate. What are you doing?||CMP|(Laughter) Shaking the couch.||CC|(Laughter) I thought we could hear that. That's pretty good.||CMP|Shaking the couch (laughter).|05 18 26 19|CC|Okay. Keep it up, there; you got 120 now. Dr. Berry would like to keep it there for a while.||CMP|(Laughter) I'm getting tired.||CC|That's the whole idea of the thing, Ron.||CMP|(Laughter)|05 18 26 51|CC|Okay. Got you 130 that time.||CMP|Oh.||||||Tape 92B/9|05 18 31 47|CC|Hate to say this, because it's very dead serious work, but I'm kind of watching a lunar comedy as the - the two lunar stalwarts are trying to plan the new fender on the vehicle down there.||CMP|(Laughter) I'll bet that's really no easy job, you know.||CC|That's right. They've got a couple of their clamps - what they did is they - -||CMP|... kind of hard.||CC|They took a couple of their clamps, and they took -taped together in the cockpit a couple of their big lunar maps - the big heavy maps - and they're - now they're clamping that map to the fender where the removable part is.||CMP|Oh, I see. Must be pretty dusty down there or something.|05 18 32 33|CC|Yes. Well, they lost a fender, and it was throwing dust up on Gene. It's just ridiculous how much dust they got on them, so they - they just decided they just had to go ahead and do something.||CMP|Yes.||CC|I would hate to be paying for that fender repair job by the minute.||CMP|(Laughter) Boy, that's for sure.|05 18 39 18|CC|||CMP|Say again, Houston.||CC|Oh, that was me - went off on the wrong loop, - loop there, Ron.||CMP|Oh, okay. (Laught er) Okay.||CMP|On that Crisium Serenitatis - number 4 of 5 - that - dark dome just to the northwest of J-3 - the one I was talking about that had the typical cone-type shape with the dome down in the side of it.||||Tape 92B/10||||CC|Roger. We had It. Farouk had a pointer on it the whole time. I knew just what you were talking at.||CMP|Yes. Okay. Okay.|05 18 40 45|CC|Just talked to the home front a little while ago, and everybody's fine, Ron. And they were able to get the squawk boxes squared away, so she should have been listening to you for last couple of passes - all on the ... The problem was it wasn't able to shut off one loop or the other, so today we've been - they've been able to get all - just the CSM loop in there for - during the AOS periods.||CMP|Oh, I see. Otherwise, they - they were both coming in, huh?||CC|Yes. Last night, they were both coming in. Today, they got it squared away, so you're just coming in, and they are able to watch and listen to the other one on - on the TV camera.||CMP|Yes. TV, yes.||CC|And they say they are looking forward to good weather tomorrow. Supposed to finally get a break in this stuff tomorrow.|05 18 4l 38|CMP|Hey, good. We can say that 's because the guys went to the Moon, see?||CC|Roger. Okay (laughter).||CMP|... get the good break's In the weather (laughter).|05 18 4l 56|CC|About 5 min - 4 and 1/2 minutes to LOS now, Ron. We went around the room, and all systems look good and you're just looking great.||CMP|Okay. Mighty fine, I'm feeling pretty good.||CC|That's great. We noticed your heart rate went up pretty well on the exercise. Looks like you got some exercise, and we'll be seeing you at 142:12.||CMP|42:12. Okay.||||||Tape 92B/11||CC|And we'll be all set up with our backroom for those orb science visuals from Copernicus on down to Reiner Gamma; and you know, ... too, but we'll be up for all - everything in between. So, just standing by for your word.||CMP|Okay.||CC|And Stu's mentioned if you hadn't earlier, that you might try the binoculars when you look at Copernicus for that dike you said - if you hadn't thought of it before.||CMP|Yes. I'm going to try that this time.|05 18 42 54|CC|Okay.

I copy.||||Tape 93A/8||||LMP-EVA|Yes sir.||CDR-EVA|Let me just verify this Jack, and I'll be all done.||LMP-EVA|Okay. You've got it.||CDR-EVA|I'm all done.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Okay, here's your old fender.||CDR-EVA|Now work on that.||LMP-EVA|Shortly.||CDR-EVA|Well, I think I'm going to INTERMEDIATE cooling to start with here.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I think I will, too. Good idea.||CDR-EVA|One zap of cold to see If It's working. It's working, and back to INTERMEDIATE.|05 18 10 48|LMP-EVA|Okay. ... go to mags.||LMP-EVA|Okay; mag.||CDR-EVA|I'll have the same problem with this SRC, I'll bet.||LMP-EVA|Mag Romeo is going to go on the - the old 500 in a minute. Mag India is in there. Mag Kilo, Mag Juliet, Mag Bravo, Mag Delta.|05 18 12 05|CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, the SRC organic sample has been sealed. And the SRC lid is staying almost closed, about 2 or 3 inches open; if that's fine, I'd like to leave that.||CC|Okay. Go ahead and leave it, Gene. If it's not we'll get back with you on it.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I'm going to hit your gravimeter here.||LMP-EVA|Polarizing filter - -||CDR-EVA|Torque it - -||LMP-EVA|- - ... light clamps.||||||Tape 93A/9||CDR-EVA|- - and the light is flashing.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|||CC|Okay. And, Jack, you're getting ready to take care of the charge; remember EP-4 goes within the Rover seat, and EP-5 we're going to put on one of the footpads in the Sun. Probably either the minuz-Z or the minus-Y footpad, whichever is more convenient , probably the minus-Z is. Just as long as it is sitting in the Sun is the important thing on the footpad.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Boy, oh boy. Going to be a - Why won't that come out? Yes, Bob, I'm having a little trouble getting the LCRU battery out. I'll have to - I'll have to go back and use two hands.||CC|Okay. That sounds like a familiar problem.||CDR-EVA|Well, you got any familiar answers?||CC|Someone who's been there before says you just got to work it back and forth until it comes loose.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I can get that, Jack. I've got to - -||LMP-EVA|... hang it up?||CDR-EVA|Yes. I've got to work here anyway.|05 18 15 48|LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob, it's on the minus-Z and the - One corner is facing directly into the Sun.||CC|Okay; copy that.||LMP-EVA|That was - that's EP-5.||CC|Roger that. And I copy number 4 was put - was put between the seat.||LMP-EVA|Yes, it's - a - yes, it's between the seat, or will be very soon.||||Tape 93A/10||||CDR-EVA|Boy, this is ridiculous. Ridiculous.||LMP-EVA|Whoops, I need that other track.||CDR-EVA|Well, it's nothing worth getting upset about it, but it sure makes you start out - But, you shouldn't have to this way.||LMP-EVA|Come on, just don't wear your hands out now.||CDR-EVA|Yes .||CC|Hey, Geno - Geno - -||LMP-EVA|Need a little help?||CDR-EVA|No, I think I can do it, just got to wiggle - -||CC|- ~ jiggle it gently and sort of let it come free there. It's a matter of it wedging itself in, of course, on the parallel rail.||CDR-EVA|Yes. I - I see what's happening, Bob. Still ridiculous.||CC|Okay - -|05 18 17 37|LMP-EVA|Bob, did you hear my comment about the - about the SEP receiver?||CC|Roger. That the blankets won't stay closed. We're talking about that down here.||CDR-EVA|Boy; a bag of peanuts. Whew. Man in space. Without them we'd be lost.||LMP-EVA|Without them we wouldn't have the LCRU and the MESA probably.||CDR-EVA|(Laughter) Manischewitz. Okay. Let me see what I can do for you while I'm here. Okay- LCRU battery under seat, dustbrush to LCRU. Okay. I'll go get that; then I'll get to work.||LMP-EVA|Hey, Bob, what's my shadow length right now?||CC|Stand by. I'll ask. We'll get it for you momentarily.||||||Tape 93A/11||CC|Okay, Jack. We've got 4.5 meters or 15 feet.||LMP-EVA|4.5 meters, huh? 15 feet? Is that how long I am on the ground? No wonder I've misjudged distance. Zap! Hello there, Houston.||CC|Hello there. Okay, Jack. And do we have the new charge transporter on the pallet?||LMP-EVA|I'll say yes, but you could have looked for yourself.||CC|Well, we just looked away.||CDR-EVA|Yes, it's here. It's here, Bob.||CC|Copy that. I won't ask if we got the LCRU battery. That one, I did see.||LMP-EVA|Yes, we got it. You don't think I'd leave it here. Okay, 7-||CDR-EVA|Boy, this gate's working like a charm.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Transfer from 5 to 7* Okay?||CC|Okay and - -|0 5 18 21 22|LMP-EVA|Okay. The pan's complete.||CC|Okay, Jack. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|And, Bob, those pans around here have more pictures because I'm having to be sure I get the massifs -I'm having to take extra pictures.||CC|Okay. Copy that. And I guess we'd suggest that, if you haven't talked about it already, that you work on the fender before you do the geo prep. You don't have your cameras and bags to worry about at that point.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Would that be a good time for Jack to go to the ALSEP, do you think? Or do you think we both have to do this fender?||CC|No. The ALSEP work - we're not going to do until the end of the EVA.||||Tape 93A/12||||CDR-EVA|I heard John's words.||CC|--||CDR-EVA|Okay.||CC|And, Jack, if Gene's working there on unstowing SCB, whatever it is, 5 - yes, 5* Maybe when you put the camera down, you might want to shoot off a few 500-nri.llimeter frames of the North and South Massifs, if they look interesting. I - I can't tell from the TV. That might be an opportune time to grab a couple.||LMP-EVA|If they look interesting! If they look interesting! Wow what kind of thing is that to say?||CC|Then, when Gene gets done configuring that SCB-5 , we'd like to get on with the fender fix. Then, we'll do the geo prep after that.|05 18 22 55|CDR|We'll get on with it, Bob.||CDR-EVA|My gosh, we got a lot of loose stuff in SCB-7*||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. I got three core tubes - well, wait a minute - only got one core cap dispenser. Let me get the other one. Okay. Well, it's all on wide. Okay; three core tubes, two 20-bag dispensers, one ca - that's one core cap dispenser, and a short can.||CC|Okay. Copy that, Geno.||CDR-EVA|Jack - -||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|- - Are you ready to work? See this right here?||LMP-EVA|Yes .||CDR-EVA|I'm going to put that right - there.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Are you ready to work?||||||Tape 93A/13||CDR-EVA|Just let me turn my page here. ... Stand by. Okay; I already got one on the gate. That didn't c ount.|05 18 24 52|CDR-EVA|Okay. Want a couple 20-bag dispensers?||LMP-EVA|Well, I - Okay, - waiting for you to -||CDR-EVA|Well, let's get this done.||LMP-EVA|You want to -||CDR-EVA|Here.||LMP-EVA|Well, what are you doing now?||CDR-EVA|I was just getting this gear out now ... to work on the fender.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|I'm not to geo prep yet.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Here you are.||LMP-EVA|Wait a minute.||CDR-EVA|We'll just set these here.||LMP-EVA|And there's another one.||CDR-EVA|Okay; SCB-7 goes under your seat.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I'll get that. The camera has the - bags on it. You might - just put it there, and I'll come over and get those maps and everything.||CDR-EVA|Okay. That goes under your seat. Let me get 4 -Okay, we got 4 and 6. I'm going to start on a -We got SCB-4, goes to you, and SCB-6 goes on the gate yet Jack, but let's pick that up with geo prep, and let me get that fender gear. Where's the -||LMP-EVA|It's in your seat pan.||CDR-EVA|In my seat pan? Okay.||||Tape 93A/14||||LMP-EVA|I should have put it over here. That was just where it ended up.||CDR-EVA|You already used the 500?||LMP-EVA|No, I didn't get a chance to.||CDR-EVA|Okay. You might do it while I try the fender, and then you're here to help me in case I need it.||LMP-EVA|No, it's all - all your stuff's right there, Gene.||CDR-EVA|Oh, okay. I see it. Well, let's hope it does the job.|05 18 27 19|LMP-EVA|Okay, SCB-7's in my seat. And I put the return-to-LM map in there, too; it's just going to be in the way anywhere else.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Let me check something, though. On the way to -the Hole-in-the-Wall, we want to drive ...||CC|... notch||CDR-EVA|Okay. Hope this thing gets stiff. It's just a flapper. Sure isn't stiff like I want it to be.||LMP-EVA|You want me to hold it there?||CDR-EVA|Yes, you're going to have to, I reckon. But, that may do the job. Let's see, does it come over the -I want it about right above the axle - let me -move your hand a minute. Let me align it. Okay. Hold it right there. Let me get the -||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Let me move it up just a little bit. Right there. Okay. Hold it right there. Let me see how much room I've got coining out. I want to turn this around. We can tape that other end, Jack. There you go.|05 18 28 42|LMP-EVA|It's tending to fold a little bit -||||||Tape 93A/15||CDR-EVA|I think - Yes, but the dust will be coming up from under us. Let's see.||LMP-EVA|Temperature; I think is making it fold.||CDR-EVA|How, that'll give us plenty of room down there, that - Yes, I just don't want to interfere with the steering.||LMP-EVA|You think - you think that'll stop the dust that way?||CDR-EVA|Well, it'll stop some of it if it stays on.||LMP-EVA|Well, what I mean, it's not projecting outward at all. It's curling back under.||CDR-EVA|Well, when I - when I put a clamp here, and a clamp here, see what will happen.||LMP-EVA|Oh, okay.||LMP-EVA|Is that about how - where you want it?||LMP-EVA|Lean against me, if you need to.||CDR-EVA|Trying to figure out - No, I've got to clamp it right in that rail; it's not much to clamp it on the inside.||LMP-EVA|No. Keep the knob up. There, you got it.||CDR-EVA|Hold it right there. We got it all folded up on this side?||LMP-EVA|Why don't you try the outside.||CDR-EVA|Let it go a minute. Okay.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Why don't you try the outside, first?||CC|Fix it inside first; probably be better, guys.||LMP-EVA|Got enough overlap there.||CDR-EVA|No, I want a little more.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||||Tape 93A/16||||CDR-EVA|And, I am going to try this side because I can get my overlap over here.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Wow, hold it right there while I clamp it down.||CDR-EVA|No, that paper isn't going to come off, and the clamp's not going to come off, I'll say that. I don't know how much we're going to get out of the fender bat -||LMP-EVA|Okay, that's ~ fixed?||CDR-EVA|Yes .||LMP-EVA|Can you fix that at all?||CDR-EVA|Yes *||LMP-EVA|That ought to give us a little strengthening, stiffening.||CDR-EVA|Yes .||LMP-EVA|. . . tight?||CDR-EVA|Yes. Tighter for the road. I don't want to lose that. Man, that's tight. Now, let's see if I can get this one. Jack, why don't you come on this side and hold the fender down right there. Hold it right about there.||LMP-EVA|Okay. You want to get it outboard a little more -I mean aft?||CDR-EVA|No, 1 want to keep it above this - this center -The - the hub here.||LMP-EVA|Yes , Okay.||CDR-EVA|For steering purposes. See this - -||LMP-EVA|Is that - is that fixed for the - well -||CDR-EVA|I'll take a look at it. I'm going to tighten it down so it stays, then I'm going to take a look at it. I might turn this thing down too.||||||Tape 93A/17||LMP-EVA|Yes. I was just going to suggest that.|05 18 32 15|CDR-EVA|Let me take a look before I get it too tight. Well, I'll tell you, that's going to help some.||LMP-EVA|Yes. It may do the trick.||CDR-EVA|I can't see what's under this rail too well, but I know that clamp is on. It's on tight.||LMP-EVA|Gene, it looks -||CDR-EVA|Let me move this -||LMP-EVA|Move your left hand a little. Okay. Tighten that now.||CDR-EVA|Get this out of the way.||LMP-EVA|Looks as if -||CDR-EVA|Let me loosen it, and get it a little straighter.||LMP-EVA|Yes, I think you need to straighten it.||CDR-EVA|Well, I had it tight.||LMP-EVA|Yes, but you know you've got another piece in there so -||CDR-EVA|Yes, yes, that's why it's crooked, it's over those pieces,||LMP-EVA|Yes. Well, you might want to move it - if you could move it this way about a - an inch, you'd be past the ridge you got.||CDR-EVA|Well, I'm just taking John's word on the steering. I - I--||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|- - keeping above the hub here.||LMP-EVA|Okay, tighten her down then.||LMP-EVA|I think that'll stay.||CDR-EVA|I think it'll stay.||||Tape 93A/18||||LMP-EVA|Why don't I turn this one - -||CDR-EVA|Okay. You won't get that any tighter.||LMP-EVA|Ho, I mean, why don't I turn that down because it'll keep - that much less to run into. There you go.||CDR-EVA|No, not too close to that wheel.||LMP-EVA|Okay? I think that's good.||CDR-EVA|Too bad we don't have one more clamp - well, one more clamp would probably interfere with the steering.||LMP-EVA|I think that'll stop the rooster tail, because that' s - -||CDR-EVA|I think that'll stop a lot of it, Houston.||LMP-EVA|- - that's swinging forward. Okay. Let's go.||CC|Okay. It's - -|05 18 33 59|CDR-EVA|The maps are configured.||CC|- - That sounds like a good attempt, men. We'll hope it works.||CDR-EVA|Does that look - does that look good to John, from what he did.||CC|It looks exactly what his did, he says.||LMP-EVA|That tape will keep it -||CDR-EVA|Yes, but he didn't run in the dust, so I guess we'll have to give it a trial run.||CC|Roger on that.||CDR-EVA|That ought to help some - -||CC|We're anxiously waiting.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Jack. Let's -I'm going to HIGH for a little bit. Okay. I need S ~ S - oh, shoot. Wow, I want 14.||||||Tape 93A/19||LMP-EVA|I took 8 off.||CDR-EVA|Wo, sir. I want 4 and 6. Why don't you just substitute - -||LMP-EVA|Hey, I just took 8 off. Can we use 8 instead of 6?||CDR-EVA|Yes, we can.||CC|Yes, I don't see there's any reason why you shouldn't be able to use that, Jack. Go ahead. We'll just mark it down.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Turn around, Jack. Hey, Bob, we'll use 8 instead of 4.||CC|Okay. Understand 8 will be on the - -||CDR-EVA|8 instead of 4.||CC|- - 8 will be on the LMP.||CDR-EVA|That's affirm; 8 will be on the LMP.||CC|Geno, you went to MIN instead of MAX.||CDR-EVA|I think you're right. I just realized that.||LMP-EVA|Got it.||CDR-EVA|Yes, let me go to MAX here for a minute.||CDR-EVA|We need 6 off of there, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Oh, your 5 stays back here, huh?||CDR-EVA|We need - we need - we need 6 to the gate.||LMP-EVA|It's probably behind 4, isn't it.||CDR-EVA|Veil - -||CC|Well, put 4 on the gate - -||CDR-EVA|Yes .||LMP-EVA|Probably.||||Tape 93A/20||||CC|- - then put 5 on the commander.||CDR-EVA|Yes. Okay, 4 is going on the gate and 5 on the commander.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob, a little paperwork for you, but that's all right, Okay.|05 18 36 00|CDR-EVA|Now, I got to do some more stowing on you when you get that on.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay. They're in the -||LMP-EVA|Where do you want me?||CDR-EVA|Your left side.||LMP-EVA|Anywhere - Which way are you going to turn?||CDR-EVA|Oh, man, does that - that Velcro get tough.||LMP-EVA|Here you've got a core cap dispenser.||CDR-EVA|Stand by; let me fix these for you while I'm here. Okay. Here's your doffing harness on this side. Don't move yet, I've got to - I've got something I've got to do to you.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay, okay. Turn around, I'll get your harness on the other side.||LMP-EVA|Let me get yours too.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Okay, there you go. Okay, you've got a cap dispenser, you've got a rammer, and you've got -well, I guess SCB-8, if I'm not mistaken.||LMP-EVA|Yes, that's all right, they got it. Okay. That.';; 1||CDR-EVA|Okay. You can give me SCB-5 then, and -||LMP-EVA|Yes. Can you move - move a little bit? There you go. Okay. There you are.||||||Tape 93A/21||CDR-EVA|You got it?||LMP-EVA|No - no, I'm sorry. In fact, I've got to tighten up your -||CDR-EVA|We've got to take a picture of that fender if it works.||LMP-EVA|Wait a minute -No, if you weren't so tall - and you - you are always saying - you just invariably stand so 1 have to get in a hole. Okay. Now let me tighten up your whole shooting match here. It's loose again. Hang on. Okay. Between Velcro and snaps, the world could never fall apart.||CDR-EVA|Okay, all set?|05 18 39 00|LMP-EVA|You're set.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I'm going to get a hammer, and then I'll get the TGE.||LMP-EVA|I'm going to get my camera, and I'll go to the SEP site.||CC|Okay. Why don't you start to the SEP site - -||CDR-EVA|Hey, Jack, when you start running - -||CC|- - and, also, I presume that the dustbrush is on the Rover now.||CDR-EVA|It is .||CC|Okay. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|It is. Jack, when I drive out there why don't you watch the rear wheel.||LMP-EVA|I will. Give me a yell when you start to drive.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Both the steering and the rooster tail -Oh, I hope it's not all zeros. Okay, Bob. 670, 017, 701; 670, 017, 701.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||||Tape 93A/22|||05 18 39 53|CDR-EVA|Okay; and the SCB is good. It's closed. It's in the shade. The rest ... I guess.||CC|Okay. And, Jack, when you get out to the SEP site, you might give us a reading on what the solar panels look like - how they survived the night with the tape on them.||LMP-EVA|I wouldn't think of not doing that. I'm curious myself.|05 18 40 32|CDR-EVA|Okay. The TGE is on the LRV.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I'm making an inventory. I've got the LCRU battery. Okay. We got 1, 3 and 2 and 8; LCRU blankets are open 100 percent. Battery covers are CLOSED. Dustbrush is on the LCRU. TGE is on the Rover. Jack, can you verify we got the right mags and a polar filter? Polarization.||LMP-EVA|Yes sir. I verified that.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Very good.||LMP-EVA|You better put that 500 back under the seat.||CDR-EVA|Yes. That's where it's going.||LMP-EVA|Well, Bob, It looks like - it survived. There is a - as I stand behind the panels - the left-hand panel may be tilted at about - well, less than 5 degrees, probably about 2 or 3, but that's all. Looks pretty good right now.||CC|Okay; beautiful. Thank you. Good fix.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, I'm going to take the TV from you.||CC|Okay. Copy that, Geno.|05 18 41 36|LMP-EVA|And the transmitter's going on.||CC|Copy that, Jack.||||||Tape 93A/23||LMP-EVA|(Laughter) If I can do it without destroying it.||CDR-EVA|Yes. That's hard to do out there, Jack. Okay. TV camera going POSITION 1.||LMP-EVA|Transmitter's on and - ... fix the level there. Okay. The level is on the inner ring again. And -well, the gnomon has moved a little bit, but not much. But you would expect that, I guess.||CC|Yes . Seeing the other end of the gnomon up there in the sky it's moved a little bit.||LMP-EVA|Yes. That's what I said.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Camera, tongs, and I'll drive. West leg, heading 270.||LMP-EVA|Camera is on. Bob, I'm on * I guess 26.||CC|Okay. Copy - -||LMP-EVA|This here's frame 27, mag Charlie.||CC|Copy that. Charlie 26 - 2J.||LMP-EVA|I had to relearn how to document samples, Bob. I just have. The first part of my roll will have a lot of random exposures and focuses.||LMP-EVA|Okay. We're back in business. And I'm - while I'm waiting for Gene, getting a rock - it looks a little finer grained than the others we've seen in the LRV sampler, along with some soil. And that's done. Hey, that's a neat sampler. Only way to flv. Okay, and that's in bag 22E. It has the stereo documentation and a locator to the LM, and it's about 2 meters from the S - from the SEP.||CC|Okay, Jack.|05 18 44 02|LMP-EVA|22 Echo.||CC|Roger. Copy that. Did you ever find any sign of that brown fine-grained rock you saw on the way out to the SEP yesterday?||||Tape 93A/24||||CDR-EVA|Bob, let me give you some readings, so I can get going.||CC|Okay. Go ahead, Geno.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Amp hours, 108, 100; volts are 68, 68; batteries are 80 and 102; and motors are all off scale low. I'm on the way. On the way, Jack.||LMP-EVA|I'm waiting.||CDR-EVA|Oh, there you are over there, huh?||CC|And, Jack, how's the rooster tail look on that fender?||LMP-EVA|Looks like it's going backwards. I don't see any coming up over the top. Looks like a good fix.||CC|Beautiful.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Jack, I got to come around - I'm going to come on this side and head west.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Watch for - You got the antennas?||CDR-EVA|I've got one over here.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I'll - give you a line on the other one.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I'm getting close.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Turn.||CDR-EVA|Where is it?||LMP-EVA|Right here. I'm on it.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Okay. And I see the other one - let me parallel that line.||CC|Low gain, Gene, please; after you get stopped.||CDR-EVA|I guess that's about 2 or 3 meters, huh, Jack? You can better see where it - is at.||||||Tape 93A/25||LMP-EVA|Yes, that's good, Geno.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Heading 270.||LMP-EVA|You want to - -||CDR-EVA|Am I 10 meters from the transmitter?||LMP-EVA|Probably not, huh? You're pretty - no, you need to go about 5 meters.||CDR-EVA|How far am I? See if it's okay.||LMP-EVA|You're about 3 meters - 4 meters.||CDR-EVA|Hey, Bob, I'm 3 meters to the west of the transmitter and about 2-1/2 meters south of the line going west - -||CC|There's no problem there, Gene.||CDR-EVA|- - Is that okay?||CC|Don't move. It's just they had to be less than those numbers.|05 18 47 05|CDR-EVA|Okay. That's where I am.||LMP-EVA|I'm getting your photos.||CDR-EVA|Okay; and let me give them a voltage reading, and I'm still reading 68 and 68.||CC|Okay; copy that. We don't need those, we just got them. And - -||CDR-EVA|I know, I just wanted to keep you on it.||CC|- - give me the nav numbers. And give us some nav numbers.||CDR-EVA|Okay. 265, 0.2, and 0.1.||CC|The - that heading - we want heading, pitch, roll, and sun dial there, Gene.||||Tape 93A/26||||CDR-EVA|Okay. I'm sorry. Bob. Okay; you want a nav update here?||CC|Nav initialized, Geno.||CDR-EVA|Yes , sir; you do.||CC|Roger,||CDR-EVA|Yes, sir; I'm sorry.||CC|Go to the next page.||LMP-EVA|Let me - let me change my position here, just a sukosh. Let me change my position a sukosh.||CDR-EVA|I knew you'd - Bob, what was that last LRV sample number I gave you?||CC|22 Echo, 22 Echo.|05 18 48 24|LMP-EVA|23 Echo, if that followed in sequence, is another rock about - near the SEP documented in the same way.||CC|Okay; copy that.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. 265 - 265, 0.3, 0.1; roll is 1 right, pitch is 0, and the sun shaft device is 0. I'm heading 281 degrees.||CC|Okay; copy that. Stand by.|05 18 48 56|LMP-EVA|Okay. The recorder is ON - -||CC|Copy that,||LMP-EVA|- - and the RECEIVE POWER switch is on.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|And, I guess you're going to hand me EP-4. Get rid of this.||||||Tape 93A/27||CC|Okay. 282 is the preferred but that's too small to bother torquing, Gene; you're good as is. We're ready for you guys to go.||CDR-EVA|Okay. That looks good because I have to come left just a sukosh there to proceed parallel down the west line.||CC|Okay. We're ready for you guys to go. We presume you have the SEP photos, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Yes, I do.||CC|Okay. And get your frame - we don't need - you can give us a frame count if you want. Remember to pick up EP-4 when you get in the Rover.||LMP-EVA|Okay. We got it, and the frame count is 17-||CC|Copy 17 for the LMP, and we need a nav reset to verify there, Gene.||CDR-EVA|I did nav reset; I'm reading all balls.||CC|Okay. And did you happen to check the - -||CDR-EVA|And it is back off.||CC|- - SEP temperature when you turned it on, Gene”? Jack? The receiver?||LMP-EVA|No. I didn't; I didn't. Doubt if it changed much since I called you.||CC|Okay. We'll catch it at station 2.||CC|Okay. Low gain - -||CDR-EVA|Okay, Jack, we got transmitter and receiver both on, huh?||CC|- - antenna is 240 and we're ready for you guys to leave.||CC|Give us a mark on the leave.||||Tape 93A/28||||CDR-EVA|Okay. Here you go, Jack; we need - The SEP antenna an! receiver - receiver and transmitter, both on, huh?||LMP-EVA|Yes, sir.||CDR-EVA|Okay, . . „---||CC|Okay. And, Gene, remember we want a mark when you pass the end of the antenna.||CDR-EVA|Okay,||LMP-EVA|Can drive fairly slowly, huh?||CDR-EVA|Yes, until I get past the end. I got to get my heading changed about 10 degrees to parallel. We're still in the same relative position, Bob.||CC|Okay. Very good.||CDR-EVA|Okay.|05 18 51 04|CDR-EVA|Okay. We are moving right now.||CC|Oka;/. We're marking that.||CDR-EVA|Slowly. Okay, Stand by, Bob.|05 18 51 43|CDR-EVA|MARK it,||CC|Okay. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Okay, We want to go past ... at heading 260, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Well. we want tc get at 080 and 0.4 and get rid of this charge,||CDR-EVA|Okay. ... - -||LMP-EVA|Yes. I want to ... - -||CC|Okay, 170 a couple of words there as you drive along. Let me give them to you early here. One, we didn't bother 'go change all the numbers on the checklist, but, by and large, because we think||||||Tape 93A/29|||we're 200 meters east of where we were, you should probably increase all those numbers except for the explosive package numbers by about two-tenths to get the distance at which you will come across these areas. Again it's about 0.4, 0.5, and we expect to deploy EP-4. The more important number though is that it's 0.2 west of the ALSEP. As you pass the ALSEP, you might know what the range and distance are reading at that point.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Range - range is the one that changes - on No, wait a minute, that -||CDR-EVA|I got it.||LMP-EVA|I'll get it. Which is it? Range changes every half - on the half kilometer.||CDR-EVA|Yes .||LMP-EVA|Distance.||CC|Roger, Jack. The range is - -||CDR-EVA|... go around ... ~ -||CC|What changes in the middle at 0.50 meters and 150 meters.||LMP-EVA|Okay. We - The fender fix is working so far.||CC|Beautiful.||CDR-EVA|Let me get around your flag. There's your flag way out there, isn't it?||LMP-EVA|Yes .||CDR-EVA|Let me get around that. Man - That's really giving the ALSEP some room.||LMP-EVA|Yes. Okay, Bob. We're still seeing - the light-colored gabbroic rocks. I think the reason T said 50 percent was because in this light they look light-colored, and that's probably largely because of the zap pit halos.||CC|Okay. I copy that, Jack.||||Tape 93A/30||||LMP-EVA|But, in the ..., it looked like the standard -standard gabbro.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|And, Bob, I'm -I'm full out at about 11 - -||LMP-EVA|Okay, you can ~ you can turn right, now.||CDR-EVA|I'm full out at about 11 clicks right now.||CC|Beautiful.||CDR-EVA|Oops. ... (Laughter)||CC|You can give me a call as you pass by the ALSEP as you get ready to deploy the charge, please.||CDR-EVA|Okay. We're almost due south of the ALSEP now.||CC|Okay - -||CDR-EVA|... that. I've got to work my way through here.||CC|- - copy that. Go about 0.2 kilometers further than that,||LMP-EVA|It's a little rocky out here.||CDR-EVA|Yes , it sure is.||LMP-EVA|Every - In the area we are now - you get a distance that was -||CDR-EVA|Okay. We just clicked to 4. I want to move over this way just a sukosh.||LMP-EVA|Yes .||CDR-EVA|Okay, I can -I'm just south of my geophone 2 flag now.||CC|Okay. If you just clicked to 4, let's go to 6 then, just past the click on 6.||LMP-EVA|Okay. And you want about 080?||||||Tape 93A/31||CDR-EVA|Plenty good enough. I got to start heading right out here, right toward my ~ upper graphic - -||LMP-EVA|Okay. Hole-in-the-Wall should be just to the left of the notch.||CDR-EVA|Yes. That's exactly where I'm heading.||LMP-EVA|And I think we're coming up closer to the rim of camelot. It's starting to look like a crater now.||CC|Okay; very good.|05 18 55 00|LMP-EVA|Looking down-Sun, I see no major albedo changes except for the very fresh craters which are brighter. By a few - by a - maybe 20 percent. The surface - -||CDR-EVA|How are we doing.||LMP-EVA|5-||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. Here's your charge. Pick a spot, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Okay; can you swing right out over there - -||CDR-EVA|Yes .||LMP-EVA|- - about 10 meters ahead?||LMP-EVA|Okay. Give me a shallow turn.||CDR-EVA|How's that?||LMP-EVA|Okay. And I'll set it right there on that - in that - Can you move forward, and I'll get it in that little depression.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|You see on the other side of the rock.||CDR-EVA|Yes .||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob; 083, 0.6, and 0.5.||||Tape 93A/32||||CC|Okay. Copy that.|05 18 55 57|LMP-EVA|Okay. Pin 1, pulled and safe; Pin 2 is pulled and safe; Pin 3, pulled and safe. Ever stop and ask yourself what I'm doing.||CC|I copy that, Jack - -||CDR-EVA|Yes (laughter).||CC|- - if you can give us a frame count, we'd appreciate it. And I might remind you two to both check that - -||CDR-EVA|Don't fall over.||CC|- - you're at MIN cooling since you've got a long drive ahead of you there.||LMP-EVA|Hey, I lost my sample thing.||CDR-EVA|Threw it in the floor?||LMP-EVA|I hope so.|05 18 56 43|CDR-EVA|That look good?||LMP-EVA|Yes, it's going to stay.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Have you got anything to ... If not, I'll do a partial for you.||LMP-EVA|Yes. We got to do a partial. I'd like to know where that sampler is. Well, we can do without it, I guess.||CDR-EVA|Yes. Sure be nice to - What did it do; come off the end?||LMP-EVA|Yes, I think I can check it though.||CDR-EVA|Get your pan?||LMP-EVA|Yes. If you go around to - to seeing that big block there by the ALSEP, then you can - Forget It.||||||Tape 93A/33||CDR-EVA|Okay. Okay. I'll just come on around, and I'll pick up my tracks. Do you want to get that sampler? Can you see it?||LMP-EVA|I think I'd better look.||CDR-EVA|All right. Take a look. Bob, one stop here for about 2 seconds.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Okay. It's down there.||CDR-EVA|Why don't you put it on real quick and -||LMP-EVA|I don't know why - It was hard to put on. Surprised it came off. Here let me - let me hold the end.||CDR-EVA|You got to - got them retracted?||LMP-EVA|Retracted.||CDR-EVA|They'll retract. And let me know when.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Okay. It's - it's loose.||CDR-EVA|Retracted. You want it - how you want it?||LMP-EVA|Retract it again.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Retract it.||LMP-EVA|No - Let go, let go - no, it's just hooking.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Try it - push it in once more.||LMP-EVA|Okay. The best I can do. I'll just lock - I'll twist it down on there and maybe it'll hold.|05 18 58 20|CDR-EVA|Okay. Twist it tight. I got the rod.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I'll just have to be careful. Okay. I've got it.||CDR-EVA|Okay . Oh - oh.||||Tape 93A/34||||LMP-EVA|I've got it.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|You don't have to put it in - push down.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Okay. Let's go. Every time you pick your seatbelt up ... It's untwisted now.||CDR-EVA|Okay?||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|All set?||LMP-EVA|Just about.||CC|Okay, Jack, a reminder. We're still seeing you in intermediate. You probably will want to go to min before you get back on.||CDR-EVA|He's back on now.||LMP-EVA|And we're rolling.|05 18 59 22|CC|Okay, copy. You're moving.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Let's go to Hole-in-the-Wall. Yes, sir.||CC|Okay. One other thing I might mention to you guys as you're driving here, Jack, before you start talking again, is that - as you go by Camelot, you might keep an eye out for blocks along the rim there, because remember - we may be wanting to come back and move station 5 to an area where there's blocks, unless there are blocks at the present nominal station 5- So you might keep an eye for that and plan for the way back. A second thing a reminder, if you do stop for a Rover sample or one thing or another along the way, give us a call and keep us informed, because we're timing you on the way out and the assumption is, of course, that driving time out equals drive-back time. And we're under a 63-minute limit to get you from the LM out to the station 2 because of OPS drive back. So, keep us informed so we can keep a good tab.||||||Tape 93A/35||LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob. Okay. We'll keep you informed.||CDR-EVA|Bob, I got the thing tube-locked, and I'm averaging probably 10 to 11 clicks. It's not exactly straight-line navigation, but I think I can hold most of it.||CC|Roger. Beautiful.||LMP-EVA|Watch the crater - there you go.||CC|And, Jack, a reminder - -||LMP-EVA|I tell you, when Gene decides to turn - whoo!||CC|And, Jack, a reminder on photos yesterday. You apparently took quite a few on the way back from station 1 to the SEP, and we're right nominal on budget now. But, considering the fact that we didn't do much sampling if you continue to use them at the rate you did yesterday coming back from station 1, at least as we understand it, you'll be pushing us pretty hard in the budget. Should be every 50 meters or every 100 meters.||LMP-EVA|Bob, okay. And you want to hear something?||CC|Roger. I'll listen now.||LMP-EVA|Okay. The surface is not changing in terms of the detail. The surface texture of the finegrained regolith still is - has a raindrop pattern. We're more - the blocks still look very much like what we sampled yesterday around the LM. They're light colored, apparently gabbros , with zap pits -zap halos. Occasional craters show lighter colored ejectas both all the way down to - say half a meter in size. Other craters that are just as blocky as those with bright halos have no brightness associated with them. Most of the brightest craters have a little central pit in the bottom which is glass lined. The pit is maybe - a fifth of the diameter of the crater itself. It's a fairly standard thing for most of these fresher craters, is that little central pit.||||Tape 93A/36|||05 19 02 20|CDR-EVA|Okay, we're just south of the rim of Camelot. There is a light mantle on the other side. Look at that crater. Whoo!||LMP-EVA|We've got the ... - oh, and there's Camelot.||CDR-EVA|Oh, Whoo! Manischewitz. Take a couple of pictures looking at that.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Can you swing a little?||CDR-EVA|Yes .|05 19 02 36|LMP-EVA|Okay, I got them.||CDR-EVA|That is a 600-meter crater.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I - I - -||CDR-EVA|And it is very likely we won't have any problem finding blocks on the rim of Camelot.||CC|Hey, how about a bearing and range there to help us pick out the LM ... Roger. How about bearing and range to help us pick out the LM location.|05 19 02 50|CDR-EVA|Okay. 08, 31.2, and 1.0.||CC|Okay. Thank you. Thank you.||LMP-EVA|Bob, listen -||LMP-EVA|Okay. There's a little -||CDR-EVA|Man, are there blocks there.||LMP-EVA|Now that - little crater in the ejecta did not -of Camelot, at least the .rim of Camelot, did not bring up blocks on the rim. It may have been an old depression. Bob, there is extremely blocky area. This would - I think station 5 was over there where that block area is. The light-colored areas on the photos are essentially - blocky. They're probably 30 percent blocks. All of them are in the - many of them are in the 2- to 3- to 4-meter size range. All of them look light colored, look like the gabbro we sampled from||||||Tape 93A/37|||a distance. They have light-halo zap pits on them I see only occasional grayer varieties, which I believe are the nonvesicular ones like we also sampled.||CC|Okay. Copy that, Jack. Very good.||LMP-EVA|But the light-colored gabbros are dominant.||CC|Thank you.||LMP-EVA|Okay- Station 5 would have been - rather than in a light-colored area would have been in a very blocky area. Station 5 is probably still very good for blocks.||CC|Okay. Thank you.||LMP-EVA|There is probably as big blocks there as anywhere on the rim that we've seen.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Okay. We ought to be going be - really between Horatio and Camelot now.||CDR-EVA|No. I'm going to give them a call when we're due south of Camelot and see if they can't get a position on us .||CDR-EVA|Hold it, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Ooh, watch it.||CDR-EVA|Hold it; hold it.||LMP-EVA|You can go around that one.||CDR-EVA|You bet you (laughter). Whoo! That slowed the speed up a little bit.||CDR-EVA|You can unwrinkle your toes now. Okay.||||Tape 93A/38||||LMP-EVA|Oh. I wasn't worried, Gene. Watch that block there; it's probably more than 14 inches. And got a fairly close look at the rock, and it is the vesicular - looks very much like the vesicular clinopyroxene gabbro.||CC|Thank you.||LMP-EVA|How, the surface of Camelot is mantled - or the rim - is mantled with the same dark-gray material, and it has the same surface texture - a very fine raindrop pattern. The saturation crater size does not look bigger than a half a meter, if that.|05 19 05 30|CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, I'm going to give you 0 8l, 1.6, and 1.4. We're south of the center of Camelot.||CC|Okay. Thank you, Gene.||LMP-EVA|One crater - Okay. We ought to see Horatio here pretty quick. I think it's right up in front of us,||CDR-EVA|Yes, I think you're right.|05 19 05 52|CDR-EVA|We can definitely see the light mantle as it comes out over the valley here, and we're looking at Hole-in-the-Wall, although it's still too subtle. We're looking right at Lara, as a matter of fact.||LMP-EVA|Yes. There's Lara, very clear; and Hole-in-the-Wall, you can see it.||CDR-EVA|Yes, yes.||LMP-EVA|Yes.|05 19 06 09|CDR-EVA|There's Horatio way over there where those blocks are. See It?||LMP-EVA|Yes, that's Horatio. We're right on course, sir. There's a little depression we didn't talk about, though, between Horatio and Camelot. But it's a depression and not a blocky crater at all. As a matter of fact, the total block population has changed out on the - once we get away from the rim of Camelot the block frequency is quite a bit smaller. It's down - maybe to only - less than 1 percent of the surface.||||||Tape 93A/39||CDR-EVA|Much easier driving with the Rover. Boy, am I glad we got that fender on. Very obvious that the Rover navigation - because of the blocks and because of the smaller ... craters, and very subtle type craters are in this area.||LMP-EVA|There are up to 2-meter, bright-halo, blocky craters - and that's blocky wall craters that may be incident rock rather than - I think it is rather than bedrock - in the rim area of Camelot.|05 19 07 27|CDR-EVA|Horatio has got to be - there's Horatio, right there.||LMP-EVA|Yes. That's Horatio.||CDR-EVA|Let me give another mark on the southern rim of Horatio,||LMP-EVA|Okay. The scarp looks very smooth from here -no obvious outcrops at this time. Don't seem to be penetrating to any bedrock in the area we're traversing now, just to the southeast of Horatio. Horatio has a blocky wall; however, the upper several tens of meters, probably, of rim look as if it's either mantled or composed of - the light-gray regolith material we've been driving on. The blocks do not come to the rim of Horatio.||CC|Okay. Copy that, Jack.||CDR-EVA|- - know if I want to take you down there or not. Yes, Jack, hold on ... you down there.||LMP-EVA|Horatio has quite a different appearance than Camelot. It is - and that's the main one - the rims - the blocks do not get to the rim.||LMP-EVA|What's your roll? (Laughter) I know it's not much, but it seems like a lot.||CDR-EVA|... go around that crater.||LMP-EVA|Yes. The - It looks like - if Horatio is any gage, the rim thickness of maybe, and this is a wild guess, Bob, but maybe an average of 20 or 30 meters stratigraphic thickness lies above the exposures||||Tape 93A/40|||||of the subfloor; exposures being blocks in the wall. And some of those blocks, again, are several meters, if not 5 to 10 meters in diameter. And they're concentrated on the west rim that I can see. There are very few blocks on the east -excuse me, the west wall - there are very few blocks on the east, north, and south walls of Horatio.||CC|Copy that, J ack.|05 19 09 4l|CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. We're on the southern rim; 078, 2.3, and 2.0.||LMP-EVA|Yes. We're maybe 100 meters south of the rim. Actually, we're on the rim crest. We're 100 meters south of the break in slope into the crater.||CDR-EVA|There's a lot of - it's an undulating, hummocky traverse terrain in there, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Yes .||CDR-EVA|These little craters make it bumpy; but, other than that, it's really smooth sailing.||LMP-EVA|That's right. This is what I sort of expected d&rk mantle to look like, rather than what we landed on. Hot more than 1 percent of the surface, and that - and that percentage continues right over the rim crest of Horatio down onto the wall until you hit the big blocks.|05 19 10 24|CDR-EVA|?What's this depression? That's not - No, we're not to Bronte yet.||LMP-EVA|No3 I don't have any - No, we're not at Bronte -||CC|Okay, 17. And how about an amps and a mobility -a speed reading.|05 19 10 38|CDR-EVA|I've been pushing aywhere from 9 to 11 clicks, and most of the time that's full out, and anperes are bouncing around 100 apiece.||LMP-EVA|Hey, watch these down-Sun craters. They're hard to see.||||||Tape 93A/4l||CDR-EVA|I know they are. We're climbing, Jack. Because I've been full bore most of the time, and all I can get out of it is 10 clicks; and when I decelerate, she decelerates in a hurry. What's our next stop here, a sample at 3.9?||LMP-EVA|A - 080/3.9.|05 19 11 13|CDR-EVA|Well, I'm sitting on 080 right now and 2.6. I think we've got to add a little bit to that ...|05 19 11 21|CC|Okay. Stand by. We'll get a new correction for you guys on that shortly.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob. The surface is not changing. We see no craters that seem to penetrate into bedrock out in here - that is with blocky rims, and that's quite a contrast to the area we sampled at station 1A yesterday. I see - I cannot see in my field of view any blocky-rim craters. There are slight craters with - with fragmental walls and rims, but it looks like incident rock rather than the subfloor material.||CDR-EVA|Jack, can you see over there to the left? I'll turn a little bit - on the - on the dark area of the South Massif where you get those - those impressed lineations. See them going from left upward to the right?||LMP-EVA|Yes. I see what you mean; right.||CDR-EVA|That's what I saw out my window.||LMP-EVA|Yes - lower left they - they go obliquely up the slope.||CDR-EVA|They're more like wrinkles, they're - linear wrinkles.||LMP-EVA|Yes, Crenulations, you might say, in the slope that look something like those I saw from orbit -looking in the shadowed area - at the edge of the shadows. Bob, we've seen craters as much as -20 meters, maybe 30 meters in diameter without blocky rims.||||Tape 93A/42|||05 19 12 44|CC|Copy that, ... Thank you.||LMP-EVA|The rim block population is not much dif ~ The rim block population is not much different than the average for the terrain in here.||CDR-EVA|Boy, I'll tell you. If we can't recognize a change In that albedo when we get onto that white mantle, I'm going to be surprised.||LMP-EVA|Mark my words. Okay. The light mantle is just what Gene has said, it's a - that's it, right now -there are some very bright craters in It - they stand out, bright-haloed craters scattered over it, that - seem to be quite a bit brighter than anything we have out here on the dark mantle. See those blocks over there? That's the first different colored blocks I've seen; they're sort of gray looking.||CDR-EVA|Where are you looking?||LMP-EVA|Over to the right a little bit.||CDR-EVA|Darker gray, a little bit.|05 19 13 41|LMP-EVA|Watch yourself here. Okay. There's a crater with a big mass of block In the bottom. It looks like there - it might be a secondary fragment from somewhere.||CDR-EVA|Do you want to get a photo as we go by?||LMP-EVA|Yes, let's - can you swing a little bit to the right?||CDR-EVA|Yes .||LMP-EVA|That might be worth a - How's our time for traverse, Bob? Do we have time for an LRV sample?|05 19 14 03|CC|You're doing great, so far. We're looking for that first LRV sample at about 4.2 - that's in the light mantle, if you can do it quickly. But it's - we weren't planning on it.||||||Tape 93A/43||CDR-EVA|Want one here?||LMP-EVA|Yes , let's get -||CC|Target of opportunity there, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Can you get -||CDR-EVA|Go ahead.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Swing a little bit to the right now.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Right up across that little ray.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|And I'll try to get a chunk of whatever - okay, I want - keep going - keep going -||CDR-EVA|Look at that big . . . - -||LMP-EVA|Whoa, whoa, whoa.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Let me get the switch off.|05 19 l4 34|CDR-EVA|082, 3-0, and 2.6. And, Bob, I've been making - 10 to 12 clicks coming across the surface; and, as I say, for the most part, that's full bore except where I have to do some rapid changes.||CC|Okay. And, by and large, the back room is interested in you guys pressing on to station 2.||CDR-EVA|Okay, we are. Just watch the batt - or the -LCRU.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Gene. That's a pretty big rock in there.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|And, Bob, I think there's - -||||Tape 93A/44||||CDR-EVA|Hold it. Hold it down farther - down. It's got quite a bit of dirt in it.||LMP-EVA|I think this is a sam - this is a block from a linear-strewn field of very irregular and jagged rocks that are - that are southwest of the - of a crater that's 10 to 15 meters In diameter. If -if - if - it looks like the material that may have formed the crater, and you can look at some of the pictures and make up your own decision.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Can you get it in there? Okay. You got it.||CDR-EVA|No, no. No, I didn't.||LMP-EVA|No?||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|The bag's not open.||CDR-EVA|Well, okay. Yes, that's bad.||LMP-EVA|Can you push it in? Pull down.|05 19 16 02|CDR-EVA|Okay. It's down. 26 Echo, Bob. We're on our way||CC|Okay. Copy that - -||CDR-EVA|Go ahead.||CC|- - And, you got a frame count, Jack?||LMP-EVA|Oh, yes. Let me -||CDR-EVA|And I did get my locator here.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I got mine.||CC|Thank you, Jack, Gene.|05 19 16 17|LMP-EVA|And the frame - the frame count is 95-||CC|Copy that.||||||Tape 93A/45||LMP-EVA|Holy cow! I'd better slow down my picture talcing.||CC|Roger, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Okay. We're in a little area where the fragment population may be up to 3 percent. It's getting a little more like what we saw around the LM. In fact, I would say it was comparable now.||CDR-EVA|I'm going down this slope and up the other side, Jack.||LMP-EVA|But nothing like station 1.||CC|Okay. Copy that. And the next planned Rover sample will be at a distance of 4.2; so, 080 and 4.2. And it will be in the light mantle if - -||LMP-EVA|Okay. We got it, Bob.||CC|- - that's the big reason for those numbers.||LMP-EVA|Okay. It's in the first fall of light mantle, as I recall. Is that right?||CC|Roger; the thumb.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. Your heading at 260 looks like it's right on, by the way, from what I see on the skyline.||CC|Okay. And how's the low-gain antenna holding up?||LMP-EVA|Look at that ... - -||CDR-EVA|Well, I'm moving it, so I guess you're getting it.||CC|Yes, we're getting it - just checking.||LMP-EVA|Bob, I'm still - the blocks I see still seem to be the gabbro, except for that one sample we took, which I hope was what I thought it was -||CDR-EVA|Gee, it's blocky here.||LMP-EVA|Let's see - -||CDR-EVA|Oh, that's a big crater. We got to get around here.||||Tape 93A/46|||05 19 17 50|LMP-EVA|Okay. That musx be Bronte.||CDR-EVA|My gosh, is that big.||LMP-EVA|That's bigger than I expected.||CDR-EVA|Whoo! I got to go around this thing.||LMP-EVA|Yes, yes. There are some very - -||CDR-EVA|I got to go back here.||LMP-EVA|(Noise) Blocks, greater than the normal gabbro we've seen, that are very - have very large, egg-sized vesicles in them.||LMP-EVA|Watch it - you got one on your right there - Here you go.||CDR-EVA|Yes. I got them.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I - don't mind me, Gene.||CDR-EVA|No. No problem. That's all right, because some of those down-Suns are hard to see. I want to get off this slope.||LMP-EVA|I wonder if I took a picture of that block deal? (Laughing) I hope I did. Getting to be so automatic that I'm not sure what I'm taking any more.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I'm going to go through this niche between -on a high point in the saddle here.|05 19 18 48|LMP-EVA|Okay. How does it figure, Bob? I think we're just north of Bronte. Does that figure?|05 19 18 54|CC|Roger. That seems to be about where you should be on the map here. We gather you're circumnavigating a little bit. Comm's dropping out from time to time.||LMP-EVA|Yes ,|05 19 19 03|CDR-EVA|0.8, 3-5, and 2.9; and we're on the north side of Bronte.||||||Tape 93A/47||LMP-EVA|And it looks like Bronte has penetrated the dark mantle in here. It got the subfloor, but there's not an awful lot of blocks around the rim - There are just some small ones - compared to what we saw around - Watch it.||CDR-EVA|Yes. Yes.||LMP-EVA|What we saw around Horatio or in the walls of Horatio and around Camelot. Nothing, also, like we saw yesterday at station 1. Bob, that characteristic little dimple in the bottom of the craters is still with us, and it's invariably glass-lined in the fresh ones.||CC|Okay. Very good.||LMP-EVA|Now, that's not a complete lining. It just - there seems to be glass agglutinates, if you will - that's holding the fragments in the bottom of the crater together. There's one on the side of an older crater. We're back into about a 1-percent coverage. I suspect that the reason we - our block population went up there was because of Bronte.||CDR-EVA|An awful lot of these ... glass-lined little craters around.||LMP-EVA|Yes, and you notice, Gene, what I was saying about the little dimple in the bottom?||CDR-EVA|Yes .||LMP-EVA|Watch the fresh ones, and they all have that little dimple as if that - You see, there's one right there.||CDR-EVA|Yes, right there.||LMP-EVA|Man, you can predict it.||CDR-EVA|Ja.ck, you know, I think the white mantle is starting right over there. See on your right?||LMP-EVA|Yes, that's the first -||||Tape 93A/48||||CDR-EVA|The place you can really see it is where it1s reflected off the slopes of the - or the - -||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|- - Of the cliffs out there, but I think - I hate to say it, but Charlie may be right.||LMP-EVA|Well, but you know, one thing that may distinguish it is the - the bright-halo craters are brighter.||CDR-EVA|But I can see it from here - -||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|- - On the floor of the valley here.||LMP-EVA|Yes .||CDR-EVA|On the scarp it really shows up.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Block population is unchanged; still appears to be the - when I can see large enough blocks -appears to be the gabbro, although there's not as -not as much to look at now in terms of blocks. The surface characteristics have not changed. There are no craters that we see that are bringing up clear, blocky rims. There's a - most of the fresh craters have incident rock around them. The craters are the same size. They are older and more subdued. That incident rock is apparently broken down. I suspect a small zapping breaks that down fairly quickly.||CC|Okay, 17. Copy that. You still making about 9 to 11 kilometers'?||CDR-EVA|No, sir. I've been making from 10 to 12, Bob, -mostly 12.||CC|Okay. Can you give me a reading on the amps this t ime, Geno.||CDR-EVA|Okay. You're getting - Stand by. I've got a little navigating to do.||||||Tape 93A/49||CC|Okay; standing by.|05 19 22 11|CDR-EVA|Okay. I'm read -I'm reading -I'm reading 100 -bouncing - around 100 on both of them.||CC|Okay. How about amps and not smp-hours?||CDR-EVA|... up-and-down, hummocky terrain, I think with -Oh, I'm sorry.||LMP-EVA|Watch your - you got a hole in front of you.||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Oh. There you go. Spun out a little bit.||CDR-EVA|Here, let me get up here.||LMP-EVA|Good vehicle you got here.||CDR-EVA|Yes. It takes a little getting used to, though.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|I'm not sure I want to go through many of those.||LMP-EVA|No.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. I'll give you an amp reading as soon as I can. Just stand by for it.||CC|All right. There's no hurry. Wo hurry.||LMP-EVA|Would you believe my camera handle's coming off?||CDR-EVA|The terrain gets a lot more locally hummocky with some - with some well-rounded rims but very - very large-aspect-ratio craters, which you got to get around in here - in the 4- or 5-meter size.|05 19 23 27|CDR-EVA|Charlie, that - Charlie - I was thinking of white mantle. That's the white mantle we're coming up on right up here.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|See that on your right?||||Tape 93A/50||||LMP-EVA|Yes .||CDR-EVA|That's it, there's not going to be that much difference .||LMP-EVA|Oh.||CDR-EVA|Wot going to be that much difference, but - look where you're going.||LMP-EVA|I got to watch I don't lose my camera. It's - come loose.||CDR-EVA|See, now you can look where we're going to come up on the white mantle. It's dusted with that light - light - look at it.||LMP-EVA|Yes .||CDR-EVA|We're only 100 meters from the light mantle.||LMP-EVA|Well--||CC|Okay. How about giving us the range and bearing when you get to it.||CDR-EVA|Look at - look at this crater in here. We're coming right up on it now.||LMP-EVA|Yes. There certainly is a change in the general albedo, particularly in the craters. The craters are much brighter in their walls than we've seen before.||CDR-EVA|Yes . That' s a -||LMP-EVA|Although there still is a brown - a light gray dusting over the top of it in here, but it's clearly different - no question about that.||CDR-EVA|You can't see the contact as you cross it but we're just - we know we're coming into something lighter -You can - obviously see it.||LMP-EVA|Yes. We ought to sample the rim of one of these craters when we get our LRV sample, because that's what's distinctly lighter.||||||Tape 93A/51||CC|How about a range and bearing, guys?|05 19 24 44|CDR-EVA|We're at 3.8 here, and we can sample that rim - -||CC|Copy the 3.8.|05 19 24 48|CDR-EVA|0834.4, 3.8, and I've been ... - -||LMP-EVA|How about right over there, Geno? Can you get on the rim of that crater?||CDR-EVA|Right here?||LMP-EVA|No , right to the right there. Right here - that light stuff. See the big crater here - -||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|- - and the light material right on the rim?||CDR-EVA|Yes. I can get there. But I'm going to have to not give you much of a turn because it's - -||LMP-EVA|That's all right. I got the pictures. Wow, if you can swing to the left a little bit and then back - whoa. Now, back right. Okay. Hope my camera stays on there.||CDR-EVA|You like that?||LMP-EVA|Whoa. Yes. Whoa, whoa.|05 19 25 17|CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. We're 083, 4.4, and 3.8; and I've been running about 20 to 25 amps, I think, on both.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|We are in the light mantle. It's not a contrasting light like you might expect, or like we're looking at on the scarp as the Sun shines on It, but I don't think there's any question.||CC|Okay. Beautiful.||LMP-EVA|Yes. The craters are definite - that penetrate into it are definitely different. However, the surface texture is unchanged. There may be fewer blocks.||||Tape 93A/52|||05 19 26 02|CDR-EVA|Okay; bag 27 Echo, 27 Echo.||CC|Copy that. And frame time, Jack?||CDR-EVA|Hold your bag? We don't want to lose it.||LMP-EVA|Stand by.||CDR-EVA|Hold it up.|05 19 26 16|LMP-EVA|Okay. It's in there.||CDR-EVA|Is it in? Okay. Oops, that bag won't stay open.||LMP-EVA|Yes. It will after we get a couple of samples in there. Okay; my locator.||CDR-EVA|And my locator.||LMP-EVA|I hope I don't lose my camera.||CDR-EVA|I can't reach it, or I'd help you.|05 19 26 31|LMP-EVA|Okay; 110.||CC|Copy that, Jack.||LMP-EVA|I guess I never - - I guess I didn't do what I wanted to do and that's get that thing really cinched down.|05 19 26 50|CDR-EVA|Boy, Bob, one of the remarkable things Is the Sun-angle difference on that light mantle when you're looking at the slopes of the Scarp versus what we're on. I hate to use a familiar term, but my impression right here is there is more of a raindrop influence than back at the LM, or in the darker mantle.|05 19 27 13|CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Yes. Might - might by.||CDR-EVA|I think so.||LMP-EVA|I think the big thing Is, though, that each one of these little craters is much light - much more||||||Tape 93A/53|||lightly colored. But we're still not - there's no crater in view that does - that has a blocky rim. There's fragmental rims based on, almost certainly, incident rock, but no blocky rims.||CDR-EVA|You know, one of the reasons those craters look lighter is because of their Sun angle. Walls of some of these little craters - It's the same material we're driving on, I'll bet. Yes, there is incident rock right there, Jack, you're right.||LMP-EVA|Yes .||CDR-EVA|Oh, boy.||LMP-EVA|The fragment population is certainly less than 1 percent in here.||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Right now. When I say fragments, I'm talking about rocks that are - are greater than a centimeter in grain size.||CDR-EVA|You know, it may be me, Bob; but It - it also seems to be a little bit more difficult to drive down-Sun in this area.||LMP-EVA|Yes, I think it is brighter, Geno. I was thinking that a minute ago, but it's hard to make a - I think your normal albedo is - is greater. Here's some rocks now starting , . . - -||CDR-EVA|And the little craters still have the central pits.|05 19 28 30|CC|Okay. We're losing your comm a little bit, guys.||CDR-EVA|||LMP-EVA|Yes, there's a few.||CDR-EVA|||LMP-EVA|Yes. There're a few blocks. They still - they still look like the gabbro, though. Hard to tell.||CDR-EVA|Well, a couple of them looked to me like they had some very light *** crystals in them. See that?||||Tape 93A/54||||LMP-EVA|I'm afraid those are zap pits.||CDR-EVA|They could be.||LMP-EVA|I got - I think I've been fooled by that, too, and that's why I estimated the ... time.||CDR-EVA|I just want to keep you out of those slopes, and I'll tell you, I get you in some to - -||LMP-EVA|That's all right.||CDR-EVA|- - keeping you out of them.|05 19 29 14|LMP-EVA|Okay. We're getting a little more blocks in here. Of course, we're approaching the dark mantle again. Now, you can see the difference. You got to look hard for it. But, you see those craters out in there are not white anymore.||CDR-EVA|I got to get around that slope.||LMP-EVA|Yes. Okay, You still got Hole-in-the-Wall picked out over there, don't you?||CDR-EVA|Yes, I got it. I'm just - - And, I'm trying to keep comm with them as I'm turning here.||LMP-EVA|Yes .||CDR-EVA|And, I've been keeping the thing on. I don't know if they're reading us, but I've been moving it.|05 19 29 46|CC|Reading you loud and clear, guys.|05 19 29 50|LMP-EVA|Okay. Looking up on the South Massif, we've got real good views of the block-strewn fields. There's one that - there seems to be two dominant colorations of the rock. The light-colored ones, very -very light tan and to white, and then there are the blue-gray rocks. There's one major outcrop of blue gray about a sixth of the way down the slope, the center of the field of view we have; and it looks very much like similar blue-gray rock:', right at the crest, the highest point from our vantage point.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 93B/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|05 19 33 13|CMP|There's the ole Earth. It's about a half Earth now.||CMP|Houston, America.||CC|Go.ahead, Ron.||CMP|Okay, Robert. I guess the big thing I want to report from the back side on this one here is that I took another look at the - the Cloverleaf in Aitken, with the binocs, and that southern, domical crater of the Cloverleaf - it has a breach on the east - east side of it. It - I can't tell -There's - there's a flow - In other words, the domical structures, themselves, are part of a flow material that is partially filled up the breach. In other words, the breach has either flowed into that little domical structure before the domes were built, or else all of that stuff that's in the mare floor has flown out of that domical structure before the domes came in. In other words, the domical structures, themselves, are different time relationship to the floor, itself. They are - are younger than the floor, itself.||CC|Roger, Ron. We copy that.|05 19 35 20|CC|Ron, is there a difference in the color between the dome and the mare in Aitken, there?||CMP|Yes, there - yes, there is. The dome-type material is - the colors again are very hard, you know? I'm just going to have to say that it's - it's slightly darker than the mare floor - is the way it looks to me, right at this point in time. Also, the texture is a coarser texture than the floor itself. In other words, the floor, to me, is kind of a standard mare flat-floor-type stuff. And I have to compare the texture of the domical hills to - Oh - I guess what I would imagine is some of the dacite flows that I've seen out in California. You know, the heavy viscous-type flows.||||Tape 93B/2||||CC|Roger. We copy there, Ron.||CC|That's good data on Aitken there, Ron. Those color differences any - on any of these things - that color is one of the most important things you can give us. We'll be all ears for that. »||CMP|Okay. I'll try to - The trouble with colors, I'm finding out, is that - it's sure a function of the Sun angle as to what color it appears to your eye.||CC|Roger. We can believe that. We just - we'll - -||CMP|... passes. Yes.|05 19 37 4l|CMP|You know, you take a look at the central peak of Neper, and on the south and western edge of it, you get the vertical stripes in it or streaking like you get off of the massifs in the landing site area. And then, you look at the area around in the rim - around the rim of Neper, and you get the corncob - I guess - or Sculptured Hill-type of appearance.||CC|Ron, it's time for PAW CAMERA T-stop time.||CMP|Okay. Thank you. ***teen 24 -|05 19 38 38|CMP|Now. Okay, went to STANDBY at - whatever I said now. (Laughter)||CC|Roger.||CMP|It's been about 30 - something.||CC|That's fine. No problem.||CC|Ron, if you start your Picard orbital science photos on time, I'll be glad to call you to change to f/5*6 and the change to f/4, if you want.||CMP|Oh, okay.||CC|Okay, Ron. You can go PAN CAMERA, OFF at this t ime.||||||Tape 93B/3||CMP|Okay. PAN CAMERA POWER is -|05 19 40 11|CMP|OFF.||CMP|That's Conder - Condorsay or Condorcet, or whatever you want to call it, there. Condorcet Hotel is the one that has got that diamond-shaped fill down in the - in the floor.||CC|Roger. Understand. Condorcet Hotel.||CMP|Condor - Condorcet Alfa - it's either got a landslide - I'll get a picture of that the next time with - with the other frame, but it's either got a landslide on it, or it's had a - And it doesn't look like a crater on the side of the wall, on the northwest wall of the crater.||CC|Okay. We copy that. Northwest wall of Condorcet A||CMP|That's a - the area is oval or ellipse shape. Of course, the top of the ellipse is toward the top of the crater. And it looks like it's - almost gets a flow out of the bottom of the ellipse, which is about a fourth of the way up from the bottom of the crater.||CC|Ron, can you give me a scale on the size of that flow, as compared to the rest of the crater?||CMP|Uhhh. The - the hole or the slope or the slide, or whatever you want to call it, down through there, is maybe one-eighth of the crater diameter. And the floor area is only just a real small portion of one-eighth size. It's a ... - -||CC|You seeing any lineaments in the area? Any lineaments in the area?||CMP|Yes. There was some lineaments on the area - in the area; and again, they're vertical-type lineaments or lineations kind of like the - the downslope - operations of most ... craters.||CC|Roger.||||Tape 93B/4|||05 19 45 34|CMP|They're fresher ones. Okay, let's see. We're going to Picard and then on up to - Yerkes - Where's Yerkes? There it is. Okay. Let's see where we're aiming at, here. Okay, Is it about time, does it look like?||CC|Roger. You can start at - you're just about 30 seconds from starting on Picard, And like you said on the map, you go up - you go up Picard, after you start up Picard X, there, and you go on up through Picard and Yerkes and that - -||CMP|Okay.||CC|- - that front there, up at Yerkes' area. That's the Yerkes. Right above there is where you change to f/11.||CMP|Okay. Okay, here we go.|05 19 46 21|CMP|Started it, Picard X,||CMP|Works better when you take the slide out.||CC|If you'll give me kind of a call at what you're aiming at, like Picard X and Picard, I can give you a call on those f-stops, Ron.||CMP|Okay. I just passed Picard X; and then the one west of that. *** what it was. The next - about half the size of Picard X. Hey, does this go right through Picard? Or south of it?||CC|No, it goes right through dead center of Picard.||CMP|Okay. We!ll get it.|05 19 4? 43|CMP|Sure hope that color difference shows up in - on Picard.||CC|Roger. We hope so9 too.||CMP|There's black material - now - get on up here -you get on up here5 the darker tannish-gray material covers essentially from the east all the way around to the south. It goes outside the rim as well as inside the rim. It drapes over the rim. That can't be a shadow effect.||||||Tape 93B/5||CC|Have you taken Picard yet, Ron?||CMP|Just now. Just one more, and I'll be through with Picard. Change to what?||CC|No, not yet. You don't change it until you get on the other side of Yerkes, up there. Your path goes directly between Yerkes and ... - -||CMP|Okay. Let me go to f/ll.||CC|No. Don't change to f/ll until you're at Yerkes.||CMP|Yes, okay. Until I get to the other side of Yerkes.||CMP|I can still see those dark halo craters down there. I'm going to have to look at them with the binocs sometime.||CC|Roger.||CC|Okay. When you're at Yerkes there, you want to switch to f/ll. Just - -||CMP|||CC|- - just on the other side of Yerkes.||CMP|Okay.||CC|And looking west, you'll go right through Proclus.||CMP|Okay.||CMP|Now, what comes after Proclus?||CC|Okay. You just keep pressing on up through -through - up in towards Maraldi. You go up through Proclus, and then Proclus D; and at that point, you'll change to f/5.6 and then get - get into the Maraldi N, across the maria there; and the mare of Tran - Tranquillity.||||Tape 93B/6||||CMP|Oh, okay.||CMP|It's sure easy to see why that - ray excluded zone shows up on the pictures because, to me, it's -it's a tan Sculptured Hill-type material - where -in the ray excluded zone of Proclus.||CC|Okay, Ron. The - this pass continues and you change to 5-6 up there at Proclus D at the mare/ highland contact at Proclus - up around Proclus and Franz.|05 19 53 13|CMP|Okay. It's about now. Change to 5-6. Getting out into the mare.||CC|Okay. You go right across the Mare - Maraldi M and Maraldi D, and across Vitruvius A and Vitruvius.||CMP|Oh. Okay. It's a little closer in, then.|05 19 53 32|CC|And, at Vitruvius again - -||CMP|||CC|- - on that contact, the mare to the highlands is where you go to f/4.||CMP|At - Okay, Vitruvius? Yes, okay; f/4. You know, if you can look up on your map, it looks like there's kind of a subdued ... almost submerged crater, between - I mean just east of Vitruvius A. And that - that domical mounds that are sticking up around there are the same type of structures as Maraldi Gamma. And that's what lead me to believe that - you know - it's just some old jumbled-up-type stuff that was here before the mare.||CC|Roger. We copy.||CMP|That has a completely - It has a completely different - texture to it than the domical structures of Aitken.||CC|Okay. We got that.||||||Tape 93B/7||CC|Okay. Have you gotten up over, vertical over Vitruvius? If you are, that's where you go to f/4.||CMP|Not quite. I'm in Vitruvius A, right now.||CC|Okay. Good show.||CMP|And I just took a peak at it with the binocs and -Let's see, I'm 5*6 at 1/250. And that's a different type of material. It looks like it's a - it almost has to be a slump-type of operation. Somehow, it gets piled up down in the middle. But they're a smoother, more subdued type of domical structures than the ones in Aitken. Okay. Switching to f/4 - -||CC|Roger; f/4 - -||CMP|- - 1/250.||CC|Your track goes right across the mare - the mare there between Tranquillity and Serenity - right across Dawes, and ends at just to the east and north of Plinius. On that - -||CMP|Okay.||CC|- - that appears to be the boundary between Tranquillity and Serenity.||CMP|No, when I take a look at it from this angle, you even get a different - the - the ejecta from Plinius kind of covers up the rilles and the annulus around Serenitatis.|05 19 57 29|CMP|Now, we're getting into a relatively low Sun. And Serenitatis is a lot lighter colored than the -the light tan, to me. And then you — in the low Sun, you look out into Tranquillitatis, across Plinius, and that demarcation turns out to be the same - same kind of gray-tan. You know, It's a darker -||||Tape 93B/8||||CC|But there is a color difference between Serenity and Tranquillitatis, there?||CMP|Yes. There's a definite color difference between Tra - and it almost looks like - If you could stand on color alone, the color from Tranquillitatis extends on over, and covers into - you know, kind of drapes over the edge and covers up part Serenity.||CC|Okay. We got that. Well, that should be all of your photos there, on that pass, Ron.||CMP|Oh, okay. (Laught er)||CC|And, Ron, before we get into the visual, here, we'd like HIGH GAIN, AUTO.|05 19 58 40|CMP|Okay. HIGH GAIN -||CC|And, can you give me --||CMP|... away from the window, here.||CC|- - a magazine report on that two pictures?||CMP|Okay. We're magazine Lima Lima. And it's 129-||CMP|Yes, we're at the same Sun angle, and there's no doubt about it from Tacquet on up to Mel something or other, there's a group of small rilles in there, and those rilles have got ejected material, around and up and over the rilles. And not - not impact-type ejecta. It's got to be a volcanic ejecta of some kind up and around there. It's a dark brown -a darker brown, than the tan of Serenitatis.||CC|Roger. You're referring to the Menulus [sic] rilles, there, right to the west of Tacquet, right? That's to the west of Tacquet? Still, it looks like it's in the Serenitatis - Serenitatis Basin, right on the edge of it.||||||Tape 93B/9|05 20 01 13|CC|Roger. We see -them.||CMP|And then they kind of st - they stop just even with Mel whatever it is. (Laughter) Malinius or something like that.||CC|Not Melinius or Menelaus? Pick your pick.||CMP|Yes. Okay.|05 20 01 36|CC|You see a ray coming out of Menelaus going through -through Bessel? Is that one of Tycho's rays?||CMP|It disappeared. I couldn't - couldn't see that one.||CC|Roger.||CMP|Take a look the next time around.||CC|That was my question. I was just curious.||CMP|Yes. I know it shows it on the map there, and I haven't really got a good - a good clear picture of a ray, yet.||CC|I'm going to be more interested to see it - -||CMP|I'll look for it for sure the next time.||CC|— - I want to - more interested to see if you can see the alleged crater Arabia on this next pass-||CMP|(Laughter) I've been looking for that every pass. And - there's a lot of depressions - and ridges and - hills around there. It's hard to - see, you don't really get a big picture view of it. You get a little piece of it at a time. And I think, in order to really con - convince yourself that you got something there, you're going to have to get - get off - away from it. And - -||CC|Roger. Understand.||CMP|*** D-Caldera is sure a depression. Like nothing I've ever seen before.||||Tape 93B/10||||CC|Got you. You're going to get a chance to get some pictures of that next - next rev.||CMP|"Next rev? Okay, they ought to be good ones because the Sun angle is going to be pretty good. But, at this point, you get a dark tan, kind of a mare-type material - it's in mare-type materials And then it's a light gray down in the D-Caldera itself. Sure looks like a ""D"" all right. But it's a light gray down in there. And then it's got bumps that stick up, and the bumps themselves are - I want to look at it again for sure. But I get the impression the bumps, themselves, are the light tan material."|05 20 04 59|CC|Okay. Understand. The bumps are light tan. Right?||CMP|Whereas, down - Yes, the bumps are light tan. And down between the bumps that are down in the Caldera, it looks like a rough - real rough blocky - gray material.||CMP|Bob, I hope you're keeping me honest on the Flight Plan. I got my head out the window. I can't follow the Flight Plan.||CC|Affirmative. All you got is, in about 4 minutes, or 3 minutes, now, you pick up orbital science visuals on Copernicus. And we'll just stay with you on those orb science visuals right through Reiner Gajrnna. And at 143:12, you've got a rather rapid time, you might want to quit early. You got the LOI [sic] canister change. Then you got a P52. So, your choice on that. I'll call you right at 143:12, if that's what you want.|05 20 06 13|CMP|Okay, yes. Give me a call right there, because I got to get ready for this - I'll do the PJ2 first, so you all can see it, then I can always change that canister.||CC|Yes, okay. We'll concur on that; but just don't forget it.||CMP|Okay.||||||Tape 93B/11||CC|"Ron, you're coming up on Copernicus; I might read you some of these questions. One of them was, ""Study the floor of Copernicus, and compare its material to that on the walled terraces."" The other one is, ""When viewed from the opposite direction, Is there an extension of the structure in the middle central peak?"" I guess that we refer to that as what might be a dike In that middle central peak. And ""What is the nature of that structure?"""||CMP|Okay. I think those things are going to be kind of hard to see. But we'll try.||CC|The back room would like you to kind of concentrate on looking on that dike, if it is at all possible, Ron. Even if you have to use - -||CMP|Okay. I'll --||CC|- - even if you have to use the binoculars.||CMP|- - get the ole binocs, here. Okay.|05 20 08 25|CC|If you want to feel for some scale on that, just a reminder: the crater is about 3 kilometers deep, and the central peak is 400 meters high, Ron.||CMP|400 meters. Okay.||CMP|Is this Eratosthenes I'm passing over now? 1 hope.||CC|Yes. You should be just about over Eratosthenes right now.|05 20 09 57|CMP|1 hope it's Eratosthenes because the old Sun's shining right on my rendezvous light, out here.||CC|Roger.||CMP|And you can't see anything out the window.||CMP|Ahhhhhh, there's Copernicus.||CMP|And I'll tell you what. 1 think we - need more daylight (1aught er).||||Tape 93B/12||||CC|Kind of tough, huh?||CMP|Yes, especially the binocs cut off - they must cut off too much light or something.||CC|Okay, we understand that. Might just stick with the naked eye then and do the best you can, I guess.||CMP|Well, I'm trying to - to recall what Jack said on it, and what I see. I'm not sure, did he mention the - the dark part to the south - on the south side of Copernicus? In other words, you can see albedoes real well, and there's a dark area that extends maybe - oh, a half a crater diameter, three-quarters of a crater diameter to the south5 and then it kind of flows down in -I don't know - I don't want to say flows, but at least it carries itself down - down the crater wall - down to the crater floor. And this is kind of in the south maybe from 6 - or let's see, from about 4:30 to 7:30. And then the rest of the crater all the way - all the rest of the way around it, you can see light albedo step all away around the crater. The first step down about a fourth of the way down in the crater wall.|05 20 13 31|CC|I don't recall that, but sounds good, Ron.||CMP|Okay. Unfortunately, those things really disappear fast.||CC|Roger. Take - take a look at the peaks and concentrate on that mountain in the center of the peaks, If you will, Ron.||CMP|Okay. Is - it's already passed now but I can recall as - as I was looking at it, the peaks -well, seems to me like there's four and they have the same light albedo texture as the - not texture, but the same light albedo - as that first - rings on the inner wall of the crater. And then interspersed between those white peaks were a darker -you could just tell It's the darker - albedo. And you couldn't tell for sure - it's not part of the crater floor, it's just a darker albedo interspersed in there. And I spent - oh, half my time||||||Tape 93B/13|||trying to acquire the thing in the binocs. And it just cuts - the binocs just cut down the light too much.||CC|Okay. We'll try maybe later on with the binocs on Copernicus. I guess you're coming up in the Kepler area, aren't you - your - your right coming up on Kepler B.||CMP|Yes. I think there should be Kepler B right out there now.||CMP|Let's see - Yes, that's out in Oceanus Procellarum, I guess, isn't it?|05 20 15 32|CC|That's af firmat ive.||CMP|Yes, and then Aristarchus is coming up, I think, isn't it? No, that's Kepler.||CC|I think Kepler is the real bright one with many bright rays from - coming out it.||CMP|Yes, it's got a - got a lot of the bright rays on it. Kepler D, and must be another one down there. They, the two small Keplers, don't show any bright rays at all. Do show they're - they've bright slopes on the inner walls. The rays of Kepler really show up quite markedly in the earth-shine. I bet - I bet they show up probably better in earthshine than they do - otherwise. Because I think earthshine tends to bring out the - the albedo differences - considerably.|05 20 l6 55|CC|Why don't you give me a hack when you're right over Kepler, Ron?||CMP|Okay, will do. And then what's directly south of Kepler, there's one about the same size as Kepler?||CC|Encke is about the same size and directly south of Kepler.||||Tape 93B/14||||CMP|Yes, that's Encke. Okay, Encke.||CMP|Encke has - departing from the west - Yes, no, I mean departing on its eastern side - it's either -it's a light - I don't see how in the world it can have only one ray, but that's the only one I can see. But there's a light streak - oh about an eighth of the diameter of Encke; and it goes out to the east a little ways and then curves back - it goes out to the east - oh, about three-quarters of the crater diameter, and then it essentially curves back to the northeast and continues on out for another crater diameter.|05 20 18 20|CC|Roger. Good show.||CMP|That might be - that might be the margin of the highlands, there. I'm not sure.||CC|Okay.||CMP|Let's see, Reiner Gamma is going to be out of window 3, won't it?||CC|That's affirmative, Ron. Window 3 for Reiner Gamma.||CMP|Yes. Okay. Just north of - sure can't remember those names - Kyber?||CC|North of Kepler, there?||CMP|Kepler. Yes.|05 20 19 45|CMP|And I'm looking out window 3 now, and you can still see those rays. They must be coming from Kepler. They go way on up north toward - the next one is - is - -||CC|Yes, did you see them going up toward Mariun, there||CMP|Yes, there's ... zero phase. Yes, I can see Aristarchus. I think that must be Aristarchus. Way back over to the north.||CC|Yes, that's - that's Aristarchus.||||||Tape 93B/15||CMP|Sure - -||CC|That's affirm.||CMP|--yes , yes.|05 20 20 31|CC|Can you see anything on that Marius Rille up there? Or is that too far up?||CMP|Yes. It - I've sort of kind of looking for it. I can just see some - about three or four light spots up in there. But that's a long ways away, you know.||CC|Roger.||CMP|It's about halfway - it's about halfway to the horizon. Or the real light area. Let's see, and you can see Reiner Gamma. I guess Reiner is the crater there. ... Isn't there a big crater just before you get to it - -||CC|That's affirm.||CMP|- - I think. And then Reiner Gamma - Hey, you know, from here it almost looks like It's the -the ejecta from a crater, because (chuckle) and then continuing from the bottom of the - bottom of the Gamma is a - again a lighter albedo that comes down toward the crater Reiner about halfway between the two of them, and then it takes off and goes perpendicular to - to the line between Reiner and Reiner Gamma.|05 20 21 51|CC|Roger. We copy that.||CMP|And that's a lighter - lighter albedo demarcation, there.||CC|Is there any topographical expression associated with brightness - with the brightness of Gamma?||||Tape 93B/16||||CMP|Well, that's what it - is - is very hard to pick up. Maybe that's what the - what I'm describing here - is going perpendicular to the - to the two of them. I got to check and see if that's a - you know, a rise from a relatively flat area up to a kind of a - a hilly terrain.||CC|Any dark deposits associated with the Gamma? Reiner Gamma?||CMP|Yes, it's - the Gamma, itself, is - is dark. Now, when zero - zero - Hey, I think we're going to be lucky - zero phase is going to go right through it. But there are dark - in other words, the Gamma, itself - is about the same size as the - as the -the full extension is about the same size as the crater Reiner. And then half of a crater diameter on the inside of that - and, of course, in the Gamma-type shape is a dark type material. Zero-phase is going right through it right now. By gosh, it didn't blot out the dark at all.|05 20 23 46|CC|Got any — any more thoughts about what it is?||CMP|The--||CC|Do the light-colored markings to the north look the same, Ron?||CMP|You know, you get - you mean off toward the Marius Hills area?||CC|Yes, that's right.||CMP|There's a - the only light - yes, the only light-colored stuff that you can see - I don't see anything off towards the Marius Hills on the thing. You see it right around Reiner Gamma itself. And intermixed within that is that dark - it's a dark annulus, except the annulus is on the inside of the white. And it looks like - I don't know if your eyes deceive you in this darkness or not, but it sure looks the light-colored stuff is raised up with respect to the dark. In other words, the dark almost looks like the interior of a crater -crater rim, interior of a crater wall, you know - -||||||Tape 93B/17|05 20 24 58|CC|Roger.||CMP|- - with the light material around it. Now that's what it looks like in the - in the darkness. And then on the - let's see - southwestern rim of it, it almost looks like you've got a breach of the dark albedo stuff going out to the southeast corner of it in two spots. Okay, then the light stuff turns into - how do you put it - a darker swirly looking type stuff as you continue on west of Reiner Gamma. It crosses kind of a wrinkle ridge, I can see a wrinkle ridge down there, now. It crosses the wrinkle ridge with the no - no apparent change in albedo, anyhow, as it crosses the ridge.||CC|Roger. Got you, and I think I've got the ridge on my map. I think we've got you.||CMP|Okay.||CC|Still - still think it might be a ray from one of those craters - -|05 20 26 09|CMP|That's the last of the - you know, it's kind of associated with its own little thing. It doesn't look like It's a ray. It doesn't look like a ray, in other words, it doesn't thin out in different parts of It, like a ray does.||CC|Okay.||CMP|It looks like it was a lot thicker than - than a ray.||CMP|Yes. Okay, this must be - what - Riccioli, I guess? The big crater? About -|05 20 27 03|CMP|Now.||CC|You're just coming up on Ricci - Grimaldi and you got to go through Hevelius, first of all, and then you get Into Grimaldi and Riccioli.||CMP|Okay, that's Hevelius, then, is the one I'm passing right now. Hevelius is showing up real clear. You can see the slumping of the crater walls coming||||Tape 93B/18|||||down there. It's a fairly old-type crater because you don't see any - any rays associated with it. Although the - the slumping is not completely degraded. There's a flat floor with a central peak on it. The central peak has the same albedo -it's a lighter albedo - no, the same albedo texture as the walls - as the west wall.|05 20 28 20|CMP|We're passing over a - well, generally a hilly type of terrain, and then just before we get into Grimaldi area, it looks like we're out into a plains-type material, again, interspersed with a hummocky-type. I guess that hummocky - is -hummocky stuff is associated with Grimaldi.||CC|Roger. Looks like you're just passing a little bit to the west of Grimaldi now. You concur with that? About right over Riccioli?||CMP|It doesn't look like Grimaldi to me - I guess it is, though.||CC|Okay, Ron. You probably ought to think about - If it's getting kind of dark there for seeing or anything, you might consider getting in the P52, although you're a couple more minutes - still a couple minutes left on it. If you can see back at anything within Reiner Gamma - -||CMP|Okay.||CC|- - from this angle, it would be good; otherwise, if it's out, you ought to just consider the 52.|05 20 29 48|CMP|Ah, she's pointing in the wrong direction.||CC|Okay. That was some good stuff, Ron. Just don't hesitate to keep talking on that. We can sort it all out when we get down.||CMP|Okay. Well, the bright - I'm looking out window I now. Must be out to the north I guess, and there's two very bright craters, in there, just crossing some rilles that run north and south. There's a little bit of a mare material out in there. I wish I knew what that crater was. Weil, I better get going on P52, I guess.||||||Tape 93B/19||CMP|"{Humming - ""Deck the Halls"")"|05 20 34 17|CMP|Old heaters sure work on these optics. They're always nice and warm when you take them out.||CC|Well, Roger. Understand you're changing the LOH -LiOH canister now.||CMP|(Laughter) No, the optics.||CC|Okay, good.||CMP|Tele - yes - telescope. When you - you take the telescope out, it's got a heater on it in there and it keeps it nice and warm. Okay, CMC, FREE. Do a P52, option 3. Okay, then back to P20. Okay, this time we will not forget to go to AUTO.||CMP|Okay, computer, find me a star. *** out there. Menkar. Okay, take me to Menkar. Oh!|05 20 36 03|CMP|Looks like Menkar.|05 20 37 06|CMP|Okay. Canopus. Canopus. Okay, take me to Canopus.||CMP|And Canopus is as bright as all get out.||CC|Just like the simulator, huh?||CMP|*** bright that - brighter than any star we've ever had in the simulator. *** so bright it almost blanks out the crosshair. Got Saturn.||CC|Yes, hope it's not Saturn, huh?||CMP|(Laughter) Me, too.||CC|Well, we'll know in a minute when we look at your NOUN 05-||CMP|Oh, man, okay.||CC|Nothing wrong with that one.||CMP|That's pretty good.||||Tape 93B/20||||CC|Yes. We'll buy that.||CMP|Think that's a good one?||CC|Okay, Ron, you can go ahead and torque.||CMP|Okay. We'll torque at 19*||CC|Good show, huh?||CMP|Now my new - bet that's in there, isn't it - unit vectors of Saturn. Would that be in here, somewhere?||CC|Say again, Ron?||CMP|These unit vectors of Saturn» aren't they in my -planet unit vectors — yes, stars - oh, here we go.|05 20 39 57|CC|Okay, we just got a beautiful picture of the Earth from the - from the Rover. Just spectacular picture of the Earth.||CMP|Oh, really?||CC|Yes.||CMP|Great.||CC|Just beautiful. Old Fendell's been hunting for all night, but he finally found it. It's just beautiful.||CMP|(Laughter)||CC|Ron, we're 5 minutes from LOS here. Everything's looking great. Just - you have to finish off your checklist on that TM, P20 and CMC MODE back to AUTO. And then just a reminder on that LOH [sic] canister: if you'd go back and pick that up, we'd appreciate it.||CMP|Okay, we'll get that one- I'm going to try and see if I can find Saturn here.||||||Tape 93B/21||CC|Okay.||CC|This VOX mode is just great. We're sitting here following what you're doing. You don't even have to talk to us. It's really great.||CMP|(Laughter) I think it's great, too.||CC|Your voice is so clear - - Oh, shucks. Now the fuel is - —||CC|You sound like you're in the next room.||CMP|Oh, really? You know, that's funny because I really can't hear myself and the - you know, on the intercom.|05 20 4l 28|CC|You sound - you sound - -||CMP|Well, I'll have to look ... - -||CC|- - louder in my earphone than in the simulator, when you're down at the Cape, or over here across the way. You're just loud and clear, even better than down there.||CMP|(Laughter) That's good. Well, it's beyond the field of view. So we'll have to catch it another time.||CC|Yes, that's too bad.||CC|We're going to pick you up at l44:10. I'll be losing you in a minute or so. And 144:10 has a good back side.||CMP|Okay.||CC|And you might check your ZPN settings when you -your sensors - when you get a chance on the back side here. They're still not giving much good data.||CMP|Okay. Yes, it looks like I'll have a little time this time, so I'll do it.||||Tape 93B/22||||CC|Roger. Just don't let them tear you away from the window, though.||CMP|(Laught er) Okay.||CC|And we've dumped the data from the last couple of back-side revs and you sound real good, Ron.|05 20 42 50|CMP|Okay, hey, real fine. You know the guys at lunar surface don't even have any ZPN, you know. They left it up here.||CC|Roger. {Laughter)||CMP|I didn't even - I didn't know that until they left. Okay, the old LiOH canister, let's see - 13 into A, and 13 must be in A-9 then. (Humming)|05 20 43 54|CMP|Oh, there's old 13. Take 14 out, so we - put ... in the bottom.||CC|Hey, Ron. We just had a discussion here and your point is well taken, and why don't you just go ahead, if you want to, and take the ZPN sensors, the yellow plug ones, off and take them off for the evening, if you like.|05 20 44 25|CMP|Hey, that sounds like an excellent idea. Thank you.|05 20 45 09|CMP|Okay, we're 11 - out - picked nice small ones, I guess. None of them have been stuck so far.|05 21 03 XX||BEGIN LUNAR REV 29|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 94A/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|05 19 30 34|CC|Okay, give me a range and bearing, please.||CDR-EVA|Bob, you want another sample of the dark mantle here? Could you use that?||CC|Yes, we want - As soon as you get into the dark mantle - We're estimating it's something like 4.34, 4.5, somewhere in that vicinity.||LMP-EVA|We're there.||CC|Okay. We're ready for another one, then.||LMP-EVA|We're there. Now, let's - If you can - Okay, right over there, and maybe I can get a rock with it; See that batch of rocks there?||CDR-EVA|Right here?||LMP-EVA|Whoa. Yes. Swing it. Whoa, now swing back over. Little more, little more. Whoa. Little more.||CDR-EVA|Can you - can you reach it?||LMP-EVA|Now, if you go forward.||CDR-EVA|Can you reach it?||LMP-EVA|Hold it. Right there.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob; 082, 5-0, and 4.3.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-LMP|And CDR is 3.85 and about 70 percent and no flags.||CC|Okay. Thank you, Geno.||LMP-EVA|I got it.||CDR-EVA|You got it? Okay?||||Tape 94A/2||||LMP-EVA|I got the rock. I got the rock, and there's some dirt in there. Maybe I'd better get a little bit more dirt.||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|You don't have any trouble getting dirt. Can you see in there? Is there - -||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|- - Much soil?||CDR-EVA|Oh, a little bit - -||LMP-EVA|Okay. I'll get - I'll get this soil.||CDR-EVA|Couple teaspoonsfull. Twenty-eight Echo, Bob.||CC|Say again there, 17-|05 19 32 14|CDR-EVA|Twenty-eight Echo,||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|And that's primarily a rock fragment. Jack's getting a soil fragment - soil sample with it.||CC|Copy.||CDR-EVA|Jack, look at the wrinkles over there on the North Massif.||LMP-EVA|Yes, there's no question that there Is apparent lineations all over these Massifs, in a variety of directions. Hey, look at how that Scarp goes up beside there. There's a distinct change in texture||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|As a matter of fact, lineations are not present on the Scarp, that we can see, where it crosses the North Massif. There is no sign of those lineations on there.||CDR-EVA|Oh, man; yes. I can see what you're talking about now.||||||Tape 9^A/3||LMP-EVA|Look over by Hanover.||CDR-EVA|It looks like the Scarp overlays the North Massif, doesn't it?||LMP-EVA|Yes .||CDR-EVA|Okay. This last one was 29 Echo.||CC|Okay. Copy that. And that's the soil.||CDR-EVA|Okay, now I need to get in that bag. That's firm.||CDR-EVA|Here's another one. You're going to - don't lose those.||LMP-EVA|I won't. I'll put It down.|05 19 33 28|CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, we are rolling.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|And pray for me, Bob, that I don't lose my camera. Okay. Hanover is very - quite a ways up the slope. I don't think we'd have gotten to It, as ve planned that time. But the appearance you have of the Scarp - Worth Massif contact is one of the Scarp being smoother textured, less cratered, and certainly less lineated. And I wouldn't be a bit surprised if it's, as Gene says, younger.||CC|Okay, Jack. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|But that goes - It's not just the - it's not just this slope, it's the materials on the other side of the Scarp, on the west side.||LMP-EVA|Okay, I'm going to have -bo really ease up on pictures. I forgot to give them a frame count.||CC|Yes. We didn't get a frame count. You want to give us a frame count there, Jack?||LMP-EVA|Well, Bob. The problem is I - if I - every time I take my hand off, my camera loosens up again.||||Tape 94A/4||||CC|Okay; I copy that. And our estimate is that if you kind of go between 50 and 100 meters between frames, we'11 make it.||CDR-EVA|Boy, I tell you. Are those Massifs getting to look big now. Holy Smoly.||LMP-EVA|That frame at the LRV sample was about 115.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|I'll tell you, that Scarp looks nice over there, too, doesn't it?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Okay, we're back down in our old friend, the dark mantle. And I think the zero phase point is not as bright as it was. Passing a small crater, but the block population is still way down there in about - Whoops, watch that one - 1 percent.||CC|And, 17» for your benefit, we're showing you with very good net mobility rates here; and things looking quite good.||LMP-EVA|Thank you. Gene's doing a great job.||CDR-EVA|I'll tell you, it takes all your time to drive, though. You look around, and you're in a hole.|05 19 36 12|LMP-EVA|Okay here's another small crater - instant (?) rock, with the same little pits and a spattering of glass holding the pit materials together. None of these - none of the glass linings look very coherent, Bob. They mainly just seem to be a sprinkling of glass that's - some - helping or coating the instant rock.||CC|Okay, I copy that, Jack.||LMP-EVA|We still don't have - The craters at about 10 to 15 meters in diameter seem to have somewhat more blocky material in their rims. But they're not clearcut blocky rim craters. And here's one that's probably 50 meters across that has a - a fair number of blocks in the bottom. Looks like it might have just about gotten down to where the gabbro is - starts to be abundant again.||||||Tape 94A/5||CC|Okay's I copy on that one, Jack.||CDR-EVA|... start ... 12 o'clock - 12 o'clock; and I'm going to work my way up to Hole-in-the-Wall and from there on up 3 right?||LMP-EVA|That's good.||CDR-EVA|Take a long, easy turnout.||LMP-EVA|Yes,||CDR-EVA|Got Hole-in-the-Wall, Bob. It's a very long, very subtle, very gentle slope. We'll just have to get some more words when ve get there.||CC|Okay; we're anxiously awaiting them.||CC|How about a range and bearing while you're at it 7||CDR-EVA|Yes. I've been taking 10 or 12 clicks most of the time.|05 19 37 58|CDR-EVA|Okay, ... 5,6 and 4.9||CC|Copy 4.9 on the range.||CDR-EVA|And about - 20 to 22 amps most of the time.||LMP-EVA|Okay, we're losing a little bit of LOW GAIN there, Geno.||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|I think you need to tilt it up a little. Probably undershooting the Earth. I don't know.||CDR-EVA|Well, our pitch angle changes all the time. That's the problem. Bob, I have been within 10 to 20 degrees of you the whole time.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Bob, we're not in light mantle, I don't think. Maybe we are.||CDR-EVA|I think we are, Jack.||||Tape 94A/6||||LMP-EVA|Yes, I guess we are.||CDR-EVA|I think we are. According to my geology map ...||LMP-EVA|I guess we are. Gosh, I was going to say the craters are white - whiter than they have been. So, we're back in it. And - -||CDR-EVA|I think - -||LMP-EVA|- - even the phase point's brighter, too.||CDR-EVA|I think that place where we had those small, blocky craters was within the dark mantle. I -They're not evident here in the lighter stuff.||LMP-EVA|Yes, yes.||CDR-EVA|Boy, is that getting big.||LMP-EVA|Whoo-ee!||CDR-EVA|Hold on.||LMP-EVA|Whoooee! Oh, boy, that really gives me a strange feeling (laughter).||CDR-EVA|Gives me a strange feeling too. Those are not intentional.||LMP-EVA|I understand.||CDR-EVA|I'm not sure I've got enough guts to make them intentional. Man everything's getting to look big the closer you get. Hole-in-the-Wall looks more promising, though, Bob.||LMP-EVA|Yes, I don't think that's going to be any problem until we get up and look back. Oh, man, what a trip this is going to be. Golly.||LMP-EVA|That vent cooling is just about right, isn't it.|05 19 39 48|CDR-EVA|No, it's just about warm for me.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Bob, is my PLSS cooling working all right?||||||Tape 94A/7||CC|Roger. It looks like it's working to us.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Bob, I'm not - The rock fragments look - still look like gabbro. The craters tend to have white walls and white rims, which they don't have in the dark - mantle area. Hie block population is way down, 1 percent or less. However, the bigger craters do have more blocks; but nowhere does that population seem get above about 5 percent. And that's on the walls and the rims of the craters, say bigger than 15 meters. There's one probably 20 meters in diameter that has some blocks on it.||CDR-EVA|Have you seen Nemo? I think Nemo is right over there, if I'm not mistaken. It's - I don't know.||LMP-EVA|Nemo will be hard to see. But, yes, it's probably that one right in there. Or back here. There's one back here.||CDR-EVA|Well, it's pretty - -||LMP-EVA|Yes, well — Yes, that's closer to Scarp. You're probably - It's probably right off your wing there.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I'm going straight ahead and then I'm going to make a left turn.|05 19 4l 10|LMP-EVA|Okay. We're looking at Lara - Now, Lara - I can see blocks in the northwest rim of Lara. At least, it's rugged terrain; and it looks like blocky terrain. One spot - is all I see. It looks like It may be a couple hundred meters in average diameter. On - It starts about - maybe three-quarters of the way up the wall and goes right up to the rim.||CDR-EVA|Hey, Bob, Hole-in-the-Wall seems to be a - -||LMP-EVA|Hey, look at that. Look at that crater!!||CDR-EVA|Right there? Yes.||LMP-EVA|That pit - that central pit goes down about half the depth of the crater, and the crater Is a fresh||||Tape 94A/8|||||3-meter crater. That's - It almost was a cylindrical pit. Hey, Bob, Hole-in-the-Wall is a -is just a step - headed down to the south or southeast on the Scarp. It's a - Scarp is just about what I think we all expected it to be. It's very rolling and relatively smooth. I don't really see any outcrops exposed anywhere out here to the -to the south.||LMP-EVA|No. You see, now there's station 3 area right up there.||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Looks like maybe that - set of - see that bright bigger crater over there to the right of Lara? That's probably a good place for station 3.||CDR-EVA|Yes, way over there. Yes. Okay, we're going to find out something very shortly.||LMP-EVA|It doesn't look very rocky, Gene.||CDR-EVA|No.||LMP-EVA|||CC|How about bearing and range, guys?||CDR-EVA|Bob, I'll give it to you just as soon as I make my turn. It's not too far - 100 meters -||LMP-EVA|Are - are you - are you going to turn over that or go on closer - -||CDR-EVA|No, I'm going right up straight ahead and then go on to the inside of that place.||LMP-EVA|Yes. That's more than 100 meters.|05 19 43 08|CDR-EVA|Yes. I'll - 08l and 5.6.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|There's the - Now the craters are getting very, very light colored - in the rims and walls.||||||Tape 94A/9||CDR-EVA|You notice when we're in the light mantle looking at the scarp, at this angle, it loses some of its high albedo?||LMP-EVA|Yes. Yes. I think we're getting - -||CDR-EVA|We've got a long depression to go around.||LMP-EVA|Your eyes get used to it.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Jack, we got to watch it because I got to go around a long depressions. That's a crater over there.||LMP-EVA|On the right, yes.||CDR-EVA|I don't know how - can get over there to -||LMP-EVA|I think - -||CDR-EVA|I may have to go up over there. I can't go down that hole. That one's not going to make it.||LMP-EVA|What's your pitch?||CDR-EVA|Let's go back here. We can't get there. I'm going to go over here.||LMP-EVA|What was your pitch then, Geno?||CDR-EVA|Oh, ... primarily. I can't go there.||LMP-EVA|Yes, I think you're right.||CDR-EVA|We'll go up this gentle slope. See what's on top.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Let me get my ...|05 19 44 17|LMP-EVA|We made a turn to the south a little bit at 081 and 5-7* Are you going to try to drive up there?||CDR-EVA|I don't think we're going to have any choice.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Looks to me like right on the - just to the left of that - -||||Tape 94A/10||||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|- - white crater is a - or even right like you're headed now and then veer off to the right.||CDR-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Find out how this climbs In a minute.||LMP-EVA|Oh, I think you're all right. That - -|05 19 44 47|CDR-EVA|And, Bob, I'm starting up the scarp at 08l, 6.6, and 5•7•||CC|Okay. Copy that, Geno.||LMP-EVA|This is the first tongue(?) of the scarp.||CDR-EVA|I don't even think the Rover knows it's going uphill. I've got about 3 - 7 or 8 amps. See what's on top here.||LMP-EVA|You're making about 8-8 clicks.||CDR-EVA|And I'm full bore.||LMP-EVA|(Laughter)||CDR-EVA|Well, I'll tell you, this Rover doesn't know it's going up the hill.||LMP-EVA|Looks to me like you may be able to head just like you're going.||CDR-EVA|Yes. Hey, Bob, we'll make it.||LMP-EVA|And get down - -|05 19 45 25|CDR-EVA|Yes. We will make it. ... Get my antenna adjusted||LMP-EVA|Okay. Whatever makes up the light mantle is - in -at least, the incident rock that it forms is much lighter than anything we see. Those fragments probably - are 30 percent lighter than any fragments we see on the dark mantle. And that's around the fresh craters. But it is not blocky. Bob, are you still reading?||||||Tape 94A/11||CC|Roger. Read you loud and clear.||LMP-EVA|Okay, I just wanted to make sure my antenna's working||CC|Roger.|05 19 46 25|CDR-EVA|We're doing a little zig-zag navigation. I'm -literally came up a slope at about a heading of 240. We couldn't get through the actual turn to the south because there is a big crater right at the foot of it. So we're just making our way through some relatively local undulating slopes that get pretty steep, but it seems to be no problem.||LMP-EVA|Yes, I think we're in good shape. Bob, I can't -there are not any blocks big enough to really make a statement about what the rock is. But it - it really doesn't look like gabbro anymore.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|It doesn't have that - -||CC|And a reminder that eventually you're going to have to turn to the south a little bit to pick up -the final thing at the - station 2.||LMP-EVA|We're not on top of that scarp, yet. We're still in the Hole-in-the-Wall rim.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Bob, as far as lineations in the soil or on the surface that are observable at this range, I don't -I don't see any. I think there may be a finer raindrop pattern on the light mantle than maybe there was out on the dark. But that's an awfully hard judgment to make.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|How you doing, Geno?||||Tape 94A/12||||CDR-EVA|Doing fine, Bob. We've slowed down between about 5 to 8 - maybe 5 to 10 clicks most of the time. I'm going to head right up there, I think. Get around this crater.||LMP-EVA|Pretty healthy roll you're going to have here.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I'm going to head more straight up the hill. Once I get up on top, I'll be all right. I'm going to head down in this hole and then up that way.||LMP-EVA|Yes, I think - -||CDR-EVA|I don't mind pitch, but I sure don't like roll.||LMP-EVA|I don't either.||CDR-EVA|Now I'm going to head straight up - I'm going to head straight up that slope right there. Okay.|05 19 48 49|LMP-EVA|Bob, I still - It looks like maybe the large fragments in here are still crystalline. They have white zap pits on them. But they do not yet really resemble the gabbro.||CC|Okay, Jack. Copy that. Give us a hack when you get up on top of the scarp there.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CMP-EVA|Let me tell you, Bob, I've got to go cross-slope some of the time because the Rover is really working to go uphill now.||CC|All right.||CDR-EVA|But we're almost there.||LMP-EVA|As I look up the scarp to the west, there are some big blocks scattered around on our horizon; but, again, I would guess that we're not dealing with more than - 2 or 3 percent total coverage of blocks in here, at that.||CDR-EVA|Well, I think, for the most part - for the most part, we're on top... - -||||||Tape 94A/13||LMP-EVA|Yes, we're - we're on top.|05 19 49 53|CDR-EVA|Bob, we're at 7-8 - correction 078, 7-2, and 6.2.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Jack, where was Nansen with respect to those tracks up there?||LMP-EVA|Well, they never really had any good tracks pinned down, I don't think, on that - You'll be able to see Nansen, I think soon as you get over this hill.||CDR-EVA|Boy, I tell you, when we look back, that's going to be quite a sight if we can see into that Sun. We have been coming uphill. Well, I'd say this is the - this Is the last straw to the top. And is she working! Come on, baby.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I think you bear -||CDR-EVA|I'm going to try to get over along the base of the massif now.||LMP-EVA|Yes. Head towards that track area there, anyway. There are a lot of boulder tracks coming down from the blue-gray rocks, Bob. We'll see whether or not we're going to get to those tracks at Nansen, or we might want to move over to the track and see if we can find the boulder that made them.||CC|Okay; if they're in the vicinity, It might be a nice idea - -||LMP-EVA|But there's no question where those tracks come from.||CC|And we gather you're slowing down to about 5 clicks now, coming up this last rise.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I'm back up to about 7 to 10 now, Bob. That'a the slowdown - is because that's about all it will take.||||Tape 94A/14||||LMP-EVA|Bob, I have the impression that there is a dipping zone of blue-gray outcrops or block concentrations up there on the Massif that trends from the high point just beneath the Earth - cross-slope - and probably is - at least the apparent depth is -oh, I don't know, 10 or 15 degrees to the east. It looks like those outcrops may match up along that trend.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Jack, I'm going to head right along this ridge because I think that's the depression we were talking about.||LMP-EVA|Yes, That's Nansen down there.||CDR-EVA|Right - Where are you looking?||LMP-EVA|I think, right below -||CDR-EVA|I think you're right. I think that's it. Let me get over here, and then I'll head a little bit to the south.||LMP-EVA|Yes, we're a little more west, I think, than we intended to be.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I think you're right.|05 19 52 18|LMP-EVA|Bob, 7 - Wait a minute - 7.8 and 6.5-||LMP-EVA|Bob, I've had an impression, and I can't prove it yet, that we're dealing with more heterogeneous rock. Possibly there are breccias In here. But it's - it's - awfully hard to tell right now. They're very light-colored rocks - I think even lighter colored than the gabbros.||CC|Okay. We'll soon find out.||LMP-EVA|I'm afraid those - I think we can follow those tracks - the pictures, maybe, or -||CDR-EVA|Yes, I think we can see some of those coming down.||||||Tape 94A/15||LMP-EVA|I think the ones from the big outcrop of blue-gray rock, though, are the ones going into Nansen.|05 19 53 29|CDR-EVA|Bob, my best guess - let's see - 077) 7-7, 6.6 -is that we're coming up on the northern .side of Nansen.||CC|Okay. We copy that, Geneo.||CDR-EVA|And, let me tell you, this is quite a Rover ride.||CC|It sure sounds like it.||CDR-EVA|That Is quite a machine, I tell you. I think it would do a lot more than we'd let it.||LMP-EVA|(Laughter) That's right. I think that big crater up there on the side is the one that you can see in the photographs, just above station 2.||CDR-EVA|Yes. I think if I come up here, do a hard left turn; you unbuckle your belt, you'll roll right down into the bottom of Nansen.||LMP-EVA|I'm afraid you're right. ...||CC|Okay. And remember we're going to about 068 and about 7.4 will be station 2. At least that's our estimate.||LMP-EVA|Bob - -||CDR-EVA|Okay, there's Nansen over there, huh?||LMP-EVA|Well, I think so.||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|I think you're right. It's got to be it. Got to be it. Yes, Bob, I think we're into a breccia population now. I think the blocks in the light mantle are largely breccias. They're mottled in their characteristics. Their white zaps do not seem to be nearly as burned. They tend to be chalky when they get hit. At least, in the large craters, the walls are chalky looking. Oh, yes. We've got boulders in station 2.||||Tape 94A/16||||CDR-EVA|Yes, they're there. Yes, sir.||LMP-EVA|Boy, I tell you, if I hand on to this camera -until you stop and can tighten it up, it'll be a miracle.||CDR-EVA|Bob, how long have we been driving?||CC|Stand by. We estimate you've got about a kilometer and a half to go - a little over a kilometer, anyway. Stand by, we'll check on the time. You're doing great.||CDR-EVA|How long in - -||LMP-EVA|Man, this has been a trip.||CDR-EVA|Man, I tell you. You know, we're really up on top of this thing. Whoo!||CC|You guys have been driving 64 minutes, and that counts the time to stop and deploy the charge and pick up the Rover samples.||LMP-EVA|Hey, Bob. We're very clearly going downhill now, into the trough area that - that surrounds the Massif where - or between the mantle and the massif But the trough is much greater in extent than just Nansen scale. It's probably a kilometer wide. I never realized that it was so - so much of a depression in here.||CC|Okay. How about a range and bearing readout.||LMP-EVA|I'm not sure we're going to be able to see the LM.|05 19 56 35|CDR-EVA|074, 8.2, 6.9.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|We won't be able to see the LM from down here. We'll be too low to see it. Fact is, I don't think I can see that far.||||||Tape 94A/17||LMP-EVA|The surface patterns are still the same, Bob. The main difference being that we're getting probably a gradual increase in block population, and the blocks seem to be of a different character. They - they may be breccias.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|And around the crater here that's maybe 75 meters in diameter, the - there's probably 5 percent blocks - fragments, I should say - greater than a centimeter.||CDR-EVA|Boy, look at all the dust around that fender. I hate to think of what it would have been like with that fender gone.||LMP-EVA|Yes. There's a good-sized block, sort of blue-gray.||CDR-EVA|Looking up there, Jack, I ought to get some 500s looking right up that hill, but - -||LMP-EVA|Well, you may want to do that way out a way, a ways.||CDR-EVA|It's - some of that stuff is mantled - or buried in the massif material. Some of it just seems to be laying on it, of course.||LMP-EVA|Yes. Well, I think It has to do with how long it's been there. You'll tend to get the downslope movements forming uphill fillets, and that's what a lot of it looks like.||CDR-EVA|Most of it is uphill fillets. Most of it is pretty sharp. But my guess, from back at the LM, that those blocks on the massif were much more angular -I think is a good guess because that's what they look like to me here.||LMP-EVA|And looking up into our bluo-gray outcrop urea, 1 still have even more the impression that there's; u -a planier (?) orientation that dips off to the southeast - maybe just fracturing, but I - pretty clear up there, I think. It may - it may be shadows.||||Tape 94A/18|||05 19 58 51|CDR-EVA|The LM is now 50 percent away from the massif -let's see, 50 percent of the massif heigth away from the massif. How's that? I think we will keep that on top.||LMP-EVA|That is a high mountain.||CDR-EVA|Gemine Christmas!||LMP-EVA|Listen, if the Earth goes behind it, we're changing station 2. (Laughter) It'll be nip and tuck, pardon the expression. Okay. As we get closer, actually, we're out of the very - the block area. And that blocky region of 5 percent may have been just associated with that crater. I still see no lineations although - -||CDR-EVA|Look at these wrinkles, though, Jack - -||LMP-EVA|Yes. I mean on - I was talking about the mantle.||CDR-EVA|Oh.||LMP-EVA|But you're right about on the massif.||CDR-EVA|The same wrinkled lineations we saw trending -sloping uphill to the west on the eastern half of the massif are still very evident at this Sun angle.||CC|Okay, 17; And we're estimating that you should be there within - -||LMP-EVA|||CC|- - about 5 minutes to meet the walkback constraints||CDR-EVA|Well, we're - Bob, we're almost ready to park.||CC|Okay. Beautiful.||LMP-EVA|Well, I wouldn't have gone so far as to have said that.||CDR-EVA|Well--||LMP-EVA|We're getting close.||||||Tape 94A/19||CDR-EVA|I'll give them their 5 minutes. We'll make it by then.||LMP-EVA|Bob, the boulder tracks are really just chains of small craters, for the most part.||CC|Okay; copy that. That's interesting.||CDR-EVA|I don't think we can tilt that television - I don't think they can tilt the television camera high enough to see the top of the massif. Jack, we're on the edge here, but I don't know - Is that that - Well, let me go up here.||LMP-EVA|No, you're doing great.|05 20 01 08|CDR-EVA|Brazil 71s 8*95 and 7-4.||LMP-EVA|See, there's Nansen off to my right now.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I just want to make sure that I'm not driving down a hole here, which I am, but - I don't want to drive down Nansen.||LMP-EVA|No, I - you won't. The saddle - the end of Nansen is over there near those blocks. Right over there.||LMP-EVA|Look at those blocks. Unfortunately, the boulder tracks - good boulder tracks are over Into Nansen.||CDR-EVA|Going out of here very slowly.||LMP-EVA|I think station - just about anywhere near the big blocks - -||CDR-EVA|Yes - ~||LMP-EVA|- - would be a good station 2.||CDR-EVA|- - that's where I'm going to put It. We could try to -||LMP-EVA|Let's see.||CDR-EVA|Yes, that's where we're going to make station 2; right up there.||||Tape 94A/20||||LMP-EVA|What? Straight ahead?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Yes. Okay.||CDR-EVA|Boy* you're looking right into Nansen.||LMP-EVA|Yes. We're right where we wanted to be for station 2. It looks like a great place. Big blocks. It looks like quite a bit of variety from here. Different colors, anyway. Grays and lighter colored tans .||CDR-EVA|Hey, Jack, I'm going to do a 180 and park the Rover at 045||LMP-EVA|Those are two good - there's a blue-gray rock and a lighter colored tan rock.||CDR-EVA|See where they can look in here.||LMP-EVA|How about - Are you going to park it?||CDR-EVA|Right on the other side of this little crater. ... heading ...||CC|... heading.||CDR-EVA|... 45||CDR-EVA|Hey, Bob ... 04j ••• 9*1» 7*6. Are you reading, by the way?||CC|Roger. Reading you loud and clear.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Let me get undone here. Amp hours are 98, 98. Batteries are 90 and 112, and the motor forward left is OFFSCALE LOW, and right is 340. Forward rear is OFFSCALE LOW, and right is 2h0. I expect we've got a bad meter.||CC|Okay. Copy that on the 340. And you want to give me the bearing one more time there, Gene. All I got was the distance at 9-1 and the heading -and the range.||||||Tape 94A/21||CDR-EVA|Yes, sir. 0.1, 9-lj 7-6. We are right at station 2.||LMP-EVA|Look at Nansen,||CC|Okay. We copy that. When you're at the station, here's a couple of things - -||CDR-EVA|Five minutes - -||CC|- - we'1 like for you guys to look at in the overhead. In addition to them. We'd like the TV lens to be dusted, in addition to the regular dusting. That'll take the lens brush, remember.||LMP-EVA|Can you try to tighten that?||CC|You might check the low gain antella - antenna elevation to make sure it's at 45 degrees. We'd like -* we think you commented on. that, and I think you're right now looking at tightening Jack's camera handle.||LMP-EVA|I'll work on that, C-ene. You go ahead with the other - -|05 20 05 00|CDR-EVA|Okay. Yes, we are at i+5 degrees, Bob. Let me check It. I'll lose the comm on you a second. I've got to turn it towards me.||CDR-EVA|... at 045.||CC|And, 17- Jack, we'd like you to check the SEP for us. I suspect we'll have to turn it off and open the mirrors and dust them.||LMP-EVA|Boy, when you get this picture -|05 20 05 48|CDR-EVA|You got HIGH GAIN.||CC|Roger. Thank you. We have TV.||CC|Geno, we do not get a good bearing from you guys.||CDR-EVA|Oh, Manischewitz!||CC|We might also check the LMP's camera.||||Tape 94A/22||||CDR-EVA|Okay. I'll give it to you again.||LMP-EVA|That's fixed. Oh, you mean for pictures?||CC|Roger. ... - -||LMP-EVA|Okay, LMP -||CDR-EVA|0715 071 is the bearing.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|142 on LM - 142 on the LMP's camera. The temperature is 105-||CC|Roger. Let's turn off the power and the recorder, open the blankets, and dust it.|05 20 06 55|LMP-EVA|Power's off, blankets are open; and, Gene, you'll have to dust it.||CDR-EVA|I'll get it. I've got a lot of dusting to do here, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Let's see what we've got to do.||CC|And, Jack, I presume when I told you, you turned off the receiver, didn't you? Not just the DSEA?||LMP-EVA|That's affirm. I turned off both switches.||CC|That's what I thought. Thank you.||LMP-EVA|Oh, my scoop. My scoop just came off. That's interesting. I'd better check the rake. Vibrated loose, I guess.||CDR-EVA|I'll get the battery covers.||CC|Okay; and Jack, and we'd like to get an EMU check on you.||LMP-EVA|Stand by.||CC|And, Jack, we'd like to go to India on the magazine for you. Okay, magazine India. My goodness, we'll never get started.||||||Tape 94A/23||CDR-EVA|Man, we are down in a - Look at where we came down, Jack. And that was just one of the hills. Got to go back up and then down some. Hey, thank you for that fix on the fender, by the way, because I'd hate to see what it would look like without it.||CC|Okay. And John suggests that we might just check it momentarily while you're here to make sure it's still holding on good and tight. Both the clamps and the tape.||CDR-EVA|Yes, that's on my list. If it stayed on through that ride it may never come off. Okay. Have you got a lint brush in there, Jack?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Well, hold it a minute. I've got to get this SEP. Do you want me to brush the SEP, is that what you said?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Do you want the covers open?||LMP-EVA|They should be open and dusted.|05 20 09 54|CDR-EVA|Okay. The SEP Is open. It's about 100 degrees.||LMP-EVA|105 ...||CDR-EVA|105? Okay. And It's dusted.||LMP-EVA|Here's your lint brush; if you need it.||CDR-EVA|Okay, tharus you. That camera look all right to you? Let me get yours; lean over here, and I'll get yours. Okay. I'll get mine, too.||CC|And, Jack, we're suggesting that you're getting a little warm - maybe intermediate might help.||LMP-EVA|Bob, I feel the same way, but I want to get this camera fixed.||CC|Okay.||||Tape 94A/24||||LMP-EVA|I mean the film changed.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Can I change .. . ?||CC|Oh, thank you, Geno. It looks much better.||CDR-EVA|How about Any other service I can be?||LMP-EVA|Okay. Okay, Houston, the number of blocks plotted on the map are not nearly enough. In the greater than 1-meter range, there are many hundred blocks on the flank - on the massif flank of Nansen and up around station 2, where we are. There are only one or two blocks on the light mantle side of Nansen. It looks as if the material in the bottom of Nansen is overriding the light mantle materials of the north wall. That's just an impression. There's slightly lighter albedo than the north wall of Nansen.||CC|Okay. Copy that, Jack. Looks fantastic up there.||LMP-EVA|And I suggest that we - I suggest that we do our raking - That's right. I just told you everything you can see - fairly close to the Rover to get the front of the general population of talus material coming off the massif.||CDR-EVA|Bob, on my mark - I've got everything - hammer, gnomon, film. Okay.|05 20 12 51|CDR-EVA|MARK, If you have a gravimeter measurement going.||CC|Roger. Copy the mark.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob. The blue-gray rocks are breccias. They're multilithic, gray matrix - matrix breccias, I guess. There are fragments in them, but it doesn't look like more than about 10 or 15 percent fragments. Some of the light - the light-colored fragments seem to have fine-grained - very finegrained dark halos around them. The zap pits do not have white halos, so I suspect they are not crystalline. They might be glass - they might be the vitric or glassy breccias. At least, the one big rock we have here.||||||Tape 94A/25||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|There's a rough, very rough, foliation in them -that - that and I'm not sure - it's shown by the elongate knobs on the surface. It looks like a fracture foliation of some kind.||CDR-EVA|Jack, that rock has almost got to have come down, don't you think?||LMP-EVA|Oh, no question about it. I'll bet you - I'll bet you it's the same as the blue-gray rocks we see up higher. Here's some more blue-gray ones over here.||CDR-EVA|Let's - let's start taking - Oh, yes. Look at the size of some of these light fragments in here.||LMP-EVA|Yes, but it still - I don't - It looks like they're dominantly matrix breccias. There - there are light-colored fragments, and they may be crystalline.||CDR-EVA|- Okay - -||LMP-EVA|They are. They're very light colored; they look like the shattered anorthosites. They have white halos - I xhink that's what those fragments are.||CDR-EVA|Jack, let's get a piece of this one right here.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Biggest one here.||LMP-EVA|Get her up. This is the blue-gray variety, Houston.||CC|Okay. Copy on that.||CDR-EVA|I'm going to take that little knob off up there.||LMP-EVA|Okay; well, you can sample - you can work that block over - -||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|We can get several examples. We ought to sample across that layering, actually - that foliation.||||Tape 94A/26|||05 20 15 21|CDR-EVA|One comment. When you look down into the bottom of Nansen, it looks like - like, I guess - which sounds obvious - that some of the debris that has rolled off of the South Massif covers up the original material there that covers the north wall of Nansen. There is a distinct difference. You've got that very wrinkled texture in the north slopes of Nansen, and you've got the South Massif - debris In the south slopes of Nansen. And the debris, of course, overlays the - the north slope. And all the rock fragments , all the boulders that have come down are all on the west side of the - of the - correction, on the south side of the slope of Nansen.||CC|Okay; got that.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Houston. I take back what I said about no halos. There are light - not very sharply light -but light halos around zap pits in the matrix. The matrix glass is dark, and it seems to have a greenish cast; but it's very dark.||CDR-EVA|Oh, look at that blue.||LMP-EVA|Oh.||CDR-EVA|Look at the white fragments in there.||LMP-EVA|Let me come and help you there.||CDR-EVA|Man, there's some boulder rolling rocks here, Jack.||LMP-EVA|(Laughter) Okay, don't wreck the fillets. There's an overhang we've got to get into.|05 20 16 53|LMP-EVA|Okay. 514 is the - Okay, I'll take it back. On the fresh surface, these look like fragment breccias although the fragment size is fairly small. There are dark gray framgents and the light fragments we talked about. The gray ones are very fine grained and dense, although I see flashes that indicate they may be crystalline. The light-colored fragments are as I described them earlier, I think.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|514. ... - -||||||Tape 94A/P7||CC|Okay; Jack. If you could tear yourself away In the middle of that sometime to give us an EMU read-out, we'd appreciate it. We haven't gotten that from you yet on the EVA.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I'm - Stand by. Gene's got a rock to go. That's from up higher?||CDR-EVA|That's a little higher. See that shelf up there?||LMP-EVA|Okay. The first rock was from about a - 514 was from a meter above the base of the rocks; 515 is from about a meter and a half.||CDR-EVA|Here, can 1 get this in your -|05 20 18 05|LMP-EVA|Can you get some on either side of those two now?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Okay. You're open. I'll leave you open for a minute.||CDR-EVA|Well, okay. Just so they don't fall out. Am I in?||LMP-EVA|No. Let me get this other one.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Okay, go ahead.||CDR-EVA|Let me try from back here.||LMP-EVA|Of course, that's a north/south overhang.||CDR-EVA|Yes. That one?||LMP-EVA|Yes, you're facing right into the east.||CDR-EVA|Yes, yes. I don't know if I can get a piece back here or not.||LMP-EVA|How about right where you ... yes.||CDR-EVA|Right here? I can get that.||LMP-EVA|Yes, that's good.||||Tape 94A/28||||CDR-EVA|Oh, beautiful. Hit the gnomon.||CDR-EVA|Well, I'11 re - -||LMP-EVA|It didn't move. It just tilted it. This it?||CDR-EVA|Yes, that's it right there.||LMP-EVA|Let me set my working tool down here.||CDR-EVA|Got a bag?||LMP-EVA|Coming right up. Boy, that dust. Once you get It on there, you might as well forget it.||LMP-EVA|494. 494 is from a half a meter above the base of the rock.||CC|Understand, 0-5 meters up.||LMP-EVA|And these are samples from across the layering -or the - - These are samples from - across the -foliation. I missed that, Bob.||CC|Okay. Copy that now.||LMP-EVA|What do you think? Can you get that - can you get that one up there?||CDR-EVA|Yes. I might either get that or this other piece up here.||LMP-EVA|Well, don't take any chances.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I'm not going to. How about this one? Here's a whole big piece.||LMP-EVA|Okay. That's a good - good representative fragment. Can you get it?||CDR-EVA|I can't reach you without my camera hitting.||LMP-EVA|That's a football-size fragment. Okay, this next sample - Can you get a bag out, and we'll try to put it around it. Around the end. Bob, it's highly||||||Tape 94A/29|||variable. This is a light matrix breccia; whereas the other three fragments were dark-matrix or dark-fragment breccias. The big rock is a light-matrix breccia with dark fragments, and it's the one that has the halos around the - around the light fragments. And that's in 495s barely. It's not even in it. It's just - 495 is wrapped around it.|05 20 20 50|CDR-EVA|It's not going to stay.||LMP-EVA|It's not going to stay, is it?||CDR-EVA|No. Well -||LMP-EVA|It's a football-size fragmental rock. Let me -Why don't you just stuff it. See if you can stuff it in there with that - with the bag down - -||CDR-EVA|Yes, it'll - We'll be able to identify it when we get - 1+95 when we get back. Okay, It'll stay.||LMP-EVA|Is the bag on it now?||CDR-EVA|Well, yes, - it's ...||LMP-EVA|Great.||CC|Okay; we copy that, Gene. And do you guys see any tracks coming down to these boulders? Do have any feeling that these - you can place these that way?||LMP-EVA|Bob, unfortunately, no. The main tracks are out into Nansen, and we - I don't think we can get over there.||CC|Okay; that's those biggies that we see on the left, huh?||LMP-EVA|But the visual resi - Yes. Coming up, I was looking; and there are no obvious tracks coming down here.||CDR-EVA|Waich your shadow, Jack.||||Tape 94A/30||||LMP-EVA|Here, I'll get It. Wait a minute; that gnomon is probably not - Well, that's right; you got stereo earlier.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I reset it.||LMP-EVA|The gnomon was moved a little between the samples.||CC|Okay. We copy that.||LMP-EVA|Do you need to take a vertical pan?||CDR-EVA|Yes, I've gotten it all. I'm getting it all.||LMP-EVA|You getting the flight line? I'll get a flight line this way. Postsample, flight line.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. I'm on frame count 42.||CC|Copy, 42.|05 20 22 19|CDR-EVA|Did you get a locator from here, Jack?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I got flight line on the north/south trend; Gene got east/west.||CDR-EVA|You going to get that sample under there?||LMP-EVA|Yes, we got to get the soil.||CDR-EVA|There may be an overhang. And look at that frag -that rack - rock is fragmented; let's see, but it's east - it's southeast/northwest. There's a split.||LMP-EVA|Yes, that one right over there is okay. You want to get - hey, did you want to get this?||CDR-EVA|Yes, I'll get that.||LMP-EVA|This fillet?||CDR-EVA|You got it?||||||Tape 94a/31||CC|And, 17 - -||LMP-EVA|This is a fillet from underneath the rock.||CC|Roger. And an update on the rake samples when you get around to it. We'd like to get one up on the massif slope as much as you can, if you can get over to it. And then the second one down near the Rover.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob. This fillet is up underneath an overhang . I got it from about -||CDR-EVA|I got to get uphill from you.||LMP-EVA|It's about - -||CDR-EVA|That's good.||LMP-EVA|- - oh, a third of a meter under an overhand. And it's the upper 3 centimeters of soil.||CDR-EVA|And it's bag 496.||LMP-EVA|Wow let me get one out away from the overhand a little bit.||CDR-EVA|- Okay.||CC|Okay. You think that's permanent shadow?||LMP-EVA|And a one away from - - No.||CDR-EVA|No. It's facing east.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Okay. And a sample down to a depth of about 5 centimeters, about two-thirds of a meter from the -boulder - the south side - is in 497.||CC|Copy that.||||Tape 94A/32||||LMP-EVA|Now let me - let me get a skim sample, Geno.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I got to take a set of pictures after that, by the way. Show where they are.||LMP-EVA|I can piece them into my flight line stereo.||CDR-EVA|Okay. They were in both of the before pictures on those rocks.||LMP-EVA|Okay; about a centimeter deep - skim.||CDR-EVA|Careful. You're in a hole. Can you - you better come out.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Yes. Boy, that's hard on the hand even in 1/6 g.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|And that was - -||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|And I didn't park that Rover in a very good spot for them to watch what's going on, I guess; but that was the heading.||LMP-EVA|Oh, shoot. They're missing all of it.||CDR-EVA|We didn't work in the right spot; that's all.||CC|Every now and then we get a peek at you guys. But only every now and then.||CDR-EVA|Sorry, Bob.||LMP-EVA|Oh, - oh wait a minute.||CDR-EVA|You know, that's the way it happens||CC|Give sample bag number, please.||CDR-EVA|Okay. It's back on.||||||Tape 94A/33||LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob. I missed that. I didn't give it to you; but I think - well the next bag I take out, you can check the num - Well, wait a minute, I'll do it for you.||CC|No. That's okay. I suspect it's 498.||LMP-EVA|I'm almost positive It was 498.||CC|Okay. We'11 put that down.||LMP-EVA|Yes, I did, too.|05 20 26 13|LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob, the - looking at the blocks directly down-Sun, there are - the light gray, or the gray-matrix breccias seem to be fragments, or ... anyway, within the white-matrix breccias.||CC|Okay. I copy that.||LMP-EVA|And I got a couple pictures down-Sun to show that texture.||CC|Okay. And one thing we'd like to do would be to sample a variety of blocks, in terms of looking at differences in the blocks - from block to block.||LMP-EVA|Roger. We're going to do that. We're going after a gray - I mean a lighter-colored block, now. Are you going up there?||CDR-EVA|Yes .||CC|Okay, and if you're going up the massif, why don't we try and get the rake sample up there now. when you finish these rocks.||CDR-EVA|Hey, Jack - Jack, don't come up here unless you bring the rake. It's a long trip. Ho sense coming up here twice. I can go get this sample. I'd get the rake, If I were you. Don't walk back up twice.||LMP-EVA|Well, I don't - I'm not sure they're going Lo gain anything by coming up to the top.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||||Tape 94A/34||||LMP-EVA|You're not going to gain a thing, Bob.||CC|Stand by.||LMP-EVA|You're still on the talus. You guys - Oh, well. The rims of the small craters in the talus are -are softer than the - normal terrain. My foot goes in maybe 10 centimeters where normally it only goes in a centimeter.||CC|Okay. As long as it's above the break of the slope, Jack, we don't have to get very far up the slope.||LMP-EVA|That's right.||CC|And, Jack, if you're back at the Rover, how about giving us a grav reading when you - before you leave.||LMP-EVA|Because I'm late sampling, that's why. But I'll do it, anyway.||CC|Roger.|05 20 28 20|LMP-EVA|Okay, 670 155 201; 670 155 201.||CC|Okay. Copy that, Jack. Press on.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, I'm at another boulder up the slope here. It's - looks quite similar to the one we just sampled, except there is a lot of flake fractures on it. Won-uniform, nondirectional, -but quite - quite different, at least from that other rock, in terms of the fracture pattern. The texture looks to be quite similar. Boy, I’m glad I don't have to walk to the top of this thing.||LMP-EVA|Hey, look, Gene, on these rake samples, there is just no point in carrying a rake all the way up here - -||CC|Negative, Jack, as long as you're above the break - -||||||Tape 94A/35||LMP-EVA|- - because all we needed was a break in the slope.||CC|As long as you're above the break in the slope; that's right.||LMP-EVA|Well, that's all right. It's being done; but let's watch those kind of calls please.||CDR-EVA|They can't appreciate the - toughness of going up this slope, though. We can; we've got to tell them that.||LMP-EVA|Well, we did.||CC|Yes, that's what we were saying. Don't go above -just at the base of the break in the slope, Jack. Don't climb all the way up there with it.||LMP-EVA|Oh, relax.||CDR-EVA|Okay, we're all set, Bob. Wo problem ...||LMP-EVA|We want to get away from that big rock because it's probably shedding. Hey, that's a different rock, Gene.||CDR-EVA|Yes. Well, it looks like the same texture, but it's got that flaky fracture pattern all over it. I'm going to get a stereo while I'm at it.||LMP-EVA|Yes .||CDR-EVA|This ought to cover any samples I take off of that thing.||LMP-EVA|I'm going to get myself a zap of cold water.||CDR-EVA|Man, we've got to be a million miles away from the LM.||LMP-EVA|Okay, this is a crystalline rock, Houston. H'lj got nice white halos around the zap pits. The zap is - the zaps are not - dense black glass , but a dark greenish - very dark greenish-gray.||||Tape 94A/36||||CDR-EVA|Are those halos or fragments?||LMP-EVA|No, they're halos. Well, they are fragments, I think, also. But, right now, it's fairly crystalline, but it is heterogeneous. Matter of fact (laughter) there's a big fragment of a porphyry caught up in this thing, I think.||CDR-EVA|Did you get a locator, by any chance?||LMP-EVA|I haven't done a thing.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Well, I want to start taking some - -||LMP-EVA|Yes, we got to get some of that.|05 20 31 19|CDR-EVA|That's what I want. That's where I'm going right now.||LMP-EVA|And there's a chunk there we can get. That's a big fragment within this crystalline rock - -||CDR-EVA|Take a picture of that - -||LMP-EVA|- - inclusion.||CDR-EVA|Take a picture of that and then - and then - your locator, I'll get it.||LMP-EVA|Go ahead. I've got it.||LMP-EVA|Got it?||CDR-EVA|Yes, I've got it.||LMP-EVA|Beautiful. Looks like a porphyry.||CDR-EVA|Boy, it does look like a crystalline rock.||LMP-EVA|Looks like an anorthosite porphyry is what it looks like.||CDR-EVA|The ... has got the very large crystals in there. They're very - they're very reflective, elongated crystals.||||||Tape 94A/37||LMP-EVA|It's a relatively angular inclusion about - it's about a half a meter in size, and it's a square cross section. Well, it's irregular; but generally square cross section. It's in bag 516, and it looks like a - well it's a high feldspar rock. It may be an anorthositic gabbro, but it is - it does look like a porphyry.||CDR-EVA|There's a big chunk where I've got - I can't gr-t it out, though; it's burled in a rock - a very -oh, half an inch elongated - I can't see whether they are colorless or not, but they are certainly reflective crystals. See that up here? See right there?||LMP-EVA|Yes .||CDR-EVA|And then in the big rock, you've got massive things like this big - this big fragment here -that's 5 inches across.||LMP-EVA|Well, it - that may be a spall point, Gene, that's a lighter color, in general, because of a zap or something.||CDR-EVA|Let's get the - let me get some more samples of it.||LMP-EVA|Yes, we need to get some of the host rock here.||CDR-EVA|Okay. We'll get a piece here.||LMP-EVA|Okay now, you're still sampling the one we just got. So we'11 get another one.|05 20 33 42|LMP-EVA|Okay. The same kind - or the contact of that rock looks very much - looks like it might be finer grained - but it's about the same - in 517-That's the contact in the - the inclusion side of the contact. Keep going after the other one, Gene, I'll get this in you - your bag.||CDR-EVA|Bob, you could probably see this rock if you look over this way. We're high enough.||||Tape 94A/38||||CC|Yes, we saw it, Geno. Quite a sight - quite a goodie.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Let me see if I can't get this one here. There it is.||LMP-EVA|Okay. The host rock for the inclusion, which appears to be also crystalline but may be a recrystallized rock of some kind - -||CDR-EVA|Can't see it too well.||LMP-EVA|- - metamorphic - also looks like a high plagioclase - high feldspar, anyway. That's in bag 518 - and that was a loose frag - fairly loose but in place fragment along the fracture zone.||CC|Okay. - -||CDR-EVA|Will you hold this a minute? I'm going to try to get the rest of it up there.||CC|Okay, 17. And for your thinking In the next few minutes, you might also factor in the guestion the backroom raises about taking 10 minutes out station 4 and adding it into this station, given the wealth of interest that seems to be occurring here. You might think about that. You never -haven't been to station 4, so it's a little hard to judge. But if you think 10 minutes can be very profitably spent, you might as well do that.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob, we'll think about It. This is a medium-green anorthositic gabbro, and it looks like it has some pastel-green allophane (?) crystals in it. Did you get it?||CC|We copy that.||CDR-EVA|I can't get any more of it, Jack, up there. I can't reach any more.||||||Tape 94A/39||LMP-EVA|Okay, and that small chip of that is in 519- It's the same host - rock, much like the previous sample||CDR-EVA|There's a good sample for you.||LMP-EVA|Okay. And another - chunk of the host -||CDR-EVA|Oops, be careful.||LMP-EVA|Yes .||CDR-EVA|It's still there.||LMP-EVA|Yes, I've got it. I need to get rid of this - -||CDR-EVA|Okay?||LMP-EVA|It's in there. I haven't closed your bag yet. And we've got to get a - get one soil sample up the hill here. Oh, we didn't get the rake -||CDR-EVA|We ought to get a soil sample, though, up here, so - -||LMP-EVA|We'll get the rake sample right over here on this slope.||CDR-EVA|Where did that thing go, Jack?||LMP-EVA|Right here.||CC|Okay. Was that last sample in 518, as well?||CDR-EVA|There It is. That's it right there.|05 20 36 31|LMP-EVA|Wo. We haven't put it in yet.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Bob, that will go In 499?||CC|Copy that.||||Tape 94A/40||||CDR-EVA|You get it?||LMP-EVA|Okay. Bob, this is a fairly uniform-looking rock. It does have some - widely spaced fractures across It. It's - clearly crystalline and has crystalline Inclusions in it.||CDR-EVA|Heyt Jack - -||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Might get the soil from around that thing.||LMP-EVA|Both rocks look like they might be in the anorthositic :lass - -||CDR-EVA|Your bag is still open part way, too.||LMP-EVA|- - of rocks. It's just that it - one is - has the appearance of being a por - finer grain matrix. Looks like a porphyry in - In the boulder||CC|Okay. And a reminder, as you photograph it, to remember that the photograph in the southwest quadrant there will be the best ones. Around the corner on two sides there will be the best ones to show the structure through the whole rock.||LMP-EVA|Yes, sir. On the southwest?||CDR-EVA|South and west.||CC|Roger.||LMP-EVA|South and west. Yes.||CC|Roger.||LMP-EVA|No, the west's in shade. No, no. You mean the -||CC|Southwest -||LMP-EVA|South and east.||||||Tape 94A/41||CC|Roger. The southwest face - or it faces not quite south.|05 20 37 59|CDR-EVA|Okay. I've got a stereo - I'll just continue my stereo around here. Hey, Jack, you can get way under there, and I know you could get soil. I don't know how long it's been shadowed, but it';' been shadowed as long as this rock's been here.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I'll do that.||CDR-EVA|Way out under there.||LMP-EVA|I've got to stereo this one.||CDR-EVA|I've already got it.||LMP-EVA|Well, I'm getting it from this way, and they like that. Did we kick any dirt in under there?||CDR-EVA|No. I don't - no, I don't think so. Go way down in there. Let me get a couple of after pictures. Yes, we want to get two sides of these rocks, and you can see their structure.||LMP-EVA|I've got that, Gene.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|I took those. I took that stereo.||CC|Okay, and if I could remind you guys to get a pan from up there before you leave the high uphill area there. There's no point in climbing up there twice. Remember?||CDR-EVA|Yes, sir, Bob. How much time we got here now?||CC|Stand by.||LMP-EVA|Okay. You got your bag?||||Tape 94A/42||||CC|Okay. We got 12 or 13 minutes left at this station; unless you take that extra 10 minutes that we were offering you.||CDR-EVA|Let's take it, Bob.||LMP-EVA|We got to get the rake.||CDR-EVA|Let's take it; we'll need it.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Let me try again.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|I don't know whether I can or not.||CDR-EVA|Do you know how far under you're getting, by any chance?||LMP-EVA|Yes. I got in a - I got under an east-west overhang about - 20 centimeters - way back - By the way, ... It goes even farther, but that's about as far as I can reach back there now.||CDR-EVA|That's enough, Jack let me -||CC|Okay. I copy that.||LMP-EVA|That's in bag 500.||CC|And, 17, if you want to take a minute, you might look up in the sky and notice that our camera is taking a beautiful picture of Mother Earth.|05 20 40 10|CDR-EVA|Isn't that pretty over - Can you see the Massif, too?||CC|Now we're coming down to look at the massif. Isn't that a beautiful picture of the Pacific there? Ed finally found It. Now we see the massif.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|And, Bob, I took an after picture of - of where Jack just got that soil sample under the rock from; and I'm on 60.||||||Tape 94A/43||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Are you through with the gnomon?||CDR-EVA|Yes .||LMP-EVA|I'll set it up for the rake.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I'll go up there and get a pan, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Y ou get that pan - -||CC|I - didn't get that soil bag number, Gene - Jack.||CDR-EVA|We've been here - -||LMP-EVA|500 .||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|We're on a pretty good slope, Geno.||CDR-EVA|You bet you. And do I know it. Hey - Bob, how long have we been at this station?||CC|Stand by. You've been here about 40 minutes right now. Can you believe it?||CDR-EVA|No, I - Is that - all ready? Jack - -||CC|And we're going to give you that extra 10 minutes there.||CDR-EVA|I can't believe we've been here.||CC|That leaves you about 20 minutes; then you'll have to be moving.||CDR-EVA|Boy, this pan may be looking - Okay. This pan may be looking right smack in the sides of the Massifs. Only way you can get it is to lean back - and 1 can't lean downhill.||CC|Hey. Watch out for that crater behind you there, Geno.||CDR-EVA|I'm standing in the crater so I can get level.||||Tape 94A/44||||CC|Yes, we see that.||CDR-EVA|Well, I have some good pictures of Nansen, anyway, and -|05 20 42 28|CDR-EVA|You know, I look out there, I'm not sure I really believe it all.||LMP-EVA|Bob, my down-Sun pictures on the rake were taken at f/8. I'm sorry.||CC|Okay, copy that ... We'll take it into account.||CDR-EVA|This isn't an easy -||LMP-EVA|Okay, I got to get out of my shadow or I can't see what I'm doing.||CDR-EVA|I'll be right down there to bag that rake for you.||LMP-EVA|I got to get it first.||CDR-EVA|(Laughter) Man, I tell you; can you come downhilJ in a hurry. Going uphill is a nice job. Bob, I'd say we can meet our walkback constraints, if anyone's Interested.||CC|Okay. I expect it's all downhill from here.||CDR-EVA|Well, no, sir. Not exactly.||CC|Can you guys see the LM or are you down too far to see the LM?||CDR-EVA|... our walkback constraints. Oh, no. The LM is over about three rises In the Scarp before we can even see it.||CC|Okay, I thought that might have happened.||CDR-EVA|You're looking -I'm not even at a lev -I'm not even at a level of the last - the last hill we came over.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|I don't know if you've looked up that way.||||||Tape 94A/H5||CC|Roger. We had a feeling for that. I was just cheeking.||CDR-EVA|We can meet them, but I wouldn't stretch them.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Not many small walnut-sized fragments in here, Bob. Gotten about seven or eight.||CC|Okay. I copy that.||LMP-EVA|Gene, you got a bag?||CDR-EVA|Yes, sir. Right here. How you doing?||LMP-EVA|My hands are getting tired.||CDR-EVA|Yes. Bag 501.||CDR-EVA|No, there aren't a lot; but that'll fill up a bag.||LMP-EVA|This kilogram of sample site 2?||CDR-EVA|I'll have to look; I think so. I think they all are, aren't they? Practically.||CC|And this is the one that we would like to get the kilogram of soil from, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I'll use my scoop for that.|05 20 45 27|CDR-EVA|Bag 501.||CC|Copy that, Gene.||LMP-EVA|Okay, what do we have left here?||CDR-EVA|We want to get a - I got the high pan.||CDR-EVA|Okay, let me look. They want it - -||LMP-EVA|I don't know how we used up all the time, but we did.||CDR-EVA|Okay, my pan. by the way - I got extensive vertical coverage down into Nansen, Bob.||||Tape 94A/46||||CC|Okay. Copy that, Gene. Thank you.||LMP-EVA|... getting to my ...||CDR-EVA|I don't know where the hour went that it took to drive here.||LMP-EVA|Maybe time's different in space. Adventures in space and time.||CDR-EVA|We changed 2 hours and 40 minutes. I don't know whether that makes us older or not, but - -||LMP-EVA|Ooops -||CDR-EVA|Awrrrrrr -||LMP-EVA|Try again. I got half of it. I got three-quarters of it.||CDR-EVA|502, Bob, will be the kilogram.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|And that's sample down to about 5 - about 4 centimeters - Don't get too close to the camera. Okay.||CDR-EVA|Oh, that's a big bag full. Want to put it in mine?||LMP-EVA|It's all right. I can't feel It. You might as well -||CDR-EVA|How's your cooling, okay?|05 20 46 55|LMP-EVA|Cooling's fine. My hands are tired.||CDR-EVA|Ye s, that's natural.||LMP-EVA|Okay, ...||CC|Okay. And guys - do you see any more different blocks up there that are worth sampling before you go on down on to the flats and sample the light mantle?||||||Tape 94A/47||LMP-EVA|We haven't had a chance to look around any more than you've heard.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|You want a rake and a light mantle here?||CC|We want a rake and a light mantle. You might as well get that down by the Rover - later on and -||LMP-EVA|Get an after - get an after, Gene. Gene, get an after.||CDR-EVA|Yes. Got it, got it, got it, got It.||CC|Then you might look around - -||LMP-EVA|I'm sorry, Bob. Go ahead.||CC|- - ... documented samples there - up on the slope of the massif, before you move down the flatter light mantle areas by the Rover. Just do the other sampling.||LMP-EVA|We - we will.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. Jack got the befores on the rake and I got the after.||CC|Okay; we have that.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, here are two rocks side by side, a meter or two in diameter. And one is the anorthositic gabbro, If I can use the term; and the other Is the - is that two-cycle breccia.||CDR-EVA|Man, that's the way to come downhill.||LMP-EVA|Just don't stub your toe.||CDR-EVA|Yes, that's the way to come downhill.||LMP-EVA|Hey, Gene.||CDR-EVA|Yes .||||Tape 94A/48||||LMP-EVA|Set up right there. Let's get that - let's get that big clast.||CDR-EVA|There's a fram - a fracture right in there I want to get near. Oh, the clast. Yes.||LMP-EVA|Yes, sir.||CDR-EVA|Good eye, good eye.||LMP-EVA|Big white clast - in the two-cy - in the gray-mat rix breccia.||CDR-EVA|Good eye. Man, that's a prize. Let me get this over here so I can ...||LMP-EVA|I think you can even get it.||CDR-EVA|I can get both sides. I want to get this big -Yes, I think I can get that. I'm going to try. Oh. I can't believe the trouble I have with f-stops.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|I'm going to try to take this piece off first.||LMP-EVA|Pretty hard, isn't it? That boulder's going to roll.||CDR-EVA|Man, that is hard. There's the same clast over there.||LMP-EVA|Well, we get - -||CDR-EVA|That clast Is soft.||LMP-EVA|Can you use your - your blade end?||CDR-EVA|Yes. Yes, let me get that little piece, anyway, to start with. Got it. There's two more pieces.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Before we cover them up, let's get them.||CDR-EVA|I got to get a sample of that mother rock.||LMP-EVA|Okay, there you go.||||||Tape 94A/49||CDR-EVA|The other one's right there.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Now, I'm going to see if I can't get a sample -||LMP-EVA|Want to try to hit that one more time. I think we've got another one coming there. There's another little one.||LMP-EVA|That looks almost like a rhyolite from here. I don't believe it, though.||CDR-EVA|No, that's not - -|05 20 50 16|LMP-EVA|I think that's it. Got a bag? Okay, this is a fine-grained - but crystalline white clast - in the gray breccia; and It's mixed with soil. We had to pick up a little soil. 503.||CDR-EVA|I guess they're all there, aren't they?||LMP-EVA|I think they are. There are three clasts, anyway -or three fragments that we got off.||CDR-EVA|Chips. Let me get a piece of the rock it's in. And I'm going to take a closeup stereo of that.||LMP-EVA|Okay, don't get It - Okay.||CDR-EVA|See it?||LMP-EVA|Yes. See it? You hit me with it.||CDR-EVA|Well - -||LMP-EVA|I tried to catch it.||CDR-EVA|Bob, you still there?||CC|Roger. Still there. Listening with great delight.||CDR-EVA|I believe ... the piece that came off there, though, Jack.||LMP-EVA|I got another piece of it up here.||||Tape 94A/50||||CDR-EVA|And I'd roll that downhill - -||LMP-EVA|Okay, the - the host rock for that - that inclusion of white material will be in bag - What is it?||CDR-EVA|504.||LMP-EVA|504. Two chips with soil. Okay.||CDR-EVA|Getting heavy?||LMP-EVA|What? The bag?||CDR-EVA|Yes .||LMP-EVA|No. Just the scoop.||CDR-EVA|Just make sure they're closed so they don't - -||LMP-EVA|I wore my hand out holding that camera together coming out here.||CDR-EVA|We're getting some samples this time. I want to get a far - an after, and I want to get a closeup stereo of that. And I'm going to get some pictures around this block, too.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|There's an after and now I'm going to get - sort of a closeup stereo around it. That ought to do it.|05 20 52 18|LMP-EVA|Hey, Bob, while he's doing that, there's a real good example of pit-bottom crater up here even on this talus slope. I'll try to take a stereo of it.||CC|Okay, Jack, that sounds great. I guess there's always a problem of getting the in-place, glass, if you think that's appropriate at this point. Word along those lines, though, is we'd like your Rover moving in 11 minutes; so it's probably not appropriate at this time on that.||||||Tape 94A/51||LMP-EVA|Okay, there isn't any glass in this - this crater -you can see It with your TV.||CC|Okay; copy that.||LMP-EVA|It's just bigger - it's bigger than the average crater. And it still has that pit, the pit being about a third of the diameter of the - the inner diameter of the crater - third of the - make it a fourth of the rim diameter, that's easier.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Jack, can I look - can I look at that closely?||LMP-EVA|Look at what?||CDR-EVA|Hold the rake a second. We got to be moving in how many minutes , Bob?||CC|We'd like to have you moving in 10 minutes, which means - allow about, you know, the - the usual 3 or 4 or 5 minutes for closeout - before that time.||CDR-EVA|Okay, we'll get hustling.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob. That white-colored inclusion we sampled looks like a strange -||CDR-EVA|Look out, Jack.||CC|It's the old boulder-rolling trick.||CDR-EVA|How about getting a soil sample under there?||CC|Don't hit the Rover.||CDR-EVA|Get that - get that sample under there, Jack. Under that rock.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Got a bag?||CDR-EVA|Got a bag.||||Tape 94A/52|||05 20 54 12|LMP-EVA|The soil from right underneath the rock - down to about 4 centimeters - in 505- And I'll try to skim it here a little, too. Get the upper -centimeter.||CDR-EVA|Bob, this big white clast - I'm not sure there aren't - some smaller ones in some of those other big boulders. That's just an intuitive guess.||LMP-EVA|Oh, there are.||CDR-EVA|But we never saw any as obviously big, as gross as this one. Such as this particular boulder I photographed, I had three of them other than the one we sampled. And that's 505 - and 506, in that order.||CC|Okay; we copy that.||CDR-EVA|On the - -||CC|And by now, probably the best thing for you guys - -||LMP-EVA|Bob, that rock - -||CC|- - to do is to go back to the Rover and pick up the rake samples. Go ahead, Jack.||LMP-EVA|That--||CDR-EVA|I'll get it.||LMP-EVA|Okay. That rock - that clast - white clast - I looked at It, and it has a light, pastel-green -fairly rounded crystals in a fine-grained white to light pinkish-tan matrix. And you can figure that one out. Looks like olivine and something.||CC|Roger on that. Sounds like a rainbow.||LMP-EVA|It might be a - No, it's not those - the colors aren't that distinct, Bob. I was just giving you shader;.||CC|Okay; Roger.||||||Tape 94A/53||CDR-EVA|Hey, Bob, have you panned - down into Hansen and seen this rock that's - oh, 30 or 40 meters from us? To give you an idea of the kind of upslope filleting you have on some of those boulders.||CC|Okay, we'11 - -||CDR-EVA|It's down to your right.||CC|Okay. We'll send Ed over there to look at it.||LMP-EVA|Yes, I'll help him.||CDR-EVA|I don't think you got enough time.||CC|Okay, we'd like you guys to get going on the rake sample. We'd like a handle on the rake there.||LMP-EVA|Okay, I'm going to have to move out here a ways, Geno.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Coming right there.||CDR-EVA|Right there is what I'm looking at.||CC|Okay. We're going to check it out; thank you.||CDR-EVA|And there's no sense trying to get 500's up. Well - Let's see what happens.||CC|Okay. Also, we're running out of - there's no time to get 500's either, unfortunately. We're planning on station 4, which will be a better perspective distance anyway.||LMP-EVA|Yes, I was going to say there's no sense in trying to get them up the massif; I don't think you'll see anything up there.||CC|Okay.||||Tape 94A/54|||05 20 57 22|LMP-EVA|Gene. You getting your pan?||CDR-EVA|Yes. I said where do you want it?||LMP-EVA|Well, right over there where there's some fragments . And you get the -||CDR-EVA|I'll get the before and the locator.||LMP-EVA|Okay, and then I'll get the down.||LMP-EVA|Okay. (Laughter) ... to take pictures.||CDR-EVA|Yes. Let me tell you, you just got to think an order of magnitude bigger than what you're normally are accustomed to thinking.||LMP-EVA|Okay, pan's complete.||CDR-EVA|Let's get the rake sample so we can move on. Bob, I couldn't get those 500's anyway. It would require me to pitch up too far, and there's no way I could do it.||CC|Okay. No, we're definitely not in favor of that, Gene, at this area.||CDR-EVA|I know, I'm just mulling It over, but there really isn't any way I could get them.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Boy, I tell you -|05 20 58 53|CDR-EVA|How are your hands? Let me rake that a little bit.||LMP-EVA|Well, it's all right; there just aren't any rocks. Should have brought the scoop and used the old shovel trick.||CDR-EVA|There's a couple, keep going. There sure aren't, are there?||||||Tape 94A/55||CC|Okay, do you have any feeling - do you have that hard layer underneath there like you did yesterday, when you raked at station 1, Jack?||CDR-EVA|There's one under the gnomon you can get.||LMP-EVA|Several I thought were rocks turned out to be clods.||CDR-EVA|Yes, that's what most of them are is clods. How do you get clods if it's never been wet? You're not getting any. You've had three in there ever since the last four scoops.||LMP-EVA|There just aren't many.||CDR-EVA|507.||CC|Okay, copy 507 5 very few.||CDR-EVA|Three rocks. Yes, you got about four rocks -about 2 inches and smaller.||LMP-EVA|And let me get the down-Sun which - -||CC|Okay, let's just get the soil and press on. We'd like to move in 3 minutes, 3 minutes.||CDR-EVA|Okay, you got it?||LMP-EVA|Yes .||CDR-EVA|Okay. Let me put this in your bag and . . . we'll forget the soil.||LMP-EVA|Forget the soil?||CDR-EVA|He wants us moving in 3 minutes. So let's go.||LMP-EVA|Well -||CC|No, get the soil, guys. Get the soil. Don't, forget the soil; get the soil.||LMP-EVA|Yes, we want it.||CDR-EVA|I'm sorry, I thought you said to skip it.||||Tape 94A/56||||CDR-EVA|Got your bag?||LMP-EVA|Yes. May be a little messy.||CDR-EVA|That's all right.||LMP-EVA|One-scoop-Schmitt, they call me.||CDR-EVA|That's good. That's bag 508.||CC|Copy that.|05 21 00 50|CDR-EVA|You'll have to start putting some of these samples in my bag. You're getting a full bag for Christmas here.||LMP-EVA|Is it so full we ought to change it?||CDR-EVA|Yes. Let's do that after we get to the next station, though.||LMP-EVA|Well - okay.||CDR-EVA|We ought to start moving out of here.||LMP-EVA|Yes, let's go.||CDR-EVA|Let me get one after of the area that we messed up.||CC|Beautiful station, guys; just simply beautiful. Almost deserves a Falcon code.||LMP-EVA|Man, I'll tell you. (Laughter) Falcon 109- I couldn't help that, Bob; it's just too beautiful.||CDR-EVA|Hey, Jack, will you look where we kicked up this stuff. There's some light - the light - well, I can't see It now, I'm looking in - -||LMP-EVA|I can see. There's a light-colored fragment I think we break into.||CDR-EVA|Yes, we kick it up.||LMP-EVA|They are light-colored clods.||||||Tape 94A/57||CDR-EVA|And when I was walking uphill, I really wasn't sinking in probably more than an inch or two.||LMP-EVA|Why don't you - can you - want to take this bag off of me?||CDR-EVA|Yes, sir.||LMP-EVA|I'll get one out. We can use this one.||CDR-EVA|Yes. Because we want to get rolling.||CC|Okay, 17, there's a couple of things here, while your getting undone there. There's our housekeeping to close out. Change those bags. We'd also like to get the SEP turned on, and you might read us the temperature when you turn it on. And other than that, stowing the TV and low gain antenna and you're on your way. We've taken care of the gravimeter already.||CDR-EVA|What did it - did our reading change much, Bob?||CC|Which one?||LMP-EVA|Make sure that's locked on there.||CDR-EVA|Yes, it is locked; make sure the cap's locked. Okay, bag 8 Is on the gate, and Jack's getting bag 4.||CC|Okay; copy that. Copy that.|05 21 03 00|CDR-EVA|Boy, I know my camera's going to be - -EUD OF TAPE||||||Tape 94B/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|05 21 30 12|CMP|Houston, it's coming in. Rooster Tail ... - Yes, dark striations, vertical - ***tion up and down the a - area rim. And it looks like there's a black - but they all look green. You know, it looks kind of a green-gray in this type of light, back on this side. And a green-gray material down in the center of the Rooster Tail, on the floor of the Rooster Tail. And the floor is about one-fourth of the diameter. Turn this thing off -60 - minus Peirce, scale 250, 8-second inter-valometer, and I lost my intervalometer. Count 8 seconds, I guess. Stuck it around here and it disappeared. Nothing.||CC|Ron, this is your friendly inter - intervalometer speaking, can I help you?||CMP|(Laughter) Okay. Let's see, we're about 159 -I'm going to take two more pictures on this frame, and finish it up on Lima Lima, huh? Off to the north. Maybe it's got 160, I'll keep it.|05 21 34 12|CMP|Okay, Lima Lima is on l6l. I don't know how many's left. It says 160 on it, still going, but -|05 21 34 24|CMP|Mike Mike is starting with number 1.||CC|Mike Mike, number 1. Roger.||CC|Ron, just for your information, we're not going to give you a TEI-49 pad or a state vector this pass. We're going to give it to you at the beginning of the next pass. We want to refine our data a little bit.||CMP|Oh, okay. Hey, I found the intervalometer, stuck under the seat - between the web and the - the metal part. ... that.|05 21 35 54|CMP|250 lens on there.||||Tape 94B/2||||CMP|Okay. (Singing) Okeytedokeyte. Let's see now. ... 8, ... 50, ... 88 frames - take lots of pictures. Here's frame 160 on Lima Lima. And now configure camera. Okay, Peirce ... that ... and then mag QQ's standing by (whistling).|05 21 38 48|CC|How'd the photos go, going right across Arabia there, on this last - little bit of go, Ron?||CMP|Okay. Yes, those were good. You can - you can kind of see the topographic rise in the Saenger area especially, it's a little bit higher to the west of Saenger than to the east. But you can still see a general rise in that area.||CC|Roger.||CMP|You get a kind of a hint of the - the second ring of Arabia.||CC|Real good, Ron. We need to get the battery A -terminate the charge on battery A.|05 21 39 39|CMP|Okay, BATT CHARGER, OFF. And A looks about 37 volts. RELAY BUS is going CLOSED.||CMP|... of a time to lose my map.||CMP|(Singing) There it is.||CMP|Okay. This is on the pan camera photos. When you want to start looking at something, look for a small - Okay, just to the east of Abul Wafa, there's a small crater. About - oh, he must be about 2 to 400 meters in diameter. And he's got a black strip right on the western wall - going down - going down the western wall of the crater. It doesn't look like the strip extends beyond the rim at all; just down inside the crater wall. Also next to a - Now I forgot where I was.||CC|What was that najne of that crater with the black wall there; where - where was it near again?||CMP|Well, it's right near Abul Wafa on the first ring of Arabia.||||||Tape 94b/3||CC|Okay.||CMP|And I think that ought to be up in - should show up in the pan camera.||CC|Okay, good. Good show. You notice the swirls right near Abul Wafa?|05 21 4l 58|CMP|Yes, I really saw them that time. And where the swirls, they really show up, are about a crater diameter from Firshov - crater diameter to the west. And I talked about it on the tape. But, basically they're kind of concentric swirls in that area with light and dark. And the contrast between the light and dark is - is something tremendous. The dark is not a mare dark - tan, but it comes real close to it.||CC|Real good. Ron, you're coming up within a minute of this or a couple minutes of this orbital science photo of Peirce starting at - in the Sea of Cr -Crisium and going through Peirce in that area.||CMP|Okay. Let's see that ought to be out window 3. We are going to stay f/8 all the way across with this one, huh?||CC|Wo, it says f/8 at start. And then according to the Flight Plan, you change to f/5-6 and you'll change that at about Macrobius A. And then you'll go to 1/125 right at the Littrow area.|05 21 43 31|CMP|Okay. ... do I want to jump to f/ll going across those highlands, huh? At - on the western edge of Crisium?||CC|Well, see, f/8 - 1 shows f/8 on the map all the way across Crisium, starting at f/8 and using f/8 all the way across Crisium.||CMP|Okay. Let's see there's Picard X, so we should start in here somewhere.||CC|Yes, it's those rilles or whatever you call - rilles I guess, to the north of the Picard X is where you start.||||Tape 94B/4||||CMP|Okay, me get a shot of those - oh, come on ... longer. Okay, we started it, ... then about 10 [?] time.|05 21 44 54|CMP|Okay. There is absolutely no color variation on these flow fronts or scarps, or - By golly, flow fronts, looks to me like. Just looking north, right from the Picard X.||CC|Roger. You'd call them flow fronts and -||CMP|Well, flow front, or - or I've hardly even, it's -let me see they're bright on the high side, as you're looking north. You know, they're - they're bright on the high side. I would presume they kind of run east and west.||CC|Roger. According to the map, they're just exactly east and west.||CMP|~ - ... inside of them. Yes.||CC|Your photo path goes directly between Peirce and Pease - Peirce Bravo. And then leads up toward Peirce Charlie just a little bit north of Peirce Charlie.||CMP|Okay.|05 21 46 21|CMP|Well, Peirce Charlie has really got some black lines going down, vertical down them.||CC|You talking about inside the crater, black vertical lines inside the crater?||CMP|Yes, inside the crater. And it also looks like it carries on across. As I get a little bit closer, I'll see if it carries on across or not. This can't be shadow. You can still see the darker ennuius around - Peirce. Peirce Bravo's also got a dark annulus around it. In Peirce Bravo has only - goes out to about a half a crater diameter, though.||CC|Roger.||||||Tape 94B/5||CMP|Well, you know Peirce Charlie looks like - the sides of the South Massif, almost. Look down in that. In other words, it is kind of highly eroded, elongate crater.||CMP|... are all vertical; you know, I don't - I don't -vertical is the only way I know how to describe them. They point toward the - you know, radial -they point radial, but they all point toward the middle of the crater.||CC|Roger.||CMP|Does that make sense? (Laughter)||CC|We will try to salve them out. Yes, that makes sense, Ron.||CMP|Okay.||CMP|Peirce Charlie was right In the middle of a little framelet there. South of Microbius, huh?||CC|Yes, just a little bit south of Mic - Macrobius there. Lay it on the edge of it actually, and on the nor - southern edge of Macrobius.||CMP|Okay.||CC|As you get up ahead, between the contact line between the mare and the highlands at Macrobius Alfa, is where you'll change to 5*6.||CMP|Okay.|05 21 49 54|CMP|Hey, do we go north of Macrobius Alfa?||CC|Boy, it looks like you just, yes, you're north of Macrobius Alfa. That's affirm. You're even just a little bit north of Macrobius Bravo.||CMP|Yes, that's ... what I mean ... Macrobius 3ravo. Boy, it's a beautiful - between Macrobius 3ravo and Macrobius there is a beautiful - ray excluded -what you call it - butterfly! Little butterfly -about a 1000-meter crater.||||Tape 94B/6||||CC|Roger.||CMP|Got him (laughter). 5-6.||CMP|You know this - -||CC|Okay, you ought to be changing 5-6.||CMP|Okay. Let's see about 5 - Now here again is where Sun angle may make a little bit of difference on the thing. But this kind of a hummocky, well, close to sculptured-hill-type of material that we are flying over between Proclus and Macrobius A and B, doesn't look at all like the Sculptured Hills in the landing site area, next to - In other words, all along the edge of Crisium, or the edge of Serenitatis you have the sculptured-hills effect that have the vertical, dark lineations'in it. These vertical, radial or whatever you want to -lineations, striations, I guess, dark striations are not apparent under the western edge of Crisium at all. Where does this come out by the landing site? North of the landing site?|05 21 52 16|CC|Roger. You're quite a bit north of the site. You are over Li - Littrow. In fact, you're north of Littrow.||CMP|Over Littrow?||CC|You're north of Littrow.||CMP|Okay, we're to get the Littrow ...||CC|Okay, when you cross into the mare on Serenity there, after Littrow, you want to change to 1/25.||CMP|... 25; okay. So that'll be -|05 21 54 26|CC|And, Ron, this is camera path ends at Bessel A -Bessel Alfa in the Sea of - in Serenity -Serenitatis.||CMP|Okay. Okay, let's see, that's beyond the rilles out there. Let's see, it's quite a - in the midale isn't it - way out there. Okay.||||||Tape 94B/7||CC|Yes, you cross those east-west - east-west running rilles there in Serenitatis and then get right up to the Bessel.||CMP|Okay.||CMP|Well, I don't think that scarp could be a flow front across there, but It sure does look like it. The thing that changes your mind about it being a flow front is that it goes up to North Massif. I couldn't see any real continuation. It looks like there's two possible continuations on a south side and the South Massif. I'll have to take another look at that the next time around.||CC|Okay, HIGH GAIN to AUTO when you get a chance there, Ron. And you got to switch over for this terminator photo P29 Charlie on Sulpicius Gallus.||CMP|Okay.|05 21 57 18|CMP|Okay. Serenitatis Sulpicius Gallus, huh?||CC|Roger. You get - -||CMP|Two of 500.||CC|And then f/ll on the mountains right behind, right to the west of Sulpicius Gallus. That's using a 250-millimeter.||CMP|Okay. These are 250 m - 250, f/22. Okay, and it's mag Quebec Quebec, starting at 79-||CC|Got it, starting at 79- Roger.||CMP|Got six and one - yes, which window was the -||CC|I don't have my friendly helper here or I could give it to you.||CMP|There's the ones that's going to be ... (laughter).||CC|CM-5 is what we think.||CMP|... seeing it out of window 3.||||Tape 94B/8||||CC|Try CM-5, Ron.||CMP|And - Yes, that CM-5 is ... Okay, about six of them around Sulpicius Gallus there. There's 22 to 500.||CC|Okay. Get those Haemus Mountains right to the west of Sulpicius Gallus.||CMP|Yes.||CC|Then, you get D-Caldera.||CMP|Okay. Hope I can find it this time again (laughter) Wouldn't that be a heck of a note?||CC|You better believe it.|05 21 59 32|CMP|Try to take a picture of it and couldn't find it (laughter). Okay. Let's see, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Okay, next one is 11.||CC|Okay. On D-Caldera, you want to go, f/8 at 1/250.||CMP|Okay. Let me get some of these mare. Still got to get the Haemus Mountains there.||CC|Okay.||CMP|And got to get some of the - Okay, D-Caldera. 250th, huh?||CC|Yes, 1/250 f/8, f/8, 1/250 on D-Caldera.|05 22 01 31|CMP|Okay. I found it.||CMP|Okay. What's the next one?||CC|Okay. I don't even know what the name of it is. It's just immediately up that hill and rille there, just immediately to the west of D-Caldera.||CMP|Okay.||CC|Looks like it would be right at the terminator.||CMP|... 125th. Yes, it is, as a matter of fact.||||||Tape 94B/9||CC|Ron, when - soon as you're done with the photos, you might check the laser altimeter. We - it went belly up during this photo pass - just absolutely quit like you had shut it off with your toe or something.||CMP|Thank you. Okay. It is off, as a matter of fact. Shall I turn it on now?||CC|Why don't you turn it on so we'll get a check here, and then it'll be coining off in a second. Think you got it with a toe or something?|05 22 03 32|CMP|Okay. It's ON. I must have.||CC|Okay. It's working good, too.||CMP|I wonder if I ever turned - I wonder if I ever turned it on?||CC|Wo, it was - it was on and running, Ron. And then all of a sudden, about 5 minutes ago, we got just a complete belly up; no power to it at all.||CMP|Oh. Well, I'll tell you, I've (chuckle) worn the toes through in my underwear here, so you do a lot of rolling around (chuckle). Let's see - let's recapitulate here. In mag QQ, we're on frame 104.||CMP|I'm not sure where it was when we started on that one.||CC|I think you gave me a call at 79> didn't you?||CMP|I didn't write it down (chuckle).||CC|That's all right. You - We've gotten all your calls. I think Tommy can pick that one up.||CMP|Oh, okay.||CC|Tommy's shaking his head that he's got it all squared away. So, if the bookkeeper's right, we're right.||CMP|Oh, okay (laughter).||||Tape 94B/10||||CC|And you can go ahead and start down that line now. We've seen the laser altimeter enough, I think.|05 22 05 32|CMP|Okay. I have the camera OFF. Yes, it's dark down there. I'm not getting any more pictures. Okay.|05 22 05 46|CMP|MAPPING CAMERA to OFF. Wait 30 seconds, it says. Okay. Rolling them up.||CC|Okay. You've got MAPPING CAMERA to STANDBY and IMAGE MOTION, OFF.|05 22 06 39|CMP|Okay. MAPPING CAMERA to STANDBY. OFF, barberpole, gray. LASER ALTIMETER, OFF. Okay. We've already in CMC FREE, and we're rolling left.||CC|Roger. Ron, IIJCO just asked me to remind you that those high gain angles that you see in this block here are strictly if we lose lock here during the manuever. That's the reacquire angle.||CMP|Okay. That's after we get the attitude. Okay.||CC|Watching your buddies on the screen down here right now, and they've, believe me, they've got more black showing than they do white right now -of those suits. They've really been down among them.||CMP|They out to the Scarp yet?||CC|Yes, they're - Let me ask Bob here.||CMP|At the edge of the mountain? Have they - -||CC|They've gone up and down the Sc arp. Wh -||CMP|Okay. They've gone all the way past station 2 and then they're going to station 4, huh?||CC|Roger. Let's see, they're - they're at station 3 right now, matter of fact. That's where they were showing them on TV. They've been up the Massif and up to station 2, and now they're back down to station 3.||||||Tape 94B/11|05 22 08 42|CMP|Okay, Mike Mike is at 95- I don't know if I ever told you that or not. I think I always get more pictures than I'm supposed to.||CC|We decided that what you're doing is trying to use up all the crew options before Jack gets up there.||CMP|(Laughter) You guessed it!||CMP|Hey» yes, which reminds me, if - you know, you get to a point where we've got one of these mags that doesn't have enough for a complete set, you know we could make those options on the end of a - a reel and use Papa Papa, there.||CC|Roger. That's - that's affirmative.||CC|Ron, I got to ask this - During the last eat period, did you leave the Hasselblad running without a mag in it, just to pull our chain?||CMP|(Laughter) No, honest I didn't; I really didn't. You heard something clicking all the time, huh?||CC|Roger. It's very periodic, just like it was on the intervalometer and it sounded just like - just like the Hasselblad sounded this last time. Just exactly like it.||CC|Tommy was just pulling his hair out over there.||CMP|Did - have I used up any more film on some of these than I should have?|05 22 11 08|CC|No, we haven't caught any, anomalies in the film usage.||CMP|"(Humming: ""Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf"")"||CMP|„.. 32; roll attitude.|05 22 l4 39|CMP|You know, I just noticed something that I didn't know before.||CC|What's that ?||||Tape 94B/12||||CMP|That is that the - when you manuever, you know, in a simulator, it's Just like the eye-view ball. You know, it's nice, smooth transition, you know. You look at the GDC ball and it goes, it kind of takes a jump in pitch and then a jump in yaw; a jump in pitch and then a jump in yaw. You put it on ball 2 ... ball 1 and it all does the same thing.||CC|Roger.||CMP|Yes, it does the same thing. That's just the way the GDC operates I guess.||CMP|Yes, not the - not the ball, it's just the GDC.||CC|Roger. The G&C is - just said that's a nominal.||CMP|Well, I'm sure it is, but, you know, I just didn't even know it. Because I hadn't noticed it before, I guess, either.|05 22 18 55|CC|Ron, while you're sitting there watching this manuever to completion, I've got some read-up from the orbital science report for the CMP if you would like to hear it?||CMP|Yes, I sure would. Go ahead.||CC|Okay. Let's talk about the UV. The far UV spectrometer data has been excellent throughout the mission. Indications are that the hydrogen atmosphere of the Moon is much less than expected. The Aerobee launched from White Sands on Monday failed to get solar UV calibration because an instrument viewing port failed to open. A second Aerobee flight is scheduled for tomorrow. The IR scanning radiometer is performing beautifully. Indications are that the subsolar point surface temperatures are higher than Earth-based observations predicted. Many thermal anomalies are being seen in the Ocean Procellarum area west of Copernicus. A few unusual cold spots have also been detected indicating areas of fine soil with few and no blocks. The lunar sounder data is excellent and the specular power monitor signals correlate with surface features; HF data indicates that layers are being detected in the mare areas. Over.||||||Tape 94B/13|05 22 20 14|CMP|Hey, beautiful. Man oh man. That sounds like all that stuff's working good. Outstanding. That's good - good to hear.||CC|Roger. And don't worry about that short period of time the laser altimeter was off; it shouldn't affect anything.||CMP|Okay.||CC|And anytime you can reach over there, Ron, it's H2, tank 2 FANs to ON for the night.|05 22 20 18|CMP|Okay, tank 2 FANs are going ON.|05 22 25 4l|CMP|Hear it rattling. It must be pretty close to attitude. Yes.|05 22 25 43|CC|Roger. You've got a 50 18 on the DSKY.||CMP|Okay. You know, it doesn't shake, rattle, and roll as much since we got rid of that tin can. But it still does a little bit, you know, you get a - it is a little more dynamic than I had thought it would be.||CC|We'd like ACCEPT, we've got a jet-on monitor load for you, Ron.||CMP|Okay.|05 22 26 30|CMP|There you got ACCEPT.||CC|You're trying to say you've got a - you're prejudiced and you think you've got a better flying vehicle than somebody else.|05 22 26 44|CMP|(Laughter) I just said it doesn't shake, rattle, and roll as much as it did when - when the other guys were on there.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 95A/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|05 21 03 00|LMP-EVA|... my camera's going be - -||CC|You copy on the SEP receiver turn on and temperature?||LMP-EVA|Right. You want that closed?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Mag.||CDR-EVA|We got that, Bob.||LMP-EVA|It's closed.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CC|Okay. 17, take all that back, we've just had a change of heart back here. And we're not going to turn the SEP on, just cover it up. And you might give us a temperature reading as you go by; that'11 help us think what to do with it.|05 21 03 30|CDR-EVA|It's about 98.||CC|Copy 98, then leave them both off.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||CC|17, John and Charlie are kind of advising you to put that SC - that full SCB underneath the seat to keep - make sure the top doesn't bounce open and lose some of those rocks.||CDR-EVA|Well, you can't take better advice than from those who have been here.||CC|Roger on that.||CDR-EVA|Their advice has been pretty good so far.||CC|I won't pass that on to them, I think they -||||Tape 95A/2||||CDR-EVA|These locks are clamming up, Jack. I can't unlock that one now.||LMP-EVA|Can you lock that one?||CDR-EVA|They all get sticky.||LMP-EVA|That one just didn't want to work any more.||CDR-EVA|Let me see. It isn't moving either way. This one -this one was sticky, too. Let me see.||LMP-EVA|OUT's open, right?||CDR-EVA|Huh?||LMP-EVA|OUT is open - -||CDR-EVA|OUT is OPEN, yes. Let me try once more if I have to - Here I got it.||LMP-EVA|Okay, those are really getting dusty. I'll hit those with a dust brush next time around.|05 21 05 11|CDR-EVA|Charge that time up to John and Charlie!||LMP-EVA|Okay. What haven't we done?||CDR-EVA|Okay. I got to get the camera. Okay, Bob, I'm taking your camera.||CC|Okay, looks like it's in the right place, as long as it's turned around. Good coordination.||CDR-EVA|Yes, sir. Okay. We read the TGE, I'm going MODE 1.||CC|Roger on that. Okay; we lost the picture.||CC|And give me a call when you guys get rolling.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CC|And we'd like frames when it's convenient on you guys.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob.|05 21 06 16|LMP-EVA|Okay. LMP is at hG.||||||Tape 95A/3||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|And CDR, is at, if I stop long enough, 113.||CC|Copy. 113.||LMP-EVA|Oh, look at that. Boy, I tell you. Okay, Geno, why don't I follow our tracks back; well, until we get over the big hump and then we can start picking our way to 3-||CDR-EVA|I've got 3 pretty well spotted.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Okay; low gain is set, and heading about 035 - oh, let me set this thing out of the way again. This has been giving me more trouble.||CDR-EVA|What's that? The hammer?||LMP-EVA|Yes, the handle.||CDR-EVA|Oh, getting caught in there?|05 21 07 25|LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob. We're ready, we're rolling. You need any readings?||CC|No, no readings called out. And when you get go-ing, I'll give you a little advice on what we're going to do on the way to station 3.||LMP-EVA|Well, let me tell you a few things first, Bob.||CC|Okay, start telling me.||LMP-EVA|I think those two - -|05 21 07 47|CDR-EVA|We're rolling!||LMP-EVA|All right. Those two major kinds of blocks that we sampled there - it was about the two varieties we saw in the area, it's a long extrapolation I realize, but they do resemble In color, and I believe in texture, the blue-gray rocks and the light tan rocks up on the Massif. So I feel confident that - fairly confident that we sampled at least the two major units visible from a di.st.aucL' in the South Massif.||||Tape 95A/4||||CC|Excellent, excellent.||LMP-EVA|I think that there is some - a lot of postmission work to be done on correlating the angularity and possibly even the albedoes of the rocks we sampled with those on the Massif. We should have good -good pictures of them - of both from a distance and up close.||CC|Okay. I'm reminding you - -||LMP-EVA|So we may be able ... - -||CC|- - That extrapolation Is the nature of our art.||LMP-EVA|Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. And, Bob, I'm not going to -How sun I on the film?||CDR-EVA|Oh, my golly! Look at that valley!|05 21 09 10|CC|Stand by. I'll get that for you, Jack - -||CDR-EVA|I think there's a - -||CC|I'm picking you up fairly well, now. And before you guys get too far, a couple of comments we want to do on the way. If - there is a Rover sample stop in your checklist, it used to be at the 073 and 6.3; it's the first thing there, halfway out to Hole-in-the-Wall. And we're now going to have that Rover sample stop at 078 and 7.0. That should be along your tracks going home. So, about 078 and 7-0, we'll have the Rover sample stop. And the gravimeter people have won today, and we're going to stop and get off the Rover and get a gravimeter reading at that location. We're taking out another stop, I'm not sure quite where. And right now, Jack, you're right on on the film says a little note in front of me.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I'll take pictures, then.||CDR-EVA|Bcb, we're on the top, coming off the highest lobe of the scarp looking back Into the valley. And It's quite a scene back there, but we still cannot see the LM. That may be it - I don't know.||||||Tape 95A/5||LMP-EVA|Hey, turn a partial pan, I know it's into the Gun. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Let's take one from right here. I want -I want the whole thing.||CDR-EVA|You ready to start?|05 21 10 28|LMP-EVA|Yes, I got it.||CDR-EVA|Start taking. Well, that's -||CDR-EVA|Take the whole thing.||LMP-EVA|Go ahead.||CDR-EVA|Get around this crater.||LMP-EVA|I got a pan down in the valley. This is just going to be right into the -||CDR-EVA|Yes. Don't take that one. Get it up as we come around. You get it? There we go.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|That's the one we want. And you got the valley?||LMP-EVA|Yes. Keep going. Okay. Keep turning around over there, and I'll get that scarp.||CDR-EVA|That's beautiful.||LMP-EVA|Isn't that something? Man, you talk about a mysterious looking place. They can cut some frames -some parts of those pictures out and make a nice photograph. (Laughter) TV cameras, maps -|05 21 11 10|LMP-EVA|Okay, looking at the north man - the light mantle. No more comments except that by that rake sample and just looking, there's certainly - are fewer fragments than we saw at station 2. The main thing that we can tell about the light mantle and when we're on it, of course, is the light-colored craters. The fresher craters all appear to be light colored. As they get older, they seem to -the albedo goes down and potentially have been||||Tape 95A/6|||||dusted with material from the dark mantle or from other sites. Either that or it's just the lunar patination that we're all familiar with.||CDR-EVA|You know, it's a shame. They could have had TV coming down here because my heading isn't going to change much at all. The high gain could have been on the whole time.||LMP-EVA|Bob, none of the craters out here in the light mantle appear to show - they've got new bedrock. Almost all of them are instant rock craters.||CDR-EVA|Say, Bob. Give me that bearing and range again for the - -||LMP-EVA|70 right here.||CC|07 and J . 0.|05 21 12 32|CDR-EVA|- - up on the hill. How about 071 and 7.0? Will that do?||CC|Yes. I think that that will be enough to hack it.||CDR-EVA|Well, if not, we can go down there.||CC|No, no, no. Stay on the road - stay on the road you're on.||CDR-EVA|Well, I'm not on any road, but I'm stopping here.||CC|I thought you guys were making a road -||CDR-EVA|071.||CC|Roger.||CDR-EVA|Let me turn it off.||CC|Yes, also - -||LMP-EVA|... 98 and 70.||||||Tape 95A/7||CC|Okay. And the Rover ... should be fairly flat for the ole gravimeter.||CDR-EVA|Oh, oh.||CDR-EVA|Well - That means we have to change here.||LMP-EVA|Hey, right over here to my right - -||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Maybe it's the best we can do, but it's still going to be on a slope.||CDR-EVA|Well, I'll level it off on a local - -||LMP-EVA|On it?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Go ahead.||CDR-EVA|I'm on. Do you see -||LMP-EVA|Yes, I see it. Right there.||CDR-EVA|On the rim of that crater that's builded up a little bit? Right up here. What's your - can you tell your roll? Okay, now that's about aero right there. What's your roll?||LMP-EVA|Let me turn this off.||CDR-EVA|What's your roll indicator ...||LMP-EVA|Oh zero.||CDR-EVA|Zero?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|I'11 punch It.||LMP-EVA|You'll change it as soon as you get off.||||Tape 95A/8||||CDR-EVA|Oh, it's zero.||LMP-EVA|Oh, you got to get off anyway?||CDR-EVA|Do I have to get off for this?||CC|Roger. Both of you get off.||LMP-EVA|Gravimeter reading.||CDR-EVA|Why should I have to get off?||CC|So you don't move the ole gravimeter.||LMP-EVA|Think you can hold still?||CDR-EVA|Yes. I'll hold still.|05 21 14 06|CC|No. Negative on that, Gene.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. Give me your sampler cause that's the other thing I have to do.||CC|Yes. We'll get bag samples here - Rover samples, at least.||CDR-EVA|But you need me off to sample?||CC|Roger. We want Jack - Gene and Jack both off.||CDR-EVA|Well, if you need me off; Jack, just punch it.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Hold still. They don't know anything about your PLSS noise.||CDR-EVA|We'll get off.||CC|Gene, we'd like both of you off.||LMP-EVA|07 - 071, 9-8, and 7-0, Bob.||CC|Got that.||CDR-EVA|Don't push it yet - did you?||LMP-EVA|No.||||||Tape 95A/9|05 21 14 59|CDR-EVA|Okay. Go ahead. Push it.||LMP-EVA|Let me wait until it settles down here.||CDR-EVA|This thing is off tape START, isn't it?||LMP-EVA|Oh - if this thing doesn't change.||CDR-EVA|Oh, that should be good - -||LMP-EVA|Yes, it does change - vibrate a couple of times.||CDR-EVA|Huh?||LMP-EVA|Vibrate a couple of times.||CDR-EVA|No, the settings.||LMP-EVA|Oh, I don't know - yes,, they'll change.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Quiet Rover. Gravity.|05 21 15 30|LMP-EVA|MARK it.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Say, Bob, I need a quick f-stop for the 500.||CC|F-stop.||LMP-EVA|It's the same - it's the same film.||CC|Stand by.||LMP-EVA|Hey, Bob, can I punch it again?||CC|Oh yes. Go to STANDBY and then punch it again.||CDR-EVA|... time out, do you? Go to STANDBY.||LMP-EVA|Stand by.||CDR-EVA|Stand by, Jack.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||||Tape 95A/10|||05 21 15 56|LMP-EVA|MARK it.||CC|Copy that.||CC|Okay. And, Geno, f-stop for the 500 millimeter should be the same as - for the 70.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||CC|And, Jack, I presume you're getting some Rover samples here off the Rover.||LMP-EVA|Bag 30 Easy.||CC|Copy. 30 Easy. Are you guys finding much in the way of rocks here?||CDR-EVA|I'm looking. I can get you some instant rock out of a small pit crater - pit bottom crater.|05 21 17 25|LMP-EVA|Bob, up to frame count 36 is the outcrop or boulders at the top of the South Massif.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Bag 31 Easy. Instant rock out of a 2-meter pit bottom crater - off the inner wall.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Well, let's make it 30 centimeters down from the rim.||CC|Okay,||CC|Okay, 17. We've got about 30 seconds left for that gravimeter reading. You want to be finishing up the task and getting back toward the Rover.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob. And through frame count 57 are the Korth Massif and - from part of the western portions to part of the eastern portions.||||||Tape 95A/11||CC|Okay, now; and what was that frame count?||CC|Okay. Copy the 57, then.||CDR-EVA|Here's something different - here's a little - -||CC|Hey, guys, we're ready for the gravimeter reading. And we'd like a frame count from you, Jack. I guess if you'd prefer - -||LMP-EVA|A chunk of yellow-brown rock that apparently has several spots behind it, probably indicating direction from which it came - Oh, no - What is that? That's a reflection (laughter). That really fooled me. A reflection off the I^ylar (laughter). Crazy. Well, what the heck, I'll sample it anyway.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Let me get my antenna set so - it's not quite - -||LMP-EVA|Is it through reading?||CDR-EVA|Yes, it's through reading. I'll - Probably read it better by now, Bob. I've got Family Mountain and some of the hills way up to the right of Family Mountain. I'm at 67 on the - on the - 500 and I'll give you the reading on the gravimeter.||CC|Okay. Copy. 67 on Family Mountain.||CDR-EVA|Did you get the other words on the 500?||CC|Roger. Copied them all.||CDR-EVA|Well, you were reading at probably a 90-degree low-gain angle.||CC|Roger. We've been reading them on the LM also.||LMP-EVA|Thirty-two Easy is another - just small - another small fragment.||CC|You know what I need?||||Tape 95A/12|||05 21 20 56|CDR-EVA|Okay, 670, 123, 501 - 670, 123 501.||CC|Okay. Copy that, Geno. And we're ready for you guys to go on at your earliest convenience.||CDR-EVA|Do you want me to load the LRV sampler?||LMP-EVA|Go ahead. Yes.||CC|And, Jack, is that your last LRV sample bag?||LMP-EVA|I only had one left, but it's loaded now.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|You did get the reading, right, Bob?||CC|Roger. Got the reading.|05 21 21 54|CDR-EVA|Okay. We're buttoning up.||CC|Okay. And if you've got something - If you don't have one left for that sample at Hole-in-the-Wall, Jack, we'd like you to get a new set of sample bags .||LMP-EVA|We've got it.||CC|Okay. Got it. Still understand that 32 Echo was your last sample.||LMP-EVA|Thirty-two Echo. Got three here.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Oh, oh.||LMP-EVA|Okay?||CDR-EVA|Yes .||LMP-EVA|Need some help?||CDR-EVA|No. I've got the Rover.||LMP-EVA|Was that me?||||||Tape 95A/13||CDR-EVA|No.||CDR-EVA|That was interesting. Bob, about 2 inches below the surface here, you ran into that very - that blue-gray material down there and it just - it's in little clods, and it breaks apart in your hands.||LMP-EVA|Yes, that's right.||CDR-EVA|Did you get some of that in your Rover sample?||LMP-EVA|No, but I got it out of that instant rock crater.||CDR-EVA|Let's grab a quick Rover sample and we'll take off.||LMP-EVA|That's why that was a pretty interesting (laughter) episode.|05 21 23 06|CDR-EVA|Yes. Well, you know, we haven't been trenching like we should or we would have - -||LMP-EVA|But, really those trenches - those craters are giving us the same information. That there's a light-colored material underneath.||CC|Okay. 175 we're ready for you guys to move on and we'd like to eliminate the Rover sample at Hole-in-the-Wall.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. We're getting on now.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|We got on a minute ago (laughter)||CC|And, do I understand that these Rover samples, Jack, are in your pockets?||LMP-EVA|No. They're in the bag on the Rover.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Forty Yankee.||CC|Copy that.||||Tape 95A/14||||LMP-EVA|That's light-colored soil from a depth of about -it's mixed with a little of the upper surface, but mostly light-colored soil from a depth of about 15 centimeters.||CDR-EVA|Wonder what would I do for an encore?||LMP-EVA|It looks like the light mantle in here is covered with dark to a depth of about 5 or 10 centimeters.||CDR-EVA|You might want to go MIN, Jack, on your diverter.||LMP-EVA|Right now, I'm sort of warm.||CDR-EVA|Okay. When we start driving, you might want to go.||LMP-EVA|I'm going to zap myself with a cold. I can do it on here.||CDR-EVA|Did you take any pictures at all while you were there?||LMP-EVA|Oh, yes. I didn't take a pan. Why don't you turn right to a ...?||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. If you read, we're rolling.|05 21 25 08|CC|Okay. Mark that.||CDR-EVA|Making a right-hand turn for a pan.||LMP-EVA|Left. Let me see where we're going. I guess ... again. You know, a little more and that hole would have been in the way. We left some of our litter.||CDR-EVA|Not a complete pan but it will show the location.||LMP-EVA|Okay. LMP frame count 80.||CC|Copy that; 80.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Geno, you're heading for a spot that's about 080/5.5, approximately.||||||Tape 95A/15||LMP-EVA|Okay?||CC|Yes, you guys following ... form or not?||LMP-EVA|Do you have an update?||CDR-EVA|No.||CC|Okay; and - Roger. The Hole-in-the-Wall should be at about 080 or maybe 5*7- And we're not going to stop and get a Rover sample at Hole-in-the-Wall.||CDR-EVA|What about station 3?||CDR-EVA|Okay, that sounds reasonable because it's just nothing but lots of rolling terrain.|05 21 26 25|LMP-EVA|Okay. Bob, I - I think we have a good sample of only partially contaminated light mantle in that last Rover sample that Gene accidentally discovered was right under our feet. It's almost certainly the light-colored material that's the crater - we've been talking about in the walls of the crater. And, as a matter of fact, that instant rock sample I took was light-colored and probably represents the same stuff, indurated slightly.||CDR-EVA|Light-colored mantle has that bluish tint that you saw in those rocks.||LMP-EVA|Yes .||LMP-EVA|I still don't think there's anything. We ought to - we ought to get a core in this light mantle sometime; and probably station 3 is going to be the place. I hope that's still in the agenda.||CC|Roger. It's still in the agenda.||CDR-EVA|Say, Bob, can you update tne mileage on station -S?||CC|Okay, you want mileage to it or do you want the range and bearing at it?||||Tape 95A/16||||CDR-EVA|Well, range and bearing at it.||CC|Okay. Stand by.||CDR-EVA|The Hole-in-the-Wall is fairly nebulous.||CC|Okay, we're going to say about 089 and 6.1 for station 3.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||CC|Do you want to hear another range and bearing right now?||CDR-EVA|Do you get the feeling that we're the only ones out here, Jack? Looking around - 073, 10.3, 6.6.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Bob, I have a feeling that whatever darkens the -Ooh, there's a beautiful little glass-lined crater, pit bottom crater - whatever darkens the light mantle is not a - a one-time-only mantling of darker material. It's something that happens over a period of time, continually, because craters of all sizes and apparent degradation are dark -darkened and there are lighter craters that are light to varying degrees, there seems to be a continuing - continuum of albedo change.|05 21 29 08|CDR-EVA|You know that little crater on the side of the North Massif that we're thinking about going to doesn't look nearly as light-colored or haloed as it does in pictures, does it?||LMP-EVA|You mean - Yes - no.||CDR-EVA|Now, let's see where we are, I don't want to run into that big crater at the foot of the - -||LMP-EVA|I think you're almost to the rim.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I want to go down here if I can. My tracks are over there to the left, I haven't crossed them yet.||||||Tape 95A/17|05 21 29 45|LMP-EVA|073, 6.3.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|LMP frame count is 86.||CC|Copy 86.||LMP-EVA|Boy, that's a sight, isn't it?||CDR-EVA|That's spectacular.||LMP-EVA|I don't know why something that's all approximately the same hue should -||CDR-EVA|The lack of color has got to contribute to the inability to judge distance.||LMP-EVA|See the lobes coming out - looks like lobes out from the Scarp. The Scarp rather being a line in there on the, on the plain, appear to be lobes. I got a couple of shots of that. Whereas when it gets up on the Massif, it's a fairly continuous curve; although it does appear to be younger, at least - at least there's less relief on it for the first few kilometers of that bend there.||CDR-EVA|We're going to have to go down like the way we came because there's that big crater down at the bottom, I'm afraid.||CC|Yes, I think we agree with that suggestion, too.||LMP-EVA|Bob, the Scarp, so called Scarp, impresses me as less of a scarp than a series of - of lobes which roughly have a north-south trend. And we've been driving over various hummocks within those lobe;;.||CC|Okay, copy that.||CDR-EVA|I think we made a gross mistake in not trying to let them get TV, my heading hasn't changed much at all here. Then we would have a spectacular view. Look at it out in that valley, Jack.||||Tape 95A/18||||LMP-EVA|Yes .||CDR-EVA|Good gosh. I still don't know where the LM is -I see it, I think. The shadow or blob - that's the only sharp shadow out there right in the -because you sure can't make out the craters from here, can you? Okay, hold on. Over the hill and down the vale. Man, I tell you, this machine is fantastic.||LMP-EVA|Yes; Roger. (Laughter)||CDR-EVA|Quite a machine.||LMP-EVA|Likes to spin when you turn going down hill.||CDR-EVA|Quite a machine.||LMP-EVA|But - I think you've got something right ahead of you. Here -||CDR-EVA|I got it.||LMP-EVA|See the instant rock.||CDR-EVA|I got it. You know, the crater doesn't look nearly as bad from here, but it sure is deep when you get up there. We'll just - I'll meander around it over next to this next little lobe then I'll head down the next one - the first lobe we came up - and then along it.|05 21 33 08|LMP-EVA|Okay, there's Lara, and I think we can see station - Watch it, watch it, watch it.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I'm going through it slow.||LMP-EVA|Beautiful. I figured we'd buckle the LCRU with that one.||CDR-EVA|I bet they can watch this road. My heart rate just dictates the kind of terrain we're going over.||LMP-EVA|Okay - Houston, we're navigating and not talking. Sorry. But the light mantle is a fair - is a uniform surface and I think you've heard just about everything we've had to say so far.||||||Tape 95A/19||CC|Roger. Your conun's great and you guys are doing good work.||LMP-EVA|The fragment population is not - the fragment population hasn't changed, nor has the crater population, as near as I can tell. I hope the LRV photos will give you more detail than that. Okay, Gene, do you have the target over there, that set of - -||CDR-EVA|Yes, I got to get over to this next knoll and I'm going to be off the Scarp. We're about three-quarters of the way down.||CDR-EVA|Isn't that sharp shadow out there the LM? See it way out there? Almost under the Sun. It's got to be. It's the only sharp shadow out there. Right under the Sun, straight down there.||LMP-EVA|Probably.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I'm going to try to make it down there. Hold on.||LMP-EVA|This is what?||CDR-EVA|This is the one we climbed up.||LMP-EVA|Oh, there's Nemo over there to my right.||CDR-EVA|Yes, sir, this is the one we climbed up. Would you believe that?||LMP-EVA|Well, I don't know.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I would.||LMP-EVA|The problem is if there is any crater on the side - -||CDR-EVA|I don't want to give it the roll, are you - -||LMP-EVA|I think you're all right.||CDR-EVA|We're all right. I don't know, that's got, - -||||Tape 95A/20||||LMP-EVA|Keep your speed down because if you have to turn, it doesn't like it on a downhill slope.||CDR-EVA|And that's got to be a pitch-angle ... and I don't know what that means. Okay. Right on time - -||LMP-EVA|... scarp.|05 21 35 45|CC|You guys cut each other out but I take it that means you're at the edge of the Scarp.||CDR-EVA|We're off, we're off, we came down.||CC|Roger. You're down the Scarp.||CDR-EVA|Hey, will you look at the hill we came down same way we went up?||LMP-EVA|11d rather not.||CDR-EVA|Oh, I don't know, I'm impressed.||CDR-EVA|Okay, now where we got to go. 345 roughly. And we want to go to 087/6.1 - -||LMP-EVA|Okay, you're - I think you're headed right -right for where we want.||CDR-EVA|Yes .||LMP-EVA|It's that bright - see that bright crater? You can just start to see station 3 over there now.||CDR-EVA|Okay, navigation says I've got more than 9 degrees - I should be increasing range. Bob, we * ro at 0791 11-5, and 5-7-||CC|Okay, beautiful, guys. Really going smooth.||CDR-EVA|And I'm headed northwest.||CC|Roger. In fact, we understand it's been going so smooth down here that they haven't even spilled any coffee in the SPAN room yet this mission.||||||Tape 95A/21||CDR-EVA|Morrison must not be on duty. I'm glad we don't have any sitting on the LCRU.||LMP-EVA|Right over there is station 3, I think.||CDR-EVA|Oh, actually, I guess - they would want it - is there - I can just start to see two craters - -||LMP-EVA|You know what the problem is?||CDR-EVA|- - and they're closer to Lara.||LMP-EVA|I got a full planar view of the high gain and I can't see a thing out there.||CDR-EVA|That's right.||LMP-EVA|Full planar view. All I can do is see underneath it.||CDR-EVA|Well I - going to take it broadside. See, I can't see a lot of craters now that I'm out in front. Oh, I guess I can see them both.||LMP-EVA|Here's a nice sharp little hole; look at that. Bob, the texture of the light mantle - surface texture - is really no different on the Scarp, on its flank, or out here to the east of the Scarp. Fragment population, crater population, everything looking about the same. If there is such a thing as a light mantle, it seems to be uniform across the Scarp.|05 21 37 59|CC|Okay, I copy that, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Here are your tracks - Hey! We crossed somebody's tracks - we sure did ... we made a loop.||CC|Hope they look like yours.|05 21 38 14|CDR-EVA|That was at 081/5-7-||CC|Okay, copy 081/5-7* Do they look like your tracks?||LMP-EVA|Well, here's another set.||||Tape 95A/22||||CDR-EVA|Yes, this is where we went to the big crater and I came southeast in order to get around it, remember? We saw that hole?||LMP-EVA|Yes .||CDR-EVA|Look at that big turn I made, ha ha! That was a quick change of mind when we came over that ridge.||LMP-EVA|Yes, sir.||CDR-EVA|Okay, we're still headed northwest, Bob.||LMP-EVA|Here - I -||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, I guess one thing we don't have a handle on yet is what are the - I think we sampled them - once in a Rover sample, but what are the fragments out here mixed with the light mantle?||CC|Okay, I copy that.||LMP-EVA|I think I got one at our last - our last gravimeter stop, a small one, and I guess there's one other Rover sample, but - station 3, we probably ought to make sure we get a representative suite of those fragments.||CC|Roger. Agree to that.||CDR-EVA|Hey, Bob, how long have we been out?||CC|Say there again, Gene? How long have you been out?||CDR-EVA|How long have we been out?||CC|3 plus 45*||CDR-EVA|Thank you.||LMP-EVA|We're at 083/5-7- Well, it certainly doesn't look like the geology of Norway, but it certainly is interesting.||CDR-EVA|That must be Lara right there, huh?||||||Tape 95A/23||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|On the left. You can see the blocks on the other side of her.||LMP-EVA|That's right. I told them about those earlier. That's the only no - I think, Gene, you want to bear a little bit - Hold on - a little bit to the left. See those two craters, two bright craters, that are just this side of Lara?||CDR-EVA|Now - well - I'm not -||LMP-EVA|You're pointed right - almost right at them, now.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I can barely see them now through that high gain.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|But I can see - I know where we're going now.|05 21 40 25|LMP-EVA|Those are the two I think they wanted us to be at, and I think that's a good choice if we can get up there.||CDR-EVA|Bob, I want to get some 500s the way that scarp flows up on top - well, it looks like it flows up on top of the North Massif. Now if may look like the North Massif may drape material down upon it. Look at that.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Not really. The texture is so different. It just doesn't look like as old a surface, but definitely different.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Wish they had never said anything about picturer,, because I've tended to not take enough - to do better.||||Tape 95A/24||||CC|Okay, but, Jack, you're doing quite well in the picture department - you're not getting too far behind or ahead. Copy that, Gene?||LMP-EVA|No, but I mean I'm not getting the coverage I've -I'm not sure I'm getting the coverage I should.||CC|Okay. We'll look at the frame count when you get to station 3-||LMP-EVA|Oops, oops! Oh, there's another big crater with a pit in it, •||CDR-EVA|What was it, 17-1/2 or l8 clicks we hit coming down the Scarp, Jack?||LMP-EVA|I don't know (laughter).|05 21 41 46|CDR-EVA|I'm in MIN cooling now.||CDR-EVA|Oh, look at that - wait until you get over and look, at that South Massif. Is that -||LMP-EVA|Yes. I don't know where we're going to get a good - Well, let's see. You know, that big block up there might be worth going to.||CDR-EVA|087 at 5*9* I think that's the best station we1w got right here.||LMP-EVA|Well--||CDR-EVA|Let's see what's over on your right. Let's see if we can get at that scarp over there.||LMP-EVA|I've sort of lost track - -||CDR-EVA|We're about there.||CC|I think we expected you guys to be a little bit farther north. We were getting a heading of 080 for the bearing which really kind of says you said you were going a bit farther north than this.||CDR-EVA|Well, there's that first crater, there, Jack.||||||Tape 95A/25|05 21 42 4l|LMP-EVA|080?||CC|Roger. 080 is where we think -||LMP-EVA|All of a sudden I've lost track.||CC|Stand by.||LMP-EVA|There's nothing wrong with that except that -||LMP-EVA|I think we ought to go back to that big block.||CDR-EVA|Heading 080 is - heading north is not going to - -||CC|Roger. I just realized that, Geno.|05 21 42 58|CDR-EVA|I'm 087 now.||CC|Yes, I realize that, Gene; my mistake. Somebody's got a wrong thing down here.||LMP-EVA|Gene, I think - -||CC|That's the Hole-in-the-Wall. Vfy mistake.||LMP-EVA|I think we need to go - go back there a little bit.||CDR-EVA|Yes, we're at 087/6.0. I think that's probably about right. Why don't we stop here?||CC|Okay, 17> that's a great stop. That was my mistake, I was reading the Hole-in-the-Wall coordinate|05 21 43 25|CDR-EVA|All right, Bob, we've got the boulders over here that are in the light mantle.||CC|Okay, now, let me brief you on station 3- It's going to be a very brief station to make up for the - -||CDR-EVA|We can see a little bit down into Lara, too.||||Tape 95A/26||||CC|Okay, it will be a brief station to make up for the time we added on at the - first of all, remember we want to get the nav update. Let me go into a heading, of 270 more or less and give us the nav read-out so we can start that here.||CDR-EVA|Can you get where you want from here?||LMP-EVA|No, this is no good. I wanted to get a high spot.||CDR-EVA|Yes, let's - let me park down here, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Why? You should have stayed up there. This is good right here.||CDR-EVA|It's not going to be very level for the gravimeter||CC|Gene, remember, we want to - head for the west so we can get the nav update.||CDR-EVA|We'll park right out here and we can work those blocks right up behind us. Okay, you want a nav update here?||CC|Roger. That's affirm. You need to get your antenna.||CDR-EVA|Why don't you get off, Jack? Oh, I was looking at the wrong - oh, no, I'm not. Okay. I'll get a nav update. Get off and look around. I'll give them a nav update, Jack, and we'll press on.||CDR-EVA|Yes, sir, you're right, Bob. Hey, get your -||LMP-EVA|I will.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Go ahead.||CDR-EVA|What do you need? Take your scoop or whatever you need.||LMP-EVA|Oh, you're going to move?||CDR-EVA|Yes. I want to give them a nav update real quick.||||||Tape 95A/27||LMP-EVA|?Oh, I'm sorry, I - -||CC|Okay. And, Jack, ... for you. We're going to want you to do some document sampling on your own. I'll get with you guys on the rest of the station plan shortly. Go ahead, Gene, we're ready.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I ought to get the gnomon, I guess. Okay, let me find a level spot; I'll come back towards you.||LMP-EVA|I'll get it. There is none.||CDR-EVA|Well, okay, if you got any -||LMP-EVA|No, go ahead, make your park.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I'm looking for a level spot, but my gosh, there sure aren't very many.||LMP-EVA|That1s probably pretty good.||CDR-EVA|It will be in a minute.||CC|It doesn't have to be all that level, Jack - Geno.|05 21 46 27|CDR-EVA|Okay, 087 and 12.6, 6.0.||LMP-EVA|I got your gnomon.||CDR-EVA|Sun shadow is zero. Pitch - if I can get it over to read it. Pitch is - pitch is zero. Roll is zero. About 1 left, Bob?||CC|Okay, copy. And how about that - -||CDR-EVA|About 1 left.||CC|And how about heading?||CDR-EVA|Heading is 282.||CC|Okay, go ahead and park. We'll give you an update when you get done.||||Tape 95A/28||||CDR-EVA|What else do you need?||CC|That's all we need. Go ahead and park on your OU5. We'll give you an update when you are done.||CDR-EVA|Jack, is one coming right there?||LMP-EVA|Looks like a pretty good location to sample the rim materials of this crater.||CDR-EVA|Bob, I'm at the south, let's say the east-southeast rim of a - oh, 30-meter crater in the light mantle, of course; up on the Scarp and maybe 300 - 200 meters from the rim of Lara in a northeast direction.||CC|Okay, I copy that.||CDR-EVA|It's body shows up as a bright crater - a bright crater on your map. There's only about a half a centimeter of gray cover over very white material that forms the rim.||CC|Okay. And, Gene, give me a call when you get parked and I'll give you an update on what we want to do.|05 21 48 38|CDR-EVA|Okay, I am parked.||CC|Okay, good. We'll take the Rover read-out first.|05 21 48 45|CDR-EVA|Okay. 087, 12.7, 6.0; 105 and 100. On the battery temps 100, 120. The rear motors are off scale low and the forward motors are 0 and 2^0.||CC|Okay, we copy that. Understand that 2^0 now instead of a 340. And what was your heading, 045?||CDR-EVA|Heading is 043.||CC|0kay. We copy that.||CDR-EVA|If I ever gave you a motor temperature of 340, that figure was erroneous.||||||Tape 95A/29||CC|Okay; Roger. And what we'd like you to do, Gene, is we'd like you to get the CSVC samples yourself, that will essentially be your sole task at this station, Jack can do the solo sampling and we'd like to get one pan and the gravimeter, and then we'll leave this station. We're going to absorb some of the time we spent with the extra gravimeter reading and some of the time we absorbed at station 2 in the longer stay time in sampling at station 3. That's our plan. So it will be CDR for the CSVC for the long cans, excuse me, and LMP for solo sampling and then a pan by Jack, I presume, and then the gravimeter and then leave. And, Jack, you might check your film. We aren't quite sure where you are right now, before you get too far from the Rover.|05 21 50 17|CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob.||CDR-EVA|Bob, you got any - Bob, you got any preference up in this area where you want that long can?||CC|Negative. That's something that was sort of near the scarp, but you're parked so near the scarp and that something, remember we do it in solo, we only did it with the Rover, so you'd have to stay right there beside the Rover and do it. No expectations of doing it otherwise.||CDR-EVA|Yes. That's what I figured.||LMP-EVA|Gene.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I think you're in good shape. Yes, I don't have any other choice. Matter of fact, if there is a scarp, and if it is a fault, I'm right -right on it because the projection of it would be uphill a little bit.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I'll be right on the side of it. I'm parked on the side of it if it exists.||CC|Okay, and, Jack, what's your frame count?|05 21 51 35|LMP-EVA|Well, 1 - 122.||||Tape 95A/30||||CC|Okay , copy that ... Go ahead, Gene.||LMP-EVA|What do you need, Gene?||CDR-EVA|Oh, yes. Bob, I dug a trench in the side of this crater. I've got down-Sun pictures of it. There is quite a marbling of light and dark soil or fine grain material. It looks as if there's a uniform, about 3-centimeter layer of light material over that marbled light and dark. On the very top surface, there's a half centimeter of light gray, and when I say dark, I mean a medium gray.||CC|Okay, copy that. Sounds like a great sample site.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I'm going to start sampling the soils, and then I'll get you the fragments.||CC|Okay, I presume that we'll at least have the single upper core which we can use to sample of that stuff in the soil, and we -||CDR-EVA|Oh, there's no guarantee that this is a crater rim.||CC|Okay. And, Gene, are you still near the Rover?||CDR-EVA|Yes, I am.||CC|Okay, we'd like to get the SEP blankets opened, Gene, and dusted if they're dirty, so they can cool some more.||CDR-EVA|Oh, boy.||CC|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Okay, now I can't give you the gravimeter reading while I'm working on the Rover, so I'll have to time it when I get away from it.||CC|Okay. Roger on that. I think you'll be pounding on the hammer for a long while while you can take the Rover - gravimeter reading.||||||Tape 95A/31|05 21 53 36|CDR-EVA|Yes. Well, we'll see. Let me get your brush back.||LMP-EVA|Okay, bag 520 has a skin sample of the upper light-gray soil. Don't know where I'm going to put these things, I've got to come down and get a bag.||LMP-EVA|Have you punched the gravim -No.||CDR-EVA|No, I can't punch it until I get out of here.||LMP-EVA|These switches are on OFF, STANDBY, right?||CDR-EVA|They should be.||LMP-EVA|Okay, that's where they are and the temperature is 100, about 104 and - -||CDR-EVA|No, they should be OFF. Isn't it OFF?||LMP-EVA|No, it was STANDBY.||CDR-EVA|No, push it OFF.||CC|Okay, it doesn't matter whether it's STANDBY; it won't be heating at that temperature anyway, but put it OFF.||CDR-EVA|Okay. It might have gotten hit when I changed the blanket. Now I have to go to INTERMEDIATE cooling here.||LMP-EVA|Zap me with a cold. Imagine those PLSS got chareged okay last night. ...||CDR-EVA|Okay, back to intermediate. How's Ron doing?||CC|They're both looking - Stand by, I thought he said both fine. Ron's doing great, too. He's sitting here busily - -||CDR-EVA|No, no.||CC|Go ahead.||CDR-EVA|I mean Captain America.||||Tape 95A/32||||CC|Yes, I'm just inquiring of Bob. I think he's doing great. He's just passed a little bit north of you a couple of minutes ago and took some pictures of you.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I do my work around the LMP seat here.||CDR-EVA|That's lock. That must be unlock.|05 21 56 36|LMP-EVA|Okay, unlock. Brake is off. Four is coming in. Okay, Bob, the upper - the upper 5 centimeter -3 centimeters mixed with that upper half centimeter, is the next sample.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, I guess I'm going to go pound away and, Jack, I'm going to hit the gravimeter.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay -|05 21 57 30|CDR-EVA|MARK it.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|And 521 is the sample bag.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Well, the first core has gone down pretty good, Bob.||CC|Okay, great.||LMP-EVA|Oh, you're not going - you won't have any problem in here coring.||CDR-EVA|Oh, man, I tell you, I wish I was putting a drill hole in here. Looks pretty nice.|05 21 58 29|LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob. The next sample is mostly the medium gray fraction of the marbling. It's mixed, though.|05 21 59 19|LMP-EVA|That's in bag 522.||||||Tape 95A/33||CC|Copy that, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Okay, I think I got it. I think I got it, Bob.||CC|Okay.||CC|And, Jack, when you get done with this trench you might hit one - two of those blocks there, but then we'd - since we're really trying to cut this station down to a minimum, after that you'd probably get - better get to the pan.||CDR-EVA|Bob, what do you think, can I read a gravimeter?||CC|Yes, if it's not flashing - -||CDR-EVA|The light's out.||CC|Yes, it should be just done.|05 22 00 15|CDR-EVA|670, 049, 701; 670, 049, 701.||CC|Okay, I copy that.||LMP-EVA|Bob, the - the white marble in the - the white fraction in the marble zone in 523.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Bob, I forgot to give you the core numbers, but I will.||CC|Okay. And don't forget to put your little note in the long can there.||CDR-EVA|Oh, I'll get the note in there. I'll get it in there. Nobody will ever know.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, our 524 is what I think is a blue-gray rock probably breccia. It's got a little dust cover.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|From just off the rim of this little crater.||||Tape 95A/34||||CC|Okay, copy that. It's a blue-gray rock, it's not part of the trench, right? You finish with the trench?||CDR-EVA|Yes. As you see, Bob, it's full. See that?||CC|Roger. We see a long thing in your hand there, Gene.||LMP-EVA|Well, I didn't think that was supposed to happen.||CDR-EVA|And I'd know, Jack? Shoot! Thought I had them on the Rover.||LMP-EVA|What?||CDR-EVA|Oh, the core cap covers. I'll get them.||LMP-EVA|No, you got some there in that little ca - in that little pocket - in that little pocket. Yes, and there's so many bags in here, I can't get at them. No, I mean the pocket on the Rover, on the back. Remember?||CDR-EVA|No, they're not. I took them out and put them on you.||LMP-EVA|Oh, okay.||CDR-EVA|The rest of them are in this bag. I'll come and get them.||CDR-EVA|... This other - but I don't want to get into your seat. We got those bags pi - packed in there like gangbusters. How are you doing there by yourself?||LMP-EVA|Well, it's hard.||CDR-EVA|Your hook came off. If you wait a minute, I'll hook it on this bag. See. See.||LMP-EVA|I never - I didn't think the sample bag could come off the camera. But they can.||CDR-EVA|Yes. Doggone it.||||||Tape 95A/35||LMP-EVA|What's your problem?||CDR-EVA|Just as well fix this bag now. Let me get this bag - it's going to come off at the bottom if we don't. It's going to come off again. I don't think the harness is tight enough now.||LMP-EVA|Want to tighten the harness?||CDR-EVA|Yes, I got to, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Let me get your harness - I might just as well do it, so it's right. If it's worth doing at all, it's worth doing right. Now, let me try getting that bag back on. No, don't bend over, I can't get down there.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|You're plenty short enough.||LMP-EVA|Thanks - thanks a lot. (Laughter)||CDR-EVA|Just think, that hook - or something changes the geometry.||CC|Okay, don't worry about it too much, guys; I'm sure the bag will stay on without the hook.||CDR-EVA|Yes, it will; the conclusion I just came to.||LMP-EVA|You through?||CDR-EVA|Yes, go ahead.|05 22 05 38|LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob, what I know is a blue-gray breccia f:: in bag 525 •||CC|Okay, copy that. And, Jack, you just skipping up -scooping up little rocks along the ... here - in your little xenolith mode? Go ahead, Gene.||LMP-EVA|Yes, ... you read my mind. I do want to get one of these light-colored rocks, though.||||Tape 95A/36||||CC|Go ahead, Gene.||CDR-EVA|Bob, the - when I broke the cores apart, there's just a lot of dried clods and - and the bottom core's full, the top core about - oh, I got to look - it's dark down there, but about an inch -inch and a half of the core is just - just zero g to l/6 g'd itself right out.||CC|Okay, we copy that. I guess we still just cover it, and see what we got. Might just again trying compacting it after that's through; after you're done with the lower core.||CDR-EVA|Yes. I'11 do that.||CC|And, Geno, how about - -|05 22 07 23|LMP-EVA|Bag 526.||CC|Copy; 526.||CDR-EVA|Okay, in a long can - I'll give it to you; wait a minute. That may have been a piece of gabbro. But again, I can't be completely sure.||CC|Copy that. Go ahead, Gene.||CDR-EVA|It's either that or anorthositic gabbro we saw up on the front. Up on the massif.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|And my bags aren't staying on my camera worth a darn.|05 22 07 56|CDR-EVA|Forty-six, Bob, is going into the long can.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Boy, another exercise in dexterity. Okay, LMP has gone to INTERMEDIATE.|05 22 08 40|CDR-EVA|And, by the way, I'm at about h9 percent and 3.85 and INTERMEDIATE cooling and no flags.||||||Tape 95A/37||CC|Okay, copy that, Geno. Have you got a number for the upper core when you done - I guess you're probably putting the other one in the long can, aren't you, right now?||CDR-EVA|Yes, yes, yes; that's right.||CC|And somewhere here along the line, Jack, I guess maybe when you get those, you ought to stop and take the pan.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, the - the long can is sealed and I guess nobody knows what's in it but me.||CC|No one ever will, probably.||CDR-EVA|I may not - I may not even tell. It does not -none of the material in this core, in either the top section or the bottom section, look unlike that - that stuff just beneath the surface that we sampled at that special stop back there. It's a bluish-gray, and it tends to clod and break up in your hands. And that's core 31 - the number is 31.|05 22 09 4l|CC|Copy. Thirty-one on the ...||CDR-EVA|Oh, man. Bob, you've got better than - oh, you've got two-thirds of a core after I packed it down a little bit.||CC|Okay, thank you, Geno. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Okay, that little set of 4 samples is in 527, barely.||CC|Okay, we hope it was worth the effort.||LMP-EVA|Oh, It's all worth the effort; it just hurts.||CC|Okay. We're ready now for your pan and don't forget your scoop.||LMP-EVA|I won't - You don't mind a little dirt here and there, do you, ...?||||Tape 95A/38||||CC|No .||LMP-EVA|Oh, dadgummit. Well - -||CC|Hey, Gene, would you help - would you go over and help Twinkletoes, please?||LMP-EVA|I tell you - you fix that camera bracket so the backs stay on and I'11 be a lot better off.||CC|Roger.||CDR-EVA|Want some help, Jack? I'll be there.||LMP-EVA|No, I don't need any help.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||CC|Jack, you might worry about whether your camera lens is dirty or clean, Jack. I don't know what you could do about it.||LMP-EVA|I'm very worried about that.||CC|I don't know what you could do about it, but you might worry about it.||LMP-EVA|I don't have a thing to do - it's clean.||CDR-EVA|Well, I'll be a son of a gun.||LMP-EVA|What's your problem?||CDR-EVA|(Chuckle) can't get this thing locked on.||LMP-EVA|What the - -||CDR-EVA|The rake!||LMP-EVA|The rake?||CDR-EVA|Yes. That should lock. I turn that like that -there it comes.||CC|Jack, have you ever started your pan, so we get an EMU check from you?||||||Tape 95A/39|05 22 13 00|LMP-EVA|Well, it's about 50 percent. About 385.||CC|Okay, copy that.||LMP-EVA|And no flags. ... Come on. Get back in there.||CDR-EVA|Okay, that's all put away. That goes back on your back. I'll get it.||CC|Why don't you go over and — over towards Jack, Gene, and then the two of you can pick up the scoop and the bag together and get back towards the Rover after that?||CDR-EVA|Yes, I'm cleaning up this seat here- I'll do that I think I can hack it.||CC|And then, at that point, we're ready for you guys ... and, at that point, we're ready for you guys to leave.||CDR-EVA|Whew - Okay. Jack, I've got the rammer I've got to put on you. I'll just leave it on your seat right now?||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CC|We're watching you, Jack.||LMP-EVA|What's that?||CC|I said we're watching you, but don't let that inhibit you.||LMP-EVA|I don't - Bob, I don't let anything inhibit me -and I don't stay mad very long.||CC|That was very good.||LMP-EVA|(Laughter) Well, there's an easy way to do everything. The question is can you hang on to it once you've done it?||CDR-EVA|Let me get those, Jack. Don't get down there. Let me get those.||||Tape 95A/40||||LMP-EVA|Where are you? They don't stay on my camera anymore.||CDR-EVA|Well, we'll fix it.||LMP-EVA|There's no reason why they shouldn't, according to this. But there are a lot - -||CDR-EVA|The samples from that - Oh - I need it -Wait I gotta go up there. Take an after - cross-Sun, from over to the north of the gnomon.||LMP-EVA|You didn't get an after, huh?||CDR-EVA|No.||LMP-EVA|How come you're cleaning up the Rover?||CDR-EVA|Oh, I'll get it.||CDR-EVA|If you'll mount this thing.||LMP-EVA|Just set it there. Just set it there. I'll take four deep breaths.||CDR-EVA|Bob, what else do you want us to do here?||CC|Nothing. Get on the Rover and leave. Get the heck out.|05 22 16 03|CC|Don't forget the gnomon.||LMP-EVA|Okay. We're going back to get that after - and we won't forget it.||CDR-EVA|I think you might be able to decipher this station, Bob.||CC|That's the general idea. And be advised that the switchboard here at MSC has been lit up by calls from the Houston Ballet Foundation requesting your services for next season.||||||Tape 95A/41||CDR-EVA|I should hope so. Well, we can't use that one. The right-hand gate lock is - how's that - nonfunctional and the left one is almost nonfunctional.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|We - once you get it open, you can't get it locked. I'll dust them if I get a chance, but it's locked on the left side.||CC|Okay, well, we'll keep those bags under your feet, anyway.||LMP-EVA|Here, I'll work on it.||CC|I think the samples are safer under there, anyway.||CDR-EVA|We don't have any room. ... we can take bag 7 out.||CDR-EVA|That one is locked - in good shape.||CDR-EVA|Let's press on. We got the reading? Let me put the rammer on your back and see if we can't get this on your camera.|05 22 17 42|LMP-EVA|Are we going to run the SEP this time?||CDR-EVA|I don't know; he hasn't said anything. I expect he will.||CC|No, we will not turn the SEP on, Jack. You might cover it with a blanket as well as you can. And how about a temperature reading before you leave, when you do that?||CDR-EVA|It's 100.||CC|Copy that, 100, and understand both switches are OFF and the covers are closed.||CDR-EVA|Well, the covers are closed now. They weren't.||CC|Okay. Roger. That's what I mean.||||Tape 95A/42||||CDR-EVA|Okay. Turn - turn the other way, left. I think it might just put you there.||LMP-EVA|Well, I don't know why it isn't staying on, but it certainly isn't.||LMP-EVA|... Move over there.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Is that the same one? I may have bent it.||CDR-EVA|I think you did now. Yes.||LMP-EVA|I just bent that, didn't I?||CDR-EVA|Yes, that's not going to stay on. Yes, you bent it (laughter) very well.||LMP-EVA|... how I did that?||CDR-EVA|I don't know ... You'll lose these bags.||LMP-EVA|Okay, well, we'11 - -||CDR-EVA|I got bags.||LMP-EVA|We'll revise our procedures.||CDR-EVA|I got bags.||LMP-EVA|I guess I bent my camera mounting brae - point, the camera point.||CDR-EVA|Turn around.||LMP-EVA|We may have to - think about a fix there.||CDR-EVA|We might be able to fix that in the cockpit.||LMP-EVA|Yes .||CC|Okay - -||LMP-EVA|Okay, are we all through, have you got - -||||||Tape 95A/43||CC|- - worry about that right, when you get back in.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Okay, where are we here?||CDR-EVA|I'll get on.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Oh, I guess I need to get another film mag, huh?||CC|Okay, how about frame counts on both you guys before you start?|05 22 19 43|LMP-EVA|152 on the LMP -||CC|We suggest magaline - magazine Juliett, please.||CDR-EVA|(Laughter) Okay, we'll get magaline Julieing. The CDR's on 118.||CC|Okay, copy that, Geno.||LMP-EVA|Fire fire, two frames. You know, I'd enjoy this if it weren't so much fun.||CDR-EVA|Okay, you going to change your mag.||LMP-EVA|Yes .||CDR-EVA|Shoot a 500 while you're doing that. (Laughter)||LMP-EVA|Listen to me - -||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Look at my thumb.||LMP-EVA|I know.||CC|17, we'd really like the — -||LMP-EVA|Any time you want to do something, though.||CC|- - we'd like to press on as quickly as possible.||CDR-EVA|I got it.||LMP-EVA|Got it.||||Tape 95A/44||||CDR-EVA|Got it.||CC|In case you didn't get.||CDR-EVA|Take a portion of the scarp over there you can see.||CC|17, do you copy? Houston.||CDR-EVA|What?||CC|We'd like to press on - -||CDR-EVA|What?||CC|- - as soon as possible, please.|05 22 20 48|CDR-EVA|Yes, we are, Bob, but - but he's got to change his mag.||CC|Roger.||CDR-EVA|I'm going to stand here and look around.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Okay, I'm picking up with mag - or with frame 56 and I'm going to try to get a little bit of where the scarp overlaps the North Massif. I can't see much of it. All I could get was three frames of that. Now I'm picking up the South Massif.||CDR-EVA|Okay, how are you coming, Jack?||LMP-EVA|Okay. Oh, I ought to put that in there so you’ve got room for your camera.||CC|You got a final frame count there, Gene?||LMP-EVA|Okay, I'm all set.|05 22 22 51|LMP-EVA|"Okay, Bob. When I finished with South Massii"", I was on 94 and I took - now I'm on 99 - I took five more pictures back over to the northeast."||CC|We copy that. And we assume you guys are ready to go by now.||||||Tape 95A/45||CDR-EVA|And, Bob, they were all with the lens - Yes, sir -they were all with the lens cap off.||CC|Splendid.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CC|Okay. And, Jack, what's the headings say? And we'll - -||LMP-EVA|Why don't you fix that high gain so you can see?||CC|We'll - we'll get the reading we need for the nav update. Do you think you can give us the heading right now?||LMP-EVA|Okay, heading is 4l - I think. I'm at a little bit of an angle. Better let Gene do it for you.||CC|Okay. We're waiting.||LMP-EVA|I got some - Gee, I've got some parallax. I think it's 4l, though.||CDR-EVA|What you looking at?||LMP-EVA|The headings.||CDR-EVA|43 - 043 is what I gave them earlier.|05 22 24 12|CC|Yes, we were wondering if it drifted while you were there, because we're going to give you now a - -||CDR-EVA|Bob, let me - -||CC|- - going to give you one to update it if it has drifted at all.||CDR-EVA|Okay, it did drift, 04l is a good number.||CC|Okay. Stand by.||CC|Okay. That's fine. No torque necessary, Geno.||LMP-EVA|I'm strapped.||||Tape 95A/46||||CDR-EVA|You liked the drift, huh?||CC|Great.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I'll - Dadgummit.||LMP-EVA|What's wrong? Oh, the hammer?||CDR-EVA|Yes. Every time. Okay, let's go.||CDR-EVA|All right, sport. I'm going to head -||LMP-EVA|We didn't really do all the things we wanted do, but I think we did everything we could.|to|CC|We did everything we wanted to ... time line||LMP-EVA|Okay, let's get ready to roll.||CDR-EVA|Flight line stereo.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob - Oh -||LMP-EVA|You got the TGE ... on and the low gain is 060.||CDR-EVA|You get the gnomon in?||LMP-EVA|Didn't you get it?||CDR-EVA|Wait a minute.||CDR-EVA|You took the after. It's not sitting out there.||LMP-EVA|No, I thought I handed - didn't you stick it|"in"""|CDR-EVA|Yes, I stuck it in. I got it. Okay. We can look back (laughter).||CDR-EVA|Bob.||LMP-EVA|I sure thought I handed It to you, Geno.||CDR-EVA|You did, and I put it in.||LMP-EVA|Okay, that's good. Okay, whoo-boy, rest the hands .|old|||||Tape 95A/47||CC|Okay, we've recommendations for MINIMUM for you. Gene - Jack.||LMP-EVA|... ejecta. It's double.||CDR-EVA|I think I am in MINIMUM.||CC|J ack, ... - J ack.||CDR-EVA|I am already.||LMP-EVA|Yes, I'll go to MINIMUM. Yes, I will.||CC|And give us a mark rolling, please.|05 22 26 24|CDR-EVA|Yes, Bob, I gave you one. We've been rolling for about 30 seconds.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|We're at 087 - 087 and 5*9 on that range.||CC|Copy that.||CC|And the drive to station 4 will be nominal and we'll get a Rover sample at about 094/5.1 but it will be the track as indicated on the map and the cuff checklist.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Going to Shorty.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|On our way.||LMP-EVA|You got your checklist there?||CDR-EVA|Yes, I got it in front of me.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|And, we're heading - heading is 069, around -Well, up - I got it -||LMP-EVA|Yes, that's pretty close.||||Tape 95A/48||||CDR-EVA|I know we're next to that band but I know where we're going, next is 094/5-1 is what I want for that sample.||LMP-EVA|Yeah. Zero what?||CDR-EVA|I think he said 094/5.1.||LMP-EVA|He meant - 052 is what's nominal. What's the sample again, Bob?|05 22 27 39|CC|5.1; 094/5.1.|05 22 27 48|LMP-EVA|Oh, okay, that's the heading.||CDR-EVA|All right. You got 451.||LMP-EVA|Yes, got it.||CDR-EVA|Just drive by this big rock. Want to look at it. Can't see it. I can't see when that off LCRU shines into my eyes.||LMP-EVA|Looks like one of the gray breccias.||CDR-EVA|Big 3-meter - 3- to 4-meter block out here all by itself on the light mantle - I got some pictures It was at 088/5.6.||CC|Okay, copy that.||LMP-EVA|And it looked like a gray breccia, I'm not sure though, all I could see was the surface texture, and it had the modular or elongate modular texture that those breccias had up on the South Massif.||CC|Okay, copy that, Jack.||CDR-EVA|Where are you, Shorty? And the battery temperatures are 100 and 130.|05 22 29 06|CC|Copy that.||||||Tape 95A/49||LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob, as far as any of the things we talked about trying to see at the surface, dynamics or a variation of the light mantle, I think you've heard it all, there isn't much to say about the dynamics right now. I have a feeling that the surfaces are old enough that all those kind of detailed relationships have been obscured. ... is just about the same all over here, it varies, but there are no systeraatics that I've seen.||CC|Okay, copy that. Do we ever see a Rover flag come up when you've got high temperatures there on the battery - have you seen the flag up yet?||CDR-EVA|No, you didn't. No, you did not, you did not.||CC|Okay, that may be telling us something, we hope. Press on.||LMP-EVA|Okay. LMP is in MINIMUM.||CC|Copy that, thank you.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Ought to cut left up here a little bit.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I think so. Oh.||LMP-EVA|Don't - Keep her going.||CDR-EVA|(Laughter)||LMP-EVA|Good gosh! Was that a - ... aspect ratio of that little thing.||LMP-EVA|Yes, that's what they call a pit crater. Can you swing a little bit and let me get that fragment crater - see that one on your left there?||CDR-EVA|Quite a scene up here. Got your pictures? Pictures?|05 22 31 04|LMP-EVA|Yes, I got them.||||Tape 95A/50||||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. We're at 090/5*3 for a quick Rover sample of a very, very fragmental crater. The ejecta is about 50-percent small angular fragments much different than we have seen before in terms of the type of patterns.||CC|Okay, copy.|05 22 31 35|CDR-EVA|Okay, and that's in bag 4l Yankee.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 95B/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|05 22 32 09|CC|Ron, we need REACQ and NARROW and the dials at 25 and 195 as is in the Flight Plan.||CMP|Huh?

LMP frame count is 15-||CC|Copy that.|05 22 31 58|CDR-EVA|About a 30-second stop. Okay, 094 - I'm 090 , 5-3 now, Bob. We're heading toward your stop.||CC|Okay, 090, 5-3.||LMP-EVA|See Shorty out there yet?||CDR-EVA|Well, I -|05 22 32 17|LMP-EVA|Bob, I couldn't tell whether that was just - it looked like that that might have been a crater that had got to bedrock. There may have been a high point, or let's say a thin point in the light mantle, and it got down to bedrock. But I can't - It's the most blocky-rimmed crater we've seen for a long time.||CDR-EVA|Yes. All these others are nowhere near that -look at that.||LMP-EVA|No. It was about 15 meters in diameter.||LMP-EVA|Bob, there - there are no obvious lineations, at the scale we can observe, on the light mantle. I think the pan photography and the metric stuff may be what you'll have to use for any directional trends out in here. Depending on what we decide the origin is.||LMP-EVA|Bob, are you still reading?||||Tape 96A/2||||CC|Roger. We're still reading you, Jack.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Are you reading us through the LM or through the low gain?||CC|As far as I can tell, we're reading you through the low gain. It's been working just great tonight, Geno.||CDR-EVA|Okay, that's great - -||LMP-EVA|Tonigftt?||CDR-EVA|- - because I just scraped bottom on the LCRU. If it's still working, I'm glad to hear that.|05 22 33 54|CDR-EVA|Okay, we're 093 and 5-2. We're almost there.||LMP-EVA|Going to be right on the rim of that crater.|05 22 34 08|CC|Okay. And, 17, the word from the backroom is -with that last Rover sample you got, we'd like to go straight to station 4 - and we won't get the one here at 094 and 5*3 - 5-ls excuse me.||LMP-EVA|Bob, I thought the purpose was to sample the light mantle?||CC|I - We talked to them about that, but they - -||LMP-EVA|We didn't sample light mantle at that last one.||CC|- - I agree. I talked to them about that. But they are so anxious to get to station 4, I guess they don't want to do it.||LMP-EVA|Well, how about it, Gene? A little real time -||CDR-EVA|I think we got to, right here.||LMP-EVA|I think we got to.|05 22 34 48|CDR-EVA|094, 5*1. You got your picture?||LMP-EVA|Yes. Okay, that's good enough.||CDR-EVA|You happy?||||||Tape 96A/3||LMP-EVA|We'll get the sample - anyway.|05 22 34 58|CDR-EVA|Okay. 094, 5-1.||CC|Copy that.|05 22 35 02|CDR-EVA|That's good, Jack, Sample is in 42 Yankee.||CC|Copy that.|05 22 35 13|CDR-EVA|And we are rolling. And give me a bearing and a range to station 4.||CC|Roger. It will be bearing of 100 and range of 4.6.|05 22 35 29|CDR-EVA|Okay. We're now at 5-0 - 094 and 50.|05 22 35 33|LMP-EVA|LMP frame count is 25.||CDR-EVA|Was that 100, 4.6?||CC|Roger, Gene.||LMP-EVA|Houston, there aren't very many rocks that just sit on the surface. All of them seem to - to be slightly buried to moderately buried. That one looked like it might be vesicular. There's a trench - linear set of craters.||CDR-EVA|Hold it, babe. We got to do a little detouring.||LMP-EVA|Okay, what we're looking for is 101 - -||CDR-EVA|Yes. 100, 4.6, I'll detour. I'll just get down this slope. I don't see Shorty though, do you?||LMP-EVA|Wait a minute, Is that it? Is that it out there straight ahead?||CDR-EVA|Well, let me get down this slope.||LMP-EVA|Something's dark out there. I think that's it.||CDR-EVA|The - the dark - It might be right over there to the left a little bit?||||Tape 96A/4||||LMP-EVA|Your left, yes.||CDR-EVA|Yes, right over there. I think I can cut it right across there. That's going to be about the right place.||LMP-EVA|Seems a little far from here - but - maybe not.||LMP-EVA|Oh, I forgot to take pictures again. Trying to shade my eyes. That Scarp certainly is spectacular gcing up there by Hanover, isn't it?||CDR-EVA|It just rolls over the side, doesn't it?||LMP-EVA|Yes.|05 22 38 00|LMP-EVA|I don't know what else we can say about it, though (chuckle). Okay, we're getting a good view of the North Massif, and the cross-hatched lineaments that Gene has talked about are over there, also. They seem to be a set that - that plunge about, oh, 30 degrees to the east and another set that plunge about the same to the west. Plus the boulder tracks, which we see occasionally over there. And there are areas - boulder fields up on the Massif itself, such as we saw on the South Massif. As a matter of fact, it looks like there's one just above where we may - where station 6 may be. Straight ahead of us there, Geno.||CDR-EVA|Um-huon.|05 22 39 02|LMP-EVA|About bearing OoO from our present position, which is 098 and 4.8.||CDR-EVA|If I change that heading, that LCRU comes right in on me.||LMP-EVA|1 don't see any - anything like layering up there. Although the upper boundary of those boulder fields on the North Massif, and, as a matter of fact, on the South Massif - -||CDR-EVA|That's Shorty straight ahead of us, I think. Yes, yes, that's got to be it.||||||Tape 96A/5||LMP-EVA|- - all tend to have a linear boundary. That's the upper portion of the field; the lower portion is strung out downslope. That looks like it might be Shorty. Yes.|05 22 40 07|CDR-EVA|We're at 9 - 099, 4.7, Bob.||CC|Okay, great. Sounds like you're just about there.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I think we got it in front of us.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Bob, looking at the Sculptured Hills, I think Gene's comments the other day about Bare Mountain would apply. There's a small relief - or small amplitude hummockiness to the surface. It's formed by cross-hatch of - Let's say the slope I'm looking at is sort of west-facing slope. So on the other side of Wessex Cleft, it's formed by lineaments going - plunging about 10 degrees to the north and about 10 degrees to the south. And the combination gives some hummocks that are quite distinct.||CDR-EVA|Well, you know it's hard to see a blanket here, but that's got to be Shorty right there.||LMP-EVA|Okay - -||CDR-EVA|It's the only large - real large -||LMP-EVA|We want to park. I don't think we'll see a blanket down - -||CDR-EVA|I don't either.||LMP-EVA|It - Well, I think - At least we're going to see where the break in slope is for the rim. My goodness.||CDR-EVA|Oh, look at the boulders sitting on that rim.||LMP-EVA|It's different.||CDR-EVA|It is darker.||||Tape 96A/6||||LMP-EVA|Let's go over there.|05 22 4l 42|CDR-EVA|No question. We're at 101, 4.5-||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Okay - -||CC|Let us know when you stop and where you're - -||CDR-EVA|Which rim do you want to park on?||LMP-EVA|Well, I think we ought to park over here near that big boulder.||CDR-EVA|Yes - yes, if I can get up there. I think I can.||LMP-EVA|You can swing in, you know, and just park parallel to the - Of course, that will put them looking back. What - Can you park any direction?||CDR-EVA|Well, yes, but 045 gives me a good - Let me - I'll work on it.||LMP-EVA|Okay.'||CDR-EVA|Let me get up there slowly. I'll put them on this low saddle here. 045 will give them a good heading.||LMP-EVA|Shorty is a crater, the size of which you know. It's obviously darker rimmed, although the fragment population for most of the blanket does not seem too different than the light mantle. But inside -Whoo , whoo, whoo!||CDR-EVA|Man, are you going to get a picture now.||LMP-EVA|Oh, yes.||CC|We can hardly wait.||CDR-EVA|That's about as far as I want to take iti||CC|Okay. And when you stop and get off, give me word and I'll read you up some revised plans for station 4.||||||Tape 96A/7|05 22 42 57|CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, we're heading 04l; bearing is 102; distance, 5«1; and 4.4 on the range. Amp-hours are 92, 90, 102. And 128 on the batteries. Off-scale low on the fronts, and off-scale low on the rears.||CC|Copy that. And did I understand 4.2 on the range, Gene?||CDR-EVA|Yes sir!||CC|Okay. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|I don't know whether you're wrong, or we are, but - -||CC|Sounds like an interesting crater, in any case.||CDR-EVA|- - this is an impressive one.||LMP-EVA|Wait until you see the bottom of it.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Houston. Shorty is clearly a darker rimmed crater. The inner wall is quite blocky over - but except for the western portion of it, which is less blocky than the others. The floor is hummocky, as we thought it was in the photograph. The central peak, if you will, or central mound, is very blocky and jagged. And the impression I have of the other mounds in the bottom is that they may - they look like Scarp masses that may have come off the side.||CC|Okay; copy that and - -||LMP-EVA|That's just what they look like. I'm not sure that - They have a - they have a bench appearance.||CC|- - Okay, and the primary priority - number 1 and 2 priorities - at this station will be samples from the crater rim and the pan from the crater rim. Over.||||Tape 96A/8||||LMP-EVA|Okay, we've got a large boulder of very intensely fractured rock, right on the rim, right near the Rover. It looks like - it looks like a finely vesicular version of our clinopyroxene gabbro. It's obviously crystalline and has generally that same appearance. There is, in one spot here, some inclusions of a darker gray rock also intensely fractured. The fracture systems, I think, will show up well in the flight line stereo.|05 22 45 48|CDR-EVA|Bob, do you have TV?|05 22 45 50|CC|Roger. We have TV, and you might brush the lens for us before you run away.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I'll get it. I've got to get my battery covers cleaned.||LMP-EVA|Okay, I'm going to take a pan while I'm waiting for you.||CC|And we're going to want the SEP opened and dusted as well here so we'll be - switches turned off.||CDR-EVA|Ooo-kaay. Ooo-kaay.|05 22 46 22|LMP-EVA|Oh, hey - Wait a minute - -||CDR-EVA|What?||LMP-EVA|- - Where are the reflections? I've been fooled once. There is orange soil!||CDR-EVA|Well, don't move it until I see it.||LMP-EVA|It's all over! Orange!||CDR-EVA|Don't move It until I see it.||LMP-EVA|I stirred it up with my feet.||CDR-EVA|Hey, it Is! I can see it from here!||LMP-EVA|It's orange!||CDR-EVA|Wait a minute, let me put my visor up. It's still orange!||||||Tape 96A/9||LMP-EVA|Sure it is! Crazy! Orange! I've got to dig a trench, Houston.||CC|Copy that, I guess we'd better work fast.||CDR-EVA|Hey, he's not - he's not going out of his wits. It really is.||CC|Is it the same color as cheese?|05 22 47 07|CDR-EVA|Temperature on the SEP is about 100 and - temperature on the SEP's about 102.||LMP-EVA|It's almost the same color as the LMP decal on my camera.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|That is orange, Jack!||CDR-EVA|Boy, this brush is getting harder to get on and off too. But I sure don't want to lose it. Man, I may start putting that under my seat. Well, zap me with a little cold water. Okay, the SEP has been dusted. I think I gave you 102 or something like that.||LMP-EVA|Fantastic, sports fans. It's trench time. You can see this in your color television, I'll bet you.||CDR-EVA|How can there be orange soil on the Moon?||CDR-EVA|Jack, that is really orange. It's been oxidized. Go around and get the lunar sounder [sic] over here.||LMP-EVA|It looks just like - an oxidized desert soil, that's exactly right.||CDR-EVA|Well, I'm going to clean their glasses so they don't - so they know we're - Can you wait a minute on that - on that pan you're taking?||LMP-EVA|I already took it.||CDR-EVA|'So, I mean the television camera. I'll put you back where I had you.||||Tape 96A/10||||CDR-EVA|Wow, I'll let you put your - right where you finished your pan.||LMP-EVA|You know - that orange - that orange is along a line, Geno, along the rim crest -||CDR-EVA|To follow - what? Circum - circumferential?||LMP-EVA|Yes. Man, if there ever was a (chuckle) -I'm not going to say it. But if there ever was something that looked like a fumarole alteration, this is it.||CDR-EVA|Okay, let me give you a gravimeter - -|05 22 49 42|CDR-EVA|MARK it.||CC|Okay, mark the gravimeter.||CDR-EVA|And she is flashing. Oh, never mind, Bob. I'm going to go to STANDBY. I've got to get my gnomon.||LMP-EVA|Hey, I think we hit one of those things we've got to reconsider on, Houston.||CC|Yes. The problem is we're looking at PLSS constraints right now, as luck would have it, of course.|02 55 50 15|CDR-EVA|MARK it. Gravimeter.||CC|Roger. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|What's wrong with the TV? Aren't you watching it?||CC|It seems to have died slowly there.||CDR-EVA|Well, stand by. Wow, I'm going to give you another STANDBY and another MARK.||CC|Okay.|05 22 50 56|CDR-EVA|STANDBY, ON, and -|05 22 51 00|CDR-EVA|MARK it.||CC|Copy that.||||||Tape 96A/II||LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob, I've trenched across the trend of the yellow - or the orange. There is light gray material on either side.||CDR-EVA|Oh, man, that's incredible.||LMP-EVA|Say, Gene, we're going to have to - -||CDR-EVA|That's incredible.||LMP-EVA|You need to get a down-Sun color - -||CDR-EVA|That's incredible.||LMP-EVA|- - as well as - I'll get my black-and-white.||CDR-EVA|I'll get it.||LMP-EVA|We also got to get that rock up there - that's - -||CDR-EVA|Yes, we'll get that. Okay, let's start sampling that trench. We've got to get - that's - -||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|- - That's phenomenal. Look at where the contact between the gray and the -||LMP-EVA|Yes. Right, and it's on both sides - -||CDR-EVA|Before you disturb it, let me just get a couple of closeups of that.||LMP-EVA|Hey, can you get a down-Sun? I think your color will be best down-Sun.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Go to f/ll. Get a little closer, Geno, if you think you're minimum.||LMP-EVA|Come up. There you go.||CDR-EVA|Let me get one more. Hey, you want any of this bagged in a - in the can, Bob? Canned in the bag -or whatever it is?||||Tape 96A/12||||CC|Stand by. They're debating that right now.||CDR-EVA|Are they?||CC|Roger. Let's get the short can for some of that and - -||LMP-EVA|Okay, the color is - -||CDR-EVA|Okay let us get the - let us sample it first, then we'11 get it.||LMP-EVA|It's quite - it's - it's indurated.||LMP-EVA|Aah - Go back and get that one.||CDR-EVA|Go get a new chunk.||LMP-EVA|I'll go get a new chunk.||CDR-EVA|Give me that, and get a new one. Give me that. Get some more.||LMP-EVA|I'm going to slow down here.||CDR-EVA|Yes, just take it easy.||LMP-EVA|I can't see into this.||CDR-EVA|I can't see when your shadow is there.||LMP-EVA|Can you get around on the other side?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Because I can't see to sample.||LMP-EVA|Oh. Well. Yes, that's it.||CDR-EVA|See if you can get a sample right across that contact too.||LMP-EVA|I will. Okay, bag that one.|05 22 53 49|CDR-EVA|Bag 509 has got the - the orange material from, oh, about 2 to 3 inches down.||||||Tape 96A/13|05 22 54 02|CC|Copy that.||CC|Okay, we're suggesting INTERMEDIATE for you, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Okay, the light gray, which is on either side - we sample the - the - Want me to get some more?||CDR-EVA|Yes, a little more.||LMP-EVA|It's - all of this is getting mixed a little bit with a - about a half-centimeter thick light-gray or a medium-gray covering over the whole area.|05 22 54 57|CDR-EVA|Bob, the gray material that is adjacent to the red material is In at 5 - how would I say 510.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|I had it, and I can't see it now.||LMP-EVA|And the LMP is INTERMEDIATE.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|510, Bob.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|And that - and that orange band is about a meter wide, I think.||LMP-EVA|About a meter.||CDR-EVA|You can't get to the end of it - bottom of it though, can you?||LMP-EVA|I haven't been able to yet.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Just to be sure, why don't we sample this side of it, too?||CDR-EVA|Then I'm going to go get the can.||LMP-EVA|Okay - one.||||Tape 96A/14||||CDR-EVA|If I can remember where we put it. Bob, where did we put the small can?||LMP-EVA|It's in the - it's in bag 7 under my seat.|05 22 55 40|CDR-EVA|Okay. That's good. 511 has the gray from the other side of the orange band. And the other side happens to be the crater side.||LMP-EVA|That's right. North side.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Why don't you look around a minute, and I'll get that can.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I'm going to see - see if this goes on down here as a zone.||CDR-EVA|It looks like it's - ellipsoidal area if my footprints are any indication.||CC|17» Houston. We'd like to get the double core here instead of the small can. - Double core, please, instead of the small can.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Did you want it in the orange?||CC|Roger. That affirm. We can put cores in gray soil all the time.||LMP-EVA|Well, it's a vertical stratigraphy. Do you want to go sideways a little with it? Or you just want to get it as deep as you can, huh?|05 22 56 52|CC|I expect we want to get - let's go as deep as we can in the orange, please, there, Jack. And the one problem at this station, Jack, is not that - -||LMP-EVA|All right.||CC|- - we can ... decide priorities between this station or any other station. It's the fact that we're running up against the walkback constraints here in just a very few minutes, about 20 minutes.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||||||Tape 96A/15|05 22 57 15|CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, and the bottom will be 44, and the top will be 35•||CC|Copy that. And after the core, we'd like for you to go over and sample some of that - some of the big rocks there on the rim, if you could very quickly. That'll be the next order of priority aft er that.||LMP-EVA|We will.||CDR-EVA|Yes, sir.||CC|And I'm not sure whether your pan will look down into the crater or not, Jack. But if it didn't, we'd like to get another one from there. Hey, there's the crater.||CDR-EVA|It did. Yes - yes - look into it yourself and -and then, I'll also get you a stereo pan before we leave. I can do that.||CC|Roger. That's some crater.||LMP-EVA|Got your hammer?||CDR-EVA|Yes. I've practiced too long on taking stereo pans of craters, without getting one here.||LMP-EVA|I got mine from right - just right down there, Gene So -||CDR-EVA|What is that right there?||LMP-EVA|What?||CDR-EVA|That right there.||LMP-EVA|I don't see - Oh, it's a piece of glass, probably.||CDR-EVA|Boy, it sure is.||LMP-EVA|Hey, how about right up here?||||Tape 96A/I6||||LMP-EVA|You know that - we were almost - we just about got (laugh) to the upper edge of this little ellipsoid zone. I think we're going to have to - we've messed up most of it. Let's try right over here.||CDR-EVA|I've got a little piece of glass in my pocket.||LMP-EVA|Bob, the upper portion of the core is going to be a little bit disturbed, because we've walked around the area so much.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|There was a little piece of black glass - -||LMP-EVA|You may want to get up here - -||CDR-EVA|- - solid black glass.||LMP-EVA|Okay. That - did you get a - hold it, and I'll get a shot.|05 22 59 26|CDR-EVA|Take your picture. That's about as far as I could shove it in.||CC|Okay. And, 17, while you're doing that, was the gray mantle over the top of this, or was this showing all the way through to the surface?||LMP-EVA|No, it was over the top. It was about a half a centimeter over the top.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|He's getting about - about 3 centimeters a whack.||CC|Very good.||CDR-EVA|I'll tell you, it's a lot harder going in than that double core was back there. It's pretty hard.||LMP-EVA|It acts like it's inherently cohesive. It breaks up in angular fragments.||CC|Copy that.||||||Tape 96A/17||LMP-EVA|An essential portion of the zone is - actually has a crimson hue, or red hue. Outside of that it's orange. And outside of that, it's gray.||CDR-EVA|Pardon me, Jack.||LMP-EVA|That's all right, take it easy. I'd offer to hit it, but I don't think I can, my hands are so tired.||CDR-EVA|I'm going up to max here for just a minute or 2.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Okay, let me hit some more. Ready?||LMP-EVA|Yes, go ahead.||CDR-EVA|Watch it - I'm afraid. Jack, it's stable enough. Why don't you get out of the way? I'm afraid if I leave go of this thing, you'll get it in the head.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Have at it. He's still getting a centimeter a whack, poor guy. Let's see. I didn't get a locator, I better get a locator. Oh, it's in the -No, it isn't.|05 23 01 05|CDR-EVA|The only thing I question is our ability to get it out. Man, that's really hit bottom.||LMP-EVA|Has it?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Okay, do I have core tubes on me now? I mean caps?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Caps .||CDR-EVA|Yes, sir.||LMP-EVA|And the rammer.||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Okay - only -||||Tape 96A/I8||||CDR-EVA|That's all the way down. But, I really - -||LMP-EVA|That's it. Thanks, Geno.||CDR-EVA|- - I really wonder about getting it out.||LMP-EVA|Well, we'll give it the old college try.||CDR-EVA|Yes, we ought to be good at getting cores out by now.||LMP-EVA|It'11 come out.||CDR-EVA|Wow! Okay.||LMP-EVA|It wouldn't dare not come out - wait a minute - -||CDR-EVA|Is there enough to hold on to?||LMP-EVA|Whoops - Which side you got?||CDR-EVA|I was just getting this out for you. Let me - I can get this side better.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|You ready?||LMP-EVA|Okay.|05 23 01 57|CDR-EVA|Go. Okay, pull slowly. Slowly so I can cap it all right. Let me get a cap.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Hold it - hold it - let me get a cap.||LMP-EVA|All right, get the cap.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Now, wait a minute.||LMP-EVA|Are you ready?||CDR-EVA|Okay, very slow. Even the core tube is red!||LMP-EVA|Look at that!||||||Tape 96A/19||CDR-EVA|Even the core is red! The bottom one's black -black and orange, and the top one's gray and orange!||LMP-EVA|The fact is, the bottom of the core is very black compared to anything we've seen.||CDR-EVA|Hey, we must have gone through the red soil because it's filled, but it's filled with a black material.||LMP-EVA|Let me see, Gene.||CDR-EVA|Dark gray, almost a very very fine grained - -||LMP-EVA|That might be a magnet - magnetite.||CC|Fantastic.||CDR-EVA|||LMP-EVA|I got it.||CC|Fantastic.||LMP-EVA|Go ahead.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|But it, it, it -||LMP-EVA|Let me - God, it is black isn't it?||CDR-EVA|Yes. I've got to get it so I can get the - Boy, it is black and is it contrasted to that orange stuff. Very black. Well, not very black. It's a good dark gray. Very dark bluish gray.||LMP-EVA|Yes - contrast.||CDR-EVA|Okay, turn that thing so I can push this cap a little bit. Just turn -||LMP-EVA|Which way?||CDR-EVA|Either way. Just turn the whole tube.||LMP-EVA|Oh, okay.||||Tape 96A/20||||CDR-EVA|It's just easier to turn the tube than my hand - -||LMP-EVA|(Laughter)|05 23 03 14|CDR-EVA|- - some more. I don't want this cap to come off. Okay. I'm going to INTERMEDIATE cooling. Okay. Now you don't have any caps, so let's take this back to the Rover.||LMP-EVA|Where's the hole?||CDR-EVA|Why don't you take a picture of the hole, while you've got a camera there?||LMP-EVA|Be careful with that.||CDR-EVA|Yes .||CC|The caps are in SCB-7. They're under the LMP seat.||LMP-EVA|Well, the hole's most - the hole's mostly in shadow.||CC|And, 17 - -||CDR-EVA|Yes, I got them Bob.|05 23 03 42|CC|- - And, 17, so you're at a spot - we'd like - We have to be leaving here - not like - we have to be here in 14 minutes on the move because of walkback constraints. And we'd like to get a quick sample of the basalt up there on the rim, and Gene's stereo pan, and then press on. And I emphasize that the walkback constraint we're up against in 14 minutes - 13 now.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob, I'll get a sample - I'll doc - I'll sample it by hand. But it'll be documented. And I'll get It in a bag in a minute since I don't have any.||CDR-EVA|Come back this way when you do. I need that rammer again.||LMP-EVA|Oh, okay. Well, I better come there first, I guess||||||Tape 96A/21||CDR-EVA|Well, I don't need it right this second - -||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CC|Why don't you leave the core there Gene, and you can take the stereo pan while Jack's getting that sample. And then you can get together and ram the core home.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Bob, the bottom of the upper core is also dark.||CC|Copy that. Sounds a little thin.||CDR-EVA|And, like you might expect, the top of the bottom core is dark, too.||CC|How about that.||LMP-EVA|||LMP-EVA|It - If I ever saw a classic alteration halo around a volcanic crater, this is it. It's ellipsoidal. It appears to be zoned. There's one sample we didn't get. We didn't get the more yellowy stuff, we got the center portion -||CDR-EVA|Let me get those caps, Jack. What's - That's what's holding it. Holding it from coming out.||LMP-EVA|Steal a bag.||CDR-EVA|Okay|05 23 06 10|LMP-EVA|Okay, the - I got it. Basalt is in bag 512.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|I'm getting in your bag here Gene. Got it. Okay.||CDR-EVA|Jack, our lock is on the outside here, so we ought to watch this gage.||LMP-EVA|What happened?||||Tape 96A/22|||05 23 07 00|CDR-EVA|Not going to worry about it. This lock is on the outside of that lever lock - out there. You'll see what I mean when you look at the lock. Okay, I'm going to go get my pan.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|The cores are not rammed yet. You want to ram them while you're here?||LMP-EVA|What did you do with my extension handle? Oh, it's -||CDR-EVA|Here. And If you want to ram them - -||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|- - there you are. They're not rammed.||LMP-EVA|I'll get them.|05 23 07 31|CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, I'm going several meters around to the east and towards the south to get this pan.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|And I - I'm going upslope. I'm circum - I'm - on the circum - Oh, you know, on the rim. And I'm up. Oh, that ought to be a beautiful shot, if I could see what my settings are.|05 23 07 57|LMP-EVA|Okay, the lower core is chucky-jam full. I don't think I've budged that thing.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||CC|Okay, and, Jack, I copied - aside from three trench samples, I copied one single rock - one single bag of basalt samples. Is that correct?|05 23 08 35|LMP-EVA|That's right. 512.||CC|Copy that.||||||Tape 96A/23|05 23 08 37|CDR-EVA|Hey, Bob, from where I am, about 100 meters around the west side of the rim of this crater, the mantle on the inside of the rim turns from this gray material we've been sampling - sampling in here -to a very dark gray material. And there's a lot of ... stuff that goes down - radially down into the - into the pit of the crater.||CC|Okay. Copy that. Outstanding.||LMP-EVA|Hey, Bob, those cores didn't feel like they - the follower went down at all.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Shouldn't it have gone a little bit?||CC|Not necessarily, if it's pretty compact stuff. You were having a hard time getting it in.||LMP-EVA|Well, I thought there was a little space up there, but maybe I just didn't feel it.||CC|Hot very much - -||LMP-EVA|I don't think there's much danger of them coming apart.||CC|Okay. Great.||CDR-EVA|I got to take a couple of more pictures at that contact slope over there. I know - you can't see it from where you are, Jack, but I guess we got to leave. Otherwise it would be nice to sample that dark stuff up on top.||CC|We need you guys rolling in 7 minutes.||CDR-EVA|We can get a spool - oh, I bet I'm out of film! Well, I got them all anyway, Bob. I'm at 162. I'm out of film. That stuff - and you're looking at me with the camera - that stuff is up toward that boulder, around that - about as far away from that boulder on the other side as we are on this side. And we want a hack at that boulder, too. Jack, let's see if we can't get that boulder, anyway.||||Tape 96A/2U||||CDR-EVA|But I don't have any film.||CC|Guys, we don't have that much time.||CDR-EVA|I know, Bob, I know. There's a lot of little pieces - not a lot - but enough that I've seen five or six of them. Little pieces of obsidianlike glass. I got one In my pocket. Unbagged. Undocumented. This boulder that you were looking at with the TV. I'm going to take a sample. Undo cumented.|05 23 11 00|LMP-EVA|I got it! I got it!||CDR-EVA|Oh, you got it?||LMP-EVA|Yes .||CC|Yes .||LMP-EVA|Let' s go.||CDR-EVA|I'm sorry, I didn't know you got that. Bag 46l has another sample of the - of basalt that I picked up right near where we dug the trench.||CC|Copy 561 [sic] .||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, I'm going to give you something with the - I'm going to give you something with the TV. I want to show you where that dar - dark material starts.||LMP-EVA|Hold still, now.||CDR-EVA|As you - okay. As you look at the inner rim -as it goes down (cough) to the right - you see a lot of boulders - a lot of rocks that are protruding out. Where that rock pattern thins out, just beyond that is an orange - a visible orange radial pattern, and then beyond that is a definite change in albedo where you get the gray material, and a definite change in the number of - of rocks on the slope.||CC|Gene, Roger.||||||Tape 96A/25|05 23 12 09|CDR-EVA|And that particular - -||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|- - material can - -||CC|And if - -||CDR-EVA|- - and that particular material - that par - Let me finish, Bob! That particular rim material there continues around to the due north, and then there's a drastic change again where you see the -the inner rim completely terraced with this boulder fill.||CC|Okay, copy that, Gene - -||CDR-EVA|And I can't bet on it, but I can see it - -||CC|- - and you can talk about it when you get home.||CDR-EVA|Okay. As long as you're happy, I am.||LMP-EVA|Wait, Gene. Wait, wait, wait.||CDR-EVA|I got to get the film changed, Jack - -||CC|All right, Gene, change the film at the next - -||CDR-EVA|--...||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CC|- - station. We can save time that way.||CDR-EVA|All right.||CC|And we would like the SEP turned on before you leave - ?||CDR-EVA|We did that.||CC|- - and we'd like EP number 1 taken, Jack, so you can deploy that at Victory.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Okay. I'll get - I'll get your scoop for you. Have you been leaving it cocked like that?||||Tape 96A/26||||CDR-EVA|Yes, Of course, we haven't been taking any SEP measurements, and I don't know what difference it makes.||LMP-EVA|Okay, everything is locked on, I guess - How are you reading, Bob?||CC|We've been reading you loud and - -||CDR-EVA|It's 70, 012, 501; 670, 012, 501.||CC|Okay, we copy that, Geno, and -||CDR-EVA|Okay, got the -||CC|Charge number 1 and - -||LMP-EVA|We got the gnomon, we got the rake - -||CC|- - we need the SEP on - -||CDR-EVA|SEP on, Jack? I'll get charge number 1 for you.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I'll get the SEP on.||CDR-EVA|I'll just hand it to you.||CC|And what's your frame count, Gene - Jack?||SC|Charge number 1.|05 23 l4 07|LMP-EVA|Okay, power-power's on, recorder's on, the temperature is 112.||CC|I copy that.||LMP-EVA|Can you get it, Geno?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|You get in - I'll hand it to you.||LMP-EVA|Okay,||CDR-EVA|And then I'll offer to get the TV.||CC|And, Jack, what's your frame count, please?||||||Tape 96A/27||LMP-EVA|Wait, Bob, 1 can give you that on the Rover.||CC|Okay. I thought you were on there.|05 23 14 47|CDR-EVA|Okay, camera MODE switch is 1 - MODE switch is 1; camera's going AFT - camera's going AFT. Well, I guess that's the breaks of life. Low gain on SEP when I get on, I'll give you - this when you're ready. First thing I got to do, Bob, is change film at the next station.||CC|That's affirm.||LMP-EVA|And, Bob, LMP is at 75-||CC|Say again, there, Jack, I - I missed that.||LMP-EVA|75.||CC|Copy that. Thank you.||CDR-EVA|I must be getting fatter, you know it.||LMP-EVA|Fatter?||CDR-EVA|Well -||LMP-EVA|Depends on how you get in. Where's your hammer?||CDR-EVA|Okay, we got a flag on the Rover.||LMP-EVA|Your hammer's caught again.||CDR-EVA|That's all right. We got a flag on the Rover, and I'm reading 136 on battery number 2.||CC|Say again on that one, Gene.|05 23 I6 03|CDR-EVA|I'm reading 136 - make that 132 on battery number 2, and we did get a flag.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Jack, I'm going to make a very sharp right turn here because I do not want to go down that hill. Okay. We're moving, Houston.||||Tape 96A/28|||05 23 16 25|CC|Roger. You're moving exactly 37 seconds early.||CDR-EVA|Early? I could have got - gotten that dark mantle on the side of that crater. That's all it would have taken me.||LMP-EVA|So you saw a radial orange, huh?||CDR-EVA|Yes, it was radial, Jack. You could see it very -It'll be in the pictures. Oh, man, I can't drive into that heading. Let me get my - -||LMP-EVA|That was on the inside of the crater?||CDR-EVA|On the inside rim of the crater.||LMP-EVA|Yes, that's vhere the surface ... keeps slumping off so it's exposed, probably.||CC|Quite a station, men. We thought - -||CDR-EVA|I'm going to get my ... Okay. I'm MIN.||CC|- - station 2 was a good station.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I'm MIN. Man, I'll tell you, that - that heading is going to put us right - Okay, Bob, give me a - Dang - wait a minute.||CC|The heading you should be generally taking - -||CDR-EVA|Where we at?||CC|- - toward Victory is 090, Gene.||CDR-EVA|Okay, can you give me a bearing and range at Victory?||CC|Okay. Stand by.||LMP-EVA|Did you get the TGE read?||CDR-EVA|Yes, I did - I get it read. They got everything, that station - but not everything I'd like to give them.||CC|Okay, it's going to be - -||||||Tape 96A/29||CDR-EVA|Houston - -||CC|-- 105 and 3.1.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Man, I tell you that LCRU is terrible, when it lashes into you.||LMP-EVA|Well, you can always zigzag.||CDR-EVA|Yes, that's what I've got to do. I've got to tack into that Sim.||LMP-EVA|I got it.||CDR-EVA|Okay. We got to go to Victory.||LMP-EVA|Houston, I don't know what exa - I didn't have time to really think at that station but that could - I think based on having found the alte -If I hadn't seen that alteration, and all I'd seen is the - is the fractured block on the rim, I might have - which looked like the stuff in the bottom - I might have said it was just another impact. But having all the color changes and everything, I think we might have to consider that it could be a volcanic vent.||CC|Roger. It surely was different, anyway.||LMP-EVA|I'm not sure how we - I'm not sure how we prove it. We didn't have time to prove it.||CC|We noticed. I guess that's the breaks of the game, sometime.|05 25 19 03|CDR-EVA|Hey, Bob, I forgot your numbers at - I forgot your numbers at Victory. How about giving them to me, again?||CC|Okay. 105, 3.1. And it'll be a heading of 090 - -||CDR-EVA|Okay. Thank you.||CC|- - that's the general heading in that direction.||CDR-EVA|Okay. 105, 3.1.||||Tape 96A/30||||CC|I guess we always have Station 9 to look forward to, guys. That may be the same thing - We'll probably be out of time when we get to that one, too.||CDR-EVA|Nobody likes a pessimist.|05 23 20 11|CDR-EVA|Hey, Bob - I note on those radiators - I have been dusting the covers at every stop, whether that's any help or not.||CC|Okay; we copy that.||CDR-EVA|Okay, sports fans. We're still about on the -well, I think we moved - yes, we moved - we moved out into the Tortilla Flat area, I guess. Not very flat.||CC|That's affirmative.||CDR-EVA|Those kind I can go through - I can see them coming. 102, 3.8. And where's Victory?||CC|Dead ahead.||CDR-EVA|Boy, Victory is going to be subtle, I'll tell you. Bob, how long we been out?||CC|Stand by. 5 plus 26, 5 plus 26.||LMP-EVA|Hey - hey, Bob, I recommend that if we ever do this again they let me get off and pick the charge off when we want to deploy it. It really adds to the fatigue of the hands.||CC|I tell you - -||CDR-EVA|Couldn't you just hook it onto your fingers?||CC|We - we copy that, Jack. And Charlie's got a big smile on his face here.||LMP-EVA|Mark my words. There's Victory over there, I bet. See that's the long edge.||CDR-EVA|Yes, yes. I can't see over there, but - -||||||Tape 96A/31||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|- - got too much Sun in my eyes.||LMP-EVA|That's the right way to go. That'll be about it, too.||CDR-EVA|Man, I haven't seen - I don't think I've really seen the LM, except ... - -||LMP-EVA|... big rock in front of you.||CDR-EVA|I got it.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Well, you can't tell much about the countryside going into the Sun, can you?||CDR-EVA|Put your upper visor down. That's what - that'll give you a whole different perspective.||LMP-EVA|It doesn't vise very well. It's stuck.||CDR-EVA|That's got to be Victory over there, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Yes .|05 23 23 03|CDR-EVA|We're at 103, 3.4.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|That is Victory.||LMP-EVA|We're still seeing the pit-bottom glass - the glass-lined, pit-bottomed craters. How's that?||CC|Otherwise known as - -||CDR-EVA|That's geology-ese if I ever heard it.||CC|-- the GLPBC.||LMP-EVA|Took you a while, didn't it?||CC|It's 11 o'clock down here, guys.||CDR-EVA|It's 11 o'clock up here, too, Bob. There's a square boulder - look at that one!||||Tape 96A/32||||LMP-EVA|Yes, it's square all right - or at least one side of it is.||CDR-EVA|No, three sides of it are square. It just fractured that way - that's by accident, looking at it. So how do we get over here?||LMP-EVA|Go left, probably. And along the rim.||CDR-EVA|Yes, that's where I'm going to go. Hold on.||LMP-EVA|I'm holding. Whew! If Charlie is smiling because my hands are tired, why did he let you give me - get the charge off? Fine backup crew we got.||CC|You guys didn't really mean to say that, did you?||CDR-EVA|106, 3.2. We're approaching the rim of Victory.||LMP-EVA|And the LMP frame count is somewhere around 7 -well, 8.5, maybe.||CDR-EVA|That's Victory; look at it go to the left and look at it go to the right. That's Victory; we're right on the ridge.||LMP-EVA|Yes. Yes.||CC|Okay; and we're picking - -||CDR-EVA|We' re at 106 , 3. - -||CC|- - on a Rover ..., you guys - Copy that.||CDR-EVA|1 - 106, 3.2.||LMP-EVA|Okay, let's see.||CDR-EVA|Tell me where you want that thing and we'll get a pan around it.||LMP-EVA|Okay, let's - I tell you what - you see right ahead of you -||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|There's - it's - looks like a place you could spin [?] a profile on.||||||Tape 9&A/33||CDR-EVA|Yes, I could do it - right up in here.||LMP-EVA|And deploy the charge. Tell me where you're going.||CDR-EVA|I'm going, right here; you could put it in that hole. No, you don't want to do that.||LMP-EVA|That1s all right.||CDR-EVA|Just pick a spot and take your photos.||LMP-EVA|Okay, I've got them. Now, go just beyond there. Little bit more. That's good.|05 23 25 54|CDR-EVA|Okay. Okay, Bob, we're at 106, 3.2.||CC|Copy that.|05 23 26 04|LMP-EVA|Okay, pull - pin 1 is pulled and safe. Pin 2 is pulled and safe, and - Boy, these are stiff this time around. Push it in - try again.||CDR-EVA|That's a - that's a big black box. Don't pull it too hard.||LMP-EVA|Stand by on pin 3, gang.||CC|Copying that. Remember to push it all the way back in, Jack, and start from scratch.||LMP-EVA|I did - I did - I did. I remembered - I remembered.||CC|Good, good, good.||LMP-EVA|But now I can't get to the -||CDR-EVA|Your hands are tired. Let me try it once.||LMP-EVA|No, it's - it's not that. It's just - it's coming. Got it.|05 23 27 00|LMP-EVA|Pin 3 is out and safe.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|And look at the orange flag. Zowie!||CC|That's what you guys were sampling at station 4, I bet,||||Tape 96A/34||||CDR-EVA|Huh? Yes - it's about that orange, only a little -not quite as bright. Same - same shade. Okay. Okay, let me turn my switch on. Hey, Bob - -||LMP-EVA|Wait a minute, wait a minute. Let me get that out a little more.||CDR-EVA|Bob, there's no question but what that we're at Victory.||CC|Say again there, 17-||CDR-EVA|It's the first crater that looked like I thought it would.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay. You ready?||LMP-EVA|Let me change my setting here.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Okay.||LMP-EVA|Good.||CDR-EVA|Okay, let's get a nice Rover pan here.||LMP-EVA|Okay, turn the other way first.||CDR-EVA|Yes .||LMP-EVA|. . . slow.||CC|And we'll get a Rover sample here before you guys leave, too, after the circular pan.||LMP-EVA|We will.||CDR-EVA|Low enough?||LMP-EVA|Yes .||LMP-EVA|Look at the light mantle over there.||CDR-EVA|You can sure see it now, can't you now?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||||||Tape 96A/35||CDR-EVA|Getting your - your setting changed fast enough?||LMP-EVA|I got it; yes.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Okay, let's get our Rover sample.||LMP-EVA|Okay.|05 23 29 01|CDR-EVA|And the Rover sample will be from the same locality. Boy, it's just a couple of meters from the charge, isn't it?||LMP-EVA|Yes. I hope I didn't put too much soil in there for you. Wait a minute.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Rover sample works just as advertised.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Not bad. That - bag 43 Yankee.||CC|Copy; 43 Yankee. And how about a frame count after - right now, Gene - Jack.||LMP-EVA|I will. Stand by. You're jumping the gun occasionally but not very often. 106.||CC|Copy--||CDR-EVA|..., Jack. Okay?||CC|--106.|05 23 29 57|LMP-EVA|Okay. I guess we're ready to leave here, huh?||CDR-EVA|Well, if they don't want us to stop here, I guess we leave.||CC|Roger. We're ready for you guys to leave there - -||LMP-EVA|So, there's nothing else here now.||CC|- - and we're pressing on tovard station 5»||CDR-EVA|Okay -||||Tape 96A/36||||LMP-EVA|Gene?||CDR-EVA|Okay, and I want to go about 120.||LMP-EVA|Gene.||CDR-EVA|Yes?||LMP-EVA|Gene, when you - can you swing out there and give me one look down east - or north into Victory?||CDR-EVA|Yes, I can do that, we can - I've got to go by that way anyway.||LMP-EVA|North. Well, you know, just swing it - point north so I can look in there.||CDR-EVA|Yes .||LMP-EVA|I never got a good look at it. Well, it's a - it's a series of three craters. There's some boulders on the - on the Talus slope of the easternmost -eastern slope of the west - eastern slope of the southernmost crater, the one we're closest to.||CDR-EVA|Now how does that look to you?||LMP-EVA|Well, it looks like - and see, there's the other -I don't know what it looks like. The northwest end of the V has a white block - white blocks on it -boulders - on the inner wall and right at the rim. And the northeast end of the V looks like it has somewhat darker rocks.||CDR-EVA|Yes .||LMP-EVA|Part of that is shadowed, but I think they are darker. And they look like about the same as down here near the tip of the V on this - -||CDR-EVA|Got to be careful on that one, because there's one sloping away and one sloping towards us.||LMP-EVA|Yes, I know. I've qualified it.|05 23 31 28|CDR-EVA|Okay; we are rolling, by the way. And we're at 106 and - Well, we're still 3-1-||||||Tape 96A/37||CC|Yes. Copy that. Thank you.||LMP-EVA|In the rim itaelf though, Victory is - is not blocky. There a little - there is an - some increase in fragment size, but that seems to be the result of some craters in the rim that have gotten below the debris that's covering it. I'd say that Victory's somewhat like Horatio in that it has blocky inner walls but essentially a normal block population on the rim.||CC|Okay. And we've got a Rover sample going toward station 5 at about 103 and 2.5*||LMP-EVA|Okay. 103 and 2.5*||CC|Roger. And that'll be just a grid sample.||LMP-EVA|They're - none of them just grid samples, Bob (laughter).||CDR-EVA|You see, you can't tell how deep they are until you get up to them.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|That one I could have gone through.||LMP-EVA|Yes. Okay; Station 5 is Camelot. Good old Camelot. (Humming)||CDR-EVA|Look at the size of that one. That's another one of those -||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|... - there's another one on the right. Lookit.||LMP-EVA|Some of them have -||CDR-EVA|Well, that one doesn't have any fragments in the bottom of it.||LMP-EVA|No.||CDR-EVA|Looks like someone walked across it.||||Tape 96A/38||||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|I think that there's quite a variability in the thickness of the dark mantle in here. Did you -I for - I didn't notice us crossing the - that one tongue of light mantle.||CDR-EVA|No, I didn't either.||LMP-EVA|I - we obviously did - -||CDR-EVA|I think we did.||LMP-EVA|Right at Victory, but it didn't show up.||CDR-EVA|Looking into the Sun, you can't tell any difference anyway. However, I tell you, I certainly get the impression there is a mantle. I would say that -||LMP-EVA|Oh, I think so. I don't know what it is, but the dark mantle exists. They're just - the craters -these craters are just too big not to have thrown up blocks. And they're either subdued by the mantle or they haven't penetrated it.||CDR-EVA|And a lot of - and these blocks - -||LMP-EVA|And I think you probably have both. Excuse me, Gene.||CDR-EVA|And I - I'd say they've been subdued by the mantle. That - that really imposes an impression on me.||LMP-EVA|Yes. There are those that appear that way, like Horatio, for example, or the big ones. But others, I think, are too young. They just don't penetrate. Particularly those that are big and have bright halos.||CDR-EVA|Well, now - yes, but the only ones that look fresh and not enough to penetrate are these little cnes with the glass in then.||LMP-EVA|Well, there's been some big - big fresh ones. We'll - we'll look for one.||CDR-EVA|Now there's one with glass in it, probably.||||||Tape 96k/39||LMP-EVA|Yes. I think that one - that's one - -||CDR-EVA|And without any blocks on it. That - that may not have penetrated.||LMP-EVA|Yes. Yes, that just has the - mostly the shock-indurated rock - ... rock.|05 23 35 13|CDR-EVA|We're coining up to 103 at 2.6 now, so we need a sample up here.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay. 103, 2.5, anywhere.||CC|Roger. That's affirm.||CDR-EVA|Okay, let me - good. Let me slowly go to the right here.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Right out in that little inner-crater area, right out in there is good. If you let me guide you a little, I might get a rock sample. Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's it.||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|That wasn't quite enough.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Pick a point.||LMP-EVA|Move - move ahead about - yes, right. Just - no, that's good. Straight ahead. Straight ahead. Good, good, good, good, good, good, whoa! Now we'll give it a try.|05 23 35 55|CDR-EVA|Okay, 103, 2.5.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|And that battery is still at about 132.||CC|Okay. Copy that. We're allowed to go to l40, tonight.||CDR-EVA|I don't expect we'll make it. I think we'll get dene before that. Save that for tomorrow. I'll||||Tape 96A/U0|||||tell you those batteries deserve any temperature they want today, after going - going up that - -||LMP-EVA|That's - that's the soil.||CDR-EVA|- - that Scarp.|05 23 36 27|LMP-EVA|Okay. The soil is in 44 Yankee.||CC|Copy; 44 Yankee.||LMP-EVA|That block's too big. I can't get it. Too big. Okay.||CDR-EVA|Get your picture?||LMP-EVA|No. Okay, got mine.||CDR-EVA|Okay. What's the - well, we'll find Camelot.|05 23 37 04|LMP-EVA|And the - 125's the LMP frame.||CC|Copy that. And just press on the same heading you've been carrying there, Gene, and that will get you to Camelot.||CDR-EVA|We want the southwestern edge, huh?||LMP-EVA|Do you want to go where Station 5 is, Bob?||CC|That's my understanding, Jack. So press on towards there unless I tell you otherwise.||LMP-EVA|Well, but you were talking about changing Station 5 I think Station 5 is a pretty good spot.||CC|Roger. And I think that's where we want to go -I'm just trying to verify that. You can go in that direction, though. I'll get with you if it's not.||LMP-EVA|Okay. It's probably the most concentrated boulder field on Camelot.||CC|Okay. You know where it is, and we think it's about 092 and 1.6.||CDR-EVA|092 and 1.6. You know this country - -||||||Tape 96A/41||CC|Roger. But you know where it is, so you'll find it when you get there.||CDR-EVA|- - is rug - is undu - It's different.||LMP-EVA|Wonder where Horatio is?||CDR-EVA|Well, we're going to run into something in a minute if it's - it's probably right over that rim on the right, Jack. Right off your right hand at 2 o'clock.||LMP-EVA|Right. I guess so.||CDR-EVA|You know, it doesn't have boulders on it. It should be over there. That should be it right over that rim. You know, I see why A1 and Ed had trouble walking up Cone Crater. You - you could stand right on the edge of the rim of a crater and not know it was there.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Man, that was spectacular. It's color on the Moon!||LMP-EVA|Whooo!||CDR-EVA|It was really orange! Can you see that color on the television?||LMP-EVA|No answer.||CDR-EVA|I'll bet they couldn't.||CC|No, we couldn't see it, Gene. ... guys - -||CDR-EVA|Look at the - look at the Sculptured Hills. Okay. I'm sure glad I went up to take that second pan to see that stuff go radially down into the center of the crater at that contact.||LMP-EVA|Yes, that's good.||CDR-EVA|Hope it comes out.||LMP-EVA|Doesn't make any difference, it's there - comes out or not. Okay. Sculptured - -||||Tape 96A/42||||CDR-EVA|Okay. Look at - look at up - up the cleft over there. You can see definite change in albedo now between the North Massif and the Sculptured Hills. Lookit, right at - right up the - the valley. Well, you can't see it - let me -||LMP-EVA|(Laughing) You're right.||CDR-EVA|You got - you got to see this. See that?||LMP-EVA|Yes. There - but, again, that may be your photometrous effects.||CDR-EVA|Yes, one's an upslope and one's a downslope.||LMP-EVA|Yes. Yes. Just about right, but it's supposed to be darker in the - in the cleft you know.||LMP-EVA|Well, I guess ... I've been on - LMP's back to MINIMUM.||CC|Roger. Thank you.|05 23 40 18|CDR-EVA|Oh, whoop, whoop, whoop! I wish I had a movie picture of us driving.||LMP-EVA|You're doing it - you're doing the driving.||CDR-EVA|Who's going to - -||LMP-EVA|Who you plan on taking it?||CDR-EVA|- - ... century. You're doing - Well, there must be somebody out there.|05 23 40 40|LMP-EVA|Bob, the fragment population - We're at 099, 2.0 -is still about the 1-percent category of - And it's hard to tell-, going into the Sun, what kind of blocks you're dealing with. But - my - my guess is most - well, more than a guess - most of them look like they're slightly vesicular. And, in that regard, resemble the gabbros.||CC|Okay, copy that.||||||Tape 96A/43||LMP-EVA|Many - there are - now there is something - there's a class of boulders that is flat topped and fairly well rounded that is just about completely buried. Only the - the - oh, not more than 5 centimeters of it projects above the surface. We've seen those off and on, both days. Remember, Geno?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|And they seem to be quite distinct. At least you notice them. Now, whether it's just a continuation of the mantling, I don't know. But - the - most other boulders - the big ones seem to be - project above the surface more than just that 5 or 10 centimeters.||CDR-EVA|I tell you, the Sculptured Hills just have that wrinkled old-face feeling.||LMP-EVA|Yes. There are blocks over there though , aren11 there?||CDR-EVA|There's blocks, but I don't see any concentrated outcrops - -||LMP-EVA|No.||CDR-EVA|- - or concentrated masses of blocks up on the slope anywhere - -||LMP-EVA|Possibly - -||CDR-EVA|- - like you did on the Massif.||LMP-EVA|Possibly due - -||CDR-EVA|Oh. Do you think that's Camelot or not?||LMP-EVA|I think that might be Camelot.||CDR-EVA|Look at that.||LMP-EVA|Nice shot.||CDR-EVA|Look at that. Right on the southeastern - -||LMP-EVA|Now, wait a minute.||||Tape 96A/44||||CDR-EVA|- - southwestern rim.||LMP-EVA|Yes, yes.||CDR-EVA|Yes, because Horatio's got to be on our right. Well, wait a minute, doggone it.||LMP-EVA|It's not Horatio, is it?|05 23 42 43|CDR-EVA|Well, we're at 094, 1.7*||CC|Stand by.||LMP-EVA|No, I think, that's Camelot. Horatio didn't - -||CDR-EVA|That's too - that's too - -||LMP-EVA|- - have blocks that far up the rim.||CDR-EVA|- - let me - yes, let me look - look at the bottom I'll tell you. I remember.||LMP-EVA|Yes. That kind of stuff's like Camelot dust. These blocks -||CDR-EVA|Yes, I remember. Yes, that's it,.Bob. We're coming right up at station 5- Right at it.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Only way to fly. Okay. You want to park up on the rim so they can have a good panorama?||CDR-EVA|Sure. I'd like to get a little on the other side of those blocks, if I can.||LMP-EVA|Yes, you better. Then they can look with the Sun on them.||CDR-EVA|Yes .||LMP-EVA|Because, otherwise, they can't see that other rim over there.||||||Tape 96A/45||CDR-EVA|Same heading. So, I'll be all right, there. Yes. I'll get to the other side. Then they can look at these blocks and those across the way. I got to go around this block field, though.||LMP-EVA|I should hope so. ... seeing Druid.||CDR-EVA|Then you really - There's Horatio back there. I can see Horatio now. Okay?||LMP-EVA|Looks just like It did before.||CDR-EVA|So, we came right where we were supposed to.||LMP-EVA|All the blocks look very much the same in the wall of Horatio.||CDR-EVA|There's a path through -||LMP-EVA|Watch it. Watch it.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Well, that's a test.||LMP-EVA|That was a good one.||CDR-EVA|That was a good test. Didn't let any air out of that tire, did it?||LMP-EVA|No, I don't think so.||CDR-EVA|Talk about a block field!||LMP-EVA|I think my guess of 30 percent was reasonably good before. I - Where are you going to park. Right over there?||CDR-EVA|I'll park right over here, so that they can look in it.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Yes. I got to head 045, so I head right into those blocks.||LMP-EVA|Oh, you still got to turn, remember?||CDR-EVA|Yes, that's why I want to leave myself a little room over there.||||Tape 96A/46||||LMP-EVA|Oh.|05 23 45 15|CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. We're stopped. 086 and 1.4.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Not very level for the gravimeter. What's their limit?||CDR-EVA|I don't know, but it's taken a couple better than this.||LMP-EVA|Hey, I got to change film.||CDR-EVA|Let me get things going here.||LMP-EVA|I think I can get by this station without it.||CDR-EVA|How's our time, Bob?||CC|Stand by. We're talking about that now. You've got - Stand by. You've got 25 minutes at this station, guys. We've given you somewhat of an extension here. You're using up some of it back at the LM, but we've given you - I've given you somewhat of an extension. You've got 25 minutes at this station. The primary priority will be subfloor documented samples, and then subfloor rake soil. As you can imagine.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CC|As you get off, we'd also like to open the SEP and again get back to COOL.||CDR-EVA|Okay. You wanted to turn it OFF.||CC|That's affirm - -||CDR-EVA|Turn it off.||CC|- - Turn it OFF, open, dust - -||CDR-EVA|You want it off?||CC|- - the same thing we've been doing to it all aft -all evening.||||||Tape 96A/47||LMP-EVA|Well, it's midday here, Bob.||CDR-EVA|Leave it open and I'll dust it, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Oh, the temperature - they'd like to know.|05 23 47 01|CDR-EVA|Temperature is still about 112.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|You know, the thing I - you know the thing I dread most? About closeout?||LMP-EVA|What's that?||CDR-EVA|Is dusting you.||LMP-EVA|Yes, I'm not going to be able to do much today, I don't think.||CDR-EVA|Well, you know, we don't have nearly as much dust on - because yesterday we were wallowing around in It. Today, we're -||LMP-EVA|Who? Me!||CC|Okay, and, Gene, if you're not off the Rover, how about the rest of the Rover readouts?||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, I'm off, but I'll get them for you. I'm sorry. I look at them, and they all look good to me. And it - you know. I keep forgetting to give them to you.||LMP-EVA|Bob, I have 135 frames. I think I can finish the station, don't you?||CC|Yes, probably.|05 23 48 08|CDR-EVA|You know that SEP isn't get much - well, it's getting a little on it, but those mirrors don't clean off as nice as the - as the LCRU mirrors.||||Tape 96A/48||||LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob. This looks just like our old friend, the pyroxene gabbro with the shiny ilmenite platelets in the vugs and partially recrystallized vesicles. The textural variations are planar, and they're primarily - subplanar in the concentrations of vesicles.||CDR-EVA|Jack, I'm going to put this brush under my - my seat. It's just getting too hard to get off that place up there.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Bob, what magazine?||CC|Magazine Delta.||LMP-EVA|Wa - watch yourself through here, Geno.||CDR-EVA|Yes. Delta, huh?||CC|That's affirm.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Delta - Bravo. There's Delta. Boy, this is certainly a uni - subfloor, as we mapped it. It's certainly a uniform - uniform rock type. I'll tell you. The only variation - are those gray zones which are - just seem to be either finer or the absence of vesicles. Boy, I'm nose to nose with a piece of it right now.||CDR-EVA|Say, Bob, where can I get a new set of bags?||CC|Okay, you want - The new bags, they111 be under Jack's seat.||LMP-EVA|There's some under - Under my seat, there's some, Geno.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Just loose?||LMP-EVA|Yes.|05 23 50 37|LMP-EVA|Here I am, folks, in the middle of a boulder field. Just minding my own business. There - I don't know whether I mentioned it. The texture - mineral texture - is - appears to be subophitic to - sort||||||Tape 96A/49|||of like - like a good diabase, although a little coarser. But it's unquestionably organized with that variation in vesicle concentration.||CDR-EVA|Starting on frame 4, Bob.||CC|Copy that, Gene.||CDR-EVA|Jack, I've got to get new bags. I've only got one left, and you don't have any, I don't believe.||LMP-EVA|I don't have any.||LMP-EVA|Bob, there - I have the impression that these blocks are buried up here. That the mantle does exist, even on Camelot. There are a few blocks that are lying out on the - looks like they're lying more less on the surface, but you might -you can attribute those to - to craters that have disrupted the block field.||CC|Okay; good observation, Jack.||LMP-EVA|The big ones seem to be projecting out of the -the big ones seem to be projecting out of the mantle.||CC|Okay. Do you see any such mantle on - -||LMP-EVA|Although I can't see how the mantle in here could -||CC|-- on top of them.||LMP-EVA|It's not as - No, I don't. What's there seems to be what could have been knocked up there.||CC|Okay. Understand.||LMP-EVA|I see a place where - I see a place where I think we can skim some off the top of a rock, which I think we probably ought to do.||CC|Okay.||||Tape 96A/50||||LMP-EVA|But it - I don't have the impression of draping, so much as I have just of burial. And I have a feeling that the zap-pitting process just has cleaned these boulders off - of anything that may have been on top of them, in excess of what's around them, right now.||CC|Okay, you're talking about - -||LMP-EVA|Also, like Horatio, the - Go ahead.||CC|You're talking about mantle - blocks - then mantle -and then cleaned off by zap pits, in other words.|05 23 53 38|LMP-EVA|That's right. Most of the rocks seem - that seems to be what has happened all over the Moon that we've looked at. But the rocks are always cleaner than the - than the surface, of course. The - the far rim of Camelot - you can see - fact is everywhere but where we are and on the rim near the LM -the - there seems - the rim seems to be completely covered or, at least, the blocks don't show through. They show up in the wall but not at the rim. That's much like Horatio, but not to the extreme that we saw at Horatio. I'd say, at Camelot, the mantle is - oh, maybe - at the most - the rim thickness, if that's mantle, is on the order of a half of what we saw at Horatio.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|The pan should let you measure that - Well, we didn't get a pan at Horatio, but we got some Rover shots of it. But you may be able to come -quantify that a little bit.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|How coming, Geno?||CDR-EVA|Oh, I've got new bags. I've got new mags. I've got everything cleaned up and -|05 23 55 00|CDR-EVA|MARK, gravimeter.||CC|Copy. Mark that.||||||Tape 96A/51||LMP-EVA|Here's a - here's a nicely structured rock that we probably ought to work on here. Structured again in the vesicle concentration. And then I think we ought to try to get - right over there, we can get mantle.||CDR-EVA|Hey, I'll tell you what impresses me about some of these rocks. There's a lot of - they may be zap pits - I guess you looked at them closer than I did, but there sure is a lot of - lot of lineation in some of that white - white material, Jack.||LMP-EVA|But at what scale?||CDR-EVA|Well, on a - on a - on a - on a visual-obvious scale.||LMP-EVA|Well, I mean the - Okay.||CDR-EVA|I'll show you. If you don't - Let me see if it's up here.||LMP-EVA|The crystal grains are - seem to be linear, but they are more or less random. Is that what you mean?||CDR-EVA|No, they're linear, though. I can't - -||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|- - can't be really linear and random. There's some rocks here that are - -||LMP-EVA|No, I mean - -||CDR-EVA|- - that are highly vesicular and there's others that are not.||LMP-EVA|That's right.||CC|Okay, and a reminder, 17 - -||LMP-EVA|Gene, if this is what you mean, it's - -||CC|- - you guys, that the primary priority is the blocks and then a rake soil of the - of the white subfloor soil there. And you've only got 15 minutes before we want you driving back to the LM. Over.||||Tape 96A/52||||LMP-EVA|Okay. We'll get to work.||CDR-EVA|Okay - -||LMP-EVA|Let's sample this.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Let me get these two first and then we'll go get that one, because there's two different kinds here - at least apparent kinds. One's a relatively new fracture.||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Boy, I tell you, watch when you back up. ... you already - -||CDR-EVA|... told you.||LMP-EVA|- - learned that.||CDR-EVA|I've already cycled film.||LMP-EVA|We need to sample the structures, though, in this thing. We haven't really done that.||CDR-EVA|We'll try and get a around-the-corner - -||LMP-EVA|And we've got to get - -||CDR-EVA|- - picture.||LMP-EVA|We need to get that stuff on the mantle, too. I mean on the blocks.||CDR-EVA|Yes. Okay, we want to get an around-the-corner picture of one of those big ones, too. See if we can get the structure of it. Okay, you get your picture?||LMP-EVA|Yes.|05 23 57 19|CDR-EVA|Here's a piece right here.||LMP-EVA|Okay, can you hand me a bag, or I'll pick it up with a scoop, whichever you prefer.||||||Tape 96A/53||CDR-EVA|Get the bag? Let's see if we can fix your bag thing tonight.||LMP-EVA|Okay, I got it. Okay, that looks like our - our old friend, the gabbro, all right.||CDR-EVA|That for a piece.||LMP-EVA|462 is Gene's fairly freshly fractured rock. Okay, you can put it in the bag.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay, here's another one right here. That one.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|I can't squeeze these things anymore. Here you go. Got a bag?||LMP-EVA|Not yet.||CDR-EVA|Okay. You in there?|05 23 58 53|LMP-EVA|Okay, 463. Is another of the same variety. Wish we'd started on that structured rock because we're going to run out of time. Let's go over there and get at least one off of it.||CDR-EVA|Yes, we'll get it.||LMP-EVA|Get the after. Whoops - Got it?||CDR-EVA|Got it.||LMP-EVA|Okay, why don't we -||CDR-EVA|What did you have picked out?||LMP-EVA|This - this - this in here with the layering in it.||CC|Okay, guys --||LMP-EVA|I'll get a --||CC|- - looks like you'll be going in about 10 minutes.||LMP-EVA|- - a flight line photo. Yes.||||Tape 96A/54||||LMP-EVA|Why don't you get a flight line -||CDR-EVA|I'm going to get that from here.||LMP-EVA|Sort of northeast. How you going to go?||CDR-EVA|I'll come around from this end and go around to that side.||LMP-EVA|Okay, I'll go perpendicular to you more or less.||LMP-EVA|Boy, that one right behind you is just vesicular, by comparison, to a high degree - like three times as much.||CDR-EVA|Oh, I hope those bags weren't in the way of every one of those pictures. Okay. Boy, I tell you there ought to be a lot of permanent shaded samples in here, Jack.|06 00 01 17|LMP-EVA|Okay, I got the down-Sun. Man! That's a hard Moon.||CDR-EVA|Just a little piece but that's - see -||LMP-EVA|How about this chunk down there, Gene?||CDR-EVA|Where you looking?||LMP-EVA|That'd -||CDR-EVA|I don't think that'll - that plate - piece?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|I don't think that'll come off very easy.||LMP-EVA|Let's see here.||CDR-EVA|I'll try - here try it - you're over there. You know I've worn the RTV off that hammer already.||LMP-EVA|Yes , I saw that.||CC|Roger, 17. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|There you go*, beautiful call. Beautiful call. Beautiful call.||||||Tape 96A/55||LMP-EVA|That's why - -||CDR-EVA|I wore the RTV - -||LMP-EVA|That comes from 15 years as a trained - trained hammer bearer.|06 00 02 18|CDR-EVA|By golly, your geology training did come in handy You learned where to hit rocks.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tapes 96B-100B/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|06 01 00 XX||BEGIN LUNAR REV 31|06 02 59 XX||BEGIN LUNAR REV 32|06 04 57 XX||BEGIN LUNAR REV 33|06 06 56 XX||BEGIN LUNAR REV 34|||REST PERIOD - NO COMMUNICATIONS||||||Tape 97A/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|06 00 02 36|CDR-EVA|Bob, 3 - well, 464. Won't all go in there but - -||LMP-EVA|That's all right, you can wrap it around it.||CDR-EVA|I get it - no, I get it, babe. It' s in there.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CC|Okay - -||CDR-EVA|Okay, let's - -||CC|- - Jack, and now - -||CDR-EVA|What do you - can we - -||CC|- - if you could get that rake soil and maybe also get the soil off the top of one of those boulders that you thought you saw.||LMP-EVA|Yes. Whew. I've got to have Gene with me since my - can't carry sample bag, you know.||CC|Roger.||LMP-EVA|I probably can if I'm careful; but I keep dropping them.||CDR-EVA|These rocks here have an awful lot - a much greater density of the white - white minerals in them, or crystals, than I've ever seen before, Jack. Where did we see these kind before?||LMP-EVA|Well, when I looked at them right at first, that's what I thought - but I think that the zap pits are making the white stand out more. They're fooling you a little bit.||CDR-EVA|They might.||||Tape 97A/2||||LMP-EVA|Because when I looked it with the hand lens, it looked like a fairly normal gabbro - like some of those that have crystallized with the mare basalt||CDR-EVA|Where are you? You ready to take them back - -||LMP-EVA|I'm back over here. What I want is a sample of this soil off one of these rocks.||CDR-EVA|Okay, let's get that now and then let's get the rake sample.||LMP-EVA|But it looks to me like it's soil that's been thrown up there rather than - This rock is about 3 meters in diameter and it - but it's one of the flat surfaced rocks. It only stands about - at the most - one-third of a meter high.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|But we can get up about a meter from the - the soil/rocks interface and get soil off the rock, I think.||CDR-EVA|Okay. See what you can do.||LMP-EVA|Whoops, oh, yes; I got some soil.||CDR-EVA|Don't kick up anything new.||LMP-EVA|No, that's all right.|06 00 04 56|CDR-EVA|455 is that bag number, Bob.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Okay, this is soil from a half a meter in. It's about a centimeter deep and a half a meter in.||CDR-EVA|Let's take that chip there that's lying on top with the next scoop.||LMP-EVA|No, I'm going to - -||CDR-EVA|Let's take the soil on that. No. I was taking -No. Okay, take that one then. Well, that's another bag. Put this - before you pick that one up, pick that little chip up -||||||Tape 97A/3||LMP-EVA|Well - I don't - I don't want to get the chips. I want the soil. Either that or a coherent rock.||CDR-EVA|Okay, there you go.||LMP-EVA|I think we better leave it at that.|06 00 05 43|CDR-EVA|Okay, 465* Pick that other one up and I'll bag it real quick.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|That's the soil from on top the rock. And we're taking a piece of the rock itself, which looks pretty much like the other one, Bob. It might be a little bit more vesicular.||CC|Okay, and that'll be in 466, right?|06 00 06 06|CDR-EVA|You're right again. Here we are and I'll be able to grab it with my hand. Put this away.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Okay, the soil came from a half a meter in from the soil boundary. We need to get a - let me get over here and try to get a - one bag of soil that's away from the boulder. I'm going to get my after while I'm here.||CC|Okay, 17 - -||LMP-EVA|Could you - could you - -||CC|Roger. And the present time, we drop the rake soil, we'd just like to get the kilogram of soil somewhere between the boulders - as open as you can.||CDR-EVA|My scoop in that?||LMP-EVA|It will be. ... Okay, it is now.||CDR-EVA|Oh, you want a kilogram?||CC|Roger.||||Tape 97A/4||||CDR-EVA|From between the boulders?||CC|Roger. That'll replace the rake soil sample we were going to get. And we1d like you moving in 3 minutes.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Let's do it right here.||CDR-EVA|Yes, right there. Let me -||LMP-EVA|Oh, okay.||CDR-EVA|This'll go - this will be a matched pair with our soil sample, too.||CC|Roger.|06 00 07 32|CDR-EVA|Okay, bag 467 is where your kilogram is coming from.||CC|Roger.||CDR-EVA|Another scoopful.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|That's - I'm sampling down to about 5 centimeters.||CC|Copy.||LMP-EVA|Get your hand down, please. I'm coming down to you.||CDR-EVA|Oh, okay.||LMP-EVA|Okay.|06 00 08 15|CDR-EVA|That's full. That's 467-||LMP-EVA|Pinch her down tighter or that will leak out.||CDR-EVA|Now let me get your big bag tight. Okay, let me try to get a - Jack, you got a shot of where my scoop was, didn't you?||||||Tape 97A/5||LMP-EVA|Yes. Let me get an after of it, though.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Houston, we sampled about 3 meters southwest of the gnomon that was set up for the top of boulder soil sample. So it's a match pair, really, in that regard.||CDR-EVA|Don't forget your gnomon.||LMP-EVA|I'm not.||LMP-EVA|Now I need to get a pan - are you in a pan?||CDR-EVA|I'm - I've already started it.||LMP-EVA|Okay, I'll go over near the Rover and get one.||LMP-EVA|Okay, I got the gnomon.||CDR-EVA|When do you want us to leave, Bob?||CDR-EVA|Jack, do you read me?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Hello, Houston.||CC|Hello, 17. Loud and clear. We'd like you to leave immediately, if not sooner.||CDR-EVA|Hippity-hoppity, hippity-hoppity, hippity-hopping over hill and dale. (Singing) Hippity-hopping along. Okay, my golly, this time goes fast.||CC|That's affirm. Okay, and when you leave here - -||CDR-EVA|Where did it go?||CC|- - 17, remember that we want to pick up - -||CDR-EVA|I'm giving you readings.||CC|- - EP number 8. Roger. We're ready.||LMP-EVA|Go.||||Tape 97A/6|||06 00 11 23|CDR-EVA|06 - 070, 031, and 401. 670, 031, and, 401.||CC|Copy that. And when we leave we want to take EP number 8 with us, guys. We * d like the SEP turned back ON and the blankets closed. Okay, Jack, I guess that's your option, you may - -||LMP-EVA|Let me ...||CC|-- stop and take the charge off when you get to the distance or, if it's only a short one, you might like carrying it in your lap.||CDR-EVA|Jack, I can hold it in my left arm on the seat.||LMP-EVA|No, I'll get it. I'll get it.||CDR-EVA|Okay, you want the SEP ON?||CC|That's affirm.||LMP-EVA|Okay, both DSEA and the other switch.||CDR-EVA|You want the blankets open?||CC|No, closed.||CDR-EVA|Closed. Well, closed is - What happened to the Velcro on that other side? I thought they mounted that thing, so that - -||LMP-EVA|It came off, Gene. It stuck to the Velcro.||CDR-EVA|That thing they ... it. Okay, you got the TG. We'll get EP-8. The camera's going.||LMP-EVA|We made a mistake earlier and it's too late to rectify it in carrying these charges.||CDR-EVA|Oh, I don't know - -||CC|Negative, Jack.||LMP-EVA|We did. I wouldn't want - -||CC|If you don't have it off, we could stop and get off and get it, if you want to? Bur this is a short distance. You might want to carry this one,||||||Tape 97A/7||LMP-EVA|That's right, that's right. I say the mistake was made earlier. There's no problem now.||CDR-EVA|Okay, traverse to LM, low gain 100.||LMP-EVA|Did you turn this on?||CDR-EVA|It's all on, all squared away.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Push that thing down and it'll stay. ... Well, sometimes it will. Okay.||CC|And how about a frame callout before you get back on, guys.||CDR-EVA|Got it.||LMP-EVA|Yes, I need some new - Do you want me to get it here?||CDR-EVA|CDR's at 50.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|170.||CC|Copy 170.||LMP-EVA|LMP's 170.||CC|And, Jack, it'd be my opinion, since you're just going back over the same path, that you came up this morning, it's probably not necessary.||LMP-EVA|Okay, I'll use it until it runs out.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|I am out of film anyway.||LMP-EVA|But when you leave me at - Okay.||CC|Yes, we'11 let - we'11 let Gene take some of the photos near the bomb, on near charge, ...||||Tape 97A/8||||CDR-EVA|Just jump up again and get your bomb. Yes, there you go. You got to ccme this way quite a bit.||LMP-EVA|Yes. Up this slope.||CDR-EVA|This seat is rising with you, for some reason. There it is, I guess. You're all right.||CDR-EVA|Up closer to you.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Let's go.|06 00 15 16|CDR-EVA|Okay, the switch is coming ON.||CDR-EVA|Okay, traverse to LM: 12 minutes, 085/1.4^ That's - Man, that says 086/1.4 to the LM, and my checklist 085/1.4. We must have landed where they wanted us to.||LMP-EVA|Just about.||CDR-EVA|Hey, Bob.||CC|Roger.||CDR-EVA|You know where we landed yet?||CC|Well, we think so. We've been transsecting ... positions tonight.||CDR-EVA|It must be - -||LMP-EVA|It must be pretty close.|06 00 15 59|CDR-EVA|You bet your life. I'm reading 085/1.4, and that's what my checklist said.||CC|Roger.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob, I guess my impression and it's purely pure interpretation right at this stage - that Camelot is mantled by whatever has formed the dark mantle.||||||Tape 97A/9||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|It does not seem to be mantled to the degree that Horatio is.||CC|Okay, copy that, too.||CC|And give us a mark when you're going.||CDR-EVA|Oh, I'm sorry, Bob - -||CC|And we don't have - -|o6 oo 16 58|CDR-EVA|And we've been going about - a minute.||CC|Okay, copy that. And we don't have battery temperatures there, if you could quickly give them to us.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I never did give you that. It's 110 and 136||CC|Copy that, good enough. Thank you.||CDR-EVA|Never did get that for you.||CC|That's okay.||LMP-EVA|But I tell you, the inner wall of Camelot is -the inner wall of Camelot to the east is certainly blocky.||CC|Well, there were a few blocks where you guys were, too.||CDR-EVA|... mantle, too, Jack. Yes, well, I don't know, you could see the outer wall, too. It's - Hey, here's some Rover tracks.||LMP-EVA|Hey, somebody's been here before.||CC|Okay, and, 17, what we're looking for is deploying charge number 082 and 0.4 on the range.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||||Tape 97A/10|||06 00 18 08|CDR-EVA|Okay, we're at 083 and 1.1. We're just about abeam the eastern rim of Camelot. And there's Challenger.||LMP-EVA|Hey, hello, Challenger. You can even see the ALSEP.||CDR-EVA|I think I'll go this way. (Laughter)||LMP-EVA|Gee, it seems like a short day. (Laughter)||CDR-EVA|Well, I'll tell you, the time went fast.||LMP-EVA|Okay, you've heard about this country. Hey, looking over there, though, there's no - we're about - oh, 50 meters from boulders at - in Camelot. And their appearance from this distance is the same as what we sampled from 5. I think we've pretty well identified the subfloor, Bob.||CC|Okay, sounds like we have and sounds like from the very deepest - even from the bottom of Camelot -it looks like it's about the same.||LMP-EVA|It sure does. I can't say I understand it. But that's the way it appears right now.||CC|You can't say what, Jack? Okay, understand that.||LMP-EVA|I can't say that I understand.||CC|Copy.||LMP-EVA|Whatever filled this valley - it certainly was different than the Massif. I think we've proved that. And it, presumably, at least everything I see indicates that it was an igneous extrusion of some kind. Either that, or we're - the whole valley's been tilted and we're looking at a - some strange cross section, planar more or less -relative to the other mountains, of a crystalline body that was formed at depth. But I don't think that's likely.||CC|Okay.||||||Tape 97A/11|06 00 20 29|CDR-EVA|Man,.we've covered 19-3 kilometers, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Is that what we planned to cover?||CC|That's outstanding.||CDR-EVA|I don't know. What did we plan to cover, Bob?||CC|Stand by. But we've been everywhere we've planned to go, so, we must have gone just about as far as we've planned to go.||LMP-EVA|Yes, but it1s a straight line. I don't know what the wander factor was, but I'm sure it was pretty high.||CC|17*6, they're telling me. So we went a little bit out of our way.||CDR-EVA|Well, it's all mileage.||LMP-EVA|0.7 and what was the bearing? 08 - 083?||CDR-EVA|082, I think, but we want 1.4.||CC|0.4 - 0.4, guys - you - -||CDR-EVA|Oh, 0.4.||LMP-EVA|Yes, that's the range.||CDR-EVA|Yes, that's what I said, 0.4.||LMP-EVA|But you want - you want to bear north, don't you, a - little?||CDR-EVA|Yes, I want - what'd you say, 082, didn't you, Bob?||CC|That's affirm. That'll be close enough. It's probably be right on your track, there.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Well, I don't make a habit of following myself. I like to cover new ground.||CC|Okay, copy that.||||Tape 97A/12||||LMP-EVA|Watch out for that new ground there looks like in the - look at the Italian flag.||CDR-EVA|Hey, there is one there. I saw the box before I saw the flag. No, I didn't, I saw the flag first, I've got to admit it.||LMP-EVA|Come on now.||CDR-EVA|I got to admit it, I saw the flag first.||LMP-EVA|The boss said you saw the flag first.||CDR-EVA|I'm 082 and I'm 0.5. I'll just head right in towards the LM. Man, I want to stay away from ALSEP, I see the big boulders, so I'll - -||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|I'm going to go around - -||LMP-EVA|0.5. Okay, you'll have to swing right after we deploy, probably.||CDR-EVA|Yes. Whoo.||CDR-EVA|Did we ever get any glass out of the bottom of those craters?||LMP-EVA|No, we haven't, we've got to try to do that before we leave. There haven't been any good - -||CC|Sometime you'll have time to do that, I guess, guys. I'm not sure when - -|06 00 22 40|LMP-EVA|Four.||LMP-EVA|Okay.|06 00 22 47|CDR-EVA|Okay, 08, well, she just went to 1. Okay, 081/0.4.||LMP-EVA|Okay, let's put it in that little depression there. See right ahead of us to the right.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||||||Tape 97A/13||LMP-EVA|Can you - -||CDR-EVA|Got your pictures?||LMP-EVA|I'm getting them.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Now just swing into that depression and I'll put it there. Beautiful. Okay. Oh, whoo.|06 00 23 12|LMP-EVA|Okay, charge number 8.||CDR-EVA|You didn't get a picture to the LM then, did you?||LMP-EVA|Yes, I did. I got several of them.||CDR-EVA|Well, we don't have to take any more, do we?||LMP-EVA|No.|06 00 23 21|LMP-EVA|Okay, antenna is deployed. Pin 1 is pulled and SAFE. And, let me check that. It's dusty. Yes, it's SAFE. Pin 2 is pulled and SAFE. Pin 3, pulled and SAFE.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|I guess as long as it didn't go off, it's safe.||CDR-EVA|Ooh, don't bang it. (Laughter) I don't care what they say, that's a charge.||CDR-EVA|You're having great luck with those.||LMP-EVA|You're right.||CDR-EVA|Okay, the LM was in the - approach shot, I believe, let me - -||LMP-EVA|Go ahead and turn around - -||CDR-EVA|Yes, I got to go around anyway.||LMP-EVA|This was I can get a running shot of ... - right in the middle of it - let me get you - get them both in it.||||Tape 97A/l4||||LMP-EVA|Okay, I ran out of film, too.||CDR-EVA|Oh, boy.||LMP-EVA|Now that's pretty veil located.||CDR-EVA|Where is it?||LMP-EVA|When you come around, take a picture of the LM on your camera.||CDR-EVA|I will. I'll take it right out the front looking right at the thing.||LMP-EVA|Yes, and give them a frame count. At about a 56 -||CDR-EVA|Fifty-six.||LMP-EVA|Bob, I've got the locator of the charge and the LM all in the same order here, and I'm one more than what I just gave you. I can't look at it now.||CC|Okay, one more than what you gave me at station 5, understand.|06 00 25 00|LMP-EVA|..., Bob. You want me to go to the gravimeter now.||CC|Roger. And if you guys will start out, we'll drive you by the ALSEP, Gene - Jack, and if you'll get out at the ALSEP, we'll have you take a look at the surface gravimeter and Gene can press on home to the LM.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Jack, I'm going to drive you in this way, and then I'll drive all the way back around that one geophone.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Shall I - -||CC|While you're to the north, you could drive in toward the heat flow, towards that big rock, if you can see that.||||||Tape 97A/15||CDR-EVA|Yes, well, okay; that's as good as anything.||CDR-EVA|Bob, you want me to get some ALSEP pictures?||CC|Negative.||CC|Okay, and Jack, you can stand by - -|06 00 25 49|LMP-EVA|I got a flag.||CC|- - for a feedwater dump very shortly. Okay, FEEDWATER, go to AUX, please.||LMP-EVA|I just got it.|06 00 26 00|CDR-EVA|Man, look at that mess of cable. I hope that thing's working, Bob.||CC|Every - Well, a lot of it's working, we've just got to try and see if we can't level this thing tonight. When you get off there, Jack, I'll talk to you a bit about procedures for that. And in the meanwhile, it's my understanding - -||LMP-EVA|Okay; that's good, Gene - -||CC|- - that the second UHT is not in the immediate vicinity, where it's accessible, is that right?||CDR-EVA|No, it is, I can get it.||CC|Okay; if you can - -||CDR-EVA|Okay, and watch my heat flow over there, don't trip over them.|06 00 26 38|LMP-EVA|Okay, I'm going to take a pair of tongs - -||CDR-EVA|Do you have any film at all?||LMP-EVA|No, I want your camera.||CDR-EVA|You want my camera?||CC|Okay, Jack, you won't need - we aren't planning on taking the ALSEP photos right now.||||Tape 97A/16||||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CC|Okay. And, Jack, we're not sure you went to AUX on your water yet.||CDR-EVA|||LMP-EVA|I thought I did.||CC|Okay, it's coming up, now, we see it coming, Jack, don't worry.||LMP-EVA|Gene, can you - Okay.||CDR-EVA|You got what you want?||LMP-EVA|Let me take the set of tongs in case I drop something.||CDR-EVA|Can you reach them?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|You got everything you need?||LMP-EVA|Yes.|06 00 27 42|CDR-EVA|Okay, Jack's got my camera and tongs, and I'm on my way.||CC|Okay, copy that.|06 00 27 50|LMP-EVA|Okay, I got a tone again, Bob. I got a tone again.||CC|Okay, what's it say? Probably just your water -... been building up - -||LMP-EVA|I can't - I can't read my gages. Want me to take - -|06 00 28 15|CDR-EVA|Well, we better take a look. Okay, I'm coming over there.||CDR-EVA|I just - I think I just got my water tone, Bob.||CC|Okay, that's right, also.||||||Tape 97A/17||LMP-EVA|Okay, AUX water's ON. We got our tones - our tones yesterday. Can you see anything?||CDR-EVA|Well, not unless - Let me see, let me brush your -Bend over. You don't have a brush to brush off. Okay, no flags.||LMP-EVA|Hey, wait a minute.||CDR-EVA|Okay. You got no -||LMP-EVA|Huh?||CDR-EVA|You got no flags.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CC|You look good to us, Jack.||CDR-EVA|Once more - a good look.|06 00 28 44|CC|Jack, you look good to us.||CDR-EVA|No flags. All right, no flags, Jack.||CC|Okay, and, Gene, I think you need to GO AUX - -||CDR-EVA|Okay.||CC|- - if you didn't.|06 00 28 53|CDR-EVA|Yes, I just did, Bob, and my water flag cleared.||CC|Okay, copy that - -||CDR-EVA|No, it didn't - not yet.||CC|Yes, it's probably still coming up.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Jack, just be careful of the cables.||LMP-EVA|Okay, you want me to get a UHT, huh?||CDR-EVA|It's right over there by the - -||LMP-EVA|Yes, I know where it is - -||||Tape 97A/18||||CC|If it's quite close, but if it's not, don't bother, I think we can probably try this by hand.||CDR-EVA|No, it's there, Bob; he'll get it.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|You got a heading for me at the Rover, is 017 good?||CC|018 - 018.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|You don't want me to kick the LEAM yet, huh?||CC|Negative.|06 oo 29 54|LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob, I've got a UHT.||CC|Okay, when you go back to the LSG, Jack, we first of all would like a reading of where the bubble is in the circle, whether it's in the center. And what we're going to have to have, unfortunately, is to have the bubble centered in the inner circle because the - this is, apparently, a requirement, even though we didn't train to it, apparently it's something that came up, and it's going to have to be within the inner circle of the bubble. The first thing we need to do is, when you go up there, is to see whether the bubble is in the center of the circle.|06 00 30 39|LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob. That bubble is centered.||CC|Okay. Okay, the next thing we want you to do is put the UHT in the socket there, and move the - -||LMP-EVA|Hey, Bob.||CC|- - LSG from side to side - -||LMP-EVA|Bob - -||CC|- - do not pick it up. Okay, go ahead, Jack.||||||Tape 97A/19||LMP-EVA|I did not have to touch it, it is centered.||CC|Okay, but now they're worried that it's stuck like your gimbal thing was last night and, also, the thing is that maybe - we maybe - something's hung up inside, and by moving it we can jostle it free. They do not want it picked up, but they'd like to have UHT put in there and sort of have the instrument rocked from side to side to again see the bubble move. And once that is done, to then press it down into the ground and again realign it and put the bubble within the inner circle. Over. They would also like to see if the gimbal is free.||LMP-EVA|How much do you want me to - how much do you want me to rock it? How far should I let the bubble travel?||CC|Basically, we just want to see it move. You - you go up to the outer circle, that's - that's plenty. And again, you ...||LMP-EVA|There's only one circle. Okay.||CC|Oh, I mean the outer rim, the - the rim of it.|06 00 32 05|LMP-EVA|Okay, I did that. It's still centered and gimbal is swinging.||CC|Okay, we copy the gimbal is swinging and we copy you moved the bubble out to the edge of the bubble level and come back into the inner circle.||LMP-EVA|That's right.|06 00 32 24|CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, I'm reading 089, 20.1, 002, 92, 88. Volts are 65 and 66. Batteries are 1 - 14 and 138. Rear motors are off scale low. Forward left is off scale low and right is 210 degrees.||CC|Copy that. What's the first battery temperature there, Gene?||CDR-EVA|First battery temperature is ll4.||||Tape 97A/20||||CC|Okay, Jack. They apparently don't believe you when you said you aligned it last night and they're concerned the shade is not on 20 degrees. Copy 114 on that battery temperature, Gene.||CDR-EVA|It is on - It's on 20, Bob.||CC|Okay. In that case, I guess you're free to come home.|06 00 33 28|LMP-EVA|Well, what is basically the problem with it?||CC|They haven't been able to level it for some reason, and they were afraid that the thing wasn't level. They were hoping also maybe by moving it that you might jostle it a bit and it would come to level, but I think we'll just have to think about it some more. The first presumption - the easiest solution was to have it unleveled, which case we could fix it this way. But I guess that's not the case. We'll have to see what happens overnight. Give us a chance to follow the tradition of coming back to the ALSEP tomorrow.||LMP-EVA|Well, do you want me to change it's posi - it's level a little bit - put it off level a little and see if you can work it.||CC|I don't think so, Jack. That doesn't sound very good to me - -||LMP-EVA|Well, it might be air in the level bubble or something.||CC|Why don't you just leave it there if it's centered with the level bubble within the inner - within the inner circle there. That's the requirements as far as we can tell, and we'll just have to leave it overnight again. And why don't you come on back to the LM.||CC|Okay, Gene, are you at the Rover?||CDR-EVA|Okay. Yes, sir. I'm parked.||CC|Okay - -||||||Tape 97A/21||CDR-EVA|Gave you my readings.||CC|Okay. You gave me my - your readings and when you get done, let me know, because the first thing we want to do is work on the SEP a little bit.|06 00 35 00|CDR-EVA|Okay. Stand by. Get TV. Okay. What do you want to do to the SEP?||CC|Okay, Geno. When you go back to the SEP now, and let's do this first and get it out of the way, it'll - you can probably do this anyway while Jack's coining home. When you opened the blankets, remember that at the back of the SEP there was a piece of Velcro on the case and a piece of Velcro just above the - just inside the rear hinge on the covers, and this is what you sort of peel back when you go to remove the back end there so you can get the DSEA out. You remember that piece of tape there?||CDR-EVA|Yes. That came off.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|That came off.||CC|Okay. This is on the side away from you as you stand facing it. Right?||LMP-EVA|Oh, no. That's the side - Go ahead, Gene, I'm sorry.||CDR-EVA|Okay, go ahead.||CC|Gene, I'm - if you stand facing it, in the back away from you Is this - there's a strip of Velcro on the case and there's another strip of Velcro on the blanket itself and this is the Velcro you have to tear off or to unhook, as it were, when you come to tear the blankets down to get the DSEA off. Remember that piece?||||Tape 97A/22||||CDR-EVA|Yes, but that's on the - yes, that's on the side away from me. I'm on the LMPs side and that's on the other side.||CC|Right. That's on the other side of the top. And what we're interested in, number 1, is that piece of Velcro still mated or when you open the blankets to cool it, does that Velcro come open? Over.||CDR-EVA|Well, that's the Velcro that's so full of dust it comes open, Bob.||CC|Okay, and so what happens - -||CDR-EVA|Trying to stay - it's hooked - it'll stay.||CC|Okay. Well, the feeling - -||CDR-EVA|I don't know if you can see that but it's - Well, you can't depend -||CC|Okay, well, feeling is that - -||CDR-EVA|Bob, I swung the covers and - they will stay open about 150 degrees.||CC|I - Stand by a minute. What you're saying is that the cover actually stands up a little bit in space.||CDR-EVA|Now, if you want the cover open, I can open it and normally it should swing 180 degrees parallel with the top of the SEP.||CC|Okay, but does that Velcro in back stay mated? - -||CDR-EVA|Well, the Velcro holds - the way that we've been opening it - it holds. Yes, it's being mated but it - but it and probably it holds the covers open 150 degrees.||CC|No. That's okay. What we're - talk - what the concern originally was was that when this - -||CDR-EVA|The Velcro - -||||||Tape 97A/23||CC|- - happened, the front light was getting down in the back there and warming up the back of the SEP. That's apparently not the case. Over.||CDR-EVA|No, that's not the case. The Velcro that came off is the Velcro that helps the - keeps the covers closed.||CC|Okay. We were concerned about both pieces of Velcro since the one had come off.||CDR-EVA|No. The other one is still on and it still holds in the back part of the SEP where the DSEA is in the shade.|06 00 38 22|CC|Okay. I copy that. Okay. While we're talking about this and I'll get back with you, turn the DSEA and the receiver both to OFF, please. And read me a temperature, please.||CDR-EVA|112 degrees.||CC|Copy that. And I mark them both off, right?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Bob, I just dusted it as clean as it'll get.||CC|Okay. Thank you.|06 00 39 46|LMP-EVA|Hey, Bob.||CC|Go ahead.||LMP-EVA|I cheated on you.||CC|I was sure you would. What did you do?||LMP-EVA|I just sampled the glass in the bottom of a crater. I documented it by shooting the LM across the crater at infinity and then shooting the crater with sterep at 11 feet and in that cross-Sun pair at T; and then I s ampled it.||CC|Okay.||||Tape 97A/24||||LMP-EVA|Then I took a cross-Sun pair at 7 after.||CC|I guess - I guess now gnomon is a LM.||LMP-EVA|It's very fragile. That's right. It's very fragile, and I double bagged it. I don't know whether we can keep it or not.||CC|Okay. We'11 hope.||CDR-EVA|You may think about how to preserve it.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|While you're thinking, I'll put it on my floor pan, I guess. Okay. What do I have to do here?||CDR-EVA|Get this bag off me to start.||LMP-EVA|Get that bag off you to start with.||CDR-EVA|Be careful of that sample there.||CDR-EVA|Those are the cleanest battery covers in existence on a Rover right now, I tell you. Oh, you don't believe me - look at that.||LMP-EVA|What?||CDR-EVA|They don't believe me.||LMP-EVA|Excuse me. Move forward just a little. And I'll get your bag. Here you go.||CDR-EVA|Now you're stuck down there, aren't you? No you're not. Seems like you ... I may be going nuts talking to that moving machine over there.||LMP-EVA|Boy, I - we don't need any hooks; I'll tell you.||CDR-EVA|I know it.||LMP-EVA|Can you stoop just a little bit.||CDR-EVA|Yes, all that stuff is getting - There, it's fixed.||||||Tape 97A/25||LMP-EVA|Get your hook back.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I hooked my harness back up so I don't forget that.|06 00 4l 50|LMP-EVA|Velcro's closed. Okay. You know as you look at those little sparkles in the soil we're walking on and they change colors on you - -||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|- - Greens and purples, iridescent. Iridescent sparkles.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I'll come over, and I'll unload.your stuff.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Now, we got more samples than we've got sense - I think. Let's see here - you got - you're taking care of the SEP.||CDR-EVA|Yes, don't - that's all right. Okay. Hey Bob, the battery covers - or the covers are open on the SEP, rather.||CC|Roger. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Oh, why did I do that?||LMP-EVA|Hey, Bob, you think that glass sample would be better off in the SRC?||CC|We're still talking about that.|06 00 42 46|CDR-EVA|Wait a minute. Your core cap assembly empty. Up and away it goes. And that's all closed. Check your bag. Okay. Now, Bob, you've got to tell us which one of these you want in the SCB and which one you want just taken in because we got our numbers sill confused.||CC|Okay. Go ahead. What we would like to do here - -||CDR-EVA|Got it.||||Tape 9TA/26||||CC|- - the closeouts, guys. Let me read this to you first of all. In the SRC, we'd like the following stuff along with - let's see - Stand by.||CDR-EVA|Is this 9 or 6?||CC|Okay, guys. We're going to follow an Apollo 16 mode and put stuff in loose, because they'd like to segregate stuff in the following way. Like to put the long can and four core tubes in the SRC. I guess it's going to take a long - going to take a while just carrying stuff back and forth. But they'd probably like to get this in, because it's a volatile stuff. They'd like to get the long can and three core tubes in the SRC number 1. And then we'd like to get all the SCB-4 samples in the same SRC. Over.||LMP-EVA|Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.||CDR-EVA|Yes. You want - -||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|- - Three - three - three plus the long can; that's four cores all together.||CC|Right. Put those in the SRC -||CDR-EVA|All samples from 4.||CC|All the samples from SCB-4.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|These are 4. You want to get the core tubes in first, though.|06 00 44 40|CDR-EVA|Yes. I want to put these in. If you'd give me the - Yes, I only got two hands. I'll come back by the time you pick them out.||||||Tape 97A/27||CC|Okay, and then, 17* do you guys remember where the trench samples - the three trench soil samples -which bag those were put in - from station 4? Over||CDR-EVA|Yes, let's see. I'm the only one who had bags, so I bagged them and put them in whatever bag Jack had. I think.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CC|Okay, then that'll be SCB-4, so we'd like those in SCB-4. And that - those are the ones that will go in the rock box and that1s in agreement with what we want to do.||CDR-EVA|Okay, give me those other two cores, if you've got them, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Long can.||LMP-EVA|The long can. Here's a - oh. Got it? It's slippery.||CDR-EVA|Yes, and we need one more core.||LMP-EVA|One more core.||CDR-EVA|Okay. That right now? Three core tubes and a long can?||CDR-EVA|Yes, got them all.||CC|And then - Roger that. And then SCB-4 - all the samples in SCB-4. We won't bother to try and sort them out, and then beyond that we'll fill them up with samples from SCB-5. Over.||CDR-EVA|Which one's that? That's 5* Let me get 4, first.||LMP-EVA|Here, hold this. I'll get it.||CDR-EVA|Well, it's on the gate right there, just hanging. I just put it there.||||Tape 97A/28||||CDR-EVA|Four is the one I had on there at Shorty? Or you had on at Shorty? Yes. You had it on. I don't know, but they should have that logged. That's -I don't remember who had it on.||LMP-EVA|Well, now wait a minute. I - I took the trench. You held the bags, and I put them in you.||CDR-EVA|You put them on me. Did I have 4 on at Shorty?||CC|Yes.||LMP-EVA|That's what they said.||CC|That's affirm. That's why we want SCB-4 put in the - or dumped into the thing. But it's a dirty bag, so we just want to dump the samples in.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Okay. And you want 5 to fill it up. Okay, Bob -|06 00 47 27|CC|Okay. And, Jack, it probably would protect the glass a bit better if you put it in the SRC gently with the other rocks there. But particularly if you don't fill the SRC too full. But, again, we'11 be putting SCB samples in there to more or less flesh it out if there's not too many SCB-4 samples.||LMP-EVA|Leave a space for a sample, I guess, Gene.||CDR-EVA|Yes, you'd better give it to me. There's not much space, it's going fast. You really - -||LMP-EVA|Well, can you leave one -||CDR-EVA|Where is the sample?||LMP-EVA|Well, it's over here.||CDR-EVA|I'll get it.||LMP-EVA|Ho, I'll bring it to you. I just - There's some way to -||||||Tape 97A/29||CDR-EVA|Just set it in there. ... I'll be delicate with it. Take this bag back. Okay. It's in the right-hand back corner of the SRC.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|You're just about full - you - you got some left in there?||CDR-EVA|I got some small ones and some big ones, too.||LMP-EVA|Don't fill it too full.||CDR-EVA|No. Hey, we got some big rock samples.|06 00 48 58|CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. SCB-6 and SC - wait a minute - what's in 6?||CC|Six - probably nothing. But tell us - -||CDR-EVA|No, there's samples in 6.||CC|Okay. You should also have SCB-8 under your seat with samples in it.||CDR-EVA|This is what I sampled at - -||CC|At station 3, maybe.||CDR-EVA|Six has the samples from - from - Yes.||CC|Okay. Let's take up SCB-8 - -||CDR-EVA|We have more samples today than Carter - -||CC|And let's take up SCB-6 with a ... and why don't you dump out the Rover samples into SCB-6?||LMP-EVA|Well, one reason not to take 6 is I don't know if I can get it off.||CC|Okay. And let's save SCB-4 because I think you may need that tomorrow.||CDR-EVA|Four is on the rack, empty.||||Tape 97A/30||||CC|Okay. How about SCB-5? Is that only partially emptied, or is it totally emptied?||CDR-EVA|Oh, it's about half full, Bob.||CC|Okay. We'll take that up with us.|06 00 50 08|CDR-EVA|Bob - Bob, I've already - Let me tell you what I've done. I've got SCB-8 full.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Let's take it up.||CC|Roger. On that.||CDR-EVA|It's got Rover samples in it.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|But I can't get them all. They won't all be in there.||CC|Okay, 8.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Bob, the seal was clean. It was clear, and I got - I got your four cores - three cores, plus a long can. I got Jack's glass. I got SCB-4 and a couple of samples out of SCB-5.||CC|Copy that. Sounds great.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Now where was I? You got me all out of whack, here.||CC|That's affirm.||CDR-EVA|Core cap dispenser - Okay, you're clean cosmic ray is done. SCB-5, yes, okay. Now, Jack, we've got SCB-5 that's half full. What have you got over there?||LMP-EVA|Bring it over here, and I'll put it into 6. Six is half - is a little more than half full.||CDR-EVA|Well, this is a little less than half full. Okay.||||||Tape 97A/31||LMP-EVA|That ought to make one full bag. Hey, these are big rocks so they'll come out easy. Where's that big, big rock we got? That's in one of those bags, too. Picked up a big rock - here let me see if I can't dump it. How's that for a lunar dump, huh? Perfect.||CDR-EVA|I want to see if I can't dust - did you lock this one over here? - No.||LMP-EVA|Hey, don't lock those - -||CDR-EVA|No, I'm going to see if I can dust them and make them work easier.||LMP-EVA|Boy, I'll tell you - I really had to pull. I pulled harder than I like to in a pressure suit.||CDR-EVA|See if I can -|06 00 52 15|CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. SCB-8 and 6 are going up.||CC|Okay, and I understand 5 will be - -||CDR-EVA|... go up.||CC|- - on the gate.||CDR-EVA|Yes, sir, Bob. It'll be there.||LMP-EVA|And 7 under the LMPs seat.||CDR-EVA|4 and 5 sill be on the gate. You know, here's a problem for you tonight. You got any way of freeing up these gate hinges that lock the bags on? They're -I'm dusting them, but they're not going to lock - any of them. They're frozen tight, just about.||CC|Okay. Copy that. We'll talk about it.||CDR-EVA|If you do get them locked - if you do - if you do get them locked, you may never get them off.||CC|Okay. We'll give them something to work on overnight.||||Tape 97A/32||||CDR-EVA|Okay, I'm - I'm dusting them right now. But it -I still can't free them up.||LMP-EVA|Man those are heavy bags.||CC|Jack, have you got the top of the bag closed?||LMP-EVA|Yes, what do you need?|06 00 53 19|CC|Okay. No. John thought maybe you were still open. We were worried.||LMP-EVA|Oh, no, I latched them. I'll check them again before I go up.||CC|Okay, and we got no FSRs underneath the seat. We understand. Roger.||LMP-EVA|No, if - I just checked and it's - it's all - they're all in the bags. And the Rover sample bag is empty.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Not nothing left.||CDR-EVA|Bob, Bob, neither one of these bag latchers are going to latch on the back. I dusted them, but - -||CC|Okay. --||CDR-EVA|- - They're not going to work. I can't free them up--||CC|We'11 talk about it tonight - -||LMP-EVA|We'll use the seat.||CC|- - Don't worry about it now.||CDR-EVA|Yes, we can probably - we can probably use the seat. We've got a little more room than we had. Okay. Let me get something else done.||LMP-EVA|I wonder if I ought to take a sample bag holder up there to see if I can fix that, to see if it fixes.||||||Tape 97A/33||CC|Roger, Jack. I'd suggest that.||LMP-EVA|Probably ought to, huh?|06 00 54 28|CDR-EVA|Okay. Receiver's been dusted and blankets are open; power is OFF and OFF. Okay. I'm going to take the TGE off now, or dust it and then take it off, and then just leave it there.

Okay. I dusted all that. I just knocked as hard as I could, on my feet, several - several times.||||Tape 97A/U2||||CDR-EVA|What you're going to say is you want me to brush you, huh? Well, let me keep this out of the way so it doesn't get dusty.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Wonder if our bouncing around that gravimeter is going to disturn it like this.||LMP-EVA|Shouldn't.||CDR-EVA|Got to do - well - -||LMP-EVA|... Want me down.||CDR-EVA|You got to do me first.||LMP-EVA|Yes.

It's still hard to believe.||LMP-EVA|What did we deserve to do - do to deserve being out here, huh?||CDR-EVA|Okay. That's not very good. Let me get your -some - your PLSS, here. Keep - go forward just a little. ... There you go.||LMP-EVA|Think your sharp turns are - Hey, that fender is -is really a classic.

We ought to leave one in tribute - Dr. Young.||CDR-EVA|Oh, that orange soil was something.||LMP-EVA|Huh?||CDR-EVA|And the way it went radially down that - down that crater. Let me turn, and then take another look, and then I'11 - then you get up there.||LMP-EVA|You got quite a bit around your hoses here.||CDR-EVA|My hoses?||LMP-EVA|Okay, and I don't know what I can do about it, Geno.||CDR-EVA|Oh, just give it a swap ...||||Tape 97A/44||||LMP-EVA|Well, I got it the best I could.

I don't have anything on it.||LMP-EVA|No, that's right. You don't. It isn't - it's about the same.||CDR-EVA|When you fall out - you fall out on your other arm.||LMP-EVA|I've got - there is some on that leg there.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Don't know what I'm going to do about it. I think we're Just going to have to make do.||CDR-EVA|Let me see what I can do with you. Just look at me.|06 01 14 22|LMP-EVA|What is this rock, right here, by the pad.||CDR-EVA|I don't know - I. Did I just turn your comm? Do you still hear me?||LMP-EVA|Yes. I've just been intending to mention that several times. Anybody that lands on a rock ought to have their head examined.||CDR-EVA|Put their ladder - Boy, where have you been again today?||LMP-EVA|Oh, I played some games there around station 3. I'm sorry.||||||Tape 97A/45||CDR-EVA|Boy, oh, boy!||LMP-EVA|Wasn't intentional.||CDR-EVA|Whoo - But I - lot of your turns - -||CDR-EVA|Hold your arm up.

Hey, I am strong enough. That's one we ought to bring home.||LMP-EVA|Well, if we can't fill up the LM with everything else.||CDR-EVA|That's about the size of the S - SRC. Stand up on the pad. Oh, shoot! First time that's happened.||LMP-EVA|Here, hold on to me.||CDR-EVA|You know, by rights , that should of happened more. I want to get around back and then I want you to get up on the ladder some. Oh, man, let me get the back of your PLSS. What did you bump against? I guess that's from the Rover seat.||LMP-EVA|I think it is.||CDR-EVA|No, I mean you got a couple abrasions right on through the - -||LMP-EVA|So do you. I wasn't going to mention them.||CDR-EVA|Well, these are only a pin-hole thick, but - -||LMP-EVA|All I can say is it's better than walking.||CDR-EVA|Oh, man, I'll tell you, we covered over 20 kilometers today, babe.

I need the pallet.||CDR-EVA|Oh, Bob, you're a beauty. How did you think of that?||CC|John suggested it.||CDR-EVA|John who? (Laughter) He strikes again. You'd broke yours off sure, because I wouldn't have seen it as you went up unless I took inventory with my book, which I'll do here in a minute. Open battery covers, taken care of; dusted LCRU; blankets open 100 percent. They've been open 100 percent all day.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|If I can just get up here. Oh, shoot.

Are the three SCBs inside the hatch already?||CDR-EVA|No - Bob, I don't think any of them are inside. Let's see I've got - -||LMP-LM|No.||CDR-EVA|- - I've got 8 here and 6 here and - and we emptied the contents of 4 into the - -||CC|Roger.||CDR-EVA|- - SRC, and we emptied the contents of 5 into one of these other two bags. So we've only got two of them here, plus the SRC.||CC|Roger that.||CDR-EVA|Five went into 6.||CC|Roger that.||CDR-EVA|And we've got two of them hanging on the tail of the Rover. And I don't know what it is under Jack's seat right now.||LMP-LM|Seven is under my seat.||CC|We copy that. Don't worry about it.|06 01 24 03|LMP-LM|One more battery, Geno, and it's yours.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-LM|You always used to stand and watch me do this, anyway.||CDR-EVA|Yes, but we had some long EVAs at the Cape, but -||||Tape 97A/50||||LMP-LM|There you go.||CDR-EVA|Okay.

Ready?||CDR-EVA|Sorry, babe.||LMP-LM|It's all right.||CDR-LM|Now, this one's going to come open if we're not careful. Let me see if I've got one more step to go up. No I think that's the last one. I'll just hold it here until you get it. I could shove that in if I push it with the SRC. Jack, the cap'll came open. Be careful.||LMP-LM|Okay. We got big silver box.||CDR-EVA|Can you push on that a little bit?||LMP-LM|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Okay.|06 01 26 13|CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, you've got the two SR - two SCBs -||LMP-LM|I'll push it in.||CDR-EVA|- - SRC, and there goes the ETB.||CC|Copy that. Now how about a CDR?||CDR-EVA|There's only one thing left - that's right, that's the only thing left out here.||LMP-LM|Are you on a checklist?||CDR-EVA|No, I'm not even on my checklist, but I guess -Yes, I am, it says INGRESS.

Okay, the hatch is partially closed - -||CDR-LM|Let me get it. I think it says to lock it, doesn't it?||LMP-LM|Well, we're supposed to close our water first.||CDR-LM|Okay, FORWARD HATCH, CLOSE and LOCK; dump valves both AUTO, okay; confirm our water CLOSED. Let me see if I can't get my ... here.||LMP-LM|Here, why don't I get yours and you get mine.||CDR-LM|Okay. I just got mine. And if you'll turn, I'll get yours. You'll have to - your PLSS - your right arm high; pick it up high.||LMP-LM|Oh, wait a minute.||CDR-LM|No, I can't reach you, Jack, unless you turn -||LMP-LM|Don't move yet; don't turn around.||CDR-LM|Okay.||LMP-LM|Move over to the corner.||CDR-LM|Okay. ... sure I got the right ones.

Water's OFF.||CDR-LM|Now, stay there and I'll lock the hatch.||LMP-LM|I've got to get into position to do the other good things. You go ahead.||CDR-LM|Am I - Do you have enough room or do I need to turn? No, let me get down there. Now, why can't - -||LMP-LM|Okay. Let me turn back; get out of your way. Got it?|06 01 29 44|CDR-LM|Okay. Hatch is closed and locked.||CC|Okay. And remember, I think it's the overhead valve that you have to position to OPEN.||LMP-LM|That's right.||CDR-LM|Yes, you'll have to move over, Jack, so I can reach it.||CC|And you ought to verify both, I guess.||CDR-LM|You're going to have to wait, then.||LMP-LM|Can you reach it now?||CDR-LM|Okay. No, you got to - got to swing left - -||LMP-LM|Well, I'll have to -||CDR-EVA|- - Right.||LMP-LM|I'll have to turn around, then. How's that? Any better?||CDR-LM|No, you've got to - Okay.||LMP-LM|Gene, for some reason I can't put my PLSS toward you.||CDR-LM|No, you can't. Just face front, if you can, and move as far forward as you can.||LMP-LM|Well, if I get my - I'm going to have to go all the way around, I guess.||||||Tape 97A/53||CDR-LM|Well, just -||LMP-LM|Look, I've got to get the PLSS against the circuit breaker -||CDR-LM|Wait. I've got you just where I want you. Now stay right there, and shift your weight as far to the right as you can.|06 01 30 48|CDR-LM|Okay, it's AUTO - -||LMP-LM|Okay.|06 01 30 50|CDR-LM|- - and it's - and it's locked. Okay?||LMP-LM|All right.||CDR-LM|Now, CABIN REPRESS - AUTO. Can't get it. I'll have to turn left, here.||LMP-LM|Huh?||CDR-LM|Okay. Let me turn left.||LMP-LM|No, I can get it.||CDR-LM|Okay.

Next thing, Jack, you can start verifying your white dots are out.||LMP-LM|Okay.||CDR-LM|And you can lose your PURGE valve to depress , if you have to.||LMP-LM|Well, I don't think I have to. Okay; white dots.||CDR-LM|Wait a minute. White dot's plus for you, EVA decals||LMP-LM|Okay, I'm good here, here, here.|06 01 32 54|CC|And, 17, congratulations.

We think that's what happened.||CDR-LM|Okay.||CDR-LM|Well, I never thought I'd wear my EV cover gloves through two EVAs.||LMP-LM|Oh, I forgot all about them.||||Tape 98A/2||||CDR-LM|No, I didn't. I thought about taking them off until I started chipping those boulders. And I'm glad I wore them.||LMP-LM|Yes, I think it's a good idea.||CDR-LM|As hard as it is on your hands, mine - these cover gloves are just ripped to a nub. Glad it's not my gloves.||LMP-LM|I might consider taking them off tomorrow.||CC|Roger, 17. You talking about your cover gloves?||CDR-LM|Yes. We're still wearing them, Bob. And, I swore I'd take them off after the drill, but I used a bit of real-time common sense.||CC|Okay.||LMP-LM|Okay. Gloves are off. LMP's gloves are off. Need some help?||CDR-LM|... Yes. I think you just about - -||LMP-LM|No, you went the other way.||CDR-LM|Did I go the wrong way? Yes, I did.||LMP-LM|What's wrong with that one?||CDR-LM|I don't know.||LMP-LM|Shouldn't have done that.||CDR-LM|Hey - you - Let me get this.||CDR-LM|My hand!||LMP-LM|Yes, I'm sorry.||CDR-LM|Well, you get that one, and I'll get these two. Get that one.||||||Tape 98A/3||CDR-LM|Ought to get this one.||LMP-LM|I'll take that off. (Laughter) Hold this thing. Okay. Let me try that one, now.||CDR-LM|It wants to go.||LMP-LM|Let me try that. Yes, that one ... off. Got it?||CDR-LM|Yes.||LMP-LM|It's usually easier when you do it yourself. The angle's wrong.||CDR-LM|Oh, boy. It's starting to get a little stiff. Oh, they came off. Wow, they came off. Oh, ho , ho, ho. Okay. Doff helmets, with visors. Here I'll get yours for you.

I don't know whether it's - they're just soaking wet.||CDR-LM|Everything is just twice as hard.||LMP-LM|Now comes the old hay fever, again. That went up and that went down.||CDR-LM|Stow in BRA. Let's get mine off though.||LMP-LM|... now that these things are off.||CDR-LM|Oh, man. Does that smell, doesn't it? You sure can pick that up.||LMP-LM|Okay. You got yours?||CDR-LM|I've got mine.|06 01 38 34|CDR-LM|Okay, Bob.

The helmets and gloves are off.||CC|Absolutely outstanding crew, there.||CDR-LM|Why don't you go home and get some sleep, Bob?||CC|Absolutely outstanding. I can't say more than that. And I mean it from the bottom of my heart or the bottom of my soul or something, my conscience.||LMP-LM|Thank you, Bob. Well, it's all ours.||CDR-LM|Bob, it's all your good training and help - -|06 01 39 34|CC|777 plus 37, from 3.5 to 3.5.||LMP-LM|As mission scientists, you're totally responsible.||CC|And the backup crew says that you are even better than outstanding.||LMP-LM|Remember, it's in your contract (laughter). Well, thank you. We enjoyed it.||CC|Hey, I'll turn you over to Little Joe, here, while I go talk to some people.||LMP-LM|Thanks again, Bob. We - -||CC|We've got a 9 and 1/2 hour EVA scheduled for you tomorrow. We're planning to spend 2 and 1/2 hours extra over there at station 4.||CDR-LM|(Laughter) I hope those gloves that you've got packed in the back have got something in them. (Laughter) Oh, let's read the checklist. See if we can go to bed on time tonight.||||||Tape 98A/5||LMP-LM|Oh, man.||CC|Okay. That might be a change.||LMP-LM|I feel better them I did last night, as a matter of fact.||CDR-LM|Do you?||CC|I'm turning you over - I'm going to turn you over to Joe.||LMP-LM|That didn't do very much good.||CC|See you guys tomorrow.||CDR-LM|Okay. Verify safety on dump valve. Yes.||LMP-LM|Okay, Bob. Get some sleep, huh?||CDR-LM|Yes, I verified them both.||LMP-LM|Sorry to be touchy, occasionally.||CDR-LM|DESCENT WATER valve, OPEN.|06 01 40 51|LMP-LM|Okay. WATER valve's OPEN.||CDR-LM|Okay. Then you can take your purge valve off.||CDR-LM|There's a little dust in that tonight. Little stiffer. ... again. Remove purge valves, stow in purse. Disconnect OPS hoses.||LMP-LM|Oh, man. That is dusty.||CDR-LM|Yes, let's - let me disconnect yours; you disconnect mine. It's easier with the - the -||LMP-LM|I think I can get - What did you say?||CDR-LM|- - OPS hoses.||||Tape 98A/6||||LMP-LM|Oh, yes. Or whatever it said.||CDR-LM|Yes.||LMP-LM|Disconnect - disconnect OPS hose. Is that what it said?||CDR-LM|Yes.||CDR-LM|Man - maneuver my fingers in here a little bit better.||LMP-LM|They are all showing a little bit ... stickiness. Mine were in this in pairs.||CDR-LM|(Laughter) Well, just everything's, you know, harder to fit.|06 01 42 01|LMP-LM|Okay. There, you're disconnected.||CDR-LM|PGA diverter valve, horizontal.|06 01 42 05|LMP-LM|Okay. Horizontal.||CDR-LM|And SUIT IS0L, both to SUIT FLOW.||LMP-LM|All right - -||CDR-LM|We don't have the IM hoses on. So don't - Put mine to SUIT FLOW to get some air in here.||LMP-LM|Yes. ... in the dust.|06 01 42 27|CDR-LM|PLSS pump, off, and fan, off.||LMP-LM|Okay.||CDR-LM|Man, that's hot. Feel that.||LMP-LM|Out in the Sun.||CDR-LM|Yes.|06 01 42 40|LMP-LM|Pump's off. Fan's off.||||||Tape 98A/7||CDR-LM|Okay. Oh - Disconnect PLSS H2O from PGA. Okay.||LMP-LM|And connect IM water. That's what we want.||LMP-LM|... the ... and ... flags.||CDR-LM|Yes, and IM water - water hose, here.||LMP-LM|I'm sorry that's so complex, there.||CDR-LM|Oh, that's perfectly fine.||LMP-LM|But it was easier to start.||CDR-LM|It had to be. Smells like someone's been firing a carbine in here.||CDR-LM|I'm just standing here pushing that -||LMP-LM|...||CDR-LM|Hot breaker - When you get it.|06 01 43 26|CDR-LM|Hey, little Joe? Are you there?||CC|17» this is Houston. And - -||CDR-LM|Little Joe, are you there?||CC|Roger. How do you read Houston? Over.|06 01 43 43|CDR-LM|Joe, we're reading you loud and clear. We're -the left-hand column and we're both going PLSS mode to 0 and we'll be off the air for a skosh.||CC|Roger, Geno. I've been following you real close, and you two are mighty smooth. Boy, was that nice today.||LMP-LM|... feel how hot that is.||CDR-LM|Yes, the whole thing.|06 01 47 42|LMP-LM|Okay, Joe. LMP's PLSS is getting 0||CC|Thank you.||||Tape 98A/8|||06 01 51 45|LMP-LM|Joe, O2 is off.||CC|Roger.|06 01 52 57|CDR-LM|Hey, Joe. This is Gene.||CC|Go ahead.||CDR-LM|Hey, Challenger has been holding at about 5-5 ever since we got in here. Are you all happy with that?||CC|Looks good to us, Geno. We have been watching it and everyone is happy down here.||CDR-LM|Okay. Well, this morning, when we were getting ready, we saw it at 5.5 and part of that has been at 5-0 all of the time. Just so we are not venting anything, that's all.||CC|Geno, we hear you on that and we'll - we'll be watching it.|06 01 54 16|CDR-LM|Joe, we're about 2 minutes into the CDR's O2 charge.||CC|Thank you.|06 01 55 48|LMP-LM|Joe, IMP has 96 percent on his gage.||CC|Thank you, Jack. We copy that.|06 01 56 52|CC|Geno, with regard to your observation made to us a few moments ago, I guess we will ask for the CABIN RETURN to the AUTO position and your SUIT DIVERTER valve to CABIN, please. We are about 0.2 of a psi from CABIN RELIEF. Over.||CDR-LM|Okay, we’re getting that now.|06 01 57 57|CDR-LM|Joe, CDR is reading 94 percent on the O2 charge.||CC|Thank you.|06 02 04 4?|LMP-LM|Okay, Joe. LMP's OPS pressure is 6300.||||||Tape 98k/9||CC|Thank you.|06 02 07 57|CDR-LM|Commander's OPS pressure is 6100.||CC|Copy, 6100.|06 02 09 02|LMP-LM|Say, Joe, our cabin pressure is rising even higher, now. About 5*7*||CC|We copy that.||LMP-LM|Joe, Joe, we had the commander1s hoses stowed, but in SUIT FLOW. That might have done it. Is that right?||CC|Sounds very plausible, Jack. We'll look at it a little more here.|06 02 13 14|CC|Challenger, this is Houston. Requesting you move demand REGs A and B to EGRESS, please.|06 02 13 28|LMP-LM|They're EGRESS.||CC|Okay.||CC|17, Houston. We noted down here that your SUIT DIVERTERS went to EGRESS and we want the demand REGs to the EGRESS position, please.||LMP-LM|That's right, but the SUIT GAS DIVERTER extends when you go to EGRESS.||CC|You're right, again.|06 02 17 04|LMP-LM|Houston, do you figure we're relieving?||CC|Jack, we don't think so. It looks like you're pretty steady at between 5-5 and 5*6. We're watching it very closely, however.||LMP-LM|Okay, you know when we had that problem this morning, I hope I didn't - the backflow did not hurt something when I had the LMP's hoses stowed in the IS0L valve and SUIT FLOW.||||Tape 98A/10||||CC|Jack, just for your information, we saw about the same thing last night. The only difference was the pressure didn't climb quite so high. So, we think whatever it is, it really doesn't involve the problem - small problem you had this morning.||LMP-LM|Okay,' Joe.|06 02 19 35|CDR-LM|Okay, Joe. We got the commander's PLSS back in the recharge station. We got a new battery in it, odd numbers and a new - and a new canister in it and we are working on the IM - on Jack's right now.||CC|Okay, Gene. Sounds good.|06 02 22 44|CC|17, Houston.||LMP-LM|Go ahead, Joe.||CC|We are still watching your cabin pressure down here. Could you check for us, please, if the PLSS fill valve is securely closed?||LMP-LM|Yes, it was closed.||CC|Okay.||LMP-LM|Joe, do you want me to check out the regulator?||CC|Stand by.|06 02 23 49|LMP-LM|Houston, Challenger. Do you want me to check the -Okay. ED BATs are 37.2.||CC|Copy that.|06 02 24 00|LMP-LM|PCM's going HIGH.||LMP-LM|Let me know when you're ready for the battery management.||CC|Roger.||||||Tape 98A/11|06 02 25 31|CC|17, Houston. Stand by on the battery management for a few minutes, please. And, in the meantime, could you check the low pressure PLSS fill valve, closed, please? Over.||LMP-LM|Joe, I checked that. It's closed.||CC|Thank you.||CDR-LM|Houston, Challenger.||CC|Go ahead.||CDR-LM|Yes, your - does you telemetry and our gage come off the same telemetry on that? Same transducer?||CC|That's affirm. It does. And, Challenger, we've got a canmunications problem at one of the sites and are going to ask you to go to panel 12 and turn the POWER AMPLIFIER to PRIMARY, please.|06 02 28 27|LMP-LM|Okay, it's PRIMARY.||CC|And, Challenger, we're ready for battery management , at your convenience.||LMP-LM|Okay, stand by.|06 02 32 03|CDR-LM|Hey, Joe.||CC|Go ahead.||CDR-LM|Okay, this is Geno. I just dug a rock out of my pocket. You - no one back there probably remembers, but when we were at Shorty, fumbling around, trying to get everything done, I said there was a piece of very shiny black glasslike-looking material that reminded me of - of obsidian Well, it's not. It looks like a very fine-grained gray rock. But, it's a fractured piece and it looks like it - I've picked up fractures of about three or four vesicle faces on it. The vesicle faces are very shiny and that's what reflected and caught my eye. I think the unique part about it is - Jack may want to tell you something else||||Tape 98A/12|||||about it - the unique part about it is - I picked it up Shorty. Undocumented, halfway between the Rover and where we were sampling that orange stuff. And it will be in bag 12 Echo.||CC|Okay, Geno. Copy, 12 Echo. And, I was assured by the folks here when I came in - -||CDR-LM|That'll go in it.||CC|- - that - that you did indeed have shiny sample of some kind in your pocket and would probably find it later on. So, we called that one. Could you turn OFF the POWER AMPLIFIER - -||CDR-LM|Okay, we'll put in it in SCB-8.||CC|Okay, go ahead.|06 02 33 34|CDR-LM|Okay, it's off and we will put that rock in that sample bag and put in SCB-8.||LMP-LM|Joe, this - rock looks very much like 12008, 12008. It's a fine-grained, coarsely - very coarsely vesicular gray rock - probably basaltic.||CC|Okay, Jack. Real fine. We'll - want LOW BIT RATE, POWER AMPLIFIER, OFF, and LOW BIT RATE and we can maybe label that one 17008. How does that sound?||CDR-LM|No, you got to label Gene-rock. I was going to tell you those other things, but I thought I'd let Jack.||CC|Okay, thank you.||LMP-LM|The vesicles, if I may project the size of them, probably were up to 4 or 5 centimeters in diameter. They're irregular in shape, but they're clearly vesicles and it looks like they are lined with either glass or very fine-grained crystals. They're very shiny.||CC|Roger.||||||Tape 98A/13||CDR-LM|And for our next act -|06 02 35 48|CC|Jack, we're going to ask for your next act that you check for us both PLSS valves OFF and both OPS valves OFF. Over.|06 02 36 51|LMP-LM|Joe, they're both verified OFF.||CC|Okay, Jack. We understand that all four valves are verified OFF.||LMP-LM|That's affirm, Joe.||CC|Okay, thank you. I'm sure that you realize that we're still showing that pressure increasing very, very slowly and are pretty well convinced that nothing is leaking in from the outside. So, we are looking around on the inside here.||CDR-LM|Joe, is our oxygen consumption abnormal at this point?||CC|No, not al all, Geno. Everything looks pretty normal, except this - this slow creep in the cabin pressure.||LMP-LM|Well, the - I guess the possibility is a creeping RBG or a transducer, is that right?||CC|Yes, either that or it may be we're just watching seme of the effects of the thermal shock that your tanks took when - from the repress itself. We're not worried about it at all, but we are still watching it.||LMP-LM|Joe, you might make a note that my two SEP area samples went into bag 8 also.||CC|Roger, Jack. That's noted.||CDR-LM|Joe, got seme numbers, if you'd like them?||CC|Go ahead.||CDR-LM|SRC is 41.5- Bag 6 is 24, bag 8 is 35*||||Tape 98A/14||||CC|Copy, 4l.5 and 24 in bag 6; 35 for bag 8.||CDR-LM|That's it.||CDR-LM|Joe, how many samples did we get today?||CC|Stand by.||CDR-LM|Don't start a big investigation. I was just curious.||CC|Let me ask around, Gene. We will see in a minute.||CC|173 we think you have 54 samples from this EVA, plus some cores.||CDR-LM|Thank you, Joe. Just curious.||CC|That's not half bad.|06 02 4l 56|CDR-LM|And, Joe, we're on 5-5 and I am going to start doffing.||CC|Okay, Geno. Copy 5-5, and before you get started there, would you put both demand REGs to CLOSED, please? As we continue to watch this pressure.|06 02 42 19|CDR-LM|Okay, Joe. Demand REG A, going CLOSED. Demand REG B going CLOSED.||CC|Thank you. And we verify them both CLOSED.|06 02 47 54|CC|17, this is Houston. We'd like SUIT DIVERTER back to CABIN, please?|06 02 48 04|CDR-LM|CABIN.||CC|Okay.|06 02 51 46|CC|Gene and Jack, you'll be interested to hear that the cabin PRES is dropping down, very slowly now. So, we think we have a tiny leak in one of the cabin regulators, one of the demand regulators, and we'll run a check after you get squared away there a little better.||||||Tape 98A/15||CDR-LM|Okay, Joe. We'll be at your beck and call.|06 02 52 26|CC|I'll only smile at that.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 99A/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|06 03 07 51|CDR-LM|Houston, Challenger.||CC|Go ahead.|06 03 08 00|CDR-LM|Joe, we're going to air out the suits. We're going to go to SUIT FLOW on the Commander's ISOL valve now.||CC|All righty.||CDR-LM|Say again.||CC|That sounds good.|06 03 IT 02|LMP-LM|Joe, I guess you giys are tired of looking at ny heart beat. So, I'm gonna turn the BIOMED off as I get out of my suit.||CC|Okay, Jack.|06 03 17 49|CDR-LM|Hey, Joe. This is Geno. How do you read me?||CC|Geno, you're 5 by.||CDR-LM|Okay, we're going to get Jack out of his suit. I'll be - I'll be monitor.||CC|Roger. From the way the two of you worked today, I'd think you could just about turn him upside down and pour him out.||CDR-LM|Yes, if he'd fit through that little hole in the end of his wrist.||LMP-LM|Joe, the day they can pour me out of anything, they'll call me slim. Talk to you later.||CC|Okay. Among other things.||CDR-LM|Remember those nice white suits?||CC|The Clean Room will never be the same again.||||Tape 99A/2||||CDR-LM|You'd never believe it.|06 03 38 34|CC|Challenger, this is Houston.||CDR-LM|Go ahead, Houston. Challenger here.||CC|Geno, we're going to start to investigate which of your demand regulators is leaking and we're going to ask you to put DEMAND REG Alfa to CABIN now. And, as we watch, it, please do not make any urine dumps. Over.|06 03 39 03|CDR-LM|Okay, we will not make any urine dumps and we'll go to CABIN now. Okay, Alfa's in CABIN. And we'll be ready for your debriefing here in about 5 minutes.||CC|Okay, Geno. And, it's going to be a short one.|06 03 47 17|LMP-LM|Okay, Houston.

And what's our present rev?||CC|Rev 32, Jack.||||||Tape 99A/3||CDR-LM|Hey, Joe, for pantry purposes, what day is this?||CC|We've checked around the room here and the consensus is that it's Wednesday morning. Over.||CDR-LM|Oh, okay. I really wanted to know whether it was irridated [sic] ham or frankfurter morning, and I guess we can work that out.||CC|"Roger, Gene. Apparently, the Surgeon is happy with either of those days. And we want you to turn to - right now, to 5-7 in the checklist and perform that - one particular step at 150 hours, which will prevent the computer clock from overflowing. And that's the ""PROCEED, VERB 37 ENTER, 06 ENTER, PROCEED"" step. We'll stand by for that. Give us a mark as you start it. Over."|06 03 51 34|CDR-LM|Okay, we're starting.|06 03 51 36|CDR-LM|PRO. PROCEED, VERB 37 ENTER - VERB 30 -|06 03 52 00|CDR-LM|Okay, Joe. You don't want me to go on the VERB 90 - You're not going to give us an update, huh?|06 03 52 07|CC|No update required. That was just to prevent an overflow. And then I'm ready for the quick changes in the Lunar Surface Checklist when you are.|06 03 52 45|LMP-LM|Okay, Joe, go ahead.||CC|"Okay. Begin by putting the demand REG Bravo to CABIN position and leave the demand REG Alfa in the - in the CABIN position where it now is. And I'll continue on with the changes in the checklist here. Page 5-6, left-hand side, where it reads ""Configure ETB."" The - the fourth line down that starts out ""Four B&W mags,"" they should read, ""Hotel, India, Juliet, and Romeo in LCG compartment."" Then going up to the right-hand side under ""Stow in ETB,"" change the line ""One B&W mag Romeo"" to read ""One B&W mag Kilo."" Over."||LMP-LM|"Okay, Joe. I changed the mags in the ""Empty"" from Kilo to Romeo and the mag in ""Stow"" from Romeo to Kilo."||||Tape 99A/4||||CC|Okay, that sounds like the thing to do. And a note on your demand regulators. We're showing that the demand regulator Alfa is - has good integrity and we're now in the process of checking the demand regulator Bravo. I've got a couple of fairly quick questions here when you're ready for those.||CDR-LM|Okay, Joe. Go ahead with your questions, and integrity is certainly what we need around here, right?||CC|Okay. Jack, a question for you to begin with. Is your gold visor sticking halfway down? Apparently, that's based on a discussion earlier. Over.||CDR-LM|Yes. Apparently his visor is sticking.||CDR-LM|Which one? The gold visor? No, he said his sunshade is sticking halfway down, but his gold visor's not.||CC|Okay, that answers the question. We couldn't tell from the TV whether it was the visor or the sunshade. That's fine. We also heard some discussion about possible wear in the seats of the suits when you were dusting each other off. We want to know if you could see the - any hint of the aluminum layers showing through in the suits. Over.||CDR-LM|No, Joe. Not to worry. It's just a few scars on the PLSS thermal blanket in back where you probably rub the seat when you get in. Nothing on the suits.||CC|Okay, Geno. Now two real quick geology questions that will help us do the planning for your EVA tomorrow. The first one has to do with station 4. And you called out some material on the rim there -the crater at station 4 - which looked like bedded spatter. And we're wondering if that resembled things that - that you'd seen in Hawaii? Over.|06 03 57 03|LMP-LM|Hey, Joe, I think they misheard. I think I may have said shattered and you might of said - thought||||||Tape 99A/5|||spattered. No, I didn't - neither one of us intended to leave that impression. The rock - the big rock we sampled was - looked like shattered -intensely shattered gabbro, such as we've had around the LM. The rocks, probably more significantly, that Gene - one of which Gene picked up with the fine-grained vesicular basalt - cor> -ely vesicular basalts. And we didn't have any time to really examine the interrelationships of those rock types there, but those were the two fragment types we s aw.||CC|Okay, Jack. That's quite clear to us now. Also a question about station 4 - -||LMP-LM|Joe - Joe.||CC|Okay, go ahead.|06 03 58 04|LMP-LM|The bottom of that crater, now, had material that was extremely disorganized in its aspect and, really, we didn't have time to examine it in detail in order to decide why it was disorganized. It did not necessarily look like the boulder that we sampled at the rim.||CC|Okay, Jack. Understand that. A question about the boulder you sampled at the rim. Would you compare the basalt in this boulder to - which I -you may have called a gabbro, I'm not sure - in any case the basalt - to samples which you collected at Camelot and at ALSEP. Over.||LMP-LM|Well, ny impression was that they were the same rock types.||CC|Okay, that's our impression, too. Thank you. That's - that's it for us on the questions. And for information, we're showing your cabin pressure is holding fairly steady even with both those demand regs on.||||Tape 99A/6||||CDR-LM|Okay. Keep watching it for us, would you, and let us know. I expect one of them is probably leaking pretty slow.||CC|You have no - no worry about that, Gene. We're looking at it real close.||CDR-LM|How's - how's America looking to you?||CC|It is just as clean as a whistle.||CDR-LM|It may not be when we get back there, judging from the looks - looks of us. That's good to hear, though. It's a good bird. So is this one.||LMP-LM|Joe, is there any - You got any more debriefing questions?||CC|Negative, Jack. And we're interested that you move right along so we can get you - get you turned in there and get some rest.||LMP-LM|We're moving. We're eating now, and we're - we're - we feel the same way, I think.||CC|Troops, enjoy your meal there. And at your convenience, you can go ahead with the feedwater recharge. We want you to hold off on the oxygen * recharge until we watch these regs for about another 10 minutes. And give us a mark if you do start the water recharge, please. Over.|06 04 01 36|CDR-LM|Okay.||CC|And if there are any ways we can cut corners on the time here, it'll be helping us, because we're still looking at - at being down a couple of hours nearly.||CDR-LM|Okay, Joe. We're working at it as fast as we can. Best place in the world to make it up is tomorrow night.||CC|Right, Geno, and we - actually, we're going to pick up a good one shortly, because we're coining||||||Tape 99A/7|||up to a pad in the time line. So, as long as we don't waste too much time, we're doing pretty well.||CDR-LM|Okay; be assured we're not. There's just a certain amount of housekeeping we have to do. But, very seriously, day after tomorrow is a very short day, and I think we ought to look at making up any time. I'm a hold-faster' on sleep periods but tomorrow is the one that I think is flexible.||CC|Roger. We hear you.|o6 04 06 12|LMP-LM|Hey, Joe. This is Jack. We're eating here. Won't be too long at it, but if you've got any significant news or anything, why don't you give it to us?||CC|Jack, I don't know if it's significant news, but at least I know you will be interested. Both your demand regs look good now. We show no evidence of a leak there and it may have been that just recycling them reseated them and solved whatever problem we had. You can go ahead with the 0g recharge on the PLSS and the water recharge at your convenience. And let me poll the room here for other news items. Over.|06 04 08 21|CDR-LM|Okay, Joe, we're starting an 0? charge of the CDR's PLSS, 10 minutes.||CC|Okay.|06 04 13 29|CC|Challenger, this is Houston.||LMP-LM|Go ahead, Joe.||CC|Roger. This is a news report to eat by. I'll combine an orbital science report with a sports report, an unusual combination here. I'll start out with a sports report on Monday night football, which you may not have heard yet. Joe Namath tried mightily to lead the New York Jets into the||||Tape 99A/8|||||American Football League playoffs, but the Oakland Raiders grounded the Jets in a fourth quarter 24 to 16 blitz. Namath passed for more than 400 yards but, in spite of it, New York scored only cue touchdown. Moving along to the successes of Captain America, I'll run down different items in the SIM bay here, beginning with the UV spectrometer. In general, the data has been excellent. We're getting indications that the hydrogen atmosphere of the Moon is much less than expected. In fact, I don't think we're detecting any, but rather setting a limit on the amount of hydrogen around the Moon. There was an Aerobee launch -an attempt at an Aerobee launch - from White Sands on Monday to calibrate solar UV radiation, but this launch failed because an instrument viewing port in the rocket failed to open. A second launch - let's see - was scheduled, I think, for today, and I don't know whether that was successful or not, I guess it'll be launched later today. The infrared scanning radiometer is performing beautifully. Indications are that subsolar-point surface temperatures are higher than we've detected from our Earth-based observations before. We're seeing many thermal anomolies, particularly in Procellarum and in the Procellarum area west of Copernicus. And we're seeing also a few unusual cold spots, which apparently are indicating areas of very fine soil with a few or no blocks in and on the soil. The lunar sounder data is beautiful, and the power monitor signals we find correlate with the surface features. And the HF data indicates to us that we are detecting a variety of layers in the mare areas.|06 04 16 52|LMP-LM|Joe, this is Jack. Do you know where specifically they're seeing the hot spots west of Copernicus?||CC|Jack, I don't have it on the page in front of me here. We're going to check into it and I'll get back to you in a second.||CC|Jack, this is Houston. With regard to your questions on the hot spots, apparently they've not yet||||||Tape 99A/9|||indexed the - these warmer sources that they're detecting to the CSM ephemeris, and - and so they don't know exactly what they correspond to as far as the surface features themselves go. So I can't help you on that right now.||LMP-LM|Okay, Joe. Just curious.|06 04 21 04|CC|And, Jack, TELMU handed me some numbers which I think you will be interested in. From the EVA-2 EMU summary, the elapsed EVA time was 7 hours plus 37 minutes plus 22 seconds for a new outdoor record under international rules. The rest of the sheet looks free from problems in a comforting way. Let's see, average metabolic rates - for you, Geno, 855; and, Jack, you're running at around 920, And that, relative to premission averages of around 850. And you have a grand total EVA time now of l4 hours 49 minutes and 35 seconds.|06 04 22 19|LMP-LM|Very interesting numbers, Joe. Do you have any idea how the metabolic rate compared to yesterday?||CC|Good question. Let me ask on that one. Yesterday you were running at 1045 and 1090. So you're down considerably from your work rates of yesterday, which is good news. Maybe you're learning how to do it more easily or something like that.||CDR-LM|Yes, but we spent a lot of time riding today and a lot of time working yesterday.||CC|That's true. But I guess that's not taken into consideration of the average here. It's certainly true. We can ask for the metabolic rate of the Rover. I bet that is pretty impressive for today.||CDR-LM|Well, don't - don't get me wrong. Driving that Rover is ... But I'll tell you, it keeps your attention.||CC|I'm sure it does.||LMP-LM|It keeps the passenger's attention, too.||||Tape 99A/10||||CC|I'm sure it does. We noted some comments when you were rolling along today - and reading between the lines from time to time.|06 04 23 59|CDR-LM|"Actually, Joe, for good long spans on the run up to station 2, except when we had to pick our way up the Hole-in-the-Wall, I was running full bore at anywheres from, I guess, what'd I say, 10 to 12 to 15 clicks. I didn't hit 15 going up very much.. Coming down I did, but it's - it's really a ""stand by for turn and watch where you're going"" type of run. Because the small craters, - of course, are the ones that can really jolt you. But the trouble is, you can't - you can never see what's just over the next ridge, and the next ridge may be 20 meters away, and you just can't see it until you're there, and you don't know whether its a dish crater or pit crater."||CC|Roger, Gene. We copy that.||LMP-LM|Joe, that des -||CC|Go ahead.||LMP-LM|That description - that description fits the geology up in there, because we weren't seeing blocky rimmed craters and otherwise you would have been able to tell more easily about the old versus new craters, which would be the ones you could either go through or not go through, respectively.||CC|Roger.||CDR-LM|That's a super machine to drive though, Joe, I'll tell you. If you had enough time you could really learn to - to take it all the way. But you don't really do that, just the second time around.||CC|Geno, was it spraying dirt at you today? Could you - did you notice that you still missed the real fender and that the patch fender wasn't quite doing what - what maybe it could?||||||Tape 99A/11||CDR-LM|No, sir, I don't think we missed it at all.||LMP-LM|Fact is, we're recommending a design change, Joe.||CC|That'll be for next year's model.|06 04 26 32|CDR-LM|That's right.|06 04 30 20|LMP-LM|Hey, Joe. Is it all right to use the waste management system?||CC|Roger. We're happy with those demand regs now. And you can proceed on with that and including all the - the - the PLSS recharges that you'll need to do as well.|06 04 33 23|LMP-LM|Joe, we're filling n$r PISS with water now. You might check on the water quantity.|06 04 33 29|CC|Roger. Thank you.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 100A/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|06 04 43 11|CDR-LM|Joe, that should take care of my PLSS for tonight.||CC|Okay, Gene. Thank you. Out of curiosity, have you packed, or are you packing the ETB now?||CDR-LM|Yes. Jack's doing it right now.||CC|Okay; we've got a last minute change. We show that you - your mag Bravo is about 77 frames, and we'd like for you to leave it in the ETB - It is already in the ETB - and take it out with you tomorrow. We can shoot up the remaining frames if we run out of film, otherwise.||CDR-LM|Okay; fine. That goes along with our thinking.||CC|You know, apparently you made some comment earlier in the day about being bothered by comm noise during your egress from Challenger. Did that go away right away, or did it just cease to bother you, or what - what was the story on that?||CDR-LM|I don't remember; so, it must have gone away, because the comm was great.||CC|Okay; that's what we kind of assumed.||CDR-LM|Okay; we're charging Jack's PLSS with oxygen.||CC|Sounds good.|06 04 59 44|CDR-LM|Houston, Challenger. The O2 is complete on - O2 FILL is complete on the LMPs PLSS, and we're working on the water.||CC|Roger.|06 05 02 19|CC|Challenger, for your information, we're coming up on comm handover in about a minute and a half.||CDR-LM|Okay.||||Tape 100A/2|||06 05 07 33|CDR-LM|Hello, Houston; Challenger. The LMPs PLSS is charged.||CC|We copy it.||CDR-LM|Joe, how's the weather got down there? Any better?||CC|Geno, the weather is better. We were really socked in yesterday. That front's moved on through the Houston area, and it is cold and clear tonight, I suspect. It's been a while since we've been out, but they are calling for it to go down right near freezing.||CDR-LM|Okay. Thank you.|06 05 36 12|LMP-LM|Hey, Joe; Challenger.||CC|Go ahead.||LMP-LM|They succeeded in leveling the gravimeter, yet?||CC|Jack, we'll check it, update our information on that, tfy understanding at the moment is that they've not, but - but they're thinking that the unit's just too cold and they're in the process of wanning it up by dumping heat into it by running some of the equipment around it and in it, and they've by no means given up - given up hope for that unit.||LMP-LM|I figure that means that n$r fooling around with it didn't help them.||CC|Apparently, it - it didn't do too much for then, but what it did do was convince them that it's probably somehow locked up because its temperature's not right yet. And they're not worrying about whether it's level or not level now. They're - they're confident that it's been set up okay, and now they're just biding their time to bring that temperature up. We'll get some more wordr. to you sometime tomorrow on it as you make your traditional visit to the site again - ALSEP site again, probably. How are you coining along with your sleep -prep?||||||Tape 100A/3||CDR-LM|We're just about there, Joe. We picked up some time somewhere in here. Couldn't be much more than 1 hour behind.||CC|No, that's just about right. You're looking pretty good on that.||LMP-LM|If you get to sleep in the next 5 minutes, you're 1 hour behind.||CDR-LM|Yes, sir; we're - I'm putting ny hammock up now, as a matter of fact.||LMP-LM|What are you doing up so late?||CC|Well, somebody's got to sit up and keep you guys honest. I think we're getting more sleep down here than you are.||CDR-LM|Ah me.||CC|I might add that not only do we have to stay up late; we have to get up mighty early to keep you honest, too.||LMP-LM|Okay; you going to let us sleep 8 hours or what?||CC|That's affirm, Jack. We're - we're looking good on the time, and we're - Not only will you get, we hope, 8 hours of good sleep, but you'll have a full EVA tomorrow. So,.it's not costing us anything there.||LMP-LM|Sounds great, Joe. I - I fully expect it won't be much longer now.||CC|And, Gene, just for rough planning purposes, we'll start to figure your sleep period starting around 152:30. And we'11 be looking at your getting up around 8 hours from that time.||CDR-LM|Okay, Joe; I'll buy that.||CC|Might add, also, that there are a lot of us looking forward to that third EVA tomorrow. It's going||||Tape 100A/4|||||to be the last one on the lunar surface for some time.||CDR-LM|I tell you, if it's anywhere near what the first two were like, we're looking forward to it, also.||CC|Gene and Jack, we're still marveling at the > i-tiful television pictures that we're getting from your TV camera there. It's fun, in fact, to watch the - the tracks that you're leaving behind in -in the - the lunar soil, both footprints and Rover tracks. And some of us are down here now reflecting on what sort of mark or track will someday disturb the tracks that you leave behind there tomorrow.||CDR-LM|That's an interesting thought, Joe, but I think we all know that somewhere, someday, someone will be here to disturb those tracks.||CC|No doubt about it, Geno.||LMP-LM|Don't be too pessimistic, Joe. I think it's going to happen.||CC|Oh, there's no doubt about that. But it's fun to think about what sort of - of device will ultimately disturb your tracks.||LMP-LM|Well that device may look something like your little boy.||CC|Boy, he'd make short work of them.||LMP-LM|Joe, I'll tell you it's also a pretty philosophical thought to think that you're riding around out here on what is really undisturbed - undisturbed everything, you know. If there was someone here, way back when sometime, they didn't leave much -much sign of their whereabouts, but that's an interesting thought, too, as you drive around and all of a sudden cross your own Rover tracks and figure out those are the only ones that have maybe have ever been here.||CC|Very true.||||||Tape 100A/5||LMP-LM|And with that, I'm rolling out wy hammock.||LMP-LM|Okay, Joe. I'm waving goodnight to you. I'm rolling up my overhead window cover.||CC|Okay, Gene and Jack. We'll say good night to you from down here, unless there's some other way can help you.||LMP-LM|No, sir. If there is, we'll give you a call, though.||CC|Just want to end by saying what a terrific job you did today, and really looking forward to tomorrow. Have a good 8-hours rest.||LMP-LM|Thank you, Joe. Tomorrow we answer all the unanswered questions. Right?|06 05 45 22|CC|If not more.|06 05 46 16|LMP-LM|...|||END OF TAPE||||||Tapes 101A-105A/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|||REST PERIOD - NO COMMUNICATIONS||||||Tape 10IB/I||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|06 08 00 22|CC|Good morning, America.

This is the command module pilot of the United States spaceship America, and we're ready to participate in another day's activity.||CC|Glad to hear it, Ron. Good morning.||CMP|Good morning.||CMP|I slept with my lightweight headset on last night so didn't have to have that cap on. Is the fidelity of this thing any good, at all?||CC|Pretty good, Ron. Pretty good.

Is it about the same when I'm soundly asleep or is it lower or what, you know?||CC|Stand by, Ron, and I'll ask the men on my left.||||Tape 101B/2||||CMP|Okay. You know, maybe they'll have that information.||CC|Roger. They think maybe 5 minutes. And we'll be back to you.|06 08 13 30|CMP|Okay. No problem. Curiosity more than anything.|06 08 14 08|CMP|I didn't get quite as much sleep last night. I took a bath and changed my underwear, and all those good ... things, you know. Probably only got - oh, maybe 7 hours at the most. Probably closer to 6-1/2 of good sleep||CC|Roger.||CMP|I'll give you the rest of that in just a jiffy when I get it squared away.|06 08 l4 38|CC|Okay.|06 08 18 21|CC|America, this is Houston.||CMP|Go ahead.||CC|Roger, Ron. Apparently in your preflight data base they show you with a rate of in the low 60*s or high 50's, that's a sleeping rate. And we're showing you now, during your sleep periods, of heart rates of about 10 beats lower per minute. And with heart rates that show less variation than the preflight data shows.||CMP|Ah ha, okay. Well, thank you much. The heart does slow down a little bit up here, then.||CC|Apparently so - they assured me however, that it would not be approaching zero. So you can relax there.||CMP|(Laughter) Okay.||||||Tape 10IB/3||CC|And, Ron, in the meantime, Gordo's arrived here and - I'll turn the console over to him.

Good morning and go ahead.||CMP|I just got something a day off (laughter). Okay, Gordo. Glad to have you aboard with us. Okay. PRD, 150Ul; and the sleep, I mentioned, probably about 6-1/2 or 7 good hours. I took a Seconal last night, and I had four cans of fluid.||CC|Okay.||CMP|Okay, here's the old chow for day 6.||CC|Okay.||CMP|Scrambled eggs , bacon squares, peaches , cinnamon toasted bread cubes, orange juice, cocoa with potassium and a vitamin pill. Okay. Lobster bisque, all the peanut butter, all the jelly, three pieces of bread, citrus beverage, a tea, a chocolate bar, and a package of pecans. And I had a beef steak, butterscotch pudding, and an orange drink.||CC|Okay, got that.||CMP|I think that was it.

I thought that was great.||CC|Okay, Ron. I just picked it up. Let me read it over and then I'll give you a summary.|06 08 24 33|CMP|Oh, okay. Sure; no problem.|06 08 28 40|CC|Hello, Ron. I'll give you a little summary here of the EVA. It's going to be a little rambling, because I haven't had time to organize it, but it was a very interesting night last night on that second EVA.||CMP|Sure that's ... Go ahead.||CC|Traverse lay over terrain of extraordinary geologic diversity and yielded a far greater variety of information than ever obtained on any other lunar traverse. Systematic descriptions and samples of four of the six main units of the area, massif, subfloor, the light mantle, and the dark mantle were obtained. In addition, detailed descriptions were given of a variety of craters, including exciting discoveries that the crater Shorty, and descriptions of the Lee-Lincoln Scarp and lineaments in the hilly terrain. The South Massif is composed of two main varieties of breccia; blue-gray and tan-gray blocks of both varieties were abundant at station 2 up on Nansen. I won't go into the geologic details on those breccias. But - they then found samples of the subfloor unit exposed as blocks in the ejecta around larger craters that had been partly buried by the dark mantle. Stand by.||||||Tape 10IB/5||CC|Okay. They are going to take the antenna away from us, Ron. I'll have to finish this next time around. Spacecraft's looking good, we'll see you in about 45 minutes or so.|06 08 30 32|CMP|Okay.

First of all, your RCS is hooking right along there 4 percent above the Flight Plan line; however, we have some plans for that 4 percent, which I'll go over with you later. On the oxygen, you've gained a little on it, since I was last on anyway. O2 tank 1 is a little low, but it's balanced by tank 3 being a - a little high, and tank 2 is right on the redline, so I think they all balance out to be about on the redline on the Flight Plan line. And they all three balance out to be right on the Flight Plan line, as close as I can tell. On hydrogen, you're probably up about 4 percent in tank 1, and the other two are right on the line, so you are in good shape there, still.||CMP|Very good.||CC|"Okay, while you're - I've got some words on your -on your orbit here, which won't require anything -writing down anything - but for some reason you're missing the mascons or something, and your orbit's not degrading like we expected it to. It's not degrading down into a circular orbit. It's - I think it's staying just about the way it was, and so we're looking ahead to a plane change, and we're - we're thinking about an extra maneuver prior to plane change - about 1 hour prior to plane change on the back side. There was some discussion here about what to call that maneuver. Somebody wanted to call it a HAM, height adjustment maneuver, and someone else said, well that one's already used in the rendezvous sequence. Maybe we ought to make it ""bacon."" And even ""lox"" was was suggested, considering the FDOs objected to ""bacon"" because of his religion. So the ""lox"" was eliminated because •we already used that for the S-IVB."||||Tape 102B/2||||CMP|"How about ""mascon adjust?"""||CC|Anyway, what the maneuver's going to be - whatever we call it - is about 11 foot per second RCS burn, 1 hour prior to plane change so that'll be on the back side. And, that'll just about use up your RCS overage and put you back on the Flight Plan line. That will adjust the height when you get around to the plane change, and then the plane change will be a little bigger than originally planned, showing about 365 feet per second, SPS, of course. And, looking at the consumables, that will put you down right - right on the rescue red-line on SPS, so we're still in good shape - con-sumablewise. Further tracking will refine this, of course, so we'll have updates on the plan. Any questions on that? Over.|06 09 27 16|CMP|No, it sounds like you all thought it out. I appreciate your letting me know about that. I think - Is the time line worked out good enough in there to work in a P4l? I guess it does - an hour before, huh?||CC|Yes, well - we'll make it. I haven't looked at it myself, but we are - FAO has - and I haven't heard exactly what needs to be changed, if anything. Okay, on the SIM bay. Basically there's nothing new to report. And all the people down here appreciate your timely operation of the SIM bay, and it's responsible for really maximizing the data return. In general, we're pretty happy. The problems that we're have - having with it are ones that have already been mentioned to you. On the - on the HF antenna retract problem that we have, if we have it, here's the plan. We're -Well, first of all, the consensus on that is that we really think the antennas are retracting okay. That it's a malfunction in the limit switch that drives the talkback that's really the problem. So we have devised an alternate method, utilizing timing and stall current, and actually the signature of the motor stall current down here in the data, to determine proper retraction. And just prior to 168 hours in the Flight Plan, you're supposed to retract those antennas, and we're going to check the data at that time, and say||||||Tape 102B/3|||"""yes"" or ""no""; they are retracting or they aren't. If they don't, then the alternate plan we'll swing into at that time is to reschedule the HF targets that are now scheduled on rev 55* Reschedule them and do them on rev 42. After which, we'll try one more time to retract the antennas, and if it still looks like they indeed are not retracting - I guess it's just the one that's in question - then we'll go ahead and jettison them at that time. And we'll still have gotten most of the - of the least -priority HF targets with that alternate plan. Over."|06 09 29 45|CMP|Yes, that sounds like - sounds like a good plan to me.||CC|Okay, we got one request from EECOM here. Can you turn the tank 2 FANs, OFF, please?|06 09 30 04|CMP|H2 tank 2 FANs are OFF now.||CC|Okay. And when you get between courses on breakfast there, I have some pencil work for you in the way of Flight Plan updates. Not too much, really.||CMP|Okay. Contrary to the way I eat breakfast on the ground, I always end up leaving my orange juice to last. I guess that's because you like to eat the hot things first.||CC|Roger.||CMP|What I'm saying is the only thing I've got left to eat is orange juice, and I'm ready to copy.||CC|Okay, 156:22 - which is coming up here - like to, at that time, verify all command module VHP off. You are now 11 after - You have to terminate the jet-on monitor and then get the sounder operating. I can break this off at any time if you think we're pressing that. Just interrupt me. At 156:50* lunar sounder pad. T-start is 156:51:05, and T-spot is 156:56:09* Over.||CMP|Okay. T-start, 156:51:05, 156:56:09-||CC|That's good. Flip the page - flip two pages and copy the next sounder pad, which is for 158:40. T-start is 158:49:35 and stop time is 158 - -||||Tape 102B/4||||CMP|Wait a minute; wait a minute. I'm not with you.||CC|Okay.||CMP|Okay. I got it (chuckle).||CC|Okay. T-start - -||CMP|Go ahead, now, very sorry.||CC|- - 158:49:35, and stop is 158:54:38.||CMP|Okay. Start 158:49:35, 158:54:38.||CC|"Okay, that's correct. Now at - that same page -158:13, after ""PAN CAMERA - ON,"" add a line that says, ""V/H OVERRIDE - HIGH ALTITUDE."""||CMP|"Okay, at 158:13, ""V/H OVERRIDE to HIGH ALTITUDE."""||CC|Okay, and at 158 - -||CMP|I think it's still in HIGH ALTITUDE from yesterday. Yes, it is.||CC|"Okay. 158:21 is another, ""Verify all command module VHF, OFF."""||CMP|"Okay, 158:21, ""Verify all VHF, OFF,"" and I know what that means."||CC|"Okay, and the next two are easy. Next page, at 159:01- Just draw a line through ""MAPPING CAMERA, RETRACT,"" and at 159:05 - -"||CMP|Okay, I got it.||CC|"- - draw a line through ""MAPPING CAMERA LASER ALTIM - LASER ALTIMETER COVER, CLOSED."""||CMP|Okay, got it.||CC|Okay, I think we're caught up. We're ready for HIGH GAIN, AUTO.|06 09 34 28|CMP|Okay, I'll go back and see where we are in the old Flight Plan. Okay, you have AUTO.||||||Tape 102B/5||CC|Okay.||CMP|Okay. I don't think this lightweight headset is quite as good as the - the other one, and I'm going to change as soon as I get a chance here.||CC|Okay.|06 09 35 06|CMP|Okay, VHF A is OFF, B is OFF, RECEIVE ONLY, B DATA is OFF, BEACON is OFF, RANGING is OFF. That's all (chuckle).||CC|Okay.||CMP|I was looking at - Aitken when they came that side. Aitken is almost right in the terminator, right now. So when they come up on terminator photos there - The only thing is that, even though it was down in the shadow, down in the bottom of the crater, I could still see the bottom of the craters on - when they come around there for the nearterminator photography. I'm going to open the camera up and take a picture down in the shadow itself and see if that works.||CC|Okeydoke.||CMP|And there was quite a bit of backlight - quite a bit of backlight reflection from the northeastern side of it and also the eastern side of it, I guess. Funny, down in the eastern rim - -||CC|Ron, if you give us ACCEPT, we111 give you a vector while you got it.|06 09 36 29|CMP|- - the only way I can describe it - Okay. You have ACCEPT.||CC|Roger.||CMP|And the DSKY is clear. With the shadow effect on the eastern - I guess the east and southeastern interior rim of the crater, it reminds me a lot of some eroded hills. Like if you've got a valley||||Tape 102B/6|||||that maybe has a 20-foot - it's bigger than that -but say you got a 20-foot drop on the thing where it's been - just rain erosion down the side and it kind of washes little - little valleys down it here and there. And it leaves mounds and humps in between that haven't eroded away yet. And that's the way the side of that crater works. And then the other side of it, the northeastern rim of it and the interior rim, looks just like a - a - one of the massif units. That is, it's a very fine texture, no real erosional processes, just a smooth, gentle -gentle slope.||CC|Roger.||CC|Okay, Ron; it's your computer. Go gack to BLOCK.|06 09 38 17|CMP|Okay, we're in BLOCK.||CMP|You know that Skylab drink bag has really been a pretty good deal because you can use the nipple that's on the end of that thing and use it for all of the beverage packages. And that way, you don't have to cup open the end of it and let it drip out all over the place.||CC|Hey, I'11 pass that along to the Skylab - -||CMP|- - you can use the nipple.||CMP|I'm not sure if they have any of our beverage packs or not. I think they are all packaged in these expandable little things we're using for water -water cans.||CC|I see.||CMP|Hey, Gordo, what day is it?||CC|Out of sync there myself. It's Wednesday. It's about 9:15 in the morning, Wednesday.||CMP|Ah haI Thank you. I guess I could have figured it - up, but -||CC|That's why we're here. Answer important questions.||||||Tape 102B/7||CMP|(Laughter) That1s right.|06 09 42 54|CMP|"Hey, getting ready for LUNAR SOUNDER to STANDBY. That's a ""verify."""||CC|Roger.|06 09 43 14|CMP|And RECORDER is - RADAR is ON. RECORDER is OFF, not heaters. I see the old MODE is still in VHF. Ah ha! I get to control the spacecraft again. Takes about five minimum impulse blips to get -a tenth of a degree per second.||CC|Roger.|06 09 48 17|CMP|The dark annulus around Serenitatis - As you look north - the dark variation there, and I'm kind of looking back - looking a little bit backwards now -but that dark has no continuity with the ridge at all. Goes right down the middle of the ridges. As you look directly east of Littrow - east - I mean directly west of Littrow, the wrinkle ridge is there, and then there's - it comes out, and you have the light tan, tannish, tannish -. There's a dark, I guess you call it - a dark tannish-gray. And then you get out to the light tan of the Mare Serenitatis, itself.||CC|Okay, Ron.|06 09 53 09|CMP|You know, I'm looking almost directly into the Sun and you can still see a topographic expression -topographic high around the rilles in the Tacquet area, and also the grayness has disappeared out of that - out of the dark material, and it's just -looking into the Sun now - it looks more of a tan -a darker tan than the Serenitatis area. And you can all see - also see the topographic rise to it now - I'm looking quite a ways away from it and looking down on it.||CC|Roger.|06 09 54 23|CMP|You know, that's kind of funny now, looking back at Sulpicius Gallus and just to the north of that,||||Tape 102B/8|||||there's a crater that's about - well, it's right at the end of those rilles that go north from Sulpicius Gallus. And you can really see the ejecta blanket. The ejecta blanket looks very dark, around it now in this Sun. Now you look out across the Mare Serenitatis now and you're getting toward the sunset, looking back into the Sun, and the color is disappearing all except in that one spot. Now that must be a - either a fresh ejecta - and you look the brightness of it or something - or either that or it's dark. It1s sure a dark - it's a dark ejecta blanket around it. The blanket itself goes out maybe two or three crater diameters, and it looks like it has kind of a ray-type pattern to it. I'll mark that crater. I don't even know if it has got a name or not, but I'll mark it on my map.||CC|Okay.||CMP|I got a ding. Let's see. It must be time to do something.||CC|Yes, it's time to turn the recorder on.|06 09 55 43|CMP|RECORDER, ON. RECORDER'S ON.||CC|Okay.|06 09 57 04|CMP|Just - I don't know where I am right now, I'll be honest. I just looked out window 3, and I'm right on the terminator. And, let's see, I'm going west, so we've got some arcuate - There's kind of a mare area down there. Okay, I think it is. And you.can see lava tongues sticking out through there. And lava flow fronts with the high side on the east side because you got a shadow all the way along the front. And they're about - in the one area - you might consider a scalloped area -an ejecta scallop. Coming out of that one area you can see a crazy lava flow coming out from it.||CC|Roger on that.||CMP|At least the flow -||CMP|Hey, those are Apennines I'm just going over, aren't they?||||||Tape 102B/9||CC|That's right. That's what they ought to be. We need the IR, OFF.||CMP|You look back out across Seren - Okay.||CC|We need the IR COVER, CLOSED, please.||CMP|Say again, Gordo.||CC|We want the IR COVER, CLOSED. Right away.|06 09 59 34|CMP|Okay, it's going CLOSED. Okay, it's CLOSED. How about the UV?||CMP|IR COVER is CLOSED.||CMP|I was just going to say, looking back across Serenitatis into the Sun now, there must be Bessel that has ejecta pattern out there. When you look at the ejecta patterns into the Sun, they all look black with respect to the mare. I think it must be a shadow effect or something that you get off of the - the raised ejecta that comes up across it.||CC|Roger.|06 10 02 4l|CC|Hey, Ron, that frantic call there was because the Sun had started to get in the IR and hadn't really thought that would happen, but started to see it get in there. But you caught it in time; the cover saved it.||CMP|Okay. Real good. I figured that's probably what it was.||CC|And you can go ahead with the rest of the steps in there with the UV off after sunset.|06 10 03 21|CMP|Okay. MAPPING CAMERA is going OFF. COVER'S CLOSED on the IR so then we'll turn it off. PAN CAMERA, SELF TEST, OFF. And let's see, I don't see the Sun shining up a light out there. It must be sunset. Couldn't be yet, though. Yes, sure enough is, though. Okay, UV's going OFF. You want the IR COVERs back OPEN just to keep things straight here?||||Tape 102B/10||||CC|Stand by on that.||CMP|They're just - I - next time we use the IR, let's just remember to open the cover.||CC|Okay. Just open it up the next time we use It, which is in about 15 minutes. We'll we'll remind you on that if you forget.||CMP|Oh, okay. That's right. Okay. That's right, these are just short sounder passes now, aren't they?||CC|That's right.||CC|Ron, I can finish up my description of the last night's EVA if you like since nothing to look at now. I'm watching the clock on the sounder start for you.||CMP|Okay; hey, appreciate it.|06 10 06 01|CC|Okay, think I left off, or was cut off there without mentioning two varieties of breccia in the South Massif. They found blue-gray and tan-gray and, without going into the geological details, those are the two types they found up there at Nansen. The subfloor unit was exposed as blocks and ejecta around larger craters had been partly buried by dark mantle. And craters apparently had penetrated thin parts of the light mantle. Especially good samples were obtained from the rim of Camelot where the same textural characteristics which are banding caused by variations in vesicle concentration, coarse-grain size, and mineralogic features, as reported in EVA-1, were found. So apparently this unit is quite uniform over the distances that they have covered so far in the traverses. The prominent east-facing scarp, crossing the valley floor from north to south about 5 kilometers west of the LM, was traversed twice near the crater Lara, near Hole-in-the-Wall, al-although Hole-in-the-Wall appeared to be pretty subtle. No change in the surface characteristics or lithology of the mantle was discernible where the astronauts traversed the Scarp. Outcrops of||||||Tape 102B/11|||"boulders were observed farther to the north where the northward extension of the Scarp crosses the face of the North Massif, it forms a notably smooth and relatively young-appearing surface. Elsewhere, the surface of the North Massif is prominently furrowed and textured, and the crew described it as a cross-hatched pattern on the surface that they could see with one set of lineaments dipping eastward and the other westward at about 30 degrees. Some of the most interesting observations made during the EVA were related to craters. Many small craters within the dark mantle have glass-coated central pits. Jack called them dimples. Some of the pits are nearly cylindrical and maybe half again as deep as the crater itself. Other small craters occurring in both the dark and light mantle have bright halos, but these halos appear to be noticeably brighter on the light-colored material. This bright material is not blocky or fragmental ejecta derived from a subfloor layer, but rather appears to consist of ""instant rock"" or soil breccia which has been partly consolidated by the impact shock itself. The most interesting eureka during the EVA was at station 4, Shorty Crater, where Jack found some bright red or orange, he described it, orange dirt within the gray to dark-gray rim material. The colored banding is circumferential to the crater and resembled alteration halos, which occur around many terrestrial volcanic vents. So you can see why the geologists are excited on that one. The morphology of Shorty, however, is similar in some respects - -"|06 10 09 20|CMP|You bet you.||CC|- - impact craters have definitive interpretation of its origin may depend on sample analysis. And I got about a .minute and a half to start the sounder. It might be close to 02:30 there, if you aren't. They took a total of about 850 pictures. They've taken a total of 1270, would you believe, pictures ... on the lunar surface. Including about 150 with the 500-millimeter camera mostly of the North, South, East Massifs, and Family Mountain. They got 56 samples, two double cores, probably about 36 kilograms worth, and they traveled a total distance of 20 kilometers. Over.||||Tape 102B/12||||CMP|Hey, sounds like a good summary. They're finding all kinds of things up there. Which is the reason you explor, I guess, to find - to see what you can find.||CC|Yes, they - they were really in their element last night. About 30 seconds to T-start time. 1*11 let you call it yourself, though.||CMP|Okay. I'll get it.|06 10 11 04|CMP|DATA SYSTEMS are OFF. OPERATE, 05.||CC|Okay.||CMP|Hope this thing's in Reiner Gamma. Then you can find some sort of a topographic expression, to that light-colored material around there. It looks to me like there is - right around the Reiner Gamma itself anyhow.||CC|Roger.||CMP|Maybe the lunar sounder will collaborate my moonlight investigations here - or earthlight investigations, I'm sorry.||CC|(Laughter)||CMP|While we're waiting here - I decided to sleep last night without being tied down or anything. So I slept in the old - What do you call them in the Navy? -||CC|Hammocks, I think.||CMP|Well, anyhow, sleeper strings, we call them up here. Yes, sleeping bags - or some kind of sack. And the last 2 or 3 nights, what I'd do is put the lap belt on loosely. And you know, it just kind of keeps you from rolling all over the cockpit. Then last night, I didn't put it on at all and stayed in the sack. And I really didn't go too far anyhow. One time I woke up and I was crossways in the couch up here. And then when I woke up this||||||Tape 102B/13|||"morning my feet were up in the tunnel, and my head was kind of still in the center couch, more or less. So you really don't roam around too much that way anyhow, even if you aren't tied down. And you can get the ""huggy pillow"" effect by being inside that sack and laying your head on the outside of the sack. It just about fits me, except that if I stretch my feet out - then I get a little bit of a pull. Little bit of a pull - on it and it feels like a huggy pillow that way."||CC|Kind of a security blanket effect, huh?||CMP|(Laughter) Yes, right. That was the biggest problem the first 2 or 3 days here - what do you do with your head when you go to sleep. I'm used to sleeping with a pillow. And I'm used to sleeping on my side. And it's amazing the psychological effect that you can get from - for me it's hard to go to sleep just laying on my back. So you can -turn on your side and you go right to sleep (laughter). What's your side and what's your back - I don't know, but anyhow, it works.||CC|That's got to be psychological.|06 10 16 57|CMP|(Laughter) It sure is.||CMP|5, 6, 7, 8 -|06 10 16 12|CMP|MARK it.

I get to mess with the old optics again.||||Tape 102B/14||||CC|We're getting some of that, Ron. Sounds like the mike might have slipped away from your mouth, though.||CMP|Okay. That's a good point - let me change my headsets here. Anyway, I went right through the Flight Plan with all that stuff.||CC|Okay, and - -||CMP|... left the IR COVER, OPEN.||CC|Okay. Great memory there.||CC|Ron, if you like while you're getting ready for the 52, I can summarize the news real rapidly. There wasn't a whole lot.||CMP|Okay. Sure, go ahead, I've got a different headset now. Is that okay?||CC|Yes, you're loud and clear. Former President Truman is still hanging in there. His heartbeat and breathing became unstable yesterday, but then improved again. Of course, the big headlines were about the discovery of the orange dirt at Shorty Crater. And there was a picture of Jan, John, and Jaime in the paper, watching the EVA on TV. The only thing new on the peace talks is that Kissinger will probably be coming back to the United States today and there's a rumor, the French press said that the compromise is in the work on the withdrawal of the North Vietnamese troops from the south. The Rockets lost - the Aeros, the hockey team, won last night. They beat the Alberta Oilers. The Rockets lost to Buffalo. And the weather finally cleared out. The cold front cleared out the wet stuff and last night I think was the first time since you guys launched that we've had a look at the Moon, so we had a direct look at you last night. It's just nice and sunny here, this morning when I came to work. Over.||CMP|Hey, thanks for the news and I guess those three guys that went up to the Moon - you know, they probably cleared that weather up there in Houston.||||||Tape 102B/15||CC|It sure took you awhile though.||CMP|(Laught er) Right.|06 10 24 31|CMP|Okay, 14 is Canopus again, the same ones I had last night I think. That's Canopus. Canopus looks about as bright as Sirius, but not quite.||CC|Roger.||CMP|My sextant - is good and everything like that, but you just can't quite get the reticle in focus.||CC|Roger.||CMP|It1s kind of the way they said it was going to be.||CC|Okay, Ron. We copy those. Clear to torque them.|06 10 26 l4|CMP|Okay, let's see; we'll torque at - oh, make it 06:30.||CC|All righty.||CC|Ron, we've still got about 5 or 6 minutes until LOS, but in case we drop off on your maneuvering there - just want to tell you that everything's looking good. In fact, the IR is pumping out good data, so with that fantastic teamwork, we saved it back there, and we'll see you next time around.|06 10 27 24|CMP|Hey, okay. Sounds good, there's little old Aldebaran in there.

I'll bet that's a little micro-meteorite pit in window 3. Right in the middle of it. It looks like two of them out there. It's about - much smaller than a 1/32 - 1/64 - 1/64 in diameter probably.||CC|Got cha.||CMP|It's a little, round - Doesn't seem to have any -It's just a pit, you know.||CC|Ron, you said that was window 3?||CMP|Window 3, yes.||CC|Okay.|06 11 45 54|CMP|Oh, it scared me for a minute there. I was configuring for terminator photos, and I looked on the near-side terminator, and I didn't see any. It's on the far side.||CC|Yes, Stu and I were looking at the same thing. We're just about a - 30 seconds ahead of you.||CMP|(Laughter) Okay. One's of Aitkin on the far side. Okay. Aitken and Ibn Hyan [sic], I think, or something like that. Debber [?], Ibn Hyan [sic].||||Tape 103B/4||||CMP|Yes. You know, going to come across - come across the Tacquet area again, and there doesn't seem to be any - it - there's a bright crater - a recent crater in the annulus - in that dark annulus, in the southern part of Serenitatis, it shows up again as that kind of a blue-gray brightness, as opposed - as opposed to the tannish - tannish brightness of the - of the bright craters in Serenitatis. There's still is no apparent wrinkle ridge - there's no color tone or differentiation in the winkle-ridge area, in this part of it. The only differentiation, and - It looks like south of Tacquet you get the same color tone variation occurs on over into Tranquillitatis. When you get to the Tacquet area, from Tacquet up to Miller or something - I wish I could remember the name of that crazy crater.||CC|How about Menelaus.|06 11 49 31|CMP|Menelaus. That's it. Yes. From Tacquet up to Menelaus now, the - that's got to be a buildup of material and it's more on the tan side than it is on the - more of a dark tan than it is to the tannish-gray. So it's a different type of material than - than on the annulus down below the crater, Tacquet.||CC|Okay, Ron. You're saying this is sort of a annular plateau, then, that stretches across between Tacquet and Menelaus?||CMP|Yes, it is. It's an annular plateau in there, and the plateau is got to have been coming from those rilles down - that are down in there.||CC|Okay, do those - Maybe you've already said this -do those wrinkle ridges cross the color boundaries?||CMP|No, I can't find the wrinkle ridge that crosses the color boundary. The wrinkle ridges are out in Serenitatis itself, and there is no color boundary on the western edge of Serenitatis. It's all the same.||CC|Okay. Those sound like supergood observations, Ron.||||||Tape 103B/5||CMP|Passing over - Sulpic - and - I'm just passing over Sulpicius Gallus, now. And just beyond Sulpicius Gallus - Sulpicius Gallus is out in the Mare Tranquillitatis, itself, and it looks like you could - it's either a talus slope - you know, you got a gentle slope of the - of the massif coming down and then it changes slope a little bit, and the - it looks like you have finer-grained material. And that might be what we have at one time or another called the high-water mark, but I kind of believe that's just a talus change in the slope. As you..go on down there in the fine-grained material, somehow developing down there in the bottom. But as soon as you cross that area -we're going west now from Sulpicius Gallus - again we've got kind of the same tannish - a dark tan material that essentially covers the highland -this highland-type of an area here. It's a hummocky-type material. There are a few rilles just north of Sulpicius Gallus; those rilles, again, have -have the dark tan material on it. About the same as the tan - same color tones that you pick up from Tacquet to Mele - Meleneis [sic].|06 11 51 54|CC|Okay sounds great. Keep talking, we'll cue you as the Flight Plan events come up.||CMP|Okay. D - D-Caldera is sure fascinating. I'll try and take a quick look with the binocs on that one. *** binoc and I can't find it there. There it is.||CMP|"I hope the pictures will kind of confirm a little bit of a - of a topographic rise around the D-Caldera, just a slight one, and it's about half the width of the - if you - As you look at the ""D,” it's a half a width of the ""D,"" not the height, but the width. And it seems to be a raised, kind of a raised, flat rim around it. The color of the raised bumps down in the D-Caldera are the same as the surrounding material, around there. The de - the bumps that are raised up are smooth looking and the depression for it has to be a caldera, I guess, or at least, the part of the depression, anyhow, is a light bluish gray; I'll call it that way, very light bluish gray."||||Tape 103B/6|||06 11 54 14|CC|Hey, Ron I'm not suggesting you do, because it's probably trouble to find. Have you tried the color wheel, comparing it on any of this stuff?||CMP|(Laughter) No, I haven't. Let me try. That's a good idea, though. I'll try that and see what I can come up with on that thing.||CC|Well, don't don't go to a lot of trouble. I never got around to it, but you might - you might peg down some of these colors a little better. Particularly when you were talking last night about -on the back side - -||CMP|That's a good point.||CC|On one of those passes about the green.||CMP|Yes.||CC|Okay, you're about 7 seconds away from where we're wanting the recorder on, Ron.

I may not be light adapted.||CMP|Sure is ...||CMP|I was trying to think if there was anything I could add to the Reiner Gamma observation there. I'm right over that - the light albedo of that type of material that goes perpendicular between Reiner and Reiner Gamma. It's kind of a crooked type - Well, you know, it goes for a little ways, and then it breaks off into a dark-albedo-type stuff; and then breaks off in another direction a little bit. So, it doesn't look like a straight ray at all.|06 12 12 26|CC|Roger.||CMP|You know - you can see crater holes, and this type of thing. You look right down on Reiner now, you've sure got that dark annulus - the lighter-albedo-type stuff is essentially in the middle of it. And the annulus is - let's see, maybe 30 kilometers wide by twice as long - that's a relative size, anyhow - by twice as long, and that's the dark area. And then around that, the light albedo stuff is about half of the width, and it's lighter on the outside than it is on the inside. The inside is not quite as light as the - I'd call it the rim, I guess. It's very hard to see any - -||CC|Okay.||||Tape 104B/2||||CMP|- - great, great, great topographic expression to it, though. The reason I say that is because it kind of blends in with everything, whereas if you look at a crater out here in the middle of the mare or a hill, you get a brighter - part of it's brighter than the surrounding territory. You can actually see the demarcation. So that's the way you get your depth perception out of it.||CC|Okay, about 30 seconds now until T-stop.||CMP|Okay.

Going from Posidonius on around to the north side of Serenitatis. Of course, it's a long ways away, and I really can't see, but I couldn't tell a definite demarcation. It just kind of blended in from the tan to - to the dark tan.||CC|Oh, Roger.|06 13 50 42|CMP|Yes. Bessel is the one crater that really shows up out there.

When you come around AOS on this next pass, they'll be - White Sands will be standing by in a countdown on an Aero -Aerobee rocket for UV calibration shot, and if that one doesn't go, they've got one for tomorrow, same way.||CMP|Very good. Yes, I hope this one works.||CC|Roger, We need the calibration data.|06 14 18 19|CMP|Right.|06 14 24 25|CMP|Is it starting to look pretty good on your high gain antenna scale down there - to switched to high gain yet?||||||Tape 105/11||CC|That's your cue, Ron. What - what you think on the high gain meter ...||CMP|Oh, okay.||CC|You're at that time in the Flight Plan where you should be able to get it and we should be able to get our PCM data.||CMP|All right.||CC|Sounds like you've got it.||CMP|Okay. Worked like a charm.||CC|Roger. Boy, it sure does quiet down as soon as you get it in there.||CMP|(Laughter) It does, doesn't it?||CC|I sure hope I'm as clear to you as you are to us.

The Gold Team Flight Director picked out the morning's selection, and he said that if can find some maroon dirt, today, instead of orange, you'll probably get a lot more cooperation out of him.||CDR-LM|I figured the Gold Team might do that. You know, I've woke up to a lot of pleasant thoughts, but never to an Aggie before.||CDR-LM|Hey, Gordo, don’t forget I’m a gold - I’m a Boilermaker.||CC|Roger.||CDR-LM|I feel like one right now. Tell the Gold Team Flight Director we'll find about - just about anything he wants today.||CC|Okay; I111 do that. The Challenger looks as good as ever. No problems at all through the night.||CDR-LM|That's outstanding. How's America?||CC|It's in the same shape. Just clicking along. Ron's been up for a few hours now and really gathering up the data.||CDR-LM|Outstanding, Gordo,||CC|Challenger, the name of the game today is to stay with the - the EVA prep time line. We're not going to talk much to you - We'd like - except to bug you a little and stay on your back to keep with the time line, if at all possible - We'd like to get out on time. Over.||||Tape 106A/2||||CDR-LM|Okay, Gordo. That's been our motive all along, and we will stay with it. As of right now, -we're 1 hour behind. Is that correct?||CC|That's affinnative. Although, if you stay on the normal time line, that's fine with us. We don't need to gain any, but we just don't want to lose any - from where we're starting now.||CDR-LM|Yes. Understand. Understand.||LMP-LM|Good. How are you this morning?|06 13 54 52|CDR-LM|Houston, Challenger.||CC|Go ahead, Challenger.||CDR-LM|Okay, Gordy. Crew status is good, in case you hadn't noticed. And again I'm not going to - We haven't kept an itemized accounting of the food -burning up blanks on the paper to do that. But we have ate - have eaten, pardon me - We have eaten just about everything in the various meals. I guess the shrimp was the only thing we didn't really eat. And we've been drinking a lot of water and all the juices and tea and stuff, so I think we're in pretty good shape there. The commander had a Seconal last night, and he slept 3 good and 3 intermittent hours. LMP had no medication and had 6 good hours of sleep. If you've got some lift-off time data, well, I'll copy it.||CC|That's affirm. Okay; start with - for rev 38. Time is 162:22:52. Rev 39 is 164:21:24; 166:19:55; 168:18:27; 170:16:59; 172:15:31. That should have been rev 43, and read back starting with rev 38.||CDR-LM|Okay; rev 38: 162:22:52; 164:21:24; 166:19:55; 168:18:27; 170:16:59; 172:15:31. And what is our present rev?||||||Tape 106A/3||CC|That's a good question. Let's see here. We're working on rev 37. Ron just went by 10 minutes ago on rev 37.||CDR-LM|Okay.|06 14 01 32|CDR-LM|Gordy, we're pressing on, but if you've got any good words, like news and what have you, where we are, we'd appreciate it.||CC|"Okay. There hasn't been a lot of news, but I'll read you what we've got. President - former President Truman is still holding on. His heartbeat, breathing, and temperature all became unstable yesterday, but then he improved again. A Methodist minister in Kansas City said, ""He's a rugged guy who's hanging in there and he's going to make it."" The headlines were full of reports of the find of orange dirt and the rest of your adventures yesterday. Internationally, the U.S. and North Vietnam held intensified secret peace talks, and Henry Kissinger prepared to return to Washington probably this afternoon, I understand, after a final session with Le Due Tho. The French press said a compromise was in the works on the withdrawal of North Vietnamese troops from the South. The Houston Rockets lost to Buffalo up in Buffalo last night, but the hockey team, the Aeros, took a 6 to 4 win over the Alberta Oilers. In -Really, that's about it on the news, except maybe for the weather, which finally broke. The cold front cleared out the drizzly rain last night, and for the first time since you've launched -that I can remember anyway - we've been able to look up and see the Moon, directly. It's a pretty sight as always. That's not much of a report, but that's about all we have. Over."||CDR-LM|Okay; thank you. What's the date today?||CC|It's Wednesday - let's see - Wednesday, the 13th of December.||CDR-LM|Thank you.||CC|Right now, it's about 01:35 in the afternoon.||||Tape 106A/4||||CDR-LM|Okay; just take a quick peek up there. I can't really see too much of the North American continent. South America looks pretty good. And it might be my eyeballs rather than the - the clouds up there, but it looks like most of the clouds are up into the north-central part of the southwestern or southeastern United States.||CC|I have a satellite picture here, and that's about the way it looks.||CDR-LM|Well, it's sunny and pleasant on the valley of Taurus-Littrow. And, Gordo, what is our Sun angle going out today?||CC|I'll get you an answer on that. Couple of questions. First of all, the Surgeon would like a biomed rate. And they were wondering how your hands feel this morning?||CDR-LM|Hands are in good shape, Gordo. No problem.||CC|Okay; that sounds good. Sun is getting up there about 33 degrees now.|06 l4 06 22|CDR-LM|Okay; we'll go a mild midleft, and both PLSSs air have been topped off.||CDR-LM|Gordy, the LMP isn't hooked up right now. He will be shortly. So stand by on the biomed.||CC|Okay. Okay; I have a few words on the command module trajectory that might be of interest, although it doesn't affect your procedures any.||CDR-LM|Go ahead.||CC|Okay. The com - the command module orbit somehow is missing all the mascons. It's not de -degrading into a circular like we thought it would. It's just staying where it was, about a 70 by 50. And so what we're planning on is an extra little maneuver about 1 hour prior to the normal plane change, which will lower the command module altitude at the plane change mode to -to 60. This will be about a 11-feet-per-second||||||Tape 1Q6A/5|06 14 08 38|CDR-LM|RCS burn. And then Ron will do the plane change at the normal time, but it'll be little bigger than - that we had planned. I think the last half was about 365 feet per second for plane change. And we've checked the consumables. That puts the RCS right on the preflight line. He's been running about 4 or 5 percent above it. That will use up that pad there, put him back to nor - nominal on RCS, and on the SPS, that puts you right down on the CSM rescue redline; so, really no problem. In good shape, consumablewise. Over. Okay. Sounds like a good rendezvous posture.|06 14 41 31|LMP-LM|Okay, Houston. You got any updates to the EVA cuff checklist? .||CC|No, I don't think there is, Jack. Although I do have a wri - write-in for the Lunar Surface Checklist, and one that you really don't need to write in on the prep card. Over.||LMP-LM|Go ahead.||CC|"Okay. Page 5-10 on the Lunar Surface Checklist. The reason for this change is to prevent cabin pressure from increasing. It got up to 5-7 yesterday. And it also - will also prevent water sep spindown like happened yesterday, if you happen to have the hose - the return hose blocked against the wall outlet there. The change is to write in on the upper left corner of 5-10, just prior to ""SUIT ISOL, ACTUATOR OVERRIDE (SUIT DISCONNECT)."" Write in ""PRESSURE REGS A and B to EGRESS."" And then down five lines, where it says ""CABIN GAS RETURN, EGRESS,"" change it to ""CABIN GAS RETURN, AUTO."" Verify. Over."||LMP-LM|"Okay, Gordy. At the top of the page, ""REGS A and B to EGRESS,"" and then five lines down, ""CABIN GAS, RETURN, AUTO. Verify."""||CC|That's right. And the only other change I have is - has to do with matching - just like yesterday, - matching the purge valve to the OPS to||||Tape 106A/6|||||maximize the OPS capability. And we can just call you when you get to that point. It's - Or if you want to write it down, you need 211, and Geno needs 208.||LMP-LM|Okay. We1ve got that.||CC|Okay. That's all.||LMP-LM|Okay, Gordy. I guess we play the cuff checklist just as planned, with the exception of the bag numbers which have changed, the collection bag numbers. I have more or less repaired the -sample bag holder on my camera. It's taped on there pretty well with good tape, believe it or not, off the fruit bag. I - I don't know that we have any other outstanding hardware problems. I think in terms of sampling, Gene and I will try|||to shift the emphasis in the mantle area to fragments that are different from the gabbros that we've sampled fairly well, I think, up to now, that presumably are subfloor materials. You might pass that word on and see if they agree with us.||CC|Okay, Jack. We copy that. And, Jack, if you guys are at a convenient place, sit and listen while you're doing some of your stuff. Let me read up the planning for EVA 3 and the summary of what we think we have so far.||LMP-LM|Go ahead.|06 14 45 26|CC|"Okay. I'll read here from this thing just verbatim. It says, ""EVA 3 continues to follow essentially the nominal premission plan. Main objectives continue to be the North Massif; station 6, J; Sculptured Hills; and Van Serg Crater. In view of the extensive observations of the dark mantle and main - and plains subfloor unit on EVA 1 and 2, particularly there before station 5, the relatively - the relative priority of station 10 is reduced, so that station 10 becomes a flexible station as time allotment is a reserve, possibly providing more time at the earlier station, if desired. However, mantle and"||||||Tape 106A/7|||"block sampling at station 10 are still important objectives. Block pack constraints are not nearly as tight as they were yesterday, guys, and so we can be more flexible in reshuffling station times if we need. We probably won't be coming up against option walkbacks like we did at station 4. Closeout time at the LM has been increased by 20 minutes to make the closeout less rushed and to allow for potential ALSEP troubleshooting. It is currently planned to take this time from station 6, 7*"""|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 106B/1||APOLLO|IT AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|06 15 IT 28|CC|America, Houston.

What are you looking at again, Ron?||||Tape 106B/2|||06 15 22 31|CMP|These are the swirls looking off across the -Marginis toward Lomonosov and - let's see, what's that other sea? Big - big crater Just to the northwest of the Neper?||CC|Okay, let me look at it here.||CMP|About the same size as Neper.||CC|I got a poor map, Ron. All I show is - next to Neper, you have the Border Sea which is northwest of Neper, called the Border Sea. I don't know if that's the proper term you want or not.||CMP|Yes, that's - that's - that's what I mean. I think that's - Mare Marginis is a round one up there. I think that's what it is.||CC|Yes, I think so, too. I - Soon as I get ahold of - -||CMP|And in that case - Yes, my map doesn't go up that way, either, so - or the one I have out.||CC|Okay.

But in the case of Marginis - there's a brand new crater just in the northeast quarter of it - I mean northwest quarter.||CC|Okay. Brand new car - crater in the ... Marginis.||CMP|It almost looks like that - in the northwest quarter of Marginis, and it's about - let's see, I'm gy.essing - 100-kilometer size, probably.||CC|Okay. We copy that - -||||||Tape 106B/3||CMP|Hey, no, 50-kilometer size.||CC|Roger. You've never seen that before on any of the maps?||CMP|But you know, it's - that - Well, no. I've got to look on the map. I'm sure it's there, because that's what's causing all the swirls going across Marginis.||CC|Okay, do you see a color-texture difference between the swirls across Marginis there?||CMP|Yes, the color - the texture is hard to - you just can't get any texture out of it. There's a dark -a dark gray. And then the swirls seem to be around this dark gray - the dark gray areas. The swirls, of course, are a light, light - light, light tan.||CC|We'd like - Stu and I would like to know, do you think the swirls are ejecta from that new crater you've seen?|06 15 26 20|CMP|Well, yes. The swirls in that one crater seem to be in Marginis, and I hope that's Marginis. I want to look at my map here in a minute and look for sure, but they seem to be emanating essentially radial from that bright crater - going out across the mare.||CC|Roger. Just a reminder, Ron, we don't want to tear you away from your window if you don't want to, but this is your eat period.||CMP|No, that's all right. I'd better grab -||CC|And we're T minus 3 White Sands and counting.||CMP|Better munch on something here.

Uh huh!||CC|I guess what I'm saying is I need a mirror down here on ny console for those of us in the peanut gallery here.||CMP|(Laughter)|06 15 28 49|CMP|Okay, the crater I was talking about was Al-Biruni -is the one that's got the swirls across coming from it. And then off in the northwest corner, just outside the rim, that's a very bright crater. It shows up on this - contingency chart. So that was Al-Biruni. Goddard's got a lot of - of swirls in it also. No, wait a minute. Goddard was the one I was talking about, not Al-Biruni.||CC|Okay. Goddard. Roger; got you.||CMP|What? Yes, Goddard is the one I was talking about. Crater size is more relative on that one, and there weren't any craters on the floor so that had - that had to be Goddard.||CC|Okay, we just had lift-off at White Sands.||CMP|Hey, good! Let's hope she keeps going.|06 15 32 26|CMP|You know, I'm looking north of - along Crisium. Okay, yes; there's Picard and Peirce. And you get the - same - same pattern that looks kind of like a swirl. Looks the same - same type of albedo as a - as a swirl with light places and dark places. The only difference being that you can definitely tell that these are ejecta from Proclus because the pattern is somewhat radial, you know, from Proclus itself. And then you've got the same thing, there's a crater up on the north - north rim - -||CC|Roger. We got you.||||||Tape 106B/5||CMP|-- ... Crisium, just outside of it is about a 50-kilometer crater again. And it's a very bright one. And there the rays cross the Proclus swirls -or rays. Here you have to definitely call them -call them rays instead of swirls, and yet they look the same way. And the only - the only distinction is that in Crisium they go essentially radial. They have a direction to them, whereas the ones over there in Marginis and - next to Fermi or somewhere off in that part of the country are -They don't have any particular direction to them.|06 15 37 44|CC|Okay, Ron. White Sands just called us and they got a good data take and their - Preliminary report shows a good report on Aerobee.||CMP|Ah, perfect.|06 15 4l 39|CMP|You know, I'm looking out of window 2 now, and you can definitely get three different color textures on the thing. You've got the light tan of Serenitatis, and then you've got the - an annulus ring that stops somewhere in about the middle of the two ridge systems that go around. And then you come down south in the landing site area and the two dark things change - Ah, I can't quite see it anymore. Then landing site is a darker - more of a gray, and it go - goes on - goes on up -There's a subdued crater; there's kind of a - The rilles go on up there, and then there's a filled-in crater just to the west of one that's about 20 kilometers in diameter. And that's about where the dark-gray material ends, right on the edge of that crater. And then you run in to the annulus that goes all the way around Crisium. I mean -not - not Crisium - or around Serenitatis.||CC|Serenitatis, Roger.||CMP|Ouch!|06 15 43 33|CMP|Frame 110 and 111 were taken, just now, out of mag Oscar Oscar - one of the landing site, and ohe north of the landing site, trying to get the color distinction between the three of them there.||||Tape 106B/6||||CC|Roger; we copy.|06 15 47 4l|CC|Ron, do you have your Flight Plan handy?

Unless there's some, you know, a little gravy between the 40 usable frames.||CC|Okay, Ron. There are 44 useful frames on that mag, so you can go from 30 to 44 in getting data.||CDR|Ah ha! Okay, that's good. We can get the whole works, then.||CC|Roger.|06 16 15 51|CMP|Outstanding.|06 16 19 15|CMP|Okay, Charlie 3 and Bravo 3 are ON. Alfa 3, and Bravo 3 are OFF.

As the initial activity then, we are going to have to take explosive package 5 with us, and we'll stick it under the LMP seat, and I'll remind you in real time when we get down on the ground on that one. And number 5,3 pound, will be deployed at station 10, and again I'll remind you about that in real time, so don't - you don't have to bother to write it in on your checklist. Planned traverse proceeds as normal. We're expecting to spend about an hour and 20 minutes at stations 6 and 7, and the suggestion is that we may end up wanting to spend that totally at the split boulder at station 6, but, of course, the option still exists to visit more than one place and sample other boulders if it seems feasible and attractive and desirable. They are suggesting additional 500-millimeter photographs, especially if it seems that we can use those to document tracks and sources of docu - of the sampled boulders; for instance, at stations 6 and 7* We are continuing to hold the nominal 47 minutes at station 8 - that is, 8A, and we still think that's as good a place as any to sample the Sculptured Hills. Station 9 is still nominal 30 minutes, but in view of the similarities to the in - to station 4, we're anticipating a possible desirability to remove time from station 10 to enlarge station 9, but that will have to be a real-time decision, based upon what we find at station 9- Station 47 - station 10 continues nominal. We're still interested in sampling the blocks and also interested in - in trenching to try and see -if we can say something about the dark mantle -light area relationship and, perhaps, the nominal coring. We're going to - we're going to deploy EP 5 there; and, other than that, they're basically the same. If we have the time during that closeout, and you'll know if we have enlarged the closeout somewhat, of the LM, based on our experience the last two nights, particularly for dusting; but also, if time permits, in that time||||Tape 107A/2|||||"we might try and get the - use up the extra double core, if there is one, in the dark mantle near the IM or do some trenching near the IM. But that's only if time permits at the very end, depending upon how the consumables run out. They want to call attention to two particular things here. One, since you guys really haven't gotten any very big rocks so far, they're recommending, they say here, and I quote: ""The value of large individual samples has been demonstrated. We recommend that several football-sized samples of a uniform igneous rock be collected at station 9 or 10."" I'11 pass that on as that. Another point of interest is the 1- to 20- millimeter size section of the regolith, the dark mantle, the lithology. Then, any observations or collections you can make pertinent to that would be of interest in trying to determine the relationship of the dark mantle to the subfloor units of gabbro underneath. Two short questions which I'll ask, which I hope - hope you can answer in just a very few words. One of them is a yes and no answer. One, we - they can't find the geophone photos specifically called out in the transcript. There is probably a little bit of garble at that point, and the people in the back room will be very happy if you could say once and for all, Jack, that, yes, you did get the geophone photos. Over."|06 14 50 03|LMP-LM|Yes.||CC|Roger. And the second one concerns the 1/4-pound charge which we deployed on the way in last night. Two questions on that. It appears to us from your voice transcript that we weren't fast enough on it at the time that that may be deployed closer to the ALSEP than the one you deployed on the way out. And we'd like an impression on that. And, number 2, you mentioned that you placed it in a depression. We'd like some feeling for that depression in terms of how much of a danger that bomb - charge might play to the AI£EP when i t i'oc-j off. If it's in a depression of any sort, thcy'ri' probably pretty well protecting the AL3KP. Any comment on those two questions? Over.||||||Tape 107A/3|06 14 50 47|CDR-LM|Well, the second one. It's not in a major depression. But it is a - maybe a - it's a little ditch, maybe a third of a meter deep. I imagine it will help a little bit. That's why we picked it. Just a second.||LMP-LM|I'm not sure we understand your first question very much.||CC|Okay. We have a feeling that when you - -||CDR-LM|Bob, don't you have the mileages?||CC|Roger. But there's again some confusion on that.||CDR-LM|Can't you - can't you pinpoint that?||CC|Yes, and those mileages also seem to indicate that we had that callout. Remember, you drove back by and you said you saw the flag, and then you said you actually saw the charge inself first. And it was some time after that you said you deployed the charge. And we have the opinion from both that and the mileage that you probably deployed the second charge closer to the ALSEP than the first one. Do you have a - any sort of a feel for that?|06 l4 51 43|CDR-LM|Oh, yes. I remember saying that, but that's when I did a big 360, and Jack was out of film. And I just lined up to take that picture with him up in the background. And when I said, hey, I saw the charge first. I was really - Don't take that comment too strong.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||CDR-LM|As far as position of it, Bob, I - I - we're looking for them out there now. As a matter of fact, we can't see them from here.||CC|Okay. We'll let it go at that. And that's all the questions and comments we have on today's traverse. We'll have a few real-time things on the surface, which I won't bother you with. A||||Tape 107A/4|||||possible fix to the surface electrical properties and a possible trip back to the surface gravimeter, which is still having its problems. But I'll talk with you guys in real time on those when you pet on the surface, rather than bothering you with them now.||CDR-LM|Hey, Bob. How far should that last charge be from the ALSEP?||CC|They want it about 300 to 400 meters.||CC|And, Gene, you ... 0.2 for range when - -||CDR-LM|Bob, I ... - -||CC|- - ... got back to the LM. And I guess the question would be, Did you ever go through zero on the way back to the LM? If you are at 0. -if you were at 0.2, and we think 9 - 092 was the bearing, then the LM is right where we thought it was, and we were just a little confused by our distances. Just doesn't quite - they don't quite hold together.||CDR-LM|No, I don't think I ever went through zero, because I initiated at the SEP.||CC|Okay.||CDR-LM|And, no, I didn't go through zero.||CC|Okay.||CDR-LM|I'm positive.||CC|We copy that. Okay. We'll work on that.||CDR-LM|Is this something to think - Yes, this is something to think about. It's not that far out there. You know, if there is any question about that damaging the ALSEP, it - it's Jur,t hard for us to recall how close they were. And we sort of thought you had them pinpointed for us. But, if you want it 3 to 400 meters, you might think about a late ... - -||||||Tape 107A/5||CC|No. We thought about that. We don't - we don't want to do that. No, we don't want to do that. So we'll take care of it. Don't worry about it now. That's all we have. Press on with the prep.||LMP-LM|Bob, I can - Hey, Bob; this is Jack. I can see the charge with the binocular. It's out almost behind a rock that's between us and the LM, but I can see it. I (laughter) - I mean, a rock between it and the LM. I can't give you any idea, though, how far it is.||CC|Okay.|06 i4 54 54|LMP-LM|No, it's the one off to the left. It's the ... -Hey, Bob. Let me say again, I think we ought to emphasize the exotic looking fragments on the dark mantle. And we ought to try to make sure that we look at a variety of rocks from the North Massif. I think we saw the major rock types on the South Massif yesterday, but we really didn't spend a lot of time ranging along the front there to verify that completely. The other comment on the 1- to 20-millimeter size fraction. There isn't an awful lot of that in the dark mantle. That's one of the striking things about it.||CC|Okay. Copy that. And we'll talk - -||LMP-LM|But we'll keep our eyes open.||CC|- - I'll talk with the back room about stations 6 and 7* We'll get with you on that when you get there. And press on.|06 i4 57 38|LMP-LM|Houston, Challenger. I was BIOMED, RIGHT, there for about 10 minutes, in case you're curious.||CC|Okay, Jack. And it looked good.||CDR-LM|Okay, Bob. I've got them both. And the last one we deployed, which I think is the eastern one -easternmost one, is definitely farther out than the first one we deployed. And you know, at this distance, it's awful hard by looking at Jack's geophones. What1s your - I got to give you at least 300 meters, Bob.||||Tape 107A/6||||CC|Okay, Geno. Bob's in the back room. I'm sure they're listening, and we got that'.||CDR-LM|Yes, I - I've got both of them with the monocular now. And the - the second one, the last one we deployed, is quite a bit farther out than the first one.||CC|Okay. I think that's what they want to hear.||CDR-LM|Gordo, I guess it's half again or maybe even twice as far away as - as the first we deployed. So we're going to forget it.||CC|Okay, Geno. That sounds good.||LMP-LM|And, Gordo, ITm going off the air also here for about 10 minutes. It'll speed things up a little bit.||CC|Okay. Fine.|06 15 12 50|CDR-LM|Houston, Challenger.

I'll see. I was - I was wondering about that, really.|06 17 39 10|CMP|You know, the Crater Dawes has got - starting from the top going down the rim, there's a kind of a light-tan layer, it's a concentric layer that (joes||||Tape 107B/4|||||all the way around; and then you come into a lighter - it1s almost to the white and it looks like on the hills and all around the landing site. And this first layer goes down maybe - let's see, as you look at the total distance in there, about a third of the distance; and then the white layer -concentric layer that goes all the way around, and this is in the western wall I'm looking at now, and it goes down to - to about a half of the distance, not quite half of the distance from the top of the rim down to the bottom. And then the lower portion of it, the lower half, a little better than a half really, is kind of a tannish gray - has a tannish-gray albedo to it. It's all streaked. And close to the bottom of the layer, the bottom of the crater itself is - filled with - Well, oddly enough, it's the same color of material that's -that's laying around the edges of the crater. It has some radial rings around it, which gives an indication of a subsidence of some kind, or a sliding down the hill. That's really the first crater where I've been able to see any sort of layering in the walls. Now the first layer on the north side and also on the south side, in the dark brownish layer of the thing, you can see parts that are jagged, jagged, and sticking out. In other words, there's a slight change in slope in it. That looks like it's a very steep slope, which would indicate that it's a fairly eon - compacted type of material in the first layer. And then the slope changes in the white layer on down a little bit more. And the white layer seems to sort of combine and maintain the same type of slope as the dark-gray stand - layer - the bottom, or from halfway down to the bottom of the crater.|06 17 42 00|CC|Roger, Ron. Did you tie in some of that ejecta material to the layer at the very bottom of the crater, like an overturned flap or something?||CMP|Yes. That's what it looks like.||CC|Roger. Got you.|06 17 42 17|CMP|The ejecta material is about the - Yes, that the -Okay, here we come on - Well, it1s an odd angle, but I guess it will work. Good. I want to get some of the - 30 and let's see. The first one||||||Tape 107B/5|||"started at Tacquet. I'm going to whip her back one and get one of - back the other way, because that's kind of a change in - in the color.

Come here and I'll snap the snap.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Didn't mean to do that.||CDR-EVA|That's all right. I can't get close enough to you.||LMP-EVA|Here you are.||CDR-EVA|Lean a little more. Antenna's up. Let me get the snap.||CC|And, IT, if you guys are interested, your shadows will be 8 feet long tonight.||LMP-EVA|How many meters is that, Bob?||CDR-EVA|I'll draw it out - I'll step it out for you. You can measure it. (Laugjhter)||LMP-EVA|Well, I don't know. Should I take my gloves off? I mean my cover gloves.||CDR-EVA|Why don't you leave them on for a while and see where we're going. See what the boulder field looks like up there.||LMP-EVA|Well, I know what it's going to look like.||CDR-EVA|No, you don't.||LMP-EVA|The point is my hands will be much better off without them.||CDR-EVA|Take them off, then. Okay, battery covers are closed and tight. High gain is already oriented. Oh, they've even got TV, I guess.||CC|That's affirm.||CDR-EVA|||||||Tape 108A/23||CC|And, Geno, when you push the Rover circuit breakers in, how about giving us a battery temperature reading on the Rover bats.||CDR-EVA|Tell them what my batteries are reading if I can.||LMP-EVA|Well, let me see if I can do something else while I'm waiting.||CDR-EVA|No, I'm done, Jack.||LMP-EVA|I'll get the old SEP receiver.|06 17 09 13|CDR-EVA|Well, Bob, the - battery 1 is 95 degrees and the - battery 2 is reading zero. So we got a gage failure. No, it's not reading zero; it's off s cale low.||CC|Okay, read that - copy that. That's a real cooldown, isn't it? Okay, Jack, if you're going to worry about the SEP, stand by and don't do the SEP until after you worry with the ETB, and we'll get to you on that. When you get the ETB to the seat, I'll talk to you about it.||LMP-EVA|Okay, it's - 1 - 1 - 102 is the temperature.||CC|Okay; copy that.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. Mark.||CC|MARK.|06 17 10 02|CDR-EVA|MARK gravimeter; it's flashing.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Okay, we'll take the big bag. I hope we can keep it on.||LMP-EVA|...||CC|Okay. A couple of things on that, Geno. You might try tapping the thing to see if that loosens the dust. There's also the hook business on the inside of the pallet that you could hook it on. Caution: if you open the pallet, be careful not to knock the clamps off the fender. But you can also reach over the pallet to put the big bag on.||||Tape 108A/24|||06 17 10 42|CDR-EVA|"Okay, Bob. ? We - I ""brushed it and tapped it yesterday, I'm not sure we're going to have much luek with them."||CC|Say again there, Gene.||CDR-EVA|I brushed them and tapped them yesterday.||CC|Okay; copy that. You might want to put the big bag on the inside of the pallet there, if you can't operate them.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Okay, mag Kilo goes on the 500; is that correct?||CC|That's affirm.||LMP-EVA|Okay, I've got Mary and Franny and Nancy - and Donna - and Bobby and - -||CDR-EVA|Jack, I'm also going to keep this in there.||LMP-EVA|- - Karen.||CDR-EVA|Because it's too hard to get off the front end. We'll find a place for that in there.||LMP-EVA|Well, okay.||CDR-EVA|It's just too hard to get off the front end. Okay, let's see. Big bag to gate, dustbrush to - Let me get that big bag on the inside of the gate if I can. Inside the gate or the pallet, Bob?||CC|Inside the pallet. My - Kty fault there.||LMP-EVA|That - that's - the pallet, the pallet -||CDR-EVA|Yes,||CC|And if you open the pallet, be careful of the clamp. Probably, if it's feasible, we suggest you reach across in front of the pallet - reach across the pallet to do it. Instead of opening it because of the clamp on the fender.||CDR-EVA|It's not feasible. It's not feasible to do that. I got to open it, plus our hook is - overcenter.||||||Tape 108A/25|||Let me get something to work on that with. You know, Bob, how that pallet locking hook can - can be out of the little C-^-shaped - release in there? It is .||CC|Oh, boy.||CDR-EVA|I noticed that yesterday.||CC|Jack. When you get done with the ETB, then you might save the gray tape out. We're going to use a little bit of that on the SEP when you get done.||LMP-EVA|When are you going to do that?||CC|We'll turn the - -||LMP-EVA|What am I supposed to do, stand - well -||CC|We'll turn both switches on when you're out at the SEP transmitter.||LMP-EVA|Well, the tape Is in the CDRs seat, and it'll still be there.||CC|No, we'd like to take the tape from the CDRs seat and use it on the SEP, right now.||LMP-EVA|Okay. You want me to do it or Gene to do it?||CC|Why don't you do it since the tape is there. No, let's - let's let Gene do it. Doesn't really matter. Whoever wants to.|06 17 14 24|LMP-EVA|Okay, we'11 get it.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, the big bag is on the inside of the -of the pallet.||CC|Okay; we copy that.||LMP-EVA|I want it ...||CDR-EVA|The - And I know why. This is a ... that's on the way, Jack. Get rid of this thing. We don't need It anyway. Okay, opening and closing of the pallets didn't interfere at all with those fenders.||CC|Okay; copy that.||||Tape 108A/26||||LMP-EVA|These aren't clasped now - Now the tape.||CDR-EVA|Okay. The big bag is on the inside, though.||LMP-EVA|Yes, but it's - also in the way. Okay, I got it.||CDR-EVA|Sure is. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't close it.||LMP-EVA|Want me to get out of the way?||CDR-EVA|I'll open it. See? It drags over that locking device. Okay, let me just see what we got to do here. Okay. Big bag, dustbrush, SCB-7 to gate, mount 20-bag dispenser on commander's camera, 20-bag dispenser to the LMP, core cap dispenser to the gate.||CC|Okay. And, Jack, are you going out to take the pan now?|06 17 16 15|LMP-EVA|Well, as soon as I finish up here.||CC|(Stay.||LMP-EVA|I'll do that.||CC|Okay. And after you take the pan, we'd like you to retrieve the cosmic ray experiment. They're expecting a little solar storm, and before the rain gets on the cosmic ray experiment, they'd like to retrieve it. We'll leave it in the ETB during the traverse.||LMP-EVA|Okay, after the pan. All right.||CC|Roger. It will just be a nominal retrieval and we*11 put it in the ETB. Copy the gate.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||||||Tape 108A/27||CDR-EVA|Okay, SCB-7 - 20-bag dispenser goes on my camera when it gets back. Short can under the LMPs seat. Okay. Jack, I'll just go ahead and mount some of these bags on your camera while I'm here.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Thank, you.||CC|Okay. And, Gene, if you got time there with the camera, why don't we - when you get done with the camera, how about getting some gray tape and we'll put you to work on SEP for about a minute.||CDR-EVA|The SEP receiver?||CC|That's affirm. And if you get - -||CDR-EVA|Stand by. Let me finish with SCB-7 here.||CC|Okay. And did you get Jack's camera fixed last night? I didn't hear.||CDR-EVA|Yes, we did. Okay, there is already one on the gate. Leave that one there. Okay, SCB-7 to gate, 20-bag dispenser on commander's - camera, we'll do it when I get back - 20 bags on the LMPs camera, core cap dispenser to gate - there's one there, there's one under the seat - short cans under the LMPs seat. Okay, I got to put that cap dispenser on him, I got to get my rammer, hammer -Hey, Bob, what bag do you want on the LMP? Do we ave 8 here?||CC|Stand by. I think 8 went in, either 4 or 6. No, excuse me; either 5 or 4.||CDR-EVA|Okay. We'll put either 4 or 5 on there. Okay. I'll have to wait until he gets back. What do you want? Or let me give you TGE reading and get that out of the way and then 1111 work on your SEP.||CC|Okay; copy that.|06 17 19 45|CDR-EVA|Okay. 670, 027, 001; that's 670, 027, 001.||CC|Okay; copy that, Gene. Thank you.||CDR-EVA|Pender wrinkled up in the Sun a little bit last night.||||Tape 108A/28||||LMP-EVA|Okay -|06 17 20 17|LMP-EVA|MARK it. The cosmic ray is terminated.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|And, Bob, I took two 5-foot stereopairs of the configuration.||CC|Copy. And we'll stick it in the ETB and just hang it there.||LMP-EVA|Yes. And in case you're wondering, and so you don't confuse it with a rock, it's in bag 106.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Okay. What do you want done to the SEP?||CC|Okay. Take some gray tape over to the receiver, Gene. And with reference to the fact that the -there is some Velcro missing on the front there which hold the covers down, we'd like to tape the two covers together - on the - in the middle there - you know, where the two - two sides overlap in the middle of the box. Tape those two together. A short piece about an inch long should do it if they are clean.||CDR-EVA|Well, I doubt if the tape will stick because ... , but I Blight be able to go over it with one piece to clean it and another piece to tape it.||CC|Okay. And the question beyond that, is there Velcro to hold one of those flaps down or not?||CDR-EVA|No.||CC|Okay, so both pieces - the Velcro is missing from both flaps, I take it.||CDR-EVA|Yes.||||||Tape 108A/29||LMP-EVA|Bob, what happened was that the tape that held the lower Velcro on there apparently came loose, and it stuck to the upper Velcro.||CC|Okay. I understand that. In that case, we'd like to take a piece of tape and tape the cover down to keep it closed when it's not - when it's supposed to be closed. The feeling is that if the cover flaps partly open, you may get specular reflection off the inside of the Mylar down onto the mirrors causing it to heat up during the drive when it's supposed to be closed.||CDR-EVA|Okay, we'll give it a try.||CC|Okay; thank you. And, Jack, if you're done, you might go rescue EP number 5 from the footpad, and we'll put it under the LMPs seat.|06 17 22 43|LMP-EVA|Well, be a lot of other things under there. Okay. I'll rescue it; we'll see where the best place to put it is.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Hey, I got - I got bags on you - I got bags on your camera, Geno.||CDR-EVA|Okay; thank you.||LMP-EVA|Okay, we're going to put those two bags on the rear there on your PLSSs?||CC|One of them will go - -||CDR-EVA|... those two on.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CC|The one under LMPs seat will go on the CDR, the one with all the stuff in it.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I got core tubes in 7 here, Jack. We'll put either one of those - -||||Tape 108A/30||||LMP-EVA|Okay. So I can't put the charge under my seat.||CC|That's affirm, I think, Jack, once you get SCB-7 out of there.||LMP-EVA|Yes, I feel like a kid stuck in taffy.||LMP-EVA|Sure is strange not to see some fine-grained rocks out here. Seen a couple but certainly not very many.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|That rock that you picked up at - What are you doing up there? Okay.||CDR-EVA|Bob, that'll hold it down. I hope it solves the problem.||CC|Roger. And so does Dr. Strangelove.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Well, probably not any more than we would like to see it solved.||LMP-EVA|Bob - Nothing. Gene, your bag's going to have two lowers and one upper.||CC|Did you re-sort things there, Jack?||LMP-EVA|What1s that?||CC|Did you re-sort things in SCB-7? I was told - -||LMP-EVA|I said I got - Bob, I - Go ahead.||CC|Okay. Our understanding was there were two uppers and one lower in bag 7» and two lowers under the LMP seat. Did you re-sort things there?||LMP-EVA|Do you want - how do you want them?||||||Tape 108A/31||CC|It doesn't matter to us. I just wanted to make sure that we know what you are so we don't let you get away too far with two uppers and a lower. Two lowers and an upper is certainly better than two uppers and a lower. As long as we know what it is.|06 17 26 03|LMP-EVA|Okay. It's two lowers and an upper.||CC|Got that.||LMP-EVA|Two lowers and an upper. Man, I'm confused.||CDR-EVA|Okay. When you're ready, I'll configure you.||LMP-EVA|Okay, here, let me - let me get this on you first since I got - -||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|And I'm going to ask you to turn a - 180 degrees because you're up on a hill. I'll never be able to do it.||CDR-EVA|How's that? I'm down in a hole now.||LMP-EVA|That's beautiful.||LMP-EVA|Okay, ... Can't get this fixed.||LMP-EVA|Tallest man on the Moon right now. Okay, that's done.||CDR-EVA|Okay?||LMP-EVA|Just a second. Let me close the 'cover. Not a very good cover. Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, I'm going to put SCB-4 on Jack.||LMP-EVA|Go ahead.||CC|Say again there, Gene. SCB-6? SCB-4; copy.||CDR-EVA|SC - SCB-4 will go on Jack. Okay, Jack, I got to get these PLSS straps, too. Did you get mine?||||Tape 108A/32||||LMP-EVA|No.||CDR-EVA|!Hiose harness release straps?||LMP-EVA|Oh, no. Let's do that. I sav them as you go out, and then I forget about them.||CDR-EVA|Yes. Okay, yours is on over here. Probably a better time to do them, anyway, rather than when we go out. Okay, let me get the bag. I'll get the other one when I configure your other side. Okay, you're on. Okay, want to get my PLSS straps? Then I'll be cleaned up, and then I finish your Other one when I configure your other side. Okay, you're on. Qkay, want to get my PLSS straps? Then I'll be cleaned up, and then I finish your other side.||LMP-EVA|Let me get the other one. Warmer out here today. ... on the hands. Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay, stay right where you are so I can get this.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Now come over here, and I'll get you a core cap dispenser, which I left here. Okay, you got SCB-4, you got the cap, you got the rammer, I'll take the haroer. You got the - That's all you need. TGE is on the LRV. Okay, what transport -vh*t charge you got there, Jack?||LMP-EVA|Five is under my seat.||CDR-EVA|Five, okay, You got 5 there, we got 2 and 3 on the Rover, LCRU blankets are open 100 percent, battery cover are closed. I want to - Push that battery cover over there down just to make sure it goea down.||LMP-EVA|The warning flag is up ...||CDR-EVA|It'a probably that - Already, huh? Yes. ... down on there.||LMP-EVA|Rover - Rover warning was up.|06 17 30 09|CDR-EVA|Get one right there.||LMP-EVA|It's down.||||||Tape 108A/33||CDR-EVA|I'll take a look at that gage again, but the gage on the high battery looked like it may have failed. Okay, LCRU blankets are open, battery covers are closed and pushed closed, dust LCRU -||LMP-EVA|I'm going to the SEP.||CC|Okay, Jack.||CDR-EVA|Wait a minute before you do. You got a second? Just come over here by the left front wheel. I know you got a second. Just a little bit closer to the left front wheel, towards me. Oh, that's good, anywhere in there. Wait a minute.||CDR-EVA|Can you do that likewise? Or can you hold it with that other camera? It's already set at 30.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|And you might want to take a couple - -||CC|17» Houston. We think somebody lost their comm. Jack, it's probably Gene going to zero.|06 17 32 03|LMP-EVA|You read us, Bob?||CC|Roger. Read you now.||LMP-EVA|Bob s do you read Gene?||CC|Reading you, Jack. I haven't heard Gene yet.||LMP-EVA|Bob, Gene's calling you.||CC|You read me.||CDR-EVA|How do you read me, Bob?||CC|Okay, read you now.||||Tape 108A/34||||CDR-EVA|Okay, I didn't do anything. I Just jiggled n^-MODE switch here. Okay, we got 2 and 3 on the EPs, plus one under Jack's seat. LCRU blankets are opened 100 percent; battery covers are closed; dustbrush. I've got; TGE, I've got; mags and polarization filter is taken care of; and I'm ready to traverse to the SEP.||CC|Roger. We understand TGE stowed and you're taken care of in the comm. And you might give us a Rover read-out either now or when you get to the SEP.||CDR-EVA|Okay; we'll see which is convenient.||CC|Yes. SEP is probably more convenient while you're sitting there waiting for the nav to warm up or initialize - waiting for us to give you the reading.||CDR-EVA|Okay, checking your TV. MODE switch is 1.||LMP-EVA|Hey, Bob, are you watching LMP?||CDR-EVA|Not anymore he isn't. I took the TV. Bob, you still read?||CC|Roger. Read you loud and clear. We're now watching the LMP.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I just wondered because I just took the TV. I just want to make sure we got comm here.||CC|Yes. We're reading you in MODE 1.||CDR-EVA|And, for your information, we both got our cover gloves off.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Okay, that's in, that's in, that's in. Should have dusted my checklist on the Rover. I can't read down there.||LMP-EVA|Bob, the old tape fix on the SEP's still working.||||||Tape 108A/35||CC|Beautiful.||LMP-EVA|There's a little - both mirrors have a little angular displacement but not more than 5 degrees.||CC|Sounds like that's the' least of the SEP's problem, but we have hope.|06 17 35 01|LMP-EVA|Okay, you're going to be over there, huh? I'm over here.||CDR-EVA|I don't believe this.||LMP-EVA|What's the problem?||CDR-EVA|Oh, nothing. That roll indicator isn't worth a dingdong ... roll 10 degrees.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Roll zero, pitch is zero; heading is 291; distance, 001; range, 000; amps hours are 90 and 85; volts are 65 65; Sun shadow device, by the way, is 0.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Batteries are 100 and off scale low, and motors are all off scale low.||CC|Okay, and, Gene, we'd like to torque to 287, 287.||CDR-EVA|Okay; in work. Let's see, 287. That's a heading from Dodge City to Tindall. Okay, 27 28, 287 right on the money.||CC|Copy that, Geno. And - -|06 17 36 31|LMP-EVA|Bob, 45 - 45 Yankee is a sample - sample from near the SEP.||CDR-EVA|Boy, I tell you, Jack. That was all cut out.||LMP-EVA|Oh, well. I got the sample anyway.||||Tape 108A/36||||CC|We copied 45 Yankee near the SEP. That's all we have. If you give us a frame count when you get done, and give us an approximate location for the Rover, at least crosswise from the Y, we'd appreciate it. And we also need SEP receiver power and DSEA both on. And we'd like the cover taped back -taped down when you get done, Jack.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Jack, keep me honest on those rilles.||LMP-EVA|Okay, you're okay now. Let me get over on the rille. I don't afee -||CDR-EVA|See me?||LMP-EVA|Come on. You're good.||CDR-EVA|Oh, there's the SEP. Wait - did I miss this other rille?||LMP-EVA|Yes. There's the - I'm on the antenna.||CDR-EVA|What about the one coming west?||LMP-EVA|That's what I - No, you're okay on the one west -you're way away from it.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Going to look back.||LMP-EVA|You want to look - head towards the SEP. You're okay.||CDR-EVA|Oh, I see it now. Okay.||LMP-EVA|Head towards it and then turn - then make your turn.||CDR-EVA|I see it. I'll go over to it.||LMP-EVA|Matter of fact, turn on these tracks.||CDR-EVA|Yes. I'm in good shape. I see it. I see it.||LMP-EVA|Bob, that 45 Yankee was a fine-grained basalt, I think. One of the few around here. That's why I picked it up.||||||Tape 108A/37||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Okay, you stopped?||CDR-EVA|I'm stopped and I'm ready to go. I'm 2 meters to the west of the north line.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|And I guess I'm certainly within 5 meters of the transmitter.||CC|Okay, we'll get that in the photos. And Gene, how's the low gain located - oriented?|06 17 39 07|CDR-EVA|It's oriented 355 and my heading is 352.||CC|Okay, copy that.||CDR-EVA|Okay, you want the receiver on - -||CC|Roger. Both - -||CDR-EVA|- - and taped down again, huh?||LMP-EVA|Yes, ... put ...||CC|Roger. Both the receiver and the recorder on, both switches on and then tape the cover down.||LMP-EVA|Okay, good luck.||CDR-EVA|I don't know if that tape is going to hold. Okay, ON and ON. Okay, it's taped down more or less.||CC|Thank you.||LMP-EVA|And then I guess I'm supposed to get on, huh?||CC|Roger on that.||CDR-EVA|Hey, Bob, the NAV RESET has been - NAV RESET is now OFF and I'm all zeroed up.||CC|Okay. Copy that. And we're ready for you guys to roll.||||Tape 108A/38||||CDR-EVA|Okay, what's the first range and hearing to the Rover sample, past Jones?||CC|Okay, it will be 185 and 1.5 on the range.||CDR-EVA|Okay, 185 and 1,5. 185 and 1-1/2. Okay.|06 17 40 46|LMP-EVA|Okay, then, Gene; no problem.||LMP-EVA|Well, shoot. I've forgotten how.||CDR-EVA|Boy, that Challenger looks pretty from here, you know it.||LMP-EVA|Yes. Okay, I'm on.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Did I want a chart?||CDR-EVA|No.||CC|No charts, Jack; no charts.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|"Got it. Got it; 185 and 1.5 and I'm going to head cm at about 012. We ought to go right through Jones. Oh, ""baby - Jones."||CC|Okay, and, Gene, remember the driving fairly slow -or fairly well controlled the first 300 meters, and a mark at the end of the antenna.||CDR-EVA|Watch that, Jack, watch that antenna lean - -||LMP-EVA|Uh-oh. Keep going.||CDR-EVA|Look to you?||LMP-EVA|Okay so far; keep going.||CDR-EVA|Okay, let's do that again - -||LMP-EVA|Yes.||||||Tape 108A/39||CDR-EVA|- - but a little different. I'll pick up that same spot, I can see right where I was.||CC|Okay. Give us another mark when you start up on that side.||CDR-EVA|Okay. We'll give you a hack, Bob.||LMP-EVA|Okay. You're a little - -||CDR-EVA|Yes, I'm right on the track. Same tracks exactly.||LMP-EVA|Well, okay.||CDR-EVA|That's exactly - I just came right over. Okay, we're starting Bob -|06 17 42 36|CDR-EVA|MARK it.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|We can't go too far in this heading. We've got a big hole up here.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Like a big one.||LMP-EVA|Wonder if that's Rudolph?||LMP-EVA|Well, let's see, this is east - looks awf - it's a double crater but it's much bigger than I thought Rudolph would be.||CC|Ho, if you're where you think you are, you're beyond - you're east of Rudolph quite a ways.||CDR-EVA|Hey, I think you ought to know where we are by now, Bob.||CC|Roger that.||LMP-EVA|Maybe that's Lewis and Clark.||CC|After you give me a mark there, we'll give you -I'll talk to you about it.||||Tape 108A/U0||||CDR-EVA|I'm sorry, Bob. I guess you - you didn't hear it. I - we're passed the end of the antenna and we're headed south or north - northeast.||CC|Okay, I - -||CDR-EVA|That screw you up?||CC|Did you give me a mark when you started or a mark when you passed the antenna?||CDR-EVA|I gave you a mark when I started and it took about 20 seconds to get to the end.||CC|Okay, copy that.||CDR-EVA|Is that good enough or do you want me to go back?||CC|No. No. Press on. And, Jack, if you look at your contour map there, we think you are located right now at approximately where the P in SEP is, Just below the P in Poppy. In which case you're probably driving through that little crater that's just to the northeast there.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CC|That's probably the one you came upon.||CDR-EVA|Not very little, though.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob. Boy, I wish I could see a little bit better.|06 17 44 59|LMP-EVA|The major boulders still look like the - the pyroxene gabbro. Surface texture has not changed. There is a - there is a granule population, now that I look at it more closely, with the shadows. But I have a feeling that most of those are -they look like they're just small, very small clods. That should show up in some of the bulk samples we've taken. It is remarkable to me the - only a small number of fine-grain rocks. There's one at about halfway between the SEP and the LM that I'd like to pick up, it's a fairly good sized one. Maybe we can get it when we get back. It looks like a fine-grained basalt. I may have sampled one in 45 Yankee there.||||||Tape 108A/41||CDR-EVA|Well, I tell you, it's not exactly the greatest place to navigate through.||LMP-EVA|I think you ought to bear left, don't you?||CDR-EVA|Yes. That's where I'm going here. I just want to get across this mounted boulders.|06 17 46 12|LMP-EVA|There's still - there's a crater we're just passing at 207-4 about 20 meters in diameter, with the pyroxene gabbro blocks on the rim, few of them. It's not an exceptionally blocky rim crater, but we are in an area where the block population is up to about 5 percent in contrast to most of the area we traversed yesterday.||CDR-EVA|I tell you, going is a little bit rough; there's a population of blocks as Jack said and there is an awful lot of small craters.||LMP-EVA|Yes, I was just going to add that the frequency of craters in the 10-meter size range is quite a bit higher than we were used to yesterday. Oops, there's one.||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Snuck up on you. And they all - although not exceptionally blocky rim - they all have a slightly, maybe 2 or 3 or 5 percent more blocks in their walls and on their rim than do the - does the normal terrain.||CC|Roger, Jack. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Still no - still no obvious structure within the dark mantling material itself.||CDR-EVA|Bob, you said 185/1.5?||CC|That's affirm.||LMP-EVA|What do you want? For the Rover?||||Tape 108A/42||||CDR-EVA|Yes, for a sample.||LMP-EVA|Oh, they changed it on us. Okay. Okay - there's -still seeing the little pit-bottom craters with the glass in them. I've forgotten the acronym already, Bob, I'm sorry. And you. asked me for an LMP frame count awhile back and I believe it was 5-That was at the SEP.||CC|That was after the SEP photos, right?||LMP-EVA|That's affirm. Negative; that was before the SEP photos.||CC|Copy that.|06 17 48 39|LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob, looking up at the North Massif, we see the scattered, strewn field of boulders, that generally seem to start from a - more or less, from a line of large boulders, which might indicate some structure. And those lines axe roughly horizontal across the face that we're looking at. The boulder tracks are irregular in shape, obviously downhill, but you'll see in the pictures that they - that they are curved in places but they're all - that I see - tend to be aggregates of little craters - where the boulder was obviously tumbling and bouncing a little bit. We're out in population of fragments now in the immediate area at 1 - is that 188?|06 17 49 52|CDR-EVA|188/0.9.||LMP-EVA|It's generally about 1 percent between craters. But at the crater rims, it's up to about 5 percent.||CC|Okay. Copy that, Jack. And how far down the North Massif - -||LMP-EVA|And these craters - -||CC|- - is the line of boulders?||||||Tape 108A/43||LMP-EVA|Oh, there are several of them, Bob. What.I'm talking about is about 100-meter-long lines where the boulder trains initiate and they are - there's one about - looks like about halfway - maybe two-thirds of the way down in perspective. Another one that's probably about halfway - they're just sort of scattered around on the Massif.||LMP-EVA|I think we're getting close to - No, we couldn't be.||CDR-EVA|I've got to move over here a little.||LMP-EVA|That must be Jones.||CDR-EVA|Where are you looking?||LMP-EVA|Off to the right.||CDR-EVA|Yes, our heading that they're sending us down here, it really should put us to west of Jones. So that's about right. A lot of static in the background today.|06 17 50 58|CC|Yes, I think we are talking to you guys through the LM right now, and how about a speed reading?|06 17 51 04|CDR-EVA|Okay. We're at 12 clicks and we're FULL BORE.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Okay.|06 17 51 24|CDR-EVA|187/1.1.||CC|Copy that.|06 17 51 36|LMP-EVA|Bob, I wish I could give you more on that structure in there, but I think those lines of boulder sources are about all we can see right now. Talked about the lineaments yesterday and they're not nearly as obvious today in the higher Sun. Looking up Wessex Cleft - even with the Sun in the flat area there, it looks darker than where - that North Massif side. But again, the Sun angle may be fooling us but I recall it was darker on the photos. The old man wrinkled face on the - -||||Tape 108A/44||||CDR-EVA|Sculptured Hills.||LMP-EVA|- - Sculptured Hills, though, is evident as soon as you come out of the Wessex Cleft.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 108B/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|06 17 52 37|CMP|Hey, this is interesting.

EKG is good and just forget the ZPN for another day. Just go EKG and forget the ZPN. That1 s compliments of Dr. Z.||CMP|Oh, Hey, beautiful. No wonder it looked kind of erratic, because I didn't even have ZPN on (laughter).|06 18 01 43|CMP|Yes, last night I moved those - moved all three sensors on the EKG to different spots and put some of that cream stuff on them, and I think that helped.||CC|Roger. He can tell and he noticed that. And it's improved their signal on the EKG part.||CMP|Oh, okay.|06 18 17 17|CC|Ron, we're about ready to lose you in about 10 minutes. Everything's fine. We'll make one more final go-around the room before you go out of sight. I'm watching your buddies down there. They're up against a rock, which is about twice as tall as they are, and they're trying - pounding away on the side of it. Doesn't look like they're having much luck getting anything off of it, but they're beating on it.||CMP|(Laughter) Tell those guys that if they don't roll a rock down a crater - They're supposed to do that for me.||CC|"Right. I think, I think Jack got the nickname ""Twinkle Toes"" last night. He was bouncing around very graceful. Every time he'd hit the rock, he'd fall over down there."|06 18 17 59|CMP|(Laughter) Oh, great.|06 18 23 43|CC|Ron, everything's looking good as you go here to LOS; no problems at all.

I just saw a - part of these rilles - type things, and it's got a light-brown - well, dark-brown - it's almost a mare-type coloring - heading in the southeast-northwest direction. And it's down from - oh, yes, there's Saenger, east of Saenger yet. Let me find it on my map.|06 19 15 12|CC|Down east of Saenger there, you get into the first ring of Arabia or the second ring of Arabia there.|06 19 15 26|CMP|Yes. Hey, you know this is - Let me get this picture. This is the first time I've really been able to see that first ring of Arabia.||CC|You think - think you see it, huh?||CMP|And it shows up as - Yes. It - I'll take two of them. First, I'd better get the dark slide out. The way the Sun is shining on the darn thing, and it shows up as a bright - I'll be darned! That's amazing! It shows up as a bright ring, just like we got it drawn on the map. You know, you - you get a brighter albedo all the way around to the top of the ring. That was frame 120 through -or 122 through 124 on mag Oscar Oscar.|06 19 l6 35|CC|Okay, Ron, we've got a - a Flight Plan update and a lunar sounder pad, if you want to take it before we get into the visuals here.||||Tape 108B/4||||CMP|Okay, I better I guess.|06 19 17 51|CMP|Okay.

It's pretty obvious we want to take ""HF antenna 2, retract"" and move it above ""HF antenna 1."" We'll call for the retract - make sure we're ready, and we'll also cue it on our cue, Ron.

Sounds reasonable.|06 19 20 11|CC|Oksy, Ron, we're all just standing by. That takes care of the Flight Plan updates, and we're just standing by for your visuals.

Okay.|06 19 20 39|CC|Ron, we want to concentrate on the small-scale features, and your binoculars may be what you need. We want to look at the dark-halo craters in the site area and examination of D-Caldera with the binocs.||CMP|Okay. That sounds like a good idea. We'll see what we can - (Laughter) That's crazy. I go over in inertial attitude, and every time I look out the window, I've got to look in a different direction.||CC|Roger; we understand.||CMP|(Laughter) It's funny.|06 19 22 i4|CC|Hey, Ron, when you come up on the landing site, we would like you to concentrate on Shorty Crater and F Crater and then the other dark-halo craters. As you know, as I told you last night, Shorty ended up with some orange-colored material that looks an awful lot like a fuma - fumara - event anyway - fumarole. And it looks - -||CMP|Fumarole.||CC|- - an awful lot - Yes, okay (laughter). Looks an awful lot like it and what we' re trying to do is see what you see from there, and that may give us some correlation on some of these other ones.|06 19 22 49|CMP|Okay. I got to take a look and see which one's Shorty.||CC|Ron, it's the dark crater on the slide, the dark crater on the slide.|06 19 23 13|CMP|Oh, okay.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 109A/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|06 17 52 22|LMP-EVA|Yes. And they look like there are boulders up on the side of Sculptured Hills, except that they aren't nearly as big as those on the North Massif. The areas where the boulder source is look like they're made up of boulders no bigger than a meter maybe; whereas, the North Massif coulders are up to several meters. Those boulder sources all seem to be up within a third of the height of the Sculptured Hills, just south of - just east of the massif - of the Wessex Cleft. Here is a boulder track that crossed the slope. See that, Geno?||CDR-EVA|Yes - yes. I sure do now.||LMP-EVA|It looks like it goes, rather than perpendicular contours, It probably is crossing them in a fairly straight line on an angle of 60 degrees, maybe.||CDR-EVA|Back to the east.||LMP-EVA|Yes, to the east. That one may be fairly near - -||CDR-EVA|Jack, see that big boulder with that big track -it looks like it's an elongated rolled-up boulder. Look at that.||LMP-EVA|Yes, it does. Looks like it may be broken now.||CDR-EVA|Bob, what did you say - 188/2 point something.||CC|2.8.||CDR-EVA|Okay, thank you. See that big boulder, Jack, with those tracks?||LMP-EVA|Yes , it looks like - -||CDR-EVA|That's funny looking boulder.||LMP-EVA|It looks like it may have stopped rolling because it broke up.||CDR-EVA|Looks broken to me now.||||Tape 109A/2||||CDR-EVA|Boy, they've got the low gain right on. But, I tell you, we still got static.||LMP-EVA|I don't have any, Gene. You may - -||CDR-EVA|Well, I sure do.||LMP-EVA|... Okay, you've got yourself in some holes here. You've never - I've read you all along, though, so there's no problem. Okay, there's a big crater. I haven't recognized Jones yet. Looks like you're getting up on the rim of Henry here.||CDR-EVA|Yes - no, Henry should be to - I'm well - should be well west of Henry, I think. I wouldn't be surprised if Henry isn't right over that little rise on the right.||LMP-EVA|Bob, the surface structure hasn't changed texture. We're on a little bit of a rise in here now and still about 1 percent of the surface - -|06 17 57 48|CDR-EVA|There's Henry right there, Jack.||LMP-EVA|There's Henry.||CC|Okay, how about a range and bearing.||LMP-EVA|I thought you were close to Henry.||CDR-EVA|Yes. 188/1.8.||LMP-EVA|And we're just southwest of Henry.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|On the rim. Oh, Prince Henry the Navigator.||CDR-EVA|Watch that foot.||LMP-EVA|It's called a wheel, I think. And Henry looks much like Horatio did. Has boulders on its inner wall - not as many. They look light colored -a light albedo gabbroic appearance. There may be some right down there, though, that are fine grained; they look a little grayer.||||||Tape 109A/3||CDR-EVA|Jack, there's our target - there's - either one of -that's one right down there on - on ... break in slope.||LMP-EVA|See the one we've got over there has a boulder track. That's the one, that crossslope.||CDR-EVA|Yes, if we could get up high - -||LMP-EVA|Can we get up there?||CDR-EVA|We'll see.||CDR-EVA|That's the one - That's station 6, and that was the - the turning boulder.||CDR-EVA|Yes, that's it.||LMP-EVA|The one right there.||CDR-EVA|Station 6 - we can probably get up there.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Here we are - 1.5 and 185*||CC|Okay; copy that.||LMP-EVA|Okay, is this a Rover sample?||CDR-EVA|A Rover sample.||LMP-EVA|Okay - -||CDR-EVA|Tell me where you want it.||LMP-EVA|- - see that little pit right over there about 30 feet ahead.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I think so.||LMP-EVA|Okay, I've got two pictures there.||CDR-EVA|How's that?||LMP-EVA|That's great. Okay, this is soil sample - Hey, Geno.||CDR-EVA|Okay, and I just took a locator; and CDR is on frame 4l.||||Tape 109A/4||||LMP-EVA|Got it?||CDR-EVA|Oh, not yet.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Right now. Bag 40 - 46 Yankee.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Your bag open?||LMP-EVA|Yes.|06 17 54 42|CDR-EVA|Okay, it's in.||LMP-EVA|- We ought to tape that bead down if we can remember it next stop. It's in the way of - it's sticking up.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I'll get it. That thing came down - came off that piece of Velcro. I'll get it when I get. back.||LMP-EVA|Okay. And LMP's frame count is 35-||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, I'd like a - bearing and range.||CC|Okay. Bearing and range for the large block, just beyond - let's see, it's just beyond the crater Henry. The large clock there near the break of the slope, which is our next aiming point. The bearing and range there is 188 and 2.8.||CDR-EVA|188 and 2.8. Roger.||CC|Okay. And, Jack, do you - what do you see in the way of boulders coming down the base of the Sculptured Hills, in terms of sampling opportunities of station 8 and in terms of any boulder tracks that we might - might lead down to boulders that might just possibly be accessible at station 8.||LMP-EVA|Roger, Gene. Boulder tracks are not obvious on Sculptured Hills at all. It looks like there are fragments over there that would have had their sources higher up the slope. I think we can get boulders there.||||||Tape 109A/5||CC|Okay; copy that. We'll see - -||CDR-EVA|We'll have to get a little closer, Bob.||CC|We'll find out in a couple of hours.||LMP-EVA|Yes, I will give you a reading on that before long. I wouldn't eliminate station 8 for the world - or the Moon, whatever's available today.||LMP-EVA|I think we can; it doesn't look too bad. At the break in slope, right now, doesn't show anything obvious, except that's where the boulders start.||CC|Okay, we hope that's fairly obvious.|06 17 59 09|LMP-EVA|And on up the hill you have ... -||LMP-EVA|But as I was saying, Henry just looks like somewhat more mantled Horatio (laughter). Getting to be ridiculous.||CDR-EVA|Say, Bob, I'm navigating - headed northwest now -to get around the western rim of Henry.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|And on that west rim, we've got about 10 or -10 percent boulder cover.||CC|Okay* And a reminder, Jack, to keep taking your Rober photos.||LMP-EVA|Yes, sir. And when I - By boulder, I generally mean fragment, Bob, in this case. When I say 10 percent, I'm looking at stuff greater than about a centimeter in diameter. I'll try to say fragment from now on and be more precise. Okay. Here's a little area where there's - This part of Henry - this is the one part of the rim of Henry I see that has fairly large fragments, or boulders, on them up to 2 or 3 meters. But, again, they all appear to be buried. There are very few, except small ones, sitting out on the surface.||||Tape 109A/6|||06 18 00 32|CDR-EVA|And, you know, the fragment population out here only goes out to maybe 200 meters, I expect.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Now this concentration of boulders is because of a 50-meter crater in the rim of Henry.||CC|Okay, say that sounds like a lot ... - -||LMP-EVA|I think that was one that we -||CDR-EVA|Take a picture in here, Jack.||LMP-EVA|No. Locke, I can see -||CDR-EVA|I'm getting the picture.||LMP-EVA|Okay. That * s -||CDR-EVA|Yes, Locke's right ahead of us.||LMP-EVA|This is one on the - about 50 meters right on the rim crest of Henry, almost due - the west rim -due west rim. Now Locke is just ahead of us. It also has boulders in its walls but has relatively few on the rim.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Characteristic of both Henry, Locke, and Horatio is a re - essentially no change in the average frequency of boulders on the rim. The increase comes in the wall.||CDR-EVA|We're at 184/2.3. We're just about between Henry and - -||LMP-EVA|Locke.||CDR-EVA|Locke. Yes; right between them.||CC|Okay. I copy that. And you guys are heading for that big boulder, which must be just dead ahead of you there, about half a kilometer.||LMP-EVA|Well, we're - Gene's sort of headed for station 6 now.||||||Tape 109A/7||CDR-EVA|I'm going to take a tour around that boulder and get a case on it.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Go ahead.||CC|Yes. That would be a good mark to give us a range and bearing on, since that's a pretty good straight point.||CDR-EVA|Yes, we are.|06 18 02 09|LMP-EVA|Bob, the boulder concentrations in the wall of Henry have their upslope start at about - oh, I would guess an average of 30 meters down from the rim crest. The rim crest of Henry is not very well defined, but it's there. And they - from that initiation of boulders, they stream down the slope to the break in - in slope down at the floor. Still no obvious change in the dark mantle, as we're just to the east of Locke now. There's some - there's a 30-meter crater, fairly subdued but still quite deep - subdued rim. Again, it looks as if it were mantled; that - has no significant increase in blocks on its rim. That crater, in any other place, would have been a very blocky-rim crater. It has - its maybe 30 meters and- by 5 meters deep. Man, that is a big rock up there. Turning Point Rock is a split rock -has a - looks like a northwest-southeast overhang, with another block just this side of it - just to the south of that overhang. It's a pyramid shape in cross section - triangular shape in cross section. And it looks like it is pretty well fractured, although not pervasively like the rock at Shorty was.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Jack, I know I can get up to that - to station 6.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|I might drive up there.||LMP-EVA|Yes. Now, Bob, station 6 rock - one of them -is from that boulder track that runs obliquely across the contour.||||Tape 109A/8||||CC|Okay. I copy that, Jack. Sounds like good news.||LMP-EVA|And there's - the pictures ought to be able to -the pictures ought to pin down its - at least the end of the boulder track pretty well.||CDR-EVA|Boy, this is a big rock, Jack. Whew.||LMP-EVA|As I recall - as I saw it, the boulder tracks stopped about halfway up the slope of the North Massif. That is a big rock.||CDR-EVA|We're at Turning Point Rock. And it looks like it's - I don't know if it's mantled on top, but it's certainly filleted. There's a - a lot of the dark mantle up and on some of the shallower slopes of the boulder. And it's on a little mound itself, as if much of it might be covered up.||LMP-EVA|Yes. Okay. It looks like a breccia from here.||CDR-EVA|Can you get a sample of it right here? You see these little chips?||LMP-EVA|Yes, I probably can.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. I'm 3 meters from Turning Point Rock on the east side, and I'm reading l86 and 2.8.||CC|Roger. Copy that. Sensational.||LMP-EVA|Okay. You got to - can you drive up - -||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|- - to the - right there, let's see - no, I can get them. The thing is, I don't know what it is.||CDR-EVA|Well, but ... it's part of these fragments around here. I guess Turning Point Rock is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, - 6 meters high anyway. It's a - Well, I'd say it's a very rough subrounded type of rock -by the face - let me get this, Jack. Okay. There are two fragments in that sample.||CDR-EVA|47 Yankee.||||||Tape 109A/9||LMP-EVA|Plus some dirt. And it's about 4 meters from the -Turning Point Rock on the north side.||CC|Okay. Copy that. And presume you got some good photos of the rock.|06 18 06 21|LMP-EVA|Yes, I got a couple. I hope they're good.||CDR-EVA|Well, I'll tell you what I'm going to do here, real quick.||LMP-EVA|And my locator is - -||CDR-EVA|I'm going to do a - -||LMP-EVA|- - 5, 6.||LMP-EVA|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Jack, let me spin around this little crater here to the left.||LMP-EVA|Bob, it looks - it's very coarsely vesicular; but, at first glance, it did not look like the pyroxene gabbro - although the rock - that rock does. I -It looks like it might be fragmental, although I'm suspicious that I'm looking at zap pits. That'd be a - Oh, yes - Getting them. I got them. Pick one. That's a nice view.||CDR-EVA|And we're on a little rise looking at this boulder. That's incredible.|06 18 07 15|CDR-EVA|Okay. We're on the roll, Bob.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|You know that -||LMP-EVA|Bob, my guess is, right now, is that Turning Point Rock is a big piece of subfloor gabbro.||CC|Okay. I gather you changed your opinion.||LMP-EVA|What looked like fragments is just - what looked like fragments is just big spalls - spalls of where the zap pits have cleaned off the rock.||||Tape 109A/10||||CC|Okay. I copy that. And, guys, you might be happy to know that we think we've finally found the LM, because we were calling that for 188 and 2.8, and you got there at 186 and 2.8.||LMP-EVA|That's not bad. Okay - -|06 18 08 12|CDR-EVA|It's a split one up there, Jack. I've had ray eye on it. There's some big boulders down here.||LMP-EVA|Got it. I sort of lost track of station 6.||CDR-EVA|How, I got it. I've had my eye on that boulder. You can't see the track from here. I'll bet you can. I can see it now. We'll see it - we'll be looking right up it - looking right up the old boulder track. Man, I tell you, this navigating through here is not - -||LMP-EVA|Okay. We're in a region where the really - the general fragment population is no different. We're up on the - off the break in slope, although you wouldn't notice it - but we are quite a ways. And the - but the fragment population is not much different than that on the plains. The big difference is that there are these scattered blocks that are from a meter to probably 10 meters - no, 5 meters in diameter. Hard to say, maybe 8.||CDR-EVA|See that track coming down? We'll be looking right up that track.||LMP-EVA|Yes, yes, you got it. I didn't realize you were that far upslope.||CDR-EVA|Yes, we're way upslope.||LMP-EVA|Yes. Hit it.||CDR-EVA|Not very uncomfortable for me on this side. (Laughter) How do you feel?||LMP-EVA|Oh, I feel fine. I just - until I looked down there and saw the slope we're on.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I know it.||||||Tape 109A/11||LMP-EVA|And I can't see any obvious change in albedo, like we could see with the light mantle yesterday. You -you - You got a - don't - There you got a nice -nice place. Oh, oh, you don't want to go over that way.||CDR-EVA|I can make it. I want to park right - -||LMP-EVA|||CC|And, 17, you want to park at a heading of 107; we're going to open the battery covers and let them cool at the station. To a heading of 107-||CDR-EVA|107, huh? Okay. I'll get it up here.||LMP-EVA|Hey, that's going to be moderately level right there.||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Trouble is, they're looking into the shady side of the block.||CDR-EVA|Well, if I park on the other side, they won't be able to - I can go right upslope a little bit.||LMP-EVA|That's a.11 right. We can work in there. No, that's all right.|06 18 10 35|CDR-EVA|Yes, I can't go up there. Let me just - This is going to have to be good. I can't go up there.||LMP-EVA|I think you're all right.||CDR-EVA|That's not too level, but - -||LMP-EVA|Oh, not too - not too hard. Watch that turn.||CDR-EVA|That's not very level, but we're not going to get much more level than that.||LMP-EVA|Oh, that's good.||CDR-EVA|Let me - they wanted 107. That's the best I can do. That's not very level for the gravimeter, but - Let me see if I can get comm. Hey, Bob, how do you read?||||Tape 109A/12||||CC|Loud and clear, 17. How do you read?|06 18 11 24|CDR-EVA|Okay. We're parked on a heading of 107- Are you happy with that?||CC|Roger. Sounds great.||LMP-EVA|(Laughter) You parked on a slope, too.||CDR-EVA|There's no level - there's no level spot to park, here, though.||LMP-EVA|You want me - some help getting off?||CDR-EVA|I've got to go uphill.||LMP-EVA|I just about ended up down at the bottom of the hill.||CDR-EVA|Okay; 192/3.8, 3.1; 88 and 80; 108 and 0 on the batteries. The forward motors are 220 and 270, and the rears are 0 off scale low and 220.||LMP-EVA|You want me to block the wheels? (Laughter) You got the brake on, I hope.||CDR-EVA|You betcha. I don't know if I can lean uphill or not. (Laughter) I can't. Holy Smoley. Boy, are we on a slope!||LMP-EVA|You okay?||CDR-EVA|Yes, Let me get this thing set again.||LMP-EVA|I don't think you can ...||CDR-EVA|Boy, are we on a slope!||LMP-EVA|Okay. I'm going to stay out from between the rocks. It's a beautiful east-west split rock. It's even got a north overhang that we can work with. And let me see what it is. We're right at station 6. You wouldn't believe it.||CDR-EVA|I would. Oh, man, what a slope!||LMP-EVA|And this boulder's got its own little track, right up the hill, cross contoured. It's a chain of||||||Tape 109A/13|||craters track, and it looks like it stops ... where it started. It starts in, what looks to be, a lighter colored linear zone - trying to give you perspective; it's probably only about a third of the way up the North Massif. Bob, are you reading us?||CC|Read you loud and clear; and we got a picture.||CDR-EVA|Oh, man, I tell you, are we parked on a slope! I don't know whether your TGE's going to hack it.||CC|Okay. It'll pick up to 15 degrees.||CDR-EVA|Bob, this is a - Well, it is going to have it.||LMP-EVA|It's a coarsely vesicular, crystalline rock -finely crystalline. Looks like a - probably an anorthositic gabbro - trying to see the zap pits. For glass color, I.don't have a good one yet.||CDR-EVA|Say, Bob, you want both the recorder and the -and the other switch off?||CC|Roger. Both of those off, and the - -||CDR-EVA|Oh, man, it is hard to get around here.||LMP-EVA|Bob, it looks like the glass is fairly light colored. It's not white. Well no - it's black. It's anorthositic gabbro, rather than gabbroic anorthosite, I think. Yes, that's black glass in the pits.||CC|Okay. And, Gene, did you happen to notice the ... on the stuff when you dusted them?||CDR-EVA|I didn't dust it yet.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Bob, some of the vesicles are - they're flattened. All of them are flattened. There's a strong foliation of vesicles in the rock. Most of them are flattened, and they are up to 15 or 20 centimeters in diameter and about 5 to 6 centimeters thick - or wide.||CC|Outstanding.||||Tape 109A/14|||06 18 15 56|LMP-EVA|And there's some beautiful north overhangs all around the block. Well, (laughter) on the north side of the block.||CC|Okay. That's the best place - that north overhang; and I guess that means one of you guys might grab the SEC - the small can - before you leave the Rover.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. It's going to take me awhile to dust. I tell you - -||LMP-EVA|Okay - -||CDR-EVA|Hard to get around here.||LMP-EVA|Bob, let's get it straight. You w - want - let's get it straight, you want the north overhang sample in the SEC - or the short can?||CC|Miracle of miracles. They don't want the short can. I'm not sure I understand that, Jack, but they don't want the short can here, they say, I guess they're looking for volcanic today.||LMP-EVA|Okay, we'll put them in bags. Oh, man -||CC|They're looking for volcanic today, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Oh, they are, huh? We found those yesterday.||CC|Well, they're hoping again at station 9»||LMP-EVA|This is - Now, that foliation I mentioned does not go all the way through the rock. There are variations in texture. One zone was strongly foliated. There's another - It almost looks like a large - it is - a large inclusion of nonvesicular rock within the vesicular rock. There may be some autobrecciation involved in the formation of this thing. It really looks mineralogically like the light-colored samples from the South Massif. But I - I tell you, that's only because it's light colored, and I - I can't give you anymore than that right now, until we get a fresh surface.||||||Tape 109A/15||CDR-EVA|110 degrees on the SEP and you want the tape - the cover closed, right?||CC|Cover open, please. Cover open. Both off.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Cover's open.||CC|Okay. And did you get the batteries - -||CDR-EVA|Oh, my golly.||CC|- the LRV battery covers open. We didn't copy that, Gene.|06 18 18 20|CDR-EVA|No, I didn't copy that you wanted them open. I just got 107. I was about to ask you that.||CC|Okay. We'd like them open. And, Jack, while I'm interrupting everybody here, how about a frame count, if convenient.||LMP-EVA|Oh, shoot! Bob. I gave you one at the rock. It's now 68.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Man, I never - (Laughter) You can't believe how tough it is getting around this Rover, on this slope.||LMP-EVA|I think I'll - -||CDR-EVA|Man., that - I think we're probably pitch 20 and roll 20.||LMP-EVA|I think I'll get over here and get a pan while we're ... sample.||CDR-EVA|Oh, I got to dust those radiators. I can't leave them like that. I tell you, this is not a very good place to dust them, though. Let me try one time. Oh, boy.||LMP-EVA|Be careful, Geno. Need some help?||CDR-EVA|No. I need a little finesse, though. It's one thing to reach over - here and do this on level ground. I don't know if I can do that without falling on the battery.||||Tape IO9A/I6||||LMP-EVA|Well, I found a place to stand where I can take a pan.||CDR-EVA|Bob, I'm going to have to give you a good battery brushing at the next site. I can't get - I get half of them, but I can't get the other half. It's too slopey.||CC|Okay. We copy that.||CDR-EVA|But the covers are open. What are you working on, Jack?||LMP-EVA|I'm taking a pan.||CDR-EVA|Very good. I'm coining right now. I bet you a dollar to doughnuts that you don't get a TGE reading.||CC|Yes, Gene. If you're - if it's easy enough to take it off, why don't you take it off the Rover; and we'll try and level it in the stuff.||CDR-EVA|Oh, come on. (Laughter) I'm not sure there's any place to put it on the ground level.||LMP-EVA|No, you have to dig a place.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I'll do it. Okay. It's coming off. Well, I'll set it right up here.||LMP-EVA|It's going to fall down the hill. You'd better stomp off a good place.||CDR-EVA|Yes. That looks level to me. Can you see it from there?||LMP-EVA|Well, I can see it.||CDR-EVA|I mean, does it - -||LMP-EVA|I don't know. I have no perspective anymore.||CDR-EVA|I don't either.|06 18 21 34|CDR-EVA|MARK. Gravity.||CC|Copy the mark - -||||||Tape 109A/17||CDR-EVA|It's flashing. Okay; now let me get to work. Okay ... My fender got a little kinked here, which isn't going to help us.||CC|Hey, Jack. And we see your gold visor up? You may want to put it down out here in the Sun.||LMP-EVA|Well, I think I might - I can't see with it down; it's scratched. Bob, I'll use it.||CDR-EVA|I think I can monitor that one.||LMP-EVA|Hey, I'm standing on a boulder track. How does that make you feel?||CDR-EVA|That makes me feel like I'm coming over to do some sampling. Think how it would have been if you were standing there.before that boulder came by.||LMP-EVA|I'd rather not think about it.||CDR-EVA|Okay, let's go. You got a spot picked while you're here?||LMP-EVA|Well, the big thing is, let's get those - let's get the boulder and then get in that east-west split. Bob, I got an undocumented sample from the middle of the boulder track.||CC|Copy that. Soil sample?||CDR-EVA|Whew!||LMP-EVA|Soil sample. Gene, if you hit them off in there, it's going to be awful hard to find them, that's the problem.||CDR-EVA|Did you pick a spot - a good spot while you were over here?||LMP-EVA|No, I didn't. I just was looking at it. I think we need to get in the light, though.||CDR-EVA|I - I can see with my gold visor.||||Tape 109A/18||||LMP-EVA|Let me put a sample in your bag.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Go ahead.||LMP-EVA|It's bag - shoot - it's 534.||CDR-EVA|This boulder looks fairly uniform from top to bottom.||LMP-CDR|We've got to get a reference sample out - this soil.||CDR-EVA|Let's get where we can get that 90-degree picture, too; so we want to get on the - really ought to get on the Sun side. Let me get that slab right there, though, to start with. I can get that one off. Well, there's no - let's go over on the Sun side because we can't really photograph it.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I got to get out of here first.||CDR-EVA|Let's go through the split.||LMP-EVA|Well, okay. Be careful, though. Why don't we sample the split first so we don't - -||CDR-EVA|Look at that overhang. Man, I tell you, if you can get your shovel down there, you'd have a ball.||LMP-EVA|Yes, let's sample in the split first so that we don't get it too messed up. And then we can sample some of this stuff. Not - we want this overhang over here, Geno - the north facing one.||CDR-EVA|Ri^it here?||LMP-EVA|Yes. I got to get - sneak by over there. Whoops! Don't shuffle too much dirt in there.||CDR-EVA|Okay. You by me so I can set the gnomon down.||LMP-EVA|Not quite. Don't think I can make it - without hitting you. I can't.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Now try it.||||||Tape 109A/19||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Ready?||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Let me set the gnomon down - -||LMP-EVA|Set it down just outside the shadow here. Right -Whoa - rigjit there. That's good. There's still some good clean ground there. Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I can get back far enough to take these pictures. I want to go get a stereo pan around the comer anyway. Let's see if I can't start here with about 5/6. I'm so close.||LMP-EVA|Okay, I'll get a -||CDR-EVA|I must have a boulder ...||LMP-EVA|I'll get it. Let me - -||CDR-EVA|- I'm going to go around the cor - I got it now.||LMP-EVA|Okay. You got a bag?||CDR-EVA|All set.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I'm going to get the shadowed material.||CDR-EVA|It's in bag 312, Bob.||CC|Copy 312.||LMP-EVA|And it's - it's from - I think you saw where I got it. It's about a half a meter back of the limit of the overhang. Put it down. Put it down.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Can you reach it?||LMP-EVA|I will in a minute. You can turn it a little bit towards me. Okay; 312. And the soil outside the overhang will be next.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Go get it.||||Tape 109A/20|||06 18 26 57|LMP-EVA|And the first one is from the upper 2 centimeters.||CDR-EVA|Bag 313.||CC|Copy 313.||LMP-EVA|And the second one is from probably down - from 2 centimeters down to about 8.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Bob, it looks like the fragment just to the - or the boulder just to the south of us has some inclusions in it - light-colored inclusions.||CDR-EVA|Bag 472 on that.||CC|Copy 472 on that. You mean the south half of the split boulder?||LMP-EVA|Yes. I haven't seen inclusions in the other half.||CDR-EVA|Okay? Okay. Now we need boulder stuff.||LMP-EVA|You happy with that, Houston? Let's get ...||CDR-EVA|||LMP-EVA|Got your hammer?||CC|Yes, we're happy with that ...||LMP-EVA|It's a little hard, huh? I think - -||CDR-EVA|I've got to find a comer I can get at.||LMP-EVA|Yes .||CDR-EVA|Let me get an after picture down in this hole.||LMP-EVA|Oh, that's right. You almost stepped on the -I forgot the after, too.||LMP-EVA|Hey, there are chips up here on top. Also, that's been spalled off.||CDR-EVA|Yes .||||||Tape 109A/21||LMP-EVA|We can get some of those, but - -||CDR-EVA|Looks like somebody's been chipping up there.||LMP-EVA|Looks like there's been a geologist here before us.||CDR-EVA|Let me get the gnomon. I think I can get some of these pieces over here. I want to get that 90-degree angular flight line around this boulder, too.||LMP-EVA|Bob, the more I look at this thing - here's the piece that fell off. Here's the piece that was knocked off up there.||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Look at that.||CDR-EVA|We ought to bring a big piece of that home. That's obvious it's obvious - -||LMP-EVA|How about this one up here? Take your picture. I think we can just lift that off. See that?||CDR-EVA|Stand by.||LMP-EVA|I'd better get - -||CDR-EVA|I'll get a locator from here.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I was going to get my down-Sun, but I'm ...||CDR-EVA|You may be down-Sun if you do.||LMP-EVA|Yes, we'll get some. Get it?||CDR-EVA|Yes, will it come off?||LMP-EVA|Yes,||CDR-EVA|Just throw it in my bag. It's broken, but It's in place. That's a nice, big piece, too. It's about the size of a - -||||Tape 109A/22||||LMP-EVA|Don't you put it in mine. I can't get a thing in it.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Got it?||LMP-EVA|Yes, I got it.||CDR-EVA|Don11 move.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob, there's a big spall lying on the ground here that has been knocked off up there, from right on top of the boulder. And, I tell you, the more I look at this - the south half of this boulder, the more heterogeneous in texture it looks. It looks as if it may be either a recrystallized breccia of some kind, or you had a gabbroic anorthosite - magma catch up an awful lot of inclusions. I guess I prefer the latter explanation because of the extreme vesicularity of the rock.||CC|Okay; very interesting.||LMP-EVA|Now, some of the - a few of the inclusions are -well, they're all subrounded to rounded, and a few - and a few of them are very light colored. I'm going to try -||CDR-EVA|I'm coining around the corner ...||LMP-EVA|Are you going to do it now? Okay. Well, you know, I ought to get one shot back here with a black and white. I'll get this half-black and white.||CDR-EVA|Okay, if we could get -||LMP-EVA|I think we ought to pick up a piece of that spall there by the gnomon -||CDR-EVA|I can break it off.||LMP-EVA|There's one right by the gnomon we can just pick up. It's a finer-grained vesicular rock than -wait - where - -||CDR-EVA|Oh, oh, oh, oh -||||||Tape 109A/23||LMP-EVA|I thought I was going to get this half.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I don't care. I've started down, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Well, they like to have some of it in black and white, you know.||CDR-EVA|I'll get that rock.||LMP-EVA|I forgot to look at the objectives for this station. I hope we're meeting them.||CDR-EVA|Well, we want to get 500s of that boulder track. I know I want to get that.||LMP-EVA|Okay. A piece of that Spalled rock that was sitting by the gnomon - Ooh, watch out gnomon. How about that? - is in - bag 535 -||CDR-EVA|You got one in there already?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CC|Okay. We copy that one, Jack.||CDR-EVA|You won't be able to reach - you won't be able to reach my bag.||LMP-EVA|No, but you can put it in mine. Can you reach it?||CDR-EVA|Oh, darn it.||LMP-EVA|Bob, one of the light-colored inclusions looks like it may be anorthositic - gabbroic anorthosite -Let me get my terms straight. The host rock has dark enough zap pits that it's probably gab -anorthositic gabbro, if I didn't say that. Some of the light-colored inclusions have slightly lighter colored glass, and they may be the gabbroic anorthosite.||CC|Okay, I copy that, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Inclusions like this one and that one.||||Tape 109A/24||||CDR-EVA|Some of those inclusions get to be bigger than the size of a baseball. There's one here and a couple up there.||LMP-EVA|Let be borrow your hammer.||CDR-EVA|Yes. Jack, try a little higher. See that one right on the - right there. Rigjht -||CDR-EVA|Yes, that's a hard rock.||LMP-EVA|Yes, that's a hard rock. You might be able to do it; I can't.||CDR-EVA|I can't get down there. Okay, we need some of the soil outside the shadow here.||LMP-EVA|Yes. How about over where your bag went? Let's move around here - I think there is some - oops! Get on this slope over here. Okay. How about out over here? Are we supposed to get a -Where are we here?||CDR-EVA|I don't know. I'd like to get - When you face uphill, your camera faces down.||LMP-EVA|We want to get a rake on the rim of that little crater down there, I guess.||CC|Okay, 17* Roger. You were asking about objectives. Of course the primary objective is docu - documented samples of the blocks; and then, also, we'd like to get some of the rake and soil sample out in the surface, namely, the rim crater there, if that's available. And one of the things, of course, we're looking for is the variety of rocks here, if there's more than just the one boulder. You can sample the boulder for a while, but we would be interested in seeing if there is more than just the single type of rock. Probably, also, samples from both sides -both halves of the rock. What we said this morning in terms of combining stations 6 and 7 to an hour and 20 minutes -|06 18 35 18|LMP-EVA|Come on up here, Geno.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||||||Tape 109A/25||LMP-EVA|If you can.||CC|And so it's sort of your option as to how much time you spend here and how much you go on to station 7 and spend. If you feel that it's worthwhile, we could spend essentially all that hour and 20 minutes at this station. But if we did that, we'd like to get a fair variety of blocks, if they're available.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Geno, we sampled some of the light colored group - as a matter of fact, this block looks different.||CDR-EVA|Well, so does that big one - -||LMP-EVA|It's grayer.||CDR-EVA|That's why I've been photographing it.||LMP-EVA|What it is, I think - it's a big blue-gray rock -itself is crystalline, I believe. The inclusions are much more sharply defined, and it's nonvesicular; and it's included, or at least it's in contact with the very vesicular anorthositic gabbro -rigjit up there. See that?||CDR-EVA|Yes, the whole big one. I just ...||LMP-EVA|Did you get some pictures of it?||CDR-EVA|As I bounced around there, I took pictures of it.||LMP-EVA|Look, we can get some of that light-colored stuff in there, along with the blue-gray.||CDR-EVA|We ought to get as big a piece of that inclusion as we can. There's - -||LMP-EVA|See it up in there.||CDR-EVA|Yes. I think we're out of line of sight with them. We're behind a boulder.||LMP-EVA|Yes, sorry about that. But - -||CC|We can hear you loud and clear. We're just looking at rocks right now.||||Tape 109A/26||||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, the boulder dcwnslope is more of a light-gray vesicular boulder. The one Jack just talked about with some of the larger white inclusions is less vesicular, and it's a - more of blue-gray rock. And if I don't fall on nsy tail here, I'll get --||LMP-EVA|The locator is of Henry.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Okay, let me try and get up there. Henry? We must be hi^i enough to see something. I haven't even looked back.||LMP-EVA|Let me get a closeup before you start pounding.||CDR-EVA|No, I might go from this angle too. That will give them something a little different up in there too, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|We ought to try and sample that. Okay. Let's get the -||LMP-EVA|You want me to get my scoop under there? Probably won't fall out.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Get as many of these pieces as we can. I don't know how many are going to come out.|06 18 38 19|LMP-EVA|(Laughter)||CDR-EVA|Outstanding! Outstanding! This whole tiling wiu come out here in a minute.||LMP-EVA|I'll watch it. I'll watch it. Got it?||CDR-EVA|Move your arm up or down. Okay. I got it in case we don't get another one.||CDR-EVA|Hey, we're getting good at that.||LMP-EVA|Yes. Can't hold that much longer.||CDR-EVA|Let me get up on this - up here.||||||Tape 109A/27||LMP-EVA|Why don't we get a - get a bag out. Let me put these in a bag.||CDR-EVA|That's why I'm getting up here so I can - -||LMP-EVA|Oh, okay.||CDR-EVA|- - just get my balance. Bob, 556 is one of the light-colored inclusions in the blue-gray rock.||LMP-EVA|It1s chips.||CDR-EVA|Chips of it.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|I think we lost that other one. That's good enough.||CDR-EVA|I got it; I know where it is.||LMP-EVA|That's all right. It's not a lot of sample, but it's representative, I think. It looks a lot like that sugary rock I sampled yesterday, doesn't it? Found in the - that we sampled in the - -|06 18 39 43|CDR-EVA|Yes, it's pretty easy to break up; it's really not very coherent at all.||LMP-EVA|You know, I thought last night, Bob, that I should use the word aplitic for a texture that we saw in that inclusion yesterday on the South Massif.||CDR-EVA|If I could keep from falling on my tail.||LMP-EVA|Can you get a - -||CDR-EVA|I want to - -||LMP-EVA|Okay, you going to get some of that?||CDR-EVA|Yes, that's a different kind; that's a more beat up inclusion of some sort. Oh, there's a nice piece coming out. Oh, wait a minute - don't lose it.||||Tape 109A/28||||LMP-EVA|I got it. I've got it.||CDR-EVA|Got it.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay. We have another inclusion that, on the surface, has a more reddish-brown texture. Interior looks pretty much the same; it's a very li^it gray.||LMP-EVA|This looks like a piece of breccia Looks like a fragment briccia that got caught up in this thing.||CDR-EVA|Yes, well, the whole thing is obviously a breccia. I'd sure like to get that - -||LMP-EVA|Well, I'd say -I'm not sure; it's obviously a breccia. I think it may - may be an igneous rock with breccia inclusions.||CDR-EVA|Well, okay, but -||LMP-EVA|Which is sort of in the same class.||CDR-EVA|Sort of makes a breccia --||LMP-EVA|Well - -||CDR-EVA|- - out of the big rock.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Except you can - -||LMP-EVA|I can't get in there, Geno, you'll have to.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|No way -||CDR-EVA|Let me -||LMP-EVA|Watch it. Hold still - opps. I think it's easier for you.||||||Tape 109A/29||CDR-EVA|Did I give them a number on that? - No.||CC|Negative.||CDR-EVA|It's - 5 - 536.||LMP-EVA|Squash it - cramp it a little bit, if you can; a little more.||CDR-EVA|Did you get that 536, Bob?||CC|Roger. 536 for the last one.||CDR-EVA|Let's get a - -||CC|And -||CDR-EVA|Okay. Let's go get the host rock here.||LMP-EVA|How about that - How about that - whew - how about that piece?||CDR-EVA|How about this one, with the inclusion? Maybe I can get this one.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CC|Okay; and, 17, we'd like -||LMP-EVA|That may have been a little optimistic.||CC|Do you guys have a feeling that the two halves of the big boulder are different rocks? Or is it the same rock split?|06 18 42 13|LMP-EVA|No, they're - they're two - they were all one boulder, I think. They are just two major rock types in the - whatever they came from. And I tried to describe that to you. We have the contact in the control boulder. They're really three big boulders. The central boulder had the contact between the light-gray rock - or the blue-gray rock and the vesicular anorthositic gabbro.||CC|Okay. And you guys have that pretty well photodocumented, right?||||Tape 109A/30||||LMP-EVA|Yes, it's in pretty good shape. We're working on it still.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Try going on the side there, Geno.||CDR-EVA|Just went from the side, Jack.||LMP-EVA|That's enough. You got a piece of the - -||CDR-EVA|... host rock.||LMP-EVA|I think you can get this one up here, can't you?||CDR-EVA|I wanted that one cause it had that inclusion wrapped in it. Let me go to high here for a minute. Which one are you talking about? This one here?||LMP-EVA|Yes, I just - It's about to come. Oh - oh - oh, okay. I've got it. I've got it.||CDR-EVA|Okay •||LMP-EVA|.. . bag.||CDR-EVA|They're both host rocks; we can put them in the same bag.||LMP-EVA|No, let's don't. No, they're different places. 537, is a chip of the blue-gray rock; and the host - the blue-gray host rock - and let me get that other one -||LMP-EVA|Oh -||CDR-EVA|Oh - Be careful -||CDR-EVA|Pick the rock up while you're there. It's right at your hand.||LMP-EVA|I will.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||||||Tape 109A/31||CDR-EVA|... hammer somewhere.||LMP-EVA|Okay. And 538 is another sample of that material -a little dustier.||CC|Okay. We copy that.|06 18 44 57|LMP-EVA|That's the blue-gray - that's the blue-gray Bob, with the inclusions in it. Now the blue-gray, the more you looked at it, it looks like a - -||CDR-EVA|Give me your left - your right hand.||LMP-EVA|Huh?||CDR-EVA|Give me your right hand. Turn it over. Turn it over. Turn it over.||LMP-EVA|Well, I did. How do you want it over?||CDR-EVA|You kept turning it over in the same direction. Like that, so I can fix that. Okay. Now give me your bag, and I'll get it in there.||LMP-EVA|It - the blue-gray rock, on closer examination, looks like a partially recrystallized fragment breccia. It's very hard.||CDR-EVA|And I'm going to - -||LMP-EVA|Are you going to get the afters in there?||CDR-EVA|Yes, I'll get them. I want to do a little bit better documentation on this thing - Bob -||LMP-EVA|I'm going to go over and look at that contact.||CDR-EVA|I got a few closeup stereos of the inclusion that we tried to sample, and I'm going to see if I can't give you a little ... stereo around thia thing - if I can stay on my feet.|06 18 46 32|CDR-EVA|Do you read me, Jack, okay?||LMP-EVA|Yes, I hear you.||CC|Yes, Houston reads you loud and clear, also.||||Tape 109A/32||||CDR-EVA|You can see where we've been pounding on this rock. We didn't succeed in getting samples everywhere. And I'm giving you a 90-degree corner.||LMP-EVA|Bob, it looks to me like there are inclusions of blue-gray in the gabbro - in the anorthositic gabbro.||CC|Positively outstanding.||CDR-EVA|Are you saying you think this whole bit - You think this whole big blue-gray thing is an inclusion?||LMP-EVA|Yes, sir. And there's some little ones over here.||CDR-EVA|Yeah, but then within the blue-gray, we've got all these other fragment.||LMP-EVA|Well, that's right. It's just several generations of activity; and it looks like the gabbor though, picked up the fragmental breccia as inclusion. Bob, I'd - it really looks that way right now. There's a - -||CC|Okay, Charlie is here mumbling something about it looking just like house rock [?].||LMP-EVA|It's very crystalline. I'll tell you, it's not a breccia - not like house rock [?]. Not to take anything away from house rock [?], though.||CDR-EVA|Hey, Bob, there's a lot of mantling on a very shallow slope of a fracture here on one of the upslope rocks. I would assume it's just part of the ... picked up as its rolled down. But if it's worth sampling, you might think about it.||CC|Okay, Gene, if you can get that fairly readily, why don't you - You can perhaps just scoop it up with the bag.||CDR-EVA|That's exactly what I can do.||CC|If you can get up to the rock there.||||||Tape 109A/33||CDR-EVA|And it will be in my - It will be in my flight line stereo, and it's going to be bag 557* And I'll take an after and show you where it came from.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|This is the easist part of the rock in the world to work. Man, here's a big - here's a big white clast. There's one on top about a foot and a half across, and here's one - must be 2 feet across -3 feet. And that's in the blue-gray.||CDR-EVA|Feel like a kid playing in a sandbox.||LMP-EVA|Well, Bob, I think I've done the best I can. I would - I'd say that they're pretty clearly inclusions of blue-gray in the anorthositic gabbro here near the contact.||CC|Okay. And Gene, your bag is hanging by one hook there. Be careful, if you can - or LMP - -||CDR-EVA|Okay. I gave you 557, I believe. Didn't I?||CC|Roger. We have that one. And whoever is giving us 557 - -||CDR-EVA|Okay, I'll have Jack fix by bag.||CC|Yes.|o6 18 50 07|LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob, by accident - I didn't think I could do it but I got a sample of the inclusion. And it's in bag 539*||CDR-EVA|Hey, Jack, that's your bag that's hanging by one hook. Let me go get it.||LMP-EVA|Oh, they're talking to me, huh?||CDR-EVA|Yes, because I didn't - -||CC|Yes.||CDR-EVA|I didn't think they could see me. I'm way up on top.||||Tape 109A/34||||LMP-EVA|And it's blue-gray with light colored - -||CDR-EVA|Put these in my bag.||LMP-EVA|- - inclusions in it.||CDR-EVA|All right,||LMP-EVA|But the whole thing seems to be pretty well altered, or metamorphosed - compared to the major rock we sampled - to the other blue-gray rock.||LMP-EVA|This bag is terrible. I can't - it won't latch.||CDR-EVA|Man, there's a dark hole in there.||LMP-EVA|Don't let me - I'm not -||CDR-EVA|Here's another bag to put in there before you go.||LMP-EVA|Oh, okay. It won't latch.||CDR-EVA|Well - -||LMP-EVA|Not at this angle.||CDR-EVA|Put the thumb on one side, and I'll - -||LMP-EVA|It's dead or something. There, that's pretty good.||CDR-EVA|Now let me fix your bag.||CC|And, 17 - -||LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob, I think that inclusion will give you an example of what this thing - what the anorthositic gabbro did to the blue-gray breccia.||CC|Okay. We copy that. And we're ready for you guys to leave this rock and press on and either get the rake soil and cores near that crater down below the rock just a shade, or else go on to some other different variety rocks in the area.||LMP-EVA|Well, I tell you, going down to that crater is not a problem. Getting back up is.||||||Tape 109A/35||CC|Okay, well, find a decent area to get the rake soil from a couple of cores.||LMP-EVA|Tell you what, Gene, I could go down there and start a rake, and you could come down there.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I - Yes, I don't think you ought to try and walk back up, Jack. Let me get a pan from right here where I got this sample.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I'm going to come over and - I'll go get the rake and get the - -||CC|17, it's not that vital to get to that crater. We just need a good place for a rake soil and a double - a single core.||LMP-EVA|Get uphill a little bit, if you can, for the pan, so that you don't - so you see my other pan station.||CDR-EVA|Where was it?||LMP-EVA|It was over there in that crater, just uphill from the Rover.||CDR-EVA|I'm going up there.||CC|Hey, and, 17, we aren't all that gung ho about that particular crater, if it's that much of a Job to get down to it and back up. Just - we just need a decent place for a rake soil sample and a single core.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Bob, we don't move around from here too much. I tell you, these slopes are something else.||CC|Yes. We agree with that, from what we see on the television. So use your judgement, and get them where it's the best place||CDR-EVA|Well, you might take a look at me walking up. But I don't think I can get to the top. I just got to get a place I can get a pan from, right here. Right in this little hole. Okay, now I left the gnomon down there.||||Tape 109A/36||||LMP-EVA|Okay. I'll have to go get it. I think they're set up right here near the Rover.||CDR-EVA|I think I'll go and save some water, back on INTERMEDIATE. Okay.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Hope ny lens is clean. Bob, from up here, the li$it mantle is not evident -until you see the anglular reflection up on the scarp. Very thin-like patches might be evident out on the valley, but not nearly as pronounced as I might have thought from this altitude.||CDR-EVA|Oh, and there's Challenger. Holy Smoley. You know, Jack, when we finish with station 8, we will have covered this whole valley from corner to corner.||LMP-EVA|That was the idea.|06 18 55 20|CDR-EVA|Yes, but I didn't think we'd ever really quite get to that far corner. Not 2, but this other one. And we're going to make it.||LMP-EVA|Bob, that blue-gray rock near the contact with the anorthositic gabbro does get some vesicles in it. I think they'll show up in Gene's pictures.||CC|Okay. We have that too, Jack.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I just ran out of film at 160. And I'm about two pictures short of the pan, and they're upslope. I think I can cover most of that with the 500.||CC|Okay, Gene. You going to go to the Rover and change your mags now?||CDR-EVA|Well, Jack's going to need some help from me.||CC|Okay. Let me know when - -||LMP-EVA|I'm starting to rake.||||||Tape 109A/37||CC|Let me know when you get to the Rover to change the mags after you get done with that, and I'll tell you what mag to change.||CDR-EVA|Jack, if you got - -||CC|But press on and help Jack with those first.||CDR-EVA|Jack, if you got enough film, I'll just come and help you.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Remind me to dust my camera, too, will you?||LMP-EVA|Don't forget to dust your camera.||CC|Okay. We'll keep track of that for you, Gene.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Did you get any before pictures?||LMP-EVA|I'm getting them now.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|(Laughter) It ain't easy, McGee.||CDR-EVA|Man, I tell you, these slopes are great. I wouldn't mind being up on top coming down; but -hey, that boulder track is quite a trench.||LMP-EVA|Yes, sir.|06 18 57 26|CDR-EVA|That thing must be a meter or 2 deep, huh?||LMP-EVA|Okay; the big rake. Well, I think I'll try - -||CDR-EVA|Wouldn't it be easier to rake downhill.||LMP-EVA|It would, but the stuff wouldn't stay in.||CDR-EVA|(Laughter)||LMP-EVA|Right?||||Tape 109A/38||||CDR-EVA|Well, I don't know.||LMP-EVA|It's a thought.||CDR-EVA|Make sure you get that one by the - -||LMP-EVA|Yes, I will.||LMP-EVA|We're not really supposed to be selective about raking.||CDR-EVA|Well, you're not; you're just covering the area.||LMP-EVA|That's why I set up there.||CDR-EVA|A selective sample is better than no sample at all. Let me put some in there.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Bag 558.||CC|Copy 558.||CDR-EVA|Bob, most of them are - -||LMP-EVA|Let me go another couple of flights [?].||CDR-EVA|Okay. There's one a couple of inches. Most of them are an inch or so or smaller. They're angular to subrounded fragments. Some of them look like the inclusions. As a matter of fact, the ones that are broken open look like some of the ligfrt-colored inclusions we saw in the big boulder. The others are too dust covered to say anything about.||LMP-EVA|A couple of them look fairly coarsely crystalline. Okay. Put these in there.||CDR-EVA|Big deal. Now we ended up with three more.||LMP-EVA|Let me get an after, such as it is. Oh, we want the - -||CDR-EVA|They want the soil here.||||||Tape 109A/39||LMP-EVA|Soil - that's right.||CC|That's affirm.|06 18 59 46|LMP-EVA|Okay. You want to put that in?||CDR-EVA|Yes, I'd better put it in before I - Okay. Let's try for the soil. 559's the soil.||CC|Okay. Copy that. And, IT, our present plans from the back room are that we'd like to get the single core, the 500 millimeter shots - and, I guess, maybe one could do one, and one could do the other - and then we'd like to press on and do a short station T, unless you think you have, got a fair variety of rocks here. The feeling is to do that ... variety of rocks.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Little more, little more, little more.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. I'll get the core and let Jack get the 500. 559 is the kilogram of soil. I think we've pretty much covered the general, variety we've seen here. I think we've seen most of them in that boulder.||CC|Okay. And so we'd like to go on to station T, then, when you get the 500 and the core, in hopes of finding a variation of boulders along the front.|06 19 01 02|CDR-EVA|Okay. Let me know when you get it. Okay. The after. Okay, why don't you get the 500, and I'll get the core.||LMP-EVA|And the LMP's on 120.||CC|Copy 120 there. And, Gene, if you want to change, we recommended magazine Foxtrot or Fran, as the case may be.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Will try Foxtrot - Franny. Dont' forget to get that boulder track.||||Tape 109A/40||||CC|... And while you're at it, Gene, you might remember to ... when you're leaning over the seat.||LMP-EVA|Let me look at your camera.||CDR-EVA|Oh, man, if this Rover wasn't here, we'd roll downhill.||LMP-EVA|Hey, Bob, I think we could use an upper here if you want to save the lowers.||CDR-EVA|I think so, too.||LMP-EVA|Whichever you want. Do you want your - -||CDR-EVA|No, I'll get it. Why don't you get your 500, and I'll - -||LMP-EVA|Okay. But do you want a core? Watch the fender.||CDR-EVA|The core's in there, isn't it?||LMP-EVA|Well there's some under my feet if you want to use those.||CDR-EVA|I'll use those.||CC|Stand by, Jack. We have three lowers and two uppers, so we'd just as soon use the extra lower here in the single core. That'll give us two uppers and two lowers left - -||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CC|- - for doubles.||LMP-EVA|There should be a lower in there, Geno.||CDR-EVA|Yes, Bob, any special place you want that? Just out here on the slope?||CC|That's affirm.||LMP-EVA|Should ht.ve put the gnomon up. Well -||CC|Just out there on the slope. I guess if you saw a crater ... you might look at that, but primarily we're looking at the crater.||||||Tape 109 A/41||CDR-EVA|I'll get it. I'll get it, Jack. Don't worry. Okay. We have a couple of dents in our fen - in our wheels. That's better than having a flat tire.||CDR-EVA|Did he say in a crater?||LMP-EVA|I'm not sure what he said. Thinking - How do I get this doggone -||CDR-EVA|... to come off?||LMP-EVA|You got to unlock it.||CDR-EVA|Yes, it is unlocked.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Now push down and turn.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I got it.||LMP-EVA|How am I going to see up there to shoot this thing?||CDR-EVA|Well, why don't you lean against the rock? Go over there and lean against it.||LMP-EVA|Well, I have to do something. I was trying to get so I could lean against the Rover, but that ain't going to work.||CDR-EVA|The Rover isn't steady enough for you to lean against.||LMP-EVA|Well, it's steady enough. There's just no place to lean.||CC|Okay. And, Jack, and if you'll listen for a minute, I'll tell you some possible 500-millimeter targets the people have in mind. One, the LM, if you can see it from there. Two, Nansen, if you can see it from there. Three, Lara; and four, Shorty. In other words, I guess they're talking about looking along your traverse from yesterday. It would be mostly the back shots, apparently. And then, also, the South Massif, and I don't know what you can get of boulder tracks leading up the North Massif. And most of those will be looking downhill towards the LM, stations 2, 3, and 4. Over. Nansen, Lara, and Shorty.||||Tape 109A/42||||LMP-EVA|l I got you, Bob.||CDR-EVA|Yes, the LM is visible by the way.|06 19 05 27|LMP-EVA|Okay. I got a set of the - the - what looks like the outcrop from which the boulder came.||LMP-EVA|I'm afraid they're moved a little bit.||LMP-EVA|Oh, I can't - That's it. I got a few pictures looking up the boulder track and then off to the right - to the left a little bit - and one off to the right. And I think -I'm not sure how well they overlap; that's just an awful hard shot.||CC|Okay; good on that. And if you're done with that, have you got a frame count - or you're still taking them, I guess, it looks like.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Okay, r$y camera is clean. Magazine Foxtrot - is o: about frame 2, and I cycled through it. And I've got the core all set, and I'm going to go get it. And I didn't hear where you said to put it, Bob.||CC|Anywhere.||CDR-EVA|Oh, man, you're easy.||CC|And did you get your camera - -||CDR-EVA|Anywhere. Not the bottom of a small crater, huh?||CC|Any place. And did you get your camera dusted?||CDR-EVA|Yes. I got it all dusted and the mag's changed.||CC|Good.||CDR-EVA|It's 448.||CC|Copy that.|06 19 08 06|CDR-EVA|Okay. I'll even get you a picture of it.||CDR-EVA|Oh me. Oh my.||||||Tape 109A/43||CDR-EVA|Oh me. Oh my. Can you get the LM from there?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|That core went in very easy, Bob. I pushed it in about a quarter of the way. And about another five or six whacks, and it's in all the way.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Come on out now, baby.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob. Shorty, and station 3, and station 2, and what else.||CC|And any sort of outcrop you see in the South Massif.||LMP-EVA|I thought we shot those.||CC|Okay. If you got those, fine.||LMP-EVA|No, I mean the other day.||CC|Well - -||LMP-EVA|I'll try again.||CC|Stereo is stereo is stereo, I guess.||LMP-EVA|Okay, and I got you a little soil me - Well, but it's not stereo; it's right along the same line. Little soil mechanics of the hole, which stayed intact; very nice and round.||CC|Okay. We copy that.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Oh, man.||CDR-EVA|Yes, sir, we got a couple of dented tires.||LMP-EVA|Okay, hands have had it.||CC|Okay; good enough.||LMP-EVA|You aren't going to get anything else out of me if I keep taking pictures.||CC|And, Gene, what's a dented tire?||||Tape 109A/44||||CDR-EVA|A dented tire is a little - oh, a little golfball size or smaller indentation in the mesh. How does that sound to you? Doesn't hurt anything.||CC|That sounds like a dented tire; that's how it sounds.||LMP-EVA|Frame 31, Bob.||CC|Cappy - copy frame 31.||CDR-EVA|That1s s ort of like what it is.||LMP-EVA|Okay. LMP was what? 120? I guess we can get to the next station with that.||CC|Yes, Roger.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I got a brand new mag out.||CC|And we'd like to get you guys rolling as soon as feasible there.|06 19 11 29|LMP-EVA|Yes, sir. It's our policy.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I'll need your rammer, so if you'll just turn right.||LMP-EVA|Good timing. Pin's out; core tube is safe. In full.||CDR-EVA|I knew it was. Okay. You take this and put this under your seat, if you want, Jack. And I'll get the TGE. Oh, let me put your shovel back on for you. I'll get it.||LMP-EVA|Get that?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Don't lose that. Boy, if you do -||LMP-EVA|Okay. Did you give them the number?||CDR-EVA|Yes, they got the number.||LMP-EVA|Under the LMP's seat.||||||Tape 109A/45||CC|Roger. We got it. Copy that - under the LMP's seat.||LMP-EVA|(Laughter) I'm sneaking up on the TGE.||CDR-EVA|You need some help?||LMP-EVA|No. No, I was - just sneaking up, that's all.||CDR-EVA|... let you lean on me.||LMP-EVA|No, I got it.|06 19 12 51|CDR-EVA|670, 109, 801; 670, 109, 801.||CC|Okay. We copy that.||LMP-EVA|I wish we - the one thing I didn't do. While you're doing that -||CDR-EVA|||LMP-EVA|Didn't get pictures of those foliated vesicles. I don't think the ones you had were in that kind of rock.||CDR-EVA|I don't want to lose that thing, so I guess - -||CC|Okay, 17, when you get back on here, we don't need any charges, and we'll leave the sets turned off.||LMP-EVA|I'm not sure. Did you turn it off, Gene?||CDR-EVA|Yes, I turned it off. I turned it off. Okay. Let me see. We want to move on to 7 here. Rake, talus, documented core, you got your stereos, we got two pans, TGE, camera. Okay, we're going to head east and look for station 7 - block variation, contact change, and get a different sample of rocks. Okay, I sure want to get one or two of those nice ones in the big bag while you're over there.||CC|Okay - -||LMP-EVA|Open the gate, and I'll bring one.||||Tape 109 A/46||||CC|- - Seven - Okay. And let me know when you get ready to get back on the Rover there, 17.||CDR-EVA|Guess what isn't opening again. Should, though. It's all set right.||CC|You could put them under Jack's seat if it's easier.||CDR-EVA|Okay. What do you want done to the SEP while I'm here? Do you want the blanket stayed - left open?||CC|Okay, we'd - Negative. We'd like the blankets closed and taped down again, if possible, and both switches left off. We won't touch it again until station 8.||CDR-EVA|Oh, tape's not going to stick anymore, I'm afraid.||CC|Well, try.||LMP-EVA|Big bag open?||CDR-EVA|Yes, it's all open. All set.||LMP-EVA|Get me a - I need a normal sample bag for one here. It's pretty fragile.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Oh, that doggoned thing's not going to -That tape is full of dust now. Okay. Wait a minute, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Here, let me get this big one. I'm about ready to drop it. It looks like a gabbro.||CDR-EVA|There's sample bag 560.||CC|Copy 560.||LMP-EVA|And 560 has an undoc - undocumented except by tho pans - very white - looks like a crushed anorthosite. It looks like the - some of the inclusions in the breccia - in the gray breccia - gray and recrystallized breccia.||CC|Okay. We copy that.||||||Tape 109A/4T||CDR-EVA|Jack, when you get around, and we close this gate, you might try and hit that - top of that SEP down again.||LMP-EVA|I will.|06 19 16 30|CDR-EVA|Hey, Bob, you're staying keyed an awful long time. We can hear a lot of what's going on back there. Wait a minute. Let me get this out of the way. Okay. Close it. Yes. That's got it.||LMP-EVA|... it's -||CDR-EVA|That's got it. Okay.||LMP-EVA|Oop, oop, oop. Why'd that come off?||CDR-EVA|Well, because it's not locked. It's ... never was locked.||LMP-EVA|(Laughter) We lucked out.|06 19 IT 10|CDR-EVA|Okay. We're moving. Sort of.||CC|And, before you get on, remember to close the battery covers if they -||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Your camera lens looks all right, Geno.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I dusted it already.||LMP-EVA|Oh.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Cover closed -||LMP-EVA|Okay. Do they want it on or off? Leave it off, huh?||CDR-EVA|Leave it off, but try and close that cover as best you can.||LMP-EVA|Well, I'm afraid the tape has had it.||CDR-EVA|I know it.||||Tape 109A/48||||LMP-EVA|You want us to tape it again, Bob? What did you do with the tape?||CC|If you can grab the tape right off, but don't spend a lot of time on it.||LMP-EVA|What did you do with that tape?||CC|Let's worry about - let's worry about it at station 7, if we're going to worry about it. Press on.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Yes. Let's - let's forget it now. It's too hard, to work on there, and it's not going to take Just a minute. It's going to take too much time. I'm not sure I can get back on here.||LMP-EVA|Well, let me give you a hand. We need any a - we don't need any -||CDR-EVA|No.||LMP-EVA|Nothing. As a matter of fact -||CDR-EVA|I can drive, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Why don't you drive down and get - so you're not You can get on -||CDR-EVA|You can go downhill very easy.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Let me get the TV; The battery covers are closed - Let me carry - -||LMP-EVA|Why don't you just go down there.||CDR-EVA|- - I'll carry the Rover samples. ...||LMP-EVA|Got it?||CDR-EVA|Okay. I'll get that out of your way, too.||||||Tape 109A/49||LMP-EVA|Okay. I'll head down to that, ... that side hill over to those boulders right over there and then see if that's any change.||CDR-EVA|Okay. You might, if you get another sample - a large sample, you might grab it, and we'll throw it in the footpan here - and - and I'll see if I can't find a level spot to - -|06 19 19 l4|LMP-EVA|I sort of ought to have my scoop, too.||CDR-EVA|-- help you get on. No, don't take too much; just take that. That's all you need.||LMP-EVA|How about letting me have your hammer, then?||CC|Okay; and, IT, can you verify that the - that the gnomon is back in the Rover?||CDR-EVA|Gnomon is on the Rover. The TGE is on the Rover.||LMP-EVA|The rake.||CDR-EVA|The rake is on the Rover. The scoop's on the Rover. We got the - you put the core under your pan, right?||LMP-EVA|Yes, that's right.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I'm going to power up and see if I can't come down and get you.||LMP-EVA|It's fun walking downhill. Boy, that boulder track is impressive.||CC|Okay; and, IT, when you get moving - when you get moving we want to get, and I quote, a maximum variety of hand samples with a minimum amount of documentation, in a minimum amount of time at station 7. It's just an attempt to see what kind of variety we can get along the face of the front. Over.||CDR-EVA|Roger. Okay. Well, I'm not sure I can get down without ending up in your seat.||LMP-EVA|Need some help?||||Tape 109A/50||||CDR-EVA|No ...||LMP-EVA|I shouldn't have left.||CDR-EVA|No, no. I don't need any help. I'll get on.|06 19 21 00|LMP-EVA|I probably ought to turn my water off of MAX if that's where it is. It's cold. I don't want to run out today.||CDR-EVA|Well, the roll indicator says 15 degrees; and the pitch indicator says about 12. I don't know if I believe all that. Bob, you with us?||CC|Go ahead. Rigit. We're with you.|06 19 22 10|CDR-EVA|Okay. I'm rolling.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Man, this is still a slope. Jack, I'm going to pull around and in the front of the way you're facing.||LMP-EVA|I can go down - There's a crater over here. Don't drive through it.||CDR-EVA|Oh, there you are. This is much better. How is this?||LMP-EVA|That's great.||CDR-EVA|We ought to be able to pick up lots of those fragments out in that field out there.||LMP-EVA|Be rigjit with you.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Bob, I just came downslope reading 193/3-1 -just about 100 meters to pick up Jack.||CC|Okay, copy that.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Bag 48 Yankee has a sample of about a hall' -one-third-meter boulder that was lying in - that's sitting right smack dab in a little crater of it's own.||CC|Copy that.|||||.|Tape 109A/51||CDR-EVA|Oh, Jack.||LMP-EVA|What?||CDR-EVA|Oh, you Just kicked a snowstorm of dust across here.||LMP-EVA|I'm sorry. I just fell, too.||CDR-EVA|Did you? You all right?||LMP-EVA|Yes. Got your hammer?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|I got to drop it in the pan here. Hold on to it, I think.||LMP-EVA|Couldn't help that one.|06 19 24 12|CDR-EVA|Yes. I think we can get some more level spots. I can dust this thing back there.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 109B/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|06 19 28 50|CMP|Oh, I hope we got a pan camera picture of that -what the - Condorcet [?] or ... or something like that, the one I was describing had a little bit of diamond down in it?||CC|Roger.||CMP|Because what that - little diamond turned out to be with the binocs - It's a dome of material in there, and the reason it looks like a diamond is because you have slide material or talus-type stuff that's slumped down around it. And in that dome-type material, there are three or four black spots in it. I call it black; they're really a - I con -I kind of consider it a greenish - greenish black, you know?||CC|Roger.||CMP|I sure hope we - If - Why don't you check with Farouk and see if our pan camera coverage covers that - that crater? I think it probably did. That's an interesting one to take a look at anyhow.|06 19 30 12|CC|Ron, Farouk thinks it is on the pan.||CMP|Very good.|06 19 31 02|CMP|You know, in the eastern wall of Picard - I'm looking at it with the binocs now, and you can definitely see the first part of it up there has some vertical enscarpments [sic] - escarpments along the edge of it. And the vertical escarpments are kind of in irregular layers - well, just kind of like you would suspect if you - you eroded out a bunch of lava layers. In other words, they're noncontinuous, but they're kind of intermingled along, and they go about - oh, a third of the way down from the top of the rim, down to where the talus starts sliding on into the - into the crater.||||Tape 109B/2|||06 19 31 56|CC|Good show. We'll tie that - tie that up with what you gave us last time on Picard.||CMP|Okay.||CMP|All these dark-halo craters in the - in that one picture by that little diamond we've got up there by Yerkes. The one that's farthest to the south looks like an impact type of crater. In other words, you've got a definite ejecta lopping out around on those. The one that's hard to look at in the middle of my picture, but I think it's probably the second one down from the top. It has rounded ridges - rounded rims, and - coming up on the side here - I don't know if I am going to be able to see it until I go by it. It has rounded - a rounded rim. The ejecta pattern or the dark halo is about twice the size of the ... one crater diameter. And it doesn't - it's - it's either a highly eroded impact-type crater, or it's a volcanic-type structure. And, to me, it doesn't look like a highly eroded impact one. Again, that's a little one we can probably pick up ground truth, so to speak, off of the pan camera film.|06 19 35 38|CC|Ron, are there any similarity between the highlands, west of Crisium and those east of Serenitatis?||CMP|You know, I loo - that's just what I was looking at. And the ones east of - west of - well - yes, east of Crisium and west of - No.||CC|West of Crisium - -||CMP|What I was looking at was the - -||CC|- - and east of Serenitatis.||CMP|Yes, west of Crisium and east of Serenitatis. Those are different - seem to be a different type of islands, and I want - I want to check the other ones when I go by, but it looked like when I was coming up on - on those west of Crisium, they're more of a tan-type colors, smaller - undulations smaller - They have a corn-cob effect, I guess is||||||Tape 109B/3|||what you'd call it - what I call it anyhow. Smaller - smaller ears of corn or smaller mounds closer together as - as opposed to, when you get over to the landing site - The ones on the landing site seem to be more - raised, I guess. In other words, you still have a - a group of the small mounds and what have you, but they're a little more massive; you get more of an appearance of a dark flow - or a dark albedo between the mounds and between the blimps.||CC|Roger. Good show.||CC|Are you getting the landing site into view now?|06 19 37 34|CMP|I got it in window 2.|06 19 37 51|CMP|Okay. I've got Shorty in the - picture. It looks like a sharper crater than any of them in the Pentagon complex. The other thing that looks sharp, just like that one, is F Crater.|06 19 38 48|CMP|... back to the other window.||CMP|Did they kind of find that orange stuff on the north side of it?||CC|Let me check on that, Ron. I'll be back with you in a second. I don't think so; their stop was at -station 4 was on - -||CMP|... I'11 get ...||CC|Station 4 was on the south side of it.||CC|Just go ahead with what you see and - -||CMP|I'd say they just barely got into the stuff, then, becau - But it - but it looks like - kind of the north rim of it has more of a - a tint of a different color to it.||CMP|I ... my pictures.||CC|Is the color differentiation concentric around the -the crater or is it just in - in splotches?||||Tape 109B/4||||CMP|No. It's just in the - kind of the north side of it.||CC|What would you say the color is then? Is it one of the different tans?||CMP|Yes, the color - (chuckle) Yes, it's a kind of a different - Would you believe kind of an orangish -tan through this - mic - through these binocs? I got to take another look at that when I go by the next time.||CC|Roger. I'm with you.||CC|Ron, when you get back - when you get done with this, we'd like you to sketch - when you get a chance, the color variations - just some thoughts on where the color splotches are with respect to Shorty, in particular.||CMP|Okay. The - I'll do that when I finish up here.||CC|Roger. Did you get a chance to look at F Crater?|06 19 4l 50|CMP|Yes, F Crater Is - is sharp - just like - Shorty. I hope I was getting F Crater. F Crater is about the same size as Shorty, isn't it? If not, I was getting one between Family Mountain and -||CC|Just about the same size, Ron. Maybe just a tad bigger.||CMP|Yes.||CC|Ron, is there a cone associated with F Crater?||CMP|I didn't get a chance to look at it that much. I'll have to check it the next time.||CC|Okay. Have any thoughts on how - what's its origin?|06 19 43 02|CMP|I'11 have to look at F Crater again the next time I come over on the thing, because I spent most of the time looking at - Shorty.||CC|Okay.||||||Tape 109B/5|06 19 43 i4|CMP|You Know -|06 19 43 32|CMP|This - this formation again from - Tacquet on down to Menelaus or Melinor [sic]. Just went over that again, and I was looking at it with the binoculars, and I saw one sharp crater in the area that had a -an ejecta - almost the same color as the stuff around Shorty.|06 19 44 16|CC|Roger, Ron. You may point - pinpoint that crater between Tacquet and Menelaus when you ... down here.||CMP|Okay.||CMP|Boy, oh boy, D-Caldera is going to be - between all the windows.||CC|You have any flow scarps in that unit - near that Menelaus Crater?||CMP|No. I'll tell you what. There aren't any scarps there at all. That's why - That's another thing I was looking for, it's just a gradual degradation or gradual change in the color.||CC|You have any topography changes with respect to that color?||CMP|Yes, but the - the - No, the topography change is just a gradual - gradual change - with - There's a mound - There it is. I got to switch to all the windows.||CC|Are - are you able to get up on the D-Caldera?|06 19 46 07|CMP|Yes, I got D-Caldera into my sights now. The mound - ... in the center - are the same type of material - same type of material as that surrounding the D-Caldera itself. Down in the caldera, the gray blocky-type of stuff - and you know what? I'd almost say that - You know how water drops kind of form on a - on a - on a surface as you - as you - Have you ever had a high spot and something kind of slowed up - up to it, high spot - and water kind of flowed up to and didn't quite stick to it - you know it doesn't stick to it, all in one spot - -||||Tape 109B/6||||CC|Roger.||CMP|- - but it would leave a - a depression due to a surface tension as you come on up there - and then you have kind of a little - little bubbles that -float across there, and that's what that looks like to me.||CC|Roger. We copy that. Keep - keep going; that sounds great.||CC|How about the dark-halo crater west of the D-Caldera?|06 19 47 59|CMP|Hey, I'm finding out with - with the binocs, your observation is - is cut in about a half, and I'm going to have to get that the next time over.||CC|Roger. You think the dark halo crater is any relationship to those marelike patches in D-Caldera itself?||CMP|No, I don't think so. Just a - because the color differences are - or the color is completely different. So that - that's what - that's an open question on that one, and I'll have to find out the next time around.||CC|Any thoughts about the light-colored annulus around D-Caldera.||CMP|No. I couldn't see a light-colored annulus.||CC|Okay. Hey, we need a RECORDER, ON, here on the lunar sounder.|06 19 49 16|CMP|Oh, okay. Let's see. RECORDER is - The RECORDER is ON.||CC|Okay, Ron, let me read you some questions here real quick on D-Caldera. Determine the color difference between D-shaped expression and it's surroundings. I think you pointed some of that out. You got any more comments on that?||||||Tape 109B/7||CMP|Okay. There is nothing - surrounding D-Caldera that looks anything like the - the silver - silver-gray meterial that has depressed. It's definitely depressed with - with respect to the surrounding terrain. The little bumps that are in D-Caldera are the same color and the same - smoothness -kind of - smoothness as the rest of the material -the mare material surrounding the area.||CC|Okay.|06 19 50 17|CMP|I could not detect the - an external annulus around the caldera itself.||CC|Okay. Do - do you. feel that any of the material on the caldera is related to the material in the immediate vicinity?||CMP|The smooth-looking - let me get my picture - the smooth-looking - bumps in there are definitely -doesn't look to me like they're the same material as the stuff in the whole area.||CC|Okay.||CMP|They're smooth - tannish.||CMP|You know, if I look at that picture, the dark-colored stuff looks to me like it's a depression, you know? And it's - and it's the other way around. The light -light - the light-colored light-albedo stuff in the picture is the part that's depressed and the darker portions that look like the - the material surrounding the area is the part that's raised up.||CC|Roger. We copy that. ... on D-Caldera, do you have any view of any more of this terrain below you, or are your windows pretty well messed up?|06 19 52 17|CMP|It just got dark.||CC|Okay.||CMP|Yes, I - I stopped talking joist about the time we got to the terminator.||||Tape 109B/8||||CC|Okay. Good show.||CMP|Let me - let me go back to a map and make sure I was talking about F Crater.|06 19 53 03|CC|Ron, I think if you put an order of priority on some activity, as far as the geology goes, you might consider sketching out on Shorty - with just a rough handle on where you thought you saw some of the coloring differentiation up on the northern side of Shorty - and also give some thought on F Crater, if you will. I know you didn't get a chance to look at it because - If we can tie up the -what you see from orbit on Shorty to what we know we've got from the ground truth, we might really have something here, as far as matching up on some of these other craters.||CMP|Uh huh; that1s a good point.|06 19 54 04|CMP|Guess I can change the DAP here and get that out of the way.|06 19 55 04|CMP|Well, let's see, just kind of fouled that one up. Really wanted l42, narrow dead band, don't you, at 142, 269, and 0 - and 359? Thought we were already in that attitude.||CC|Ron, you might want to trim your attitude that -you were not to go to that VERB 49. That was the deleted at one thir - at 166:36. That VERB 49 was deleted, and your attitude is back to the -142, 269, and 359, and you might want to trim that up.||CMP|Okay. Just did it. Thank you, Bob. I'd have done it by myself if I hadn't ^one to CMC FREE, but I'd forgotten we were already in that attitude.||CC|Roger. No sweat here; you got a minute ir so before we're in the lunar sounder attitude for the Marius Hills there.||CMP|Okay; 166:42. i||||||Tape 109B/9|06 19 58 16|CC|And, Ron, you may be interested that, after we got the lunar sounder unsaturated there with the different attitude, we - we could detect the SEP in the lunar sounder data.||CMP|Oh, very good. Kind of proves it's working anyhow.||CC|Yes, that's for sure. Everybody seems to be pretty tickled with what they're getting so far. Just hope the film comes out as well.||CMP|Oh, I'm sure it will. People out at Goodyear out there at Litchfield Park do a good job.|06 20 01 39|CC|Ron, we got 30 seconds to T-start.||CMP|Oh, thank you.|06 20 01 50|CMP|OPERATE; she started at 42:12. Okay. RECORDER'S ON; RADAR is ON. Go to work.||CMP|9 - -|06 20 02 12|CC|MARK.||CMP|- - 10, 11, go. Hey, it worked out fine (chuckle). Must have hit it 3 seconds early.||CC|Roger. I still haven't figured out how to time this thing, I guess.||CMP|(Laughter) No, that was good. I got the mark the same time I did it.||CC|Okay, and you can relax, Ron, and I'll give you a call at 40 - about 30 seconds prior to 47:10, so you don't have to sit there and watch for anything.||CC|Okay, I'll -||CC|Got to earn my pay down here somehow.||CMP|(Laughter) Boy, you already have, I'll tell you.|06 20 06 37|CC|Okay, Ron. We're about 30 seconds from T - from LUNAR SOUNDER STANDBY time.||||Tape 109B/10||||CMP|Okay; 7:10, OPERATE to STANDBY.|06 20 07 06|CC|5 seconds.|06 20 07 09|CC|MARK.|06 20 07 14|CMP|Got it.|06 20 08 10|CC|Okay. There's your 1 minute, Ron.|06 20 08 16|CMP|Okay. RECORDER is going OFF, not to HEATERs.||CC|Roger. Good show, Ron. Farouk just came out and said a real good show. He's real excited about what you saw there, and we're real, pleased with it.||CMP|Okay. I think I said north and as I look at the map -the orange distribution goes generally about a - a crater diameter to the north, but it essentially starts - Well, if you'd cut a - on a 60-degree angle - from Dog Sierra at 63 - cut a 60-degree angle there and then - and then make that go around -out about a crater diameter.||CC|Okay. To the north at Dog Sierra at 63?||CMP|Yes, Dog Sierra at 63; that's on the 400-meter scale there.||CC|Yes, I've got it.|06 20 09 50|CMP|On TL-50. And, at the right-hand side - if you're looking at the thing from the bottom, the right-hand side is 0 - go up 60 degrees. You're 60 degrees up from the horizontal and 30 degrees down from the vertical. It'll be something about like that.||CC|Okay.||CMP|It had kind of a brownish-orange tint to it.|06 20 11 57|CC|Ron, I guess one of the things that at least t;oes through Stu's and my mind on that Shorty Crater -and I think you dispelled it when you say it goes out like in a 60-degree angular cone away from it.||||||Tape 109B/11|||But the question we'd really like to be thinking about - Is that a concentric coloring around there, like it might be just a layering from a flap ov -you know, a turned-over flap or something like that, or whether it just seems to be some sort of a - I don't want to say flow, but something that would give it direction that one - the one 60-degree direction like that.||CMP|Yes, I see what you're saying. And - It all -almost looked to me like it was gradational, as you, -as you went away from the crater. In other words, more - more orangish - more orangish closer - closer to the crater than as you got away from it.|06 20 13 05|CC|Okay. We're - we're ending up looking at future passes, not today probably, but for the future and see if we can fit in one or two more observations to you here, where we can set up the back room like we had in all the - if you'll go along with that, and if we can fit it in, would you like to do that?||CMP|Oh, sure. The crater that I described as looking comparable to Shorty, I don't think is the one on Family Mountain. I think it's the one on - bright dot - about the same size dot as Shorty on the 17-1 leadln for the - 17-1 for the landmark tracking.||CC|Okay.|06 20 14 15|CMP|I think Family Mountain is the bigger of the two mounds to the west of the landing site, isn't it?||CC|Stand by a minute, Ron. Let me clarify that. Roger, it's west of the landing site, and I believe it's the bigger of the two.||CMP|Yes. Okay. The one that I said-that looked like Shorty is kind of between the two mounds, and that1 s the one I looked at.||CC|You say it looked like Shorty or looked like the other one?||CMP|- - ... a little bit.||||Tape 109B/12||||CC|F Crater or Shorty?||CMP|Looked - looked like Shorty.||CC|Okay.||CC|Ron, we'd like the TANKs and 3 FANs to ON, please.|06 20 15 48|CMP|Okay, H2 TANK 2 FAN is ON now; TANK 3 FAN is ON.||CC|Roger. Thank you.|06 20 16 53|CC|Ron, I just might draw your attention to the Flight Plan at 167:20, in that area where the lunar sounder finishes up, and it says that there will be no SIM bay or PCM data recorded until 169:03 and then you have to configure the DSE there. Just want to draw your attention to that.||CC|Okay. That's a good point.|06 20 17 33|CMP|Hey, when you all drew that 60-degree angle, were you making that 63 degrees up from - not 60 -60 degrees up from line 63?||CC|Yes. I - I didn't know how to handle on 63, but I took a point at Dog Sierra and 63 and kind of -caught - created a 60-degree cone away from the crater at that point.||CMP|No, you want to create a semicircle. That's the center of the sem - Well, let's see. With the flat half of the semicircle along the line that goes through Dog Sierra 63 and Dog Whisky 57.||CC|Dog Whisky 57? Roger.||CMP|Right.||CC|Okay. I've connected a line - -||CMP|Connect a semicircle to the right of that line.||CC|Okay. To the right of that line or - to the north side of that line?||CMP|Yes. Actually, it will be kind of to the northeast, but to the north side of it, yes.||||||Tape 109B/13|06 20 22 03|CC|Ron, we're going to lose you shortly, and all the systems look GO here. I've got a bet with EEC0M that you'll get everything in the Flight Plan. You won't miss anything for me.||CMP|(Laughter) Okay. We'll try. Hey, before I go, take a look at Crisium and Serenitatis, 3 of 5; and the second one down from the top - or second one from the north, is the one I was looking at as that - is described as - as a partially subdued and - I mean a rounded-type thing with - with the kind of breaches in the side of the wall - what I consider breaches in the side of the wall.||CC|Okay. We got it. Crisium, 3 of 5, second one from the north, huh?|06 20 22 47|CMP|Yes. And the other one's not even circled; it's just north of the - the one in the bottom, and that's the one that even shows up on here and the -impact-type, because it's got ray - ray material, but it's a fresh impact bringing up bluish -bluish-type material.||CC|Okay. Good show. You're - you're saying that the two of them are distinctly different from - when you're viewing. One's impact and one is possibly volcanic ...||CMP|Yes. Right.|06 20 23 20|CC|Good show.|06 20 46 XX||BEGIN LUNAR REV 4l|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 110A/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|06 19 24 10|LMP-EVA|Couldn't help that one.||CDR-EVA|Yes. I think we get some more level spots, I can dust this thing back there.||LMP-EVA|Am I really on?||CDR-EVA|You're higih. You're twisted. Go away from me one twist.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Is it caught in something? Yes, it is. You're -Hold it - wait a minute - get up, get up, get up. You've got - you're sitting on - get up.||LMP-EVA|What am I sitting on?||CDR-EVA|Can't get out. You didn't put this away. Wait a minute. Get up, out - all the way.||LMP-EVA|Oh, that thing.||CDR-EVA|Yes, this thing.||LMP-EVA|That's right. That's where it's setting high. I knew I'd forget that. Okay. Now, let me get this thing out. Okay. Okay. Let's press. Better get latched.||CDR-EVA|Okay. All set?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Okay.|06 19 25 36|CDR-EVA|We're rolling, Bob.||LMP-EVA|LMP frame - is 130.||CDR-EVA|You got a lot of static now?||LMP-EVA|Yes .||CDR-EVA|Okay.||||Tape 110A/2||||LMP-EVA|Hey, you got a rock on your right. I guess you - -||CDR-EVA|Yes. I got them.||LMP-EVA|||CDR-EVA|I got the low gain set. Hello, Houston; Do you read?||CC|Roger. We read loud and clear.||CDR-EVA|Okay.|06 19 26 10|LMP-EVA|Okay; how about that field, not this block but there's sort of a collection of them - -||CDR-EVA|Yes. Way out there - -||LMP-EVA|- - way out there, about 300 meters or so.||CDR-EVA|Oh, at least. Yes.||LMP-EVA|Oh; going into the Sun, I can't see a thing to tell you about Wessex Cleft.||CC|Okay. Station 7 is nominally 208 and 3.3, but it's any group of any significant boulders you want to stop at in reality.||CDR-EVA|Understand.||LMP-EVA|Oh, easy.||CDR-EVA|You feel like you're on a downslope over there?||LMP-EVA|Yes. I feel like you're about ready to spin out downhill any minute.||CDR-EVA|Do you? I don't feel that at all up here.||LMP-EVA|Bob, it's hard to give you much, looking into the Sun the way we are.||CDR-EVA|We must be about 200 meters up the slope, looking at that little valley down there, Jack. Am I right?||||||Tape 110A/3||LMP-EVA|Yes. I think you're rigjit. The pattern on the slope really doesn't look much different than on the light mantle. Matter of fact, it looks very much like light mantle, except for these large blocks that are in it.|06 19 27 23|CC|Okay. Copy that. And you guys may still have your visors up. We can't tell, but you might be better off with them down, if you've forgotten they they're up.||LMP-EVA|Well, boy, I can't see. My hands work just as well as ray visor, as a matter of fact.||CDR-EVA|No, I can't believe - mine could be up.||LMP-EVA|You've got a crater right in front of you.||CDR-EVA|Yes. I got it.||LMP-EVA|Okay. That looks like a pretty good pile to work on.||CDR-EVA|Yes. Let's go over in there.||LMP-EVA|Hey, wait a minute. Okay.||CDR-EVA|Bob, what heading are you going to want me to park on? I want to get in that flat area, Jack, sol can dust the radiators.|06 19 27 57|LMP-EVA|Yes.||CC|We have no constraints, Gene. This is going to be a very short station. Probably not more than 10 or 15 minutes. But just to grab, as I say a maximum variety of hand samples with a minimum amount of documentation and a minimum amount of time.||CDR-EVA|Okay. We can do a pan, and pick up a lot of those small ones, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Rather than trying to chip.||CC|Okay. We would like to have the - -||||Tape 110A/4||||CDR-EVA|I'd like to see us a little more level.||CC|- - TV camera and its mirrors and stuff dusted there, however. But we won't do anything to the battery.||LMP-EVA|I thought you were going to stop back there.||CDR-EVA|Well, okay. I was going out - out here around this big one.||LMP-EVA|I'm sorry. I misunderstood you.||CDR-EVA|Yes. See, there's a lot of little ones up in here I want to -||CDR-EVA|Okay. Do not do anything to the batteries. Understand.||CC|Roger.||LMP-EVA|I can't figure out where you're going to stop.||CDR-EVA|Right in here - right here to give you as much of a level spot as I can. That's about as level a spot as I can find. I'm inside the slope of a crater.|06 19 29 05|CDR-EVA|Bob, I'm at 200/3.3.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|You want me to help you with it - that thing, Geno?||CDR-EVA|No, I'll get it. Only one guy can do it.||CDR-EVA|I just - we'll take - you take a pan before, and we'll start picking up some of those samples, and I'll take a pan afterward.||LMP-EVA|Well, let's see here.||CDR-EVA|See what kind of variety we can get here.||LMP-EVA|There is another one of our blue-gray breccias , I think, over there; recrystallized breccias with some of that crushed anorthosite in it. I think right in here I'm going to take the pan at about - -||||||Tape 110A/5||CC|And, Jack, what's your frame count?||LMP-EVA|131.||CC|Okay. Press on.|06 19 30 23|LMP-EVA|Bob, I'm going to take the pan at 11 - feet, so you can see the fragments that we are going to pick up here. Then we can take another one'at -for location work.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Should have it, Bob.|06 19 31 09|CC|We've got a TV. And, I repeat, we'd like to get some dust both on the mirror- dusting of the mirror and the lens of the TV; TCU and the TV.||CDR-EVA|Let me get you - let me get you out of the Sun.||CDR-EVA|I wouldn't do this for anybody but you, you know that.||CC|Okay. Looks good, Gene. Thank you.||CDR-EVA|You know what? I'm getting tired of dusting. My primary tool, the dustbrush and the hammer - and my head. Okay. You ready to start picking?||LMP-EVA|Picking.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||CC|And - -||CDR-EVA|You notice the temperature difference with that high Sun angle?||LMP-EVA|Yes .||CC|Roger. You're probably letting in a lot of infrared through that - without having that gold visor down, too. That's sort of an infrared shield||CDR-EVA|Yes, but mine's been down all the time, Bob.||CC|Copy that.||||Tape 110A/6||||CDR-EVA|Except in the shade.|06 19 33 09|LMP-EVA|Okay, 5^0 is the first bag of selected samples.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I'm going to leave it open, but don't let me - let me get -||CDR-EVA|Here, put that one in there.||LMP-EVA|Wait a minute, let's get a bag on it. We're getting too many rocks, and we don't know where they came from.||LMP-EVA|I don't think it will fit. Know it?||CDR-EVA|Yes, we'll wrap it a little bit. ... it will fit. ... fit.|06 19 34 03|LMP-EVA|Okay. Bag 5^1 is partially around smother big rock in Gene's - Gene's collection bag.||CDR-EVA|Did you get pictures of this thing here?||LMP-EVA|Yes; well, not the big rock yet. Not in focus anyway.||CDR-EVA|I got to do that.||LMP-EVA|I was just collecting in this area.||CDR-EVA|Why don't you keep grabbing a few, and I'm going to--||LMP-EVA|That's what I'm doing.||CDR-EVA|That's one of the blue-gray rocks, Bob. And it's got a light-colored fragment that runs the full heigjvt of it, about a meter and a half thick. And then it's got the gray or blue-gray rock on the other side. As a matter of fact - Let me look at it closely. It's a fragment in it all right.||CC|Okay. Copy that, Gene. And remember to document around the corner at your ... get some photo documentation of the boulder.||||||Tape 110A/7||CDR-EVA|Bob, I wouldn't be absolutely positive, but it sure looks like I see.a dikelet In here that's in the inclusion. And I'm going to get a closeup stereo of it. I'd call it a dikelet, if you pinned me down.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Pin him down.||CDR-EVA|I wish I could break a sample right off. Here's another one. It is a dikelet! There's three or four of them.||CC|Okay. Copy that, Gene. Very good.||CDR-EVA|Oh - me; oh, wy. The material in the dike looks -Yes, it is, it is, it's not covering it. It's between the - it's between the - lighter colored rock, and it's the blue-gray rock.|06 19 37 05|LMP-EVA|542 is another bag of goodies.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Gene, let me get rid of this.||CDR-EVA|Oh, wait a minute. I got - I got - Well, maybe it isn't a dikelet. Maybe it's just a screen covering, a flow covering.||LMP-EVA|No, you got - They're - they're dikes.||CDR-EVA|Let me - let me -||LMP-EVA|They're little veinlets of -||CDR-EVA|Let me get this whole thing in a bag.||CDR-EVA|I got a - I got a rock, Bob. It's fractured, primarily around the dike. It's in several pieces, but we're going to put it all in one bag.|06 19 37 35|LMP-EVA|543.||CDR-EVA|Some of the men are going to have to assemble that.||CC|Copy, 543.||||Tape 110A/8||||LMP-EVA|Here.||CDR-EVA|Here, I got - I got - Let me get it piece by piece.||LMP-EVA|Okay. We need to get a - put one of those dikes in another bag. Bob, it looks like some fraction of the blue-gray material has obviously - -||CDR-EVA|Not too full. That's all right.||LMP-EVA|- - intruded. Huh? Now, can you get that dike there? Piece of it?||CDR-EVA|That's right. Yes.||LMP-EVA|Can you get that?||CDR-EVA|I can get it right here.||LMP-EVA|No, I think - No, get the piece with the - you get more of it, right there.||CDR-EVA|Yes. It's this soft, white inclusion again. It breaks pretty easy.||CDR-EVA|Oh, it's got to be a dike. Look at that.||LMP-EVA|It is . It is .||CDR-EVA|Okay.|06 19 38 40|LMP-EVA|Okay, 544.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Oh, yes, it is because I just broke into it.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|I'm looking - -||CC|And we'd like to have you guys moving again in 5 minutes to get to station 8 on time.||LMP-EVA|Yes, sir. Looks like - although the blue-gray up on the hill looked like a fragment breccia, if this is still related, then it's - been some partial melting at some time.||||||Tape 110A/9||CDR-EVA|There's a preserved contact between the dike and the - -||LMP-EVA|That's what I wanted.||CDR-EVA|- - white material.||LMP-EVA|That's what I wanted.||CDR-EVA|Why don't we get this big piece of dike now?||LMP-EVA|See if you can get - Whoa! Don't hit it again. There, you've still got some - still got some contact there.||CDR-EVA|Now, there's some good contact. Man, that'll do it.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|that'11 do it.|06 19 39 32|LMP-EVA|Dike and intruded rock In 544. Now, these dikes are a dark bluish-gray. And it looks like there are some - it looks like they're very finely crystalline - maybe with some - -||CDR-EVA|Get ny bag. I'm taking some closeups.||LMP-EVA|- - very fine phenocrysts.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CC|Okay. We copy that.||LMP-EVA|We ought to get - Well - we ought to get a piece of the normal gray that the dikes are coming from. You got your hammer handy still?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|||CDR-EVA|I want to get this - -||LMP-EVA|Go ahead.||||Tape 110A/10||||CDR-EVA|- - finish documenting this thing.||CDR-EVA|Ah-hah! Ah-hah!||LMP-EVA|Hey, over here on this side, it looks like the vesicular anorthositic gabbro.||CDR-EVA|I got to get some regular pictures on this set. Okay. Here's the - if that one won't come off, this one will. Got it?|06 19 40 38|LMP-EVA|And - Yes. 561. That's a sample of the gray, looks like recrystallized breccia that the dikes are continuous with.||CC|Okay. And a -||LMP-EVA|"And a - Bob, that's my turn to say ""and a."" And the - the vesicular rocks -"||CDR-EVA|Let me finish the stereo around the corner here.|06 19 4l 19|CC|Okay. And you guys have dropped the scoop there on the ground. And we're ready for you guys to leave.||CDR-EVA|I know you are.||CC|And you might grab one FSR on the way out.||CDR-EVA|Okay. We'll do that.|06 19 4l 39|LMP-EVA|Okay. There's that one. The vesicular anorthositic gabbro is in 5 - What is it? 62.||CDR-EVA|62.||CDR-EVA|I'll get this in there, and you take the -||LMP-EVA|I got to get the scoop.||CDR-EVA|Scoop, and I'll get the hammer. Then make sure your bag is closed.||LMP-EVA|Yes, I've got to check yours, too. Let me get uphill from you, though.||||||Tape 110A/11||CDR-EVA|Wait a minute. Give me the hammer. Hows that? Can you get it now?||LMP-EVA|This is one of the worst bags we've had - packing. It just doesn't stay down. Probably - If we get time somewhere, we ought to change that out.||CDR-EVA|Two of the corners are - -||LMP-EVA|Yes. Well -||CDR-EVA|How's she doing?||LMP-EVA|It's okay. It'll hold for a while.||LMP-EVA|Okay.|06 19 42 52|CDR-EVA|Okay. Here's an FSR that's about -||CC|And, Jack, you're untied on one - one side of your bag is undone again.||LMP-EVA|Oh, I'll get it - for you.|06 19 43 09|CDR-EVA|Here's a football-size rock that was 50 percent varied.||LMP-EVA|Can you grip it? I got the gate open.||CDR-EVA|I'm going to get your bag. Hey! Did you see the way I handled that hammer?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Tell you what, I'm getting accustomed to things.||CDR-EVA|That gate's a little sluggish, too, Jack.||CDR-EVA|Boy, I think everything is so full of dust, nothing wants to move any more.||LMP-EVA|Okay. That one looked like a piece of the gray rock, I think.||CDR-EVA|Yes. I'll bet I didn't push the gravimeter here. Did I, Bob?||CC|No. We'll get it at station 8.||||Tape 110A/12||||LMP-EVA|No. They didn't tell us to.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Jack, you're going to have to close the gate, and I'll have to hold the big bag over the top.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CC|Okay. And, Jack, before you leave, we'd like you to change mags before you get to - before you leave this station.||LMP-EVA|Yes, sir. I'll do that. No. ...?||CDR-EVA|Wait a minute.||LMP-EVA|I've got it.||CDR-EVA|Yes, but don't push.||LMP-EVA|I won't.||CDR-EVA|One of those little ... strip - Okay, now you can push. Okay, that's blocked. Well, it's in. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Let me see what's going on in there. Oh, - we - this thing isn't - didn't - isn't released all the way. Pull it out this - That's it. Push. Okay, now -||LMP-EVA|There, you got it. It went in.||CDR-EVA|Okay, that's the dust again. Now, the bag's in the way. Let me get the bag out.||CC|Okay. And, Gene, you might get the -||CDR-EVA|Okay. Now shove it. That's too much. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Let me -Okay, Let me lift it up and do it. Well, wait a minute, I've got to tweak this thing. Okay, now shove it in. Right now.||LMP-EVA|That got it. No? Why don't you play with it, and I'll see if I can change a mag.||CDR-EVA|Well, dadgummit! That latch is -||LMP-EVA|... ?||||||Tape 110A/13||CDR-EVA|I'll lock it. I'll just push that latch - that latch is just sticking, that's all. It's just dust, I guess. I don't know what you do about those problems.||LMP-EVA|Okay, what magazine did you want, Bob?||CC|Magazine Mike, as in Mary.|06 19 45 56|CDR-EVA|Okay. It's latched.||CC|Gene, you might spend your time taking a - -||CDR-EVA|It's latched.||CC|- - standard 74-foot pan while Jack is changing his mag, if you got a chance there.||CDR-EVA|That's a splendid idea, sir. And that's exactly what I'll do. I don't mind going uphill, because it's so much fun coming down. Down in my little hole here. Oh! That's stability. That's stability.||CDR-EVA|Boy, Challenger looks a long way away. That's 3 kilometers, huh?.||LMP-EVA|Yes.|06 19 47 26|LMP-EVA|Okay. Mag's change d.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Bob, those two bags with the goodies in them will have enough soil to be representative of the area we sampled, too, I think.||CC|Okay, copy that. And did you guys get your bags fixed up there, Jack? We were concerned about your SCB for a while.||LMP-EVA|No. We have to do that.||CDR-EVA|We'll do it.||CC|Okay.||||Tape 110A/14||||LMP-EVA|Look at ny camera lens and see how dirty it is.||CDR-EVA|Now it's the other hook that came - turn a little more left. No, it didn't - it didn't come off, I don't think - unless it - the bottom's off, but the bottom is not going to stay up. And it's not -you're not going to lose it. The tops are so tight you'll - Your bottom's loose, but that -that's because your harness shrunk a little bit.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CC|Okay. It looked like, from time to time, guys, that only one of Jack's hooks was hooked. On the top.|06 19 48 37|CDR-EVA|Yes. They're both on, and they're both tight. And - -||CC|Okay. We copy.||CDR-EVA|- - I got the bottom hooked again, too.||LMP-EVA|Yes . Okay.||CDR-EVA|Bottom - but his bottom is not going to stay.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Check my lens.||CDR-EVA|Oh, your lens is beautiful!||LMP-EVA|... What's mine look like? Can you see it?||CDR-EVA|Yes, I know it's clean. Let's forget it.|06 19 48 58|CC|Okay; and, 17, as you get around to the front there, Gene, would you dust the LCRU; we don't think you did that here, and the top of the TV camera. And, Jack, would you take a peek at the SEP temperature for us?||CDR-EVA|I'm sorry, Bob. I already did that when we stopped at the station.||CC|Okay. It's ... - -|06 19 49 17|LMP-EVA|SEP temperature is about 115-||||||Tape 110A/15||CC|Copy. 115•||CC|Okay, then. Press on.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Jack, this is tied down everywhere. You're just going to have to watch it.||LMP-EVA|I will. Okay, I'm in.||LMP-EVA|Hey, we seem to do an awful lot of down-Sun driving for - or up-Sun driving for all the planning we did||CC|Yes. Wait until we come home from station 8, then we'll take care of it.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||CC|And, Gene, as you get started there, we'd like a couple of Rover battery temperatures; at least one, we know what the other one says. And, Jack, we might get a frame count from you - Oh, excuse me, we already got that. Thank you, because it's changed.|06 19 50 48|CDR-EVA|Well, okay, 110; and CDR, by the way, is about 73 on the frames.||CC|Copy that.|06 19 51 00|CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. I'd like the range and bearing to the -We're roll - we -||LMP-EVA|How did you get in reverse?||CDR-EVA|I don't know.|06 19 51 09|CDR-EVA|Okay. We're rolling, and I'd like the range and bearing to the next -||CC|Okay. We want a heading of around 1 - we want a heading of around 125, and there's going to be a short - a small turn, I think it's at crater -the SWP Crater at 225 and 3.4, there'll be a slight turn. That's a heading of 125 is what you should start out on.||||Tape llOA/16||||CDR-EVA|That's what I'm looking for.||CC|And 225 and 3.4 -||CDR-EVA|I though we were bypassing -||CC|No, we just do that - -||CDR-EVA|I thought we were bypassing SWP.||CC|-- to ... the planning stages.||CDR-EVA|225 and 3.^. Okay.||LMP-EVA|That's pretty close to nominal.||CDR-EVA|Yes. ... got my - Man, I tell you, this little navigation map I've got on ny hand - cuff checklist is - is unquestionably the greatest thing that I've ever - done.||LMP-EVA|Sure hard to tell where north is on it, though.||CDR-EVA|Trying my best to keep you out of those slopes.||LMP-EVA|That's all right. I'm learning to tolerate it.|06 19 52 27|LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob. We're pretty close now to - no, really not. We're still about 100 meters, I think, from where the break in slope is - with the flank. And - but we're away from the block population except for scattered - two great big blocks out ahead of us, this side of the SWP Crater. And -but the average population is down to the 1 percent or less, again.||CDR-EVA|That average population really never changed up in here. Just the big blocks were around. I saw some little - -||CC|||LMP-EVA|Half-meter to one-third-meter, glass-lined, pit-bottom craters.||LMP-EVA|Look at the size of those things!||||||Tape 110A/17||CDR-EVA|Boy, aren't they big mamoos (laughter).||LMP-EVA|(Laughter) And it looks like they're probably the same thing that we sampled. They have the inclusions in them, white inclusions. They look like a mixture of gray and the - sort of a tan-gray of the - the gray of the recrystallized breccia, and the tan-gray of the anorthositic gabbro.|06 19 54 02|LMP-EVA|That must - Hey, look! There's Van Serg, blocky rim crater. That's the other side of Cochise there. See it?||CDR-EVA|Yes. Way over there.||LMP-EVA|Yes. Cochise is certainly a shallow crater, although we knew that. It doesn't have any -it only has one place I can see that has any blocks on the inner wall of Cochise. Otherwise, it has a surface much like what we're driving on for walls and for the floor. One place on the south - southeast wall is a concentration of blocks much like we saw in Henry or in Horatio. But the rest of the crater seems to be pretty well mantled. Van Serg is a very blocky rim crater, big blocks up on the rim.||CDR-EVA|Do you have a lot of static, Jack, or is it just me?||LMP-EVA|No, I think it's just you. People are always giving you static.||CDR-EVA|Bob, if you are still reading me, I'm looking at the Sculptured Hills, and I still have that -that old man wrinkled face appearance, even up close at this Sun angle. And those wrinkles go from, generally, upslope at the west to downslope at the east.||LMP-EVA|Hey, are you - No, you're right at the edge of Cochise. Aren't you?||CDR-EVA|Where? Right here?||LMP-EVA|Yes. Aren't you?||||Tape 110A/18||||CDR-EVA|No, we're not that close. Uh-uh. Cochise is up at - see that rim where those blocks are?||LMP-EVA|No, that's a small crater.||CDR-EVA|Oh, I'll bet you that's Cochise up there. We've got to go quite a ways yet to get to -||CC|How about a range and bearing there, guys?||CDR-EVA|This sideslope driving is really a tough - -|06 19 55 45|CC|How about a range and bearing?||CDR-EVA|Okay. It's 210/3.4.||CC|Copy that. 210/3.4. And you should be somewhat north of Cochise there, as per planning, although you may be cutting south to try going directly up-Sun.||CDR-EVA|I guess that's some other - That's Just a depression. I think Cochise is over that rim.||LMP-EVA|That's just a depression. Yes, yes. Those are getting warm.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I tell you that. Every bump you go over on that sideslope is just accentuated.||CC|Yes, we don't think you're anywhere near Cochise.||LMP-EVA|Yes. I agree.||CDR-EVA|Yes. I think it's over that rim up there.||LMP-EVA|That's just a big, shallow depression.||CDR-EVA|All I'm doing is flying the 3.4-kilometer arc right now.||CC|Say again there, Gene.||LMP-EVA|There's another one of those deep craters that's not - that doesn't have a blocky rim.|06 19 56 57|CDR-EVA|Okay. 214/3.4.||||||Tape 110A/19||CC|Copy.||LMP-EVA|That's one of the more striking characteristics of the mantle are these craters that look, as far as the diameter-to-depth ratio is concerned, like they ought to be fairly young. But there's no blocks on the rim, and they seem to be - have this mantled appearance, just like some of the large craters.||CDR-EVA|As I look up Wessex Cleft from just about abeam of it - Let me get over here - It still shows me an albedo change and a surface wrinkle-texture change.||LMP-EVA|And - yes, I think so. I've got it at the same Sun angle more or less, or part of it there.||CC|Okay. Copy that. You guys may be getting just a little far north.||CDR-EVA|It's sort of a perfectly formed ...||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CC|You may want to head just a little south to avoid running right into the middle of SWP Crater.||LMP-EVA|Yes. I think we see it now. Is that SWP?||CDR-EVA|Well, I don't know. I don't -||CC|SWP will be at 22 - SWP will be at 225 and 3.4.||CDR-EVA|Yes. That's my - that's what I'm shooting for, Bob.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|I'm just flying a 3.4 mile - or kilometer arc.||CC|Roger. I was going to suggest that.||LMP-EVA|Bob, there's something I haven't mentioned, but if one had time on the next program - -|06 19 58 31|CDR-EVA|I think that's SWP right there, Jack.||||Tape 110A/20||||LMP-EVA|- - you can sample secondary craters, and they tend to have blocks either in them or on one rim, suggesting that you could tell directions if you put your mind to it. Directions of the - where the secondaries came from. These are small ones.||CDR-EVA|Did we ever get a piece of glass in place?||LMP-EVA|Yes, I did yesterday.||CDR-EVA|Documented in place?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|That's what I was trying to protect in the SRC yesterday.|06 19 59 00|CDR-EVA|Here's SWP, Jack. It's coming right up, and I'll go along the southern rim.||LMP-EVA|I wish I wouldn't lose - start concentrating. I'm forgetting to take my pictures.||CC|Roger, Jack. Don't forget to take your pictures.||CDR-EVA|I'll tell you, if we don't concentrate, we end up -||LMP-EVA|Okay. I'll quit thinking and just take pictures.|06 19 59 25|LMP-EVA|There's a crater, that double pit-bottom crater. That's the first one of those I've seen.||CDR-EVA|Right here, Jack, you're going to be able to peek right over the top of SWP.||LMP-EVA|Right.|06 19 59 36|CDR-EVA|Right here. How's that grab you?||LMP-EVA|That's SWP, all right. SWP's a bigger hole than I thought it was.||LMP-EVA|Might - SWP even has some blocks in the wall.||||||Tape 110A/21||CDR-EVA|Yes, but the eastern and southeastern rim of SWP are just continuous - Ooh - they're just continuous with the slopes of the Sculptured Hills.||CC|Okay. Copy that.|06 20 00 16|CDR-EVA|How does 238/4.2 sound for the beginning of 8?||LMP-EVA|Hey, you're -||CDR-EVA|May have to take these slopes just the most comfortable way we can.||CC|238 and 4.0 we're expecting for station 8, the beginning of it. 238/4.2 - 4.0, excuse me; 4.0.||CDR-EVA|Roger.||CC|And remember again, station 8 is a very flexible area. You just get to a place where it looks like it's feasible to sample Sculptured Hills.||LMP-EVA|That's right.||CDR-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Let me tell you, this Rover is a machine. I don't know if it saw that hill we're climbing, but I did.||LMP-EVA|How's your - how're you doing?||CDR-EVA|Doing fine. I'm trying to get around SWP over here and start hitting that -||LMP-EVA|East Massif has outcrops on it. I can see now on the north side. And they also tend to have linear upper terminations. And some of those line up as if there's roughly horizontal structure within the upper one-half of the East Massif.||CC|Okay. Copy that, Jack. Stop thinking and take pictures.||LMP-EVA|Go by that little dark crater over there. There's a very blocky-rim small crater that's a dark-rim crater instead of a bright rim like we'd seen some around that looked fresh. It partly may be the angle at which we're approaching it.||||Tape 110 A/22|||06 20 02 35|CDR-EVA|Bob, we're on the southeastern rim of SWP at 226 and 3.6.||LMP-EVA|Why don't we get some samples of that material in there.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Right here.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Keep driving toward the rim and then just -a shallow curve. Okay. Now, curve it.||CDR-EVA|That your spot?||LMP-EVA|Okay. Right. Just keep going, and I'll stop you.||LMP-EVA|Whoa, straight in. Good, good.|06 20 03 03|CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. 226/3.6. There's a - there's a highly fragmental, small crater about 40 - 30 or 40 meters across, right on the southeastern rim of SWP. And at - there's a - most of the fragments are football size and smaller, and they're very angular. And probably the inside of that rim is - -||LMP-EVA|Turns out that they'll break. They're clods.||CDR-EVA|Are they clods?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|I guess that's going to be about JO percent covered on the inside of the rim with these things.||LMP-EVA|It's all instant rock, but the crater rim looks dark compared to - to other fresh craters like this that we've seen.|06 20 03 47|CDR-EVA|50 Yankee.||CC|Copy. 50 Yankee.||||||Tape 110A/23|06 20 03 52|LMP-EVA|And the frame count is 26. LMP frame is 26.||CC|Copy that. Press on.|06 20 04 02|LMP-EVA|Yes, you1 re ... We are, we're rolling.||CC|And, 17, we're hoping to go to station 8a - -||LMP-EVA|Yes. Your wheels are just chewing those things up.||CC|- - the northernmost section of station 8, if we can, of course.||LMP-EVA|Yes. I think - I think we ought to head just about - -||CDR-EVA|Yes. We'll get there.||LMP-EVA|Well, the most - I think we ought to get below the highest peak up there because that seems to have the rocks on it.||LMP-EVA|I only see one rock so far - -||CDR-EVA|... straight ahead, in there. See that one. Of course, I don't know where that came down. Doesn't look like it may have came down from the top.||LMP-EVA|Certainly aren't many rocks. It's certainly not like the old North and South Massifs. Yes. There's one big rock over there. That doesn't look like it might be -||CDR-EVA|Well, let's head that way. That's about where the station is, anyway.||LMP-EVA|... I think we're starting to see blocks. That one is so - so unusual -||CDR-EVA|That's about the station. That's the northernmost station anyway. There's another one there.||LMP-EVA|Well, this probably is - We can get the other smaller population around it. I'm worried about that one being exotic to the Sculptured Hills.||||Tape 110A/24||||CDR-EVA|Yes, it doesn't look like it rolled -||LMP-EVA|No.||CDR-EVA|But I don't see any others, do you?||LMP-EVA|Well, there's some small ones up in there. Off to about the 2 o'clock position. But I think that's all. We're going to have to be satisfied with small ones. Big ones don't get down. There1s some big ones way up on the slope.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I see those.||LMP-EVA|Watch it; crater. You're ...|06 20 05 59|CDR-EVA|Yes, let me get it for them. Okay. We're at 227/3.9.||CC|Copy. 227/3.9.||CDR-EVA|I think it's worth - There's smaller ones around here, too, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Yes. That looks like subfloor from here.||CDR-EVA|What's it look like? If it doesn't look worthwhile stopping, I'll move on up over there.||LMP-EVA|Yes, it looks like subfloor. I would recommend that we - -||CDR-EVA|All right.||LMP-EVA|- - try to get up to some of those. I don't know whether we can or not. How's your - what's your pitch indicate?||CDR-EVA|Well, that doesn't mean anything.||LMP-EVA|See that - those two up there would be reasonably well up the slope.|06 20 06 47|CDR-EVA|Bob, no parking constraints on the battery?||||||Tape 110A/25||CC|Roger. No parking constraints. We'll park at 045, Gene. Or wherever you like, really.||CDR-EVA|I have to park about 045 because I've got to be pointing uphill so we can get out.||CC|Okay. Either - any place you want to. 045 is fine.||CDR-EVA|Jack, I'm going to park - -||LMP-EVA|How about just that rim of that little crater there?||CDR-EVA|Well, this is so level right here, Jack, I'm going to just park it -||LMP-EVA|Well, I was joist thinking on top of that crater is closer to the - That's level, too, on the rim. It'll give them a view of the - a good view of the sampling area. I think we can - if we work on those blocks there, we're in pretty good shape.|06 20 07 28|LMP-EVA|Bob, we're directly downhill, and that is from the highest point that I could see up on this first mass - first Sculptured Hill.|06 20 07 40|CDR-EVA|Bob, I'm parked at 026; bearing is 226; distance, 6.6; range, 4.0; amp-hours, 85 and 80; battery is 1 - I think it's 115; and motors are all off scale low.||CC|Okay - -||CDR-EVA|Not really, but - Okay - -||CC|And here,-we would like - -||CDR-EVA|- - 0 - 230 on the - on the forward and off scale low, and 220 on the right rear.||CC|Okay. We copy that. We'd like to get the usual dusting here. Up front.||CDR-EVA|Yes. And I'm fairly level.||LMP-EVA|Not really.||||Tape 110A/26||||CDR-EVA|I'm not, huh?||LMP-EVA|(Laughter) I just about rolled downhill again.||CDR-EVA|Oh, man. (Laughter) I am pointing uphill, aren't I?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Well, at least we don't have a sideslope.||CC|And, IT, we'd like - -||CDR-EVA|Battery covers stay closed?||CC|Battery covers stay closed. But we do want the LCRU, and the TV camera, and the TCU dusted.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||CC|And, IT, we'd like the SEP blankets opened and dusted one more time.||CDR-EVA|I think you're a dreamer, Bob, but I'll do it.||CC|Roger. We keep hoping.||CDR-EVA|Start doing your thing, Jack. It's going to take me a little while to get this dusted.||LMP-EVA|Bob, the first block I looked at here looks like subfloor gabbro.||CC|Okay. We copy that.||CDR-EVA|Should have it, Bob.|06 20 10 IT|CC|Okay. We've got a picture.||CDR-EVA|You even sound better. Battery covers are awful dirty, but I will not dust them as long as you're happy.||CC|Yes. I don't think dusting the battery covers gives us any cooler batteries.||||||Tape 110A/27||CDR-EVA|Well5 I know; but it keeps the batteries from getting dust in them. I've had pretty good luck with them. They've been pretty clean.||CC|Roger on that,||CDR-EVA|You are dusted; and you're shiny bright all over.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||CC|We thank you. Ed thanks you.||CDR-EVA|And we all thank you. Listen, if Ed thanks me, that's enough. A man couldn't ask for any more than that. Okay. I've got my ... - -||CC|I think your LMP just ran away.||CDR-EVA|Where'd he go? Jack?||LMP-EVA|What?||CDR-EVA|Oh, there you are. I thought maybe you fell in that crater I'm looking at. Okay. I'm going to give you a TGE reading.||CC|Roger. Give us a mark.|06 20 12 00|CDR-EVA|Our fender's beginning to fade and, uh-oh, the clip came off on the inside; that's what's wrong. We'll have to fix that before we start. The outside ones hold but the inside one's not.||LMP-EVA|Bob-o, all the blocks bigger than 20 centimeters that I've looked at up here are subfloor gabbro in appearance.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|I've looked at about five.||CC|Did we get a mark there on the gravimeter, Gene?|06 20 12 39|CDR-EVA|Thirty seconds to go, Bob.||||Tape 110A/28||||CC|Roger. I copied it. Just wanted to check.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Jack. You find anything up there?||LMP-EVA|Gene, I'm going to go up and look at this one rock. Why don't you set up and sample any one of these other big ones. They're all the same. Like the one near the Rover. And I'll go up and try to get this big one down there.||CDR-EVA|Well, okay.||LMP-EVA|It's the only one left to look at, but right now we're dealing with subfloor material, I think.||CDR-EVA|What about some of these little fragments that seem to be sitting more on the surface?||LMP-EVA|Yes, we're supposed to rake here. We'll get those with the rake.||CDR-EVA|That one up there, by the way, is sitting on the surface. These others are submerged.||LMP-EVA|Yes. That's why I want to look at it.||CDR-EVA|If you - you won't - you don't have a hammer, but if you need me, I'll come up there because I think that may be worthwhile.||LMP-EVA|I'll roll it down to you.||CDR-EVA|Yes . Thanks a lot.|06 20 13 56|CC|A reminder, 17. We'd like to have you leaving here in 30 minutes to make up some of the time we spent at stations 6 and 7» a little extra. And we'd also remind you that we'd like a rake soil sample here, too. That may be the only way we try and pick up seme stuff other than subfloor if that, indeed, has come down from the top of the Sculptured Hills.||||||Tape 110A/29|06 20 14 20|LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob. This rock is a big chunk of shattered, but still visible, bluish-gray anorthosite. It's glass-coated5 and it actually looks like it's vesicular. I'm going to roll it downhill so we can work on it. Well, I'll document it first.||LMP-EVA|Did you copy that?||CC|Roger. I copy that. We'll be watching it coming.||LMP-EVA|Okay. But the point is, as Gene said, it's the only rock, big one anyway, in the area that I see that's perched on the surface as if it might have rolled here.||CC|Okay. Copy that, Jack.||LMP-EVA|But I don't see a track.||CDR-EVA|Man, this one here is tough as a -||LMP-EVA|Well, we can get some .small ones.||CDR-EVA|Yes. That's what I'm going to do. I tell you, this one is so -||LMP-EVA|I thought you might be able to break it up.||CDR-EVA|Well, there's no - there's no corners on it.||LMP-EVA|Ready for this?||CC|We're ready.|06 20 16 28|CDR-EVA|Bob, 563 is the sample.||CC|Copy, 563.||CDR-EVA|Over here to the - ... — -||LMP-EVA|Are you ready? Are you ready for this?||CDR-EVA|I'm not sure I am, but go aiiead.||LMP-EVA|Go, roll- Look, I would roll on this slope, why don't you? Five-sixths gravity that's missing. Hey3 I'll bet you they would like, if I didn't step on it, sample out of the bottom of that thing.||||Tape 110A/30||||CDR-EVA|Yes. These others all look - You're right, Jack, they look like what we've been sampling. And they're all pretty well mantled except the ones you got up there. There's one more piece I see on the side of that crater that may not be.|06 20 17 44|LMP-EVA|Bag 5^5 will be soil from under that anorthosite boulder. Bob, the only thing that bothers me about that boulder being subfloor - I mean at Sculptured Hills - is that it's glass-coated.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|It may have been thrown in here by an impact. Oh, you're here.||CDR-EVA|Thought I'd sample it, and then roll it down.||LMP-EVA|Well, okay. I never would have moved it if I thought you were coming up.||CDR-EVA|Well, I wasn't coming up; but I looked at some of those others, and there's only one more -||LMP-EVA|Okay. Well, I got it documented up in place. Let's - That's not the - I think that's the side that was down. Let me roll it over -||CDR-EVA|Well, let me get a piece of that side since it was underneath. Then we'11 roll it over and get a piece of the other side.||LMP-EVA|Good thinking. Oh, okay, yes. Let's do it again. Except I got dust all over it.||CDR-EVA|Well -|06 20 18 57|LMP-EVA|The albedo - the down-Sun picture's not going to mean much. Let me get this sample in your bag. I think we ought to change your bag because the stuff's going to start flying out.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|It won't stay closed.||||||Tape 110A/31||CDR-EVA|Jack, after this one, there's only - there's one more in that crater. It may be from that crater, but I don't know.||LMP-EVA|How's your hand for hammering?||CDR-EVA|Ohhhh||LMP-EVA|This will be easy. This will be easy.||CDR-EVA|The old hammering hand -||LMP-EVA|This will be an easy one, Gene.||CDR-EVA|Two pieces for you.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Let me - -||CDR-EVA|Oh, that's a pretty one inside!||LMP-EVA|Well, it's stained by the glass coating.||CDR-EVA|Oh.||LMP-EVA|It's stained by that glass coating.||CDR-EVA|That's a pretty one inside.||CDR-EVA|Can you get that? Here, take my hand.||LMP-EVA|Thank you.||CDR-EVA|While I'm at it, I'm going to chop another piece off right here.||LMP-EVA|Yes, get more than that.||CDR-EVA|Piece right there. You've got three pieces laying around. Let's get those before we lose them.|06 20 20 26|LMP-EVA|Bag 564. Maybe. I - Okay, I got it.||CDR-EVA|Have you already got them in the bag?||LMP-EVA|No.||CC|Copy. We copy; 564 from the bottom of the boulder||||Tape 110A/32||||CDR-EVA|Sure that's the bottom, huh?||LMP-EVA|Yes, it's got - mixed with local soil. I'm pretty sure. Let's turn it over. I think I'd recognize the top, although it's got dust all over it now.||CDR-EVA|I think I'll get one more swap off there. I don't want to seal this. Let me get another swap off there. I can get it.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Well, that disappeared. Get it this way.||CDR-EVA|One time. That disappeared, too? That probably went into orbit.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Boy, is that pretty inside. Whoo! We haven't seen anything like this. I haven't. Unless you've been holding out on me.||LMP-EVA|No, this is a nice crystalline rock.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I see that one.||LMP-EVA|Where did that one go?||CDR-EVA|That's a good one. I'll go get it with my tongs. That's a good one. That one I worked too hard to get. Hey, I see how it makes boulder tracks. I just made one - it just - it just skipped along, made those little pothole craters as it went.|06 20 22 30|LMP-EVA|Hey, Houston. This is a - about a 50-50 mixture of - what looks like maskelynite or at least blue-gray plagioclase, and a very - let's say yel - light yellow-tan mineral, probably orthopyroxene. It's fairly coarsely crystalline.||CC|Copy that. Okay. When you guys get done with that rock, we'd like to get to the rake sample, please. And that's probably just as well done by the Rover as anyplace else. We don't seem to see anything worthwhile here doing besides that.||||||Tape 110A/33||CDR-EVA|Did you get it?||LMP-EVA|Yes.|06 20 23 29|CDR-EVA|Okay. That went in the same bag, Bob, as the other - rest of the chips from the bottom. All the chips from the bottom are in 464.||CC|Copy.||LMP-EVA|Here, let me roll it over. Go ahead. Want to put it in?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Oh, boy.||LMP-EVA|By coarsely crystalline, it's - probably, the average grain size will turn out to be about 3 or 4 millimeters, maybe - maybe half a centimeter. Hold this, and I'll - -|06 20 24 09|CDR-EVA|Well, I got to go get a couple of pictures.||LMP-EVA|Yes. Yes, we really got that one messed up.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I -||LMP-EVA|That's all right.||CDR-EVA|If you'd hold your scoop where that one came off, it'd help.||LMP-EVA|Yes: I was just going over there.||CDR-EVA|On that other side.||LMP-EVA|Just going over there.||CDR-EVA|This side is clear. That last one I took off. Okay||LMP-EVA|Right there.||CDR-EVA|Okay, that's good. Let's move the gnomon, and we won't roll it over on the gnomon.||||Tape 110A/34||||LMP-EVA|Watch it. Watch it. Oh, yes. That other side is the one that was up. Well, I'm not sure now. It's got so much dust on it. But let's -||CDR-EVA|It's not going to roll down that hill unless we got it on edge.||LMP-EVA|No. Did it come up to you?||CDR-EVA|Well, look at that glass on it. That's what you said, huh?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Which side was the glass on when you looked at it?||LMP-EVA|It's on all sides. It's on all sides.||CC|17, there's probably not much point in spending a lot of time out here trying to decide which is the top. It's not big enough, anyway, really to worry about - -||CDR-EVA|We' re not.||CC|- - the top and bottom samples. They're radiol-ogically significant.||LMP-EVA|Well, let's - If you don't want another sample, then we can go ahead.||CDR-EVA|Well, let me get a piece of this glass.||LMP-EVA|Righto.||LMP-EVA|There it is. Okay. Let me try to get them. Put them in here.|06 20 26 29|CDR-EVA|Okay; a piece of the glass from it, Bob, is 546.||CC|Okay. We copy 546.||CDR-EVA|With a little of the local soil.||CC|And now we're ready for you guys to rake - -||||||Tape 110A/35||CDR-EVA|Okay. We'll rake.||CC|- - and I guess they suggest the crater rim if possible. Probably over there near the Rover.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Now you got a sample of that big block down there, huh?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Don't forget your gnomon. Whoo! Oh, boy.|06 20 27 08|CDR-EVA|Bob, on my frame^ count; 85.||CC|Copy, 85 for the commander.||LMP-EVA|Too bad I don't have my skiis.||CDR-EVA|Jack, did you get a pan up here?||LMP-EVA|No.|06 20 27 25|CDR-EVA|1111 get one.||LMP-EVA|Good, I forgot. I got interested in skiing, Whoo! Can't keep my edges. Little hard to get a good hip rotation.||CDR-EVA|Let's see, I must be looking back at - well, there's SWP. Golly, I don't know. I'm looking back at the complex: Cochise and Shakespeare, and I can see the LM.||LMP-EVA|Hey, Bob. One interesting thing up here, you can see the erosional pattern of the talus, the mantle that - I call it a mantle, but the talus that's on the Sculptured Hills, there's little - little boulder tracks of all sizes from all these little clods. And they all, of course, point downhill or nearly downhill.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Hey, Bob. In the interest of time, I'll document this without the gnomon.||||Tape 110A/36||||CC|Okay. I presume Gene's got the gnomon up there.||LMP-EVA|Yes. I should have brought it, but - -||CC|Okay. Don't forget the gnomon, Gene.||LMP-EVA|- - I didn't think about it.||CC|And we concur - -||LMP-EVA|Don't forget the Gene, gnomon [sic]!||CC|- - with Dr. ... about the gnomon.||CDR-EVA|Whee! Boy, when you do thi s, and you go downslope, that first step is a long one.||CDR-EVA|I'm having - This is the best way for me to travel. Uphill or downhill.||LMP-EVA|What's that?||CDR-EVA|Like this. Two-legged hop.||LMP-EVA|There seems - Yes.||CDR-EVA|And on level ground, I can skip. I don't like that loping thing.||LMP-EVA|Oh, the loping's the only way to go.||CDR-EVA|Well, when I'm on level ground, I can skip. But this two-legged thing is great. Man, I can cover ground like a kangaroo. Oh, okay. You documented already; I was just going to put this in the field of view anyway.||LMP-EVA|Yes. Here on the after ... right out there.|06 20 33 55|CDR-EVA|Well, what do you think about that? There's not much in here worth - Man, there's just nothing -This has been totally mantled with Talus. Well, it is, because that - that downhill pattern goes right down the slope of this crater, and, actually, it goes upslope of the crater. This may be on a ray somewhere. Because it goes right downhill -this little ... boulder trail pattern goes right up the slope.||||||Tape 110A/37||LMP-EVA|I think those are later than the crater by a long ways.||CDR-EVA|Did you - did you sample anything over here?||LMP-EVA|No, I haven't done anything - -||CDR-EVA|I'm going to pick up the piece out of that little - -||LMP-EVA|Yes, get this - -||CDR-EVA|- - crater.||LMP-EVA|Want your gnomon over there?||CDR-EVA|No. I'll just take it to it. Let me know when you're ready for a pan.||LMP-EVA|Well, I'm about ready.||CDR-EVA|You about ready?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Okay.|06 20 32 17|LMP-EVA|I went - I raked about a 2-meter square area -maybe - yes, about 2 meters, and down to 4 or 5 centimeters for these. Pretty good population. They all going to go in?||CDR-EVA|They're all in; 5 - -||LMP-EVA|Wait, wait.||CDR-EVA|- - 5 - 565.||CC|Okay. Copy that - -||CDR-EVA|565.||CC|Sounds great. Sounds like a good rake sample for a change.||CDR-EVA|Yes, sir.||||Tape 110A/38||||CC|And this is a kilogram soil locations, fellows.||LMP-EVA|Yes, sir.|06 20 32 54|CDR-EVA|Jack, your bag is full; we're going to have - No, it isn't, but we ought to change it when we get back, anyway. And that one ought to go under your seat.||LMP-EVA|Oh, okay.||CDR-EVA|Get your kilogram. I'll be ready to take it.|06 20 33 16|CDR-EVA|The kilogram is in 566.||CC|Copy that. And, remaining here, we'd have primarily a trench. If you fellows think it's feasible, we'd like to be moving in 1 - 1 minutes, 11 minutes. And we could use a pan from this lower location also, probably.||CDR-EVA|Why don't you go back and dig a trench at the Rover?||CC|Roger. That sounds good to us.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||CC|And we also remind you of getting - -||CDR-EVA|Once you get a trench at the Rover - -||CC|-- a pan at the lower section there.||CDR-EVA|- - we just scoop this out. I'll get the sample here that I got documented now and - -||LMP-EVA|Did you? - Is that - is that all going to go in there?||CDR-EVA|Yes , it' 11 go.||LMP-EVA|Can you twist it?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||||||Tape 110A/39||LMP-EVA|That ... rock may have been too much. Take that rock out, and - -||CDR-EVA|No, it'll stay. We're going to have to put it in mine, though. Well, let me try. Since we're going to unload your bag, this may be the last -the last one. That's the last one for your bag.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Did you get anything out of that little crater?||CDR-EVA|No. But I'm going to right now.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Why don't you get your after picture over there and go down and get that trench. I'll come down -||LMP-EVA|You don't want a bag? Okay.||CDR-EVA|I can - I can back it - I can do it -||LMP-EVA|...|06 20 35 04|CDR-EVA|Boy, almost pure white and very friable. Oh, boy, is itl Pure white. Right out of a small little pit crater on the side of this crater I just walked in, Houston. And it's pure white, very friable. I got about - well, one big piece and several small in 5^7-||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Bob, the walls of these craters, the big craters around here, that is, the ones that are, say, 15 meters In diameter, tend to be a little bit lighter albedo than ones down in the mantled area. I'm afraid those pictures on that rake may be a little bit made - be througji a dust-colored lens.||||Tape 110A/40||||CDR-EVA|Yes, they were also in my documented sample here, too.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Where do you want this trench? On the side of this crater?||LMP-EVA|Well, --||CDR-EVA|I'll drop my gnomon.||LMP-EVA|- - I don't know. I don't - I was just thinking about that. I think - I think we - we - we ought to get out in the inner crater area to see if there's any stratigraphy to the - to - to whatever the talus is.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Jack. I'm going to leave the gnomon right here.||LMP-EVA|I'll get it.||CDR-EVA|And, while you're digging that trench, we've got to pan to getj but I want to fix this fender.||LMP-EVA|I guess this - The pan's mine, isn't it, this one?||CDR-EVA|Yes, it is. And I want to fix the fender before - -||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|- - before we leave. ... - -||CC|Okay. We agree with that, and you might get us a - -||CDR-EVA|- - ... one, and I'll tighten - -||CC|-- you might get us the gravimeter reading there, Gene, while you're at it. And if you have time, you might drop the gravimeter on the ground, and we'll get a reading with it on the ground as well.|06 20 37 31|CDR-EVA|Holy Smoley. The gravimeter's coming up. 670, 096, 001 - 670, 096, 001.||||||Tape 110A/41||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|You want it dropped on the ground, huh?||CC|Gently.||CDR-EVA|Gently. I can't find a gentle level spot, but I'll level it. If it takes pictures - or does it's thing on the Rover, it'll do its thing here.||CC|Yes, this is just to get a check - -||CDR-EVA|Okay.|06 20 38 14|CDR-EVA|MARK. ...||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|It's fender-fixing time, it's camera-taking-off time. And I think I'll zap myself with a little cool water.||CC|And how's the trench going, Jack?||LMP-EVA|Oh, down.||CDR-EVA|Oh, man, I tell you. When you call for cold water, does it come in nicely. Whew! I'm really happy with this fender, really happy with it.||LMP-EVA|Bob, I have dug - have gotten a wall, now in one place that's standing about 25 centimeters high. And it shows no apparent change in the texture of the soil to that depth; except possibly at the lower 5 centimeters, there's some zones that might be slightly more granular. Particle size may be up a little bit.||CC|Okay. I copy that. Probably just three samples then will be sufficient, then.||LMP-EVA|I think - I think so. Maybe four.||CDR-EVA|Be there in a minute, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Oh, that's all right. I can probably get started.||||Tape 110A/42||||CDR-EVA|Oh, oh, oh, boy.||LMP-EVA|Need some help?||CDR-EVA|No. Boy, we're sure giving this suspension system a workout. Whew! I can't even see it. Well, everything's getting awful dusty. Boy, everything is stiff. Everything is just full of dust. There's got to be a point where the dust just overtakes you, and everything mechanical quits moving.||LMP-EVA|Like scoops.||CDR-EVA|I'm not sure whether Detroit would like the fender, but it will sure buy the fix. Okay, it's fixed.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|And I'm happy; I like it.||CC|Roger. We copy that. And copy it again. And we'd like to have you guys moving in about 3 minutes.||LMP-EVA|Good luck.||CDR-EVA|You need any help you get - bag those samples, huh?||LMP-EVA|Yes, sir. I think I do. I can't adjust ny scoop to my belt-bagging method.||CDR-EVA|Let me get back on some lighter cooling here to -to save some water. Okay, now.||LMP-EVA|Okay - the bottom 10 centimeters - -||CDR-EVA|Let me get your bags - I left my camera off when I -||LMP-EVA|- - of a - Well, shoot! I didn't take a picture of the trench after I dug it. Let me take one -one shot.||CDR-LM|Which is the bottom?||||||Tape 110A/43||LMP-EVA|That's the bottom.|06 20 42 30|CDR-EVA|Okay. The bottom is in 548. It's very cloddy. Looks very much like the surface we're standing on except it clods up quite a bit more. Can you tell them anything from the trench itself?||LMP-EVA|I told them - I talked to them a little bit about it.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|It looked a little coarser grained, but that's all||CDR-EVA|Okay. It sure holds a nice wall, though.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|That's the kind of wall I expect those core tubes held.||LMP-EVA|You got another one?||CDR-EVA|Okay. Skim of the upper - We'll see - how well I do - skin sample of the upper - half centimeter. Maybe a centimeter deep.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Can you hold this?||CDR-EVA|I'm going to put it in your bag.||LMP-EVA|Is it going to fit in there?||CDR-EVA|Well, there's no choice, right now. Let me see if these little ones will fit in there. Stand by. I want to put this one in there, too.|06 20 43 45|CDR-EVA|That's in bag 549-||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Try again. Okay. The upper - Below that skin, the next 5 centimeters.||||Tape 110A/44||||LMP-EVA|Put it down, Geno.||CDR-EVA|... put over.||LMP-EVA|Well, I can't turn it.|06 20 44 33|CDR-EVA|550.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|And the next 10 centimeters down -||LMP-EVA|Can you get this one too?||CDR-EVA|Yes. Now, I got to get your bag.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay. That was the next 10 centimeters, and then the first sample, of course, was the 10 centimeters below that.||CC|Roger. Copy that.|06 20 45 05|CDR-EVA|And that last bag was 551.||CC|Okay. Copy that. We're ready for you guys to move out.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|You didn't get a pan here - while I clean up the Rover, you can get a - get your after of the trench in the pan.||LMP-EVA|I will.||CDR-EVA|1111 get the TG and clean up the Rover.||CC|That's affirm. We agree with that.||LMP-EVA|What's the key that keeps - I keep getting keyed.||CDR-EVA|It sounds like Bob's stepping on his foot mike.||LMP-EVA|Yes, he's so excited - -||||||Tape 110A/45||CDR-EVA|Okay - -||LMP-EVA|- - he can't stand it.||CDR-EVA|- - You done with the gnomon?||LMP-EVA|Yes. Okay. I'll get the pan.||CDR-EVA|You get your pan, and I'll get the TG and clean up.||LMP-EVA|You took a pan up the hill there?||CDR-EVA|Yes. I took it way up there, somewhere.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I'll take it right here, then. Uh oh.||CDR-EVA|What?||LMP-EVA|Sample came out.||CDR-EVA|The sample cane out?||LMP-EVA|I'll pick it up.||CDR-EVA|Yes, your - your top came open. It's awful full, Jack. If you can't get it, I'll get it with the tongs.||LMP-EVA|Go ahead and go to work, and I'll get the pan first. I lost two of them, I guess.||CDR-EVA|Yes, those are the last two I put in there. They just - your bag is so full they won't stay. Let me give them a reading here. Hey, Bob, can I move it on the Rover and then give you a reading?||CC|Yes. As long as you're careful not to hit the button while you're doing it.||CDR-EVA|I won't hit the button. Just easier to do it that way. I don't know why I asked you; I know I can.|06 20 46 44|CDR-EVA|Even this thing doesn't want to go on; it's so dusty. Okay. It's on and it's locked, and here's your reading. 670 - 670, 117a 301 - that's 670, 117, 301.||||Tape 110A/46||||CC|Okay. We copy that.||CDR-EVA|I've got to dust that thing the next time around. Jack, we've got to do some bag changing here.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|I'll get those things with ny tongs. You can't get them - You'd have to bend over. Every time you jump around, you come close to losing something. I'll just take them back there. Put them under the seat.||LMP-EVA|Okay. You want me to take that one?||CDR-EVA|No, I got it.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Darn.||CC|You got another one dropped there, Gene - Jack got it.||CDR-EVA|Another one?||CC|Jack's getting it.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Jack, we've got to make a place in here for your - that full bag. Let me put this small can over there, and core tube over there.||LMP-EVA|I have a sample.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Let me take your bag off first.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Well, you might as well fill it as full as you can.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I am. Holy Smoley.||LMP-EVA|(Laughter) Turn - turn to the left.||CDR-EVA|Okay. It's off. Let me fill it.||LMP-EVA|Your bag isn't in much better shape.||||||Tape 110A/47||CC|Roger. We'd like to have you check the commander's bag. You might put them both under the seat there.||LMP-EVA|Well, we're running out of bags, aren't we?||CC|Okay. We've got one bag left - we should have there. It was on the gate, right?||LMP-EVA|Okay. Yes. We - we could have put it under the seat.||CDR-EVA|Okay, bag number 4 - bag number 4 is - is absolutely full - and it's under Jack's seat.||CC|Okay. I suggest that you take the other bag that's on the gate there, and put that on either you or Jack. And also, the commander's bag is pretty full also, we suspect.|06 20 49 57|LMP-EVA|Why don't you put it on me? Mine gets full faster, somehow.||CC|You might - you might check Gene's bag anyway.||CDR-EVA|There. Stay there, stay there. I'm trying to get the bottom off.||LMP-EVA|Oh, I'm sorry. I checked it. He's got about six samples to go.||CC|Okay. And - -||LMP-EVA|And I just want to be sure that it's locked down.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Well, turn to the left so I can get this other hook.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|It's not coming out; I guarantee you that. No ... take your - -||CC|Okay. And SCB 5 is one for the LMP if you want to take it off the gate.||CDR-EVA|I got it.||LMP-EVA|SCB-5 is on the LMP.||||Tape 110A/48||||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|There is nothing on the gate.||LMP-EVA|Well, I think, that'll stay down, but it's not very good - -||CDR-EVA|Okay. I've got one more loose sample I'm going to throw in the big bag back there.||LMP-EVA|A local one, you mean?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Well||CDR-EVA|Well, let me leave it under your seat.||LMP-EVA|"Now, let's - Can I put a ""bag a round it?"||CDR-EVA|No, it's got a bag around it - It's all bagged.||CC|Okay. Jack, while Gene's doing that, why don't you read the SEP temperature, or somebody read the SEP temperature anyway, and close the blankets.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I'll do that.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. Let's see, you got your readings - -|06 20 51 25|LMP-EVA|120, Bob, 120.||CC|Copy. 120.||LMP-EVA|Those blankets just aren't staying closed.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I guess we're ready to head on out. Do you agree?||CC|Okay. And, Gene, when you go to change the -when you go to change the LCRU, we'd like you to turn it to OFF - 0-F-F, on the POWER switch, the INTERNAL POWER EXTERNAL switch. And we'll be reading you through the LM. It will give you a chance to cool down the LCRU on the way home to station 9-||||||Tape 110A/49||CDR-EVA|All right.||LMP-EVA|And, Houston, what's the temperature limit on the DSEA?||CC|Stand by, Jack.||CDR-EVA|Do you read us, Bob, through the LM?||CC|Roger. We read you through the LM. Do read us through the LM?||CDR-EVA|Yes. Not as well, but we're reading you.||CC|Okay. And the temperature limit, Jack, is 160. We'll just leave it as is until we get back to the LM.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I was going to say, we could take it out and put it under the seat or something, but that sounds all right.|06 20 52 51|CDR-EVA|Okay. An EMU status check. I'm at 388, and I got 48 percent, no flags, and I'm INTERMEDIATE cooling.||CC|Copy that.|06 20 53 05|LMP-EVA|And the LMP - is at 47 percent, no flags, 3.86. Hey, Gene?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|What - Well, Bob, I guess - remind us to change the LRV sampler at the next station. It's almost out of bags.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Well, let's do it next time around.||CC|Okay. When you get on, Jack, you can give me a frame count as you start moving.||LMP-EVA|Yes. Hang on. Need some help?||CDR-EVA|Nope.||||Tape 110A/50||||LMP-EVA|Go downhill. Get your feet downhill.||CDR-EVA|Yea.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Let me help you.||CDR-EVA|(Laughter)||LMP-EVA|Watch it, there's a crater right behind you.||CDR-EVA|I got it. I got it.||LMP-EVA|Here, here. Grab my hand.||CDR-EVA|Okay, now, just push up on my head.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I'm not going to do it too hard. Going backwards.||CDR-EVA|All right; just push up.||LMP-EVA|Okay?||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Boy, are you - you got your pockets completely filled with dirt.||CDR-EVA|Well, extra samples.||LMP-EVA|Do we throw those pockets away this time around?||CDR-EVA|Extra sample.||LMP-EVA|Are you a mess!||CDR-EVA|Well, that one was coming for a long time.||LMP-EVA|My hand's are already tired from dusting you.||CDR-EVA|That one was coming. I keep trying to blow the dust off my camera, which is very frustrating.||LMP-EVA|Very ineffective, too.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Do we try that trick again? You know that happened on an upslope getting on the Rover. Okay. I'm all locked in. Let me know when you are.||||||Tape 110A/51||LMP-EVA|How come we aren't deploying any charges? I guess the last one - I remember when that one is.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||CC|We'll deploy one at station 10.|06 20 55 33|CDR-EVA|Okay. We're heading to station 9 pointed about 267. Okay, and they're reading us through the IM, so I won't worry about the low gain. We're powering up. The switch is on. Okay, I'm going to make a turn to the right.||CC|Okay. And the updated headings, since you're at the north end of station 8 will be something like about 240.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. 240.||LMP-EVA|Bob, I think your rake sample here at the Sculptured Hills is going to have to tell a tale combined with the observation that most of the blocks we saw were, like Gene sampled, looked like subfloor gabbro. It's conceivable that the Sculptured Hills could be the same kind of material. I think it's fairly clear that the boulder population does not resemble the massif population at all.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|(Laughter)||CDR-EVA|You been riding on this downslope all the time?||LMP-EVA|(Laughter) Yes, but - -||CDR-EVA|And you hadn't said anything, huh?||LMP-EVA|Scary, isn't it?|06 20 56 58|CDR-EVA|Man, I'm glad I'm driving.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 110B/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|06 21 13 09|CMP|Hello, Houston; America.

I figured you should come to that real good conclusion.||CC|Yes, we think so, too - -||CMP|Okay. ... - -||CC|- - Boy, you should have seen the Flight Plan changes we would have had.||||||Tape 110B/5||CMP|(Laughter) I can imagine them.||CMP|Over there; okay.||CC|Say again, Ron; I cut you out.||CMP|I was just going to say that - running Volume 3 tomorrow morning.||CC|That's right. So it - -||CMP|Okay.||CC|Yes, volume 3.|06 21 32 10|CMP|Okay. At - Okay, I've got volume 3 now.||CC|Okay, and it's at 180:15; 180:15 is the first one.||CMP|Okay.||CC|"Okay, I know I told you we wouldn't update the ones in the block, but the very first one is inside the block so you - where it says ""LOPC target 1084.."" Just cross that out and make that ""Trim target load."""||CMP|Oh, okay.||CC|"And below the update block - the next block - as part of that block, add ""Trim pads."" We'11 be coming up with you with trim pads."||CMP|Okay.|06 21 33 02|CC|"Okay, the first one is at 180:20. Add ""Poo,"" and below it, add VERB 49 maneuver to P52/trim attitude."""||CMP|Okay.||CC|"And put a note: ""Maneuver will take 14 minutes."""||CMP|Okay.|06 21 33 54|CC|Okay, we're going to give you the high gain angle numbers and the VERB 49 maneuver numbers tomorrow morning. They'll probably change on latest updates,||||Tape 110B/6|||||so we won't give anything for the - You can Joist put three blanks for the roll, pitch, and yaw there with that VERB 49 maneuver. Okay, if you go down the page - -||CMP|Okay.||CC|"You go down the page to 180:27. Delete - Cross out ""CMC MODE, FREE; POO; CMC MODE, AUTO; LIMIT CYCLE, ON; ATTITUDE DEAD BAND, MIN; and RATE, LOW."" And delete that note that starts ""Do not stop ORB RATE early (avoid gimbal lock problems)” over there right next to that. Joist delete all that."||CMP|Okay; got it.||CC|Okay, on the next coloimn, 180:40, delete the VERB 49 maneuver.||CMP|Okay.||CC|"Okay; at 180:44, add ""UV COVER, CLOSED."""||CMP|"""UV COVER CLOSED,"" 180:44. •"||CC|"Roger. And at l80:45» if you can fit it in between the Og fuel cell poirge and that, add the following: ""UV, OFF; IR, OFF, and enable all jets."""|06 21 35 46|CMP|"Okay, after ""IR COVER, CLOSE,"" we'll put ""Turn the UV, OFF; the IR, OFF*1; and then enable all Jets before the fuel cell purge, huh?"||CC|Well, if you can fit it in there wherever it's convenient; Roger.||CMP|Okay.|06 21 36 04|CC|"Okay. At 180:58, where it says ""Configoire DSE,"" change ""HIGH BIT RATE"" - cross it out, and make it ""LOW BIT RATE."""||CMP|Okay; LOW BIT RATE instead of HIGH BIT RATE.||CC|Okay, at - over on the next page at 181:15, add the following.||||||Tape 110B/7||CMP|Okay.||CC|"""Pre-SPS burn - burn sim prep cue card."" Let me read that again. ""Pre-SPS burn sim prep cue card."" Another statement: ""Secure equipment for trim/ LOPC."""||CMP|Okay. At l8l:15, we'll do the Pre-SPS burn sim prep cue card and secure the equipment for trim/ LOPC.||CC|"Roger. And right after that, put ""P30 - P-30."""||CMP|Okay.|06 21 37 37|CC|"Okay. And you might as well scratch out those words where it says ""Eat period"" on that line, and down at l8l:23, add ""P4l - P4l."""||CMP|Okay, P4l.||CC|"Okay. At 181:33, add ""Trim burn - Trim burn."""||CMP|Okay, trim burn.|06 21 38 20|CC|"Okay. At l8l:35» add the following: ""VERB 49 maneuver to LOPC burn pad attitude."""||CMP|Okay, VERB 49 to the LOPC burn pad attitude.||CC|"Roger. At 181:43, add ""Report burn status."""||CMP|Okay.||CC|"Okay. At 182:15 on the next page - 182:15, delete ""Pre-SPS burn sim prep cue card; IR, OFF; UV, OFF; enable all jets; secure equipment for LOPC."" Delete all those because you've already done it."||CMP|Okay.||CC|"Okay. At 182:20, delete the note which says ""PCM data will not be recorded during LOPC."" Delete that note."||CMP|Okay.||||Tape 110B/8|||06 21 39 58|CC|Okay. And then the last - -||CMP|Is that - -||CC|- - one is just a general comment, Ron. As you can see, we1 re cutting into your eat period, and you1 re going to be awful busy, and your eat period is very short. So, right at wakeup, while you're working, you might be considering getting eat things ready to go up with - ready to eat. You know, just as you're doing you postsleep check and that, you might be getting some food out. You're going to be busier than the proverbial one-armed paperhanger there.||CMP|Okay. That's probably a good idea (chuckle).||CC|And we wanted that up to you so that you might get a chance to look at it this evening or the rest of this rev and make some thoughts or pull your thoughts together on that burn in the morning and see if we've covered all bets.|06 21 40 57|CMP|Okay. So far it looks pretty good here. We'll have some different high gain angles there at l8l:00. And you're going to give those up anyhow.||CC|Okay, at l8l:00 - -||CMP|You can send those up with the - well, for the next AOS there.||CC|Yes. We see that. Okay. We'll have to be calling that up to you tomorrow as you go around, I guess.||CMP|Oh, won't that - well, that'll be the same, because the LOPC burn attitude should be the same as nominal.||CC|Yes. Roger.||CMP|Or about.||CC|Yes; you're right.||CMP|Okay, so it's all right. I'm sorry.||||||Tape 110B/9||CC|Ron, just to make sure. You understood the reason why we have to do this trim burn or ham burn or whatever you want to call it?|06 21 42 11|CMP|Yes. As I understand, the mascons didn't work the way we thought they would.||CC|That's about the size of it.||CMP|It didn't get down into a circular orbit. Let's see. Just glancing through here, it looks to me like we're going to do the trim burn and the LOPC REFSMMAT, right?||CC|That's affirmative, Ron.||CMP|Okay.||CC|And, Ron, just - I think you realize it, but all this has been checked out in the CMS down at the Cape already, and it's all been run. And there's no gimbal lock problem as far as we know.||CMP|Hey, outstanding. Okay; good.||CMP|Yes. Those guys in the CMS down there do good work.||CC|Roger.|06 21 46 17|CMP|You know that crater - that circle next to D-Caldera - has a lot of blocks - blocks - blocky material laying around it. That - little bit of a terrace that I could just barely see on the west side of - western rim - down inside the western rim.||CC|Got you. I didn't think you were going to be able to see anything with the attitude. I'm surprised you can see anything at all.|06 21 47 09|CMP|Yes. I was, too. I just happened to look out, and there it was.||CC|Just talked to El Lago a few minutes ago, Ron, and all the neighbors are out - are at your home around the squawk box, listening. And Jan said to tell you||||Tape 110B/10.|||||that Jaime and Jon will be out here at - with us tomorrow. We're going to all - They're going to watch the burn from here - the LOPC and the trim burn.||CMP|Oh, hey, good deal! Yes, I've got some real fine neighbors down there, I'll tell you that.|06 21 48 59|CMP|You know, I look at that D-Caldera from a distance -I can still see it in the binocs - and I keep trying to look for some hint of a topographic expression, a topographic rise surrounding D-Caldera And I can't see a hint of a shadow, difference in the color, or anything. It's just flat out in the middle of a flat plain, and it's a D-shaped depression that's slumped down. There's no rise around the rims - or anything.||CC|Roger. Got you. Must be frustrating, because it's supposed to have some type of topographical expression, huh?||CMP|Yes; right. You know, it's supposed to have something. But it looks like it just fell right out of the flat plain, you know. It took part of the -took part of the plain with it, because there are these bubble-looking things down in D-Caldera.|06 21 51 06|CMP|How many frames in the next Nikon mag do I have to diddle with?||CC|Okay, we're running that one through FAO here. Stand by a moment, Ron, on that.||CMP|Okay.|06 21 53 23|CMP|For the ejecta pattern of Eratosthenes, you can just see it looking back into the Sun now, and the terminator is right - right in the middle of Eratosthenes now. And you can sure see the classic impact ejecta pattern around it. It goes out for -you know, almost two crater diameters as we can see the topographic expression. You can see the scalloping or scouring as it's gone back across there, due to the shadows that are created in ohe low Sun angle.||||||Tape 110B/11|06 21 54 07|CC|Ron, at your convenience, we would like H TANKS 1,|||2, and 3 FANs, OFF. H TANKS 1, 2, and 3 FANS to OFF.|06 21 54 20|CMP|Okay. I'm going to turn off all the H FANS. There's 3, 2, and 1, are all OFF.||CC|Good show.||CMP|I took a bath last night. I think I'll try to shave tonight. Starting to itch underneath this helmet.||CC|Roger.||CC|You mean you're not going to come home with a beard, huh?||CMP|Well, Jon wanted me to, but I can't seem to get past the itching stage.||CC|Just be comfortable. Just be comfortable. You got another week to go.||CMP|(Laughter) I know it. I've already shaved once. And when you - when you start to shave, you can only - you can only put that brushless shaving cream on - oh, maybe a third - a third of your face and start hacking on it there because it dried out real quick. So you put on a little bit, then scrape it off with a razor, then get some more on and then scrape it off.||CC|Roger.|o6 21 57 io|CC|Okay, Ron, FAO's data says that on magazine Yankee Yankee, we have 20 unscheduled frames that you can use prior to the scheduled photography. After the scheduled photography, anything that's left will also be yours.||CMP|Oh, okay. Yankee Yankee must be the next one up then. I can change - put that in, huh?||CC|That's affirm, Ron. You can go ahead and put it in and shoot 20 and then you have to hold the rest for the scheduled photography.||||Tape 110B/12||||CMP|Okay, will do.||CC|I can see your thoughts there, Ron. You're going to get those 20 shot up before Jack ever gets up there, huh?|06 21 58 03|CMP|(Laughter) Oh, that is a good thought. No, it's just that every once in a while at these terminators, you know, you - you have some real good shots, and we just can't schedule them, you know, all the time, because sometimes you can't do it. But you take one or two shots of each terminator when it comes by, you get some real good pictures.||CC|Roger. We understand.|06 22 00 37|CMP|(Humming)|06 22 04 51|CMP|Okay, magazine Yankee Yankee is in the Nikon -finally.||CC|Roger.||CMP|I think I mentioned here the other night, didn't I, putting that magazine in there - you know, it's a real critical tight fit. And you get it pushed in there just right, and then in zero g, the thing bounces back out of the way, you know - before you can get the back on there.||CC|Roger. You don't think - -||CMP|Good camera, though.||CC|- - Nikon was designed for zero gravity, huh?||CMP|(Laughter) No, it works great. Sure something to be said about a removable magazine cassette though.||CC|Roger.||CMP|But then again, you can focus the Nikon.||CC|Roger.|06 22 14 27|CMP|Hey, Houston; America.||||||Tape 110B/13||CC|Okay, Ron. We're here.||CMP|Okay. I was looking over this transfer list - about 184:00, and I don't remember Gene and Jack leaving their helmet stowage bags back to me. So I think they must have them in the LM - in Challenger.||CC|Okay, we'll make a note of that and check it out tonight.||CMP|Okay.|06 22 18 07|CMP|Well, let's see, probably about time to P20 here. Plus-X forward, SIM bay attitude; 2 ENTER ENTER, plus 5 ENTER - ... - okay, PROCEED. Noun 78 -Well, that's already loaded. 52.25; plus X is 180; okay? Except we're going to do - half degree dead band 2 ENTER - 2-1/2 degree dead band, I mean. Plus 2.50. ... number 50 is the Moon. And right now, we'd like to orbrate around the Moon. ... -2 - ...|06 22 20 39|CC|Hey, Ron, do you have your volume 3 handy?||CMP|Yes, as a matter of fact.||CC|Your last call about the helmet stowage bags. Where - whereabouts in volume 3 is that?||CMP|At 184 - about 19.||CMP|Took -||CC|Okay, we got it. Thank you.||CMP|They got suited and took their helmets and gloves with them over in the LM - took their helmets and gloves with them over to LM, and they said they were going to send the back. But I don't think they ever did. We all got busy, and so they've still got them over there somewhere.|06 22 24 30|CC|Ron, we're going to lose you in about 1 minute, and you're looking great. No problems at all.||CMP|Okay, we'll see you on the other side there, Bob. Thank you.||||Tape 110B/14||||CC|Roger, Ron. And at 169:51 or thereabouts, we'll see you.||CMP|Okay,||CC|And you'll be eating, wo we won't call you. But we'll be standing by.|06 22 24 55|CMP|(Laughter) Okay.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 111A/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|06 20 57 01|CC|Okay. And, Jack - -||LMP|(Laughter)||CC|- - When you're not holding on with two hands, we'd like the frame count from you.||LMP-EVA|Wait a minute. Yes.||CDR-EVA|Is that Van Serg over there?||LMP-EVA|Ahhhh -||CC|You have a bearing of 234 - -||LMP-EVA|I think it's - -||CC|- - and a range of 2.1.||LMP-LM|I don't know - no - it's - Okay.|06 20 57 27|LMP-EVA|We got to get around SWP here and then - -||CDR-EVA|Well, let's - yes.||LMP-EVA|- - and then head on more westerly. LMP frame is at 80.||CC|Copy 80.||LMP-EVA|SWP or Bowen, I mean - Bowen, I guess it is.||CDR-EVA|Well, yes.||LMP-EVA|That's SWP over there. Bowen is out here ahead of us.||CDR-EVA|Yes. ... he said two - -||LMP-EVA|Bowen - Bowen isn't much of a crater on the map.||CDR-EVA|- - 225 - What did you say, Bob? 225 what?||CC|234/2.1 - -||||Tape 111A/2||||LMP-EVA|234 - -||CC|Heading ought to be about 240; 240 for a heading for there.||CDR-EVA|Did you hear him? I didn't hear him.||LMP-EVA|240. Are you not reading him?||CDR-EVA|But what did he say for bearing and range? That's what I'm interested in.||CC|234 - -||LMP-LM|240. State bearing and range, Bob.||CC|- - 2.1.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I got that.||CC|Okay. And we think you're even farther north than I was saying. Maybe it's about 215 would be your heading for there.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. I'll find it. 234/2.1.||CC|Roger.||LMP-EVA|And all the big blocks still look like subfloor from the Rover. But big blocks in here are only about a - a third of a meter in diameter. And they're subrounded to subangular. Okay. We're up on the plains again now, just off the brink and slope.|06 20 59 48|LMP-EVA|That sure looks like - looks like outcrop ... down in the East Massif on the lower slopes, if it's here the high albedo is. Doesn't it? See it over there?||CDR-EVA|Yes - Yes. Yes. It does - ... was one of my guidelines for the geophone deployment - ... points.|06 21 00 21|CDR-EVA|There's some more of the blue-gray rock here in the east end of the South Massif down low.||||||Tape 111A/3||LMP-EVA|Yes. It looks like it might have been a slump block or something.||CDR-EVA|Yes. You can see it's blue-gray because of it's contrast with the light mantle.||LMP-EVA|Yes. It might be a slump block, or something - like that.||CDR-EVA|Jack, I'm going to go to the left.||LMP-EVA|You going to go soon? (Laughter) Need 234 - -||CDR-EVA|No, No. I'm going over here. This is closer. That's a shorter cut.||LMP-EVA|Okay, that - that's probably Bowen there, don't you think?||CDR-EVA|I think - -||LMP-EVA|Oh, well - -||CDR-EVA|Well, see, we never got too far - -||CC|How about a - how about a range and bearing, guys.||LMP-EVA|... aren't very far from SWP.||CDR-EVA|Maybe we got too far east. Okay. It's 228/3-4. And we're moving along at 10 to 12 clicks. That's all it'll hack.||CC|Copy that. How about an amps reading? We haven't had one of those for a couple of ...||LMP-EVA|Starting to rain again. Got a crater ahead of you.||CDR-EVA|Oooh, boy.||LMP-EVA|Down-Sun isn't much easier than up-Sun.||CDR-EVA|It's just easier on the eyes. You just can't see any more, that's all. You don't have that static, huh?||||Tape 111A/4||||LMP-EVA|No. Hope you've still got an antenna; I haven't looked recently.||CDR-EVA|Hope there's no holes in the high gain.||LMP-EVA|Might have hit it on a rock.||CDR-EVA|Oh, boy. Okay. The - we're back into the mantle area population of fragments is still 1 percent or so. The crater off to our left, which is at 227 and 3. - What is that?||LMP-EVA|3.1.||CDR-EVA|3?||LMP-EVA|3.3; 227/3.3.||CDR-EVA|? - is a fairly good-sized depression, but it's completely mantled. There's no blocks showing in the wall at all. How do you read. Bob?||CC|Loud and clear. We're listening.|06 21 02 38|LMP-EVA|Now there's that crater in the wall of that depression or hollow near it. And it has one big block in the side as if it penetrated the mantle and exposed some of the wall of the depression. Just about a 30-meter crater. Valley of Taurus-Littrow is not planar.||CDR-EVA|No, it isn't.||LMP-EVA|I'm glad we changed it to a subfloor instead of a plains unit.||LMP-EVA|(Laughter)|06 21 03 21|LMP-EVA|Okay. We're in the inner wall of the depression here, and the rocks still look like subfloor gabbro. Boy, there's certainly not much variety.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Generally, there are few exotics.||CDR-EVA|Ooh, now that's got to be Cochise.||LMP-EVA|Ah, look at Cochise.||||||Tape 111A/5||CDR-EVA|That's Cochise.||CC|Roger. We think you're coming up on Cochise.||CDR-EVA|Get your self a couple pictures while you're looking right at it.||LMP-EVA|Could you swing right. Swing right.||CDR-LM|Bob, we are on the south - or northeastern rim of Cochise. I'm going to work my way around the other side. And Bob - -||CC|Roger. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|- - looking at the western wall of Cochise, I can see a contact within the subfloor between albedo units, one of which is a light tan-gray and the other is a light blue-gray. May reflect the two kinds of subfloor gabbro we've already sampled. Vesicular and nonvesicular. And that contact that looked like it was dipping - apparent dip in the wall - was to the north. And the west wall dipping to the north about 20 degrees.||CC|Okay. Copy that. What - which one's on top? Can you tell?||CDR-EVA|Yes. The blue-gray's on top. I'm sorry.||CC|Thank you. And you got a bearing and range there at the rim of Cochise?||CDR-EVA|I took a picture of it and - Okay. We're at 228/3.0, and we're not - we're headed south and not quite on the - on the east rim.||CC|All right.||CDR-EVA|I'll give you a hack at the east rim.||CDR-EVA|Bob, I got a - a picture of that contact so, I -I was -||LMP-EVA|I took some pictures right into Cochise, too, when we were coming up.||||Tape 111A/6||||CDR-EVA|Good. It'll show on yours, too, probably - I hope.||CDR-EVA|Okay. We're sort of on the inner -||LMP-EVA|Quick; give them a mark.|06 21 05 39|CDR-EVA|MARK, 230/2.9. We're on the east rim.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Well, we're sort of inside the east rim a little bit.||CC|Well, don't get too far inside.||CDR-EVA|We're halfway between the rim and where the blocky wall starts.||CC|All right. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Did you get that, Bob?||CC|Yes. We got that.||LMP-EVA|Cochise is much like Horatio and - actually, more like Catnelot, although not as blocky in the walls, in general, in that it - it has blocky walls but a mantled rim. Again, all the blocks I see in here are big ones. And blocks down to about 20 centimeters are subangular, in general, and appear to be the - have the appearance of the subfloor gabbro, although most of the smaller rocks are not - do not appear to be highly vesicular.||CC|All right. We're copying that all.|06 21 07 05|CDR-EVA|We're at 232 and 2.?.||CC|Roger. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Watch it.||CDR-EVA|You know why - what happened there?||LMP-EVA|What?||CDR-EVA|I was just about to take a picture, and the minute you take your eye off anything -||||||Tape 111A/7||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Yes. I got another view of that contact, and let's put that - let's put that on the northwest wall of Cochise and dipping to the southeast.||LMP-EVA|All right. South and east is to our left.||CDR-EVA|No, no, no, no, no. Put it on the northwest wall dipping to the northeast.||LMP-EVA|Yes, that's right. See that, Geno, can you see that over there?||CDR-EVA|Oh, yes. I can see it now between the gray and blue-gray?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Oh, yes. Yes, I sure do.||LMP-EVA|Can you swing in there, and let me get another shot of it?||CDR-EVA|You betcha.||LMP-EVA|Oh, this is a good view right here. Okay now, I need to have you go left.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I got two of them in there, too.||LMP-EVA|Great.||CDR-EVA|Look at that rock right in front of us. It looks like a contact between a blue and a gray.||LMP-EVA|Oh, yes, there it is. Yes, you're right.||CDR-EVA|We can't get down to it, but take a picture.||LMP-EVA|Well, I think we've done - I think we've got that relationship. I think we got it at station 1, as a matter of fact.||CDR-EVA|But that's a big beautiful boulder on the - -||LMP-EVA|Yes, that's - -||||Tape 111A/8||||CDR-EVA|Inner rim - -||LMP-EVA|- - that's ... a block.||CDR-EVA|- - inner south rim of Cochise.||LMP-EVA|Oooh - -||CDR-EVA|It's a single block.||LMP-EVA|That's how you bend your tires.||CDR-EVA|Well, thatf s what it1s for. Oh, that's a mou -Oh, man, would that be ... - -||LMP-EVA|Well, now, that might be glass covered. That might be a glass coating; the way it sort of hangs on the outside there. Hard to say.|06 21 09 20|CDR-EVA|Okay, we're at 234/2.5.||LMP-EVA|Starting to sling dust. I wonder if we've lost our fender.||CC|Roger. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|No, they're on there tight. ... - -||LMP-EVA|You think that's Van Serg? Right over there.||CDR-EVA|No.||LMP-EVA|There it is. Bet you.|06 21 09 37|CDR-EVA|Yes. I think you're right, because that's just about the right place. Let's see, 234 - okay, is where - and 2.1 is where we want to go, and I'm at 230/2.5.||LMP-EVA|Okay, our - -||CDR-EVA|Pretty close.||LMP-EVA|- - Our block population in - here now on the south rim of Cochise and it's - and up ahead of us looks like it's up to 5 percent. And it's - all looks like subfloor - light to tan subfloor gabbro - or tan-gray. You don't see much blue-gray; not out on here.||||||Tape 111A/9||LMP-EVA|There's a recent hit.||CDR-EVA|This Rover is getting tested for what it was built for now.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|I tell you it handles just the way as advertised, maybe even better.||CC|Okay. We think you guys are getting to the point we ougjht to swing a little bit west to make that 234/2.1.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I am, Bob.||LMP-EVA|I think we - We've got it. Tallyho.||CDR-EVA|Bob - Bob. That's my fix. I'm just navigating to it.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|I know where. I'11 get there.||CC|Roger.||LMP-EVA|We have a Tallyho on Shorty - I mean of Van Serg. How about through there, Geno. Thanks.||CC|Let's not prejudge the crater too much.||CDR-EVA|You want 234/2.1. Okay.||CC|And remember we talked about parking on the southeast rim.||CDR-EVA|It wanders like our wander factor in here has got to be 50 percent.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Bob, you're cut - you're being cut out. I can't tell what you're saying. Isn't that where we want to go, over there?||CDR-EVA|23 - Well, -||||Tape 111A/10||-||LMP-EVA|Well, - look, ... way to get - -||CDR-EVA|- - ... found the crater.||CC|234 or 232 - -||LMP-EVA|No, we didn't ... there on the right.||CC|- - It doesn't make much difference, 17* If you see Van Serg, that's what we want.||CDR-EVA|Well, you're - Let me wander over that way. That's where I want to get, but I couldn't go there because of that -||LMP-EVA|There's a different looking rock there.||CC|And remember, we're talking about parking on the southeast rim.||LMP-EVA|Yes, I think you're going to have to bear right.||CDR-EVA|Yes. That's why I - I've got to get through this field, though.||LMP-EVA|Yes, I know (laughter).||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. We're still primarily in an extreme block field here now. It's up to a 20 percent cover, and - of fragments mostly the subfloor. Some of it looks quite highly shattered. There's -I just saw one piece that looked like a white anorthositic rock.||CDR-EVA|How's this look to you? We can go farther up there, I guess. Let me go farther up.||LMP-EVA|Well, okay, if you can get up.||CDR-EVA|Get a little farther on the southeast.||LMP-EVA|A little higher is apt to overdo it.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|There are - there is some - some grayish rocks that are - -||||||Tape 111A/11||CDR-EVA|Oops! I centered. Right, coining up here. I turn to the right and park right here.||LMP-EVA|- - That have a - somewhat of a swirl texture.|06 21 13 10|CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, we're at 230/2.2.||CC|Copy that. Copy you parked.||CDR-EVA|Yes. What did I say? 230 on that? Yes, bearing is 230/2.2, and I'm parked on a heading of 320, which gives you a better view.||CC|Copy 320 for the parking.||CDR-EVA|Yes, 3-330.||LMP-EVA|Oh, boy. This is getting harder and harder. Got it ... also. Don't know what's wrong with it, now. I mi^it have got it twisted.||CDR-EVA|Here, let me look at it.||LMP-EVA|Got it hooked, but not so I can get it undone.||CDR-EVA|Here let me look at it. I'd say stay put, but I don't think you have any choice.||LMP-EVA|That fender just curled under, that's where we're getting the dust - starting to warp.||CDR-EVA|Look at those other fenders, talk about warping.||LMP-EVA|Did I get it twisted or something?||CDR-EVA|Yes, you did twist it when you put it on. Okay, squanch down.||LMP-EVA|I 'm squanched.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Had one twist in it.||LMP-EVA|Boy, that makes a difference.||CDR-EVA|Sure does. Here. Your footpan1s down, too.||||Tape 111A/12||||LMP-EVA|I'll get it. It's lost it's stiffness in there. Okay - okay, I guess now I'll plan for Shorty, huh? ... Van Serg.||CDR-EVA|Okay, 2 POWER'S ON -||LMP-EVA|Van Serg looks like a blocky rim fresh impact crater right now.||CC|Okay. We copy that. How about scuffing your feet and seeing if it looks orange underneath?||LMP-EVA|Slight differences - Don't worry.||CC|And, Gene, before you go away, we'd like the rest of the Rover readouts, like batteries. And how about a SEP temp readout before one of you guys leave there?|06 21 15 45|CDR-EVA|Get - Can you get that on that side, Jack?||LMP-EVA|I will.||CDR-EVA|Should have TV.||CC|Roger. We have it, and I'm sure that Ed would like a good dusting Job up front.||CDR-EVA|Well, there's so much - -||LMP-EVA|I'll dust it if you can't read it. I'll get it.||CDR-EVA|- - dust. I've got it.||LMP-EVA|I'll get it.||CDR-EVA|- - Just over the gage. It's about 12 - 125 on the SEP.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Boy, everything is really bad now. The fender warped.||CDR-EVA|Yes, the fender cut - dug under. See if you can straighten it out.||CC|Okay, and leave the covers - -||||||Tape 111A/13||CDR-EVA|Okay. Amp hours, 82 and 80. Battery, 122 and off scale low. Forwards Eire 210, 240; Rears are 225 and 2 - 220.||CC|Okay, We copy that.||CDR-EVA|That's just a sample of the kind of - kind of dust we would have got, Jack, if we hadn't of had that fender yesterday. Fender's almost worn out.||LMP-EVA|Can you get a dustbrush, and let's check our camera.||CDR-EVA|Stay where you are, and I'll give you a zappareno wherever you are.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|That it?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Okay, how many bags do I have.||CDR-EVA|I don't know, but I've got a lot of dusting to do here.||LMP-EVA|Do you have a lot of bags?||CDR-EVA|Yes. I must have - I've got four of them is all.||LMP-EVA|I'd better change my bag.||CDR-EVA|Can't even read the Rover.||LMP-EVA|Yes. I have an empty bag on me now, right, a collection bag?||CDR-EVA|Empty.||CC|Okay, 17 --||LMP-EVA|Don't know how much time do we have here?||CC|Okay, 17- We're looking at a nominal, station 9 here. You've got about 25 minutes remaining.||||Tape 111A/14||||CDR-EVA|No such thing as a nominal station anymore.||CC|This may be the first and only one of the traverse||LMP-EVA|The geology won't let it be nominal. Hey, I've got some new bags, Bob.||CC|Okay. We copy that, Jack.||LMP-EVA|And I guess I'm pretty good on film.||CC|Okay. And you're going to get a radial sample here, and so you might check your Rover sample.bag supply.||LMP-EVA|That's right. I want to take that.||CC|And you might - and you might give me frame count or check it to make sure you're okay.|06 21 18 34|LMP-EVA|I just did, and it's 123.||CC|Okay, good enough.||CDR-EVA|How do you want the SEP blankets?||CC|Leave them closed, please, Gene - -||CDR-EVA|Open or closed?||CC|- - as closed as they'll get.||LMP-EVA|CLOSED.||CDR-EVA|We been riding with this thing off?||LMP-EVA|What?||CDR-EVA|SEP?||LMP-EVA|Yes, it should be off.||CDR-EVA|Yes, it is. Doesn't seem like it'd get much data that way. Even if it's hot.||CC|Yes, but it's - it's automatic - -||||||Tape 111A/15||CDR-EVA|I guess they're worried about getting it so hot it - -||CC|It shuts itself off when it gets above 108, so it's no good anyway.||CDR-EVA|Are you kidding? We're - oh, boy.||CC|We've been hoping all day - it's been off all day. We've been hoping that it would - since station 6 -We've been hoping that it would cool down so that we could get some more data, but it's not, obviously.||CDR-EVA|It's not going to make it, Bob.||CC|That's obvious by now.||CDR-EVA|That1 s a - that ' s a shame.||LMP-EVA|This is starting to look like a geological survey expedition. The vehicle's are all covered with dust.||LMP-EVA|Oh, look what's in there.|06 21 20 16|CDR-EVA|I don't think I can read that unless I dust it with a lens brush - Okay. Get my - Okay, can I get by you here?||LMP-EVA|My - my bag look all right to you.||CDR-EVA|Yes, it's still closed.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Okay. What are we going to do here? We're going to go up there and sample on the rim, look at the walls, and the floor, and miscellaneous, and - -||CDR-EVA|Well, we are on the rim ...||LMP-EVA|- - then you're going to take 500 millimeters when you get back to the Rover while I do a radial sample.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||||Tape lllA/16||||LMP-EVA|But the big - the first thing we do is go up to the crater. Bob, I think the mantle objective here really is immaterial and - because the - there's -the blocky ejecta around the crater covers - oh, boy - Well, it looks like it - it extends several hundred toeters out from the rim - say a couple of hundred meters.||CC|All right. Copy that, Jack.||LMP-EVA|We're ijuite a ways - we're pretty close to the rim.||CC|Yes, we can see that.||LMP-EVA|We're pretty close. I'll go up on the rim, Gene, and see What we've got.|06 21 22 21|LMP-EVA|Tiptoe through the tulips (singing) - -||CC|Okfty. Let's get grabs before you guys leave.||LMP-EVA|(Singing) I'm getting it right now. Let me see; anything else you want me to do while I'm here?||CC|Negative.||LMP-EVA|Sure look like shocked rocks to me.||CDR-EVA|Lot of glass splattered on some of these, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|We might even find some shatter cones. But don't tell anybody.||CDR-EVA|Well, I'll say one thing for old Van Serg, it's blocky. Whoo!|06 21 23 22|CDR-EVA|MARK. Gravimeter.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Bob. This is about - I think this is the only clearly - well, I won't even say that. This is at least a blocky - a large blocky rim crater. But even it has the mantle dust ma - material||||||Tape 111A/17|||covering the rim, partially buried rocks. And it's down on the floor, as near as I can tell, and on the walls• The crater itself has a central mound of - of blocks that's probably 50 meters in diameter - that's a little high - 30 meters in diameter. It - Many of the blocks are - -||CDR-EVA|Holy Smoley!||LMP-EVA|- - intensely shattered in that area, as the ones that are on the walls. I don't see any sign of organization of the blocks in the walls right now. There's a possibility that on the west wall, there's an indication that there's slightly darker gray rocks starting about halfway down the crater. And that's - that level is coincident with what appears to be a bench on the northwest wall. And that bench - hints of that bench - it's not continuous, but hints of it axe around on the north wall and, I think, right below us - yes, on the southeast wall. The - We'll start - The rocks are pretty badly broken in many cases. And - well, I haven't seen any real glass yet. Yes. We'll start looking at them a little more carefully.||CDR-EVA|Some of them - That looks like a breccia right there in front of us.||LMP-EVA|Yes. There's some interesting patterns on the surface.||LMP-EVA|Stand by. Wait, wait, wait. I keep - Aw! Sorry, Geno, but -||CDR-EVA|Okay?||LMP-EVA|Okay, there. Afraid I haven't been doing my duty on locators, occasionally.||LMP-EVA|Do that?||CDR-EVA|Yes. I got it.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Gene's tearing apart one of the - -||CDR-EVA|Here. There you go.||||Tape 111A/18||||LMP-EVA|- - very intensely fractured rocks. And it comes off in small flakes. Let's get this one, because this will be the best oriented one for documentation, plus why don't you get that one you've got inside there?||CDR-EVA|Yes, I am.||LMP-EVA|Got a bag?|06 21 27 l4|LMP-EVA|Bag 568 is a fragment from the surface. That's a corner, I think, off the block that Gene documented here.||CDR-EVA|Yes; it is.||LMP-EVA|We'll get - we'll get another sample - that'll be from inside the block.||CDR-EVA|Get it with this real easy. Here's a whole big -we ought to take that just as is.||LMP-EVA|Well, put it - put it in your - put a bag around if we - around one end if we can. Here the other end is smaller.||CDR-EVA|Yes. Hold this - -||LMP-EVA|Let me hold this end. Let me hold it, and you put the bag on.||CDR-EVA|That's breccia, too. That's - -||LMP-EVA|Well, it's - -||CDR-EVA|Well, see that? See the white fragments in there?||LMP-EVA|Yes. It certainly - -||CDR-EVA|It's got a lot of very small - -||LMP-EVA|It - it looks like this big one over here. You know, it might be that the - these are - might be pieces of the projectile. I don't know. Because it doesn't look like - it's not subfloor.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Pin it down.||||||Tape 111A/19||LMP-EVA|Well, that's wrapped in - if you can put it - if you put it end down, it may stay in the bag.||CDR-EVA|I doubt it.||LMP-EVA|What1s the number?|06 21 28 45|CDR-EVA|It's a 480, and it's a - a relatively tabular [sic] shape, and it's about - -||LMP-EVA|And it's going to - -||CDR-EVA|- - 10 inches long.||LMP-EVA|And it's highly friable. It breaks apart.||CDR-EVA|Oh, not so much.||LMP-EVA|In small chips. Well, you can - you did it with your hands there. I call that being friable, compared to what we've seen anyway.||CDR-EVA|Okay, and let me get in after of that.||LMP-EVA|Let me get a - soil - soil right over here. Okay. The soil next to the boulder down about 3 centimeters , is in bag 569-||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Okay. And the soil and chips - about two-thirds of a meter from the boulder - -||CDR-EVA|Get another one?||LMP-EVA|Yes - are in bag 570.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Okay?||CDR-EVA|Let me get over here. You're going to step on your gnomon there.||LMP-EVA|I wouldn't step on my gnomon. I'm going to get this one - crimped. Okay. There, very clearly, is a central, mound. And now that we've looked at||||Tape 111A/20|||||this one, the mound looks like it's composed of gray fragment breccias much like vhat we've just sampled - -||CDR-EVA|...||LMP-LM|- - dark gray. And again it might be related - -||CDR-EVA|Jack.||LMP-EVA|Oh, excuse me. I didn't hear you.||LMP-EVA|Related to the projectile. Now, we've got to see if there is subfloor up here, or whether we're dealing with another unit somewhere.||CDR-EVA|got your after. Okay. I don't see any - -||LMP-EVA|Well, the more coherent rocks - this looks like subfloor.||CDR-EVA|I don't see any orange material either.||LMP-EVA|Not yet.||CDR-EVA|This particular rock we've sampled has tabular fractures, and in one-half of the rock, they are definitely oriented.||LMP-EVA|Boy, I'll tell you, I don't - There's more dust on these rocks. It's harder to see a fresh surface . They're not as clean. That's subfloor.||CDR-EVA|Hey, and even the floor of the crater is mantled down there.||LMP-EVA|You know, that seems - Yes. That seems like a -what you got? A piece of glass?|06 21 31 51|CDR-EVA|Yes, I think it is glass. At least it's glass covered - just glass covered. Houston, I've got an undocumented sample. It's about 2 meters left of where we just sampled. It's a glass-covered -oh, baseball-size rock in 571.||CC|Copy that.||||||Tape 111A/21|06 21 32 14|LMP-EVA|A lot of these blocks up here, Houston, are -particularly the more fractured ones, but even some that aren't - are a gray matrix fragment breccia. And it looks like - really, the fragments are quite fine. There are no - On the rim anyway, we haven't seen any large fragments. The largest I've seen is about 2 centimeters. But down in the mound you can see some fragments that are probably half a meter in diameter.||CDR-EVA|Jack, are you going around that rim of the crater up there?||LMP-EVA|I was just looking at rocks.||CDR-EVA|Well, okay.||LMP-EVA|We - we - -||CDR-EVA|I want to get a pan before we leave back there.||LMP-EVA|Oh, yes. We need to see if - we can get some of the subfloor. I'm not stare I understand what's happened here, yet. This should have brought up subfloor according to the theory, and it hasn't.||CDR-EVA|That looks like some of the - look at some of the breccias - the blue breccias with the white - big old slabby white - with the fracture face with the white inclus ions.||LMP-EVA|Down there.||CDR-EVA|Yes, down in the floor, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Yes, it has that appearance all right. Hey, Gene. Do you see that rock - -||CDR-EVA|That's a - -||LMP-EVA|- - that rock that's fractured in sort of a pyramid shape down there? Out here on the right -the right end of - of the floor down there - that big one?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|It's sort of pointing west.||||Tape 111A/22||||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|It's really neat. That's a unique fracture, isn't it?||CC|Roger, 17 --||LMP-EVA|And there's another one that's fractured almost in a ... - -||CC|- - And we'd like to be moving from here in about 10 minutes, so we probably better be trending back toward the Rover, unless you're seeing something really great out there.||LMP-EVA|Well. Hey, Bob, we ought to - we ought to find out whether or not we got - whether - what the rock is here, if you've got a little time.||CDR-EVA|Jack, do you want me to put this in your bag and start - I'm sorry.||CC|Roger. You got - you got 10 minutes. I'm just telling you to start thinking about getting back.||LMP-EVA|Yes. We're always thinking that way.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. One thing I noticed we do uncover. There's a lot of - oh, 2- 3, 4-millimeter-size fragments of glass we're kicking up all over the place.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Little glass balls.||LMP-EVA|Hey, Gene?||CDR-EVA|Almost like Pele's -||LMP-EVA|Gene?||CDR-EVA|Yes .||LMP-EVA|Can you come over here? I think there's some subfloor here. We ought to - -||CDR-EVA|Okay.||||||Tape 111A/23||LMP-EVA|We ought to try to document it. But I tell you, most of the rocks are the - are the fine-fragment breccias. Let me see if I can't get one of those little - -||CDR-EVA|There's some glass.||LMP-EVA|Hey.||CDR-EVA|You see if they're like Pele's - -||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|- - ... eyeballs or whatever they are.||LMP-EVA|I think we can get some over here. If you're -if you're careful coming over here, we can get glass that looks like it may have crystallized in place there.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I'm talking about those little - little balls, too. See that - -||LMP-EVA|Whoo, take it easy - Take it easy.||CDR-EVA|Where are you? Right there?||LMP-EVA|Yes, but put your gnomon right over here, and we can get that for glass and that for subfloor.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Let me -||LMP-EVA|But I'm not sure that is. I Just - It may be breccia there - Everything is covered with dust here, and it's hard to tell the types. Most of the rocks we're seeing are breccias. Make sure that glass is in your stereo.|06 21 35 45|LMP-EVA|Okay, be careful with it.||CDR-EVA|Oh, shoot!||CDR-EVA|I don't have any bags so -||LMP-EVA|Okay, the glass - looks like a glass agglutinate. Oh, no!||||Tape 111A/24||||LMP-EVA|Didn't break? Good. I think that will survive going back now.||LMP-EVA|Okay. It's a frothy - glass agglutinate is going to be in bag 48l.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|And - and it looks like a - almost like a cowpie -pile-type of bomb, Bob, if you'll pardon the expression.||CC|I will. I don't know whether anybody else - -||LMP-EVA|Although it's not flattened. It's - it's - it's a - it's an aggregate of glass in - or it's a pile of about four fragments, much like the one we're sampling.||CDR-EVA|Jack, we want to get a good scoop sample here. Maybe can we get some of those little fine pieces of glass around.|06 21 37 19|LMP-EVA|And it looks like it's - it's in place from the day it was born.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Oh, gol dig da! I'm having a hard time with this one.||LMP-EVA|A piece of that rock rigiht behind it.||CDR-EVA|If I can -||LMP-EVA|Want a bag?||CDR-EVA|Yes. I'm going to turn around. Just not going to be able to get that one in the bag, I don't think.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Houston. Hy sample's in - 482 is a rock, but it doesn't look like subfloor. It looks like the blue-gray material we've been seeing - the breccia-type material.||CDR-EVA|Yes.||||||Tape 111A/25||LMP-EVA|I don't think there's difference.||CDR-EVA|Got it in!||LMP-EVA|Miggit just as well throw them in ny bag.||CC|Okay, and - -||CDR-EVA|I want a scoop out of here, though, Jack.||CC|17, why don't we get that scoop sample as the first sample of Jack's radial sample, 17?||CDR-EVA|Okay. That's right. You're getting a radial sample. That's fine. I forgot you were doing that.||LMP-EVA|Oh, man.||CDR-EVA|That's all right, Jack. That won't come out. Just-put it in there.||LMP-EVA|Oh, boy.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Let's let that one be the last -||LMP-EVA|Here's one.||CDR-EVA|Well, okay. Those are the last ones that you can take. Got a lock?||LMP-EVA|No, I don't see in my ... on that.|06 21 39 46|CDR-EVA|Okay. Okay, before you go back - I got to go down after a picture here. And I want to get a pan of this thing. We can get a stereo pan - as you start your radial sample.||LMP-EVA|Yes. Are you going to - You - you take the after from there, and I'll go over here and -||CDR-EVA|Okay. You - -||LMP-EVA|Well, wait a minute.||CDR-EVA|- - you need the gnomon?||||Tape 111A/26||||LMP-EVA|No.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I'm going to go over behind me and take part of the stereo.||LMP-EVA|Where are you going to take your pan? Let me see.||CDR-EVA|From - from behind me, where we were.||LMP-EVA|Well, I think I'll just take wy radial right from here to the Rover.||CDR-EVA|That's great. That's great. Just do that, and then you'll be right back at the Rover.||LMP-EVA|And I'll take my pan from here, so you -||CDR-EVA|Man, there's about four or five different modes of travel out here.|06 21 42 06|CDR-EVA|I don't believe it.||LMP-EVA|What?||CDR-EVA|I think I'm out of fiLm.||LMP-EVA|You're out of film?||CDR-EVA|150. And it stopped clicking. Jack, I - I - I didn't get the rest of that crater down there.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|I only got it 12 o'clock and around. Well, shucks.||LMP-EVA|I can get it.||CDR-EVA|Well, here's where I -||LMP-EVA|Well, I'm going to be out of film, too, here before long.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Just don't worry about it then. Just presu on with your radials.||LMP-EVA|I've got - I got a good pan over here. Did you get the crater at all?||||||Tape 111A/27||CDR-EVA|I got the right half of it and probably two-thirds of it, so we're going to - I'm just going to have to let that do. Okay. I'm going to see if I can get some 500s while you're doing that.||LMP-EVA|Hey, this isn't going to be an ideal - radial sample - but it will have to do. Giddyapping over hill and dale (singing).||CDR-EVA|Bob, would you tell me what your primary desires are again on the 500, based upon what we have?||CC|Okay. The primary desire will be the North Massif, the blocks, and the trail.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||CC|And while you're at the Rover, they want you to take the gravimeter off again, and we'll get another Rover and a - well another surface measurement here, as well - to check against the Rover.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Here's a reading. I think I owe you one of those, don't I?||CC|Roger.||CDR-EVA|670, 037, 801; 670, 037, 801.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|I didn't know we were going to do both of these things. I thought we were going to do one or the other. But - if we're going to do it, we might as well do it right.|06 21 44 56|CDR-EVA|MARK it. It's flashing.||LMP-EVA|Okay, bag - stand by - 52 Yankee is at the rim crest.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Well, I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to use the Rover to steady the 500, and see what happens.||||Tape 111A/28||'||LMP-EVA|Oh, I should have let you take this scoop back. Oh, no. Oh, me. Well, shoot! This isn't working out too well, Dr. Parker.||CC|Say again there, Jack.||LMP-EVA|This isn't working out too well. I've got to get rid of this scoop.||CDR-EVA|Just set it there and take your sample. We'll get it.||LMP-EVA|I'll take the samples going back.|06 21 47 46|LMP-EVA|Just like in training, the scoop doesn't stay locked to the ...||CC|Okay, 17. We'd like you to press on. We'll abort the radial sample. We'd like to leave here immediately, if not sooner, to head for station 10. Enough of the 500 millimeters, Gene. And we'll give you some information here on mags. We need the gravimeter put back on the Rover, if you haven't already. If it's on the ground, we didn't get the mark, but it's probably done by now. And we're going to take the DSEA out of the tape recorder here, and we'd like to get that all done pronto.||CDR-EVA|Okay. 85 is the mag count on the 500.||CC|Copy 85 on the 500.||LMP-EVA|I think that's a smart move, Bob. I don't think -I don't think the radial sample's going to tell you much here.||CC|Okay. Let's take a -||LMP-EVA|I don't under - I - I -||CC|Go ahead.||CDR-EVA|Jack, you ought to get a scoop of that dirt, though.||LMP-EVA|Well, there's one scoop - -||CDR-EVA|We don't have a scoop of it, do we?||||||Tape 111A/29||LMP-EVA|Look what's underneath it.||CDR-EVA|Well, I don11 know what1s underneath it.||LMP-EVA|It's white.||CDR-EVA|Well, I wanted to make sure we got some of those small glass balls.||LMP-EVA|Yes, we'll get a scoop of it. Upon the top.||CC|171 we're anxious for you guys to get going.|06 21 49 52|CDR-EVA|Okay. Here's your gravimeter reading from the surface; 670, 057, 101; 670, 057, 101.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|You want me to change my mag at the next station?||LMP-EVA|Come here, Gene, quickly. We can't - we can't leave this. This may be the youngest mantle over -whatever was - -||CDR-EVA|Take pictures of it. I don't have any film.||LMP-EVA|- - was thrown out of the craters.||CDR-EVA|Take pictures of it. Bob, we've got to take 5 more minutes. We'll be right with you.||CDR-EVA|What Jack's done is he dug a - a trench in a - the southwest-northeast direction, and he discovered about 3 inches below - 4 inches below the surface - a very ligjvt-gray material.||LMP-EVA|Possibility here - Careful, Geno.||CDR-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Take that crust.||LMP-EVA|Well, I'm trying -I'm trying to get the - the upper portion there. There we go.|06 21 51 04|LMP-EVA|The first 2 centimeters, bag 483. The next 5 -Ahhh - in 484. Augh!||||Tape 111A/30||||CDR-EVA|Get some?||LMP-EVA|I got quite a bit.||CDR-EVA|That1s enough.||LMP-EVA|I got quite a bit. Here, you got to put that away, don't you?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|And the next 10 centimeters of.the light-gray material, be in - probably in 486, if we're lucky -get it off.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|I think it is 486, right?||CDR-EVA|Yes. 485!||LMP-EVA|485. Okay. What did I say 483, 484? Okay.||CDR-EVA|You with us, Bob?||CC|Roger. We're with you.||LMP-EVA|He's mad at us now.||CC|How'd you guess?|06 21 52 29|LMP-EVA|Okay. The third sample is in 485.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Whoops, sorry. Bob, a possibility here is that the - this upper 6 inches of gray material in here is the latest mantling in the area and the light-colored debris may be what's left over from the impact.||CC|Okay, I copy. I understand. But we'd like to get you going. In qase you didn't get the clue.||CDR-EVA|I knew. We're going. Okay.||LMP-EVA|All right. What else? Magazines.||||||Tape 111A/31||CDR-EVA|No, we'll change them at the next station. Isn't that right, Bob ?||LMP-EVA|No, I've got to have some. I got to get some, or I can't take -||CC|Okay, 17. We need Jack to put on magazine Nancy. And we'd like, Gene, for you to pull out the DSEA tape recorder at this station.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I need a magazine too, Bob. I don't have any film at all.||CC|Roger. That'll be Bravo if you change yours here. You could change it at station 10.||CDR-EVA|I'll change it here. It's just as easy while we're in there.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Okay. You want Bravo, huh?||CDR-EVA|Bravo. And I'll get the tape - I'll get the DSEA. Bravo was outside there, I thought.||LMP-EVA|There you go. Let me get this - hold it one -long enough for me to get this. Then I can get rid of this all at one time.||CDR-EVA|Oh.||LMP-EVA|Well, that's all right.||CDR-EVA|I can't put that back in.||LMP-EVA|Got it?||CDR-EVA|I got - I got Bravo.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I got that one.||CDR-EVA|We lost the dark slide out of Bravo, and it's in the dirt. I'm not going to pick it up.|06 21 54 23|CC|All right. Copy that. There's no point in putting it back in. It probably wouldn't go in anyway.||||Tape 111A/32||||CDR-EVA|Well, that's dirty. Okay. I'm changed. And I don't know what the mag count is, but let me get the DSEA. If this thing is true to form, I'm going to have to get in there - I got to - ... tripped. Well, now what's - Hey, we got some rocks in that big bag. Okay. We're done with the SEP. DSEA is coming out. I hope there's something on it.|06 21 55 45|CDR-EVA|Oh - Jiminy Christmas - I can't even pick up that big bag to close the gate.||CDR-EVA|I've got to - I've got to trip that latch with -with tongs or something to lock it.||CC|Okay. And, Jack; Houston. Over.||LMP-EVA|Go ahead.||CC|Okay, we've - -||LMP-EVA|Go ahead.||CC|- - had a change of heart here again, as usual. And we're going to drop station 10 now that we've heard you so much, and we're going to get a double core here. And we'd like to get the - some football-size rocks while you're doing that. But double core here, and then we're going to leave here and go back to the LM.||LMP-EVA|You don't want a - You don't want a - you don't want a double core here. I don't think we can do it, Bob. It's too rocky.||CDR-EVA|You don't think we'll get through that stuff you just trenched?||LMP-EVA|Well, I'm afraid there are rocks all through it, Gene. We can try, but -||CDR-EVA|Let's try it.||LMP-EVA|Well, I don't like to try things that there is a probability of failure on - if you can - You're just going to lose some time. Okay, mag Nancy in on the LMP's camera.||||||Tape 111A/33||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Well, this is - you can see the rock population here, Houston. But we can try it.||CDR-EVA|Sure. If we get a single, we get a single out of it.||LMP-EVA|Oh, you're doing it, huh?||CDR-EVA|I've got it started.||LMP-EVA|Well, you're not even - okay. Not even going to debate the issue.||CDR-EVA|No, it takes too much time debating it.||LMP-EVA|Well, let's see how much time it takes. I hope you're ri$it.||CC|Okay. And -||CDR-EVA|Okay, and we need a - we need a lower out of my bag.||LMP-EVA|Let me get the core.|06 21 57 44|CDR-EVA|A lower out of my bag is all we need.||LMP-EVA|Watch it. You're in a crater almost.||CDR-EVA|Yes. I want to get ... for you.||CC|Okay. We have to have you guys moving in 10 minutes. And we'd like to also deploy EP number 5 here.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I'll start on the ... - -||LMP-EVA|- - ... the lower 5?||LMP-EVA|This is a lower, right?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||||Tape 111A/34||||LMP-EVA|You got an upper?||CDR-EVA|Yes. Why don't you get 5 out, and I'll start on the core.||LMP-EVA|... And I'll put it - I'll put that right there.||CDR-EVA|Okay. The lower is 50; the upper is 37*||CC|Copy. 50 and 37*||CDR-EVA|You got 5i Jack?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Why don't you put it up - well - You put the gnomon away. Put it fairly near that trench. At least there is some documentation there. I'll try to have the pan going while you're doing it. Okay, Houston. Which way you going to drive out of here?||CDR-EVA|I'm driving out of here -||LMP-EVA|Left or right?||CDR-EVA|I - I've got to go right. I got to go right.|06 21 59 20|LMP-EVA|Okay. Pin 1 is pulled and safe. Pin 2 is pulled -safe. Pin 3 is pulled and safe.||CC|Okay, Jack. And we'll document it back to the Rover, I guess is the best way. That doesn't look too hard, Gene. Until just now.||CDR-EVA|Thank you. Oops, looks like you proved me wrong.||LMP-EVA|The first core was easy; the second one a little tougher; and then it got tough down at the end. There, I'm getting a picture of you. Okay?||CDR-EVA|Okay.||||||Tape 111A/35||LMP-EVA|I got it.||CDR-EVA|You got it from here? Okay.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Core but it wants to slide out. It's full. No rocks in it. It looks like just the same stuff we've been traveling through.||CC|Okay, Jack. I think you better help Gene with that - recovering that core there where the ... going to fall out.||LMP-EVA|You know, I think you're right. And if you'll just wait until I finish the pan, that's exactly what I'm going to do.||CC|Okay. I didn't know what you were doing.|06 22 01 10|CDR-EVA|Bob, it's capped.||CC|Got you. Okay.||CDR-EVA|You hold - just hold the handle.||LMP-EVA|Okay? I can take this one.||CDR-EVA|It's very - very loose soil, Jack. And it's -just any little movement and you'll lose some of it.||CDR-EVA|Let me cap that end. Don't move it.||LMP-EVA|Uh-oh, you're - you almost knocked some out. Get your - you know where your thing is.||CDR-EVA|Yes, but I need you - that - that cap's on you. The last one's gone off the Rover.||LMP-EVA|That's all right. I'll stay here. Go put yours out there. I won't move it.||CDR-EVA|Any little movement and that stuff starts - -||||Tape 111A/36||||LMP-EVA|Yes. Okay.||CDR-EVA|Go - turn around. I'll get the rammer.||LMP-EVA|Okay,||CDR-EVA|Oh, man! Even these pins are getting stiff. Okay, Bob. The top rammed down - oh, almost half way without any effort.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|The ... back on.|06 22 03 14|CDR-EVA|The bottom rammed down about an inch.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Robert. Let's see. Turn around and I'll get this. What was the last thing - let's see -we had to do?||LMP-EVA|A couple of football-size rocks.||CDR-EVA|You got the DSEA?||LMP-EVA|I got it. I got the charge. You got the double core. I got the double core. And I got one sample of a radial sample (laughter).||CC|We got a - that1s a unique one.||LMP-EVA|In my pocket (laughter).||CC|And have we got the gravimeter back on the Rover?||LMP-EVA|Yes; it's on.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|And we want to get a large block. Why don't we -Why don't we - -||CC|Okay, and there's a - -||||||Tape 111A/37||CDR-EVA|No, let's get a couple of them. I've got - I've got one.||CC|- - ... here for a SESC from the shallow trench. We'd also like to have you moving in 4 minutes. That's with wheels rolling in 4 minutes.||LMP-EVA|SESC, huh?||CC|Roger; but we have to have the wheels rolling - -||LMP-EVA|I don't know if we can do that. We can try it.||CC|We want the wheels rolling in 4 minutes, so I don't think it's practical at this time.||CDR-EVA|Bob, we cannot get an SESC in 4 minutes - -||CC|Okay. Copy that - -||CDR-EVA|- - and roll - -||CC|- - Copy that.||CDR-EVA|- - at the same time.|06 22 04 31|CDR-EVA|Now, I've got to push this latch on the - on the gate to get it locked - on the pallet to get it locked.||LMP-EVA|Need some help?||CDR-EVA|Push the pallet while I trip the latch, will you? Because I got to trip the latch. There's so much dust in that core.||LMP-EVA|Get it?||CDR-EVA|No. No. Wait a minute. Open it up. Wait a minute.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Now - now that's where - now let me trip it.||||Tape lllA/38||||LMP-EVA|Okay. Try it.||CDR-EVA|Locked?||LMP-EVA|Yes. Yes.||CDR-EVA|Should be locked now.||LMP-EVA|That got it. That got it.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Got a big rock there, too?||LMP-EVA|It's a - well, you know, the thing that amazes me is that there's no subfloor around here.||CDR-EVA|I got one here.|06 22 05 47|CDR-EVA|Okay. I'm about ready to clean up the Rover here.||CC|Okay, 17. What's out there in the distance on a hillside in the field of view of the camera? The camera is pointing at it. Oh, I'll bet that's the - that's the - -||CDR-EVA|What's out there in the distance. Which hill? Let me see the - -||CC|- - that's the flag, I bet, on the charge.||CDR-EVA|Yes, but it's only - you're looking right at it, but it's only 10 meters away.||CC|Okay. It's hanging in front of the hills. That's the problem.||CDR-EVA|You're looking right at the flag.||CC|Okay. It's hanging in front of the hills. We thought we had an artifact or something like that. Okay. Press on.||LMP-EVA|Bob, bag 486 is a light-colored rock taken about 3 meters to the right of the Rover. It should be - you should be able to pick it out in that last pan, unless the focus was bad.||||||Tape 111A/39||CDR-EVA|Bob, you got all your TG readings ?||CC|Roger. We've got that. We'd like to have you climb on.||CDR-EVA|You want the LCRU off?|06 22 07 08|CC|Roger. Let's go to LCRU power off.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Jack, let's - better get going.||LMP-EVA|Yes. You know, I don't think there is any subfloor in here. The rocks are so dust covered that it's hard to be sure, but no rock I picked up looked like subfloor.||CDR-EVA|Get on there one time. Ready? I got three of them that time.||LMP-EVA|(Laughter)||CC|17, Houston. Do you read me through the - the LM?||LMP-EVA|You're loud and clear.||CC|Roger. Thank you.||LMP-EVA|I hope they came out.||CDR-EVA|I get that twisted this time, if I can get off.||LMP-EVA|Oh, let's see if old twinkletoes can do it.||CDR-EVA|Jack, there's a big - a big one right there in my floor pan. That's what I did last time.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I'm on, strangely enough.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Let's see. Okay. The charge is off to the - right.||LMP-EVA|Yes, you're all - You can clear it this way or - -||CDR-EVA|Yes. I see it. I see it.||||Tape 111A/40||||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|I bet you they thought there was some more orange soil over there on the hills.||CDR-EVA|Get out of this block field, we'll be able to move it a little bit.||LMP-EVA|I wonder where we stand on time.|06 22 09 25|CDR-EVA|Well, we've been out about 5 hours and 20 minutes or so.||LMP-EVA|Where is it - where are we headed, now that we are moving?||CC|That's affirm - -||CDR-EVA|Well, I'm trying to get around - trying to get out of the block field here, then I'll head back to the southwest. We going to Sherlock at all, Bob?||CC|No, we're going ... follow the ... - -||LMP-EVA|That must be Gatsby over there.||CC|And a reminder, Jack. We can get lots of photos. We've got lots of film left right now.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CC|And, IT* Gene, I guess you're the one that took the SEP out. If you could give me - do you remember the reading of the SEP temperature when you broke it down?||CDR-EVA|Didn't even look, Bob.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|It was 125 - 125 when we started the station.||CC|Roger. Copy that.||||||Tape 111A/41||CDR-EVA|That's Gatsby there, I guess, huh?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|It's not - it's not unlike Van Serg, though. Hey, you know that looks like mantling.||LMP-EVA|Hopefully, we can get a - watch your rock - there you go - we can get a shot looking back to the northwest - -||CDR-EVA|Yes, I'll get that when I - -||LMP-EVA|- - into Gatsby, because it looks like the mantle streams over the - the side from the southwest. Can you swing to your right - get up a little closer to the rim, there?||CDR-EVA|Hey, here's a couple fragments in spots -||LMP-EVA|Look at that. See that?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|See that structure. See how the - -||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|- - See how the mantle streams over -||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|- from the northwest. Can you get that?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|And from the southwest.||CDR-EVA|Got it?||LMP-EVA|Yes. Go ahead. Keep going. Good shape. Got it.|06 22 11 4l|CDR-EVA|We're 236/2.1.||||Tape 111A/42||||LMP-EVA|Bob, what I'm looking at is the - northwest portion of Gatsby, where there's a very very concentrated block field on the inner wall, except where there are, on the southwest, three streams and on the northwest and north a continuous stream, if you will, on band, radial band, of mantle that is bur - appears to be burying that field, overlying and mantling the field. We got some pretty pictures of it, I think.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Bob, I'm more and more convinced there's a mantle. One possibility, I guess, is that, if it's a pyroclastic mantle, that in the lunar vacuum environment and with whatever volatiles we're dealing with, the stuff becomes extremely fine upon vesiculation. We may have been on it all the time and not known it - as far as recognizing it.||CDR-EVA|As soon as we come through this draw, ... smooth or free of any debris or boulders it is on the other side of the upslope.||LMP-EVA|Yes. Watch it.||CDR-EVA|Bob, do we have an extra EP?||CC|No. We have two of them behind you. We're going to deploy - we're going to deploy one. I'll give you a reading soon on that.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Well, one - one I deploy at the end I know. I thought we had an extra one here somewhere.||CC|Okay. Yes, that's what I - Okay, that's the one we were planning on deploying all along, and it's there. We'll be deploying at a range of 0.1, which is just before you get to the SEP.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|I guess Sherlock's going to be right over the top over here. I saw it when we were on that other ridge.||||||Tape 111A/43||CDR-EVA|Hey, you know, there's a lot of bad landing places around here. That old Sun angle, I think, shows most of them up. Bob, I - -||CC|And, Geno, we were looking - -||CDR-EVA|I don't under - -||CC|- - at the map here - -||CDR-EVA|- - I don't unders - -||CC|- - and if you keep going straight to the LM, you're probably going to run into this crater area around San Luis Rey. You probably ought to head somewhat south of directly back to the LM, so we can at least tip the - western edge of Sherlock and then pick it up and go from there back to the SEP. It looks like it might be rather rough there in that dotted-lined area, if you can look at the backside of your map, Jack.|06 22 15 00|CDR-EVA|Bob, I've already been doing it. I'm at 244/1.7-||CC|Copy that. Thank you.||CDR-EVA|Already been doing that.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|And, Bob, about - about 200 meters back, we crossed back into our standard mantle surface of about 1-percent fragment cover - -||CC|Okay 200 meters back, you - Okay. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|- - out of this - the block field, which -||LMP-EVA|I can see the LM.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I can see the LM. And there's Sherlock, where those blocks are.||LMP-EVA|Yes, that's the block field, the Sherlock block field; that's right. That is a block field.||||Tape 111A/44||||CDR-EVA|Some big ones there.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Old station 10. I might even call it 10 Alpha in honor of the Apollo Program Office. The - -||CC|10 Bravo, Apollo.||CDR-EVA|- - Apollo Spacecraft Program Office.||CDR-EVA|0hs that's right. 10 Bravo. I knew I'd never get that straight.||CC|Do those blocks look like gabbros, you guys?||CDR-EVA|How fast do you think we're going, Jack, without looking?||LMP-EVA|I think we're going about 18 clicks.||CDR-EVA|Hey, you're just about right. Seems like the first time we've been able to go downhill.||LMP-EVA|(Laughter)||CDR-EVA|Not really.||LMP-EVA|Pull close to this big block, if you can.||CDR-EVA|Oh, yes.||LMP-EVA|And I'll try to get a reading on what it is - some pictures of it as we come up to it.||CDR-EVA|Yes. Boy that's a big one.||LMP-EVA|Watch it! ... Looks like our old friend, the subfloor - -||CDR-EVA|Subfloor, isn't it? Yes.||LMP-EVA|Yes. Vesicular subfloor. Vesicles are about a centimeter maximum size. Didn't look like they were - they look like they're fairly evenly sorted And the rock itself seemed to be massif.||||||Tape 111A/45|06 22 IT 08|CDR-EVA|250/1.4.||CC|250/1.4.||LMP-EVA|Okay, we're back into a - we're back into about a 5-percent rock cover as we cross the edge of the Sherlock block field.||CDR-EVA|That's Sherlock over that rim over there.||LMP-EVA|Yes. Yes, Once again, all these subfloor blocks look as if they're buried. Now - not mantle, necessarily, except maybe that one. Can you swing right, just a tad?|06 22 IT 4l|CDR-EVA|That one's got the mantle blowing up on it, in it - -||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|- - in it's fractures and everything.||LMP-EVA|That's the best example of that, I think.||CDR-EVA|Take a picture of that?||LMP-EVA|I got it. I got it.||CDR-EVA|Watch it.||LMP-EVA|Got it; got it.||CC|Okay. Now, do those blocks look like the same subfloor gabbro?||CDR-EVA|Yes, that's just got the mantle -||LMP-EVA|Watch it.||CDR-EVA|... one of those.||LMP-EVA|Yes. Everything in here so far is the tan-gray subfloor gabbro that I've seen. I haven't -Oh, there's one over there that's a blue-gray. But blue-gray is not abundant.||||Tape 111A/46||||CC|Okay. Copy that. And, 17, as you're getting closer, we're going to want an LRV sample at 1.1 on the range.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|What are we now? 1.2?||CDR-EVA|1.2. Okay. We'll try to get block and soil.||CC|That'd be good.||LMP-EVA|There's a fresh little pit.||LMP-EVA|Bob, I am continually impressed by the lack of exotic fragments in here.||CDR-EVA|Hey, Jack. How about picking out a place over there?||LMP-EVA|Okay. If you head into that little - Well that's a crater there.||CDR-EVA|Let me get around it. We can go a little bit further.||LMP-EVA|Yes. Maybe - -||CDR-EVA|I'll go up on that flat area up there.||LMP-EVA|Yes, yes. There are a lots of little fragments over there by that area - ha, ha.||CDR-EVA|Any time.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Now swing a shallow turn. Whoa. Yes, that ought to ...||CDR-EVA|- Did you get any of those?||LMP-EVA|Unfortunately, I can't see them - the shadow.||CDR-EVA|How about that one right in front of you, in front of the television camera shadow. See that little one up there? Right there. With the - -||LMP-EVA|It's a little big, I think.||||||Tape 111A/U7||CDR-EVA|Upper right, no upper right. Straight up the line||LMP-EVA|Oh, okay. Yes. If you can get over there, I can get it.||CDR-EVA|I can get there.||LMP-EVA|Oh, I guess I had the wrong - I guess I wasn't looking at the right one. The shadow is making it impossible to see down there. Now, see what you can get.|06 22 20 04|CDR-EVA|Bob, we're at 253/1.1.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|You're going to have to - If we do another sample, you're going to have to swing right so I can -see. I can't see this way.||CDR-EVA|Yes.|06 22 20 28|LMP-EVA|And 53 Yankee.||CC|Copy that. Is that soil or rock?||LMP-EVA|That's soil. I can't see to get a rock.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Go forward just a little bit, Gene.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Bet you're going to get yourself in a box there.||CDR-EVA|No, that's all right.||LMP-EVA|Whoa.||CDR-EVA|Oh, boy, sorry.||LMP-EVA|Little more. Okay.||CDR-EVA|Get it?||LMP-EVA|I will. Got it.||||Tape 111A/48||||CDR-EVA|I can't see the LM anymore.|06 22 21 10|LMP-EVA|Okay. The rock fragments, that's 54 Yankee. Ahhl||CDR-EVA|Okay. You got a rock right in front of you, don't you? I see it. Rolled over. Good old Rover.||LMP-EVA|LMP frame for that sample - Looks like about 60.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|60! Have I taken 60 pictures?||CDR-EVA|Boy, these rock fields are something else again.||LMP-EVA|Yes, 60. Looks like some of our gray variety of||CC|subfloor up here - around the rim of that little crater. You know, I'm starting to think that maybe the gray relatively nonvesicular subfloor may be deeper - deeper fraction, based on what we saw - well, actually, though, let's see - that could have been overturn, I don't know. Take that back. There just isn't much of it around here, although we saw a lot of it in the wall of Cochise. Roger. We got that.|06 22 23 02|CDR-EVA|What do you think this is, San Luis Rey? We're||LMP-EVA|at 252/0.9. I wouldn't doubt it at all. I'll bet that's San||CC|Luis Rey. Around the east side of it - Mariner and San Luis Rey. They're shallow - filled with rocks. As close as we can tell, you're at one or the|06 22 23 36|CDR-EVA|other of them. Boy, I tell you they're a lot - Okay. We're||CC|at 250/0.9. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Mariner should look pretty fresh.||||||Tape 111A/49||LMP-EVA|Boy, I certainly don't see much variety other than the gray and the tan subfloor variety. There's old Challenger.||CDR-EVA|There she is. Pretty as a picture. Boy, I tell you, there's no getting out of this stuff. You go from one to the other.||CC|Okay, 17 --||CDR-EVA|I don't know whether I said it or not - -|06 22 24 25|CC|Gene, your range is 0.1. We're going to deploy the quarter-pound charge, and that'll be Jack's getting off to deploy it like we talked about last night.||CDR-EVA|Okay. That * s EP-2, Jack.||LMP-EVA|EP-2; right.||LMP-EVA|Bob, we're still - we're moving in and out of areas of say 1-percent to 5- to 10-percent blockiness. And where it gets blocky - not only is it more blocky, but we seem to have more of the medium-sized craters in the range of 20- to 5-meter-diameter craters. That may be Mariner right there.||LMP-EVA|How do you read, Bob?||CC|Loud and clear. Loud and clear.||LMP-EVA|Hey, Van Serg, let me mention again, was an unusual experience in the plains geology here. That must be part of San Luis Rey or Mariner, one.||CDR-EVA|Yes. That's pretty deep. Pretty deep.||LMP-EVA|Yes , it is.|06 22 26 13|CDR-EVA|It's really big. Yes, we're at 252 and 0.6.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|The crater on our left - that is, south of us - is a large crater. It's somewhat deeper than craters of the same size that we've seen. And it, too,||||Tape 111A/50|||||though, has - its blocks - mainly - large blocks mainly in the walls, although there are blocks -blocks up here in the rim, occasionally up to 3 meters.||LMP-EVA|Look at that string of blocks over there - that may be it.||CDR-EVA|Yes .||LMP-EVA|That's an edge of a crater, I guess.||CDR-EVA|Want a picture of that?||LMP-EVA|Got it. Look at the way that thing's fractured.||CDR-EVA|Yes, this is the San Luis Rey, Luis complex, because see how elongated it is?||LMP-EVA|Yes. Yes.||CDR-EVA|Fact is, we're going to cut right through the western half here.|06 22 2? 30|CDR-EVA|We're at 244/0.4.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Bob, I may have said earl - early - early on up there at Van Serg that I saw subfloor, but we never did sample any that I know of. And the dust was thick enough that I'm just not sure. Breccias were the most obvious thing there.||CC|Okay. Most interesting.||LMP-EVA|It might have been a window in the plains here, of some kind. But - it's strange to see it there, with so much subfloor all around it that we saw.|06 22 28 29|CC|And, Jack, you're going to get a feedwater tone pretty soon.||LMP-EVA|Got it. Hey, I should be in OFF now.|06 22 28 51|CDR-EVA|252 and 0.2.||||||Tape 111A/51||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|There she is.|06 22 28 56|CC|And as soon as we get to the 0.1, let's stop and deploy the charge.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 111B/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|06 22 45 XX||BEGIN LUNAR REV 42|06 23 10 12|CC|America, Houston.||CC|America, Houston.||CC|America, Houston.||CC|America, Houston.||CC|America, Houston.|06 23 13 49|CMP|Okay, Houston.

It won't all fit in one jettison bag.||CC|Ron, just to update you on several things that happened while you were on the back side this time, the surface crew is at the LM and did their - they're in the close-out procedures there. And they unveiled the plaque and read a message to the school children on the world, And they received a telephone call from Dr. Fletcher, who said he'd been in close contact with the White||||Tape 111B/2|||||House and was following - they - the White House was following the journey very closely and expressed the good wishes of all people down here to all of you up there.|06 23 17 31|CMP|Hey, that's mighty fine, by gosh.|06 23 33 04|CC|Ron, sorry to interrupt you eating, but could you take the TANK 2 and 3 FANs to ON? We're trying to get the pressures up prior to sleep.|06 23 33 16|CMP|Okay. 2 and 3 are ON.|06 23 34 39|CMP|You know, through these glasses, Stoney still looks like it's a light - ligiht tannish-orange. And it's - doesn't come all the way down to the center of the crater. It's kind of tangent to the north edge or tangent to the edge - it's perpendicular to the scarp line, itself, as it goes down through there.||CC|Roger; copy.||CMP|Man, it's hard to see that -|06 23 36 09|CMP|Everytime I focus on F Crater (laughter) I jiggle a little bit, and I can't focus.||CC|Roger. Sounds like you use binculars at a football game, huh?||CMP|... stablize binocs.||CMP|Yes, these - you know you need the 10 power, but you sure need something to stabilize it.||CC|Roger.||CMP|You know, I looked down here, - Oh, boy! Just between Tacquet and Menelaus ana off to the west of Menelaus, there's a crater that's about 10 kilometers in diameter. And just to the right of it, out in the brown stuff, there's a brand-new spanking-fresh impact crater that has brown ejecta on it. And then some of the other craters - that crater happens to be right on the edge of the||||||Tape 111B/3|||brownish-type material, right over one of the rilles. Hope I can mark that on a picture on the map. And some of the other craters about that same size, around the area, out in there, they have the light-colored ejecta just like the normal small impact craters - recent impact craters out in the Mare Serenitatis itself.|06 23 40 56|CC|Roger, Ron.||CC|Ron, we'd like to get ready - started on some of these state vectors earlier - this state vector, and the jet-on monitor. So if you'll get ACCEPT, we'd appreciate it.||CMP|Okay, you can have it, now. It that - Yes, let's see. Clear the computer for you.||CC|Ron, just for my information - -||CMP|There you have it.||CC|- - I'm sure we - the back room's got it. Could you pinpoint that new crater between Tacquet and Menelaus? Is it what - like halfway between, or something like that. Is it on a check line? Or is it in the rilles there from Tacquet, say east -west of Tacquet, but in the rille area.|06 23 4l 53|CMP|It's - Let me get my map.||CC|Oh, that's all rigiht, Ron. It's not that - don't need it that close. Don't want to interrupt your eating.||CMP|No, that's all right.||CMP|That crater is closer to Menelaus - Melanoff, whatever it is.||CC|Okay.|06 23 42 49|CMP|And it's almost directly east of Menelaus.||||Tape 111B/4||||CC|Roger. I'll put a mark here and mark it on my map so you can look at it preflight - postflight.||CMP|Okay.||CMP|You know, I was looking at D-Caldera and you got a lobate - a lobate flow front sticking down in the crazy thing. I'll be darned.||CC|Must be amazing up there. That whole scene seems to change as that terminator is shifting - each rev is something is different in each area, because of that - Sun angle, I'm sure. But - -||CMP|Yes.||CC|- - But, bqy --||CMP|You know, it's almost like - what I originally said, you know, like - maybe there's a high spot or a dry spot and you try to wet it, you know?||CC|Roger; I understand exactly what you're talking about.||CMP|The flow has come up to it - Yes. That's what it looks like. Just like that.||CC|Kind of like a waxed surface, where you throw water on it and it - and the surface tension gathers it together in various lumps and the rest isn't clear.||CMP|Yes. Yes, that's it.|06 23 44 47|CMP|And the part that the waxed surface - so to speak -in analogy there, is a light bluish-gray.||CMP|Picture number 1 on the Nikon was looking south along the terminator in the rilles east - west of Aristoteles.||CMP|And the picture number 2 is looking towara Timocharis.||||||Tape 111B/5||CC|Say again. Looking towards where?|06 23 48 12|CMP|Timocharis.||CC|Okay.||CMP|Timocharis is right on the terminator now, the middle - -||CC|Roger. Got it.||CMP|On that crater that has the definite tan ejecta blanket, if you'll go - directly north - directly north of the center of the crater Auwers, A-u-w-e-r-s, until you come out about one of those rilles there in the Tacquet area, that's about where it Is.||CC|Roger. Got it.||CMP|Well, I had better get busy and start eating, I guess.||CC|Roger. You have got to eat here and then - Well, don't get too busy eating. You've supposed to have been eating. I've got to read you up a TEI-55 pad, if you want to take that - -||CMP|Oh.

Okay, it's all yours on the Flight Plan, and - Ron, we might point out that, if you get going into the presleep checklist here, in the VHF comm configuration. Get that done, then there's a break - you'll lose comm and you'll have a 15 - 20 minute break, you can jump into your eat and then go right to bed.||CMP|Oh, okay.||CC|Ron, my last call, I promise. I need - Here's your H2 tank configuration. We want TANK 1 and 2, FANs to OFF. H2 TANK 3 FAN to AUTO. And you can delete cryo stir from the presleep checklist.||||||Tape 111B/7||CMP|Okay.

And, the Doctor's just - -||CMP|Okay.||CC|- - wanted one question - whether or not the cream had done any good on those spots where the ZPN was? Has it made it feel better?||CMP|Yes, it did, as a matter of fact. And, I forgot to look suid see if it is still red.||CC|That's all right. As long as it made it feel better.||CMP|There's a little bitty spot that must have been the center of it. It's only about one-eighth of an inch in diameter. It's still a little bit red, but the rest of the redness is all gone.

That's right.||CDR-EVA|No, you're SEP when I ... - -||CC|We're going to let you play the return to the ALSEP game there, Jack.

And let's - let me brief you here on the closeout tonight, 17- A number of things we -we're going to do here that are slightly different. We've got some stuff for you over at the ALSEP, Jack, and I'll get with you when you go over there. Nothing we have to worry about in the meanwhile. When we unload the Rover, we're going to take the SESC out, and we're going to use that to collect the contaminated sample||||||Tape 112A/7|||out behind the footpad there as per plan, and when we take the traverse gravimeter off, we're going to want to get both a grav and a bias reading, because the pallet was swinging in the breeze there. Otherwise, let's press on with the closeout, and we'll get with you as times change.|06 22 40 11|CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. The core tubes are going in SCB-7 -I mean - Yes, 7-||CC|Okay. I copy that.||CDR-EVA|You should have TV, Bob.||CC|Roger. We have TV. Thank you.||CDR-EVA|Did you get my bag already?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Jack?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|We'll have one more to put in here. I'm just going to lay this one over here. Yes, the big one. Man, there's some big ones in there, too.||LMP-EVA|We can get some of that subfloor.||CDR-EVA|Yes, there's one in my footpan, too. You see it there?||LMP-EVA|Yes, we'll have to - -||CDR-EVA|Why don't you leave that there for a minute? Okay What did you say about the TGE, Bob?||CC|Okay. We'd like to take TGE, of course, as we planned. Take it off, and we'll try and get both a grav and a bias reading. You might initiate one of them now. We'll initiate another one later on. We've got plenty of time while it's sitting on the ground there to - to do our thing with it.||||Tape 112A/8||||CDR-EVA|...--||CC|I see where you've got ... coming up pretty soon, Gene.|06 22 4l 53|CDR-EVA|Bob, I already got it and I'm in AUTO. Just about 30 seconds ago.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay. How are we fixed for samples? Here's 5, and it's about 1/2 to 3/4 full.||LMP-EVA|Well, let's dump - -||CDR-EVA|We've got to carry the SECS up.||LMP-EVA|- - let's dump these - -||CDR-EVA|We got 3.||LMP-EVA|- - 3 in there, the Rover samples.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Okay. We probably ought to put the SESC in there, huh? If there's room for it.||CC|Yes, let's put the SESC someplace - -||CDR-EVA|Where do you want the SESC, Bob?||CC|Let's put the SESC someplace where it's accessible to get that contamination sample. We probably want to get it before you go off to the ALSEP, but there's no real hurry on that. We'll see what works in best. I'm not sure where the most convenient place for you - -||CDR-EVA|Yes. Why don't we get it now, and then we can -then we can have this bag - -||CC|- - to put it right offhand is.||CC|That' s probably is the - -||||||Tape 112A/9||CDR-EVA|Let's get it now. We can get the bag cleaned up. We can put it in bag 5*||CC|Roger. There's probably not very many convenient places to put it. That sounds like a good idea to me.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Let - let me my scoop.||CDR-EVA|Get your scoop. Let's get it over with.||LMP-EVA|Say again, Bob. You want that - I don't have a scoop, I don't even have a rake.||CDR-EVA|They're both gone, huh?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Use your - your Rover sampler.||LMP-EVA|Yes. They both fell off when that thing opened.||CDR-EVA|Yes .||CDR-EVA|Here's a full core tube we can't forget.||LMP-EVA|Yes, oh, that goes in the - -||CDR-EVA|Is there room for it?|06 22 43 37|LMP-EVA|Yes, why don't you get that scoop off, and I'll put it over here in 4. I mean in 7•||CDR-EVA|That was a good time to lose it. I'm glad we didn't lose it (laughter) any earlier. If we were going to lose it, that couldn't have been more ideal.||LMP-EVA|Yes. That was appropriate, I guess.||CDR-EVA|We got two - we've got two empty core tubes. Feel like we took a lot of them, though.||LMP-EVA|We'll get it. We'll use them, maybe.||||Tape 112A/10||||CDR-EVA|Back here.||CC|Okay. We confirm that. Please go forward - -||LMP-EVA|Hey, I'm getting this ... - -||CC|- - and don't have to worry about bringing back, huh?||CDR-EVA|Here's your thing.||LMP-EVA||06 22 44 20|CDR-EVA|We're going to get this SESC now, and get it out of the way, Bob.||CC|Roger. We agree with that.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Minus-Z , huh? You want it in front of the minus-Z footpad?||CC|Roger. Sort of underneath where you probably had the - -||LMP-EVA|Looks like a good place.||CC|- - solar side of the cosmic ray experiment there. Between the SES - between the footpad and the ALSEP doors there.||LMP-EVA|Full?||CDR-EVA|Oh, I've got about an inch to go.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|... me. Let's fill it up.||LMP-EVA|Looks good.|06 22 45 40|CC|Okay. And both you - your feedwaters are up, 1?5 so things look good.||CDR-EVA|Thank you.||||||Tape 112A/11||CDR-EVA|Would you brush the - that white thing off for me?||LMP-EVA|Yes. Here, let me get - there, you got her.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Take a couple over here.||LMP-EVA|Let me go past the radar. Good job.|06 22 46 43|LMP-EVA|Bob, radar's built better. I'm on frame 96, and the short can sample - contaminated sample is documented by two stereopairs prior to that. And the before is the cosmic ray pictures.||CC|Copy that.||CC|Okay. And which SES - which SCB is that going in, Jack?||LMP-EVA|Number 5•||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Okay. The SCB's in - the SCB's in 5- That what you have?||CDR-EVA|Yes, short can in 5•||LMP-EVA|The ... short (laughter) SCB. Okay.||CC|Okay. And while you're doing that - -||CDR-EVA|Yes . He can ... your - let me get this - -||CC|- - remember, I want inventories of the stuff as it comes off the Rover and where you put it over there by the footpad, so we can help you keep track of it.|06 22 4? 47|LMP-EVA|Okay. I've got the - we've got the big bag, bag 7S bag bag 4 at the footpad.||CC|Copy that. We've also got SCB-3 with the Rover samples in it on the Rover, if there - if you have any - yes, you have some of those today.||LMP-EVA|No, we - we emp - we emptied those into 5.||||Tape 112A/12||||CC|Okay. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. The gravimeter's on the surface. And you want a gravity reading and a bias reading, is that correct?||CC|Roger. We'll get the grav first.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob.|06 22 48 34|CDR-EVA|MARK it. Let's see, where am I?||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|What did you do with the - -||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|- - gravimeter - You've got another big rock over here from the - -||LMP-EVA|It's in my footpan.||CDR-EVA|That's from station 9» right?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|That's what I told them. Station 9s I a football-size rock, and I've put it in there.||LMP-EVA|Well, we eventually lost one clamp. Let's see what we've got left on here.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Gene's football-sized rock looks like it migiht be glass coated. And it might even have a shatter cone or two on it.||CC|Okay, Jack.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I'll let you get - -||LMP-EVA|I don't know what you're focused on - -||CC|And--||LMP-EVA|- - but here's his rock.||||||Tape 112A/13||CC|- - and, Jack, we're making plans here, to change the camera usage at the end of EVA here. And we're going to let you take commander's camera out to the ALSEP and take a few photos that people think we need. And Gene's going to take your camera out and document the geophone. When he deploys it, we will not deploy it for the longterm experiment, however. And we'll bring both back, and carry them to the ETB when we get done.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay. We've got to reverse the rolls of the camera here.||LMP-EVA|While you're getting that, we've got to doff our harnesses. Let me - before you take this - -||CDR-EVA|Are you going to start loading the ETB yet or not?||LMP-EVA|Well, I'm just about there.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I'll be right with you.|06 22 51 46|CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. I've got the cosmic ray In the ETB.||CC|Roger. Copy that. It's been in there all along, hasn't it?||CDR-EVA|Yes.|06 22 52 02|LMP-EVA|Mag Foxtrot, or Franny, I guess, we changed it to, Mag Donna, the DSEA. Mag Echo. Mag Linda. Mag Mary.||CDR-EVA|That's the only fallacy. They're not even watching this. Come over here and watch me, Ed. Oh, me. Let me have it.||LMP-EVA|Wait a minute. Move over that way. He - he ce,n't - Okay. ... - -||CDR-EVA|Did you see me?||LMP-EVA|- - see if it comes off.||||Tape 112A/14||||CDR-EVA|Nod your camera if you can see me.||CC|Roger. We can see you.||LMP-EVA|It's taking too long. Just take it off. Is it off? ... --||CC|That's - that's - that is almost ... at the Cape. Roger.||CDR-EVA|Jack, wait - wait - wait a minute before you -Hey, Bob, are we going to need those other core tubes?||CC|We'd like to have you leave the two core tubes and the extension handle and the hammer and I suppose the core cap dispenser here. If we get back in time from doing all our appointed tasks at the VIP site and at the ALSEP, we'll try and drive a double core here to end things up with a bang.||CDR-EVA|Don't leave it - don't - don't leave it there. Do it. No, don't leave it there.||LMP-EVA|Oh, I'll leave it here. You got it.||CDR-EVA|We'll play games with the extension handle, but that's all right.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Let me set them over here. Where am I? Okay. Big bag, all those - -||CC|17, did you guys leave your - -||LMP-EVA|Don't need the LRV sampler any more.||CC|- - extension handles when that pallet came open?||CDR-EVA|Yes, but we can - I can still drive a core with the hammer if we need to.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||||||Tape 112A/15||CDR-EVA|I think.|06 22 58 43|LMP-EVA|Yes. One went with the rake, and one went with the scoop. Okay, Bob. As I read down that page, it looks like we got it. The ETB check, I think we had four mags in there, and the DSEA, and the maps, and the cosmic ray.||CC|Roger. You've got six mags.||CDR-EVA|Okay, and - —||LMP-EVA|I guess I'm ready to go to the - -||CDR-EVA|Wait a minute. I want you to do something.||CC|Okay. One - -||LMP-EVA|Six mags, is it?||CC|- - one further question.||LMP-EVA|You want these - We don't have - -||CC|- - Did all the FSRs get off the Rover into the big bag?||LMP-EVA|That's affirm.||CDR-EVA|Yes, ... more than you need anyway. That's color. Why don't you see if you can grab a couple? Yes, right here.||CDR-EVA|Are you through with the 500?||CC|Roger. We're through with the 500.||CDR-EVA|Jack, where is the cosmic ray? Did you put that in the ETB already?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|I don't think the 500's working anymore, anyway.||CDR-EVA|It was working ... - -||||Tape 112A/16||||LMP-EVA|There it is.||CDR-EVA|- - I used it.||LMP-EVA|There it is. Okay. Film cycle. Three times.||LMP-EVA|... wait a minute ... Okay. Okay. In go the scissors.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I'm going to go get a gravimeter reading.||LMP-EVA|Now, let's see. ... There it is.|06 22 54 49|LMP-EVA|Okay. Mag Karen is in.||CC|Copy that. That sounds like all of them to us.||LMP-EVA|Okay. And there are two on the cameras.||CC|Roger.|06 22 55 09|CDR-EVA|Bob, I'm reading 670, 010, 701; 670, 010, 701.||CC|Okay. Copy that. We're ready for a bias, Gene.||CDR-EVA|Okay.|06 22 55 36|CDR-EVA|Bias, and it is flashing.||CC|Roger. Mark that.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Let me take a look around.||CDR-EVA|Jack?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Was that bag in there?||LMP-EVA|Yes. It's over here on the MESA.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Yes. Oh. Let's get rid of these tool harnesses We don't need those anymore.||||||Tape 112A/17||CC|Yes. That's affirm.||CDR-EVA|You're - You've come loose on the - you've come loose on the right.||LMP-EVA|Yes. Take a picture for you.||CC|Let me know when they come off, guys. Don't, get them tangled up in the hoses. Stand still ... - -||CDR-EVA|Let me pull it off for you. ...||CC|- - stand still ... untangle it.||CDR-EVA|Yes. Okay. Turn this way.||LMP-EVA|Now get the other side.||LMP-EVA|Okay. That's off.||CDR-EVA|Came off, huh?||LMP-EVA|Yes .||CDR-EVA|You don't have to get it around those hoses and everything? See if you can do it.||CC|Works a lot better than the simulations, doesn't it?||CDR-EVA|They won't find the other one. Stand by.||LMP-EVA|Boy, are you dirty.||CDR-EVA|I know it.||LMP-EVA|Let's see. I don't know whether I can get to you.||CDR-EVA|Yes, you can.||LMP-EVA|Ed, you've got your camera in the way.||CDR-EVA|Oh, just take them straight on. That's all right.||||Tape 112A/18||||LMP-EVA|That's sort of - ... Okay. (Laughter) Such -such a pose. Let me get a little different -focus. That looks good.||CDR-EVA|Hey.||LMP-EVA|Try one more over here. Have your pick.||CDR-EVA|One - one more.||LMP-EVA|How's like this?||CDR-EVA|Okay. (Laughter) You got that camera. That's the color camera.||LMP-EVA|Yes .||CDR-EVA|You take it.||CC|Okay - -||LMP-EVA|I've got to go get a new neutron flux probe, I guess.||CC|That's right.||CDR-EVA|Oh, yes. That's going to be easy to pull out.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Let's see if I've got everything in here.||CC|Okay. And - -||LMP-EVA|You ready for me to go to the ALSEP?||CDR-EVA|Jack?||CC|Roger. We're ready for both of you guys, now.||LMP-EVA|Bob?||CC|Roger. Go ahead.||LMP-EVA|Hello, Houston.||||||Tape 112A/19||CC|Hello, 17. Stand by. I think we're having a sligiht handover or something.||LMP-EVA|Houston, do you read? Gene, do you read me?||CDR-EVA|Yes, I read you.||CC|Okay, 17. We had a - -||LMP-EVA|... Well, I don't know ...||CC|- - slight bit of trouble there, and we've got you again.||LMP-EVA|Are you ready for me to go to the ALSEP?||CC|Roger. We're ready for both of you guys, now.||LMP-EVA|What do you mean? I'm headed for the ALSEP.||CC|Gene, are you ready for Jack to go to the ALSEP, now?|06 23 01 33|CDR-EVA|Oh, let me see. Yes, he's gone. He's doing it. I'm ready to get out, and go to the VIP site. Wait a minute, Jack. Wait a minute, here. Wait a minute. Where are you?||CC|Yes. We're trying to - -||LMP-EVA|Right over here.||CDR-EVA|Come on back here a minute.||CC|- - we're trying to be subtle there, guys.||CDR-EVA|Come on back here a minute. Come on back here a minute. I didn't realize you were going out there quite so soon.||LMP-EVA|Well, I just looked to see where it is.||LMP-EVA|There. I'll - -||CDR-EVA|What did you - what did you do with that -||||Tape 112A/20||||LMP-EVA|How about one of - how about this one?|06 23 02 11|CDR-EVA|You got it?||CDR-EVA|What was it happened to that one in my footpan?||LMP-EVA|I put in the (laughter) big bag.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Here we go, Jack. I - Here's one here. Here. All right?||LMP-EVA|Yes. Let me - let me get it, so you won't get it too dirty.||CDR-EVA|Okay. (Laughter) Very good.||LMP-EVA|You hold it.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Got it?||LMP-EVA|Yes. How about over here?||CDR-EVA|I'll put it right over here aginst that back -background.|06 23 03 11|CDR-EVA|Houston, before we close out our EVA, we understand that there are young people in Houston today, who have been effectively touring our country, young people from countries all over the world, respectively, touring our country. They had the opportunity to watch the launch of Apollo 17, hopefully had an opportunity to meet some of our young people in our country. And we'd like to say first of all, welcome, and we hope you enjoyed your stay. Second of all, I think probably one of the most significant things we can think about when we think about Apollo is that it has opened for us - for us being the world - a challenge of the future. The door is now cracked, but the promise of the future lies in the young people, not just in America, but the young people all over the world learning to live and learning to work together. In order to remind all the people of the world in so many countries throughout the world that this is what we all are striving for in the future, Jack has picked up a very significant rock, typical of what we have here in the valley of Taurus-Littrow. It's a rock composed of many fragments, of many sizes,||||||Tape 112A/21|||and many shapes, probably from all parts of the Moon, perhaps billions of years old. But a rock of all fra - sizes and shapes, fragments of all sizes and shapes, and even colors that have grown together to become a cohesive rock, outlasting the nature of space, sort of living together in a very coherent, very peaceful manner. When we return this rock or some of the others like it to Houston, we'd like to share a piece of this rock with so many of the countries throughout the world. We hope that this will be a symbol of what our feelings are, what the feelings of the Apollo Program are, and a symbol of mankind that we can live in peace and harmony in the future.|06 23 05 50|LMP-EVA|A portion of a - of a rock will be sent to a - a representative agency or museum in each of the countries represented by the young people in Houston today, and we hope that they will, that rock and the students themselves, will carry with them our good wishes, not only for the new year coining up but also for themselves , their countries , and all mankind in the future. Put that in the big bag, Geno.||CDR-EVA|In the big bag.||CC|Roger - -||CDR-EVA|We salute you, promise of the future.||CC|- - Jack and Gene. We thank you for your sentiments and your interest.||CDR-EVA|And now, let me bring this camera around. To commemorate not just Apollo 17's visit to the Valley of Taurus-Littrow but as an everlasting commemoration of what the real meaning of Apollo is to the world, we'd like to uncover a plaque that has been on the leg of our spacecraft that we have climbed down many times over the last 3 days. And I'll read what that plaque says to you. First of all, It has a picture of the world. Two pictures, one of the North America and one of South America. The other covers the other half of the world including Africa, Asia, Europe, Australia, covers||||Tape 112A/22|||||"the North Pole and the South Pole. In between these two hemispheres, we have a pictorial view of the Moon, a pictorial view of where all the Apollo landings have been made so that when this plaque is seen again by others who come, they will know where it all started. The words are, ""Here man completed his first exploration of the Moon, December 1972 A.D. May the spirit of peace in which we came be reflected in the lives of all mankind."" It's signed, ""Eugene A. ^ernan, Ronald E. Evans, Harrison H. Schmitt, and most prominently, Richard M. Nixon, President of the United States of America."" This is our commemoration that will be here until someone like us, until some of you who are out there, who are the promise of the future, come back to read it again and to further the exploration and the meaning of Apollo."||CC|Roger, Gene. We in Houston copy that and echo your sentiments, and Dr. Fletcher i;3 here beside me. He'd like to say a word to the two of you.||MCC|Gene and Jack, I've been in close touch with the White House, and the President has been following very closely your absolutely fascinating work up there. He'd like to wish you Godspeed as you return to Earth, and I'd like to personally second that. Congratulations. We'll see you in a few days. Over.||CDR-EVA|"Thank you, Dr. Fletcher. We appreciate your comments, and we certainly appreciate ""hose of the President. And whether it be civilian or military, I think Jack and I would both like to give our salute to America."|06 23 10 00|LMP-EVA|And, Dr. Fletcher, if I may, I'd like to remind everybody, I'm sure, of something they're aware, but this valley, this valley of history, has seen mankind complete its first evolutionary steps into the universe, leaving the planet Earth and going forward into the universe. I think no more significant contribution has Apollo made to history. It's not often that you can foretell history, but I think we can in this case. And I think everybody ought to feel very proud of that fact. Thank you very much.||||||Tape 112A/23||MCC|I'll see you in a little bit.||CDR-EVA|Okay, babe. Let's go to the AL - Okay, Bob. I owe you a - a bias reading.||CC|Okay. Or you can get it later. There's no hurry on that. And we're off to the ALSEP.||CDR-EVA|I'm going to give it to you right now.||CC|Okay. Ready to copy. I presume you've a UHT out at the ALSEP, Jack.||LMP-EVA|That's affirm.|06 23 11 11|CDR-EVA|337, 417, 101; 337, 417, 101.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Are you through with this?||CC|Roger. (Laughter)||CDR-EVA|Bob?||CC|Roger. We're through with it.||LMP-EVA|Be kind. Be kind.||CDR-EVA|Well, I love it, and I'm sure it did a good job - -||CC|Well, we're not through with you, Gene, so don't throw yourself too far.||CDR-EVA|No, sir. I just don't want to hit old Challenger there.||LMP-EVA|That was unkind. You did the javelin. That was unkind.||CC|Roger, Gene. And we - -||CDR-EVA|I didn't throw it as far as I could have. I just--||||Tape 112A/24||||CC|- - we timed the parabola for that, and we have one excellent measurement of g on the Moon now.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I didn't get you a - I didn't get you a pendulum, but I don't know where I would, Bob. Okay. I'm going to have to take you out to the VIP site --||CC|Okay. We're ready for that, and we'll - -||CDR-EVA|- - if you concur?||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Well, let me make sure I got everything. Okay. Remember, we -|06 23 13 11|CDR-EVA|Okay. Bob, I guess you're reading me through the LM, huh?||CC|Roger. Read you through the LM. You guys both read me through the LM?||CDR-EVA|That's affirm. Okay. The first thing I want to do - Tell John I'm going to do it exactly like he wants. Okay. The camera is under the seat, I hope. Let me look. Yes, camera's there. Jack, did you do something with the dustbrush?||LMP-EVA|No.||CDR-EVA|It was under the seat, right?||LMP-EVA|It was , yes.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I want to make sure it is because I'll need it out there.||LMP-EVA|No, wait a minute. I don't know that it's there now.||CDR-EVA|Well, I want to make sure that I can get - get something to dust with.||||||Tape 112A/25||CC|Okay. And, Jack, as you go out to the ALSEP, let me cue in on your next 3 hours worth of work out there, repairing the ALSEP. All right? Over.||LMP-EVA|Oh, okay. Go ahead. I'm here.|06 23 l4 19|CC|"Okay. Number one, we want to retrieve the UHT. And I quote, ""tap sharply"" - that's ""sharply"" on the gimbal, which is the center section there, the little square metal piece in the middle - tap sharply on the gimbal with the UHT, and then re-verify the level on the LSG. We'll check response here in Mission Control after you've done that."||LMP-EVA|You mean tap on the thing that swings?||CC|That's what they say.||CDR-EVA|You always wanted to do that, didn't you?||CC|Yes, that's right.||LMP-EVA|Well, let me see if I can grab a clean UHT to do that.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. Everything is zeroed.||CC|Okay. And I'll be talking to Jack here, Gene, for a while. You can interrupt with your comments over - talking over me, and I'll try and copy them.|06 23 15 22|CDR-EVA|One comment. I got a flag on the other battery, 139 degrees.||CC|Okay. We copy that.||LMP-EVA|Kow much - how much is sharply?||CC|Sharply is sharply. It's probably not heavily, but sharply. Fairly light, but sharply.||LMP-EVA|On the edge?||CC|No. You can see that little square metal piece in the middle there?||||Tape 112A/26||||LMP-EVA|On the edge?||CC|You see that little square metal piece on there? You can just sort of rap on that - -||LMP-EVA|Oh, yes. Okay. Here goes. I did it.||CC|Okay. And then it says - -||LMP-EVA|You want me to do it again?||CC|Stand by.||LMP-EVA|That was sort of a med - moderate hard tap.||CC|Go ahead, and hit it harder.||LMP-EVA|It is level.||CC|Hit it harder, please.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Okay? I can hit it harder yet.||CC|Okay. We've observed something there. Stand by.||CDR-EVA|Bob, you migjit be getting TV the way the antenna's oriented right now.||CC|Okay. Jack, go ahead. We'll do some more stuff here. In the meanwhile, while they're thinking about what's wrong with it, did you just tap it again?||LMP-EVA|No, I didn't touch it. I'm over at the central station now.||CC|Okay. They're looking at it. All right. Now, we want to take some photographs at the central station and a few selected - a few selected photographs of the ALSEP. Number one, we want a 7-foot cross-Sun to the south of the ALSEP central station and then a 7-foot down-Sun of the central station. Over.||LMP-EVA|A 7-foot cross-Sun to the south.||||||Tape 112A/27||CC|That's what it says.||LMP-EVA|And then a down-Sun.||CC|Roger. A 7-foot down-Sun.||LMP-EVA|You might tell me what they're trying to get with it. I might be able to help them.||CC|Okay. I presume that what this means is looking to the south. It was cross-Sun originally. I suspect that's what happened here, the way it was written up. So it's a 7-foot looking at the - all the switches to make sure you guys turned them the right way, I suppose. And then a 7-foot looking down-Sun, so that would be facing west, that side of it.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I got it. What else?|06 23 18 08|CC|Okay. Now, there's a problem with the central station - which they think the south end is buried more deeply in the dirt than they had intended. And the central station is at the present time getting very warm on the back side on the south side there, which is - they believe you probably buried in the ground when you were trying to tilt it to the proper alignment. They are requesting that, when you're at the ALSEP, you remove any soil buildup or debris with a convenient tool. They don't want you to touch it because it's fairly warm. But if you have a UHT or something to move it - Do you have a UHT with you or something with you that you can brush that soil aside with?||LMP-EVA|Yes, sir.||CC|Okay. You know the ... - -||LMP-EVA|It Is piled up there. That's ... - -||CC|Yes. Okay. They'd like that brushed away. And you can give me a call - -||LMP-EVA|Fortunately, I brought my handy-dandy Rover sampler out.||||Tape 112A/28||||CC|Okay. You can brush that aside, and give me a call when you think that's cleared up the way it ought to be. That's probably one of those things we didn't think about when we decided to tilt the central station.||LMP-EVA|Well, you didn't - you couldn't anticipate the soil, Bob. It's very soft.|06 23 19 30|CDR-EVA|Bob, we are at VIP.||CC|Okay. And Ed Fendell is hard on my back to remind you that it's better to be too far Eiway than too close.||CDR-EVA|All right.||LMP-EVA|I thought I was, but I think I may move just a little bit. There's a little rise here I can give you. I think I'll give it to you.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|By the way, Bob, the soil gets more cohesive with depth. I hadn't really noticed that before.||CC|Okay. We copy that. What do you nctice?||LMP-EVA|It's - it's quite a bit more cohesive at - about the - feels about the same down to 3 centimeters out here, and then the cohesiveness goes up, so it's difficult to scrape with the Rcver sampler.||CC|Copy that, Jack.||CDR-EVA|Well, I think you can see almost everything from here.||CC|Okay, Geno. And, Jack, let me know when you get done scraping that soil away.||LMP-EVA|I will.||LMP-EVA|And now comes the hardest alignment of them all, but I'll get it.||||||Tape 112A/29||LMP-EVA|Somewhere about there. See if I can't tweak it up for you. Bob, the east-west level bubble is not quite level. The north-south is. Do you want me to tweak that up?||CC|Yes, you might tweak that up. We are getting a good signal, but go ahead and tweak it up just a little bit.||CC|And, Gene, what are you doing these days?||CDR-EVA|I'm getting the high gain set up for you.||CC|Okay. Now you know why we didn't make you park it in that orientation all the time, don't you?||CDR-EVA|Boy, I'll tell you ... it was a piece of cake up until now.||CDR-EVA|There, I got you.||CDR-EVA|Bob, you got - Bob, you're looking right down the center of my eyepiece. You - -||CC|Okay, I don't think - -||CDR-EVA|- - you should have TV.||CC|Yes, we're getting TV there, Geno.||CDR-EVA|You getting it?||CC|We've got TV.||CDR-EVA|Well, let me take a look, and clean things up.||CC|Okay. I guess you can dust and dust and dust some more for a while.||CDR-EVA|let me get this dusting problem out of the way before I do anything else.||CC|Reger.||||Tape 112A/30||||CDR-EVA|You can look at your vantage point, and if you don't like it, let me know.||CC|Okay. I'll call Captain Video.||LMP-EVA|Bob?||CC|Go.||LMP-EVA|How close can soil be to this back plate of the ALSEP?||CC|Stand by. I'll check.|06 23 23 56|LMP-EVA|It's about 30 centimeters away, most of the places now.||CC|Okay. That sounds good. We'd like you to return to the surface gravimeter, Jack. What you did had some effect, but not - not a lasting effect. And we'd like you to rap even more sharply, more strongly on the gimbal another three times. And we're again watching it, and we'll let you know what to do. And - I might tell you that this has all been done recently this afternoon up at Bendix on the qual unit, and it survived it and so we aren't in any real danger apparently of destroying it.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Three times, huh?||CC|Roger. Or up to three times.||LMP-EVA|Bob, don't let me forget to bring a dustbrush back when I come. . .. - -||CC|Okay. I'll mark that down and remind you. And, Jack, you'll be glad to know that the temperature of the back plate there has already dropped 20 degrees - 20 degrees.||LMP-EVA|Oh, beautiful.|06 23 25 58|CDR-EVA|Bob, I don't think that bubble is working.||||||Tape 112A/31||CC|Oh.||CDR-EVA|How's your signal now?||CC|Stand by. I'll check. But why don't you go to the - to the surface gravimeter?||LMP-EVA|Bob, how's your TV lens? I don't have a lens brush. It looks good from here. I don't want to use this unless you think so.||CC|Stand by.||LMP-EVA|Knock three times. (Singing)||CC|Roger. Get out of the way please, Jack, and we'_'l take a look against some bright soil.||CDR-EVA|What?||LMP-EVA|No, that's me he's talking to.||CC|Okay. It looks pretty good, Geno. Go ahead.||CDR-EVA|I ... with the lens brush.||CC|Yes, go ahead. It looks pretty good to us.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob. Here come the raps. Knock three times. Okay.||CC|Okay, Jack. That's really fighting it pretty hard. We'd like you to put the UHT in the socket, and rock it very firmly. Don't pick it up, but rock it very firmly from side to side in all four directions - Move the UHT about 6 inches in each direction while you're doing it.|06 23 27 39|LMP-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Okay, I rocked it. It's swinging.||CC|Okay. Is it reading?||||Tape 112A/32||||LMP-EVA|And the level bubble is - better.||CC|Okay. We understand it's in good configuration again as far as alignment and leveling is concerned, Jack. Let's go on and take some more ALSEP photos , and let them think about it for a minute.||LMP-EVA|Okay. What do you want?||CC|Okay. Next, what we want is some heat flow -Okay. We just got late word. They'd like to do it one more time, and then call it g^uits.||LMP-EVA|The rocking bit, huh?||CC|Roger. The walk - rocking bit one more time.||CDR-EVA|Bob, I may have moved the high gain. Do you see any change in signal?||CC|Stand by.||CDR-EVA|If you're happy, I won't touch it.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob. It's rocked. The shadow ... - the shade is aligned to the Sun now, and it's level.|06 23 29 49|CC|Okay. We copy that, and let's go get some ALSEP photos, Jack. I think you got some heat flow photos the other night, besides the two pans. If you did, we may - these may be redundant. They're - they want the cross-Sun and down-Sun of the east hole and cross-Sun and down-Sun of the west hole. And I'm not sure but vhat you got those earlier. You said you got some extra heat flow, but tell me if you did. They're both -all four of these are 7-foot - -||LMP-EVA|T _L —||CC|Go ahead.||LMP-EVA|I'll get the heat flow pictures. They - One was 11-foot, I think. And then the steropair.||||||Tape 112A/33||CC|Yes. I think all they're asking for is the two 7-foot stereopairs.|06 23 30 51|LMP-EVA|Okay. That's one of them.||CC|Okay. What they're asking for, Jack, is a 7-foot down-Sun and a 7-foot cross-Sun, which isn't quite what we've been taking in the past.||LMP-EVA|I'm getting the standard ones, Bob.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Okay. You got the standard documentation.||CC|Okay - -||LMP-EVA|11-footers and 7-foot stereos.||CC|Okay. Go ahead. They can't complain about that, certainly.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Now what?||CC|Okay. We'd like a 3-foot shot of the lunar mass spectrometer, including the orifice where the breccia was. And, Geno, we are observing some degradation and would like to have the high gain - -||LMP-EVA|Cross-Sun?||CC|Yes, yes, Jack; 3-foot cross-Sun. And, Gene; this is Houston. We'd like to get the high gain reoriented a little bit. We're observing some degradation in the picture.||CDR-EVA|I'll tweak it.|06 23 32 15|LMP-EVA|Okay. Got It. Now what? LMS is complete.||CC|Okay. Copy that. Now we want to go over the neutron flux, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|How's the gravimeter doing?||||Tape 112A/34||||CC|We're looking at it, Jack. I'm not sure.||CDR-EVA|Hey, Bob. The panel you want covered. Yes, that's the panel. Okay. You want the - the panel with the - with the ON-OFF switch and the - and the signal strength switch and so forth covered, don't you?||CC|Roger. And be sure to get the thing to EXTERNAL before you cover it there, Gene.||CDR-EVA|Okay. That was going to be a question of mine.||CC|Okay. That goes to EXTERNAL.|06 23 33 58|CDR-EVA|Okay. It's EXTERNAL.||LMP-EVA|What - what do you want me to do with the neutron flux?||CC|Okay. We want a photograph facing south, for the 7-foot. So a 7-foot cross-Sun, essentially, of the neutron flux In the soil.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Would you like to have the RIG in that picture?||CC|Oh, I suppose if you're generous, you might take a partial pan around to the RTG.||LMP-EVA|Well, it's just about that direction. Okay. Now what?||CC|Okay. Now let's remove - remove the neutron pro - probe experiment from the ground, and turn it off.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|No more on the gravimeter, huh?||CC|No, the gravimeter is looking very bad, still. And, Jack, you might note as you withdraw Just how difficult it is to withdraw it. It - it -whether or not it's been seiz-ed by the soil collapsing around it or not. That's soil mechanic's goody.||||||Tape 112A/35||LMP-EVA|Not at all, not at all.||CDR-EVA|It won't be, I'll tell you. No problem.||CC|Okay. We copy that.||CDR-EVA|Okay. The high gain is - the high gain is tweaked||CC|Okay. We'll consider ourselves tweaked.||CDR-EVA|And I'm giving the LCRU another zap here. Boy, I tell you, I ain't going to do much more dusting after I leave here. Ever.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Upper probe is OFF -|06 23 36 06|LMP-EVA|MARK it.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob. I'm going to put bus B and D, OPEN, and AUX circuit breaker BYPASS, ON.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|And let me see. Bravo. Okay. And Delta. Okay. Bravo and Delta. Upper probe is OFF -|06 23 36 43|LMP|MARK it.||CC|Is that upper or lower, Jack?||LMP-EVA|Up - oh, lower. I'm sorry, Bob.||CC|Copy that.|06 23 36 52|LMP-EVA|AUX POWER circuit breaker is ON. BYPASS, ON. And the lower probe is capped.||CC|Okay; and, Gene, you need to close that CAUTION AND WARNING FLAG. It's heat sink when it's open, I guess.||CDR-EVA|Okay; it's closed.||||Tape 112A/36||||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|You want me to put a bag in front of that thing?||CC|No, I don't think - -||CDR-EVA|Want me to put a bag in front of it in case it pops open again? I guess it won't.||CC|No, I don't think so. I can't imagine why it's really a problem anyway, because we got the BYPASS, ON there, and that heat's not going anywhere.||LMP-EVA|Okay; now the switch is off, except my 15 volts. Bob, you want me away from the ALSEP now?||CC|Stand by, Jack. I'll get one more word before we come back to the LM.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I got a camera, over there. I'm going to look under the seats one more time. Nothing but a 500 - Okay. Used tape.||CC|Okay. Jack, we're ready to leave the ALSEP.||LMP-EVA|Well, I hate to do that, Bob. I'm sorry about this gravimeter, though.||CC|Well, you're not the only one. The word is down here there's a whole room full of people who are sorry.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I got the LMP's camera. Nothing in here but couple of old bags. We used about all the bags we had, Jack. Not many here. Bob, I have the dust brush tethered.||CC|Copy the dust brush.|06 23 39 57|CDR-EVA|Okay; let me get one parting shot of - one of the finest running little machines I've ever had the pleasure to drive.||||||Tape 112A/37||CC|Okay. And, Geno, some people down here are concerned about whether you've opened the battery covers or not.||CDR-EVA|Yes, sir; they're open.||CC|Roger. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Oh, what a nice little machine. Parked on a little downslope, but at the heading you want, and I guess Ed's satisfied with the TV response, huh?||CC|Roger. We're satisfied with the TV, Gene. We're ready for you to take the EP number 3•||CDR-EVA|Good old Mother Earth is right smack in the center.||CDR-EVA|Bob, while we've got a quite moment here, as I go to de - deploy that EP charge, I'd just like to say that any part of Apollo 17, or any part of Apollo, that has been a success thus far is probably, for the most part, due to the thousands of people in the aerospace industry who have given a great deal, besides dedication and besides effort and besides professionalism, to make it all a reality. And I would just like to thank them, because what we've done here and what has been done in the past - As a matter of fact, what has been done for 200 years, you've got to contribute to the spirit of a group of people who form the aerospace industry. And I God bless you and thank you.||CC|Roger, Gene. And we thank you guys.||CDR-EVA|Well, we're just two little - two little sets of twinkletoes here. There's a lot that goes to getting this Rover running out here that we don't have much to do with. And I guess there might be someone else that has something to do with it too, and I've been reading his signs, maybe not from Him directly, but His in spirit, as we run up and down that ladder. And that's Godspeed, the crew of Apollo 17. And if He's listening, I'd like to thank Him, too. Pin 1 is pulled.||||Tape 112A/38|||06 23 44 29|CC|MARK that.||CDR-EVA|I meant the end of the west SEP antenna. Do you agree with that?||CC|Roger. Exactly right.|06 23 44 4l|CDR-EVA|Okay. Pin 2 is pulled. Still safe. Pin 3 is pulled, and it still safe.||CC|Copy that, and - -||CDR-EVA|Don't know what I would do if it wasn't. (Laughter)||CC|- - and now, also, do you have the SEP transmitter turned off there, Gene?||CDR-EVA|No, sir. Thank you. Okay. Bob, - -||CC|Then we're ready for you guys to get back to the LM and dust it.||CDR-EVA|- - it's getting ready - it's getting right adjacent to the ring on the west end, and I'm going to go back and turn the SEP cff.||CC|Okay. And when that's done, Gene, we're ready for you and your dust brush to hasten back to the LM and dust each other and clirrb in.||CDR-EVA|You know what, Bob?||CC|What, Gene?||CDR-EVA|Great as an experience as it has been, I'd say we're probably both ready.||LMP-EVA|Oh, I don't know. Hey, Bob, 55 Yankee is an exotic-looking rock I found about 5 meters south cf the neutron flux hole. It's another gray -possibly gray basalt. It's just that there aren't many of them around here, and so I picked it up.||CC|Copy that.||||||Tape 112A/39||LMP-EVA|Cheating a little again.||CDR-EVA|Jack, you'll always be picking rocks.||LMP-EVA|Oh, I don't know.|06 23 46 10|CDR-EVA|Okay, the transmitter is OFF.||CC|MARK that.||CDR-EVA|I don't blame you. There's so many interesting things around here.||LMP-EVA|Just don't lose your brush, Gene.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, according to my inventory I'm going to return to the LM and the camera is going to ETB.||CC|That's affirm. We'll have - -||CDR-EVA|... we're done with the TGE.||CC|Roger.||CC|We need a bias reading if you want to use it again, Gene.||CDR-EVA|Jack, come to think of it, I - come to think of it, I guess you are, aren't you. Where are you, Jack?||LMP-EVA|I'm at the MESA.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Trying to snap a snap.||CDR-EVA|I need a locater here to the LM.||CC|Okay; and, 17, we need you guys In the LM in 15 minutes, 15 minutes because of oxygen constraints||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, my pictures are taken; I'm on the way. Oh, Boy, where else can you do this?||||Tape 112A/40||||CDR-EVA|If I had landed 30 meters back, Jack, we'd be pitched down 5 degrees.||LMP-EVA|You're right.||CDR-EVA|Okay, what they're saying is, I don't need my hammer any more.||CC|Roger.||CDR-EVA|... dust and get in.||CC|We want you to dust and get in. We got l4 minutes remaining before we need the hatch closed.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. We'll - we're doing our best. Well, that RTV worked on the hammer, but look at it, Jack. It's worn completely to a nub. It's off.||LMP-EVA|I guess that's all right - Look at - Here - my -I don't know where I am. Oh, boy, how about that? Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay, sir, you ready to go on up?||LMP-EVA|Well, I don't know. Cot to take my camera off. I got another batch of pictures - the LM and the flag and - -|06 23 49 57|CDR-EVA|Well, watch this real quick.||LMP-EVA|Stereo, even.||CDR-EVA|Jack - -||LMP-EVA|Let me have your camera. Go ahead. Oh, there ... there. Let me throw the hammer.||CDR-EVA|Okay •||LMP-EVA|Let me throw the hammer, please.||CDR-EVA|It' s all yours.||LMP-EVA|You got the gravimeter —||||||Tape 112A/41||CDR-EVA|you deserve it. A hammer thrower - you're a geologist. You ought to be able to throw it.||LMP-EVA|You ready?||CDR-EVA|Go ahead.||LMP-EVA|You ready for this? Ready for this?||CDR-EVA|Yes. Don't hit the LM or the ALSEP.||LMP-EVA|Look at that! Look at that! Look at that! Beautiful.||CDR-EVA|Looked like it was going a million miles, but it really didn't.||LMP-EVA|Didn't it?||CDR-EVA|Okay, here, this is an ETB.||LMP-EVA|Let me - let me make sure that that's all cinched up||CDR-EVA|Okay. And then start on up. We got to get going here.||LMP-EVA|Yes. Unfortunately, their little plan didn't count for the fact that it's hard to pack the ETB with the film magazines in it.||CDR-EVA|And I'll try and get the big bag here cinched up.||LMP-EVA|That is a major task.||CDR-EVA|Yes, that's going to be - oh, is it heavy. Is it heavy. Something in that core tube you put in there?||LMP-EVA|Yes, sir. Don't tell anybody, though, because they'11 get mad at me.||CDR-EVA|Oh, man, is that heavy. Holy smoley. Oh!||||Tape 112A/U2||||LMP-EVA|... 252. That's about three-quarters of a core -hand pushed - half a meter inside the plus-Y footpad.||CC|Okay ?, copy that.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Jack, how's that ETB coming no you can get going?||LMP-EVA|Fine.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I've got to - -||LMP-EVA|I've got to put it on a strap, though.||CDR-EVA|I can get that. You can - This is all cinched up. I think it'll hold. Why don't you start on up? Then I'll start dusting you.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Very good.||LMP-EVA|Anything fall out?||CDR-EVA|No.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Oh - -||CDR-EVA|Let me dust you. Set that down, and I'll hand it all to you.||LMP-EVA|Okay, you'll have to hand stuff in - -||CC|Okay; and, 17, we - a reminder, we need you inside in 10 minutes.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. ...||LMP-EVA|I'll do a lot of jumping up here in a minute.||CDR-EVA|Your back is clean.||LMP-EVA|I'll get the legs as best I can.||||||Tape 112A/43||CDR-EVA|Okay. Why don't you get me here before you do that?||LMP-EVA|Okay. And while I'm doing that, will you take this - I'll get it.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Boy, you got dirty today. I think we're just going to have to live with it.||CDR-EVA|Get my top. I can kick a lot of that stuff off my legs. How do I look in back?||LMP-EVA|Terrible. Okay, turn.||LMP-EVA|Oh, man. You're going to have to - Your legs are really filthy. Not much I can do about it.|06 23 53 58|CDR-EVA|Okay, I'll get them off. Why don't you start back - -||LMP-EVA|Just kick them against each other . . . - -||CDR-EVA|Okay. Start on up.||LMP-EVA|You might shake the bags.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||CC|And don't forget your PLSS an -||LMP-EVA|No.||CDR-EVA|Do what?||LMP-EVA|PLSS antennas.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Although it doesn't make much difference anymore. That's to get them out of the way.||CDR-EVA|The big bag didn't stay closed very long.||LMP-EVA|I don't know how we can get that in.||||Tape 112A/44|||06 23 54 30|CDR-EVA|There, I'll stand - I can hand it ~o you.||LMP-EVA|It never had a very good closure on it - -||CDR-EVA|That velcro won't hold.||LMP-EVA|- - but it can be closed.||CDR-EVA|I had it over - over the top. The latch was closed, but -||LMP-EVA|Oh, it won't hold with all that weight in there. Okay, I got your antenna.||CDR-EVA|Okay, let me get a high - Got to close this. You don't want that in your way.||LMP-EVA|I can't close it.||CDR-EVA|Oh, okay.||LMP-EVA|You might try.||CDR-EVA|Get all your flaps? Okay, hold your head down.||CDR-EVA|Yow.||LMP-EVA|Won't go, huh?||CDR-EVA|No. Will that bother you getting in?||LMP-EVA|I can probably make it.||CDR-EVA|Okay, get on up.||LMP-EVA|Oops, try that again. Okay, why don't you hand me the neutron flux, and I'll put it - -||CDR-EVA|Okay, neutron flux.||LMP-EVA|-?- on the platform? Okay.||CDR-EVA|Why don't you start in, and I'll get some of these bags out of the way.||LMP-EVA|Well, I just - You don't want to hand them to me up here?||||||Tape 112A/45||CDR-EVA|Okay.||CC|And, Jack, for your thoughts, we've agreed that you can delete the tracking light. We'd like to get you guys in as soon as possible - 7 minutes now. And we'll delete the tracking light test.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob.||LMP-EVA|Okay, that's all I can handle up here. One more -one more and I can put it up here.||CDR-EVA|Watch the cover on this one. Got it?||LMP-EVA|Got it.||CDR-EVA|Stand it up because the cover won't hack it.||CDR-EVA|Okay. If you get on in, I'll come up to the porch.|06 23 57 48|LMP-EVA|Where's that EVA pallet that's always in my way?||CC|I think we aren't going to have one of those tomorrow, Jack, so we did away with that. We hope we're not going to have one of those tomorrow.||CDR-EVA|Bob, we're maximizing our efforts, so just bear with us. Jack's going to be in about 30 seconds, and I'm on the ladder hauling some stuff up now.||CC|Roger. Don't panic.|06 23 58 23|CDR-EVA|Well, we're not. I just don't want you to.||CC|I never panic there, guys.||LMP-EVA|Got some stuff for me?||CDR-EVA|Yes, sir. This is not the time to rush. It's the time to do it nice and slow and rigjht.||LMP-EVA|Oh, we're all right.||||Tape 112A/46||||CDR-EVA|Okay.

Okay, I'm out of the way now.|07 00 13 03|LMP-LM|How would you like to get off the PLSS water and get some spacecraft water, too?||CDR-LM|Oh, that's the next thing. Suit ilSOL and suit FLOW, ON; and then we'11 put PLSS pump and fan OFF. Then we'll disconnect the PLSS water and connect spacecraft water.||LMP-LM|You might unhook that stuff up there so you can get to your hoses.||CDR-LM|I can't reach it though.||LMP-LM|Oh, okay. I can get it I can get it.||CDR-LM|Okay, I guess.||LMP-LM|Okay, we want red to red and blue to blue. We got to verify these two because -||CDR-LM|Yes.

You're going to scratch it. Got it - Yes, got it.||LMP-LM|You don't have your visor on - neither do I.||CDR-LM|Okay, connect - Okay, PLSS mode, CH. Bob, we're both going off the air. We'll get on LM comm.||CC|Okay. We'll be waiting for you. We're here.||CDR-LM|"Okay, go ""0"", Jack."||LMP-LM|How about some cooling?||CDR-LM|"Okay, zap me with it, and go ""0"", and then put your audio breaker OPEN and connect the LM comm. Then ON audio breaker CLOSED. Okay?"||CDR-LM|You read me, Jack?||CDR-LM|You read me?||CDR-LM|Read me?||LMP-LM|You're loud and clear.||CDR-LM|Okay. Next thing, VHF B - wait a :ninute. You get the audio breaker OPEN, CLOSED - Okay - VHF squelch B LMP. Okay, noise threshold, plus 1-1/2.||LMP-LM|Yes.||CDR-LM|Okay. AUDIO, both panels. VHF A DECEIVE, and 3 OFF.||LMP-LM|A RECEIVE and B is OFF here.||CDR-LM|Okay, mode ICS/PTT.|07 00 21 09|LMP-LM|Okay, Houston. We're back on LM comm.||CC|Roger, 17. We copy you loud and clear on LM comm.||||||Tape 113A/11||CC|And 17- Jack and Gene, we have a couple of - in fact, we have three records here to read out to you guys. On Apollo 17, two of them; one, the longest single EVA, 7 hours 37 minutes and 22 seconds. The longest total lunar surface EVA time 22 hours 5 minutes and 6 seconds. And the summary, the total lunar surface EVA time for the Apollo Program, 80 hours 44 minutes and 8 seconds.||CDR-LM|That's quite a tribute to the people who made it possible. Thank you, Bob.||CC|Roger, Geno. And I can't speak as authoritatively as some people have tonight, but for all of us around me, I'll say thank you, also.||CDR-LM|Your words are well taken. You know how I feel.|07 00 22 56|CC|Hey, Gene and Ron, this is the CSM CAPCOM. Thought you might be interested. Your buddie up on - above you there is chugging on and about ready to bed down himself, right now. And he did take a good look at the landing site through binoculars tonight and took a good look at Shorty crater there, and noticed quite a lot of variations in color. That may be the same color changes you saw in that orange soil and that, but we're trying to match it all up. And Farouk and Ron are working it out. We're trying to match it all up and see if we can get a comparison there.||LMP-LM|Excellent. Tell him we'll see him tomorrow.||CC|Yes, he's counting on it.||CDR-LM|How's America looking to you, Bob?||CC|Well, I'll give an update. It - it's working perfect. Wo problems at all and we got good SIM bay data on everything. The UV, the IR, the lunar sounder, and everything that we - every data point we can see is just great. It's - it's just hardly any anomalies at all. Everything is j as t won der ful.||||Tape 113A/12||||CDR-LM|Outstanding.||CC|Gene, about this total limit of any problem there is, and it's not a problem, is we're just having to stir those tanks manually because of that limiting cycle on the pressure switch there. We could go back to auto but it's easier to go manual.||CDR-LM|I'll be back up there tomorrow and I'll stir them for you.||CC|Roger. And Jack and Gene, let me make a note here for you guys. There will be a series of references to this throughout the checklist but there's a general thing and you might even put a piece of tape across it if you want to or something - rather than go through an3 call out all the locations. We'll leave PRESS REG A closed for the rest of the time. Might just keep that in mind.||LMP-LM|Okay, Bob, we'll - I think we'll handle that one okay.|07 00 25 26|CC|Gene, there's one thing you may be interested in as - as the Commander. We're going to have to do two burns tomorrow on America. The - the orbit -the mascons didn't deteriorate the orbit as much as everybody thought it was so there's going to be an RCS burn about an hour prior to the - to the LOPC burn.||CDR-LM|That's interesting, Bob. Are you going to do a DOI 3, huh?||CC|Well, yes, I guess that's what it'll be - it's going to be an RCS burn at about 11 foot per second. It'll drop the - it'll cr.rculize the orbit and then we'll do the plane change burn.||CC|Okay, and 17, we'd like you to press on reasonably diligently tonight. You're just about on schedule but if we can turn off this Marine, we'd like you guys to press on. We're looking at a nominal||||||Tape 113A/13|||launch time and we've used up, of course, all the MCCH conference but we think you're within a few minutes of being right on. If you can press on like you did last night we'll be in great shape.||CDR-LM|Okay, Bob. I never stopped doing what I wanted to do anyway even though a Marine was talking.|07 00 29 09|LMP-LM|Okay, CDR's OPS 6100; LMP, 6500, Okay, Houston this is the LMP. LMP's OPS is regulating at 4.25.||CC|Okay, copy that.||LMP-LM|And the CDR's is 3.9 - 3.9.||CC|Okay that.||LMP-LM|That might be - I started - let me bring it off and let me see where it regulates at next time. I didn't have my hose locked, Bob, and it came off the first try. Bob, we'll take another OPS check later on when we stow them. We're pressing on.||CC|Jack, they're saying we better do that before you ... the PLSSs because we have to verify a good one before you - before you dump the PLSSs.||LMP-LM|Okay, we'll do that.|07 00 35 16|LMP-LM|Okay, Houston, we rechecked the LMP's OPS and it's regulating at 4.25, again.||CC|Is that a steady 4.25, Jack?||CMP-LM|Yes, it's done that twice now.||CC|Okay, and it's steady once you do it, Jack, right?||LMP-LM|Right, it's open now. We've been watching it for about a minute, now.||CC|Okay, we'll go with it then, Jack.||LMP-LM|Okay.||||Tape 113A/14|||07 00 37 42|LMP-LM|Okay, Bob, we're going to start the weighing process here - -||CC|Okay we're ready to copy - -||LMP-LM|- - It might take a couple minutes to get things squared away.||CC|Okay give us a call. We're ready to copy the weights.||LMP-LM|Okay.||LMP-LM|Bob, sample 15 Echo has a bunch of dust and that gradually accumulated in my pocket.||CC|No fair, Jack, you can't go collecting samples after the EVA's over.||LMP-LM|Say - say Bob, right now I can't find the sample containment bag number 5» Number 5 collection bag will be in bag 3.||CC|Okay, we note that. Thank you. Very good.|07 00 4l 49|LMP-LM|Okay, and we're going to cross out 3 on the bag, and put a 5 on it.||CC|Okay, I think we could keep track of it otherwise ; but that's fine.||LMP-LM|That's for our reference too.||CC|...|07 00 56 33|CDR-LM|Okay, Bob, you ready?||CC|Roger. We're ready.||CDR-LM|Okay, bag 7 is 32, bag 4 is 31.5, bag 5 is 21, the big bag is 71» the ISA is 22.||CC|Okay, we have those five weights there, Geno. We have 32 for number 7, 31.5 for number 4, 21 for number 5» 71 for the SR - the big bag, and 22 for the ISA.||||||Tape 113A/15||LMP-LM|That's affirm, and we're standing by for your GO for jettison.||CC|Okay 17. Challenger, we are ready for jettison.||CDR-LM|Roger. Understand.||CC|Okay and 17, we'd like - -||CDR-LM|How do you read, Bob?||CC|- - loud and clear, 17. And Challenger, we'd like to keep out the original BSLSS bag, the one that you launched with. We - we think we're going to need that to stow samples in.||CDR-LM|Okay, it's out.||CC|Okay. Or - or it's in, we hope.||CDR-LM|Okay.|07 00 59 30|CDR-LM|RECORDER, ON.||LMP-LM|Whichever way.||CC|We want it kept in the cabin, right.||CDR-LM|RECORDER'S, ON.||CDR-LM|Okay, don EV gloves. Let me - -||LMP-LM|Okay, the recorder's not giving us any recording though.||CDR-LM|See if I can't get a little ... out of some of these things. Don your gloves, Jack. You're -||LMP-LM|Why isn't the recording recording?||CDR-LM|Are we out of tape?||LMP-LM|Be 8 hours on it. I don't think I left it on. I might have left it on. I probably did if it's on now. I thought I read it in the checklist though. Don Arabian will never forgive me.||CC|Shall we save ourselves some ascent weight?||||Tape 113A/16||||SC-LM|(Laughter)||CC|Unfortunately, Owen wasn't listening.||LMP-LM|Well it was okay up until - it was; just this EVA if it was on, Bob.||CC|Okay.||LMP-LM|Because it was working when we prepped, I'm sure of that.||CDR-LM|Okay. Did you don your EV gloves? And we'll check each others connectors again.||LMP-LM|I'll take my cuff checklist off.||CDR-LM|Needless to say, you don't have to put your dust covers on, Jack. If that makes you feel better.||LMP-LM|Oh boy.|07 01 01 51|CDR-LM|Bob, how long were we out today, 7 what?||CC|Stand by, we got it here someplace; 7 hours and - 7 hours 15 minutes and 31 seconds.||CDR-LM|How many kilometers did we put on the Rover?||CC|We have an approximate total of atout 36.1.||LMP-LM|Boy this one is really getting stiff.||CDR-LM|Probably another 1/2 kilometer on that when the nav wasn't working.||CC|I don't - yes, we didn't - we didn't get distance readouts all the time. We sort of interpolated those distances there, Gene.||LMP-LM|Push on the button.||CDR-LM|Are you opening or closing?||LMP-LM|Closing, trying to.||CDR-LM|You don't have to push on the button to close it.||||||Tape 113A/17||LMP-LM|Well yes - -||CDR-LM|It's not locked.||LMP-LM|Now I know why I brought you.||CDR-LM|Jack, did you put those gloves on?||LMP-LM|I don't know. I was listening to you for one thing. Boy, it is stiff though. Never get it off. ... off.||SC-LM|I ...||CDR-LM|I ... this thing down there so it - -||LMP-LM|Wait a minute.

CLOSED.||CDR-LM|Okay, PRESSURE REG A - let's leave A OFF, and PRESSURE REG B to DIRECT 0 - ... 4.0, and then go to EGRESS, and we'll check on decay.||LMP-LM|Okay, go on to - -||CDR-LM|Wait a minute ... I should have ...||LMP-LM|Yes. Okay, its unlocked.||CDR-LM|Okay.||LMP-LM|For 3 you're ready for O2.||LMP-LM|How high do they want the suit?||CDR-LM|3.7 to 4.0 cuff gage.||LMP-LM|Okay, it's warming up, slowly.||CDR-LM|Yes, it could be some warmer.||LMP-LM|Off the peg. Down off the peg.||LMP-LM|There, you come up on 3.5>||CDR-LM|Okay, when you hit 3.7, I'll be with you. So you can -||LMP-LM|Okay 3.7* Okay.|07 01 07 36|LMP-LM|MARK it.

Get it.||LMP-LM|Yes.||CDR-LM|Okay, we've got another 15 seconds to go.|07 01 08 46|CDR-LM|Okay, MARK it. In one minute you go to SUIT CIRCUIT RELIEF, AUTO.||LMP-LM|Okay, suit - watch your ears.||CDR-LM|Okay.||LMP-LM|There.||CC|And 17, we're watching you, and you look good to us. You're GO.||LMP-LM|Okay, I had about 2/10.||CDR-LM|And I had 2/10. 3-7 to 3.5. Hey let's make sure we got everything. You went to 4.0, then you went to EGRESS then we monitor SUIT CIRCUIT RELIEF, AUTO; pressure is decaying at 4.8. Okay, that's good. Okay. We're GO for cabin repress.||CC|Roger. Roger, you're GO for -|07 01 09 27|CDR-LM|Okay, 16 ECS CABIN REPRESS, OPEN.|07 01 09 33|LMP-LM|Okay, REPRESS coming OPEN. CIRCUIT BREAKER, OPEN.||CDR-LM|Okay. ... I think I'll get this down here.||LMP-LM|They want this left in auto?||CDR-LM|Huh?||||Tape 113A/20||||LMP-LM|Leave this in auto?||CDR-LM|... just all you want is - -||LMP-LM|- - circuit breaker.||CDR-LM|-- 16 CABIN REPRESS, OPEN.||LMP-LM|Okay.

Okay, it's about 4.6 and decaying. How's it look to you, Houston?||CC|Looks good to us, 17.||CDR-LM|Okay, Jack. Overhead - make it forward dump, OPEN. And I'll verify we lock up ...||LMP-LM|Is decaying, the auto's working.|07 01 11 22|CDR-LM|Locking up, and the cabin's at 1.||CDR-LM|Okay, hatch opening. Downward.||CDR-LM|When I get the hatch partially opened, you can go to AUTO on that valve.||||||Tape 113A/21||LMP-LM|Still no good words about the gravimeter, huh, Bob?||CC|No, there's an out - outside chance that it's been a little cold. And they're hoping that if it warms up, that it may take care of itself but, no, everybody's very sad about that.||LMP-LM|Well, I could have sprinkled dirt on it, maybe.||CDR-LM|Let me ... to the hatch, Jack. Still about 4.2.||LMP-LM|Okay, you want that in auto?||CDR-LM|I can get it from here.||LMP-LM|Okay. And I'll lock while it's on.||CDR-LM|Turn around over here, boy I wish you could take some of that dust out. Get it.||LMP-LM|Better turn - wait ...|07 01 13 19|CDR-LM|The hatch is open, Houston.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-LM|Okay. Okay.||CDR-LM|But, Danny's [?] not out there, to hand us down the light weight PLSS's.||LMP-LM|Okay. Here goes the old - whose PLSS is this now?||CDR-LM|Well, look at it, if you want a memory.||LMP-LM|That must be yours it's red. No, that's mine, no it's yours. Here goes the old Commander's PLSS.||CDR-LM|Okay, baby thanks for doing a good job. And that was a backup PLSS too.||LMP-LM|Well, that wasn't very good.||CDR-LM|It walked down the ladder.||||Tape 113A/22||||LMP-LM|It went down as gracefully as you did.||CDR-LM|Look at that. Okay, what's next?||LMP-LM|Well, I can give you some of these. Here hold -okay. Everything that's in here. Okay. That's the first thing.||LMP-LM|Okay. Okay.||CDR-LM|Let me.||sc-m|||LMP-LM|Beautiful gloves.||CDR-LM|Yes. Houston, I think we ought to probably just mention, anyway. We are jettisoning a set of -2 sets of EVA gloves. I think that's worth mentioning. Because they did their job.||LMP-LM|Just like everything else did its job. I jettisoned mine.||CDR-LM|Okay.||LMP-LM|Whoops, we didn't get them cleared.|07 01 15 17|CC|Okay, we copy 2 sets of EVA gloves to the surface for the last time.||CDR-LM|They're very reluctant.

Let me try the other one.||CDR-LM|Oh, let me get it for you. I can free here - Yes, but I'm (Laughter).||LMP-LM|There. The right one went easy - I think they're all really getting -||CDR-LM|Oh, and the helmet is off and I'm throwing it in the BRA.||LMP-LM|Well, there's no changing our minds now, the PLSSs are going to be hard to retrieve.

I'm sitting here looking at a couple of questions that they wanted to ask. And whenever it's convenient for you - I'm not sure||||Tape 114A/2|||||just how busy you are right now - and just keep in mind I've got a few questions to ask you on the traverses, and give me a call when you're ready to talk about it.||LMP-LM|Okay; we're suit - unsuiting, Ken.

Just whenever it's convenient for you.|07 02 06 57|MCC|Challenger, Houston. ?||LMP-LM|Go ahead.||MCC|Hey, how about if we hit a PRO on the DSKY and get it into POO and back into STANDBY? We're worrying about the clock registers overflowing. And we'd like to get that done before 172:50, or somewhere in that neighborhood.||LMP-LM|Okay; stand by.||LMP-LM|Is that what you wanted?||MCC|Oh, we can't watch it, Jack. If you just tell|||us that you've got it into POO and back into POo.||LMP-LM|That's what happened.||LMP-LM|I thought you watched it the other night.||MCC|No, we don't have any high bit rate now.||LMP-LM|That do make a difference. That's right.||MCC|I understand that - that you've completed that transition. Is that correct?||LMP-LM|Which one?||MCC|You did get it out of STANDBY into POO, unu Lh<.*n back. Is that correct?||LMP-LM|That's affirm. We completed that.||MCC|Okay. Thank you.||||||Tape 114A/3||LMP-LM|Sorry to be so unclear.||MCC|"Hey, we - we also are still on your stowage. So when you get on page 7-6, where it says, ""Stow Heaviest Collection Bag,"" down in the right-hand column towards the bottom, why don't you skip that step until after the eat period. And we're still working on the stowage locations."||LMP-LM|Okay.|07 02 22 33|CDR-LM|Hello, Ken. How do you read Challenger CDR?||MCC|Loud and clear.||CDR-LM|Okay.|07 02 39 13|CDR-LM|Houston, Challenger. How would you feel about this canister being changed now?||CC|Stand by. Okay; change her out, Geno.||CDR-LM|Okay.||CC|For your information, we're trying to negotiate some time for you here. We're about one and a half down. We know how to pick up 1 hour of it, but we haven't quite figured out how to gain the other half.||CDR-LM|Okeydoke. Well, we're - we're all unsuited now, and we're about ready to talk and eat at the same time, or listen and eat here at the same time. And it won't be long and we'll be ready to hit the sack.||CC|Okay; fine. Ken's trying to negotiate the question sessions for you here.|07 02 43 52|CDR-LM|Canister's changed out, now.||CC|Thank you.|07 02 46 04|CDR-LM|Okay, Ken, we're on and ready for that debriefing. And you should be getting Jack's biomed also.||||Tape 114A/4||||MCC|Okay. Okay.

This is rev 44. Lift-off: 174 plus 13 plus 49- TPI: 177 plus 01 plus 00. Okay; I'll give you just the lift-off times. Excuse me. For rev 45: 176 plus 12 plus 19; 178 plus 10 plus 49; 180 plus 09 plus 20; 182 plus 07 plus 50; 184 plus 06 plus 20. Rev 50 is 186:04:50. Over.||LMP-LM|Okay, Ken. Starting with 44: 174:13:49; 176:12:19; 178:10:49; 180:09:20; 182:07:50; 184:06:02 [sic]; 186:04:50. And what's the present rev, please?||MCC|Okay; we're coming up on 40 - in fact, it looks like we're in 44 right now. Okay. And, Jack, how about let's confirm that the rev 49 was 184:06:20.||LMP-LM|Oh, I did have that wrong, in the seconds -two zero seconds.||MCC|That's affirmative. Okay; and we've got your biomed coming through.||LMP-LM|Well, one - one - Am I alive?||MCC|Just barely.||LMP-LM|Ken, I'd like to believe that you read that one wrong, because I've gone througn 50 copies on that without a mistake.||CC|Well, I'll - I'll settle that with you when you get back.||LMP-LM|50 rev.||CC|All right, sir. And - -||||||Tape 114A/5||LMP-LM|Okay.||MCC|- - looks like it's about time for an eat period, and I've got these questions for you. But let's keep in mind that that's secondary, and if it ever gets in the way of eating, why holler up, and we'll just drop it right there. We're about an hour and a half behind the time line, and we're going to make up no more than an hour of that.||CDR-LM|Okay.||LMP-LM|Well, I think --||CDR-LM|Okay, Ken. We're cutting into the chow and go ahead.||MCC|Okay. Would you like for me to just read you all the questions, and let you mull those over before you work on it, or you want to do one at a time?||LMP-LM|One at a time's better, Ken.||MCC|All right, sir. Number 1. Wanted to know if the blue-gray rocks at station 6 are similar to those at station 2?||LMP-LM|Ken, I think they are. But I think you'll find that the ones in station 6 are much more metamorphic rock, or recrystallized rock, than the ones we had at station 2. I had the impression that the ones we were sampling at station 6 were - were really inclusions in the - anorthositic gabbro -and had - had been probably considerably metamorphosed by it being included in it; whereas, the ones we had at station 2 were a separate rock type apparently, as I recall it, anyway.||MCC|Okay; that's good.||LMP-LM|Ken, let me just say that I - My impression is that there was a lot more action in the rocks at station 6 than 2, I saw a lot more; a lot more was evident, the inclusions and, some of the patterns, some of the other things we saw.||||Tape 114A/6|||0? 02 52 08|MCC|All right, sir. Let's go on to the second one, and it said: Do we understand that there were no breccias at station 8?||LMP-LM|? In the one - that parent orthopyroxene piagiociase rock - was a breccia in the sense it was fractured and was injected by dark glass. But it would be what we would call a mosaic breccia, in that respect, I think, and not the - Didn't see any station 6- or station 2-type breccias there at all. Other than the subfloor gabbro, that orthopyroxene piagiociase rock was the only major rock type I think we saw, unless we picked up some in the rake sample.||MCC|Okay. Okay; the third one says: What are your impressions of the distribution of the - the familiar subfloor gabbros throughout the EVA-3 traverse?||LMP-LM|Well, I don't - I don't - I think we discussed that a little bit on the traverse - quite a bit, as a matter of fact. The impression I had was that most of the traverse on the plains, with the one exception of - of Van Serg Crater, were -    We were in box fields or fragment fields that were almost - well, were dominately subfloor. And visually from the Rover, I had no impression of any other significant rock type, with the exception of occasional blocks of the gray variety of the subfloor gabbro. And I don't know - Gene -    I don't know what Gene's impression was. He was driving a lot, but - pass it on.||CDR-LM|I think - we actually even commented when we hit the breaking slope coming back out of station b and 7, and then back off at - coming back down nt 8 - how the terrain features changed. I think that was due principally to the - to the - what we've been calling the subfloor material evident. And there again, it was, what I would say., particularly mantled, filleted, much like we nave here where the LM is, with the exception of Van Serg, where we actually saw fragmental boulders for the most part, a lot less buried sitting on the surface.||||||Tape 114A/7||MCC|All right, sir. At Van Serg, some rocks were' described as gray breccias, and some contained white fragments. Was there a variety of breccias present?||LMP-LM|I think - I think not, Ken. My impression was that there was a variety only in their - in the degree to which they were fractured. We found and sampled, I think, the two major - one extreme - extremely fractured rock that I said was -was friable. Anyway, it broke into small pieces very easily with a hammer or in your hand, if you worked at it. And the other was a breccia that was not - was much more cohesive than that. It was not fractured or friable at all, but they both were on the rim, and I think they were just varieties of — probably of shock fracturing.||MCC|Okay. Could the Van Serg breccias correlate with the blue-gray material at Cochise?|07 02 56 40|LMP-LM|That's possible, I guess. But my first guess would be that the blue-gray at Cochise was blue-gray subfloor. And, well, I don't know. That's a good question. That's a good question. We -Maybe with the pictures we have, we can work out the - an attitude - approximate attitude on that contact that I talked about in Cochise, and see if it would project over reasonably to Van Serg. I wouldn't be surprised if it would. That's a good - that's a good point. To me they looked very similar.||MCC|Okay. And you guys sure you're eating?||LMP-LM|But - but - Ken, Ken, Ken - -||MCC|Go ahead.||CDR-LM|Yes, we're eating. We're fixing and eating at the same time.||CC|You're mighty efficient. Go ahead. You were starting to say something.||LMP-LM|You just - yes, Ken. I think from a distance we saw the blue-gray in Cochise, you couldn't||||Tape 114A/8|||||make a definite correlation. But it's a good idea and ought to be considered as one of the possibilities. The other is that ve just had a window in the subfloor that coincidentally - I mean one underneath the subfloor might be that breccia. Oh, incidentally - the Van Serg impact hit that window.||MCC|Okay. Can you tell us anything about the cowpie at Van Serg. Was that a clast in the breccia?||LMP-LM|Negative. It was a - excuse me; I have my mouth full.||MCC|It's about time.||LMP-LM|It was an ag - it was an aggregate of irregular -looked like agglutinated glass in fragments just sitting on the rim of Van Serg. And the reason I said I thought it was in place or had - had fallen there and crystallized there, is that there were four or five similar fragments arranged in a small coherent area. Not making that very clear I don't think, but it looks as if it hit and broke apart upon hitting a little bit but didn't - didn't really splatter or - or break apart In any significant manner.||MCC|All right.||LMP-LM|There are similar things - I tell you what it looks like. If anybody'd walked up the rim of Kilauea Iki in the ash out there, and or. top of the ash, there are bombs that were fairly clearly molten when they hit, and they had just - just enough spring to break when they hit. But they - the individual pieces didn't move very far at all. And you can see that pattern on Kilauea Iki. And it was the same kind of thing, except that there was no directional aspect of it here.||MCC|Okay.||LMP-LM|And that's not to say it's volcanic g-ass. That's just the kind of pattern it was.||||||Tape 114A/9||MCC|Okay. Can you tell us if the darker material in the bottom of Van Serg was similar to the collected rim material?|07 03 00 52|LMP-LM|I think so, except as Gene pointed out, the clasts were coarser. They were coarser in the bottom than about anything we saw in the rim.||MCC|Okay. Are there any distinctive features, other than color, to separate tan from blue-gray breccias, such as joining, or massive nature, continuity, anything of that nature?||LMP-LM|Yes, we're - -||CDR-LM|Where did we find those tan breccias?||CC|Challenger, this is Bob. I think we were talking about some of them, I think, at station 1 the first night. We had both natures. In fact, I think we had - Didn't we have two of those in the same rock together?||LMP-LM|They were both gabbros.||CC|Yes, excuse me - -|07 03 01 57|LMP-LM|Bob, they were tan gabbros and blue-gray gabbros.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 115A/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|07 03 02 52|CC|Roger. Okay, yesterday, excuse me, I wasn't reading the question. Okay, the breccias - they were tan and blue-gray breccias yesterday at station 2, were not - were there not? You have the two type - types of breccias at station 2.||LMP-LM|Oh well, yes, yes, that's right. And now as I think back I guess that's the main difference between the tan rocks at station 2 and station 6, but the ones at 6 appear to be - have an igneous texture or at least a very crystalline texture and inclusion-like masses of other rocks. Whereas , the ones at station 2 they - they seem to be fragment breccias, as I recall. That's right, although they may have been recrystalliaed or metamorphosed, they were clearly breccias at station 2. I just forgot about that.|07 03 03 00|CC|Okay, copy that. Okay, and can you amplify your description going out to station 6. In particular were there blue-gray and tan-gray bands on the North Massif?||LMP-LM|Rather than bands, there were lines that appeared to be the upper terminus of the - of the source of the boulders that were strewn below that line. And those lines tended to be either - show a blue-gray source or a tan-gray source, if you will.||LMP-LM|Oh, those ...||CC|Challenger, if you - if you think you're talking to us, you're breaking up badly.|07 03 04 14|LMP-LM|I just thought you might be interested, we just had a little spurt of dust come up by the window.||CC|Was there a sleigh with it?||LMP-LM|Wise guy.||CC|Okay. Did you see very much of ausi;, or was it just one little shot?||||Tape 115A/2||||LMP-LM|Can I - one little shot, it was actually just particles. Something we threw out must have popped.||CC|Okay, do you have any preliminary stratigraphic sequence for the plains?||LMP-LM|For the plains, huh? Well, my gaess would be that the Van Serg breccias were the oldest rocks. The gabbro - subfloor gabbro's the next oldest, and the mantling material's the youngest. But that's -the only good clear relationship was mantle on top of the subfloor gabbros. I - we really don't have a good relationship of the breccias and I just - I guess I lean towards thinking that that Van Serg was a window in the sub floor rather than being a bed of some kind, on top of the subfloor.|07 03 06 11|CC|Okay, and do you have an opinion on what underlies the Sculptured Hills?||LMP-LM|Well, I think, we said - the rake sample is probably going to tell the tale there. My guess is from the boulder - boulders and subfloor around up there that - are of gabbro and maybe the Sculptured Hills are a version of the subfloor rock. I don't think that the orthopyroxene anorthosite rock was necessarily indigenous to the Sculptured Hills. It was glass-coated and permeated by glass so I suspect it may have been thrown there by an impact somewhere else.||CC|All right sir, we've got one las-; thing for you to clean up. Back on page 7-6 of your checklist, it. looks like we may have skipped some steps on the GAS RETURN valve, and like to make sure that you get to AUTO and the GAS DIVERTER PUSHED to CABIN before you stow the oxygen hoses.||LMP-LM|Okay, Ken, we got CABIN GAS RETURN, AUTO.||CC|Okay, understand AUTO and you got the select to CABIN?|07 03 08 10|LMP-LM|Yes, GAS DIVERTER pushed to CA3IX and we're trying the PGAs now.||||||Tape 115A/3||CC|All right, sir.||CDR-LM|And I guess if - if you could go in - my feeling is if you go to the bottom of every one of those large craters like Camelot, you could examine some of these fragments on the walls and down into the bottom, I just get a feeling you'd find this -this blue-gray breccia down there.||CC|All right, sir.||CDR-LM|I mean in all the big craters like Camelot.||LMP-LM|Well we - I think maybe that's true, however, we did not see isolated fragments of it very often, if at all, out here on the, the plains themselves, away from the craters. So if the blue-gray breccia does - the Van Serg breccia does underlie the subfloor, the craters are not - it's far enough that the craters we have apparently have not penetrated and brought up much of that kind of material. Well that's it.|07 03 09 45|CC|Okay guys, it's time to press on and finish up chow time and I've got your stowage summaries whenever you're ready for that, to get started on.||LMP-LM|Okay, Ken let us finish eating, then we'll go back to work.||CC|Okay, give me a call when you're ready.|07 03 10 17|LMP-LM|I'll help you in just a second.|07 03 l4 10|LMP-LM|Okay. Okay. Ken I'd like to go ahead and hear your recommendations on stowage and I'll write it down.||CC|Roger. Page 2-2. I've got some numbers to fill in at the bottom under the collection bap; stowage.||LMP-LM|Okay, I've got it.||||Tape 115A/4||||CC|Okay, number 1 with the aft engine cover is ba.' S. And then the second line, it's bag 7- The third line it's bag 6 left hand and 5 right hand. And the last line is bag 2 and 4. And you can disregard the max weights.||LMP-LM|Okay, just so we got it straight aft engine cover, bag 8. Left hand side, bag 7. Left hand plus the right hand side; number 6 left land and 5 right. And the ISA bags 2 and 4.||CC|That's affirmative.|07 03 15 24|LMP-LM|Okay.|07 03 18 57|CC|Hey, Jack, the people down here watching things noticed that your SUIT ISOL valve is still in DISCONNECT if you're trying to dry the suit out you might check that. It's your option what you want to do with It.|07 03 19 12|LMP-LM|I'm glad somebody is watching things. Thank you.|07 03 43 25|CDR-LM|Ken we're in the process of getting all these bags in the proper places, now.|07 03 48 03|LMP-LM|Ken, this is Jack, why don't you make a note that mag Bravo is empty, with miscellaneous photos since the last report on it.|07 03 48 15|CC|Okay.|07 03 51 36|CDR-LM|And, Ken, we're stowing mag Nancy at a reading 153|07 03 51 44|CC|Okay, copy 153.|07 04 04 15|CDR-LM|Houston, Challenger.||CC|Go ahead, Geno.||CDR-LM|Okay, Ken we're - all we've got left to stow r.ow is the buddy SLSS bag and that's in work. And we got all the ETB stuff taken care of. All the ether bags are stowed per your recommendation. We'll be configuring the ECS for sleep and putting||||||Tape 115A/5|||up the hammocks here shortly and as soon as we can get cleaned up personally a little bit, we'll be in the sack.||CC|Okay. Sounds great,||CC|Hey, Geno, the guys are looking at that buddy SLSS bag and suggested you all make sure that you're going to have room to do the equipment jettison and get the hatch open and all that. They had planned on stowing it the next day.||CDR-LM|That's a good thought, Ken. Thank you, Ed. The fact is that probably may think more convenient -we were going to be smart and get ahead here but, thank you.||CC|The faster I run, the behinder I get.||CDR-LM|Yes. I keep forgetting these checklists have been exercised a hundred thousand times.|07 04 06 50|CC|Yes, we keep remembering that.|07 04 11 06|CC|Challenger, Houston. If you'll just give us a call when you're ready to sack out we won't bother you and just that way we can keep track of what you're doing and when you're about ready to go to bed and we'll get you up at an appropriate time.||LMP-LM|Okay, Ken, this is Jack. I guess I have the duty biomed tonight, so I'll give you a call when we're turning out the lights.||CC|Okay.||LMP-LM|And it won't be too long.|07 04 11 33|CC|All right. You guys are doing pretty good. You're almost caught up.||LMP-LM|Hey, Ken, working through this thing, we haven't been able to find instructions for the stowage of the EV gloves. Do your friends back there have any recommendations?||||Tape 115A/6||||CC|Okay, stand by one and I'll check on that.|07 04 l4 13|CC|"Okay, Jack, we can stick those things on ""Che comm panel for now, and then tomorrow on page 7-l4, it's going to have you stow them in the LEVA bags but for the time being if you just stick those up on the panel, set them aside - you'll use them tomorrow."||LMP-LM|Okay, Ken got you. Yes, they're going to get the inside of the LEVA pretty dirty.|07 04 14 59|CC|Well, from what we've seen, Jack. I thir.k everything's going to be about the same color by the time you get through.||LMP-LM|Okay, it didn’t bother your - your EVA, did it Ken, to have a little dust in your helmet?||CC|Wo, no - that's kind of nice to have.||LMP-LM|Hey, an experienced fellow like you might have a recommendation on how to get my visor up.||CC|Yes, give it to the CMP.||CC|We were just debating down here how come you guys threw away those nice clean gloves and kept the dirty ones.||LMP-LM|I wish you hadn't ask that Pete. (Laughter) We were just debating that too.||CC|How long are your arms, Jack.||LMP-LM|You do all sorts of things.||LMP-LM|Hey, they're out on the porch as a matter of fact. That's not too far fetched.|07 04 17 08|LMP-LM|I guess there's some old friends you jur>” imte ‘„o get rid of, Pete.||CC|Yes, that figures.||||||Tape 115A/7||CC|Hey, you guys have had some real winners there. Don't change a good thing.|07 04 17 41|LMP-LM|Well, they seemed to do all right for us. I guess that's the way. We were half-way thinking, but not thinking very well, as was witnessed in our checklist procedures tonight.||CC|Ah, you're doing outstanding.|07 04 20 08|CC|Challenger, Houston. On your comm, your checklist will call for going to down-voice backup. And, tonight, we'd rather just leave it in the normal voice. So if you leave the configuration you have, rather than change it; - that would be a good deal for us.||CDR-LM|Okay, Ken, I only got part of that, I was scrubbing my face here. You want to save the same comm configuration we've got right now. Is that correct?||CC|That's affirmative.|07 04 22 02|CDR-LM|Okay. That's easy.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 116A/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|07 04 36 55|LMP-LM|Okay, Ken. Gene just stowed the EVA antenna.||CC|Okay.||LMP-LM|And I'll be off here just for a few minutes, biomed, so I'll be back with you when I turn in.||CC|Okay. I may have misled you earlier when I said, we weren't going to lose any time. We can - we can get you 8 hours up to about 19 after the hour. After that, we're going to have to start rearranging things to get 8 hours.|07 04 37 38|LMP-LM|Well, Gene's almost in his hammock now. And I will be shortly, so I think we're probably in pretty good, shape.||CC|Okay, that's fine. I just - I didn't want to mislead you.||LMP-LM|That's all right, you've never misled me before. Well, let me think about that.||CC|Was going to say, you catch on awful slow, if that's true.||LMP-LM|Right.|07 04 39 18|LMP-LM|Ken, I'm going to take off my headset here and jump into the hammock. What - what time we getting up CET - Central Time?||CC|Well, it's going to be roughly 45 minutes past the time listed at 182:39. So - are you asking for it in local time?||CDR-LM|Yes, I - My watch is set on Houston time. What time will it be?||CC|Be about - -||LMP-LM|Eight hours from when?||CC|Be about 12:15, Geno.||||Tape ll6A/2||||CDR-LM|Okay, that sounds great, Deke. It won't -We're just cleaning up a few minor things and we'll actually probably be asleep in the next 10 to 15 minutes.||CC|Okay', sleep good. You had a lovely day. Hope tomorrow's as good.||CDR-LM|Sorry to keep - Thank you, boss. Sorry to keep you up so late. But appreciate it very much.||CC|We're enjoying it.||CC|Hey, Gene, before you unplug you might —|07 04 40 25|CDR-LM|Okay, I'm going off the air.||CC|- - Check your - check the Suit Flow valve. Looks like it's not flowing, if that's the configuartion you want.||CDR-LM|Yes, we've got them - we got them loth flowing. And we've got good circulation in the cockpit. If it looks good to you down there, we're in good shape up here.||CC|Looks fine.

If you happen to have a summary report of EVA-3, I'd sure like to hear it.||CC|Okay. We'll do that. Let me give you a - a quick rundown on review of what we're going to do this morning. We've got the extra RCS trim burn that's going to be coming in, and I've got a pad for that guy. And I have about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 one-liners to go into your Flight Plan, to bring it up to date. The general plan is to do a minus-X RCS on the trim maneuver, in order to avoid impinging on the SIM bay. That burn will be about 30 seconds worth. And that's going to give you about 9 foot per second DELTA-V. The maneuvers have all been checked out, and it's a reasonable time line. And so, I have both the plane change and the trim pads for you. And that may cut into your eat period just a little bit. So, you might keep that in mind, that when you get a chance to nibble; that's probably a good - good thing to be doing. And then once we finish the plane change, we - we're going to be back on the nominal Flight Plan, and pressing on in a - just like we have been. We'll be leaving the mapping camera in ana taking pictures with it still retracted, in a||||Tape 118B/2|||||attempt to avoid increasing the number of cycles on the camera. And we'll be running the SPS PU valve in the decreased position, in order to optimize our propellant loadings.||CMP|Ah ha! Okay. That sounds like it's good.||CC|So, when you're ready to copy some of those things, that's - Might be a good thing to get started on. Go ahead and finish squaring away your cockpit. And, while they're putting together an official summary, I can tell you my unofficial summary of EVA-3 is that that sure is super. You've got to watch those tapes when you get down. That's really a - that's really a spectacular place, as you can probably see. And they found a lot of mighty interesting rocks there. Jack, being a true geologist, is making up new geological terms as he goes along.||CMP|(Laughter) I can - yes, I bet.||CC|What you ought to do is, when he gets aboard, you ought to tell him that you saw a bunch of vertical dikelets over on the north side of the massif. Tell him they were very dark, very small.||CMP|Vertical dikelets?||CC|Yes, I think that's the word he coined on the way down there.||CMP|Dikelets? Oh, okay (laughter).||CMP|Hey, I got a Update Book here. I guess it'll be good for a trim burn - trim ...||CC|Okay. In general, let me tell you also that your RCS is 4.7 above the Flight Plan. And, just as a summary, unless you want to plot them, I'll just tell you that the oxygen and the hydrogen are doing good things. And you've got plenty of it. And I'm ready to give you a - The first pad will be a trim RCS burn and the second one will be the plane change burn.||||||Tape Il8B/3||CMP|Okay. No, that's good on the hydrogen and oxygen. And, I'm ready to copy the trim P30 pad.||CC|Okay. I'll give you the trim. RCS/G&N; 374l6; GET 181:34:01.22; plus 0009-2, all zips, and all zips; roll 180, 179, 316; 0067.3, plus 0062.4; 0009.2, 0:30, 0009.2; 13, 292.3, 29-9• And at Sirius and Rigel, 118, 159, 349. This will be four jets, minus-X on the RCS. And, I'd like to just add a comment here about the attitude. This attitude Is one that's computed after you've gone to the plane-change REFSMMAT. And when you call P4l, you'll be getting a different set of attitudes computed out of it because of the P4l computing a plus-X burn. But, when you're in attitude and P4l's called, and you get to the DELTA-V register, you should be able to put all of the DELTA-V In one axis .|07 09 20 52|CMP|Oh, okay. This really is a posigrade burn is what you're saying. And I really won't be able to trim it?||CC|I'm not sure I understood your comment there.||CMP|Well, in other words, we're not - we're not changing NOUN 8l. You know, like we do on the SEP maneuver.||CC|Oh. That's - that's correct. You're going to see the numbers go to zero during the burn.||CMP|Okay. Real good. We just won't - ... won't be the right attitude. We'll use the VERB 29 maneuver and use that attitude.||CC|"That's correct. And when you geo there, ""Chat: should put it all in the X-axis."||CMP|Okay. Mighty fine.||CC|Now I'm ready for the readback.||CMP|Oh, let me read it tack. Okay, it'll be GiN/RCS for the Trim burn. Weight, is 37^16; 'T_. is 181:34:01.22. I'm not sure on the seconds. Is ~hat correct.||||Tape 118B/4||||CC|That's correct.||CMP|Okay.

Sextant star is 13, shaft is 292.3, trunnion is 29.9- That'll be Sirius and Rigel, 118, missed the pitch align and the yaw align is 349- It'll be four jets, minus-X, and it'll be at the plane change REFSMMAT.||CC|Okay. And that pitch align is 159-|07 09 23 01|CMP|Okay. Pitch align, 159-||CC|Okay. The next one will be the plane change, and I'll have that ready in just a second.||CMP|Okay.

I've got, a couple of Flight Plan things xo give you when you're ready for thax .||||||Tape 118B/5||CMP|Okay. I'm with you.||CC|Okay. The first one is at 180 hours and 20 minutes.||CMP|I've got it.||CC|Okay. We owe you an attitude there and the attitude will be 179, 222, 359* The HIGH GAIN: pitch, minus 39; yaw, 145. Why don't you read them back, individually as we go along?||CMP|Okay. Roll, 179; pitch, 222; yaw, 359- HIGH GAIN will be minus 39 and 145*||CC|Okay. And that's the - that's at 180:20. That's with the VERB 49 there. The next one is at l8l:35, which is on the next page, and It's going to be at VERB 49, maneuver to LOPC. What we're going to do here is two separate maneuvers. We're going to do a maneuver which is a roll, so that when you do the next one, you'll avoid the gimbal lock because of the direction that the CMC would normally maneuver you. So, this maneuver is going to be in two parts. The first one we're calling a VERB 49 maneuver to the gimbal lock avoidance attitude at l8l:35* That attitude 08l, l8l, and 317- The HIGH GAIN: PITCH, minus 19; YAW, 227, and AUTO and NARROW for AOS.|07 09 28 50|CMP|Okay, at l8l:35, we'll have a VERB 49 to gimbal lock avoidance; roll 08l, l8l, and 317. HIGH GAIN will be a PITCH of minus 19, and YAW, 227; AUTO and NARROW for AOS.||CC|Okay. Now at l8l:43, you can just skip that high gain call out. At l8l:45, we want ~o add a VERB 49 maneuver to the LOPC burn attitude.||CMP|Okay. At 181:45, VERB 49 to LOPC burn attitude.||CC|Okay. Now on the next page, we go over to 182:15. And, I want to add a PU VALVE to DECREASE.||CMP|182:15. PU VALVE to DECREASE.||||Tape 118B/6||||CC|All right, sir. And I have zvo more to give you, but before we do that - Kow about let's terminate the jet monitor by calling P30 - P2C, and a VERB 21 NOUN 26 to all zips, and then we can up-Iink while we're finishing.|07 09 30 47|CMP|Okay. You have ACCEPT.||CC|Okay. And you got the monitor terminated?|07 09 31 00|CMP|Yes. It's terminated.||CMP|I guess it went to P30 faster than it showed up down there or went into P30 not through it.||CC|Okay, why don't you put the PAH CAN1ERA to STANDBY and POWER, ON, while we're about it and we can let them look at that stuff while we're getting the rest of our Flight Plan updates?|07 09 31 45|CMP|PAN CAMERA, STANDBY; POWER is ON,||CC|Okay, thank you.||CC|All right. Let's go back to our updates and the next one should come at 182:44.||CMP|Okay. 182:44.||CC|"Okay. At 182:44, I want to delete the ""MAPPING CAMERA, EXTEND."""||CMP|"Okay. Delete the ""MAPPING CAMERA, EXTEND."" Wait a minute. I scratched out the opening the cover. We got to do that."||CC|Yes. You won't do that because we're going to the pictures anyhow.||CMP|Yes. Okay.||CC|Okay. Then the next thing we want to do is at 132:48 just a half inch down, I have a new attitude for you. Where it says C97» 06b, C_9, it's now going to be 096, 097, and 352; and tne orb rate attitude is still all zeros.||||||Tape llSB/7||CMP|Okay. The attitude after the P20 option 5 plus-X forward will be 096, 097 and 252 and orb rate is 0.||CC|Okay, that last angle was 352. I'm not sure we got that right.|07 07 33 30|CMP|Okay. 352 for Yaw. That's correct.||CC|All right, sir. And while we're about it, why don't you take the PAN CAMERA POWER back OFF?|07 09 33 51|CMP|Okay. Pan cam - pan ca - PAN CAMERA POWER is OFF (laughter).||CC|Okay, and as long as we're talking about pan cameras, let's go to 183:45,||CMP|183:45. Okay.||CC|"Okay, and after the pan camera block, want to add ""V OVER H OVERRIDE to HIGH ALTITUDE."""||CMP|"Okay.

Okay, mapping camera, delete the ""MAPPING CAMERA, RETRACT."""||CC|All right, sir. And let's see what else we have here - how about running your paw over most of your biomed sensors? Looks like you've got some noise on there. Ar.d avoid changing them. Why don't you just kind of rub on each one and see if we can get it to come in a good signal?||CMP|Okay.

The one thing that I see that may have to change is - I gave you a DELTA-V for the RCS burn that wasn't very useful, and we have to set it up to count in the other direction. There's a couple of things you do - like set it to 130.||CMP|(Laughter) Yes, okay.||CC|It's just a backup monitor anyhow end sc it's -setting it to 100 is probably the first thing to do.||CMP|Yes , I know.||CMP|Okay.

Then I looked around and there was nothing there. You know, no hives or anything like that. So I got out some of that carry [?j cream and put that on and that stopped it and went back to sleep.||CC|Okay.

With 30 seconds of burn time, by my stopwatch there, I ended up with a plus -no, let's see - with a minus - minus 0.5 X. I think 0 in Y and a plus 0.5 in Z.

And I don't remember if I explained - -||CMP|... star check.|07 11 05 29|CC|Yes. Okay. And I don't know if you've got an explanation on why your angles changed for the P20 business after the burn, but, this - this plane change burn is going to have a little orbit shaping in it as well as the previous one.

I was wondering about that but - dl, tell you - those guys in the trench down there knot, so much more about what's going on when they calculate that stuff than I do that I'll - I'll believe them.||CC|Say, Ron, are you - are you in a place where you spare a minute or 2?

Did you catch any of it at all?||CMP|Well, I - I got the briefing, or the report from it from the CAPCOM, but it sounds like it was a mighty fine ceremony and something that this nation can really be proud of.|07 11 07 40|NASA|Well, Ron, there's one thing that the President wanted to make sure that you got. And I had hoped to do it last night. We've been in very close touch with the White House and the President has been following closely what - what's going on up there and, of course, it's absolutely fascinating to us down here. But he wanted to be sure that you ||||Tape 119B/2|||||understood that he'd like to wish you Godspeed as you return to Earth. And I must say I'd like tc add that and also add that, from everything I've heard, this is a spectacular success.|07 11 08 24|CMP|Thank you very much, there, Dr. Fletcher, and please convey my thinks to Mr. President. I appreciate that very much, and I - I also appreciate the opportunity to be able to do something for my country and I - hopefully, this is the one thing that I will be able to do. And I certainly appreciate it. Just the thoughts, themselves, really.|07 11 08 49|NASA|Well, very, good, Ron. I'd just like to say that I - I've never - I've never had any idea whatsoever that things would go so well in the scientific part of the - of the orbital science. It's - it's almost unbelievable when I talk to the guys in the backroom, and I just wanted to nake sure that you knew that I knew it.||CMP|Yes, sir. We certainly do and they worked real hard to get the - these experiments and the equipment all squared away. I was following along with them pretty well and I had lot of confidence.|07 11 09 29|NASA|Well, very good. Thanks kindly.||CMP|Yes, sir.

And he's given us a summary of the late news. And the weather couldn't be worse in Houston. It had to be better on the Moon or in orbit around it. This morning more cold and drizzle blanketed the Houston metropolitan area. Yesterday morning it was 32 degrees. This morning a little wanner but a lot wetter, and it's getting colder on Friday. On the national-:.nternaticnal scene: Peace talks in Paris between Dr. Henry Kissinger and Le Due Tho have ended - at least for the time being. Dr. Kissinger is in Washington today to brief President Mixon on the talks. The past 3-1/2 weeks , the pair of negotiators have held 58 hours of talks. Neither side is giving out||||||Tape 119B/5|||"any hints. When asked about the cease-fire by Christmas, Dr. Kissinger told reporters at Andrews, ""I don't want to make any predictions."" The U.S. by sizeable vote has had its assessment to the fund of the United Nations reduced by a vote of 8l to 27. The U.S. will now pay only 25 percent of the cost rather than the present 31 percent. Transatlantic fares may drop beginning in February. The International Air Transport Association says all carriers will set their own prices. It appears that air travelers to Europe next year may get some real bargains. In the hotly contested and federally supervised United Mine Workers election, the insurgent candidate, Arnold Miller, has gone into a lead over incumbent President Tony Boyle. Miller has led a grass roots movement to oust Boyle who took over the union control from the late John L. Lewis. We mentioned the rather dismal weather in the Houston area this morning, but the midwest and northeast are really gettir- * some bad weather. Ice storms seriously hampered the northern part of the nation, from Idaho to the eastern seaboard. After almost a year, troops involved in the India-Pakistani War are beginning to go back to their homelands. Truce-line maps have been exchanged and approved by both governments. Civil servants of the European Common Market, they're called Eurocrats, are on strike. The 8000 employees walked off the job due to a salary dispute."||CC|On the regional and local scene: the Houston City council has vetoed a plan to build a nev commuter airstrip in southwest Houston for the STOL aircraft. Residents of the area have been protesting. The community of Tomball, north of Houston, is looking for a new police force. The police chief and seven officers walked off the job Tuesday, after the City Council refused the officers a pay raise. In Harris County, the State Highway Patrol end reserve police have been called in to maintain police protection. That's maintain protection in Tomball. The project to expend the - expand the Armand Bayou as a park and wildlife refuge has been given a boost with a $100,000 pledge. So far $350,000 has been pledged and $750,000 is||||Tape 119B/6|||||needed to gain Federal matching funds. Galveston will hold a school bond election on February 3rd. The bonds, if okayed, will be used to air-condition all schools not so equipped and to improve lighting in two schools. It's a light day ir. sports; the head coaching job for SMU is open, teing considered are North Carolina coach Bill Dooley, and Washington coach Jim Owens. George Blanda, a living testimony for the over-40 set will become the oldest man ever to play football this Sunday. Prior to Blanda, I guess, we've had some other folks, but this ought to be a new record. In pro basketball, Houston didn't play last night. Currently, Baltimore, Boston, Milwaukee, and Los Angeles lead the divisions. In pro hockey, Alberta beat the Houston Aeros, 3 tc 2. The big news In Houston sports is a City Council approval of the Greenway Plaza as a site for the 10-l/2-million-dollar sports arena. And finally in - Christmas shopping is in full swing. Christmas trees are in tents, on street corners, and supermarket sites all over the area. Private homes throughout the whole area are lighting up with decorations ranging from happy Santa Clauses in sleighs to nativity scenes. It will be a Christmas world waiting for you when you come hone. And that ends our summary for this morning.||CMP|That's a good summary; appreciate it. Little bit of everything in there.||CC|Yes, it looks like Mr. Kokowsky [?] reads a lot of newspapers there.||CMP|(Laughter) He sure did.|07 11 25 29|CC|Okay, Ron. We're picking up some thermal problems on the pan camera. Would you manually roll left to 30 degrees and we'll hold it until we've passed - you know the terminator - or cross the terminator.||CMP|Okay.||||||Tape 119B/7||CC|And, Ron, that terminator crossing comes fairly close to the burn, so you might think about -if it looks agreeable to you, just go ahead and we'll use that as the burn attitude. You'll have to get a new P40 trim to take care of the gimbal offsets. So you may see a slight Pitch and Yaw attitude change.||CMP|Okay; that's no problem. I'll just roll left and then use a P4l trim.||CMP|(Cough) I hit ACCEL COMMAND to make that 90-deer roll the other day, or just a while ago. And, if you hit your stick a little too hard, you really wrapped it up to a little better than a degree a second. So, you can really get a sensation of roll, especially when you can see the Moon.|07 11 28 01|CMP|How's that? Pretty good attitude?||CC|Looks like we're going to have to go a little bit further. Why don't you give us 5 or 10 more?||CMP|Okay, I didn't let go of the stick -||CC|You're learning our tricks, aren't you?||CMP|(Laughter) Used a teacup of gas there.||CC|Okay, now - now, you're in good shape.|07 11 28 33|CMP|Okay, we'll stop it right there, then.

They gave us a song here from - from there first, and they're all fine and they.'re in their Surface Checklist - getting ready for ascent.||CMP|Hey, great! Okay, I ought to get my prep for transfer ready here. You know, kind of last night and also this morning as I was flying across the back side of the Moon here - been thinking a little bit, and I wonder - It seems like that the Aristarcinian-age craters, you know the ones that are fairly - fairly fresh, you know they're not Copernican - They don't have rays and this type thing, but they're fairly fresh in their slumping characteristics on the inside and this type thing. But they all seem to have a mare floor-, you know -a flat, mare floor - a volcanic-type floor ir. the -thing, and I wonder if there's anybody that's tried, to come up with the theory at all that maybe cu. n£iG. a rjiantle iur—ng tne — tne _^_r_s~ar— cinian era auring the formation of the Moon, you||||Tape 120B/2|||||know. And those craters at that point in time were - were penetrating that - that liquid mantle.||CC|It's a thought. Roger, Ron. That's a good thought. You get kind of the feeling like you're seeing -like out Hawaii where craters like- stick up out of the ocean and you see the walls of the craters in the ocean up in amongst them. Ths.t's the kind of feeling you get?|07 13 03 57|CMP|Must not be because I don't know for sure what you mean (chuckle).||CC|Roger.||CMP|I guess the feeling I was getting is that most the Aristarcinian-age craters all nave some sort of a mound - a domical structure down in the bottom of the crater. You know, even the smaller ones, some - some of the - the 30 - 50 kilometer si -class, you know? And the - you know, the flat floor - they look - they look volcanic or. the floor. Some of the bigger ones, of course, they're definitely volcanic - lava flows on the floor of these big craters. The slumping of the vails is not as fresh as a Copernican-age fra - crater, but, you know, they - It's not all beat up, either. The walls - the crater walls had a slumping coming down through there and it's still fairly fresh in the slumping, but you don't have any rays shoving up on the outside of the crater. So they're kina of Aristarcinian age.||CC|Roger; copy.||CMP|And - and ail - all of the craters that ~re tha.t age have the mare fill in them, you know?|07 13 05 30|CC|Roger.||CMP|Like there's - there must have been ^ome volcanic activity during that period of time.||CC|I - I guess my feelings were, Ron, th--t - Whut I'm trying to say is - -||||||Tape 120B/3||CMP|365, 3 - Go ahead.||CC|If you had a - If you'd had a liquid mantle and the crater sticking up through it, you might have the mare not only on the floor of the crater, but the mare would be on the exterior walls of the crater. You'd see a high-water mark along the exterior, wouldn't you?||CMP|Oh, I see what you're saying. Yes. No, you - you had to have some sort of a solid crust and then the impacts hit the solid crust and broke through the crust and got down into the liquid mantle.||CC|Okay. Wow I got you, Ron.||CMP|That's the type of operation I was thinking about.||CC|Roger. I got you.|07 15 05 35|CMP|Yes. You know, but it would have to be a relatively thin crust.||CC|Roger. Understand.||CMP|Okay. I've got the temporary stowage bags all set. *** (Humming) From the decon bags on A-2 -got one bag of ropes in there - put those - Where can I put those? Right hand - yes, okay. That's in the right-hand temporary stowage bay.||CC|Okay, Ron. You're coming up on 1 minute to pan camera T-start. I'll call you in 30 seconds.||CMP|Okay.|07 13 08 03|CC|Okay, 30 seconds to T-start time.||CMP|Okay, I'll say we started at - excuse me, I've got a piece of candy in my mouth - *** 6:^1.

Strauss)|07 12 53 14|CC|Good morning, Challenger and thank you for the vocal rendition from - from the Moon, there.||CDR-LM|Well, we thank you for your kind music. We wanted to let you know we were thinking about you this morning, Gordie.||CC|You just beat us to it, but - -||CDR-LM|That was a great song.||CC|Decided to play it anyway, because it's such a - such a pretty selection.||CDR-LM|"I think it's very apropo at the moment. I guess I can just wait for ""Hail Purdue,"" huh?"||CC|Yes, just stand by, you'll probably hear it before you get back.||CDR-LM|Hey, we've been stirring for about 15 or 20 minutes. We're in the midst of a nice hamburger omelet (laughter) and assorted accessories. As a matter of fact, it's all over us. And if you'll give me 5 minutes, I'll be ready to go on the PGNS, unless you want to start it sooner.|07 12 54 37|CC|Okay, we'll - No hurry, finish up and get cleaned up there. And the only change, we have some change in the timing as far as the checklist so we can gain back the time we're behind now, which is actually less than an hour. And the only hardware change other than deletions is to - that we'd like you to leave Demand REG A, CLOSED, at all times. So whenever you come across a place that says OPEN at CABIN or EGRESS, we'd like you to leave it CLOSED.||||Tape 121A/2||||LMP-LM|Okay, Gordie. We've got you on that.||CDR-LM|And, Gordie, could I have a quick status report on - on America and Challenger?||CC|You bet. America is just as good as gold, just like always. Ron got off the trim burn on the back side followed by a good plane change on the front side. In fact he - G&J1! cut-off was a tenth and - or less in all axes. Didn't even need to trim it. So, he's in about a 62-1/2 circular, I believe, and waiting for you to come up and join him.||CDR-LM|Okay, how's his consumables?||CC|Stand by.|07 12 56 21|CC|Okay, America's consumables are great and so are yours. There is a possibility we may have to switch to ASCENT WATER, just prior to lift-off. Everything really is in good shape.||CDR-LM|Those are good words, Gordie. Thank you.||LMP-LM|Hey, Gordie. In honor of one of your comm handovers last night, and in the tradition of Apollo 8, I've got paraphrase of a familiar poem for you.||CC|Okay; go ahead.||LMP-LM|"Well, it's ""The week before Christmas and all through the IM, not a commander was stirring, not even Cernan. The samples were stowed in their places with care, in hopes that with you, they soon will be there. And Cernan - Gene in his hammock and I in my cap, had just settled our brains for a long - short lunar nap. But out on the - up on comm loop there rose such a scatter, I sprang from my hammock, to see what was the matter. The Sun on the breast of the surface below gave the luster of objects, as if in snow. And what to my wandering eyes should appear, but a miniature Rover and eight tiny reindeer. And a little old driver so lively and"||||||Tape 121A/3|||quick, I knew in a moment, it must be St. Nick. I heard him exclaim as he - over the hills he did speed. Merry Christmas to all and to all - to you all Godspeed.||CC|Very good.||CDR-LM|Gordo, that was the first time I heard that and I got to say - I got to say that is beautiful.||CC|I agree. Did the LMP get any sleep or did he spend all night composing that?||LMP-LM|People always said we ought to have a poet in space.||CDR-LM|I don't think we've made it yet.||LMP-LM|No, for some reason I really woke up with one of your handovers last night, and that was how I went back to sleep.||LMP-LM|Gordy, that's for the kids. ...|07 12 59 24|CC|Roger, Jack.|07 13 00 20|CC|Challenger, Houston. One update for the postsleep procedure. I understand you brought in the LMP's camera, and we want to be sure you get that into the jett bag before the final jettison here, and by the way, you're STAY for the final jettison.||CDR-LM|Okay, Gordy. It's already in the jett bag, thank you.||LMP-LM|And, Gordy, you might make some notes that, before I put it in there, I took another black-and-white or black-and-white window pan with mag Nancy.||CC|Okay, Jack. Roger.||CDR-LM|Gordo, on REQ A, that is - you interpret that is just a small leak by the reg? That it would be usable, if you had to.||||Tape 121A/4||||CC|That's affirmative, Geno. It's a small slow leak and it is usable If - if needed.||CDR-LM|Okay, thank you. It's coming up so far, I think that's all - all the system anomalies we've got, isn't it?||CC|That's all I can think of at the moment. I do have revised times for the rest of the Lunar Surface Checklist which, at a convenient time, I can give to you - so that you'll have a hDW-goes-it as you go on down the line here.||CDR-LM|Why don't you give them to us now, Gordy?||CC|Okay, turn to page 7-9*||CDR-LM|Go ahead.||CC|"Okay, 7-9 LGC/IMU POWER UP, change that time from 183:04 to 184:10.

Next page, l4, cabin repress is 186:15* Cabin cleanup for launch is 186:20. And on the following page, we're going to delete the P22 but we'd like you to go all the procedures except those from ""VERB 95 ENTER,"" through ""POO ENTER,"" inclusive - the center section of procedures. So you'll still be closing the rendezvous radar breakers, going to LGC, and parking the antenna and copying pad. Over."||CDR-LM|Okay, we're going to delete everything from VERB 95 through POO on P22. That's the center of the page.||CC|That's affirmative and then the next page, cabin prep for ascent Is 186:45, and instead of 39 minutes we're going to have you do that in 3 minutes. And you'll actually - you should have a little more time than that, since you got up early. That puts you right back with time line, at lift-off minus 1 hour 15, at 186:48. Over.||||||Tape 121A/5||CDR-LM|Okay, top at 7-15 where we pick up - what was going to be the beginning of the P22? Have you got a time up there?||CC|I guess we'll just have to work that in with cabin cleanup time. We had deleted that whole time block but you do have to catch those procedures.||CDR-LM|Okay, and then the times on the top of 7-10, for P22, are not applicable, and I guess you can give us an update for our P57 lift-off time.|07 13 05 55|CC|That's affirmative. We might - that might be -there's a couple more changes coming at me here but let me make sure I got them straight and I'll call you later. Go ahead with whatever you were doing.||CDR-LM|Okay.||CDR-LM|(Cough) Gordy, if I - if I get ready for the LGC/IMU power up, I'll give you a call even though it comes earlier but I'd like to get that started, as soon as we're ready to start it.||CC|Okay. We concur with that.||LMP-LM|Hey, Gordy, as far as the food, medication, and sleep goes - no medication. Gene had 5 hours of good sleep, I had probably around my usual 6, in spite of my poetic inclinations. And the food -we continued to do well, I believe. We've eaten a wet pack apiece last night. We got one this morning. We've eaten our scrambled eggs and sausage yesterday, and as we've run out of juices and tea. And which is somewhat of an inconvenience I might say. And if you've got any specific questions, I can fill you in on it but, I think, food-wise we've done pretty well.||CC|Can you give us a feel on the fluid intake?||LMP-LM|Well, that's what I was trying to do when I said we'd drunk all the juices and tea. Plus, Gene, in particular, takes water from the hose.||||Tape 121A/6|||07 13 08 13|CC|Okay, Jack, fine. Sounds good.|07 13 17 32|CDR-LM|Okay, Gordy, it's PGNs power up time.||CC|Okay, Geno, I - and I've got a couple more items to completely clean up the checklist whenever you can get to that.||CDR-LM|I'll let Jack give you a call. I'm going to start on the PGNs, if we're ready.||CDR-LM|Gordy, you ready for a PGN?||CC|That's affirmative, finally got you a GO to start it as per checklist.|07 13 18 33|CDR-LM|Okay there's the PRO, I did get the RESTART. I got the NO ATT, the DAP, GIMBAL LOCK light, and a PROGRAM ALARM light's on.||CC|Roger.|07 13 19 37|CDR-LM|MARK it the gimbal operate breaker is CLOSED.||CC|Roger.|07 13 19 48|LMP-LM|That's the I MU OPERATE breaker. Yes. Stand by for a 90 seconds.||CC|And we're ready for a POWER AMP PRIMARY and HIGH BIT RATE.|07 13 20 10|CDR-LM|Okay. You got it.|07 13 27 35|CDR-LM|Okay, Gordo, self test is complete and it's GO, and I'll give you an E-memory dump.||CC|Okay, we're ready, standing by for it. And while it's coming, I could give you the update for the next page.||CDR-LM|Okay, it's coming at you and you can go with the updates on the next page.||CC|Okay. Page 7-10, your P57 lift-off time, upper right corner, is 188:01:43-85. Over.||||||Tape 121A/7||CDR-LM|?Okay, Gordy, P57 lift-off time 188:01:43.85.||CC|That's affirmative. And now we'd like you to delete all the steps below that lift-off time, from the A/T-3 data star info box through the VERB 32 after the last - after for the remaining data stars and after last star. In other words, just delete all between the box and up to circuit breaker AOT LAMP, OPEN. And, of course, they'll be no P22 time, over.||CDR-LM|Okay. Delete all the data star information between the start of that box and after last star VERB 34 ENTER, 00 ENTER.||CC|"That's correct and then turn to page 7-15. We're changing - we - looking here a little closer we find that radars are already in good position, so you can delete all procedures on page 7-159 except ""Copy Ascent pads, CSI pad, and LM DAP weight."""||CDR-LM|Okay. We deleted everything but the last three lines on that page.||CC|Okay. On page 7-12, back up a couple pages. In the lower right corner there, in the blank space, you might jot down 185:58, VHF check with command module. And that'll be according to the procedures on 7-15 in the box. You might just parenthesis 7-15 to remind you where the procedure is. But the comm check will come during that time when you're preping for equipment jettison, or right around there.||CDR-LM|Okay. We got that.||CC|Okay. That's all we got for you, and we have the E-MOD dump okay.||CDR-LM|Okay.|07 13 29 03|CDR-LM|Gordy, we're in POO and data and we're standing by for your up-link, and how long does that AOT HEATER breaker have to be open? I pushed it IN at 184:08.||||Tape 121A/8||||CC|Okay. I'll get an answer for that, and I think we'll be coming with the up-link here shortly.||CC|Gene, no time constraint on that AOT breaker; except, if it's foggy, it hasn't been in long|||enough.||CDR-LM|(Laughter) Thank you, Gordy.|07 13 31 10|CC|Challenger. Here comes your up-link.||CDR-LM|Okay.|07 13 34 58|CC|Challenger, it's - your computer. You have a state vector, a time increment, and an RLS.||CDR-LM|Thank you, Gordy.||CDR-LM|Yes, it likes - it likes the command module's orbit.|07 13 37 49|CC|That's good.|07 13 54 35|CC|Okay, we see that.|07 13 54 39|CDR-LM|Houston, there's a NOUN 05.||CC|Doesn't look like the Challenger shifted around much in the last 3 days.||CDR-LM|Well, at least it always settles back to the same spot.|07 13 55 47|CC|Okay. You're clear to torque those.|07 13 59 58|LMP-LM|Say, Gordy, are we clear to jettison the buddy SLSS bag, now?||CC|That's affirmative, Jack. We've determined you won't need it for rock stowage. And along the same line, John Young suggested that you might check your checklist pockets on your suits, when you get to that point. His were full of dirt. You might want to take those off and discard them If that's the case, so that it won't fly up and get you at Insertion.||||||Tape 121A/9||CDR-LM|Yes, we already did that, Gordy. They were a mess, and we took them off. They're in the jettison bag now.||CC|Okay.||CDR-LM|We're going to take time out for about 15 or 20 minutes of mandatory housekeeping here.||CC|Okay, understand.||CDR-LM|That's - that's prior to suit donning.|07 14 00 59|CC|Roger.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 1213/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|07 14 12 33|CC|We're going to leave it in heater straight through until ascent because the - the LM got up late and they are not doing their P22 today.||CMP|Oh, okay, okay.

You can still see the dark material, dark albedo-type stuff on the eastern side of the crater. And the demarcation between the two of them. It just disappeared.||CC|Okay, Ron.

I was pointing up to Family Mountain.||CMP|Through the telescope, anyhow, the whole area down there's a lot lighter than it used to be, ana I am sure this is due to the increase of the Sun angle. However, the landing site itself and the whole valley extending on out to the Serenitatis annulus is still darker - darker than the surrounding territory, but it - the higher Sun now, it's a lighter tan than it used to be. Come on, catch up with us there. Okay, I got three good narks right in a row there. Just because I missed the TCA, couldn't catch up with it. Last one. She's gone.

Yes, I found my bright mound crater. I wish I could do P24. I could just take a nark, somewhere west. I could - I can do that, can't I? Let's see - ENTER, 317 ENTER; probably get a 409 or something. Okay, I'll take a couple cf marks or. it. Yes. I was afraid of that. This :.s fair eno'^i , Still has the brown - the tannish ejecta off of it, and it's hit over in the - in that volcanic rille area.

The rendezvous radar looks a little warm, it - I'm reading about 90 degrees.||CC|Okay 90.||LMP-LM|Okay, Gordy, are you ready for AGS STATUS tc OPERATE?||CC|Let me check. We're ready, Jack; go ahead.|07 16 18 32|CDR-LM|Okay, Gordo, NOUN 72, R2 is not varying. I've got, both shaft and trunnion, and crosspointers varying.||CC|Okay, Geno. We copy that.|07 16 19 26|CDR-LM|Okay, Gordy. On the radar test, everything is GO. Everything is within limits. The only anomaly is the one I just reported.||CC|Okay, Geno. And 20 seconds here on the hour even, we'll have a site handover to Goldstone.||CDR-LM|Okay.|07 16 24 12|CC|Geno, Houston. You can go ahead ana park the radar at 0 and 30.|07 16 24 20|CDR-LM|Yes. It's going there right now, a:-, a a.atter of f act.||||||Tape 123A/3||CC|Okay.|07 16 26 14|LMP-LM|Okay, Houston. The AGS gyro calibration is complete and looks pretty good. I guess Z's a little -little - No, that - Yes, Z's a little more than you'd expect, I guess.||CC|Okay, Jack.||CC|Challenger, Houston. Words on the radar. When you parked it there, we saw it go to the proper places. From all our indications, the interface between the radar and the PGNS is okay. And our best guess is some kind of self-test problem.||CDR-LM|Okay, Gordy. Thank you.|07 16 28 04|CDR-LM|Rate gyros are good.||CC|Roger.|07 16 29 28|LMP-LM|Okay, Gordy. I'm gcing to go to AUTO on the S-BAND, if you want it.||CC|Okay. We're GO. And go ahead with the check.||CDR-LM|Okay, Gordy. I'll give you a call before I fire, but we're in the process of getting ready for the RCS.||CC|Roger.|07 16 30 25|CDR-LM|Okay, Gordo. Here we go.|07 16 31 39|CDR-LM|Gordy, the AGS check looked good.||CC|Roger. It looked good here also.|07 16 31 57|LMP-LM|Okay; SYSTEM A QUAD 4 talkback still sticky.||CC|Roger, Jack.|07 16 33 05|CDR-LM|Okay. Here we go 011 the PGNS, Gordy.||CC|Okay, Geno.|07 16 33 47|CDR-LM|Looked good here, Gordy.||||Tape 123A/4|||07 16 33 54|LMP-LM|And, you've got DATA and POO.|07 16 34 00|CC|Okay. Your up-links are coming. We'll give you a vector and zero the pos/neg cells. Your PLS is okay.|07 16 36 00|CC|Challenger, Houston. We'd like you to put the ASCENT BATTERIES OK according to the procedures on the next nage, 8-8, just a little early because of pre-conditioning noticed in - tefore descent. And we checked your RGAs during the hot fire, ana your hot fire itself, and they both looked good.||LMP-LM|Thank you, Gordo.|07 l6 36 28|CC|And, Challenger, it's your computer now.||LMP-LM|Thank you.|07 16 39 57|CDR-LM|Gordo, did you ever get any word on the Rover batteries?||CC|No. I sure haven't. I haven't heard on that one.||CDR-LM|It's not important. 1 just wondered whether those things were going to be working back there.||CC|Okay. We've got no reason to believe they won't. When you get down to parking the rendezvous radar antenna after this P57, give me a call. We're going to change the parking position.||CDR-LM|Okay.||CDR-LM|Why don't you just give me the numbers now?||CC|"Oka;/. Do a - as - as the checklist, shovfa, except do a VERB 4l NOUN 72 to 0 and 30 degrees. Go to SLEW, and then delete the ""manual slew for 3 seconds."" They want to leave it there for temperature purposes. This will be a cooler position for it during ascent."||CDR-LM|Okay. Understand. That's 0 and 03000.||CC|That's affirmative.||||||Tape 123A/5||CDR-LM|And the first 01 - first 04 was 0.01.||CC|Roger. We got that.|07 16 44 28|CC|Challenger, Houston. We've got you on television now. We have a good picture.||CDR-LM|Glad to see old Rover's still -working.|07 16 48 59|CC|Okay. We got your NOUN 05?|07 16 49 21|CC|Go ahead and torque them.|07 16 53 14|CDR-LM|Okay, Houston. P12 looks good, and the PGNS is in AUTO.|07 16 53 20|CC|Okay, Challenger. There's no change to 047 and 053. I do have a K-factor for you.||LMP-LM|Go ahead.||CC|Okay. It's 179:59:59-82. Over.||LMP-LM|Okay; 15 - 179:59:59-82.||CC|That's right, Jack.|07 16 55 25|CC|Challenger, Houston. I have a couple of PIPA bias updates for the PGNS.|07 16 55 39|LMP-LM|Okay. Go ahead.||CC|Okay, a VERB - with a VERB 21 NOUN 01, load address l452 with 03045, and load address 1454 with 05246. Over.||LMP-LM|Okay. That's 1452 with 03045; and 1454, 05246.||CC|Readback1s good.|07 16 57 02|LMP-LM|Okay. They're in, Houston.||CC|Okay. Look good to us.|07 16 58 09|CMP-CM|Hey, Houston; America.||||Tape 123A/6||||CC|Roger, America. This is Houston. You're loud and clear.|07 16 58 21|CMP-CM|Okay, Gordo. Got my suit on.||CC|Okay, Ron. We gave you the wrong skinny on the comm configuration last rev. We're actually, now, in a full MSFN relay mode. We'd like you to stay off of VOX. Over.|07 16 58 44|CMP-CM|Can do. I'm off VOX.|07 16 59 18|CC|Challenger, Houston. When you get to a break point, I have some words on what you can expect in the way of guidance steering. Over.||CDR-LM|Stand by.|07 17 00 08|CDR-LM|Okay, Gordy. You can go ahead and talk while we're putting our helmets and gloves on.||CC|Okay. We never got around to debriefing you on PDI, but the out-of-plane indications you saw on the AGS during descent were proper. We had changed your - your vector slightly just prior to PDI, and so the AGS was navigating and indicating properly. We just ran the present ascent targets in the LMS with the half-a-mile crossrange as shown on the pad, and you're going to be steering south. That's the way the steering direction goes. That's to your left, for Geio's benefit. And the crosspointer indicated a maximum of about 13 feet-per-second out-of-plane velocity at about ignition plus 3 minutes and 50 seconds, and then came on back to zero. Over. That - that velocity was AGS velocity.||LMP-LM|Okay, Gordo. That's good information to have.||CDR-LM|Understand; the AGS on that one. Okay.|07 17 02 43|CMP-CM|Okay, Houston. America maneuvering to attitude.||CC|Roger, America.|07 17 03 00|CMP-CM|Also I'll start pumping up the cabin, DIRECT' O2-||||||Tape 123A/7||CC|Okay.|07 17 03 08|LMP-LM|ASCENT WATER is OPEN, Houston.||CC|Roger.|07 17 04 24|CDR-LM|Okay, Houston.

We're getting a repeat on Ron.||CMP|I tell you what, I'll - let's turn the VHF off.||CDR-LM|Up to you, Ron.||CMP|Okay, I'm just going to turn the VHF off.||CC|Challenger, Houston. There will be no vector update, no PIPA update. The NOUN 1*9s you're seeing are what we expect. You can go ahead and accept them.||LMP-LM|Okay, Geno. You can - RANGE/RANGE FATE, shaft and trunnion are all GO - -||CDR-LM|Roger, Gordo.||LMP-LM|Okay, you like everything?||CDR-LM|You can start taking your marks, Jack.||LMP-LM|Okay - -||CDR-LM|The DAP Is changed.||LMP-LM|** - 122.

We're looking good on board.||CC|America, Houston - -||LMP-LM|Okay.||CC|- - the NOUN 49 you have there looks good to us.||LMP-LM|Okay, I checked the inverter. You can pull INVERTER 1 breaker.|07 17 38 27|CDR-LM|INVERTER 1 breaker PULLED.||CMP|I'm going to ... Okay, you want me to - you're not going to ship me a vector?||CC|Negative. No up-link for you either, Ron.||CMP|Okay.|07 17 39 21|LMP-LM|Houston, you happy with the omnis from the Challenger?||CC|That's affirmative. Keep it like it is.||LMP-LM|Okay. Terminator's coming up, Geno. We got lights and everything we need?||LMP-LM|AGS looks good.||CMP|Challenger, America. I don't see you in the sextant yet. But it's probably because of Sun shafting or something.||LMP-LM|Okay, anytime you want them. Okay, ready? 188?||CDR-LM|Hello, Houston. Challenger has a visual on America at about 112 miles.||CC|Okay, and America's just called. I don't know if you heard him. He hasn't got you in the sextant yet. You might check your light on. He is getting a VHF mark. Over.||CDR-LM|Okay, light is OK.||LMP-LM|Okay, 55 and 5700. That's good. That's right.||||Tape 124/12||||LMP-LM|The AGS saw that out of plane, Geno.||CC|Challenger, this is Houston. I have a MSFN TPI for you.||LMP-LM|Go ahead.||CC|Okay. DELTA-V is a plus 74.0; Y, olus 3-9; and -A|||Z, plus 9*0. DELTA-V total is 74.7- And, for once, they didn't give us the braking, Jack.||LMP-LM|(Laughter) Okay, plus 74.0, plus 3.9, plus 9-0, and total 74.0.||CC|That total is 74.7*||LMP-LM|Sorry. Okay, 74.7-||LMP-LM|I'm working on my third mark.||CDR-LM|And, Houston; Challenger. I still have a visual on America.||CC|Okay. I'm sure Ron's problem is he is looking into the Sun.||CDR-LM|That's right because he's sunlit up there.||CMP|Oh, you are correct, Houston.||CC|Challenger, we'd like AFT OMNI now.||LMP-LM|Okay, going AFT.|07 17 44 56|CMP-LM|America, how do you read Challenger?||LMP-LM|He's not - he's turned his VHF off. You want it on?||CMP|I'm reading you relay now, Challenger. This is America.||CDR-LM|Okay, that's fine, Ron.||CMP|Let me know when you want a voice - VH? voice check, there, and we'll make sure we go to VHF.||||||Tape 124/13||LMP-LM|Okay. And we're holding you at 93 miles right now.||CMP|Roger. That'd be about 92.7 > which is probably the delay.||CDR-LM|Okay, and you just went into darkness up there. I lost you.||CMP|Should be able to see you now, then.||CDR-LM|Yes, we're also in darkness.||CMP|You sure you got your tracker light on?||CDR-LM|That's affirm. I can see it flashing. We do have our tracker light on.||LMP-LM|See it flashing?||CDR-LM|Yes, I see a reflection on - -||CMP|Oh, I see it. Hey, I can't see you in the telescope, but I got you right in the sextant.||CDR-LM|Good. Outstanding, Babe.||LMP-LM|I got it. ...||CC|Challenger, Houston. No update on your LM weight.||CDR-LM|Okay; understand. No update on the weight.||CMP|And, Houston, I'm going to accept that because he was about 1 degree - almost to the edge of the sextant.|07 17 47 25|LMP-LM|Houston, can you tell Challenger what's wrong with our high gain?||CC|Stand by, Challenger. For America, go ahead and accept that one.||CMP|Okay, brought him right in - This is America -brought him right into the center.||CC|Challenger, Houston. Jack - -||||Tape 124/14||||LMP-LM|Okay, Houston - -||CC|- - if you have a free moment, you might try the steerable again: PITCH, 120; YAW, minus 70.||LMP-LM|Okeydoke, Gordy; 120 and minus 70.||LMP-LM|And - Okay, Houston, that's AUTO or. the HIGH GAIN. How do you read?||CC|Jack, you're loud and clear. Looks good.|07 17 49 57|LMP-LM|Gordy, I don't know what broke lock. Did you read us all through ascent? We had some up-link signal strength.||CC|That's affirmative. We read you loud and clear all the way. We haven't figured it out either.||LMP-LM|Okay, we had a loud up-link squeal - -||CC|Roger.||LMP-LM|- - on all - on omnis - on ommis as well as high gain.||CC|Roger.||CDR-LM|That's steerable.||LMP-LM|Excuse me.||CDR-LM|Okay, Gordy, Challenger's state vector is locked in with the raw data. We've got 12 marks going for us now.||CC|Roger.||CDR-LM|And, Houston, could we have an LOS time, please?||CC|Yes. Stand by.||CC|Challenger, LOS should be 188:51:15.||CDR-LM|Roger. 51:15-|07 17 52 18|CDR-LM|America, Challenger. We got you now just under 72 miles, and we're 279 feet per second closing.||||||Tape 124/15||CMP|Okay, got you 71 miles.||CMP|Hello, Challenger; America. You still there? I lost all my noise.||CDR-LM|Affirmed* We're still here. And, Ron, that ... is coming right up the pike.||CC|Challenger, Houston. For your information, the out-of-plane difference that we - that you probably saw there during ascent was - we think -in the PGNS. The AC-S is okay. There's probably a slight ... in the PGNS.||CDR-LM|Okay, Gordy. Understand.||CC|Challenger and America, Houston. If that noise, which is due to low signal strength on America, is bothering anyone, we could break down the relay and let you talk to each other VHF. Over.||CDR-LM|Yes, sir, Houston. This is Challenger. Let's break down the relay. And, America, let's go VHF.||CC|Okay.||CMP|Okay, America. I'm on VHF.||CMP|Okay; good.||CDR-LM|Okay, Houston. We have America on VHF.||CC|Roger.||CMP|I still got your echo there, Challenger. This is America.||CDR-LM|Okay.||LMP-LM|Gordy, you want to give us an explanation of the ascent engine mixture ratio problem.||CC|Let me get that story myself. We're still looking at the data. I'll try to have one for you before we lose you — at least the next time around, we will.||||Tape 124/16||||LMP-LM|Okay. Yes. Go ahead. Go ahead. How many marks you got? 35-5- Okay. Go ahead. Go. Go.|07 17 56 30|LMP-LM|Well, not very in Z; 15 feet per second difference But it agrees with the AGS, if that makes you feel any better.||CDR-LM|Hello, Houston. You were looking e,t our NOUN 8ls on the recycle. That's 17 marks.||CC|Roger, Challenger. And what it was on the APS there, we saw an indication, probably due to a temperature shift, which was a possible indication of unbalance in propellant usage there. And it was sort of confirmed by an increase in the roll moment offset, so we just played the conservative thing and terminated ascent feed.||LMP-LM|Okay, Gordy. Thank you. I was just curious exactly what it was.||CC|Okay, and it's no problem for our TPI on the APS.|07 17 57 56|LMP-LM|Understand.||CMP|Okay, Challenger; America. I got tie NOUN 8l for you to recycle.||LMP-LM|Okay.||CMP|I agree with you pretty well.||LMP-LM|Outstanding.||CMP|Well, I say TPI is about 4.9, off 5 feet per second.||CC|America, Houston. Let's try the HIGH GAIN: PITCH, 0; YAW, 30; MANUAL and WIDE and leave it in MANUAL.||CMP|Hey, relay to me. I can't hear then, Challenger. Can you do that?||CC|Challenger, Houston - -||||||Tape 124/17||CMP|That's all right. I'll get them.||LMP-LM|Go ahead, Houston. This is Challenger.||CC|Okay, would you relay to America to try the HIGH GAIN: PITCH, 0; YAW, 30; MANUAL and WIDE.||LMP-LM|You want PITCH, 0; YAW at 30; MANUAL and WIDE. That's pitch, 0, yaw 30; MANUAL and WIDE.||CC|Yes, that's affirmative.||CMP|Okay, I got them.||LMP-LM|Okay. He's working at it.||CMP|It doesn't work. B is better than that. There's OMNI A; how's that?||CC|Challenger, Houston. Over.||CMP|Houston, America. How do you read me?|07 18 oo 54|LMP-LM|Go ahead, Houston. This is Challenger,||CC|Okay. Stand by, America. We just barely read you. Go ahead.||CMP|Okay, just a second. I can read you loud and clear now.||CC|Okay, you're readable. For Challenger, the MSFN Z was kind of weak. We're expecting more like a plus 20 for the DELTA-V solution for TPI, and Zi that's what all the airborne systems seem to be converging on. Over.||CDR-LM|That sounds right. We prepared that way up here. Glad to hear that. Thank you.||CC|Roger.||CMP|||LMP-LM|And, Houston, Challenger. We're plotting them right on the black line. Coming right up the pike.||||Tape 124/18||||CC|Okeydoke. Sounds great.||CMP|Okay, Challenger; America. I got you 49 miles now. Okay?||CMP|Okay. I'll check it again pretty quick, but I had the running lights and the rendezvous light on.||CC|Challenger, this is Houston. If yojl lose the steerables ... blockage, go to APT OMNI.||LMP-LM|Roger.|07 18 03 43|CMP|Okay, Challenger; America. They're both checked on. I'm going to check the circuit breakers.||CDR-LM|Yes. They are both IN, and I - I just started picking you up in the telescope.||CMP|(Laughter) You're going to sleep with them. They're too big.||CMP|(Laughter) I don't care what you look like; come on back. I was going to shave and look nice for you, but I didn't have time to shave either. So - (laughter)||CMP|Yes, I heard you lost a couple fenders or something.|07 18 07 10|CMP|I'm with you. I'm already in final comm.||CDR-LM|Okay, ...||CMP|Your what?||CMP|Well, let me doublecheck it. 188: 5!; : 57*00 .||CMP|We're lucky. (Laughter)||CMP|That's right.||CMP|Okay, you ready to copy my NOUN 8ls?||||||Tape 124/19||CDR-LM|Go ahead.||CMP|Minus 75-95 minus 4.8 - -||CC|Challenger, Houston. We'd like APT OMNI now.||CMP|- - and Z is a minus 17-6.||CMP|Okay, copy correctly. I'll maneuver to TPI attitude.||CC|America, Houston. We'd like NARROW and REACQ on the HIGH GAIN.||CC|Challenger, Houston. We see you heading toward gimbal lock. Over.|07 18 10 06|CDR-LM|No, you don't. I'm just rolling - yawing.||CC|Okay, let me check back on that call; sorry.||CDR-LM|Yes, this is Just normal procedure. I'm rolling l80.||CC|Okay, we're about 2 minutes to LOS. All the solutions look good to us. I guess, if we apply the voting logic, we go with the PGNS. Over.||CDR-LM|Okay, we've already decided that we are going to go with the PGNS.

It's a little bit scorched; but it's all intact, as far as - as much as I can tell.||CDR-LM|.,. this bird is good enough to fly again.||LMP-LM|||CDR-LM|Yes, sir. I'll even move left. How's that? We got 60 percent left. ... I like to fly.|07 19 08 05|CDR-LM|You in your maneuver, Ron?||CMP|Yes. It's maneuvering now.||CDR-LM|Okay, I'm going to go out and take a peek at your SIM bay up here. Yes, I know.||CDR-LM|See him okay, Jack? See him okay?||CMP|Okay, we're getting pretty close now. About another 5 degrees of roll is all. Can you see it?||CDR-LM|Yes .||CMP|Kov does the mapping camera look? Should be all covered up.||CDR-LM|Stand by.||CMP|Okay.||CDR-LM|... fly over there and take a look at it.||CMP|Okay.||CDR-LM|Sun's shining right in it.||CDR-LM|Okay, Ron. It looks intact here. There's one cover - -||CC|Challenger, Houston. Over.||||||Tape 125/7||CDR-LM|... cover on the right-hand side. Go ahead.||CC|We'd like you take a special look at the pan camera and see if you think maybe the lens is not completely stowed. Over.||CDR-LM|No, I'm looking at this thing upside down. There's the Sun - give me the location again of the pan camera, Houston,||CC|It's a round, barrel-type object, approximately right in the center of the SIM bay.||CMP|It's just - if you were standing in the shoes, the pan camera would be right in front of you.||CDR-LM|It's stowed; it's flush. There's one door open, Ron. If you were standing in the shoes, it's at the bottom hand - bottom left-hand side of the SIM bay.||CMP|Bottom left-hand side, if you're standing in the shoes.||CDR-LM|Yes. It looks like two covers open there. Doesn't it5 Jack?||CMP|Yes. Okay; well, that's part of the napping camera - bctton of that door that pushes open by itself.||CDR-LM|Okay, Well that's the only thing that's open. Everything is flush.||CMP|Okay. You think - is that a door that extends -if you're standing in the shoes - that extends out the bottom of the SIM bay or one that extends out - if you're standing on the shoes - it would be one the - extending on the left side of the SIM bay?||CDR-LM|Yes. It extends out trie left side towards the front of the spacecraft down in the bottom left-hand comer, if you're standing in the shoes. l;o you don't - -||||Tape 125/8||||CMP|Yes, Okay. Yes, that's the one tnat the camera pushes open by itself.||CDR-LM|Okay. Well, that's good. I can't see anything that's abnormal down there. Everything's covered; everything's flushed.||CC|Challenger, Houston.||CMP|Okay.||CC|Challenger, Houston. Over.|07 19 12 11|CMP|Houston, were you calling America?||CDR-LM|Gc ahead.||CC|Some more words on identifying whether the pan camera is stowed or not. The pan camera, as Ron said., is right in front of the shoes. And, if it's stowed - well, if it's not stowed properly, you should be able to see the lens or probably part of it. And if it's fully stowed, there'll be just a plan-faced barrel facing outward -silver colored. Over.||CDR-LM|It's stowed, Houston.||CC|Okay. It sounds good.||CDR-LM|It's got to be - there's nothing - It's stowed.||CDR-LM|The only thing abnormal is the service module plates, just forward - plus-X - of the SIM bay, are all blistered. It's forward of those EVA handholds.||CC|.Roger. We copy that. Our concern - or tne reason we're asking about the pan camera is - we have a higher than normal temperatures in the pan camera, and we were concerned whether it was either not completely stowed cr maybe there's a heater stuc.-c on. We'll check the heater out later on here.||||||Tape 125/9||CDR-LM|I'm going around the other side here a little bit, but it's - Yes, the long barrel, through the center down - X-X axis, deep into the SIM bay - then you have a little barrel - oh, about 3 inches - 2 or 3 inches - like about a 500-millimeter lens on a Hasselblad - sticking straight up, perpendicular to SIM bay, and it's well flushed. It's inside the box that It's next to.||CC|Okay, Geno.||CDR-LM|Yess it's normal.. There's nothing that's unstowed in that thing.||CDR-LM|||CC|Challenger, America. That's good on the inspection from Questions from here anyway. Clear to continue and proceed with docking.||CMP|Okay.||CDR-LM|It is unbelievable. This is the greatest flying in the world* Ron.||CMP|(laughter)||CDR-LM|Can you see me?||CMP|Yes, I can see you. Right in there. Yes.||CDR-LM|Reach out and tickle your probe.||CMP|(Laughter) Okay.||CDR-LM|Okay. Let's get - let's get this business going. Let's get in a docking attitude.||CMP|Okay; we'll maneuver to the docking attitude here.||CDR-LM|Ron, I can also see where your - where your HF comes out on this side, and - and it's flush with the box. It's completely stowed.||||Tape 12 5/10||||CMP|Okay. Well, that's the one. that T«e think is, the one on that side. The other side is the one that we are a little concerned with. We don't worry about it.||CDR-LM|It's stowed too.||CMP|Oh, okay.||CDR-LM|We were over there.||CMP|Okay. And I'm maneuvering back to the docking attitude.|07 19 15 43|CDR-LM|Your high gain is not pointing at the Earth, though, I don't believe.||CMP|Oh, we're not using it yet. It's pointing where the Earth will be when we maneuver back around.||CDR-LM|Okay.||LMP-LM|Another one from there?||CDR-LM|I'd try 11 and 8. That's what I'm doing.||LMP-LM|Right.||CDR-LM|... Guess I ought to pull my radar breakers, now that it's stowed.||CMP|Okay, Houston, can you see my logic: yet? Or you want to wait until the high gain? This is America.||CC|We can see it now, Ron. We can do it now.||CMP|Okay, LOGIC 1.|07 19 16 43|CMP|MARK it. LOGIC 2.|07 19 l6 46|CMP|MARK it.||CC|Ron, you're GO for PYRO ARM.||CMP|Okay.||||||Tape 125/11||CDR-LM|Backing off here a little bit, Ron. Give you a chance to maneuver.||CDR-LM|Hey, Jack, what are we forgetting? Let's see the high gain was - or the rendezvous radar is stowed. Okay, as soon as he gets his attitude, I'll get to mine.||CDR-LM|Looks like you've been flying well up there, partner, The spacecraft looks good.||CMP|Oh, you bet you.||CDR-LM|How far you got to go on your maneuvers?|07 19 18 22|CMP|About another 60 degrees of roll yet.||CDR-LM|Okay.||CMP|And about 10 degrees; pitch.||CC|America, gii^e us OMNI Alfa.||CDR-LM|Hey, Ron - -||CMP|Omni ... Oh, no, there we go.||CDR-LM|Okay, Ron, I can confirm your other HF antenna is stowed.||CMP|Okay5 good. Thank you.|07 19 19 32|CMP|Okay, the PYROs are ON. Sorry, but I am out of film in the DAC. You guys will just have to - -||CDR-LM|No problem.||CMP|- - be on TV (laughter).||CDR-LM|No problem. Let's just get in attitude and get those capture latches in that drogue.||CMP|Gkay.||||Tape 125/12||||CC|Ron, the high gain angles look good. Go NARROW and REACQ, and we should have you.||CMP|Okay. I'm in attitude, Gene.||CDR-LM|Okay, let me position so I can get. in attitude.||CC|And, America and Challenger, we've got a beautiful picture once again.||LMP-LM|Very good, Gordy. We're happy to give it to you.||CDR-LM|This worked out great, Ron.||CMP|Yes, it sure did.||CDR-LM|Null PGNS, and then I'll give it to you shortly.||CDR-LM|Okay, Ron, you've got it.||CMP|Okay.||CDR-LM|Okay, you've got it. I'm going into my maneuver.||CMP|I've got it.||CDR-LM|And that's the landing site down there. We pitched right through the landing site.||CMP|You did?||CDR-LM|Yes .||CMP|Key, good (laughter). Your - -||CDR-LM|Hey, don't - don't hit that hand. It's ...||LMP-LM|Yes (laughter). Well, the drogue :.s still ir. there.||CDR-LM|Okay. I've got you right out the overhead, Ron. i\row I'm going to yaw.||CMP|Okay, yaw her around.||||||Tape 125/13||CDR-LM|Okay, here we go. What a super flying machine!||CMP|Still looks kind of tinny to me.||CDR-LM|He's not going to have to do anything but thrust right into the - I might even get your roll angle zero for you by - by this maneuver. Okay, it's all yours.||CMP|(Laughter) Okay, I've got her.||CDR-LM|Should be looking - I'm looking right up your window.||CMP|Well, I got to translate through the - sideways||CDR-LM|a little bit here. The trouble is I'm looking right into the Sun.||LMP-LM|Yes. Change these focus to 6 feet.||CDR-LM|Okay, Jack, let's go over that thing again. We got anything else to do?||LMP-LM|Well, you're at the attitude. We're waiting to confirm capture, and then you flip MODE CONTROL, OFF.||CDR-LM|Wish the Sun would get out of the way.|07 19 24 46|CDR-LM|Looking good, babe. Keep it coming.||CMP|Okay. She's looking all right.||CDR-LM|Command module looks just as good as the day they put it on the pad.||CMP|And, you know, so does Challenger, by gosh. You're missing some of the pieces.||CDR-LM|Yes, one big piece we left behind.||CMP|Yes; right.||||Tape 125/I4||||CDR-LM|Ron, I guess I'm estimating you about 12 or 15 feet.||CMP|Yes, that's about right.||CDR-LM|Got my reticle coming right in the rendezvous window.||CMP|Okay. She ought to be coming right in there.||CDR-LM|Looking good. You're stable as a rock.||CDR-LM|Bet I'll be able to get with that. Give me a little warning on capture, Ron, so I can go FREE.||CMP|Okay; try to.||CDR-LM|I can see all your docking latches - or I can see half of them now, but they're all looking good.||CMP|Okay,||CMP|Coming in nice and slow; no problems.||CDR-LM|Okay, you're looking good, babe. 1 got you on my COAS right up in the middle of the window. Looking good.|07 19 28 33|CDR-LM|Looking good.||CMP|Okay.||CDR-LM|Must be a couple of feet away.||CMP|About 2 or 3 feet is all.||CDR-LM|Stand by, Jack.||CMP|Stand by. Should be getting about the same size.||CDR-LM|Looking good from here, Ron.||CMP|Stand by.||CDR-LM|... to have it here.||||||Tape 125/15||CMP|Okay; I didn't get it. Let me plus X it.||CDR-LM|Okay. You didn't get it.||CMP|Didn't get it. Okay. Might have been a little bit slow.||CMP|Stand by.|07 19 31 25|CDR-LM|You got it! CAPTURE!||CMP|Barber pole, capture go FREE.||CDR|Good. Start here; we're FREE. All you needed was - -||CMP|Okay, we're FREE over here. Let me check your rates. Okay, I'm squared away with the rates here.||CDR|All you needed was a little more DELTA-V.||CMP|Yes, a little more.||CDR|That looked good though, Ron. Very good.||CMP|Okay. That's a good one.||CDR|Okay, Houston, we have capture.||CMP|Okay, you ready - -||CDR|||CMP|A little bit - Not lined up here.||CDR|What did you say, Ron?||CMP|Well, we're not quite lined up here. Kind of drifted cff a little bit.||CDR|Okay; we'll stand by for you. Take your time.||CMP|Okay. Will do.

""As the Challenger leaves the surface of the Moon, we are conscious not of what we leave ""behind, but of what lies before us, The dreams that draw humanity forward seem always to be redeemed, if we believe in them strongly enough and pursue then with diligence and courage* Once we stood mystified by the stars; today we reach up to them. We do this not only because it is man's destiny to dream the impossible* to dare the impossible, and to do the ? impossible, but also because, in space, as on Earth; there are new answers and new opportunities for the improvement of and the enlargement of human existence. This may be the last time in this century that men will walk 011 the Moon, but space exploration will continue, the benefits of space exploration will continue and there will be new dreams to pursue, based on what we have learned. So let us not mistake the significance or miss the majesty of what we have witnessed. Few events have ever marked so clearly the passage of history from one epoch to another* If we understand this about the last flight of Apollo, t:ien trtuy we shall have touched *a many splendored thing. ' To Gene Ceman, Jack Schmitt, and Ron Evans, we say God speed you safely back to this good Earth. ?l"||CDR|Gordonthose are beautiful words by a great American President, We1re very honored to receive them; wef re very honored to be able to serve our country in a way that we otuisvo ui« Anc we tnan^i you.||||||Tape 125/19||LMP|Thank you very much, Gordy and Mr. President.||CMP|Mr. President, this is America.

Magazine Dog Dog is 40 percent remaining.||CC|I copy that.|07 23 31 23|CC|Okay, and, America, we've got a pitch of minus 67 and a yaw of 300 for the high gain.||LMP|Okay, Bob. Let me have the old Flight Plan changes.||CC|Okay. At page 195> excuse me - time 195:15 -that's page 304.||LMP|Go ahead.||CC|"Okay. It says, ""Set HIGH GAIK MANUAL, WIDE"" and the new angles will be pitch of minus 5 and yaw of 315. And the time will be 196:30 instead of 21:30."||LMP|Go ahead.||CC|"Okay. You might also at that point write in ""Verify all command module VHF OFF."" I'm sure Ron will 'understand what that means. He's been doing it all along anyway."||LMP|Yes.||CC|Okay, and then over at 195:31 -||||Tape 128/2||||LMP|That just means you want the VHF off, doesn't it?||CC|Right. All of these, I think - three switches over there along the side. And BEACON, RANGING and -||LMP|I think I understand that.||CC|"Okay. I thought even an LMP would understand that At 195:31, we're going to move ""LU.3TAR SOUNDER OPERATE to OPERATE."" The new start time there Will be 195:31:38. Over."||LMP|"Okay. ""LUNAR SOUNDER OPERATE"" will be done, new time will be 195:31:38."||CC|"Okay.

We're getting Ron out of his suit, so that he can operate more effectively and efficiently the SIM bay. And, then Jack and I are going to start getting out of our suits and trying to clean up a little bit, and that's going to probably be a long and tedious operation but we're just going to have to take that time.||CC|Okay. We copy that. And, Ron, HF 2 is the one - -||CDR|No, we'll be - -||CC|-    - that we're not quite sure if it's out and you might check a visual on that - I think you've looked at it before - when it's fully extended and —    and give us a clue whether it's 99 percent extended or not.

You can go to VHF now, and stand by on our call to come from STANDBY to ON.|08 00 54 56|CMP|Okay, MODE's in VHF.||CMP|Houston, America. What - Is somebody kind of afraid that maybe the antenna isn't all the way out? Is that what the problem is?||CC|That's affirm. They're worried about HF 2 not being all the way out, and they thi]ik that they won't get much - if it's partially extended. So we'll see what we can get with VHF instead.

If you draw a line from Shorty to that Reseau mark that's on the top of the South Massif -||CC|Copy that.||CMP|And then, extend abcut a little better than one-eighth of an inch toward Shorty from that Reseau mark. Have you - Yes, somewhere right in there. I'll look at it again the next time I come over. But, that's a bright spot on the top of the Massif that I hadn't noticed before in any of the observations going by there.||CC|Okay, I've got it marked down. We'll also see if we can find it on some bigger map.||CMP|Okay. You know that bright spot might already be there: but I don't think so. I don't remember seeing it.||CC|Okay, copy that.

Why don't you go to 196.20 in the Flight Plan? You're probably sitting there looking at it, anyway. And run through that block that's there. It starts at about 196:19. We told Jack to move it but since we're aborting this lunar sounder pass, let's go to 196:20 and carry out the steps in there with the following exceptions: Do not turn RECORDER or RADAR to OFF. Okay. And, we want LUNAR SOUNDER left in STANDBY.|08 01 33 31|CMP|Okay. Let me read those through.||CC|Okay, and don't move the HIGH GAIN. The HIGH GAIN has been taken care of already.||CMP|Okay, I'll do that. LUNAR SOUNDER is verified in STANDBY. DATA SYSTEM is coming on. HIGH GAIN is already working. SM/AC power. Jack, could you turn ON the SERVICE MODULE AC? I'31 get it. Yes. Okay. SERVICE MODULE AC POWER's OK.

Yes, I got that,||CC|Okay. We got that and I got a TEI-65 pad, when you get ready for it.||CMP|Okay, let me pull out the old book.||CC|Okay, and, Ron if you'll give us the computer, we're ready to up-link some loads for you. You'll leave the jet-on monitor and state vector.|08 01 37 53|CMP|You can have the computer.||CC|Okay, thank you.||CMP|Okay, I'm ready to copy the TEI.||CMP|Got it all dirty. Houston, America, I'm ready to copy the TEI pad.||CC|Okay, America; Houston. I'm ready to read the TEI pad if you're ready. It's an SPS/G&N, which is a surprise, I'm sure. And, it says: 3o54l; plus O.oO, plus 0.8l; 216:45:48.23; plus 2754.5, minus 0146.9, minus 0009-0; 179, 103, 359- The rest of the pad is NA. GDC align stars are Sirius and Rigel. I guess they picked some bright ones for you for a change. We have alignments of 136 - -||||Tape 129/6||||CMP|Hey, they're good ones.||CC|- - 160, and 034. Ullage is four jet, 12 seconds, and we're using lift-off REFSMMAT. Over.|08 01 4l 06|CMP|Okay, TEI - I've forgotten what rev it was.||CC|65.||CMP|SPS/G&N, 36^41 - 55, okay?||CC|65, 65.||CMP|Oh, 65 it is. Okay, now on 47, the weight - 36541; plus 0.60, plus 0,81, 216:45:48.23; plus 2754.5, minus 0146.9, minus 000.0, 179, 10 3, 359. Sirius and Rigel, 136, 160, 034. Jet, 12 seconds for ullage. And we use lift-off REFSMMAT, which is what we have right now.||CC|Okay, Ron, and you dropped out there at 2 momentary seconds. One, the DELTA-V^ was minus a 9.0. Ullage was four jets.|08 01 42 17|CMP|Okay, that's right. DELTA-V is minus 9.0 and Zj four-jet; ullage, 12 seconds. Lift-off REFSMMAT.||CC|Okay, you had a momentary dropout when you read those two figures.||CMP|Okay,||CC|And, America; Houston. Do you fellows think you have any chance, or would have any chance next time to take a picture of that possible impact point - with the handheld Hasselblad - or something?||CMP|Ah, sure can. You bet you. I think the best way to do it is with the 250 lens on the Hasselblad.||CC|Okay, It might be something worth getting just in case we don't hit it with the pan camera later on.||CMP|Okay.||||||Tape 129/7|08 01 44 33|CC|Okay, Ronald. The computer is yours and you can turn the LUNAR SOUTTOER RADAR switch OFF. Leave the RECORDER switch OK.||CMP|Okay. The RECORDER'S staying ON and we'll turn the - RADAR, OFF?||CC|Roger-, RADAR, OFF - RECORDER, ON and the computer is yours.|08 01 45 03|CMP|Okay, RADAR's going OFF and the RECORDER is still ON. And - we have ...||CMP|Yes, shaved there one time. Haven't shaved today; I'm going to do it later on.||CMP|How about getting the recorder going there?||CDR|What?||CMP|How about turning the recorder on? - Huh? It's right in here.|08 01 47 53|CMP|Yes. It's time to eat.|08 01 50 16|CMP|I don't care. Okay, WASTE to PURGE LINE HEATERS. They're ON. Then VENT.||CC|America, Houston. Ron? Over.||CMP|Roger; go ahead.||CC|Okay, one, while I'm talking to you how about flipping up and turning H TANK 3 FAN, OFF? cl|08 0l 53 03|CMP|Okay, TANK 3 is OFF.||CC|Okay, and then, how about you three guys giving us - giving some consideration the next 2 or 3 minutes to the following proposal? One, we totally aborted that lunar sounder pass because: One, we couldn't get the HF antenna out; and, two, because the temperature in the film cassette was too low. Those things are both taken care of now, And they're talking down here about essentially starting over at 197 hours, which will be the top of the next page, and pretending that that's 195 hours and running through that 195-hour page, beginning||||Tape 129/8|||||at 197 hours. The only problem with that, of course, is that it runs into your eat period and destroys that, which essentially rr.eans that you're going to get to bed 1 hour later. And I guess what we're saying is, if you're going to get to bed 1 hour later anyway, we might go ahead and ask you to do it, if you're agreeable. If you're clean-up -cleaning-up companions there have progressed far enough that you think you're going to get to bed on time and don't want to do it, then that's another story. So, how about chewing it over there and letting us know?|08 01 54 16|CMP|Okay, let me talk to the guys here for 1 minute, but I think we'll probably dc it. Stand by.||CMP|Hey, Houston; America. Let's press or_ and pretend like I'm eating between when I'm turning the LUNAR SOUNDER, OH, and OFF - Okay? In other words, let's get the lunar sounder pass.||CC|Okay, well, you're saying, well - well, we don't want you to have to do that in the middle of your eat period and destroy ... that, Ron. That's another concern we had here.||CMP|Don't worry about that. I - I can throw those switches on and I think the other guys can mix the food and I can eat it at the same time. No problem.||CC|Okay, we've got that recorded on tape there, For.. Okay, what we're going to do is essentially - -||CMP|Okay (laught er).||GC|- - start at the 195-hour page and we'll just mechanically add 2 hours to everything on that page and run through it as - on the: page. Okay? The change that we originally had in the Flight Plan, which I read - I don't know vhether it wai' to you or to - Jack, which moved t:e group from 19b:20 over to 196:30 - will still move over tn 19fo:30. So, that will stay as is. And, again, that will be, of course, at 198:30, then. Do you understand what I'm saying there? Over.||||||Tape 129/9||CMP|Yes, I think what you're saying is, we'll just do the Flight Plan like you - like we're starting at 195.||CC|Roger - -||CMP|- - like we'll be 2 hours later on the mission timer.||CC|Roger; you might call it miniclock update.||CMP|Okay. Sounds good. Lunar sounder operating time will be 197:31:38 then, right?||CC|That's affirmative.|08 01 59 02|CC|Okay, Ron, and two comments on that. Let me make a couple of other amendments to that. One, the lunar sounder operate time, instead of being 31:38 will be 32:51. At that 195 - top of the right-hand column on 195 there - be 195:32:51. Over.||CMP|And, Houston. These waste water dump and fuel cell purges - that doesn't foul up the lunar sounder, as I recall. I don't think, does it?||CC|Oh, we can go ahead and do those in parallel, right||CMP|Okay, good. That's what I thought.||CC|And, Ron, one other - Did you catch my one - my 32:51 update, there on that start time?||CMP|Did you say cancel it? I'm sorry.||CC|No, do you copy. I gave you 195:32:51 as the start time, instead of 31:38. Did you copy that?||CMP|Yes, I copied, I'm sorry. Used to working in VOX all the time and I forget to push the button.||CC|Okay, and the other thing we'd like to keep you aware of, if you hadn't noticed it, and that is that this thing, of course, Ron, is originally ... to a 196:30 plus, which means that you're going to be running 198:30 plus, which kind of looks like you're going to be eating at least a half an hour into your sleep period, at the very least. Over.||||Tape 129/10||||CMP|Yes, we understand that.|08 02 02 38|CC|Okay, Ron. We'd like to have Hg TANK 2 FAN, OFF, now please.|08 02 02 49|CMP|H2 TANK 2 is going OFF.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 130/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|08 02 27 XX||BEGIN LUNAR REV 56|C8 02 51 49|CC|Hello, America.

Did you get an ISS alarm on the back side just a few minutes ago?||CDR|No, sir.||CC|Okay. We lucked out. We'd - Since we'd had the jet monitor program operating and it hadn't been killed, which had originally been planned to come after the lunar sounder, there was a possibility that we'd get an alarm but looks like we don't have it. Good enough.||CMP|A'hat was going to cause that to come on?||CC|The possibility, Ron, was when you were reloading NOUN 79j getting a smaller dead band - it depends||||Tape 130/2|||||upon where the vehicle was at that time within the old dead band, EMP 523 might have suddenly found you outside the dead band and been unhappy.||CMP|Okay, I'm with you. Thank you.||CC|Okay, looks like we lucked out though.||CDR|Say, Bob. do you know - -||CC|Go.||CDR|Do you know any more about the demise of Challenger?||CC|We know that it was within 15 kilometers of where it was supposed to be, Gene. We could not get a visual on it. It was quite obvious that the geophone saw it and all that - there's no question about that, it's just that, as it turned out at the last minute it was pretty hare, to pick out where exactly it was going to be in order to have the TV camera there.||CDR|But everything appeared to function properly, huh, the ALSEP and you - you're pretty happy with it?||CC|Roger. Everything except the TV End, of course, that's just an extra goodie.|08 02 55 46|CC|And, America, if you guys are interested in trying to take a couple of 250-millimeter shots of that tonight, we've got a little camera pad here for it we can pass up - if you're interested.||CMP|Hey, you bet I'll take it - I want to try it.||CC|Okay, let me know when you get a piece of paper there, Ron.||CMP|Okay, go ahead.||CC|Okay, it's a LM impact TCA and it's time is 197:56:35 and the camera data is CX5, EL, 250, CEX, f/5.6, 1/125, infinity. Ana magazine Kappa Kappa or Kilo Kilo, and you can use up to 10 frames on it. Over.||||||Tape 130/3||CMP|Okay. I think I put Kappa Kappa back, I've got Oscar Oscar on there. How about it if I use that, okay?||CC|Okay, that's fine, Ron, And, we'd like to get tanks 2 and 3 FANs back OK.|08 02 57 26|CMP|2 and 3 are ON.||CC|Okay.||CDR|Hey, Bob. A quick summary on that rendezvous as far as LM performance was concerned. Handling characteristics were outstanding and pretty much the same as they have always been on LMs in the past. The APS burn - burn went nominal; the residuals on that one were actually quite big, about 744, that's feet per second - and we nulled those out and after that the midcourses were max of 1.3) then a max of 1.6 on the second one. But, after the TPI, we were coming up - up the pike right - over - right - all the way in the line-of-sight rates - actually both out of plane as well as in plane were - were zero - basically zero for out of plane and, as predicted, on a nominal curve for in plane. And it really ended up to be pretty much a storybook rendezvous.||CC|Okay. You want to give me that TPI again or did you already pass that down to ground? I didn't copy the residuals there?||CDR|No, I didn't tell them that. And we didn't get a chance to copy them down because I wanted to get them ail down on tape. It surprised me after the APS burn because they were relatively large. They were 7 feet-per-second in X, 4 in Y, and 4 in Z. And that was, I guess, just short of a 4—second burn somewhere around 4 seconds.||CC|Okay , copy that.||CDR|And one ether little thing, we put, I think, two marks, three marks - two or three marks in the AGS - manual ciarks s after the last midcourse, as we'd been doing in the simulator - three marks, and Jack tells me that the range rate ca^e right up to - right up to the actual radar-range rate -right up to 100 feet or so.||||Tape 130/4||||CC|Okay j copy that,|08 03 02 17|CDR|Bob, we're all just eating away here, anything interesting in the world news that's worth commenting on?||CC|Okay; stand by. Let me find out. Did you guys get any news this morning?||CDR|No, sir; we were busy otherwise.||CMP|Yes, I did.||CC|Okay, well, stand by and let me get hold of the people and see if we can get some news for you.||CC|Okay, Gene, we're working on that, it may take us a while to get it. And - but we ought to have it for you before the end of the pass. From my own experience in talking around here, although none of us hung around much to read that stuff today, we don't think anything much did happen in the world today. There is a report that something happened in outer space, and the moon vehicle, we believe, had a lift-off this afternoon, a rendezvous, we'll try and see if we can track down any further news of that. Over.||CDR|Okay, we're pretty much up on that one. Just wondering, you know, Mr. Truman's been pretty sick and so forth, wondered about some of those things, but no big deal, we can - we can wait.||CC|Okay, we'll get with you shortly.|08 03 06 07|CC|And, America, did you fellows do ycur hydrogen purge on the back side?||CMP|That's affirm.

So it'll be Kilo, Quebec, and Romeo for tomorrow.||CMP|Okay; Kilo, Quebec3 and Romeo.|08 03 27 33|LMP|Houston, 17•||CC|Go ahead.||LMP|A little historical note. Passing over the Hadley Apennines sites from Apollo 15 we notice that at their landing point, there's the same slightly or distinctly brighter albedo area as there is at Taurus-Littrow site.||CC|You mean down on the plains of Taurus-Littrow, like where the LM landed? Or do you mean where you think the 114 impact was?||||Tape 130/6||||LMP|That's affirm. It - in spite of the - no, no, no, where the LM landed. In spite of the - As we walked along the surface, and this was true at Hadley also, you stirred up a darker zone, albedo-wise. When you look at it from orbit, the area around where the LM landed - it's a distinct bright spot on the surface of a - of a fairly uniform gray albedo plain» And both sites look just alike.||CC|Okay, we copy that.||LMP|In that regard, anyway.||CC|We copy that.||CC|And, America, you might be interested to know that the latest SPAN status report still lists all the LM ECS parameters as normal.||LMP|Beautiful. SPAN'S up to their old tricks again, I see.||CC|I guess it depends upon how you define normal.||LMP|Somebody must have spilled coffee on their console.|08 03 30 10|CDR|Listen, Bob, the way - the way it was performing, I wouldn't doubt it.|08 03 4l 15|CC|America, this is Houston.

I was just going to say we can also go to VERB 22 for the 2-1/2 degree dead band.|08 03 52 20|CC|Okay, and, America, another thing down here 196:47 there are the two comm callouts, the DSEA motion and setting the HIGH GAIN to MANUAL before LOS, and we'll want to catch those before you go around the back side. And ... - yes, as you around at LOS, and after that we're then ready for you guys to skip to 198 and the presleep sys -presleep checklist.||||Tape 130/8||||CMP|Okay, we can do that.||CC|Okay; and, America, if you have time, I have a few news items to read up to you here.||CMP|Go ahead, Bob.|08 03 53 30|CC|"Okay. Dateline Washington, the United States today threw its support behind the Christmas Peace package proposed by South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu, who accused North Vietnam of using high-pressure tactics in an attempt to impose an incomplete peace settlement. American representatives at the Paris peace talks, told the Communists it was futile for them to continue clamoring for the signature of the cease-fire agreement drafted in October by Kissinger and Le Due Tho. In Kansas City, the condition of former President Harry S. Truman weakened to, quote ""very serious"" Thursday. His doctor says vital signs are stable, but former President Truman was unable to speak; his lungs were filling with fluids still, and his kidneys have been impaired. In Mexico City, the International Federation of Airline Pilots, meeting in Mexico City this week, has promised a worldwide stoppage of all transportation industries if the governments do not take action to stop hijackings. In New York, the United States won an apparent victory in the United Nations when the General Assembly voted an approval of a cut in U.S. contributions to the world organization. Vote was 8l to 27, and reduces the U.S. budget assessment from 31*5 percent to 25 percent, starting in 1974. Here at home in Houston, the city council voted to locate the new proposed sports arena in the Greenway Plaza. The vote, however, stipulates that the Mayor find a way to finance it without using city tax funds. Council indicated that if the Mayor can't do this, the city will abandon plans for the 10-million-dollar, 18-thousand-seat facility. On the lighter side, in Jersey City, only one of 51 - that is one of 51 women who took physical exams for the police department, passed. Police Director Frederick Stevens said 24 of the women were too short, seven were underweight, and four did not have eyesight that could be corrected. In sports, the Alberta Oilers, that's Alberta and not Houston Oilers,"||||||Tape 130/9|||these are the hockey ones, skated past the Houston Aeros for a 3-to-2 victory here in Houston. And the Minnesota Vikings, in the city of Minneapolis, came to terms on a lease agreement to play their games in a proposed stadium up there in the north, or I guess it's building a stadium to keep it from being too cold, instead of being too muggy like it is down here. And that's the news; as you can see, it's a slow news day and things are still moving very slowly down here.|08 03 56 27|CDR|Thank you, Bob.|08 03 57 12|CDR|Bob, we realize it's - it's tomorrow down there but this still might be appropriate.||MS|(Singing: Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday, dear Bob, happy birthday to you)||CC|Well, all I can say, it might be appropriate, but it's not very musical.||MS|(Laughter)||CC|Thank you, guys.||CDR|Epic, Bob, epic.

Very good.||LMP|Who selected that song, Joe Allen?||CC|No, that's - that's Neil's special. You’ve got Neil Hutchinson to blame on that one.||CC|I must say he had a lot of accomplices on that, too, so -||LMP|Yes, Bob, I think maybe that's one of the best songs that's come out in the last 10 years, if you ask me.|08 13 06 15|CC|Roger.||LMP|But then, you didn't ask.||CMP|Hey, Houston; America.||CC|Go ahead.||CMP|I think mag QQ is all gone. Shall I use the RR?||CC|Hey, Ron, at 208 - -||CMP|... or something - -||CC|- - 05 there, we're going to delete that solar-corona pass anyway. I've got a Flight Plan update I'll give you at 208 there, and we're going to have to delete that solar-corona pass. 3o, forget it.||CMP|Okay.|08 13 09 15|CC|In case you guys are wondering, it looks like we finally might see the Sun down here in Houston. It is clearing off, except it's extremely cold. The temperature must be hovering right in the low 40's, or maybe even the high 30's, or even lower.||LMP|Well, my goodness. I should have been watching the weather for you, Bob. We'll come and warm things up for you before long.||||||Tape 137/3|08 13 09 45|CC|Roger.|||END OP TAPE||||||Tape 138/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|08 13 21 25|CC|America, Houston. We've got the Flight Plan update and a pan camera photo pad for the Flight Plan.||CMP|Okay, Houston. Stand by 1, here I've got my hands full of - *** PRD thing.||CC|Okay, the only thing we want to tell you is don't do the solar corona, and we've already told you that. We'11 get back with you later on that. If you want, I'11 read you the morning news.|08 13 22 16|CMP|Hey, okay. Go ahead.||CC|Okay, there's been a temporary halt to the peace talks in Paris, and, as we mentioned before, Henry Kissinger is in Washington and has conferred with President Nixon. A cease-fire proposal suggested by South Vietnamese government officials has been rejected by the U.S. White House News Secretary Ron Zeigler has declined to characterize the present Paris peace efforts, but say - did say there are still some obstacles to overcome. And we had another hijack attempt. A youthful Canadian, who hijacked an airliner in northern Canada was talked out of his escapade by his father. The youth had held 62 persons aboard the plane for a short while, then retained only four hostages for 10 hours. It appears that the United Mine Workers may have a new president. Maverick candidate Arnold Miller retained a strong lead over Tony Boyle in the government-supervised election. The transatlantic airfare price war that seems imminent, premises to be a real boon to the vacationer. It is now estimated that airfare may be as low as $136.00 for the transatlantic fare in some special categories. Juan Peron has ended his month-long visit to Argentina. An attempt was made to ncsninate him for the presidential election while he was there, but the move was declared illegal and he returned to Paraguay. A few other news highlights - the village of Rhonda, Switzerland, is threatened by a half-million-ton portion of a glacier moving down a mountain. Willie Brandt has been sworn in as Chancellor of West Germany for his second term.||||Tape 138/2|||||Former President Truman remains seriously ill. Chicago Mayor Daley has made an effort to halt further commercial development along Chicago's Lake Michigan waterfront. Comedian Bob Hope is set again for his annual tour of U.S. overseas military bases. His first Christmas show in the Far East is December 21. Now, in the local news, here, there's a good chance that Texans may soon legally put a bet down on a horse race. A state senate's studying - study committee has heard some heavy opposition to parimutuel betting in Austin, but the proposal appears to have a good chance of approval. And if you follow the Tomball police force, who quit in masses a couple of days ago - Tomball has rehired three of the officers who quit, and two more of the police who walked out are seeking to be rehired. And just a note here - there was a little beautification of Houston. Some of the thousands of billboards that line main highways around Houston will be coming down after the first of the year. All signs must be licensed by the state and a fee paid after that time. Some of the sports news: Johnny Bench, the Cincinnati Reds catcher who had a benign spot removed from a lung Monday, is recovering nicely at Christ Hospital in Cincinnati, The star baseball player will remain hospitalized for about 5 more days. Brad Van Pelt of the Michigan State University defensive star won the Maxwell Club trophy as the year's top college football player. The Washington Redskin's Larry Brown took top honors as the top professional player of the year. Southern Methodist has apparently chosen a new football coach to succeed Hayden Fry, but University officials say an announcement won't come until next week. Mark Spitz and Shane Gould, both top Olympic swimmers, were honored as top athletes in the world by European sports writers - for this past year, of course. There was no action last night in college basketball. The University of Houston is getting ready to play California tomorrow night. Joe Paterno, Penn State coach, has won the Walter Camp Football Foundation award as coach of the year. And it appears that Mike Tillamen of the Oilers may play out his option this year and this -Coach Bill Peterson says that it upsets his draft||||||Tape 138/3|||plans this coming year. And I've already updated the weather to you. I just might add a little parenthetical thought that it's really not that much in the news and all the news around here anyway has been Apollo 17 and your lift-off. We picked up the lift-off last night from the Moon and carried it live TV for about 2-1/2 minutes as you went out of sight like a star, and then, of course, live TV picked up your docking and - rendezvous and docking. A very spectacular picture, I might add, of the lunar surface as the Challenger came up to meet America. Over.|08 13 26 58|CDR|Very good news summary, Bob. Thank you. I didn't realize Tcmball had five policemen (laughter).||CC|America, Houston.||CC|America, this is Houston.||CDR|Go ahead.||CC|Hey, you can probably tell by the comm that this is Jerry. This is - the Gold Team has been handed over to the able hands of Neil. Before things go too far, I'll be around watching for the rest of the flight, of course, but before things got too far I wanted to pass my comments on to you guys that - boy, this has really been super. You guys have - between the performance of you guys and the performance of the hardware, it's been a piece of cake down here. I hope it's staying that same way up there, and we're really looking forward to finishing this thing up and getting you on back home. And my hat's off to you.||CDR|Okay, Jerry, I appreciate those words, but any performance of ours, and certainly that of the hardware, has to go all to the performance of you guys down there, because, you know, you are the guys that make it happen and we do appreciate it. And I guess this is sort of a semiretirement for you then, is that right?||CC|Well, I don't know whether to call it semiretirement It's - it's a relaxed feeling, I'll tell you that. But I'm anxious to do it again and hope I get a chance to do something more like this.||||Tape 138/4||||CDR|You bet you. We're all going to keep doing it; and, listen, you couldn't have left it in a more able set of hands than Neil's down there. We'll have to celebrate your 3-day or 4-day rest period when we get back.||CC|Roger. Talk to you later.||CDR|I didn't - I didn't realize we wore you out.|08 13 29 49|CC|I will throw one thing right quick, you know the activation descent day, that was the third one I had handled, and including all the simulations and all the three of the actual flights, I think it's the first time we can say that we really did it all right. For one reason or another, it really turned out to be a fairly easy day and I was really surprised.||CDR|Jerry, that spacecraft that we were working with was undoubtedly the best vehicle along with America that I've ever flown.||CC|Okay, well I'll be talking to you later.||CDR|Still ... babe.||LMP|Jerry, this is Jack. Thanks a lot, boy.||CC|You bet.|08 13 33 34|LMP|Okay, Houston; America. Would you like us to start charging battery Bravo?||CC|That's affirmed if you - if you're there, we'd like it.||LMP|I'm here.||CDR|Okay, Houston, we're going to do the pan camera; stand by.||LMP|Okay, say again, Geno.|08 13 34 27|CDR|Mode is STANDBY and Houston -|08 13 34 32|CDR|MARK. POWER -||||||Tape 138/5||CC|Roger.||CDR|And if you're curious V/H is HIGH ALTITUDE.||CC|Roger; copy that.||CMP|Okay, Houston; America here. I've got some medical logs and food.||CC|Okay. Stand by 1.||CC|Okay, go ahead. We're listening.|08 13 35 27|CMP|Okay, I'll start out with LMP medical log. PRD is packed down there with the suit; so, we'll have to get it later. He had 6 hours of good sleep. Took a Seconal. Fluids - he had lots of fluids - but they weren't logged. Okay, LMP's - okay day 10, I guess, meal Charlie. Had turkey and gravy, and I need to start writing - No. I had a citrus beverage, coffee, fruit cake, meatballs, lemon pudding and lemonade. Hey, Houston, instead of a turkey and gravy that was really a beef and gravy.||CC|Okay.||CMP|Okay, we'll go over the CMP. Meal A had bacon squared, scrambled eggs, orange juice, and coffee, vitamins; Meal B - need some light (laughter) meal B is chicken and rice soup, meatballs with sauce, butterscotch pudding, orange drink, carmel candy, apricot cereal cubes, brownies - I guess that was it. Meal Charlie, potato soup, beef and gravy, the ambrosia peaches there - about half of it - four brownies, and an orange drink. Okay, on the medical log: PRD is 15047 and I had about 6-1/2 hours of sleep in, oh, catnaps I guess -some of them were a couple hours long. And had two sniffs of nose drops on each side prior to going to sleep and five cans of fluid. Okay, for the Commander's menu - how did we get to day 10 -it was only day 9 yesterday wasn't it?||CC|Ron, excuse us. Would you have somebody turn the PAN CAMERA POWER to OFF, please?|08 13 39 42|CDR|MARK it. It's off.||||Tape 138/6||||CC|Roger; we'd like the IR COVER, CLOSED, and the UV COVER, CLOSED, at this time.||CDR|Okay. I'll improve, Ron.||CMP|Well, it takes a little training.||CDR|Takes a little training once you get back from the lunar surface.||CMP|Okay, Houston, UV COVER is CLOSED - and gray. IR COVER is CLOSED and gray.||CMP|Okay. Ready for the commander's menu, day 9» meal Charlie?||CMP|Houston, America. Are you all set to copy?||CC|Yes. We're ready to copy, Ron.||CMP|Hello, Houston. How do you read America?||CC|Read you loud and clear. We're ready to copy.||CMP|Okay, here we go. For the commander's day 9 meal Charlie, meatballs, butterscotch pudding, beef and gravy, orange-pineapple juice, citrus juice, chicken stew, apricots, and gingerbread. Okay, his medical log. He had 7 hours of very good sleep, no medication, and drank lots of fluids but nothing was logged on that part of it, and his PRD is also at his suit - down at the bottom of the suit bag so we ought to get it out here, shortly.||CC|Roger; copy.|08 13 42 33|LMP|Bob, in lieu of the solar corona photography, I watched - Gene and I both watched it set and there are two bands which I still can see now - a zodiacal light, I guess, going out symmetrically on either side of the plane in the ecliptic and they make an angle between themselves of about, let's say, 70 to 80 degrees. I can still - knowing they're there - I can still pick up the bands, streamers, I guess would be a better word. And last night when I watched one set, there was a strong linear||||||Tape 138/7|||streamer going out - oh, maybe 3 or 4 or 5 diameters -I'll have to get my directions straight. Well, I'll figure out which side of the ecliptic it was. That was not nearly so strong when I looked this time -now partly - that may be dark adaptation, I don't know, but I'll try to keep track of that one. But these two streamers today are about an equal strength and they're still visible as zodiacal light.||CC|Okay, Jack, we'd - quick break, we'd like the HIGH GAIN to AUTO and we'd like to get on with this Flight Plan update, please.|08 13 44 12|LMP|Okay, you've got AUTO.||CC|Okay, and this is a real-time Flight Plan change. This real time rigiht here, and right now if you'll go MAPPING CAMERA COVER, OPEN, and MAPPING CAMERA, EXTEND, and give us a mark, we'll time the extend time on it, please.||CDR|Okay, Bob, the MAPPING CAMERA COVER - Ready?||CC|Jack, will you go back to REACQ on the HIGH GAIN?||LMP|Okay, we're in REACQ.||CDR|||LMP|No, Gene, wait a minute.||CDR|Oh, okay.||CDR|No-no - okay, Bob. MAPPING CAMERA is going OPEN.|08 13 45 l4|CDR|MARK. And it's gray. And you want to extend the mapping camera, huh?||CC|AUTO on the HIGH GAIN, first of all.||LMP|Okay, that's what they said - they wanted. Okay, going to AUTO again.||CC|Okay - -||||Tape 138/8||||CDR|Houston, America. You say you're going to extend the mapping camera, now?||CC|That's affirmative, we're extending it early because we want to time it, and extend it now, please, and give us a mark when you start it.||CDR|Okay.|08 13 46 58|CDR|MARK it.||CC|Okay, and might as well finish up the Flight Plan updates if you don't mind. The next one is at 209:01.||LMP|Okay, go ahead; 209:01.||CC|"You're going to delete the ""MAPPING CAMERA/LASER ALTIMETER COVER, OPEN,"" and ""MAPPING CAMERA EXTEND,"" at that position, because you've just done it. Just scratch them out."||LMP|Okay, Bob. I got that.||CC|"Okay, and at 209:03, add - after ""PAN CAMERA POWER"" - add ""V/H OVERRIDE, HIGH ALTITUDE."""||LMP|Okay, I got that: V/H high alt at 209:03.||CC|That1s affirmative, and - -||CMP|Hey, Houston; America.||CC|Go ahead, Ron.||CMP|Okay, let me interrupt here a minute, Bob. Can we go ahead and dump with the mapping camera extended?||CC|That's affirmative, Ron.||CMP|Okay. Mighty fine. Thank you.||CC|"Okay, we'll just show a full extend at 209:40, Jack, in the Flight Plan where it says, ""Lift-off time update is not required."" At 209:40, we'll not do a lift-off time update."||||||Tape 138/9||LMP|209:40. You're not going to do a lift-off time update, huh?||CC|That's affirmative. And I've got a pan camera pad while you're on that page. The pan camera pad which is opposite 209:15 - 209:15*|08 13 48 21|LMP|209:15» pan camera photo pad. Go ahead.||CC|Okay, T-start, 209:14:44; T-stop, 209:27:36, and that covers all of it. We can settle back to the Flight Plan, now.||LMP|Okay, we - I will do that.||CC|Okay, sir, and if you'll give us ACCEPT, we've got a state vector at this time for you.|08 13 49 07|LMP|Okay, you have it.||CC|Okay, and, Ron, you may be interested, we had a nominal extend on the mapper.||CMP|(Laughter) Hey, great. I guess once - once the door stays out of the way, it'll come out all right, huh?|08 13 49 52|CC|Roger.||CC|America, Houston.||CMP|Go ahead.||CC|Okay, Ron. Just for - first of all - the computer is yours, you can go back to BLOCK. Just for your information, at the beginning of the next rev, we're going to have a Flight Plan update. Or actually, we'll have a pan camera pad at the beginning of the rev and then into the rev after the orbital science visuals, we'll have a Flight Plan update. What we're going to be doing is -we're going to be .doing an extra ultraviolet-scan program and we're going to do some antenna calibration on the HF - lunar sounder antenna so we get quite a lengthy Flight Plan update and, after that, it'll just be flying the Flight Plan. The thing with the lunar sounder is that we're getting a lot||||Tape 138/10|||||of noise from Earth that we don't see on the back side of the Moon in the HF and we'd like to calibrate this out.||LMP|Okay, you want to give us those updates now or are you going to - -||CC|Negative; we'll wait until next rev, they're not that extensive - we just have a number of them though. Just want you to be aware that they'll be coining up. They will not interrupt your orbital-science visual targets there at Mare Smythii or at the landing-site visual.|08 13 52 23|LMP|Okay.|08 13 57 42|CC|America, Houston. You're about 2 minutes from LOS here. We've got two items - the America is looking great and as you go around the horn there's no problems open on it. If you do - We would like the LMP - Jack, if you’d push on your EKG sensors a little bit - we're - the data isn't too good -the EKG sensors. And on your tank configuration, Ron, we'd like you to take H TANK 3 FANS to OFF and H2 TANK 2 FANS to ON.||CMP|Okay. TANK 3 is OFF. Number 2 is ON.||CC|Roger.||LMP|Okay, Bob. First - first break I have I'll change -have to change those sensors. I - I needed to put that salve on etnd I guess - that's probably the same problem as on the way out.||CC|Roger. Don't change them, Jack. The CMP is due to come on before too long so just press on them and see if we can improve the data a little bit but don't change them out. And you're looking great, and we'll pick you up again at 209:23*||LMP|Maybe that ratty data is me.||||||Tape 138/11|08 13 59 02|CC|No, no, it's not that way.|08 14 19 XX||BEGIN LUNAR REV 62|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 139/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|08 14 46 49|CMP|Okay, we've got you OMNI D. Somehow we got off attitude here -||CC|Okay, Ron, understand you're on OMNI D. You're coming up on 30 seconds away from PAN CAMERA T-stop time, and I have another pan camera pad I'd like to give you before we get into the orb science vi suals.||CMP|Okay. Geno will get the pad. ... 27 36 - 27 36, Jack.||CDR|Go ahead on the pad.||CC|Okay, the pan camera photo pad is at 209:30 -209:45 are you read for that one?||CDR|Standby - PAN CAMERA to STANDBY. Okay, pan camera is STANDBY.||CC|Roger, we got it.||CC|Okay, the PAN CAMERA photo pad T-start time: 209:49:04, T-stop time: 209:51:01* Over.||CDR|Okay I've got T-start of 49:04 and T-stop 51:01.||CC|Roger, and we'll hold off on the other pads until after your visuals, here.||CDR|I don't have much to do anyway, Bob. Why don't you go ahead.||CC|Rog, if you want, we're standing by to copy the visuals.||CDR|Okay. That's right ... Okay, we're coming across Mare Symthii. One of the - first things I'm concentrating on is the - slope of the - we're out of comm, it looks like. Got some high gain angles?|08 14 49 17|CC|Roger, trying to get one.||CMP|Okay.||CDR|Okay. Okay.||||Tape 139/2||||CC|Ron, if you'll do a standard REACQ for the HIGH GAIN pitch minus 10, yaw 25, we'd appreciate it.||CC|Sounds great.||CMP|How do you read, Bob.||CC|Loud and clear.||CMP|Okay, Houston, how do you hear? Okay.||CC|We'd like REACQ on the HIGH GAIN until we call AUTO, please.||CMP|Reacq in there. Okay.||CC|Ron, we're standing by.||CMP|Okay, Houston on the - the craters is to the north of the Wright Brothers. The slope of the walls is steep - probably 45 degrees on the inside - it's a gradual slope on the outside slipping away from the crater. There is no apparent albedo differences in the ejecta or patterned an-nulus around the crater itself and we're looking specifically at the one to the northwest of the Wright Brothers, now. There is a definite mare flow that is unindated [sic], and it's a different color and, you know, that you have a light albedo to it now, it's kind of a grayish tan. It's a light grayish tan material that has flowed - and I can't tell - it almost looks like it's flowed down to the crater. There is an impact crater right in the breach of the crater - which has nothing to do with the flow itself. The material in the - I'm almost out of sight of it already. I was going to say the material in the inner crater in these boulder ring structures down there - the material all the way in the center of it is comparable to the hummocky, bumpy looking type stuff that is not really the mare - not the smooth mare of Smythii - but the other part of the mare of Smythii.||CC|Are there any differences in the craters, Ron?||CMP|Yes, some of the craters, though, you can't see the boulder-ring structures on it. And some of them that are definitely impact craters, you know, that||||||Tape 139/3|||have the ejecta rings around them. I've got to study them a little bit more. This is really the first chance I've had to look at Smythii, on this pass, but I want to take a look at him a little bit more. Some of the boulder-ring basins there -the walls are not delta shaped at all. The one to the north and let's see, as you look to the Wright Brothers there's one directly north, and then the next one, and then the next one. The one directly north we'll say is 12 o'clock; the other one is 1 o'clock; and then a 2 o'clock crater. The 1—o'clock crater looks to me there is a high lava mark around the outer basin, the outer ring of the crater, itself. The one at 12 o'clock is the one I was talking about, has the breach on it with the later impact - the small impact crater on it. And without the binocs I couldn't tell flow direction, whether they were flowing into the boulder-ring basin from that mare patch on the outside or vice versa, so I'm going to try to check that out the next time around.||CC|Okay, Ron, we're standing by for any comments along your ground track here and we're following you. We would like to - when you get up on the landing site, we'd like you to concentrate on Stoney and F Cra - F Crater for those textural differences we noticed the other day.|08 14 54 57|CMP|Okay. Shorty. I think - right, I called the Stoney the other day too I think but -||CC|Yes, Shorty, I'm sorry. - -||CMP|The one out on the landslide.||CC|- - And we would like you to mark - Right. Will you mark - like you to mark the breach that you see on the photo, please. ' Or on the map.||CMP|Okay. That's - that's the breach on the - in Mare Smythii.||CC|That's affirm, Ron.||CC|And Ron, if you'll ask Gene or Jack or somebody to get your PAM CAMERA to MONO now, please.||||Tape 139/4||||CMP|Okay, PAN CAMERA1s going to MONO.||CMP|Okay, go -||SC|||CMP|Yes. I don't need any support, just a place to stick them. I got the binoc's.||CC|And Ron, we're still standing by for any calls you might want to make en route to the landing site, there.|08 14 57 22|CMP|Okay.||CMP|Well, again you can speak of test - or color differences on the thing. And the Sun angle now looking west - you get the same streaked - well, the verticle streaks that I talked about before that you see on the backside at the high Sun angle -higher Sun angles again. And that seems to show up more and more, I think, at the higher Sun angles. And these are the - what I call - radial -radial streaks down in the fresh craters that essentially start at the top of the crater rim and go down inside of them. If you take a look at these streaks, I don't - I don't see how they could be due strictly to the Sun angle on them, I think, because they're all the way around the crater.|08 14 58 39|CC|Roger, did you have a particular crater in mind along the - -||CMP|Yes. On the - Well, I'm trying to find the name of it right now. It doesn't make any difference which one it is. It's in all of the - all the craters, all of the valleys, and everything. It looks like the Sculptured Hills around the landing site.||CC|Roger. We understand that, Ron.||CC|Coming up on Apollonius. That area now is that correct?||CMP|Yes.||||||Tape 139/5||CC|Is there any significance or difference between the contact of Crisium to the Highlands or at Picard in that - or at the area where you're flying over in the Mare Tran - Fertility and, the Highlands right there in between. Is there any difference between these two contact points?|08 15 00 17|CMP|No, the Highlands look essentially the same as you - as you pass from Crisium on across to Fertility, and, again, they look so much like the Sculptured Hills, it's ridiculous, you know. It's all the high Sun - high Sun angle again. You got the streaks and the highs and there - there are masses of Highlands, though, on the border of Crisium here, though that - although they look like the Sculptured Hills, the sculpturing seems to be radially upslope and then downslope from the center of Crisium and just in small local areas of the Highlands.||CC|Roger, Roger. Do you see any radial Fra Mauro -like lineaments?||CMP|In that way, I think you can see ... the Sculptured Hills.||CC|- - Fra Mauro ...?||CMP|No, Bob. What I'm referring to is on the Highlands bordering Crisium, but in about all of them you do see a definite radial pattern upslope and downslope. From the center of Crisium, but none of the lineaments like you're talking about like at Fra Mauro.||CC|Roger, copy.||CMP|What kind of film we got? Oh, I got the wrong film in the mag. Right - Let's see, there's Yerkes, and then on the side of the slope, come Yerkes and then there's about a 50-kilometer crater, then there's a subdued crater, and right on the western rim of Crisium - in the western edge of that subdued crater, it's almost a 70-degree slope down there, and it's a square straight slope on the thing. There doesn't seem to be any ejecta piled up in the bottom of it at all, but within the slope - and it must be 50 - about - yes, 50 kilometers long, and||||Tape 139/6|||||there's a bright impact crater on the top of the hill, top of the rim, right below that bright crater, you have the tannish brown streak that goes through the whole slide. The rest of the slope itself is the bright, light - real light, light tan, I call it. I'll find the name of that crater on the map in a minute, but - -||CDR|I think the circumference of that crater right there ceases to be round - -||CMP|Yes.||CDR|- - It just is squared off with a linear break about oh - at least 20 percent of the circumference of the entire crater.||CC|Now, are you talking about a crater on the Mare of Crisium or are you talking about up near Proculus P in that area ... Hills?||CMP|Yes, it's right - no it's right on the mare. Okay. We got it. I think we got ... - -||CMP|A subdued crater right on the Mare of Crisium just below Yerkes. Jack, where's the -||LMP|...||CMP|Oh, the film? ...||CMP|Window 3 is going to - The landing site is going to be out of window 3. Let's see, about f - f/8 and 1/250.||CC|Very shortly you should be coming up on the mare prior to the landing site across Tranquillitatis and then to the landing site. Is that affirm?||CMP|Oh, yes, that's affirm, we should, I got Proculus at the window number 3 now.|08 15 04 54|CMP|Yes. Yes, the landing site really shows up - even from this distance right now. We're right over Proculus and looking off across down through the hills there, you have that definite dark - and now the albedo or the colored texture of the thing to me is turning more of a gray than a tan-gray.||||||Tape 139/7|||In the early parts of it, I thought it was a dark grayish tan, I guess, or something like that. Now it looks to me like it's more tan - I mean more gray, I'm sorry, more gray. It has essentially the same - -||CC|I think if you use the binoculars on the landing site - -||CMP|It has essentially the same - Ah, not yet.||CDR|Yes, this is Gene. I've got it on and the streaked albedo changed differences very definitely. One is the dark mantle on the floor. One is the South and North Massifs and the other is the Sculptured Hills. And the Sculptured Hills are at a light gray albedo between the Massif and the dark mantle. This line is very evident and there's a definite break in slope that you can see between the South Massif the, I won't call it the slide, but the white mantle is out on the valley floor. And from here, Shorty stands out like a sore thumb.||CC|Okay, we're interested in all three of you on that color texture difference up at Shorty and then we'd like to have a comparison of Shorty to F-crater if it is possible.||CMP|Okay, that crater is harder than a son of a buck to find. F-crater is right on Family Mountain, and there's one to the north of Family Mountain, a little ways there's a darker crater and then there's also one to the south of it. I can't find one on Family Mountain at all. I couldn't the other day so I'm going to see if I can find it today.||CDR|Bob, to me the Sculptured Hills incorporate the albedo, both of the North Massif, or the massif and the mantle area and combine them to give you a generally in-between gray albedo, but the sculpturing is produced by the darker albedo that looks like the mantle, and the lighter albedo that looks like the massif.|08 15 07 49|CC|Roger. And for Ron, the F crater is just to the south of Family Mountain. It's the one that you mentioned south of Family Mountain.||||Tape 139/8||||SC|||CMP|Ohhh, okay. That's the one I saw the other day. It looks about like Shorty.||CC|Is there a cone associated with that crater?||CDR|From here Bob, they're both very dark -||CC|Is there a color associated with that crater?||CMP|Have to check that just a second.||CC|Okay, and we're about 30 seconds from the T-start time on the pan camera, please.||CMP|Can't see that far. Stand by.||CMP|There is a definite bright spot up on the side of the hill - It's almost an extension of that slide area from Shorty.||CC|Okay, you guys, we're about 10 - -||CMP|See it?|08 15 08 52|CC|- - 10 seconds from T-start time on the pan camera.||CMP|Okay, Jack's getting the T-start. Okay I still get a -|08 15 09 03|CC|MARK. T-start time.||CMP|It's on.||CC|Go ahead, Ron.||CMP|Okay. On Shorty, I still have the - that light orangish-tan-type material - it's essentially perpendicular, to the line of the slide area there in the northern semicircle of the thing. I see F-crater. Boy, I can't hold these crazy glasses still enough.||CC|Okay, let me read you some questions about F-crater, if you will. If you'll direct your attention to F-crater. We'd like to know the shape of the crater profile, the rim crest, and probable or possible||||||Tape 139/9|||breaching, the smoothness and distribution of rim deposits, and the superposition-relationship with Family Mountain or Family Hill.||CMP|Okay. Get all of those. It is a - by golly, there is a raised rim to it. It's light color down inside the crater, though. And I can't hold the glasses close enough to see if it's breached or not.|08 15 10 35|CDR|Bob, I can't see it any more but let me add to it what I can remember real quick. The inside is white.||CMP|Yes.||CDR|The outside is rimmed with a - It's as if the rim itself, was just dark, very dark. There's some white to the south about a crater diameter, sort of a - small distribution radially to the south, and then there is a - sort of a, what I would call, a free-patterned dark-like ray about 2 crater diameters, maybe 3 crater diameters, to the south just slightly to the west of this light area I was talking about, but to the south, another definite one to the west and another definite one to the north, but none to the east.||CC|You just past pan camera T-stop time, guys. Jack, PAN CAMERA to STANDBY, please. Go on Gene, sorry to interrupt.||CMP|He's got it.||CC|Go ahead, go ahead with your description. We're listening.||CMP|I'm going to draw a picture, here, while I'm thinking of it.||CC|Okay, good show. Okay, guys, that completed the orbital science visual pass. Any other comments you'd want to make about the landing site.||CDR|Yes. It's an interesting place.||CC|No, not that. From a geological standpoint from orbit.||||Tape 139/10||||CDR|Yes. And I've got - well, my white spot, there, is ... the same spot. There are two white spots I'm talking about, now. The one I'm talking about primarily is the one I saw right after landing, on the thing was a lighter - lighter grayish area that was evidently blown up from the LM landing. And that's still in the same spot. You can still see that all right.|08 15 12 59|CC|We'd like PAN CAMERA POWER to OFF, now.|08 15 13 08|LMP|It's OFF.||CC|Okay, Ron, anytime you're ready now, I've got a -that whole series of Flight Plan updates and I've got a few words of explanation with each one-, so, maybe you might want to take these.||CMP|Okay.||CC|Okay, HIGH GAIN to AUTO.|08 15 13 40|CMP|HIGH GAIN'S in AUTO.||CC|I got one more question. How large Is the bright zone you were talking about, Ron?||CMP|Right between Sherlock and Camelot there are two small craters there and 1111 have to get my map out to look for the name of them fox- sure.||CC|Okay.||CMP|They should have been behind the LM - right behind the LM. And the bright spot is about the same size as those.||CC|Okay. - -||CMP|And it makes I would say an equilateral triangle with those two craters.||CC|"Okay, fine, I would recommend one of you go on to the ""configured camera"" while we start the Flight Plan update. We'd like to get the Flight Plan update all read prior to that P52 that you've got to do there, and somebody -will be taking those terminator photos."||||||Tape 139/H||CMP|Okay, soon as Gene - Gene's drawing in the flight plan, there. That crater - Okay, ready for a Flight Plan update.||CC|Okay. Who's going to take the terminator photos. You want me to give you call about 2 minutes before the photo time?||CMP|Yes. Jack will.||CC|Okay, well, here's the Flight Plan update, then. At 210:30 - 210:30, add the following - -||CMP|Okay.||CC|-- MAPPING CAMERA, OFF; wait 30 seconds; MAPPING CAMERA, STANDBY; IMAGE MOTION, OFF; LASER ALTIMETER, OFF; select POO, POO; VERB||CMP|0 k ay.||CC|- - 49 maneuver to UV scan attitude. The angles are as follows: 167, 125, 354. Over.||CMP|Okay. MAPPING CAMERA, OFF - this is at 210:30, MAPPING CAMERA, OFF. Wait 30 seconds. MAPPING CAMERA to STANDBY, IMAGE MOTION to OFF, LASER ALTIMETER, OFF. POO. V49 to UV scan attitude. Roll 1675 pitch 125, yaw 35^.||CC|Good call, Ron. The next one is at 210:35 and this is a P20 maneuver that's going to set up a rotation about the X-axis for a UV scan. Ready to copy?||CMP|Okay.||CC|P20, option 2, UV scan. NOUN JQ - -||CMP|Okay.||CC|- - NOUN 78 all zeros; 0, 0, and 0. NOUN 79: minus 0.4000, plus 000.50; NOUN 34: 00210, 00042, 019*00. Over.||CMP|Okay, P2— at 210:35 will be P10, uh, P20 for UV scan option 2. NOUN 78's are all zeros, KOUN 79 a minus 0.4 of a degree per second. Is that right?||||Tape 139/12||||CC|That's affirm.||CMP|Minus 0.4000.||CC|Okay.||CMP|Okay, then dead band is at 0.5 a half-degree. NOUN 34 is 210, 42, 19.00.||CC|That's affirmative, Ron. Okay, at 210:4l.||CMP|Okay, 210:4l.||CC|Add the line, the standard line, verify DSE tape motion, HIGH BIT RATE/RECORD/FORWARD/COMMAND RESET.|08 15 19 02|CMP|Okay, at 4l, verify tape motion, HIGH BIT RATE RECORD/FORWARD and COMMAND RESET.||CC|Roger. At 210:57, we've got another P20, Ron. And this P20 will set up the orb rate - -||CMP|Okay.||CC|- - minus sight on the horizon. Okay, here's the P20, option 5- NOUN 78, plus 162.01 - let me read that again, plus 162.01 - plus 040.?6, plus 184.78; NOUN 79, plus 000.50. And we're going to orb rate around the Moon, so NOUN 70 will have a 50 in it for the Moon.||CMP|Okay, at 57, it will be P20, option 5- Orb rate to minus sight on horizon; NOUN 78s are plus 162.01, plus 40.76, and plus 184.78; NOUN 79s are half a degree; and it'll be an orb rate around the Moon 50. Okay?||CC|Roger, Ron. Okay. Stand by.||CMP|Bob, while I'm standing by there, oh, that's all right. Must be my other map.||CC|Okay, Ron. We're ready with some more if you are.||CMP|Okay, go.||||||Tape 139/13||CC|Okay, at 211:02. Add the following at 211:02: UV cover CLOSED, and, in parentheses, put 211:02:09- Configure DSE - -||CMP|Okay, we're going to close - Oh - That's all right, go ahead.||CC|Configure DSE STOP/COMMAND RESET. Select POO. Manual roll left to a roll angle 039 by 211:05-Over.||CMP|Okay. UV cover CLOSED at 211:02:09- Configure the DSE STOP/COMMAND RESET. Whip her into POO and manually roll left to 039 by 211 plus 05-||CC|Roger. And just the prediction from the simulator, you might want to use ACCEL command for a rate of about 1 degree per second to accomplish that. And that - The purpose of that is to get the Sun out of the mapping camera.||CMP|Okay. Can do, ACCEL command to 1 degree per second.||CC|Okay, at 211:08.||CMP|Just a second, ...||CC|Roger.||CMP|Hey, Jack on here it shows the little circles on the map, which part should be taken for each, rev 2 or whatever it is.||CC|We're in rev 62.||CMP|Except for some reason, on my map D it doesn't have - Yes - on map Delta. I must have got the backup map or something, I didn't have any of the photo - the camera settings on it. (Laughter) Terminator photos -||CC|Ron, we can break from this now, we're pretty well ahead, and ve can come back to it, if you want to do the photos.||||Tape 139/14|||08 15 24 02|CMP|Hey, yes. Do you have the - Do you have the options, there, on the La Hire Rille? And Mount La Hire - which - what the photo settings are.||CC|Roger, I've got them, and I can read them - I'll read them to you right off the mop [sic] - map.||CMP|Okay.||CC|Okay, if you're looking right at the map - -||CMP|Okay, I see them.||CC|- - draw - draw a circle around La Hire Bravo. And that is f/32 - -||CMP|Oh, I've got the circle on it.||CC|- - 1/500.||CMP|Yes. f/32, 1/500. Okay, start with that one, Jack.||CC|Got the circle around Mount La Hire? It's f/ll.||CMP|250-millimeter lens - f/ll, okay.||CC|At the next circle up, which crosses - which encompasses the La of La Hire Rilles, you want f/8 at 1/250.||CMP|Okay.||CC|And the one that crosses - the circle that covers across the terminator there at Diophantus is f/5*6 at 1/125, 1/125* Get the wrong - -||CMP|Okay, we got them all, Bob. Thank you.||CC|Okay, just a question for some other period. Will we have to update your map for P66 and P?4 revs?||CMP|Yes. I don't have anything on this map.||CC|Okay, we'll schedule that in prior to those revs, Ron.||||||Tape 139/15||CMP|Yes. Okay.||CMP|Okay, we're coming up on Timocharis, now. Start at Lambert and get the - right along the La Hire Rille, see - Yes. Take six - six - six shots you know, kind of each area at that - You know, north and south. Yes, you know point them every which way, or whatever's interesting on the thing. Okay.||CMP|Okay. Mount La Hire, you can get in there at f/ll at 1/500.||CC|Hey, Ron. Just - Just a point. -||SC|There's Euler coming up there. Okay, go ahead, Bob.||CC|"Do you have two copies of the maps on board? And if so, did the - would the other copy of ""D"" have the updates on it? Or have the settings?"|08 15 27 47|CMP|Have 2 copies? I didn't know we had two copies. Okay, and then next to Euler, we've got f/8 at 1/250 - north of Euler, There's - well we're just - Okay, we're just about at the - on the terminator line. Yes. No, f/8 at - at 1/250* Okay. Yes, north and south along the terminator. You're getting close to it. Then, change to - right on the terminator - change to f/5-6 at 1/125- I was wondering when you guys were going to say that. (Laught er) Okay.||CMP|(Laughter) Yes, that'll be a good one. I'll tell you, it goes a lot easier when you're by yourself.||CMP|Okay, yes, we're on mag 55* I mean frame 55 ana mag Romeo Romeo.||CMP|Yes, we didn't get some of the ones up around La Hire. We'll get those next time around.||CC|How's the pictures going, Ron?||CMP|Okay, we got - The pictures are over. And that's Lunar Orbit Chart Delta. It doesn't have anything on it, you know - -||CC|Okay, we111 - -||||Tape 139/16||||CMP|- - It's the circles on it, but it doesn't have any of the - -||CC|We'll - We'll schedule it up - all the fli - all the updates on that. After you go LOS we'll figure out some convenient time to read them up to you on there, Ron. I've got a - I've got the Flight Plan - -||CMP|Okay, and we're ready to continue the Flight Plan.||CC|Okay. 211:08, 211:08.||CMP|Okay. We're all set.||CC|Ron, just one comment before we start the Flight Plan. You've got a 52 coming up and we want to make sure that gets done prior to the VERB 49 maneuver at 210:30. And there is no slack on that VERB 49 maneuver at 210:30. So you'll have to get on to the 52 at about 20, but we should have enough time to get the rest of these updates up.||CMP|Okay.||CC|Okay, Ron, at 211:08 delete the lines: Mapping camera - OFF, wait 30 seconds, mapping camera -STANDBY, image motion - OFF, and laser altimeter -OFF. Delete those lines.||CMP|Okay, they're deleted.||CC|Okay, at 211:11, change the RECEIVE ONLY ATTITUDE to the following: roll, 039, pitch 159 j yaw 300.||CMP|Okay at 211:11, VERB 49 will be to 039, 159, and 300.|08 15 31 52|CC|Okay. At 211:26 we're going to do a P20 maneuver. It's going to be a rolling P20 which will roll about the OMNI Bravo line-of-sight to the Earth. We'll need high bit rate during that time. That's why we need the - line of Bravo. And we're doing the Earth study of - with the - with the lunar sounder to determine the polarization of the noise from the Earth so we can subtract it out of our data. And during these maneuvers, you're going||||||Tape 139/17|||to see a middle gimbal angle of plus or minus 65 degrees. We saw that on the - on the simulator, but a word of caution on that. You'll see a middle gimbal angle of plus or minus 65 degrees.||CC|The P20 maneuver is as follows: at 211:26, P20 option - -||CMP|Okay.||CC|- - P20 option 2, HF scan, NOUN 78, plus 270.00, minus 039-30; NOUN 79 j minus 0.3000, plus 000.50; NOUN 34 is all zeros.||CMP|Hold it there, Bob.||CC|Okay, Roger.||CMP|Let me get - I got your NOUN, - I got fouled up in the NOUN 78s. Option, I'm going to need two of those, so it's NOUN 78 is plus 270.00 and a minus 039*30. Okay, your NOUN 79's now are - are say again.||CC|Minus 0.3000. And now for other NOUN 39 - -||CMP|Okay, 0.3 of a degree per second.||CC|Rog, and 0.5, 0.5 - half a degree dead band.||CMP|Okay.||CC|And, NOUN 34s are all zeros.||CMP|Okay, so you're going to PRO at 211:26 then, right.||CC|That's affirmative.||CMP|Okay.||CC|Okay, Ron, this next one - actually we're calling it 212:20, but the simulator came out at 212:18:40, just for information. And it's the following: Stop scan at roll 039*||CMP|Okay. Stop scan at roll 039-||||Tape 139/18||||CC|Rog. VERB 49 maneuver to lunar sounder RECEIVE ONLY attitude. Roll l42, pitch 286, yaw zero.||CMP|Okay. VERB 49, lunar sounder RECEIVE ONLY, roll 142, pitch 286, yaw zero.||CC|Okay, and then the last one is 213:03. Configure the DSE high bit rate RECORD/FORWARD/COMMAND RESET.||CMP|Okay. At 213 - was that 03?||CC|03, that's affirm.||CMP|Configure DSE high bit rate RECORD/FORWARD/COMMAND. Okay.||CC|Okay -||CMP|For the high bit rate, RECORD/FORWARD/COMMAND RESET.||CC|Ron, we'll be - No more Flight Plan updates we promise today and we'll be working - -||CMP|(Laughter)||CC|- - map Delta and getting that updated to you, but everybody here thinks there's two maps on board and I think you're right. I think there's only one, isn't there.|08 15 36 52|CMP|Oh really. Is that so?||CC|FAO thinks there are two - -||CMP|- - Oh, wait a minute. Jack said they put an extra one - Okay, well, there were two. Jack just said he had one put on for him.||CC|Okay.||CMP|I must have picked his up or something.||CC|Roger.||CMP|Mine must be in there then, somewhere. We'll look for it.||||||Tape 139/19||CC|Okay, if you'll check that and tell us if we need to update you. We'll still plan to update, but if you've got it, fine.||CMP|Okay.||CC|And it looks like you ought to be getting in your P52 when you get a chance here.||CMP|Yes, I'll get her down here. (Humming) Can't tell about these geologists. They put on extra maps in your spacecraft and things like that, you know. Yes, I get - I gave'you the last frame number on that Romeo Romeo, but I think I forgot to tell you the one after the - the other one. Oh, by the way, on the other one, Agassiz was completely in the darkness and there was no crater rim at all to shine down on Agassiz so we didn't get him at all.||CC|We copy that.||CMP|Oh, are we in P20? Go to FREE. We use to be in 20 - P20 - We'll get back into P20. Not much, but that's all right.||CMP|They go right along here. I have them right along here and shove them down over there is what they used to do with them. They haven't called. Get into AUTO now, CMC AUTO.|08 15 39 30|CMP|Okay, are we at - that's going and everything. Okay, go CMC FREE now. Okay. That's my fault, Gene, I should have gotten it. (Laughter) That's right - number 12 Rigel. Hey, I can find Rigel I bet you. There she comes. There's Orion. Man, oh man, I've done P52 only, and it's within the -within a half of a crosshair width. Come on, Alphard. Ah, ha! There's Alphard - for rev 62. Come on in there, baby. Well, up to my usual tricks (laughter). Ah, 12 and 21 - stars 12 and 21.

We copied them down.||||Tape 139/20||||CMP|Okay, and we'll torque them at 22:45-||CC|We copy.||CMP|Okay.|08 15 42 56|CMP|Okay. Give us the AUTO now.||CMP|Okay.||CMP|Okay, just a second, Gene, let me look at it. See resolve - Power is OFF. Do the old optics? Yes. I think - (Laughter) Outstanding idea - having a great drink. (Laughter) Okay, 24. Done that. Doesn't matter. Okay.||CMP|Houston, America.||CC|Say - say again.||CMP|Okay. Hey, Bob, how many frames of mag RR do we have to diddle with? Kind of our own, or are there any?||CC|That's in work right now.||CMP|Okay. Aha, here's another chart D.||CC|I do owe you a consumables status yet, and - -||CMP|Who knows - It's got all stuff in it. Hey, do we - we have a good chart Delta.||CC|Okay. Good. Great. I owe you a consumables status, and when you woke up, you were right on the Flight Plan line, and you had 53 percent remaining of RCS. And, all other consumables are on the line or above.||CMP|Okay.||LMP|Hey, Bob. Sorry we didn't let you get that in. We're not moving too fast for you, are we? (Laughter)||CC|Ron, you have zero spares on RR. No - no film available for yourself on RR.||||||Tape 139/21||CMP|Oh, okay. We'll - -||LMP|Hey - hey, Bob, this is Jack. If you could possibly swing it, I would strongly recommend that we let Ron redo that last terminator sequence if we can work it in the Flight Plan, because Gene and I may or may not have done what you wanted there, and I know we missed the first couple of them.||CMP|I'll - I'll use the 35-nillinieter. I still got about 8 or 10 frames on the 35 - -||CC|Okay, we'll take that word under advisement, and we'll evaluate it.||CMP|(Laughter)||LMP|Thank you.

Here are some settings you might use for terminator photographs over mare. Use T2.8, 1/500, and infinity. For terminator over highlands, use T4, 1/500, and infinity. And for Tsiolkovsky on rev 74 that's GET of 232:58; that's sometime in the future here - we're suggesting using T5.6, 1/500, and infinity. Over.|08 16 50 23|LMP|Okay, Gordo, what was the f-stop for the highlands terminator?||CC|Okay, the highlands terminator would be 1'4. I guess that's the far-side terminator, and the nearside terminator is over mare. That's the mare setting.||LMP|Okay.|08 16 53 19|LMP|Hello, Houston; America, Is today Friday down there?||CC|America, Houston. I'm sorry. Say again, please.||LMP|Just wondering, Gordo, if today is Friday.||CC|That's affirmative. It's Friday.||||Tape 140/4||||LMP|Okay, thank you.|08 16 53 50|CC|Happens to be pay day. It's the 15th.||CC|Jack, Houston. We see no need for you to wear any of your biomed sensors; if you'd rather take them off, give your skin a rest, feel free.|08 16 58 49|LMP|Okay, Gordy. I've done that. And I'11 wait till my next time and put them on then.||CC|Okay.|08 17 01 36|LMP|Gordy, how do you read LMP?||CC|You're loud and clear, Jack.||LMP|While we're in a relatively quiet period, we're going to make a few comments about some of the things that cross the two big basins that we're getting very familiar with - or, actually, three: Smythii, Ori - Smythii, Crisium, and Serenitatis -and the degradation of the balls of the major ring and the lack of any obvious blanket structures, I think, in contrast to Imbrium and Orientale , which we've also had a pretty good look at -Orientale and Earthshine, on the earlier revs -is quite striking - that contrast is quite striking -    to me, at any rate. Also, within Orientale, the -    at least at the southeast - on the east-southeast portions of the mare floor, the wrinkle-ridge system is not nearly as well developed; but there is a wrinkle-ridge system that roughly forms an inner floor ring, at any rate.||CC|Roger.||LMP|The fronts of the major ring in Crisium are strikingly different than those of the Apennines just in their general slopes; sharpness of topographical features; and in any appearance of having even a hint of boulder fields on their slopes like we observed, say, on the South Massif, anything like that. At least Serenitatis massifs seem to locally show fairly major boulder fields on their flanks. And I haven't seen any around Crisl'uin yet. Maybe||||||Tape 140/5|||Ron's already talked to you about that, but I haven't seen any.||CC|Okay.||LMP|Yes. The craters now. I'm speaking of the, Ron, of the front faces themselves, the rim - the face of the ring itself.||CMP|Oh, I see. The face of the ring itself - okay; that's what you're talking about.||LMP|Yes, yes. Wo it - a crater - a fresh crater in the mare or a fresh crater in the blanket area -rim area - will have boulders, Gordy; don't misunderstand me. But the front faces - the ring front face does not have boulders - that I can see. And I think boulders are pretty obvious when they're there. We've seen them well defined on the central peaks of Tsiolkovsky, and I think any time you have a major boulder popu - field, you can see it with the monocular - with the 10-power monocular.||CC|Roger.|08 17 05 28|LMP|Getting into areas that resemble, in their surface texture, the Sculptured Hills of the Taurus-Littrow landing area, here we're just passing - Now where are we? - that would be (laughter) I got disoriented all of the sudden. Proclus is there, so it''s in the ray-excluded zone of Proclus where there is a mare surface projecting up into terrain that looks like Sculptured Hills. And that mare has a distinct bluish-gray color, in contrast to the regolith associated with the Sculptured Hills -between the Hills at least - which is a brown -let's call it a tannish gray. Quite a sharp color hue contrast to my eyes, at any rate.||CC|Soger.|08 17 06 55|LMP|Okay. That was a projection of Fecunditatis Mare, I guess, up into there. Sculptured Hills tend to have both a regional distribution and a||||Tape 140/6|||||structurally controlled distribution, the structurally - structural control being apparently related to the rims of - of old craters. For example, there are some Sculptured-Hills-appearing topographic materials that - again, in the ray-excluded zone, but out in Fecunditatis - we: find the rim of a fairly large flooded crater - in Fecunditatis. And all of this may tie in with the possible -possibility that we saw at the landing site, that Sculptured Hills are composed of an igneous gab-broic rock. And these may represent local intrusions controlled by the structure of an old impact crater - extrusions controlled by the structure of the old impact crater.||CC|Roger.||LMP|I've noticed - now I'm getting a good view of where in Fecunditatis there is a tannish - or let's call it more of a brownish-gray mare in contrast to bluish-gray mare in Fecunditatis itself.||CC|Roger.||LMP|And in the walls of some - of a large crater -I'll try to figure out which one it is in a minute. It's near the large crater that the Sculptured Hills define you can see in the east wall - or maybe northeast wall of that crater - an area of bluish-gray - material that is streaking the normal tan-gray of that crater wall.||CC|Roger.||CC|This is a kind of one-sided discussion. I wish I was there so I could take a more active part.|08 17 10 12|LMP|That's all right. I just thought I'd fill in a few things. This isn't a good viewing attitude at all, and we get a few isolated views that may be worth commenting on. The contrast, in my eye anyway, between the three color units around the landing site is a - let's call it a medium bluish gray to gray for the dark mantle; a light blue-gray||||||Tape 140/7|||for the annulus around Serenitatis; and, then, a tan-gray for the Serenitatis Mare proper. And, in Dawes, you can see - I think you can see that the overturned - or the - the rim materials are made up of the brownish-gray material, and the walls underneath those rims are the bluish-gray, which is the age relationship suggested by topography. That'd be the over - lower unit is forming the rim with inverted stratigraphy.||CC|Roger.||LMP|The light blue-gray annulus is also the locus of most of the circumferential grabens, that Serenitatis is noted for, is in that area. And that's nothing new. But, in one place, there's a very subdued, flooded crater which seems to control a -a - arcuate projection - or, let's say, a circular projection - of the light blue-gray out over the tan-gray mare. Most of the major wrinkle-ridge system of Serenitatis, of course, is outside the annulus of blue-gray, except locally, and one of those places was in the - to the west of the Taurus-Littrow site. Although that wrinkle-ridge system does - I can see now, as we look south of Seren -in the southern portions of Serenitatis that wrinkle-ridge system does cross the contact between the blue-gray and the tan-gray. That's the light blue-gray and the tan-gray.||CC|Okay.|08 17 13 15|LMP|The impression I've had in looking at all the mare where the wrinkle-ridge systems are developed is that they're a late feature. They - at least at low Sun, and sometimes even at high Sun - they have a very - very sharply defined ridges with steep slopes on either side that seem - that, in general, give me the impression that they're constructional, possibly associated with some thrusting movement.||LMP|In the vicinity of Sulpicius Gallus, there are several small craters that look like impact craters that, believe it or not, have - in my eye, anyway -orange ejecta blankets.||||Tape 140/8||||CC|Roger.||LMP|Yes. Ron says that he - that he already commented on those, and they're - and they look very obvious to me. No, I - I don't - no. I don't think you can with those windows. We'll get a good view of them again in one of the other attitudes.||LMP|It's a light orange, obviously, not a - that it but it's in contrast to the brown-gray of the dark mantle in the vicinity of Sulpicius Gallus. There's a good one right down there. Row, that one looks like a constructional cone that's orangish. And that's right out on a raised projection of the -of the brown-gray dark mantle out onto the - out onto the light blue-gray annulus material.|08 17 16 06|LMP|This southern and southwestern portion of Serenitatis has a general appearance of the Sculptured Hills, although the individual hills seem to be more widely spaced than around Taurus-Littrow. Once again, historically, we're passing over the landing site of Apollo - or near the landing site of Apollo 15.||LMP|Tell Dave Scott that the north complex looks just as interesting as it ever didj It's going to remain with Emory crater as one of the unknowns of the space program for a while, I guess.||CC|Roger.||CDR|Hey, Gordo, I've been looking at the landing site off and on the last few revs, and I'd like to get -now that we've been there and back - your best guess of the exact position of what you think we landed, because I think I've got it pinpointed pretty much so from here.||CC|Okay. Stand by 1.||LMP|This is one of the first opportunities that I've had to look closely at Archimedes, which is one of those craters that, in the early days of the lunar||||||Tape 140/9|||mapping program, helped establish some of the fundamental age relationships between the various units that were visible in the Earth-based photography. In this particular case, it related to the sequence of events that created Imbrium, cratered it, and then flooded it with mare. And Archimedes is a completely circular - closed circle as a crater, and it is filled with mare. And it, in itself, is superimposed on the - one of the main benches of the Imbrium crater. Now, to have mare filling that crater and actually filling all the depressions of approximately the same level in the vicinity of a mare - of a large mare region, it's one of the things that's suggested to many people that rather than single sources for mare lavas, you have a multitude of sources in a very fractured lunar crust. The ultimate source in depth, though, is still certainly a subject for controversy.|08 17 20 37|LMP|Some of the ridge and valley structure of the Archimedes impact blanket is not covered by mare and extends to the southeast out onto the Imbrium bench. That was also one of the pieces of evidence used in those early days of photogeologic mapping of the Moon. You'll have to excuse the reminiscing, Gordy.||CC|Roger.||CMP|And, Houston; America. Frame 150 - 151 and 152 were taken of the Sulpicius Gallus region with a 250 lens. 154 was taken at D-Caldera, and that's magazine Oscar Oscar.||CC|Okay, Ron.|08 17 23 01|LMP|Gordy, I guess it was the crater Bessel in Serenitatis that Ron and I were looking at last night. And I think he had commented on being layers in the ledges that were visible in the walls, and I certainly concur with that. Although we could not trace layers - individual layers from ledge to ledge, within a coherent ledge the layers were traceable; and, in one case, I'm sure 1 could count six or seven ledges - sub - well, layers within single ledges. Reason it reminded ne of it is looking at Timocharis, and 1 cannot do that||||Tape 140/10|||||with Timocharis. It looks like it's - those ledges - any ledges that may have been present as a result of the Imbrium Mare have since disappeared by weathering. That's lunar weathering, of course. Of course, down here in the Imbrivm - southern Imbrium - is one of the better regions of the Moon to observe the wrinkle-ridge systems or mare ridges, sometimes they're called. And it's purely that. They're fairly sharply defined - quite sharply defined ridges that are wrinkled in their pattern -sinuous would be another term. And with sharply defined slopes on either side of the ridge. Sometimes they are flat-top ridges; sometimes they are more like spines. And occasionally you see them that almost appear to have vertical slopes on one wall or the other. The whole impression that I have, anyway, is that they - there may be a combination of structure and folding of the surface of the mare - Construction on the surface and folding of that surface. They're particularly interesting that they tend to - wherever there has apparently been an old sub - flooded crater -Yea, did you want to get that stuff? They seem to be controlled by the shape of flooded old craters within the Imbrium basin. And I think that's a safe conclusion, because you get the standard outlines shown by the rille - the ridges; excuse me. Some of them are polygonal, and some of them are quite circular.|08 17 26 25|LMP|Ron, did you want to get these ridges, these rilles south of Euler here?||CMP|Yes.||LMP|Okay. They're coining up.||CC|America, Houston.||LMP|Go ahead.||CC|Okay. I guess the last team promised you no changes to the Flight Plan, but they didn't say anything about changes to the changes; and I've got one. At 15 minutes from now, 212:20 - -||||||Tape 140/11||CDR|Can you stand by a minute?||CC|- - in the Flight Plan. Might get that out, and I'll give you a change.||CMP|Keep talking, Gordo.||CC|Okay. At 212:20, you're to stop the roll at 39 degrees and then do a VERB 49 to 142. And we want to change the PITCH to 268 and zero. That would be 142, 268, and zero.||CDR|Okay. I got that change. And you want that about 18 - 212:18?||CC|I - have to check back here. Yes, I guess that's when it is.||CDR|Okay.||CC|Also, as long as you've got the book and a pencil, let me give you a few other one liners.||CDR|Yes, I'm ready to copy them.||CC|"Okay. Let's see. The first one is at 214:55-And they want to add after that other stuff just above there ""UV COVER OPEN"" and ""IR COVER OPEN."""||CDR|Okay. At 2l4:55s you want UV and IR COVERs OPEN.|08 17 28 27|CC|Roger. Turn the page. At 215:37> - 215:37> change magazine November November to Kilo Kilo.||CDR|Okay.||CC|And the reason I'm so slow with an answer on that landing site position is, all I've got it in is latitude and longitude; and I assume that you want it in good coordinates, for your reference. One suggestion here was, you tell us, and then we'll confirm your guess. I just ran across an other couple updates, too. Back to 213:15 in the Flight Plan, I can give you the lunar sounder pads - the two of them on that page.||CDR|Okay. I'll get them. Go ahead.||||Tape 140/12||||CC|Okay. T-start on the left-hand one there, is 213:20:10, and T-stop is 213:24:20. Then the next one is T-start of 213:4l:40, and a T-stop of 213:59:54. Over.||CDR|Okay, Gordo, got them all. They're all at 213 hours. Start is 20:10; stop, 24:20. Start is 4l:40, and stop is 59:54.||CC|Okay. Good readback.|08 17 30 19|CDR|"And, Gordo, I guess my best guess after looking down there from here is - I've got a - the northeast chart of the lunar surface traverse ... And about 84 point - correction, about 83.3 and about and Delta ... point 5. We're right on the top of the ""o11 in Poppy. Looks to be about where we landed."||CC|Okay. We got that.||CDR|And, in thinking back about what my intentions were, that looks like probably a very reasonable -reasonable suggestion. And the first thought I had about being close to Trident, I didn't think I was anywhere near that close. And, of course, when you look out there and see a big hole, you don't know how big is big when you're down there. That big hole out there might very easily could have been Poppy out at 9 o'clock.||CC|Okay, Geno, from science we finally got it to where it converted to your map coordinates; and their guess was close. Their best guess, with all the data considered, is 83.2 and DN 0.1 - Delta November 0.1.||LMP|That would definitely make sense, Geno ... - -||CMP|That's pretty close to where the old CMP said it the first rev after landing, isn't it?||LMP|- - north of where we put the ... Remember, that was a little ways away. You were at the edge of the depression, and-it would - move it a little.||||||Tape 140/13|08 17 32 11|CDR|Yes, I'll buy that. That's in my scatter. And then that crater, as I looked out at 9 o'clock, we landed next to was actually Poppy. Pretty sure that's that large crater.||CC|Okay.||CMP|And, Houston; America. On mag Yankee Yankee used frames 31 through 35 at that last near-side terminator there.||CC|Okay, Ron. Got that.|08 17 35 22|CDR|Gordo, I'm just going to stop this maneuver this time around at 39 degrees.||CC|Okay, Gene. Say, we've got one question for Ron. We've got large teams of engineers trying to locate the missing scissors, and we haven't asked you in a while whether you might have found them. That might save them a lot of effort down here.||CMP|No, I haven't found them yet. And there's a lot of room underneath these CO^ absorbers I found out the other night because I lost my flashlight. But it kind of floated out, and I saw it every once in a while. And we found the flashlight and got it back, but I still haven't the slightest idea where the scissors are.||CDR|Gordo, you might have someone hide them in the CSM and send a backup crew down to the Cape and see how long it takes them to find them.||CC|Okay. 1*11 get an airplane scheduled up right away.||CDR|I just missed 39 degrees. I'll wait for it next time around.||LMP|By the way, Gordy, you working on next week's airplane schedule?||CC|Yes , what do you need? You mean the one from Hawaii back or something like that?||||Tape 140/14||||LMP|Yes, you might have some 38s waiting for us in LA; we can pick them up there.||CC|Okay; but we'll have to work a three-way swap with some Skylab troops that will be out there. And then Deke will meet you in Albuquerque halfway back; and I'll let you know how it all works out.|08 17 37 09|LMP|That sounds great. That sounds like easier than usual.|08 17 43 29|CDR|Every commander has the right to change his mind.||CDR|And, Gordy, I'll watch the cranapple.|08 17 44 13|CC|Okay, Geno.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape l4l/i||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|08 17 48 52|CC|America, Houston. We're starting to get to the margin on signal strength to get the data back. We want you to improve that by turning ? S-Band MODE, - S-Band NORMAL MODE VOICE switch to OFF, center, for about 5 minutes.||LMP|Say again.||CC|Okay, Jack. We'd like you to turn the S-BAND NORMAL MODE VOICE switch to OFF, center, for about 5 minutes to improve our signal margin as you approach the termin - the LOS here.|08 1? 49 32|LMP|Okay. OFF, center, for 5 minutes.|08 17 54 09|CC|America, Houston. Don't bother to answer, but we'd like tank 2 FANS-0FF. That's hydrogen|||tank 2 FANS, OFF.||CC|America, Houston. We'd like OMNI Bravo. America, Houston. We'd like OMNI Bravo.||CC|America, Houston, you can turn the voice back on now. Have about a minute and a half to LOS for a final goodbye.||CMP|Okay. This is America with a goodbye for this pass.||CC|Okay. I guess the real reason for having you turn the voice switch off there is so the secretaries that are transcribing the air-to-ground here can catch up with Jack.|03 IT 56 26|LMP|(Laughter) I don't believe it. Yes 3 I do. Oit^y. That's all you ever hear from me again.|08 18 17 XX||BEGIN LUNAR RBV 64|08 18 42 06|CC|Yes.||||Tape l4l/2||||LMP|Hey, Ron, do you want me?||CMP|That's right. There are a lot of those with a flat floor. Got to be a lava-type thing down there.||CMP|Houston, America.||CC|Roger, America. Hello once again. You've got about 1 minute to T-stop.||CDR|Okay. We're right with you, Gordy.||CMP|Okay. T-stop isn't it - -||CDR|... 24:20, Ron.||CMP|24:20?||CDR|... operation STANDBY.||CMP|Standby. Okay.||CMP|Okay. We're coming up on 24:20. The visual of Tsiolkovsky is hopefully pretty much recorded on the recorder.||CC|Roger.||CMP|18, 19.|08 18 44 23|CMP|MARK it - STANDBY. ... in standby. I guess the somewhat - a very small summary, anyhow, of the visual of Tsiolkovsky concentrating primarily or. the flow up in the northeast corner. To me, that particular piece that's fallen down ir. the crater there - and it's on one of the pictures -Tsiolkovsky, 4 or 5. The piece that is down in the crater is on the right-hand side of the page. And that portion, you know, is somewhat of a molten state. It looks like it is a landslide that has slid down the wall of the crater and detached from the - well, the molten state cf material, rough - rough-looking material that1s on the rin of the crater Tsiolkovsky.||||||Tape l4l/3||CC|Roger, Ron.||CMP|There seems to be high lava marks around the western and northern sides of the central peak.. For some reason, it's not evident or visible on the south side of the central peak.||CC|Okay.|08 18 46 21|CMP|Also, there seems to be the high lava marks on the raised portion of the floor in the contact between the dark material on the floor and the lighter, - oh, rough-looking ... - on the northern side of the crater. In the first observation, of the mass of material that goes out into the crater Fermi, the - It looks like there is a whole bunch of craters in there that have - or are essentially rimless craters. However, on close examination with the binocs, I couldn't see any that didn't have at least a slight indication of a rim. The rims that were on them were essentially very subdued. They extended out to about - oh, a half a crater diameter; and these are on the craters in the 500 - to 1000-meter size. I didn't get a chance to look at them, looking straight down the craters, to see if there was any depressions or any domes or any type of a structure in the bottom of craters. But I get the impression that they're - primarily all look - just of cones with no flat bottoms at all. And I'll look again at those things when we go by there next time. The flow that goes down into Waterman - if we look at the pictures, Tsiolkovsky 5 of 5 - the shadow is just about in the same area on this one as it is on that one, and I didn't take a chance to look in that one until I got to the west of it. So I'll have to look* when I'm passing it from the north side of Tsiolkovsky looking south, to see what's down in the shadow area there. But when you're on. the west looking back across it, you can't see into the shadow. But the material that's in the floor of the crater Waterman is the same type of material that the little flow on the northeast corner has broken off and slid down into its own little crater.||||Tape l4l/4||||CC|Okay. Roger that.|08 18 49 24|CMP|So I guess what I'm saying is that essentially whatever molten material that's up around on the rim of the crater Tsiolkovsky has been - well, I want to say extruded - not extruded but pushed out, I guess, away from the crater end has been in a semiliquid or semi-molten state in its period of deposition. I'll reserve judgement on some of the flat-floored, flat-mare filled depressions that are around the crater until I get a chance to look at those the next time around.||CC|Okay.|08 18 50 50|CDR|Say, Gordy, something that struck me, - something maybe everyone else has thought about, but I hadn't before. At the southeast corner of Smythii, there was a relatively large - several large somewhat subdued craters but with relatively steep sides to them. And next to this one was a very small, white, bright-haloed crater. And I watched the rays of this crater; and the southeastern rays draped over the slopes of this much larger subdued crater - draped over the walls, all the way down onto the floor. And as they draped over the walls, they obviously gave me a very good albedo change from the darker wall to the very much lighter colored. But as they hit the floor of the crater, they form patterns that are not only not unlike, but actually very, very similar, to the light-mantled area that we have been referring to as a possible slide back at Taurus-Littrow. The patterns as they drape down the inner slopes of the crater and onto the floor, I would be willing to bet if we went down there we'd probably find the same type of things we found at Taurus-Littrow.||CC|Okay.||CDR|By that I mean albedo changes that we can see hurt versus to what we can see down there.||CC|Roger. Very interesting.||CDR|I looked for these type of - looked for -chase type of ray patterns, where the rays just vent ou~ or.||||||Tape l4l/5|||a more horizontal plane. You. can - you can find them if you look hard, but as they drape over the slopes arid onto the more level floor, they're very obviously alike.||CC|Roger.||CMP|Hey, Houston.||CC|Go ahead.||CMP|Okay. That crater, if you look at Smythii 1 of 1, and the crater that's right above the rev 62 there, you can see a bright spot on the northwest portion there. And that's the breach zone of that particular crater. The thing that's intriguing about that to me is that if you look at the inner ring, it's a gradual slope from the center - the center of the crater is lower than the secondary -the secondary ring around the thing.||CC|Ron, let me interrupt here. Say the name of the crater you're looking at again in Smythii.||CMP|Okay, in Smythii. And - Mare Smythii, 1 of 1, that - that picture - -||CC|Roger. I - have got it.||CMP|And right about where it says rev 62. Okay?||CC|Okay; gotcha.|08 18 54 21|CMP|Now, there's two - there's two rings in that picture. Okay. The inner ring, the central portion of that thing, is lower and slopes outward, -radially outward - to the first ring. And then it drops off; in other words, it's a gradual slope, maybe - oh, somewhere in the 15 to 2C degree slope upward to the first ring. And then it's a steep slope on the outside of the ring, at about, - oh, 45 degrees, dropping down into the annulus.||CC|Okay.||||Tape l4l/6|||08 18 55 21|CMP|Yes, color? With 250 lens. Yes, all along. I just took it today, two of them, - three of them. Yes. Yes. Yes. I took three of them the last rev.||LMP|Gordy, this is the LMP. While we're waiting for the site to come up again here, which seems to interest us every time we go over it, I think we sort of came to a general concensus on the problem of the smaller cone-shaped craters on the far side that have the little pool-like concentrations of material in the bottom. If you look at the freshest of those craters, the - that seems to be contiguous with the streaks of very dark material that cover the walls and the rim of the fresh cone-shaped craters. As the crater gets older, that material - that distinction becomes less obvious; however, the pool remains, and all you lose is the dark streaks on the rim and on the walls of the crater. I think we sort of feel -suspect that that pool in the bottom of the fresh craters is just the concentrated impact melt that - some of which is - stayed there during the impact and other which drained back - that drained back after the impact from the - drained from the walls. And then, with time, that pool may be subdued some. The structures in it, the swirls and little domes in that pool are subdued possibly not only by the impact but by debris, slides, and avalanches off the walls of the crater.||CC|Okay, Jack.||LMP|It's getting to be a very consistent pattern when you start piecing several of them together.||CC|Roger.|08 18 58 49|LMP|That black streaking on the walls and the blankets, - Ron may have already told you, but it is characteristic of only the very freshest of those cone-shaped craters, - and - or pool craters, whichever you want to call them. And it seems to be very logical that it just represents a thin veneer on the rim and the walls of the impact-generated||||||Tape 141/7|||glass. And it's darkest, presumably, where it's quenched; and the pool itself is somewhat lighter gray than the black, streaks and mantles.||CC|Roger.||CMP|You know, Jack, I get the impression that these bright ones, - see the bright one right down there in front of us there, - if you look at those with the binocs or with the - I get the impression of a dark greenish-black or blackish-green. In other words, I get a green - -||LMP|Green cast to the rocks?||CMP|Yes, green cast to the rocks. To the big blocks, you know, that are laying around there - around the crater and also the ones that are down - down in the bottom.||SC|Greenish cast.||CMP|That greenish cast to them.||CMP|Yes, it is; isn't it. I can see that with the naked eye. That's a bright one. What's - I'm saying, where is the crater, though? Oh, that's the - that's Yerkes and - okay. You're in VOX.|08 19 00 54|LMP|Hey, Gordy, we got another orange-rimmed crater. And we'll spot it. I think everybody agreed. And this one very clearly looks like an impact crater that has it's - let's see, we decided you're looking north?||CMP|Yes.||CC|Roger.||LMP|It's north, east, and west quadrants - -||CMP|Let me describe it. It's Yerkes and ...||CC|Hey, you got; the T-start time coming up here shortly on the sounder.||||Tape 1^+1/8||||CMP|Okay (laughter).||CC|About 10 seconds.||LMP|Quit interrupting. Okay. We'll get i~,.||CMP|What time is it?||LMP|We'll hack it up here, Gordy.||CMP|VERB 4l ...||LMP|Thanks, Gordy.||CC|... now.||CMP|Okay.|08 19 01 13|LMP|Sounder is OPERATE.||CC|That was close.||CMP|(Laughter)||CDR|That was a very good call. Thank you.||CMP|Thank you.||LMP|No sweat. At any rate, in the north, east and west quadrants of that little crater - and we'll spot it for you on the map, is a - very clearly an orange pattern - an orange color to the ejecta. The other quadrant is a lighter color - a ligiu, gray.||CC|Okay.||CMP|"If I had a map - . Let's see, what did I do wi-ch rsy map? Wait a minute; I got a picture of ""chat, I think."||LMP|Right here.||CMP|Ivo, go ahead I can't see the landing si^ea £r.ylicw, ^- exon, t tn.i.nk.||||||Tape l4l/9|08 19 03 43|LMP|Gordy, my impression from Shorty the other day, and also from seeing these craters that seem to have orange - that are - around them, that look very much like impact craters from orbit, at any rate - it may be that the - if that is an alteration phenomenon, - that it's being localized around the structure created by the impact. But in this latter case, it looks as if the impact itself penetrated into a zone of that color.||CC|Okay, J ack.||CMP|(Laughter) yes.|08 19 05 35|CMP|Are we going to use your -||CMP|Here, take it - take a look at it. Okay.||CMP|Doesn't show up that way today.||CMP|Here. The color -||CMP|I know. That's the spot.||CMP|Yes.|08 19 08 19|CMP|Can't see it anymore.||CMP|Yes. That's a good view...|08 19 10 19|CMP|They're between Tacquet and Mel-Mel-Melanes [sic], aren't they? Yes. I see them ... Okay. Yes, little bitty ones. They're about - on, a little bit bigger than Shorty. Yes. Those are - those are the ones that I called the other day. It was a very, very light tan. I guess you can put an orange tint to them.||LMP|Gordy, to put orange into perspective, at least as far as the LMPs eyes are concerned - from orbit, I would say that it's a orange-gray. It‘s still a gray, with an orange hue to it. And when I use any blue or tan or anything, it:s a hue or. gray; and I'll usually try to say gray in there. But to say something's orange, I think, would be misleading. It's really an orange-gray9,but it's clearly a distinct hue.||||Tape 141/10||||CC|Okay. Kind of like dirty beach sand with a little orange in it, huh?||LMP|Well, we can't use that term anymore. That's copyrighted.||CC|Roger.||CMP|Yes. That's right. There is. That's the one. That's the area where I was trying to talk about. That's just north of, - oh, that's Sulpicius Gallus. No, there's a gouge, just - yes, northwest of Sulpicius Gallus Crater. Yes, bet I didn't doubt - I didn't talk about that thing. That's a - I thought - I was talking about the little orange crater. Now you can see all the colors down - down in the gouge itself.||LMP|Hey, Ron. We'll spot this one on the map, too -or Gordy. But there's a large gouge just south of the Sulpicius Gallus ridge. The gouge, -it's a rimless depression - and streaming down from the upper portion of that depression are not only our old friend the orange-grays, but some would be a red-brown gray. Very, very clear coloration in this light, in, - I think, - My goodness. There's another crater we'll have to look, at.||CMP|Yes. There's a whole bunch of them down there.|08 19 14 45|LMP|Yes, but that's something in the wall of it in that area. Yes, it's starting - (chuckle) Man, we're seeing an orange Moon now. This - this whole dark mantle in here around Sulpicius Gallus, - they are - they are scattered craters with variety of orange to red-brown hues. And they all, except for that large rimless depression, which looked, - looked as if was exposing some layers which were streaming those color, - that color debris down its walls - All the other craters seem to be small impacts that apparently are penetrating just far enough into the dark mantle material to tap this zone of orange to red-brown material.||||||Tape l4l/ll|08 19 15 44|CMP|And just north of that elongate depression, there is another circular crater. And it also is penetrating down though this mantle stuff. And it had the reds and the browns and oranges dipping down it, too.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 142/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND TRANSCRIPTION|08 19 16 06|CDR|Hey, Gordy, just so you're fully aware, we're not sort of just leaning and getting color blind up here, I tell you, last one Jack was talking about was not even subtle. It's entire ray pattern was this same color material, and definite contact between it and the dark material around it, and it had that orange-brown hue to it, without any question at all.||CC|Okay. Very interesting.||CDR|It really is. You know I saw that dirt day before yesterday at Littrow, but, and I really haven't seen too much from orbit that I'd call really very distinct in color, until this one. But, boy, there's no question about this one.||CC|Roger.||CDR|And ve pick up the lunar sounder at 59=54.||CC|Okay, I'll try to watch it a little and give you a little more warning, too.||CMP|Yes, I want to get - I think it's right in that ...||CMP|Let me see.||CMP|No, here's the Sulpicius Gallus. No, you're up too far, you're up too far. It's closer to Sulpicius Gallus. Right in that ridge basin, right In there on the red line.||CMP|And, we'll get a picture of it.||CMP|Yes.||CMP|Yes .||CMP|Okay. Sorry, Houston, we turned that one OFF at the - minute early.||CC|Okay.||||Tape 142/2||||CMP|We'll pick up an extra minute on the next one.||CC|Roger.|08 19 20 01|LMP|Okay, Houston. RECORDER'S going OFF.||CC|Okay.||CDR|Hey, Gordo. I better make this note now. What Jack and Ron were talking about apparently was an elongated depression. I was talking about in the same area, and I'm trying to mark it approximately on the chart. But it was a classic, small, bright-haloed crater. The classic with a classic ejecta and everything. Except it was this orange-hued crater. It was not bright-white. But it was very classic. And, as I said earlier, not subtle at all.|08 19 20 47|CC|Roger, Gene.||CC|America, Houston. I have a TEI for rev 72 pad. No hurry, maybe you want to wait until sunset.||CMP|Yes, we'll wait until sunset.

I'm looking ahead -I'm trying to stay ahead and see what's happening today and tomorrow in the Flight Plan. And although this has come up in the past, we haven't said anything about it. You know, Ron put his biomed harness||||||Tape 142/3|||on a couple of hours ago, and he's going to end up wearing it a total of 6 hours. Then, all of a sudden, when we make a change-over again, and I put it on and - for a 12-hour period, and then we change again. And one of the problems up here is putting these things on, and you'd like not to leave them on too long, but once you get them on, you like to make use of them. And it's a problem, it's time consuming. I'd like you to consider down there letting Ron wear those until tomorrow morning, having me change over then. And when EVA time comes, we'll take special consideration to whatever requirements there are.||CC|Hey, you just got a thumbs-up on that from the Surgeon.|08 19 28 27|CDR|Okay, very good thank you.||CMP|Okay, Houston. Just took whatever the three were before 39 on mag Yankee Yankee of Euler, Tobias Mayer, terminator stuff.||CC|Okay, Ron. And for Jack, the Surgeon says he's getting occasional erratic trace from Jack's biomed. He would be happy if Jack wants to take it clear off.||LMP|Gordy, I don't know how to tell you this, but I haven't had my biomed on for about 6 hours.||CC|Okay.||LMP|As a matter of fact, I haven't even had the sensors on.|||Well, we must be copying the heartbeat of the America or something, then.||LMP|Mow does it look.

Say, have a little summary of - both the surface and the orbital scientific equipment's working. It's probably about 5 mlmutes worth. If there's some handy time, I'll be glad to read it to you.||LMP|Right now, Gordo. We'd love to hear it.|08 19 38 35|CC|Okay. Let me start with the America's gear there. The - on the UV spectrometer, well, actually having to do with UV. During - back during rev 38, they sent an Aerobee sounding rocket fror* White Sands, up, and it carried a UV spectrometer above the atmosphere and successfully acquired solar UV calibration data. Farside terminator shows there is a hydrogen atmosphere, but it is much less than had been predicted. The PI is very happy with the mode 4 maneuver. On the IR scanning radiometer, it's still performing beautifully, and the PI Is getting lots of high-quality data, and I understand is ecstatic about it. On rev 33, the crater Kepler C showed up as a 132-degree Kelvin anomaly on a 94 degree Kelvin background after 11.6 days of lunar night, the crater Reiner was a similar anomaly on that revolution. In low orbit on rev 95 Kepler A showed a broad hotspot corresponding to its ejecta blanket with a sharp spike corresponding to the crater in the center. One coldspot anomaly seems to correspond to a cinder cone-like feature in Mare Orientale near the crater Hohmann. On the lunar sounder, telemetry monitoring of the sounder's average reflected power indicates that the mare and highlands exhibit markedly different reflectivity, both HF and VHF.||||Tape 142/6|||||The data is consistent with distinct layering in the mare, as would be expected, where the mare flooded by successive layers of lava, although, they say other explanations are possible. They don't see that layering - indication in the highlands. Predicted topographic signatures over features such as craters and mare ridges have been confirmed in principal. Of course, as you know, until they get the film back they don't have - they can't really reach any definite conclusions . On the cameras - the cameras, both cameras and the laser altimeter all appear to be performing very well. And everybody's especially happy with the solid laser altimeter performance. Okay, that kind of sums up SIM bay. Do you have any questions, that I could chase down, or should I go on with surface stuff?||CDR|No, why don't you press on.||CMP|That sounds good Gordo, press on.|OB 19 4l 46|CC|Okay. On the surface, the heat flow. These are -these are little short summaries, each written by the Pis or co-Is (sic) on each experiment. Mark reports that the entire heat flow system is working perfectly. The probes have cooled down to a temperature of -16 degrees C at a depth of 2.3 meters, and are nearly at their final temperature. for comparison, at Hadley Rille, we found a -20 degree C at 1.5 meters depth, we had - to refresh your memory was minus 16 at 2.3* Both probes show an increase of temperature with depth, and it is clear that we will get a valid heat flow measurement. The LEAM is functioning properly, responding to calibration, and sensors shew a low noise figure. The LEAM will be off until lunar afternoon, and on, with sensors coverea, until after sunset. Otto Berg ask that you accept his thanks and appreciation. On the LSG, the sensor beam cannot be nulled at this* time, in spite of Jack's efforts. We are still studying the problem and hope to find a workaround. In any case, the instrument does function to some extent, as a vertical seismometer, and may be useful in a search for a gravitational raaiatior from pulsars. The LSPE is fully operational, L>.||||||Tape 142/7|||"ascent clearly recorded on all four geophones. And apparent seismic velocity measured across the geophone array was 100 meters-per-second. Rego-lith velocity was very close to that measure at the Apollo 16 site. The LM impact was clearly recorded on the geophones, and the estimated distance was 10 kilometers away, in the South Missif, actually very close to the targeted point. Although, I guess you've discussed this, ve didn't see it on the video. The first charge vent off while you were on the backside, last re^, and it's very apparent on the tracers which I'm monitoring right now. I think the next one's due sometime within the next 2 hours. Okay, the lunar mass spectrometer — the low voltage circuits of the LMS have been operated briefly. All monitors indicate the proper performance of the instuments, but application of high voltages will await lunar sunset, when both the analyzer and the site has had time to outgas. Temperature of the radiator plate is slightly above nominal, but not so high as to be even important. That was from Dick Hodges. Okay, here's a little summary from Dave Strangway on the SEP. He starts out by saying, ""Water, -water everywhere and plenty to be found,"" because you didn't get behind the time line. The SEP transmitter was confirmed to be working well at the correct power level, using the lunar sounder. The receiver heated well above predictions during the whole mission, as I'm sure you are aware, but the two prime data legs were operated within the temperature limits of the recorder, and we have no reason to doubt that we got good data. There is also a good chance that the legs on station 4 to the LM was within the temperature limits. Your procedures were performed excellently and we look forward to processing the DSEA tape. Okay, now to - let's see, we got TGE, which is considered a spectacular success. The Earth-Moon gravity transfer Indicates the valve of - won't read the numbers, in miiligals - at the - at the Tarrus-littrow base. But the value will be used to obtain a revised value for the lunar radius at this landing site."||||Tape j.42/8|||08 19 45 58|CC|Gravity measurement made during the three EVAs showed a large negative anomaly of about minus 38 milligals at the base of the South Massif. A similar negative anomaly of about minus 30 at the base of the North Massif. Preliminary conclusions of the traverse gravimeter meas - TGE measurements indicate that the material under the valley floor of Tarrus-Littrow is much denser than that of the Worth and South Massif. The gravity values will support the hypothesis that the valley subfloor consist of dense basaltic rocks, perhaps as much as 3 or 4 kilometers in thirikness. The extra measurement between stations 2 and 3 will be of great help in determining the nature of the boundaries of this basaltic layer and the varied extension of the massif. The cosmic ray detector -actually, you know as much as we do about the data return from it, of course, but the - we did - recover it earlier in EVA 3, as you remember, and that was due to a minor increase in low-energy solar protons and heavier particles detected here. And a reduced exposure will not offset the scientific results.|08 19 47 21|CC|The neutron probe was exposed to the surface for 49 hours. PI estimates that the distance from the RTG to the probe is 40 meters, which will mean that the background count will be low, and he thanks you kindly for those few extra steps. And the last one was - to be summarized - was the field geology and they asked for a very short summary, so Walt Berger came through with three typewritten pages. So, we're just going to skip the whole thing, except the last line, which was to say that you guys did an outstanding job. Over.||LMP|"Thank you Gordy. We're just pleased that so ""any things are working well, and happy that the Pis are satisfied. That was our objective, and ve came up here to meet it - and those things that are done, I hope we met it, well - and we've get a few more things to do yet."||CC|Well, I can assure you you're not the only or.ci, that are pleased.||||||Tape 142/9||CDR|Gordy - Gordy, and you know it's satisfying to have put that much time in and - and come out with some meaningful results. That makes us all feel good. Have you been able, or did you see that first charge on the video?||CC|I forgot to mention that. No, we sure didn't see a thing. We had the camera aimed over there, but it was almost a kilometer away. That was 1-pound charge, and we played it back several times, but nobody saw a hint of anything.||CDR|Okay. If you got - if you got a few more going off here in short order don't you?||CC|That's affirmative. I don't think we're up to the next one yet, but we'll keep - keep you posted on whether we see anything, or how they're doing.||CDR|I might also say that we appreciate the time and effort the Pis put in with their experiments and with us also.||CC|Okay. I'll make sure that gets to the backroom.||LMP|Gordy, this is Jack. What did they see over next to the Sculptured Hills on the gravimeter?||CC|Well let's see, Jack. They kind of - let me turn back here. They actually included - when they mentioned the negative anomaly of minus 30 milli-gals at the base of the North Massif. They said stations 6 and 8, parenthetically there. So evidently they're Including the whole area there as the negative anomaly. I'll try to get a more amplified answer to your question.||LMP|Now, could you see if you can verify with them that they were unable to - or there was no distinction between the measurements of the Sculptured Hills and the North Massif?||CC|Yes. I'll - I'll work on that.||||Tape 142/10|||08 19 51 33|LMP|Or better yet, what was the distinction between the Sculptured Hills and the subfloor area?||CC|Okay.||CC|You may have to wait until next time around for your answer.||LMP|Oh, there's no hurry. You can wait until tomorrow or even a (laughter) week if you want to. I was just thinking about that problem.||CC|Okay.||LMP|By the way, Gordy, you might tell Bob Walker, if he's around, that the cosmic ray, as far as I know, was untouched by human hands, at least on the Moon. And it looked very very clean when I put it in the - put it back together.||CC|Okay, Jack. We'll pass that along.||CC|America, Houston. One more question from the Surgeon on this mysterious trace on the LMPs biomed. Do you have anything plugged in to the -is the biomed still plugged in and laying over on Jack's umbilical, or is there, is there anything plugged in to - to Jack's that could explain the funny trace here? It's kind of a sporadic-looking - looks like somebody with a heart in a pretty bad shape. (Laughter) Over,||LMP|Gordy, my heart has always been in bad shape, for other reasons than the one the Surgeon's thinking about. It turns out that I am still plugged together. I just don't have the sensors on. I will remedy that situation, so he doesn't have to worry anymore.||CC|Okay, that solves the mistery. Thank you.||CC|Say, Anerica, about 30 seconds to LOS. See you next time.||||||Tape 142/11|08 19 54 40|CDR|Okay, Gordy.

Do you read Houston?||CMP|Houston, America.||CC|Yes, America, loud and clear.||CMP|Okay, Houston. America here. The mapper - when we took the image motion from OFF to ON and then the MAPPING CAMERA switch from OFF to ON also, I think - maybe it was STANDBY to ON - but anyhow, as soon as it went up to ON, we had a barberpole on the talkback. Went back to STANDBY, and just before AOS, or just about AOS there, at - to 215 -20, about 215:20, then we got a gray on the talkback with the MAPPING CAMERA switch to STANDBY. Then we went back through the cycle, and it worked okay. So it's working now and it's ON. What I'm saying is I didn't start working until about 20.||CC|Okay, Ron. We got that.||CMP|Must have been too cold, huh?||CC|We'll look at it now.||CC|America, would you select WIDE on the HIC-H GAIN and then NARROW?|08 20 43 54|CMP|Doesn't seem to make any difference.

Add to that little discussion of the pool-bottomed, cone-shaped craters that I had, I think, the last rev, that the one place there seems to be some variety in the freshest of those kinds of craters as in Mare Smythii where - the ejecta blanket of many of those kind of craters has some small dark halo craters - -|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 143/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|08 20 48 32|CC|Roger.||LMP|They're superimposed on the bright ray or ejecta blanket and/or ejecta blanket system of the - of those cone, or fresh cone craters.||CC|Okay.|08 20 49 4l|CC|America, Houston. We've got some words for you to - a request for a little visual observation at the landing site area, having to do with orange material. If you're ready for about a 5-minute briefing, I'd like to give it to you now, so you can get set up.||CMP|Okay; go ahead there, Gordo.||CC|Okay, what we want to do is see if - This was triggered off by your observation of orange material last rev, I guess, and possibly earlier. But the idea here is to look for some craters that we’ve identified on photographs that are in similar geologic setting to Shorty Crater and see if we can see orange material around them. We're trying to determine if the orange material at Shorty Is a one-time special occasion or whether possibly it's common to the area and just never been noticed before. And we think you'll be able to determine this visually, better than any other way. So, if you can get out the orbit - the orbit charts; the orbit photographs; let's see, the Lunar Landmark Maps for the CSM, and turn to the landing site number 2 or 4 picture. Let me know when you get that, and I'll show you where we think a likely point is to see craters that are similar in setting to Shorty, to look for orange material.|08 20 51 31|LMP|"Okay, Gordy, we'll do that. I've made a couple passes with the binoculars over the dark mantle around Littrow already, and have seen nothing comparable with what's around Sulpicius; but let's have ""Che examples, and we'll make a special effort on it."||||Tape 143/2||||CC|Okay.

Okay. Okay, we got her.||CC|Okay. You can see the landing site there at -down about 4 o'clock, and the 7-kilometer crater in the - on the centerline of the page, about a third of the way down from the top, the large bright crater there is - is Littrow B is the name of it.||CDR|Got it.||CC|And on the southern half of the ejeeta blanket from that crater, they're several dark halo craters, which we think are in similar structure as Shorty. We think that would be a likely spot to look for orange material. There's a - Farouk has circled about four or five. They show up, say, at 4 o'clock, 7 o'clock, 8 o'clock, and 9 o'clock out about - from the center - about a crater diameter. In other words, a crater radius beyond the lip, roughly. We suggest that you utilize the best window in your attitude which you should be maneuvering to now, if you - if I haven't completely interrupted the Flight Plan. Is - at that attitude, window - let's see - 1 is the best, and 4 should point up that way also. We suggest you get somebody on the binoculars at 1. And use the same cai-iera setup, with the exception of using tbs 250-millimeter lens, if you can, that you're going to be setting up for as per the Flight Plan for the orbital science photos. If you can put the 250 on there; use ICC as shown; and f/8, 1/250, and infinity - I'11 repeat that when you get to it - for the pictures, if you see anything. What we're looking for is orange material.||||||Tape 143/3|08 20 55 03|LMP|Okay, Gordy. We're working on that now, and we'll get KK out.||CC|Okay. We were thinking you might be able to get the guy on the camera in window 4 and the binoculars in window 1.|08 20 55 35|LMP|We're coming up on the edge of Crisium now.||CC|Roger.||LMP|Okay. I think maybe you're right about window 4 possibly being the photography window. If I can get oriented right. I thought you - No, There you go. Yes. It's all set, right here. And, Gordy, I'm going to try to also shoot, if you'll let me, two pictures on KK of that depression -colorful depression we saw near Sulpicius Gallus, if I can see it. Is that okay?||CC|Okay. I'll give you a unilateral GO on those two frames, and we suggest you use two or three frames on this area we've been talking about, also, in addition to the scheduled 28.||LMP|Okay.||CC|If we get short of film or something, Farouk says the last part of this orbital science photos, after you get to the end of the run and change to 1/125 of a second, is kind of marginal for photography anyway.||CMP|(Laughter) Right,||LMP|Okay, Gordy, you want the pictures whether we think we see orange or not, huh?||CC|That's affirmative.||LMP|That's very strange. May have to pass you the camera in a hurry, Geno. I looked.||||Tape 143/4|||08 20 58 00|LMP|You know, Gordy, the craters we're seeing around Sulpicius that are orange or - orangish are very clearly orange - orangish gray and the whole, or at least most of the crater is that way. We looked at Shorty today, and Ron said that even the little bit of orange that he saw the other day is not visible, and I'd have to agree with that. The amount of orange we saw on the surface certainly would not be comparable to what we're seeing around Sulpicius Gallus.||CC|Roger.||LMP|And in a couple of quick scans, on previous revs, of the area, the dark mantle, near Littrow, I could not - I did not notice any obvious orange-gray craters.|08 20 58 57|CC|Okay.||CC|Just to make - to be sure we're clear on this: We suggest that area to look for them only as a likely spot; but any evidence of craters with orange material, in the whole dark-mantle area around Littrow and the edge of Tranquillity there, is worth noting and getting a picture of, if you see it.|08 20 59 44|LMP|Okay. Yes.|08 21 05 58|CMP|I don't think there's anything there.||LMP|Why don't you take a couple of pictures, then.||CMP|Wait a sec. Yes, I've got a few.||CDR|Can you take a picture?||CMP|Yes.||CDR|Did he take a picture ...?||CMP|Okay. 5-6 at 1/250, huh?||CMP|So, I don't either. I don't see anything comparable at all. You know, the ones that we've been seeing the - definite orange or the light-tan stuff around are pure light ejecta blankets around them, not dark.||||||Tape 143/5||LMP|Houston, I guess none of us see anything comparable to what is down by Sulpicius.||CC|Okay.||LMP|And no obvious color either.||CC|Roger.||CMP|Well, they're comparable to Shorty, but they're not comparable to - they're not comparable to the ones that we've been seeing the obvious orange - -||CDR|Yes. The craters are comparable to Shorty, as Ron points out, and - but the color is not there.|08 21 07 44|CC|Okay. We'd like to give you a couple of spacecraft chores - like to terminate the charge on battery B, and turn tank 1 FANs , ON.||LMP|Hand me the camera.|08 21 08 04|LMP|H^ tank 1 FANs going ON, and I'll get that charge in just a second.||CC|Okay. And just a reminder to go back to f/4 - -||CMP|Are you going to be able to get that?||CC|- - at 1/250 when you get ready for the orbital science photos. Also, the 80-millimeter lens, if you happen to be - have the 250 on there.||CDR|What's the setting for the ...?||LMP|Oh, f/8.||CMP|Well, we're getting a little close to the terminator. Change to 5.6, Jack, I don't know. No, maybe not.||LMP|We're looking down zero phase.||CMP|'That's right. It's almost zero phase, okay. See. It’s just beyond that, I changed to f/4.||||Tape ±43/6||||LMP|Yes, but you're going to be looking at the nadir, aren't you?||CMP|Yes, that's right. Are you sure we want the -Yes, that's right; 8-second intervalometer for looking at the nadir with the 80 millimeter. Right?||LMP|Yes.||CMP|Okay. Let me take a look down at the - that mare floor and Dawes. No. That's not Dawes, that's Bessel. Doesn't look like Dawes. Dawes has got a bunch of little - depressions that look like rimless pits in the bottom of it. Bessel doesn't have any of those. It looks - like a bunch of debris.|08 21 10 22|CMP|There you go, Gene.||CMP|Yes. Yes, yes, I see it.||CMP|Yours is on - I see yours, Gene. It's on up there a little farther. Isn't it? But all of these are in the - this is not out in.the mare floor of Serenitatis. It's on the hills there, the Haemus Mountains. It's just to the west of the Sulpicius Gallus Rille, and it's an elongate feature than runs kind of north-northwest by south-southeast. Yes.||CDR|... was yours ...?||CMP|No, it's not in the mare floor at all. It's up there In the edge of the Haemus Mountains. But that was the same type of material; it has the same color difference as the - the material around the Tacquet Rilles back there. There now, see all those bright orange craters right in the - in the Sulpicius Gallus Rille, up at the north end of it? Jack calls them an orangish-gray; I call them an orangish-tan.||CDR|... out in the mare that's got this - all that -||||||Tape 143/7||CMP|Eo. No. Jack, did you get the pictures, good pictures? Because I can take it. See that one -oh, yes - see that one on the mare?||LMP|Yes. Good one on the mare.||CMP|Yes.||LMP|Did you get that one - -||LMP|Oh, lost my - -||CDR|Okay, here's my orange crater - -||LMP|Here, take it.||LMP|Let me take a look at it.||CMP|Yes, that's it. Yes, I can, too.|08 21 13 27|CMP|Yes, Gene, yours is out on the - I got a picture of it.||CDR|Are you sure?||CMP|Yes, yes, I know. It's got a - -||CDR|Okay. It's just inside, just in the foothills.||CMP|Yes. Just in the - Wait a minute. Okay, I've got one out in the mare itself. It's got a -strip - -||CDR|... foothills, and I can't take any ...||CMP|Well, when we get to - when I see one out there, I'll get it. Yes, I better have because they're getting close to - As a matter of fact, I need it just about right now. Okay?|08 21 l4 15|CDR|Veil, Gordo, we're going - we're going to get set up for Ron's orbital science, but that little classic crater, I could see It again with the - -||CMP|... 1/250.||||Tape 143/8||||CDR|- - with the naked eye. I don't think it's the same one that Ron and Jack were talking about, but this is so classic. It's just out of the mare into the foothills to the - right along our orbital track.||CMP|And we're starting with mag 109 for the orbital science on Kilo Kilo, and I don't know what the number was before we started taking all of our (laughter) -||LMP|...|08 21 l4 53|CC|Okay. We copy that; 109 on a key - on KK.||CMP|Okay.||LMP|||CMP|(Laughter) Fortunately. Oh, what? Okay, there's the old Apennines. Where are we heading for on this, Gordy? Can you give me a clue as we go along?||LMP|South Imbrium.||CMP|Well, yes; south Imbrium*s a big thing. Oh, the stupid thing doesn't work. I got that one.||CMP|Huh?||CMP|I got that one. I took it.||LMP|Oh, I don't think you did.||CMP|Yes, I did.||LMP|Gordy.||CDR|Just a little bit on it. This one is -||CC|Go ahead.|03 21 16 03|LMP|This is Jack. My impression on that rimless, V-shaped depression that had the striking talus on it - that it - it also - there was a spotted,||||||Tape 143/9|||mottled rim area that has the orangish-tan, or orangish-gray color as the spot. And it looked as if the - in this first - in this pass, and I'll try to verify it if we have another opportunity, it looked as if the more red-gray, red-brown-gray, if you will, material was lower in the section within the walls of the depression. This is a very steep-walled depression, by the way. It has talus streaming down the sides of it, and the coloration streams in this same direction. It looks as if there may be layers or roughly horizontal zones that are - have the coloration that we're seeing, which are forming the talus slopes down below them.|08 21 17 17|CMP|Break, break. When do I change to 2.8?||CDR|I'll give them to you.||CC|Okay, not until you get on up the line, Ron, to Lambert.||CMP|Oh, okay. Lambert? Okay.|08 21 12 29|CC|And your pictures are pretty much right along the nadir.||CMP|Okay.|08 21 20 06|CMP|Now I got it. Okay. Yes. It's La Hire Rilles.||CDR|Is that Timocharis we're coming up on?||CMP|Yes, Timochar - We're over Timocharis now, and then La Hire Rilles are coming up.||LMP|Okay. There's Lambert up there - -||CMP|Yes. Lambert's right up there, coming up. I'in not sure - well, I don't know what the - just to the south of Lambert. What is that? 5io, just on the map.||LMP|Well, Pytheas, but it's -||||Tape 143/10||||CMP|That way. Remember it's right with the La Hire Rilles. There's one rille that goes right through it almost, and then another one - see, goes northeast-southwest. Oh, I see, okay.||LMP|Gordy, getting a good oblique view of Copernicus on this trip. And some of the dark-halo craters that we mapped originally on the north portion of the ejecta blanket, which were similar to Copernicus H, are very clearly darker halo than the - or have darker blankets around them than the ejecta blanket from Copernicus.|08 21 21 45|CC|Roger. And Ron should be due to change to 2.8 about now.||CMP|Okay.||LMP|And this is a good view of the central peaks, although from some distance; and, as Ron and I were discussing earlier, it's not at all clear that that - in fact, that dike does not come through as a - the so-called dike - as a - as a unit that is clearly defined.||CMP|Yes. I was looking at it through the binocs last time, and I couldn't really see anything that was really defined as coming on through there.||CC|Okay.||LMP|There's still a very - there's a very clear distinction between the dark floor material of Copernicus and the hummocky floor material, the dark smooth being in the northwest quadrant.||CMP|You know, if Lambert is an impact crater, it's sure awful smooth ejecta around that thing. It only goes out about a half a crater diameter, maybe a crater diameter in some spots, at the nest; but it's not rough, it's blocky looking. You know, it's smooth - smooth, undulating -|08 21 23 31|CC|Ron, your next camera change is at Euler, which you change to 1/125 of a second.||CMP|I think we just croaked. We did.||||||Tape 143/11||LMP|You out of film?||CMP|Yes.||LMP|You want that other mag?||CMP|Let's load Oscar Oscar in there to see if it will work.||CMP|Need the - dark slide. Here. Okay. Where's Oscar Oscar? Whoops. VHBW. There's a -|08 21 24 24|LMP|We've got a good oblique view of the Hortensius Domes, and with their nice little central pit craters.||CMP|Did we hit the stick, or something? Huh? Looks like we're changing attitude. Well, I'll be darned. I put Oscar Oscar on there and I got but one picture. (Laughter) And it's empty. Well, that's probably right. Those won't come out too good there, anyhow. Too close to the terminator for this kind of film.|08 21 25 28|CC|Yes, we agree with that, Ron. Farouk was mentioning that was kind of - beyond Euler was pretty marginal anyway.||CMP|Yes.|08 21 26 03|CDR|Gordo, that classic crater that I talked about last rev, I picked it up again this rev with the naked eye, and then I also looked at it again with the binocs. If Ron was talking about the same crater, and I have my doubts, he got a picture of it, he said. But the interior - I won't say there's a change to black; it's just dark. I'd say it's probably about the size, to put it in the right perspective, of Shorty, or just a little bit bigger. The inside is dark. By that, I don't nean it's black or anything inside; I just can't really see inside of it. But the - It's a rust-colored blanket that comes out and overlaps cn the rims and then has the classic ejecta. Ana I'r. going to take a shot at trying tc get a picture of it next rev or scnetirne when we're In an attitude, because it' s too gooo. to miss.||||Tape 143/12|||08 21 27 03|CC|Okay. And, commander, if you can send one of your subordinates over there to terminate the battery charge, we'd appreciate it.||CDR|(Laughter) Okay, that's in work.||CMP|Seven Bravo. It's 1 point - it's coming up just a little bit. Well, not much, 1 point - well, 1.25|08 21 27 52|LMP|Okay, Houston. Battery charge on B is terminated, and we got 1.25 on 7 Bravo.||CC|Okay, thank you.||CMP|Here's November November; it may have three or four pictures left. It's on l60. ... me set one up. Oh, we've got Papa Papa for opportunity, huh? Yes. I'll get it.||LMP|Houston, are you ready for LASER ALTIMETER, ON?||CC|Stand by.|08 21 29 53|CC|America, we're seeing some higher than normal temperatures on fuel cell 1. We'd like you to go to panel 226 and check the FUEL CELL 1 PUMPs circuit breaker and also the switch on panel 5. Over.||LMP|Well, don't ask me how it happened, but your switch on panel 5 is OFF. Going to AC1.||CC|Okay. I guess that's the best news that we could have had on that. And we're ready for the laser altimeter - -||LMP|Okay. Hey, Gordy - -||CC|- - whenever you get to the attitude.||LMP|- - Gordy? Here's one you can explain to me. when I turned that on - well, I guess that - I got a sudden drop in H flow; and then it went up, overshot a little bit, and now it's steady. I suspect that's what your EECOM friend there will say should happen.||||||Tape 143/13|08 21 31 07|CC|Yes. That's right, and we see indications that the pump started up.||LMP|Okay, that was a good call. I can't - How long have you noticed that, Gordy? Do you know?||CC|Well, it's been about 3 minutes, Jack.||LMP|Okay. I guess I'm to blame then; I don't know how it happened.||CMP|Hey, Houston; America. Do we have any more orbital science photos?||CC|Stand by.||CMP|I think that was It, but I'm not sure.|08 21 33 32|CMP|Okay, Houston. LASER ALTIMETER is ON, and IMAGE MOTION is barber pole plus 4.||CC|Okay. Thank you.|08 21 38 00|CC|Say, Ron, this is Houston. And there's no more scheduled orbital science photos. We can't seem to run down Farouk to see if he has anything up his sleeves. There are a couple of passes with black and white coming up; one next rev, ana then a couple just prior to TEI.||CMP|Okay. Looks like what we've got left here, as far as I can tell anyhow, is just - we've got all of magazine Papa Papa, and maybe four or five of them on November November.||CC|Okay. And we'll come back to you if there's anything we got in mind to schedule on - on either of those.||CMP|Okay. We'll want to save some for after TEI to -shoot back at the Moon.||CC|Roger.||LMP|Hey, Gordy, that's TEI-1, not TSI-2 he's talking ab out.||||Tape 143/14||||CMP|Okay, I see what he said.||CC|Roger. TEI, period.||CMP|That's right.||CDR|These guys can call it what they like, but I know what it's going to be and when.||CC|America, a little human interest stuff here. We just watched the second charge go off; not just watched, it's been about half hour ago or so. Second charge went off, and we caught it just in the lower left corner of the TV view. It looked like a - to me it looked like a flashbulb went off - flashbulb laying on the ground vent off, just a kind of a quick flash. No big shower of dirt or anything that I could tell.||CDR|How far away do you expect that one was, Gordy?||CC|That one was 600 meters away. And it was a half-pound charge.||CDR|Yes, you're still pretty far away over that -yes, you're still pretty far away over that - that terrain that those things are sitting in over there. You're going to probably see something when you look at those that are placed by the end of the SEP and back to the east there.||CC|Roger.|08 21 43 51|LMP|Houston, America.||CC|Go ahead.||LMP|Do you need the cryos stirred ax, all today?||CC|Let me see here. Stand by. No. I guess you've been bouncing around there enough. We don't need to stir them.||LMP|It won't hurt them, will it?||||||Tape 143/15||CC|No.||LMP|Okay.||CC|Showing about 115 beats per minute on the CMP.|08 21 h6 38|CC|America, we'll take AUTO on the HIGH GAIN.||LMP|Okay, you've got AUTO.|08 21 54 20|CC|Okay, America, we're about to LOS in 40 seconds. Everything looks good as it always has. See you next time around.||CDR|See you Gordy, and thanks for keeping an eye on us.||CC|One last frantic reminder to configure the DSE per the Flight Plan after LOS.|08 21 54 56|CDR|Okay, we'll get it.|08 22 14 XX||BEGIN LUNAR REV 66|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 144/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|08 22 40 19|CMP|Houston, America.

I have three one-liners for the Flight Plan.||LMP|Is this the same Flight Plan we've been working on up here?||CC|I think it is.||LMP|Okay, Gordy. Go ahead.||CC|Okay, at 218:09, delete MAPPING CAMERA - RETRACT. At 218:30, delete MAPPING CAMERA/LASER ALTIMETER COVER - CLOSED. And at 219:59 - next page - in addition to IR and UV COVERs - OPEN, put in LASER ALTIMETER - ON.||LMP|Okay. At 219:59, LASER ALTIMETER - ON; and at 218:30, delete MAPPING CAMERA/LASER ALTIMETER -OPEN; and at 218:09, delete MAPPING CAMERA - RETRACT.||CC|Okay, that second one was deleting a COVER CLOSED, but I'm sure that's the one you got. MAPPING CAMERA/LASER ALTIMETER COVER - CLOSED. And that laser altimeter, we'll just leave her run through the sleep period.|08 22 45 C3|LMP|Okay.||CMP|Can't see it, sorry.||CMP|May 'nave. Smythii may have, on the thing. I still want to talk a little bit about these polygonal craters ana Smythii. The one right above rev 62 picture on the thing, there's definitely kind of a, an unindated (sic) old depression there with a||||Tape 144/2|||||mare, very smooth mare floor on the thing. With two, - two old craters. And, that is definitely a younger flow than whatever made the polygonal craterlike depression. Right above the rev 62 number. The thing that bothers me about that is that they, they almost - oh, looks like if you threw a rock in the mud, you know - made a mud pie, and you get a wave or a ripple going out from there. In other words, you've got a high wavefront going out from a circular direction with a slightly sloping up to that wavefront. That's on the inner ring on the thing. The outer ring, of course, is a typical-type ring that you get from an impact type of an operation. It looked like the rough-looking floors of those rings, ring basins, essentially have the same albedo, the same characteristic, as the rougher looking floor in the Mare Smythii itself.|08 22 49 17|CC|Okay, Ron.||CC|We'll take HIGH GAIN to AUTO.|08 22 49 30|CMP|Okay, you have it.||CMP|And, I took a picture of that one in Smythii -is frame l60 on mag November November, and the reason I took the picture is really because on the western edge of the big basin it looks like there's a small impact crater, but it's only been dished out in the more recent flat dark-gray mare material. {Music in background) And looks like when it comes to the edge of the original basin ring, that part is not ejected out at all. So, essentially, you have a cone-type depression with an impact crater. The material's only been excavated in the - in the newer mare material.||CC|Okay, understand that. Say again, where that one is?||CMP|Yes, that's the one above rev 62 or directly north of the Wright Brothers(?), in the 12:CO position from the Wright Brothers.||CC|Oh, okay.||||||Tape 144/3||CMP|You know, Houston, we're just passing over a little polygonal crater that's maybe 15 kilometers in diameter -15, 20 kilometers in diameter. It may be 10 to 15 - and down in the basin of it is a kind of a polygonal fill. It, again, has that dark greenish-black rock that is collected down at the bottom of it, and you also see it streaking down the side of it. But, I think one of the most significant features about the crater itself is that it has a swirl, and these are honest to goodness - they look like swirls rather than rays. It has a swirl pattern around there - it's radial, from that most recent impact.|08 22 53 44|CC|Roger, Ron.||CC|America, Houston, we haven't got data right at the moment because we are in a skin reflection zone. We'd like you to hold the pan camera to STANDBY until we call you.||LMP|Thank you.||CMP|Okay.||CMP|It's near - just see Yerkes. Come down from Yerkes. Yerkes is the subdued crater up there. Come down from Yerkes, and then there's a little one about 10 kilometers in diameter; and, then a big one that's about 50; and, then there's a bright one. Okay, and then - -||CMP|Yes, and then right - let me see, kind of northwest of that bright one, about a crater and a half diameter from it - Is an orange-ringed crater, again||CMP|See it - right, right, just a - bright one just about a crater and a half diameter from the bright one. See it? See, It's an orange ring on it, isn't it? That's the one we were talking - - I'll get it. Yes.||CMP|Yes, I know it. That's right. It's not a classic, but it's another example of an orangish-tannish -Say what? See that bright crater down there. Just about a crater and a half diameter to the north of it - f/8 at 250 - that ought to set it. And Houston, that was frame 162.||||Tape ikk/k||||CC|Okay, Ron.||CMP|Yeah, we - -||CDR|And, the frame just before that - I took of a ridge just on the southern edge of Crisium, - the pattern of the massifs in that area were very impressive, but two frames just before that.|08 22 58 38|CC|Okay.||CMP|Houston, just one other question. I was looking around here at my film, and I got mag Victor Victor, which is VHBW for the Nikon. And looking through the Flight Plan, it doesn't look like we're going to be able to use that anytime. I just wonder if we might be able to use it for some of these terminator photos?||CC|We'll check on the film. We'd like you to go WIDE for 10 seconds and then back to NARROW.|08 22 59 50|CMP|Okay. There's WIDE. Looks like that did it.||CC|Okay, Ron. The HIGH GAIK looks good; and, on the film - it's your option on that magazine. There's no scheduled usage.||CMP|Oh, okay, thank you.||LMP|Okay, you want PAN CAMERA POWER, ON, now?||CC|That's affirm. We're ready now.|08 23 00 45|LMP|Okay, it's ON.||SC|||CMP|You want to get it, or I'll get it?||CC|Okay, America. We'll take PAN CAMERA POWER OFF, now.|08 23 03 17|LMP|Okay, it's OFF.||CMP|The landing site?||CMP|lao, the optics are up in the air all the tine or. this SIM bay stuff.||||||Tape 144/5||LMP|Houston. Areas in the landing site where we now know there are extensive blocks of the subfloor material, particularly in the walls of the larger craters, I have the impression that those block fields, from this altitude, give a light bluish-gray appearance.||CC|Roger, Jack.||LMP|I don't know how far we could extrapolate that in other craters, but we might start trying a little bit.||CC|Roger.||LMP|Following that a little bit farther, looking into Dawes, the lower talus, slopes of Dawes have about the same hue and are overlaying the first by a zone that's producing - or several ledges that seem, to be producing white talus and then above that is the - or make that very light-gray talus - and above that is a tan-gray talus slope that carries right up to the rim of Dawes. So, there are three distinct major stratigraphic units showing up in the talus slope in Dawes that I can see.||CMP|Jack, can you see any holes in the - square holes in the floor of Dawes, there?||LMP|Wait a minute. No, I was, I guess I was talking about the crater northeast of Dawes - Let me check Dawes with the same sequence.||CMP|No. Dawes is the little one down there. That other one is - -||LMP|Okay, take it back again. That was Dawes I was talking about.||CMP|Yes.||CMP|Jack, you using the binocs?||CMP|Yes, I talked about Dawes already but - No, those aren't holes down there, those are just great big -great big blocks that have fallen off the side of the mountain. Side of the - Okay,||||Tape 144/6||||LMP|Okay, between the tan gray and the very light gray there may be another thin and possibly intermittent zone of a - just a plain, apparently gray unit forming in the talus slope.|08 23 08 16|LMP|And the crater to the southeast of - southwest -excuse me, of Dawes - large crater, I'll get the name in a minute, you see the lower bluish-gray unit and - and the next white unit or light-gray unit up, but the brown-gray unit is not nearly so evident at the top. In fact, I didn't really say I could recognize it there at all. I'll have to check that one, though. Put a query by it.||CC|Roger.||CMP|That's Bessel you're talking about. The top of Serenity?||LMP|No, no the one back.||CMP|Oh, Plinius.||LMP|Plinius?||CMP|Plinius is that rough-looking one. Yes.||LMP|Yes. That was Plinius I was talking about.||CMP|Oh, Yes. ... the oranges. Yes.||LMP|And, the next large - well, it's not large - not as big as Dawes, It's a reasonable-sized crater that to the west, the talus is largely just white debris on the slope of it. But, it doesn't look like it penetrated nearly as deep as the other two we're talking about.||CMP|Ah, Menelaus Tacquet is the one that is out -right underneath us right now. And then Menelaus is right on the edge of the Serenitatis Basin before you get to the Haemus Mountains.||LMP|Okay, looking at Menelaus, you can see where the dark - the edge of Serenitatis goes through the crater. And, the north wall is quite distinctly grayer to - let's say, bluish-gray, than the south wall, which is light - very light gray in the talus. My guess is that it's a very nearly vertical contact at that point.||||||Tape 144/7||CC|Roger.||LMP|At least that's the way the talus suggests it, but talus does move vertically. Looking at the depression with all the color streaking in the talus on the walls - there - I'11 say again, that the more red-looking unit, or talus, is coming from below the orangish-gray material. But It is not a continuous horizon, at least not so far as the talus indicates. It's local spots that are giving the reddish color.||CC|Okay.||LMP|Gordy. That particular depression doesn't look like it's an impact-generated depression at all.||CC|Roger.|08 23 13 02|CMP|You know, we sure got to look and see if those things still look orange tomorrow. Because, yesterday, Stoney looked kind of orange there -on the northeast rimr but, it sure doesn't today -Shorty, yes. It pays to learn the names of all those craters you guys named down there.||CMP|Oh yes. I know quite a bunch of them.||CMP|Hey, we'd better, hadn't we. Black and - D-Caldera is what I called it.||LMP|Yes, Ron's D-Caldera - I'm just correlating apparent colors now, or hues. And, the lighter-colored material there is comparable In hue to the subfloor color at the landing site.||CMP|The first one's f/32 at 1/500. Tobias Mayer.||CMP|... A window.||LMP|Window 5-||CMP|Window 5? Okay.||LMP|What's the frame count ... surface?||CMP|Count is 55 now on Romeo Romeo, Houston. Xc, not until we come up to Tobias, just before Tobias Mayer.||||Tape 144/8||||CDR|Be able to pick that up there about - -||CMP|On the other side of Copernicus.||CMP|Right after 218. Okay.||CC|Roger that, Ron.||CMP|(Cough)||CC|Ron, this is Houston. Do you want any help from me calling the f/stop changes on this P66 run? Or do you want to do it on board there?||CMP|Why don't you give me a little help there. Just kind of reminders? So to f/ll about Tobias Mayer, I guess, and, then -||CC|Okay. Then f/8 and a 1/250 is at Brayley D.||CMP|Yes, right.||CC|Are you shooting pretty much straight down or out in front, on this one?||CMP|Let's see. We're pretty much straight down on this one.||CC|Okay, I've got a real-time plot of your longi - yes, longitude here. So I can call right on longitude.|08 23 17 59|CMP|Oh, okay. Yes, I started before Tobias Mayer.||CMP|There goes - What's there? Eratosthenes, okay.||CMP|Yes, about right in here it's a good place.|08 23 23 14|LMP|Okay, Houston, back to talking about colors a little bit. It looked as If lower talus is more - -||CC|Hold 1, Jack. It's about time for f/ll - -||LMP|Go ahead.||CC|... Ron.||CMP|Okay, f/ll at 1/500.||||||Tape 144/9||CC|That's affirmative.||LMP|Euler is - lower is blue-gray and the upper is a very light gray, from the talus slope up to the rim.||CDR|Houston, I can just start to see the peaks of Euler now - exposed in the central peak - the tops of them exposed in the sunlight, and it looks like there's massive quantities of large boulders on the - on the peaks.||CC|Roger, Gene. Okay, it must be about time for f/8 and 1/250.||CMP|f/8 at 1/250, okay? That's my little sea - crater chain down there. Looks like a cinder cone chain. Right (cough) between Tobias Mayer and Euler.||CC|Roger.||CC|Okay, try f/56 and 1/25-||CMP|56 at 1/25- Is this the last - -?||CC|Last setting, right, and you should finish up there at Tobias Mayer W.||CMP|Okay.||CC|Or a little beyond.|08 23 26 34|CDR|Houston, the MAPPING CAMERA is coming OFF.||CC|Roger.||CMP|Okay, Houston. We ended up on frame 80, magazine R R.||CC|Okay, Ron.|08 23 27 27|LMP|Okay, Houston, MAPPING CAMERA - STANDBY, now. IMAGE MOTION is OFF and LASER ALTIMETER - OFF.||CC|Roger.||||Tape 144/10||.||LMP|Houston, what do you read our GLYCOL EVAP TEMP as? I tapped the gage up here and got a little bit of upward jimp in temperature. Just curious how much a hang up it was.||CC|Stand by. Okay, we show 66 EVAP out TEMP.||LMP|That's exactly what it jumped to. Okay.||CDR|Gordo, I'm interested. How have you been reading me most all day today? I've been on lightweight headset, all the time.||CC|I'd say you're fine, since I've been on. Let me check you the rest of the day.||CDR|No, it would be the same all day. You're - you're as good a data point as any. I haven't really tried to make ajay effort to talk into the mike or anything, I just been talking around it, and If you're satisfied, I'm happy.||CC|Okay, sound gooded fsicj all day.

Glad to have you back.||CDR|Well, we got a good one for you, Bob. Not too good, but - In the midst of other things, we let the waste water go to zero on that dump. As a matter of fact, it went past zero. And the ... is starting to fill up again, and the best we can tell onboard, that - it shouldn't disturb anything, but you might take a good look at it.||CC|Okay. We've got our moon beside me taking a look at it.||CDR|Okay. How are you doing tonight?||CC|Not too badly. I'll have you know, it's clear down here. We saw the Moon for the first time since launch day. It's getting bright. It looks like you must be somewhere over the terminator on Imbrium.||CDR|Is that right?||CC|First time we've seen the Moon since launch day.||CMP|Oh, we just - Oh, it's beautiful. Your weather has been that bad, huh?||CC|That's affirm. Fog and drizzle and rain and rain and rain.||LMP|Kow much older do you feel, Bob?||CC|About 1 day. Okay. And, America, we'd like n TANK 2 FANS, OFF. H2 TANK 2, OFF.|08 00 39 15|LMP|They're OFF.||||Tape 145/2||||CC|And, America, as you can tell from the Flight Plan, we aren't expecting too much from you guys this rev. And we aren't expecting to send up too much to you guys either. A reminder that we won't be asking Gene and Jack for their PRDs tonight, but we certainly would like them in the morning. So you might take that into consideration. And we'll be sending you a few up-links there for the Flight Plan at 220, both the state vector and the EMP 523. We also have a clock update for you - that we'll send up, and it's a 0.04 seconds; so it's another biggie.||CDR|Okay, Bob. We'll make an effort to get those PRDs. We can get one of them, probably, without too much trouble. But it's a case of restowing both those suits to get the second one, we're not going to get it until EVA day. I'm sorry, but that's it.||CC|We copy that. I guess they're back stored in the L-bag, huh?||CDR|Yes, sir.||CC|Okay. And we'll want the onboard read outs there at the bottom of the page, just before you go LOS, And I might pass up one little piece of news - very local news here - concerning us members of the Orange Team. We're all extremely proud that you and Jack chose to call the soil you found the other night, while we were on shift, the Orange soil because we take it as an obvious honor for the Orange Team to have been on shift at that point.||CDR|Bob, you know our intent was certainly well meant. We certainly are glad you appreciate it.||LMP|I detect a certain amount of skepticism whether it's really orange, though.||CC|It looked orange on Ed's TV.||CDR|Eid it really? Could you see the color and all?||||||Tape 145/3||CC|Well, so did the blue ocean on the Earth, and so did the white suits and everything else; but they looked orange on Ed's TV anyway.||LMP|Is Ed on tonight?||CC|We don't have any - Ho, we've seen the two - only two charges for the day. We don't have another charge for, I guess, about another 24 hours or so.|09 00 42 22|CDR|I think I understand.||CC|Roger. Ed is on the Orange Team, however.||CDR|Bob, I would like a word from you, though, as to whether or not you think there is going to be any problem with that waste water dump to zero as I|||said. We don't, after looking at it.||CC|No, we aren't expecting any problem. They're looking at it. They're kind of ainused, but they're looking at it. And I'd like to pass up to you fellows, it's - -||LMP|... an iteresting.||CC|Go ahead.||CDR|All right. Nothing, Bob.||CC|Okay, I might also tell you fellows, in case nobody told you yesterday, that we tracked the LM on ascjnt for 30 seconds. Beautiful pitchover. And we saw you going away from us after pitchover for 30 seconds. It came out quite well.||CDR|Yes, sir. We heard that. Good. I guess I was able to find 102 at 0.1||CC|In fact, Ed calculates that you were 480 feet-480 feet - from the lens. As they say, too far is better than too close.||CDR|Well, I was just going to say I cheated a little bit. I made two stops and backed up a little bit out there.||||Tape 145/4||||CC|You backed up, huh? That's another first, isn't it ?||CDR|No, I didn't back up that time. But I did back up.|09 CO 44 54|CC|We heard that one at station 7 - yes, 7, wasn't it?||CDR|No, that was somewhere during EVA-2, I can't remember where.||CMP|Houston, fram numbers 40 through 43 are timed sequences of the waste water dump as we were in the sunlight.||CC|Okay. I copy that one.||CDR|And, Bob, just give us a call when you want the computer.||CC|Okay. It's about another half hour or so, I guess, when we're ready. It will be about 220. And, a reminder, we got - at 220 there we're going to go LASER ALTIMETER, ON and the IR and UV COVERS, OPEN as per your Plight Plan there.||CDR|Yes, sir. I got LASER, ON and IR and UV, OPEN.|09 00 47 24|CC|Right.|09 00 55 27|CDR|Hey, Bob, while it's sort of quiet, anything of a news worthy - or noteworthy news happen today?||CC|Okay. Stand by on that. From my recollection this evening, there really wasn't anything; but I'll check. Did you guys get a news briefing this morning?||CDR|Yes, we did.||CC|Okay. We got some news coining over, and we'll have it here before you go around the hern. Might just, while things are quiet also, pass up to you that, if you run out of the command module film.||||||Tape 145/5|||there, you do have two - You've got some LM surface film left, as I'm sure you're aware. And two mags in particular, which look fine to us, are mag Barabara and mag Karen. Barabara has 500 frames of CEX, and Karen, 100 frames of black and white. Excuse me, 50 frames, not 500, of CEX. And 100 of black and white. These mags have never been fit checked - on the command module cameras; but we believe that they will, along with - as long as we take precaution because the locks don't work the same, ... on the command module on the LM cameras, number 1. And number 2, the focus won't be quite as good as on the - with the LM cameras. However, it will be satisfactory. So there's 150 frames there you might want to take advantage of in those two mags. We think those are in Romeo 2 -stowage Romeo 2.||CDR|Yes, yes. We've already inventoried those. And we've got our hands on them. However, we - Bravo is empty. We used it coming up in the rendezvous and docking.||CC|And just in case you got some left over, I want to shoot some of that black and white on the Moon. We got some instructions for you, which we can call up in real time, if you want to do it -different exposures. The CEX will be the same, of course, as the CEX that's in the command module.||LMP|Okay. Bob, what factor on the black and white would you use?|09 00 59 23|CC|Okay. Jack, if you use them, use them, use the same sort you have onboard for the CEX, but you cut the shutter speed by a factor of 2. So it's -for instance, you'd use a 1/500 instead of 1/250 -and so forth. Over.||LMP|Okay.||CDR|Say, Bob, I don't think - At least I haven't heard anything concerning the home front for about 4 days. You haven't, by any chance, had any contact, have you?||||Tape 145/6|||09 01 01 42|CC|As a matter of fact, I haven't. And Gordy didn't talk to them tonight. And - in fact, Gordy and 1 talked about it on one of your - when we were doing the changeover, and I thought, well, it doesn't look like an opportune time to call up and find out right now. If you like, I can. I'm not sure whether they're still up or not; or I can leave instructions for Overmeyer in the morning to round people up and see what's going on. Oh, I'll make sure Overmeyer does it in the morning.||CDR|No. Don't worry about it, Bob. I was just curious I - No news is as good as good news.||CC|Yes, that's my presumption. I kind of thought the daytime people would have taken care of that. It's not the best time in the morning to call up right now. I'll make sure Overmeyer calls in the morning and checks on it.||CDR|Gordy gave us a briefing on the SIM bay and on the lunar surface experiments. And it sounds like all that good liaison work you did paid off. Sounds like most everybody is pretty satisfied.||CC|As far as I can tell, that's right. We - we try there, fellow.||CDR|We thank you.|09 01 03 19|CC|What can I say? We thank you guys, too.|09 01 19 21|CC|Okay, America; Houston. We're ready for a little action there in the SIM bay.||CMP|... is on.||CC|Copy that. You just beat us by a minute. And if you guys will give us - -||CDR|It's already on, Bob.||CC|Roger. And if you guys will give us the computer, we'll send those updates to you.||||||Tape 145/7||CMP|Okay, you have the computer.||CC|Okay. And if you guys want to sit and listen, I'll broadcast you what's possibly the world's shortest newscast.||CDR|Both covers are open and gray, Bob.|09 01 20 56|CC|Okay. We copy that.||LMP|Go ahead, Bob, on the news. We were waiting for you.|09 01 21 09|CC|"Oh, okay. I was waiting to see if you guys were ready to listen to it. The first item - which has been a continuing item here during the flight -In Kansas City, former President Harry S. Truman's condition continues to deteriorate as doctors are unable to restore his vital kidney functions. On the Paris peace talks scene, there has been essentially no apparent further developments today. It continues about the same. And in New York, police are red-faced, it says, when it was learned that more than 50 pounds of heroin originally seized way back in 1962 - this is part of the French Connection business - has been stolen from the police building where it was being kept as evidence. And a last local news item. Three prominent Houston men are missing. They were last seen in person at Cape Kennedy in Florida on December 6 but were apparently lost among the 500,000 people who watched the launch of Apollo 17 The following appeal, it says, is issued in case they are listening: ""Gene, Jack, and Ron, - come home. And if you pass a fellow with a bushy white beard and crimson suit, advise him you'll be home before Christmas."" That's the extent of the news."||LMP|We saw him the other morning briefly, Bob. And all four of us will be around at the right time.|09 01 22 37|CC|That's good news.

A huge high pressure system is dominating the midsection of the nation. Barometric pressure reached a high of 30.7 in the Houston area this morning at about 5:00 a.m. With strong gusty winds, the chill factor was a 5 above in Houston, and about a minus 10 degrees in Galveston. Man, that's cold. The national Christmas tree was lighted last night in Washington by Vice President Spiro Agnew. A small crowd, braving cold and rainy weather, watched, as the Vice President threw the switch to light up the 70-foot spruce that came from Medicine Bow, Wyoming. During the ceremony, Mr. Agnew said we must remember the many servicemen who are missing in action or prisoners of war in Indochina eind pray for them this holiday season. North Vietnamese peace talk negotiator Le Due Tho has told newsmen he is very optimistic about prospects for an early cease fire in Vietnam. Before leaving Paris, Le Due Tho said he will remain in very close contact with Dr. Henry Kissinger. Dr. Kissinger is in Washington.

President Nixon has given the green light for a pay raise for all Federal employees. The across-the-board increase of 5-14 percent will benefit both civilian and armed forces personnel. A 7^7 jumbo jet, while taking off out of Miami International yesterday, went through a flock of bii'ds and reportedly lost - had an engine go out. The pilot turned the aircraft around and went out over the Atlantic and burned down some fuel and landed at Miami, but skidded off the runway, hit a concrete culvert, and sheared the nose gear. A few passengers fainted, but only 4 were injured when they went down the slide.|09 10 38 12|CC|The unexpected always deserves some attention. The samll community of Westwood, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City, will send back a check it has received from the Federal government in the Federal-revenue-sharing program. Major Joe Dennis said Westwood just didn't need the money. On the regional and local scene - I just might add - I see it's not here, that President Truman's condition seemed to deteriorate some last night, but he is still not listed on the critical list, he is serious. Miss Ima Hogg, the 90-year-old founder of the Houston Symphony, was honored at a gala birthday party last night and cake-cutting ceremony at the symphony. And little Tomball, Texas, has had police trouble, but nearby Pasadena doesn't seem to have any. Thirteen new pretty policewomen have just joined the suburban police force out in Pasadena.

A special hello from the Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network crew around the world.||CDR|Thank you, Bob, and our hello and thank you to the tracking team. We sure have been able to work well with them, and communications have been super.||CC|That's real great. I'm sure those words will be appreciated up at Goddard, and around the world, of course.||CDR|Well, like a lot of other people - you know -you can't do it without them.|09 10 41 36|LMP|Bob, this is Jack. My appreciation and thanks, for an unnecessary honor, to Silver City.|09 10 4l 42|CC|Roger, I'm sure they're listening out there, and just glad to do it.|09 10 48 20|CMP|Hey, Houston; America. How do you reao. now?||CC|Read you loud and clear, Ron.||||||Tape 152/5||CMP|Okay, I've got the commander's menu for you.||CC|We're listening.||CMP|Okay, day 10, spiced oat cereal, mixed fruit, cinnamon toast and bread cubes, instant breakfast, tea, grape juice, and bacon squares, vitamin. For lunch, frankfurters, two pieces of bread, catsup, orange drink, and a package of pecans. Okay, for meal C, turkey and gravy, orange juice, and lemonade. Okay, for the medical log - commander’s -17052, 5 hours of very good sleep, no medication, and three cans of water. Okay, for the old LMP.

We'll try.||||Tape 152/6||||CC|Roger, Ron. We've been chasing a data dropout glitch and we just wonder - trying to cover all bets. When you were extending HF ANTENNA 1, could have you gone to operate on the immediate switch next to it, which is the LUNAR SOUNDER switch which was right next to 1? Could you have gone to OPERATE for a minute or 2 without realizing it while your hold - holding 1 to EXTEND?||LMP|Stand by, Bob. Which extension anomaly are you talking about, the one prior to rendezvous?||CC|No, the one after rendezvous and docking when we were putting them - they're out now and when we put them out - when we were putting them out and were extending HF ANTENNA 1, the LUNAR SOUNDER OPERATE switch is immediately next to it, and I realize HF ANTENNA 1 is a momentary switch. When you were holding it there, could you have gone to OPERATE on that LUNAR SOUNDER switch?||LMP|Bob, I don't think so. I - no. No, I don't think so.||CC|Okay, we'll keep track of that.||LMP|I would have had to - I would have had to been gone - I would have had to been gone to the -OFF position too, I guess, right after that, and I think I'd remember that.||CC|Yes, that's affirm. You would have had to go to OFF, there. And I didn't feel it, but Joe needs -you know we got a data glitch - it's nothing serious - no problem - but they're just back there trying to track down all little glitches and that -that seemed to be the only thing that could add up right now.||LMP|Sure, I - I understand. I understand. Yes.||CDR|Key, Bob, have you had any more charge firings or. the surface?||||||Tape 152/7||CC|I don't believe so. When I came on shift, they mentioned that the LCRU wasn't working right, now, and they were trying to work it.||CC|Okay, just for an update, we fired 6 and 7 last night and we'll be firing 1 at about 1 o'clock this afternoon.||LMP|They all went off okay, huh?||CC|Yes, and 4, 1, and 8 go off today. And we're seeing good results, Jack, on all the data.||LMP|Okay, has Bob Kovach gotten any depth to the debris cover or to anything below it yet?||CC|Let me check that out before I give it to you, piecemeal here. We'll check it out.|09 10 56 32|LMP|I realize that's pushing a little bit, but I'm curious.||LMP|Bob, how do you read 17?||CC|Read you loud and clear, Jack.||LMP|Okay. I'm looking right down the slope of the South Massif, above the slide right now - right down at the - just about the angle of the slope. And there's a very slight Indentation in the slope, just opposite the maximum - the point of maximum extent of the dark - light mantle. Opposite other portions of it, though, it - there's no clear indication of any change In the direction of the Massif - front. It's very, very slight, and I'd say you'd have a hard time saying that it is a source area for the light mantle but it's - there's a slight indentation.|09 11 01 11|CC|Roger.||LMP|Bob, just north of the - of the bright-rayed craters in the Littrow area, there are five craters - oh, probably in the tliousand-n.eter-diar.eter class range, 500 to 1C0C, and all five of those have the sequence of colors in the walls, from rim down, of a brown-gray - clue-gray and then brown-gray. They are all identical in that sequence ana quite clear.||||Tape 152/8||||CC|Roger.||LMP|And that blue-gray is comparable to the blue-gray that's visible in the craters such as Sherlock in the landing area. And along the graben, in the vicinity of those five craters, there is a series of very black spots, I'm going to have to look at again on the next pass, if we can. I don't have any idea what those spots are, but I'm looking very obliquely now to that graben and it's extremely - black spots along that graben.||CC|Roger.|09 11 10 42|CC|Ron, NOUN 26 doesn't require a sign.||CMP|Thank you, Bob.||CDR|I've heard more about this P20 on this side of the tunnel this mission than I ever could have.||CC|Roger. Looks like you guys are ready to go to work.||CDR|Well (laugh). Yes, we are. We're ready to do anything you want to do.||CC|Okay, we need ACCEPT. Got you a CSM state vector.||CDR|Okay, sock it to us.|09 11 11 39|CC|Okay, it's on its way. Going down the Flight Plan, we've got a Flight Plan update If you're ready to copy. It isn't too awful long, although it's not the easiest one.||CDR|Go ahead, Bob.||CC|"Okay. At 230:20, 230:20, add the following: ""LASER ALTIMETER, OFF; LA, OFF."""||LMP|Just keeping pressing on, Bob. I'll get then and let you know if I get then. all.||||||Tape 152/9||CC|"Okay.

Over at 232:27, 232:27, ""If LUNAR SOUNDER, OPERATE, talkback flag goes barber pole, switch LUNAR SOUNDER, OPERATE, to STANDBY."" The situation here is that it might run out of film during this lunar sounder HF target on Hertzsprung. If it does, we need to go to STANDBY immediately, and we - It'll probably require somebody monitoring that panel during that 5-to-6 minute pass there. Our best guess is -"||CDR|Okay, Bob.||CC|"Our best guess is we've got a 5-minute pad on that film, but this is just a precaution. And at 233:13, after ""PAN CAMERA, POWER,"" add ""V/H OVERRIDE, HIGH ALTITUDE."" Okay. That ends the Flight Plan update. I've got a lunar sounder pad."||CDR|Okay.|09 11 15 28|CC|Okay, lunar sounder pad is at 230:55, 230:55-T-start time, 231:00:00; T-stop time is at 07:58.||CDR|Is that everything, or you got a couple more sounder pads?||CC|That's trie or.ly sounder pad for now.||CDR|Okay, if - Let me just run it back through you to make sure I got them right.||||Tape 152/10|||||CC Go ahead,||CDR|Okay. At 230:21, you want the LASER ALTIMETER, OFF. At 230:30, you want to verify all the VHF is OFF. And we want to eliminate the waste water dump at 230:31. The sounder pad on that page is 231:00 and 231:07:58. At 232, following LUNAR SOUNDER, OPERATE, for that pad, if the OPERATE talkback goes barber pole, we want to switch the LUNAR SOUNDER5 OPERATE, to STANDBY, and we'll be monitoring the panel during that time. And at 233:12, following PAN CAMERA to POWER, you want V/H to HIGH ALT.||CC|That's a good readback, Gene.

And they form two of the major, longer, du - duller streamers that are streaming out from the Sun now. There are some other linear streamers that are still visible, but those were the major ones. Once you get out about to the position of Marss they all have about the same intensity - which is very low.||CC|Roger.||||Tape 153/2||||LMP|The pattern is distinctly different from the one I believe I mentioned to you yesterday, sometime.||CC|Roger.||LMP|It was right at sunset at any rate.||LMP|Still have a very strong glow visible at the sunset point.||CC|Roger.||LMP|And that glow - the - the general glow visible to me now - and of course I'm not very well light -adapted - dark-adapted - but extends about to a position - oh, let's see - about the same distance from the Sun as the apparent distance of Venus -between Venus and Mars right now. Well, let me -let me start over on that. The apparent distance from Venus to Mars is about the same distance as from Mars to the limit of the strong solar glow.||CC|See the NOUN 05 --||LMP|Bob, when I'm talking about streamers, I'm talking about lin - Say again.||CC|"I said, ""We see the NOUN 05."" Go ahead, Jack."||LMP|Okay, I just - when I talk about streamers, I'm talking about each time - very linear bright lines that extend - oh, maybe two or three crate -solar diameters out.

And the outer - crater rims on that thing are kind of like the one - ... about rev 62 in the picture, but the outer rim - is sloping in the opposite direction from the normal crater, or something. In other words, the steep slope is on the outside of the rim, and you have a gradual s_ope up to the - you know, from the center of the crater, you've got a gradual slope up to the rim, and then it drops off to the steep slope on the outside. And the steep slope on the outside is maybe - on, 35 to 45 degrees. The slope on the inside is probably - somewhere around 20 degrees - would guess. And there is one portion of the rim - kir_a of Gn the western portion of the one tr.au i was j_ookmg at, anynow — it' s c^^most a delta-shaped ring.||||||Tape 153/5||CC|Roger, Ron.

I was just kind of reminiscing a little bit about the - my mud puddle craters there in Smythii. I guess that's what I can term them or call them - that's what they always kind of looked like to me. But - they slope up. But the rims of those craters and even the interior rims on ones that are multi-ringed, they slope upward from the center of the crater toward the rim, and a gradual slope, and then they drop off on the outside of the crater rim, sloping down from the outside crater up to 45 degrees. And then at some points on there, it almost looks like it's a real classic delta-shaped rim on them, where you have the same slope on the inside as well as the outside of the crater.||CC|Roger, Ron.||CDR|Houston, you ready for mode VHF?||CC|That's affirmative.|09 12 44 19|CDR|VHF.|09 12 45 27|CMP|Okay; 50 seconds to LUNAR SOUNDER OPERATE, okay?

I've got a - a very interesting crater out in Tranquillity I'd like to pass some info on for you - to you on. It's about in the central part of Tranquillity. It's got a very sharply raised lip, and it's got some very dark -rough rimmed deposits. It's got a - a very, very obvious ... furrow, looks like it's elongated, basically to the ~ generally to the east and to the west. I can't tell, but because of the shape of it, and because of those a ... darker rir. deposits I'm sure there must be a vent there somewhere s but it's too dark down in there. I can't really see for sure whether there is one or not. But, if there is3 I imagine it's pretty big. And I can't tell., it's only sort of intuitive, but I imagine the elongation was produced during the thrust of the initial dynamics, the formation of the impact.||CC|Roger, Gene.

I did not mean Tranquillity.||CC|Copy „||CDR|Bob, I'll have to give you an estimate on the -on the relative size of it, but the length-to-width ratio is probably about 2 to 1, and it - it's certainly bigger than the Camelot size range.||CC|Roger.

This will be the undefeated season if they hack it.||CMP|Houston, America. I think I mentioned - a couple or 3 days ago that - however, when we first got up here - that I had a heck of a time seeing that Tycho ray that goes out across Bessel. And I forgot to tell you that yesterday - kind of for the first time - it really started showing up when we were getting up in the higher Sun. And today, it really shows up quite vividly. It's just a ray that takes off from the edge of Crisium and goes right across Bessel and goes out to about the middle of Crisium - I don't mean Crisium, I mean Serenitatis, I was talking about Serenitatis all the time.||CC|Right.||LMP|Say, Bob. Those craters on the south-western side of Serenitatis still have got that orange hue at this Sun angle, and that5s with the naked eye.||CC|Roger. These are the ones right in the Sulpicius Gallus region?||LMP|Yes.||||Tape 154/2|||09 13 04 43|CMP|And, Houston; 166 and 167 were taken of a crater that looks like it's got a reddish dike in it and it's on - in the - again in the Haemus Mountains to the west of Sulpicius Gallus.||LMP|Houston, a little more on that. It's an impact crater with a line essentially across the diameter in a east-west direction, maybe a little bit north of west direction and the ejecta to the north of that - just went under us - the ejecta to the north of the line is the orange - actually more red-brown than orange, although there are both hues in it - -||CC|Roger, Jack. Can you give us some scale on that crater?||LMP|- - looks similar to - Yes, it's about a 600-meter crater. And it looks very much like - in it's geologic pattern to the - that crater out in the Nevada test site on Buckboard Mesa that had an explosion along a contact between two very sharply contrasting rock types. In this case, however, the line does not go completely across the crater, and that's why we feel it may be a dike or a vein which fortuitously has been hit by that impact.||CC|Okay; can you give me a little relationship with respect to Sulpicius Gallus, the crater?||LMP|Yes, I'll try to spot It In a minute.||CC|Okay, why don't you just mark it on your map so for pre - postflight we'll have it.|09 13 07 40|LMP|On the - somewhere around - I'll try to spot it more exactly - on the 20 north latitude line and about 7 east on a ridge. It's right on top of z. ridge. I think it's that ridge. I'll try to spot it more exactly later.||CC|Okay.||CC|Ron, you're less than a minute to LUNAR SOUNDER STANDBY T-stop time.||CMP|...||||||Tape 154/3||CC|And, America, just a reminder. When you're powering the SIM bay, up here again, the mapping camera laser altimeter cover is already open and the mapping camera is already extended.||CDR|Okay. Thank you.||CDR|Okay, Bob. We'll just eliminate those last two steps, Is that correct?||CC|That's affirmative.||CDR|Okay. You still want MAPPING CAMERAS, STANDBY, up there in the fourth step?||CC|That's affirm.|09 13 12 04|CDR|Okay, Houston. The SIM bay is powered up. We eliminated the last two steps.||CC|Roger. Thank you, Gene.||CDR|Okay, Houston. I guess you saw those - we got through those procedures and you probably saw most of the switching. Sorry; 1 should have been in VOX.||CC|No problem.|09 13 15 38|LMP|Houston, this is 17.||CC|Go ahead.||LMP|One of the questions we asked ourselves years ago, when we mapped the Copernicus area, was were we really seeing dark mantling deposits on some of the massifs of the Carpathians, and looking at it obliquely here, it - some of those areas that we've mapped as dark mantling are distinctly brownish gray versus the normal tan gray of the - of most of the Carpathians. It looks like - and it's about the same color as - extrapolating - as the dark mantle around Sulpicius and Taurus-Littrow.||CC|Roger.||LMP|Also, the north boundary of the Carpathian Massifs has a very sharply defined high lava marks - and if||||Tape 154/4|||||that's actually what we're seeing. And in - I'll mark the place on the map, but it looks like it extends about a sixth to an eighth of the way up the highest peak. It's quite a striking and obvious mark. There's a major textural change -below the mark of a little scarp that defines it, the texture is very smooth. Above that it has the lineated and typical mountain front texture for the Apennine - for the Imbrium range.||CC|Roger.||LMP|Bob, I might summarize my impression of the rilles in the vicinity of Euler and their relationship to the mare ridges. I've been able to, over the last day - just generally searching it out, I've been able to find rilles that clearly cross and separate portions of ridges. And ridges that clearly cross and partially bury rilles. And in another third case, a rille that appears to be levied - that is, have banks of - flat banks on either side, but near the end of it, it transitions into a mare ridge, very clearly. It looks as if, to me, that the rille and ridge problem in here is just one of repetitive compression and extension within the surficial flows of the Imbrium Basin. And that possibly during the compressive stages, there were extrusions locally along the ridge system, but in the main part, the ridge systems represent, I think, a doming it looks like just a doming of the mare surface except for these local ridgelike extrusions.||CC|Roger.||LMP|I might also add that the rilles, to me, seem to be made up of zigzag straight line segments rather than being truly sinuous. They appear sinuous because of the rounding of the corners, but in -my Impression is that they're really made up of straight line segments.|09 13 22 43|CMP|And, Houston, on mag Victor Victor - Oh - well, I'm on number 23 now, and the last ones before 23 there were taken of the spacecraft sunset terminator.||||||Tape 154/5||CC|Roger, Ron. Jack, we just had a feed-in to your answer to your question from ALSEP. The PI has not seen enough data at this time to draw any conclusions regarding the depth of the mantle in the landing area. And we've got another bomb charge due to go off here in about - a short time; let me check it.||LMP|Okay, I'll wait until we get back. Thank you.||CC|Roger.||CC|That next charge goes off in 15 minutes, Jack. I don't have an exact GET yet.||CDR|Bob, is the LCRU still working?||CC|Say again, please.||CDR|Bob, this is Geno. I was just wondering if the LCRU and the TCU were still working?||CC|They think the LCRU failed last-night.||CC|Gene, they are going to try it again today, but they could not get a - raise it last night and they think it failed.||CDR|Okay.||CC|We'd like AUTO on the HIGH GAIK, please.|09 13 34 54|LMP|Houston, 17.||CC|Go ahead.||LMP|Has Mark come up with a preliminary heat flow number yet or is he still equilibrating?||CC|We'll check that, Jack.||CC|Jack, nothing on that - the heat flow yet. It's still stabilizing, It'll be awhile before they get many data. But we're watching the data play out here on the TV screen. They ^ust had another one of those charges go off and it really does rap the old heaters.||||Tape 154/6||||LMP|Excellent.|09 13 38 50|CDR|Houston, MAPPING CAMERA is OFF; and the IR's OFF; PAN CAMERA SELF TEST, OFF; UV is OFF; and the DATA SYSTEM'S OFF; and SM/AC POWER is OFF.||CC|Okay, we - I think we copy that configuration change there. We're about 6 minutes to LOS. Just - on the next pass, just be advised, we're going to change the HF antenna retract times to let them warm up a little bit more. We'll call you on that before we want the HF antennas retracted. And just an update, it's Miami 10 to nothing over Baltimore at the half.||CDR|Okay, we'll stand by on a call on the retraction and got the score 10 to nothing.||CDR|Hello, Houston; America. When do want us to configure the DSE? Do you want us to wait a couple minutes?||CC|Roger. We'd like you to wait a couple minutes.||CDR|Okay, we'll stand by for your call on DSE and the HIGH GAIN.||CMP|Houston, America; are you giving any odds on the time we might get the barber pole on the lunar sounder?||CC|We don't think you'll get it this group but that pad is now about a 4-minute pad. But it's getting so close I'd like to watch it.||CMP|Okay.||CC|America, if we should lose you before our published LOS here, check the DSE and when you get the barber pole, you can reconfigure. We're rewinding that tape now.||LMP|Yes, sir.||CC|Gkay; it's all rewound. You can go ahead ana configure the DSE.||||||Tape 154/7||CMP|Eey, Bob, what about us configuring high gain.

Okay, on mag Q, Quebec - it's finished right now, and whatever frame number it was on when they left the lunar surface to 143. Q? Oh, K. Mag Kilo, okay. Whatever frame they were on on the lunar surface to 143 were selected shots by the LMP. Frame 143 to 172 were near-side terminator photos of Ts i olkovsky.||CC|Okay, Ron.

And let me give you some words here that you might be interested in. Right now we're looking at probably pulling in those antenna at 233:45 or 46, right in that time frame. If those maneuvers - that should not work, we shall have to jettison the antennas at around 234:3 - 235:39. We have, and we won't give it to you until we need It. We have a VERB 49 maneuver to a jett attitude for 234:25, and that'll keep in that attitude and then we'll jettison the antennas at 235:43, and, of course, we'll have to bring up the logic power on those. We have this all available standing by and there's no sense passing it until we find out how the antennas do on RETRACT.||CMP|Okay, that sounds reasonable. Do you have the, cr you want to use, the page in the Experiments Checklist there?||CC|Roger. Except for the NOUN 78s. We'll change those.||CMP|Oh, okay. Sounds good.||CMP|It's in the Volkswagen pocket. Okay.|09 14 36 05|CMP|I don't think we ever changed it though. Okay, the arrow's there, which indicates that ve didn't do it. Okay, LI0H canister change, 19 into A, take 17 and put it into A - A-4. That's correct.|09 14 37 17|CMP|At 24, we want the pan camera.||LMP|Bob, while we're waiting for the pun e user a , a quickie here. One of the ways that seems be useful for determining the relative age of he larger basins, to me anyway, is the abundance of block fields on the slopes of the walls or the||||||Tape 155/3|||slopes of the central peaks. That abundance decreasing with increasing age, and one of the comparisons that I just made that it looks as if Tsiolkovsky and Sklodowska have about the same abundance of - of block fields on both those features of the crater.||CMP|Okay ...||LMP|They presumably then would be about the same age.||CC|Roger, Jack. I noted that.||CMP|Jack, to me, Sklodowska is lot more subdued, though, than Tsiolkovsky on the ... Oh, okay. It's ... criteria? Yes.|09 14 30 48|CMP|And, Houston, the northern portions - I hate to use mud impact, but that's what I'll call it, multiring basin structure there and it also has a delta-shaped rim to it. There is kind of a moat between the inner ring and the outer ring and then it slopes, again a gradual slope from the center of the crater up to the first basin ring and with a steeper slope on the outside of the first ring going down into the moat. And then the outer ring has the delta - the delta-shaped rim to it.||CC|Roger. Ron, we copy that.||CMP|Okay, 4 minutes to - and, Bob, you'll keep us honest on this pan camera T-start, won't you?||CC|I sure will.||CMP|Okay; thank you.|09 14 41 30|CMP|And, Houston, Surgeons r.ay be interestea to know CMPs blue bag number 5 was comparable to ground test number 3.||CC|Roger, Ron.||CMP|I think I should probably add a no problems note.||||Tape 155/4||||CC|Understand, no problem.||CMP|That's affirmative (laughter). The LMP would like to make a comment, but I won't let him.||CC|Things pretty miserable up there?||CMP|For a while it was.||CC|Ground test bag number 3 wasn't the one you had to drive in with, was it?||CMP|Yes .|09 14 43 27|CC|You're 30 seconds to T-start time on that pan camera.||CMP|Okay, PAN CAMERA to OPERATE at 07. Jack, I'll give you a mark on that.||CMP|Okay, 1, 2, 3, start at 7, 4, 5, 6 -|09 14 44 12|CMP|MARK it. Okay, stop will be 38:42. And, Houston, how would you like to have a VERB 74?||CC|Roger; we're standing by for it.|09 14 44 30|CMP|Okay, VERB 74 ENTER.||CMP|Now take a good - Yes, I got a picture cf one of those with - that star is kind of a classic, I think. Can you get it? I can get It right here, a lot easier, Jack. Yes, that's all right, I can do it. Lay down beside it. There we go. That's 8 at 1/250; that'll be good. Okay, is that what we call Star? Okay, that's right, I didn't think this was Star. That's the one I was talking about having the polygonal base on it and it's west of Mare Smythii for sure. I don't know where we -directly south of - eastern edge of Fecunditatis. And that's frame number l4, I guess, of mag Papa Papa.||||||Tape 155/5|09 14 47 10|CC|Ron, if you'll give us ACCEPT, we'll give you your TEI REFSMMAT.|09 14 47 17|CMP|Outstanding. You have ACCEPT.||LMP|And, while we are getting a TEI REFSMMAT, there's a fairly striking graben on the very north edge of Fecunditatis, south of Crisium - just south of Crisium. And it starts in the west within the Fecunditatis Mare and then curves gradually up through the Sculptured Hills structure to the north. And, there's a crater, looks like a subdued impact crater, right on that structure, and you can see the trace of the graben down the walls - the west wall of the crater and up the east wall. And it does - from directly overhead, it appears to taper downward. The walls of the graben, that is, get closer together as it approaches the bottom of the crater. And on the south wall of the graben, as exposed in the west wall of the crater, there's a fairly sharp -sharply defined white area in the talus.|09 l4 48 54|CC|America, the computer's yours; you can go to BLOCK.||CMP|Okay, we're in BLOCK.||LMP|With the old pan camera running, we probably can find that graben structure in there pretty well.||CMP|Yes, we ought to get some good pictures. It isn't quite as good that way, but you-do get some pictures anyhow.||CMP|That's what I was trying to figure out., Houston, what's that big crater we're going over right now in Fecunditatis? It's probably on your map - Yes, Taruntius, that's it. Yes.||LMP|Speaking of grabens again - how's our pun camera doing?||CMP|3&, and we still got 16.||||Tape 155/6|||09 14 50 51|LMP|Speaking of grabens again, on the southeastern blanket of Taruntius, about a crater radius outward, there's a crater looks like an impact also on a trace of a graben, and in this case the ejecta blanket that extends out along the graben both to the west and to the east is noticeably blue gray against the tan gray of the Fecunditatis or at least the Taruntius ejecta blanket. Basically, it looks like blue-gray wings on the crater along the direction of the graben.||CC|Roger, Jack.||LMP|Looking at the crater stratigraphy in the northeastern and northern portions of Tranquility, it looks as if you could say that there are blue-gray mare materials overlying very light gray material of some kind. And without any strong exceptions that I've seen and it resembles the same stratigraphy that I think I talked about yesterday on the annulus of Serenitatis and that goes alor.g with what I think Ron told you, that the visual appearance of the annulus and the northern Tranquility Mare, on the surface is indistinguishable .||CMP|Yes, that's right.||LMP|It also suggests that the mare in here's relatively thin if you're getting down to whatever the basement rock is and that's being represented by the light gray. The legends [?] of the blue-gray material are high up in the crater ana really appear to form only about - oh, a fifth to a sixth of the wall height. And I'll give you a crater -There's a crater right between the two Cauchy rilles that shows this fairly well. And Ross Crater also shows it a little farther along, I remember from last time.||CMP|Cauchy Crater, isn't it?||LMP|Yes, Cauchy Crater is the one I was talking about tnat' s Detween the two ri]__Les * Actua_^j_y 5 it's not as well defined in Cauchy as it is in seme of the other craters.||||||Tape 155/7|09 14 54 58|LMP|The western end of the Cauchy rilles, both north and south ones, seem to have a right lateral or echelon structure, but along the trace still to the west of the crater Cauchy that locally changes to left lateral.||CMP|And, Houston, even at the high Sun angle here, the ejecta of the - oh, four or five recent craters around Maraldi, still kind of a bluish-gray, light-bluish-gray. The floor of the crater Maraldi is essentially a dark - more of a dark gray today, I guess, than anything. And the ejecta patterns on that are the same albedo and color distinctions as the ones in the landing site. And, the landing site itself, from this angle, I think is going to - No, once we get up at the same viewing angle as we had on Maraldi , the mantling material in the landing site is the same color, same albedo as Maraldi.||CC|Roger.||CMP|... in the crater Maraldi.|09 14 56 51|CMP|Yes, I get just a tint of - yes, I was going to say, well no, I still get a feeling that there's just a twinge of the orange or tannish orange around Shorty looking at it with the binocs. What's that black bump on the sides - on the -Let's see, south of the southern side of the South Massif. Can you see that one, Jack?||CMP|Okay, we ought to be getting ready for ?38. About another minute, Jack. PAN CAMERA to STANDBY. At 38:42.||CMP|Okay, 35 now and we want to stop it at 4^. Okay.|09 14 58 44|CMP|MARK it. Okay.||CC|America, we'd like AUTO on the HIGH GAIK.|09 14 58 56|CMP|AUTO it is.||||Tape 155/8||||CC|Ron, the numbers on magazine RR show that you have nine spare frames and you will need nine frames there for calibration, so looks like you'11 have nine frames on mag RR for whatever you want to use them on.||CMP|Okay, let's see now.

Okay, and Tsiolkovsky, we got those the last time with, on the LM mag is that correct?|09 15 00 28|CMP|Hey, Jack, ve want to get D-Caldera to high Sun here too. And then, yes, and then the crater with the dike in it, because I think we probably should get those - Yes, Papa Papa, yes. And then as soon as you finished with those, we'll switch mags and I'll whip over there and take some terminator photos. Okay, let's see. Hey, Houston, you sure you want to start retracting the antennas?||CC|Oh, stand by, Ron. Just to answer your question on mag Romeo Romeo, you can take it to an absolute number of 106 on the frame count, and the remainder must be used for calibration.||CMP|Okay, then 106 is far as we can go on that one. Okay. Thank you.||CMP|Fine. Okay.||CC|America, Houston. After we start the pa:: camera at 233:48:15, we would like then to go ar.d 3tart to retract HF antenna number 2.

Yes, I think.|09 15 04 58|LMP|Okay, Houston, on Papa Papa frames - let's see -13 and l4 were of the crater with the red, brown to orange vein across it and 15 and lo were of D-Caldera, stereo pairs.||CMP|See your dark slide, Jack.||LMP|And, Houston, I saw at least two other examples of impact craters in the highlands south of Serenitatis and south of the Sulpicius area that had veinlike distribution of red, brown, or orange material in them.||CC|Roger.||CMP|And for terminator, but you want to handle the re -retract of the antenna? No, not yet. Soon as the - at 48:15, go to pan camera to operate. Yes, and then we start retracting HF number 2. Oh heck, I cut my finger on the dark slide. Boy, that son of a buck. Yes. That's right. Yes, we'll time it through to start with HF number 2. 3e 8:15, 47:15s 47 twice. And, let's see, where does this thing start? 52, I guess.

No, that's number 1 on your side.|09 15 10 10|CMP|That's the one - we had trouble getting it out, the second time, and finally did. Just took a long time to get out there.

See, just this side of that little - the short one.||CMP|Okay, give me a holler on that pan camera when it comes up because I'm going to be taking pictures here; f/8 at 1/250. Boy, it really shows up a flow from the Tobias Mayer area coming on out to - I don't know whether - is that the Bessel Rille or something like that? I don't know what that Rille is. I agree with you, Jack, in that whatever||||Tape 155/12|||||that rille is, that's running east and west there - made up of linear segments, except for the curves around the corner (laughter).||CMP|Yes, I think that's Prinz on up there just - Yes, see there. Can you get them back there?||CDR|Yes.||CMP|Here, take it. Should - should be - Oh, the lowest one?||CDR|Yes, on your right-hand side.||CMP|Oh, well, let me get these first then.

We haven't told you about this, but we noticed a failure during the last operation of the par. camera, of the stereo. It's completely failed and, so - when you go to OPERATE, which is about 7 minutes after AOS, after TEI, you car. expect to get - a barber pole after three frames r.a'/e cycled through. Want you to just ignore that ana let her run. We figure you have 2 minutes of film left, but we won't be able to monitor||||||Tape 156/7|||end of film, because you'll be on TV on the FM. So we're going to limit the pan camera operation to 5 minutes total, and we'll be able to give you the mark -when to turn it off after the 5 minutes. Over.||CDR|"Okay, Gordo. At 237 in the Flight Plan, where it's ""PAN CAMERA, OPERATE,"" we'll ignore the barber pole. We'll run for 5 minutes and we'll shut it down on your cue."||CC|That sounds good.|09 17 16 28|LMP|Okay, Houston. The PAN CAMERA is going to BOOST. And also, we're presently configured with the IR, ON and the COVER, OPEN. Apparently Flight Plan neglected to have us turn it off, or are we supposed to burn with it open?||CC|Let me cheek that.||CC|America, Houston. We'd like the IR cover closed to keep the Sun out of it.||CMP|Okay, and you want the instrument off?||CC|Negative, Leave the IR on and I - I'll get back to you in a minute on all these covers.|09 17 18 01|LMP|Okay, Gordy. Cover's closed and we'll wait your further word.||CC|America, Houston. On the covers, we want all three covers closed, according to the pre-SPS burn cue card. The instruments, the IR and UV, keep running, until after TEI, when you open the covers and back up per the Flight Plan. Over .|09 17 19 39|LMP|Okay, we'll do that and going OMNI Delta.||LMP|Houston, our last view this time around is the Sun rising over the Aristarchus Plateau and with the Prinz rilles and generally a continuation of the striking views we've had up to now.||CC|Roger.||||Tape 156/8||||LMP|We'll leave this country - this part of this planet for the next group to explore, I guess.|09 17 27 52|CC|America, Houston.

Understand America is GO for TEI ana I'll give you a confirm on the star here, in just a second.||CC|Okeydoke.||CDR|Say, Gordo, I'm - I got the Moon now in the telescope, be just a little bit before I can give you a confirm on that, but the DAP is set.||CMP|Okay; we'll go ahead and go into P40.||LMP|Houston, 17.||CC|Go ahead.||LMP|Gordy, could you give me a summary of what your expectations are on the operation of the PUC-S?||CC|Okay, just a minute.||CC|Jack, Houston. We expect you'll need decrease throughout the whole burn. However, we'd like you to control it as required, to keep it in the green band.||LMP|Okay. And why do you expect that, Gordy? I missed one of the burns.||CC|Just - just the way it's worked from past history, that's what we expect this time.|09 17 31 36|LMP|Okay.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 157/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|09 17 34 43|CDR|Okay, Houston we're down to 6 minutes in the checklist, except for a star sextant check.||CC|Okay, Gene.||CC|Jack, Houston, with a further word or. the PUGS.

We suggest you stay in DSCRiiASE for the first 25 seconds or so, until it stabilizes before you start controlling it.||LMP|Roger, Gordy.||CDR|Houston, the star sextant check is GO.||CC|Roger.||CC|America, Houston. About 2 minutes until LOS. One reminder about the DSE: we'd like you to go to LOW BIT RATE just prior to LOS as per the Flight Plan. And then go back to HIGH BIT RATE at 6 minutes prior to ignition per your burn cue card and you can just leave it in HIGH BIT RATE from there on through AOS.

And it's some of the striking country of the far aide of the Moon that human beings don't very often have a chance to see, but a trend's been started in the last few years, and I suspect it will continue.||CC|Roger, Jack.||CMP|Gordy, America performed superbly.||CC|America, Houston. We need PAIS CAMERA OPERATE, now.||LMP|Thank you. PAN CAMERA going to OPERATE.||CC|And can you verify that you got the other SIM bay items that precede that?||LMP|We're verifying that right now.||LMP|Okay, Gordy.

And for - for your - -||CC|- - if you can figure out a way to hold it a little steadier, that would help, but we're getting good resolution.||CDR|Okay, Gordo, I'm working on it. You'd think a guy that's been there for however many days we've been there could find it, don't you?||CMP|When you see Tsiolkovsky south, the central peaks form an arrow that points south, C-ordy.||CC|America, Houston.

And climbing out like a dingbat.||LMP|Frames 5 through 20 were taken on mag Papa Papa, at that altitude.||CC|Okay, Ron.||CMP|There's Smythii down there. I finally figured out where we are. Right down underneath the window. I can see it now.||LMP|Gordy, as far as we can, we'll try to run you a little bit along the orbital track. I'll be panning the camera more or less westward. Tsiol-vosky starting and Tsiolkovsky is itself in the crater Fermi, and moving on to the east, the next big pair of craters that we spent some time studying is Hilbert, which is just south, is right there, and just a little bit northwest of there is Pasteur.|||Oh, Roger, Jack.||||||Tape 157/5||LMP|Both Hilbert and Pasteur appear to be very old basins, much older than Tsiolkovsky and. they have, as yon can see, a fill in them, apparent fill -very flat looking at this distance, end very light colored. It's an event on the Moon of which wo have relatively little understanding ax. this ti:r.e._, but possibly the Apollo I6 results, when they're fully known, through the analysis of the samples and other data, may shed some light on that event.||CC|Roger, Sorry to - -||CDR|Hey, look here - ... - -||CC|- - interrupt, but we'd like PAN CAMERA, 0FF; now. PAN CAMERA. STANDBY, rather.||CDR|- - That's a full circle.|09 18 30 08|CDR|Okay, STAICDBY, Mow we're going to be able to pan a little bit aore east now of Pasteur and start to show the crater Smythii, the basin Smythii really. It's one of the older large basins on the Moon. It has none of the obvious features of big basins such as Imbrium or Serenitatis. But it's nevertheless roughly circular, has a mare fill, and a very -I'm point right now to the hint of a second ring outside, but the main ring is the one Ron's talked to you a lot about this and has his double-ring craters in it. And we're pointing at some of those right now.||CMP|Uh-huh.||LMP|Okay, Houston, we can now see Tycho. We're seeing probably about 75 to 80 percent, of the entire Moon - face, anyway lit up. The rays of Tycho are very obvious from here. 'want the c amor a over there, Gene?||CDR|Let me show it to them.||CC|We had a good tour there of Smythi i. We reeoj/.r.izca the Smith Brothers» the Wright brothers and started to see Neper before you left, it,||CMP|So.||||Tape 157/6||||CDR|No?||CMP|No.||LMP|No, you won't see Tycho for a little bit.|09 18 32 35|LMP|You can - Langrenus is now visible at the edge of Fecunditatis there, if you want to show that one.||CDR|Just this side of Fecunditatis?||LMP|And Humboldt is a crater that ought to show up very well on the television. That's the cracked floor crater there with a little dark mare.||CDR|Okay.||LMP|There's all the swirls in Marginis. You can really see them now.||LMP|Oh, yes. Why don't you get -||CMP|Yes. Can you get some of the swirls - -||LMP|Okay. Early in our orbit, and particularly Ron, he had the chance to work on the question of these light-colored swirls and Marginis has outstanding examples of them and I'll try to get the camera pointed on those in the northern part of Marginis. Let me orient you, as soon as we're focused here. Okay - Smythii - I'll point right at the center of Mare Smythii, and then move up towards Neper and then into the swirl area a little bit more north. And Gene will zoom you in and let you see what some of that looks like. I don't think we have a full answer at what the swirls are, but some of the things that we saw in Taurus-Littrow and later from orbit around Sulpicius Gallus may suggest to people, from now on, that the possibility of alteration from fluids in the interior of the Moon is more than just a possibility.|09 18 34 38||PiOger. That's a nice shot there of Marginis.||LMP|Can you see the swirls, Gordy? Are the very diffused, light-colored areas that cross various topographic features?||||||Tape 157/7||CC|That's affirmative, Jack. They're visible from here.||CDR|Okay. I'm going to give you an end-on view, if 1 can, of Mare - of the Crisium Basin. You should be seeing that now.||CMP|How is that, Gene?||CC|That's a good picture of Crisium as it is very evident on the right side of our picture.||LMP|Yes, that's right. And before long, we'll be able to show the landing site and Taurus-Littrow and I think you probably see Proclus, which is the bright crater just off the horizon now. That's the one with the excluded ray zone on its western or southwestern side.||CMP|It's not in view yet.||LMP|We may not see it, I think we're going the other way.||CDR|Right in the horizon. The landing area, Taurus-Littrow, and the edge of the Serenitatis Basin is probably just on the horizon now and I'm not sure it exactly - -||CMP|You can see the dark part of Serenitatis is sticking out of the Sea of Proclus the ray-excluded zone. No, that's Fecunditatis sticking up there, isn't, it? Because the ray perpendicular to our track now points right to the landing site right off of Proclus.||LMP|The area where one of the Russian vehicles set down and returned samples from is just about in the center of your field of view now. Just on the north side of Fecunditatis.||CC|Roger. And you're about 1300 miles up right now.||CDR|Wow! That's not a bad climb is It, Gordy?||CC|Pretty gooa rate.||||Tape 157/8||||CDR|"A friend of mine says ""Wow voozle!"""||CMP|Looking out window - window 3 now, and the Moon is just the size of the window, and I've got my face right up against the window.||CDR|Or maybe his head's just the size of the Moon. We're not sure which.||CMP|(Laughter) That's right.||CDR|I don't know what's happening down there now, Gordy, but this is where the action was one time.|09 18 37 25|CDR|Okay, we're starting to, I think, in a little bit, be able to show you the edge of the Serenitatis Basin. It's moving a little slowly right now. It looks like it's creeping over the horizon.||CMP|It's going to creep over the horizon, maybe, but I think - -||CDR|But I'll tell you what's on the horizon now. I'm not sure I can get it. Let me try the rendezvous window. I think I can show them Apollo 11's landing site.||LMP|You can probably get it at the south portion of Tranquillity there, if you - out the center window would be better.||CMP|Yes, the center window, you could get it.||LMP|See the southern part of Fecunditatis, and then the Tranquillitatis takes off to the west there, Gene, right along that southern edge of Fecunditatis is where Apollo 11 set down.||CDR|Yes, and a little bit north of the line that - of the ray of those two craters.|09 18 38 47|LMP|Okay, Gordy, in the center of your picture is -about right in there, ~ is the southern edge of Tranquillity and the Apollo 11 area and that was the ground track, of course, for ApoI_o c and Apollo 10.||||||Tape 157/9||CC|Roger.||LMP|Yes, we'll put you back on Langrenus, which is one of the Copernican-age craters, in this part of the Moon, and I believe it was Apollo 12 had .an excellent opportunity for some several orbits to study Langrenus.||CC|Roger. We see that. It stands out like a beacon there, on the right side of the picture, and we also saw Messier with its rays.||LMP|Okay, our landing site's in view now, Gene,||CMP|You're a little bit off the field - let me move -you're almost out of the field here. Let's see -Proclus -||LMP|Our landing area is just about in the center of your field of view right at the horizon now.||CC|Roger.||LMP|That's the best focus we've got, Gene.||CDR|Okay, full zoom, and right in that region in the center should be the landing site of Apollo 17-Known, hereafter, I guess, as the Taurus-Littrow area.||CC|You're now 1500 miles above the surface, and your climb rate was just computed at 295 000 feet per minute.||CMP|(Chuckle) That is really moving out.||LMP|Sure glad they cleared the traffic out of the way. Let me - Gene, let me switch over briefly and show them the Ncrtfc and South Poles, which nobody really has done much with yet, except for Lunar Grbiter , and some of the Russian vehicles. There's a spectacular valley off - on the South Pole. I don't know the name. It looks like one of these long chain of - - chain of craters.||CDR|Does that snow up? Let me try it with - let r.e try some of these others. Well, oh, here's where it goe s .||||Tape 157/10||||LMP|Okay, Houston, we're in - -||CDR|Huh? Good picture?||LMP|That's in the south polar regions. There's a -I think you can probably see a long chain of craters, which so far unvisited by man. In fact, the whole region has, and that goes for the north pole.||CC|Roger, Jack. That's very interesting. Can you zoom in on that whole valley?||LMP|I think that's the best we got, Gordy, That's full zoom.||CC|Roger.||LMP|It's one of the biggest crater - chain crater valleys that I've seen on the Moon. It - we saw some crossing Mendeleev, in the first few days, I think we talked about, similar in shape but not nearly as big.||CC|Roger.||LMP|Let me move over briefly to give you another view of Humboldt, which should show up very well now. We're just about directly overhead. It's unusual - one of the few craters on the Moon that have a fairly flooded floor , and appears to have been domed, and you probably can see some of the cracks in that floor.||CC|Okay, it's in the center of the field now; however, something is blocking the right side of the view.||CDR|How1s that ?||CC|That's real good now.||LMP|Around the edge of the dome floor, you cun see oome of the dark mare which is prevalent elsewhere ir. the region but not so abundant within Kuriiboia.t..||CC|Roger.||CDR|And yea - you - you can see - if you can see -. Check it .. „||||||Tape 157/11||LMP|Langrenus, you mean?||CDR|Tsiolkovsky is ... the terminis.||LMP|Oh, okay.||CMP|Out the window.|09 18 44 47|LMP|Oh, all right. Hey, there's another view, if you will bear with us, of our old friend Tsiolkovsky, Okay?||CDR|Okay, I got it.||CC|Roger. It's hard to mistake that one.||LMP|Yes, it's one of the more pic - picturesque basins. I guess partly - although it's big, it's not so big you can't look at it all at once. Symthii and Crisium and Serenitatis and Imbrium, in particular, are hard to look at ail at once. You're always down inside of them in the 60-nautical-mile orbit.||CC|Roger. Just night mention the diameter for those who are watching at home. That's about l80 miles across, I think.||LMP|(Laughter) Okay. That's pretty good. I was going to say about 200 kilometers, I think, is what it is, but - -||CMP|That's right.||CMP|And, Gordy, of course, it's on a part of the Moon that you - you don't see from where you are.||CC|Roger.|09 13 46 04|LMP|Not yet, anyway.||LMP|Okay, let's see if we can move on along cur orbital track that we've been following and see what's new that's come into view. Once again, I'll pick yon up at Smythii and move you into Mare Marginis, the Margin Sea. And, all the mare, you may recall now, we have pretty good evidence as a result of the Apollo - -||||Tape 157/12||||CMP|Change this ... around.||LMP|- - Program - -||CMP|Good.||LMP|- - that our theories of basalt flows that some 3 to 4 billion years ago, in round numbers, were erupted on the Moon and filled many of the low areas that existed at that time. Not an awful lot has happened to the Moon since - except for the impact craters, some of the younger ones, since 3 billion years ago, which is one of tee reasons it becomes so interesting to man. It's - the Moon's frozen in a period of history 3 billion years and older, which is a period of history that we cannot recognize very readily on Earth because of the dynamic processes of mountain building and oceans and weathering that are taking place even at the present time. Understanding that early history of the Moon may mean an understanding of the early history of the Earth. And, I think we're well on our way to a first-order understanding of that history as a result of the Program. Okay, going to take you a little bit farther along. Again, to Proclus, which is the obvious partially rayed crater with a big excluded aone to the southwest. There's Mare Fecunditatis and its contact area with the Sea of Serenity, Mare Serenitatis; and the landing site now has to be just about on the horizon. I think we were a little premature before.||CC|Roger.||CMP|Yes, we were. That's Macrobius A and 3 just beyond Proclus, there- Yes. that's really Macrobius - -||LMP|Sow, you're starting to - just to see the Mare of Serenitatis come over the horizon ~ -||CMP|Yes.||LMP|— — and, ti you taKe a —ine 1to.t. rroc*u£ oet/.een the two bright craters - -||CMP|You're not going to get more of the Xoon vs ilcLVG SpctC 0 ^0 jT10jT0 »||||||Tape 157/13||LMP|Yes, yes. How's that?||CMP|That's better.||LMP|Take that line, and that will take you just about to the landing area, right at the edge of the next big mare that you see.|09 18 49 08|CC|Okay, Jack, we can follow that just as you told us there. Those three craters are very obvious.||LMP|The site, Gordo, is now just to the left - left and a little below center of your picture.||CC|Roger.||CDR|You can see that ridge of mountains that sticks out and the landing site is - well, from here, anyway, right in that area.||LMP|Right, I guess my line was a little bit north of where we actually should have pointed you. There's some dark area just showing up around the edge of Serenitatis on the horizon. I think that will show in your picture as I remember some of these from Apollo 10 before. And it's just this side of the dark area that the Taurus-Littrow area sits , in the mountains, there.||CC|We think we have Maraldi in sight now.||LMP|Yes, and you also - -||CDR|Yes. They should.||CMP|Yes. You should.||LMP|- - Vitruvius should be visible to you just to the south of the landing area.||CDR|Vitruvius is in the monitor, so they should have it.|09 18 51 08|CDR|Jack, I think you got a good view. You can see Censorinus now. You can probably get a real good shot at the 11 site at ...||LMP|Yes, you're right.||||Tape 157/14||||CDR|There's old Censorinus. It's awful big.||CC|How big is it, Geno?||CDR|Okay, towards the southern border of - {-aughter}. Okay. Old Censorinus Is right in the diddle of the screen.||CC|We see it.||CDR|You've been there before.||CC|Right.||CC|17, Houston. You've just passed 2000 miles.||LMP|2000 miles. We've got about a 95-percent full Moon in front of us. Not toe far - matter of fact, I think the Apollo 16 landing area would be just about on the horizon, to the south of Tr&nquilli-tatis. And back up to something that's dear and near to our hearts. You norobably now can pick out the mountains, the North and South Massif, if you really look closely. What do you think, Gene, from the monitor? Can they see that?||CDR|I can't even see the Massifs with the naked eye. No.||LMP|See the dark area there next to ... - -||CDR|I know where - Yes. I know where to look. But it's awful hard to pick them out. But you're looking right at it. You've got it right - Just to the left center. It's just about perfect, the landing site. There's a little dark area in that peninsula of mountains that sticks out and the site is just about right in that area.||CC|Roger, Gene, as you say - -||LMP|I wish we could show you - -||CC|- - we know where to look, out it's hard to ccn-idrm exactly the structure taere.||LMP|Come on, you guys, 1 can even see the lid.-tt rtantle.||||||Tape 157/15||CDR|Extrapolation is the nature of our art.||CC|I just saw a flash, Jack.||LMP|I wish we could - Okay. I didn't hear them. 3ay again.||CC|I just saw a flash.||LMP|(Laughter) I wish we could show you some of the color we see on the Moon this trip, but 1 think we're a little too far away from it. We'll see if we can ... back in ... from here.||CC|We - we've been looking for that crater - -||LMP|Well, I can show you a picture of the commander. He's fairly colorful.||CDR|That's about what we're seeing, Gordy. I can't give you the bottom half because I can't quite move around the post here.||CC|Geno, we're getting a great picture ... 50 percent of it.||CDR|You getting the whole movie? I'll get it. Okay, 1 think you can orient yourself with the big basins Jack's been talking about. There's Crisium. You can see the landing site up in the - what is to me the upper left-hand corner of the picture, but you can pick it out by now, I know. Get a better relationship. You're looking at the Langrenus, down there, that bright eraser. You ought to be able to see Humboldt. Maybe Jack can give you the whole thing.||LMP|.. . this in.||CDR|Need to get the whole thing.||LMP|Yes. He said minimum zoom.||CDR|Yes. It's put on the ... Okay, that's pretty good, it's centered just about right in the center. It ought to fit your screen as we climb cut. Just about tangential now.||CC|That's perfect right where you got it.||||Tape 157/16|||09 18 56 22|CDR|Okay, we'll hold that for a minute. -The terminator is coming across, of course, at the opposite s Lc.e of the Moon from the big basin you're locking at.||CC|Roger.||MCC|Geno, what color does that nare look like to you?||CDR|What color does the nare look like to me fro:.; aere?||MCC|Right.||CDR|Now, I'm a commander; do I have the right to change my mind? (Laughter)||MCC|I guess so.||CDR|Ton, you know I always thought you could almost make it look whatever color you wanted to, it's so subtle. But the mare - the mare., to me, has got a grayish - a dark grayish mixed witn a vary subtle tan, and that's what it looks like to me, from here.||MCC|Roger.||CMP|This is the CMP. I agree with that.||CDR|The tan is sort of like a dusted tan in spots ir. and around and on the mare. I'd say that the basic - if I could pick out a chunk of that gray mare from here, I would pick out a very steel gray -a dull steel-gray color, but if I just took a mass of mare out, I'd have to mix it with a subtle -very, very subtle pastel tan,||CDR|That's perfect. You can see Tsiolkovsky mow ir. tr.e terminator, down there. I think Jack'£ 0ust about got the Moor, centered perfect. You got Tsiolkovsky on one end; the big basin's on the other ena. how high are we, Gordy?||CC|... gray. Okay, you're 2327 raises.||CDR|You know, I think it's worth noting, while wc'ri locking back at the entire Moon as we see ix. hare and you're seeing it there, that America eculu he||||||Tape 157/17|||proud of the Apollo heritage it's left here. I know we in the program believe that it's really and truly been a heritage that will prove itself to be one of the ben - most beneficial things that have happened to mankind in quite some time, although none of us can really predict the future. But I think everyone that has been part of this program has been proud of its accomplishments. I know we have. We're looking back at someplace, I think, we will use as a stepping stone to go beyond some day. And those aren't words. It's a faith I truly and dearly have. And I think we will all see it in our lifetime, not just as a nation, but as a world. I think the Apollo Program not only has given us the first steps to that sort of impossible dream, but has given us an opportunity to make the first steps in bringing a world together as one unit, so that we can make that step together. It's been a privilege sharing the program - that part of it that we've been in with as many people as we have and as many people as we can, because I've often thought and I've often said before that anything that's worthwhile doing and doing well, is certainly worthwhile sharing with others. This is history being made in our time5 while you and I are alive, not 100 years ago or 1000 years ago„ and it's sort of the real thing happening right now. You're living it, not just us. We hope that you're getting as much out of it, not just feeling of pleasure and excitement, but that of accomplishment, as we are.|09 19 00 26|CC|Thank you, Gene. Speaking for the ground, as part of the Apollo Team, we second those thoughts, which you put very well.||CDR|Well, Gordy, it's not cur accomplishment. It's the accomplishments of a nation. And I think the next set of accomplishments are the accomplishments of mankind.||LMP|Gordy, In - in that vein, I think a couple words, I'd like to more or less reiterate what I tried to say as we finished our third EVA, and that vas tnat une va.i_j.ey c Taurus—..iittrow ana toe croit ...i the spaceship America saw the completion of mankind's first steps - first evolutionary steps from||||Tape 157/16|||||the planet Earth into the universe. I thin-'. it's important that in doing so, he established a tradition of peace and freedom within the solar system. From that larger home, now3 we move to greet the future.||CMP|Well, you know, Houston, and America ar.d the world, this is the command module pilot of the spaceship America, and I just feel quite honored and proud to have been a part of this Apollo Program. The Moon, itself, is a magnificent, it's a dynam -well, I hate to use the word dynamic, because it's really not dynamic, but itss a marvelous planet. It has all the wonderful opportunity for exploration. Man must explore. We will continue to explore, and I hope that some day we may all have the opportunity to see mankind enjoy the benefits of the exploration of the Apollo Program.||CC|Thank you very much for the great TV show and the -and your final words. We enjoyed every bit of it.|09 19 03 14|CDR|And, Gordy, with that, we're about behind out timeline, as we fully expected we might be at this point in time, but believe me, it has been s. beginning, it is a beginning, I don't think there ever will be an end, not as long as man is alive and willing.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 158/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION.|09 19 04 32|CC|America, Houston. We didn't have data, of course, while you had the TV on. We're wondering if you configured the SIM bay on our voice call or had you done it earlier? Over.||CDR|"Ho, Gordo. We were late. When you called - I guess ""PAN CAMERA, ON,"" we went back and configured a SIM bay and followed those steps in the Flight Plan that follow ""TV, ON."" We had not done that."||CC|Okay. No problem. We're just - just wondered what we had there.||CDR|Okay, Are we up to date on the SIM bay now, or you satisfied?||CC|No, we're just now getting some data, and taking a look. We'll let you know. Okay. We'll take PAN CAMERA, OFF, now.|09 19 05 42|LMP|Okay. The PAN CAMERA power is OFF.|09 19 06 00|LMP|Okay, Gordy, S-BAND AUX TV is going to SCIENCE.||CC|Roger.||CDR|Gordy, it's going to be hard to leave this attitude, but we're going to maneuver now.||CC|Roger.|09 19 06 59|CMP|And, Houston; America. Mag Delta Delta is empty now. The last 50 percent was used for taking pictures of the TEI.||CC|Okay, Ron.||CDR|Gordo, going back at that burn. It was ah outstanding burn. We were looking about a half a g throughout the burn. She lit off on time. She was a very steady burn. I think she reversed roll a - a couple of times in the dead band. The computer and the EMS were with each other all the way.||||Tape 158/2||||CMP|Chamber pressure on bank A started out at about 37. Bank B brought it up to about 92, 93. And when I first sat down, it was reading 0, now it's reading 5-||CC|Okay, Ron. We got 6 down here.||CDR|Okay, so in all other respects, the burn was nominal, Gordy. You got the burn report and the residuals, and we'll leave the tracking to you.||CC|Roger.||CDR|I might add, I don't think they built spacecraft any better than they built these two.||CC|I don't see how they could have.||CMP|I'll sure second that.||CDR|I finally found what I was looking for. I got the man in the Moon.||CC|Roger.||CDR|For all you nonbelievers, I verify he really is there,||CC|Okay.||CDR|Gordy, these next series of maneuvers - bring us -bring our middle gimbal angle pretty close to the apple [?]. We're watching it, but appreciate -you not hesitating giving us a call, toe.||CC|Okeydoke.||CDR|Gordo. In answer to PP's [?] question about the color of the maria down there, when you look at Serenitatis, of course we saw this earlier, when we were much closer, but when you look at it from up here, it's - it's got on the northeast side, a very - quite thick, laterally across the surface, dark - typically dark with the tannish colors I was talking about - mare - which sort of borders it. But just north of the - the overlap, between Tranquility and Serenitatis, that contact changes sharply to a - the grays are gone - itf;> a very sharp contrast and I think those who have see:, it||||||Tape 158/3|||before will remember it, but Serenitatis from -where we stand is - much more tan dominated, than gray dominated.||CC|Roger.||CDR|Gordo, we'll get those numbers out of the first state vector out of the computer here shortly. No hurry to do it though.||CC|Okay.|09 19 13 51|CDR|Do you have our altitude now? About i+000 miles maybe?||CC|I lost that display. Let me check here.||CDR|No, I'm just trying to relate it to when we were coming in. I'd say it's more like 5.||CC|3100.||CDR|How many?||CC|3100.||CDR|3100. Okay.||CC|America, Houston. Sorry to say that the LCRU has pretty well crumped, evidently. We were talking over the biomed schedule and suggest that with your choice, either Gene stay on it or Jack go on it, and then we'll get back to the Flight Plan rotation after the EVA. Over.||CDR|Okay, I'll stay on it through the EVA. How's that?||CC|Okay, fine.||CDR|And we'll pick - we'll pick Jack and Ron in the morning.||CC|All right.||||Tape 158/4||||LMP|Gordy, this is Jack. I fail to see the correlation between the LCRU crumping and me going on biomed. Don't tell me you were monitoring it on the Surgeon's console, there.||CC|Well, we don't see any correlation either, but we're trying to look for some.||LMP|Okay; let me know when you have an answer.||CC|Okay.||CDR|Houston, America. When you get a hack on - on our track, I'd like to get a first-cut estimate at it.||CC|Okay; will do.||CC|Geno, it'll take about an hour to get a good hack, to get that much tracking. However, earlier, the Retro was betting everybody there wouldn't be any midcourses.||CDR|That's a - that's a good way to feel. Okay, we'll -we'll talk to you In an hour about it.||LMP|Whose the wild man Retro? I don't want to play poker with him.||CC|It's old ... He's a former B-17 pilot. They're -they're always right on.||LMP|Wow you're starting to scare me.||CDR|You can pass the word to Captain Green, back there on the Ti_ to clear the flight decks.||CC|Okay, we'll do it.||LMP|The last time I had anything to do with a bomber pilot, Gordy, he was scheduling my airplane.|09 19 21 28|CDR|Hello, Houston; America.||CC|Go ahead.||CDR|We got PTC orientation in the computer?||||||Tape 158/5||CC|Negative, But we got it ready to come to you, if you give us ACCEPT.|09 19 21 55|LMP|Okay. It's all yours.||CC|Roger.||LMP|Gordy, I'm afraid the weather reports on the way back of the only planet that really has much weather visible, will be a little repetitive.||CC|Jack, we're heartbroken.||LMP|For your for - first report, you can just play the recording back; it's sunny and clear.||CC|Okay.||CC|You're right on that one - -||LMP|The only sign of any weather - -||CC|- - except that you left out the fact that it's -cold also, here.|09 19 23 31|LMP|Gordy, you didn't listen. I can't see the Earth. I'm talking about that other planet.||CC|Okay. Depending on what part you're looking at, it's cold there, too. We got you, though. You got your REFSMMAT, you can go back - -||LMP|There might be traces of an atmosphere - -|09 19 23 56|CDR|Okay, Gordy. We're in BLOCK, and I might give my CMP one more chance at a P52.||CC|Okay.||LMP|Then, the LMP gets to start trying.|09 19 28 24|CDR|Gordy, I can look back and - with the glasses -the binoculars, and I can see the white mantle and see all the massifs in the landing area.||CC|How about that?||||Tape 158/6||||CC|Back when you had the tube on it, I - I really think - I knew we were looking in the right spot, but you know it was just blurry enough that - you couldn't be sure of exactly what you were looking at.|09 19 28 55|LMP|Gordy, let me - since I don't have anything else|||to do right now, apparently, I'll see - tell you a couple of things I see right here. The annulus -the dark annulus around Serenitatis, does not look complete in - in the due-north area. Oh, there're little partial pieces of dark material up there, but the main part of the annulus seems to cross into the mare region that's north of Serenitatis, and I can't remember the name of that right now. But it very clearly crosses right over there as a band and then dies out in that north region.||CC|Roger.|09 19 29 38|CMP|Okay, Houston. There's the torquing angle.||CC|Okay. We copy.||CMP|Okay. And I'll torque at - it looks like -at 238:10. I guess you really don't care, though, do you?||LMP|And, once again, albedowise and hue - color-hue-wise, the - that annulus is the same as at Tranquility, and essentially the same as most of Fecunditatis. The areas - although Tranquility and Fecunditatis are mottled ... with tan colors, the - that mottling seems to be local and, probably in large part, related to rays that cross those -those seas.||CC|Roger.||LMP|At this viewing angle, the dark mantle around Taurus-Littrow area is just a darker shade of blue-gray to me of the annulus, it's a - mere just a medium gray, I guess. Whereas the Sulpicius Gallus dark mantle is a brown-gray, quite distinct in its color hue - to me, at any rate.||CC|Roger.||||||Tape 158/7||CMP|Houston, I can't see any stars out there, so I'm going to false torque it instead of coarse align.||CC|Okay.||CMP|Hopefully, the reason I can is because - cannot -is because the Earth is right in the field of view, and it's still pretty bright.||CC|Roger.|09 19 32 30|CC|America, we've got a little musical selection for you here. Stand by. (Music: Going Back to Houston, by Dean Martin)||CDR|That's very appropriate. I remember that being played one other time after a TEI burn.||CC|Roger. I think it came the other direction that time, didn't it?||CDR|If you stand by, we'll express to you our sentiments here, with a short little tune I think you will enjoy.||CC|Okay; standying by.|09 19 37 26||(Music: God Bless America, by Tennessee Ernie Ford)||CC|Hey, thank you very much. Very enjoyable and also very appropriate.||CDR|It certainly has a twofold meaning for us.|09 19 42 16|CMP|That's about par for the CMP, now.||CC|Ho hum, another all balls.||CMP|(Laught er)||CDR|You hit it right on the money.||CC|Okay; we've got those.||CMP|Okay; and we'll torque at 238:23.||||Tape 158/8||||CC|Roger.|09 19 52 59|CDR|Gordo, I'll maneuver in about 10 minutes.||CC|Okay; fine.|09 19 54 56|CMP|Hey, Houston; America.||CC|Go ahead, Ron,||CMP|You reckon you'd have one of the photo guys down there to figure out when we could get a full Moon with an 80-millimeter lens.||CC|Okay. I'll put them to work on it.||CDR|Okay; appreciate it.|09 19 57 19|LMP|Houston, 17.||CC|Go ahead, Jack.||LMP|On the pan camera, you said to expect to see barber pole when we ran it. I did not see that just for your information. It went barber pole and then gray.||CC|Okay; thank you.||LMP|And, Gordy, several times I have reminded myself to tell you guys something and I keep forgetting. I think it - was yesterday when we did an oxygen purge on fuel cell 3 after about - oh, I think it it was a minute, possibly a minute and a half. The high O2 flow warning was triggered. Normally that is not triggered when we do the purge. That's the one and only time it's happened. This last one, prior to TEI, there was - it was within the green band and there was no fuel cell caution and warning. Just thought you might be interested in that one.||CC|Okay, Jack; thank you.||||||Tape 158/9||CMP|Houston, Ron here. I think I got - that - on fuel cell 3 too in one of my fuel cell purges, when I was up here by myself. Probably shows up on the data anyhow.||CC|Roger.||CDR|And you can tell Farouk that - that crater out on Fecunditatis that I've got a picture of, that we worked on back at the Cape and studied quite a bit, has got all the attributes of everything he told me about it,||CC|Roger.||CDR|Yes, and that's the one - that's the one I was describing on this morning.||CC|Okay.|09 20 00 56|CMP|Also, be advised the inner ring of the - the basin Arabia is quite visible. It looks like there is a - shallow depression outside the inner ring and when you get up at this altitude right around Saenger, it is indeed, it looks like a raised-up plateau crossing Saenger. And, also, in the vicinity is King - King is almost going into the terminator now, well, it's 10 or 15 degrees from the terminator. But you can see a little bit of a raised-up plateau, that takes in the crater King and goes about a crater - a King Crater - a diameter and a half or maybe 2 diameters to the south, and a crater and a half to the north of King.||CC|Roger.|09 20 03 28|CMP|You know, Houston, it's also interesting to note, that the - the range of color, from this altitude and from 60 miles, doesn't seem to change at ail, really. In other words, the same impressions that I had of color in the 60-mile orbit are the same impressions that I have now, of the same areas.||CC|Okay, that's interesting. You're a little over 5000 miles out, at the moment.||CMP|Roger.||||Tape 158/10||||CDR|Gordy, you don't have that number on this millimeter camera, do you? We're going to maneuver and I'd like to get a last shot at it.||CC|Okay. Well, you're far beyond the point where you can cover the whole Moon with an 80. We were just trying to come up with an altitude for filling up the 250, but you'll get the Moon and then some with the 80, right now.||CMP|Okay, that's good. Then we'll take it with the 80.||CC|Roger.|09 20 10 39|CC|America, Houston. At 240:30, you'll be about 10,000 miles out, at which altitude the Moon will just about fill up the 250 lens field of view.||CMP|Oh, okay. 240:30, it looks like for the 250 lens.||CC|Right.|09 20 16 40|LMP|Gordy, are you ready for an omni or you want to wait a little bit?||CC|17, Houston. Gordon's off the console for the moment. We'll wait a couple of minutes on the onmi .||LMP|Okay.||CC|America, Houston. We need OMNI Delta.|09 20 18 38|LMP|Okay. You've got OMNI Delta.|09 20 18 43|CC|Okay.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 159/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION ?|09 20 38 37|LMP|Houston, America.||CC|Go ahead, America.||LMP|Looking at our sketches here and trying to figure out exactly what we're looking at in the dark part of the Earth. I guess it's you and, if it's a clear night, you ought to have a pretty full Moon looking back at you.||CC|That's right we do. In fact, it's nice and clear all day and I could see it as I came in this afternoon. Your subspacecraft point right now is over the Yucatan Peninsula.||LMP|Yes, it's just about the chart I'm looking at, Gordo. Looks'like about right smack in the center.||CDR|Gordy, do you have a general trend on the prediction in the recovery area?|09 20 40 23|CC|I haven't - haven't heard one, but I'll see if we can get one.|09 20 4l 58|CC|America, Houston. The Sun is just about to enter the lens of the mapping camera, and we'd like you to retract it and then close the cover. We're not copying SIM bay data now, so we'd like you to get a MARK on both the start of retraction - give a MARK on the start of retraction and one when barber pole goes to gray.||CMP|Okay. We're going to retract the mapping camera. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 -|09 20 42 32|CMP|MARK it. There - -||CC|Okay.|09 20 42 36|CMP|- - barber pole. And that was at 20 - 22:30.||||Tape 159/2||||CC|Okay, and we want to keep it running to run the film out of it.|09 20 42 48|CMP|Okay, understand.|09 20 45 53|CC|America, Houston. How's the mapping camera talkback look?||CMP|Barber pole.||CC|Okay. We thought it should have been gray by now.||CMP|(Chuckle) Okay, let's see. I've got - we're coming up on 4 minutes.||CC|That's what I've got.|09 20 46 51|CMP|Hey, there we go. Gray.||CC|Okay, thank you.||CMP|Took a while - took a while, but it made it.||CMP|Okay, the COVER has gone CLOSE; barber pole, gray.||CC|Okay, thank you.||CC|America, Houston. Got a couple of answers for you here. On this - the O2 caution/warning indication on the purge, at the time you were pulling 37.8 amps out of fuel cell 3 because the SIM bay was fired up and that'll result in about a flow of 1.37 pounds per hour which - and the trip limit is 1.2, so that's why you got the -the flag on it and you can expect to get the caution/warning anytime you've got 33 amps or more being pulled out of the fuel cells at the time you purge. Over.||CMP|Ah ha, okay. That sounds good, then.||CC|Also, we've tracked you a while now and midcourse 5 looks like a whopping 0.3 of a foot per second at the present time.||||||Tape 159/3||CDR|Beautiful, Gordy, beautiful.||CMP|That is outstanding.|09 20 51 32|CC|America, Houston. In answer to your question about the weather at splashdown, the area right now is 2000 scattered and 10, winds variable at 10. And forecasting the same - 2000 scattered and 10, with 3-foot waves, variable at 10 knots on the wind, and. some rain showers, but less than 10-percent coverage on the rain showers in the area. Over.|09 20 52 05|CDR|Oh, you're full of good news tonight. Thank you.|09 21 08 58|CMP|Houston, America Is about to maneuver.||CC|Okay.|09 21 11 42|LMP|Houston, 17-||CC|Go ahead and give us OMNI Charlie, please, while you're talking.||CC|Also, Jack, we'd like you - -||LMP|Hey, Gordy, this is Jack - since I can't give you - -||CC|-- we'd like H2 TANK 1 FAN, OFF.|09 21 12 18|LMP|Go ahead. TANK 1 FAN is OFF.||CC|Thank you and go ahead.||LMP|Okay, we got all three of them off now. Right, Gordy?||CC|That's affirmative.||LMP|Hello, Gordy.||CC|Hello; go ahead, Jack.||||Tape 159/4||||LMP|Okay, since I can't help you out on the weather right now in the Pacific, can you give me a rundown of what things look like out there?||CDR|I already got it.||LMP|Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't on the loop. Apparently you already briefed somebody on that.||CC|I covered the recovery area. Not the rest of the Pacific. Did you want an overall briefing?||LMP|No. I was just curious what the recovery area looked like, and I'm sure that my compatriots will clue me in on it, if I'm nice to them.||CC|Yes. I'll save them the trouble. It's going to be 2000 scattered, 10 miles, 3-foot waves, variable at 10 knots, and less than 10 percent chance of rain showers. And that's just about what the weather is now, and also forecast.||LMP|Okay. Thank you very much.||CC|Jack, you've got a lot of SIM bay data stored up there that we'd like to get dumped. Can you give us the HIGH GAIN; PITCH, 30; YAW, 320?||LMP|Okay, PITCH, 30; YAW, 320.|09 21 15 19|LMP|Okay, it's the old HIGH GAIN for you.||CC|Thank you, sir.||LMP|Gordy, what altitude are we at now?||CC|Stand by, I'll check. 8500 miles.||LMP|You clipped. Say again.||CC|8500 miles.||LMP|Okay.||||||Tape 159/5|09 21 23 06|CDR|Gordy, as we're maneuvering, I guess we got one of the most spectacular views of the Moon I've ever seen, from a position like this. It's like -just short of being 100 percent full.. We can still see from Tsiolkovsky all the way across the Moon and it's just absolutely magnificent and I'm afraid we're talking here - that the pictures just won't capture the real three-dimensional picture we're looking at. But, uniquely with the binocs I can still see the light mantle in the landing area.|09 21 23 48|CC|Roger, Gene.|09 21 25 07|LMP|Hey, Gordy, I don't know whether your camera people have anything to do this evening, but I've got a little problem for them if they'd like to work on It.||CC|Okay, go ahead.||LMP|Well, it seems to me we're not only moving away from the Moon, but we're moving across the face, and I took a picture about 5 minutes ago of the. Moon, and it seems to me we could take another one at some X-number of minutes and have pretty good stereo if we matched the printing of the two pictures in terms of scale. And, I'm wondering what's a good time elapse here for a good stereo of the whole globe?||CC|Okay, we understand the problem, but I'm not -Well, we'll try.||LMP|Well, I guess, if you could figure out what It would - how far we have to move across the face of the Moon and how long that would take to get about a - oh, shoot, a 30 to 1 base-heighth ratio'd probably be enough - 20 to 1 would probably be better, obviously, but 30 to 1, you could still see the stereo. And you ought to be able to figure that problem out. How fast do - do the guys know how fast we're moving across the face of the Moon?||||Tape 159/6|||09 21 26 41|CC|No, I'll put that one to FDO. Just looking at the big chart up here, I'm sure that the rate is slowing down rapidly, and - because you're - the farther you get away, of course, the straighter away from it you're going. Stand by, I'll see what we can do.|09 21 44 55|CC|Jack, this is Houston with kind of a crude answer to your question.||LMP|Go ahead.||CC|Okay, it turns out right now that you're not moving across the lunar surface very fast, and you - it's getting less and less - right now, I guess it's about a mile per minute. It would take a lot of minutes to get much of a stereo base since you're 10,000 miles out. But, remembering back to Ron's final picture there before you went to the UV attitude, after he asked the question about how high he had to be to fill up the 80-millimeter lens, I think he took one at that time. We're thinking of combining a picture now with that picture, and then enlarging the one to get it to the equivalent diameter. And, some rough calculations of your longitude at that time and then - now, show that you've changed about 21 degrees across the surface of the Moon between that picture and the present time, which comes out, if you take the average altitude between that time and now to - to about a 25-to-l stereo base, as best I can figure.||LMP|Sounds good enough, Gordy. We've got it - I got that one at 5 minutes. I mean at 240 on the hour, so those are probably pretty close.||CC|I would guess, you know, that the angle of looking at it - other factors have changed sc much that it would be pretty hard to pull them together once you - even though you get the images reduced to the same size, but it might be interesting to try.|09 21 47 03|LMP|I agree.||||||Tape 159/7|09 21 47 46|CC|America, Houston. There's some items coming here now in the Flight Plan. A couple of them, MAPPING CAMERA, RETRACT, and COVER, CLOSED, you've already done. However, right now we still see the mapping camera film rolling, so we want to leave it running until we give you a cue to turn it off - get all the film run out. And, the up-link for a state vector that's shown there will not be necessary. Over.||LMP|We were looking forward to get to do something. Now, we'll wait a little bit longer.||CDR|Couldn't you just flash a couple of lights on the DSKY just to keep us occupied?||CC|Send a crew alert or something?|09 21 48 40|LMP|Yes, throw it in once In a while just to keep us on our toes, Gordy.|09 21 49 33|CC|The Surgeon had a suggestion. He said if you really get bored, you could all put on your biomed harnesses.||CDR|Only listen to about half of what goes down, will you?|09 21 49 59|CC|Okay.|09 22 02 22|CDR|Gordy, you got any words on the SIM bay prior to going into PTC?||CC|Stand by.||CC|Nothing additional, Geno, go ahead as per Flight Plan with the one exception. We'll give you a cue when to stop the mapping camera as soon as the film runs out.||CDR|Okay, we'll hold up on the mapping camera and its cover, and we'll get the IR, OFF.||CC|Roger.||||Tape 159/6||||LMP|Okay. Okay, Gor - Gordy, the IR is coming OFF now.|09 22 03 37|LMP|MARK.||CC|Roger.|09 22 03 57|LMP|And the COVER is CLOSED.||CC|Roger.||LMP|Hey, Gordy, this is Jack. Is there any updated briefing on the status of the lunar surface equipment and SIM bay findings over and above what we got? I guess - I can't remember when it was -yesterday or some time.||CC|"I can't think of anything really outstanding. We're just right now coming up on another charge detonation; however, I think I mentioned that the LCRU is ""kaput."" So, we won't be able to watch it. We're looking at the seismometer traces here. Other - I'll come back with any other words to update you on yesterday's report in a little bit here."||LMP|Okay, I - just updated stuff.

Over.||CMP|Go ahead.||CC|On that PTC startup, there was only one jet that fired, and so we only got half the rate we need, and so the - I guess the only way to recover is to stop the roll and start damping the rates again and wait for our call to start it again - over again.

Just a second.||CC|America, Houston. You need to go back to the pitch and yaw in the Flight Plan, and the present roll will be okay.|09 23 28 44|CMP|Okay.||CC|Also for this damping, we want you to go to the jets called out at 240:50 in the Flight Plan.

At the present time, midcourse 5 is looking like a quarter of a foot per second, which means at the present time, we're not planning on burning it. But we reserve the right to change our minds sometime in the next hour and a half, if necessary. But that'll give you some thought to what to do today.||CDR|Very good, Bob. Outstanding.

We found nothing overnight to give us any concern, and we see nothing at the present time. Looks great. We're showing you at 66 degrees in the cabin.||CDR|Yes, sir. We're going to get it warmed up here, though, slot - shortly. Okay; America still looks good to us.||CC|And, America, you're now in the Earth control.

What time does the old back room get up this morning?||CC|Which back room?||LMP|The geology back room, of course.||CC|Well, beats me. I don't know if there's anyone down there or not. Let me see if I can find out.||LMP|No, that's all right, Bob. I just want you to pass on a thought. I had a little trouble getting to sleep last night. And they've probably already thought of it. But it has to do with Van Serg.||CC|Go ahead. I'll copy it down.||LMP|No, just ask them if they've thought about the possibility that the - those Van Serg breccias might be - might be the old indurated regolith over the subfloor.||CC|Okay; I got that.||LMP|That's an alternative that in the - the heat of battle did not occur to me at the time. It should have, and it may have occurred to some of them.||CC|Okay. Thats as opposed to being a window through -to the - below the subfloor, which is what you suggested the other night.||LMP|Yes, sir. I think I - I think I like the regolith better. It - I think it makes sense from a lot of points of view: the size of the crater, the fact that we should have expected to see something but hadn't up to that time.||CC|Okay. I got that.||||Tape l66/4||||LMP|And the breccias were, thinking back on it, could very easily have been soil breccias and just getting coarser as you got closer to the base of the sub - to the top of the subfloor, which is what we were looking at down in the bottom of the crater.|10 08 15 07|CC|Okay. Got that.|10 08 20 01|LMP|Bob, is your EECOM friend going to let us practice the waste water dump again today?||CC|I kind of expect so. Stand by and let me find out for sure. Roger, Jack.

About the only thing I can think of, Jack, would be reel 2.||CC|Jack, you might use reel 2 if you want to.

Would you like to try again?||CC|Well, that's all right, Jack. We'll live with it for a while. We're looking at - no need to acknowledge this - we're looking at your temperature problem. And there's a couple of obvious things I'm sure you've undertaken, but if you haven't -all the window shades off. Get some sunlight in there. And might crank on all the lights to get some more heat load in there. Also the - of course, the cabin fan and the temperature - CABIN TEMP control thumbwheel - it's your option on that. The other things, like mixing valve adjustment and powering up other items, we're looking at very seriously, but we would like to not do those items until after the EVA this morning. We'd like to remain the status quo on the ECS system with the exception of - you do have the cabin fans on your option there. But we would like to re - retain the rest of it status quo until after the EVA.||LMP|Well, thank you for all your research in there, Bob. I'll let the commander make the decisions. It - it's his thermostat.||CC|Roger.||CMP|The CMP feels pretty good so-||CDR|l'll see if they can get me mad this morning. That'll warm things up. Temperature's on the way up.||CC|Roger.

Right now your gamma - flight path angle, et cetera, at entry interface is all nominal, ana absolutely no midcourse 5 required at this time. And we'll be updating that as we refine the data.||CDR|Okay, well, that's - okay, well, we still exit PTC, Boo. We go to a different attitude. We - Yes, you have a different roll angle.

Today marks the 69th anniversary of man's first flight in a heavier-than-air powered machine. Back on December 17, 1903, Wilbur and Orville Wright, of Dayton, Ohio, took three historic flights on the sand beaches of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. The brothers will be honored today at a ceremony at a visitor's center near the flying site. How, a look at the news. There's apparently been a serious hitch in the peace talks between the U.S. and Borth Vietnam. Dr. Henry Kissinger, in a curt news conference at the White House, has said that the North Vietnamese have reneged on earlier agreements and have brought out - brought the peace talks to a halt. Dr. Kissinger said the unresolved problems, which center around the number of peace supervisors and their placement, is not acceptable to the President, and Kissinger feels, ar.d we quote, ""We have not yet reached an agreement that thi.-President considers just and fair."" Final unofficial returns from the Federally supervisee election name Arnold Miller the new president of the Lr.ited Mine Workers.

In the congressional spotlight in Washington, it appears that the contest for the position of House Majority Leader will be between Representative Thomas O'Neal of Massachusetts and Congressman Sam Gibbons of Florida. The two will vie for the post left vacant by the absent and presumed death of Congressman Hale Boggs. Boggs disappeared in the crash of a light plane in Alaska, in October. Northeastern Ohio has been blasted by a blizzard. As much as 28 inches of snow has fallen, blocking highways and closing airports. An additional foot is expected -was expected before it was to move east. Cleveland has been very hard hit with the white stuff, and the snow is now moving into the northeast. They'll have a white Christmas up that way. Here in Clear Lake, it's a clear, crispy day, but a chilly Sunday morning. Ellington had a 27 this morning. Might take a look at sports here. Miami defeated Baltimore yesterday l6 to 0, to go undefeated in the American Football Conference of the NFL.||CC|America, Houston. The UV COVER appears on our telemetry to still be OPEN.

I got it - I only got it to the intermediate position.||CC|Roger; thank you.||CC|Okay. In a real hair raiser at Candlestick Park, San Francisco, John Brodie came off the bench late in the game, in fact, in the last 2 minutes of the third quarter, and led the 49ers to a 20 to 17 win over the Minnesota Vikings. The win gives the Western Division crown to the l+9ers in the National Conference. Kis - the last touchdown thrown was with 5 seconds remaining in the game. That puts the Washington Redskins, Green Bay, San Francisco, and Dallas Cowboys in the NFC playoffs and closes out the NFC contest.

Both||||Tape 167/8|||||Cleveland and Pittsburgh will get into the playoff's, but their position in the standings is not yet known.

You're above the line on all your oxygen tanks. You're above the Flight Plan line on all your hydrogen tanks or right on the line. And you're 3 percent above the line on the RCS. That's Flight Plan usage at this time, so you're above the line on everything.||CMP|Okay, Houston. Thanks much.|10 10 09 48|CC|America, Houston.

Have you had a lot of condensation moisture around the cockpit?||CDR|Negative. No, it's been very dry.||CC|Okay; real good. Well, just a reminder; may not be applicable if you've got a good dry cockpit there. On l6 we had some - rather strange readings on the EVAP OUT temperature and a few other ones. And the potential is there for you to get those same readings - especially if you had had moisture - the potential is to get those readings at - after depress, and we'll be watching it closely. I guess - I don't want to say just ignore them, but we'll be watching them and take any readings for after depress there with a grain of salt. And while you're at it, you might go down and zero the optics If you've got somebody in the LEB.||CDR|Okay, Bob, stand by. We'll get that. Listen, the tunnel is dry up to the hatch. However, when you put your hand up in the tunnel around the - the edge of the hatch and on the - on the outer periphery of the hatch itself, there is quite a bit of moisture up there. We looked up there yesterday and couldn't find any, but there is some up there today. And the face of the hatch is slightly moist, but it's not - nothing like bubbles.||CC|Okay. Well, we just want you to be aware that you may see some extraneous ECS readings. It's no problem at all, but, you know, just wanted you to be aware of it.||||Tape 168/2||||CC|Gene, the specific thing on l6 that occurred was - as we thought it out was that the ECU control unit back of that panel there had the freezing - we think - freezing of the water on it, causing the bad readings.||CDR|Okay. When we changed the canister this morning, Ron tells me, there was water back there, too.||CC|Okay. We'll just - we can just expect some possible erroneous readings.|10 10 30 03|CDR|OPTICS to ZERO.

The computer is ours.||CC|Roger.|10 10 42 21|LMP|Houston, 17.||CC|Go ahead, America.||||||Tape 168/3||LMP|Yes, take a look at the LMPs biomed and see how it looks to you this morning.||CC|LMPs biomed looks pretty good, America.|10 10 42 52|LMP|Okay.|10 11 03 25|CMP|Okay, Houston. The command module pilot biomed should be on the line.||CC|Okay, Ron. We'll give you a word here.||CC|Ron, your biomed looks great.|10 11 04 09|CMP|Okay; mighty fine.|10 11 11 52|CMP|Hello, Houston. We just turned the CABIN FAN, OFF.||CC|Roger. We are copying it - cabin temp around 70. Is it a little more comfortable?||CMP|Well, we got two extremes.||CC|Okay.||CMP|Okay; let's see now, the EVA umbilical bag is on the rock boxes - on the - LiOH cans now. What's next, Jack?||LMP|Yes.|10 11 14 29|CC|America, we're showing - -||CMP|... Go ahead.||CC|- - we're showing a slightly high O2 flow. We're just wondering if all the waste compartment vents and all your dump vents are closed as per the Flight Plan.||CMP|Well, as a matter of face, no. OVERBOARD DRAIN was OPEN - Let's see, BATTERY VENT was CLOSED during the water dump, but now it's to VENT. WASTE STOWAGE VENT is now CLOSED. We're thinking about opening that WASTE STOWAGE VENT, anyhow, to keep any possible breakage in there from coining||||Tape 168/4|||||back into the cabin. And that way it might go outside during the depress instead of inside. What do you all think of that?||CC|Let us debate that one. It sounds pretty good, but let us debate it.||CMP|Okay.||CDR|Tom, the principle concern is those BUSS samples.||CC|Roger. I understand your concern. I - we'll work on it here. I don't think there's any problem to it.||CDR|Okay. But all I'm saying is that the BUSS samples have never flown before.||LMP|Yes, the EVA umbilical bag is snapped on there. Okay. They're hooked up there, but let me make sure it's hooked down at the bottom this time.||CDR|I don't think - I don't think it has been yet. It would, as a matter of fact.|10 11 18 01|LMP|Okay; the A-2 rock bag is tied up. Yes.||CDR|Okay; that A-7 bag's all squared away. Okay; and let's see what we got there, so we can reach those at the bottom. Temporary storage bag is clear in the top. Yes, we want to leave them there so I can open the bottom. Are they tied up? Okay; here we are. Okay.||LMP|Yes, I'll have to. Oh, it will hold up there as long as I snap it. Yes, the EVA bags are okay.|10 11 19 10|CMP|Okay. We got everything we want in the jett bag now?||CMP|Hey, Houston, this is America. Obviously I'm on VOX here, so I'll try and keep you informed on how things are going.||CC|America, Houston.||||||Tape 168/5||CMP|Okay; go ahead.||CC|Some words concerning the waste management vent. We really don't care what you do with it now until -until 2C minutes prior to your suit integrity check. We would like to have it closed for a good stabilized reading during suit integrity check, and it requires to be closed 20 minutes prior to that time for a stabilized flow. After the suit integrity check, if you desire to open it during the cabin depress, that's okay with us.||CMP|Okay. We'll leave it closed now, and during cabin depress, we'll probably open it then.||CC|Okay. Would you like us to remind you on it or just press on like you are doing?||CMP|Yes, that's affirm. We can use all the help we can get.||CC|Roger.||CMP|Okay.|10 11 22 02|CDR|Okay, Jack. The jett bag is taped. Okay. Temporarily stowed.||LMP|We're down to mag already.||CDR|On the camera, yes. Okay; 8. Okay. Yes, this is a biggy. Okay, let me verify. I think I've already got that. Ah ha, there it is. Yes. Ah ha, there it is.||CMP|Okay; we've got that one. Check it. Yes; we're okay. Yes. I don't have mine on yet, but here it is. Yes, it's there. It's installed. Jack screws are fully open. Yes, I - I got it open, but I didn't take anything out. Everything was already out.|10 11 24 40|CDR|Okay; TV pole. Right hand. Yes, I knew, rock box. No, not for me. Look good.||||Tape l68/6||||CMP|Gene, do you know how to run an extension on the OPS (laughter)? Okay.||CMP|Okay. What did you say? You want A-2 now?||CDR|Okay; we're A-2.||CDR|Okay, Houston; America. The OPS checks out at 5900 psi and is regulating to 3.9.||CC|Roger, Gene.||LMP|Okay. The old PGA bag is installed.||CMP|Okay. And the EV gloves are on. Okay?|10 11 28 11|CDR|For some reason, they're called entry boots up here.|10 11 23 45|LMP|Okay. Tiedown rope. Where does it go? Okay. And the - Okay; everything goes ...||LMP|Okay. Vac bag is in there, headrest pads, tiedown ropes, and heel clips.||LMP|Okay; lunar sounder cassette bag is in the EVA bag.||CDR|Yes.||LMP|What1d we do with that tissue dispenser, Gene?||CDR|We use it up?||LMP|No, we ...||LMP|Yes, just like that. Ah ha, there's the old pressure gauge. And it reads 0.||CDR|Okay. It's in the wrist tether pouch?||LMP|You're clumsy, too.||CDR|Okay. Ah ha, this one?||LMP|Yes.||||||Tape 168/7||CDR|(Laughter) I was just acting surprised; I really know where they go. That's a little - We listen thax way.||LMP|They're not on yet.||CMP|Can't hold everything still to get the thing in there.||LMP|Bag go in there? Got it all stowed?||CMP|Oh, yes.||LMP|Hand controllers are stowed.||LMP|Okay; counterbalance is all squared away.||CDR|Yes.||LMP|Okay?|10 11 33 35|CDR|What kind of - what kind of lens?||LMP|Keep it in F-l all the time.||LMP|Let's use that other DAC. It goes on the pole with the but you can hook it up. Well, let's put it on the pole first, I guess.||LMP|A-l, decon bag.||CDR|Oh, okay. I didn't know what you meant. I've got to get in A-l is what you are saying.||LMP|Don't forget my jett bag is down there. Okay; the old jett bag's on the other side now.||CDR|In the .., pocket.||LMP|Hey, Gene, can you attach this to something up there? Okay.||LMP|... out of here again.||CDR|No, it's dirt out here again.||||Tape l68/8|||10 11 37 09|LMP|Okay, you get that ... finished?||CDR|Here we go. Here comes the cable. Here comes the monitor. Well, go that way, I guess. Oh, okay.||CDR|Here it is. There's the tape. Okay. What else do we need out of the - out of the A-l? Yes. Yes. Yes. Package of towels. Oh, okay. That's right. We need a package of towels, don't we? That's to clean off the - all the stuff when we bring it back in, huh? Who - whose towel do we use? Do we use the commander's? Well, I'll use one of mine (laughter). Okay; here's the package of towels.||LMP|Okay; you got a bunch of them. We're only going to need three or four.||CDR|Yes. Well, yes. You guys aren't, but I still am.||LMP|Yes, okay. Well, I'm not ready to depressurize yet either.||CDR|Okay; that's A-l.||LMP|Okay.||CDR|The cable; the TV.||LMP|Put the cable on first.|10 11 44 43|LMP|They should be okay, but ...||LMP|It just hooks like that.||CMP|Got one?|10 11 46 56|LMP|Got one.|10 11 50 14|CMP|Houston, in case you're wondering, we're still routing cables.||CC|"Roger. We've got you down In the checklist, the step just prior to ""S-BAND AUX TV to SCI."" Do you concur on that?"||||||Tape 168/9||CMP|Yes. We're still keeping TV and DAC cables and what have you up to the pole.||CC|Roger. We get you Ron.|10 11 52 44|LMP|... before we run out of those.||CC|America, Houston.||CMP|Yes, go ahead.||CC|Is Gene in the commander's seat at this time?||CMP|That's affirm.||CC|Okay; I'll delay then - a minute here. We're going to have a VERB 49 maneuver coming up to you. We're getting the SIM bay a little bit cold, and we want to warm up those handrails, so we'll be maneuvering here at about 4 - At 254:45, I'll have a maneuver for you.||CMP|Okay; we're ready from now on any time.||CC|Just stand by. We want to check out the numbers. I just wanted to give you the word that we were going to make this maneuver.||CMP|Any time, Bob.|10 11 55 57|LMP|Well, you're going to have to put on your helmet -It's really over that way a little bit more, because I got to get into the hatch to get it out.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 169/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|10 11 58 19|CMP|Well, anyhow, it's all taped up. What's next? Okay. There's the old crewman's IV tether.||CMP|Ah. Found something we didn't practice.||CC|America, Houston, I've got the VERB 49 maneuver.||CDR|Oh. Okay. Go ahead with the numbers.||CC|Okay. It's ROLL, 150; PITCH, 216; YAW, 330. And that's - we'd like that maneuver to start at 254:45 Just prior to starting that maneuver, we'd like the IR COVER CLOSED and the IR OFF.||CDR|Okay. At 2^:45 you want 150, 216, and 330. Prior to maneuver, you want IR CLOSED and OFF. And what about the jets on that, Bob?||CC|The same jets you have configured. Did you read ROLL, 150; PITCH, 216; and YAW, 330: Is that what you read?||CDR|That's what I read, and I'll stay in SIM bay jets.||CC|Okay, and you'll need these new high-gain antenna angles: PITCH, minus 32; YAW, 52.||CDR|Okay. PITCH is minus 32, and YAW is 52. Got it.||CMP|Okay, and then what? Okay. Okay. I'll get off of the headset now then.||LMP|Okay. Panel POWER OFF, SUIT POWER OFF and AUDIO CONTROL NORMAL. Got it? CONTROL NORMAL. Okay. Panel 60>+, Geno, is SUIT PRESSURE ALARM OFF, verify.|10 12 01 43|CDR|OFF.||LMP|All caps from 603.||CDR|Removed.||||Tape 169/2||||LMP|Unsnap CMP comm carrier - cable from O2 umbilical, and we'll beep for you on it when you're - -||CC|America, Houston.||LMP|- - ready.||CDR|Okay. We're going to go ahead and close the IR and turn it off at this time.||CC|America, Houston. Would you just close the IR, and we'll cue you on the OFF call? We'd like to see it here, and we'd like to do that as a cue.|10 12 02 18|CDR|Okay. It's OFF.||LMP|Okay.||CDR|CLOSED, rather.||LMP|COVER'S CLOSED.|10 12 02 22|LMP|MARK it. And it went gray.||CC|Roger. We copy that.||LMP|Okay. Route outboard of the strut and wires and connect CCU head to 603.||CDR|||CC|Geno, I'd like to give you just one bit of information we just got from the simulator. When you go from this new attitude I gave you - this VERB 49 attitude right now - to the EVA attitude, you will see a middle gimbal angle of 66 degrees. That's right off the simulator.|10 12 03 46|CDR|Okay, Bob. Thank you very much.||CDR|We're maneuvering, Bob.||LMP|Okay, you got it connected? Secure cable to TV bracket and top of strut using two straps.||CMP|||||||Tape 169/3||LMP|Okay. You understand that? Secure cable - and that's the same one, the comm cables - to TV bracket - top of strut using two straps. You got that?|10 12 06 52|LMP|Okay. Position the TV monitor. You got that? And - disconnect PGA bag from couch at four places, Ron. It's the old remove center couch bit.||LMP|Going to have to move the old jett bag, though. Back over to your side, I guess, Ron. Yes, let's get this jett bag over on the other side. You want to unhook the PGA bag. I've got the front two. Okay. Now you can take the center couch out.||CMP|Yes.||LMP|Think you can handle this GOG [?], Ron?||LMP|It certainly comes out easier, doesn't it? I mean like you're going to have to - ... that way - that's right, because this place is fuller than the mock-up ever was.||LMP|Yes, it's the old full spacecraft story. Well, look what turned up here; the clock. Maps. Well, they should be in R-5- Wait a minute. Yes. Okay.|10 12 10 07|LMP|Secured? Yes. Okay. Close and lock your old marmon clamps.||LMP|Closed and locked? Okay. Open the old - the EVA umbilical bag.||CMP|Open.||LMP|Unsnap the top strap and remove spacecraft end of EVA umb all the way to the second tiedown strap. And you're going to attach that to 603, but verify that the EVA STATION O2 is OFF. Attach the EVA umbilical to 603. Route over couch beam and under wires.||CC|Jack, whenever it's convenient, you might turn off the IR now. It's looking great.||||Tape 169/4||||LMP|Okay. The IR ALARM switch is going to OFF.|10 12 13 04|LMP|MARK.||CC|Thank you, sir.||LMP|Okay. You got the O2 locked?||CMP|Yes.||LMP|ELECTRICAL locked?||CMP|Yes .||LMP|Umbilical tether to couch ring and lock and install pin.||CMP|Okay.||LMP|Got that? SCU OPEN, bleed system, SCU CLOSED.||LMP|Okay. And you can close it if your system has bled down. Unstow press gage from EVA bag and connect the gage to 603. And tape the flashlight to panel 603 guard, Gene.||CDR|Okay.|10 12 14 37|LMP|And then we can - -||CDR|. .. gage?||LMP|Yes, install the gage, tape the flashlight, and then we get rid of the tape, yes. Got one?||LMP|Leave the tape on that so the light won't get out, Ron. (Laughter) Jerry Griffin told me that one.||LMP|Once you're taped it you can stow the tape. Unstow from the left-hand temporary stowage bag, top pocket: PURGE VALVE, stow in EVA bag, PURGE VALVE patch - pouch. And then the waist tethers, also. (Humming) Waist tethers are in that bag.||||||Tape 169/5|10 12 16 21|LMP|Houston, do you have recommendation on whether we use 208 or 211 PURGE VALVE? You - you were very interested in that on the lunar surface. Here's yours, I guess.||CC|Stand by. We're getting it.||CDR|Bob - Bob, we're using my OPS, so I assume it would be 208.||CC|That sounds good, Gene.||LMP|Okay. Here's some more tape, Geno. Stow in the EVA bag in the proper pouch, and then get the waist - both waist tethers out. And we can attach them up here to the guards.||LMP|Yes, I'll get it. And we want one over on the other side, wherever the other one is.||LMP|Okay. PURGE VALVE waist - and there's another waist tether in the EVA bag.||LMP|Yes, hook that up there. ... put that up ... Oh, that's yours. I'm sorry (laughter). I was looking for this one. All right.||LMP|Yes, that's the one. I verified that. Numbers? Okay.|10 12 19 56|CDR|Okay, Bob - -||LMP|Okay.||CDR|- - we're at the attitude, and the high gain is set. And I never did see that middle gimbal angle get to 60.||LMP|Unstow the CDRs LEVA, and leave the EVA bags in the LEVA bag - EVA gloves in the LEVA bag.||CC|Okay, Geno. It will be the next maneuver that you'll see that middle gimbal angle out around 60 - 66 degrees.||CDR|Okay.||||Tape 169/6||||LMP|Should have vacuumed those things (laughter). And particularly since you're going to be looking into the Sun (laughter).||CMP|Hey ...||LMP|That's right.||LMP|Okay, where? ...||LMP|Put the - put them in the tan TSB. No, not yet. That's the - Yes, unstow the LMP LEVA and EV gloves. Put the gloves in the top pocket.|10 12 24 11|LMP|Oh, they're in the left-hand top pocket. We wiped those off quite a bit. They're not half bad now. I don't have any instructions.|10 12 27 13|LMP|Okay. I think we can stick these under the couch.||LMP|Yes. Put your LEVA on the helmet. Okay, LEVA bags go up in the tunnel. Then we need to get the CDR's helmet out, too.||CDR|Houston, this is America. By my count, we're still about 30 or 40 minutes ahead here.||CC|Roger, Gene. You're looking good.||LMP|Oh, not too far. I'll have to - can't tell from the list. ... the next page? Huh? Yes. Oh ... I wouldn't know if my helmet was fogged up or not.||LMP|Supposed to have put them in the left-hand -|10 12 30 14|LMP|Got a place for that ...?||LMP|Somewhere I ceased to be careful with my helmet, I can see that because ... (Humming)||LMP|Okay. Have you got the CDR's helmet unstowed? The IV gloves?||LMP|Put your helmet stowage bag over there. Yes. Place accessory bag in the stowage bag. IV gloves in the temporary stowage bag.||||||Tape 169/7|10 12 34 19|LMP|Okay. You got your helmet on? Verified your visors? Verify the LEVA visors? Okay, and we antifogged. Okay. And the helmets and LEVAs are under the CDR couch. Stow loose items. Verify all your loose items, gents.||LMP|We've used it all.||LMP|Okay. Let me verify that we've got all the covers closed. One, two - Covers are closed. Panel 230, MAPPING CAMERA, OFF. SOUNDER RECORDER is OFF, IR is OFF, SELF TEST, HEATERS to - just about. You can get - you can work in that direction now. You're happy with loose items and everything?||CDR|... first?||LMP|CMP first. Yes. They've gotten it. Yes. Then me and then you. I'm just reading you the procedures Is all.||LMP|Okay, Houston. For a little while things may sound a little bit confused. We're going to do the old thing about getting into suits.||CC|Roger. We're copying that.||LMP|And if you don't hear from us - if you don't hear from us, off and on; well, that's because we're not talking to you.||CDR|And, Bob, the CDR's going off the loop right now. I'll be back in plenty of time for that maneuver.||CC|Okay.|10 12 37 22|LMP|And - let's see, continuing right here. SELF TEST is OFF, and the UV is OFF. And the DATA SYS - the ON, switch is to OFF, strange as that may sound. And - I can. Yes, I will. I'll stay on for a while, until Gene gets suited.||LMP|And the panel 5 INSTRUMENTATION SCIENCE EQUIPMENT SEB circuit breakers are coming OPEN. Two are open. Ron, you may want to watch that. Yes.|10 12 38 36|LMP|I already stowed mine in my temporary stowage bag. That's it ...||||Tape 169/8||||CC|America, Houston.||LMP|Yes, go ahead.||CC|Did Ron unplug from the biomed for a while?||LMP|Yes, he is off the biomed for a while.||CC|Okay. Thank you.||LMP|But you can look at me for a while.|10 12 4l 03|CC|Yes, you're there.|10 12 51 30|CMP|Okay, Houston. Gene's got his suit on now, and he'll help Jack get into his.||CC|Roger, Ron.||CMP|And in case you're won - in case you're wondering, we changed the procedure there a little bit. It was more convenient for them to get those guys suited first and then me.||CC|Okay. We'll buy that. You still are off of biomed. Do you concur on that?||CMP|Yes, if you want to take a look at it, I can plug it in here. I'm on Jack's headset now, but I can plug it in if you want me to.||CC|No, no problem - no problem. We just wanted to -you know, it's easier to remind you now than it is to have you unzip the suit or something, that's all.||CMP|Oh, okay. Yes, I understand. Let me check and see if it's still working. I'll go off first and then back on.||CMP|Okay. It's hooked up now.||CC|Roger, Ron. You look good. You're breathing.|10 12 52 46|CMP|I'm breathing, huh? .Okay.|10 13 01 25|CDR|Okay, Bob, CDR's suited and back on the comm and biomed.||||||Tape 169/9||CC|Okay. We copy that.||LMP|Houston, how do you read the LMP?||CC|LMP, we read you loud and clear.||LMP|Okay. I'm in w suit and on suit comm now.||CC|And be advised the CDR and LMP both look good on biomed.||LMP|Okay. And we're going to get the old CMP in the suit here.||CC|Okay.||LMP|That or we'll let him do it by himself since he's so proficient at it now.||CC|America, Houston. We're copying you as being somewhat ahead on your time line, so don't rush on the -on the suit donning.||LMP|Roger. We're not rushing, just going at it systematically. We apparently learned how to do it, though, somewhere along the line.||CC|Okay. Well, just want you to be advised we don't particularly want to start early; and, therefore, you're ahead of the time line right now. You can take a break afterwards maybe.||CDR|Okay, Bob, ... on that one.|10 13 05 34|LMP|Understand, Bob. Understand.|10 13 14 01|LMP|Houston, this is the LMP. I've got something for you you've been looking forward to. It's a number. It's 24173.||CC|Roger, Jack.||CC|Jack, I wasn't sure what you were talking about there for a minute, but it lit up the face on the panel next to me there. So everybody's happy now.||||Tape 169/IO||||LMP|Good. I'm sorry about that, Bob. Tell them that it was not intentional to leave it in the suit. As a matter of fact, it might be worth a reminder when you think we're unsuiting - suiting to take it out.||CC|Well, if you wouldn't mind a reminder, we wouldn't mind giving it to you.||LMP|Fine with me.|10 13 15 27|CC|We're writing it into the EVA Checklist right now.|10 13 22 13|LMP|Houston. We're on the top of 3-8.||CC|Roger. Understand.||LMP|With the exception of the VERB 49 maneuver, the other pages are complete.||CC|Roger. Yes, you read my mind on that one.||LMP|Say again?||CC|You read ny mind. That was the next thing I was going to ask you. I hadn't seen a VERB 49, and that's on that page that isn't required at this time.||LMP|Yes, right. We're ... by for your Flight Plan time.||CDR|We'll - we'll maneuver in the Flight Plan - VERB 49-||CC|Roger. We understand.||LMP|Okay. Verify your SCU, CLOSED. You ready to go?||LMP|Panel 2, CRYO PRESS INDICATOR - INDICATOR is ... 3. Panel 603, EVA STATION O2, ON. Verify EVA STATION O2 gage reads approximately same as surge tank. And surge tank reads 850. I guess that's approximately. (Laughter.)||CMP|||||||Tape 169/11||LMP|Okay. SCU OPEN. Verify flow and purge umbilical. And then the panel 603, EVA STATION O2 OFF - O2 OFF.||LMP|Okay. You verified all that (laughter). Waist -remove waist belt stowage strap from umbilical and stow in EVA bag. Okay. That's done. Connect EVA umbilical electrical and O2 to CMP PGA, right-hand blue and lock. You're going to connect the EVA umbilical to yourself.|10 13 25 36|LMP|(Cough). Okay. Your electrical and O2 are connected, right-hand blue and locked.||LMP|Okay?||LMP|I transferred the LEB. I don't see that in here anymore.||LMP|There it is. Okay. Your next big step here is to connect the waist belt and lock; buckle on the left-hand side.|10 13 27 22|LMP|... down there now, Ron. Can I help you with the connections? You don't have me going down there, you know, until -|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 170/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|10 13 29 53|LMP|No.||CDR|Okay. Yes, that's good.

Or should I jack it up some more?||CMP|Houston, say something.||CC|Roger, Ron. We copy you. You might try and adjust your VOX, thumbwheel down a little bit. It might help us a bit, knock out some of the background noise.||CMP|(Laughter) Okay. Jack, you want to try to knock the VOX down a little bit?

It's nice and white down here. The UV cover's closed real well. Doesn't seem to be any ... at all on the white face, on the UV or the IR. Everything is in good shape. Looks like part of that - Oh, the cork insulation - chipped off again down here in the corner - in the corner that I'm looking at. Okay, let's try the old cassette. We'll push down on it until it goes past center. Ah-ha! I think that was more than 2 pounds of force to come out, but it came out. And got the film.|10 15 11 40|CMP-EVA|Okay, she's locked in there. These EVA handholds are - Hey, the foot just came out - okay - the EVA handholds are - okay, got them free - are rougher than - What was that? I just ... Oh, that was my pocket, okay. And it creates a torque when I cut -when I let go of that pocket, there, I let go with a little bit of a force, and the force has a tendency to throw your feet way up in the air.

Okay, let's see, now, which way did I turn on on this thing. I'm still backwards down here. What the heck? (Humming)||CMP-EVA|Okay, well, we need to get that big old pan camera.

(Humming)||CDR|Houston, this is America. Everything is looking good from here.||CMP-EVA|Houston, this is - Let's see, when you're EVA, they use - they use your name, don't they?||CC|Okay, Ron. Yes, sir, we'll use it, Ron.||CMP-EVA|Houston, this is Ron. Okay? You hear me okay, I guess, huh?||||||Tape 171||CC|Roger, Ron. Read you loud and clear.||CMP-EVA|Okay. (Laughter) Oh, this is great, I'll tell you!||CC|Yes, we thought it was Mr. America.||CMP-EVA|(Laughter) Well, it is. Something like that. Oh, boy! Beautiful Moon! Full Moon down there. Runs back of - What? You know, you can't see anything. The only thing I can see is the SIM bay. I can see the - the engine bell sitting back here. That's a pretty good sized thing, too. And, of course, the UV - the VHF antenna - is still sticking out there. All of the - all of the poles are on it. So it's working all right. Oh, that's a little bit of a rest. Let's pull the old metal thing off here. Oh, okay, well - see it? Can you see that? The thing I'm holding up. Yes, it's the - it's the cover that's on the outside of the pan camera. It's a thermal cover, see, that covers up the cassette.|10 15 18 07|CMP-EVA|Yes, well, I'm in the shadows. There we go. Yes. See, that's right. That's the thermal cover that's on there, and then that's the - -||CC|Roger. Yes, we see it, Ron.||CMP-EVA|- - Whooooee (Laughter) Okay. Well, let's see. Ah-ha! There's the pan camera cassette down there.||CC|We just saw that cover.||CMP-EVA|Okay.||CMP-EVA|Okay. Let's see, that's hooked down. And lock it. Yes. ... hook laying there. Okay, it's locked so it won't come apart. Okay, where's the old pin. There it is. (Humming)|10 15 20 02|CMP-EVA|Okay, pin is pulled. Frees the handle. And out she comes. Nice and easy. This a heavy son of a gun. Not heavy up here, it just has a lot of - a lot of momentum to it. Once she starts pulling in one direction, it just takes a lot of force to stop it. And we'll just try and - Oops, there's||||Tape 171/6|||||a - ... right there. Wouldn't want to do that. Let me get this thing first and then get this foot out. Okay. I think I'll just kind of let that thing go and hang on with both hands. Get it started right in front of me. Have to look the best way to see that one. Okay. It's just kind of floating around up there. Both feet are free. Okay.|10 15 21 24|CMP-EVA|Hey, it's just kind of coming along with me. I'll just let her do that. Hey, she's just floating there.||CMP-EVA|Okay. Coming. She's still coming. Must be back behind me. That's good. Nice and slow. Because you don't want that thing banging around too much up there, I don't think.||CMP-EVA|Ahhh, there it is! Delivered it right to you. (Laughter) That's the way it ought to be done, isn't it? Okay, got it locked? Yes. Okay. Ah, you got it hooked on my French gauntlet - my truss guard. (Laughter) Okay. That's a good idea. Oh, that Sun's bright when you look into it. That is a biggy. (Humming) You know, I just kind of hook it along underneath me and just go backwards down there. (Humming) That's an unorthodox way to enter the SIM bay, but it works. Okay. We'll ease on up. Oh, okay. I'm going to rest when I get my feet in that thing. Wish you could kind of rest here. You could take it nice and easy. Yes, once you get your feet in there, except that -it kind of - you almost feel like maybe they might come out, you know. (Laughter) So I'm not sure you really trust them. The right foot's in good and tight. Hello, Mom!||CC|We see you, Ron. Looking great.||CMP-EVA|Hello, Jan. Hi, Jon. How are you doing? HI, Jaime. Let's see, I'm supposed to rest, though, aren't I? What would you like to know about the SIM bay? Looks great. Nothing is scorched. I was kind of surprised when I saw it on this mapping camera - There was - the two - well, one's just kind of a steel plate there, and right on top of||||||Tape 171/7|||the door, there's something with a piece of tape on it. And I thought that piece of tape came off before launch.||CC|Ron, just a couple questions while you're standing there resting. Is there any damage to the cable that the mapping camera - the cable between the mapping camera and the shelf?|10 15 25 26|CMP-EVA|Let me check on that one.||CC|Roger. Don't move and look at it. It was not that important. If you can see it, fine; otherwise, forget it.||CMP-EVA|Yes. Okay. I want to kind of take a look at it when I go by. There's Jack (laughter) Hey, how are you doing? You're looking right into the Sun, though, and I'm looking right at you. I should have a camera, and I could take your picture. And there - see the Moon back over there? That's a -Well, that's the way it goes. Hey, it's clearer down here when you take that visor up. I hope I took the outside one. I mean the gold one. No, that's both of them, I think. Better leave it down. There we go. Yes, you take the outside one up a little ways and then you can really see down in the SIM bay. You know, that tape down in here is not scorched one bit. The whole side of the spacecraft is scorched like a son of a gun -but the - you know, the panels, and everything. Man, there's bubbles, you know, on all that silver paint that's on here - is, you know, it used to be kind of a bright-looking silver paint. It looks like - it's in a shadow right now - but it looks like it's just been heated up one way or another. Yes, that's it up here between the SIM bay and the top of the service module. It actually looks like it's been burned, you know. Not just a little bit warm, it's just kind of burned because it's bubbled. Yes. That's what you were seeing from the LM, I'm sure. And - but - as far as I can - it's kind of dark down the other side of the spacecraft - the other side of the SIM bay -but it looks like the thrusters don't make any -||||Tape 171/8|||||hardly any marks on there. Now, I look - I look at quad A - the side of quad A thruster, though, and it's all scorched. So I'm not sure but what that might have been - what in the world could do that? Tower jett, do you suppose? I don't know. Might have. Well, let's take one of these covers off. Oh, this is - like it did in practice. (Laughter) Sticking underneath the door. Looks like I can jerk on it a little harder up here. In practice, I didn't want to break it. There's - a part of the - could you see that one?||CC|Roger. We see it. Looks like the outer-space Olympics going on up there.|10 15 28 26|CMP-EVA|(Laughter) Hey, this is great, I'll tell you! And let me see which way to throw it so you all can see it down there. There it goes. (Chuckle) Okay - -||CC|Roger. We see it reflecting off in the distance.||CMP-EVA|Did you see it? Okay.||CC|Never did that in the water tank.||CMP-EVA|(Laughter) Yes, That's the little - the Mylar. That's that tinfoil they make the LM out of, you know.||CC|Roger.||CMP-EVA|(Laughter) No, not really. You know, it's kind of an insulation-type stuff. And see all that yellow?||CDR|If that's what they made the LM out of, you'd never be able to pull it apart, I'll tell you.||CMP-EVA|(Laughter) That's right. I - I'm joking about that, you know. I'm really joking. Fellows, it was a good vehicle.||CC|We'll send your apologies to Bethpage.||||||Tape 171/9||CMP-EVA|And (laughter) - No, I guess Bethpage knows I'm joking, you know. Let me see. Hey, I got to make sure I get this on the right handle here, don't I?||CMP-EVA|Gee, that's why I wore my watch, and I forgot to start it. (Laughter) Okay. About 40 minutes, huh?||CC|We've got you 35 minutes - 36 minutes, Ron.||CMP-EVA|Oh, okay. Oh. Okay. Yes, the EVA lights are kind of blistered, also. No, they're back behind, toward the Sun. Put some hooks on there now. I'm hooked onto the (chuckle) cassette. No, maybe that tape's supposed to be on that pan camera, I'm sure. Put the old doors back in there real well. I don't know what - what would cause that thing to - ... those 4 minutes, anyhow. Ah-ha! There's the old mapper cassette. Well, I'm going to - am. I supposed to pick it up or what? I want to take a look down in there. Can't get out that way. (Laughter) Got my left foot stuck in there, and you can't go out in the left direction with - with my foot in there. You have to lean over to the right a little bit to take your foot out. (Humming) Yes, nice and clean - down in there. Yes, that cable's in the clear. I can see down in there. There doesn't seem to be anything hanging up on it at all.||CC|Okay, Ron; good show.|10 15 32 40|CMP-EVA|Okay. Put the old Sun visor down now. Whoops, come back here, little cassette. (Humming) Yes, I was going to try to lift that door up, but should have done that while I was punched down in there.||CC|There's no requirement on that, Ron; no requirement.||CMP-EVA|(Laughter) Okay. I want to check one thing while I'm out here before I leave, and to see the bottom of this quad A. Forgot to look at it. Yes, well, it looks just like the side almost. More blistered on the side than it is on the bottom, but I think maybe it's just the paint. Okay, I'm coming back in. Oh, Okay.||||Tape 171/10||||CMP-EVA|Man, the RTV is good out here. Looks brand new. Whatever they put on the hinge. Looks like that RTV stuff, you know. That's why they sealed around all their doors on here. And it's spanking clean as ever. (Humming) Okay, no hurry. ... Once (Chuckle) - Outstanding - once you get stable in a position, see, I can pretty much hang on with one hand, and I can twist - Oops. Yes, once you start going, it's a son of a gun to try - it's all wrist action. Working - Yes, but once you get stable on the thing, you can kind of relax there, and -Yes ... drift, you know, and if I ever bang my foot against - against something, just - just barely touch it, and it bangs right back. And -Hey, America looks really great there. Still got that silver tape on him - or is it blue? Looks silver with this helmet. Let's see, I've got to get over this way farther this time, don't I? Okay. There we go. Hey, I got a picture of the waste water dump from the LM the other day, but it looks the same way now. There's all kinds of little ice particles all around the - the periphery of the dump nozzle itself. It covers up the - well, that kind of gold part that's - that's on the - on the end of the dump nozzle. And then, there are little particles of frozen water, I guess - must be -that are - that are all over - up the side of the spacecraft there, but only in the vicinity of the -the nozzle. It goes up just about to window number 1 - it goes up to window number 1 - well, maybe on up to - no, there's particles all the way up the side of the spacecraft, clear up to the top of the tunnel. But they're real fine. I want to see if they're stuck on there. Hey, you can just touch them, and they blow away. They're just little ice particles.|10 15 37 42|CDR|Okay, Houston. We got all three cassettes this side||CC|Roger, Good show.|10 15 37 46|CMP-EVA|Hey, here's something. You know, the one thing that really shows up - and it makes you kind of proud -it says United States, and it's got a United States of America flag right below it. That didn't get scorched or a darn thing. That's great. And -||||||Tape 171/11|||let's see now - I see what Charlie Duke meant. Man, it's dark out here. It is really dark. The scimitar antenna, right there - in no shape - no problem. Wish there were some more handholds, I'd go around the other side of the spacecraft. Take a look at the high gain. There aren't any more handholds.||CC|Okay, Ron, we don't need any more spacecraft commentary. We'd like you to go ahead and terminate the EVA. You're looking great. You're looking great. Everybody's really pleased, and we'd just like to go ahead and terminate.|10 15 39 49|CMP-EVA|Okay. Sounds good.||CDR|Okay, Bob, we'll get back in.||CMP-EVA|Torque? I can't. How's that?||CMP-EVA|Okay, I guess we'll - start getting back in then. I'm up below the camera right now.||CC|Ron, you'd be happy to know, on the TV, we got a great view of your OPS [?] with the United States flag on it.||CMP-EVA|Hey, beautiful! Perfect! Let's see, which way do I want to get the umbilical down there? Oh, yes, but you're pulling me sidewise, okay. That's all right. Wait a minute. Okay. No, that's all right. Okay. You are in good shape now. Go ahead and start pulling in, now.||CDR|Wait a minute, Ron, until we get Jack in the right place.||CMP-EVA|Okay.||CMP-EVA|Is it clear?||CDR|Yes, the umbilical's in. Come on in.||CMP-EVA|Okay.||||Tape 171/12||||CDR|You coming in head down or up?||CMP-EVA|Up. This way right now.||CDR|You can't close the hatch that way.||CMP-EVA|I know it.||CDR|Okay.||CMP-EVA|Mot yet. What does that look like on the monitor?||CC|Well, you should have - test me, and I wouldn't want to guess. It's probably the full Moon, isn't it?||CMP-EVA|It is.||CC|You taught me well, Ron; taught me well.||CMP-EVA|Okay, you got - got you real well there. Okay, then I'm going to arc it around and ... See if I can turn around here and - Yes, I am. Trying to, anyhow. Yes, wait a minute, I can't - No, I'm not.||CMP-EVA|Yes, afraid I can't get to it. Can't point it. Okay, well, I'll just have to get back in.||CC|Okay, Ron, we know what you're trying to do, and we appreciate the TV show. We're looking - we're sorry to see you go, but we'd like to terminate.||CMP-EVA|(Laughter)||CDR|We're terminating - -|10 15 43 21|CMP-EVA|Okay, we're terminating.||CC|And you might be advised you're right on the Flight Plan, you're right on the Flight Plan.||CMP-EVA|Oh, okay. Good. I didn't want to get - cut my time short, or anything, you know.||||||Tape 171/13||CDR|Unless you can set it way back there. Okay, then I'll keep it right here.||CMP-EVA|Sure it's there, Geno? We can shove it underneath your couch.||CDR|That's the best place to shove it.||CMP-EVA|Can you do that? I'll get up out of your way, here.||CDR|Let me get it. Let me get out from under the cord. Okay.||CMP-EVA|And, if you can get the TV switch there, Jack, that kind of saves - all that stuff, I guess.||LMP|Okay.||CMP-EVA|If you can't, I'll get it when I come in.||CDR|Okay, and I got it OFF up here, too. Okay, you're in STANDBY. That's all.||CMP-EVA|Okay. I'm going to have to come in there kind of - a little bit blinded, because, in order to get in, I got to look at the Sun. So you just got to point me in the right direction there.||CMP-EVA|(Laughter) Hey, one of our - Wait a minute - one of our - Kleenexes we're using to wipe the windows with is stuck in the - the gear thing. (Laughter) There it goes.||CDR|Okay.||CMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR|Okay, and back on down.||CMP-EVA|Well, let me see here - backing down - let me see, which way do I -||CDR|Straight down.||CMP-EVA|Okay.||||Tape 171/14||||CDR|I got your leg.||CMP-EVA|Got my leg?||CDR|Okay, on the left, make sure that the - -||CMP-EVA|Wait a minute, let me - What? Swing on the leg, or what?||CDR|Just kick it down, you'll be free. Kick your -kick your right leg down.||CMP-EVA|There we go. Okay.||CC|Hey, Ron. We assume the scissors went out the hatch. Is that affirm?||CMP-EVA|(Laughter) I didn't see a thing.||CDR|Can you pull it - let me get your umbilical.||CMP-EVA|(Laughter) The only thing I saw go out was the - -||CDR|Okay, Jack - -||CMP-EVA|--...||CDR|Ron, Ron, how's the hatch? Get down on the hatch. Your OPS isn't fitting through the top. Pull yourself down. Straight forward. Face down. Nose down. Now back.||CMP-EVA|Okay. How's that ?||CDR|Now back. Keep coming. Keep coming. Now, can you reach the hatch?||CMP-EVA|Yes, makes it sort of ... Let me get back in a little bit.||CDR|Okay.||CMP-EVA|Let me get this visor up. One of them, anyhow. That's a pretty Earth up there.||||||Tape 171/15||CDR|Okay. Keep - keep your - -||CMP-EVA|Keep your hand on the - the hatch here. ... crescent Earth.||CDR|Wow, does the seal look good to you, while you got your nose there?||CMP-EVA|Yes. Wait a minute - -||CDR|Check that stuff on the . ..||CMP-EVA|Got a cassette going out the window, there. Okay, it's clear.||CDR|Okay.||CMP-EVA|You'll have to look.||CDR|Kick that back.||CMP-EVA|Okay, now I think everything's clear out of the hatch.||CDR|Okay.||CMP-EVA|You see, the reason we put that - -||CDR|Okay.||CMP-EVA|Can we get rid of the - instead of pulling the pip pin, we put this little hex nut, see, because I can reach down there and grab hold of the - -||CDR|Okay. Start pulling.||CMP-EVA|- - the hook and pull - and here she comes.||CDR|Okay, she's coming. Here she comes.|10 15 47 23|CMP|Okay, and I'm already back inside here.||CDR|Okay.||CMP|Man, it's dark in here!||||Tape 17l/l6||||CDR|Okay. You got to - when you made your first turn, you got a pull light, there.||CMP|Wait a minute.||CDR|Okay, get a couple turns on it.||CMP|Okay. There's one turn on it. I mean - I - I can release it?||CDR|Okay, now get it back.||CMP|That's a little harder to pull shut than I - -||CDR|The hatch is coming.||CMP|Yes, I thought it was.||CDR|Keep going.||CMP|That's as far as it will go.|10 15 47 58|CMP|Let's see, does that line up with these little marks on there?||CDR|Okay; and the hex is clear. That one's in good shape. Close the hatch and - Okay. Verify lock pin dropped in, white to white.|10 15 48 08|CMP|Yes. Okay, we're white to white.||LMP|Okay, stow actuator handle, ACTUATOR HANDLE in NEUTRAL.|10 15 48 14|CMP|ACTUATOR HANDLE is NEUTRAL, and it's stowed.||LMP|Okay, you still got white to white?||CMP|I still got white to white.||LMP|And the dogs over here look good to me.||CMP|The dogs look good, let me see if my pencil mark is on there.||||||Tape 171/17||CMP|Yes, they're lined up.||LMP|Okay. GEAR BOX SELECTOR - LATCH. Verify.|10 15 48 31|CMP|GEAR BOX SELECTOR is verified LATCH.||LMP|Okay. Cabin repress.||CMP|Wait a minute, I got to close the - Oh, okay, now I - -||CDR|Let's get this, then we can start on cabin repress, okay?||CMP|Okay. Side hatch dump valve, close.||LMP|Okay. Side hatch dump valve, close.|10 15 48 46|CMP|Okay, we're closing it.||CMP|You know, it's funny. We didn't see anything come up around that crazy ... we put in there, but as soon as I opened the hatch, the whole world came out.||LMP|Okay.|10 15 49 11|CMP|Okay. Okay, it's closed.||LMP|Okay, on 326, REPRESS PACKAGE, OFF.||CMP|Stand by. Well, we got all the stuff in there.||LMP|Got it all.|10 15 49 24|CDR|Okay. REPRESS PACKAGE is OFF. Ron, on 601, 0g - REPRESS O2 OPEN and ... CLOSED. Cabin pressure, 1 psi.||CMP|I can't see what the - -||LMP|Geno, then you'll have to give us a hack on 1 psi if you can.||||Tape 171/18||||CMP|Wait a minute.||CC|Gene, we're watching. We'll give you a hack at 1 psi. No problem.|10 15 49 46|CDR|Okay, we're - REPRESS is OPEN.||CMP|And I can't get it off there. Wait a minute - -||LMP|It's going to come pretty fast, Ron.||CMP|I can't even - Wait a minute - I can't turn around far enough to see it.|10 15 50 03|CC|And, America, we see your cabin coming up. You're at 0.3.||LMP|Okay.||CMP|0.3? (Laughter)||CC|You're at 0.7, 0.7.|10 15 50 19|CC|Okay; turn it off, you're at 0.1 - I'll say again, 1 psi.||CMP|(Laughter) Okay.||CDR|Okay; give us a GO when it looks good, Houston.||CMP|Oh, yes. See the hatch - -||CC|America, you're looking good. No ...||CMP|Okay, we're going to go REPRESS - -|10 15 51 16|CDR|Okay, REPRESS - OPEN, and let it go to zero, Ron.||CMP|Okay.||CDR|We'll end up with about 2 psi. Can you see the gage?||CMP|Well, wait a minute. Let me turn ... I think I'm still hooked ... There we go. Okay, I can see -Wo, that's temperature. Okay, here it is.||||||Tape 171/19||CDR|No, no. I mean the REPRESS O2.||CMP|Oh, the REPRESS O2?||CDR|Right in front of you.|10 15 51 44|CMP|Yes, it's almost zero. Oh (laughter) I was looking at CABIN PRESSURE.||LMP|No, REPRESS 0 .||CMP|It's about zero.||CDR|Well, when you think it's zero, you can - -||CC|Okay, Gene, we got - we're indicating 2 psi down here at this time.||CDR|Okay, Ron. If it's zero, you can close REPRESS O2 valve.|10 15 52 03|CMP|Okay, we'll close the REPRESS O2. What the -Okay, ... place for a valve.||LMP|Okay, we're going to let your flow bring ... rate.||CMP|Okay.||CDR|And your next move, after we get a hack at 3, will be to disconnect your OPS hose and hold it directly into the cabin volume - -||CMP|Okay.||CDR|- - and we'11 get your OPS ...||CMP|Would you - would you believe I'll let you do that?||CDR|Yes, I would.||CMP|(Laughter) Okay, because you'll be going through this thing.||CDR|Yes. Yes, I'm almost down there, now.||||Tape 171/20||||CMP|Say, Houston, I was surprised when I closed the hatch here. It came closed real well, up until about an inch from the - Can you see the CABIN?||CDR|No.|10 15 52 59|CC|Ron, we're watching the CABIN. It's 2.2. I'll give you a call at 3.||CMP|Oh, okay; mighty fine, Bob. I was going to say the - when you're closing the hatch, I expected it to come all the way closed, you know? And it came to within about an inch of the - of being closed on the outer - not the inside, but the other side, and wouldn't come any more, unless you really pulled on it.||CDR|Yes.||CMP|So and then your - Of course, it was pretty easy to pull because you're kind of flattened down in there anyhow. You just pull it closed, and then once you get the lever over the - over the center, it comes right closed.||CDR|Okay, Ron, what I'll do when we get up to 3, I'll disconnect your OPS hose, Jack, and I'll let you pull it around behind his back. And, then, you can hold it in the open cabin and I'll actuate his OPS.||LMP|Well, we got a lot of use out of that OPS.||CMP|Yes. Let me actuate it, okay?||CDR|Okay. I'm glad I didn't have to earlier in the week.||CMP|Well, me, too, you know. I'm glad I didn't have to today either.||CDR|Yes, I am, too.||||||Tape 171/21|10 15 54 13|CMP|You know, my gloves are dirty, but I think they're dirty from getting ahold of that - those dirty suits of you guys, you know. Jack, did you get ...||LMP|Okay.||CMP|Well, you know, you want to see if there's any residuals from the thrusters out there, you know. Well, I couldn't see anything anywhere except the - on the EVA handrails themselves. And that really didn't look like it was a residual to me. It's just a discoloration, and it's kind of a changing of the condition of the - whatever is on those things, you know. Hope they're not painted. I guess what I'm saying is that they were shiny burnished aluminum, I guess, or whatever, prior to lift-off, but now they're kind of a dirty-looking burnished stuff.||CDR|Okay, Ron, when they give us that 3, I'll get your hose. Jack can hold it in the cabin, you can activate your OPS.||CMP|Okay.||CDR|Then we'll watch the cabin come up to 5, and then the OPS will come off, then we'll get a HIGH O2.||CDR|How we doing down there, Houston? This is America.|10 15 57 06|CC|America, you're looking great. You're up at 2.6. It's going up slowly, just like we expected.||CDR|Okay.||CDR|Not a bad performance by my CMP, was it?||CMP|(Laughter)||CC|Was beautiful. We had a beautiful television show. Really beautiful.||CMP|(Laughter)||||Tape 171/22|||10 15 57 50|CDR|Well, we got three packs here all snuggled away.||CC|Yes, indeed, you made a lot of people in the back room very happy.

Looks like everything worked out great. You're at 2.7 and climbing very slowly.||CMP|(Laughter)||CMP|Hey, Houston. Tell Chuck Stahl [?] that attitude for the EVA was outstanding.||CC|Thank you, Ron, he's listening right here, and he's been on the console during the whole period. Got a big grin on his face right now.|10 16 00 36|CC|And, America, the cabin is at 3 psi.||CDR|Okay, Robert, we're pressing on. Okay, Ron, I'll get your - -||CMP|Can you get them off?||CDR|Yes. Okay, Jack, if you can get the - hose from behind him.||CDR|Okay, go ahead and activate it, young man.||CMP|You got ahold of it, Jack? Okay.||CDR|Yes, hold on to it tight.|10 16 01 13|CMP|You feel anything? Yes, it's really blowing in there.||CDR|Okay, we'd like a hack on the cabin when we get to 5.||CC|Roger, America. We'll give you a hack.||||||Tape 171/23|10 16 02 03|CDR|Probably can ... that out. O2 HIGH FLOW, Jack, that's a MASTER ALARM ... There it is. Yes ...||LMP|That's the main regs coming in, I'll bet you.||CMP|Must be the main regs cutting in. (Laughter) That's right, you can't see MASTER ALARMs, can you?|10 16 03 54|CC|Okay, America; you got 5-1 cabin press.|10 16 04 00|CMP|Okay. I'm coming off.||CDR|Okay, and I'm going ...||CMP|Okay. I'm going to pop the CABIN out there if I don't turn mine off pretty quick. Okay. Oh, no, It didn't come up that fast. There's not that big a hurry. We're waiting a long time to get -to get from 2 to 3. Yes, you get a HIGH O2 FLOW.||CMP|Yes, my - Oh, your accessory bag is In there, I guess. The - the gloves.||CMP|Just let me get the tone down here. Ding, ding, ding, ding. Okay, I got it. I think we did, didn't we?|10 16 06 02|CMP|Yes, if we can't find that one, let's find another one. Got to have something to stick - stick my gloves in, you know. Yes, the thing you put your gloves in, you know? There it is, right there. Yes, you got to use yours. (Laughter) Okay.|10 16 06 45|CC|America, Houston. Your cabin pressure's up to 5.5, 5.5.||CMP|Okay, we'll turn this off now.||CDR|Okay, we're right now at the point where we're going EVA STATION 02 OFF.||CMP|... off my clothes? Por favor.||CDR|||||Tape 171/24||||CMP|Yes.||CDR|||CMP|We're supposed to stick them in the bag, aren't we?||CDR|... bag.||CMP|Okay.||CMP|Smells kind of funny in there. What'd you guys do? (Laughter)||CMP|Surge tank. Ohhhh, yes, it's 700 now, 725. Is that what that - Yes, that's why -||CDR|Better turn the ...||CMP|There we are. Okay, I'll turn the TV switch on. Well, we're really not transmitting down.||CMP|Okay? Yes, we can go to FILL. We got 600, 700, let's see - -||CDR|Okay. ... FILL on the REPRESS at this time.||CMP|How low do we take this down to? 400? Probably stop before that, anyhow.||CMP|Okay.||CC|America, Houston.||CMP|Yes, go ahead. Go ahead, Houston.||CC|Roger. Ron, just two reminders here while you go through your unsuiting and cleanup procedures. We're trying to get established on a new biomed cycle, so we'd like to have the LMP on biomed. We'll be coming up with a complete scheduling here shortly, and just a reminder for the LMP and the commander, we want to make sure we retrieve their PRDs.||||||Tape 171/25||CMP|(Laughter) Okay, that's a good point.||LMP|Okay, I gave you a PRD about 2 hours ago, and just to bring you up to date to where it was, and we'll keep them out.||CDR|And commander retrieved his yesterday.||CC|Yes. No problem. We just want to make - reminder. We just want you to be reminded that we need them.||CMP|Take mine out now. Wonder if I got any zaps when I was out there?||LMP|Thank you, Bob. I even forgot that I reminded you to remind me.|10 16 11 02|CMP|(Laughter) And 15055. I didn't get very many rads while I was out there, I guess. Like it was 51 this morning. Okay? Here, I'll hold this thing.||CMP|How about giving me a squirt? (Laughter)||CMP|That right there. Yes, three of them. I threw away all the dirty ones, I think. (Laughter) The whole time. Boy, it - Yes, it sure whipped out through there when I opened the hatch.||CC|Sure wish you'd seen the scissors go.||CMP|(Laughter) I'll bet - hey, I'll almost make a bet with somebody that it's down behind the optics.||CMP|Okay (chuckle). They don't look dirty to me, do they? Wash them off, anyhow, though.||CMP|Wait a minute, let me push them back ...||CMP|Should have used hot water. Or is that thing cold, you mean? Is that cold? Boy, that is cold, isn't it? No, it doesn't fold there, just stick the whole thing in there like that. No.||||Tape 171/26||||CMP|Yes, now let's use some of that good food tape that's stuck over there. And there's some on the side of the - the light. You can use those to tape those holes ... Yes, just the mapping camera. Yes, that's all. No, just the map. Oh, it has? There's a chunk.||CMP|There's your hole through there. Oh, yes, we got a lot of tape, I'm sure. We want to tape this whole thing here.||CDR|Okay, Bob, we're in the process of cleaning up the cassettes - -||CMP|The breather holes - see the holes in this panel.||CC|Say again, CDR, you were cut out on VOX there.|10 16 15 30|CDR|Okay. I forgot Ron was still on VOX during this. I just wanted to keep you up to date. We're -we're taping up the cassettes now and cleaning them up and getting them stowed.||CC|Roger. Good show.||CMP|I'm sorry. I led myself astray. Yes, overlap it, because it won't stick to that thing very good. Wo, it just won't stick ... We'll just take tape and wrap all the way around the thing. Otherwise, it's not going to stick, period. Yes. It's up? That's right. (Chuckle)|10 16 17 04|CMP|Oh, we've been doing this for two or three flights, you know. Why change it for the last one? Yes, probably one all the way around. Get your corner, there. Yes, we got another roll of that tape you guys brought. Just about that size, I guess. You got it? Yes, they're down here. We missed them. (Laughter) Yes.||CMP|Keeps the light and the water out of it, I guess. Wot the water because you got a breather hole, but keeps the light out that film slot.||||||Tape 171/27|10 i6 18 44|CMP|Two of them are around this way.||CMP|Does take a lot of tape, doesn't it?||CMP|Yes, sure doesn't stick to a cassette. Sometime. I couldn't find mine. They must have been in the other set of gloves. I forgot about them. Well, that's ... No, there's nothing taped.|10 16 23 15|CDR|Okay, Bob, we're on 3-20, and we're all going to get out of our suits and stow them before we get the center couch back in.||CC|Roger, Gene. Sounds good.||CDR|And I guess I can get some DAP changes for you, if you'd like.||CC|Stand by on that.||CC|Okay, Gene; you're - you can go ahead and do the DAP change.||CC|America, Houston. Just one update. We won't give it to you as an update at this time, but wherever you see IR work just ignore it. Do not turn the IR on and no need to open the IR cover. We're through with it until just prior to entry interface.||CDR|Okay, Bob; understand that.|10 16 29 14|LMP|UV is ON.|10 16 29 29|LMP|And the UV cover's, coming OPEN.||CDR|Okay, Bob, I'm going to go down through the Flignt Plan down through about 259:45, get this maneuver started. And then we can press on.||CDR|Hello, Houston; America.||CC|Go, America; Houston.||||Tape 171/28||||CDR|Okay. I'm pressing on through the Flight Plan to about 259:45, and getting everything up to and including the maneuver, and then we will continue with our post-EVA.||CC|Okay. We'd like for you to hold on that maneuver, Gene. Don't start the maneuver.||CDR|I've already started my roll. Do you want me to stop it?||LMP|And did you copy the IR was ON and the COVER OPEN?||CC|Okay, we copy that. IR ON and the COVER OPEN.||LMP|I'm sorry. I was UV - ON. UV COVER, OPEN.||CDR|Hello, Houston; are you reading America?||CC|That's affirmative, America. Houston here.||CDR|Okay. Did you get the word that it was the UV -ON and the UV COVER, OPEN?||CC|Roger. We got that word.||CDR|Okay. And I'll stop my roll at 270 degrees and will not maneuver until I hear from you.||CC|Roger.||CDR|You're not getting a good key down there, by the way.||CC|Say again, Gene.||LMP|Houston, your keying is cutting you out, I think.||CC|Okay; are you reading me now?||LMP|Yes, that was good. Did you understand Gene's transmission on his stopping the roll?||CC|That's affirmative.||||||Tape 171/29|10 16 33 15|LMP|Houston.

You're cleared to go to the VERB 49 maneuver as published in the Flight Plan.||LMP|Okay, Bob.||LMP|Houston, would you like OMNI Alfa now?||CC|Negative. We'd like you to go to OMNI Charlie for now.||LMP|Oh, I'm sorry. Okay, OMNI Charlie, right.||CC|No need to apologize. The Flight Plan says Alfa; we're just going to Charlie, which is the best antenna.||LMP|Well, that's all right. I misunderstood what Gene just told me about his maneuver.|10 16 46 40|CC|America, we'd like OMNI Alfa.||CDR|Say again. You're cutting out badly.||CC|We would like OMNI Alfa. OMNI Alfa.||CDR|Okay. You said OMNI Alfa. We'll go there.||CDR|Houston, you read?||CC|America, Houston. Your comm is going to be a little ratty until you get into configuration here - or rather get into attitude.||CDR|Okay, Bob, I'm reading you now. Say again please.||CC|I just said it's going to be a little bad comm until you get into attitude, se we should hold this for a while.||CDR|Okay. Then when we get there you want OMNI Alfa. Right?||||Tape 172/2||||CC|That's affirmative.||CDR|Okay. We'll give it to you when we get there.|10 16 49 51|CC|America, Houston. If you. have somebody handy to the panel, we'd like to take the FANs to OFF.|10 16 50 03|CDR|Roger. H2 tank 2 FANs, OFF.||CC|Thank you, Gene.||CDR|We're OMNI Delta. We're reading you loud and clear. Do you want us to stay here?||CC|That's affirm, Gene. That's a good show. It's right - you know, it's right on the line there. It - Delta shows better on the signal strength and Alfa shows better for location. So let's stick with Delta.||CDR|Okay.|10 17 07 12|CC|America, Houston. Please advise us of how you axe going to handle the waste stowage vent. Is that open or you going to close it now?||CMP|It's open right now. -But we're going to close it here shortly. Do you think we need it closed now?||CC|Negative. It's your option. We Just want to know what - in case we get an 0FLOW HIGH, we might understand what it's from.||CMP|Oh, I see. Okay, we'll close it after a bit here.|10 17 13 22|CC|America, you might be interested in - while you're1 doing all this hard work up there you might be interested in how some of the Texas football teams have fared. Houston had a toughy today. Cincinnati took them 61 to 17.||CMP|... Wait a minute.||LMP|Houston - took who? 6l to 17?||||||Tape 172/3||CC|That's what they tell me. And the other one is those - the biggy up at Dallas right now. The Giants leading the Dallas Cowboys in the third period 21 to 3. 20 to 3; I'll correct that, 20 to 3.||CMP|Okay. 20 to 3. New York over Dallas, huh?||CC|That's what it looks like. That's in the third quarter.||CMP|Okay.|10 17 16 19|CC|And, Ron, we're going to do a site handover here in about 4 minutes, and we may lose some lock here||CMP|Okay. That's all right.||CC|And how's the post-EVA checklist coming? You chugging along.||CMP|Oh, chugging along. We've got two guys that have their suits off now.||CC|Roger.||CC|Well, they say it always takes longer up there than in the - Got all evening to do it. There's no hurry on it.||CMP|(Laughter) That's right. Hey. Hope North American doesn't think I was badmouthing their spacecraft down there, because you know - a little bit of blistered paint on it, that doesn't hurt anything. It's still a dam good spacecraft.||CC|No, I don't think North American even - I think they think it was just great, but I don't know if I'd ever go to Bethpage if I were you.||CMP|(Laughter) Okay.||CC|Ron, that was such a great show, I don't think anybody would care. That was just tremendous.||||Tape 172/4||||CMP|(Laughter) Okay, Bob.||CDR|Okay, Houston. This the CDR backup.|10 17 18 20|CC|Roger.|10 17 25 16|CDR|Houston, America; the WASTE STOWAGE VENT valve is CLOSED.||CC|Roger, America.|10 17 38 37|CDR|Hello, Houston; this is America. Looks like the repress package is up, and surge tank is back up. Would you like us to turn the cell off and turn the 02 heaters off.||CC|Geno, EECOM says affirmative to all that.||LMP|Okay, Gordo. How you doing?||CC|Pretty good. I saw Ron's stroll around the service module. Looks like he had a ball.||LMP|Yes, he did.|10 17 52 15|CC|America, Houston; over.||CDR|Go ahead.||CC|We have ... up the DSE, so we'd like you to go ahead now and do the maneuver listed at 26l. Give us the high gain so we can dump it. Over.|10 17 52 44|CDR|Okay. Maneuver's coming at you.||CC|Okay. And for your information, charge number 5 just went off. It was a 3-pounder, and it's jiggling the instruments on the surface there properly.||LMP|Very good. Any new word on the gravimeter, Gordy?||CC|I haven't got it yet, Jack. Let me check. Have you heard anything since you asked me the question last night?||||||Tape 172/5||LMP|Well, whatever it was - No, I haven't heard anything.||CC|Okay. I'll try to get an update.||LMP|I was thinking of the lunar surface gravimeter, not the traverse. They apparently don't want to talk to me about the traverse gravimeter.||CC|Okay. We'll try for info on both of them.||LMP|Okay. Any other new stuff you might have heard or get a hold of, I might be interested in.|10 17 58 28|CC|Okay. America, Houston; we need OMNI Charlie, please.||CDR|Houston.||CC|America, Houston. OMNI Charlie, please.||LMP|Hello, Houston. How do you read?||CC|Okay; loud and clear. Go ahead.|10 17 59 36|LMP|Okay. We apparently - in our struggles up here inadvertently hit the WASTE WATER to DUMP and it1s back in RELIEF now. That dump is terminated; we have 30 percent waste water.||CC|Okay.||LMP|I'm not sure what we had when it started. I just noticed the streaming. I don't think it was on very long.||CC|Roger.|10 18 06 00|CC|America, Houston.

HIGH GAIN's not going to work in NARROW, now. Wait a while; It's in a skin reflection area.||LMP|Yes, I'm having the same problem there - I noticed the same problem. How's this, leave it In WIDE?||CC|That will be fine.|10 18 09 54|CC|America, Houston. We'd like you to go to REACQ now, wait 30 seconds, and then go to NARROW.|10 18 10 43|CDR|Hello, Houston. We're turning the CABIN FAN, OFF, for a while.||CC|Roger.|10 18 13 20|CC|America, Houston. We'd like NARROW beam width.||LMP|Thanks for timing 30 seconds for me, Gordy. I think that was beyond me.||CC|You're welcome.|10 18 14 33|LMP|Doesn't look like It's going to make it, does it?||CC|No, it sure doesn't. Stand by 1, and we'll give you an alternate plan here.|10 18 15 20|LMP|I'm back in WIDE.||CC|Roger.|10 18 17 27|CC|America, Houston. We're going to have to have the high gain for the dump and also for a little additional work with the HF antennas and the sounder that we're going to read you here in a minute. So, in order to get it, we'd like you to pitch up 20 degrees in your present attitudes; and when you get there, then we ought to be able to reacquire and go NARROW.||LMP|Okay.||||Tape 173/2||||CC|Once you get the antenna locked on in NARROW it will track back to this attitude, and that's what we'd like you do is come back down to this attitude, once you get the antenna locked on.||LMP|Okay, Gordy, we got a good lock now.||CC|Okay. Fine. Well, then go right on back to the program pitch attitude there, and it should hold.||LMP|In work - in work.|10 18 20 l4|CC|America, Houston. We'd like to have somebody go to panel 230. I'll give you switches real time, save you writing them all down to get a couple of things cranked up here. Over.||CDR|Okay. What do you want at 230?||CC|Okay. Basically what we're going to do is turn the IR OH with the COVER, CLOSED, to keep it warm so you can do that IR, ON, now. And then we're going to put out the HF antennas and listen to HF getting some data on background noise from the Earth. If you'll put HF ANTENNA 2 to EXTEND, we'll give you a cue when to go OFF when it's all the way out. Over.||CDR|Okay. HF ANTENNA 2 to EXTEND on my MARK.|10 18 21 18|CDR|MARK it.||CC|Roger.|10 18 24 01|CC|Okay. We'd like HF ANTENNA 2 to OFF, please.|10 18 24 17|CDR|Okay. HF ANTENNA 2 is OFF. It maintained barber pole all the time there. Ir never went gray until we turned it off.||CC|Okay. It probably isn't out yet. The reason we had you stop was because the recorder that's watching that broke down, down here. We got to get that back on line.||||||Tape 173/3||CDR|Okay.||CC|While you're waiting there, I can go over the football scores for the weekend, if you wish.||LMP|Just a minute. Let's see if we can get Ron on a headset.||CC|Okay.||LMP|He's walking - he's walking around here thinking he doesn't have to do anything any more after that EVA, but we'll get him back to work.||CC|Roger.||CMP|Okay, Houston. We're ready for those scores now.||CC|Okay. Just 1 second, Ron. I think we've got another switch for you here.||CMP|Okay.||CC|Okay. We'd like to take the sounder HF ANTENNA number 1 switch to EXTEND. We'll let the motor on 2 cool off. We do have the recorder fixed, so we can watch 1 now.||CMP|Okay. Number 1 is going to EXTEND. 3, 2, 1 -|10 18 27 18|CMP|MARK it; barber pole.||CC|Okay. I've got the whole list of scores here; some of these were yesterday you probably heard of, but I'll just go through them all. San Francisco beat Minnesota, 20 to 17* Miami made it, I guess l4 straight, l6 to 0 over Baltimore. And Buffalo beat Washington, 24 to 7, how about that? Cleveland beat the Jets, 26 to 10. Kansas City beat Atlanta, 17 to l4. Green Bay won over New Orleans, 30 to 20. St. Louis beat Philadelphia in a close one, 24 to 23. Denver beat New England, 45 to 21. Detroit beat the Rams, 34 to 17; and Oakland beat the Bears, 28 to 21. And here's some sad news. The Giants beat Dallas, 23 to 3.

All three of my teams lost today.||CC|Roger.|10 18 29 36|CMP|Hey, number 1 just went gray on the lunar sounder.||CC|Okay.||CMP|And I'll turn the switch to OFF, if you want.||CC|That's affirmative. OFF on 1 and then on 2, we'd like you to go to. RETRACT- for 10 seconds, then put her in EXTEND, and we'll watch it.|10 18 30 11|CMP|Okay. RETRACT, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and about 10, I guess. Okay, then I'm going to -|10 18 30 29|CMP|EXTEND, now.||CC|Okay.|10 18 31 55|CC|Okay. We'll take number 2 to OFF, please. And we're going to let the motor cool down for 15 minutes so you got at least that long until the next time we bug you.|10 18 32 07|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. It's OFF now.|10 18 49 07|CC|America, Houston. We'd like to try antenna number 2 again.||CMP|Okay.||CC|What we want is you to go to RETRACT for 10 seconds, and then, EXTEND.||CMP|Okay.

Back to EXTEND.||||||Tape 173/5|10 i3 49 47|CDR|It's going to EXTEND, now.||CC|Okay, and we're just wondering where you stood on the post-EVA checklist procedures.||CMP|Well, probably about 75 percent through. What we1 re doing is stowing all this stuff out here, and then we're going to go back through and check things off.||CC|Okay. Fine.||CDR|Gordy, did our little waste-water burn there hurt us or help us?||CC|I guess we haven't been able to determine yet.||CC|Okay. HF 2 ANTENNA, OFF.||CMP|Okay. It was OFF, when you called.||CC|I guess the motor is - -||CDR|And, Gordy - - ...||CC|- - just about stalled out. Doesn't seem to be much - making much - much progress there, so -Go ahead.||CDR|I was just going to say we took time out here to grab something to eat, cause it's been a long time between breakfast and lunch so a - I will try and do a little inventory here and give you a page and let you know about where it is.||CC|Okay. We're not intimating there's any hurry. We just were curious.||CC|Okay, a little more amplification on that antenna. The motor gets hot and it starts — slows down and stops making progress. But each time we make a little more progress to getting it out, and we're almost all the way. We're going to give it another cool-down period. We'll give you a call when we want to try it again.||||Tape 173/6|CMP|Okay. Sounds good.||CC|I do have a bunch of short Flight Plan updates, none of which is very close in the future. So any time someone has nothing to do, I'll be glad to read them up.||CDR|Okay. Let's eat for a little while, Gordy.||CC|Fine.||CDR|Is it still sunny and cold back there?||CC|That's affirmative; it was clear and - were you talking about the Houston weather? Or the SIM-bay weather? The SIM bay's getting cold, also. It's cool, but it was sunny here today. It'll probably be a cold night since it's clear.|10 18 53 09|CDR|Okay. Thank you.|10 18 58 45|CC|America, Houston. We're ready to give another stab on the HF ANTENNA.||CDR|Okay.||CMP|You want to go RETRACT first, then for 10 again?||CC|That's affirm. Ten seconds RETRACT, then EXTEND.|10 18 59 09|CMP|Okay. Going to RETRACT and OFF.|10 18 59 22|CMP|Okay; going to EXTEND, now.||CC|Roger.||CC|Okay, Ron, it's getting out there inch by inch, but we got to back off and hit it again. Go to RETRACT for 10 seconds, and then back to EXTEND.||CMP|Oh, okay. I went to OFF there for a second, and I'll go to RETRACT now, and then to EXTEND.||CC|Okay.|10 19 00 54|CMP|Okay. I'm going to EXTEND.||||||Tape 173/7||CC|Roger.||CC|Okay, Ron, go to OFF, and it'll be another 10-minute wait.|10 19 01 47|CMP|Okay. We're OFF.|10 19 18 31|CDR|Hello, Houston; America. Are you ready to maneuver here to the UV stellar target attitude?||CC|Stand by; I'11 check.||CC|Okay. I guess everybody is in agreement. Go ahead and high gain should stay on during this maneuver.|10 19 19 09|CDR|Okay; we're maneuvering. I hope the Sun comes in the window on this next maneuver.||CC|Is it getting cool up there?||CDR|Well, I'm freezing something off.||CC|Hey, we got a little procedure to warm things up in the cockpit, if you'd like it.||CDR|We - we heard that earlier, and we're passing on that right now.||CC|Was it the one about turning INVERTER 3?||CDR|No, we didn't hear that one. Why don't you tell us what that one is.||CC|Okay, Cernan, put INVERTER 3 on MAIN A. That will put some heat load into the system, and then GO to MANUAL on the TEMP IN valve. Go down and adjust the EVAP OUT temperature to 59 degrees -make it 55 degrees, 55 degrees. And that should help warm things up.||LMP|Okay. We'll let you know if we give that a try and, Gordy, I guess we're ready to copy some of those Flight Plan updates.||||Tape 173/8||||CC|Okay. Fine. We'll keep an eye on the TEMP OUT so that - let you know if the - it's getting away. Let's see - let's start on - Stand by 1. Start on page 375 at 263 hours.||CDR|Okay.||CC|Okay. Down at 263:40 where it lists the jets to use for spinup or for damping, rather, we're going to change the jets to be used for damping, since those ones listed didn't work so hot last night. Want to use all of quad Delta. Delta 1, 2, 3, and 4 and Charlie 3 and 4, those six jets in place of the ones listed.||CDR|Okay.||CC|"Okay, and just to the left of that box delete ""IR COVER, CLOSE"" and ""IR, OFF."""||CDR|Okay.||CC|I guess - delete the deletion.

Turn over two pages to 265:20, and make the same jet changes for that PTC rate damping, all of quad Delta and Charlie 3 ana 4.||CDR|Okay.||CC|Okay, then turn over 1, 2, 3, 4, several pages -let me find the next one here.

Change that to ""Check CDR"" and then make it ""LMP doff biomed harness."""||CDR|Okay. I - I got those, but that's sort of slighting the CMP.||CC|Okay, we'll consider that. Go on to - -||CDR|That's harness - that's harnessing the commander.||CC|(Laughter) Roger. Okay; let's go to 285:10.||CDR|Okay.||CC|"Okay.

I got those.||CC|"Okay; next page is another PTC spinup, same change, ""Delta 1, 2, 3, and 4 and Charlie 3 and 4"" instead of the listed jets."||CDR|Okay.||CC|Okay, and then backtracking for one last one that was just handed to me; go back to 263:53-||CDR|Okay.||CC|"And the high gain antenna angles; change them from a ""-40 and 90"" to ""20 and 180."""||CDR|Understand; plus 20 and 180.||CC|That's affirmative and that completes the list.||CDR|What about 285:30 on the jets?||CC|I asked the same question, I think. Let me turn to it here. Yes, that one is a - just a short -a short run on it and they just as soon as it wobbles a little so they can leave those jets the same. That's for a UV scan.|10 19 29 21|CDR|Okay.|10 19 33 21|CC|Okay, guys, it * s time for another try on the HF antenna.||CDR|Go ahead.||CC|Okay.

Just a second.|10 20 28 33|LMP|Say, Gordy; this is Jack.||CC|Go ahead, Jack.|10 20 28 40|LMP|It may be in my imagination, but I thought I had a major blink in the light from the spacecraft, not just the floodlights but just generally. Did you have any glitch or anything on the traces?||CC|We'll take a look. Stand by. Give us your best guess on how long ago it was.|10 20 29 07|LMP|About - now about 20 seconds, maybe 30.||CC|Okay.||CC|America, Houston. Request the VERB 48 shown in the Flight Plan now.|10 20 31 16|CMP|Coining up at you.||CC|And we're - we're rechecking on the EPS data. A first glance shows It solid, but we're not sure if it might have been static during that time. We're taking another look here.||LMP|Gordy, don't make a big deal out of it. It may have been just my imagination or somebody hitting the floodlight switch, but it - we tried - I - Gene||||Tape 174/2|||||tried that again, and it didn't seem like what I saw. It was just a very quick blink in the lights.||CC|Okay. We'll - we'll still chase it down.||LMP|Okay.|10 20 43 14|CC|America, Houston. The state vector up-link scheduled for now won't be necessary.||CMP|Okay, Gordy. How's the old trajectory looking these days?|10 20 43 37|CC|They're still carrying about one-half foot per second. However, they're not in a period right now of real solid .track, I guess, and - so it - it'll take them some more hours to get a really good handle on it.||CMP|Okay.||CC|Nobody predicts any more maneuvers until midcourse 7 at the earliest.||CMP|What would it be at the latest?|10 20 49 12|LMP|Hey, Gordy; Jack.||CC|Go ahead, Jack.||LMP|I fail to understand why sill my friends who used to operate the backroom, even though it's Sunday, why they haven’t given you a sort of an interim report on what they - what they think happened at Taurus-Littrow. They usually have those things available.||CC|Well, I did - you mean, the whole geological summary?||LMP|Well, just the general thing that they pass around after a - a day or so, I think, is the time frame they work in.||CC|Yes, there has been such a thing that I think you're referring to. I guess there's a more formal version coming that's supposed to be due out tomorrow||||||Tape 174/3|||morning, but there was a summary, fairly lengthy, on entire science, including the field geology, which I'll try to dig up and maybe read to you if you wish. Over.||LMP|Well, I don't need a lot. I guess it might be useful to have a general summary maybe tomorrow morning some time, if we have some time in the Plight Plan, of what people have seen up to date on things that we wouldn't normally be familiar with for - in preparation for that press conference tomorrow.||CC|Okay. Sounds like a good idea. On the - your gravimeter questions, the TGE numbers for the comparison I believe you wanted, between the north and the North Massif and the Sculptured Hills, just aren't available. The whole TGE team took their data and - and left town, evidently. And - we -we have been unable to come up with any good numbers on that question. The lunar surface gravimeter — Okay, break - break here. We need a VERB 48 load as shown, and then - -|10 20 51 4l|LMP|It's already in, Gordy.||CC|Oh, okay. So you can go ahead and do the maneuver then. On the LSG, still no positive success. They've sent just about all the commands it can take with no luck at leveling the beam, and so they've decided to fall back and the whole team is regrouping to consider further course of action. They've turned off the command system to it until some time tomorrow when they'll try again, evidently, with whatever they come up with in their conference. Over.||LMP|Okay. We're certainly pulling for them, of course.||CC|Roger.||LMP|Gordy, do I have it straight, that it, apparently, it's a problem just in the leveling commands, or is it - it is receiving other commands, is that correct?||CC|That's the impression I have. I hate to - to say yes certainly. My impression is that it just won't - won't level. It - it will accept commands, but the beam will just not level for a - a reason that they just don't fully understand.||||Tape 174/4||||LMP|Okay. Does that mean that you might - Maybe you could ask Bob when you see him or something - does that mean the beam is not free, or is it not level?||CC|As I understand it - Stand by 1.|10 20 54 59|CC|"Jack, I got a quick agricultural explanation of the problem. (Laughter) Evidently, it's the two plates between which the beam itself is suspended are adjustable, so that - ""by ground command, so that by driving these plates back and forth, they try to center the beam between them. And then the -the data is initiated. When the beam vibrates between the plates, it changes capacitance, or at least that's the general principle. And the problem is that by drive, they can command the plates back and forth and stop the stop, but they cannot get the beam to leave - leave one of the plates. It just is hung up against one plate, and this would -could be caused by one of the wires that's suspended - sort of hang the beam, pendulum-fashion, being broken so that it has cockeyed off to one side. I guess that's the best guess as to the malfunction at the moment. It's presently in use as a seismometer returning data in that mode, but useless in its primary intended data-taking mode. Over."||LMP|Right. Did they see the beam leave the plates at all as I shook it there near the last of our third EVA?||CC|"I guess the answer to that is ""no."" They saw you jostling it around and could tell where you were from the data but have no evidence that the beam ever moved from the one plate."||LMP|Isn't there any possibility that the telemetry is giving them a false indication of not leveling - or not centering, I guess, would be a better word?||CC|Stand by.||CC|No, Jack. Evidently, they've eliminated that possibility. They're certain it's a problem - a mechanical problem.||LMP|Okay.||||||Tape 174/5|10 20 59 l4|CC|Jack, reference your - the blink you noticed or possibly noticed - we, looking at the data, see about 30 seconds prior to the time we think you mentioned that it happened but that's close to the time frame, I guess, a 1 or 2 amp oscillation in the main B voltage or current. And it only lasted for one or two data cycles, or like 0.1 or 0.2 of a second is all. We would like to know, though, approximately what setting all the floodlights are at right.now.|10 21 00 02|CDR|LEB axe full BRIGHT, and the left hand are about three-quarters, right hand's about three-quarters.

I took my comm carrier apart - or, you know, cut this little cloth covering that goes from the plug on up to the headset, what have you. And sure enough, there's two little broken wires in there; and the next one is a little bit - the next one to it is a little bit loose, also. But I found a little piece of metal, and I bent it to the - conform to the shape of the wire and I've got it taped up real tight right now. And I'm going to see if it works for a while - make sure it doesn't cut in or out, you know, or something like that.||CC|Okay; good luck.||CMP|(Laughter) Okay. Of course, I still have the lightweight headset. I'd just as soon wear the comm carrier for the reentry, if possible.||CC|Roger. Say, we've investigated a little more on that possible spike that was alleged by Jack -thought he might have seen. And we mentioned, I think, in response to that, about a 1 or 2 amp jump. Well, looking further, we see those all along; and we think they're probably due to minimum-impulse jet firings. We're trying to correlate that data. But the conclusion, right now, is that we really don't see anything on the data to support what Jack might have seen.||CMP|Okay, mighty fine. We - just wanted to - you know, in case there was something there - wanted to make sure you all took a look at it.||CC|You bet.||CMP|Yes. Knobby. Okay, Knobby, where are you? Hey, I can see a few stars out there on this side of the window.||CMP|Can't see anything there.

Okay, Houston, and we'll torque at - if you're all set, anyhow.||CC|Yes, we're all set.||CMP|Okay, about 58:45.||CC|Okay. And then, when you do that, we want you to stop the PTC right now. But we want you to use the jet configuration - configuration we used to start at - That's - all of quad Delta and Charlie 3 and 4, rather than the jets listed in the Flight Plan. Over.||CMP|Okay.||CC|And while we are mentioning jet configurations, that jet configuration is - this is another change to a change to a change, and we're sorry about this. But we want you to use those jets, all of Delta and Charlie 3 and 4, for every stop and||||Tape 175/4|||||start of PTC from here on out, all the way through the final PTC exit, just prior to midcourse 7, which is shown in the Flight Plan - and - and the way we want it, using coupled jets for that final one. But use Delta 1 through 4, and Charlie 3 and 4 from here on out for going in and out of PTC. And I can read you all the time so that applies to - if you can just remember it, that will save some writing. Your choice. Over.|10 22 20 17|CMP|I'll write it down here in the spacecraft somewhere.||CMP|... on the back here. Yes.||CDR|Gordy, you want Delta 1, 2, 3, and 4, and Charlie 3 and 4 for damping. And you want Bravo 2 and Delta 2 for spinup, as the Flight Plan says?||CC|That's affirmative. And the damping is for both entry and exit of PTC from here on out, except that final one, which is coupled just prior to midcourse.||CMP|Okay.||CC|And you don't need to wait until roll of 14. You can go ahead and stop it right now. We'd prefer it that way, as a matter of fact. Over.||CDR|Okay.|10 22 24 51|CDR|Is that a CDU glitch there, Gordy? We - Huh? We sure did. Hello, Houston, you read America?||CC|Yes. I was just trying to get an answer for you. Yes, it looks, at first glance, like maybe we saw one. Stand by. I'll get a better update.||LMP|Gordy, why don't you give me the best OMNI?||CC|OMNI Delta is the best right at the moment.||LMP|Well, we'll hang on to you here as we go. You were just on the verge of dropping out, but we'll stay with you on the high gain.||||||Tape 175/5||CDR|Yes, Gordy, our ball - our ball - let's see -reads about 256 ROLL, and YAW - and PITCH is 2 -about 227, and YAW is about 42 degrees.||CC|You know - evidently you definitely had a CDU glitch. We're trying to come up with an attitude that you can fly to on the ball as it stands right now in SCS. Stand by.||CMP|Houston, both the SCS and the IMU ball are okay, I think. They're both the same. Well, they're almost - yes, except for the GDC - except for the GDC drift, they're both the same. So the error is in the WOUW 20s in the computer.||CC|Stand by.||CC|Ron, does the - does the GDC and the IMU attitude agree right now?|10 22 28 19|CMP|Yes, they do. They agree, you know, except for the 2 or 3 degrees of GDC drift is all.||CC|Roger.||CMP|And there's our NOUN 20s on the computer now.||CC|Roger.||CC|America, Houston. What we'd like you to do is -Were those ball angles you read 256, 04 - well, let's see - get the right order - 256, 227, and 042 - Are those still about where you are?||CMP|Yes, that's affirm.||CC|Okay. We're going to try to compute a - an attitude that can get us - to high gain so we have a little more visibility into the system. That's our problem right now.||CMP|(Laughter) Okay.|10 22 32 54|CC|America, Houston. What we'd like you to do is roll l80 degrees to about 076 roll attitude.||||Tape 175/6||||CMP|Okay, we'll roll her back to 076.||CC|Okay. Then once you get there, the HIGH GAIN angle should be a PITCH of minus 50; and YAW, 205. Over.||CMP|Minus 50 and 205. Okay.||CDR|We're on the way, Gordy.||CC|Okeydoke.||CDR|You might check. I was loading NOUN 22. And you might just doublecheck and see what you saw down there and make sure I wasn't loading NOUN 20.||CC|Okay, good call; we'll do that.||CC|Can you give us best OMNI as you roll around?||CMP|Okay, we'll try||CDR|Okay, it's OMNI Delta now.||CC|Roger. Loud and clear.|10 22 35 57|LMP|Houston, I doubt if it's a problem, but the UV cover's still open.||CC|Roger, Jack.||CC|Okay, we'd like you to zero the CDUs now.||LMP|Looks about right.||CDR|Looks good, Gordy. It matches the ball.||CC|Roger. We see that. We're getting high bit rate now, by the way, also.||CDR|I don't know. You can track it down, but I called up NOUN 20 to check the roll angles, and It was not what we were using in the book here, of 14 degrees. And I very easily could have - could have loaded 20 instead of 22.||CC|Okay. We'll sure track that one down.||||||Tape 175/7|10 22 37 28|CDR|... if that were the case.||CC|America, we're ready now for you to proceed on per Flight Plan with the VERB 49 to the sleep PTC attitude. We have not had a chance to go back over the data, but we'll give you a call as soon as we get a chance to check it. Over.||CDR|Okay, Gordy. One other interesting thing while we went back and looked at NOUN 22 after the glitch. We still had the NOUN 22 angles I had loaded for the previous VERB 49 at 263:40, which either -even makes me feel more like I did not load 22 on this next time around.||CC|Yes, it sounds - it sounds like we might have the problem nailed down, but we'll doublecheck that.||CDR|This is a gross admission, if that's the case; but I'd rather have it that way.|10 22 4l 35|CC|We won't hold it against you.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 176/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|10 22 42 11|CC|America, Houston.

I'll stand by until you check that gimbal lock out.||CC|Stand by. WeTre checking that. Your answer is negative, Geno.

Can you give us AUTO and NARROW on the HIGH GAIN? Present angles are okay.||LMP|Okay, Houston. The computer knows where the stars are anyhow.||CC|Okay.

Yes, I had - and also the glitch occurred when I did the final ENTER, so - plus we had the two-axes glitch and a number of things. I'm -I'm glad you confirmed that. Makes me feel better.||||Tape 176/2||||LMP|We were discussing whether or not you needed an EMP or not.||CC|Well, there must be one for the situation.||CDR|Getting a little quiet up here anyway, Gordy. That one sure snapped us out, though.||CC|Us also.||CDR|Hey, how far are we from home?||CC|Well, I can give it to you in hours from entry interface right away - 38 hours 42 minutes and 4 seconds. And in miles, you're 143 500.||CDR|Okay, thank you.|10 22 56 33|CC|Picking up speed all the way.|10 22 59 29|CC|America, Houston. Over.||CDR|Go ahead, Gordo.||CC|I've been talking to Don Beaty and Dick Kruse and looking over a transcript of - of a science press conference we edited up. It was kind of ragged but possibly interesting summary of the science as it stands now. In response to your question of - of items that might help you prepare for tomorrow's press conference, I can come with you with those words any time you wish.||CDR|... you can come up with them now.||CC|Okay. Let's start with the - the LSPE. All eight charges have now been exploded, and they were all on schedule and produced excellent signals . These data were used in conjunction with the ascent stage lift-off and also its impact data, which should give us an excellent picture of the geologic structure of the outer 3 kilometers of the Moon. This little summary I'm reading right now is - was written by Joel Watkins. The geophone array is functioning beautifully and||||||Tape 176/3|||"and we're already talking about its potential in a listening mode for study of meteorite impact frequency J We still don't have precise EP locations from Ray Batson, so the following interpretation will almost certainly be changed when we get better data and field tapes, which we will use to refine our arrival times. Bearing the above in mind, my preliminary interpretation is as follows. The low-velocity layer seems to be thicker and higher in velocity than at either Apollo l4 or 16 sites. I think this may mean that the low-velocity layer here includes dark mantle material as well as the regolith. Details of the higher velocity substrata are fuzzy, but velocities increase with depth in a way which would be consistent with a thick accumulation of lava flows. This probably represents the subfloor material. And he concludes by saying, ""You guys did a great job, see you after splash."" On the same subject, Dr. Kovach went a little further, and he just recently admits to seeing evidence of two high-velocity layers, especially after the 6-pound charge was fired, that - that evidence showed up. He a]so mentions in - mentioned in his press conference yesterday that the - the data point allowed by the - the ascent-stage impact was - was very important -the fact that they - they got it in about 9 kilometers away and the - that data is right in a critical range where - where they see a big change in the - the percentage of - velocity change. I'm getting kind of balled up here in the words, but that data is very important because it's in -where the steep gradient of velocity change occurs. On looking through here, I guess, in - in summary, I'll read a couple of sentences again out of the press conference. We do find evidence of lunar crust as we did in the past, but we may have to thin it considerably. We may have, in fact, have to thin it as much as to 25 kilometers instead of 60 - that they believed it was up until now. And they're thinking they may have to lower the velocity of seismic ways - waves in the mantle, which, I guess, at last guess was around 9 kilometers per second. Now it's looking more like 7-5, and the crustal velocity is probably as low as 6.3 kilometers per second. Okay, yes. That was - that last data was really from Dr. Latham, and he was"||||Tape 176/4|||||interpreting that data mainly from the S-IVB impact and readings from some of the other seismic sites. Any questions on that? I realize that this is pretty ragged. Over.||LMP|Oh, that's - that's great, Gordy. Did Kovach indicate his tentative depth for the second high-velocity layer?||CC|No. As far as the information we have here, he's just - I - I don't see any - the only thing I can see is he mentions we're getting a depth sample down to 3 to 4 kilometers, but that was before all the charges had gone off. So I think, as I say, he just doesn't really state that yet.||LMP|Yes, it's a little early. Okay, good. Sounds like what we saw in the field to a certain extent.|10 23 06 09|CC|Okay. On the heat flow, it's continuing to work perfectly. It's stabilizing out and, at the present time, they show about a degree centigrade per meter gradient. Apollo 15 is stabilized at about 1.8, and it looks like the 17 site's headed for about the same, which gives consistent data for the two sites. It looks like that's what is going to result when it reaches final equilibrium. And so that - if you call that - those two sites typical of the Moon, then that leads one to the following conclusions; that that data requires that there be a total greater abundance of radioactive isotopes on the Moon as compared to the Earth, so there would be an implication here for a fundamental difference in the composition between the two. And the higher number of isotopes would in turn require that they be located very near the surface, implying substantial differentiation of the material, at least compositionally or stratisfactionally [sic]. It's not necessary that it had have to be stratified. It was only required that it be stratified in most of - in that most of the isotopes be concentrated in the upper layers of the Moon. I guess that's about what we've got on the heat flow at the present time. Over.||||||Tape 176/5||LMP|Gordy, does he indicate where his minimum temperature lay - zone is now at the site?||CC|Stand by. Let me look through here.||LMP|I think you mentioned something the other night -about - I thought you said 2-1/2 meters, but I'm not sure.||CC|Let me just read it straight off here. There is some words to that effect, but it doesn't sound like 2-1/2 meters. At a large scale - let's see, he's describing a viewgraph here - the surface temperature at the time of this sample was 360 degrees Kelvin. At a depth of about 15 centimeters, it had dropped to 280. At about 65 centimeters, the temperature drops to 254, and that's the lowest temperature we see. Below that depth, the temperature begins to increase again, and it's 257 at the bottom of the probes. Over.||LMP|Where was the 254 again?||CC|At 65 centimeters below the surface.||LMP|Okay. That's about the same, I think, as 15-Very good. Some of our double cores will get that deep.|10 23 09 57|CC|Roger. Okay, the TGE has produced some - fair amount of excitement around here - and interest. The instrument really worked beautifully. It had some baro switches that turned it on for temperature control - right aft - during lift-off - and so it had 3 days to stabilize before you got to Taurus-Littrow. And on landing, the bias measurement showed that the bias shift was extremely small, so they feel that they had a very accurate reading on all the readings. And I mentioned the other night that the number they got for the gravity field at the landing site should allow them to actually revise the value for the radius of the Moon at the landing site. But then you asked me about some of the variations in reading around the valley there. Well, it turns out that - if you call the landing site zero on the scale of milli-gals and then take the differences from the landing||||Tape 176/6|||||"site, over to the South Massif, you have a minus 36; in other words, a lesser amount of gravity. And all these numbers, by the way, are corrected only for elevation, and there are some more sophisticated corrections to - to be put on them. But the - with - correcting for elevation, you have a 36-milligal negative anomaly at the South Massif. And the number at the North Massif was a minus 26. And there is very little difference, within a milligal or so, between the North Massif and the Sculptured Hills site. But you can see that there's a significant difference between the landing site and the foothills on both sides. The Shorty Crater showed a slight positive anomaly compared to the landing site, but it's less than a milligal, which is sort of -you start to think ""Well, that means a localized volcanic center,"" but it's - nobody's really going out that far on a limb. The - they were especially appreciative of the 2A stop, which was - let's see - well, it verified the extremely sharp gradient of the anomalous condition from the foothills as you go back into the valley. The 2A stop - I'm trying to find the number here -Okay, one's a minus 36 at station 2 to a minus 29 at 2A, so it's - it really changes quickly as you get away from the - the mountains. Okay, he summar - summarized his feelings by saying that -the negative gravity anomalies which were measured right at the South Massif and the North Massif clearly indicate that the valley is filled with a higher density of material than the material which makes up the massif so that if the material underlying the floor at Taurus-Littrow - say, is basaltic in composition and has a density of about 3* the material which makes up the massif has a substantially lower density. He goes on to say that we're not sure exactly what the density difference is, but if it's as large as 20 percent difference, then the material in the floor of the valley and the - well, the thickness of the high-density material in the valley has to be on the order of about 1-1/2 kilometers thick. So that's a - I guess that's a minimum thickness, assuming the greatest difference in densities."||||||Tape 176/7|10 23 14 38|LMP|That's very interesting, Gordy.||CC|Yes. They're really - everything is really tied in the original theories on the structure and makeup of the valley. Everything seems to be falling right in there, and that's what has - has the whole crowd of scientists around here really smiling. Let's see - let me find out what's next here. Okay. It was Strangway's turn next, and he didn't have any results to present, of course, because he's got to get the tape back first, really. However, the orbital sounder - the command module sounder - when they made the pass across the site with the transmitter on - No, I got it backwards. When it was in a listening mode, listening to the ground transmitter's signals, they found that the signal was in exactly the frequency range that it was supposed to be, and they - they picked up the -exactly the right sequence rate, once every 0.8 second. And when they calculated the power levels, that we were putting out just exactly the 1 watt that we were expected to put out. So that - that everything looks good as far as the operation of the transmitter, and without going into all the details which you know as well as I do about the thermal problems on the receiver, they're still -well, he sums it up, we have no reason yet to be sweating it too badly. They're very hopeful that when the tape gets back, we'll have good data on at least some of the legs, and they're - they're waiting for you to bring it to them. Dick Kruse is here, and he mentioned that all your pains, Geno, in brushing dust off of it probably saved the day. If it's there, it was just due to that, that it did work, because it was really on the ragged edge here.|10 23 17 32|CC|About what's left, I think - is the field geology interpretation. And what I've got and can get tonight because there's no one really around here from the geology team at this time - it's about 11 o'clock at night - is so rambling that I'm not going to bother to read it to you. But I will leave a request so that when Parker get you up in the morning, maybe he can summarize that or answer any questions in that area that you might have. Over.||||Tape 176/8||||LMP|Okay, Gordy. Thank you very much.||CC|No trouble at all.||CMP|Hey, Gordy. Everything under control at the homefront?||CC|"Yes, Ron. As a matter of fact, talked to Jan and, well, her words to summarize the - the whole show that you put on this afternoon was ""out of this world,"" which is, I guess, a pretty good way to put it. Jon and Jaime were speechless when you waved and called hello to them. And Jan closed by saying that you - you're going to have to hurry home and help rebuild the wall that was broken out by a huge mob of people that were in your house this afternoon during the EVA. Over."||CMP|Well, that's okay. We like a lot of friends, and I'm glad everybody enjoyed it and pass my love on - to everyone.||CC|Okay, will do.||CDR|What about the other side of the tracks, Gordy? Got any words from over there?||CC|Hey - I haven't really talked to anyone in the other two families today. So I'm sure that everything is fine or we would have heard it, but I'll try to get a last-minute update on that before you hit the sack.||CDR|Okay, thank you.|10 23 20 28|LMP|Gordy, this is Jack.||CC|Go ahead, Jack.||LMP|Did you have a table there of the various gravity readings, and if so, what did we get at Van Serg? In your - relative to - to the landing site -landing point?||||||Tape 176/9||CC|No, Jack. I don't have that. I'll ask, but I think the ones I gave you, the four places, Shorty, North, South, and Sculptured Hills, are all we got. But I'll check.|10 23 24 03|LMP|Okay.|10 23 24 10|CC|America, Houston. The rates look good now. You're clear to spin it up.||CMP|Okay.||CDR|Gordy, I'm sorry. I'm going to move.||CDR|Gordy, this isn't my day. I'll give you the damping again.||CC|Okay, fine.|10 23 31 10|CC|17, Houston. We're ready for spinup.||CC|17, Houston. We're ready for spinup.||CDR|Gordy couldn't hack it any longer, huh?||CC|He's getting some more news for you.||CDR|Okay, we'll try and get it right this time.|10 23 33 08|CDR|I think I got it for you this time.||CMP|Houston, America. Are you ready for REACQ and NARROW on the HIGH GAIN?||CC|That's affirm.|10 23 35 59|CMP|Okay, you have it. REACQ and NARROW.|10 23 52 22|CC|America, Houston. We'd like to verify the present setting of the high gain knobs. We want minus 40 and a plus 90.||LMP|Gordy, that's verified.||CC|Okay, thank you. I - I have a number of sort of cleanup items before going to bed that I can give you any time.||||Tape 176/10||||LMP|Why don't you go ahead?||CC|Okay. We'll be calling you for the IR, OFF, before you go to sleep. Want to leave it ON right up to the last minute, I guess. Let me see if we can do this next one. Okay. Why don't you just go ahead and do this one? FANs for sleep - number 1, OFF, and 3 in AUTO.||LMP|Okay, we got that.||CC|And there'll be no cryo stir necessary. You can leave the OPTICs power switch ON, which will increase the heat input and keep it a little bit warmer in there. You won't have to turn that off per the presleep checklist, if you don't wish to. We are going to change the biomed - -||LMP|Okay.||CC|- - tomorrow, in deference to the CDRs intimated request anyway, and let the CMP take the next shift where in the Flight Plan it now calls for the CDR. It was really our mistake on the original change. I guess there's no need to call all those detailed Flight Plan changes now unless you want to copy them. A reminder also, prior to going to sleep, to bump the cabin up to 5-7 with the OPS to start getting the gas out of the OPS. And I checked with the remaining two homefronts, Jack. Your - I talked to your mother and sister. Everybody's fine there, and they watched the top of your head a little bit this afternoon on the EVA. They're looking forward to seeing you tomorrow on the press conference and back on Earth shortly thereafter. I got one from Nassau Bay, too, if the commander's listening.||CDR|He's listening.||CC|Okay, Gene. Your mother and family have arrived. They - in fact, they just walked in from a party with Barbara. They all wish you to hurry home and send their love. Over.||||||Tape 176/11|10 23 59 22|LMP|Houston, how do you read 17?||CC|Okay, 17. Loud and clear now. How me?||LMP|You're loud and clear.||CC|Okay. Did you - did you get the homefront update for the commander?||CDR|Yes, I got it, Gordy, and that's great news and news I wanted to hear, and you can return my love to them for me if you would.||CC|Sure will. That completes our list of goodies with the exception of the normal presleep stuff, and we'll be standing by for that from you.||LMP|Okay. And you can tell the Arizona people, next time you talk to them, I tried to get more of myself out in that television picture but the CMP saw to it that my umbilical was limited in its length.|11 00 00 21|CC|Okay.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 177/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|11 00 18 13|CC|America, Houston. I'll turn you over to the crew astrologer here. Pleasant dreams.||LMP|Thank you, Gordy. And we enjoyed the day with you. See you tomorrow.||LMP|Well, so much for that handover.||CC|You guys call while we were unplugging?||LMP|Haven't you learned better than to unplug with an interval between?|11 00 36 20 .|LMP|Houston, we're going to turn the CABIN FAN, OFF, for a while. Sorry; it's already OFF.||CC|Okay; we copy. CABIN FAN is already OFF.||LMP|That's right. It turns out the request was to turn it on, so we will.||CC|Okay, understand you're going to turn the CABIN fan, ON. I think that's to keep it a little bit warmer in there for you guys.|11 00 36 54|LMP|MARK it. MARK it.|11 00 38 27|CC|America, Houston. We'd like to talk to Captain America, please.||CDR|Give him about - 5 or 10 minutes and he'll be with you.||CC|Okay; have him give us a call when he gets ready.|11 00 38 4l|CDR|Okay.|11 01 18 50|CC|Apollo 17, Houston. We'd like to talk to you guys before you go to bed, please.||CDR|Go ahead, Bob.||||Tape 177/2||||CC|Okay, we panicked there, I guess, or we got our -change, we - because we saw you go VOICE, OFF, and we wanted to talk to you guys about two or three things before you went to bed. For one thing, we don't see the cabin pumped up yet with the OPS as per Plan and we don't have the onboard read-outs yet, and we'd like to find out who's going to be on the comm and talk to Ron about his headset. I guess the general concensus of opinion down here, unless we know more about the fix, is there are some possible serious consequences, like blowing up the audio panel, if those wires did get together and short out, depending on which wires they are. So there's some concern about that.||CDR|Okay, let's get you the read-out first, and we're going to bounce up the cabin here very shortly with the OPS.||CC|Okay, we'd also like to get the INFRARED to OFF, please - the IR.||CDR|Okay, it's coming off here shortly. Okay, Bob, the RC - RCS reads 65, 57, 6l, and 60.|11 01 21 46|CC|Okay, copy those.|11 01 23 27|CDR|Houston, are you reading America?||CC|I'm reading you now. The last thing we got from you was the RCS quantities. We didn't get the bat quantities.||CDR|You haven't heard Ron at all?||CC|No, haven't heard Ron a bit.||CC|Sounds like the headset - -||CDR|Well, I'll tell him to try again.||CC|No, America, we're not reading Ron at all, right now.||||||Tape 177/3||CDR|Okay, he's been on the lightweight headset talking to you all this time. Wait a minute, he's going to check a couple switches.||CC|Okay. Which headset is broken? The Snoopy?||CDR|Yes, Ron's - Ron's Snoopy helmet.||CC|Okay.||CMP|Hey, are you reading me now, Houston?||CC|I read you loud and clear now, Ron.||CMP|Okay, I'm wearing the lightweight headset, now. On the comm carrier, there's a whole bunch of wires, about eight of them - looks like they're twisted pairs, you, know, twisted in fours really. They come up through the thing. And two of those eight wires are cut - are broken in two. The hot end, or the end that comes up from the plug going toward the headset - those two wires both come out individually and individually taped, each one of them. And then the whole group - you know, I bent them out of the way so they wouldn't be touching anything. So they wouldn't touch insulation or tape. I bent them out of the way and taped the whole side of it just to keep the rest of them from breaking in two, and it looks like a pretty good fix on the thing, really. However, if you have any concern about blowing the audio panel -I'll just go ahead and wear the lightweight headset.|11 01 25 22|CC|Okay, Ron. Yes, the concern here is not only which wires they are - the potential does exist if one of those shorts to ground to blow the audio panel or at least a circuit breaker, depending upon which wire it is. I gather that what you've done - is that you haven't wired the broken wires back together, but it's just sort of covered the bare leads and wired them out of the way. Is that right?||||Tape 177/4||||CMP|Yes, that's correct. It was too close to the -there is a stiff piece of plastic that comes out of the headset itself, out of the bottom of the left earset, and it's broken off too close to the bottom of it there to - to strip the wires down and wire them together at all.||CC|Okay. Roger on that. I guess - let us think about it here overnight. Offhand, our opinion is, as long as you've got a spare headset, let's wear the spare headset - that spare meaning a lightweight. If you're going to be on comm tonight, I guess we offhand suggest wearing the lightweight tonight. Over. How does that strike you?||CMP|Okay. Yes, no problem. I won't be on comm tonight, but I'll be wearing the lightweight headset anyhow. The only time I was thinking about it - wearing the other one at all - would be for entry, and there's no problem there. I'll just stick to the lightweight headset around my neck and put that one around my ears just to use as a bump pad, is all.||CC|Okay; let us think about it overnight, and we'll talk to some people about it. Let's see, is Jack going to be on the headset tonight and the biomed, both?||CDR|Yes, Jack will be on tonight with the biomed and the headset.||CC|Okay. We'd like to get one more valve check there, America. Like to check our WASTE WATER TANK INLET valve to AUTO. EECOM says he is in a flat portion and he can't verify that right now by buildup.||CDR|Okay, stand by 1.|11 01 27 57|CDR|WASTE TANK INLET is in AUTO, Bob.||CC|Okay, thank you on that, Gene. And we did not get the BAT read-out for the onboard read-out for the night, BAT C and pyro BATs A and B.||CDR|Okay, guess you weren't reading. We're at 36. 5» 36.9, 36.9, in that order.||||||Tape 177/5||CC|Okay, we copy that. And let me ask you a question here, Gene. Right now you're an hour behind getting to sleep. Do you want to sleep the 8 hours or get up by the Flight Plan?||CDR|No, let's get up per the Flight Plan. We're very much aware of - of that; we've just been doing some restowage and a few other things around here. But let's get up per the Flight Plan and fine.||CC|Okay. We'll talk to you in the morning. As soon as the cabin is pumped up, you're GO for sleep and you can turn VOICE back OFF, at your convenience.||CDR|Okay, you'll see the cabin pumped up, we'll go to 5.7 and turn the OPS back OFF.||CC|Roger. We'll be watching.||CDR|Okay, babe. Take care.|11 01 28 57|CC|See you in the morning.|11 01 34 33|CDR|We're looking at 5*7 in the cabin.||CC|So are we.||CDR|Bob, are you going to want to do that again tomorrow?||CC|Yes, Gene. I will do it again prior to finish emptying the OPS.|11 01 35 12|CDR|Okay.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tapes 178-181/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|||REST PERIOD - NO COMMUNICATIONS||||||Tape 182/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|11 08 20 01||(Music: We've Only Just Begun by The Carpenters)|11 08 23 09|CC|Good morning, America.

On lunch he had also - positive now - lemonade, two pecans, and one-fourth of a chocolate bar. Okay. And -last night, he had about 5 hours of fair sleep, no medication, and 2-1/2 cans of water. And his PRD is 17060? That's right, 60. Okay. For the LMP, day 12: He did not eat for breakfast, pears. For lunch, looks like he ate it all. For dinner, he did not eat the tomato soup, half a hamburger, mustard, pudding, and that's it. And add to breakfast another cup of coffee - bag of coffee; excuse me. And the lunch, an orange drink, an orange-pineapple, another coffee, graham cracker cubes - four of them, two pecans, and one-fourth of a chocolate bar. And - his PRD is 24l88, and 6 hours intermittent sleep, 1-1/2 cans of water, and took one Lomotil last night, just as we were turning in, as a result of the Evans affair catching up with the LMP.

So we thought we'd recap the pro football action yesterday, in a rather strange day, since there were only - only two games that really made any difference. And I think the scores kind of showed the day. In the American Conference playoff games coming up next weekend, Oakland will play at Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh getting into the playoffs for the first time in 40 years. The Cleveland Browns will take on the undefeated Miami Dolphins, who have won l4 straight. In the National Conference, Dallas will be at San Francisco Saturday, and Green Bay plays at Washington on Sunday. Quickly recapping some of the scores from yesterday. On that sad, sad one here in Houston, Cincinnati rolled over the Oilers, 6l to 17. There were three touchdowns scored in the fourth quarter within less than 5 minutes of play, all on interceptions - on - the part of Cincinnati. New York Giants, it says, upset Dallas 23 to 3. I question the upset since Dallas was already in the playoffs; and, in what I watched, it looked like they were aware that they were already in the playoffs. Buffalo upset Washington 24 to 1'7. And again it's a questionable upset because 0. J. Simpson had a great day, and Larry Brown from Washington was kept on the bench||||Tape 182/6|||||for the whole game. Oakland, 28, over Chicago, 21; Detroit, 34, over Los Angeles, 17. Los Angeles' hopes for any playoff berth had been knocked out by San Francisco's win on Saturday, and it looked like they played that way on Sunday. Cleveland, in a real tough one up in New York with 30-knot winds and a - gale - gale-force winds and lots of snow and cold, defeated New York Jets, 26 to 10. Green Bay, 30, over New Orleans, 20, in a tough one, which saw two - two touchdowns being scored off of blocked punts. Kansas City, 17, over Atlanta, l4. And, again, Atlanta's chances for a playoff berth had been wiped out on Saturday; and, apparently, they played that way on Sunday. Denver, 45, over New England, 21; St. Louis, 24, over Philadelphia, 23.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 183/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|11 09 20 31|CC|Pittsburgh defeated San Diego, 24 to 2. On Saturday, Miami had taken Baltimore, 16 to 0, and, as I previously mentioned, San Francisco defeated Minnesota on Saturday, 20 to 17* Just one little note, Jack, you might be interested in this morning's paper, concerning the New Orleans Saints. Dave Parks from the New Orleans Saints has announced his retirement, and he kind of took a rap at the Saints in claiming that they were a team that did not want to win, and that he was retiring unless they would trade him to a winner. It sound like our friend over there might have some problems this winter come contract time. In pro basketball last night, the Houston Rockets beat the Cleveland Cavaliers, 110 to 109. Jack Marin had 35 points, Mike Newlin had 34. In college basketball, UCLA remains number 1 in the latest ratings. Second-ranked Florida State was beaten this weekend by Princeton, 6l to 59* Third-ranked Maryland won, as did fourth-ranked Marquette, fifth-ranked Minnesota, and number 6, North Carolina State. Indiana is rated 15th, Houston is l6th. We can't find Purdue, Kansas, or Cal Tech in the ratings right now. There's one bowl game tonight. Iowa State, who has taken a five-game losing streak into the Liberty Bowl, will meet Georgia Tech at Memphis, Tennessee. In local hockey, the Aeros and the Los Angeles Sharks of the World Hockey Association battled to a 4 to 4 tie.|11 09 21 59|CC|Now, for page 1 news. The outlook for a quick peace settlement in Vietnam has taken an apparent turn for the worse. The Hanoi government radio announced last night that U.S. planes have dropped more mines in Haiphong harbor and has also carried out bombing and rocket attacks on the city of Haiphong. There was no immediate comment from Washington on the charges. The snag in the Paris peace talks apparently hinges on a few key points, according to press association reports. Among them, the North Vietnamese will not accept the idea of two separate Vietnamese states and the method of policing a truce, the two-Vietnam policy being the major stumbling block. The weather here is||||Tape 183/2||||CDR|making news. Yesterday's reading at Intercontinental Airport was a frigid 22 degrees. Downtown Houston was 32. The airport reading was the lowest since 1932. Up north in the upper Midwest and northeast, it's going to be a white Christmas, and more snow is moving into the area. Chicago had a low of 5 above Sunday; Kansas City, 19; and Albuquerque, 18. Anne Armstrong, long a power in Texas Republican politics, is reportedly about to be named to a high post in the Nixon administration. Harry Truman still clings to life. The 88-year-old Presi -88-year-old former President is holding his own, according to his doctors. Debris found floating in the Gulf of Mexico off the west coast of Florida has been identified as that of a Coast Guard Helicopter that crashed. Earlier the chopper had rescued four fishermen from a sinking shrimp trawler. The helicopter was headed back to Saint - Saint Petersburg when it went down with the four fishermen and the crew of four. It's a lot safer up there where you are than on the Texas highways. The State Highway Patrol reported a high number of serious accidents on Texas roads this weekend. A Houston newspaper reports that industrial demand for Trinity River system water will not produce enough money to finance the project and that the City of Houston's water and industrial district funds will have to make up the difference. Meanwhile, the Clear Lake City Water Authority is tossing around a proposal that would require developers to pay 50 percent of the cost of all lateral water and sewer lines. Up around Conroe, in Montgomery County, a transformer blew up Sunday morning and electrical power went out for several hours. Several thousand homes were affected. Baytown was the scene of four armed robberies Sunday. Four business establishments were hit in a l4-minute period. The masked gunmen got about $500 cash. No one was injured.

We - we're just wondering if maybe you don't have the better material at your hands there than we've got down here as far any conclusions or preliminary estimates might be.||LMP|Okay, I just thought that you guys may have had some new ideas. We had a good briefing last night from Gordy on the surface experiments. I guess we might want to be updated on the orbital experiments, if there's anything new. And field geology, I guess we got a pretty good feeling for it, but I thought they might have had some new ideas, or something along that line.||CC|Well, I'm sure they do, and I don't mean to shortchange our geology - geology back room, Jack, but on the other hand, I think - I think really we're just waiting to get the answers from you or tie up maybe their thoughts with you. And I, you know, from a bystander's standpoint, if I read you anything that they've - maybe conclusions that they may have made, we just may be fudging the data because there's - -||LMP|I'm not looking for conclusions, I'm looking for ideas.||||Tape 183/8||||MCC|Hey, Jack.||LMP|Tell them don't - don't worry about it. You know, I just thought they might have something to say.||MCC|Yes, they got plenty to say, Jack. But they're down here and they can say it, and I think what you ought to say up there is what you're familiar with and just confine it to that.||LMP|Oh, you can count on that, Deke, I just like to think about things.||MCC|Roger, you're going to have lots of time to do that.||CC|We'd like AUTO and high gain.|11 10 17 56|LMP|Okay, you got AUTO.||CC|Thank you.|11 10 23 09|CC|America, Houston.

You know, we've still got it out. We thought we'd, you know, stow it later this afternoon sometime .||CC|Okay; fine.||CMP|You know, after we can dump it again.|11 11 33 43|CC|America, Houston. Your cabin Is down to 4.8 now, so you're cleared to dump the OPS at any time. And we expect with 1100 pounds it would pump it up to about 5.7, so we'll probably have to stop you prior to reaching zero.||CMP|Oh, okay. Hey, mighty fine. We'll do it.||CMP|Okay, Houston. That OPS is dumping now.||CC|Roger, Ron. We'll watch it.|11 11 39 48|CC|America, Houston.||||Tape 184/2||||LMP|Go ahead.||CC|We've identified a humber of cracks and crevices up in the - in the area - any area above the couch plane along the X-axis or just above the couch plane that could possibly be places where the scissors disappeared to. And we would like those areas searched if they haven't been searched already. As an example, the crack between the top of the main display panel number 2 and the - the hatch opening area, that kind of crack and crevice area there. We would like that looked into. I kind of assume you've already done that. We don't want you to remove any panels or anything like that to look in. But have you looked in those areas, or do you plan to look in those areas here shortly?||CMP|Hey, Bob, I've looked in some of those things. But just to make sure I've covered everything and the fact that we checked it again, why don't we go over it again.||CC|Okay.||CMP|Wait a minute and I'll get my flashlight, and then we can start doing it again systematically.||CC|Okay.||LMP|It's scissors, my dear Watson, scissors.||CC|Seriously, it would have saved a lot of problem if you'd seen them floating out, Jack. We would have just not had to have done any of this.||CDR|Houston, America.||CC|Roger. Go ahead.||CDR|Bob, it looks like we're going to make it on this OPS depress. She's reading 0, and she's just barely bleeding out. We're somewhere around 5.5, so I'm just going to let it bleed out now. And then we'll stow it.||CC|Real fine; real fine.||||||Tape 184/3|11 11 47 11|CMP|Okay, Houston. Checked it out above MDC number 2.||CC|Okay; and - -||CMP|Also, looked - -||CC|- - there was the area around - -||CMP|Go ahead.||CC|- - each of the plus XX - the XX struts and the PLV vent there, and the other XX strut. You might check - pay particular attention to that area.||CMP|Yes, we checked that. And also checked it again now.||CC|Okay. From our pictures, and this may not really be the case, on the - above main display panel 3, where it says - where the handhold, the structure part of handhold, looks like there's some cracks and crevices right above - right around that handhold area that could, between the handhold and panel 6, that a pair of scissors could slip up into.||CMP|Okay. We're looking around there, and it doesn't look like they could - Well, they could possibly fit in there maybe. But, anyhow, we checked it, and they're not there.||CC|Okay. And then on the other side of the cockpit in the same area around handhold, back behind the -that crevice area back behind the COAS power panel, panel 15, and the handhold. And then also that little area in front of the handhold, where - the cutout for main display panel 2, you might look -take your light and look in there.|11 11 49 06|CMP|Okay. I'm over there now.|11 11 50 51|CMP|Okay, Houston. No joy on that part either.||CC|Okay, Ron. The next couple are really down in the lower equipment bay area, and then I've got one area up in the tunnel - two areas up in the tunnel that are suspect areas, and then that does it. Which would you like first?||||Tape 184/4||||CMP|I'm up in the tunnel, now.||CC|Okay; the tunnel area. The only thing we show up there is the - the four handholds around the -around the tunnel. I don't think scissors could get up there, but there - they - maybe they could slip in something like that. Anyway, those four handhold slots up there, you might check in those two areas.||CMP|Those scissors couldn't fit in those handholds, but it's good to check them. Something else might be in there.||CC|Okay. The - Oh, in the other one up in that area, Ron, and I assume you - you've put that outlet bag over the cabin fans - and we wouldn't want you to fool with that at all, because it's probably all full of dirt and everything - but if you didn't, then the outlet to the cabin fan area might be a potential place.||CMP|Let's see. We installed that the first day out, I think. And it's been on there ever since.||CC|Yes, we assumed you did. I just was trying to cover all bases here. Okay; the last three items -I think you've actually called one of them - are down in the lower equipment bay. One of them is the - the crack just below panel 101, down in the lower equipment bay. I think you called that one the first night, didn't you?||CMP|Wot below 101; no.||CC|Okay. Our pictures show a crevice below 101, and also while you're right there, I - I don't think it's even - there's a crevice above the door for the optics stowage area that you might check up in there. It might have lodged. And, also, while you're right there, Ron, our picture, of course, shows your hoses stowed, and they kind of come out right there to the right of panel 120, the optics stowage area. And so you've got some area behind those panels - behind those hoses and that - where it might have lodged, but I believe you had to move those in order to do your EVA yesterday, anyway.||||||Tape 184/5||CMP|Yes, the hoses in the tunnel have all been moved around in here, as far as the hoses are concerned. I still think the biggest probability is - is right above the optics stowage, and that's what I was talking about before. Because it's about - oh, an inch. You know, the crack is at least an inch deep in there and as long as the optics stowage thing itself.||CC|Okay; and let me - We'll have one more recommendation for you.||CMP|Okay.||CC|And then over panel 250 there's a little bitty opening - It shows in the pictures - over panel 250.|11 11 54 50|CMP|Okay; we'll check that in a second here.||CC|Our only thoughts, Ron, on the - any other position that you might see - You know, if it's above the couch plane and you really think it might be a suspect area, you might consider taping the crack, if you desire. The tape probably isn't going to hold it in if it wants to come tumbling out, but it - it's something you could do if you wanted to.||CMP|Okay. Yes, I understand that, Bob. That's a good point.||CC|And, Ron, while we're talking to you, we'd like to tag up with you on one more item unrelated to the scissors search, and that is your headset situation. And we just want to leave the - make sure you're going to do as was said last night and will not plug that - the headset with the broken wire, you will not plug in again, and we'll arrange your entry configuration in some configuration that does not require that headset to be plugged in. Is that affirm?||CMP|Yes, that's affirm, Bob. I think what I'll do, I'll wear it as a bump hat, you know, and then -and then use the lightweight headset with the -|||you know, with the earplugs underneath that. I'll put the lightweight headset around my neck, and||||Tape 184/6|||||then have the mike sticking up in front of me, and with the earplugs on. I - I tested that configuration; it's comfortable. No problem. It'll work. And I will not plug in the camm carrier at all.||CC|Roger. We just wanted to tag up with you on that. That's what we'll be expecting, and we'll - we'll put this to bed forever.|11 11 58 06|CMP|Okay; mighty fine.|11 12 02 33|CDR|Houston, America.||CC|Go ahead.||CC|Go ahead, America.||CDR|Okay, Bob. We got the major compartments inventoried and stowed, frankly, with the exception of the things we need, of course, between now and then in the sleeping areas and what have you. We'll finish that off, of course, as we finish up with gear and as we get up in the morning. But there's very little left to do, and any contingency weight changes, which there may be just a couple at the most, we'll inventory those and give them to you in the morning.|11 12 03 23|CC|Roger.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 185/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|11 12 28 29|CC|America, 17- Say again. 17* Houston.||CMP|Go ahead.||CC|I've got an interesting little press release here.

It's not exactly clear.|11 13 03 57|CC|Jack, we agree with you that it's not clear, and FA0 tells us we want the two - same two subjects wearing the blindfolds as on the transearth coast as was on the translunar coast.||CDR|Okay.

No problem.||LMP|I may put them on just to watch.||CC|Roger.||LMP|It's the only movie we have this afternoon.||CMP|Houston, America.||CC|Go ahead.|11 13 11 4l|CMP|Roger. Would you ask the Surgeon to check and see if the command module pilot is alive and well|11 13 12 00|CC|Okay. They're seeing data. It looks sort of squirrelly and - but it looks - they want it to settle down for a little while.|11 13 12 33|CMP|Better go VOX.||SC|...||CDR|Got to unplug that there.||CMP|Yes, I'm ready.||||Tape 185/4|||11 13 14 43|CDR|Okay, Bob. CDR and CMP have got their blindfolds on.||CC|Roger.||CMP|I got it.|11 13 15 12|CDR|Okay. We're starting.|11 13 16 42|CMP|Houston, this is Ron. While we're getting dark adapted here, probably won't see any for a while. Let me just record on the tape my impression of these light flashes as they occurred around the Moon and at other times. In general, they've all been essentially - just a - as - as it says - a flash, with a - with a little bit of a glow, and usually in one eye or the other eye. And for some reason, most generally, they've been kind of -if you - you don't want to say it's in - it's in the periphery of your vision, because you get the feeling that maybe there was a flash over to the left or down to the right or something like that. But you don't get a distinct impression as to where the flash came from. Well, you can -you can see where it came from, but not - you can't see the flash itself. Like it was just beyond your vision. Most of them have been like that. At one time and one time only throughout the flight, I can remember kind of a triple flash, so to speak. And in that case, there was a bright flash in the left eye on - on - about 10 o'clock in the left eye. And then it repeated itself again about 2 o'clock in the left eye. And then about, oh, 10 o'clock, a quarter of the way out, in the right eye. I just got a bing, bing, bing, just like that. Three - three of them right in a row. And the rest of the time, though, they've all essentially been single flashes to me.|11 13 18 4l|CDR|This is Gene here. I'll just remark that both Jack and I did see them on the lunar surface. I guess the best summation I can make of that is I think I saw both lines and - and the spots or the flashes a little bit more sharply, but that might be because of the adaptation - dark adaptation||||||Tape 185/5|||in the IM prior to going to sleep was probably a little bit better. And I'd guess - It's awful hard to tell time when you're under - when it's dark, ... but I guess I want to say they were quite frequent, and I'd say that means two to three a minute now. That could be way out, but that's what I'd guess.||SC|(Cough)|11 13 34 03|CMP|(Cough) ... in my ... or something. I don't see anything.||SC|(Cough)||CC|America, Houston. We haven't heard anything. Have you seen any flashes at all?|11 13 44 34|CMP|Haven't heard a - I haven't seen a thing, Bob. Can't understand it.||CDR|Same here from the CDR. I haven't seen anything.||CC|Roger. I understand. Your heart rates are down pretty low, like maybe you fell asleep or something.|11 13 44 50|CMP|Oh, no. Well, the LMP dozed a couple of times but - I thought I saw one, Bob, but I'm not sure. I squinted hard about that time. I may have just triggered something.||CC|Roger. Okay. We're just standing by.||LMP|The last time we were in PTC, were we not?||CC|Yes, you were, and that's one reason you had to copy it down, because we kept losing comm on you.||LMP|Yes, as I recall, they seemed to come In batches when - when I was taking notes. Is that what you people observe - or recorded, rather?||||Tape 185/6||||CC|That's affirmative, Jack. And the thought that occurs, of course, is that you may be blocking with the shielding on the spacecraft somehow.||CMP|Houston, has my biomed settled down?||CC|That's affirmative.|11 13 49 19|CMP|Okay.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 186/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|11 14 06 33|LMP|No, I still fail to see any flashes. I rotated 180 degrees along the rotation axis along Z and saw no change. LMP.|11 l4 10 11|CC|America, Houston. The light flash observation time is up, and we'd - we'd like to move on into the Flight Plan. And this call - It is for Ron - -||LMP|Hey, Robert.||CC|The EMS entry check is on - at 281 as shown. We'd like you to do that now prior to the maneuver, which is at 281, or delay it until about 281:50 when you're not maneuvering. We'd like to do that check when you are not in - not maneuvering.||CMP|I'll go ahead and do it now. What's going up this minute - coming up here?||CDR|Okay.||CMP|Let's see what's coming up first.||CC|Okay. You can do it now. You've got about 5 minutes prior to the VERB 49 maneuver.||CDR|What would that be? SMS check? Okay. Why - why don't you go over it now?||LMP|Your eyes all right?||CDR|Give yourself a chance to open your eyes.||LMP|Yes.||CMP|That must prove something, the fact that we didn't even see them, huh?||CC|It would probably tell you that there's a point source, and the spacecraft is blocking it somehow.||CDR|Or the Earth. Or the Sun.||LMP|I believe it.||||Tape 186/2||||CC|Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. If I wanted to get technical, something's blocking them. That's right.||CDR|(Laughter) Much as we have been seeing them, I can't believe that. Okay, Ron. Why don't you go ahead and do that, huh? I just put mine up.|11 14 12 58|CMP|Okay. I'm on page 1-3, and the IMS FUNCTION is OFF. Circuit breakers are CLOSE. MS MODE to STANDBY. And FUNCTION to TEST 5 - or TEST 1. EMS to NORMAL.|11 14 13 11|CMP|Okay. The hairline is over the notch in the self-test pattern and in test pattern number 4. Okay; 0.05G light came on in TEST 2. Go to TEST 3.|11 14 15 02|CMP|Okay; it's 10 seconds, and the down light came on.|11 14 15 31|CMP|Okay; it's 58.O in the range counter. Okay; TEST 4. She's counting down, and trace went down. Going straight along.|11 14 15 56|CMP|MARK it. 10 seconds. 0.0. How about that? And it stops at the lower right-hand corner of the trace.|11 l4 16 36|CMP|Okay; with TEST 5, trace went up, and 10 seconds later the upper light came ON.|11 l4 17 02|CMP|Okay. We'll go to RANGE SET here. ... cool down a little bit. And the trace moves on up to zero. It looks like it worked good, Houston.||CC|Roger. Sounds great.|11 14 17 22|CMP|Okay; we'll go to STANDBY and OFF.|11 14 23 39|CC|America, Houston.||CDR|Go ahead.||||||Tape 186/3||CC|Just some words for Ron. When he gets into the P20 option 2, the maneuver there was tried on the simulator, and it got out to 71 degrees on the middle gimbal angle. And they got a gimbal warning light, although 71 degrees is the maximum yaw angle they got.||CDR|Okay; we'll try it.||LMP|Bob, for your recorded information there, mag Tango - Tango on the 35-millimeter camera -frames - let's see - 8 through 13 have the ALFMED prime observer position data on them.||CC|Roger. We've got it recorded.|11 14 30 24|CC|Just another piece of data, guys. On this maneuver you're in right now, it should go out to a 67-degree middle gimbal angle right in this maneuver.||CC|America, Houston. We'd like to close UV cover until we're in attitude now.||CMP|Okay; we'll close the cover.|11 14 32 4l|CMP|Okay; COVER is CLOSED.|11 14 36 12|CC|America, Houston.||CMP|Houston, this is America. Go ahead.||CC|Roger. We've got a procedure we'd like to go through to eventually put the ECS RADIATORS FLOW CONTROL over to AUTO, and we have a bunch -several steps we'd like to go through before you do that move.||CMP|Okay. Wait a minute; I'll write them down here so we can .. .||CC|Roger. Are you ready to read it - or copy it?||CMP|Okay. Go ahead.||||Tape 186/4|||11 14 36 48|CC|Okay. On panel 5, the ECS RADIATORS CONTROLLER circuit breaker AC1, verify CLOSED. Panel 2 ECS RADIATOR FLOW CONTROLLER to position 1. ECS RADIATORS FLOW CONTROL POWER to OFF, center then POWER. Wait 20 seconds. ECS RADIATORS FLOW CONTROL to AUTO. Over.||CDR|Houston, America.||CC|Go ahead.||CDR|Do you suspect it was a - a power glitch, or do you think the controller actually failed and you're just now verifying it?||CC|Negative on either of those cases. We've just had lots of spurious changes in the past history on flights. John's sitting here saying you had a number of times on 10, and so - since we're not - We just think the power controller probably saw a temperature glitch or something, and we think it will just come right back. No problem.||CDR|I - Come to think of it, I guess we did, now that he recalls it.||CC|We'd like OMNI Charlie.||CMP|Okay; you have OMNI Charlie.||CC|And while you're there, we'd like the UV COVER to OPEN now.|11 14 39 20|CMP|Okay; we'll open the UV cover.||CMP|Okay, Houston. I'm ready to proceed on this pitch maneuver.||CC|Roger.|11 14 40 34|CMP|And, Houston, the readback on the flow controller there. We'll check panel 5. ECS RADIATOR CONTROL circuit breaker AC1, verify it's CLOSED. Then we'll put the ECS FLOW CONTROLLER to position number 1. And we'll turn the ECS FLOW CONTROLLER POWER, OFF, then center.||||||Tape 186/5||CC|It's OFF, center, Ron, and then up to the POWER.||CMP|Okay. I couldn't figure out my writing. Okay; that's right. The power is OFF, center, and then -back to POWER. Then wait 20 seconds, and put the ECS FLOW CONTROLLER in AUTO.||CC|That's affirmative.|11 14 4l 05|CMP|Houston, America. You want to start that now?||CC|That's affirmative. Any time. And in case you're wondering - case you're wondering about that middle step, that's a reset to logic step by going off on the POWER and then back to POWER.||CMP|Okay.|11 l4 42 34|CMP|Okay. ECS FLOW CONTROLLER is going to position 1. Okay; ECS POWER is OFF, and it's back to POWER. And we're waiting 20 seconds.||CMP|Okay; FLOW CONTROLLER is going to AUTO now - and stays gray, it looks like.||CC|That's what we expected. And needless to say, Ron, we'll be watching your ECS system very carefully for you, just in case it flips back. We don't expect any problem.||CMP|Okay; mighty fine.|11 14 46 49|CC|And, America, Houston. I've got a midcourse 7 and a MIDPAC entry pad.||CMP|Okay. Just wait 1, please.||CC|Roger.|11 14 49 32|CC|And, America, Houston. We'd like to bring up the high gain, so we can get the dump going and get the data down. It's a YAW, plus 15; PITCH, 204. Say again. PITCH, plus 15; YAW, 204.||||Tape 186/6|||11 14 49 50|CMP|Okay. PITCH, 15; YAW, 204.||CC|Roger.||CMP|Houston, America.||CC|Go ahead. Go ahead, America.||CMP|"Okay; I assume this line in here, ""Stop pitch rate at l46 degrees,"" means stop at 146 degrees in pitch. Is that correct?"||CC|Roger. Stop at l46 degrees pitch.||CMP|Okay. Thank you.|11 l4 51 52|CDR|You've got the high gain, ... told us, Bob.||CC|And, America, Houston. I've also - besides these pads, I've also got a Flight Plan update. For the first one, item is at 282:10. Either one you want to take first?||CDR|Okay; why don't you go ahead with the Flight Plan update first.||CC|"Okay, Gene. At 282:10, manually - manual roll left 40 degrees prior to the VERB 49 maneuver. Insert ""Manual roll left 40 degrees."" And that'll give you a roll angle of 342 prior to starting that maneuver."||CDR|Okay; I've got it.||CC|Okay. The next one's quite a ways over. It's at 284:55-||CDR|Okay; I've got it.||CC|Okay. First thing at 284:55, we'd like a VERB 48; first register, 11102; second register, 01111.||CDR|Okay.||||||Tape 186/7||CC|A VERB 49 maneuver to lunar sounder thermal attitude at 285:00. The attitude is PITCH, 122 -say again, ROLL, 122; PITCH, 065; YAW, 047. That's 122, 065, and 047. HIGH GAIN angles with that will be PITCH, minus 24; YAW, 160.||CDR|Okay. At 285:00, a VERB 49 to ROLL of 122; PITCH, 065; YAW, 047; HIGH GAIN is minus 24 and 160.||CC|"Roger, Gene. And then at 285:10, where we had you write in the ""Antenna retract,"" we want you to delete that. The purpose of the maneuver above that is to heat up those antennas, and we will retract them on a cue from us when we feel the temperatures are warm enough."||CDR|"Okay. What about the ""RADAR, OFF"" at that point?"||CC|"Delete ""RADAR, OFF"" also."|11 14 55 35|CDR|Okay. I've deleted the whole update at 285:10 I had.||CC|That's affirmative.||CDR|Bob, Jack's ready to take the pad.||CC|Okay. They just pointed out there's also VERB 48 at 285:10, which is not applicable either. And, Jack, I've got the MIDPAC area - say again. Let's do the midcourse 7 pad first.

We're going to TRANSMIT on the TV now.||CC|Roger.||CDR|And let us know when you've got a picture.||CC|Will do.|11 17 27 19|CC|American, Houston. We've got a picture. Looks good, looks in focus, and we see the flag in the pat ch.||CDR|Okay.||LMP|Houston, here's the crew of Apollo - Apollo 17, Spaceship America.||||Tape 188/2||||CC|Roger, Apollo 17* If you're ready for the questioning, I'll begin.||LMP|Go ahead, Gordo.||CC|Okay. As usual in these inflight news conferences, the questions that will be asked of you were prepared by correspondents covering the Apollo 17 mission at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston. They will be read exactly as written and In the order determined by the newsmen. The first question is for Jack Schmitt. If you, as a geologist, were coming home from a field trip on Earth, you'd be drafting a preliminary report and discussing it with fellow geologists. In terms understandable to laymen, can you summarize what you would be saying in your preliminary report about your field trip to Taurus-Littrow?||LMP|Well, I'll - I'll give that a try, Gordy. I think the thing we had hoped to accomplish at Taurus-Littrow was to look at a - as broad a spectrum of the history of the Moon as possible in one small area, as the concluding flight to the Apollo Program. And I think we did that. I think we had look - did look at some of the oldest rocks that it is possible to see with our capability in the breccias of the South and North Massifs. I think we saw some intermediate-age rocks of fairly unexpected character, I believe, in the subfloor crystalline or igneous rocks, the gabbro, as we called them there. And we also understood, I think, that those rocks, in fact, had intruded into the breccias of the North Massif. We found, I believe, in the - at the Crater Van Serg, on the third EVA, that the regolith, or the garden zone, on the top of that subfloor gabbro, or the igneous rocks, was quite thick, or appears to be very thick, which Is an expected result, and will - hopefully, those rocks will have much information about a fairly extended period of lunar erosion. And, we found that there was indeed a dark mantle over the area||||||Tape 188/3|||of - variable thickness; but, apparently, of relatively recent age, and that in turn had a light mantle of material of which we do not yet understand, and I think that the samples are going to have to tell that story. It may well be a land slide that has come off the South Massif. And, then, possibly as important as any finding, we found that even later than that relatively young light mantle deposit are avalanche - possible avalanche - we have alteration reminiscent of the alteration by hot waters or hot gases on Earth, and that was the orange - appears to be the orange soil that we found around the Crater Shorty. And, subsequently, in orbit we started to pick up, and particularly through Ron Evans' efforts, pick up more of the apparent evidence of such alteration taking place in fairly recent time on the Moon. All of those items, I think, are extremely significant and go through the full range of our present knowledge of lunar history. And, a report I would write would initially summarize that particular sequence of events.||CC|Question number 2 is for Jack, again. What other probable explanations besides volcanic origin do you have for the orange rock and colored soil that you found at Shorty Crater?|11 17 33 02|LMP|Well, they don't necessarily have to be volcanic, Gordy. I refer to them as alteration, and much of the hydrothermal, or hot water, alteration we see on Earth is related to recent volcanism, or ancient volcanism; but, also, we know of that kind of alteration of preexisting materials to take place as a result of - of just fluids working their way up through the Earth's crust, and I presume that such a process is also possible on the Moon. The ones we saw seem to be associated with areas of dark mantle of various types, and most of the photographic evidence we have is that those dark mantle deposits are associated with volcanism, but it is not necessarily proved yet, I believe, that the - the orange soils or the alterations we've seen are volcanic. However, the||||Tape 188/4|||||process would be a related process, that is, one of internal origin.||CC|The third question is for Cernan or Schmitt. Your voices are so much alike that it is unclear to some of us which one of you found the orange rock and who first spotted the layer of orange soil on the crater rim.|11 17 34 22|CDR|Jack found it. He uncovered it as he was walking on the rim, and we worked with that, and then, as I went around the crater to take the stereo base pan from within the crater, I could see alterations radially down from the rim farther beyond where we were working down to the center.||LMP|I don't think that that question of who found it is as specifically as important as that that we were there with the equipment and the training jointly to not only recognize that but to take advantage of having recognized it, and I hope that we did.||CC|Okay. The next one's for Ron Evans. Why do you think you were able to see so much orange material from lunar orbit, after your partners had found some on the ground, where none of the previous Apollo crews reported seeing anything but grays, tans, and browns?|11 17 35 22|CMP|Well, I think, for one thing, that we were in, essentially, a different orbit than some of the other crews that had been up there before. And even though each of us has a color tone in our own eyes, what we come up with, I think, is a function pretty much of what you'd like to believe and what you'd like to see out of things. If you feel it has a tint of orange with it, and this is in a new area that we really haven't flown over that much, and this is primarily -where we were seeing this type of thing was on the western rim of Serenitatis, and some of the -well, at least it looks like known volcanic deposits along the rim of Serenitatis.||||||Tape 188/5||LMP|Gordy, let me add quickly that there's no such thing as a truly objective observer; and, I believe, that once you start looking for something, and when Ron heard about what we were doing, I'm sure he started looking, himself, to see what we had seen. That leads you to see things. Now that's not seeing things that are not there. It makes you look for things that are there, and that's extremely inportant; and that's where the kind of training all three of us have had and I think has made it possible for us to find a lot of things that might not otherwise have been found.||CC|Here's one addressed to all three crewmen. What will you remember most about this mission?||CDR|Boy, that's a loaded question, Gordy. There's so many things, but I think probably the thing that -when I think about it - that will stick with me most is the same thing that stuck with me - for my last two missions - not so much being there, but it's getting the chance to get home and share what you've seen and what you've done with other people.||CMP|I think in my case, the lift-off itself was something brand new for me. It's something beyond -The booster ride itself was something beyond what I could really comprehend. So, I think that's -oh, it's a very important part of it. I will always remember that part of it. But I'm kind of like with Gene; I feel that even though the three of us have been up here and had the opportunity to observe the Moon, look at what we could find and that type of thing, I think that we have an obligation to share our experiences with the rest of the people.|11 17 38 08|LMP|Well, Gordy, that is a difficult question. It has been a fascinating experience from so many detail aspects. I guess, generally speaking, the thing I carry back with me, I hope, is an increased perspective not only for the history of the solar system, but I hope for the future of mankind within that solar system.||||Tape 188/6||||CDR|Gordy, this doesn't mean that that last 50,000 feet won't stick in my mind for a long time.||CC|Roger, Gene. Again for all three crewmen. Now that you are returning home from what may be the last lunar exploration of this century, what short-range and long-range plans do each of you have for the future?||CDR|Well, my short-range plans are certainly to enjoy Christmas with my family, think about the flight, get its data down on paper. My long-range plans are to turn around and look at the next flight whenever that may be and put my efforts and experience toward that flight and get to work on it.||CMP|I think my short-range plans - of course, first of all tomorrow I want to make a real good reentry, and that's kind of the real short-range part of it. From that point on, as I mentioned before, I think we have a responsibility, at least, I feel we have responsibilities to share our experiences with the rest of the people not only in the United States, but with the people of the rest of the world. Beyond that, I also have a strong desire to continue participating in manned space flight in whatever capacity that I might be able to.||LMP|Well, I can do nothing but echo Gene and Ron's words and maybe add, Gordy, that I hope that through the next few years I'll be able to make some contributions that guarantee that this Apolly 17 flight is not the last exploration program in this century in space.||CC|Again, for all the crew. Throughout the mission there were periodic reports from each of you about gastric distress in one form or another. Does this trouble make you think that the three Skylab missions of 28, 56, and 56 days scheduled for next year are too ambitious?||CDR|No, not at all. I don't think they are too ambitious, Gordy. I think that's the reason we're flying each and every one of these flights one at a time. To find out if there really are potential problems in||||||Tape 188/7|||diet or what have you, and I think we solved a lot of them from Apollo 15 and l6, and those few that we had I'm sure we can solve, accordingly, prior to Skylab flying.||CMP|I don't think I can add anything to that.||LMP|I think we've made a big improvement over the problems that occurred on Apollo 16, and I think as a result of our observations in conjunction with the medical people, primarily at NASA, that solution -a very clear solution will be found for Skylab and any other mission we want to fly.||CC|Okay. For Ron Evans. You seemed almost euphoric during your space walk yesterday, and other space walkers before you seemed to have had this same reaction to the experience. Can you describe what it was like and how it made you feel?||CMP|"Well, I think for those of you who had the opportunity to watch yesterday, it is pretty obvious how I felt out there. I'm not sure euphoric is the word. I - it's an opportunity - Well, to me I guess it was an opportunity to be what I call a ""real space man."" And - you're out there in the deepness of space, with nothing there but your spacesuit on, and you're doing the job that has to be done. And we're riding around in space out here, and this is In a capsule and we look out the window, you know, but it's nice firm feeling. It's a solidly built vehicle, and you get the zero g effect on the thing, but you don't get the feeling of - really getting out and walking in space. And once I became accustomed to what it was like in the EVA environment, then you relax and you take it easy, you try to accomplish what you can and observe what you can and really enjoy it. And I think I really enjoyed it."||LMP|I had a hold of his umbilical most of that time and I didn't notice that he was ready to jump out into space If that's the kind of euphoria you're talking about.||||Tape 188/8||||CC|Okay. For Eugene Cernan and any other later comments. You talked a lot about this mission being the end of the beginning, but a lot of people don't agree. Recognizing the United States is stopping lunar exporation for the forseeable future, how do you feel?|11 17 43 48|CDR|When we look back at the Apollo Program I don't think anyone can privately to themselves and publicly say that this isn't truly indeed really a beginning - a beginning of man's really first venture out into deep space. And once there's a beginning, there's a continuation. The probing into deep space by man, the next landing on the Moon, a trip to Mars may not be for 10 years, a decade; it may not be until the end of this century. But I personally have faith that it will happen. I think it's a restraint, an abnormal restraint of man's intellect at this point in time to restrict or tend to think that he will restrict his own feeling of exploration, his own quest for knowledge. He's had an opportunity. He's proved that he could take advantage of this opportunity, and I think that the nature of mankind is going to just press on. That's why I believe not - we of Apollo 17 - yes, it's a beginning; but the whole Apollo Program is really the true beginning of what's to come in the future. And I firmly believe that. We can look back in a 100 years or 200 years and the 5-year or 10-year period of time, we may be slowed down here. I think we'll be - we'll be lost in the merit of what is really accomplished during the next several decades.||CC|The next question is for all the crew. The American people seem to be getting fairly blase about space flight and television coverage of Apollo 17 has been at a minimum. But this is not the case abroad. For example, in the Republic of Zaire, the former Belgian Congo, an estimated 20 million people are watching extensive coverage on TV sets set up in the villages. What do you have to say to the people of underdeveloped nations?||||||Tape 188/9||LMP|Well, Gordy, first of all, I'm not sure that the amount of television coverage is necessarily a measure of the interest of the American people. I don't have those figures at hand. I'm sorry to hear that the adventures we had and the insight that maybe we gained into not only ourselves, but to the history of the solar system was not shared extensively with the American people, if that's true. As far as the rest of the world is concerned, and also the people of the United States who may not participate as much in the affluence that we all would like to share, I think that's what space flight in general and the Apollo Program in particular has offered, is many new avenues from which we can provide for those people abroad and for our own people, the kind of quality of life and the material - including the material quality of life that everybody aspires to. I think, we've just begun the adventure of understanding how - what we've learned and how we've learned to do it in space can be applied to these particular kinds of problems. That is one of the great challenges that I think NASA and other agencies within the United States Government and other governments abroad have, is to use this base of technological information now for their own people.|11 17 47 26|CDR|I'd like to just add to that very briefly, Gordy, that America has led the way into space in the past. I believe we will in the future. But, a point I tried to get across several days earlier in this flight is that the real promise of the future for all the peoples of the Earth is to weld themselves into a coherent group of people who can live and work together and then enjoy all the benefits and all the knowledge that is to come from future space explorations. I think we are doing this not just as Americans but as human beings and everyone throughout these countries throughout the world who are watching us right now are also human beings no different than we are. It's their accomplishment as well as it is ours.||CC|Question 11 is for Jack. Do you think the United States waited too long to send a geologist to the Moon?||||Tape 188/10||||LMP|We're grinning because I think we predicted that question. Gordy, I think the United States waited too long to go into space in the first place, and I think they're probably going to wait too long to go back. I will always feel that way no matter who goes or what qualifications he may have or may think he has. I think that the most important thing that maybe I have done is to - to be able to show that we can build a transportation system that allows you to fly people of a wide variety of disciplines. And I think that we have shown that, and I think that it's occurred at about as soon as possible within the Apollo Program.||CC|The last couple of questions are in a lighter vein for Ron Evans. There has been a lot of discussion about missing a pair of scissors in the command module. Who really lost the scissors?||CMP|Well, I think it must have been one of those other guys because I was asleep and I got up the next morning and it was gone.||LMP|Didn't happen on my watch.||CC|And also, Ron, did you squeaking of those mice on board keep you awake?||CMP|No, the mice really didn't - there are plenty of other things going on inside the spacecraft here that we can hardly even hear the mice. As a matter of fact I really haven't heard them yex.||CC|Okay. This completes the list of questions submitted by the newsmen here in Houston. There are a little less than J minutes left on our scheduled time for any other further remarks you might like to make.||CDR|Yes, Gordy, I think we'd like to take this opportunity to each say a word or tvro.||LMP|Well, just briefly, Gordy, I feel that I have done something that's vex-y significant here in my life. I hope that - and will do everything I can to see that it is not the most significant thing I ever do. But, I feel that the fact that I had the||||||Tape 188/11|||opportunity to do in a large part to the tangible and intangible effects that my mother and father had on my life and to them I send my thanks and I hope that I continue to live up to their expectations||CMP|You know on Apollo 17, here, we've had two outstanding vehicles and that's the - don't let me get you wrong, I'm not discounting the booster either. But, I've watched a lot of people work on a lot of spacecraft, and I'm very proud to be able to say that all the vehicles that have been associated with Apollo 17 have been outstanding. And, the reason they are outstanding is because of the people that have been working on them. And, I'd like to give our thanks and the well-done to people who worked on our spacecraft.||CDR|Gordy, prior to leaving and I guess I can certainly assume during the flight we've carried many, many well wishes and carried many prayers aboard from people throughout the world. I personally believe that those prayers played no small part in any success that we were able to achieve on this flight. I ask those people, however, to continue their prayers in particular for some of our friends and some of our comrades who are still in southeast Asia - POWs, MIAs who may not - although God willing I hope they will - but who may not have the opportunities to get home and enjoy the Christmas that we're looking forward to. And with that from Apollo 17 spacecraft America on December 18, 1972, we all wish you a very, very Merry Christmas and a happy holiday season. Godspeed and God bless you all.|11 17 53 12|CC|Thank you, guys. That was a good show. We enjoyed every minute.||LMP|Okay, Gordy. I presume you want to go back to SCIENCE in the comm configuration, and we're getting squared away here for a big VERB 48.||CC|Okay. That's affirmative. Back to SCIENCE, please.|11 17 58 48|CDR|Gordy, if you like, I'll go ahead and maneuver now.||CC|No. We want to hold the manuver until 55-||||Tape 188/12||||CDR|Okay.|11 18 05 06|CC|America, Houston.||LMP|Go ahead.||CC|Okay. We're ready to go with that VERB 48 and then the VERB 49 as listed a little bit early here. That'll put us in the hot-soak attitude.||CDR|Okay, Gordo. Be with you in about 30 seconds.||CC|Okay.|11 18 07 21|CDR|Houston, America is on her way.||CC|Okeydoke.|11 18 12 47|LMP|Houston, 17's getting the high gain up, if you want it.||CC|Yes. We think we're already on it, Jack.||LMP|Well, I meant to have the other angles.||CC|I think you can just leave it alone. It is holding some - during the maneuver and should hold until the end of it.||LMP|Okay. The maneuver's over, Gordy.||CC|Roger.||LMP|Now we're even.||CDR|Hello, Houston, America.||CC|Go ahead.||CDR|Okay, Gordy. With these relatively fixed attitudes most of the afternoon, we got the - the tunnel totally dry, but the forward hatch is awful wet. I just thought I'd throw that out.||CC|Okay.||||||Tape 188/13|11 18 36 53|CDR|Houston, America. If you're ready, we'll maneuver.||CC|Stand by; we're checking. Not yet. Temperatures aren't up as high as they would like. We'd like to hold 5 minutes at least.||CDR|Okay; we'll just stand by for your call on the maneuver.|11 18 37 33|CC|Okay.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 189/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND TAPE TRANSCRIPTION|11 18 45 54|CC|America, Houston.||CDR|Go ahead, Houston.||CC|You guys aren't going to believe this, but Santa Claus just walked in the MOCR with a long white beard, red suit, black boots and all, and he's passing out presents to everybody.||LMP|How did he get there before we did? We just saw him up here about 5 - 5 days ago.||CC|Well, he beat you back.|11 18 46 24|CDR|Gordy, I'd - I'd believe anything. Has he got anything with our name on it?||CC|I'll ask him. I don't see anything yet.||CC|America, Houston. You can go ahead and start the VERB 49 maneuver. Have a change in the high gain angles, though, as printed there. Make it a plus 30 and 190, instead of minus 40 and 90. That's a plus 30 and 190 on the high gain.||CDR|Okay, I got them, Gordy.||LMP|Gordy, when you get a minute, would you ask one of the Surgeons there what my heart rate peaked out at in the last 15 minutes or so?||CC|"Okay, I'll do that. I'm just looking at some of the presents here. Mine was a little Skylab food can - flip-top can. It says, ""CAPCOM's Postflight Dinner."" And I'm pretty sure there's absolutely nothing in it, but I'm afraid to pull the lid off. The Surgeon's got a little plastic telephone that says ""For Private Conversations Only."""||LMP|(Laughter)||CC|And your heart rate went to - -||||Tape 189/2||||LMP|I'd be more worried about what might be - -||CC|Your heart - -||LMP|Ought to be more worried about what might be in that can, Gordy.||CC|(Chuckle) Yes, I am. Geno's heart rate peaked at 115 to 120.|11 18 48 52|LMP|Okay, what did the LMP's peak at? He wasn't doing anything.||CDR|I'm not even on biomed, as a matter of fact, Gordy.||CC|Oh, I'm sorry. My mistake. (Chuckle) Not the Surgeon's. That was the LMP1s.||CC|"Stovall, on the front row there, got a little shovellike gadget with a sign on it that says ""Trenching Tool."""||LMP|Beautiful. (Laughter)||CDR|I thought they might give him a coin. A flipable coin.||CC|"He's got a coin like that. It says ""CSM Active"" on both sides."|11 18 50 02|CDR|Yes, that's what I figured.|11 18 55 24|CC|America, Houston. We're ready for a spinup now.||LMP|Okay.||CDR|We're spinning, Gordy.|11 18 57 16|CC|Okay. It's looking good.|11 19 14 53|CC|America, Houston. We'd like to throw a few switches on panel 230 and try to get the HF antennas retracted. Over.||LMP|Okay. Go ahead.||||||Tape 189/3||CC|Okay. First of all, RADAR - OFF.|11 19 15 l4|LMP|Okay, Gordy, the RADAR is OFF.||CC|Okay; then HF ANTENNA number 2, RETRACT. And give us a mark, please. It should take about -a little over 2 minutes.||LMP|Okay, going to RETRACT -|11 19 15 30|LMP|MARK it. Oh, HF-2? Gordy, I started 1. I'm sorry.||CC|That's all right. Keep it. It doesn't matter; just keep working on 1 there. Keep it in RETRACT||LMP|Okay, it's in RETRACT - and stayed there.||CC|America, Houston. As you come up on roll of 30, we'd like you to - Okay, break, break - we would like the ANTENNA 1 switched to OFF now.|11 19 IT 54|LMP|It is OFF.||CC|And we got a good retract. Okay, for the guy on the - -||LMP|Gordy?||CC|Go ahead.||LMP|It was still barber pole when I went to OFF.||CC|Okay, that's the one we had trouble with before. That's what we expected. Okay, you can go number 2 to RETRACT now.||LMP|Okay, number 2 - RETRACT -|11 19 18 30|LMP|MARK.||CC|Okay, and for whoever is driving the spaceship there, we'd like to stop the roll - stop the PTC at a roll angle of 30 instead of what's in the||||Tape 189/4|||||Flight Plan. That's 30 degrees. And you're passing through 73 right now. Over.||CDR|Okay, Gordy. I got it. I'm looking at NOUN 20. We'll stop it at 30.||CC|Okay, and I have different high gains to go with that attitude. They'll be minus 24 and 206.||CDR|Okay. We got them.||CC|Jack, Houston. You should be retracted now and have a gray. And you can go OFF if you do.||LMP|That's affirm and congratulations.|11 19 21 05|LMP|And the switch is OFF.||CC|Okay, and those high gain angles I passed you are probably misleading. It looks like the high gain ought to just hang on when you stop this maneuver.||LMP|Okay.||CC|America, Houston. It'll be about 5 or 6 minutes until we finish the dump before we can go ahead with that VERB 49, in case you got something to do.|11 19 22 37|CDR|Okay , Gordy. Thank you.|11 19 29 51|CC|Okay, America. We're ready for the maneuver now.||CDR|Okay, Houston. Here she comes.||CDR|America is on her way again.||CC|Okay.||CDR|Gordo, I see two DAP changes here. You want to change this one during the maneuver or - after the maneuver - and then the next one before the next maneuver?||CC|We want the DAP load after you get to attitude and then the other DAP load before you start the next maneuver.||||||Tape 189/5||CDR|Sounds - that sounds good here. Okay.||CC|America, Houston. We need the UV cover closed. The Sun?s getting in there.|11 19 32 17|LMP|CLOSED, Gordy.||CC|Thank you.||CC|We should be safe now. Open the UV cover, please.|11 19 35 05|LMP|Gordy, it's OPEN.||CC|Thank you.||LMP|Doesn't it bother you to wield such power, Gordy?||CC|I'm getting accustomed to it.|11 19 38 24|LMP|Gordy, for the first time in seemingly several days, we see the Earth.||CC|Roger. Standing by for a weather report.||LMP|(Laughter) Afraid I don't know whether or not there's any weather down there.||CC|Guess you can't see too much of it, huh?||LMP|No, sir. You're down to a fingernail, if you'll pardon the expression. It - Oh, let's see - it's about a - what do you think, Gene? - about a one-eighth Earth - one-sixth to one-eighth Earth?|11 19 39 24|LMP|Got picture, Ron. (Chuckle) You can see it later. (Laughter)|11 19 46 37|CDR|Hello, Houston; America.||CC|Go ahead.||CDR|Okay, Gordo, 286:52 on the Flight Plan and 287:4-0 - Is there an update on that? CMP put his biomed harness on - oh, I guess 4 to 6 hours ago.||||Tape 189/6||||CC|Yes, let me check on that. I - There was something on this when I left last night, but I'll have to get the latest here.|11 19 47 14|CDR|Okay.|11 19 54 26|CC|America, we're ready now for the steps at 1 - 286:43 - CMC MODE - FREE and AUTO. VERB 48, VERB 49j and so forth. On the biomed, we're going to leave it up to you. Whoever - draw straws or whatever - whoever you decide to wear the biomed tonight, it's your choice.||CDR|That's easy. Jack and I will put it on in the morning. How's that?||CC|Okay.||CMP|You get to watch Captain America tonight then.||CC|Okay, Captain.|11 19 57 35|CC|America, Houston. We'd like OMNI Alfa.|11 19 59 43|CC|America, Houston.

We've been thinking about the - the busted Snoopy hat and have a suggestion on a - on a configuration that we'd like to present to you as an alternative to the plan you mentioned earlier. See what you think about it.||CDR|Hey, Gordo.||CC|Go ahead.||CDR|Can - can you hold off with that update? Ron's off the headset right now, and it'll be a few minutes. And I'd like to hear him - have him hear that.||CC|Okay. And just as a brief introduction before he gets on, we're really thinking about letting Jack have the broken one. Nothing personal, Jack, but think that it's probably more important that you and Ron have the - the all-up ones. Over.||CDR|Yes, we've already discussed that, but let - let Ron talk over with what his plan is, and let's hear yours.||CC|Okay, give me a call when you're ready.||CDR|Okay. And for food for thought, you might think about that. We looked at a way of just taping the electronic part of the lightweight headset right to - to his helmet. It looked pretty good. So chew on that one for a while, and we'll be back with you and you can come up with your plan.||CC|Yes, that sounds like that's - that's our plan, essentially, but I'll go through it in case there's anything that either you or us haven't thought of about it.||CDR|Okay.||CC|America, Houston.||||Tape 190/2||||LMP|Go ahead.|11 20 22 08|CC|We'd like to give you what EECOM has said should be the final fan configuration for this mission. H2 FAN 2, OFF, and 3, AUTO.|11 20 22 26|LMP|Okay, FAN 2 is going OFF and 3 to AUTO. And this is truly a historic event.||CC|It's been a pleasure to share it with you, Jack.||CDR|Isn't that the way we started? Isn't that the way we started?||CC|I think it is. Affirm.||LMP|Very appropriate, ffy congratulations and ny hat off to the EECOM.||CC|Thank you, sir.|11 20 23 55|CC|America, Houston. We'd like you to spin it up on B-2 and D-2, and we have one change in the HIGH GAIN REACQ and NARROW angles. Instead of a YAW of 90, we want a YAW of 45.|11 20 24 19|CDR|Okay, I'll set them at a YAW of 45-||CC|Roger.||CC|You probably weren't aware of it, but your IR is chilly. Would you turn it on up until bedtime to warm it up a little, please?|11 20 25 21|CDR|Okay, that's only - that's only appropriate. IR is ON.||CC|Roger.|11 20 25 45|CMP|Okay, Gordy. I just spun up America for you.||CC|Thank you.|11 21 04 03|CMP|Houston, America. The - the CMP is in biomed.||CC|Okay, CMP.||||||Tape 190/3||CMP|Very good.||CC|This probably isn't too good a time to have an emergency.||CMP|(Laughter)||CC|The reason I say that is we got a big Chinese feast|||going on here in the MOCR.||CMP|(Laughter) Oh, you do?||CC|Had some food brought in, and everybody's probably more interested in eating than the America right now, I must admit.||CMP|(Laughter) Uh-oh.||CMP|Houston, America. How's the delivery girl situation? Is it as good as it used to be?||CC|Oh, yes. Better, if anything.||CMP|Outstanding.|11 21 06 21|CC|Ron, I have some words on our suggestion, probably the same as what you've done already on rigging up the headsets for - for entry tomorrow any time you have a free moment to listen.||CMP|Oh, sure. Go ahead. I'm just sitting here right now.||CC|Okay. Geno mentioned that you'd already essentially taped the electronic part to your Snoopy hat. I guess, first of all, we're suggesting that you rig -rig this up for Jack, and let you have the good one just to be sure. And I'll - I'll quickly run through the steps we have. I think maybe this will be the easiest way. And you can then listen and if you've done it already or if you - if this mentions something that you haven't thought of, it'll at least accomplish the job. They have about 15 steps here, but I don't think it'll take long to summarize it. They suggest taking the headband off the lightweight headset; in other words, taking the electronic part off the headband, straighten the mike boom, and straighten the - the comm carrier||||Tape 190/4|||||boom, the appropriate one for whichever ear Jack wears his molded earpiece in, then rotate the lightweight headset mike boom 90 degrees. They found that was necessary to get it to face your mouth when - when you end up with this all taped on there. You have to sort of twist it, force it 90 degrees. Then lay the lightweight headset boom along the comm carrier boom with the electronic part on the outside of your - your earpiece on the Snoopy hat. And the - the hose that goes to the molded earpiece facing downward coming out down and with the - the mike boom 1 inch beyond the comm carrier mike boom tip. And then tape the two booms together for the entire length of the comm carrier boom. And then rebend the whole works back so that the tip is back in front of your mouth. And then tape the electronics box onto the side of the earpiece, and you can run tape all the way around the lower part of the earpiece, and you can lift up on the leather-covered doughnuts on the inside there, pull that loose and then rim tape underneath. Just pull the lower part of it loose, run tape all the way around to really securely anchor the electronics box to the outside of the - the earpiece so there's no chance that that will slip off or shift. Then you can kind of push the leather earseal back down on top of the tape inside. Let's see. Then - -||CMP|Yes. So far - so far, we're right with you.|11 21 09 45|CC|Okay. Then take the comm carrier electrical lead, and double it back on itself, and - and tape it together so that it doesn't flop around. And now you've got it essentially set up. I - I've lost iry place here in the sequence. Just a second. Okay. Place the molded earpiece - Well, actually, one further modification was then to run the - the hose, which is now external, up underneath the leather doughnut and out through the ear opening, and - and pull it on through. Now you - to put this all on, you'll have to stick the molded earpiece in your ear and then as you pull the Snoopy on, sort of pull the slack out of the - the audio hose there so you don't end up with a lot of hose coiled up in the earcup. And the - the remaining hose then just sort of dangles down beside your neck. Fasten the chinstrap, and make sure that the hose isn't pinched or - anywhere. Readjust the||||||Tape 190/5|||mike boom to a half inch from your - in front of your lips, and make sure one of the foam parts of the mike boom is facing your mouth. Okay. Then you just route the - the electrical lead and the -the plug on down through the slot and the ICG, and put - put all the excess length of the connectors and the - the excess stuff down inside the ECG [sic] so it doesn't flop around, and of course mate the pins, the connectors, and snap the ICG closed at the front to be sure that it'11 capture. One thing they did tiy in this configuration is - was - was to see if you could get the helmet on over all that, in case a suited reentry became necessary at short notice, and it does go on. Randy Hester tried it. And with just a little cocking of the head, you can get the helmet on over. How's that sound to you?|11 21 12 24|CMP|Hey, Gordy. That sounds essentially what we were thinking about. We hadn't got to the extent of trying to hook them up yet, you know, put them together yet, but we're thinking along the same lines anyhow. And you brought up a couple of points that are good.||CC|Okay. If you got any questions or anything, I've got a demo model sitting right in front of me here, so that we can just discuss it real time as you get it set up. I assume you're going to try to work that up tonight. Is that right?||CMP|Yes, we can, I guess. Okay, and the - the reason you'd rather have Jack do it than me is simply -simply because of the redun - redund - I can't say the word. (Laughter) Redundancy.||CC|That's affirmative. It gives you and Gene the -the prime - best equipment, and we see no - no reason why this won't work, but like you say, it's only one mike in place of two on the other ones.||LMP|I'm surprised you didn't have us tape two headsets to the Snoopy helmet.||CC|Well, Jack, we'll just take that chance.||LMP|Well, it took l4 days, but I finally know where I stand.||||Tape 190/6||||CC|I do have a question. Well, first of all I give you a little weather for the South Pacific tomorrow, if you're interested.||LMP|Stand by and let's get the commander on the headset here in a minute. Then you can pass it up.||CC|Okay.||CC|Not bad.||CMP|Well, I'll let her go this time.||CC|Okay, we got them.|11 21 19 39|CMP|Okay, we'll torque at 59:45.||CC|All righty.|11 21 20 11|CC|America, we would like to stop the roll this time around as you come up on 146 roll.|11 21 20 28|CMP|Okay, we'll stop it on l46 roll.|11 21 25 49|CC|America, Houston. When you get her stopped there, we'd like you to hold the attitude until we get the DSE dump before doing the VERB 49,|11 21 26 00|CMP|Okay, Gordo. We're there now.|11 21 28 20|CDR|Hey, Houston; America. We can take those words on the weather in the recovery area, if you like.||CC|"Okay. It can be summed up by one word, ""Excellent."" 2000, scattered, and high-scattered are forecast. I'm looking at a satellite picture - high-resolution satellite picture that shows you in the middle of a big high, and she's just - very faint hint of clouds in the area. And the trend of the weather movement is such that you're going into a - an even clearer area by tomorrow. The wind will be 090 at 10; visibility, 10; 2994 on the altimeter. It's of no consequence to the Navy guys, but the landlubber will be glad to learn that there is 3-foot wave heights, and the temperature is 77 degrees. Over."||CDR|Sounds like a fighter pilot's day to come aboard. I think they'll be able to take those seas.||||||Tape 190/7|11 21 29 37|CC|(Laughter) Roger. Okay, you can start the VERB 49 if you wish.|11 21 30 42|CC|America, Houston. One other request you might be thinking about that you'd - and that is any delta to the nominal entry stowage that we might not know about we'd like to know about before you go to sleep tonight so we can think about the e.g.||CMP|Okay, Gordo. We'll be able to give you those.||CC|America, Houston.

But we do have a minute. Is there by any chance any late news? Anything going on today that might be of interest?||CC|Okay. I haven't heard of anything. You did get a news report this morning? Is that correct?||CDR|Yes. We sure did.||CC|Okay. I'll see if there's any deltas to that. It'll take me a couple of minutes.||LMP|Okay. How's the Houston weather today?||CC|It was overcast but warmer. Kind of standard winter weather for around here. Not nearly so frigid as it has been the last couple days.|11 22 39 26|LMP|Okeydoke.|11 22 54 07|CDR|Hello, Houston; America.||CC|Go ahead, Gene.||CDR|Okay, Gordo; the entry stowage will be as - as in the Flight Plan Supplement, with the exception that there is a - a small LM jettison bag, max weight of about 25 pounds, which will be - which is already, as a matter of fact, packed in A-7.||CC|Okay. We got that.||CDR|And the presently used jettison bag weight really isn't very much at all, that's just for housekeeping trash and so forth. We will tie between A-2 and A-3, and there's probably not, at the most, more than 5 pounds there.||CC|Okay.||||Tape 192/2||||CDR|And right now we haven't seen any specific spot to tie down the LEVAs. If you've got a recommendation, we'll take it. If not, we'll just pick a spot down in the LEB area to tie them down.|11 22 55 29|CC|Okay. I'll see if we have a plan for that.|11 23 16 02|CC|America, Houston. I've got an update to the news.||CDR|Okay, Houston. America's listening.||CC|Okay. It's some more like human interest stuff rather than pure news. One thing the - in the Liberty Bowl football game Georgia Tech beat Iowa State. Well, I guess it's not quite over yet - this is a fourth quarter score, Georgia Tech 315 Iowa State 24. And, there is a story about the Moonship that's streaking smoothly homeward. There's nothing in it that you don't know about, though, except maybe one little part of the article describing a quote from William E. Fastie of Johns Hopkins University, member of the Orbital Science Team, who said that a rather startling discovery is the Moon is simply not degassing. It has nothing left in terms of anything that you think - that can create an atmosphere. Much to his surprise, even the amount of hydrogen, an element that should have been the most abundant outgassing candidate, turned out to be about 1 percent of its predicted value. He speculated that the absence of a planetary magnetic field on the Moon works to the purge surface of any atmospheric accumulation. The atoms of gases that have vented to the surface, he theorized, pick up an electrical charge then - and are then swept away by the solar wind, which is a stream of electrified atoms pushing far out into the solar system of the Sun. Former President Truman is stabilized is the word they are using now. His heart condition is unchanged. His kidneys are failing him, and he's termed to be still in a very serious condition but resting comfortably. A declining birth rate and a desire for fewer children in the years ahead have caused the census bureau to reduce sharply its estimates of future population growth in the United States. By the year 2000, for example, the estimate is now 20 million fewer people than had been forecast on the basis||||||Tape 192/3|||"of previous statistics. Reduction could have major implications for American society in many areas. And it reflects changes in birth and child planning, which now suggest that the U.S. may eventually reach zero population growth. The last one is pretty interesting, and more so if you can see the picture that goes with the story, about James L. G. Fitzpatrick who for 40 years has been interested in copying natural flight. And he has now designed a batlike flying machine that may be ready for a test run next summer. Fitzpatrick said that the first - that first, every small part of the ungainly structure must be tested carefully. Otherwise you end up either in a disaster or a grave, and we try to avoid that sort of thing. After three decades of trying, Fitzpatrick, who's 66, believes his latest device comes closest to the real thing, although it still needs a small motor to flap the wings. Asked whether his device, as yet unnamed, works on the flight principle of a bird, he said, ""I don't know anyone who knows what principle a bird works on, but I guess this is more like a bat of a pterodactyl.” Fitzpatrick's ornithopter or flapping wing airplane is equipped with cockpit controls that include a throttle that regulates the 1-horsepower engine and up-and-down flight. Other equipment includes rudder pedals to regulate a power steering system, a parking brake, a pseudopaddagieum, I don't know what that one - that word is, it's a new one on me, to transfer power from the engine to the wings, and a two-way radio. It has a maximum 40-foot wingspan and weighs 320 pounds. It is 6 feet long and it looks like a cage of scaffolding covered in parts by canvas. He said he's far enough along on building his device that he will be able to test the way the wings move in the Staten Island Community College gym by the first of the year. However, there will be no free flying. The gymnasium test will involve tying weights to the wing tips and flapping the wings. He said that his bird is rather slow in maturing; and it's been a long gestation period which involved 9000 hours of experimentation, $40,000 in his money, and the dissection of 300 birds of various species. ""I've been interested in flight since 1930,"" he said. ""Basically, I was curious as to why various things flew, and I've been painfully finding out ever"||||Tape 192/4|||||"since."" And he winds up with a real quote here. He said, ""Never has so much been done with so little success."" That's the news. No, wait -wait a minute. One final closing story. In Atlanta, Georgia, a 5-year-old boy crawled up on Santa's lap in a department store and asked him what Santa would need if he had two boots and one sock. Dick Wright, a Georgia State University graduate student in the off season, said he thought quickly and replied, ""Another sock,"" and the child punched him in the stomach."||LMP|Huh! Merry Christmas.||CDR|Thank you for the news , Gordo.|11 22 22 30|CDR|That's a very enjoyable evening to go to bed with on our final night of the flight.||CC|Before you turn in, we got a little shopping list to run down with you If you're - nothing to write down, but if you're ready to listen.||CDR|Okay, go ahead.||CC|Okay. The Surgeons are, first of all, request that Ron press on his sensors. They're looking like they're getting loose according to the data here. They also reco - recommend for Ron that if he's still using the nose drops - I guess he has been - they recommend that he take one decongestant pill before going to sleep and one after breakfast in the morning. It's a suggestion. It's his option. The thought being it might help in clearing your ears during that final descent. You may leave the optics power on for more heat in the cabin if you wish. We'd like you to stop charge in battery B. Over.|11 23 23 54|CDR|Okay. He's taking that off the line now; off the charge.||CC|Okay. And we'd like the IR, OFF.|11 23 24 05|CDR|Okay. It's OFF, Gordy.||||||Tape 192/5||CC|Okay. Let's see, we owe you an answer on what to do with the LEVAs. I guess they were supposed to be on the helmets in the PGA bag. Is that going to be a real pain to get at, and put them there?||CDR|No, it's not going to be a pain at all, Gordo; it's just impossible.||CC|Okay, well -||CDR|There's just no room in there at all - not - none at all.||CC|Okay. I'll - probably not have an answer for you tonight, but first thing in the morning - someplace to put them.||CDR|Okay. It won't be any problem strapping them somewhere, but we thought maybe you had a better idea than we did; if not, when we get our rock bags tied down and all in place, -we'll take a look at a good spot for the LEVAs and let you know.||CC|Okay. G&C - I don't know where you are on the checklist - the - just a reminder to zero the optics before you turn in. And I'd like to -say for the whole White Team, who are just - here in another hour, will finish up their - their work with the Apollo Program, and myself included, that this sure has been a pleasure working with not only the two best spacecraft the program has seen but we think the best and most cooperative and -crew also. And it's been a privilege in my esti-matio and a real pleasure, too, and looking forward to seeing you on Thursday.||CDR|Well, Gordo, those are awful kind words, and we do appreciate it very much, but I think you know how we feel about the help you guys give us down there. And - well, it really makes our job easy up here. From the Cape back to the Pacific is -it's the guys from the trench all the way up to the top back there, and that's what it's really all about. We thank you, those are good words, but just consider them reciprocal also.||CC|Thank you.||||Tape 192/6||||CMP|We appreciate it there, White Team.||CC|Thank you, Ron.||CDR|Gordo, we'll hang on the air here and we're going to finish up our presleep checklist and we'll just give you one final buzz before we go off on the voice switch.||CC|Okay; very good.||CDR|By the way, the Earth is sure starting to get big.||CC|Okay. You're about 80,000 miles out.||CDR|Okay, outstanding. I guess, based upon your midcourse 7> that that's a good sign, isn't it? That it's getting big?||CC|That's what it's supposed to do.|11 23 27 45|CDR|It's a - although there's not much of it to see, it's really sort of spectacular because the crescent is getting smaller and smaller although the Moon is getting - is getting larger, and of course the crescent we're looking at now is the Pacific. But even if there were landmasses in there, I don't think we could see much besides the reflection off the clouds - and a - well, in this case, the ocean. But - it's really a pretty spectacular sight because out the other window, now that we're on an intervertical [?] PTC, we've got a full Moon looking back at us. And it's sort of a poetic place to be the night before entry.||CC|Yes, I'll bet it is.||CDR|Hang in there, babe, and we'll see you for sure Thursday.||CC|Okay; it's a deal.|11 23 45 53|CMP|Houston, how's the CMPs biomed now?||CC|Okay, Ron, looks real good.||||||Tape 192/7||CMP|Okay; mighty fine.||CC|I got a final on the Liberty Bowl. Must have been exciting. John Young should be happy. Georgia Tech squeaked through, 31 to 30.||CDR|Looks like there's some pretty good football games coming up this weekend, too.||CC|That's right, in the pros.|11 23 48 20|CDR|Houston, America.||CC|Go ahead.||CDR|Gordy, we'd like to go back to AUTO on the GLYCOL EVAP TEMP IN, you concur?||CC|That's fine with the EECOM.

Number 1, the old weather report: 2000 scattered - high scattered - 10 miles visibility, 3-foot seas, winds are out of the east at 10 knots. Just about exactly what you had yesterday, and probably what we've been telling you for 2 or 3 days. Looks like we're going to have a midcourse 7 this morning, about 2 feet per second. Pretty much just to really center us in the corridor. We're already within the corridor now, with no problems. We're going to exit PTC at a different roll angle. We'll read||||Tape 197/2|||||that up to you later when you get the Flight Plan out; but just so you don't go ahead and exit early, we will be sending you something up on that exit PTC to new roll angle. And as far as the LEVAs are concerned, you guys were looking for a place to stow those last night, and what we're suggesting is putting them in the sleep restraint on top of A-8 where you've got one suit stowed, apparently. And we're suggesting you put one of those on the helmet on that PGA. And the other one, as it were, loose and in the bag. Over.|12 07 33 47|CMP|Houston, America. We've got the PGAs in the bag. (Laughter) Hope that's right.||CC|You got all three of them in the L-shaped bags, or have you got - The understanding down here, apparently, in talking last night was that one was in a sleep restraint on top of A-8 - in the sleep restraint bag.||CMP|Well, we've got CMP and LMP suits in the bottom -I mean, the commander and LMP suits at the bottom part of it. CMP suit's in the top of it - of the L-shaped bag.||CC|Okay, we'll work on that. And we've got something else for you here - just a minute.||CC|(Music: Anchors Aweigh)||CDR|Thank you, Robert. Most appreciative.||CC|Okay, we aim to please. That's also, I might tell you guys, the third time we've played that this morning, although you's only heard it twice. We played it once before we sent the crew alert.|12 07 37 11|CMP|CMP has no comment.||CC|Okay, America, we'd like to request MEDIUM on the HIGH GAIN antenna, please.||CMP|Okay, you have REACQ and MEDIUM.||||||Tape 197/3||CC|Okay. And I guess now on the LEVAs, what we're suggesting is you put them - put the two of them in by themselves in a sleep restraint and tie it down on top of A-8. And I've got a lot of fancy words about how to tie it down on top of A-8, if you guys can't figure out how to do it. I can read it off to you, or we can leave it to your intuitive good sense.||CMP|Well, so far, we've kept pretty much with most of your recommendations around here.

Those sounded good.|12 08 39 10|CMP|Okay.|12 08 46 57|CMP|Got that now.|12 08 48 08|CMP|Houston, America, with the food and medical report.||CC|Stand by on that, Ron. We've got an antenna switch coming up. As soon as we get you back on comm, -we'll go ahead with it.||CMP|Okay.|12 08 48 3J|CC|Okay, Ron. The switch has been made. You're ready - we're ready for the copy.||CMP|Map.||CC|Oh.||||Tape 198/2||||CMP|Okay, Houston. Do you want to copy? Okay, Houston. On the commander's menu, we use negative reporting. Okay, did not eat potato soup, chicken stew, and peach ambrosia. I'm sorry, I started with meal C instead of A. And then to add on meal Charlie, three-fourths jelly candy. Okay, we'll start with A again, on the commander. Did not eat peaches and cocoa. Meal Bravo, did not eat chicken and rice soup and fruitcake. Add one-fourth jelly candy. Okay, for breakfast on day l4. Did not eat mixed fruit. Did not eat cinnamon toast and bread. Did not eat coffee. And add one can of peaches. Okay, commander's medical log: PRD, 17065; 5 hours, fair; none; and five cans of water. Okay, for the LMP, start with meal A, day 13. Did not eat bacon squares, apricots, cocoa. Meal Bravo, did not eat chicken and rice soup. And add - add on graham cracker cubes and a plain coffee. Meal 13, did not eat chicken stew, peach ambrosia, grapefruit drink, and add on a plain coffee and sugar cookies. Day -day 14, meal A, did not eat a half a sausage and a mixed fruit and scratch the potassium in the coffee - A plain coffee. Okay, LMPs PRD, 24227; 6 hours of good; none; and three cans of water. Okay, CMP, meal A, Day 13: did not eat four bacon squares, apricots, and add on a car - a carmel candy. Meal Bravo, did not eat one-fourth of the fruitcake. Add on two tea, three-fourths jelly candy and graham cracker cubes. Meal Charlie, did not eat chicken stew. Add on one-fourth jelly candy. For breakfast, did not eat mixed fruit. Scratch the with K in the coffee. Drank the coffee, but it was black. Add on peaches. Okay, CMPs medical: PRD, 15062; 7 hours of good. The rest of the guys said it was noisy, but I thought it was good. Let's see - medication: one decongestant, one Seconal; and three cans of water. And that completes the medical/food readback.||CC|Roger, Ron. Just a word on your consumable status this morning. You're in good shape on RCS, oxygen, and hydrogen. You're in real good shape.||CMP|Okay, Houston, America. When you get that roll angle, let us know, will you?||||||Tape 198/3||CC|Yes, the roll angle is 306, exit G&N PTC at roll angle 306. And we'll call you when we get there -when you get there.||CMP|Okay, we're watching it, Bob, 306.||CC|And, America, Houston. The high gain angles to go with that roll angle of 306. HIGH GAIN angles are PITCH, 34; YAW, 26?. Over.||CMP|Roger. 34 and 267.|12 08 57 29|CC|And, America, Houston. I've got a couple of other items on this Flight Plan updates, if you're ready to copy now.||CDR|Go ahead, Bob.||CC|"Okay, at 301:50, 301:50, add ""UV COVER, CLOSED."""||CDR|Okay, got it.||CC|"Okay, and then on the other page there. At 302:06, delete the line, ""UV COVER, CLOSE."""||CDR|Okay.||CC|The next change here is to the Entry Checklist and to the entry cue card.||CDR|Okay, go ahead.||CC|On the Entry Checklist, page 1-3 between steps 23 and 24, it's actually part of step 23. S-BAND OMNI antenna Charlie, change that to Delta - on the S-BAND OMNI antenna, Delta.||CDR|Okay, we've got Delta at horizon check attitude.||CC|"Roger. And if you'll go over to 2-4, Entry Checklist, where it says, ""Yaw back to zero degrees"" after SEP, ve would like you to insert, ""Select OMNI Charlie"" - OMNI Charlie, at that time. And that will be also required on your entry cue card at 45 minutes where it says , ""Yaw to zero,"" you'll have to be OMNI Charlie, select OMNI Charlie."||||Tape 198/4||||CDR|Okay, we've got it covered everywhere.||CC|Okay, and the reason for that is for better coverage going through Hawaii and that and then OMNI Charlie is coming back up on the ARIA.|12 09 00 01|CDR|Okay, Bob.||CC|And, America, Houston. Just one word to the CMP, if you have a chance. One of your EKG sensors seems to be loose, if you can tighten it up a little bit.|12 09 00 28|CMP|Okay, I'll start pressing on it.|12 09 06 36|CC|America, Houston. You're getting pretty close to your 306 roll.||CDR|I'm watching here, Bob. NOUN 20.||CC|Okay. Real fine.||CC|We'd like AUTO on the HIGH GAIN.||CC|America, Houston.

Due to the - stopping your roll angle differently, you're under the El REFSMMAT attitude, your roll will be about 046, and you'll see a max yaw of about 64 degrees during this gyro torquing.||CMP|(Laughter) Okay, thanks for calling.||CMP|It sounded like yesterday you might have had a cold, and it sounds like it might be a little worse today.||CC|No, no. Feeling great.||CMP|Okay, mighty fine.||CC|"That's my ''get serious and get you home"" voice, see?"||CMP|(Laughter) Okay, perfect.|12 09 28 38|CMP|Okay, Houston.

We didn't need them.||CMP|Okay, I didn't think so-||CC|And just for your information, I might pass along the drift checks on the platform have been extremely good, and the platform is in real good condition. I'm sure you're - -||||Tape 199/2||||CMP|Hey, mighty fine. What kind of values - average values have you been coining up with? I remember some in lunar orbit, but I don't know if - they haven't come back since then.||CC|You're down like 0.005 degrees per hour, down in the thousandths of degrees per hour.||CMP|(Laughter) That's - that's not bad at all, is it?||CC|No, that's - you could take it right back to the Moon if you wanted to, by golly.||CMP|Yes, sure could.|12 09 30 57|CDR|Okay, Bob.

And we - star 31.|12 09 56 17|CMP|And, Houston, we've got a minus 29-2 on the DELTA-V test function of the EMS.||CC|Roger. We copy that, Ron.|12 09 56 37|CMP|And star - star sextant check is good there, Houston.||CC|Roger.|12 09 56 51|CMP|Okay.

You're really smoking along, aren't you?||CMP|(Laughter) Well, I wouldn't think it would sense that, but - -||CC|Roger.||CMP|Anyhow, we'll use burn time and - NOUN 85 for the -the burn.||CC|Roger.||CC|Ron, you're happy with your EMS and null bias check, aren't you?|12 10 00 4l|CMP|Negative. Not on the null bias check, no. I'll give you a count in a minute. I'm going to redo the EMS DELTA-V test, and then go back and try another null bias check. But it looked like it was counting from about 100 to - to 75 in 30 seconds, but let me check that out.|12 10 01 21|CMP|Okay. Did the DELTA-V test, and that time we got a minus 20.3.|12 10 02 13|CMP|Okay, Houston. They started at minus 100 on the null bias check; 30 seconds at 118.8.|12 10 02 54|CMP|One minute, 137-8.||CC|Ron, would you verify those are negative numbers?||CMP|That's affirmative. They're negative.|12 10 03 35|CMP|Okay, a minute and 40 seconds, minus 162.7 or so.|12 10 04 31|CMP|Okay, Houston. We've got a little bit of time here. And looks like I've still got three EMS tests left. I'd like to go ahead and do another EMS test on that, and we'll see if that integrator is all fouled up completely - on the range integrator.||||Tape 199/6||||CC|Okay, Ron. We agree.||CMP|Okay.|12 10 05 49|CMP|Okay, TEST 1 looks all right.|12 10 06 08|CMP|And TEST 2 is okay; .05 G light is ON. Okay, going to TEST 3; 10 seconds -|12 10 06 28|CMP|MARK it.

G line comes across at 9 z - g's (laughter), and range indicator indicates 0.0. Outstanding.|12 10 08 18|CMP|And test 5 works all right.|12 10 12 43|CMP|Okay.|12 10 13 13|CMP|Well, looks like a P4l here. What've you got now?||CDR|... 9, 130, and 359* Oh, about 25 minutes from the burn, 25.||CMP|Think you can get those things done by that time?||CMP|Okay, just so I won't forget it, let's go ahead and trim it.|12 10 13 52|CMP|Okay, we are trimmed. About 1 minute. ... 24 minutes to the burn.||CMP|Both ...|12 10 16 22|CMP|Houston, America. Does it look like we're going to hack it on the waste water tank there - ... out there?||CC|Ron, yes. We're not going to dump the waste water tank at this time, and we won't dump it after midcourse 7 of course.||CMP|(Laughter) Okay. Just wanted to make sure.|12 10 17 14|CMP|Yes. BAT C, up around 36.5- Pyros, 36.9, 36.9.||||||Tape 199/7|12 10 17 33|CMP|... Okay.

Go ahead.|12 10 19 37|CC|Oh, Ron, we've been kicking around this EMS test and the null bias test and that, and we concur on this burn using NOUN 85s and your burn time as your cues and not using EMS. We would like, however, for you to bias the EMS. Set in a plus 118.8 at - and it will go to NORMAL at T. minus 30 seconds ig and we'd just be interested in what the EMS does ?under a very small g field like this.|12 10 20 11|CMP|Okay. We'll set in at plus 118.8 and turn it to NORMAL at T. minus 30 seconds. And I'll try to ig look at it at the end of burn time or go to STANDBY at that point in time so we can make a good hack on it.||CC|Roger. That'd be great, Ron, and we see no problem for entry with EMS.||CMP|Roger. Mighty fine.||CMP|We've really got the Christmas spirit out the window here. Looks like it's really snowing.||CC|(Laughter) Roger. Glad it's not snowing on us with that stuff.||CMP|(Laughter) Oh, it's frozen.|12 10 22 59|CMP|Okay, Gene. Let me read through the P4l here just to make sure we got everything. Okay, we're in SIM basic configuration, I guess. Yes, the IR's ON, and it won't hurt anything. UV's ON, but at this point in time, it won't make any difference, I guess. CMC is ON, ISS is ON, SCS is operating. We tested the caution and warning, the DELTA-V test works, null bias ... And DELTA-V^, we'll set that up.||||Tape 199/8|||12 10 23 58|CMP|Okay. We got 118.8 and DELTA-V in STANDBY. BMAGs are caged and RATE 2.|12 10 24 13|CMP|Okay. AUTO RCS SELECTS. We'll put those on for trim. We’re just going to trim the X-axis only? Okay, I'll leave the A/C OFF. Okay. I got the DAP. VERB 04 NOUN 46 ENTER. CSM. Don’t use A/C. Use B/D for plus-X. ? ...

And we'll trim X only to 0.2 foot per second.||CMP|Houston, America. Does this kind of change our entry angle, what, about 0.2 - 0.2 degree?|12 10 28 36|CC|0.2 of a degree, Ron.||CMP|Oh, okay.||CMP|Which way? Does it steepen it or shallow it up?||CC|It'll make you a little more shallow. Very little shallow - -||CMP|Oh, okay. Okay.||CC|Ron, it's going to run you from 6.7 entry angle to a 6.49.||||||Tape 199/9||CMP|Oh, okay. Yes, that's what I thought, okay.|12 10 29 50|CDR|Eight minutes to go. ...||CMP|Next time we do this, we'll have to allow a little more time for the - the BUSS/dumping, I think, prior to the burns.|12 10 31 10|CC|America, Houston.

It looked good.|12 10 39 02|CDR|And the VERB 66 is in.||CC|Roger.||CMP|Ah-ha, I get to get out of my g suit.||CMP|You know, while I think about it, Houston, I've noticed it throughout the - the flight here. In the simulator, CMC control will allow your rates -you know - to bounce back and forth maybe up to, oh, sometimes 0.1, more than likely 0.05 degree per second as it trims within the dead band. In four-jet translations, as well as in two-jet translations, your rates get up to about almost 0.4 degree per second as it's damping within its own dead band there.||CC|Roger, Ron.|12 10 40 37|CC|America, Houston. Just to make doubly certain that we don't get any venting from the waste tank, we would like on panel 352 the WASTE WATER RELIEF valve to OFF, please.||CMP|Okay, we'll get that. BATTERY net presumably will stay OPEN, though, is that correct?||CC|Stand by on that, Ron. That's affirmative, Ron.||||||Tape 199/11||CMP|Okay, we'll leave the BATTERIES in OPEN.|12 10 41 45|CMP|Okay, Houston. The dump PRESSURE RELIEF valve is in OFF.||CC|Roger.|12 10 42 50|CC|And, America; Houston.

It was 79-0 at a minute and 40 seconds.||CC|Okay, Ron. We got that.||CMP|Do you want to try the minus 100 part of it? Really think it's worth it?||CC|Well, Ron, we'd like it if you could dat - data gathering point, that's all - -||CMP|Okay. Let's do - -||CC|You know what's due on entry.||CMP|The other guys are crawling around down under the couches. They're trying to get that stuff locked in there anyhow. I think I must have shrank, my shoes went on easier now than they did on the fitting.- I must have shrunk, I guess, is the correct terminology. Shrank? Shrink?||CC|Whatever you like.||CMP|(Laughter)|12 11 12 06|CMP|Okay, minus 105-8 at 30 seconds.|12 11 12 37|CMP|Minus 115.7 - I mean 111 - 111.7 at 1 minute.|12 11 13 16|CMP|And it's minus 119-1 or 2 - about 2 - about 119-2 about a minute and 40.||CC|Okay, Ron. That’s very consistent data both ways on that - after the burn.

You know, I never noticed it before, but I'm looking next to the - to the Earth, right now. And, of course, that makes it a kind of bluish reflection inside the - the sextant, and you can't see the reticle brightness at all.

Hey, Houston, let me doublecheck on this. The .05 G light was on, in EMS TEST 1, when I went to NORMAL. And it seems to me like that's normal but it may not be. Could we check on that for sure.||CC|Okay, we're checking on that.||CMP|Can - press on with the activation here.||||Tape 201/2|||12 12 27 25|CDR|Houston, we're pressing on with the primary water evap activation at this time.||CC|Stand by 1.

It is not normal for the zero - .05 G light to be on in ENTRY TEST mode 1. It is probably a result of that drifting accelerometer. It's - we'll have to just wait and see what the rest of the test looks like.||CMP|Okay; the rest of the test was GO.||CC|Okay. Again, it's probably the result of that drifting accelerometer, and possibly under the high-g load of entry, it will be no problem at all.
