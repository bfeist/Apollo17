[04:18:05:25] CDR: Well, the next thing it says is that Gene gets out.
[04:18:05:29] LMP: I don't see that.
[04:18:05:32] CDR: That's what it says on my  checklist.  
[04:18:05:38] LMP: Okay.  Good heavens!
[04:18:05:40] CDR: That means you got to get out of the way so I can open the hatch.
[04:18:05:44] LMP: Well, I'm going to have to turn around a little, I think, so I can help you.
[04:18:05:47] CDR: Okay.    Boy, beware of that corner.
[04:18:05:53] LMP: This high pressure...
[04:18:05:55] CDR: Yeah.  I tell you at 4-1/2 , you're really pretty heavy .
[04:18:05:58] LMP: What was that that came shooting up here?  A piece of bread?   Would you believe that?
[04:18:06:04] CDR: Yeah, I'd believe it.
[04:18:06:07] LMP: Why is our hatch open?  Somebody opened our hatch.  Are you getting cooling?
[04:18:06:12] CDR: I'm beginning to, I think.  I still got a Water Flag.   not hot.
[04:18:06:18] LMP: Stand by.  Okay.    How does the water pressure look, Houston?
[04:18:06:46] xCC: Challenger, they're looking just a little bit low.  We're still expecting them to build up.  It's going to take a little while.
[04:18:06:53] CDR: Okay.  I'm getting down on my knees out here. How am I looking, Jack?
[04:18:06:57] LMP: You're just fine.  I'm holding you away from the DEDA... the DSKY.
[04:18:07:04] CDR: Okay.  I'm going to put this visor down now, I think.    How does that look to you?
[04:18:07:14] LMP: What?
[04:18:07:15] CDR: How are my legs?  Am I getting out?
[04:18:07:17] LMP: Well, I don't know.  I can't see your legs.
[04:18:07:19] CDR: Oh, okay.  
[04:18:07:22] LMP: I think you're getting out though, because there's not as much of you in here as there used to be.  Oh, hey, Gene, when I get down there, I got to fix your tool harness .  Hold it.
[04:18:07:32] CDR: Okay.  Can you reach it?
[04:18:07:33] LMP: It's come off the bottom again. 
[04:18:07:36] CDR: Can you reach it?
[04:18:07:37] LMP: Well, I can't do it now, because it's come off from the bottom.  I'll have to...
[04:18:07:40] CDR: Oh, the bottom of the PLSS, huh?
[04:18:07:41] LMP: Yeah.
[04:18:07:44] CDR: Okay.  Well, my legs are out.  Keep that hatch open.
[04:18:07:48] LMP: Can you squat down any further, because you're hooked on...  You're making it worse.  Okay.
[04:18:08:05] CDR: How's that?
[04:18:08:06] LMP: Okay.  Now, be careful because you might hook it on something down there.
[04:18:08:10] CDR: Oh, the tool harness?
[04:18:08:11] LMP: Yeah.  The back.  It's loose on your back; on the back of the PLSS.
[04:18:08:15] CDR: Oh, man, I don't like that.  Okay.  I'll watch it.
[04:18:08:17] LMP: Well, I'll fix it when I get out there.
[04:18:08:21] CDR: Okay.  I'm still reading 4.0 .  Houston, the Commander is on the porch of Challenger.
[04:18:08:30] xCC: Roger.  We copy you, Commander, and your feedwater pressure is looking much better...
[04:18:08:33] CDR: How am I...
[04:18:08:33] xCC: ...now, and you're probably getting cooling.
[04:18:08:39] CDR: Okay.  Everything else look good to you?
[04:18:08:42] xCC: That's affirmative.
[04:18:08:46] CDR: Okay, Jack.  I'm going to get the MESA .
[04:18:08:49] LMP: Okay.  And I'll have an ETB ready for you .
[04:18:08:51] CDR: Oh, man; oh, man; oh, man.
[04:18:08:58] LMP: Deploy, MESA!
[04:18:09:00] CDR: Okay.  Here it comes.    There she goes, Babe.
[04:18:09:08] LMP: Hey, hey!
[04:18:09:10] CDR: There she is.  All the way down; it looks like.  Okay.  I jettisoned...Oh, you want an ETB?
[04:18:09:19] LMP: That's up to you.
[04:18:09:21] CDR: Yeah.
[04:18:09:23] LMP: You're the commander.
[04:18:09:24] CDR: I got it!  I got it.  And, the  pressure looks like it's started to stabilize at 3.8.  I don't know whether I'm getting cooler or not, but I feel pretty good.
[04:18:09:40] xCC: Okay.  We copy that.
[04:18:09:41] LMP: How about a jett bag, too?
[04:18:09:43] CDR: Okay.  
[04:18:10:00] CDR:   Oh, Jack, I could swing it over the - it won't be any problem - over the strut.  Okay; and the jett bag is swinging free.
[04:18:10:13] LMP: You mean the ETB.
[04:18:10:14] CDR: ETB.  Oh, man.  This looks like a Santa Claus bag. 
[04:18:10:18] LMP: It is.
[04:18:10:22] CDR: Oh, boy.  There it goes.  The Rover looks in good shape.  ETB is down there.  Okay.  I've got all my visors down.  Jack, I wouldn't lower your gold visor until after you get on the porch, because it's plenty dark out here.
[04:18:10:38] LMP: Okay.
[04:18:10:39] CDR: Okay...
[04:18:10:40] LMP:   Tape recorder...
[04:18:10:42] CDR: ...I'm on my way .
[04:18:10:43] LMP: ...is off.  Sensitivity, max and max.
[04:18:10:55] CDR: Okay, Houston.  The Commander is about three quarters of the way down.  
[04:18:11:09] CDR: I'm on the footpad.  And, Houston, as I step off at the surface at Taurus-Littrow, we'd like to dedicate the first step of Apollo 17 to all those who made it possible.  
[04:18:11:30] CDR: Jack, I'm out here.  Oh, my golly!  Unbelievable!  Unbelievable; but is it bright in the Sun.    Okay!  We landed in a very shallow depression.  That's why we've got a slight pitch-up angle.   very shallow, dinner-plate-like, dish crater just about the width of the struts .  How you doing, Jack?
[04:18:12:12] LMP: Fine.  Getting the circuit breakers verified .
[04:18:12:19] CDR: The LM looks beautiful.    Oh, do we have boulder tracks coming down .  Let me see exactly where we are.  I think I may be just in front of Punk.
[04:18:12:43] xCC: Okay.  We copy that, Gene; and are the boulder tracks...
[04:18:12:46] CDR: I'm beginning to...
[04:18:12:46] xCC: ...to both the north and south?
[04:18:12:53] CDR:   Okay.  On the North Massif we've got very obvious boulder tracks.  A couple of large boulders come within 20 or 30 feet of the ...Looks like where we can get to them; there's a couple I know we can get to.  Well, the Sun angle is such that, what I saw on the South Massif earlier, I can't see very well.  But, I know there were boulder tracks over there.  Bear Mountain...Boy, it's hard to look to the east .   Bear Mountain and the Sculptured Hills have a very, very similar texture on the surface.  The Sculptured Hills'  is like the wrinkled skin of an old, old, 100-year-old man.   is probably the best way I could put it.  Very, very hummocky, but smoothly pockmarked.  I do not see any boulders up on the Sculptured Hills from here.  But it's awful hard to look to the east and to the southeast.
[04:18:13:04] xCC: Okay.  We copy that, Gene.  Have you got an LMP with you yet?
[04:18:14:09] CDR: Well, here come his feet.  Jack, let me make sure...We didn't have an awful lot of dust on landing; but I can dig my foot in 8 or 10 inches, and I know we're at least that thick.
[04:18:14:20] CDR: There's a small little 1-meter crater right in front of us with a whole mess of glass right in the middle.  That's right in front of the MESA, as a matter of fact.  Right where I want to park the Rover.  Jack, you're looking good.
[04:18:14:38] xCC: Beautiful, guys; beautiful.
[04:18:14:42] CDR:   I'm going to take a quick look back.  I think this is Poppie, and I can give you a real better idea where we are.
[04:18:14:48] LMP:  Hatch is closed, barely.
[04:18:14:51] CDR: Hey, Jack, don't lock it.
[04:18:14:53] LMP: I'm not going to lock it.
[04:18:14:54] CDR: We've got to go back there.  You lose the key, and we're in trouble.
[04:18:15:01] LMP: Oh, I'm on the porch!
[04:18:15:05] CDR: Who said this place was smooth?  Oh, boy!  There's a lot of local depressions here I didn't figure existed.
[04:18:15:17] LMP: Hey, who's been tracking up my lunar surface?
[04:18:15:21] CDR: Hey, Bob, I'm east of the LM now.  I'm east of the LM, and the back strut of the LM is...Well, the LM straddles this crater I talked about, and that's where we get the pitch angle; the back strut is probably right down in the eastern one-third of that crater.  Just a very subtle crater.
[04:18:15:47] LMP: Hey, man; you had some forward velocity.
[04:18:15:50] CDR: That's what I wanted to have.  
[04:18:15:58] CDR: Boy, I look at some of these rocks that are filleted here, Jack, and there sure are a lot of sparklies in them.  Awful lot of sparklies.
[04:18:16:08] LMP: You landed in a crater!
[04:18:16:11] CDR: That's a pretty good shot.
[04:18:16:15] CDR: Okay.  I'm going to get to work in a minute, just as soon as I take a look at Trident .
[04:18:16:18] LMP: Why don't you come over here and let me deploy your  antenna .
[04:18:16:22] CDR: Okay.  Just walk around for one second.
[04:18:16:25] LMP:   Hey, man, put your visor down.
[04:18:16:30] CDR: And, I'll be over there, and you can fix my tool harness.  I don't like that thing loose.
[04:18:16:35] LMP: I don't like it loose, either.  What are you doing over there ?  We're supposed to be working.
[04:18:16:39] CDR: I was just going to give them a fix .  All these little craters, Jack, have got glass in the bottom of them.  Here's another one.
[04:18:16:46] LMP:   There's very clear sweeping of the surface by the descent plume out, oh, about 10 meters.  No, 15 meters.      Come over here, and I'll fix your antenna.
[04:18:17:10] CDR: Okay.  Hey, Bob, how big is Poppie supposed to be?
[04:18:17:14] xCC: Stand by.  
[04:18:17:17] xCC: It looks on the map...
[04:18:17:19] CDR: I didn't hear you.  You cut out.
[04:18:17:21] xCC: Okay.  It looks on the map like it's about 75 meters in diameter.  Fairly subtle.
[04:18:17:28] CDR: Okay.  Okay, I tell you where I think I landed...Oh, about 100 meters from Poppie at 10 o'clock.
[04:18:17:38] LMP: You think that's Poppie, huh?
[04:18:17:40] CDR: I think so.  I think...
[04:18:17:41] LMP: That's an awful big hole.
[04:18:17:42] CDR:   Well, I know.  I got to look around a little more.  It sure is not Trident.  Bend over and I'll...
[04:18:17:48] LMP: It might be part of Trident.
[04:18:17:49] CDR: ...get your antenna.  Get your antenna.  Oh, a little more.    God, it's beautiful out here. 
[04:18:17:57] LMP: Well, hang on.
[04:18:17:59] CDR: Yep.  
[04:18:18:05] LMP:   Okay.  The immediate surf...
[04:18:18:06] CDR: Not yet.  Yeah, you talk to them.  I don't want you to stand up yet.
[04:18:18:11] LMP: The surface is moderately cohesive, which holds a pretty good bootprint.  Very fine-grained.  Gene's  looks very much like previous soils .    You got it?
[04:18:18:24] CDR: Yeah.
[04:18:18:26] LMP: You got a hole behind you now.
[04:18:18:28] CDR: Well, I'll stand in it, and you can get at it better.
[04:18:18:31] LMP: Well, you got me right in  the Sun.  Can you come around this way?  Ho-ho.    I'm going to have to get upstream of you.
[04:18:18:43] CDR: Look, you get up on the hill, and I'll get in the hole.
[04:18:18:45] LMP: Yeah.  There you go.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[04:18:18:48] CDR: Don't move too fast.  Boy, your feet look like you just...
[04:18:18:51] LMP:   Walked on the Moon, huh?  Well, I tell you Gene, I think the next generation ought to accept this as a challenge.    Let's see them leave footsteps like these someday.  Got another...Well, that'll be all right.
[04:18:19:12] CDR: Okay.  What did you do with my tool harness?
[04:18:19:15] LMP: I'm going to work on it; that's what I'm going to do.    Whoa; hold still.
[04:18:19:21] CDR: Okay.    Boy, I tell you, looking to the east, you might just as well forget it.  
[04:18:19:33] LMP: Well, let's see.  How's this thing...I'm going to have to loosen it.
[04:18:19:37] CDR: Well, if you could just stretch it around. 
[04:18:19:38] LMP: I can't.
[04:18:19:39] CDR: You can't, huh?
[04:18:19:40] LMP: But I will be in a minute.
[04:18:19:42] CDR: Don't loosen it to the point where you can't get it back on.
[04:18:19:45] LMP: Won't.    Okay.  You're almost reconfigured. 
[04:18:19:53] CDR: Okay.  
[04:18:19:59] LMP: Okay.    Somebody tied you on wrong, too.  They've got the strap reversed for the Velcro.  Okay, Gene.  I think that'll hold.
[04:18:20:15] CDR: Okay, and I'm going to...
[04:18:20:17] LMP: If it doesn't, I'll fix you again.
[04:18:20:20] CDR: Man, there's sparklies in the soil, Jack.   You can  just look at it.  See them all over?  Very fine-grained.  It's sparkly, that's all.  Bob, I'm going to Min cooling... or, intermediate cooling.
[04:18:20:33] xCC: Okay.  Copy that.
[04:18:20:35] LMP: Boy, that sure...
[04:18:20:36] CDR: See the soil sparkle?
[04:18:20:40] LMP: Yeah, I think that's little  glass.
[04:18:20:43] CDR: Let's go back here and get to work, and I'll show you that crater that's got nothing but glass in the bottom.
[04:18:20:47] LMP: That's a vesicular rock of some kind there, Geno.  It almost looks like a Mono Craters  pumice, but don't quote me.
[04:18:21:01] CDR: Bob, I have to reiterate.  Even the small, even the very small - the 1- and 2-inch, 3-inch - fragments that are laying around here - have been dusted and filleted...
[04:18:21:12] LMP: Do-tu-doo!
[04:18:21:13] CDR: ...with the dark mantle.
[04:18:21:16] LMP: And that sweeping by the descent stage goes all the way out there, Houston, to where we were; which was about 50 meters, I guess.  Hey, man...  Whuh, whuh, whuh, whuh.  Hey, these rocks, they almost have a very light pinkish hue to them, and they're not obviously breccia.  Now, that's like a breccia there.  But this is something else again.
[04:18:21:50] CDR: Yeah.  I don't think there is any place you could land around here where you wouldn't have one foot in a crater.
[04:18:21:54] LMP: Looks like a vesicular, very-light-colored porphyry of some kind; it's about 10 or 15 percent vesicles.  I'm right in front  of the LM.  Quite a few of the rocks look of that type.  Sort of a pinkish hue to them.  The texture is coarse, but I'm not sure how crystalline they are, yet.
[04:18:22:24] CDR: Okay; back to work.  Jack, when you put up the ETB , check down there below it.
[04:18:22:31] LMP: Oh-ho-ho.  
[04:18:22:33] CDR: Okay, let me take a look at the Rover. 
[04:18:22:35] LMP: Let's don't forget those .
[04:18:22:37] CDR: Yep.
[04:18:22:39] LMP: That's my fault; I guess .
[04:18:22:41] CDR: Well...
[04:18:22:42] LMP: Okay.
[04:18:22:44] CDR: Oh man, I tell you, we came down at just a little forward velocity.  Look at that, right there.  About a -foot slip on the pad.  I tell you, there's craters all over here.  Okay, baby.  I'd sure like to think that that  wheel is where it's supposed to be.  It looks good to me.    Our next little vehicle to work.    Okay.  Bob, so far, the Rover looks pretty good.
[04:18:23:39] xCC: Roger; sounds good, Geno.
[04:18:23:44] CDR:   Hey, let me ask you.  When I was behind the LM, I could look right into an area and see the bell of the ascent stage.  I never realized that before, but I guess that's normal, huh?
[04:18:23:55] LMP: Yeah; We saw it on the  pad .  Remember. 
[04:18:23:58] CDR: Barely.
[04:18:24:00] LMP: Remember when we went out there?
[04:18:24:05] CDR: The only reason I asked, Bob, I'm sure it's normal, and it doesn't look anything's missing, it's just right into the Sun.
[04:18:24:13] xCC: Yeah, the consensus of opinion down here is that you can, also.
[04:18:24:20] CDR: Well, that's probably the best place in the world to get a consensus of opinion from.  Okay, Jack, it's about work time.  I've got this Rover about ready for your pull up there.
[04:18:24:33] LMP: I got a little delayed here.
[04:18:24:35] CDR: Okay.    I'm sure glad those guys made us train so hard.
[04:18:24:49] LMP: Okay.  The MESA's up.  Let me know when you're ready to deploy.
[04:18:24:55] CDR: Okay.  Babe, I am ready for you.  Everything I can see looks pretty good.  The walking hinges, you will be glad to know, are intact!  They did not drop.
[04:18:25:12] xCC: Roger!  That's a first.
[04:18:25:14] LMP: You want me to go up there and do that, huh?
[04:18:25:16] CDR: Yes, sir.  The beginning.
[04:18:25:21] LMP: You ready for me to deploy?
[04:18:25:23] CDR: Okay.  Let me just double-check.    &quot;Drape, contingency, unstow aft deployment cable, verify  walking hinge, forward and aft chassis parallel.&quot;  They are.
[04:18:25:31] LMP: MESA insulation is not coming off as easy as in training.
[04:18:25:35] CDR: Okay.  Outrigger cables are taut.  Looking good to me.  Yeah, Jack.  You can go on up.  Go on up.
[04:18:25:46] LMP: Okay.
[04:18:25:47] CDR: I'm ready for you.  God, that LM is a pretty sight.  Challenger, you're a beauty!
[04:18:25:55] LMP: Well, let's see how good I am .
[04:18:25:57] CDR:   Don't drop that.  Let me get that thing again.    Yes, sir.      Yes, sir.  You're pretty agile there, twinkletoes.
[04:18:26:14] LMP: You bet your  life I am.
[04:18:26:17] CDR:   All I asked you to do was pull that handle up there.    Man, anything you grab, Jack...I just grabbed this lanyard that was in the dust  is really black. 
[04:18:26:27] LMP: You ready?
[04:18:26:29] CDR: Go.  She fell, Houston.  She's open.
[04:18:26:33] LMP: Okay.  You've got parallel chassis; the wheels look good on this side.
[04:18:26:36] CDR: Okay.  They're good on this side.  Get down and let's get it out.    I'll wait for you to get the deploy cable.  I'll tell you, Jack, this place is not locally level.
[04:18:26:51] LMP: You're right.
[04:18:26:55] CDR: Okay.  There's not many places you could put the LM down and have it be zero, zero, zero .  Okay.  I'm ready if you are.  
[04:18:27:08] LMP: I don't know how much help I'm going to be.
[04:18:27:10] CDR: Well, I'm starting; you pull.  It's coming.  It's coming.  It's coming, baby.  How's your wheels on that side?  Can you see them?  Mine look good.
[04:18:27:21] LMP: Wheels?  They looked good a minute ago.  I got the Sun, so I can't tell much...
[04:18:27:26] CDR: Okay.  
[04:18:27:36] CDR: Eeee!  The only way to do it.
[04:18:27:38] LMP: I'm putting all my weight.  
[04:18:27:40] CDR: Okay.  Wait a minute.  I'm coming down now.  She's going to pop here.
[04:18:27:43] LMP: Okay.
[04:18:27:44] CDR: Wait a minute.  Stand by.
[04:18:27:46] LMP: I may pull a Jim Irwin here.
[04:18:27:47] CDR: Wait a minute.  Watch out.  Here she goes!
[04:18:27:49] LMP: Got her.
[04:18:27:50] CDR: Okay.  Beautiful, Houston.  The aft chassis's out. 
[04:18:27:53] xCC: Roger.  Beautiful.
[04:18:27:55] LMP: Beautiful.  Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Tried to get off the hinge there.
[04:18:28:03] CDR: Yeah, yeah.  She's on, though.  She's all in.  She's in the walking hinges.  I wish you could see it.  Jack, those wheels did not lock all the way up though.  We ought to pull them up before we...
[04:18:28:14] LMP: 
[04:18:28:15] CDR: Well, there it goes, by itself.  Okay.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Okay.  Let me pull it until the outriggers cables get slack.
[04:18:28:27] LMP: Okay.  Walk away from it; that's easier .
[04:18:28:35] CDR: That tape up there on that reel...
[04:18:28:37] LMP: Yeah, it's all...
[04:18:28:38] CDR: It's coming.
[04:18:28:40] LMP: It's free reeling.
[04:18:28:41] CDR: Yeah.  Let me...Let me...Don't pull it until I...Okay.  Now I've got it.    Man, I'd fall into that crater  if I went to the end of this line.
[04:18:28:59] LMP: Houston, I do think we've got a different...
[04:18:29:02] CDR: Well, we're deploying it at an angle.  Okay.  The outrigger cables are free, Jack.
[04:18:29:06] LMP: Okay.    Got a different breed of rock up here.  The stuff's sticking through this thin regolith...Or regolith, period.  I don't know whether it's thin or thick yet.  Oop, oop, oop bo-doop-boop.  Okay.  Mine's free.
[04:18:29:22] CDR: Let me get all this cable out of the way.  Otherwise I'll...Got enough of this stuff.  I don't like all that over there.  .
[04:18:29:35] LMP: A geologist's paradise, if I ever saw one.  Boy, you certainly are changing the color of that cable, sir.
[04:18:29:44] CDR: Man.  Just tried a John Young trick.
[04:18:29:48] LMP: Did it work?
[04:18:29:50] CDR: Yeah.  
[04:18:29:51] LMP: You're getting dirty.
[04:18:29:52] CDR: But, I'm still getting my balance.  I didn't touch the ground.  Just got to get some of this cable out of here.
[04:18:30:02] LMP: I'm not sure my pockets are going to be accessible.  
[04:18:30:12] CDR: Man, I'll tell you, I don't know how long this line to pull the Rover out is, but...  Well, I'll tell you, it sure is easy to get dusty, but that's nothing new to anybody.  Okay, Babe, let me get...Whee!
[04:18:30:31] LMP: I think it's safe to say this surface was not formed yesterday.  There is a regolith; it looks classic.  Seriate distribution of particles up to 3 or 4 centimeters, anyway.  Then, you start to get maybe a selective distribution of large fragments.
[04:18:30:49] LMP: Got that cable?
[04:18:30:51] CDR: Yep.
[04:18:30:52] LMP: Okay.  I'm going to walk away with this one.
[04:18:30:54] CDR: Okay; outrigger cable.
[04:18:30:56] LMP: You ready?
[04:18:30:57] CDR: Okay.    &quot;When forward wheels on surface&quot;; okay.  Let me pull .    Okay, Houston.  She's continuing to come.  
[04:18:31:14] LMP:   Here's a couple of different-looking rocks.  One's very white; one's quite dark.  But we do have a general rock type, I think, in the area.   of the big boulders.
[04:18:31:24] LMP: Jesus, how much cable is there?
[04:18:31:27] CDR: There's a lot of it, Jack.  Keep going.    You're going to be a long way away.  We're not there yet.  Keep going.    Okay.  We've got the front wheels on the surface, but keep going, I don't think you've got it up there.
[04:18:31:48] LMP: I never thought I'd do geology this way.
[04:18:31:52] CDR: Okay.  I think you got it.  Let me see. 
[04:18:31:58] LMP: Is it slack?
[04:18:32:00] CDR: I'll get up there and take a look.    Okay.  It's slack.
[04:18:32:10] LMP: Longest cable in the world.
[04:18:32:12] CDR: It's slack.
[04:18:32:14] xCC: Wait till you get to the ALSEP package.
[04:18:32:16] CDR: Okay.  By golly, those wheels did lock.
[04:18:32:19] LMP:   I never knew that cable was that long, Bob.  Oh, a glass-bottom crater with a little bench!  Looks like one of the Flagstaff explosion craters except for the glass in it.  Right out at 12 o'clock.  That's the one I was talking about having a bright halo.
[04:18:32:40] LMP: I don't know whether it's easier to walk out there or to do what I did in training.   said I wouldn't do on the Moon.
[04:18:32:52] LMP:   Somebody's going to get tangled up with this thing.
[04:18:32:55] CDR: That's why I'd get it all under the LM somewhere.  It took me 5 minutes to do and get it all out of the way.  Okay, Bob, the front wheels locked in.  I had to pull the rear wheels back to get them to lock in.
[04:18:33:11] xCC: Okay.  Copy that.
[04:18:33:16] CDR: At least no one let any air out of the tires.
[04:18:33:19] CDR: Man, I look like I've been on the surface for a week already.  Holy smoley.  Okay.    &quot;Pull pins on deploy cable and fittings; move LRV from LM.&quot;
[04:18:33:29] LMP: Wait a minute.  I haven't let my ...
[04:18:33:30] CDR: Okay.
[04:18:33:32] LMP: ...other pins.  It's going to take awhile.  Think we can avoid that cable?
[04:18:33:37] CDR: Why don't you set it there, pull this pin, and then you can go back and get it; that is, it's better to use the Rover contingency tool, because...
[04:18:33:42] LMP: Yeah, but that's off over there on the ground now, somewhere or another.
[04:18:33:44] CDR: Okay.  Pull that pin.  See if you can get that saddle loose.
[04:18:33:52] LMP: It's loose.
[04:18:33:53] CDR: Ah, beautiful.  Okay, we're going to have to move that line, Jack.  You ready?
[04:18:33:57] LMP: I'll move it.
[04:18:33:58] CDR: Okay.  Let's find a...Back over here.  See there? 
[04:18:34:02] LMP: Yeah.
[04:18:34:05] CDR: Oh, man.    Face a little more east, so I don't have to run into the rim .  Okay, how about here?
[04:18:34:18] LMP: You're the driver.
[04:18:34:19] CDR: Okay; right there.
[04:18:34:20] LMP: You like it?
[04:18:34:21] CDR: Like it.
[04:18:34:23] LMP: Okay.  You got it.
[04:18:34:24] CDR: Now, Jack, you got some fenders and stuff for me...
[04:18:34:26] LMP:   I was going to get my cable .  I thought you said I could work on the cable.
[04:18:34:28] CDR: Ohh.
[04:18:34:30] LMP: You're putting me farther and farther behind.
[04:18:34:32] CDR: Oop.
[04:18:34:33] LMP: Don't forget your post.
[04:18:34:35] CDR: Okay.
[04:18:34:38] LMP: Okay.  Pull pins.  I can see a little yellow .
[04:18:34:46] CDR: Okay.  The post is up.
[04:18:34:50] LMP: Hinge pins.
[04:18:34:51] CDR: Okay.  Yours is in, but mine is not.
[04:18:34:54] LMP: Well, neither's my outboard one.
[04:18:34:57] CDR: My outboard is in, but my inboard is not.
[04:18:35:04] LMP: And my outboard isn't.
[04:18:35:06] CDR: Well.
[04:18:35:09] LMP: That's supposed to do it.  But it didn't. 
[04:18:35:13] CDR: Let me get the contingency tool and try to push those things closed.
[04:18:35:16] LMP: Okay.  Be careful.  
[04:18:35:27] CDR: Here's a piece of glass I picked up.  I'm going to set it right on the floor of the Rover.  Jack, let me get that  tool.  We got to get those pins in, I think.  
[04:18:35:51] CDR: Bob, you got any words on the yellow pins on the rear chassis?
[04:18:35:55] xCC: Roger.  The best way to put those in, if you've tried bouncing the chassis, would be to push them with the contingency tool.  Which I think is what you're going to do.
[04:18:36:06] LMP: That's affirm.  Can you get that , Geno?    Need some help?
[04:18:36:23] CDR: Nope.    Well, I found how to get up!
[04:18:36:42] LMP: Did you fall down?
[04:18:36:43] CDR:   Well, this thing  was in the mud down here.  We'll find out in a minute.
[04:18:36:52] CDR: Okay, Jack.  Got an &quot;out&quot; one here, huh? 
[04:18:36:56] LMP: Yeah.
[04:18:36:57] CDR: Let me try to push it in.    Okay.  Yours is in.
[04:18:37:07] LMP: Good.
[04:18:37:12] CDR: See if I can get mine in.  
[04:18:37:17] LMP: Want me to get it?
[04:18:37:18] CDR: Well, yeah.  Can you reach it from there?  Just a nice firm ...I'll hold it  on it .  Almost.  A little more.  Wait a minute.  Let me get it.  Let me get it right.    Okay; push.  It's in.  It's in.
[04:18:37:35] LMP: Very good.  Why don't you put that  between the seats?
[04:18:37:39] CDR: Okay.  Bob, they're in.
[04:18:37:40] xCC: Copy that.
[04:18:37:44] CDR: Okay.  Now where was I ?    I got my fender, got the post, got to get the seat.    Ahhh.
[04:18:37:54] LMP: Ready?
[04:18:37:56] CDR: I'm going to take it a little slower here in a minute.
[04:18:37:58] LMP: Yeah.
[04:18:38:01] CDR: Just a little bit slower in a minute.
[04:18:38:04] LMP: The blush is off the rose.  Okay, your front pin is in.  And both of mine are in.
[04:18:38:12] CDR: Okay.  I'll look at them.  
[04:18:38:25] LMP: Not quite as easy as in the training building.
[04:18:38:28] CDR: Well, it's a case of knowing how to play in one-sixth g, is what it amounts to.  Okay.    Okay.  I'm ready on the...
[04:18:38:40] LMP: You locked?  Yeah.  It's locked.
[04:18:38:43] CDR: Let me get the seat down.  Okay.  I got the console.
[04:18:38:47] LMP: Okay; and I got the handle.
[04:18:38:50] CDR: Okay; mine's pulled.
[04:18:38:51] LMP: Mine's pulled.
[04:18:38:52] CDR: Come on down, baby.  There it comes.  Stiff, but come on.
[04:18:38:56] LMP: There it is.
[04:18:38:57] CDR: Okay; make sure your T- locks.
[04:18:38:58] LMP: I'm not...You're not all the way down yet, Gene.
[04:18:39:00] CDR: Yeah.  I'm locked.
[04:18:39:01] LMP: There you go.
[04:18:39:03] CDR: Okay.
[04:18:39:04] LMP: Okay.  I'm locked and secured.  Okay.  
[04:18:39:18] CDR: Oh!  Jack, I put a little piece of glass I picked up right by the Rover, here.
[04:18:39:22] LMP: Yeah.  Okay.
[04:18:39:23] CDR: Just a little piece.  I'm going to leave it right behind your footstool.  It just sparkled at me.  I had to pick it up.  See that?
[04:18:39:28] LMP: Okay, that's yours: your sample for the day.
[04:18:39:33] CDR: I doubt that.  Man, I tell you, zero g is a piece of cake if you -  or one-sixth g - if you'd play it right.
[04:18:39:45] LMP: Okay, Gene, you've got fenders;  your pin was good.  I checked that.  I could see mine, too.  Mine are okay, and you'll have to check your outside ones.
[04:18:39:57] CDR: Okay.  My two pins are good here.
[04:18:39:58] LMP: Yeah.  And mine are good.
[04:18:40:00] CDR: This one isn't quite flush.  Almost.  It's good.
[04:18:40:02] LMP: I'm going to pull your flags.  Oops, I bent that one.  And your attitude indicator is free.
[04:18:40:17] CDR: Man, look at that stuff go, will you?  Went over that...
[04:18:40:18] xCC: And, Jack, this is Houston.  Looks like your water temperature's getting pretty high.  You might want to go to intermediate cooling or slow down or something.  Looks like you're getting a little warm.  
[04:18:40:38] CDR: You hear them, Jack?
[04:18:40:39] LMP: Yeah.  I got it.  Thank you, Bob.
[04:18:40:42] CDR: Okay, Jack, get that  cable, because I tripped over it coming back.
[04:18:40:45] LMP: Yeah.  I'll get it.
[04:18:40:47] CDR: Okay.  Let's see.    Verify hinge pins and seal. Erect seat; seatbelt.   Armrest is lowered.  Pull T-handle.  Console's lowered.  Tripod apex  is gone both sides.   tool behind footrest; that's done.  Front hinge pins are in.  Erect footrest.  Extend front fenders; they're down.    Verify batt covers are closed.  They are closed.  And let's keep them clean.  Man, do these gloves fit good!
[04:18:41:21] xCC: Okay; and 17, you're right on schedule.
[04:18:41:23] CDR: Okay.    Thank you, Bob.    Did you tell Captain America  we're on the surface?
[04:18:41:40] xCC: Roger.  We broke the news to him a while ago.
[04:18:41:47] CDR: Okay; the next spacecraft  to power-up is going to commence right now.  
[04:18:42:03] LMP: Okay.  That takes care of that little job.
[04:18:42:10] LMP: How's my cooling look now, Bob?  Oops.
[04:18:42:13] xCC: Rog.  It's come down quite a bit.  You were eighty-six , and now it's down to seven five.  Looks much better.  We didn't want you to sweat.
[04:18:42:20] LMP: Well, I'm just a hot geologist; that's all.
[04:18:42:24] xCC: Or something.  
[04:18:42:43] LMP: Somebody  kicked dirt all over the MESA.
[04:18:42:47] CDR: Let's see if there is any life in this here baby.    Okay.  Getting up and on.
[04:18:43:13] LMP: Give me a yell when you start to go, and I'll try to be sure to be there with the camera.
[04:18:43:16] CDR: Okay.  
[04:18:43:24] LMP: Big bag is deployed.
[04:18:43:29] xCC: Copy that.  
[04:18:43:44] CDR: Well, the seat belt fits perfect.
[04:18:43:49] LMP: Shoot.  I thought I was going to get to drive.
[04:18:43:52] CDR: Man, I got so much dust over my visor already, I got to wipe it off.  Get that lens brush; I want you to dust me off a little later, Jack.
[04:18:44:04] LMP: The lens brush!?
<blockquote>] ack finds the suggestion incredulous; the lens brush is much too small for the job, being about an inch long and perhaps a half an inch wide.  The bristles are very fine, perhaps camel hair.]</i></blockquote>
[04:18:44:05] CDR: Well, I've got to dust my visor off with something.
[04:18:44:08] xCC: Roger.  Don't use your glove or the dustbrush.
<blockquote>] he dustbrush, to be used for sweeping dust off the battery covers and other large surfaces, is the size of a large house-paint brush, perhaps six inches across.  The bristles, like Gene's dust impregnated gloves, would scratch the visor.]</i></blockquote>
[04:18:44:09] CDR: Okay; when I was bringing that...  No, we'll use the lens brush, Bob.
[04:18:44:15] xCC: Roger.
<blockquote>] ernan - &quot;The dust was very difficult to work in and was a big hindrance.  It obscured your vision if you let it get on your visor.  It was almost like a dew or mist because it clung to everything.  It got on every movable surface, it got in the suits, and when we got out  of our suits in the spacecraft in between EVAs, it got in the pores of our  skin and got under our fingernails.  And it didn't just get on the outside  parts of our nails and get them dirty but, literally, it got down between the  skin and the nail.  It took three months for lunar dust to grow out from  under my nails.  It infiltrates.&quot;]
[&quot;I des]  lunar dust as being like very, very fine graphite.  But graphite is a lubricating material; this is not.  This is just the opposite; it's very abrasive.  And it has a smell very few people, if any, have smelled on the Earth.  It smells something like spent gunpowder; like you've just fired a shotgun or something and you can smell that powder.  The dust made lunar operations half again more difficult than it would have been without the dust.  It took time to dust ourselves off, to clean the equipment.  I knocked a fender off and quickly found out that you can't operate in a Rover vehicle without a fender because you throw dust all over.&quot;]
[LMP: - &] I don't remember the dust creating an obscuration problem, except that, when you looked back into the Sun, the Sun would sparkle over it like a dirty windshield.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
[04:18:44:17] CDR:   Okay.  Let's try to see if I can read in this Sun, now.
<blockquote>] ene is reading power-up instructions written on a decal affixed to the console.]</i></blockquote>
[04:18:44:21] CDR:   Check handcontroller.  Let's wipe it out a couple of times to make sure we got all the steering.  She's wiped out.
<blockquote>] chmitt - &quot;'Wiping out' the controller is a hand motion a bit like wiping a table.  It's an old pilot's term for what you do to the stick in an airplane to check that all your ailerons are working, and Gene was just transferring that expression to the Rover, checking all of the controller positions.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
[04:18:45:00] CDR: She goes forward and she goes reverse.  She's back in forward; and she's wiped out, and she's in park.  Reverse is down.  Okay.    Here we go.  Stand by for life.  It ought to be on this one.  There's life in this here baby.  Beautiful.
[04:18:45:10] LMP: I don't know who's responsible for packing this ETB, but I think it was me.  You didn't by any chance pick up those scissors, did you?
[04:18:45:19] CDR: No, sir.
[04:18:45:20] LMP: They're going to be hard to find, but I think we can do it.
<blockquote>] chmitt - &quot;The whole exercise had been put together on the assumption that we would have two pairs of scissors; but, because Ron had lost his and we had left him one of our pairs, we had to keep track of the one pair we had left.  And, of course, they'd fallen out of the ETB as it was being lowered out of the LM.  We took them out onto the surface just as a contingency tool, but we had to have them when we went back in the LM because otherwise we would have had a tough time opening the food containers.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
[04:18:45:25] CDR: Well, they were right down there , unless you picked them up.  That's exactly where the Rover tool was, too, and I picked it up, so they're probably there.  I didn't see them though.  Okay.
[04:18:45:40] LMP: Okay.  I got my camera.

[04:18:47:50] CDR: Okay.  I can't see the rear ones, but I know the front ones turn.  And it does move.  Hallelujah.  Hallelujah, Houston!  Challenger's baby is on the roll.
[04:18:48:04] xCC: Roger.  Copy that.  Sounds great.
<blockquote>] ernan - &quot;While I don't remember the details, if the Rover hadn't worked, we were going to try and cover some of the same ground; but we wouldn't have gone nearly as far or have accomplished nearly as much as we did.&quot;]
[LMP: - &] It was my position that the probability of the Rover failing was small, so why waste our time in training or planning on walking traverses that you could put together fairly easily in real-time.  You knew basically where you wanted to go and you just would have to see how well you were doing and how much energy it was going to take. We couldn't have taken all of the equipment, but we had the bags for samples. I'm not sure we could have mounted SCBs on both sides of the PLSSs - might only have had one apiece -  but we could have put quite a bit of equipment in one SCB and samples in the other.  It would have been awkward, but there would be no question that we would have gotten something done.  The real question is how far we could have gone.  And I suspect that on the first EVA we wouldn't have gone very far until we were use to it.  But it is still my contention that, if you got up-to-speed striding, you could have gone as far as you did with the Rover.  It just would have taken more energy and your walkback constraints would have changed.  I'm sure the Flight Control people would have been very conservative with walkback, at least with the first two EVAs; we might have gotten the envelope opened up a little bit for the third.  I doubt if they would have let us go to Nansen, because that was right at the edge of the Rover walkback envelope; but we probably could have gotten up the hillside to Station 6, simply by going sidehill rather than directly uphill like the Apollo 14 guys did.  But I just couldn't imagine very many reasonable failures that would keep you from having the Rover.  You had front and rear wheel drive so you could go either way; and you could lift it out of any hole it got into.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
[04:18:48:08] CDR: And judging from the way it's handling, I think the rear wheels are steering too.
[04:18:48:19] xCC: That's a first.
<blockquote>] n both of the other Rover missions, steering problems occurred at power-up.  On Apollo 15, Dave Scott had no front steering and, on Apollo 16, John Young had no rear steering.  For unknown reasons, both Rovers later regained full steering - at the start of EVA-2 in the case of Apollo 15 and after Rover preps in the case of Apollo 16.  Because the Rovers all had both front and rear steering, the losses were not of any particular concern.]</i></blockquote>

I guess about 150 meters due west of Barjea.  And that's why we looked so close to Trident.  I'm coming right up on Poppie.  No question about where I am now.  I've got Trident, and when I get up there...We are abeam of Trident 1, just where I said we were.  I'm right at Poppie.  We're about, oh, 100 meters just about due west of Poppie, which is almost in line with Barjea, of course; but basically  on the  line, I think, between Rudolph and Trident 1.

We were close to the planned landing site and we certainly weren't going to have any trouble finding Camelot or any of the other places.    Somewhere, and possibly in here where Gene was describing the landing site, the cuff on my urine collection device was too tight.  I needed to urinate but couldn't unless I really forced it.

[04:18:53:48] xCC: Okay.  We have that.
<blockquote>] chmitt - &quot;I spent a lot of time in the Receiving Lab looking at samples from the other missions, and had in my own mind a grain-size classification and a variety of other classifications that I'd be using throughout all of this.  I shouldn't really have used the term 'gabbro', but it had stuck in my mind as a way to distinguish a coarser-grained version of basalt.  That is, if I could see distinct, clear crystals and make a guess at what they were, I think I consistently called it a 'gabbro'.  However, by definition, basalt is fine-grained; gabbro has the same chemical composition but is coarse-grained, although more coarse-grained than anything we saw on the valley floor.  So I probably confused a lot of people on the ground.  But this was coarser-grained than a lot of things that I had seen in hand specimens from other missions.  This had grains up to a millimeter or so across, whereas many of the samples  were so fine grained that they were even glassy.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

[A gnomon is] ort stick used for throwing a shadow, say on a sun dial.  Although there are gnomons on many of the ALSEP instruments, here Jack is referring to the geologic gnomon which provides a shadow, a length scale for photographs, and also, because the shadow stick is gimbaled, a local vertical. The gnomon has a color chart and gray scale attached to one of its three legs and, for stowage, the gnomon legs fold together - rather like the stays of an umbrella - making a slim package that can be slid into a quiver mounted on the left side of the pallet, behind Gene's seat.]
[Journal Con] tor Brian Lawrence adds, &quot;I love Jack's pun.  I started thinking about where the original saying 'No man is an island' and guessed maybe Shakespeare, and  then discovered it was John Donne.  It was published in 1624 and is from 'Meditation 17', from </i>Devotions upon Emergent Occasions<i> : 'No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were. Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.'&quot;]

At this moment , Gene's heart rate is rising above 130 beats per minute.  Throughout this period, Jack's heart rate has been generally lower than Gene's.  This first EVA is their most strenuous because of the Rover deployment, the ALSEP deployment, and, most importantly, the fact that they won't be spending much time riding on the Rover.]</i></blockquote>

[04:19:08:23] LMP:   I'll look in a minute, Gene.  But I tell you, once I start this little operation, if I don't finish it, it never gets done.
<blockquote>] chmitt - &quot;Soon after we got back, somebody put out an environmental poster that said 'If you've seen one Earth, you've seen them all'.&quot;]
[Cernan -&qu] viously, Jack and I have looked at the Earth differently.  I think we had very different subconscious views of what we saw.  That's always been true and it's probably true in all twelve guys.  To me, the Earth was a very dominant part of our mission.  It certainly made a statement.  You could hardly not notice that it was visible.  It was a dominant presence in our valley, without question.&quot;]
[&quot;For J] win, going to the Moon was a religious experience and, for me, it was a spiritual experience in terms of being there and looking back at the Earth, realizing the significance of what was going on.  The piloting part was very important for me to do well, better than it had ever been done before.  That's the nature of a pilot.  And, as for the science - although maybe I shouldn't say this - it was a part of our mission but it certainly was not the overriding part of me, and it's not the part that's overriding for me in my memory bank at all.  Of course, for Jack, for a geologist, the Moon was a utopia, a thing you would dream of your entire life.  Well, I was not a geologist by trade or profession and, although I tried to be one for the moment, being on the Moon was more of a spiritual experience for me.  Religion is what you make it, where you make it.  But the mission did bring home to me, very clearly, that Science has a long way to go yet to find an answer for the creation of the small part of the Universe that I was privileged to see.  It doesn't make any difference who your God is or how you address him; the Earth was just too beautiful to have happened by accident.  There has to be somebody bigger than me who put it together.  And when I say spiritual, that's what I mean.&quot;]
	[&quot;Cha] Duke is a born-again Christian and who is to say that that might not have happened if he hadn't gone to the Moon.  Jim Irwin looks back at it as a very religious experience, but Jim was like that before he went to the Moon.  And Jack looks at it from a humanist point of view.  What's important to Jack is what Man does with his life; and, although Jack's a very philosophical sort of guy, the creation of the Earth, from a philosophical point of view, is not something that he expresses himself on very strongly.  But we all have different points of view.  I had the experience of going to the Moon twice, of being able to go back and say 'Is this what I really saw?  Is this what I really felt?  Is this what it really looked like?'  To have seven more days at the Moon to do that is a pretty unique experience in itself.&quot;]
	[LMP: -] t;On the trip out to the Moon, I had spent a lot of time looking at the Earth.  I had this little program of meteorological observations that I wanted to undertake, so I'd already spent a lot of time looking at it, and so that's why I was acting a little more blas&eacute;.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

[04:19:00:36] LMP: Well, I hope it doesn't.    I find I'm using my arms almost as much as I ever did.  I remember the last time I was on the Moon: about 2 hours ago.      Okay, guess what?  That old hammer goes to the gate top.    The blue-handled hammer.  What more could you want?

[04:19:01:14] xCC: Okay.  Copy on that.  
<blockquote>] uring the traverses, the low-gain antenna  will be used for voice communications with Earth.  Because a voice signal doesn't have to carry nearly as much information as a TV signal, the broadcast strength can be weaker for voice and the antenna pointing doesn't need to be more accurate than about 30 degrees.  Gene will fit the antenna mast into a socket on his T-handle.]
[Cernan - &q] he low-gain antenna was a tube about an inch and a half in diameter and about 2 feet long.  There was a handle on the mast, right in front of me, and as I drove the Rover, I could point it generally in the direction of the Earth.  We could drive and maintain radio contact the whole time, and it worked out real well.&quot;]
[Apollo 17 i]  only mission with Earth far enough from the local zenith that the Commander sometimes has to re-aim the low-gain while he's driving.]
[Cernan - &q] he high-gain antenna for the television was on the front of the Rover, as I remember, and we couldn't reach it .  We aligned it after we stopped; but, if it was, per chance, pointed at the Earth and we were driving in a straight line, we could have gotten television as well.  We talked about trying to do that, but I don't think we did.  I think 15 or 16 transmitted some TV while they were driving.&quot;]

[A gnomon is] ort stick used for throwing a shadow, say on a sun dial.  Although there are gnomons on many of the ALSEP instruments, here Jack is referring to the geologic gnomon which provides a shadow, a length scale for photographs, and also, because the shadow stick is gimbaled, a local vertical. The gnomon has a color chart and gray scale attached to one of its three legs and, for stowage, the gnomon legs fold together - rather like the stays of an umbrella - making a slim package that can be slid into a quiver mounted on the left side of the pallet, behind Gene's seat.]
[Journal Con] tor Brian Lawrence adds, &quot;I love Jack's pun.  I started thinking about where the original saying 'No man is an island' and guessed maybe Shakespeare, and  then discovered it was John Donne.  It was published in 1624 and is from 'Meditation 17', from </i>Devotions upon Emergent Occasions<i> : 'No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were. Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.'&quot;]
[Readers of ] tain age may recall a far-worse use of Donne's phrase, in a Jefferson Airplane song.  &quot;No man is an island; he's a peninsula.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

At this moment , Gene's heart rate is rising above 130 beats per minute.  Throughout this period, Jack's heart rate has been generally lower than Gene's.

<blockquote>] chmitt - &quot;Soon after we got back, somebody put out an environmental poster that said 'If you've seen one Earth, you've seen them all'.&quot;]
[Cernan -&qu] viously, Jack and I have looked at the Earth differently.  I think we had very different subconscious views of what we saw.  That's always been true and it's probably true in all twelve guys.  To me, the Earth was a very dominant part of our mission.  It certainly made a statement.  You could hardly not notice that it was visible.  It was a dominant presence in our valley, without question.&quot;]
[&quot;For J] win, going to the Moon was a religious experience and, for me, it was a spiritual experience in terms of being there and looking back at the Earth, realizing the significance of what was going on.  The piloting part was very important for me to do well, better than it had ever been done before.  That's the nature of a pilot.  And, as for the science - although maybe I shouldn't say this - it was a part of our mission but it certainly was not the overriding part of me, and it's not the part that's overriding for me in my memory bank at all.  Of course, for Jack, for a geologist, the Moon was a utopia, a thing you would dream of your entire life.  Well, I was not a geologist by trade or profession and, although I tried to be one for the moment, being on the Moon was more of a spiritual experience for me.  Religion is what you make it, where you make it.  But the mission did bring home to me, very clearly, that Science has a long way to go yet to find an answer for the creation of the small part of the Universe that I was privileged to see.  It doesn't make any difference who your God is or how you address him; the Earth was just too beautiful to have happened by accident.  There has to be somebody bigger than me who put it together.  And when I say spiritual, that's what I mean.&quot;]
	[&quot;Cha] Duke is a born-again Christian and who is to say that that might not have happened if he hadn't gone to the Moon.  Jim Irwin looks back at it as a very religious experience, but Jim was like that before he went to the Moon.  And Jack looks at it from a humanist point of view.  What's important to Jack is what Man does with his life; and, although Jack's a very philosophical sort of guy, the creation of the Earth, from a philosophical point of view, is not something that he expresses himself on very strongly.  But we all have different points of view.  I had the experience of going to the Moon twice, of being able to go back and say 'Is this what I really saw?  Is this what I really felt?  Is this what it really looked like?'  To have seven more days at the Moon to do that is a pretty unique experience in itself.&quot;]
	[LMP: -] t;On the trip out to the Moon, I had spent a lot of time looking at the Earth.  I had this little program of meteorological observations that I wanted to undertake, so I'd already spent a lot of time looking at it, and so that's why I was acting a little more blas&eacute;.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

[04:20:18:27] CDR: Man, these things are just like they are at the Cape.  You can feel every one of them.
<blockquote>] chmitt - &quot;We had originally had things called Calfax fasteners holding the equipment together, but they were far too complicated.  I made a stink about that early on, way back in the mid-sixties.  So they invented or found another way to do it and replaced all the Calfax fasteners with these Boyd bolts.  The Calfax you had to turn several times; and these you only had to push in with the UHT and then turn a three-quarter turn and it would pop loose.&quot;]
[&quot;The c]  from Calfax fasteners to Boyd bolts occurred well before the first ALSEP.  We changed that at Bendix as soon as I got involved.  As I've already mentioned, Walt Cunningham, on a visit to Bendix early in the history of the ALSEP program - not knowing that there was going to be lots of things to see and do and describe and photograph - told them to give us something to do.  So Bendix put as many fasteners on this thing as they could.  But when Bill Anders and I showed up there - probably in '67, maybe late '66 - we saw this monster that they had constructed with over fifty of these Calfax fasteners.  I think it took two-and-a-half turns on each of them to get them loose.  So we yelled and screamed.  Well, not 'yelled and screamed'; but we suggested to them that they try to find a better fastener and reduce the number as much as they possibly could.  To be fair to Bendix, the contractors sometimes had a hell of a time responding to astronaut inputs. They felt like they ought to respond and so they had responded; and then the guy who made the input disappears - Cunningham was off working on Apollo 7 by this time and was out of the picture - and a couple of more come on who have different ideas.&quot;]
[&quot;On my] t visit to Bendix in Ann Arbor with Bill Anders - we flew up there in a little T-33 - I think we went through a shirtsleeve deployment of the mock-up that they had at the time.  And that's when we just about raised the roof on how long it was going to take and how much was required physically.  We really forced them into a whole re-design on the packaging and deployment.  The issue of the fasteners is the one that sticks in my mind because they were so egregious, but I'm sure there were lots of other change orders written.  I spent a lot of time trying to work with Bendix because I didn't want to use up any more time deploying the ALSEP than was absolutely necessary.  There were so many other things that I wanted to do, and wanted the rest of the guys to do - mostly collecting samples - that I wanted to minimize the amount of time we spend on the deployment. Deploying the ALSEP is exactly the kind of thing that robots generally ought to be used for, except for certain things like getting seismometers deployed and leveled.  Things like that are tough to do automatically and is probably cost effective to have a man do it.  But a lot of this other stuff could have been done robotically, even in those days.  It's just that the program didn't try to do it that way.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>] chmitt - &quot;For various reasons, you sometimes see places in a rock where it's splitting and coming apart.  In this case I was saying that I thought the splitting in the rock I'd just examined was produced by the alignment of prismatic habit minerals parallel to that plane; and that's called a foliation.  What that implies is some kind of stress during crystallization, either a flow stress as in a volcanic rock, or a shear stress during re-crystallization. By 'outcrop' you'd usually mean something attached to bedrock; in this case there would have been no evidence of that but, for some reason, probably just the size of the boulder, I used the term.&quot;]

<blockquote>] chmitt - &quot;By now I'm taking longer and longer strides and the running technique is getting to be very much like cross-country skiing.  On future missions, either for recreation or for an emergency walkback, you ought to have ski poles available for stabilization.  At this point I wasn't breathing hard and I think that, with poles, you could go faster than the Rover can drive  without expending much energy.  And that way you could greatly extend your driving distance with a Rover.  I also think the recreation of choice will be getting out and taking long 'skiing' trips.  Just like with cross-country skiing, I think you could almost keep it up indefinitely.  And if you had a suit with more hip-and-ankle mobility I think you really could do 10-15 km/hr, a good cross-country speed on flat terrain.&quot;]

[LMP: - &] I'd been doing 'instrument science' for several hours at this point, and I wasn't going to pass up a rock that size.  It was my first chance to look at the detailed texture of a big rock and to get some idea of how much I was going to be able to see if, and when, we got a chance to do some geology.  The ALSEP always did cut into the time for exploration and I spent an awful lot of my career as a troubleshooting astronaut trying to cut down the amount of time it would take people to deploy that thing.  And, although we had some successes, as the ALSEPs got more complicated, the amount of time spent in deployment always seemed to grow.&quot;]
[&quot;Geoph] ock was probably ejected from Camelot but, even if it had been thrown into the valley from a long way off, it gave you a chance to see if there were any textures on scales larger than you could see in a hand specimen, changes in the character and structure of the rock over distances of more than a few inches.  At Station 6, for example, examination of the big rocks there showed us some clear cases of intrusion by one breccia into another; and the chances of seeing something like that in a hand specimen are very small.  Geophone Rock was also a chance to do some geology standing up.  As soon as you had to bend down or squat down or lie down to see something, the physical stress became a distraction from your mental work.&quot;]
[&quot;As I ] l, Geophone Rock was my first chance to convince myself that I could distinguish several of the minerals in these relatively coarse-grained basalts.  In particular, I could see pyroxene and plagioclase, the plagioclase being most obvious because it gave white haloes around the micrometeorite impact craters - called 'zap pits' - on the rock surface.  It was also my first chance to look at the patina which had been identified as a splatter covering of brown glass produced by those same impacts.  Each zap would knock off patina right around the impact point, but would also add brown glass elsewhere, so, over a large rock surface, it was a steady-state process.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

One interpretation of Gene's &quot;unleaded, automatic&quot; core stem is that he means &quot;A-1, top quality&quot;.  During the mission review, Jack raised the possibility that there had been concern about lead contamination from the core tubes, themselves, during Apollo 15 and/or 16 and that there had been a design change as a result.  In her </i>Catalog of Apollo Lunar Surface Geological Sampling Tools and Containers<i>, Judy Allton writes: &quot;On Apollo 17, to reduce lead contamination of the cored soil from the drill stems and bit, the core stems were treated with nitric acid and special processes were employed in the application of lubricant and color codes.  Excess brazing compound was removed from the core bit to reduce silver and copper contamination.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>] ene gets a core plug from the rack.  His &quot;good&quot; has the flavor of &quot;I'm glad that it's you that has to do it.&quot;  He is at the bottom of CDR-20.]
[LMP: - &] Either one of us could have taken the ALSEP photos, depending on who was ahead in the timeline.  I can't remember why it was so onerous a job; but, apparently, neither one of us really wanted to do it.&quot;]
[The ALSEP p] lan appears on cuff checklist pages LMP-25 and CDR-23.  Although the photos were nominally Jack's responsibility, Gene's page CDR-22 indicates that, had he been ahead of Jack in the timeline, he was to help with the geophone deployment and the ALSEP photos, as appropriate.  The complexity of the photoplan explains why neither of them was eager to do the task.]
[Cernan - &q] e had done some cross-training on the deployment, but we specialized in certain things; like I in the drill, and Jack in the ALSEP deployment.  But, because we trained together on them, I think I could have deployed the ALSEP, just like he could have handled the drill or even the Rover for that matter.  I sort of got into the systems maybe a little bit more than he did, and he got in the ALSEP a little bit more than I did, but I wouldn't have had any problems, nor would he. It would have taken a little longer, maybe; but we could have gotten the job done.&quot;]
[LMP: - &] As I remember it, we did a little bit of cross-training, but mostly for the case that one of the PLSSs wouldn't work and we had to do a one-man EVA.  Actually, I don't know if they would have allowed a one-man EVA.  NASA was pretty conservative by this time.  As another example of that conservatism is that, if we had started planning early enough, we could have had consumables enough to stay on the Moon for four days with some reserves.  But they wouldn't let us plan for it.  There would have been trade-offs.  In order to meet the margins, you probably wouldn't have been able to take some of the equipment, but you could have done it.&quot;]
[&quot;I rem]  that right after Bill Anders replaced Mike Collins on Apollo 8, probably in August '68, Alan Shepard - who was head of the Astronaut Office at that time - assigned  Aldrin and myself to pull together a briefing for the President's Science Advisory Committee: Charlie Towns' committee.  They had been asked to be briefed on NASA's plans for the first lunar landing mission.  The trouble was that nobody had put together a plan since the time when the Design Reference Mission was defined prior to the RFPs  being issued for the lunar module.  But by '68 we had to get realistic.  So I pulled together the timeline - working with a small group of people - for what eventually became Apollo 12.  And it was in that process - in defining the first mission with an ALSEP deployment - that we realized that the chances of a first mission having more than one EVA and having weight margins to carry the ALSEP with confidence had very remote possibilities.  That's when I first raised the issue of designing a smaller ALSEP - called EASEP  - that included only a seismometer and a corner reflector.  That was what eventually flew on Apollo 11; and that was put together in a hurry.  When we briefed the PSAC, some of our viewgraphs indicated that we didn't think that the mission we'd put together could be the first lunar landing mission because of these problems.  On the first mission you probably wanted all the weight margins you could get, and, at the time, it seemed as though the weight of the LM was growing and we realized that the 300 lb ALSEP was going to be a lot easier to kick off than a 100 lb alternative.  Also, it was the first time anybody had put together a lunar-surface timeline, and we had to consider things like one-man versus two-man EVAs because they were still talking about doing umbilical EVAs rather than PLSS EVAs.  Deke  was very helpful in that he put his foot down and said Flight Crew Operations Directorate demanded a two-man EVA, and said that we weren't going to be constrained by umbilicals because they were too dangerous.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

Sometimes, although not very often, they just couldn't come to a decision fast enough.  It was tough to do.  You've got two guys hopping around on the Moon making their own decisions and, to make a recommendation about which film pack to use, you've got to talk to the people who can give you an informed answer; and that takes time.  The way that people worked in and with the Control Room is an important part of the story.  We knew that these conversations were going on back in Houston because we'd been in the control room or the science support room on other missions; but, of course, we couldn't hear - and wouldn't have had time to hear - what was going on.&quot;]

He has cables inside his suit that are fixed at the center of his chest, run laterally across to his arm pits and then up, over the outside of his shoulders through tubes and, finally, are attached at the center of his back. Friction of the cables in the tubes help him keep his arm in any position he chooses without effort and in order to reach the cooling control on the bottom of his PLSS, Gene has to move his right arm forward and then back, twice, in a vertical plane to overcome the cable friction before he can reach the diverter valve.

[Cernan - &q] he suits were very integral machines.  We had arm bearings and elbow joints and wrist joints in the Apollo suits.  But we have yet to be able to devise a suit where you incorporate everything from the fingers, to the fists, to the hand, to the wrists, to the elbow, to the shoulder in one motion.  Unencumbered by a suit, we can move our arms in any direction using a combination of simultaneous joint movements.  To reach for something on a desk behind you, you twist in your chair, turn your head, and move most of the joints in your shoulder and your arm; and you do all those things at once.  In a suit you can eventually position your arm or your hand almost any way you want but you're limited to maybe two movements at a time.  You can't just incorporate a rotation, an extension, and an arm-bearing movement all at one time.  You have to do one or two of those actions, and then do the others.

[04:22:04:14] CDR: You don't suppose this is why we didn't have much dust from the LM, do you?
[04:22:04:18] LMP: I think it is.  .
[04:22:04:20] CDR:  I saw all the way to the ground during landing.
[04:22:04:23] LMP: Yeah.
<blockquote>] ene is referring to the apparent compactness of the soil as a possible explanation of why they didn't seem to kick up much dust during the landing.  From the descriptions provided by the various crews during their post-mission technical debriefings, the 14 and 17 crews experienced the smallest amount of dust obscuration and the 12 and 15 crews experienced the most.]
[Armstrong, ] the 31 July 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;I first noticed that we were, in fact, disturbing the dust on the surface when we were at something less than 100 feet; we were beginning to get a transparent sheet of moving dust that obscured visibility a little bit.  As we got lower, the visibility continued to decrease.  I don't think that the altitude determination was severely hurt by this blowing dust, but the thing that was confusing to me was that it was hard to pick out what your lateral and downrange velocities were, because you were seeing a lot of moving dust that you had to look through to pick up the stationary rocks and base your translational velocity decisions on that.  I found that to be quite difficult.  I spent more time trying to arrest translational velocities than I thought would be necessary.  As we got below 30 feet or so, I had to select the final touchdown area.  For some reason that I am not sure of, we started to pick up left translational velocity and a backward velocity.  That's the thing that I certainly didn't want to do, because you don't like to be going backwards, unable to see where you're going.  So I arrested the backward rate with some possibly spastic control motions, but I was unable to stop the left translational rate.  As we approached the ground, I still had a left translational rate which made me reluctant to shut
the engine o] ile I still had that rate.&quot;]
[Conrad, fro]  1 December 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;As soon as I got the vehicle stopped in horizontal velocity at 300 feet, we picked up a tremendous amount of dust; much more than I had expected.  I could see the boulders through the dust, but the dust went as far as I could see in any direction and completely obliterated craters and anything else.  All I knew was there was ground underneath that dust.  I had no problem with the dust determining horizontal or lateral velocities, but I couldn't tell what was underneath me.  I knew I was in a generally good area and that I was just going to have to bite the bullet and land, because I couldn't tell whether there was a crater down there or not... , the dust was bad enough and I could obtain absolutely no attitude reference by looking at the horizon and the LM.  I had to use the 8-ball.  I had attitude excursions in pitch of plus 10 and minus 10 , which happened while I was looking out the window making sure that the lateral and horizontal velocities were still nulled. I would allow the attitude of the vehicle to change by plus or minus 10 degrees in pitch and not be aware of it, and I had to go back in the cockpit and keep releveling the attitude of the vehicle on the 8-ball. I was on the gauges in the cockpit doing that at the time the Lunar Contact light came on.  I had that much confidence in the gauges.&quot;]
[Shepard, fr] e 17 February 1971 Technical Debrief - &quot;I believe that we had less problems with dust then they've had before.  I think it's because, as we comment later on , the surface of the general area in which we landed was less dusty - that is, exclusive of the dust around the rims of craters.  The general area appeared to have less dust and we certainly had no problem with dust at touchdown...The dust was obvious, but you could also see the rocks through the dust.  We had no problems here.&quot;]
[Mitchell, f] he 17 February 1971 Technical Debrief - &quot;I might add that, looking at the film of the descent last night, the dust problem appears a lot worse on the film than it appeared to me out the window.  I thought I could see it  a lot better.&quot;]
[Shepard, fr] e 17 February 1971 Technical Debrief - &quot;You probably would, in any event, because the camera is only looking at one spot and you don't have the more general feeling that your eyeball gives you.&quot;]
[Mitchell, f] he 17 February 1971 Technical Debrief - &quot;Right; but just looking out the window, you can see the dust is not a great problem at all.&quot;]
[Scott, from] 14 August 1971 Technical Debrief - &quot; I could see dust - just a slight bit of dust.  At about 50 to 60 feet, the total view outside was obscured by dust.  It was completely IFR .  I came into the cockpit and flew with the instruments from there on down...I think if you had to move from one point to another, you could do it quite well. I would recommend maintaining an altitude of at least 150 feet so you don't get into the dust problem.  I think dust is going to be variable with landing site.&quot;]
[Young, from] 5 April 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;From 200 feet on down, I never looked in the cockpit.  It was just like flying the LLTV ;  your reference is to the ground outside.  You had another thing that nobody has ever remarked about before, and that was the  shadow.  I really didn't have any doubt in my mind how far above the ground we were with that shadow, coming down.  I had no scale of reference to the holes; but, with the shadow out there in front of you and coming down, it really takes all the guesswork out of it.  For that kind of Sun angle, if the radar had crumped , I don't think you'd have had a bit of trouble in just going right in and landing just like a helicopter.  First, we could see the thing all the way to the ground; second, the shadow was right there to help you out with the rate of descent. When Charlie says  'you stopped and you're hovering', there wasn't any doubt in my mind that I was hovering.  I could look out the window and see that we're hovering just like a helicopter.  We were well into the dust - maybe 40 or 50 feet off the ground - when we're doing that.&quot;]
[Duke, from ]  April 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;It started at about 80 feet, John.&quot;]
[Young, from] 5 April 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;Yes, 80 feet.  Certainly, it started there and it got a lot worse; but you could still see the rocks all the way to the ground.   the surface features, even the craters, and with something like that...Which really surprised me.  I was expecting two things: either the dust would be so bad we couldn't see anything, or there probably wouldn't be as much dust as there was.  Possibly, it's the 15-degree Sun angle that did all that.  Because there's certainly plenty of dust down there to blow; and there's nothing thin about the regolith around the LM.&quot;]
[Cernan, fro]  4 January 1973 Technical Debrief - &quot;We started to get dust somewhere around 100 feet.&quot;]
[LMP:, fr] e 4 January 1973 Technical Debrief - &quot;In my window, I didn't see dust until about 60 or 70 feet.&quot;]
[Cernan, fro]  4 January 1973 Technical Debrief - &quot;The dust layer was so very thin that I could definitely see through it all the way down.  It didn't hamper our operations at all.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

In this case, Jack has used one of the &quot;Dixie cup&quot; sample bags described in greater detail at 141:23:00, probably having taken one off of the stack stowed on the geopallet.

<blockquote>] ernan - &quot;I used the drill as a cane so that I didn't have to get all the way down on my knees.  Without it, the only way you could get something off the ground was to get down on your knees because you couldn't bend over.  But, if you had a short cane like the drill - the drill was probably 12 or 18 inches high -  you could lean on it and then reach over with the other hand to pick things up.  It's hard for people to understand the kind of problems you had getting up and down, reaching down to pick things up from the ground.  On Earth, we take for granted our mobility and our motion capability.  Plus we take for granted the full force of gravity.  In lunar gravity, when you were leaning on the drill, you don't lose your balance as quickly as you would on Earth, so that was an advantage.  But, when you're being held down by Earth gravity,  you can handle a lot more torque than you can being held down by one-sixth gravity.  It's those kinds of things that made this a difficult task.  It was just very difficult to flex that stiff suit.&quot;]  
[Gene tries ] -position the drill, but it falls over.]</i></blockquote>
[04:22:09:45] CDR: Except when you let it fall down.

<blockquote>] ene unwraps the lower section of the probe.]
[Cernan - &q] emember, this was a disturbed surface, a very beat up area.  There were footprints all over.  And it was basically all one bland color.  I had just drilled the hole a couple of inches in diameter, I'd gone four or five feet away, had come back, and then had to find the hole.  If I hadn't left something close to the hole, so I'd know where to look, it probably would have been very difficult to find.  You were looking across the entrance to that hole, and you were still looking at the same color in the wall of the hole.  The low Sun would give you a shadow close to the top, but you wouldn't have seen that unless you were almost on top of the hole.  And I'd drilled the hole in a hummocky crater, a little depression, that had some slopes on it.  So, I was afraid of going back and not finding that hole to put the experiment into.&quot;]
[LMP: - &] I'm still amazed that, after everything we did around that hole, that it was still open and that Gene was able to find it.  The ground had really gotten chewed up and, by all rights, the hole should have fallen in, at least near the surface.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

[04:22:11:10] xCC: I don't.    John  doesn't, either.
<blockquote>] his time, Gene gives the rammer a little inward motion, flipping it upward with the probe in his right hand.  This time, the T-shaped head of the rammer hooks on the probe tip and he catches it with his left hand.  He then hangs the rammer on the rack  and activates the lower section of the probe.  In brief, the neutron probe consists of targets containing either boron or uranium-235 which, upon capturing neutrons, emit alpha particles or fission fragments which are then captured by plastic or mica detectors.  The instrument consists of an outer tube containing the detectors and a central core containing the targets.  Because the targets and detectors do not cover the whole surfaces of the core and tube, respectively, the core can be twisted so that the target/detector pairs are either next to each other or 180 degrees apart.  In the latter case, very few alpha particles or fission fragments are captured by the detectors and, therefore, the instrument is &quot;off&quot;.]</i></blockquote>

[04:22:11:19] LMP: Bob, I see no clear alignment of plagioclase or pyroxene in this rock.  That's the one with the parting in it.  It looks as if - integrating what I've seen here and over at the big rock, the geophone rock - the layering or the foliation or the parting, whichever it is, is the result of variations in vesicle concentrations.  The sample 10 Echo is a sample of the more coarsely vesicular rock.  I could not get one of the more finely or non-vesicular fragments.  But I got pictures of it.
<blockquote>] chmitt - &quot;An alignment of elongated minerals such as plagioclase or pyroxene is called a lineation, and generally indicates that there has been a flow or some stress in the direction of alignment.  The term 'foliation' is usually reserved for a situation where the orientation of tabular minerals creates a planar variation in the rock.  A 'parting' indicates how the rock breaks, usually along foliation planes.&quot;]

<blockquote>] chmitt - &quot;In molten rock, vesicles usually start out being roughly spherical in shape but, once the rock has solidified, if it stays warm for long enough, there will be a tendency for crystals to grow and destroy the smoothly spherical outline.

It was a lot of work, probably more work than people anticipated because we ran into problems in getting the core out, but we got it all done.&quot;]
[LMP: - &] I was not quite so satisfied as Gene was at this point because of the time we were losing for exploration.  The difference was natural.

Indeed, from overhead photography, it appeared in pre-mission analyses that only part of the crater is covered with the mantle.

In addition, there were indications that the crater might have penetrated through the valley fill and dug up samples of the original valley floor, materials presumably similar to those making up the Massifs.  However, evidence from the seismic profiling experiment and from the Command Module radar experiment suggest that the valley fill is about two kilometers deep.  Because Emory would have penetrated only to a depth of about 150 to 200 meters, the possibility that Emory penetrated through the valley fill now seems unlikely.]</i></blockquote>

During the last minute or so, Gene maneuvered the Rover until the shadow gave a zero reading.

The three-digit range indicator changes from 001 to 002 at a range of 150 meters and the distance indicator changes to 002 at 200 meters.  The formal indication is, then, that the LM is between 200 and 250 meters from the ALSEP.  Because Gene has not driven in a straight line, the distance reading should be reduced by about ten percent.  The actual range of the LM from the ALSEP is about 185 meters.  Because Gene had parked the Rover 60 feet  northeast of the Central Station, the Rover-LM distance was about 180 meters, which agrees nicely with the 180 - 250 meter range indicated by the Nav system.]</i></blockquote>

[04:22:46:27] CDR: Hey, Bob, making 8 to 10 kilometers , and I'm barely moving.
<blockquote>] he terrain around the LM is rather flat and a speed of 10 km/hr - about 10 minutes to the mile - doesn't seem impressive.  However, when they get out into rolling terrain, with the potential of finding small, deep craters to jar the Rover just over every ridge, the ride gets a bit more exciting.]
[Cernan - &q] he Rover just didn't move very fast.  It wasn't made to go very fast, but it could sure save a lot of energy.  You could pack a lot of gear and save a lot of walking time, and it allowed us to cover territory and ground we never would have covered otherwise.  I think probably we averaged 8-12 kilometers , and I think we hit a speed record of 14-15 kilometers coming downhill.  It had four electric motors, one on each wheel for redundancy, and we would run with all four motors all the time.  We didn't necessarily use both fore and aft steering all the time, but we always ran all four motors and 8-12 kilometers was about as fast as it could go.  Your sensation of speed is probably what you would get down here.  It didn't seem like you were moving very fast, and you really weren't.  But you were moving, and it was nice to just sit back there and relax as you went from one place to another, as slow as it might seem.  We weren't on a 400 mile trip, so it didn't matter how fast it was.&quot;]
[&quot;Of co]  it could still be very sporty driving.  When you start getting one wheel in a crater, or you hit a bump, or you start driving on the side of a hill, you really do appreciate the one-sixth gravity.  If you hit a bump, you'd go u-u-u-u-p and come down.  It wouldn't just be bing-bang, up and down.  And on the side of a hill, you would start thinking that the Rover was just going to tip over and fall over on you.  You didn't feel like there's much holding you to the surface at all.  It was good, sporty driving; just not very fast.&quot;]
[&quot;The R] had great maneuverability, particularly with the fore and aft steering -  articulated steering, I guess it is.  You could really maneuver it, really turn very sharp.  You couldn't go real fast, but you could go.  There is some film of John Young where he was kicking up dust and you'd think he was going 50 mph.  He probably was going 10-12 kilometers at the most.  On the lunar surface, it's a sporty little ride.  It was fun.&quot;]
[&quot;I don] ow how fast you would really want to go up there, quite frankly.  You can't see what's up ahead of you too well.  You know, you're driving along and it's so bland. With the shadows the way they are, especially if you're looking into the Sun, you just can't see much.  You can't see where those holes are; you can't see what's ahead of you, and the next thing you know, wow, you're in a hole or you're up.  You'll see us reacting to the little craters throughout here as we drive the Rover.&quot;]
[LMP: - &] I'm quite certain that, even at 10 kilometers per hour, there were times when we had all four wheels off the ground.  That really made it sporty.  And the worst direction to drive in, I thought, was away from the Sun, because you had a 'white out' situation.  The lack of shadows made it hard even to see boulders.  But, the glare off your visors did make up-Sun difficult.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

[04:22:48:36] CDR: Okay.  Do you know which side of Steno he wants us to go, Jack?
[04:22:48:39] LMP: Not yet.
[04:22:48:40] xCC: Okay, let me fill you in on the plan, guys.  We're going to go to the west side of Steno, which is where you would have driven by anyway, and the stop will be at the 340/1.2, which is where you've got the little Delta for EP 6, in your checklist.  And we will plan on spending about three-zero minutes there sampling, primarily boulders.
<blockquote>]  map of the planned traverse is shown  on both LMP-28 and CDR-26.  South is up, on these maps, and the unboxed numbers associated with each traverse segment are a heading and segment length.  The boxed numbers associated with the turning points are bearing and range to the nominal SEP transmitter location.  Because the navigation system gives the Rover's position relative to the initialization point at the SEP transmitter - then, to the extent that the absolute location of the SEP is known, the heading and range indications can be used to find the planned geology stations.  With practice and a good map, visual navigation is sometimes possible, but the undulating terrain, combined with the basic problem of estimating sizes and distances, makes the navigation instruments invaluable.  At this point in the mission, the location of the LM and, therefore, of the SEP transmitter has not yet been pinned down and there will be some confusion.  Based on the crew's site descriptions from the LM window, Houston is estimating that, at the west rim of Steno, the bearing to the SEP transmitter will be 340 degrees  and the range 1.2 kilometers.  Relative to the actual SEP location, the bearing and range at the west rim of Steno is 352/1.5.  Because of this fairly substantial difference, they will end up stopping just short of the northwest rim.  Boulders are of interest since they are likely to be samples of the subfloor.  Boulders that could be picked out in the Apollo 15 photographs are marked with crosses.  Checklist pages LMP-29 and CDR-27 give details of the planned traverse.  Pages LMP-30 and CDR-28 are identical and show a schematic of Emory Crater and the original site of Station 1.]</i></blockquote>

[04:22:52:20] CDR: Got it, got it, got it .    Boy, I tell you; I've got to get out  east.  Stand by.
<blockquote>] ernan - &quot;We probably ran smack into a small crater - or maybe a boulder - that we couldn't see facing east and looking right into the Sun.  And when I said, 'got it, got it' I meant I had the situation under control.  Running into little craters or over little rocks wasn't critical; it was just that we didn't want to run into something big enough to matter.  Here, we probably went down in a little crater and came back up.  We did that a lot; but we got a little more excited here because this is our first real ride together on this thing.  The burst of static probably indicates that I made a turn to try to avoid the crater and lost the low-gain lock.&quot;]
[&quot;There] three things that I remember most about the Rover ride.  Number one, when you were driving east into the Sun, it was almost impossible to see things ahead of you.  When you were driving cross-Sun you had much better visibility and depth perception because of the shadows; and even driving down-Sun you could certainly see the boulders.  Second was the fact that you often couldn't see small craters and they were important in the same way that potholes are to you when you're driving down the highway.  The difference is that, in one-sixth gravity, when you do hit a boulder or you do drop one wheel in a small crater, you literally lift the Rover off the ground.  I mean, you were literally driving on three wheels a good part of the time.  It wasn't a choppy, sports-car feel,  driving down the highway going bang-bang, bang.  It was more of a waltz.  Boom, and you go u-u-up and come down.  Hit another one; u-u-up and come down.  And, of course, not only did the Rover bounce but so did we.  So it was a very good thing that we had snug seatbelts.  Without them, we could easily have bounced out of the seats.  And, lastly, the reduced gravity was particularly noticeable when you were driving on the side of a hill.  I remember many times when we were driving on the side of a hill and Jack commenting that we were going to roll over.  And indeed, because you have less gravity holding you down on the Moon, that was not a false perception; it was fact.  You had to be careful on the side of a hill, because if you hit a bump with an uphill wheel, you could lift the thing off the ground and possibly become unstable and tip over.  Of course, the situation was more obvious if you were in the downhill seat and I tried to keep Jack on the downside. It was much more comfortable on the uphill side; and that's a commander's prerogative when he's driving the Rover.&quot;]
[&quot;Those]  the three things that were most noticeable; and I don't know that it would have been advantageous to have had a Rover that could have gone any faster.  You needed to be careful in driving and probably couldn't have used the additional capability.  When we set a speed record of somewhere around 14 or 15 km/hr coming down a hill, we were really hauling the metal; we were really tearing.  And, not being able to see all that well ahead,  I don't think we would have wanted to come down much faster. Of course, we were traveling over uncharted terrain; and, if we'd been at an established lunar base with a yellow stripe down the middle of a 'paved' surface - or, at least, if we'd been on a surveyed path with no boulders or potholes in the way - then we could have driven comfortably at a lot higher speed.  But if we'd hit a boulder at 10 km/hr and smashed the hell out of the front end of the Rover, we'd have been out of business.  We could have gotten back to the LM, but we wouldn't have gotten the job done that we'd gone to the Moon to do.&quot;]

<blockquote>] chmitt - &quot;The basic use of the photographs was supposed to have been the location of observations, although nobody's ever done very much of that analysis.  I think, also, that these traverse photos were added as a response to the problem that the Apollo 16  crew had in knowing where they were, at least on their first traverse.  And, finally, if you weren't doing anything else but riding, you might as well take pictures and get more information and documentation.  There was plenty of film.  And some of that information proved to be very useful.  The pictures I took when we were driving on the avalanche during the second EVA helped confirm my observation that there weren't many boulders on the surface, as you would expect if it had been a gas-lubricated avalanche.&quot;]
[Journal Con] tor David Harland notes that the practice of having the LMP take traverse pictures started with Apollo 16 as a result of the Apollo 15 experience.  Readers should note that the pictures don't help the crew in knowing where they are, of course, because the pictures are developed post-flight in Houston.  However, the pictures do help the geology team figure out where the crew went and, thus, tie verbal descriptions of features along the traverse route to the high-resolution pictures taken with the pan camera in the SIM Bay of the CSM.]

<blockquote>] ernan - &quot;In looking at some of the pictures that Jack took on the way back to the LM, it's really obvious how difficult it was to know where you were in that three-dimensional environment.  You could get up on high spots and orient yourself; and you always knew where you were in the valley - where you were in the 'big picture' - and where you were in relation to the LM.  But the Rover Nav system really allowed you to go where you wanted to go fairly precisely.  Getting back to the LM would have been easy enough without the Nav system.  You could follow the Rover tracks back and, if that wasn't the most direct route, you could still get close enough to see the LM.  There certainly weren't many things you could mistake for the LM.  It was the only thing around that really reflected sunlight; it was also pretty big  and would have been hard to miss.  But in finding a particular crater when, as I say, you were 'down among them', the Nav system really helped.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

It probably didn't stay.&quot; is clearly agreement with Jack's hypothesis that they've lost the temporary fender.

Jack's photo of Gene parked at the SEP site after initializing the LRV Nav system at the start of EVA-2, AS17-135-20544, allows us to use the known length of the Rover - 3.0 meters - to calculate that the top of Gene's helmet is about 1.8 meters off the ground.  With the Sun at an elevation of 18 degrees, Gene's shadow is 5.5 meters long, which is long enough for both of them to see it by turning their heads to the left inside the helmets.]</i></blockquote>

[The third l] f CDR-32 calls for Gene to position the Rover so that he is pointing east.  After initializing the Nav system, he is to drive east for 100 meters; then turn right to a heading of 210 and drive another 100 meters; and, finally, turn right to a heading of 360 for a drive of 200 meters north.  This procedure would produce a cross of Rover tracks intersecting about 50 meters east of the SEP transmitter.  Then, once Gene has the pattern laid out, Jack will carry the transmitter over to the intersection.]
[Cernan - &q] e came up with this during training; the Rover heading indicator let us get a very accurate layout.&quot;]
[Gene's stat]  that he is rolling west is open to several contradictory interpretations.  One is that he has misspoken and means &quot;east&quot; rather than &quot;west&quot;.  A second interpretation is that Gene is going to lay out the pattern west of the transmitter, rather then east of it.  A third interpretation is simply that he is going west of the transmitter before coming back alongside it, headed east, to let Jack off.  I prefer the last of these.]</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>] he SRC seal consists of a knife-edge closure on the rim of the lower section of the box which, when the SRC is closed, digs into a soft, indium strip set in the lid.  When the box was packed in Houston, a protective cover made of Teflon cloth was fitted into the box.  The cover was fitted on a wire frame that would just barely fit into the box and, therefore, would stay put.  The cover had a large opening in the middle to give Gene access to the interior of the box and flaps on all four sides which, at the beginning of the EVA, Gene unfolded and laid on top of the knife edge and the indium strip so that they would stay reasonably clean.  Gene is removing that cover and, as well, a Teflon spacer which was installed in Houston to keep the knife edge from cutting into the indium strip prior to this final sealing of the box.  Once he removes the cover - called the &quot;skirt&quot; on cuff checklist page CDR-35 - and the spacer, Gene makes a final check to make sure that none of the sample bags will catch in the seal when he closes the lid.  On some of the prior missions, bags that caught in the seal created leaks and, when the samples were examined in Houston, they were found to be contaminated with cabin and/or terrestrial gases.]</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>] vidently, some of the interior voids in the Styrofoam were still filled with gas, despite many days of exposure to vacuum during the trip out from Earth.  Alternatively, the voids may have been filling with gases released from the foam matrix during the six hours or so that it has been lying out in the sunlight.  In either case, solar heating has raised the pressure of the trapped gases.  The fact that several fragments can be seen - coupled with Gene's use of the word &quot;exploded&quot; and John Young's phrase &quot;blew up&quot; - indicates an explosive disintegration of a piece of foam.  Such explosions would propel fragments over considerable distances.  For example, if a piece was launched at a 45 degree angle at a speed of 15.6 meters per second, it would come down 150 meters from the LM after a 13.6 second flight.  It is also possible that the piece Gene picked up at the SEP site got there in several hops, each the result of a separate explosion or of a non-explosive venting episode.]</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>] n the early  missions, the Lunar Equipment Conveyor  was a clothesline-like device used to transfer equipment up to the cabin.  Using it was a two-man operation.  Beginning with Apollo 14, the astronauts carried at least some equipment up the ladder by hand.  Finally, the Apollo 16 crew decided that the clothesline LEC was more trouble than it was worth and carried everything but the ETB up by hand.  To raise and lower the ETB, they used a simple hook-and-lanyard, but kept the LEC designation.  Gene is using the lanyard-type LEC.]
[LMP: - &] We used the lanyard to raise and lower the ETB because it had delicate equipment in it, particularly the cameras.  It wasn't a rigid bag and, while I don't remember how or when the decision was made, I think we decided that, rather, than sling the ETB around, we'd just hoist it up.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

[LMP: - &] As Gene handed the stuff in, I probably put it back on the engine cover, although I may have stowed the SRC right away.  There were special compartments for each of the SRCs and the SCBs but we may not have stowed those until after we were repressurized.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
[05:01:04:05] CDR: Okay, and here come the core tubes.    Boy, let's protect that core tube.  Man, that was the turning point today.  
<blockquote>] ernan - &quot;Once the deep core was finished it really was a turning point.  While we were deploying the ALSEP, we had a fixed set of tasks to do; and removing that core was probably the hardest of them.  But after it was finished, then we could settle back into an exploratory mode of operations with a lot more control and choice about what we did.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
[05:01:04:01] CDR: Got it?
[05:01:04:22] LMP: Got it.    Yeah, we had a lot of turning points.
<blockquote>] chmitt - &quot;From my point of view, the big turning point of the mission didn't come until we'd finished the second EVA.  From an operational point of view, which was Gene's perspective, getting the core extracted and the rest of the ALSEP deployed was a major accomplishment; drilling those holes and extracting the core was tough work.  But I was frustrated that we were still in the position that, if we had to leave the Moon before we had done another EVA, we wouldn't have had much information about the site.  We'd gotten the heat flow experiment deployed so we were going to get confirmation of the Apollo 15 measurement.  We had a few samples of the basalt, but had done no systematic sampling.  We had the soil in the core, so we probably would have found the black beads; but there's not a lot of orange soil in that valley - it's mostly black - so we might not have had enough orange beads in the core to recognize it's importance.  We had put out two seismic charges which, by themselves wouldn't have given us much.  We had a few gravimeter readings but no profile across the valley and not enough information to understand the depth of the basalt fill.   And, although we didn't know it at this point, the major experiment on the ALSEP, the long-period gravimeter , wasn't going to work.  So, at the end of the first EVA, we were in the scientifically vulnerable position of having gone all the way to the Moon without having gotten very much out of the mission relative to what the potential was.  By the time we finished the second EVA, we had a lot of information about the site and, from a scientific point of view, that was the big turning point of the mission.  By the end of the second EVA, we had at least half a gravity profile because we'd gone across one contact up onto the South Massif; we had several more seismic charges deployed; and we had done a lot of systematic sampling of the mare basalts, the massif breccias, and the soils.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

[05:01:04:32] xCC: Negative, you can leave the LEC outside.
[05:01:04:37] LMP:   No, just the bag .

[05:01:04:40] LMP: They're in the bag.
[05:01:04:41] CDR: Okay.  I hope they don't come out this time.
[05:01:04:43] LMP: Well, I stuck them down in there.  I hope they don't.
[05:01:04:46] xCC: Yeah, Jack...

[05:01:05:09] xCC: Okay, Gene.  And you got the SCB number 2 in and the pallet out, right?
[05:01:05:17] LMP: Right.  
[05:01:05:25] CDR: Here it comes, Jack.    Take that?    There are no scissors on the ground beneath where the ETB was.  So I would say that they're probably in the ETB.

Gene may have had more trouble getting in than I did, simply because he is a longer person, even though, for the same reason, he didn't have as much trouble getting his back arched.  Certainly he was tired - we both were - and it was only prudent for me to help him.  You didn't want to bang that DSKY any more than you absolutely had to.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

[05:03:15:34] Slayton: It's 3 o'clock in the morning up there, too!
[05:03:15:41] CDR: Yeah,  and we know that too.
[05:03:15:46] Allen: Troops, while you're in a listening mood up there, we're going to be coming at you with a number of items here - not too many -, but the first will be some surface block data.  Then we're going to read up to you a LEVA  cleaning procedure which is fairly simple; a real short geology debrief; a one-line change in the Lunar Surface Checklist.  And then, we've been doing some thinking down here about how to fix the fender.  And it's going to involve - we think, although we'll work on it while you guys are getting some rest - it's going to involve using utility clamps, from inside your LM there, instead of tape, to fasten some sort of stiff material onto the Rover in place of the missing fender.  And we'll go with either with one of your cue cards, or possibly with part of insulation that was the flame blanket protecting the Rover during the landing.  Or perhaps part of the packing material that was between the Rover wheels and is probably lying on the ground underneath the LM there.
[05:03:17:07] CDR: Joe, you couldn't be reading our mind more.  We were talking about that, and there is a piece of it right outside my window.  I saw it after we got in here.  Either that or back of a part of a data book or something.  I hate like the devil to tear one of those other fenders off.  And the reason tape won't stick is that everything's got a fine coating of dust, and the only way I could finally get it to stick was to put tape on it  rip the tape off - or take the tape off - which took some of the dust off and then  tape would tend to hold it.  But it just won't hack it up here.
[05:03:17:39] Allen: Roger, Gene.  That's exactly what we're thinking .  And what we're going to do is run through the fix in a pressure suit a few hours from now.  And if it looks like we can do it, and it won't cost you many more than say 10 minutes, we're going to have you go through with it.  If it takes longer than that, we're going to go back to the drawing board and see what else we can do here.
[05:03:18:08] CDR: Well, you know John  and Charlie  can tell you just how bad it is.  I wouldn't have believed it and I guess I didn't believe it, or I would have worked a little harder to make sure that fender was going to stay on.  But, man, just that short trip back from where we lost it, and we were just covered.  The whole...I couldn't even read parts of the panel on the Rover, plus  all the battery covers and everything.
<blockquote>] ernan - &quot;It was just an unacceptable situation.  Imagine, a little thing like knocking a Rover fender off having the potential of compromising the rest of our mission.  I still have no doubt that we had to find a fix.  If we hadn't, then at bare minimum it probably would have taken thirty to forty percent of our time to consciously keep the dust off of the Rover, the tools, and the rest of the equipment.  We wouldn't have been able to drive as fast, we would have had to spend a lot more time dusting.&quot;]
	[&quot;I w] ncerned in the sense that I knew that we had to find a fix; but I was also confident that we'd find one.  I knew that the ground was going to be working on a fix, but I was also responsible for the mission on our end and I was going to think about the problem, too.  I'm the guy on the scene; I'm the guy who's got to actually fix the fender.  The help we got from the ground was tremendous.  They knew exactly what we had in the LM and were able to try out things during the night.  But they were a quarter million miles away and I was going to have to do the fixing.  So I spent some time, including while I was lying in the hammock, thinking the problem through.&quot;]
	[&quot;Bef] he mission, probably no one could have believed that losing a fender could have been that serious.  But, if that had been an unmanned vehicle, dependent on the radiator for cooling and a clean TV lens for scientific exploration, you might have been out of business.  Of course, maybe you could say that if we hadn't been there, it wouldn't have gotten knocked off; but even an unmanned vehicle can lose a fender by going too close to a rock or something.&quot;]
	[LMP: -] t;As I recall, my perspective on the fender was that it wasn't a big deal; primarily because I had worked those kind of problems between EVAs on other missions.  As Gene implies here, there are an infinite number of things that you can do to fix a problem; and that was the tradition of the whole ground support effort.  You've got a problem?  You go work on it and you fix it.  And, so, I wasn't going to worry about it.  I never imagined that they weren't going to come up with a solution.  The only thing that bothered me - and I do remember thinking about this - was that the fix was going to eat up time out of the second EVA.  As you may have noticed, Gene talked about the fender frequently but I never even responded to him, being busy with other things.  So, obviously, it wasn't a big concern in my mind.&quot;]
[Dave Ballar] vides the following account of what has been going on in Houston to come up with a fix. &quot;It was Terry Neal from the Apollo 17 Flight Crew Support Team who put together the scheme and the procedures to rig the fix for the rover fender. I was the A17 Flight Crew Support Team leader and had no direct role in that effort. Our team guys needed no direction or supervision in these type of activities - they knew what was needed and did
it!&quot;]  ] 
[&quot;It ju]  happens Terry and I were chuckling over this old war story at John Young's JSC retirement party this past December . What happened -in summary - was that Terry went right over to the JSC rover and luner module mock-up because it was obvious a fix was necessary.  Since Terry was the A17 Luner Module Crew System's Engineer, there was no one more knowledgable or
capable of u] tanding what was at hand on board the spacecraft to be utilized for the repair.  Using the fully stowed mockup's equipment, Terry developed the scheme using  - and I may not be completely acurrate on each piece - some combination of clamps, tape, flight data file covers,etc.   He passed the procedures over to the EVA procedures guys and they worked a suited-crewman exercise with John Young for verification. Then the procedure was sent up to the crew and the rest is history.&quot;]
[&quot;Howev] ere's the rest of the story: Post flight, John  got a big NASA award for this effort - no mention of Terry Neal! This was a common thing - nobody took it very serious. To this day, every time John Young sees Terry Neal, he says, as only John can, 'I'm going to get you an award, Terry'.  Thirty some odd years later John still remembers and respects the person who did the real work.&quot;]

[05:03:18:35] Allen: Roger, Gene.  What we really need, I think, is some white mud flaps up there.

[05:03:20:06] Allen: We're watching.
<blockquote>] chmitt - &quot;The second charge procedure probably came out of people trying to push as much time into an EVA as possible for the J-missions.  Probably somebody did a little experiment and realized that they could get another half-hour's worth or something like that.  The whole J-mission or Block 2 effort was to extend capabilities over what had been possible on Apollo 11 and the other H-missions.   Apollo 15 had originally been scheduled as an H-mission and Scott worked very hard to fly a Block 2 LM.&quot;]
	[In 1967, ] drew up a list of mission-types which would lead up to the first landing.  &quot;A&quot; missions were unmanned, earth-orbital tests of the Saturn V and the Command-and-Service Module.  &quot;B&quot; missions were unmanned, orbital tests of the LM.  &quot;C&quot; missions were manned, earth-orbital tests of the CSM.  Apollo 7 was a C mission.  And the added Apollo 8 lunar orbit flight became a C-Prime mission.  &quot;D&quot; missions were earth-orbital tests of the CSM/LM combination .  &quot;E&quot; missions were to have been CSM/LM missions to high-earth orbit and none of these were ever flown.  &quot;F&quot; missions were full dress rehearsals in lunar orbit .  The &quot;G&quot; mission  was the initial landing; and &quot;H&quot; missions were follow-on landing missions.  By 1969, NASA was hard at work on significant LM upgrades which would allow three-day stays on the Moon supported by a Roving vehicle.  These became the &quot;J&quot; missions.  &quot;I&quot; missions were lunar-orbit-only science missions, none of which were ever flown.]</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>] ob sounds congested and tired.]</i></blockquote>
[05:03:26:07] LMP: Well, we're both listening.  We can answer them.
[05:03:26:10] xCC: Okay, the way you asked that, I wasn't sure.    Okay.  Question number 1 concerns the Rover mobility rates.  The Rover mobility rates over the short span you drove, which is hardly representative, are slower than people had anticipated.  Do you think this is due to visibility, terrain, or what?  Do you think you can still hack a 7.3 or 8-kilometer  average to Station 2 tomorrow?
[05:03:26:39] CDR: The answer to that is &quot;yes&quot;, Bob.  I think it's partly fam, but it's also the fact that we did a lot of circling.  We didn't drive in many straight lines.  Trying to find, for the most part, our bearings, and tried to pick some high spots so we could look around.  So I think straight-line navigation out in the area we're going  is going to be easily 8 kilometers .
[05:03:27:05] xCC: Okay, great.
<blockquote>] ernan - &quot;One of the things I was expecting to hear myself comment on was the fact that any time you traveled east - particularly on that first day when the Sun was so low - you just couldn't see very well and just had to go slower.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
[05:03:27:07] xCC: Okay.  Another question here, Gene, that you should be able to answer with a simple yes or no.  Was there any spillage of the material in the drill core while you were breaking it down?
[05:03:27:23] CDR: Simple &quot;no&quot;.
[05:03:27:24] xCC: Okay.  And...
[05:03:27:25] CDR: Spillage out of it?
[05:03:27:26] xCC: Yeah, you know, when you broke the sections, did you lose much material out of it?
[05:03:27:33] CDR: No, sir; I didn't lose any.
[05:03:27:35] xCC: Okay, next simple question.  When you were drilling the deep core where the neutron probe was, could you see the RTG over the rock?
[05:03:27:46] CDR: Yes.
[05:03:27:50] xCC: Okay.  You have any feel for how high the rock is or how low... how deep the thing  was with respect to the RTG?  Were you down in a level that was below , even without the rocks being there?
[05:03:28:10] CDR: Yeah, I think I...Yeah, I was in a slump. There was a ridge between us and the RTG, and I had the rock in a line-of-sight between it and where I put that core .  And I'd say the rock was certainly near the ridge and it was - what, Jack? - I don't know, was it a meter to... meter high for the most part.  And it sloped off, and I'd say at least a half a meter high in the line-of-sight from where the neutron probe is to the RTG.  Plus, there's a lot of undulations...I think it'll be below the line-of-sight, anyway.
<blockquote>] hat is, there is plenty of material in the way to absorb the flux of neutrons produced by the RTG and, thereby, keep contamination of the measurement of the natural background to a minimum.]</i></blockquote>
[05:03:28:46] xCC: Okay.  And a somewhat more general question, here.  It says, and I'll read it,  &quot;We're still puzzled as to whether there is a dark mantle.  Could you say something more about the dark regolith surface?&quot;  There's a lot of discussion, today, about whether or not it could have been a regolith derived from the intermediate gabbro which you were sampling as boulders.
[05:03:29:15] LMP: Bob, I think I don't have too much to add to what I said near the end of the EVA.  I do not have an intuitive feeling that the regolith has been derived from most of the boulders that we're seeing.  Because those boulders are fairly light-colored, they look like they're probably 50 percent plagioclase.  It could be that the regolith is derived from some other material that has blanketed the area.  I don't think we have that answer, yet.
[05:03:29:49] xCC: Okay.  I copy that.
[05:03:29:51] CDR: Bob, the boulders we were sampling... think Jack and I both feel that it's probably...We feel we sampled the subfloor because we saw, in the sides of the craters, where some of these boulders were exposed almost as if they were bedrock down there.  In driving back from what we called Station 1, we could definitely see the light mantle out in the area where the potentials of a slide are.
[05:03:30:19] xCC: Okay, very good.  Yeah, I think that the...At least, it's a going bet around here that we're sampling the subfloor when we're sampling - at least the top of the subfloor - when we're sampling the intermediate gabbro there.  The rocks and the boulders.
[05:03:30:34] xCC: Okay.  We also...
[05:03:30:35] LMP: Yeah, the...
[05:03:30:37] xCC: Go ahead.
[05:03:30:39] LMP: Bob.
[05:03:30:40] xCC: Go.
[05:03:30:42] LMP: It is sort of strange that we don't see a good population of finer-grained rocks.  These rocks look very much like igneous rocks, but they're considerably coarser than comparable...Well, they're about the grain size of some of the coarse-grain Mare basalts that tend to differentiate the crystallobalite and tridymite; but we didn't see any of the finer-grain versions.  If it's an intermediate crystalline rock, we have not seen any fine-grain equivalents yet.  At least not in abundance.
<blockquote>] rain size is an indicator of cooling rate and the coarse-grain character of the gabbros suggests that they cooled more slowly than most of the mare basalts brought back by the other crews.  Because material at the surface cools most rapidly, where heat radiates away, and then more slowly as one goes deeper in a flow, one would normally think of coarse-grained samples as having come from a relatively deep portion of a flow and that one should also find finer-grained rocks derived from the upper parts.  During a final review of the manuscript, Jack LMP: suggested that one possible explanation for the absence of fine-grain rocks is that they had been pulverized during the process of regolith formation.  Journal Contributor David Harland adds, &quot;As an aside, the fact that the coarse stuff was also vesicular indicates that it formed near the top of the flow.  Bear in mind Jack's observations that  the coarse stuff was rather lighter in color than he expected, and so was probably higher in plagioclase than usual, and  that the flow had probably cooled sufficiently slowly for there to be vertical differentation - the plage rising to enrich the surficial material - and you have another piece of evidence that there may not have been very much fine-grained material in the flow.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
[05:03:31:24] xCC: Okay, I copy that.    We gather that there's no color change in the dark-mantle material at depth.  In other words, the footprints, wheel tracks, and the rake sample, et cetera, were sort of uniform in color.
[05:03:31:43] LMP: No, there's no major change, but looking out the window - and I think I commented on it - the disturbed regolith  is darker.  Oh, I don't know, maybe by 10 percent albedo, something like that, than the undisturbed surface.
[05:03:32:08] xCC: Okay, I remember your commenting that when you were walking to the ALSEP, I think, Jack, in fact.    Okay, during drilling of the heat flow holes, Gene...
[05:03:32:16] LMP:   That's right.
[05:03:32:17] xCC: ...was there change in color of the cuttings as they piled up...as you went down in depth?  Do you remember any of that?
[05:03:32:30] CDR: Yeah, Bob, both in the core and the heat flow holes, it really didn't seem to pile it up like you're accustomed to at the Cape, and I guess maybe that's because I was kicking so much dust around there.  But I looked specifically when I cleared flutes and what have you, and I didn't see any difference in terms of color, texture, or anything else coming up.

I think I said...and I commented  I'm not sure whether it was the Sun angle or not...But see, I was not looking at the Sculptured Hills; I was looking back at Bear Mountain, I believe.  And, to me it looked like there was some organization that was dipping back to the east, somewhere between, oh, 20 and 25 degrees maybe.  And it was very obvious to me.  But I'm a little hesitant  because of some of this Sun-angle stuff.
<blockquote>] ernan - &quot;Because of the low Sun on that first day - and it was a lot better on the second and third days - it wasn't at all easy to look at the Sculptured Hills and see any detail.  They were about 20 or 30 degrees north of east and the glare was just too strong.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
[05:03:36:05] xCC: Okay, I copy that.  I gather we didn't get any 500-millimeters of these lineations, today, right?
[05:03:36:13] CDR: No, but I think we will.  They were on the western side of Bear Mountain back there, and I think I commented that I thought that Bear Mountain is probably what the Sculptured Hills look like.
<blockquote>] chmitt - &quot;Somebody at the USGS - or maybe it was Jim Head - noticed that, in contrast to some of the other hills, they had a knobby appearance and said 'Hey, they look like somebody sculptured them'.  So they became the Sculptured Hills.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
[05:03:36:28] xCC: Okay, I copy that.  Is there a scar above the light mantle material?  In other words, the slide.  Is there a scar above that on the South Massif?  Can you see anything up there to indicate that it might have come off of there?
[05:03:36:43] LMP: Nothing obvious yet, Bob.
<blockquote>] hey never did see an obvious scar.  In the 100 million years since the slide, impacts and downhill movement of debris have erased and covered the source area on the mountain.]</i></blockquote>
[05:03:36:47] xCC: Okay, copy that.  On the way back to Station 1, you described a small crater with light material on the bottom.  Can you say anything more about that crater?  
[05:03:37:09] LMP: Bob, I don't remember saying that, or...Gene doesn't either.
[05:03:37:15] xCC: Okay.  You talked about something that was light.  I don't remember; I thought it was a boulder, but the question's about a crater.
[05:03:37:22] LMP: You're right.  You're right, there was a large zap pit in a boulder that was very white.  It must have been...The crater for the zap must have been 2 centimeters diameter anyway.  And it had about that, oh, maybe 3-centimeters worth of crushed minerals around it, that gave it a white - very bright white - appearance.
[05:03:37:45] xCC: Okay.  Well that was indeed a small crater, so I guess the question was right.    Let me change the mode here and ask you three or four simple ALSEP questions again, to verify for various people exactly what happened.  Just to make sure that they're clear on it.  Jack, when you were laying out the geophone leads, you mentioned and asked me if it was all right if the geophone leads crossed one another, if there was EMI  problems.  And so that made people wonder whether or not it was possible the geophone positions were reversed; i.e., geophone 1 was laid out in geophone 2s' direction, et cetera.
[05:03:38:35] LMP: No, that was just a Geophone 4 problem.  The geophones are in the right directions.
[05:03:38:40] xCC: Okay.
<blockquote>] chmitt - &quot;The instrumentation identified the signals from each of the geophones by number and, in order to interpret the data, the experimenters had to know where I had deployed each one of them.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
[05:03:38:41] LMP: Geophone 4 fell out of the module and rolled under one of the other lines, or vice versa, I don't know which, and it's crossing one of the other lines.  Geophone 1, I think.
[05:03:38:56] xCC: Okay, no problem.  When you went to put the LSPE antenna in the heat flow socket, you weren't able to do it at first; was it because of there was a lot of dust in there?
[05:03:39:11] LMP: No, I think it was the same old problem of that piece of aluminum foil or whatever it is going down in the socket and jamming briefly.
[05:03:39:23] xCC: Okay, I copy that.  Did you clear out that foil when you did it, or did you just push it on through?
[05:03:39:29] LMP: I forced it.
[05:03:39:31] xCC: Okay.  When you taped the SEP solar cells down, how much of them did you cover with tape?
[05:03:39:41] LMP: We taped the back.
[05:03:39:44] xCC: Ah, very good thinking.  And, Geno, a question for you on the Rover when you parked it.  Do you have any feeling for the roll angle it was parked at the LM?  The roll angle.
[05:03:40:03] CDR: Yeh, let me look.    Bob, it's pretty flat.  If I had to guess, I'd say zero.  And you can bias that by a degree or so, but basically zero.
[05:03:40:18] xCC: Okay, is the pitch scale still on it, or did it fall off yet?
[05:03:40:24] CDR: No.  I was going to comment on that.  It's still there.
<blockquote>] he pitch/roll scale fell off during Apollo 16 but, because a modification of the already-built Apollo 17 indicator would have been difficult and the Apollo 16 crew had had no difficulty in estimating the attitude of their Rover, no change had been made.]</i></blockquote>
[05:03:40:28] xCC: Okay, very good.  Okay, when you went to Station 1A - we're calling the new Station 1 &quot;Station 1A&quot; - were the blocks there as well-filleted as those near the LM and the ALSEP?  Do they all look the same?  
<blockquote>] illets are skirts of soil that pile up at the base of rocks due to small, nearby impacts that splash soil against the sides.]</i></blockquote>
[05:03:40:45] LMP: Bob, all the boulders had filleting to a slight degree, but not an extreme amount.  I think it no more than what is being caused by the redistribution of the darker, fine-grained regolith.
[05:03:41:13] xCC: Okay, I copy that.
<blockquote>] eople in the Backroom are trying to find evidence to support interpretations of the Apollo 15 photography that suggest that only the northern half of the valley was covered by the hypothesized dark-mantling process.  If it was a process that occurred late in the history of the valley, then there might have been a difference in the degree of covering of the pre-existing boulders.]</i></blockquote>
[05:03:41:16] CDR: Bob, if I had to answer...
[05:03:41:17] xCC: Go ahead.
[05:03:41:18] CDR: ...if I had to answer that question, I'd say yes.  Yes, that the boulders are filleted over there about like they are over here.  That would be my impression.
[05:03:41:30] xCC: All right.  Is there any indication that the fillets are directional, in other words, that the fillets are heavier on one side than the other?
[05:03:41:43] LMP: Bob, haven't noticed that.
[05:03:41:49] xCC: Okay, I copy that.  Do you have the feeling that some boulders are more rounded...
[05:03:41:54] LMP: Well that's a good ...  That's a good...
[05:03:41:59] xCC: Roger.  I agree with you.
[05:03:42:04] LMP: That's a good re... That's a good reminder, Bob.
<blockquote>] hat is, a good reminder to look for directionality in the filleting.]</i></blockquote>
[05:03:42:06] xCC: Okay, do have any feeling that some boulders are more rounded than others?  Apparently this looked this way in some of the TV pictures.
[05:03:42:15] LMP: Some of the big ones that are just barely exposed above the regolith looked quite well-rounded.  Most of those around the craters are subangular.  I got the impression that it's just purely a function of how long the same material's been exposed; but some of the big boulders like the one out near the geophones is quite angular in part and quite rounded on other parts.  It's quite variable.
<blockquote>] chmitt - &quot;Angular boulders have profiles such that you can draw two lines from any point on the rock and the rock will fill the space between them.  Subangular is the case where the tip has been rounded off and the rock won't fit between the lines.  And &quot;rounded&quot; is the case where you can't draw any fit better than tangents.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
[05:03:42:47] xCC: Okay, do you want to say any more about that boulder ?  Did it seem to have more or less the same lithology, in addition to the variation in vesicle size that the other rocks in the vicinity of the ALSEP, and the other rocks out at Station 1 had?
[05:03:43:05] LMP: No, it's very comparable to the ones that we saw at Station 1, as a matter of fact.
[05:03:43:10] xCC: Okay, I copy that.
[05:03:43:12] LMP: Both types of rocks were there, both variations.  
[05:03:43:22] xCC: Do you have a feeling for where the big blocks in the LM/ALSEP area came from?  Do you think they were from Camelot, like  been saying?
[05:03:43:34] LMP: Don't have an idea yet; I'm really not sure.
[05:03:43:40] xCC: Okay, and as you drove along on the traverse from the SEP to Station 1, did the size of the small craters with blocky rims vary?  In other words, what we are looking for here is the variation in the thickness of the dark mantle?
[05:03:43:56] LMP: I can't answer that one yet, Bob.
<blockquote>] he diameter and depth of a crater depend on the impact energy.  In places where the regolith is thin, impacts forming relatively small craters would penetrate to bedrock  and dig up blocks.]</i></blockquote>
[05:03:43:57] xCC: Okay.  Let me sum up by saying that - I guess as I indicated before - our best guess is that the vesicular crystalline rock - probably gabbro, or I think you've been calling it intermediate basalt or gabbro - forms at least the upper part of the subfloor.  I don't think we've been close enough to a large crater rim to say what the deep sections of the subfloor form; but we think that this intermediate gabbro, vesicular rock - at least medium-grained, perhaps coarse-grained rock - forms at least the upper layer of the subfloor.  Over.  
<blockquote>] uring crater formation, the ejecta blanket can be described as overturning on the surrounding terrain.  Material from near the original surface will be found at the bottom of the ejecta blanket and will be exposed only at relatively great distances from the rim.  Material dug out from the greatest depth of penetration will lie on the top on the ejecta blanket, but only at the rim or even on the crater floor.]</i></blockquote>
[05:03:44:48] LMP: Yeah, Bob, I think that's pretty safe, right now.  Once again, I'm surprised that it's as coarse as it is, that being the upper portion of a plains unit.
[05:03:45:00] xCC: Roger.
[05:03:45:01] CDR: Say, Bob, driving back from Station 1, where we did some of our circling and what have you, we didn't have time to get off, but we did see down in - I don't remember whether it was in the slopes of some craters, or down on the slope itself - but I'd say several meters down below the mantle where there was what we almost agreed to might be bedrock  at least a deeper portion of the subfloor.
<blockquote>] ene is beginning to sound tired again.]</i></blockquote>
[05:03:45:34] xCC: Okay, well, I think we'll get to it tomorrow.  I think I might just give you a clue to our thinking for tomorrow.  But, I don't think we've seen, or done, anything today that is going to make us change very much from the nominal station...  EVA-2 plan.   The fact we didn't get to the large boulders at Emory is probably going to mean that Station 5 might be shifted a little bit to the boulders on Camelot.  But certainly Station 5 on the subfloor and also Station 10 have assumed a higher priority than they originally had.  Other than that I, don't think we'll see an awful lot of changes to EVA-2.  Over.
<blockquote>] tation 5  and Station 10  are planned at the rims of large craters sure to have penetrated deep into the bedrock.]</i></blockquote>
[05:03:46:15] LMP: Okay, Bob.  I think that's safe.  I suppose somebody's thinking about the possibility of going down to Emory.  Maybe you just said that.  Going down to Emory late in EVA-3.
[05:03:46:27] xCC: I think at the moment they're thinking primarily about going to Station 10, and not going to Station 1.  
<blockquote>] tation 10 is on the route back to the LM from the more northerly stops planned for EVA-3; Emory Crater, the original Station 1, is well to the south and, therefore, would require a substantial detour.]</i></blockquote>
[05:03:46:51] Allen: Okay, Jack, I've wrested control...
[05:03:46:53] LMP: Some of your experts might...
[05:03:46:56] Allen: Go ahead.
[05:03:47:01] LMP: Some of your experts might think about what they might expect to happen to.  What the regolith on a fine-grain pyroclastic would look like.
[05:03:47:16] Allen: Okay.
<blockquote>] chmitt - &quot;I was asking them to think about the situation of a fine-grained pyroclastic laid down on the subfloor.  What sort of regolith would develop in that situation and what would you expect to find?  Obviously I was thinking about it, and I wanted the bright guys on the ground to think about it, too.  We eventually proved at Shorty that this is what had happened, but we hadn't been there yet and I was asking what might be unique about a regolith developed on a pyroclastic versus a regolith developed on a basalt flow.  I don't think I ever got an answer to the question.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
[05:03:47:17] xCC: We'll tell them.  I'll see you tomorrow, guys.
[05:03:47:22] LMP: Sleep well, Bob.
[05:03:47:25] CDR: Okay, I've just got one question, Bob, before you run off.  Did the TGE perform okay with the  camera on?
[05:03:47:39] xCC: As far as I could tell, Geno, it did.  As a matter of fact, I didn't see the gravimeter people afterwards to talk to them.  But as far as I could tell, it did.  We had one funny reading back at the LM very early when it was on the ground, which I'm at a loss to understand right off.  But other than that everything seems to have gone very well.  The readings were quite uniform in fact, which is what makes me think they went well.
[05:03:48:03] CDR: Okay, well, I'd like to leave it...You know it's a little change in my thinking  I'd like to leave it on the Rover if we can, although it's a piece of cake to take off.  It's very difficult to lean over that far without losing your balance and take your readings and what have you.  So if we can leave it on , it would be far better.
[05:03:48:20] xCC: Roger.  I was noticing that.  And I also noticed the only three-ball  reading we got was when it was on the ground.
[05:03:48:30] CDR: Yeah.  
<blockquote>] his is a reference to the disturbed reading at 123:56:55.  Bob remembers that a 000 readout was an explicit indication that the instrument had been disturbed while a measurement was in progress.]</i></blockquote>
[05:03:48:36] Allen: Gene and Jack, if you'll get Lunar Surface Checklist to  3-5, I've got an easy change to read up to you.
[05:03:48:54] LMP: Go ahead.
[05:03:49:00] Allen: Okay.  After the line:  &quot;Empty ETB As Follows,&quot; change the first line which reads, &quot;B&amp;W Mag Golf In Forward RHSSC&quot;  to read, &quot;B&amp;W Mag Hotel In LCG Compartment&quot;.  And then go into the next column, which begins, &quot;Stow In ETB.&quot; Change the second line, which reads:  &quot;LMP's Camera With B&amp;W Mag Hotel&quot; to &quot;LMP's Camera With B&amp;W Mag Golf&quot;.

[05:03:50:08] Allen: And I've got a LEVA-cleaning procedure which maybe you could pencil in there.  It's an easy three-step procedure.  And I'll go ahead and read it step-by-step here.  Step number 1 is: &quot;Tap LEVA base to remove loose dust&quot;.  Step number 2 reads:  &quot;If excess dust still remains, use a towel from the LM tissue dispenser, which has been wetted with water, and gently wipe the visor from the top to the bottom; that is, in one direction.  And fold this towel after each wipe to keep the contact surface clean&quot;.  There's a note: &quot;Take care not to wet the inside - that is, the concave surface - of the gold visor.&quot; And the last step is:  &quot;Allow it to air-dry&quot;.  And that's it on the LEVA cleaning.

[05:04:10:58] Allen: Gene and Jack, just a general comment on that.  SIM bay's cooking along beautifully.  We are getting lunar sounder data.  It looks quite interesting.  We've only got one or two annoying problems with it, but nothing major...That is, with the SIM bay, not with the sounder.  One of them being that we have our usual mapping camera extend problem.  And we've just decided to leave it extended and it will serve it right if it gets a little contaminated with an occasional  dump.  And I guess there's a minor problem with one of the big antennas.  It didn't pass its retract check properly, so I guess it may have to be jettisoned when we do a plane change.  Otherwise, things are working beautifully.  Over.

[05:04:47:35] LMP: It's come on pretty fast just since I came back.  I think as soon as the cabin filters most of this out that is in the air, I'll be all right.  But I didn't know I had lunar dust hay fever.
[05:04:47:54] Allen: It's funny they don't check for that.  Maybe that's the trouble with the cheap noses, Jack.
[05:04:48:05] LMP: Could be.  I don't know why we couldn't have gone and smelled some dust in the LRL  just to find out.
[05:04:48:12] Allen: Goodness knows we've tried.

[05:04:50:57] Allen: Okay, Jack and Gene.  And, unless you've got questions, or we can help you out in some way, we'll say good night to you.
[05:04:51:10] CDR:    good morning.    The reason I say that, Joe, it's going to be another 30 minutes or so anyway - probably more like an hour - before we actually close our eyes.

[05:04:52:09] CDR: Yeah, I'd like to try to get the full amount .  As I recall, tomorrow's a little bit flexible.  If we get out 30 minutes late, it doesn't really hurt us.
[05:04:52:20] Allen: Sounds like a good way to proceed.  We'll give you the full 8 hours tonight, Geno.  And you do have a time pad in there, so it shouldn't hurt a thing.
<blockquote>] here is some unallocated time in the flight plan, some &quot;padding&quot; in the schedule.]</i></blockquote>
[05:04:52:33] CDR: Yeah, the big object tomorrow is to get out, and get back in, and the same thing with the next day.  I don't think we're really that time critical either day that we can't go an hour either way.  And I think we'd prefer to have the full 8  tonight.
[05:04:52:50] Allen: Roger.  We couldn't agree with you more.  And if there's any way we can be helping you now, just speak up.
[05:04:53:02] CDR: No, you've been doing fine.  We just got a little housecleaning we got to do that's going to take us...I expect we'll be an hour late, Joe.

[Cernan - &q] e still had to set up the hammocks.  Our suits were probably already in the back of the cabin, hooked up to hoses to dry out; and there were always a few things to shuffle around: get our foodstuffs stowed, clean the visors, look at the rocks and pack them away, and so on.  We were busy almost all the time.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
[05:05:01:56] LMP: Hey, Joe.
[05:05:02:00] Allen: Go ahead.
[05:05:02:07] LMP:  some ambiguity in your statement.  You want us to use a tissue or a towel on that visor cleaning?
[05:05:02:18] Allen: Jack, they call it...They call it a &quot;towel&quot;, but it comes from the LM tissue dispenser, so I would interpret that to mean &quot;tissue&quot;.
[05:05:02:36] LMP: Well, you and I are thinking alike.  But could you ask back there and find out?
<blockquote>] ack doesn't want to take a chance on scratching the visors.]</i></blockquote>
[05:05:02:46] Allen: Asking right now.  
[05:05:03:43] Allen: Jack, our guess was right on the cleaning of the visors there.  We're to use a tissue from the LM tissue dispenser.  And I've got an unrelated question for you.  We're chasing  water usage down here.  Could you tell us, please, if you refilled the drink dispensers in the suit already?  Over.
[05:05:04:12] LMP: That's affirm.  We have.  
[05:05:04:34] Allen: Okay.  Thank you.  
[05:05:04:47] LMP: We have been drinking quite a bit of water, Joe.
[05:05:04:59] Allen: Okay.  Thank you.
<blockquote>] omm Break.  During the EVA, water lost from the body in sweat and breath would have built up in the suit had the PLSS not contained a wick-like device to extract excess moisture.  This was then stored in a reservoir, although not one connected to either the Liquid Cooled Garment closed-loop supply or to the sublimator feedwater supply.

[Cernan - &q] he Liquid Cooled Garment was really important to help keep you cool so that you wouldn't sweat too much.  Back in Gemini we had nothing but air cooling; and, during my Gemini IX EVA, the humidity in the suit got to be 100% and I got my helmet all fogged up.  The LCG made it a totally different ball game.  You still perspired and you had to make sure you drank enough water that you didn't become dehydrated; but you didn't have to worry about overheating and fogging up.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
[05:05:07:50] LMP: Houston; Challenger.  How do you read?
[05:05:07:56] Allen: You're loud and clear.  Go ahead.
[05:05:08:04] LMP: Joe, I just took a quick look with the hand lens at that large rock I brought in, and I don't think there's much more than 30 percent plagioclase.  I'll go back to it being more of a standard basalt or gabbro.  It has a fair proportion of ilmenite in it, I believe.  There's some bright platelets - in the vugs or vesicles - of ilmenite.  Now it could be that, if the soil is very glassy, that it's developed the darker color from the contribution of the mafic minerals to the glass, particularly the iron and the titanium.
<blockquote>] chmitt - &quot;This was another alternative to consider for the dark mantle, another hypothesis to work on.  Because there were more mafic minerals in the basalt than we originally thought, you might have had a darker impact glass develop and, so, you had to continue to consider the possibility that the dark mantle was a dark regolith derived from basalt with a high concentration of iron/titanium minerals in it.  In a sense, because the glass beads we found at Shorty were dark because they were rich in iron and titanium, this hypothesis is also a step closer to the truth.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
[05:05:09:01] Allen: Roger, Jack.  Copy that.  Sounds interesting.
[05:05:09:07] LMP: All it means is that we don't yet know the origin of the dark mantle.
[05:05:09:17] Allen: Roger.  
[05:05:09:26] LMP: That rock looks like I may have, by accident, sampled one side of one of the parting planes that I mentioned.   very, very sharply bounded on one side by a planar surface.
[05:05:09:52] Allen: Roger, Jack.  Say again.  You may have sampled by accident the side of what?
[05:05:10:07] LMP: No, I mentioned when I sampled it.  It had one very planar surface, and looking at it more closely, it looks like one of those parting planes that I talked about even earlier in the EVA.
[05:05:10:17] Allen: Ah, Rog.  Copy.  &quot;Parting planes&quot;, thank you.
[05:05:10:24] LMP: That's like a parting shot .  
[05:05:10:34] Allen: Of which you've been known to have an overabundance, by the way.
[05:05:10:43] LMP: Oh, I didn't know that.
[05:05:10:49] Allen: All us fast finishers do.  
[05:05:10:58] LMP: That's right.  You got to figure out what race you're in though, first, Joe.
[05:05:11:09] Allen: I'm sure that Sherlock Holmes would have a suitable quotation to answer that, Jack.  I just can't come up with it right now.  
<blockquote>] ournal Contributor Brian Lawrence suggests &quot;Come Watson, the game's afoot.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
[05:05:11:16] Allen: Something like &quot;therein, Watson, lies the problem&quot;...
[05:05:11:20] LMP: That, in itself, is a singular event.  
[05:05:11:44] LMP: But the dog did nothing in the nighttime, Joe.  
[05:05:11:59] Allen: And when you've examined all possibilities and eliminated all but the very improbable ones, then the improbable one must mean the truth.
[05:05:12:16] LMP: I told you he  was a good geologist , one of the experts on the soils of London.    Not to mention their relationship to all kinds of brands of tobacco.  
[05:05:12:58] Allen: Jack, maybe we better get off onto another vein.  Surgeon's giving me a puzzled look over here.  We may be getting in trouble.
[05:05:13:12] LMP: You want to talk about veins.   Now that's something an old ore geologist could talk about all night.  
[05:05:13:26] Allen: Ore geologists and cardiologists alike.
