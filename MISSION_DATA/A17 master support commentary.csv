-02:37:22|moonport||The countdown proceeded. At T-82 minutes launch control reported the cabin purge had been completed, and the booster protective cover closed. The spacecraft was pressurized and checked for leaks. Houston tested its command signals to the launch vehicle, and the first-motion signal was checked out with Houston and the Eastern Test Range; the next time, it would bring them word of liftoff. The last weather balloon was released to determine wind direction. In the meantime the C-band and Q-ball tests were in hand. The first was used in tracking to report range velocity during the powered phase. The Q-ball, perched above the launch escape system, would warn the spacecraft commander of deviations in the first stages of flight. Cernan reported things looking good ""up here."" His next task was to check out the emergency hand control for the service module engine, normally operated by a computer. Far below him, little white wisps marked the topping off of the propellant loads.
-02:15:33|moonport||At T-1 hour, the close-out crew had secured the white room and was clearing the pad area. The elevators were set at the 96-meter level, for the astronauts' use in an emergency. At T-50 minutes the launch control center initiated the power transfer test, switching the vehicle momentarily onto its own battery power and then restoring external power. Some five minutes later, swing arm 9 - the access arm to the spacecraft - retracted 12 degrees to a standby position. Range safety test signals were flashing to the still unarmed destruct receivers.
-01:16:23|Oral History 2000|LMP|We went into the final countdown and got to thirty seconds, and everything had come alive beneath us. The gimbals were moving and the rocket, you could feel it. You're lying there on your back, you could feel the engines moving down a football field below you or more, as it prepared for ignition.
-01:16:02|moonport||At T-3 minutes and 7 seconds, the automatic sequencer took over. This sequencer, the oldest and most reliable piece of automation on LC-39, chose this moment in the launching of the last Apollo to cause trouble. At T-30 seconds it went into an automatic cutoff indicating that one of the essential operations leading to the launch of the space vehicle had not been properly completed. Besides halting the countdown, the cutoff started a series of ""safing"" procedures which included the return of swing arm 9 to a standby position.
-01:03:22|Oral History 1999|LMP|The one thing that you don't want to do is have a aborted launch on a launch pad and have to recycle and come back a month later and go through another month of simulator training. You're ready to go when you're ready to go. And I think everybody felt that way.
-01:03:22|Oral History 2000|LMP|You certainly don't want to recycle for another month. That was the first thought we had on the launch pad when we did, in fact, have a delay, was that, well, let's hope that we don't have to go through this for another month. You would have gotten into it and done it and then never noticed the difference, but still at the immediate point of being ready to launch, you're ready to launch, there's no question about that.
-01:01:33|Oral History 2000|LMP|Somewhere in the deep dark past of computer programming, a programmer had told the final sequencing checks that the computer was going to do - to look to see if a signal to pressurize a booster oxygen tank had been sent. Not whether it had been received and acted upon, but had the signal been sent.
-01:01:33|Oral History 2000|LMP|Well, when they went through that particular point where that signal was supposed to have been sent and the tank pressurized, the signal didn't get sent. The computer didn't send the signal, but the person in the launch control center saw that that didn't happen and just pressed a button and pressurized the tank. So everything was fine, but the computer didn't know it. When they went through the final sequence, the computer saw that that signal hadn't been sent, and it said "Hold."
-01:01:33|Oral History 2000|LMP|So the computer just shut everything down. That's what you want them to do, it's just that it was programmed wrong. Garbage in, garbage out. So what they did, they actually went into the launch computers, tracked down that point and hard-wired around that particular sensor so that the next time the computer went through, it would believe that the signal had been sent. Sure enough, it believed it, and off we went. We were two hours and forty minutes late, but, nevertheless, we were on our way.
-00:49:26|||Launch director Skip (Clarence) Chauvin explained the situation to the crew. Schmitt managed to nap during the delay.
-00:49:26|Oral History 2000|LMP|Right at thirty seconds, Skip Chauvin came over the line and said we have a hold. I think Gene was more concerned than the rest of us, because none of us knew whether everything in the spacecraft and in the rocket knew we were in a hold. But we went through that thirty-second period and it was quiet for a few minutes. Then Chauvin came back on the line and said, "We have a problem with the launch computer. It's not a major problem. We're going to fix it and when we have it fixed, we'll recycle." I think it was eight minutes for a planned hold and then go through it again. That is exactly what happened.
-00:49:26|Oral History 2000|LMP|At that point I felt very comfortable. I'd worked with Skip in many chamber tests and things like that, so we knew him very well, and from the sound of his voice, it didn't sound like anything that wasn't going to be fixed. So I fell asleep. Anytime you put fans humming or a little bit of vibration, things like that, I can go to sleep. There's no problem. So I got an hour or so dozing sleep while we were waiting for that problem to be fixed.
-00:00:55|Technical Debriefing|CDR|The count and lift-off, through the yaw and the roll program, were nominal once we got through T-0. Distinction of sounds in launch vehicle sequence countdown to lift-off - I think the only thing that really comes across in there is that at some point you get a good vibration. At some point in the countdown, you get a good vibration as you're sitting up there. It's not part of the CSM's operation, so you're not sure what's going on. And this happened in the CDDT and, of course, all we did was check and find out we were doing something with the booster.
-00:00:50|Technical Debriefing|CMP|When they ran through some gimbaling programs.
-00:00:45|Technical Debriefing|CDR|The major portion of the launch count has to do with checking out the systems, so the commander stays very busy and many times on separate loops. The entire EDS system checked out very well. We only checked it out once in the initial count and during most of the recycle we stayed in EDS AUTO and then we de-armed EDS AUTO but still maintained a manual EDS capability to abort during that recycle time. We picked EDS AUTO as part of the T minus 20 recycle for final lift-off.
-00:00:08|Technical Debriefing|CDR|The S-IC ignition - The lights started going out at 7 seconds, and somewhere around 3 seconds they were completely out. You could feel the ignition. You could feel the engines come up to speed. Just prior to lift-off and during the first few seconds of lift-off when we were near the pad, both the CMP and I could see the reflection of the engine ignition out the left-hand window and the hatch window in the BPC. We could not see the fire but could see a red glow through the windows reflecting apparently off the surface. Ignition was like a big old freight train sort of starting to rumble and shake and rattle and as she lifted off. We got a good tower clear.
000:00:01|Technical Debriefing|CDR|It was dark and we didn't see anything until S-IC ignition.
000:00:01|Technical Debriefing|CMP|I really wasn't watching the lights because I guess I didn't expect the thing to shake quite as much as it did. To me, I felt like I was really vibrating. I wanted to find out what was making me vibrate. I wasn't expecting that much vibration when the S-IC lit off. At lift-off, again, once it got vibrating, I didn't feel the yaw. I was watching the needle on the thing but didn't feel the yaw, though.
000:00:08|Technical Debriefing|CDR|Powered flight - During the actual powered flight of the S-IC you could not see anything at all. You couldn't see out the cockpit, as we had the lights up fairly bright.
000:01:13|Oral History 2000|LMP| think everybody [who] rode a Saturn V was tremendously stimulated by the experience. It's a very heavy vibration. Very slow acceleration at first, but heavy, heavy vibration as the five F-1 engines in the first stage, the S-IC, are fighting each other to some degree. You build up, over two minutes and forty-five seconds, about 4 Gs acceleration.
000:01:23|Technical Debriefing|CDR|As you go through MAX Q, as in the past, it gets very rough and much noisier, but I don't think we ever had any trouble hearing each other in the spacecraft. I had my intercom very high and all my S-bands and tweaked everything up prior to lift-off. We went through max-q and the only unusual thing going through max-q, considering wind components that we had was that I saw 25 percent on the ALPHA going through max-q. The yaw needle was right on, but the pitch needle had dropped to a degree and a half at the most. I guess I didn't really expect it because of the predicted wind components. After we got through max-q, you could still certainly tell the bird was burning as we pressed on toward staging, but it got much quieter and it was very evident that you were through max-q when that time came.
000:01:23|Technical Debriefing|CMP|The shaking increased a little bit up to MAX Q and then there was a different type of shaking. It was more of a vibration, I think, going through MAX Q. And there was more noise associated with going through MAX Q.
000:02:35|Technical Debriefing|CDR|If you want to put them in more layman terms, I think the S-IC acted and performed like some big, old, rugged, shaky, big monster. It has to be noisy, has lots of vibration, and smoothed out somewhat after max-q, but still was a rumbling bird.
000:02:35|Technical Debriefing|LMP|I think that it is good to do a lot of simulation about malfunctions during launch, but up through max-q it is a little bit unrealistic to think that you are going to analyze a malfunction in the spacecraft.
000:02:35|Technical Debriefing|CDR|To sum up the S-IC, I personally didn't think it was any different than my previous ride on the S-IC and up through this point being a night launch really didn't make any difference at all. The only thing I did different that I hadn't really though a lot about until I sat on the pad and began to think about staging was, just prior to staging, I took my hand off the abort handle and held the support arm rather than the translation control handle until after staging. I did this just a couple of seconds prior to staging. I had talked about it with John Young a little bit prior to the flight and it turns out that's what he did, also. Probably a good thing.
000:02:44|Technical Debriefing|CMP|Of course, with the shutdown of the S-IC, I think that was about 4-1/2g.
000:02:44|Technical Debriefing|CDR|We pushed 4g.
000:02:44|Technical Debriefing|LMP|Just pushing 4g on the thing and it quits just like that. I was prepared for it because Gene had said, "Hey, brace yourselves because it is going to happen,"" and it happened all right. It just flat quit when we went from 4g to 0."
000:02:44|Technical Debriefing|CDR|The great train wreck.
000:02:44|Technical Debriefing|LMP|I think in all those booster cutoffs, it's hard to see how rapidly the g-level decreases.
000:02:44|Oral History 2000|LMP|Very slow acceleration at first, but heavy, heavy vibration as the five F-1 engines in the first stage, the S-IC, are fighting each other to some degree. You build up, over two minutes and forty-five seconds, about 4 Gs' acceleration. At that point everything shuts down. You drop off the first stage and then you ignite the second stage, the S-II, and you're back on your way, but only at one and a half Gs. So there's a big change, it's from 4 Gs to minus one and a half, as the whole stack unloads, to plus one and a half, as you go on on the second stage. And that all happens in just slightly over a second. So that is probably the most dynamically exciting point in the mission, certainly in the launch part of it. From then on it's pretty straightforward. You get into orbit in about ten minutes using all three stages.
000:02:49|Technical Debriefing|CDR|We had center engine shutdown on time. We had staging on time. ... At staging, the S-IC shut down, something that you don't see in the daylight is that the fireball overtook us.
000:02:49|Technical Debriefing|CMP|It sure did.
000:02:49|Technical Debriefing|CDR|When the S-II lit off, we literally for a nanosecond flew through the bright yellow fireball that was left over from the S-IC. ... I don't think it's ever been recorded on a daylight launch before, but as soon as the S-IC shut down during the time involved in recycling and getting the staging sequence going and the S-II lit off, apparently the trailing flame of the S-IC overtook the spacecraft when we immediately went into that zero-g condition. And, for just a second, as the S-II lit off, we went through the flame. It was very obvious. We could see it out of both windows. I particularly could see it out of the left-hand rendezvous window of the BPC. It was not a smoke; it was not an orange fireball; it was just a bright yellow fire of the trailing flame of the S-IC; and it happened for just a split second. Then we got off on the S-II and things got very quiet and very smooth and was a very long, quiet, smooth ride.
000:03:16|Technical Debriefing|CDR|We got skirt sep right on time. I could feel skirt sep going.
000:03:20|Technical Debriefing|CDR|We had tower jett, which was really sort of spectacular at night. I think the LMP is going to add something to it, but from the left-hand rendezvous window, I could not only see the flame, but the inside of the BPC seemed to be lit up. Of course, it doesn't stay there very long; it's gone in just a split second. But it was a very spectacular sight at night to see that tower go against the blackness of space out there.
000:03:20|Technical Debriefing|CDR|Tower jett was very evident. You could see the flash and I could see the entire BPC. I could see underneath it. It was lit up underneath. The whole thing was lit up.
000:03:20|Technical Debriefing|LMP|On the tower jett, I wouldn't say a split second. As a matter of fact, I was surprised it lasted as long as it did. It was a few seconds.
000:03:20|Technical Debriefing|CMP|I couldn't see the rocket go. All I could see was an orange glow out the center window.
000:03:36|Technical Debriefing|CDR|We could see guidance come in very definitely. It was not as big a pulsation as I've seen on the simulator but I did see the needle and the spacecraft did change its attitude slightly. You could see the mixture ratio shift. It was just a long, smooth, quiet ride.
000:04:58|Technical Debriefing|CDR|While we were on the S-II, we would see no indication of light from the engines. We were just thrusting out in the darkness of space. I tried to see stars for potential mode IV and, of course, at that time, mode II abort and turned the lights down on the left side once or twice. But even with the lights down on (we had the LEB lights relatively low), in my estimation, it would have required all the lights in the spacecraft to have been off and certainly more than a few seconds to become night adapted to be able to see through the windows and pick up stars that would have been able to help in an abort situation had you lost the computer and the SCS. We had looked, potentially planned to use those stars in an abort condition if we had to. We had excellent constellations to look at. They obviously were there, but I could not see through the low glow reflection on the window even with our lights, floodlights, turned almost all the way down. I even went to the extent of trying to shield my eyes on the S-II and looked out the window and I still could not pick up anything that I could have recognized for an abort. I also could not pick up any night horizons during that point in time which I thought I might be able to base on seeing where the stars cut off and where they do not.
000:04:58|Technical Debriefing|LMP|We had another indication of that during entry when we were looking for a night horizon and finally saw it, but it was extremely hard to find.
000:07:40|Technical Debriefing|CDR|Inboard cutoff was right on time. You could feel it, a definite physiological feeling. Of course, the g-meter saw it also.
000:09:37|Technical Debriefing|CDR|The S-I cutoff, as Jack said, is again very sharp, almost instantaneous, from almost 4g to 0. But on the S-II, although it's sharp and a very hard hit, you don't unload the entire stack like you do when you're on the S-IC. The staging was very smooth. It did not seem like an exceptionally long time before we separated and the S-IVB lit off.
000:09:37|Technical Debriefing|CDR|I could see nothing on S-II until S-II shutdown. I could see the glow of S-IVB ignition. I say the glow of S-IVB ignition, it very easily could have been the fireball of S-II which tried to overtake us but couldn't quite make it. But there was a glow right during the period of S-II shutdown to S-IVB ignition. During the S-IVB burn, you could see the glow of the aft engines throughout the burn and throughout the orbital [operation?]
000:09:37|Technical Debriefing|CDR|We got lit off on the S-IVB, and, unlike the flame we flew through on the S-II, we did not do that on the S-IVB. I don't know where the reflection came from, but I could see the reflection from somewhere out the forward window. Either it was the S-II trailing flame trying to overtake the vehicle but didn't quite make it, or it was S-IVB ignition reflecting off the S-II because there's no atmosphere up there at that point. But I did not see a flame, but a residual back light out that window just for a short period of time, either right at staging or just at S-IVB ignition. As I think back, my best guess would be that the same thing happened on the S-II, that the trailing flame, when you go from 4g to 0 instantaneously, tends to overtake the vehicle. But in the case of the S-II, it's not nearly as big a pattern and just didn't quite make it up the stack. I just saw some of the glow of it. That's my best guess. After the S-IVB ignited, we never saw anything except the APS firing throughout that burn. You could see the mixture ratio shift.
000:09:37|Technical Debriefing|LMP|But PU shift, both vehicles, was surprisingly noticeable.
000:09:37|Technical Debriefing|CDR|The S-II was a Cadillac: quiet, less than 1g flight most of the time until we built up our g-load prior to staging. It was quiet, smooth, had very little noise, or feeling of rumbling or anything else.
000:11:54|Technical Debriefing|CDR|Communications throughout the booster phase were excellent. I never had any problem hearing either Stony or CAPCOM. Controls and displays performed super. Crew comfort through powered flight - I felt very comfortable throughout the entire flight in orbit.
000:11:54|Technical Debriefing|CDR|As far as I'm concerned, there was no pogo on the burn.
000:11:54|Technical Debriefing|CMP|No, none.
000:11:54|Technical Debriefing|CDR|Summing up the birds. If you want to put them in more layman terms, I think the S-IC acted and performed like some big, old, rugged, shaky, big monster. It has to be noisy, has lots of vibration, and smoothed out somewhat after max-q, but still was a rumbling bird. The S-II was a Cadillac: quiet, less than 1g flight most of the time until we built up our g-load prior to staging. It was quiet, smooth, had very little noise, or feeling of rumbling or anything else. The S-IVB: a light little chugger is probably the best way I can describe it, which is not different than I remember it in the past. It just sort of rumbled on, not anywhere near the extent of the S-IC, but just sort of continued to rumble on through the burn. After a while, especially during TLI, it got to be a very pleasant, warm feeling that she was burning like she should burn.
000:11:54|Technical Debriefing|CMP|Chugging, I think, has two different connotations. I felt the S-IVB was more of a very light rumble in the background, something that is kind of rumbling as opposed to chugging. A chug to me is a bang-bang type thing, and to me it was more of a rumble.
000:11:54|Technical Debriefing|LMP| agree, it may be a sense of rumbling but the ride was smooth. I could sense some activity behind it, but I wouldn't have said that it was chugging.
000:11:54|Technical Debriefing|CDR|I'll modify chugging to say it was a hummocky chug, just a rolling type. Nothing different, and, as I say, the best recollection, similar to the S-IVB I had the opportunity to ride on before, but probably even more steady and continuous flow of light rumbling.
000:13:00|Technical Debriefing|CDR|Evaluation of insertion parameters - We got a good onboard orbit. Ground gave us a GO for orbit. The postinsertion systems configuration systems checkout and the complete spacecraft and booster preparation for TLI went extremely smooth and extremely rapid.
000:13:00|Technical Debriefing|CDR|Earth orbit - I might comment that the availability of stars for a mode II or mode IV abort was pretty poor for two reasons. Number one: night adaptability because we had lights very bright. When we turned the lights down in the cockpit, I could not pick out distinct constellations such as Orion, which I was planning on using for a mode IV abort. If we would have had an SCS and G&N problem it would have been very difficult to pick out stars for that abort.
000:23:56|Technical Debriefing|CDR|Launching at night, we just had a somewhat different view of the Earth than most other flights have had. The first real view we got of being in orbit at that point was pretty spectacular because it happened to be Earth sunrise and that's a very intriguing and interesting way to get your first indoctrination to Earth orbit.
000:23:56|Technical Debriefing|LMP|The transcript contains some descriptions, by all three of us, of sequences of that sunrise which, in the color banding, may be of some significance for other people.
000:23:56|Technical Debriefing|LMP|I think the tapes cover some comments on the Earth illumination at the horizons. Briefly, right at the terminator horizon of the Earth, you get sharp shadow definition of cloud features. At the sunlit horizon from lunar distance that's a very clear definition between the black of space and the upper portion of the Earth. In Earth orbit and near Earth, you can see the gradation of that horizon caused by the atmosphere. At night around the Earth, there's a very clear horizon glow all around the Earth. Air glow, I guess you would call it. And the horns of the crescent Earth are much sharper and elongated compared to those of the crescent Moon, as if light was being diffracted into the atmosphere and in extending the length of the horns of the crescent.
001:22:48|Technical Debriefing|CDR|By the time we came back over the States on the first pass, we were ready and the spacecraft was ready, and we were configured and could have gone on a TLI-0 without any hurrying and scurrying whatsoever. From that point on, when we got our GO on the booster and a GO for TLI-1, it was an Earth-orbit, an extra Earth-orbit ride to sit back and just monitor our systems in the spacecraft and see what we could see from Earth orbit in terms of viewing. It was an extra 90 minutes of the flight that, if you really had to do without, you could have. And it was not hurried. It was very comfortable, even progressing toward the TLI-0.
001:22:48|Technical Debriefing|LMP|Let me add just a couple of things. One thing that we had because of the later launch was a number of LOS/AOS updates to plot which did not interfere with our getting through the checklist. The checklist, I had a feeling, went more slowly than it ever had. But, as Gene says, still with plenty of time to meet the zero up time and to have essentially a whole daylight pass to just relax and look at the Earth. We had one note here. I didn't even remember until I read it here that in the ECS checks the hydrogen pressure indicators, or part of the indicators, were reading about 10 percent lower than we expected. But, as I recall, it may have been expected.
002:29:45|Technical Debriefing|LMP|The communications all through Earth orbit were excellent, as I recall. There was no difficulty getting the pads up. They came up expeditiously and well read. We actually gained a little time because we didn't have television. But we didn't need it. We could have configured it for use.
002:29:45|Technical Debriefing|LMP|If there's ever any attempt to do weather observing from Earth orbit, in the low orbit like that, you're going to have to have a very clear plan of where you're looking at what time you're looking in order to make reference as to where you are because you're moving so fast. You can't really keep track of where you are and specifically in terms of weather observation. Later on, once you get the whole globe in view, it's a relatively simple thing to pin down to within a few degrees of latitude and longitude where you are looking on the Earth.
002:29:45|Technical Debriefing|CDR|On all these lunar missions, we've never really done much in Earth orbit except get prepared for the TLI burn. Future Earth-orbit flights need this continual map update, you're right. You have to do that. As I think back to 3 days in Earth orbit, unless you continually follow a map and a map update as to your rev as you progress around the world, what part of that world you're looking at is very difficult to follow except the precise piece of real estate you're flying over.
002:29:45|Technical Debriefing|LMP|The lunar orbital operation is somewhat different because you stay in the same groundtrack much longer I think.
003:12:40|Technical Debriefing|CDR|The TLI burn from the ground targeting point of view and targeting went just as written. We went down the checklist and cue card without any problems or any anomalies, without any changes except to the manual. We had a change to all our manual angles to monitor the S-IVB burn because of the late lift-off. We wrote those down on our cue cards and were going to use those in case we had to take over during the burn. We had to change to the nominal and we rewrote both of those on our cue cards. That's the only basic change I think we had.
003:14:55|Technical Debriefing|LMP|We all were very aware of PU shift.
003:14:55|Technical Debriefing|CDR|I guess I could have called that or I was looking forward to seeing it. It is on my checklist. It's on my cue card and I've looked for it and I've seen it in the simulator.
003:14:55|Technical Debriefing|LMP|It just didn't register in the simulators, I guess.
003:15:53|Technical Debriefing|CDR|When we burned out of Earth orbit, we started the burn in darkness and flew right on through a sunrise during the TLI burn. This was pretty spectacular. We shut down in daylight and had no other visual sightings at that point in time.
003:15:53|Technical Debriefing|LMP|And the other thing flying through that sunrise, it did to a small degree interfere with visibility in the cockpit.
003:15:53|Technical Debriefing|CDR|It didn't bother me from the standpoint of monitoring on my side at all.
003:19:21|Technical Debriefing|CDR|The S-IVB performance was outstanding. She lit off on time and burned for 5 minutes and some odd seconds as I recall. And we had shutdown on time. The residuals and the EMS on the spacecraft are written down somewhere, but they were all very nominal, very excellent. We stayed in IU. As the S-IVB maneuvered, we flew through a sunrise during TLI, which in itself was also very interesting, very spectacular. We had nominal S-IVB performance after shutdown; and maneuvering to the sep attitude, we went through checkout load NOUN 17 and NOUN 22. There was again no noticeable pogo. The S-IVB sounded and performed just like it did on the insertion phase burn and I'll let the CMP pick up the separation and the transposition and docking.
003:42:43|Technical Debriefing|CDR|As I recall, we undocked and separated just a little earlier than had tentatively been planned, but that was no problem because we were ready to do it.
003:42:43|Technical Debriefing|CMP|As far as the separation from the SLA, it was nominal. There's a louder bang than I expected from pyros.
003:42:43|Technical Debriefing|CDR|Translunar/transearth - After CSM separation from the booster and docking with the LM several hours later, we could see something which may have been the S-IVB or SLA panels. As soon as we turned around for docking I could see three of the four SLA panels tumbling slowly in space. This is not unusual. That's been seen before.
003:42:43|Technical Debriefing|CMP|I never did see a SLA panel.
003:42:43|Technical Debriefing|CDR|There seemed to be an awful lot of particles with us continually throughout the flight, both in transearth and translunar coast and in lunar orbit. These particles were obviously residue from the RCS. Others were from dumped residues. They seemed to be hanging around the LM as a result of pulling in and out of the S-IVB and they were always small particles. Some, initially, were pieces of Mylar from the S-IVB LM separation. The others were just like small dump crystals or residue. On the LM, particularly, when you fire the RCS you could see the RCS residue.
003:42:43|Technical Debriefing|CMP|That residue from the RCS didn't look a lot different than a waste-water dump.
003:42:43|Technical Debriefing|CDR|That's right, except that it's less dense.
003:49:05|Technical Debriefing|CMP|This is the first time that I really noticed that in the plus-X translations, or in any translations as far as that goes, you get about 0.4 degrees per second rates within the dead band. As opposed to the simulator, it has about 0.1 degrees per second on any of the translations maintaining attitude.
003:49:05|Technical Debriefing|CMP|Formation flight was great. The S-IVB by itself was as steady as a rock out there. No problems. I couldn't tell it was dead banding or moving at all. I came in relatively slow, about 0.1 ft/sec, somewhere in that area.
003:57:31|Technical Debriefing|CMP|Docking was nominal. As soon as he got capture on the thing, there were no rates. Everything was steady. I didn't have to handle the translation controls or null rates at all. We went directly to hard dock. There's more spacecraft movement during that period because I feel that the COAS and the docking target were off a little bit. And I don't say misaligned, but it's a little bit off. But, of course, it was in limits and was no problem.
003:57:31|Technical Debriefing|CDR|When we went to retract, we got our big ripple fire - bang on the latches, so we had a relatively good hard dock. We only got one gray indication on the talkbacks. The other one was barber pole.
003:57:31|Technical Debriefing|LMP|There's a lot of descriptive material, I think, in the transcript on that. As I recall, we got two pulses in the ripple fire. It seemed like there was one or two latches and then the ripple fire.
003:57:31|Technical Debriefing|CDR|I just recall a woomph!
003:57:31|Technical Debriefing|LMP|I think, if you look at the transcript, we said that there were two pulses to it.
004:26:25|Technical Debriefing|CDR|Subsequent inspection of the latches showed that there were three latches which were not made entirely. One of them, as I recall, had to be recocked. Anyway, it turned out that once we got those three latches (which at that time looked like they were operating properly) reset, we got two barber poles on the talkbacks. Ultimately, latch 4 was found to be unseated on the ring, although, at that time, it looked nominal.
004:46:17|Technical Debriefing|CDR|The attitudes given us were excellent; we were able to watch the S-IVB maneuver. We were able to see the S-IVB vent and it all went well and nominal.
004:46:17|Technical Debriefing|LMP|It was very clean as far as any debris or anything coming out during the docking phase, and I could see a few little things that were bouncing around inside around the LM, particles of some kind. It was nothing like previous flights where they had a lot of debris. It was very clean.
004:59:37|ALSJ||While they waited for the S-IVB burn, Cernan reported that, while he knew "we're not the first to discover this, but we'd like to confirm, from the crew of Apollo 17, that the world is round." In the two hours since the TLI burn, they had moved out far enough - about 16,600 miles - that they could see the whole Earth. Because of the Moon's position in its orbit, they were south of the terrestrial equator, over the southern tip of Africa, and had no trouble seeing Antarctica. The Earth was nearly full and, at 30,000 miles, they took a stunning portrait of the planet.
005:51:02|Technical Debriefing|LMP|Partly, I used try glasses because they do have a small correction for my astigmatism, and that did increase the resolution with which I could view the surface. Looking at the Earth and translunar coast with the sunglasses, I often did that for the correction. I used the binocular and the sunglasses and it did seem to help the resolution of viewing cloud patterns and geographic locations. When I used the sunglasses they seemed to be very adequate in terms of the level in which they reduced the brightness. As soon as I looked in the cabin to look at instruments and this sort of thing, the glasses did inhibit the observation of those instruments and the lettering on the panels, and I would push them up on my forehead for cabin work.
005:52:25|ALSJ||Throughout the outbound journey, they had a good view back toward Earth. Schmitt, in particular, provided lengthy and detailed weather reports, complete with predictions. His first report, given while Cernan and Evans were getting out of their suits, went on for a full half hour and, as the Earth turned beneath them, he could update his predictions for various parts of the world. Later in the mission, CapCom Gordo Fullerton told him, "You're a regular human weather satellite."
009:00:00|ALSJ||Nine hours into the mission, they were ready to sleep. Cernan wore a headset in case Houston needed to talk; and he also wore biomedical sensors so that the flight surgeon could watch his heart rate and other vital signs. On this first night, none of them got more than about three hours of sound sleep but, for the next few days, the work load would be relatively light and there would be plenty of time to get adequate rest.
015:02:45|ALSJ||On the morning of this second day, Houston was ready to discuss a reset of the mission clocks so that when they got to lunar orbit at the pre-planned time, the clock time would agree with the times printed in the flight plan. In essence, they needed to add two hours and forty minutes to the actual elapsed time and Houston was looking for a spot in the flight plan where the reset could be done without significant disruption. Their first thought was to do the whole correction at 65 hours. However, the choice would shorten that work day from 16 hours to 13 1/3 hours and, after some thought, Houston decided that it would be best to modify the schedule in two stages and avoid any more disruption of the sleep/wake cycle than was already necessary. Between 46 and 65 hours after the actual launch, they would move all activities up one hour. That is, they would do the activities scheduled at 52 hours at 51 hours of elapsed time. Then, at 65 hours they would set the clocks forward to 67:40. It was a bit confusing, even to the crew, but it avoided two clock changes and, because there were to be relatively few things going on between 46 and 65 hours, there would be only a few pencil changes in the flight plan.
021:28:24|ALSJ||About six hours after their first wake-up in space, Schmitt got down under one of the couches and, by holding onto one of the struts, was able to get some exercise by running in place on the bulkhead of what was called the Lower Equipment Bay. Before starting, his heart rate had been about 60 beats per minute and, much to the surgeon's pleasure, he was able to get his rate up to about 140. What is more, the engineers reported that he shook the spacecraft hard enough to stir the liquid oxygen in the Service Module tanks. Each of the tanks contained a fan and, when the fan wasn't running, heat losses at the walls created temperature gradients in the tank, a circumstance that the engineers wanted to avoid. By exercising, Schmitt had saved them the trouble of turning on the fan, thereby saving a little spacecraft power.
025:26:26|ALSJ||The second day was purposefully short. The landing was scheduled for about 2:30 p.m., Florida time, and the crew was then going to do a full EVA before getting to bed. They wanted to wake up on landing day at about 7:30 a.m., Florida time, and it had been decided that, after the disruption of their sleep cycle caused by the night launch, it would be best to get back to a morning wake-up as early in the flight as possible. After launching, they hadn't gotten to sleep until it was about dawn at the Cape, and then their first wake-up came at about 3:30 in the afternoon. However, by having only a ten-hour second day, they were asleep by 1:30 a.m. Florida time and could wake up at 9:30 a.m. with most of the adjustment already made and with three more sleep periods to go before landing day. With the help of a Seconal sleeping tablet, each of them got 7 1/2 hours of sound sleep on their second night in space and awoke feeling well rested and ready to go.
034:10:19|ALSJ||By now, they were a bit over half way to the Moon, about 125,000 miles out from Earth and the spacecraft was working beautifully. They had been consuming maneuvering fuel, water, oxygen, and electric power at very close to the predicted rates; and they were being conscientious about eating and drinking enough to keep the surgeon happy. After Schmitt reported on the weather for southern Africa and Argentina, Fullerton read a news summary that included items such as the ongoing negotiations in Paris between the United States and North Vietnam, the medical condition of former President Harry Truman, and the start of the Texas state high school football playoffs.
035:30:00|ALSJ||The first big event of the day was a midcourse trajectory correction which came about two hours after wake up, an exceedingly modest two-second burn of the Service Module Engine.
042:59:32|ALSJ||The crew ran a small, self-contained, heat-flow-and-convection experiment which proved to be so fascinating that Houston had to remind them to take care of some other items in the checklist. Schmitt thought that it was the best Saturday afternoon matinee he'd seen in a long time and wished that they'd had some popcorn.
056:35:40|ALSJ||For this third rest period, Houston gave the crew of Apollo 17 a full eight hours and, for the first time in the mission, Fullerton had to wake the crew out of a sound sleep. As a wake-up call, he used the stirring strains of the Jayhawk Fight Song, in honor of Ron Evans' alma mater, the University of Kansas. It was going to be another quiet day and Schmitt thought their only problem was going to be keeping Evans from going back to sleep.
059:57:53|ALSJ||Schmitt got back in the LM and powered it up for about a half hour so that Houston could take a look at the telemetry system. He made another brief check of the comm system and, as Houston had expected after thinking about things overnight, the previous day's problems were confirmed as being problems on the ground, rather than in the spacecraft.
063:10:15|ALSJ||While they got ready for lunch, Cernan took a look back at Earth, conscious that this would be the last trip anyone would make out this far for some time to come. He told Houston "You can look right down at the Cape area - that's the Cape that we know, in Florida - and it's a little disheartening because the last time I was up here (on Apollo 10) looking back from this angle, they were moving another Saturn V for another Moon trip out on the pad already."
063:49:46|ALSJ||The preparations for lunch took a bit longer than usual and the reason was that Evans couldn't find his scissors. The food, much of it dehydrated, was sealed in tough plastic bags. Each of them carried a pair of good quality surgical scissors so that they could cut the bags and get at the food. Without his scissors, Evans would get mighty hungry and his one hope, short of finding his own, was that Cernan or Schmitt would lend him a pair while they were down on the surface. After some joking about his predicament, they agreed to leave a pair behind.
065:00:00|ALSJ||After lunch, it was time to reset the clocks. Fullerton read them an explanation written for the press by the Public Affairs Office and, if possible, it was worse than what I wrote for this summary. Certainly Fullerton and the crew had a good chuckle over it. The important point was that, after lunch, they were 65 hours into the mission but had completed all the planned activities up to 67:40. Now, they could change the clocks and, from then on, behave as though they had launched on time.
068:07:51|ALSJ||ALFMED (Apollo Light Flash Moving Emulsion Detector). On early missions, various astronauts had reported that, with their eyes closed, they sometimes saw brief streaks of light. The most reasonable explanation is that their retinas were being triggered by cosmic rays and, to test the hypothesis, Evans donned a helmet that covered his eyes and also contained slowly-moving plates of photographic film that would record any cosmic rays entering his head. He wore the detector for an hour and reported all of the flashes that he saw. These were later compared with the film record. As a control, Cernan wore a blindfold and also reported any light flashes he saw. It took Evans and Cernan about fifteen minutes to get sufficiently dark adapted that they began seeing flashes. Thereafter, they reported events about once every 2 1/2 minutes.
081:31:00|ALSJ||Cernan was the first up on Day 5. Houston had decided to give the crew an extra half hour of rest, but the Commander was awake before Houston could send a wake-up call. On this night, he hadn't taken a Seconal and had still managed about 5 hours of good sleep. Schmitt had taken a tablet in order to get to sleep and had slept soundly for over seven hours. Evans had also taken a Seconal but said that he thought he'd tossed and turned most of the night. However, the surgeon said that, although his periods of restlessness had been evident in the biomed data, none had been any longer than about ten minutes and it looked as though he'd gotten about 7 hours of good sleep.
084:12:53|ALSJ||During launch from Earth and during the coast out to the Moon, the SIM Bay had been covered with a protective panel; but, now that the spacecraft was approaching lunar orbit, the experimenters were eager to get data and it was time to jettison the SIM Bay door.
084:42:47|ALSJ||By later standards, the on-board Apollo computers were fairly primitive. The crew sometimes had to enter data (called Nouns) manually on a keyboard and then tell the computer what actions (called Verbs) to take. Memory was limited, although there was room for enough information that the computer could fly the nominal flight plan without minute by minute instructions from the crew. Houston could feed data for normal flight procedures directly into the computer when the crew set it up in Program 00 (called "pooh" for short) and put it in the Accept mode. For emergency purposes - say if they had to abort the mission and had lost communications with Earth - Houston occasional read up data "pads" which Schmitt then wrote into the appropriate blank spaces in the Flight Plan book. Because of the launch delay and the usual slight deviations of the trajectory from the planned path, Houston had a great deal of data to read up. Thanks to long hours of repeated practice, Schmitt and the ground team got the work done smoothly and without error. Slowly, Fullerton would read up a block of data and then Schmitt would read back what he had written before they moved on to the next block.
086:46:30|ALSJ||All through the journey out from Earth, the crew had gotten a good view of Earth. As we have discussed, during the early hours of the mission they had been treated to a nearly full Earth. By now, their trajectory had carried them to a point where the Earth was about two-thirds full. Most of the time, they had been flying the spacecraft with its long axis oriented perpendicular to the Sun, slowly rotating around that axis so that all parts of the spacecraft would be heated uniformly. Informally, this was called the Barbecue mode or, in formal NASA-ese, the Passive Thermal Control (PTC) mode. There were five windows: one over each of the seats that gave a view more or less at right-angles to the long axis, and two others that gave a view forward for use during rendezvous and docking. For about two-thirds of each spacecraft rotation they had a good view of Earth. During the other half of each rotation, they had, in principle, a view of the Moon. However, because they were going to be landing at an eastern site just after local dawn, the Sun had been behind the Moon throughout most of the flight out from Earth. Therefore, the side of the Moon that they could see, the Nearside that always faces Earth, was in darkness and it wasn't until they got close that the perspective changed enough to see any of the sunlit portions. At a mission time of 86:46 - according to the reset clocks - Cernan reported their first view of the Moon.
086:47:03|ALSJ||They were only about 5000 miles out and the Moon looked so big that Cernan had the impression that they were "coming right down on top of it". Half jokingly, he asked Fullerton if the tracking people were sure that they were going to miss the edge. Was the low point really going to be 73 miles as planned?
086:52:01|ALSJ||They had to shield their eyes to see the Moon because, at the moment, the Sun was sitting right on the lunar horizon.
087:51:04|ALSJ||Although Cernan had been to the Moon before, on the Apollo 10 approach the western Nearside limb had been in darkness and the final hours hadn't been so visually dramatic. Cernan remembered that, on Apollo 10, he'd been impressed with how fast they seemed to be climbing away when they left lunar orbit for the trip home and, also, that he'd wondered what it would be like coming in that fast toward a surface he could see. Now he knew. Fortunately, there was plenty of work - and a great deal of pure professionalism - to protect him and the others from the full psychological impact of their seeming headlong rush.
087:51:04|ALSJ|Schmitt|Until I was going through my set of pictures, that I eventually gave to the University of New Mexico, and saw some pictures that Gene had taken, my memory was that we didn't see the Moon during the final approach. And I still don't have a personal recollection of looking at the illuminated edge of the Moon. Not a strong one, anyway. But I think that's because Gene was in the seat to do that. We were not in barbecue. We were in the attitude-hold mode. And he was in the position to see it and I wasn't. I may have glanced at it once. In fact, the more I talk about it, the more I think I remember him saying 'Come over and look at this'. But, for a long time, I didn't have any recollection of seeing any part of an illuminated Moon as we came in.
087:51:04|ALSJ|Cernan|Jack and Ron, never having had the opportunity to see what I saw on Apollo 10, can't appreciate the approach to the Moon that we had. I don't think anybody in any of the missions had this approach. I think everybody, starting with Apollo 8, went into darkness in the shadow of the Moon, and got on their back and, at a predetermined time, fired the CSM engine - in darkness and upside down and going backwards - and then, all of a sudden - maybe five minutes, maybe ten minutes later - we'd come out of darkness at fifty miles or thereabouts above the surface and it's 'WOW! Look at those craters. There it is. Man.' It's just like instant sunlight and we're THERE! I mean, it's like we've been flying in the darkness to rendezvous with this thing we can't see (meaning the Moon) - and we know we're close because we're in the shadow - and all of a sudden, WHAM, someone turns the lights on. And then the next major thing is to come around and see the Earthrise. Now, on Apollo 17 - and nobody told me it was going to happen - we went through the darkness and came out into sunlight before we got to the Moon. And we were coming in on this damn target and we were seeing, to start with, just a sliver, just a slice of the Moon. And then we started to see more of it as we snuck around behind it. And it's getting big so fast you can't believe it. And I'm telling you, you talk about rolling over on your back and making a dive bombing run at some point some 50 or 60 miles above the surface! That was the most spectacular entry into lunar orbit. And I don't think anyone appreciates it! Except me! I don't think any of the other flights ever saw that. And I don't think Jack and Ron appreciated because I've got a feeling they thought it was supposed to be like that all the time.
088:43:38|ALSJ||Now they were only 2660 miles out and had been accelerated by lunar gravity to 5000 feet per second. Cernan had the monocular out and, when the Moon was in view, got a good look into some of the larger craters on the illuminated edge. But then it was time to change the spacecraft orientation so that the big Service Module Engine would be pointed in the right direction when they swept down to their low point over the Farside. Half an hour before lunar gravity swept them around the west limb and out of radio contact with Earth, they had the linked CSM/LM re-oriented. Looking back past the LM, they could see the Earth. LOS (loss of signal) came at 88:43:21 and, eleven minutes later, the LOI (Lunar Orbit Insertion) burn to put them in a lunar orbit with a low point of 53 miles and a high point of 170 miles.
089:41:34|ALSJ||On their first pass over the landing site, the area was in darkness and, because they had just gone through the dawn terminator a few moments before and still had the Sun shining in the spacecraft windows, Earthlight was of no help. By the time they came around again, the Sun would be up at Taurus-Littrow; but, first there was another burn to perform to put themselves in the proper orbit for the next day's descent. On this first pass over the Nearside and on the next as well, Houston took a careful look at the tracking data so that the burn parameters could be fine-tuned.
089:57:48|ALSJ||While Houston was busy, the crew had an opportunity to admire the view and, throughout most of the Nearside pass, Schmitt gave a running commentary about the lunar surface below. Because they were near the high point of their initial orbit as they passed over the landing site, the Sun didn't go below their horizon for another ten minutes. But soon, thereafter, they began to pick out detail in the Earthshine. Because the Earth was virtually overhead throughout most of the Nearside pass, there weren't any Earthshine shadows to delineate the hills and holes until they had completed most of the Nearside pass. However, even without Earthshine shadows, they could see differences in albedo, differences in the degree to which the surface materials reflected the Earthshine. As an example, the bright rays emanating from the young crater Copernicus stood out quite well.
091:24:34|ALSJ||By the time the crew re-emerged from behind the Moon again, Houston had the new data ready. Cernan configured the computer so that it could accept the uplinked data while Schmitt copied additional information that Fullerton read up. There was a great deal to be copied and Schmitt and Fullerton didn't finish until just before the second pass over the landing site. Down below, the shadows were very long. The North Massif was almost completely shadowed by the Sculptured Hills and there was little that was visible out on the valley floor. The only exception was the section of the Scarp near the crater Lara which, because it is highly reflective and was sloped toward the Sun, stood out quite prominently.
092:49:03|ALSJ||For the rest of the orbit, the crew of Apollo 17 kept busy preparing for the burn that would put them in what was called the Descent Orbit. On the early missions, the CSM flew a 60-mile-high circular orbit and LM fuel was used to take the lander down, first, into a 15 by 60 mile orbit and then to the surface. However, beginning with Apollo 14 and in preparation for landing the heavy J-mission LMs, the mission profile was changed so that, prior to separation, CSM fuel was used to put both spacecraft in the 15 by 60 mile orbit. Consequently, at the end of their second orbit, when they were once again down to about 53 miles above the lunar surface, the crew of Apollo 17 fired the Service engine and changed the orbit from 53 by 170 to 59 by 15, with the low point now just east of the landing site.
105:47:28|ALSJ||Landing day. If all went well and they got down on time and got the EVA started promptly, it was still going to be a 22 1/2 hour day from wake up to bedtime. Cernan and Schmitt had decided that there would be no point in a short landing day and a sleep period before going out. They were well-rested and fit. And there was no doubt that the Moon would hold their interest. The wake-up call for landing day was the John Denver version of the Steve Goodman song, The City of New Orleans, with its chorus of "Good morning, America, how are ya?" It is a happy song that had been suggested by people on the night shift in the press room - a song that matched the mood of the crew and, indeed, country-music-fan Schmitt requested a replay while he and the others finished waking up. Each of them had taken a Seconal; and Cernan and Schmitt, at least, had slept very soundly.
106:02:40|ALSJ||LOS at the end of the ninth orbit came only ten minutes after wake-up and, by the time Apollo 17 had re-appeared forty five minutes later, the astronauts were getting the tunnel cleared and were getting into their suits. They'd had a very quick breakfast.
107:59:32|ALSJ||Check out of the LM went quickly and smoothly; and, not long after AOS (Acquisition of Signal) on the eleventh orbit, Evans was in his suit and was busily sealing up the tunnel in preparation for undocking. As one of the last items, all three of them donned their helmets and gloves and performed pressure checks. They would perform the maneuvers unpressurized for the simple reason that their dexterity was limited in an inflated suit. However, they wanted to make sure that, in an emergency, the suits would inflate and stay inflated as long as necessary.
109:53:48|ALSJ||As planned, the crew undocked the two spacecraft during the Farside pass at the beginning of the 12th orbit. For the next hour and a half, the two spacecraft flew close to one another so that the astronauts could make visual inspections and perform final checks of systems. Later in the orbit, just before LOS, Evans fired the Service Engine to boost himself back up into a 60-mile circular orbit so that, in the event of an aborted landing, he would be in an optimal position for a rendezvous. As seemed usual in Apollo, the crew had a little trouble getting contact with Earth through the LM's steerable, high-gain antenna but, otherwise, Challenger was ready for the landing.
110:47:34|ALSJ||Cernan and Schmitt pressurized the propellant tanks and, a few minutes later, made their last pass over Taurus-Littrow prior to the descent. Evans had not yet made his circularization burn and was ahead and slightly below them. It was a spectacular, oblique view of the valley. They were less than fifteen miles away, and the LM crew took a couple of color pictures. Cernan was particularly interested in the small group of craters that surrounded his target point, and he called out the names as he found them.
111:48:04|ALSJ||Evans did his circularization burn and, five minutes later, the LM crew did a more modest burn to move the low point of their orbit down to 10 1/2 miles over a point east of the landing site.
112:36:13|ALSJ||At AOS on the 13th orbit, Evans reappeared first and confirmed that the LM burn had gone well. And then, once Houston had a bit more tracking data with which to update the LM computer, everything was ready for the landing.
112:47:52|ALSJ||They are making final preparations for the powered descent to the lunar surface.
112:48:00|ALSJ||By turning on the Master Arm switch, they are enabling activation of @alsjurl/tnD7141ApPyrotchnc.html"@alsjt>explosive devices</a> with which they will open the fuel valves in the Descent Stage and others which would allow them to discard the Descent Stage in the event that they have to abort the landing and use the ascent stage to return to orbit. "Two good lights" refers to redundant pair of circuits.
112:48:00|ALSJ||David Woods has provided scans of pages 15 ( @alsjurl/a15/A15LMCueCardsp15.jpg"@alsjt>1.0Mb</a> ) and 16 ( @alsjurl/a15/A15LMCueCardsp16.jpg"@alsjt>1.0Mb</a> ) from the @alsjurl/a15/a15LMCueCrds.htm"@alsjt>Apollo 15 Lunar Module Cue Cards</a>, which cover various abort scenarios. On page 16, for a return to orbit using either the descent engine (lefthand column) or the ascent engine (righthand collumn), The Commander would check the position of the Guidance Switch and then push either the Abort button for a return to orbit using the descent engine or Abort Stage button for a return using the ascent engine.
112:48:01|ALSJ||The LM has two navigation systems: the Primary Guidance and Navigation System (PGNS), pronounced "pings", and the less capable Abort Guidance System (@alsjurl/tnD7990LM_AGS.html"@alsjt>AGS</a>), pronounced "ags" The AGS would only be used for guidance purposes in the event of a PGNS failure. In that case, mission rules call for an abort of the descent and a return to orbit. Under normal conditions, the AGS was used to double check the performance of the PGNS and, as Gene discusses below, it is an open question as to whether or not he would have aborted the landing in the final stages if the PGNS had failed and he was getting good AGS data.
112:48:01|ALSJ||Gene will next go down the list of critical events that will precede and immediately follow ignition. He and Jack have practiced this most critical phase of the mission many times; nonetheless, Gene is making absolutely sure that they both remember exactly who is going to handle each of the tasks. The terms are defined below as the events occur.
112:48:22|ALSJ||Batteries number 3 and 4 in the Descent Stage are hooked up in parallel and should be showing the same voltage. However, during battery warm-up in preparation for the descent, it was noticed that they had a voltage difference of about 0.5 volts. Although there are no other indications of a problem, Houston wants to take battery 3 off-line while they look at the performance of the electrical system. They will bring it back on-line at 112:55:13.
112:49:19|ALSJ||Gene uses the Display and Keyboard Assembly (@alsjurl/apollo.glossary.html#DSKY"@alsjt>DSKY</a>) to enter data and commands into the PGNS. It is located at his right hand, over the hatch. Jack uses the Data Entry and Display Assembly (DEDA) to monitor the @alsjurl/tnD7990LM_AGS.html"@alsjt>AGS</a> and, later in the descent, to enter trajectory corrections.
112:49:22|ALSJ|CDR|When you go into something as dynamic as an engine burn, you get major fluctuations in the accelerometers and, to navigate effectively, you have to average the accelerations over a finite period of time.
112:49:22|ALSJ||In February 2009, Journal Contributor Paul Fjeld pointed out that Gene was mistaken about average g. See the discussion linked @alsjurl/alsj-average_g.html"@alsjt>here</a>.
112:49:31|ALSJ||In other contexts, "ullage" is the empty portion of a cask. Here, the word is used to describe a 7.5 second firing of the Reaction Control System (RCS) in order to settle fuel in the tanks prior to ignition.
112:49:31|ALSJ|CDR|At ignition, the tanks were about three quarters full of fuel and one quarter pressurized helium. The trouble was that, in zero gravity, you didn't know where the fuel was in the tank. Therefore, you had to apply a little acceleration and drive the heavy (that is, denser) fuel downward towards the outlet, towards the engine, so that, when you started the main engine you don't get a fistful of helium. Because we were flying with the landing gear and the main engine forward, to get proper ullage we had to fire the RCS jets briefly against that forward motion. We had the computer programmed to fire the thrusters for a few seconds prior to ignition; but, if Jack hadn't confirmed ullage, I would have used the handcontroller to give us manual ullage.
112:49:51|ALSJ|LMP|Having gotten ullage, we pushed the computer's Proceed button which told it to continue with engine ignition.
112:49:51|ALSJ||Journal Contributor David Woods writes, "The software was written such that if the computer needed an input from the crew to allow it to proceed with its next function, it flashed a '99' in the display. The crew pressed the 'Proceed' button and the computer continued. This was usually used in the context of an engine ignition, as in 'Do you really want me to go ahead and light this thing?'.
112:49:51|ALSJ||Gene is prepared to do a manual backup of the engine ignition.
112:49:57|ALSJ||The @alsjurl/LM6_C&D_Panel1CW.jpg"@alsjt>Descent Quantity Light</a> is an indication of an inadequate fuel supply. In this case, it is a false warning. Gene discusses his reaction to the warning at 113:11:55, after the landing.
112:50:10|ALSJ||We have been unable to translate "DPC" or find it in any list of Apollo acronyms. Undoubtedly, "DP" is "Descent Propulsion" and it is entirely possible that Jack got momentarily tongue-tied as he checked the propellant tanks and meant to say DPS for Descent Propulsion System.
112:50:10|ALSJ|LMP|Probably, I was doing a quick check to make sure the tank pressures were okay. Evidently, the Quantity Light was giving a false warning.
112:50:11|ALSJ||For the first 26 seconds of the burn, the engine is fired at minimum thrust - about 10% of full thrust - so that the engine gimbal can be adjusted to put the thrust axis directly through the center of gravity. At throttle up, the engine is switched to full thrust, where it will remain until the last couple of minutes of the descent.
112:50:23|ALSJ|CDR|Once you get into the computers, it's like riding a bicycle. Maybe you change to a different kind of bicycle, but it's still easy enough to learn. Long before we flew Apollo 17, I had gotten very comfortable with all of the computer systems. I had flown on @alsjurl/a410/images10.html#69H650"@alsjt>Apollo 10 as Lunar Module Pilot</a> and, on that mission, was responsible for a lot of things as far as computers were concerned, especially the @alsjurl/tnD7990LM_AGS.html"@alsjt>AGS</a>. Along with Tom Stafford, I also got to know the main computer to the point that I could sleep with it. After that flight I backed up Apollo 14. The morning of the Apollo 14 launch, I was ready to fly; and I knew those computers cold. And then came Apollo 17.
112:50:23|ALSJ|CDR|The entry pad for the (PGNS) computer was between the two of us, by my right hand, just above the hatch. However, because of some experiences I had on Apollo 10 and so forth, I told Jack that, with very few exceptions, we weren't both going to be punching buttons on that main computer. On Apollo 10, Tom Stafford and I had had some trouble with the sort of situation where you think the computer's got one command and someone gives it another. Because of that, I told Jack that I was going to enter the commands and he was going to monitor me to make sure I did the right ones. He was going to run the AGS computer (with the DEDA, see below); but we weren't going to both be punching buttons.
112:50:29|ALSJ||They are flying with their backs parallel to the lunar surface below them and their feet pointing in the direction of motion. Attitudes are being measured relative to the landing site. At the landing site, pitch is zero when the spacecraft is oriented vertically and would be 90 degrees if they were flying over the site parallel to the surface with their feet forward. At PDI, they are about 18 degrees east of the landing site and the local horizontal plane is tipped down 18 degrees to the east compared with the horizontal reference plane at the landing site. Consequently, the LM pitch measured in the landing site reference system is 108.
112:50:39|ALSJ|LMP|The two, separate guidance systems had been initialized to the same data at some point prior to ignition. The @alsjurl/tnD7990LM_AGS.html"@alsjt>AGS</a> had some strapped-down gyros and wasn't as accurate as the PGNS; but, if the primary system failed, the AGS was certainly accurate enough to get us back to orbit. Here, I am checking to see that the two systems are in satisfactory agreement. Sometime prior to the mission I had worked out a way to update the AGS's knowledge of altitude by inputting a value from the @alsjurl/alsj-LMRadars.html"@alsjt>radar</a> data as soon as that became available. We'll see that later. LMPs were always trying to get the AGS to the point that, if you had to, you could land with it.
112:50:39|ALSJ|CDR|We used to play around in the @alsjurl/tnD7112Simulators.html"@alsjt>simulator</a> to see if the AGS gave us enough information to land; and, quite honestly, if we were close I think we could have landed. There was a mission rule, as I remember, that we wouldn't land if we had a primary guidance failure. But one thing that people never paid much attention to is that, for most of the flight - and this is one very visible point - the ground has no control over what you're doing. They can send up information; but you're in command, you're flying the machine, and you're making the decisions. So who is to know what decision would have been made if you were down around three or four hundred feet or six hundred feet or a thousand feet and you had a question about your primary navigation system but your abort navigation system looked good. The AGS didn't have the @alsjurl/alsj-LMRadars.html"@alsjt>landing radar</a> tied into it, but it was giving you descent information and you could use those pieces separately. And who knows whether you would have landed or not. We didn't want to go that far and not land because of a computer problem.
112:50:47|ALSJ||H-dot is the descent rate, the time derivative of the altitude. They are descending faster than planned; hence, H-dot is high. The reason for this is that they are above the planned trajectory and the computer is bringing them down to it.
112:51:03|ALSJ||Fullerton is giving them a target update. According to tracking data, the LM is headed for a point 3400 feet short of the planned landing site. Because this is a substantial error, Gene will enter a correction into the first register of Noun 69 ('169' in Apollo shorthand) in the computer so that it can modify the descent trajectory and put them on target. Jack will verify the entry.
112:51:11|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Paul Fjeld notes that the ability to update the LM targeting "was added on Apollo 12. DLAND - Noun 69 - was a dangerous vector! It was added to the Position of the landing site (RLS) <b>every</b> 2-second cycle, then zeroed. The crew had to verify that the three registers were all balls (all zero), then only put the Delta-Z value (downrange change in position) in R1, then only press enter when MCC looked at the DSKY downlist to verify that the number was good. Noun 69 was one of the easiest opportunities for the crew to kill themselves.
112:51:17|ALSJ||This clip was prepared by Colin Mackellar from recordings made at Honeysuckle Creek from Net 1 and provided by HSK Receiver Operator Alan Foster. The audio quaility is a bit better than the digitizations done from audio cassettes provided in 1989 by NASA Johnson.
112:51:27|ALSJ|CDR|The ground couldn't fly the spacecraft or do anything with it, but they could read a lot of the data out. While I keyed the new data into the computer and Jack verified it on-board, they could also read it and verify it on the ground. Normally, they'd look at it and verify it before we'd go ahead and actually execute whatever command or (enter) whatever data they'd given us.
112:51:29|ALSJ||They are one minute and thirty seconds into the burn and are at an altitude of 57 thousand feet, or about 17 kilometers, above the lunar surface.
112:51:31|ALSJ|CDR|We had an inertial attitude gyro, like in an airplane, which we called the "eight ball" or simply the "ball". It was essentially fixed in space and we would rotate the spacecraft around it. With the LM sitting on the lunar surface, the ball would have shown a pitch of zero degrees; and, while we were in the initial descent and lying on our backs with our feet forward, looking up at the sky and slowing down, it would show about 90 degrees or maybe even 108, depending on the trajectory. As we drifted in, we slowly pitched upright until, at 60 or 70 degrees pitch and 7000 feet altitude, we'd go through the big pitchover.
112:51:51|ALSJ||PQGS is the Propellant Quantity Gauging System. Cycling the switch will let them see if the quantity warning light is real.
112:52:31|ALSJ||That is, the AGS is showing them north of the planned ground track. Jack will ask the question again in about 2 minutes.
112:53:35|ALSJ||In the last two minutes, the altitude error has decreased from 7000 feet to 2500 feet and has closed, therefore, at a rate of 40 feet per second. At PDI, they were about 30 degrees of longitude east of what would have been the closest approach to the surface (perilune) of their pre-PDI orbit. Being east of the perilune, they were already descending toward the surface at a rate of about 67 fps - a rate which would have slowed in the absence of the burn - and they had planned to maintain that rate of 67 fps for the first seven minutes of the burn. Having started out above the planned trajectory, their total rate of descent has been a bit above 100 fps.
112:53:56|ALSJ|LMP|There was a tapemeter display for showing the radar data - altitude and altitude rate (H-dot) - when that became available. Physically, it was a pair of tapes with numbers on them which moved up and down behind a needle.
112:53:56|ALSJ|CDR|We had so many rate needles that it's a little hard to remember; but we could change them to show a lot of things like altitude and altitude rates. I think we could change this particular @alsjurl/alsj-Tapemeters.html"@alsjt>tapemeter</a> (which was next to the "@alsjurl/alsj-FDAI.html"@alsjt>8-ball</a>" attitude indicator on Gene's side of the spacecraft) showed either the radar data or the computer's best guess about the altitude and altitude rate.
112:53:59|ALSJ||These are batteries that supply electricity to the @alsjurl/tnD7141ApPyrotchnc.html"@alsjt>explosive devices</a> which would separate the Ascent Stage from the Descent Stage in the event of an aborted landing attempt using the ascent stage to return to orbit. Jack will check the batteries periodically.
112:54:11|ALSJ||See Gene's comment at 112:56:33. This yaw maneuver - a rotation around the thrust axis - is designed to put the @alsjurl/alsj-LMRadars.html"@alsjt>landing radar</a> in optimum position. Prior to ignition, they had the spacecraft yawed left by 70 degrees for optimum communications with Earth and are now reducing that to 20 degrees left. Once they get down to an altitude of 30,000 feet, they will go to a zero-yaw, windows-up attitude for the landing.
112:54:15|ALSJ||The radar has acquired the lunar surface.
112:54:26|ALSJ|LMP|This was the difference between the radar altitude and the PGNS calculated altitude
112:54:34|ALSJ|LMP|Verb 57 allowed the radar data to be incorporated into the computer.
112:54:42|ALSJ|CDR|We had gone into lunar orbit in the CSM on a path that went from northeast to southwest across the front face of the Moon. That track took the Command Module over the @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22465"@alsjt>landing site</a> but wasn't exactly the right path for the final approach. So we flew the LM a little south out of the CSM orbital plane so that we could line up with our runway, so to speak, down the axis of the valley.
112:54:58|ALSJ||Fullerton will give them a fuller explanation of the out-of-plane indication at @alsjurl/a17/a17.launch.html#1874010"@alsjt>187:40:10</a>, just prior to launch.
112:55:04|ALSJ|CDR|We landed so far east and north that the Earth was in the southwestern sky above the mountains. Every other flight landed where the Earth was essentially overhead; so ours was unique in that, during our descent, we were looking right at the Earth as we were coming down in the valley. As those mountains rose above us, we were looking at the Earth - I mean - right smack in front of us! We didn't have to look up at it; it was right there. Can you imagine coming down, thirty-six thousand feet above the lunar surface and all of a sudden, almost nonchalantly, saying that you've got the Earth right out the front window? And all the other things going on at the same time?
112:55:22|ALSJ||They are about fifty miles from the landing site.
112:55:28|ALSJ||Their average descent rate during these 5.5 minutes has been 100 fps, with about 30 fps of the total due to the descent to the planned trajectory. Now, they are on the nominal flight path and Jack's "we want to keep it high" may be a reference either to the fact that the rate will start to increase again once they get down to about 32,000 feet or to the altitude/altitude rate chart he has been consulting. If this is a reference to the chart, he may be saying that they want to stay in the constant rate portion of the graph for a while longer.
112:55:45|ALSJ|CDR|Jack couldn't spend much time looking out the window. He went through the whole landing and hardly had a chance to see where we were going, because he was looking at fuel and oxidizer gauges, looking at battery currents, updating the @alsjurl/tnD7990LM_AGS.html"@alsjt>AGS</a> computer, verifying my entries in the PGNS, and writing things down. So he was very busy inside the cockpit and probably stole a glance or two outside. I had to look outside. Actually, I had to look both places - inside and outside - but my primary focus was out the window and on all of the attitude and rate indicators that surrounded the window. My peripheral scan was forward, out the window, and to the instruments that surrounded it, and occasionally down to the computer when I had to execute a command with it. But poor Jack had to keep his head buried in the cockpit.
112:55:57|ALSJ||They are 40 miles east of the landing site.
112:56:16|ALSJ|CDR|The PGNS was keeping track of our altitude relative to the landing site while the radar, of course, was getting raw data from the terrain below us. Knowing ahead of time that we were going to cross the mountains east of the landing site, we were looking for the altitude difference to change, and it was a comfortable feeling to see it happen.
112:56:29|ALSJ||Jack is consulting a graph of the expect altitude, descent rate, etc versus time during the burn. The graph is mounted on the yellow AOT guard in training photo @alsjurl/a17/ap17-KSC-72PC-539.jpg"@alsjt>KSC-72PC-539</a>.
112:56:33|ALSJ|CDR|The pitch, roll, and yaw axes were different on the LM than they were on the Command Module; and we had re-defined them for pilot convenience. Pitch was rotation around the left/right axis; roll was rotation around the axis out the front window or the front hatch; and yaw was rotation around the thrust axis. When you were coming down in the final approach and were pitched straight up, if you looked out the window at a particular point and yawed left, that point would move right in your window.
112:56:43|ALSJ||They have killed all but 1000 fps of their initial 5500 fps orbital velocity and will now descend at reduced thrust, initially 57 percent of full thrust.
112:57:31|ALSJ||That is, one minute forty-five seconds.
112:57:42|ALSJ||Jack has been comparing computer readouts for H and H-dot with expected values shown on a chart. Both quanities now agree with the expected values. The raw transcript prepared at the time of the mission for the press has the first part of Jack's transmission as "H-dot and H are great". In December 2011, Colin Mackellar noted - and I concur - that, in recordings made at Honeysuckle Creek, Jack seems to be saying "H-dot and H agree".
112:57:42|ALSJ||Shortly, Jack will start the sequence camera, a sixteen-millimeter movie camera mounted in Jack's window as shown in training photo @alsjurl/a17/ap17-KSC-72PC-539.jpg"@alsjt>KSC-72PC-539</a>. As of mid-1993, the film from this final descent was being shown over and over again as part of a LM cabin display at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.
112:57:50|ALSJ||Ten miles out.
112:57:58|ALSJ|LMP|There were at least two fuel gauges and, after watching their telemetry, the ground recommended which one we should use as a better indicator of fuel quantity.
112:58:03|ALSJ|CDR|We used a lot of numbers and commands that didn't mean anything to most people. But, when you'd done the training and were using the numbers in context, you didn't need to put dimensions with them. All you said was 'Hey; Fuel 2, 27.' And, at the time, that meant something to us. You knew the systems and you knew what that 27 was supposed to mean and that it wasn't supposed to be 92 or 22. And you knew whether it was supposed to be gallons or pounds or whatever. You just talked in an abbreviated language because you were almost in a world of your own during that time, talking to each other with things happening in rapid sequence. Not a lot of people knew what you were talking about, except for the two of you and the people on the ground.
112:58:17|ALSJ||Gene's altitude is about 16,000 feet and the pitch angle is about 60 degrees. He is seeing the summit of the South Massif out the bottom of his window.
112:58:45|ALSJ||They are five miles east of the @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22465"@alsjt>landing site</a>. Nansen is a large depression at the foot of the South Massif; the Scarp is a fault scarp that runs from Nansen northward across the entrance of the valley and up on to the North Massif; and Lara is a crater at the base of the Scarp about midway between the North and South Massifs. At this point, they are at about 12,500 feet altitude, about 5000 feet above the summit of the South Massif.
112:58:45|ALSJ|CDR|We landed in a valley that had mountains higher than the Grand Canyon is deep. Prior to pitching over, down in the bottom of the windows, the first thing I could pick out was the top of the mountains. And as we pitched up some more, I could begin to identify things in our valley. I had to lean as far forward as I could to look up over the top (of the window sill), but I could see them. And it seemed like we were down below the tops of those mountains, down into the valley. It really did. Maybe we were still above the tops; but, as far as I was concerned, we were in that valley.
112:58:47|ALSJ|LMP|This was a number going into the @alsjurl/tnD7990LM_AGS.html"@alsjt>AGS</a> to give it a new altitude reference; and it was taken off the computer which now had the radar update. When the ground agreed that the data was good, then I put it into the AGS for abort purposes. This was something I worked out with the AGS people; I was always trying to find a way to make the AGS better, and this was one of the things.
112:59:16|ALSJ|LMP|By hitting the Proceed button, the computer would start the next program in its repertoire. There was a whole series of programs called P64 and the like, this one being the program for events after pitchover.
112:59:16|ALSJ|CDR|Pitchover was very critical. I needed to look out the window to make sure the LM didn't pitch over too far; so this was one of the few instances in which we had planned for Jack to enter a command into the computer so that I didn't have to look down. Learning how to work together during the landing sequence was a critical part of our training. You get procedures, you get checklists, but two guys still have to learn how to work together and coordinate their resources effectively. This is a good example of that, and one that was much more critical than the lunar surface work.
112:59:19|ALSJ|CDR|We still wanted to slow ourselves down by firing forward but now we also had to keep ourselves from falling in too fast toward the surface. I don't know how much we pitched over, maybe from about sixty degrees to about twenty or thirty degrees (actually from 60 degrees to 20); but, when we did, all of a sudden, bam, the lunar surface filled up almost the entire window.
112:59:24|ALSJ|CDR|Although there is nothing quite like the real thing, flying the Lunar Landing Training Vehicle (@alsjurl/LLTV-952.html"@alsjt>LLTV</a>) had been a step toward realism from "flying" the stationary @alsjurl/tnD7112Simulators.html"@alsjt>simulators</a>. In the LLTV you had your butt strapped to a machine that you had to land safely or you didn't make it. It still wasn't landing on the lunar surface, but it gave you a feel for what the actual landing would be like. Similarly, in simulator training we'd had a TV picture of a (large) model of the landing site that was good enough that, when we pitched over during the actual landing, I felt like I'd seen the landing site before. I won't say that I totally felt like I'd been there before, but I felt like I'd seen that valley before, three dimensionally. So it was a very comfortable feeling to know we were right where we expected to be.
112:59:24|ALSJ||Camelot Crater has a diameter of about 600 meters and the planned landing point is about 600 meters east of its eastern rim. Camelot is also the westernmost of a group of large craters that are scattered around the center of the @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22465"@alsjt>valley</a> and is a very easily recognized landmark.
112:59:26|ALSJ|CDR|In addition to all the fancy gear, all the rate needles and everything, when it came right down to landing, we had @alsjurl/lpdin.jpg"@alsjt>etchings</a> on the window in both pitch and yaw (part of the Landing Point Designator or @alsjurl/apollo.glossary.html#LPD"@alsjt>LPD</a>). And here, after pitchover, Jack is telling me where on the window the computer thinks we're going to land. The digital autopilot and the computer programs were designed to accept attitude impulses with my handcontroller. I could go "blip" once and that would tell the computer that I wanted to change the target maybe a half degree or a degree in pitch. In effect, I was saying, 'Computer, I am now smarter than you. You think you know where the target is, but I'm looking at it out the window. I know where it is, and I'm going to tell you.' It was the same sort of thing in yaw, but you have to remember that yaw didn't directly change the flight direction because yaw is a rotation around the thrust axis. If I rolled to the left, I was going to put the engine to the right and drive myself to the left. If I pitch up, I'm going to put the engine more forward and I'm going to slow myself down and start to come down faster. But I could have yawed through 360 degrees and never effected my trajectory. So if I blipped the handcontroller in yaw, what it really said to the computer was that I wanted to land a little left and that it had to do a little roll to get over there.
112:59:26|ALSJ||Randy Attwood has provide a @alsjurl/lpdin.jpg"@alsjt>photo</a> of the LPD scale in LM-9, the H-mission-capable vehicle scheduled for Apollo 15 before that flight became a J-mission.
112:59:34|ALSJ|CDR|The fact that the target numbers are increasing doesn't necessarily mean that we were pitching up very much, only that we were getting closer to the target and, therefore, that it was getting higher in the window. I didn't respond to these because I was looking out the window and, if I needed to move, I just moved the handcontroller.
112:59:54|ALSJ||The Triangle is trio of small, well-separated craters - Frosty, Rudolph, and Punk - west and north of the landing site. The Triangle is distinct from a merged-crater triad called Trident, south of the target point.
112:59:54|ALSJ|CDR|Poppie was my daughter @alsjurl/a17/a17.s72_51687.jpg"@alsjt>Tracy's</a> name for my father (Andrew 'Andy' Cernan). He never lived to see me land on the Moon and I named the crater for him. And Punk is what I used to call Tracy. I still do, even though she's twenty-six years old (January 1990).
112:59:54|ALSJ||Readers will note that "Poppie" is mis-spelled as "Poppy" throughout the Apollo literature, including the maps that are reproduced in this Journal.
112:59:54|ALSJ||In 1997, Journal Contributor Brian Lawrence suggested that Barjea was named for Gene's wife, Barbara Jean, with the name disguised both by spelling and by Gene's Spanish-like pronounciation, 'Bar-HEE-a'. In a brief correspondence, Gene confirmed Brian's suspicion.
113:00:28|ALSJ|CDR|The angles were useful from pitchover until we got down to a thousand or two thousand feet, and then you were flying by the seat of your pants to some degree. Besides, now I was looking at where we wanted to land, and was just putting it there. So I didn't need the degree numbers, just the altitude and descent rate.
113:00:32|ALSJ|LMP|A lot high!
113:00:32|ALSJ||The nominal descent rate at 500 feet is 17 fps.
113:00:32|ALSJ|CDR|I had it under control; I knew what the response was and how quickly we could slow down. It was comfortable and it saved fuel. In the Navy, we land aboard carriers at 15 feet per second and I knew what that was; and I'd flown the @alsjurl/tnD7112Simulators.html"@alsjt>LM Simulator</a> so many times that I knew what 15 feet per second at 100 feet was like and knew that I could slow it down to 5 feet per second awfully quickly.
113:00:42|ALSJ||The nominal descent rate at 300 feet is 9 fps.
113:00:51|ALSJ||Up to this point, Gene has been using the handcontroller to tell the computer to move the designated landing point forward or back, left or right. In P66 he takes manual control of the spacecraft and uses the handcontroller to change its attitude in pitch and roll. In short, he is now flying the LM with virtually no assistance from the computer.
113:00:51|ALSJ||Here, Jack is confirming that Gene has a little forward velocity so that he'll land on ground he's just seen.
113:00:51|ALSJ|CDR|The tendency for most people flying the LM was to get a false impression of thinking that you were coming down straight. But, because of where the window was located, you would actually be drifting backwards. So I forced myself to land with about a foot or a foot-and-a-half forward velocity. And then, if I fell into the trap of feeling that I was going forward when I was really going vertical, it would be okay.
113:01:14|ALSJ||Gene wants about 5 feet per second down for the final phase; 2 feet per second would burn too much fuel and oxidizer. They will land with about 1225 pounds of fuel remaining, enough for about 117 seconds of hovering. For comparison, Neil Armstrong landed with only 50 seconds of fuel/oxidizer remaining, primarily because at pitchover he discovered he was coming down into West Crater and had to take over manual control quite early and fly beyond to a good landing spot. Apollo 11 was the only flight on which less than 100 seconds of fuel/oxidizer remained at touchdown.
113:01:14|ALSJ||In the landing film, dust becomes easily visible at about 113:01:38; but, by this time, Gene knows exactly where he is going to land. Even in the film, rocks and small craters are visible until the last few seconds. The 16-mm camera is mounted in Jack's window.
113:01:58|ALSJ||The @alsjurl/a17/A17_MissionReport.pdf"@alsjt>Apollo 17 Mission Report</a> indicates that Contact occurred at 19:54:58 UTC 11 December 1972. Note that, because of the 2 hour 40 minute launch delay, NASA altered the spacecraft trajectory so that the crew would enter lunar orbit and make the landing at the planned times. During the trip out to the Moon, Houston put the mission clocks forward by that amount so that the clocks would agree with times shown in the checklists, which are relative to the planned time of launch.
113:01:58|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Jim Scotti writes, "I once asked Gene Cernan what sort of sounds he had heard as he landed on the Moon, hoping to get answers to these kinds of questions - how loud the thrusters were, could he hear the descent engine, what about pumps and switches and anything else. What he said was rather different than what I was expecting. He said that what he heard in the moments after landing was... silence! You see, before landing, he was so engrossed in the activity that he heard Jack calling out numbers and the occasional call from Houston and everything else blended into the background because he was so focused on the task of landing. At touchdown, however, the spacecraft fell silent and mission control was staying quiet to try not to interfere with what they expected was the final moments of touchdown. And Gene added: 'And the guy standing next to me was struck silent staring out the window looking at the surface and he sure wasn't saying anything!' So Gene noticed the silence. Cool perspective! It fit exactly the kind of answer that I would have hoped for, even though it wasn't the kind of details I had hoped for, but it did a really great job of putting me in his boots at the CDR station in the LM just after landing at Taurus-Littrow.
113:02:17|ALSJ|LMP|Parker valves (also known as the isolation valves or shut-off valves) controlled the RCS thrusters - the fuel and oxidizer - and there was always some concern that they might close at landing, just because of the little bit of shock. So the procedure was to go through and cycle (close and open) every one of them. There were, I don't know, sixteen of them on the wall in front of me and, while Gene was getting all excited, I was cycling switches.
113:02:30|ALSJ|CDR|In thinking about why we worked so well together, the most important point was that we had confidence in each other. Jack is a very astute and dedicated individual, very talented, and I felt very comfortable with him. He was not an aviator and he'll be the first to tell you that. But he took his responsibilities very seriously, learned quickly, and, in terms of technical understanding, was as good as anybody. He wasn't a passenger; he had learned how to be a good co-pilot. In much the same way, I wasn't a geologist, I wasn't a scientist; but I had learned to be a good observer. As soon as we hit the lunar surface, although I was still commander of the crew, Jack was the expert and I was his assistant. We had very different backgrounds. I was the professional aviator and Jack was the scientist; but we both knew enough about all aspects of the missions that we could be confident about working together.
113:02:30|ALSJ||In the next paragraph, the terms 'left seat' and 'right seat' are carryovers from aircraft useage where the commander sat on the left and the co-pilot on the right. Although the LM has no seats, Gene is referring to the Commander as the 'guy in the left seat' and the LMP as 'the guy in the right seat'.
113:02:30|ALSJ|CDR|For the landing and lift-off phases, we were both dedicated to knowing all the intricacies of the spacecraft, all the details of the hardware and the software. Our responsibilities were different; but the fact that I knew all the systems on his side and he knew all the systems on my side was important. I'm the kind of guy who, although I knew I could depend on Jack, wanted to understand everything about the spacecraft. I was fortunate because I'd sat in the right (LMP) seat on Apollo 10, so I knew the @alsjurl/tnD7990LM_AGS.html"@alsjt>AGS</a> (Abort Guidance System). I knew what it could do and, when Jack would talk to me about the AGS or how we were going to use it, I understood because I had been there. And Jack took it upon himself to be very familiar with the operation of the primary guidance computer (PGNS) and the other systems on my side of the spacecraft. But I know there were crews - and I won't name them - where one or the other of the guys was extremely weak in one or more of the systems. Crews where, if the guy in the right seat told the guy in the left seat something was right or wrong, the guy in the left seat just accepted it because he didn't know any different. And he didn't know enough to ask any questions. If the guy in the left seat is just going to depend on someone to throw him a number and not know what the number means or where it came from, and can't challenge it, can't know whether it's right or wrong, then he's not doing his job. With me, if it was ten degrees off, I would know it. And I'd say 'Jack, check your AGS; that's not right.' But if the guy in the left seat had no idea what the AGS was supposed to do, he might just blankly accept that number and go about his business and might or might not get in trouble as a result of it. Even a computer isn't right all the time, and certainly people are prone to mistakes; but if two guys both know a system you're least likely to make a mistake. Mutual respect and teamwork evolves from that.
113:02:30|ALSJ|CDR|Landing on the Moon was a unique opportunity for us both; we didn't want to let it slip through our hands. We spent the time that it took: not just a few extra hours in the simulator, but all the time it took to really understand our spacecraft. Jack spent a lot of time with the people on the ground - more than I did. He got to know them and understand them. He'd go to them with questions like, 'How can you guys help me get my AGS smarter than it normally would be.' And, because he'd spent time working with them, they said 'Hey, we can work something. We'll put it into the checklist that we'll send you an update here and you do that there.' And those kind of things paid off in the form of a level of coordination and teamwork between us and the people on the ground that was as good as on any mission.
113:02:30|ALSJ|CDR|By the same token, I had a lot of personal pride that, if we had lost three quarters of our automatic systems, I still could have landed the vehicle safely. Same thing for leaving the lunar surface. True, you have to believe that you can do it; you would have no other choice. But I knew that if we lost all of our guidance computers, I could have flown that LM into lunar orbit for a rendezvous with Ron Evans. Manually. And by 'manually', I mean (visually guiding) with the stars (and) with the horizon of the Moon. I'd done it enough in the simulators that I knew what my remaining systems were going to tell me; and I had confidence that Jack was going to give me whatever information I need from him. You never know (if you're right about something like that), but I'm confident that we could have done it. And I felt the same way about the Saturn V launch from Earth. Ours was the first nighttime launch, and there were a lot of things we had to consider in terms of guidance control failures. The launches - both from the Earth and from the Moon - were the only truly automatic phases of the mission, but we could take over and fly it manually to orbit. Aborting during Earth launch was the last thing I wanted to do, so I trained and planned. It was a lot more difficult at night than in the daytime because you didn't have horizons and things to look at; you had to look at the stars. We had several modes of failure that could have degraded systems. The worst would have been for all the guidance to fail so that you literally had to fly it by the stars. Now, I can never prove that I could have done it. But I did it a lot of times in simulators and really did - and still do - believe that I could have flown that Saturn V to orbit. It's one of those things where you say 'I hope it never happens; but I dare you. I'll show you. If you do fail, you just watch.' You had to have that attitude; and I think that attitude is reflected across the cockpit. You develop confidence in each other, and, from that, the teamwork evolves.
113:02:30|ALSJ||For the next several minutes, Gene and Jack will monitor the health of their spacecraft and prepare it for an immediate launch, should one prove necessary.
113:02:46|ALSJ||They have probably completed one side of a cue card.
113:03:02|ALSJ|CDR|When you land on a carrier, you've got a mirror and you've got an orange light that reflects in the mirror. On the carrier you've got a row of green lights that also reflect in that mirror and if the meatball - the orange light - is below the green lights, then you are low, below the glide slope; and if the meatball's above the green lights, you are high. So what you do is fly your carrier approach so that the meatball is right in line with the green lights. So I was telling Ron that I had it 'locked' all the way in.
113:03:28|ALSJ||Jack is probably looking at a 3-meter-high basalt boulder about 200 meters west of the spacecraft. It is now known as Geophone Rock and is just to the left of the LM shadow.
113:03:48|ALSJ||During the descent, Gene's heart rate reached a peak of 97 beats per minute. The details are shown in the upper portion of @alsjurl/a17/a17.mr11_1.jpeg"@alsjt>Figure 11-1</a> in the Apollo 17 Mission Report. For comparison, Neil Armstrong's peak rate was 150 - due mostly to the stress of having to avoid West Crater - while the rates for the other three Commanders for whom we have data were 110 for Alan Shepard (Apollo 14), 105 for John Young (Apollo 16), and 97 for Dave Scott (Apollo 15).
113:03:49|ALSJ||During the 3.9 billion years since the Massifs were raised, boulders have been dislodged occasionally from outcroppings high on the mountains. As they tumbled down toward the valley floor, the boulders carved grooves where they rolled or slid, and cut strings of craters where they bounced. The resulting tracks erode only slowly because of countless small impacts and the downslope movement of soil. AS17-144-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21991"@alsjt>21991</a>, which Jack will take from the cabin after EVA-1, shows the most prominent of the North Massif boulder tracks. See, also, the discussion following @alsjurl/a17/a17.eva1post.html#1270228"@alsjt>127:02:28</a>.
113:03:58|ALSJ||In this case, "Go" is permission to stay.
113:04:09|ALSJ||As mentioned previously, at touchdown they had fuel enough left for about 117 seconds of hovering.
113:04:14|ALSJ|CDR|From about a thousand feet down, the planned landing site looked good. So I was just concerned about spacecraft attitude and spacecraft motion during the final approach. I was not concerned about the terrain we were landing on. It was real nice to be down with lots of propellant left but, while it would have been fun to fly around the valley a little and then land, the important thing was to get the spacecraft down safely. It would have been like flying through a thunderstorm and making a safe landing, and having somebody say, 'Hey, we could have gotten more instrument time in that thunderstorm. And you say 'No, thank you.'
113:04:17|ALSJ||Here, Gene is using clock positions, centered on Poppie, with 12 o'clock being west. As Gene remarks at 113:05:13 and 114:30:17, he knew where he was relative to Poppie and other landmarks until he was down to an altitude of about 500 feet. At that point he had to concentrate on a level place to land and lost track of the landmarks. Because frames from the CSM Pan Camera - for example, Pan Camera frame @alsjurl/a17/a17.2309tlhr.jpg"@alsjt>AS17-2309</a> - show the @alsjurl/a17/a17.sitelbl.jpg"@alsjt>LM on the surface</a>, we know that Gene landed about 100 meters north and perhaps 20 meters west of the center of Poppie. The planned landing point is about 230 meters west and about 60 meters south of the actual landing site and not far from Geophone Rock. The crater that Gene thinks is the westernmost part of Trident is actually Poppie. The landing site coordinates are 20.1653 degrees north latitude and 30.7658 degrees east longitude. See, also, a @alsjurl/a17/alsjcoords.html"@alsjt>discussion of landing site coordinates</a>.
113:05:08|ALSJ||Unlike either of the Massifs, Bear Mountain has a distinctly wrinkled, hummocky appearance. Jack is reminding Gene that the apparent difference may, in part, be due to lighting effects.
113:05:13|ALSJ||Again, Gene is mistaken. Rudolph is actually about 200 meters west and 150 meters north of the LM. The crater visible out Jack's window is unnamed.
113:05:31|ALSJ||Once they start to deploy the ALSEP (Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Package), Gene and Jack will have another discussion about the superb visibility they had during the final phase of the landing. The experiences of other crews are summarized after @alsjurl/a17/a17.deepcore.html#1210414"@alsjt>121:04:14</a>.
113:05:46|ALSJ|CDR|The ground wasn't about to commit to a three-day stay when we'd only been there ten minutes. They wanted a chance to look at all the spacecraft systems. This initial post-landing phase was the critical one. Did you bust a tank? Was there any helium or fuel leaking? How was the battery power holding up? During these first few minutes, we were ready to launch immediately. They were taking a quick look and, if things looked okay, they would then let us go ahead and reconfigure the computers and the navigation system for a non-emergency lift-off. Then, after a half hour or so, if everything still looked okay, they would let us power down completely.
113:06:21|ALSJ||T-1 is a pre-programmed opportunity to launch and catch up with the CSM on this orbit. If, during these first minutes, Houston had decided that something was wrong with the spacecraft they would have told the crew to launch at T-1 or even sooner. With the Stay, they will now prepare for T-2, the next pre-programmed launch opportunity.
113:06:31|ALSJ||Ron is congratulating the Challenger crew. Apparently, Jack was surprised to hear him. My thanks to Journal Contributor Jack A. Kozak, who brought the Evans transmission to my attention.
113:06:46|ALSJ||Frank O'Brien provided the following - "P12 is the program for lunar ascent, and Gene is asking for the ascent time. Such information was computed on the ground and relayed to the crew, as it depended on the position of the Command Module - which only Houston knew exactly. There is no P60 on the LM, and since Noun 60 is used only during Ascent, I suppose Gene is referring to Verb 60, which displays the attitude error rates on the @alsjurl/alsj-FDAI.html"@alsjt>FDAI</a>. This would make sense, as this information is necessary for ascent.
113:07:43|ALSJ|LMP|Here we were giving the computer information it would need for T-2. Just prior to descent, Houston had used their best information on the CSM orbit and had read us these times to copy onto a pad for use if we needed them. If we had to get off and get up into orbit at some time other than one of these pre-programmed times, we could have launched into a low orbit so that we would have gradually caught up with him.
113:07:48|ALSJ||For the landing, they have been wearing restraining cables attached at the waist and to the floor on either side of them. The restraints keep them from being thrown around during the maneuvers.
113:08:11|ALSJ||Frank O'Brien - "R3 is DSKY display register number three; Noun 76 refers to the ascent parameters: Downrange Velocity, Radial (Vertical) Velocity and Crossrange Distance. Gene's question to Gordon Fullerton is about the crossrange distance.
113:08:40|ALSJ||Jack laughs because he had his head in the cabin throughout the landing.
113:08:57|ALSJ||Possibly a shallow, unnamed crater about 30 meters west and slightly south of the LM. From their position close to the surface, Gene and Jack can't see shadows cast by most rocks or crater rims in the direction opposite the Sun because the shadows are hidden by the objects casting them. This phenomenon, coupled with the general lack of color and contrast, makes it difficult to see much detail in the down-Sun direction. Because they've landed early in the local morning, down-Sun is currently almost due west, but will shift slightly north as the Sun rises about 12 degrees per day.
113:09:18|ALSJ||Hanover is a sharp, fresh crater on the southwest flank of the North Massif, just east of the trace of the Scarp on the mountain side. Gene and Jack discuss it again during the EVA-2 drives to and from Nansen Crater at the foot of the South Massif. During early phases of mission planning, one of the traverses under discussion would have taken them along the flank of the North Massif to Hanover. Apollo 17 photo AS17-138- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21118"@alsjt>21118</a> is an excellent picture of Hanover, the Scarp, and the North Massif taken during the drive northward from Nansen at about 144:09.
113:09:18|ALSJ|LMP|Hanover was simply too far away for us to have reached; and it had generally been decided that we weren't going to learn much about the Scarp in that area because of the North Massif debris that would have flowed onto it. What we really wanted was a place that would let us collect materials that would be different from what we had landed on, and that's why we went to Nansen.
113:09:41|ALSJ||Gene is pointing out a boulder that apparently has rolled all the way down to the valley floor.
113:09:47|ALSJ|CDR|Although Jack's view was basically from a little south of west up to the north and mine was from a little north of west down to the south, I could get to the left corner of my window and look out at least to the northwest and he could do the same to the southwest. And, although it was hard to do until we unstrapped, we could look out each other's windows, too.
113:09:50|ALSJ||The Sculptured Hills are behind them, out of sight, to the northeast. Gene is suggesting that they will also have a wrinkled, hummocky appearance, which they do in the early morning light.
113:10:03|ALSJ||They are passing time, waiting for T-2 and permission to get busy.
113:10:25|ALSJ||Again, Gene is looking at Poppie. Jack's distance estimate is superb.
113:11:15|ALSJ||Gene is probably referring to outcrops of basalt splatter on the Sunset cinder cone.
113:11:23|ALSJ|LMP|We had done one of our field tests near Sunset Crater, partly because it was volcanic terrain.
113:11:23|ALSJ|CDR|We didn't use a Rover at Sunset, but we had something that allowed us to be mobile. We did a 'typical' lunar traverse that sort of simulated, out in the field, the kind of traverse we would run through on the Moon. It was all pre-planned, of course; so we had an EVA-1, 2, and 3 where we were to do different things. At stop 1 on EVA-1 we were going to do this, take a sample of the soil, and then do that. Now, that doesn't mean that we were doing an exact replica of our traverse on the Moon. We did some @alsjurl/a17/ap17-S72-48889.jpg"@alsjt>simulated traverses at the Cape</a>, driving around in our suits to three or four little stations doing the @alsjurl/a17/ap17-KSC-72P-440.jpg"@alsjt>mechanics of the stops</a>, but not doing anything that could be called geology. Flagstaff put us in a far more realistic geologic environment; we could take samples and, even though the samples would be grossly different than we might find on the Moon, we'd run into things we hadn't expected to see and find extra tasks that needed to be done. The stations always took longer than what we'd planned and, in that respect, it was very good training.
113:11:55|ALSJ|CDR|During the landing, there were a lot of things going on, but we knew right away that the quantity light was not something which was particularly urgent. We knew how much fuel we started with, we knew how much we'd been burning, and we knew the ground hadn't seen any changes. Theoretically, by the numbers, we probably should have aborted. But you don't just do things; you don't overreact. It's a good example of what I meant when I was talking about Jack and I working well as a team, about understanding more than the superficial information, about understanding each other, and about understanding where the information was coming from. When Jack gave me numbers, I knew he was not just reading numbers. I knew that he knew where the numbers came from. And the same thing applies to the quantity indicator. I won't say that we ignored it, but there just wasn't anything else at that time to tell us it was important. We both noticed it, I called the ground's attention to it, and that was all.
113:12:24|ALSJ||If there really had been a problem other than just an erroneous warning light, it was a problem in the descent stage and, therefore, is no longer of any practical concern to the rest of the mission.
113:13:02|ALSJ|CDR|-"We could put the @alsjurl/water_gun.jpg"@alsjt>water gun</a> (photo by Mick Hyde) through a little self-sealing hole in our helmets. It was like a little hatch at the cheek. You had to turn your head to get a drink; and I think Jack probably just took the water gun off the hook (behind him) and gave himself and then me a little squirt of water. This was the first chance we'd had to have anything to drink at all in the whole thing.
113:13:10|ALSJ||That is, land on the Moon.
113:13:24|ALSJ|LMP|What we were about to do here was depressurize the descent stage tanks by venting the helium. You didn't want to actually empty the tanks and vent hydrazine and nitrous oxide onto the surface and contaminate the area. And you also didn't want the tanks to heat up and pressurize and possibly rupture during the three-day stay. So you depressurized them.
113:13:46|ALSJ||VOX is the voice-actuated mode of communications. PTT or "Push-to-Talk" is the alternative. In the PTT mode, astronauts can only talk to Houston by manually activating the microphones that were part of the "Snoopy" helmets that they each wore. The tape recorder has only a limited amount of tape available and has been on since before undocking. They will turn the recorder on at about 116:23:07 during the preparations for EVA-1.
113:13:46|ALSJ|LMP|The key for the microphone was a big blue knob on a cable at your side, so that if you leaned forward you might hit it and unintentionally let the ground listen in.
113:13:46|ALSJ||There is also a trigger-type key on the handcontrollers.
113:14:52|ALSJ|LMP|The vents were opened with a little pyrotechnic device called the Apollo Standard Initiator.
113:14:59|ALSJ||There was no audible bang when it fired.
113:15:11|ALSJ||Gene's half of the following conversation is not audible; only Jack is on VOX, a conscious choice so that Houston can follow along. They are configuring the cabin for unsuited stay, and will take their helmets off fairly soon. Most terms in the following paragraphs will be defined during preparations for the EVA.
113:17:04|ALSJ|LMP|When you go to Repress, Auto, you get a little bit of gas flow across the valve; maybe we saw something that it ejected. Or maybe I was just wondering where the gas was going.
113:17:04|ALSJ||Details of the LM Environmental Control System (@alsjurl/alsj-LM-ECS.html"@alsjt>ECS</a>) are discussed in the Introduction. For present purposes, we note that, during the descent, Gene and Jack wore their suits, gloves, and helmets - albeit with the suits unpressurized so that they didn't have to move their arms and fingers against the stiffness of any internal suit pressure. By setting the redundant oxygen demand regulators (A and B) to the Cabin position, they are telling the ECS to supply enough oxygen to maintain the cabin pressure at 4.8 psi. By setting the @alsjurl/lm_suit_gas_diverter_valve.jpg"@alsjt>Suit Gas Diverter Valve</a> to Egress, they are preventing any interchange of gas between the cabin and the suit circuit. However, in just a few seconds Gene and Jack will remove their helmets and gloves, resulting in gas flow through the neckrings and at the wrists. By setting the Cabin Repressurization Valve to Auto, they are preparing the ECS for an emergency cabin repressurization in the unlikely event that one should become necessary.
113:19:16|ALSJ||Gene is about to take star sightings to verify the alignment of the inertial guidance platform. The Alignment Optical Telescope ( @alsjurl/aot.htm"@alsjt>AOT</a>) is mounted on the wall between them, at about Gene's eye level. Noun 20 may be information about the current platform alignment.
113:19:58|ALSJ||Jack is probably adjusting the window shade to let in a little light for his own activities while keeping the cabin dark enough for Gene to do the star sightings. Jack seems to be saying that he can't get to the light switch, probably because it is covered by his helmet and/or gloves. The shade on Gene's window and on the overhead rendezvous window are denoted in AS17-145-@alsjurl/a17/a17lbl22225.jpg"@alsjt>22225</a> as labelled by Lennie Waugh.
113:19:58|ALSJ|LMP|We couldn't see the stars out the window or when we were out on the surface. It took the collimation of the telescope to eliminate all of the reflected light reaching your eye from your surroundings. Even in the LM shadow, there were too many bright things in your field-of-view for the stars to be visible.
113:19:58|ALSJ||A telescope - or any long, straight tube - admits only light rays coming from a small range of directions. The light rays that reach the end of the tube are virtually parallel to each other and to the long axis of the tube and, therefore, have been "collimated".
113:19:58|ALSJ|CDR|When you were in the lunar module, looking out the window, you certainly couldn't see stars. Using the telescope was sort of like being in a deep well; it cut out all the reflected light and let you see the stars. It was also generally true that, when you were on the surface in the LM's shadow, there were too many bright things in your field-of-view for the stars to be visible. But I remember that I wanted to see whether I could see stars, and there were times out on the surface when I found that, if you allowed yourself to just focus and maybe even just shielded your eyes to some degree, even outside the LM shadow you could see stars in the sky. And, quite frankly, under the right conditions here on Earth on a bright sunlit day, you can do the same thing. I could see stars through my helmet visor; not easily, but it can be done.
113:19:58|ALSJ||A related issue is whether or not stellar images could have been captured in any of the lunar surface photography. All of the photos taken out on the surface were taken at an exposure of 1/250th of a second at f/8 or f/11. The two film types were SO 368 Ektachrome MS color-reversal film, ASA 64 and 2485 black and white film, ASA 6000. Sky and Telescope Senior Editor Dennis di Cicco states, "Sirius and a few other bright stars might actually be bright enough to have recorded on the exposures, but the images would be impossibly small and hard to find on the original negatives. Furthermore, when such a negative was printed to show the foreground properly, it certainly would not have shown the star(s)" di Cicco notes that it would be easy to preform such an experiment on Earth. "Go out at night with a similar setup used for the lunar photos and take a similar exposure of bright stars. Develop the film and see if you can find any star images. Then, have the negative printed with an exposure that would be proper for a normally exposed daylight negative. I am confident that you'll never, ever see a star on the print!
113:20:36|ALSJ|LMP|We had the antenna in a ready condition during the descent and landing and, here, we may be parking it in a configuration to minimize heating on critical elements.
113:20:36|ALSJ||A notation at the bottom on Surface Checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf1-1.jpg"@alsjt>1-1</a>, left column, suggests that, here, they are parking the rendezvous radar antenna in a position where it won't interfere with the star sightings. After they finish P57, near the top of the left column on Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf1-3.jpg"@alsjt>1-3</a>, they will re-park the radar, this time pointing up.
113:23:01|ALSJ||P57 is the platform alignment program. It begins with a determination of the direction of the local gravity vector in relation to the spacecraft and then uses the data from Gene's star sightings.
113:24:36|ALSJ|LMP|The L&amp;A (Landing and Ascent) was a model constructed by the Army Topographic Command for use in the @alsjurl/tnD7112Simulators.html"@alsjt>simulator</a>. It was made from data they extracted from Apollo 15 stereo photography. It was a fairly detailed model, mounted upside down on a ceiling. A TV camera "flew" to it as we "flew" the LM simulator and the picture was merged into our visual displays in our windows in the simulator. It was pretty good size; it covered the whole valley - past the Scarp, I know - and part way up the sides of the massifs.
113:24:36|ALSJ|CDR|The L&amp;A simulations of the landing sites always tended to come fairly late in training, but I don't recall us having a great problem with it being extremely late. It may not have seemed adequate at the time, but it certainly was adequate.
113:24:36|ALSJ||The following paragraph has been edited for clarity.
113:26:47|ALSJ||Once again, Jack is lamenting that, rather than get a chance to look at the Moon during the descent, he'd had his eyes glued to the instruments.
113:27:05|ALSJ|CDR|Because we were landing early in the morning at a site so far east, we landed at a very early phase of the Moon and almost the entire Earth was sunlit. We took the picture of the fullest Earth that any crew saw because we left Earth almost at the New Moon. As we stayed there, the fraction of the Earth that was sunlit got less and less and it got to be a three-quarters Earth and then a Half Earth by the time we left lunar orbit to come home. On the surface, when we went to bed at night, we could see the American flag out Jack's window and (out Gene's window) we could see the Earth sitting right on top of the South Massif. Because of where we landed, the Earth was fairly low in the sky and was always part of the scene. Looking at the Earth was something you could do casually, and you would do many times without even realizing it. That was the neat part about it being so low in the sky.
113:27:05|ALSJ|LMP|Actually, what he could see was mostly the southern hemisphere because, when we landed, the Moon was below the plane of the Earth's equator. During the final phases of the landing, I had the center section of the LM blocking me. All I could look at was the North Massif. I took one look, but Gene had me so drilled on giving him those numbers I missed the whole landing.
113:27:05|ALSJ|CDR|I'm proud of that. That's professionalism. I don't think we have to take a back seat to anybody for any (aspect) of the mission.
113:27:05|ALSJ||Readers will note that Jack saw Earth out his window at 112:55:41 which was about 5:45 into the burn. At that time, however, the LM was yawed left about 20 degrees for comm purposes. Less than a minute later, at 112:56:33, Gene went to a yaw of zero for the final approach and Earth rotated out of Jack's field-of-view.
113:27:39|ALSJ|CDR|You could align the inertial platform either with the stars or with gravity. Here, we were gravity aligning. I think Noun 22 showed you the new alignment angles (in yaw, pitch and roll, in tenths of a degree), and it gave you a chance to look at it and say 'Yes, I want it; I'll accept it,' or 'No, I'll keep my old alignment.' The fact that we were still aligning the platform means that we were still in a mode to leave the lunar surface on a contingent basis. We'd taken our helmets and gloves off, but still hadn't really powered down for a long lunar stay. In the worst case we could have lifted off without helmets and gloves; if you had to go, you went, as long as you had certain minimum things powered up in the lunar module. Now, eventually, we powered it all down - the computers, the platform - and, then we were really in a state of saying, 'We're comfortable here.'
113:28:52|ALSJ||Fullerton is suggesting that Jack adjust the antenna pointing for a maximum signal strength from Earth.
113:30:12|ALSJ|CDR|This was a non-voice recorder for LM engineering data. A lot of times, when you were out of line-of-sight communications, or you had to drop off a communication signal, the tape recorder would continue to record all the engineering data about all the systems that would normally have been transmitted back to Earth as telemetry. That way the ground eventually had a totally uninterrupted scan of information of how the systems had been operating. But, when we were on the lunar surface, they didn't need the tape recorder because we had good, real-time communications all the time.
113:31:07|ALSJ||Gene is now taking star sightings.
113:40:25|ALSJ|LMP|P57 was the star-sighting program and, in the telescope, you had a cross-hair which was the cursor and also an unwinding spiral overlaying it. And I guess that, at any particularly time, every star had a known set of inertial coordinates related to that cursor and spiral. As I remember, you loaded the coordinates of the star you were going to sight in the computer so that it could drive the telescope to the expected position; and, then, once you were sure that you had the right star, you zeroed-out the pointing and allowed the computer to take the refined information into account.
113:41:47|ALSJ||That is, Jack can skip the readout called for in the checklist at the bottom, right-hand column, of page @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf1-2.jpg"@alsjt>1-2</a>.
113:42:23|ALSJ|CDR|There was a program in the computer that literally could align the inertial platform to a local vertical defined by lunar gravity; or, of course, we could align it on the stars. But, generally, we would always tend to check the gravity alignment with stars, and then utilized both to align the platform.
113:43:45|ALSJ||Jack and Gene and I then had an extended discussion of @alsjurl/a17/a17-lltv.html"@alsjt>LLTV training</a>.
113:43:45|ALSJ||Gene has been making a new gravity measurement during the Comm Break.
113:50:48|ALSJ|CDR|We aligned the LM inertial platform in orbit before we landed. Theoretically, it should have maintained its alignment, but a lot of things happened during landing which could have changed it. We fired engines; and all the little perturbations could have driven the alignment off just a little bit. So when I said, 'O.K., Gordy, it's a little better' I was referring to the angular difference between where the computer thought the inertial platform was aligned and where we now knew it was aligned based upon our gravity measurements and star sightings. There might have been only a few hundredths of a degree difference or something like that, and that looked a lot more realistic than it had when I got the cursor and spiral mixed up.

113:53:32|ALSJ|CDR|You hit the stop button when you're ten feet above the lunar surface, the length of the probes sticking down from each of the struts. You're coming down at two or three feet per second, and you've got noise, and the engine is effectively holding you up. True, you're in one-sixth gravity and you don't tend to fall very fast. But all of a sudden, one of the probes touches, you get the contact light, you shut that thing down and boom, your stomach goes up in your throat for a split-split second. You've shut down all your thrust - and it shuts down immediately - and you go 'burrup'. It was quite a change in acceleration. You wouldn't get that if you could fly all the way down to the surface smoothly and then shut down; but we weren't afforded that luxury for the Apollo landings because we wanted to shut the engine down before we actually touched down. There was always the potential problem of the descent engine digging into the soft sand if you landed at an angle or there was a mound below you. If you dug in the engine and it was running - with all the fire and brimstone coming out of it - it could have exploded on you because of back pressure. So you wanted to shut it down just a couple of feet into the air. You knew the drop was coming, but there was still a definite, abrupt physical sensation.
113:53:44|ALSJ|CDR|As for the forward velocity, which we talked about earlier, my plan was to have about a foot per second forward. Now, I suppose, accurately, I could have been looking at the gauges at that time, it would have told me; but, probably, from 60 or so feet on down I hadn't planned to look at the gauges because, once you get right down to that point, you use your eyeballs and you take what you get. If you're set up properly, you'll end up right. If you're not set up properly, you're going to end up improperly.
113:53:44|ALSJ|CDR|There was a reason why I used the 'think' emphasis, 'I think I saw the contact light, and I think I waited about a second and hit the stop button.' You're not a robot, but you are so familiar with what needs to happen, with what needs to be done, that you go ahead and do them on a reaction basis at the right times. You don't have to analyze them and think through each one of them. So when I reflected upon this, I said, 'I think I waited about a second and hit the stop button.' It might have been a half second, who knows what it might have been. As another example, on lift off from the lunar surface, the computer gives the ignition signal to the engine. However, whether it gets it or not, there's a backup because the command pilot hits manual ignition. Just as a backup. And one of the flight controllers told me I was like a tenth of a millisecond behind the computer. I was so close that they almost couldn't tell. They told me, 'We're not sure whether the computer hit it at T-Zero, or whether you hit it at T-Zero, because one was right on top of the other.' So you react to doing some of these things. After we lifted off, we don't want to overburn either; and if the computer didn't shut the thing off right when it should, you had to be right there when you wanted it shut off. Boom; you shut it off. Those were reactions you took almost involuntarily because you'd trained to do that. They weren't robotic responses because you thought through them before they happened; but then, when they happened, they made logical sense and, as soon as you got the contact lights, you started throwing switches.
113:54:13|ALSJ||The computer has been in a dump mode, sending information to Houston. Here, Cernan wants to be told when the dump is finished so that he can use the computer again.

113:58:23|ALSJ|CDR|As I remember, we put Noun 20 in the computer, the computer did something with it, and then gave back a Noun 22. Then, if everybody was happy with the Noun 22, we'd go ahead, enter the Noun 20 into the working part of the computer, and power down the Abort Guidance System.

114:02:14|ALSJ||They are now configuring spacecraft switches for the lunar stay. During this interval, there is a change-of-shift Briefing for the press and the Public Affairs version of the audio tape used to prepare this transcript was made in a voice-activated mode. That is, the tape ran only when there was something to record. The original NASA transcript includes some times of utterances but it is impossible to interpolate the times of other utterances without reference to continuous tapes.
114:11:31|ALSJ||Checklist page 1-8 gives the configuration of the Environmental Control system (@alsjurl/alsj-LM-ECS.html"@alsjt>ECS</a>).
114:11:31|ALSJ||These are nominal lift-off times for upcoming orbits. Jack is entering the numbers in the on-board flight plan in case of a loss of communications. In an emergency, of course, they could lift off at almost any time; and, once on orbit, Evans could maneuver to pick them up. Next, Gene and Jack will reconfigure the cabin for their three-day stay on the Moon. The detail can be found on checklist page Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf1-9.jpg"@alsjt>1-9</a>.
114:15:15|ALSJ||The BRA is a restraining device, made of loose webbing, which they are installing across the front of the cabin. It contains two large pouches, one for each of the helmets. The name, of course, came from the resemblance of the BRA to a woman's brassiere. The PLSS (Portable Life Support System - the backpack) in question is Jack's, and has been strapped to the floor between them. Gene's is attached to the leftside bulkhead behind his left shoulder.

114:30:17|ALSJ||Gene is giving a clock position relative to the crater, with 12 o'clock due west.
114:31:56|ALSJ||Again, Gene doesn't realize that he is actually about 100 meters north of Poppie and is mistaking it for the westernmost part of Trident. Had he landed at the target point, Trident 1 would have been about 400 meters to the south.
114:38:37|ALSJ||Houston can only read biomedical sensors on one of the astronauts at a time, not both. Houston thinks they are recording Schmitt's vital signs and wants to make sure. "Right" refers to Jack's station on the right side of the spacecraft, facing forward; "left" would be Gene. They were supposed to start their meal break at about 114;12 and, therefore, are only about 20 minutes behind the timeline. Comm Break
114:41:11|ALSJ|CDR|'Cutting into a little lunch' was a literal statement; we had to use @alsjurl/a17/AS17-162-24096lr.jpg"@alsjt>scissors</a> to cut open the plastic food bags.
114:41:11|ALSJ||The near rim of Camelot is about 800 meters due west of them.
114:41:11|ALSJ|CDR|This was typical of the problems you had judging size and distance on the lunar surface. Everything looked almost an order of magnitude (factor of ten) smaller than it really was. Certainly two to three times smaller and a lot closer than it really was. You had no telephone poles, no roads, no houses, no buildings to really judge distance by. Everything you looked at, you'd almost say, 'Well, it's just out there a few hundred feet', but it was probably a mile away. A boulder that looked like it was four or five feet tall might be a mile away and be 30 feet tall. You learned very quickly that you had no good way to judge of distance or size. Of course, after enough times of underestimating things you sort of recalibrated your system. You said, 'I know it looks like so and so, but it's probably so and so.' And even when we drove places, it didn't look like it was that far, but we kept driving, and driving, and driving before we got there. So, I'm not surprised that I was off by a factor of three here.
114:41:11|ALSJ||This is Geophone Rock, and Jack has made an excellent estimate of it's size (3 meters) and distance. Like the LM, Geophone Rock is visible in one of the high resolution pictures taken by Ron Evans from orbit. It is one of the few rocks on the valley floor big enough to cast a shadow discernible in the photograph.
114:41:11|ALSJ|LMP|I knew how long the LM shadow was at the time of touchdown, and I just adjusted my estimates accordingly. Nothing ever looked as long as it was. I think my own judgments would have been off by a third, maybe, if I hadn't applied the known shadow length. Everything looked smaller. Just as distances look shorter in clear air of the Western U.S. than they do in the East, the lack of haze and references on the Moon made estimates difficult.
114:41:11|ALSJ||In 1835, Charles Darwin had a similar problem judging distances while traveling in the Andes east of Santiago, Chile, in March 1835: "Travelers having observed the difficulty of judging heights and distances amidst lofty mountains, have generally attributed it to the absence of objects of comparison. It appears to me, that it is fully as much owing to the transparency of the air confounding objects at different distances, and likewise partly to the novelty of an unusual degree of fatigue arising from a little exertion,habit being thus opposed to the evidence of the senses. I am sure that this extreme clearness of the air gives a peculiar character to the landscape, all objects appearing to be brought nearly into one plane, as in a drawing or panorama. The transparency is, I presume, owing to the equable and high state of atmospheric dryness." - from The Voyage of the Beagle, p. 347.
114:41:11|ALSJ||Actually, they are just about on a north-south line through the center of Poppie.
114:41:11|ALSJ||All of the Apollo crews, with the exception of Armstrong and Aldrin who had no specific target point, spent a significant amount of time after landing trying to figure out exactly where they were.
114:41:11|ALSJ|CDR|It absolutely amazes me that you can travel a quarter of a million miles and still worry about whether you're a hundred or two hundred feet short or long, or left or right of where you should have landed.
114:41:11|ALSJ||Jack says that a serving of corn chowder eaten during the trip out from Earth had given him a bad case of intestinal gas, much to the distress of Gene and Ron who, in the tiny Command Module, had no way of getting away from the resulting smell.
114:50:41|ALSJ||A Captain's Mast is a disciplinary hearing chaired by a naval unit's commanding officer.
114:50:41|ALSJ||At 114:56:45, Ron Evans passes over the landing site for the first time since touchdown and reports "Hey, I think I can see a light spot down there on the landing site where they might have blown off some of that halo stuff. It's between Sherlock and Camelot." A few moments later, he gives a coordinate of DN83.3 on map TL25-8, a position on the north rim of Poppie. A further conversation on this matter is reproduced just prior to 115:09:06.
114:56:20|ALSJ||On level ground, ejecta from small impacts in the surrounding regolith splash on the side of a rock and building up a skirt - called a fillet - around it's base. On a sloping surface there is also a contribution to filleting from downhill soil movement.
114:56:20|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Ulli Lotzmann notes that the 10x40 monocular was manufactured by Leitz, Germany, and modified by NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) Houston.
114:57:10|ALSJ|LMP|I think that the mottling is due to an irregular, brown-glass patina that covers the rock surface. Each time a micrometeorite hits a rock, it splashes melt-glass onto the surrounding rock surface, building up the patina. However, each of the impacts also cleans off a small patch of the patina right at the impact point; and I suspect that that is what this mottled appearance is.
114:57:34|ALSJ|LMP|This was probably a secondary crater, one made by a piece of ejecta from another impact. Clues that a crater is a secondary rather than a primary are an irregular crater shape and/or the presence of the boulder that made the crater. In this case, the glass on the boulder suggested that it had been thrown out of a high speed impact before it landed where we found it.
114:57:47|ALSJ||Geophone Rock is not a breccia and, on closer examination, Jack will describe it as a vesicular gabbro, a coarse-grained basalt containing small, spherical cavities (vesicles) left by bubbles of gas trapped in the rock as it cooled.
114:58:31|ALSJ||Jack will need to pick an ALSEP site at least 300 feet (100 meters) west of the LM in order to minimize effects of the lift-off plume. When the time comes, he will put the ALSEP Central Station about 40 meters north of Geophone Rock.
115:00:15|ALSJ|LMP|In the pre-mission photographs, the area looked like it was covered with dark material. There also seemed to be fewer craters, most of them relatively subdued. So we were anticipating that there might be a mantling of dark, pyroclastic material. It turned out that there had been such deposits in the area, but that they were 3.5 billion years old and were mostly long-since buried. Some of the buried dark material had been mixed to the surface by impacting; and, so, the dark color is a marker for pyroclastic deposits, just not recent ones.
115:00:35|ALSJ|LMP|I think that the prevalence of buried boulders and the lack of any clearly sitting on the surface is part of a normal process. When it landed, a boulder would normally dig at least a little crater for itself; and as the fillet formed and the crater filled in, the boulder wouldn't look like it was sitting on the surface. Boulders actually sitting on the surface would have been rare.
115:00:48|ALSJ|LMP|Normally I would have talked in meters but, for some reason, I knew the length of the LM shadow in feet. It was 110 feet long, I remember; and, apparently, the crater was down-Sun and next to the shadow.
115:01:00|ALSJ|LMP|This was a bad interpretation on my part. These fragments were mostly regolith breccia (impact-compacted soil) like what we saw on EVA-3 at Van Serg Crater.
115:02:56|ALSJ||Because small craters are made much more frequently than large craters, a fresh surface will "saturate" first at the small end of the size range. That is, after a while there will be few spots not covered by centimeter-sized craters and, after a longer period of time, overlapping foot-sized craters will cover most of the surface.
115:02:56|ALSJ|LMP|The saturation size should tell you something about the age of a surface. But you have to assume things like a time-invariant size distribution and that nothing has been spread over the local surface to reset the clock. There are just too many variables to use the concept of saturation size at this scale. It's one thing to use it at an orbital scale (for craters of kilometer size and up); it's another thing to use it down here 'among the trees'.
115:02:56|ALSJ||<a name="1150302">For the next several minutes</a>, Gene will describe the general view out his window.

115:03:02|ALSJ||The very light-colored highlands that cover most of the Moon's surface - in contrast to the darker mare or seas - are thought to be composed largely of anorthositic rocks which formed deep within the Moon, early in its history. Apollo 15's Genesis Rock is a piece of virtually pristine anorthosite recovered on the lower slopes of Mount Hadley Delta.
115:03:48|ALSJ||The actual slope of South Massif is about 26 degrees. The summit height is 2300 meters or 7500 feet.
115:07:15|ALSJ||The Sculptured Hills are out of sight, behind them to the east. The LM has only forward-facing windows.
115:08:12|ALSJ||The 'Backroom' is the Science Support Room.
115:09:03|ALSJ||It is now Gene's turn to eat while Jack talks.
115:09:03|ALSJ|CDR|Obviously, Jack could draw a lot upon his geology background to be able to recognize and describe some of these features on the Moon. It was a tremendous advantage. But I also think that my training was certainly more than adequate for what I had to do. It was comprehensive and I spent a lot of time at it. In fact, I got some general @alsjurl/ap-geotrips.html"@alsjt>geology training</a> even before Apollo 10 and then specifically got involved for Apollo 14 and then again with Apollo 17. We spent a lot of time studying various aspects of geology, mostly by going out in the field but also - at least a little - by looking at photographs and samples from prior missions. I think Jack probably did more of that than anybody, primarily because of his interest but also because he was staying in the geology side of the business, analyzing the material coming back from each of the missions. I think it was recognized that we didn't have much time to be much else besides observers. If we had enough background and training to recognize that something was different and unusual, then we could photograph it and bring a sample back. That's about all you had time to do on the Moon anyway, no matter whether you were a fully trained geologist or not. Even if we had had more time for geology training, at some point you have to ask at what time do you stop becoming that much more qualified as a lunar geology observer.
115:09:03|ALSJ|CDR|One of the important parts of the training was getting exposed to a lot of different things here on Earth so that, when you saw something on the Moon, you could say, 'Hey, this is similar to Sunset Crater at Flagstaff'; or 'This is similar to that impact crater I saw west of El Paso'; or 'This is similar in structure to the craters at the Nevada Test Site' or whatever. To me, the best way to be an observer is to have enough experience that you can describe whatever you're looking (at) in terms of something that people on the ground are familiar with. Of course, you can bring the pictures and samples back; but in real time, you can say, 'Hey, I'm standing in a crater and it looks just like Sunset Crater, or just like those craters we saw in Canada, or this rock is just like the pahoehoe we saw in Hawaii.' Then someone back on Earth who's seen the same things will know exactly what you're talking about. But, if you don't go to those places in training, if you don't have that exposure, it's hard to relate what a stream of pahoehoe looks like. If you can say, 'Gee, this is black just like that black car you're driving,' then they know what color black it is. But if you say, 'Well, it's sort of a grayish silver black,' it could be anything.
115:09:03|ALSJ|CDR|Geology was part of my job in this period of time in my life, but I'm sure that Jack will have a far deeper recollection of the lunar geology. That's his business; that's his profession. I've had a lot to say about the descent, because that's my profession. And I can sit all day and talk about what it felt like to be on the Moon, what it looked like, what it meant; but I probably won't recall a lot of the details of our lunar geologic traverses. Maybe I'll surprise myself. I don't know. As I've read some of what I said about what things looked like out the window, I do recall some of it, and it does mean something to me. And I think that means I was pretty well trained to be a geologic observer. I think that was true in the case of most everybody who went; but I had the advantage of having a professional geologist with me.
115:09:03|ALSJ||At this point, Ron Evans is having a further conversation with Houston about his visual observations of the landing site at 114:56:45.
115:09:03|ALSJ||Ron has the map oriented along his flight path, with west up and north to the right. The actual landing site is very close to DN.3, 83.3.
115:09:03|ALSJ||It's a little hard to identify the two craters between Camelot and Sherlock - possibly Trident and the unnamed feature north of Poppie.
115:09:03|ALSJ||Based on Gene's statements about the landing site, Houston is under the impression that the LM is a bit west of the white spot, while Evans has the landing place identified to within 20 meters or so. It is a bit puzzling that Houston never tells the LM crew about this observation. Had Gene been told, he might have been able to shift his frame of reference and get oriented before starting the drive to Station 1. Evans will reconfirm this initial observation at 116:56. However, at 120:52 he will report that he cannot see the white spot any more. There is, however, no doubt that he has seen the patch of ground scoured by the descent plume. Photo AS17-139-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21203"@alsjt>21203</a> will be taken by Jack while he and Gene are working at Station 6 on the lower slopes of the North Massif.

115:09:06|ALSJ||Henson is a 300 meter crater on the lower slopes of the North Massif at about Jack's 2 o'clock position. It is not to be confused with Hanover Crater which is farther west, but also on the lower slopes of the North Massif.

115:11:03|ALSJ||These were almost certainly glass beads.
115:14:06|ALSJ|CDR|We had a nine-man crew. We had the Prime Crew (Cernan, Evans, Schmitt), the Backup Crew (Young, Roosa, and Duke), and then the three-man Support Crew (Overmyer, Parker, and Fullerton). And there was also a group of supporting engineers. Traditionally, the Support Crew became the principle CapComs because they usually knew more about what was going on during the flight than anybody. Maybe that changed here and there, but for the most part, we had Gordo (Fullerton), (Bob) Parker, Bob Overmyer, and also Joe Allen, who was one of our support scientists. They knew us; they knew how we talked; and they knew our mission. They worked with us in the simulations a good part of the time; and they worked with us virtually all the time once we started the full-scale mission simulations.
115:14:06|ALSJ||During this interval, the Public Affairs commentator gives the press an estimated landing site of DM.8 and 82.7, which is 100 meters west of Poppie, a location corresponding to Gene's erroneous estimate.
115:17:16|ALSJ||Gene and Jack donned their suits at about 107:40, prior to undocking, and then donned their helmets and gloves at about 10 minutes prior to PDI. After the landing and once they were sure that the LM was in good shape, they took the helmets off at about 113:18, about 16 minutes after touchdown. However, since they plan to make a full EVA during this first day on the Moon, they have left their suits on and, as they will tell Houston in a couple of minutes, they are now adjusting @alsjurl/alsj-DrinkFood.html"@alsjt>drink bags and food sticks</a> inside their neckrings for use once they get outside.
115:21:22|ALSJ|CDR|The high gain (antenna) had a pitch axis and yaw axis. I don't think it had a roll axis. I don't think they were particularly related to the inertial axes of the spacecraft.
115:21:22|ALSJ||Gene's memory is correct. From the LM, Earth is at an elevation of 45 degrees and at a bearing 30 degrees south of west; therefore, these pitch and yaw numbers are not simply related to the direction of Earth in the local sky.
115:21:38|ALSJ||Based on Jack's mention of the Buddy SLSS (Secondary Life Support System), or BSLSS, at 115:27:18 and Bob's comment at 115:29:10, they are in the middle of the left-hand column of checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf2-1.jpg"@alsjt>Surface 2-1</a>. On this page they are stowing loose items, putting a 500mm lens on a Hasselblad camera, stowing film magazines and other gear in the Equipment Transfer Bag (ETB) which they will take outside with them, propping up a pair of cue cards for their pre- and post-EVA equipment procedures on the panel in front of them, turning on a heater for the urine disposal line - they will empty the urine collection bags in their suits when they get to the top of page @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf2-5.jpg"@alsjt>Surface 2-5</a> - and attaching a lanyard (the LEC or Lunar Equipment Conveyor) to the ETB and clipping some pages containing emergency procedures to the instrument panel in front of them. These pages are @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf2-3.jpg"@alsjt>2-3</a>, and @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf2-4.jpg"@alsjt>2-4</a>.
115:27:16|ALSJ||For the next few seconds, Jack thinks he is in the Push-to-Talk mode of communication but actually has a live microphone. Bob will call his attention to the fact in about a half minute.
115:27:18|ALSJ||The Buddy SLSS is an apparatus which would allow the crew to share a PLSS in the event that the other one failed. It would only be useful if the Rover were still working; walking astronauts would not be able to move very far or very fast hooked together.
115:29:10|ALSJ||They are loading cameras, film, and other gear for the EVA into the ETB. By putting the oxygen demand regulators in the Egress position, they will cut off any addition of oxygen to the cabin except through the suit circuit. This is not a standard procedure at this point in the mission and Houston's request suggests they are checking some aspect of the ECS operation.
115:31:15|ALSJ||This suggests that they are in the middle of the right-hand column of @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf2-1.jpg"@alsjt>page 2-1</a>.
115:31:15|ALSJ|LMP|Each of us had a pair of scissors which normally traveled with us, but Ron lost his on the trip out from Earth. We had a lot of fun kidding him on the way out and all the way back about losing his scissors in a spacecraft which was, after all, not very big. But the complication was that the whole timeline on the surface was geared to having two pairs of scissors. With two pairs, Gene and I could leave one pair in the cabin and take the other pair outside - probably as a contingency tool - and not have to worry about taking it up and down (the ladder). However, because you needed the scissors to cut the plastic food bags, we finally condescended to leave one pair with Ron so that he could eat. And ultimately his scissors were found. I found them as we were preparing stowage for re-entry; but was able to signal to Gene that I'd found them without Ron knowing it. We continued to give him a pretty hard time and said that, in fact, we didn't think he'd lost them at all but he was trying to get away with these scissors as a memento of the flight and that ultimately the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) would be very interested in his activity. They were fancy, surgical scissors. At the splashdown party we had at the Flight Control Division - probably a month after the mission - we presented the scissors to Ron with great fanfare. We'd had to do an awful lot of preparation because, in order for the inventory of the spacecraft not to be confused, I had to let the crew assistance people in on the secret. I think what I did was put his scissors in my Personal Kit - my little bag of personal items. So there were two pairs of scissors in there. And that kit was supposed to come to us personally. That's probably what I did. I've forgotten exactly how we did the transfer without screwing up the inventory. It would have been a little hard to secretly carry the scissors up into the helicopter with us, because then, in the helicopter we changed out of our constant-wear garments into flight suits for our arrival on the carrier. So, I guess what I must have done is put the scissors in my flight bag.
115:31:15|ALSJ||Photo AS17-162-@alsjurl/a17/AS17-162-24096lr.jpg"@alsjt>24096</a> shows a pair of scissors floating in front of Ron during the trip out from Earth.
115:31:26|ALSJ||Bob consults with Bob Overmyer, the Command Module CapCom.
115:32:02|ALSJ||Apparently, the sounder had been giving trouble either on prior flights, in pre-flight testing, or during pre-landing orbital activities. Obviously, it was not politic for Bob to mention these troubles on the air and Gene properly corrected him.
115:33:12|ALSJ||Use of the heater keeps urine from freezing in the line before it reaches a sump in the descent stage. They have finished loading the ETB and are in the middle of the right-hand column of @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf2-1.jpg"@alsjt>page 2-1</a>.
115:34:52|ALSJ||The controls are on a panel behind Jack's station at about waist height.
115:37:43|ALSJ||They are verifying closure of their suit zippers and are getting their @alsjurl/A12-15EMUv1f2-9.jpg"@alsjt>EVA boots</a> out of storage at the back of the cabin. They have finished emptying the urine bags.
115:44:12|ALSJ||The Oxygen Purge System (OPS) is an emergency supply of oxygen, mounted on top of the PLSS. The OPS contains 5.7 pounds of oxygen stored at high pressure, and is designed for use in the event of a partial failure of a suit seal, a suit puncture, or any one of several possible PLSS malfunctions. An actuator cable is mounted on the right side of the @alsjurl/alsj-RCU.html"@alsjt>RCU</a> and allowed the astronaut to open his OPS shutoff valve, thereby releasing high pressure oxygen to a regulator which then introduces oxygen into the suit at 3.7 psi. In the event of a non-critical failure, such as a slow suit leak or a failure of the PLSS regulator, the PLSS fan would continue to circulate oxygen and, although the crew would promptly return to the LM, there would be no great urgency. The OPS actually contains more oxygen than does the PLSS itself (1.8 pounds at 1400 psi for the PLSS), certainly enough for a few hours of operation. In the event critical failure, such as a loss of cooling, a suit puncture or even a complete PLSS failure, the astronaut could activate his OPS and open a purge valve installed on the lower right chest. The purge valve has two settings: a low flow setting of 4 pounds per hour and a high flow of 8 pounds per hour and, at the high setting would have oxygen and cooling for about 30 minutes.
115:44:12|ALSJ|CDR|The purge valve is nothing but a regulator, with two settings, in an open-loop system. You start with a supply (of oxygen) at one end and you regulate it out at the other end. It's just like a pressurized cabin in an airplane. In the case of an airplane, you pressurize the air from the engines, it goes into the cabin, and the pressure is controlled by an outflow regulator - which you could call a purge valve. It will stay closed if you need to get the pressure up, or it will open to dump as much incoming air as it has to keep the pressure to a certain level.
115:44:12|ALSJ||In circumstances where the astronaut's own PLSS still provided cooling or he and his crewmate were able to use the Buddy Secondary Life Support System (BSLSS) to share cooling water, he would use the low-flow setting and would have about one hour of oxygen available. The BSLSS consists of a set of hoses and connectors and is designed so that LCG cooling water can be shared while riding in the Rover. BSLSS connection procedures can be found on checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17.eva1_cdr47.gif"@alsjt>CDR-47</a>. In the event that BSLSS can not be used, the purge valve would be put in the high-flow setting and the astronaut would have about 30 minutes of oxygen/cooling available.
115:44:12|ALSJ|CDR|At some point there had been a suggestion that we would have to stay close enough to the LM that we could get back in the case of a double failure of both the Rover and a suit. I didn't like that and, obviously, we (the Astronaut Corps) ended up winning the argument. There were lots of things you could do to share oxygen. Suppose that Jack's PLSS failed and he had to go on his OPS. The first thing I'm going to do is take my OPS off my suit and put it in his lap. Then I wouldn't have an emergency supply but he'd have two. I don't think that was ever written down anywhere, but if that had happened, he'd have had an hour of OPS oxygen and we would have been headed for home (the LM). That's the kind of thinking that went on. Now, particularly in the early Gemini days, we did stretch things and did some things that we would never do today. Do you think that we would go out today, in the Shuttle, in an EVA suit with a backpack with hot gas and you were so scared that the hot gas was going to burn a hole through your suit that you made the pants out of woven steel? But we did that in Gemini. Before we had more than twenty minutes of EVA experience, we were going to send somebody out - namely, yours truly - with a hot-gas backpack. With fire coming out. We were burning hydrogen peroxide. We were going to put fire down our suits.
115:44:12|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Rene Cantin asked, in a 2012 e-mail, if the astronauts were prepared for a solo return to lunar orbit in case one of them died on the lunar surface, say from a fatal heart attack or a catastrophic suit failure. I asked Andrew Chakin is he was aware of any training the astronauts might have done for flying a solo ascent. He replied: "There's really nothing for the crew to do until the various burns, so we're really talking about solo rendezvous -- and now that I think about it, the CMP was trained to come get the LM as long as it achieved insertion -- so there's another reason such training would not have been required.
115:44:12|ALSJ||Jack Schmitt provides some additional thoughts: "By flying 100s of hours in the LMS (Lunar Module Simulator), both together and individually, we inherently were cross-trained to fly solo. The checklists would lead you through it with help from Mission Control if you needed it and had comm. We did train for a CSM active rendezvous in several mission simulations and Evans trained for this by himself a lot. The main problem with any suit failure (puncture, cable break) or incapacitation during EVA would be getting the affected crewman up the ladder, through the hatch, and back into the LM. That actually might have been something to train for, but we never did.
115:44:57|ALSJ||Gene recalls that Bob had a great deal of trouble telling the two of them apart during simulations. Hank Hartsfield was an Air Force pilot who, with six colleagues, joined the Astronaut Corps when the Air Force's Manned Orbiting Laboratory program was cancelled in 1969. He first flew in space, as a Shuttle Pilot, in 1982.
115:45:35|ALSJ||As indicated in the @alsjurl/A15-17EMUv2Sec4.2.1.jpg"@alsjt>OPS checkout procedures</a> in Section 4.2.1 of @alsjurl/alsj-EMU2.pdf"@alsjt>Volume II of the Apollo 15-17 EMU Handbook</a>, the expected OPS regulator gage reading is 3.7 &#177; 0.30 psi. Jack is alerting Houston to the fact that both OPS readings are near the upper end of the range.
115:50:02|ALSJ||They are in the middle of the right-hand column of @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf2-5.jpg"@alsjt>Surface 2-5</a>. An anti-fogging agent is wiped on the inside of the bubble helmets prior to each EVA. The helmet assembly consists of the clear, bubble helmet which is an integral part of the pressure suit, a visor assembly, and an outer, white-colored, thermal protection layer. Meanwhile, Houston is still fiddling with the estimated landing site coordinates. They are now giving DM.6, 82.1. People in the back room are still trying to make sense of the crew descriptions and now seem to be giving greatest weight to the supposed location relative to Rudolph and Trident 1.
115:57:16|ALSJ||Because they will soon don their helmets, they can now get the helmet storage bag out of the way. "BRA" is probably an after-the-fact, made-up acronym. It was a mesh bag with two compartments and was used to keep the helmets out of the way during in-cabin operations. The name undoubtedly comes from its resemblance to a brassiere.
116:00:15|ALSJ||That is, they are putting on Jack's backpack. They are at the top of @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf2-6.jpg"@alsjt>page 2-6</a>.
116:00:20|ALSJ||The following audio seqeunce was accumulated using voice-activated circuitry.
116:10:25|ALSJ||They are near the top of the right-hand column of @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf2-6.jpg"@alsjt>page 2-6</a>. They have mounted a Remote Control Unit on Jack's suit chest and are making connections to the PLSS. The top surface of the @alsjurl/a17/alsj-RCU.html"@alsjt>RCU</a> has an oxygen quantity gauge, an oxygen fan switch, and a variety of warning flags. Communications switches are located on the bottom and the switch which controls the flow of PLSS water through the Liquid-Cooled Garment is on the left side. Once outside the LM, Gene and Jack can mount their 70 mm cameras on brackets attached to the front of the RCUs.
116:11:48|ALSJ||They will now repeat the PLSS donning procedures for Gene.
116:11:48|ALSJ|CDR|Getting the PLSSs on was very difficult. It was a two-man operation. The PLSSs were strapped to the side walls, at working height, and you had to back up against yours and the other guy would then unhook it from the wall and help you get it strapped to your back. The LM was so small that it was a very difficult operation, even in soft (unpressurized) suits.
116:12:32|ALSJ||They are checking to make sure that Gene's PLSS sublimator exhaust is clear. The sublimator, which provides suit cooling, is described in more detail at 116:52.
116:12:32|ALSJ||Gene's next transmission is not present on the PAO tape used to generate the audio clip.
116:22:17|ALSJ||Note that this is a separate checklist from the Lunar Surface Checklist which has been in use up to this point. Both contain the same EVA prep information but the EVA prep list is printed on stiff cards which are much easier to handle than the relatively bulky book which contains the full list of procedures to be followed while the crew is in the cabin. In the Surface Checklist, they are starting the section labeled @alsjurl/PLSSComm.pdf"@alsjt>PLSS Comm Check</a> on <a href="a17LMLunarSurf2-6.jpg"@alsjt>page 2-6</a>. The Powerdown Circuit Breaker configurations are shown on pages <a href="a17LMLunarSurf1-4.jpg"@alsjt>1-4</a> and <a href="a17LMLunarSurf1-5.jpg"@alsjt>1-5</a>.
116:23:07|ALSJ||Once they have verified the circuit breakers, they start the comm check, beginning with Jack. We don't hear any of this activity until they get to the section labeled "Audio (CDR)" at the bottom of the left-hand column of @alsjurl/a17/17sur27.gif"@alsjt>page 2-7</a>.
116:25:48|ALSJ||Here, Jack gets off of LM comm and on to PLSS comm. They are at the top of the right-hand column of page @alsjurl/a17/17sur27.gif"@alsjt>2-7</a>.
116:26:35|ALSJ||The next item is closing Jack's audio circuit breaker.
116:27:24|ALSJ||The tone and flag indicate that Jack's suit isn't pressurized and also show that the sensors and indicators are working.
116:27:29|ALSJ||The oxygen warning flag indicates that there is no oxygen flow to the suit. It is supposed to appear in the RCU window briefly and then disappear. This is indicated in the next to the last line on Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf2-7.jpg"@alsjt>2-7</a>. Press Flag - O, O2 Mom. Most of the astronauts vocalized "Mom" as "momentary". For example, see @alsjurl/a17/a16/a16.eva2prep.html#1420607"@alsjt>142:06:07</a> during Apollo 16 EVA-2 Preps.
116:27:59|ALSJ||The checklist suggests raising Jack's PLSS antenna if comm is too garbled, but they decide that the comm is acceptable. Having made the audio check on Jack's PLSS comm, Gene now pulls his Audio circuit breaker, going off LM comm for a few minutes until he gets his own PLSS comm hooked up.
116:29:57|ALSJ||They are now at the top of page @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf2-8.jpg"@alsjt>2-8</a>.
116:30:23|ALSJ||Because they don't yet have their helmets on, Gene can't be absolutely certain that he's hearing Jack through the comm system or directly.
116:31:33|ALSJ|CDR|There were two volume controls on the @alsjurl/alsj-RCU.html"@alsjt>RCU</a> and we obviously had Jack's switches set so that the wheel-like control controlled the volume on his comm circuit to Houston and the blade-like control controlled his circuit with me.
116:32:19|ALSJ||Up to now, the circuit breaker for the LCG pump has been open. By closing it, they turn the pump on and get a flow of cool water next to their skins.
116:32:31|ALSJ||This circuit breaker controls a sensor which responds to a pressure difference (delta-P) across the suit circuit fans.
116:32:36|ALSJ||For redundancy, there are two fans in the suit circuit. Prior to this point, both circuit breakers had been closed and the fan selector switch had been set to fan number 1. Here, they are opening the circuit breaker for fan number 2 and then selecting for the disabled fan.
116:32:38|ALSJ|CDR|The 'fan' was a circulatory pump that moved oxygen through the suit hoses. What is happening here is that we are disconnecting ourselves from the spacecraft ECS (Environmental Control System). We've turned off the suit fans by pulling a circuit breaker because, without oxygen flowing in from the spacecraft, the fan wouldn't be pumping anything and might cavitate and burn out; plus, the fan would also use battery power and we wanted to conserve that. We had two indications that the fan was off. One was the simple fact that we could hear it, and the other was the Master Alarm which, of course, we expected. With us disconnected from the spacecraft, the sensing system thought that the fan had just failed and gave us the expected warning.
116:32:38|ALSJ||They are also waiting for a sensor to indicate that the water separator has run down. Next, Jack will change the settings of various @alsjurl/alsj-LM-ECS.html"@alsjt>ECS</a> valves located on panels behind him.
116:32:57|ALSJ||Here, they are closing a valve which, in the Cabin setting, would allow oxygen to flow out of the suit circuit and into the cabin. It is a push-pull valve. With the valve pushed in, it is in the Cabin position. It is pulled out for Egress.
116:33:03|ALSJ||Here, they are closing a valve which, in the Open or Auto positions, would let oxygen flow from the cabin back into the suit circuit.
116:33:07|ALSJ||In the Auto position, this valve will open if the pressure in the suit circuit exceeds 4.3 psi and will vent the excess oxygen to the cabin. They have reached the bottom of page @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf2-8.jpg"@alsjt>2-8</a> and are about to connect their OPSs. Although they are using cue cards, the procedures they will do next are also shown on @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf2-9.jpg"@alsjt>2-9</a>).
116:33:21|ALSJ||The @alsjurl/ECSf6GSuitIsolVlv.jpg"@alsjt>Suit Isolation Valve</a> has been in the Suit Flow position so that oxygen could flow from the suit circuit into the suits. In the event of a suit circuit malfunction, a signal from a pressure sensor would release a spring-loaded activator which would return the valve to the Suit Disconnect position, thereby isolating the suit so that the astronauts could hook up to an OPS or a PLSS. Here, they are about to disconnect the LM O2 hoses and need to manually close the isolation valve by pushing the Actuator Override lever.
116:33:29|ALSJ||Because the @alsjurl/alsj-LM-ECS.html"@alsjt>ECS</a> is behind them and the hoses come from behind them, they will stow the hoses somewhere to the rear of the spacecraft.
116:33:30|ALSJ||The Pressure Garment Assembly (PGA) is the suit. They are mating the blue end of the hose to a blue connector in the suit torso.
116:33:39|ALSJ||They are putting the OPS hose under Jack's arm.
116:33:50|ALSJ||The purge valve is used in the case of a PLSS failure to make a purposeful hole in the suit so that oxygen from the OPS would flow.
116:33:58|ALSJ||Each of the hose connections has a ring lock and, in the ring, a 'lock-lock' which ensures that the ring won't accidentally rotate open.
116:34:47|ALSJ||Jack has installed a one-inch-long latching pin in the purge valve.
116:35:00|ALSJ|CDR|Here, we were pre-cooling ourselves with spacecraft water before we disconnected. We didn't turn the sublimator on until we got the cabin depressurized and the hatch opened. The sublimator wouldn't work if it wasn't in a vacuum.
116:35:00|ALSJ||The sublimator will not work efficiently unless the cabin pressure is very low. On Apollo 12, moments after Pete Conrad had gone down the ladder to the surface, Al Bean accidentally knocked the hatch shut while he was making a final check of cabin before going out himself. During the next few minutes, the sublimator put out enough water vapor that, despite outflow through the @alsjurl/DumpValve.html"@alsjt>dump valve</a>, there was enough of a pressure build up in the cabin to inhibit further operation of the sublimator. The pressure build up was very slight and Bean had no trouble re-opening the hatch.
116:35:22|ALSJ||The suit circuit contains a redundant pair of water separators, located downstream of the suit fans. The separators remove excess water from the oxygen stream. A caution light has just come on to indicate that the separators are no longer working. The response has come about three minutes after the fans were turned off. The nominal interval is about one minute.
116:36:25|ALSJ||Now, they will connect Gene's OPS.
116:37:10|ALSJ|CDR|We were getting ready to put the helmets on and pressurize the suits; and that was never a favorite part inside the Lunar Module because it was so hard to move around. With two guys in pressurized suits and both wearing PLSSs, it was almost impossible to move.
116:37:20|ALSJ||As shown in @alsjurl/A14EMUHandbookV1FI-23.jpg"@alsjt>Figure I-23</a> in the @alsjurl/A14EMU-v1.pdf"@alsjt>EMU Handbook</a>, the diverter valve is part of the oxygen inflow connector and gives them the option of directing the PLSS oxygen flow entirely into the helmet (the vertical position) or partly into the suit torso (the horizontal position). Generally, the astronauts put the diverter valve to horizontal only when they were in the cabin and were trying to dry the suits out a little. In the hoizontal position, used in the cabin, all the incoming oxygen stream is divided between a duct leading to the helmet vent and a duct leading the vents in the torso. In the vertical position, used outside, all the oxygen goes to the helmet vent. @alsjurl/A14EMU-v1-f1-10.tif"@alsjt>Figure I-10</a> from the EMU Handbook shows the layout of the ducts.
116:37:27|ALSJ||"Commander repeat" means repeat OPS connection and purge valve installation procedures on Gene's suit. They've just finished doing all of that, so they now take a final drink from the descent-stage water supply before shutting it off.
116:37:41|ALSJ||We have been unable to translate "little jar covers".
116:38:09|ALSJ||One of the important discoveries made from the Apollo samples was that the lunar rocks and soils are extraordinarily dry, lacking even water locked up in mineral structures that one almost always finds in Earth rocks. Because a local source of water would be very useful in the operation of a permanent lunar base, discovery of water of any kind would have been of great interest.
116:38:19|ALSJ||Jack is closing the valve on the Descent Stage water tank.
116:38:35|ALSJ||They are starting the top right-hand column on the cue card. In the Surface checklist, which contains the same information, they are starting the section labeled "Helmet/Glove donning" at the bottom of the left-hand column of @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf2-9.jpg"@alsjt>2-9</a>.
116:39:05|ALSJ||Houston has noticed that the valve setting is incorrect. There is some telemetry from the @alsjurl/alsj-LM-ECS.html"@alsjt>ECS</a> but very little from the suits: water and oxygen quantities and water temperature, only.
116:39:54|ALSJ|LMP|The helmet itself was a clear plastic bubble with a padded head rest inside at the back. The Lunar Extravehicular Visor Assembly (@alsjurl/alsj-LEVA.html"@alsjt>LEVA</a>) was everything else that sat on top on the helmet. It contained the sun visors and also passive thermal protection.
116:40:15|ALSJ|CDR|We were going to be locked in the suit for maybe nine hours and we had a little @alsjurl/alsj-DrinkFood.html"@alsjt>water bag</a> that we suspended from the inside rim of the suit. The bag hung on your chest and had a little one-way valve on the top of it so that you could turn your head and take a drink. It was like sucking on a nipple. And then we also had one of these high protein or high calorie sticks shaped like a ruler. It was a soft stick and you could chew it. We had it inside a little bag, and it was probably about eight inches long. It, too, was Velcroed just inside the helmet ring and we could put our chin down and pull a little bit out with our teeth, take a bite, chew it for some energy. It was typical candy-tasting stuff. It was nice to be able to suck up a few ounces of water now and then and have something to chew on. That was it; I mean, we had no way of eating or drinking anything other than that. But having some water and a little candy was a real help; it really was. I remember that both the 15 and 16 crews had trouble with their drink systems. We didn't have any problems that I can remember; and I remember that, in training, it had to do a lot of times with the way you placed the bag. I don't think there were any great design changes; although, maybe, the one-way valve was worked over.
116:40:15|ALSJ||The @alsjurl/alsj-DrinkFood.html"@alsjt>in-suit drink bag</a> was first used on Apollo 14. On Apollo 15, both Scott and Irwin had trouble getting theirs to work properly. Post-flight testing indicated that "the problem was associated with the positioning of the in-suit drinking device within the suit. After each EVA, the in-suit drinking device was removed from the suit and all of the water consumed, thus verifying proper operation of the in-suit drinking device valve. Ground tests using suited subjects and other equipment configurations indicated that the existing equipment provides the optimum configuration. The tests also showed that personal experience is essential to obtaining optimum individual positioning. Crew training is to include more crew experience in making the position adjustment required for the individual's needs.
116:40:15|ALSJ||While getting suited for Apollo 16 EVA-1, John and Charlie forgot to install John's @alsjurl/alsj-DrinkFood.html"@alsjt>drink bag</a> before he got the suit on. Once he was suited, they realized their mistake and, after some difficulty, got it installed. However, during the EVA, John was unable to reach the drink valve and went without water until they were back in the LM. They got his bag properlay installed for the two other EVAs and was able to quench his thirst from time to time.
116:40:15|ALSJ||After Apollo 16, the crew wrote that "on each occasion that the @alsjurl/alsj-DrinkFood.html"@alsjt>drink bag</a> was installed in the suit, the crew encountered leakage due to interference between the drink bag nozzle and the left microphone boom. In the case of the Lunar Module Pilot, this interference resulted in an estimated 4 to 5 ounces of orange juice leaking on (the inside of) his helmet, his face, and the pressure suit neck ring. After the second EVA, the effect of leaking orange juice on the neck rings of both crewmen caused both pressure suit helmets to be practically impossible to remove. It was necessary to thoroughly clean the helmet neckring with water to remove the orange juice. The drink bags carried in the suit are a necessity to provide the crew with liquid while they are working 7 to 8 hours on the lunar surface, but the bags must not leak." The Apollo 16 mission report is otherwise silent on the matter of the drink bags and it seems likely that an effort was made prior to Apollo 17 to make sure that the crew understood exactly how to position the bags to avoid either the Apollo 15 or the Apollo 16 problems. The effort was successful, because neither Gene nor Jack had any troubles with their drink bags. Note that the Apollo 15 and 17 crews had water in their bags. Because of heart irregularities noted in both Scott and Irwin - although far more noticeably in Irwin - which were ultimately traced to a potassium deficiency, the Apollo 16 crew had potassium-laced orange drink in their drink bags. However, because of the problems they had with the sticky juice, Gene and Jack got their extra potassium in their meals and used only water in their drink bags.
116:40:40|ALSJ||There is a solid, audible click as Jack's helmet locks into place.
116:41:16|ALSJ||They are still pre-cooling themselves with spacecraft water.
116:41:30|ALSJ||Gene is adjusting the back flap of Jack's @alsjurl/alsj-LEVA.html"@alsjt>LEVA</a>.
116:44:21|ALSJ||They are near the bottom of the lefthand column on page @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf2-9.jpg"@alsjt>2-9</a>.
116:44:22|ALSJ||The self-doffing straps are secured to the side of the visor assembly and can be used to release the tool harness.
116:45:41|ALSJ||With the selector in the vertical position, Gene is getting all of his oxygen flow into his helmet. With the valve in the horizontal position, he would direct part of the air flow into the torso.
116:46:32|ALSJ|CDR|I think that, in order to make things easier and save time, all of the circuit breakers that had to be opened for an EVA were indicated with a white dot (on checklist pages @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf1-4.jpg"@alsjt>1-4</a> and @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf1-5.jpg"@alsjt>1-5</a>). That way we could just go down the panel and shut off all of the things that we didn't want running while we were out on the surface. And all the switches that had to be changed had decals on them to show the proper EVA positions. It not only saved time, but it also cut down on mistakes; it was a lot riskier to read down a list of breakers that had to be pulled and switches that had to be thrown than to just take care of all the ones with white dots or decals. You'd done all the thinking ahead of time and, when it really counted, you almost didn't have to do any thinking.
116:46:41|ALSJ||Jack needs to turn so that he can look at his circuit breaker panel. With both of them in suits and wearing PLSSs, there isn't much room to spare and Jack needs to have Gene change his position slightly so that he can turn.
116:46:48|ALSJ||This is a reference to training exercises. They had practiced donning full-sized PLSSs inside the LM and then trade those for smaller, lightweight units once they were outside. Danny Schaiewitz was the engineer who handed them in. He worked for the manufacturer, Hamilton-Standard. According to Ed Brisson, who headed up the Hamilton-Standard operation at the Cape, Schaiewitz was well liked by the crews and socialized with many of them. Some of the other suit techs and engineers who were involved in Apollo 17 were Hamilton-Standard employees Jeff Robert, Ray Arnold, Gerry Goldstein, and NASA employees @alsjurl/a17/a17-rochford.tif"@alsjt>Al Rochford</a> (shown with Al Shepard on 31 January 1971), Byron Smith, and Troy Stewart.

This list was provided by Brisson and Rochford with additional information from Neal.
116:47:07|ALSJ||In the @alsjurl/a17/surface17.html"@alsjt>Surface Checklist</a>, they are in the middle of the right-hand column of @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf2-9.jpg"@alsjt>2-9</a>.
116:47:29|ALSJ||Gene used lubricants on both the wrist rings and on his hands to protect them from abrasion. Here, he is probably greasing one of his hands. Jack used nylon glove liners in an effort to protect his hands. Note that Gene and Jack have taken care of all of the circuit breakers and switches prior to donning the bulky gloves.
116:48:30|ALSJ||One of the glove tie-straps may have broken. If so, it is a matter of no great importance.
116:49:08|ALSJ|CDR|I'd gotten one of my gloves on at this point, so this was my last chance to help Jack with an ungloved hand.
116:49:29|ALSJ||During this EVA, Gene will drill three 2.5-meter-deep holes, two for a heat flow experiment and one for a deep core. If the soil layer had been thinner than 2.5 meters, Gene would have had a difficult drilling task ahead of him. However, as Gene's drilling and other bits of information will show, the soil is actually about 5 meters deep and he will have relatively little difficulty.
116:49:47|ALSJ||Gene is helping Jack don his glove.
116:51:03|ALSJ||Gene may be having trouble with one of his own glove straps.
116:51:57|ALSJ||Here, Gene is referring both to a small mirror that Jack has strapped to his left wrist (along with a watch) and to the cuff checklist on his other arm. The mirror, which is used to see things on the front of the suit is discussed in more detail at @alsjurl/a17/a17.eva3prep.html#1631953"@alsjt>163:19:53</a>.
116:52:26|ALSJ||They are both now sealed inside their suits but have not yet pressurized their suits with PLSS oxygen. The PLSS fans are on and, as air moves through the backpacks and carbon dioxide is removed by the LiOH canisters, the suit pressure decreases and the suits can slowly collapse around them and "bite". The Apollo 12 crew experienced some discomfort at this stage and suggested that, if other crews had the same problem, they briefly turn the PLSS oxygen on to partially inflate the suits and alleviate the biting.
116:52:30|ALSJ|CDR|During my Gemini flight we had tried to use the flow of oxygen through the suit for cooling but decided that that wasn't adequate. So we developed the liquid-cooled garment. The way it worked was that the PLSS had two separate supplies of water. One was a closed-loop supply which was moved by a pump through the liquid-cooled garment. Then you had a sublimator which had another, physically-separate, open-loop supply of water. There was a cooling coil in the sublimator where the water in the closed loop could transfer heat to the open-loop supply and a diverter valve that determined how much of the suit water went through the coil. Because the open-loop supply was allowed to sublimate into the vacuum, it cooled the coils and the closed-loop supply. You could divert around that sublimator if the suit was too cold or you could divert through it and get more cooling. Here, as we've already discussed, we had the sublimator turned off and were running cold LM water through the LCG, cooling down before we disconnected the LM water. We didn't turn the sublimators on until we got the hatch open.
116:52:34|ALSJ||Jack is turning off the flow of LM water by pulling the LCG circuit breaker open.
116:54:29|ALSJ||They are adding a little oxygen from the PLSS tanks to slightly inflate the suits.
116:54:56|ALSJ||They are making sure they are in the minimum cooling setting.
116:54:58|ALSJ||The pump moves the closed-loop supply of PLSS water through the Liquid-Cooled Garment.
116:55:03|ALSJ|CDR|We were telling the spacecraft ECS system that we were going into an Egress mode and are about to depressurize the cabin on purpose.
116:55:06|ALSJ||Houston had requested the changed setting at 115:29:10.
116:55:12|ALSJ||They are now finished with @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf2-9.jpg"@alsjt>2-9</a> and are about to start a suit pressure integrity check at the top of @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf2-10.jpg"@alsjt>2-10</a>.
116:55:13|ALSJ||They will inflate the suits so that they can check for leaks while the cabin is still pressurized.
116:55:20|ALSJ||That is, it's 5:50 PM Central Standard Time on 11 December 1972 in Houston. Gene and Jack are probably getting ready to start the stopwatch function on their @alsjurl/omega.html"@alsjt>Omega Speedmaster Professional</a> wristwatches. The cuff checklist indicates planned EVA elapsed times at which various activities are to start and, by setting their watches, they will not have to depend on Houston to know what the elapsed time is. They will start the watches once they complete the pressure check and begin the final depressurization. There is an entry at final depressurization that reads "Start Wrist Watch :00." The figure ":00" is the EVA elapsed time of zero minutes. See Gene's comment at 118:29:57.
116:56:11|ALSJ||The suits get relatively inflexible once they are inflated, making it even more difficult to turn or bend.
116:56:58|ALSJ||They will turn off the PLSS oxygen supply and spend a minute looking for indications of suit leaks.
116:57:37|ALSJ||The second hand on Gene's watch was at 0 when he started his integrity check and at 30 seconds when Jack's started.
116:57:42|ALSJ||This slight decrease in suit pressure is normal and indicates good suit integrity. The decay is due partly to the fact that it takes the oxygen a while to fill all the nooks and crannies, and partly to breathe-down. Once they start a continuous flow of oxygen, the PLSS will maintain a pressure of about 3.8 psi.
116:58:19|ALSJ||They are still only 20 minutes behind schedule.
116:59:00|ALSJ||A little formality in the proceedings, the only one after the permission to stay for T-2.
116:59:08|ALSJ||They are pulling a circuit breaker on panel 16 so that the LM's oxygen system won't try to repressurize the cabin when they open the dump valves in the forward and overhead hatches.
116:59:22|ALSJ||The repress valve is behind Jack's station on the right side of the cabin.
116:59:42|ALSJ||Opening the @alsjurl/forward_dump_valve.jpg"@alsjt>dump valve</a> in the @alsjurl/forward_hatch.jpg"@alsjt>forward hatch</a> requires bending over slightly against suit pressure. Reaching the overhead valve requires raising an arm and can be a less difficult maneuver in the cramped confines of the LM, especially for a six-footer like Gene. Training photo <a href="images17.html#KSC72PC540"@alsjt>KSC-72PC-540</a> shows the overhead valve at the upper right.
116:59:45|ALSJ||Jack must be facing inboard. Gene wants him to lean toward the window so that Gene can reach behind him to get the overhead valve. In order to reach up with his right arm, Gene must also be facing inboard.
117:00:10|ALSJ||While Jack watches the cabin pressure gauge, Gene will open the overhead valve and let the pressure decrease from 5 psi to 3.5 psi. At that point, he will reclose the valve by putting it in the Auto position. In Auto, the @alsjurl/DumpValve.html"@alsjt>dump valve</a> will open only if the cabin pressure exceeds 5.4 psi. The suit pressure regulators will try to track the decreasing cabin pressure, and keep the difference at 3.9 psi. Because of a finite response time, the relative suit pressure will go up initially - to about 5.3 psi - and then decay. This is a last test of suit integrity prior to full cabin depressurization.
117:00:37|ALSJ|CDR|The valve, as I recall, was just a little circular disk that was held against a seal by the pressure in the cabin. It had a little lever and I could get enough mechanical advantage to crack it a little bit and vent some of the air. I want to remember that we had some screw-type vents on the hatch of the Command Module; but I'm sure that this LM valve wasn't like that. Nothing in the LM was very fancy unless it absolutely had to be. Everything had to be as lightweight as possible, and that usually meant very unsophisticated designs.
117:00:37|ALSJ||The valve is a bit more complex than Gene remembers it but, still, is basically a simple device.
117:01:12|ALSJ||The @alsjurl/lm_suit_circuit_relief_valve.jpg"@alsjt>Suit Circuit Relief (Valve)</a> is in the Auto position and will open only if the suit circuit pressure is greater than about 4.3 psi. Note that the suits were disconnected from the suit circuit when Jack closed the @alsjurl/lm_suit_isolation_valve.jpg"@alsjt>Suit Isolation Valves</a> at 116:33:21 and 116:39:14.
117:01:26|ALSJ||Pressure regulators on the suits are gradually reducing the pressure difference to 3.8 psi.
117:01:41|ALSJ||They will now reopen the dump valve and let the cabin pressure fall to zero. This is the start of the EVA.
117:02:03|ALSJ|CDR|We wanted to leave the @alsjurl/DumpValve.html"@alsjt>dump valve</a>s open because we were going to close the hatch for thermal reasons while we were outside. By leaving the dump valves open, we were making sure that, if any air bled into the cabin for any reason, then pressure couldn't build up inside the LM and make it tough to get that hatch open. Now, I also think that we did have an ability to open the dump valve (in the forward hatch) from the outside. I really believe we did, as I remember. But it was obviously still safer to leave the dump valves open.
117:02:33|ALSJ||As the cabin pressure drops, the relative suit pressure increases for a while.
117:02:44|ALSJ||They are at the top of the right-hand column on @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf2-10.jpg"@alsjt>2-10</a>, waiting for the cabin pressure to drop low enough - to about 0.2 psi - that Gene can open the hatch.
117:03:39|ALSJ||Jack must be facing forward now.
117:03:42|ALSJ||Fully open, either the forward or overhead @alsjurl/DumpValve.html"@alsjt>dump valve</a> will reduce the cabin pressure from 5 psi to 0.08 psi in 180 seconds. With both valves open, the time would be 90 seconds. Including the 17 seconds used to bleed the cabin to 3.5 psi, they are now 141 seconds into the depress.
117:03:50|ALSJ|CDR|The lunar module, in contrast to the command module, was nothing but a tin can that buckled when you pressurized it; a lightweight tin can just strong enough to hold the pressure we needed. When we depressurized the LM, all the skin surfaces relaxed; and when we got back in and pressurized, the hatch would bow out and you could sort of feel and see the panels bow out. The hatch was nothing but a flimsy little piece of metal with a seal on it. And it didn't have a big fancy lock. It just had a little lock like you might find on a barn door: a little lever that fit into a slot. You didn't really have to lock it, because the pressure held it closed.
117:04:01|ALSJ||Jack is probably looking out his window and has seen a bit of debris and/or ice expelled by the escaping air. They are about 153 seconds into the depress.
117:04:11|ALSJ||Gene has pulled the hatch open against about 0.2 psi of cabin pressure, and that is enough of a pressure difference to create a noticeable wind blowing out the hatch. The flow of air is visible because the moisture in it turns to ice crystals as it expands, and also because the wind picks up stray bits of paper and/or other debris.
117:04:44|ALSJ|LMP| I know I had done this once in the KC-135 aircraft, but I don't remember whether or not that was an actual training exercise. We only got about 20 seconds at a time of one-sixth g in the airplane. And maybe we never even tried to open the PLSS (sublimator) water valve for lack of time. It was certainly harder on the Moon.
117:04:44|ALSJ|CDR|Another explanation is that we may not have trained with a 3.5 psi pressure difference. If not, then we wouldn't have had 5 psi suit pressures at this point in training.
117:05:11|ALSJ|CDR|When you moved around, like we were here, inside the lunar module, and then when we were getting out and going down the ladder, it was work even in one-sixth gravity. We had heart rates going up at times, on the lunar surface, to 140 beats a minute. And I think probably through most of the EVA that I did breathe heavy because I've got a fairly good lung capacity - I've never smoked - and I tend to do that. Throughout many of these tapes on the lunar surface activity, you'll find me taking deep breaths and sounding like I'm "breathing heavily". But it really isn't labored breathing so much as me just taking fairly deep, open-mouthed breaths.
117:05:16|ALSJ|LMP|The ECS light came on in response to cabin depressurization. The fact that it came on confirmed that we were depressurizing; and showed that the warning system was working properly.
117:05:22|ALSJ||The water separator is a centrifugal device used to control humidity in the suit circuit.
117:05:32|ALSJ||They have completed all the steps on the EVA Prep cue card. Their EVA checklists are quite different, reflecting the division of tasks. Gene is on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>EVA-1 cuff checklist page</a> CDR-6 and Jack is on LMP-6. Jack is joking, of course, because the first items on LMP-6 after "Cabin Depress" are "CDR Egress" and "Assist CDR".
117:05:32|ALSJ||The small area available to the crew at the front of the cabin is best illustrated by images taken during final Apollo 16 (LM 11, Orion) and Apollo 17 (LM 12, Challenger) LM close-out on the pad at the Cape prior to launch.
117:05:32|ALSJ||A @alsjurl/a16/LM11-co42.jpg"@alsjt>view from above</a> shows the LMP's PLSS (without the OPS) and two helmet bags (containing the LEVAs) filling the space. As detailed on @alsjurl/LM04_Lunar_Module_ppLV1-17.pdf"@alsjt>pages LV-4 and 5</a> in the Lunar Module News Reference, the useable floor area measures about 55 inches (140 cm) from side to side and about 36 inches (91 cm) from the hatch to the base of the 18-inch (46 cm) 'midstep' behind the crew stations. Note that the @alsjurl/Apollo_PLSS_Dimensions.tif"@alsjt>PLSS dimensions</a> are about 26 inches (66 cm) long, 19 inches (48 cm) wide, 9.5 (24 cm) inches thick at the base, and 8.75 (22 cm) inches thick at the top. The photographer was standing on the midstep, with its edge near the bottom of the frame.
117:05:32|ALSJ||An @alsjurl/a16/LM11-co43.jpg"@alsjt>Apollo 16 frame</a> taken through the open hatch shows a member of the close-out team standing on tiptoes on the midstep, with the ECS on his right and stowed itens behind the Commander's station on his left. A similar @alsjurl/a17/LM12-co29.jpg"@alsjt>Apollo 17 frame</a> shows a member of the close-out team sitting on the Ascent Engine cover. Finally, an @alsjurl/a16/LM11-co3.jpg"@alsjt>Apollo 16 frame</a> shows the top of the engine cover with Velcro strips and cloth straps where the LM crew secured the helmet bags after re-installing the drogue and probe in preparation for undocking from the CSM.
117:05:44|ALSJ||Jack will turn from facing forward to facing left so that he can reach over the open hatch (the top is waist high) and help push Gene down below the instrument panel.
117:06:18|ALSJ||The cooling system is not yet up-to-speed; hence the warning flag.
117:06:46|ALSJ||In order to get out of the spacecraft, Gene has to face left and get down on his knees. He then maneuvers himself to his left to get his feet pointing out the hatch. He will then move his legs out, gradually lowering his torso toward the floor so that he can crawl out backwards. There isn't much room - fore and aft - and it takes patient effort to get out.
117:08:42|ALSJ||In reviewing tapes for all of the missions, it seemed as though the LMPs had an easier time getting in and out of the cabin; or, at least, didn't talk about their struggles as much.
117:08:42|ALSJ|LMP|Most of the LMPs were smaller than the Commanders; that might have something to do with it. And you could open the door a bit more without someone standing behind it. And mostly, if somebody's there to help you, he's going to help you. And, if they're not there, you're not going to have all this conversation.
117:08:42|ALSJ|CDR|I think the main reason that the Commanders had a bit more trouble is that, with a fully-suited LMP standing over behind the partially open hatch, you couldn't get it open very far and you had to sort of get down on your knees and slip sideways. Then, once the Commander was out, the LMP could move over to the Commander's side of the LM, open the hatch full bore, and use the whole cockpit for moving around and squatting down.
117:08:42|ALSJ||In a final review of the manuscript, Jack suggested another reason. The LMP always got out later than the Commander and, therefore, had a less rigid suit.
117:08:46|ALSJ||As per @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-6</a>, Gene is reaching for the D-ring to release the MESA, a table-like structure containing tools, replacement batteries, food, etc. When Gene pulls the lanyard, the MESA will fold outward about 120 degrees from the northwest face of the LM. Later, Jack will pivot the MESA back up to a comfortable working height. By allowing the MESA to pivot beyond 90 degrees, the designers have made it possible for the crew to use the MESA even if there happens to be a small crater right where they need to stand.
117:08:49|ALSJ||The Equipment Transfer Bag (ETB) is a soft-sided, padded bag about the size of a piece of luggage big enough to fit under an airline seat, being about 2 feet long and about one foot in each of the other dimensions. On Apollos 11 through 15, a TV camera had been mounted on the MESA so that the Commander's climb down the ladder could be watched. On Apollo 16, TV coverage of John Young's first step was eliminated because of the need to conserve LM battery power after the six-hour landing delay. For Apollo 17, the camera is stowed and there will be no TV coverage until Gene puts the camera on the Rover at @alsjurl/a17/a17.lrvload.html#1180749">118:07:49</a>.
117:09:08|ALSJ||The MESA was located below Jacks station, to the right of the ladder from his perspective in the cabin, and he could watch the MESA deployment out his window.
117:09:43|ALSJ||This is a bag containing the day's accumulation of empty food bags and other trash. Later, Gene will get the @alsjurl/alsj-JettBag.html"@alsjt>jett bag</a> out of the way by kicking it under the descent stage.
117:10:18|ALSJ||Gene is using a lanyard rather than the clothesline-like Lunar Equipment Conveyor (@alsjurl/a11/a11.lec.gif"@alsjt>LEC</a>) used on Apollos 11 through 15. Jack recalls that the LEC was "just another case of somebody looking for spiders under rocks", assuming that things were going to be harder to do than they actually were. Gene is using the lanyard to lower the ETB because it contains the cameras and, therefore, he doesn't want to risk dropping it.
117:10:18|ALSJ|CDR| I think that when I was backup for Apollo 14 we had some kind of conveyor belt that we would use shipping things up and down. Quite frankly, as I recall, it was more trouble than it was worth and I don't believe we had it on 17. People sometimes would overreact and think up solutions to problems instead of sticking to the fundamentals that often worked better. If you wanted to take something up the ladder, you just carried it up, or put it over your shoulder. The things we had to haul in and haul out were not that heavy in one-sixth gravity. But here, obviously, we used a rope of some kind, probably with a hook on it, to lower the ETB straight down from the porch.
117:10:18|ALSJ||The Apollo 11 and 12 crews used the clothesline LEC to raise and lower all of the equipment they transferred between the cabin and the surface. On Apollo 14, Ed Mitchell carried some gear up the ladder without using the LEC. On Apollo 15, Dave Scott used the clothesline LEC for most transfers, although he, too, carried a few things up the ladder. It was the Apollo 16 crew that did away with the clothesline LEC and, like the 17 crew, they carried everything up and down except for the ETB, which they lowered with the lanyard LEC.
117:10:22|ALSJ||As on all Apollo missions, the LM was landed to the west, early in the local lunar morning. The ladder is on the forward, west-pointing strut and, therefore, will be in the LM shadow throughout the mission. As Gene stands at the top of the ladder, the Rover is stowed to his right, in the southwest sector of the descent stage. The Rover is stowed in a folded configuration. There is a thermal covering over the Rover but Gene can see at least part of the vehicle.
117:10:43|ALSJ||Jack is turning off on-board recorder to conserve tape during the EVA. It won't be turned on again until about 140:04:26 during EVA-2 Preps. Jack is also setting voice sensitivity controls on the comm system. On Apollo 11, Buzz Aldrin did not set his sensitivity quite to maximum and, as a result, his transmissions were broken throughout the EVA.
117:10:55|ALSJ|CDR| Getting down the ladder in the suit wasn't any particular problem. It would have been a lot easier without a suit; but, of course, we wouldn't have been going outside without them and they performed just tremendously, admirably. There had been a tremendous amount of technological development in the suit between my EVA on @alsjurl/alsj-GeminiSumConf.html"@alsjt>Gemini</a> IX and Apollo 17. I mean, walking on the surface with the mobility of a Gemini EVA suit would have been damn near impossible. It was just an order of magnitude difference in technological development. Many people don't realize the importance and significance of the suit. It was everything. It was radio communications; it was cooling; it was breathing; it was pressurization; it was protection from the sun; it was protection from abrasiveness. It had to provide mobility, dexterity, safety, and reliability. It was a sophisticated spacecraft in its own right, one that has been, I think, overlooked in terms of its importance to the mission.
117:10:55|ALSJ||As per @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-6</a>, Gene will take a moment to get familiar with moving around in one-sixth g. In doing so, he will kick the jettison pag under the Descent Stage and will comment on their surroundings.
117:14:09|ALSJ||That is, the regolith is at least 8 to 10 inches deep.
117:14:38|ALSJ||There is a 20-meter-diameter, sharp-rimmed crater about 30 meters east of the LM. Gene may be thinking this is Poppie and is probably walking over to it at this point. At 117:45:45, Jack will take a color pan from behind the LM and a little north. Frame AS17-147-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22511"@alsjt>22511</a> shows the crater east of the LM and a set of footprints going out to it. Close examination of the foreground prints show that they are deepest on the west and that there is a fan of dust spray to the east of each print, both indicating that Gene was going east. Out near the crater, there are also indications that Gene left the Crater in a southwesterly direction to go over to Poppie.

117:14:54|ALSJ||By now, this was an old Apollo joke, having been used in some form by the 11, 12, 15, and 16 crews.
117:15:50|ALSJ||The footpad imprints indicate a little forward motion at touchdown.
117:15:58|ALSJ|CDR|-"Fillets were not a surprise. We expected to see fillets on some sides of a boulder and not on others and saw fillets almost everywhere we went. On some of them, you could almost draw lines in the direction that the stuff had come from. We had a good background from training and knew where to look and how to interpret what we saw.
117:16:08|ALSJ|LMP|At some point, and maybe it's here, I stepped down off the ladder onto the sloping side of a boulder which had little balls of glass and debris that made it very slick. And I slipped and my left leg went out from under me. Fortunately, I was still hanging onto the ladder.
117:16:22|ALSJ||Gene is suggesting that Jack take a moment for familiarization, as per @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-7</a>.
117:16:22|ALSJ|CDR|You adapt very, very quickly. You very quickly realize, probably in the first couple of minutes, that you don't need to take baby steps or regular steps to get anywhere. Somehow your brain and your body coordinate your movements and, if you're going to go any distance - 10 or 12 or 15 feet or further away - you start skipping or hop-skipping to get where you're going. And it's not like you start running. It's just that you move with such ease. Later on, when you start moving at faster paces than we were doing here, if you decide to turn or change directions you have to think about your high center-of-mass and plan how you're going to handle that - or you're going to go tail-over-teakettle. But you adapt very readily, very quickly, physiologically and psychologically. You're conscious, as soon as you're on the surface, that you're in this one-sixth g environment and that you can move around so much more easily. I don't think we ever really said anything about it, but in five or ten minutes you knew in a general way what you could do and what you couldn't do in terms of using one-sixth gravity to your advantage. Within the first few minutes, after we got the Rover down, we just picked it up - one of us on each end - and turned it around. The human being is a very unique, very adaptable creature.
117:16:22|ALSJ||Readers should note that Gene's trip to the small crater east of the LM and then to Poppie is roughly twice the length of the 60 meter trip Neil Armstrong made to an unnamed crater east of the Apollo 11 LM. Neil's excursion was made near the end of his 2 1/2 hour EVA while, in contrast, Gene has only been on the surface for 5 minutes. This comparison illustrates the confidence that Gene and Jack had in their ability to adapt quickly, confidence that was based on the experiences of the prior crews. Gene's nonchalance about strolling off to look at craters is a foretaste of just how active he and Jack will be during their EVAs. Only the Apollo 16 crew was their equal in this regard.
117:16:39|ALSJ||Gene remembers that they trained to recognize glass, an indication of very fresh impacts.
117:17:14|ALSJ||Gene has probably started back to the LM. Frames AS17-147- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22513"@alsjt>22513</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22514"@alsjt>22514</a> show two sets of footprints. Both were made by Gene - one on the way out, one on the way back.
117:17:28|ALSJ||Gene may be referring to an unnamed, 200-meter-diameter crater NNE of the LM. The near rim is about 150 meters from the LM. An alternative interpretation is that Gene is referring to the crater he just walked to, which is Poppie. This interpretation would seem to require that Gene has mis-spoken. They are about 100 meters NNW of the center of Poppie or, roughly, at 2 o'clock. I am inclined to believe that Gene has mis-spoken and has, for the moment, correctly identified Poppie. However, at no time during his three days on the Moon, will he be absolutely confident that the crater just to the south of the LM is Poppie.
117:17:59|ALSJ||Jack probably has his knees bent but would not be kneeling.
117:18:28|ALSJ||Jack is now releasing Gene's antenna, held down by a loop of Velcro on the top of the OPS to keep it out of the way as they go through the hatch.
117:20:47|ALSJ||Jack hasn't had a good enough a look to make any confident statements about the rock and doesn't want anyone - the press in particular - to jump to any conclusions.
117:21:54|ALSJ||A porphyry is a rock composed of two different sizes of crystals, usually large crystals imbedded in a matrix of small crystals. Vesicles are spherical imprints of gas bubbles trapped in a solidifying rock. The vesicle may be glass-lined if the rock cooled quickly, or lined with crystals if the cooling was gradual.
117:22:24|ALSJ||Apparently, the @alsjurl/a17/a17.eva1prep.html#1153055"@alsjt>scissors</a> fell out of the ETB as Gene was lowering it. He may have seen them fall, or he may have noticed them on the ground when he got to the bottom of the ladder.
117:22:33|ALSJ||As per @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-7</a>, Gene will examine the Rover before pulling off the protective thermal blanket that covered it on the way out from Earth and, finally, preparing for the actual deployment. In the meantime, Jack will adjust the MESA height and then take care of the other MESA items on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-7</a>.
117:24:33|ALSJ||After adjusting the MESA, Jack is opening the thermal blankets that cover the stowed equipment and supplies. Next, he will climb up the ladder and, as per @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-7</a>, release the Rover.
117:24:35|ALSJ||As was the case with Apollo 16, TV coverage of the EVA won't begin until Gene mounts the TV camera on the front of the Rover.
|ALSJ||Commentary in the following section has been derived from a comparison of Apollo 17 dialog with the @alsjurl/lrvhand.html"@alsjt>Rover Handbook</a>, the checklists, and the video record of the Apollo 15 Rover deployment.
|ALSJ|CDR|I've forgotten the details of how the Rover deployed, but it was a slick operation. It was all done manually but most of the steps just happened automatically as we pulled the tapes.
|ALSJ||A film clip @alsjurl/DukeParker.mov"@alsjt>(8.6Mb)</a> shows Charlie Duke and Bob Parker participating in a shirtsleeve demonstration of Rover deployment. Digitization by Gary Neff.
|ALSJ||Don McMillan has provided an animation ( @alsjurl/VLRV-unfold.mov"@alsjt>0.7 Mb</a> ) of his @alsjurl/VirtualLRV.html"@alsjt>Virtual Rover</a> unfolding during deployment.
117:25:12|ALSJ||The walking hinges are part of the Rover deployment hardware and support the LM-ward (forward) portion of the Rover center chassis section during the first part of the deployment. Don McMillan has provided a Virtual LRV @alsjurl/WalkingHinge.html"@alsjt>animation</a> of the hinges in action.
117:25:21|ALSJ||As per @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-7</a>, Jack will climb to the top of the ladder to pull a D-ring lanyard release which will unlock the Rover from its stowage position. The Rover chassis consists of a long center section and shorter fore and aft sections containing, among other things, the wheel assemblies. The fore and aft sections are folded back onto what will be the upper surface of the center section and the wheels, in turn, are folded onto those fore and aft sections. The entire assembly is mounted on the southwest quadrant of the LM, with the wheels inward toward the spacecraft, the bottom surface of the center chassis facing outward, with the aft chassis up. When Jack pulls the D-ring, the top of the Rover assembly will swing out by about four degrees.
117:25:23|ALSJ||Gene has removed a thermal insulation blanket that loosely covered the Rover, unstowed the left-hand of two deployment tapes and draped it on the landing strut, removed a contingency tool from its storage position in the Rover compartment, readied the deployment cable, and checked that the Rover is properly seated in its deployment hinges. Once Jack releases the Rover and climbs down the ladder, Gene will begin pulling the right-hand tape. This action will, in turn, slowly unwind a cable attached to the center chassis-section, allowing the Rover to continue its outward and downward rotation around hinges attached to the fore end (stowed in the "down" position) of the center section. Jack, in the meanwhile, will keep the deployment cable taut, ready to apply force should the Rover hang up at any point during the deployment. After the Rover has rotated down by 15 degrees, the fore end of the center chassis will encounter the walking hinges which stick out a short distance from the LM. This will shift the point of rotation outward and allow the Rover assembly to lift itself out of the storage compartment.
117:25:57|ALSJ||Gene is commenting Jack's agility as he jumps up to the first rung of the ladder. This is the first time that either of them has tried it on the Moon.
117:26:29|ALSJ||The Rover has released and the top of the package has swung out.
117:26:55|ALSJ||Because of the likelihood that at least one of the LM footpads would end up in a small crater, the Rover deployment hardware was designed to handle up to 14 degrees of either pitch or roll. Challenger is pitched up about 5.3 degrees and is rolled left about 2.6 degrees. John Young landed the Apollo 16 LM, Orion, with only 3 degrees of pitchup; but, on Apollo 15, Dave Scott landed Falcon with 9 degrees of pitchup and 6 degrees of left roll and, in the interest of caution, a trial deployment was run at the Marshall Spaceflight Center before the 15 crew began their first EVA. Both the test and the actual deployment were completed without difficulty.
117:27:08|ALSJ||Jack will be on Gene's left as they face the Rover. Jack will back away from the LM, maintaining tension on the deployment cable while Gene backs away to the right of the Rover, pulling the right-hand tape and lowering the aft section of the Rover. Jack is still on checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-7</a>. Gene is at the top on page @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-8</a>. A set of See, also, a set of @alsjurl/a17/alsj-LRVDeployGrumman.html" target="main">Grumman LRV Deployment Cartoons</a> shows various stages of the process.
117:27:26|ALSJ||Each of them is angling away from the Rover centerline at about ten degrees. Jack is not facing the Sun directly, but it is certainly in his field-of-view and is probably reflecting off of dust particles and scratches on his visor.
117:27:43|ALSJ||At 45 degrees of rotation, a number of things happen in quick sequence: the forward chassis section rotates 45 degrees off of the center chassis, the aft chassis flops down and locks into place, parallel to the center chassis, and the rear wheels spring into position.
117:27:46|ALSJ||At this point in the Apollo 15 deployment, Irwin stumbled and fell.
117:28:15|ALSJ||Gene continues to pull the tape, lowering the aft wheels to the ground. At 73 degrees of center chassis rotation, the forward section, which is attached to the deployment hardware by a bracket called the "saddle" and, in turn, to a pair of telescoping tubes, starts unfolding again.
117:28:38|ALSJ||Once the rear wheels are on the ground, Gene will continue to pull the tape. As the Rover moves out, away from the LM, the forward chassis will finish unfolding, and the forward wheels will lock into place.
117:29:02|ALSJ||The forward wheels have locked into place. The Rover is now hanging at about a 30 degree angle to the ground with the rear wheels on the surface and the nose of the vehicle still attached to the telescoping tubes and saddle. Gene will now take the deployment cable while Jack uses the left-hand tape to lower the front wheels to the ground.
117:29:44|ALSJ||On Apollo 16, John Young tripped over an electrical cable at the ALSEP site, tearing it loose from the Central Station. Here, Gene hasn't tripped over anything vital, but because of the RCU and the general bulk of the suit, seeing one's feet isn't easy.
117:30:02|ALSJ||Each of them has a large pocket strapped to his right shin and another on his left thigh. Although the camera and the general bulk of the suit prevents them from seeing their own pockets, with practice they learn how to use them. Gene's pockets are clearly visible in AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20380"@alsjt>20380</a>, a tourist picture Jack will take at about 118:23.
117:30:31|ALSJ|LMP|-"In geology, 'seriate' is used to describe a population of objects in which successively smaller objects are more and more numerous.
117:30:31|ALSJ||At about this point, Jack pulls the left-hand pin to free the outrigger cable ( @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-7</a> ) and Gene pulls the right-hand pin ( @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-8</a> ).
117:30:52|ALSJ||On Apollo 15, Dave Scott stood next to the Rover and pulled the left-hand tape hand-over-hand. Jack will merely grasp the "LH reel tape" and back away from the LM. In a suit, using one's legs is a lot easier than using one's arms.
117:31:14|ALSJ|LMP|A 'boulder' is anything about 20 cm or larger; loosely, anything you needed two hands for.
117:31:48|ALSJ||That is, pulling a deployment tape and describing rocks as he passes them.
117:31:58|ALSJ||As per @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-7</a> Jack is supposed to pull the tape until " 45 degrees cable slack".
117:32:00|ALSJ||The front wheels are on the ground and there is no tension on any of the cables. Next, they will free the Rover from the "saddle", which is part of the hardware with which the Rover is still attached to the spacecraft.
117:32:14|ALSJ||Each of a dozen or so ALSEP experiments has a cable connecting it to the Central Station.
117:32:19|ALSJ|CDR|Comparing things we were seeing on the Moon with things we had seen on Earth was the only way to go. The analogies may not have been perfect, but they gave people on the ground clear ideas of the important features of what we were looking at.
117:32:40|ALSJ||Jack may be referring to the gait often referred to as the kangaroo-hop, which he had tried in training and decided wouldn't be efficient.
117:33:16|ALSJ||Gene is joking. The Rover has wire wheels.
117:33:19|ALSJ||There are fifteen pins attaching the deployment hardware to the Rover; all have to be pulled so that the hardware can be detached and discarded. Jack's part of the procedure is at the bottom of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-7</a>.
117:33:44|ALSJ||Once they detach the saddle, the Rover no longer will be connected to the LM.
117:34:02|ALSJ||Gene and Jack are picking up the Rover and positioning it so that the nose isn't right under the storage bay. They will move the Rover out a few feet and then align it roughly east-west.
117:34:23|ALSJ||Gene and Jack will now configure the Rover, putting on the fenders, raising the seats, and so on. Jack turns to cuff checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-8</a>. He will start at the back of the Rover on the left-hand side, behind what will be Gene's seat. As per @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-8</a>, Gene will start at the right rear.
117:34:30|ALSJ||They are actually OK.
117:34:35|ALSJ||Each of the Rover fenders is a two-part assembly. A portion extending from a point over the axle toward the center of the chassis is fixed in place, while a second portion is mounted on rails over the fixed piece. Gene and Jack will pull these extensions fore and aft (for the front and rear wheels, respectively), sliding them along the rails until they lock in place. Jack will extend the fenders on the left side of the Rover (from a passenger's point of view), and Gene will extend the right-side fenders. The 'geopost' is an anchor for the scientific equipment rack - the geopallet - which Jack will shortly mount behind the seats. The post is stowed flat on the rear chassis, top to the left; Gene will raise it and lock it into place behind Jack's seat on the right side.
117:34:50|ALSJ||These are latching pins at the connections of the fore and aft chassis sections with the center section. These need to be pushed to lock. They may show yellow if not locked.
117:35:16|ALSJ||The pins would be difficult to reach by hand, and the contingency tool can be used to push them closed without bending over very far.
117:35:55|ALSJ||Gene is trying to pick the tool up off the ground and has fallen.
117:36:43|ALSJ|CDR|Even though the suit was stiff, and even though you weighed 300 Earth pounds with all that equipment, in one-sixth gravity you weighed 50 pounds and could get up pretty easily. If you wanted to be cautious about getting up, and you had a rock or something like the Rover to give you leverage, you could literally get to your knees, get one leg out and, then push or pull yourself up with your hand. However, even though you could get up, you didn't want to fall, particularly a hard fall, because you were always aware that you could puncture your suit.
117:36:43|ALSJ||There will be several "falls" during the mission and, by the end of the third EVA, both astronauts will become fairly proficient at getting up, even without having a rock for leverage.
117:37:40|ALSJ||The seats and seat backs are made of loose weave of wide strips of nylon, rather like a lightweight lawn chair. At this point, the seats are still folded flat onto the chassis, held down with Velcro, and have to be raised.
117:37:54|ALSJ||Jack has probably finished raising the CDR seat and is waiting for Gene to help him with the Rover console, starting with the line "Pull T-handle" on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-8</a>. Gene's role in the console tasks is at the top of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-9</a>.
117:38:12|ALSJ||While waiting for Gene, Jack has checked the front hinge pins.
117:38:25|ALSJ||NASA Photo @alsjurl/a17/ap17-KSC-72P-212.jpg"@alsjt>KSC-72P-212</a> shows Jack (left) and Gene deploying a simplified Rover mockup in the Crew Training Building at the Cape on 8 June 1972. Note the less-than-roadworthy tires. A tech can be seen at the right keeping Gene's hoses clear.
117:38:56|ALSJ||The control console had been stowed at right-angles to the center chassis, pointing in toward the LM between the folded fore and aft sections. Gene has just rotated the console down to put it in good viewing position in front of the seats. The T-handles which Gene and Jack are positioning are inboard handholds which had been stowed in a "down" position alongside the console support.
117:39:23|ALSJ||Somewhere in here, Gene and Jack raise their footrests at the front of the center chassis. Gene is now on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-9</a>, Jack is configuring the Rover attitude indicator on the right side of the console and is pulling a pin to free a caution-and-warning indicator on the top of the console.
117:39:33|ALSJ|CDR|Working in one-sixth g outside a spacecraft was head and shoulders over working outside in zero gravity, as I did on my Gemini IX flight. It's true that, in zero gravity you can float around and move around easily; but it gives you so many other problems. One-sixth g is just enough gravity to give you a 'down', but it's not so much gravity that it gives you the problems working in a heavy pressure suit that you'd have on Earth. It's just enough gravity to give you a reference and it's not enough to hurt you. Much better than zero gravity. I'm a one-sixth g supporter any day in the week. And, even in the spacecraft, when we were out of the suits, eating and working and talking, one-sixth gravity - by far - was much better than zero gravity. You could drink water out of a cup; and, if you set something down, it stayed down.
117:40:02|ALSJ||A roll and pitch indicator is mounted on the left side of the console. It had been locked in position with long pins. There is also a Caution &amp; Warning Flag on the top of the console which Jack has just unpinned.
117:40:17|ALSJ||Jack probably has just discarded the caution-and-warning locking pin. Because of the lack of an atmosphere and the low gravity, a flick of the wrist will send even flimsy objects flying long distances on seemingly flat trajectories; and, as the object flies away, there is none of the fluttering and rapid deceleration that air resistance can cause on Earth.
117:40:39|ALSJ||Because sublimation necessarily results in a loss of water from the open-loop supply, it is best to run the PLSS at minimum cooling as much as possible. When the astronauts are working hard, they sometimes have to run the cooling system at the @alsjurl/alsj-ValveCluster.html"@alsjt>intermediate setting</a> for several minutes at a time. Maximum cooling tends to be very cold; it isn't used very often and then only for a few seconds.
117:40:47|ALSJ||The batteries and an assortment of Rover electronics are mounted on the front chassis section, forward of the footrests.
117:42:03|ALSJ||Jack has probably gotten the deployment cable out of the way. Gene is about to do the LRV Checkout, starting at the bottom of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-9</a>. The power-up procedures are on a decal afixed to the console.
117:42:43|ALSJ||As per @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-9</a>, Jack is at the MESA to get his camera so he can take a pan from the 4 o'clock position (NE) 30 feet out from the LM. This is the only time during the EVAs that he will use color film.
117:42:47|ALSJ||Gene is mounting the Rover, climbing into the left-hand seat. He will fasten his seatbelt, turn on the Rover power, and take a test drive.
117:43:24|ALSJ||Jack has just done a task listed at the top of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-7</a> that he skipped when he got delayed by the MESA thermal blankets. He has hung the big bag on a hook on the inside of the ladder. The big bag - or Sample Return Bag (SRB) is a long version of the Sample Collection Bags (SCBs) they will wear during the geology traverses. The big bag will stay on the hook until the start of the third EVA when Gene and Jack will install it on the Rover gate so that they can put big rocks in it. At the end of the EVA, they will carry it up to the cabin with about 100 pounds of large samples in it. The best picture of the big bag is AS17-143- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21924"@alsjt>21924</a>, taken by Jack at the end of the EVA-3 traverse at about 169:12:28.
117:43:24|ALSJ||Gene's breathing can be heard as he climbs on the Rover and attaches his seat belt. His breathing can be heard primarily because he is leaning forward to get the belt. Getting on the Rover is a relatively simple matter of standing alongside and then jumping up and inward, aiming for the seat. A slight jump and a pull on the handhold does the trick.
117:43:49|ALSJ|LMP|Although we did a little training with me sitting in Gene's Rover seat, there was never any anticipation that Gene would decide that he didn't want to drive.
117:44:04|ALSJ||Jack finds the suggestion incredulous; the lens brush is much too small for the job, being about an inch long and perhaps a half an inch wide. The bristles are very fine.
117:44:08|ALSJ||The @alsjurl/alsj-dustbrush.html"@alsjt>dustbrush</a>, to be used for sweeping dust off the battery covers and other large surfaces, is the size of a large house-paint brush, perhaps six inches across. The bristles, like Gene's dust impregnated gloves, would scratch the visor.
117:44:15|ALSJ|CDR|The dust was very difficult to work in and was a big hindrance. It obscured your vision if you let it get on your visor. It was almost like a dew or mist because it clung to everything. It got on every movable surface, it got in the suits, and when we got out of our suits in the spacecraft in between EVAs, it got in the pores of our skin and got under our fingernails. And it didn't just get on the outside parts of our nails and get them dirty but, literally, it got down between the skin and the nail. It took three months for lunar dust to grow out from under my nails. It infiltrates.
117:44:15|ALSJ|CDR|I describe lunar dust as being like very, very fine graphite. But graphite is a lubricating material; this is not. This is just the opposite; it's very abrasive. And it has a smell very few people, if any, have smelled on the Earth. It smells something like spent gunpowder; like you've just fired a shotgun or something and you can smell that powder. The dust made lunar operations half again more difficult than it would have been without the dust. It took time to dust ourselves off, to clean the equipment. I knocked a fender off and quickly found out that you can't operate in a Rover vehicle without a fender because you throw dust all over.
117:44:15|ALSJ|LMP|I don't remember the dust creating an obscuration problem, except that, when you looked back into the Sun, the Sun would sparkle over it like a dirty windshield.
117:44:17|ALSJ||Gene is reading power-up instructions written on a decal affixed to the console.
117:44:21|ALSJ|LMP|'Wiping out' the controller is a hand motion a bit like wiping a table. It's an old pilot's term for what you do to the stick in an airplane to check that all your ailerons are working, and Gene was just transferring that expression to the Rover, checking all of the controller positions.
117:45:20|ALSJ|LMP|The whole exercise had been put together on the assumption that we would have two pairs of scissors; but, because Ron had lost his and we had left him one of our pairs, we had to keep track of the one pair we had left. And, of course, they'd fallen out of the ETB as it was being lowered out of the LM. We took them out onto the surface just as a contingency tool, but we had to have them when we went back in the LM because otherwise we would have had a tough time opening the food containers.
117:45:47|ALSJ||Jack is going northeast of the LM - to the 4 o'clock position - to take a panoramic sequence of photographs and is now on cuff checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-9</a>. Gene is leaving the circuit breaker for the navigation electronics open and will not initialize the Rover navigation system until he is about to leave the ALSEP site at 121:41:37.

117:47:34|ALSJ||The f-stop settings used relative to the direction of the Sun are shown on @alsjurl/a17/a17magdec_ops.gif"@alsjt>decals</a> mounted on the tops of the film magazines. 'HBW' is High-Speed Black-and-White and 'HCEX' is High-Speed Color Exterior.
117:48:04|ALSJ|CDR|While I don't remember the details, if the Rover hadn't worked, we were going to try and cover some of the same ground; but we wouldn't have gone nearly as far or have accomplished nearly as much as we did.
117:48:04|ALSJ|LMP|It was my position that the probability of the Rover failing was small, so why waste our time in training or planning on walking traverses that you could put together fairly easily in real-time. You knew basically where you wanted to go and you just would have to see how well you were doing and how much energy it was going to take. We couldn't have taken all of the equipment, but we had the bags for samples. I'm not sure we could have mounted SCBs on both sides of the PLSSs - might only have had one apiece - but we could have put quite a bit of equipment in one SCB and samples in the other. It would have been awkward, but there would be no question that we would have gotten something done. The real question is how far we could have gone. And I suspect that on the first EVA we wouldn't have gone very far until we were use to it. But it is still my contention that, if you got up-to-speed striding, you could have gone as far as you did with the Rover. It just would have taken more energy and your walkback constraints would have changed. I'm sure the Flight Control people would have been very conservative with walkback, at least with the first two EVAs; we might have gotten the envelope opened up a little bit for the third. I doubt if they would have let us go to Nansen, because that was right at the edge of the Rover walkback envelope; but we probably could have gotten up the hillside to Station 6, simply by going sidehill rather than directly uphill like the Apollo 14 guys did. But I just couldn't imagine very many reasonable failures that would keep you from having the Rover. You had front and rear wheel drive so you could go either way; and you could lift it out of any hole it got into.
117:48:19|ALSJ||On both of the other Rover missions, steering problems occurred at power-up. On Apollo 15, Dave Scott had no front steering and, on Apollo 16, John Young had no rear steering. For unknown reasons, both Rovers later regained full steering - at the start of EVA-2 in the case of Apollo 15 and after Rover preps in the case of Apollo 16. Because the Rovers all had both front and rear steering, the losses were not of any particular concern.
117:48:23|ALSJ||Gene is driving around the back (east side) of the LM, more or less toward Jack who is still northeast of the spacecraft. Jack's @alsjurl/a17/a17.1174826_pan.jpg"@alsjt>photos of the test drive</a> are AS17-147- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22521"@alsjt>22521</a> thru @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22526"@alsjt>22526</a>. Photo @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22523"@alsjt>22523</a> shows Gene approaching from the south. Note that the TV camera, high-gain antenna, etc. have not yet been mounted on the Rover. Bear Mountain is the dark hill beyond the right front wheel. Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22526"@alsjt>22526</a> is an excellent close-up of Gene on the Rover. Note the light plume of dust coming off the right-front wheel. The tires are made of a wire mesh which is strengthened by a chevron pattern of metal plates. Before taking @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22527"@alsjt>22527</a>, Jack moved away from the LM to the east. This photo shows Gene continuing north past the east (@alsjurl/a17/alsj-LM-Coord.jpg"@alsjt>minus-Z</a>) strut with the South Massif in the background beyond the LM. Note that Gene is driving down into a shallow depression. The vertical post at the back of the Rover is the geopost on which Jack will mounted the geopallet. The boulder in the distance beyond the geopost is Geophone Rock. It is about 3-meters tall and is 200 meters west and slightly south of the LM.
117:48:40|ALSJ||Gene's tone of voice suggested that, just for a second, he thought something was wrong with the Rover.
117:49:00|ALSJ||Jack is trying to take a picture of Gene on the Rover with the Earth in the background. Earth is about 30 degrees south of west and at an elevation of 45 degrees.
117:49:23|ALSJ||That is, Jack doesn't think he'll be able to get both Gene and the Earth in the camera's field-of-view without getting a long way away from the Rover. However, because the 70-mm camera's field-of-view is only about 40 degrees, even at a great distance Jack wouldn't be able to get both Gene and the Earth in a horizontal shot. The key to success, as they will discover during the flag deployment, is to get close, hold the camera at knee height, and shoot up at an angle.
117:49:26|ALSJ||From the LM, Earth is at virtually the same azimuth as the 2300-m South Massif summit; however, the summit elevation is only about 11 degrees.
117:50:09|ALSJ||Gene is still trying to figure out exactly where he landed, and may be driving east to take a close look at craters he thinks might be Poppie and Barjea.
117:50:50|ALSJ|LMP|At this point, I was talking out loud, just getting a feel for what things looked like, transitioning from the theory and the experience of others to personal experience. We expected that craters bigger than some size would penetrate through the soil and bring up bedrock fragments; but I hadn't yet learned to distinguish between regolith breccia (soil compacted and partially fused in an impact, also known as 'instant rock') and actual basaltic rock fragments that would have come off the bedrock. The language I used often wasn't very precise at any point in the mission, but at this point I was just feeling my way about how I was going to talk about these things.
117:51:12|ALSJ||That is, it's difficult to classify dust-covered rocks.
117:52:34|ALSJ||Gene may have driven out to an unnamed crater about 200 meters east of the LM but well short of Mariner and San Luis Rey.
117:52:34|ALSJ|LMP|I wasn't going to worry about where we were exactly. We were close to the planned landing site and we certainly weren't going to have any trouble finding Camelot or any of the other places. (Changing topics) Somewhere, and possibly in here where Gene was describing the landing site, the cuff on my urine collection device was too tight. I needed to urinate but couldn't unless I really forced it. And that was very uncomfortable. Once we got back in after the EVA, I took the rest of the cuffs and stretched them over the handcontrollers in the LM.
117:52:47|ALSJ||There is a very shallow depression ENE of Poppie which may be contributing to Gene's confusion.
117:53:48|ALSJ|LMP|I spent a lot of time in the Receiving Lab looking at samples from the other missions, and had in my own mind a grain-size classification and a variety of other classifications that I'd be using throughout all of this. I shouldn't really have used the term 'gabbro', but it had stuck in my mind as a way to distinguish a coarser-grained version of basalt. That is, if I could see distinct, clear crystals and make a guess at what they were, I think I consistently called it a 'gabbro'. However, by definition, basalt is fine-grained; gabbro has the same chemical composition but is coarse-grained, although more coarse-grained than anything we saw on the valley floor. So I probably confused a lot of people on the ground. But this was coarser-grained than a lot of things that I had seen in hand specimens from other missions. This had grains up to a millimeter or so across, whereas many of the samples (from other missions) were so fine grained that they were even glassy.
117:54:32|ALSJ|CDR|Here, I was obviously getting out of the Rover. And it just took a little while to find out how to do it. With the gravity too low to really pull you down to the ground when you got out, you literally had to push yourself up and out. You quickly learned how to do things the easy way, because there is an easy way in one-sixth gravity.
117:54:45|ALSJ||Cuff checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-9</a> calls for Jack to put his camera in the ETB; however, he is probably setting it on the MESA.
117:54:58|ALSJ|CDR|After we had unstowed the Rover from the LM and had assembled it, then we had to load it. We had to load the front end with all of its electronics, communications gear, and television, and the back end with all of our tools, all our collection bags, all our sample bags, everything else was all loaded on back there. The only big exception was the ALSEP equipment which Jack carried out to the site.
117:54:58|ALSJ||Gene will configure the front of the Rover, mainly installing the communications gear, and Jack will configure the back of the Rover, primarily installing the geology gear.
117:55:03|ALSJ|CDR|This is a very characteristic expression of Jack's, always acting surprised when he finds 'the old brown whatchamacallit'.
117:55:03|ALSJ||As per checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-9</a>, Jack has gone to the northeast LM quadrant to remove the geopallet. Among other things, the geopallet contains a portable gravimeter which will be used at all of the geology stops. The gravity data will give information about the deep geologic density of the valley. Like everything else, the geopallet is stowed behind some thermal insulation. As Jack removed the insulation, the gravimeter and the other gear was exposed. The gravimeter is stowed on the right rear surface of the pallet. AS17-142- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21730"@alsjt>21730</a> is a photo of Gene operating the gravimeter at Station 8 during EVA-3.
117:55:33|ALSJ||The T-38 is a supersonic jet aircraft and Gene is imagining roaring up the valley at about 500 knots. Journal Contributor Brian Lawrence notes, "The T-38 was in many ways the astronaut's personal taxi. They used it to save time in getting from one NASA location to another, etc. They also used it to keep their hand in (meaning that they used the T-38 to maintain proficiency as jet pilots).
117:55:44|ALSJ||Jack says that, here, his intent was to mimic John Wayne.
117:55:46|ALSJ||There being no air on the Moon in which to fly a T-38.
117:55:52|ALSJ|CDR|The LCRU (Lunar Communications Relay Unit) was a couple of big electronics boxes to handle the radio and TV. The whole thing was about 18 inches wide, about 6 inches high, and maybe 12 inches deep; it had dust cover flaps and, when we weren't driving, we could open the flaps and expose a radiator so that the LCRU could cool. We put it on the front of the Rover and, once we got that thing set up, we didn't even have to relay through the LM.
117:55:52|ALSJ|LMP|Either the batteries or the LCRU cooled by using a wax reservoir. Probably the batteries now that I think about it. The idea was that the wax (3.5 pounds) would melt while you were using the battery and generating heat; and then, between EVAs, it would radiate and cool and the wax would harden again. The LCRU had mirror radiators.
117:56:06|ALSJ||The geopallet consists of a two-part assembly: (1) the pallet which attaches to the rear chassis and the geopost; and (2) the gate which, as you face the Rover from the rear, can be swung open from left to right. The pallet contains a @alsjurl/tools/judy28.gif"@alsjt>sampling scoop</a>, a @alsjurl/tools/judy55.gif"@alsjt>gnomon</a>, @alsjurl/tools/judy34.jpg"@alsjt>a hammer</a>, two sets of @alsjurl/tools/judy50.jpg"@alsjt>tongs</a>, two extension handles, shown @alsjurl/tools/judy28.gif"@alsjt>here</a> with the scoop head attached, an @alsjurl/tools/judy80.gif"@alsjt>LRV (Lunar Roving Vehicle) sampler</a>, the Traverse Gravimeter, and six @alsjurl/tools/judy100.jpg"@alsjt>Sample Collection Bags (SCBs)</a>. Jack will attach some of the tools to brackets on the outside of the gate for easy access.
117:56:06|ALSJ|LMP|Eventually, that gate latch got dust in it and wouldn't work. On our last traverse, when we got to the LM, the gate was flapping in the breeze.
117:57:01|ALSJ||Hardware on the inner surface of the geopallet locks onto the geopost. With the geopallet firmly attached, Jack is removing and discarding the handrails he used to grip the geopallet while he carried it.
117:57:01|ALSJ||Training films show installation of the geopallet on a Rover mock-up in the 1/6th-g airplane.
117:58:08|ALSJ||The LCRU has two open sockets which fit onto a pair of short posts on the front edge of the forward chassis. Gene has fitted the LCRU onto the posts and then pushed down a simple lock on each post. He is now mounting the TCU in a "locking collar" on the front of the right-hand battery and is making an electrical connection to the LCRU.
117:58:31|ALSJ||Jack is powering up the @alsjurl/a17/a17-TGE.html"@alsjt>TGE</a>. Measurements can be made when the instrument is on the Rover or with it removed from its mounting bracket and set on the ground. Here, Jack is reading out numbers on the display. The display consists of three 3-digit numbers.
117:58:32|ALSJ||Gene may have discarded some of the TCU packing or, perhaps, a dust or thermal cover.
117:58:32|ALSJ||The B. Manischewitz Company has long been a major American producer of kosher foods and, at least during the 1950's and into the 60's, heavily advertised its wines with the phrase "Man, oh, Manischewitz. What a wine." during Apollo 17, Gene often used "Manischewitz" as an exclamation or as a substitute for swearing.
117:58:32|ALSJ||As Gene discusses at @alsjurl/a17/a17.alsepoff.html#1183952"@alsjt>118:39:52</a>, statements like his "Manischewitz, look at that go! Did you see that?" were later taken out of context by a writer of UFO books to "prove" that aliens had paid them a call.
117:59:05|ALSJ|LMP|Throwing things was fun; but you also had to watch out you didn't hit somebody.
117:59:07|ALSJ|LMP|We were trying to upset the ground, @alsjurl/JSC-OralHist.html"@alsjt>Ed Fendell</a> in particular, and make them think Gene was about to throw the TV camera. @alsjurl/a15/a15.lrvload.html#1210304"@alsjt>Ed</a> was the person who remotely operated the TV camera from Houston.
118:00:20|ALSJ||Gene is in the middle of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-10</a> and has removed the rake from the MESA and is putting it on his Rover seat. In a few minutes, Jack will attach the rake to one of the extension handles and fit it in a mounting bracket on the rear of the gate. For now, Gene is getting the rake out of the way so that he can unstow the antenna storage canister described below.
118:00:33|ALSJ||Sometime between now and the flag deployment at 118:21:26, Gene will put the hammer in a pocket on his right shin.
118:01:14|ALSJ||Both the low-gain and high-gain antennas are in a storage container <a href="..a15/a15lsp026.jpg"@alsjt>stowed</a> on the left side of the MESA. Retired RCA technical illustrator James Burns has provided a @alsjurl/LRVAntennaStowageContainerConfiguration.jpg"@alsjt>drawing</a> of the antenna storage canister he did prior to Apollo 15.
118:01:14|ALSJ||During the traverses, the low-gain antenna (LGA) will be used for voice communications with Earth. Because a voice signal doesn't have to carry nearly as much information as a TV signal, the broadcast strength can be weaker for voice and the antenna pointing doesn't need to be more accurate than about 30 degrees. Gene will fit the antenna mast into a socket on his T-handle.
118:01:14|ALSJ|CDR|The low-gain antenna was a tube about an inch and a half in diameter and about 2 feet long. There was a handle on the mast, right in front of me, and as I drove the Rover, I could point it generally in the direction of the Earth. We could drive and maintain radio contact the whole time, and it worked out real well.
118:01:14|ALSJ||Apollo 17 is the only mission with Earth far enough from the local zenith that the Commander sometimes has to re-aim the low-gain while he's driving.
118:01:14|ALSJ|CDR|The high-gain antenna for the television was on the front of the Rover, as I remember, and we couldn't reach it (as we drove). We aligned it after we stopped; but, if it was, per chance, pointed at the Earth and we were driving in a straight line, we could have gotten television as well. We talked about trying to do that, but I don't think we did. I think 15 or 16 transmitted some TV while they were driving.
118:01:14|ALSJ||Scott and Irwin attempted to provide video during the drive from Station 9 to Hadley Rille, starting at about @alsjurl/a15/a15.sta9.html#1651609"@alsjt>165:16:09</a>. That effort yielded only a few, very brief views of the right-front wheel and the lunar surface passing by underneath.
118:01:39|ALSJ||Probably one of the deployment pins.
118:01:47|ALSJ|LMP|It also kept me busy.
118:01:49|ALSJ|CDR|This is typical of Jack, including the bad pun. I know that I talked out loud about what I was doing, and I still do it today: I play golf and I talk to myself.
118:01:49|ALSJ||A gnomon is a short stick used for throwing a shadow, say on a sun dial. Although there are gnomons on many of the ALSEP instruments, here Jack is referring to the geologic gnomon which provides a shadow, a length scale for photographs, and also, because the shadow stick is gimbaled, a local vertical. The gnomon has a color chart and gray scale attached to one of its three legs and, for stowage, the gnomon legs fold together - rather like the stays of an umbrella - making a slim package that can be slid into a quiver mounted on the left side of the pallet, behind Gene's seat.
118:01:49|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Brian Lawrence adds, "I love Jack's pun. I started thinking about where the original saying 'No man is an island' and guessed maybe Shakespeare, and then discovered it was John Donne. It was published in 1624 and is from 'Meditation 17', from <i>Devotions upon Emergent Occasions</i> : 'No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were. Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.'
118:01:49|ALSJ||Readers of a certain age may recall a far-worse use of Donne's phrase, in a Jefferson Airplane song. "No man is an island; he's a peninsula.
118:02:38|ALSJ|LMP|We're getting the low-gain antenna out of its storage slot in the side of the MESA, and the connector - which may have been a separate piece - had gotten wedged.
118:02:38|ALSJ||This is probably the fitting for making an electrical connection to the LCRU.
118:03:18|ALSJ||Jack is probably clipping the @alsjurl/alsj-dustbrush.html"@alsjt>large dustbrush</a> on the LCRU as per <a href="a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-10</a>).
118:03:33|ALSJ||The only touch-critical parts of the gnomon are the gray scale and color chart.
118:03:51|ALSJ|LMP|Ray Batson was the U.S. Geological Survey/ Flagstaff expert on photogrammetry and was the Godfather of the gnomon. He developed it so they could quantitatively control the stereopairs that we would take on the traverses. It provided a physical scale, a vertical reference, a gray scale and a color scale, and its shadow gave an azimuthal reference.
118:04:33|ALSJ||Many readers will recognize another literary reference, this one from Shakespeare's "Richard III". Jack is near the middle of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-10</a>. Gene is probably installing the high-gain antenna, as per the bottom of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-10</a>.
118:04:43|ALSJ||There were two extension handles, one for the scoop, one for the rake. After attaching the tool heads to the extension handles, Jack is fitting them vertically into brackets on the back of the gate. He will also fit a vise to the top surface of the pallet for the separation of drill stem sections and attach an SCB to the gate for additional sample stowage.
118:05:03|ALSJ||@alsjurl/a17/a17.mr11_2a.gif"@alsjt>Figure 11-2a</a> from the Mission Report shows Gene's heart rate for this first EVA and @alsjurl/a17/a17.mr11_2b.gif"@alsjt>Figure 11-2b</a> shows Jack's. Note that the elapsed times are relative to the actual time of launch, rather than the planned time of launch which is used here in the Journal text. Times on the graph must be increased by 2 hours 40 minutes to correspond to Journal times. Note that, at the end of the test drive at 117:55 (114:15 on the graph), Gene's heart rate reached a minimum of 100 beats per minute and has been climbing while he and Jack have been setting up the Rover. At this moment (115:25 on the graph), Gene's heart rate is rising above 130 beats per minute. Throughout this period, Jack's heart rate has been generally lower than Gene's. This first EVA is their most strenuous because of the Rover deployment, the ALSEP deployment, and, most importantly, the fact that they won't be spending much time riding on the Rover.
118:05:18|ALSJ||From Jack's tone of voice, this may be intended as a pun. He is talking about the vise which is mounted on the back of the Rover and which Gene will used to break apart the drill stem sections of the deep core Gene will drill at the ALSEP site. And, of course, there was - at least in 1972 - no vice (in the sense of "moral depravity") at Taurus-Littrow.
118:05:28|ALSJ|LMP|I was having fun. You're there and you're doing what you planned to do; and you might as well enjoy it.
118:06:33|ALSJ||Jack is attaching the accessory staff to his handhold. The accessory staff has attachments for a map clip and a Sample Collection Bag (SCB). At times during the traverses, Gene will stop the Rover so that Jack can grab a sample with the LRV sampling tool to be described later. Once bagged, the sample can then be put in the SCB hanging from the accessory staff. After Jack finishes attaching the accessory staff to his handhold, he will put SCB-3 on it and will secure the top of the SCB in the open position by using a strap attached to the low-gain antenna lead. Apparently, this operation will take him a couple of minutes.
118:06:33|ALSJ||Training photo @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#KSC72P363"@alsjt>KSC-72P-363</a> shows Jack with his left forefinger on the top of the accessory staff. The handle of the LRV sampler is just below his left palm. The SCB in the lower right is attached to the staff.
118:06:58|ALSJ||Gene is at the bottom of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-10</a>. The high gain is an umbrella-shaped antenna about a meter across. It will be used for TV transmissions to Earth and, because the pointing must be very accurate, it has a sighting device. Gene has mounted the high gain in a "locking collar" on the front of the left-hand battery.
118:07:02|ALSJ||Gene has attached the TV cable to the high-gain antenna mast, primarily so that it won't flop around. See a @alsjurl/a17/a17Velcro20453.jpg"@alsjt>detail</a> from AS17-134-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20453"@alsjt>20453</a>. Gene is now getting the TV camera from its stowage slot in the MESA and will mount it on top of the TCU. He is at the top of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-11</a>.
118:08:23|ALSJ|LMP|Soon after we got back, somebody put out an environmental poster that said 'If you've seen one Earth, you've seen them all'.
118:08:23|ALSJ|CDR|Obviously, Jack and I have looked at the Earth differently. I think we had very different subconscious views of what we saw. That's always been true and it's probably true in all twelve guys. To me, the Earth was a very dominant part of our mission. It certainly made a statement. You could hardly not notice that it was visible. It was a dominant presence in our valley, without question.
118:08:23|ALSJ|CDR|For Jim Irwin, going to the Moon was a religious experience and, for me, it was a spiritual experience in terms of being there and looking back at the Earth, realizing the significance of what was going on. The piloting part was very important for me to do well, better than it had ever been done before. That's the nature of a pilot. And, as for the science - although maybe I shouldn't say this - it was a part of our mission but it certainly was not the overriding part of me, and it's not the part that's overriding for me in my memory bank at all. Of course, for Jack, for a geologist, the Moon was a utopia, a thing you would dream of your entire life. Well, I was not a geologist by trade or profession and, although I tried to be one for the moment, being on the Moon was more of a spiritual experience for me. Religion is what you make it, where you make it. But the mission did bring home to me, very clearly, that Science has a long way to go yet to find an answer for the creation of the small part of the Universe that I was privileged to see. It doesn't make any difference who your God is or how you address him; the Earth was just too beautiful to have happened by accident. There has to be somebody bigger than me who put it together. And when I say spiritual, that's what I mean.
118:08:23|ALSJ|CDR|Charlie Duke is a born-again Christian and who is to say that that might not have happened if he hadn't gone to the Moon. Jim Irwin looks back at it as a very religious experience, but Jim was like that before he went to the Moon. And Jack looks at it from a humanist point of view. What's important to Jack is what Man does with his life; and, although Jack's a very philosophical sort of guy, the creation of the Earth, from a philosophical point of view, is not something that he expresses himself on very strongly. But we all have different points of view. I had the experience of going to the Moon twice, of being able to go back and say 'Is this what I really saw? Is this what I really felt? Is this what it really looked like?' To have seven more days at the Moon to do that is a pretty unique experience in itself.
118:08:23|ALSJ|LMP|On the trip out to the Moon, I had spent a lot of time looking at the Earth. I had this little program of meteorological observations that I wanted to undertake, so I'd already spent a lot of time looking at it, and so that's why I was acting a little more blas&eacute;.
118:08:31|ALSJ||Unlike the TV cameras used on the early Apollo missions, this one is able to stop itself down in response to excessive light levels. However, the sunshade will minimize loss of information when the camera is pointed toward the eastern horizon.
118:08:31|ALSJ||What Jack means is that he has finished hanging SCB-3 on the accessory staff. Next, he will configure Gene's camera and, then, stow the spare film magazines and other gear in a fabric-enclosed space under Gene's seat. He is starting checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-11</a>.
118:09:40|ALSJ||Jack is getting the ETB off the ladder hook. He will take it to Gene's Rover seat and put film magazine Bravo (B) - also known as AS17-134 - on Gene's camera.
118:09:40|ALSJ||A bag can be seen hanging from the ladder hook behind the lefthand side of the bottom rung in AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20482"@alsjt>20482</a>, which will be taken at the end of EVA-3.
118:10:24|ALSJ||The concern here is catching Gene's PLSS antenna on the high-gain antenna.
118:10:29|ALSJ||Gene is trying to find Earth in the high-gain viewfinder. The optical sight is positioned such that it is easiest to find Earth if the Rover is pointing in the opposite direction (roughly northeast) and Gene is standing in front of the vehicle sighting back across it to Earth. This is the reason why, at most geology stops, he points the Rover at a heading of 045. As will be seen at the end of the third EVA, when he parks the Rover at its final location, 100 meters east of the LM, with the vehicle pointed at the LM and, therefore, more or less toward Earth, alignment of the high-gain will be very difficult.
118:10:29|ALSJ|LMP|Earth is about four times as big in the lunar sky as the Moon is in the terrestrial sky; but you don't sense that because you have no other visual references for size. There are no trees or poles or houses or anything between you and the horizon that you can use to estimate how big the Earth is.
118:11:01|ALSJ||That is, Gene shaded the sighting scope with his hand.
118:11:11|ALSJ||There are pieces of Velcro on the seat bottom and on the seat back so that the bottom can be held up and out of the way while Jack or Gene work with gear stowed under the seats.
118:11:44|ALSJ||Jack is working at the CDR seat, loading Gene's camera and transfering equipment from the ETB as per @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-11</a>.
118:12:38|ALSJ||The LCRU whip antenna is used to pick up signals from the backpacks for re-broadcast to Earth through either the low-gain or high-gain antennas on the Rover or the @alsjurl/lm_eva_antenna_en.jpg"@alsjt>EVA antenna</a> on the LM. Gene is opening the thermal blankets on the LCRU, exposing the radiator mirrors, and is about to power-up the TV.
118:13:20|ALSJ||There is a monitor switch and gauge on the left side of the @alsjurl/LCRU-CREW-35.jpg"@alsjt>LCRU control panel</a>. The numbers on the dial are translated in the small chart just to the right of the gauge. A temperature of 1.8 corresponds to about 60F, and a power of 2.1 translates as a bus voltage of about 28. By going to Internal power, Gene was using internal LCRU batteries to power the monitoring devices. Once he has his readings, he switches back to the Rover batteries (External) for normal LCRU operation.
118:13:25|ALSJ||"Four-oh" means "perfect" in Navy parlance. Gene is finishing the tasks on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-11</a>.
118:14:09|ALSJ||TV on.
118:14:25|ALSJ||The TV is being controlled from Houston by @alsjurl/JSC-OralHist.html"@alsjt>Ed Fendell</a>. We are looking south toward Bear Mountain, which is the low, dark hill just left of center. Fendell starts a clockwise TV pan.
118:14:25|ALSJ||The original, 1972 transcription of Gene's transmission at 118:14:25 is "You have? Ah, beautiful, babe. It's all yours. I hope it moves now." In April 2012, Journal Contributor Vlad Pustynski asked me to check the audio because he did not believe "You have?" is what Gene actually said. Listening to the audio, it was immediately obvious to me that Gene had called to Jack before he heard Bob. Throughout the Apollo 17 lunar surface operations, both Gene and Jack tend to speak a little louder to Houston than they do to each other. As can be heard in the audio clip, before 118:14:22, Gene had been talking to Bob. When he calls to Jack, the character of his voice changes and the volume decreases, clearly indicating that he is not talking to Bob. Then, when he hears Bob say that they have a picture in Houston, Gene's voice changes back to his 'speaking to Houston' mode.
118:14:35|ALSJ||Note that the MP3 clip includes a repetition of Gene's and Jack's transmissions at 14:31 and 14:35. It seems likely that the repetition is due to a switch in the signal handling configuration in Houston from audio-only to combined audio-video.
118:14:38|ALSJ||Gene is starting checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-12</a>. The Sample Return Containers (SRCs) or "rock boxes", are machined from solid pieces of aluminum and are designed to hold an internal vacuum in the interest of returning samples to Earth without contamination. The SRC seal mechanism consists of a strip of soft indium metal - a few millimeters wide - in the rim of the lid, a matching knife edge in rim of the body, and O-rings outside both the indium strip and the knife edge. Prior to the mission, each of the boxes was packed inside a vacuum chamber so that there is now no internal pressure and no chance that the SRC will open explosively as Gene releases the latch. NASA photo @alsjurl/a17/a17.s72_50269.jpg"@alsjt>S72-50269</a> shows Jack Schmitt opening a rock box during a one-sixth-g training flight out of Patrick Air Force Base in September 1972. Having opened the box, he is unfolding a Beta Cloth cover which will help keep the seal clean. At the end of each of the first two EVAs, Gene and Jack will fill a rock box with samples and seal it before taking it up into the cabin. The rest of the samples will be taken up in the Sample Collection Bags and will be exposed to cabin air and other contaminants as soon as the astronauts repressurize the cabin.
118:14:40|ALSJ||The Extravehicular Mobility Unit is the combination of the suit and the PLSS and as Gene says, it is a self-contained spacecraft. Here, Bob wants readings on oxygen quantity, pressure, and warning flag status. The oxygen gauge and warning flags are on the top surface of the @alsjurl/alsj-RCU.html"@alsjt>RCU</a> and can be read - as long as the lighting is adequate - merely by looking down. The pressure gauge is wrist-mounted. As Jack explains later, this request for an EMU check is also a disguised suggestion that they slow down.
118:14:58|ALSJ||Fendell reaches the clockwise pan limit and finds Jack working at the left side of the Rover. Jack is transfering film magazines from the ETB into the enclosed stowage space underneath the CDR seat, as per @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-11</a>.
118:15:29|ALSJ||The magazines are labeled "AA", "BB" and so on and usually are referred to as "Alpha", "Bravo", etc. Here, Jack begins a verbal game of using female names and will do so throughout most of the mission.
118:15:34|ALSJ||Those listening to the audio track may have noticed a high-pitched beep at the start and end of each of Bob's transmissions. Markus Mehring has provided a discussion of these @alsjurl/quindar.html"@alsjt>Quindar Tones</a>.
118:15:34|ALSJ||Fendell has started a counter clockwise pan and is looking west across the LMP seat and the right-rear Rover wheel toward the western entrance to the Valley of Taurus-Littrow.
118:15:53|ALSJ||After opening the rock box, Gene is removing SCB-1 and, at 118:17:39, will hang the SCB from the tool gate. He is at the top of checklist page CDR-12.
118:15:58|ALSJ||Fendell is looking at the South Massif. Note the dark tracks just beyond the LM shadow.
118:16:13|ALSJ||There is a small stand or table on the MESA big enough to hold one of the SRCs. There are locks on the table to hold the SRC still while it is being packed or unpacked.
118:16:13|ALSJ||Fendell is looking at Bear Mountain.
118:16:31|ALSJ||Fendell is looking toward the LM ladder with the heavily-shadowed East Massif in the background. The Rover is parked west of the ladder and slightly north of it.
118:16:39|ALSJ||Nominal suit pressure is 3.8 psi. Anything higher makes the suit even stiffer and the work correspondingly more difficult. Here, however, Jack is joking; the difference between 3.8 and 3.9 would hardly be noticeable.
118:16:45|ALSJ||Fendell finds Gene at the MESA. He has his back to us as he tries to get the rock box securely attached to the MESA table.
118:17:16|ALSJ||As on all of the missions except Apollo 11, each of the rock boxes contains an Organic Sample Monitor consisting of a small Teflon bag and, in the bag, rolls of very clean aluminum metal. At the top of the Teflon bag are two metal sealing strips, very similar to those in the individual sample bags described below. Here, Gene is sealing the bag by twisting the metal strips and folding tabs at either end. The aluminum will then be exposed to any contamination from the spacecraft and the PLSSs in much the same way that the lunar samples will be exposed, thereby allowing experimenters to correct for that contamination.
118:17:19|ALSJ||Fendell finds Jack, who is still putting film magazines and other gear under Gene's seat as per @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-11</a>. The North Massif is in the background.
118:17:19|ALSJ||That is, a piece of the thermal blanket that Jack had previously removed from the MESA. The lid needs to be closed to keep the interior of the box from being heated by sunlight.
118:17:39|ALSJ||Gene goes to the rear of the Rover.
118:17:51|ALSJ||The Traverse Gravimeter is sitting on the back of the Rover and needs to be still for three minutes to produce a good reading. Jack is mounting the Buddy SLSS (see below) behind Gene's seat; and, as he works, the Rover jiggles. Until he is done, the gravimeter measurement can not be started.
118:17:53|ALSJ|CDR|I don't remember much about it, except that it was a buddy-breathing system - a set of hoses and stuff - that would let us share one of the oxygen supplies if the other one failed. It would have restricted our movements, but it also would have got us back to the LM.
118:17:53|ALSJ||The Buddy SLSS was actually a set of hoses which would have allowed them to share cooling water rather than oxygen. It was intended for use in the case of a failure of one of the PLSS cooling systems. As for the case of a dual failure of a PLSS and the Rover, it is an open question whether the two astronauts, connected by the BSLSS hoses, could have walked fast enough to get back to the LM from any appreciable distance. The chance of a dual failure was, however, remote enough that providing for a dual failure would have been a waste of precious weight allowance. BSLSS connection procedures can be found on checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17.eva1_cdr47.gif"@alsjt>CDR-47</a>.
118:17:53|ALSJ|LMP|It rings a very faint bell that we had something called a Buddy SLSS; and the fact that neither of us remembers much about it shows how much we felt we'd need it!
118:17:53|ALSJ||Jack consults his checklist and, as per @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-11</a>, goes to the MESA with the ETB.
118:18:27|ALSJ||Fendell is looking at the North Massif.
118:18:28|ALSJ||Jack goes back to the Rover.
118:19:03|ALSJ||Jack takes Gene's camera to the MESA.
118:19:10|ALSJ||Gene begins the measurement by pushing a button marked "GRAV". The gravimeter will work if the outer case is within about 15 degrees of vertical; however, the actual gravity-sensing assembly inside the case needs to be very level and, during the first stage of the measurement, a set of internal motors slowly rotates the assembly on three axes until leveling has been achieved. While this is going on, a light on the top flashes, warning the astronauts not to touch the gravimeter. Once the leveling is complete, the light stops flashing but then stays lit until the measurement itself is complete. Once the light goes off, the measurement is complete and the astronauts can read the measured value off a digital display. Gravimeter measurements will be made at the LM before and after each traverse as a check for instrument drift and measurement error. Measurements will also be made with the gravimeter both on and off the Rover, in part because, in the latter case, there would be no chance of the measurement being disturbed by motion of the TV camera.
118:19:22|ALSJ||Jack takes the tongs toward the ladder. Gene is unstowing the U.S. flag. Once he retrieves the scissors, he will help Gene with the flag deployment that starts at the top of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-12</a> and Gene is in the middle of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-12</a>.
118:19:22|ALSJ|CDR|The flag that we took to deploy was the one that had hung on the wall of the Mission Control Center during all the landing missions. And we also had another flag, which we brought back to replace the one that we deployed at Taurus-Littrow." See NASA photo @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#S7338346"@alsjt>S73-38346</a> which shows Gene and Jack persenting the replacement flag to Gene Kranz in the MOCR in December 1973.
118:19:22|ALSJ||Jack remembers that the idea of taking the MOCR (Mission Operations Control Room) flag to the Moon was his.
118:20:08|ALSJ||Jack now has the scissors, but doesn't have a place to put them. He is referring to the comic novel "Don't Go Near the Water", written by William Brinkley and published in 1956. He turns to face the TV camera and has the tongs up at chest level.
118:20:35|ALSJ||Jack returns to the MESA. Gene is moving north of the LM to deploy the flag. The @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>checklist</a> suggests 30 feet out at 2 o'clock
118:21:15|ALSJ||It is a shallow, six-foot-diameter crater with a soft rim. Pushing the flag staff into the ground would be easy and would not tell them much about the depth or cohesiveness of the regolith.
118:21:19|ALSJ||They move a few steps west.
118:21:24|ALSJ||Jack pushes the staff into the ground by hand. He has his back to the TV and we can't see how far he gets it in.
118:21:26|ALSJ||Gene is having trouble getting the hammer out of his shin pocket. After getting the hammer out, he turns it so he can use the flat to hit the top of the staff.
118:21:34|ALSJ||Gene is thinking about the three holes he will have to drill at the ALSEP site. Gene only raises the hammer about 15-20 cm on each stroke. Sixteen strokes drives the staff about that many inches - about 40 cm.
118:21:49|ALSJ|CDR|I don't know how deep it went, but deep enough that it was very firmly planted. Obviously, we hit something hard, momentarily, and then went through. Nothing's going to blow that flag over.
118:21:49|ALSJ||Indeed, the flagstaff was still standing after Gene and Jack launched back to orbit and, therefore, will remain standing until somebody goes back and moves it or there is an impact very close by. The flag can be seen in the post-launch TV at about @alsjurl/a17/a17v.1880350.rm"@alsjt>188:04:30</a>. Note that the flag is pointing north. Before the launch, as can be seen in Jack's post-EVA-3 picture AS17-143-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21948"@alsjt>21948</a>, the flag was pointing east. Evidently, the ascent engine exhaust exerted enough force on the flag that it acted like a weathervane and swung around to point away from the source of the 'wind'.
118:21:51|ALSJ||To the extent that the flag staff behaves like a pendulum between hammer blows, the frequency of oscillation is slower than it would be on Earth by a factor of 2.4, the square root of six. To the extent that it is behaving like a violin string - for which the frequency is determined by string tension rather than gravity - its behavior would be almost the same as it would be on Earth. Because Jack is still standing in the line of sight, we only get an occasional glimpse of the staff. The vibration isn't obvious in the TV picture.
118:21:58|ALSJ|CDR|There were two sections to the pole: the bottom section which had a hardened top on it so that, when you banged it into the ground, you didn't smash it in. The top section just telescoped down inside the section you banged into the ground, and that held the flag. The flag was on a two-section, curtain-rod type thing that was folded up. You unwrapped the flag, swung this curtain rod up, latched it at roughly 90 degree angle to the pole, and then extended the outer part of it. The flag looked all wrinkled, because it was folded up all wrinkled.
118:22:02|ALSJ||Jack jumps to grab the end of the flag.
118:22:04|ALSJ||Gene is 6'0" and Jack is 5'8".
118:22:18|ALSJ||Jack pulls the lower corner taut.
118:22:40|ALSJ||Gene puts the upper half of the staff into the section in the ground.
118:22:46|ALSJ||Jack backs up, going south to take pictures as per @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-12</a>.
118:22:46|ALSJ|LMP|You couldn't actually see your feet without bending over, but you could anticipate what was in front of you well enough. Going side-to-side or backwards, you just had to be sure there was nothing in the way.
118:22:57|ALSJ||Jack changes his mind, goes east of the small crater and winds up north of the flag.
118:23:01|ALSJ||Gene turns the flag so that it stretches out to the east.
118:23:15|ALSJ||<a name="1182325">Gene</a> has been west of the flag, holding the staff; he now moves to the east side. This sequence of photos of Gene includes AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20377"@alsjt>20377</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20378"@alsjt>20378</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20379"@alsjt>20379</a>, and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20380"@alsjt>20380</a>. They show Gene's pockets, the hammer, his checklists, the dirt he has accumulated on his legs and, beyond the space between the LM and the Rover, Bear Mountain.
118:23:28|ALSJ||Jack probably means "f-stop", rather than "focus".
118:23:28|ALSJ||Each of the film magazines has a @alsjurl/a17/a17magdec_ops.gif"@alsjt>decal</a> (from the Lunar Surface Procedures volume) on the top which shows recommended f-stop settings for aiming directions relative to the Sun. The actual flight decals - such as the one on a B&amp;W shown @alsjurl/a17/a17magdec.jpg"@alsjt>here</a> - are slightly different in detail. Smithsonian Institution photo by Jim Remar.
118:23:36|ALSJ||Jack takes AS17-134-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20378"@alsjt>20378</a>.
118:23:36|ALSJ||Gene takes hold of the corner of the flag with his left hand and salutes with his right. Jack is partly hidden by the flag.
118:23:47|ALSJ||Jack takes a step to his right. This photo is AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20379"@alsjt>20379</a>.
118:23:53|ALSJ||Gene steps to the west of the pole and salutes. Jack steps in to take a close-up, AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20380"@alsjt>20380</a>, then moves east, possibly to take a down-Sun, but does not do so. Finally, he gives Gene the camera and they trade places.
118:24:51|ALSJ||Gene waves Jack closer to the flag.
118:25:04|ALSJ||Jack salutes
118:25:04|ALSJ||Gene takes AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20381"@alsjt>20381</a> then moves to his right.
118:25:51|ALSJ||Jack had moved west of the pole, and now moves back. He overshoots his mark and sprays dust as he stops.
118:25:51|ALSJ||Gene starts to bend his knees and, in an effort to get Earth in the picture along with Jack and the flag, almost gets down on his knees. His first effort, AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20383"@alsjt>20383</a> gets the flag but very little of Jack and the Earth, his second photo, AS17-134-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20384"@alsjt>20384</a>, is much more successful. After he gets up, Gene gives Jack the camera and they trade places.
118:25:51|ALSJ||Using planetarium software, we see that, had cloud cover over the southwestern Pacific been lighter, the @alsjurl/a17/a17earth11825.jpg"@alsjt>Antarctica would have been visible at the left and Australia would have been coming into view over the top</a>.
118:26:08|ALSJ||Jack holds the camera in his hand and gets it as low to the ground as he can without kneeling.
118:26:26|ALSJ||This is AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20385"@alsjt>20385</a>.
118:26:33|ALSJ||This is AS17-134-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20386"@alsjt>20386</a>. This photo shows the "red apple" actuator for the purge valve reasonably well.
118:26:36|ALSJ||Once again, Jack almost goes to his knees.
118:26:43|ALSJ||This photo is AS17-134-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20387"@alsjt>20387</a> and, in addition to having Earth in the picture, it shows Gene's checklist and watch/mirror band on his left arm, the OPS actuator on the right side of his @alsjurl/a17/alsj-RCU.html"@alsjt>RCU</a>, and the OPS antenna on the top of his PLSS. The red bands on the suit and helmet show that this is Gene and not Jack.
118:26:55|ALSJ||They go back to the Rover, putting one foot in front of the other as they walk.
118:26:58|ALSJ||They stop to listen.
118:27:09|ALSJ||Jack moves toward the Rover again.
118:27:28|ALSJ||Jack consults his checklist, then turns to Gene. He is in the middle of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-12</a> and his next task is to perform an inspection of the LM.
118:27:47|ALSJ||Gene is at the top of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-13</a> and, for his next task, he will go to the northeast LM quadrant and unstow a pallet containing hardware for the Surface Electrical Properties (SEP) Experiment.
118:28:23|ALSJ||A bag can be seen hanging from the ladder hook behind the lefthand side of the bottom rung in AS17-134-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20482"@alsjt>20482</a>, which was taken at the end of EVA-3.
118:28:23|ALSJ||Jack moves north of the LM to begin his inspection. In order to look up at the radio antennas and other gear mounted at the top of the spacecraft, he must bend his knees and thrust his hips as far forward as possible in order to get his center of mass over his toes.
118:28:23|ALSJ|LMP|This wasn't an unstable position because there was no tendency to fall over on your back; but you were straining to stay there. You were straining against the suit and that took energy. You had very little mechanical advantage over the suit and, any time you had to bend it, it was work. The Apollo suits were adequate, but there certainly needs to be a major engineering effort on new suits.
118:28:23|ALSJ||Jack is now north of the LM. The Z-axis on the spacecraft is aft to fore, east to west. The Y-axis is left to right, south to north. The forward strut, @alsjurl/alsj-LM-Coord.jpg"@alsjt>plus-Z</a>, is the west strut; the rear strut is @alsjurl/alsj-LM-Coord.jpg"@alsjt>minus-Z</a>; the north strut, beneath Jack's station, is @alsjurl/alsj-LM-Coord.jpg"@alsjt>plus-Y</a>; and the south strut, beneath Gene's station, is @alsjurl/alsj-LM-Coord.jpg"@alsjt>minus-Y</a>. The radar is pointed at the western horizon. The @alsjurl/rendradar.jpg"@alsjt>LM-9 rendezvous radar</a> is shown in a photo by Randy Attwood.
118:29:25|ALSJ||Each strut contains a shock absorber which would partially crush during a less than soft landing and, among other things, leave the engine bell closer to the ground. Only on Apollo 15 did the bell touch, and then only because Dave Scott landed with one footpad in a moderately deep crater.
118:29:27|ALSJ|CDR|'O.K. Number Three Wire' is another naval-aviator, carrier-pilot's term. There's generally four wires on the flight deck and you can catch 1, 2, 3, or 4. Obviously, if you come out of a carrier landing alive, it's successful; but 'O.K., Three Wire' is a term the LSO (Landing Signal Officer) gives you if you just make a perfect, super landing aboard ship. He'll write down the wire he got; he might say, 'low in the groove, number one wire' or 'high and fast, number four wire' or 'slow at the ramp, number two wire' or 'FAB' - which means faster than a bastard - number three wire' or he could say, "OK, number three wire" and that's about as good a landing as you can make. Nothing compares to the challenge of a night carrier landing, not even the challenge of landing a LM on the moon. In a carrier landing, it's dark, you can't see anything, your target's moving around, and it's a small deck. Landing the LM, you've got lots of people helping you; and you've got ways to abort out of it. Anyone who has ever flown on a carrier will know what I'm talking about.
118:29:39|ALSJ||Gene has moved a step or two east of the North Strut and is removing the gold insulation blanket that covers the SEP pallet. He throws the blanket under the LM with an easy motion.
118:29:57|ALSJ|CDR|I had two watches: one inside my suit which I kept on Houston time, and the other on the outside which we started - probably at 12 o'clock - when we started the EVA and could compare with the planned times in the checklists. The timeline was important, and we tried to stay with it.
118:30:30|ALSJ||Gene pulls the SEP pallet out of its stowage position and tries to lean it against the strut. The pallet is about a meter long and about a third of a meter wide.
118:30:36|ALSJ||This is a matter of principle, since none of the other commanders compressed a landing gear shock. There is no indication in the mission report that there was any compression.
118:30:38|ALSJ||Gene is facing the TV camera, holding the SEP pallet.
118:30:50|ALSJ||This remark may be coming from Air Force pilot Charlie Duke who, with John Young, is probably sitting with Bob. Duke and Young were the Apollo 16 landing crew and are now serving as the Apollo 17 backup crew. Jack's picture of the rear landing gear is AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20388"@alsjt>20388</a>.
118:31:01|ALSJ|CDR|I had a firm idea in my mind about how I wanted to land. I wanted to bring that thing down as quickly as possible and then, when we got down within the 50 or 60 feet range, slow down to two or three per second and maintain two or three feet per second and a little forward velocity of a foot or so per second forward. You learned very quickly in the @alsjurl/LLTV-952.html"@alsjt>LLTV</a> that if you tried to get it down at about one foot per second, all of a sudden you started hovering, or maybe you put a little bit too much thrust in and you started going up a little. So I tried to keep going down.
118:31:01|ALSJ||After resting a moment from the effort of getting the SEP pallet out of the LM, Gene goes to the Rover.
118:31:36|ALSJ||Busy as they are, Gene and Jack don't always hear what each other is saying or remember what was just said.
118:31:49|ALSJ||Jack goes to the Rover and, out of view of the TV, takes Gene's camera off and stows it under the CDR seat as per @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-12</a>. He then leaves again. While at the Rover, he may have taken AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20389"@alsjt>20389</a>, which is a good picture of the front of the vehicle and the LCRU, the LCRU mirrors, the TV camera, the TCU, the @alsjurl/a17/alsj-dustbrush.html"@alsjt>big dustbrush</a>, and some cup-type sample bags which, later, Jack will attach to his LRV sampler.
118:32:07|ALSJ||This is probably the rock that disappears sometime between now and the end of EVA-2. Jack makes brief references to the disappearance at 123:40:07 and 147:36:11.
118:32:07|ALSJ||Jack turns to the east so he can get some light on his camera to check either the settings or the frame count.
118:32:07|ALSJ||Gene is now making a measurement with the @alsjurl/a17/a17-TGE.html"@alsjt>TGE</a> sitting on the ground.
118:32:54|ALSJ||Jack has tripped.
118:32:55|ALSJ||Gene is looking at Earth.
118:33:06|ALSJ||Jack can see that the TV camera is pointed in his general direction; however, he was moving too quickly for Fendell to follow and wasn't actually in the field-of-view when he tripped.
118:33:10|ALSJ||Jack may have just read the line "Note @alsjurl/a17/a17-TGE.html"@alsjt>TGE</a> Status" on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-12</a>. Note that Jack should have checked the TGE status before stowing Gene's camera at 118:31:52. If the TGE had been on the Rover with a measurement in progress, Jack would have disturbed it.
118:33:24|ALSJ||Gene goes to the SEP pallet which is still leaning against the (north) strut; Jack goes to the MESA to deploy the Cosmic Ray experiment at per @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-12</a>.
118:33:26|ALSJ||Gene is about to remove the SEP receiver package from the pallet.
118:33:30|ALSJ||Jack is asking for a future reminder about the frame count.
118:33:39|ALSJ||Fendell starts a TV pan. The @alsjurl/a17/a17experiment_sep_en.jpg"@alsjt>SEP</a> receiver/recorder is a box about one-foot on each side. Gene will mount the receiver on the inner surface of the geopallet and the extendible, three-section SEP receiving antenna on the geopost immediately behind Jack's Rover seat, as can be seen in training photos @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#S7250270"@alsjt>S72-50270</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#S7248890"@alsjt>S72-48890</a>. After the EVA-1 traverse, Gene and Jack will deploy a low-frequency (a few megahertz) radio transmitter about 150 meters east of the LM and then, during the EVA-2 and EVA-3 traverses will record signals which, having been altered by their passage through lunar materials, will give experimenters indications of the local structure down to depths of a few kilometers.
118:33:39|ALSJ||Training film shows Gene installing the receiver and antenna on a Rover mock-up in the 1/6th-g airplane.
118:34:25|ALSJ||The SEP receiver is temperature sensitive. Later in the mission, the fasteners on the SEP receiver dust cover will fail, the radiator will get enough dust on it that Gene will never be able to get it properly cleaned, and the temperature will rise to the point that the instrument shuts itself off.
118:34:25|ALSJ||Fendell is looking at the U.S. flag with the North Massif in the background.
118:34:41|ALSJ||Details of the SEP receiver antenna deployment are given on a decal.
118:35:03|ALSJ||Jack is deploying the cosmic ray experiment as per @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-12</a>, a cousin to the solar wind experiment flown on Apollos 11, 12 and 15. It is simpler version of the cosmic ray experiment flown on Apollo 16 as part of that ALSEP package. The Apollo 17 experiment consists of detectors referred to as "Sun" and "Shade". Jack is using a strap to hang the "Shade" detector - in the shade, of course - from one of the @alsjurl/a17/alsj-LM-Coord.jpg"@alsjt>plus-Z</a> (west) strut supports. He will then hang the "Sun" detector - in full sunlight - from one of the @alsjurl/a17/alsj-LM-Coord.jpg"@alsjt>minus-Z</a> (east) supports. Deployment of the cosmic ray package is optional at this point in the checklist. Had Jack been seriously behind the timeline, he could have delayed deployment until the end of the second EVA, as shown on EVA-2 pages LMP-28 and CDR-30.
118:35:12|ALSJ||Note that, as indicated on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-13</a> details of the SEP Receiver Antenna deployment are listed on decals afixed to the instrument. At present, I do not have copies of those decals.
118:36:27|ALSJ||The "high bay" is in the Flight Crew Training Building at the Cape. Fendell finds Gene at the rear of the Rover, mounting the SEP.
118:36:39|ALSJ||Jack is about to remove the ALSEP from its storage compartment in the southeast quadrant of the LM, and is afraid that he might hit the "Sun" part of the cosmic ray experiment. He is at the top of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-13</a> and his first task is to open the doors of the Scientific Equipment (SEQ) Bay.
118:36:39|ALSJ||The SEQ Bay has a small, vertically hinged door on the left, which Jack will open first. It also has a two-secton, horizontally hinged door that is opened by pulling on a lanyard. Diagrams on @alsjurl/SEQdoors.jpg"@alsjt>page 58</a> of Scott Sullivan's <i>Virtual LM</i> illustrate the way the main door is hinged. Additonal details can be found on pages 38 to 47.
118:37:04|ALSJ||The repetition of Jack's 118:37:04 transmission in the MP3 file may be the result of a change of tapes by the audio technician at NASA Johnson who, in 1989, made the cassette copies used years later to make the MP3 file.
118:37:25|ALSJ|CDR|At one time, I think there was a pulley we could use to lower the ALSEP to the ground. We probably took them off. I didn't like all that extra garbage; I thought we could handle things quicker without all those crutches. It was just a matter of wanting fewer things to mess with. But Jack found himself, as he said, 'in the hole' and had to reach higher than he wanted.
118:37:31|ALSJ|LMP|There were some pulleys originally, but we had more problems with them than they were worth. As it turned out, I don't think we had a great deal of problems getting the packages out.
118:37:34|ALSJ||As per @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-13</a> Gene may be attaching the SEP Nav cable to the Rover. This cable probably carries information from the Rover Nav system to the SEP recorder.
118:38:19|ALSJ|CDR|This is a response to "should you send man or machine into space?" We've had a lot of controversy and comment on that over the years, and this was just a subtle little comment to reinforce man's usefulness in space, even for a seemingly simple operation.
118:38:27|ALSJ||The ECA Monitor measures the temperature of the ALSEP's radionuclide fuel element.
118:38:54|ALSJ|LMP|Although we'd learned a lot of things from the prior crews, we'd never personally had a chance to do things in one-sixth gravity. One-sixth gravity is something you can take advantage of, and we learned very quickly. For example, because things don't accelerate as quickly, you just have more time to react. I often found that if I had something like the hammer in one hand, and I wanted to shift it to the other hand, rather than actually move my hands together, I could just flip it and catch it. Moving your hands together is a lot of work in the suit; but if you just flip something, that's not much work at all. Here, Gene may have instinctively done something the way he would have in one gravity and realized there was an easier way to do it in one-sixth gravity; or he just forgot - as I often did, and I think we all did in the intensity of the moment - what was the best way to do something.
118:39:16|ALSJ||The Radioisotope Thermal Generator (RTG) is the ALSEP power generator and is the major piece of equipment in one of the two ALSEP packages. The fuel element is stored separately and Jack will extract it from its transport cask after he has prepared the RTG to receive it.
118:39:29|ALSJ||Jack is getting the other ALSEP package down. This one contains the Central Station and most of the experiment modules.
118:39:41|ALSJ|LMP|In the early days of EVA training, down in Florida on a not-very-well-simulated lunar surface we had outside the simulator building, we were operating with air cooling; we were just forcing (chilled) air through the suit. I was responsible for orchestrating a lot of the training, and I remember for Apollo 12 I got increasingly worried about the heat loads that were building up during this EVA training in the pressurized suits. Even with the lightweight backpack, Conrad and Bean were working awfully hard and getting awfully hot, just as I had in running some of the simulations. I was afraid we were going to hurt somebody because some of these guys, probably myself included, once they got involved in a task, were the sort who wouldn't say 'quit' until they passed out. And we certainly didn't need that. So I started to talk with the support crew and basically asked them if we could figure out a way to use ice water in the liquid-cooled underwear. Several guys went to work on that and what they did was add a water hose to the air hose we were already using and connected it to the liquid-cooled garment and then carried around a supply of ice water on their own backs. It made all the difference in the world; it was still tough, but at least you didn't get overheated. So there was always a guy around carrying your ice-water supply, but they were very good at staying out of sight behind you, and you had to turn real quick to know they were there. And that's what I was talking about.
118:39:41|ALSJ||Interested readers will find a second version of this story at @alsjurl/a17/a17.sta2.html#1425040"@alsjt>142:50:40</a>.
118:39:41|ALSJ|CDR|As I read through this, I remember seeing a book or an article that somebody put together about how, on Apollo 17, we were visited by an outer-space alien. They took our lunar surface transcripts and pulled out unique parts of them which made it sound as if we were referring to somebody else being there. I remember one thing in particular: (at the end of EVA-1 at 123:28:30) we had a piece of foam rubber or something crack and sort of blow up in the sky, and I said 'What's that?' And here, I'm saying, 'Hey, you notice there's none of those guys up there holding those hoses.' And we go around the LM and Jack says, 'What do you mean? I just saw one a minute ago.' And these people, or this guy, took these kinds of things out of our transcripts, out of context, and put a whole story together that was almost believable. If I hadn't been there myself, I would have thought that an alien spacecraft landed next to us and these comments were referring to that. It was amazing what you can do with editing.
118:39:41|ALSJ||Training photo @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#S7244420"@alsjt>S72-44420</a> shows Gene working with the Traverse Gravimeter at the back of the one-g LRV trainer during a session at the Cape. The techs supplying Gene's cooling water are keeping out of sight behind him. Note that the LRV was not equipped with a geo-pallet for the training session shown.
118:40:02|ALSJ||Gene is at the top of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-14</a> and is offloading four seismic charges which are stowed in one of two transporters (Xprtr) stowed in the Descent Stage. The other transporter contains charges number 1, 2, 3, and 8. He will mount the transporter on the back of the Rover and later, during the geology traverses he and Jack will deploy the charges at pre-planned spots. Eventually, after Gene and Jack have left the Moon, experimenters back on Earth will transmit detonation signals to the charges, one by one.
118:40:02|ALSJ||Training photo @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#S7248887"@alsjt>S72-48887</a> shows one of the charge transporters mounted behind Gene's Rover seat.
118:40:02|ALSJ||Fendell is looking at a large rock - perhaps a foot across - just south of the Rover.
118:40:45|ALSJ||Bob is quoting something Charlie Duke said during Apollo 16 at @alsjurl/a16/a16.eva1post.html#1265458"@alsjt>126:54:58</a>.
118:41:13|ALSJ|CDR|This was not an old joke; but here I am, on the lunar surface in this big, mountainous terrain, and he's telling me it looks flat and smooth!
118:41:20|ALSJ||Gene has finished mounting the Explosion Package Transporter on the back of the Rover and, as per @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-14</a> is making the @alsjurl/a17/a17-TGE.html"@alsjt>TGE</a> reading he started at @alsjurl/a17/#1183214"@alsjt>118:32:14</a>.
118:41:20|ALSJ||After the three minute leveling/measurement period is over, the digital display remains lit for twenty seconds and then goes off to conserve the internal batteries. Punching the Read button re-illuminates the display and shows the measurement values for another 20 seconds. This can be done repeatedly. The top of the instrument is about eight inches long and about four across.
118:42:09|ALSJ||Gene is making sure that the SEP pallet - which he had previously leaned against the north strut - is properly oriented in relation to the Sun so that the remaining equipment can warm up.
118:42:20|ALSJ||All that is necessary is that the Sun not be shining into the interior.
118:42:49|ALSJ||Note that @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-14</a> has a notation on the right-hand side, set off by a bracket, which indicates that, if they were both on the timeline, Jack would be fueling the RTG at this point. The fueling procedures are on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-13</a>.
118:42:54|ALSJ||The Apollo 12 crew had trouble removing the fuel element because of a too-tight fit in the transport cask. The design was modified before the Apollo 13 launch and no further problems of that kind were experienced by any of the crews.
118:42:56|ALSJ||Gene is getting out a storage bag for the sections of deep core they will obtain at the ALSEP site. He is in the middle of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-14</a> and will put the bag on the LMP Rover seat.
118:43:13|ALSJ||The gravimeter only shifted a little when he punched the Grav button the second time.
118:43:46|ALSJ||Gene is working at the right side of the Rover. He reaches under Jack's seat for the maps. These are copies of photos taken from orbit by the Apollo 15 crew. Contour maps are printed on the back showing the planned traverse routes.
118:43:46|ALSJ||Gene waves into the TV.
118:44:07|ALSJ|CDR|In listening to the tape just now, I knew before he said it that Bob was going to come back with 'Hello, Challenger.' That's just typical of both Jack and Bob: playing verbal games, having fun.
118:44:07|ALSJ||Gene has two maps in his hands and turns them a couple times, making sure he has the correct one on top and properly oriented. He then clips them in the holder on the accessory staff. This task is not on Gene's checklist. According to the checklists, Jack was supposed to have placed the maps on the LMP seat as part of the tasks on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-11</a> and, apparently, they were supposed to stay there until, after the ALSEP deployment, Jack clips them to the accessory staff. Apparently, Gene had gotten used to finding the maps on the LMP seat at this point in his activities and, not seeing them there now, asked Jack and then decided to take a few seconds to clip them to the staff.
118:44:48|ALSJ||Gene goes to the MESA, then to the Rover, and finally to the gravimeter.
118:45:26|ALSJ||The "dome" is the removable lid on the @alsjurl/rtg.cask.detail.jpg"@alsjt>fuel cask</a>.
118:45:57|ALSJ||Fendell is looking past the north strut at the crater east of the LM.
118:45:57|ALSJ||The gravimeter has internal heaters to keep the key sensor at a temperature of 322 &plusmn; 0.01 degrees Kelvin. That way, the physical characteristics of the sensor don't change significantly between one measurement and the next.
118:45:57|ALSJ||Fendell is looking toward the Sculptured Hills.
118:46:27|ALSJ||By punching another button, marked "Bias", Gene activates a mechanism which, in essence, inverts the gravity sensing components and permits a determination of factors in the equation relating the instrument reading to an actual value for the local gravitational acceleration.
118:46:33|ALSJ||Fendell is looking at a large boulder northeast of the LM.
118:46:36|ALSJ||Jack is on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-13</a>.
118:46:57|ALSJ||If the Central Station can't be fueled, none of the ALSEP experiments will work. The fuel element is under the @alsjurl/rtg.cask.detail.jpg"@alsjt>dome</a>, so the dome will have to be taken off if they are to fuel the ALSEP.
118:46:57|ALSJ|LMP|The fuel element was in a graphite capsule hanging on the outside of the LM next to the ALSEP stowage area. You tilted it down to a horizontal position so that you could get at the @alsjurl/rtg.cask.detail.jpg"@alsjt>dome</a> to get it off. The theory behind the capsule was that, if you had a breakup during launch or a re-entry because of an accident in orbit, the capsule would separate and re-enter intact so that the element itself would not be exposed and put plutonium into the atmosphere. So you had to take the capsule apart by taking this dome off; we had a special tool to do that and another tool to latch onto the fuel element and extract it out of the graphite capsule. I don't think there were threads involved in the dome removal. If I remember correctly, it had three prongs and pins and you put them in slots and you screwed the pins in and that released the catches that were holding the dome in there. Clearly there was a turning that was involved and something had gotten stripped.
118:46:57|ALSJ||In a subsequent discussion (and a follow-up, 11/4/91 memorandum), Roy Zocher, a Los Alamos engineer who participated in the design of the Apollo SNAP-27 RTG, provided the following information about the fuel cask:
118:46:57|ALSJ||Zocher - "Originally, the SNAP-27 design was consistent with the earlier concept of high altitude (400,000 ft) dispersion of fuel in an orbital decay or re-entry accident. After the RTG program was started, new direction was received which dictated re-entry and earth-impact survivability for the plutonium heat source. That direction, in turn, inspired the design that was ultimately flown. In addition, there was an early design constraint to separate the heat source and converter, since the launch loads were too high for the RTG if the heat source was flown in the converter."
118:46:57|ALSJ||The heat source canister was located on the exterior of the LM to afford a free release in a re-entry accident. (A free release) did occur with the heat source canister from the aborted Apollo 13 mission. That canister resides at the bottom of the ocean in the Tonga Trench, without release of fuel. The fuel canister location on the LM was not related to radiation considerations. Radiation exposure to the astronauts (from the fuel element) was not a significant factor - from both time and source-intensity perspectives. The design concept of the heat source entering the atmosphere, and the subsequent hard-surface impact was proven by an extensive and well documented test program.
118:46:57|ALSJ||It is no accident that the Apollo 13 fuel cask lies in the very deepest part of the ocean. Andrew Chaikin tells me that, among the many things that had to be done during the Apollo 13 rescue was to design the return trajectory and LM jettison timing so that the fuel capsule would end up in the Tonga Trench.
118:47:02|ALSJ||Jack rarely stutters.
118:47:24|ALSJ|CDR|To get the fuel element out, you tilted the cask and used this removal tool. You didn't want to get too close to the fuel, because it was radioactive (and, more importantly, was thermally hot enough to damage the suit); so, once you had the dome off, you would use the tool to pull the fuel element out. Well, with the dome threads stripped, we were going to have to use the sharp point of the hammer to pry the dome off.
118:47:50|ALSJ||They have averted the loss of a major mission objective. Gene goes to the ladder, puts the hammer back in his shin pocket, turns a checklist page, and reads.
118:47:51|ALSJ||Gene is standing at the bottom of the ladder and is examining the checklist on his left wrist, possibly looking ahead to @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-15</a>.
118:48:08|ALSJ||The following is extracted from the Apollo 17 Mission Report. "The socket on the removal tool can engage the nut on the dome before the pins on the tool lock into the recess in the dome (@alsjurl/a17/a17.mr15_22.gif"@alsjt>Fig. 15-22</a>). The LMP did not verify that the pins were locked. In this configuration, rotating the tool clockwise will rotate the nut on the dome. A 90-degree rotation of the nut releases the dome retaining straps, as noted by the crew. This release allows the dome to rotate when the tool is rotated another 60 degrees, thus disengaging the threaded dome/cask interface. However, with the pins not locked into the dome recess, the dome could be cocked but not withdrawn. The dome was easily wedged off the cask with the hammer. The sequence can be duplicated with either broken pins or by incomplete insertion and locking of the pins.
118:48:32|ALSJ||Gene turns and watches Jack transfer the fuel element.
118:48:35|ALSJ||Gene makes his way to the MESA.
118:49:16|ALSJ||One of the many advantages of the TV is that, in cases like this where there is a question about the configuration of some piece of equipment, experts on the ground can actually see what the astronauts would otherwise have to describe verbally.
118:49:25|ALSJ||Gene is kneeling at the MESA, removing the drill. Getting up again is relatively easy because he can hold on to the MESA.
118:49:25|ALSJ||The SEQ is the ALSEP storage compartment. Closing these southeast-facing doors prevents the interior of the descent stage from heating.
118:49:36|ALSJ||That is, he didn't bump into it while getting the ALSEP packages out.
118:50:01|ALSJ||The TV jiggles, indicating that Gene is putting the drill on the LMP Rover seat.
118:50:05|ALSJ||Evans, in the Command Module, and the surface crew both have VHF transmitters and receivers. During most of the three days of surface operations, Evans will have his VHF transmitter powered down. Evidently, he is inadvertently transmitting the carrier signal at this point and interfering with comm on the surface.
118:50:18|ALSJ||Gene will take the drill out to the ALSEP site on the Rover and is strapping it into Jack's seat. NASA photo @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#72H1190"@alsjt>72-H-1190</a> shows Gene on the 1g-trainer at the Cape, waiting for some tour busses to pass. The drill is belted on Jack's seat.
118:50:18|ALSJ||On Apollo 16, one of the two ALSEP packages fell off of the carrying handle while Charlie Duke was walking out to the ALSEP site. Jack is now at the top of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-14</a> and will carry the ALSEP packages about 300 feet west of the LM. The handwritten notation "Thumb=350'" suggests that Jack had figured out a way of using his thumb to determine when he was 350 feet (107 m) from the LM. One obvious method is to turn occasionally during the walk out to the deployment sight and compare the apparent size of his thumb with the LM. The LM is 23 feet (7.0m) tall and, at 350 feet (107 m) subtends 3.75 degrees. When held at arm's length, my thumb is about 0.6 m from my eyes. At that distance, a part of the gloved thumb needs to be 3.9 cm across to subtend 3.75 degrees. Because this is about the diameter of a gloved thumb, this may have been the method Jack was using. Journal contributor Jim Scotti notes that Jack appears to use this method shortly after 118:52:17, below.
118:50:53|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Harald Kucharek reminds us that Jack is singing the first line of the title song of the 1939 MGM film 'The Wizard of Oz', starring Judy Garland.
118:51:07|ALSJ||Jack comes around the south side of the LM and heads west. His path out to the eventual ALSEP site can be traced in a @alsjurl/a17/a17.ascent1.jpg"@alsjt>frame from the on-board 16-mm camera taken during the ascent</a>. The more direct path represents a run Jack made back to the LM at about @alsjurl/a17/a17.trvsta1.html#1213439"@alsjt>121:34:39</a> and, as well, a round-trip he made to the ALSEP site during the EVA-3 close-out. Compare with the LRV TV record and a @alsjurl/a17/as17-22199-201.jpg"@alsjt>post-EVA-3 window mini-pan</a>. A @alsjurl/a17/as17-22199-201lbl.jpg"@alsjt>labeled version</a> is also available. Gene also drove the Rover from the LM to the ALSEP site and back on two occasions but the evidence suggests that a running astronaut disturbs the surface more than does the Rover. For example, see note the disturbance of the surface where John Young and Charlie Duke walked at Station 10-Prime, as shown in AS16-117-@alsjurl/a17/a16/AS16-117-18826.jpg"@alsjt>18826</a>. In that shot, we see a fan of soil flying forward as a result of John stepping forward with his right foot.
118:51:07|ALSJ||Jack has been carrying the ALSEP with palms down; now he switches to palms-up, one hand at a time, with slight tosses of the bar.
118:51:07|ALSJ|LMP|The ALSEP turned out to be a lot harder to carry than you would have imagined, mainly because your forearms were already tired from doing so much work. You had to grip that handle and carry it some 300 feet to a reasonable site and that was almost the last straw; you didn't know if you were ever going to recover and be able to use your hands again. It weighed about 350 Earth-pounds. On the Moon it was only 60 pounds; and the problem was gripping that handle of the barbell.
118:51:07|ALSJ||Apollo 13 photo @alsjurl/a13/ap13-KSC-70PC-15.jpg"@alsjt>KSC-70PC-15</a> shows Jim Lovell carrying the ALSEP packages during training. He is carrying it in the arms-down position. The @alsjurl/rtg_empl.gif"@alsjt>RTG</a> pallet is on Lovell's left. Note the locking mechanism with which the pallets are secured to the carrybar and, also, the Universal Handling Tool (UHT) attached to each of the pallets.
118:51:25|ALSJ||Jack is guessing that Gene hit the wrong gravimeter button.
118:51:28|ALSJ||The hammer in Gene's shin pocket has just caught under the right rear fender, ripping off the rearward extension. Gene remembers that, although the suit reduced his tactile sensitivity a great deal, he did feel the hammer catch but was unable to stop himself before the damage had been done. During Apollo 16, at Station 8 near the end of the second EVA, Charlie Duke and John Young were at the back of the Rover, near the right-rear fender, changing each other's sample bags. Houston was looking at them with the TV. John had the hammer in his shin pocket and, as soon as Charlie finished changing his bag, started around the back of the Rover to go to his seat. John's right leg - and, most likely, the hammer - caught on the fender and ripped it off. In his 1990 book, Moonwalker, Charlie inexplicably says that it was he who knocked the fender off but also adds that "it had happened so many times in training that we didn't think anything of it." A plausible explanation for this statement is that Charlie was remembering a training incident. Like the 17 crew, they soon realized that the loss of the fender would force them to spend far more time dusting and doing other housekeeping chores than they would have liked. Among other things, after the EVA they were both covered with dust and, despite efforts to clean themselves, took a great deal into the cabin. There, they had to wrap their suit legs in bags in an effort to keep the dust from fouling closures and, of course, in the process of getting out of the suits, they got their hands very dirty and, because they had no way to really clean themselves up, got dust on everything they touched.
118:51:28|ALSJ||Ron Creel has provided a summary ( @alsjurl/LRV_Fender_Extensions.pdf"@alsjt>1.3 Mb PDF</a> ) of the fender extension losses that occurred on all three Rover missions.
118:51:50|ALSJ||Jack is walking at a rapid pace, albeit far more flat-footed than he had been walking unburdened. He is kicking up more dust and his bouncing stride has gone for the moment.
118:51:50|ALSJ|LMP|Recently, a lot of us have been trying to figure out why it is that, when you stir up the surface near the LM, it seems darker while, away from the LM, you don't see that. And my conclusion at this point is that the winnowing effect of the descent engine effluent increases the frequency of small rock fragments compared with dust in the area around the LM, and that, in turn, results in a higher than normal albedo. Rock fragments give you a higher albedo than the dust does. And so, when you walk over it and stir it up, you bring up the normal regolith on top of this winnowed material. And as you move farther and farther away from the effects of the descent engine, you see less and less of that happening. The samples taken near the LM and underneath the LM never showed any chemical contamination or any other reason for that lighter-colored albedo. Yet the visual effect was so marked that you could see a landing site from orbit. We could see ours after we were back in orbit, and we could see Apollo 15 when we flew over it later in the mission.
118:51:50|ALSJ||The light color of the soil around the LM is visible in photographs taken from Station 6, on the lower slopes of the North Massif, about 70 meters above the LM and 3 kilometers distant. The best of these is AS17-139- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21203"@alsjt>21203</a>. An example of the darker color of disturbed soil near the LM is AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20462"@alsjt>20462</a>, a down-Sun picture taken at the end of EVA-3 - which also shows the SEP pallet leaning on the north LM strut. A typical photo showing the lack of color change of disturbed soil well away from the LM is AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20500"@alsjt>20500</a>, which was taken down-Sun at the ALSEP site, also at the end of EVA-3.
118:51:50|ALSJ||The darkening of disturbed soil can be seen in the TV picture just below center.
118:52:05|ALSJ||<a name="1185206">After losing Jack</a> for a moment, Fendell finds him moving down-Sun.
118:52:13|ALSJ||During this exchange, Jack stops to rest, but moves again in eight seconds. He then walks about 20 steps before putting the ALSEP down. He turns to look back toward the LM.
118:52:13|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Jim Scotti notes that, when Jack turns toward the LM the second time, he raises his thumb in front of his face, probably comparing it with the apparent size of the LM. See the discussion after @alsjurl/a17/#1185028"@alsjt>118:50:28</a>, above.
118:52:28|ALSJ||This is a roll of very ordinary, gray duct tape.
118:52:39|ALSJ||Gene is referring to the second line at the top of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-14</a>.
118:52:45|ALSJ||Jack lifts the ALSEP, palms down, to knee height. Carrying the ALSEP is the hardest work Jack will do during the mission. His @alsjurl/a17/a17.mr11_2b.gif"@alsjt>heart rate</a> will peak at about 140 beats per minute. Note that the times indicated on the horizontal axis of the graph are 2 hours 40 minutes earlier than those used in the Journal, which are relative to the planned time of launch rather than the actual time of launch.
118:53:08|ALSJ||Because he has to go around small craters, Jack is not walking a straight line out to the ALSEP site. He starts down into a shallow - or goes over a slight ridge - and we lose sight of his feet.
118:53:08|ALSJ|LMP|This 'mottled' appearance was probably the result of the small, whitish halos that were produced around every one of the micrometeorite impacts. The shattering of the plagioclase made it lighter colored that it had been to begin with.
118:53:08|ALSJ||Jack hoists the ALSEP to chest height, apparently switching to a palms-up or elbow-crook carry in the process. It is impossible to tell from the TV picture which he is using. Jack believes that he did go to an elbow carry.
118:54:43|ALSJ||This is Geophone Rock, the one they described from inside the LM after landing. Jack has walked into a swale and only his head and shoulders are visible. He stops and looks around, putting the ALSEP down.
118:54:43|ALSJ|LMP|Walking down-Sun, the swale wasn't obvious until you got there. Looking up-Sun from the other side, it probably was fairly obvious from the photometric shading that occurs when the sunlight strikes at a glancing angle.
118:54:43|ALSJ|CDR|I don't remember noticing the swale during the descent. And if I did, it wouldn't have bothered me. All it would have done was pitch us forward a little bit, and what I was really looking for was the holes and boulders.
118:54:43|ALSJ||Photo AS17-137- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20867"@alsjt>20867</a> is part of a panoramic sequence taken at the start of EVA-2 and readers will note that the dark Rover tracks disappear into the swale. An @alsjurl/a17/a17rb22193-99.jpg"@alsjt>anaglyph</a> made by Jim Scotti and Eric Jones from AS17-145-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22193"@alsjt>22193</a> and 22199 shows the swale from the LM cabin after EVA-3.
118:54:43|ALSJ||Gene means that he used tape at various times during training, albeit not to repair a fender. The purpose of the fenders is to keep the wheels from throwing dust forward. Dust is a threat to the Rover itself and to other pieces of equipment because surfaces covered with it tend to get hotter and because dust can get onto camera lenses and into moving parts. Even with the fenders intact, at each stop Gene will have to spend a few minutes dusting critical surfaces such as the battery covers. Without the fender, the dusting chore would take even longer.
118:55:22|ALSJ||Jack disappears from view.
118:56:03|ALSJ||Evidently, Jack has taken a short break; he is beginning to get his breath back. Cuff checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-15</a> is a schematic of the planned ALSEP layout and, as he discusses below, he needs to keep some of the pieces of equipment well away from large rocks and out of craters and depressions. The point at which he makes this major course change from west to northwest can be seen on a @alsjurl/a17/a17.ascent1.jpg"@alsjt>16-mm frame</a> taken from the LM during the ascent. He changes direction when he is about 115 meters from the LM. The Central Station is about 190 meters from the LM.
118:56:10|ALSJ||Fendell pans right and gives the Backroom a brief look at Geophone Rock.
118:56:10|ALSJ|LMP|These were gross-leveling blocks. The idea was that, if your site wasn't quite flat, you could put one under a corner of the ALSEP package and get your initial level. Why we ever had them I'll never know; there were always plenty of rocks you could use. People working in a non-real environment came up with the idea.
118:56:57|ALSJ||The TV camera jiggles as Gene works.
118:57:27|ALSJ||<a name="1185741">Jack</a> reappears. He is the white spot right of center just below the point where the northern slope of @alsjurl/a17/a17.fam-mtn.html"@alsjt>(West) Family Mountain</a> (left of center) meets the apparent horizon. @alsjurl/a17/a17.fam-mtn.html"@alsjt>(Old) Family Mountain</a> is to the right of center.
118:57:41|ALSJ||Jack first remarked on the pinkish coloration of the basalts at 117:21:16.
118:57:41|ALSJ|LMP|The pinkish color could be the result of one of two things. Any exposed rock surface has a thin patina or coating that looks a little like desert varnish. However, desert varnish is caused by chemical precipitation, while this is a thin, semi-continuous splattering of brown glass from the micrometeorite impacts. The patina may have looked pinkish to me at this point. Or, the clinopyroxene in the rock might have been giving it a pinkish cast in the full Sun.
118:57:41|ALSJ||Fendell pans right and finds Gene at the right-rear fender. He is trying to get a piece of tape to stick to the fender.
118:57:41|ALSJ|CDR|Because there was dust on everything, once you got a piece of tape off the roll, the first thing the tape stuck to was dust; and then it didn't stick to anything else.
118:57:41|ALSJ||Gene discards the piece of tape he's been trying to use. He reaches up with his right hand, grabs the roll off the back of the Rover, and tears off another piece.
118:58:14|ALSJ||Gene puts the roll back on the top of the geopallet.
118:58:14|ALSJ|CDR|The suit made using the tape more difficult than it would have been otherwise. You don't have as much dexterity with your hands and fingers to get the tape off the roll and tear it. We used the old trick of folding over a little piece of the end so that that piece wouldn't stick back on the roll; otherwise, you'd never get it off.
118:58:14|ALSJ||<a name="1185836">Gene</a> uses one hand to hold the piece of tape in place and tries to press it down by stroking it with the other hand.
118:58:36|ALSJ||Gene turns to look toward Jack before calling to him.
118:58:55|ALSJ||Most of the experiments have constraints of one kind or another about proximity to rocks and/or craters and also to the Central Station, the RTG, and to each other. For example, the heat flow experiment is designed to measure temperature gradients in the soil down to a depth of about 2.5 meters. Craters and rocks, because they absorb and radiate heat differently than a flat surface, can influence the temperature gradients to depths equivalent to their own dimensions.
118:59:02|ALSJ||Geophone Rock, which hadn't been noticed in the pre-mission photos, is about 70 to 80 meters northeast of the planned landing point.
118:59:02|ALSJ||Fendell pans to Jack, who is resting with the ALSEP on the ground.
118:59:11|ALSJ||The neutron probe is designed to measure the natural flux of neutrons due to the decay of radioactive elements in the soil and due to interactions between the soil and cosmic rays and the solar wind. Because the RTG is powered by a plutonium fuel element, it produces enough neutrons that the neutron flux experiment has to be shielded by placing it either in a depression or behind a rock or, preferably, both.
118:59:31|ALSJ|LMP|Through the years I had deployed versions of the ALSEP enough times that the geometry was pretty well fixed in my mind. I could look at an area and, in my imagination, place where everything was going to be and try to pick a compromise site. Nothing was going to be perfect; there were too many variables. But it's one of those things that you can do fairly easily with enough practice that would also be tough to automate. The main problem with the ALSEP was that it took a lot of time to deploy. Much more than it needed to had we designed it to minimize time initially. It got off to a bad start and never fully recovered. Before my time, Walt Cunningham had told the Bendix people 'Give us something to do on the Moon.' And they did. The other extreme was when Bill Anders saw it and said, 'I want a big red button and when I punch it, it gets deployed.' And we ended up in the middle somewhere, still taking an awful lot of time and effort to deploy it. Not the best use of human time on the Moon. Deciding where to deploy is a good use of people; but the actual deployment should have been far more straight-forward than it was.
119:00:00|ALSJ||<a name="1190003">Jack</a> bends his knees, picks up the ALSEP, and starts carrying it with his arms hanging down.
119:00:03|ALSJ||Jack stops and then turns to look north. His heart rate is at a maximum of 140 beats per minute somewhere in this interval just before he puts the ALSEP package down for the last time.
119:00:20|ALSJ||The gravimeter Jack is referring to here is the Long Period Gravimeter, designed to look for gravity waves. @alsjurl/langseth.html"@alsjt>Marcus (Mark) Langseth</a> is the Principal Investigator on the heat flow experiment. Gene will drill two heat flow holes, one 18 feet east and one 18 feet west of a point 30 feet north of the Central Station.
119:00:53|ALSJ||Jack puts the ALSEP down and looks north.
119:01:04|ALSJ||Jack picks the ALSEP up again.
119:01:58|ALSJ||Jack moves another ten feet south. He is talking distinctly louder to Houston than to Gene, despite being about 200 meters west of Gene and the LM.
119:02:32|ALSJ||Measurements of the apparent size of the LM in photos taken from the ALSEP site indicate that Jack has picked a spot about 185 meters from the spacecraft. He is about 40 meters north of Geophone Rock and, from Rover navigation readouts Gene will report later in the EVA, the ALSEP azimuth from the LM is about 27 degrees north of west. Fendell pans to Gene, who is still taping.
119:02:50|ALSJ||The ALSEP interconnect procedures start in the middle of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-14</a>.
119:02:55|ALSJ||He jiggles the fender. He doesn't have a camera on at the moment and doesn't take a close-up picture of his repair job.
119:03:22|ALSJ||Gene moves around the rear of the Rover toward his seat. At the end of EVA-3, he will remove two fender sections, albeit not the broken section, and bring them back to Earth. They are on display at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.
119:03:32|ALSJ||The TV picture shakes as Gene frees the bottom of his seat so he can raise it, stows the tape in the cloth-enclosed seat pan, and gets a lens brush. His location and activities can be deduced from motions of his shadow on the seat backs.
119:03:32|ALSJ||<a name="1190342">Fendell</a> zooms in on the right-rear fender in an attempt to look at Gene's taping job.
119:03:43|ALSJ||<blockquote>In the shadow of the seat back visible on the fender, we see two quick hand motions as Gene uses the brush.
119:03:53|ALSJ||Tthe TV picture shakes again, probably as Gene put the lens brush back under his seat, lowers the seat, and make sure the Velcro holding it down is secure.
119:04:10|ALSJ||Fendell pulls back on the zoom and gives us a view to the west.
119:04:39|ALSJ||See a @alsjurl/a16/a16.lrvload.html#1201843"@alsjt>discussion of the sunshade</a> at the time when it was first deployed on Apollo 16.
119:04:39|ALSJ||Fendell starts panning counter-clockwise but, after a few seconds, Gene takes hold of the camera and turns it to face aft.
119:04:53|ALSJ||That is, he plans to park the Rover 60 feet northeast of the Central Station.
119:04:53|ALSJ||The audio for some of the next 60 seconds of dialog is missing from the tapes used to generate the audio clips. Comm was being reconfigured from TV and Audio to Audio Only and a different set of recordings is needed to fill the gap.
119:07:05|ALSJ|CDR|We had the low-gain antenna set up with a heading indicator; and we'd done some work with it in training. I knew generally what my heading was going to be, and in this case it was going to be west. So, rather than try and sight the antenna while I was going, in this case I just set the low-gain on the 270 mark. I never had to worry about the elevation because it was just about always the same no matter where we were.
119:07:05|ALSJ||The low-gain antenna is mounted on a two-piece staff, with the upper section seated in a sleeve in the lower section. The antenna, itself, has to be pointed to within about 30 degrees of Earth and that means that, as Gene turns the Rover, he has to re-point the low gain. The low-gain staff is mounted on his T-handle, just forward of the Rover control handle and more or less in his line of sight with the instrument console. There is a short handle attached to the upper section of the staff which Gene can use for pointing. On the upper staff-section there is also a fixed arrow and, mounted on the lower section, a heading indicator in the form of an aluminum collar attached with a set-screw. The numbers on the collar increase in the counter-clockwise direction, the reverse of the heading card on the Rover instrument panel. Because Earth remains fixed in the local sky, the collar could be positioned prior to launch from Earth at an orientation such that, as he turns to a new Rover heading, Gene needs only turn the antenna so that the arrow points to that new heading.
119:07:07|ALSJ||Don McMillan has provided an animation ( @alsjurl/VLRV-covers.mov"@alsjt>0.8 Mb</a> ) of the battery covers on his Virtual Rover being opened.
119:07:34|ALSJ||Because it is early morning at Taurus-Littrow, the down-Sun direction is just a little north of west.
119:08:34|ALSJ||Gene got off the Rover to get the block Jack dropped earlier and, then, as he got back on, probably kicked dirt on the battery covers.
119:09:16|ALSJ||After arriving at the ALSEP deployment site, Jack performed the ALSEP interconnect tasks listed on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-14</a>, then off-loaded the Heat Flow Electronics (HFE) package because Gene was delayed at the LM by the fender accident, and has just read the shorting-plug meter as per the fourth line on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-16</a>. The meter is on the end of the cable that Jack is about to attach to the Central Station.
119:09:16|ALSJ|LMP|Because the RTG was producing power when we hadn't yet hooked up any of the equipment, they had what was called a shorting plug that basically allowed current to flow out of the RTG and then back into itself. And, obviously, some resistance had been put somewhere in the circuit it made so that the power source wouldn't burn itself out.
119:09:37|ALSJ||Houston wants him to face the Rover into the Sun so that, by opening the battery covers he will put the battery radiators in shadow, and let them cool. By parking north of the Central Station, Houston would still have good TV coverage of the ALSEP deployment, despite the new Rover orientation. As it turns out, as per @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-15</a> Gene will park 60 feet northeast of the Central Station but with the vehicle facing east. The TV coverage is still pretty good.
119:09:37|ALSJ|CDR|As I remember, if I was at the front of the Rover facing the back, the battery covers would open toward me. So if you parked the Rover facing east, the covers would shadow the batteries from the Sun and let them cool.
119:09:57|ALSJ||Compared with the landing site, the ALSEP area has many more large rocks and a bit more relief.
119:10:04|ALSJ||Jack has just plugged the RTG cable into the Central Station.
119:10:22|ALSJ||Jack is referring to a small, local depression rather than the swale. See @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-15</a> for the planned ALSEP layout.
119:10:52|ALSJ||Obviously, Jack had been busy with his own work during the parking discussion and hadn't consciously heard what Bob said.
119:11:01|ALSJ||While he is busy parking the Rover, Gene isn't adjusting the low-gain antenna, so communications with Earth are momentarily bad.
119:12:02|ALSJ||The TCU is the Television Control Unit, the assembly which controls camera operations. A good image of it is AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20476"@alsjt>20476</a>, a picture of Gene and the Rover that Jack took late in the third EVA. The TCU is the box at the top of the mounting post and below the camera itself.
119:13:02|ALSJ||<a name="1191305">TV on.</a> With the TV still pointing aft, our initial view is west over the console. @alsjurl/Fendell-Bio.pdf"@alsjt>Fendell</a> starts panning counter-clockwise. <a href="a17.fam-mtn.html"@alsjt>(West) Family Mountain</a> can be seen over the LMP seat. We can see the traverse maps on the accessory staff and, on the back of the Rover, the scoop and rake.
119:13:05|ALSJ||The batteries are permanently attached to the forward chassis section. In order to dust the covers from the front of the Rover, Gene would have to lean over the LCRU whereas, from the side, he has a shorter distance to lean over the wheels and, when he can be seen dusting the covers, he is always to the side.
119:13:05|ALSJ||<a name="1191405">Fendell</a> pans past Jack, who is working on the ALSEP pallet that contains the Central Station and most of the experiment modules. The South Massif is in the background. Jack has tipped the Central Station on its side so he can connect cables from the two modules that were stowed on the @alsjurl/rtg_empl.gif"@alsjt>RTG</a> pallet. All of the other experiment modules were stowed on the Central Station pallet and already have electrical connections to the Central Station. The RTG is the dark object on the left side of the picture.
119:14:05|ALSJ||The Lunar Ejecta and Meteorites Experiment is designed to measure the size, speed, and direction of flight of very small impactors. The experimenters expect to see about one impact per day. The LEAM and the Heat Flow experiment are the two modules that were stowed on the @alsjurl/rtg_empl.gif"@alsjt>RTG</a> pallet. At the moment, Jack is making the LEAM electrical connection. He is on page <a href="a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-16</a>.
119:14:13|ALSJ|LMP|We established one place in the deployment site where you'd put all the discards, all the things that were designed to isolate vibrations, to assist in packing: shims, dust covers, and other things that people felt were necessary to protect the equipment. The idea of having a garbage pile was partly to keep the site neat, but also to keep things from being under foot. I'm throwing things toward the pile and often not hitting it, usually throwing things too far.
119:14:39|ALSJ||Jack has connected the heat flow electronics package to the Central Station and has put it on the ground about ten feet to the west. Normally, Gene would have detached the HFE from the RTG pallet and made the electrical connection to the Central Station, but he is running a little behind the timeline because of the fender. The mission planners anticipated the possibility - if not the cause - that Gene might arrive late and included the heat flow off-load and connect as an optional task in Jack's checklist, page @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-15</a>.
119:14:45|ALSJ|LMP|This statement seems to imply that during training it was hard to get the pins lined up. But, apparently, perseverance succeeded.
119:15:08|ALSJ||<a name="1191505">Fendell</a> is looking northeast into the Wessex Cleft, which separates the North Massif on the west from the Sculptured Hills on the right.
119:15:09|ALSJ||Jack's next task, at the bottom of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-16</a>, is to do a rough alignment of the Central Station.
119:15:46|ALSJ||<a name="1191546">Fendell</a> is looking at a meter-sized boulder which is about 15 meters north of the TV camera. The lower slopes of the North Massif form the backdrop. Later in the ALSEP deployment, Gene will drill the deep core hole on the other side of the boulder.
119:15:46|ALSJ||Fendell completes his counter-clockwise pan and reverses direction.
119:15:46|ALSJ||Gene has been working hard dusting. Fendell points the TV in his direction just in time to show him reaching back for the @alsjurl/alsj-ValveCluster.html"@alsjt>cooling control on the bottom right of his PLSS</a>.
119:16:27|ALSJ|CDR|It felt like a shot of ice water.
119:16:33|ALSJ||The @alsjurl/alsj-ValveCluster.html"@alsjt>cooling control is a round knob with a thumb flange sticking out on one side</a>.
119:16:59|ALSJ||Gene has just finished his last task on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-15</a>. Page @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-16</a> is a schematic of the ALSEP layout, identical to @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-15</a>. Gene's next task, on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-17</a>, is to deploy the Heat Flow package 30 feet north of the Central Station.
119:17:04|ALSJ||As mentioned previously, Jack has already disconnected the heat flow package and placed it 10 feet northwest of the Central Station. Gene reaches the Central Station and gets one of the two Universal Handling Tools (@alsjurl/tools/judy35.gif"@alsjt>UHTs</a>). Jack is using the handle of the other UHT to try to get the Central Station roughly leveled. Each of the UHTs is a meter-long tool with a handle jutting out at ninety degrees from the top and a pull trigger which retracts pin fasteners at the tip.
119:17:26|ALSJ||Gene picks up the HFE and carries it off-camera, 30 feet north, to the place where he will drill the two heat flow holes. <a name ="1191726">Jack</a> continues his attempts to level the Central Station.
119:17:59|ALSJ|LMP|In those days, they were saying that the missions each cost a half billion dollars, half for the hardware, half for operations. If you spread that over the two of us being out on the surface for twenty-two hours, it comes out to about $200,000 per EVA minute.
119:18:04|ALSJ||Jack flicks away a small object with the UHT.
119:18:27|ALSJ|LMP|We had originally had things called Calfax fasteners holding the equipment together, but they were far too complicated. I made a stink about that early on, way back in the mid-sixties. So they invented or found another way to do it and replaced all the Calfax fasteners with these @alsjurl/alsj-BoydBolts.html"@alsjt>Boyd bolts</a>. The Calfax you had to turn several times; and these you only had to push in with the UHT and then turn a three-quarter turn and it would pop loose.
119:18:27|ALSJ|LMP|The change from Calfax fasteners to Boyd bolts occurred well before the first ALSEP. We changed that at Bendix as soon as I got involved. As I've already mentioned, Walt Cunningham, on a visit to Bendix early in the history of the ALSEP program - not knowing that there was going to be lots of things to see and do and describe and photograph - told them to give us something to do. So Bendix put as many fasteners on this thing as they could. But when Bill Anders and I showed up there - probably in '67, maybe late '66 - we saw this monster that they had constructed with over fifty of these Calfax fasteners. I think it took two-and-a-half turns on each of them to get them loose. So we yelled and screamed. Well, not 'yelled and screamed'; but we suggested to them that they try to find a better fastener and reduce the number as much as they possibly could. To be fair to Bendix, the contractors sometimes had a hell of a time responding to astronaut inputs. They felt like they ought to respond and so they had responded; and then the guy who made the input disappears - Cunningham was off working on Apollo 7 by this time and was out of the picture - and a couple of more come on who have different ideas.
119:18:27|ALSJ|LMP|On my first visit to Bendix in Ann Arbor with Bill Anders - we flew up there in a little T-33 - I think we went through a shirtsleeve deployment of the mock-up that they had at the time. And that's when we just about raised the roof on how long it was going to take and how much was required physically. We really forced them into a whole re-design on the packaging and deployment. The issue of the fasteners is the one that sticks in my mind because they were so egregious, but I'm sure there were lots of other change orders written. I spent a lot of time trying to work with Bendix because I didn't want to use up any more time deploying the ALSEP than was absolutely necessary. There were so many other things that I wanted to do, and wanted the rest of the guys to do - mostly collecting samples - that I wanted to minimize the amount of time we spend on the deployment. Deploying the ALSEP is exactly the kind of thing that robots generally ought to be used for, except for certain things like getting seismometers deployed and leveled. Things like that are tough to do automatically and is probably cost effective to have a man do it. But a lot of this other stuff could have been done robotically, even in those days. It's just that the program didn't try to do it that way.
119:18:44|ALSJ||Jack is unfastening bolts that hold the Long-Period Surface Gravimeter onto the ALSEP package. He inserts his UHT in the top of the LSG and lifts it free. This is the gravity-wave experiment. He is at the top of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-17</a>.
119:19:02|ALSJ||Jack has been working east of the Central Station. He starts moving sideways to the north, watching the LSG ribbon cable come loose. In the process, he catches a foot on the LEAM cable going off to the southeast. He hops free.
119:19:09|ALSJ||Jack carries the Lunar Surface Gravimeter west and a little north from the Central Station.
119:19:21|ALSJ||<a name="1191933">Jack</a> gets to the end of the LSG cable, turns to face the Central Station, and then backs away to and put the cable in tension before removing and discarding a thermal/dust cover. He tosses the cover a meter or so behind him.
119:19:33|ALSJ||<a name="1191955">Gene</a> comes into view as he backs away from the Heat Flow Experiments (HFE) box toward the Rover. He is paying out cable for the probe he will emplace east of the HFE.
119:19:55|ALSJ|LMP|As I recall, in order to train with the drill, you wanted to drill in a lunar soil simulant. So we had a big can or drum or bin filled with the stuff - dry and tamped down - and when we got to this point, Gene would go over and drill his hole in the can of simulant.
119:20:16|ALSJ||NASA photo @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#S7237253"@alsjt>S72-37253</a> shows the LSG in its deployed configuration in a lab photo. Note the rectangular feet which, on a firm surface, would keep the instrument off the ground.
119:20:16|ALSJ||<a name="1192016">Gene</a> drops the first heat flow probe to the ground 16 feet east of the HFE, and then goes back to the HFE and picks up the other probe.
119:21:06|ALSJ||Again, it is a little puzzling that Houston does not pass along the fact that Evans' observation puts them just north of Poppie.
119:21:17|ALSJ||Gene moves west with the second heat flow probe.
119:21:22|ALSJ||Jack hasn't moved much through all of this. He is unfolding the LSG's @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#S7237253"@alsjt>diamond-shaped sunshade</a> before setting the instrument on the ground.
119:21:31|ALSJ||<a name="1192131">Gene</a> drops the second probe.
119:21:37|ALSJ||In @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#S7237253"@alsjt>S72-37253</a>, the level bubble is on the top of the instrument at the corner closest to the right edge of the photograph. When the instrument is deployed, the sunshade will be facing south. The gnomon gauge is to the left of the level bubble on what will be the north edge of the instrument.
119:21:37|ALSJ||<a name="1192137">Gene</a> has returned to the HFE and reaches for his UHT, which is attached to the yo-yo on his left hip.
119:22:12|ALSJ|LMP|There was a level bubble and a little gnomon, and I would have seen movement too small to see in the TV picture.
119:22:24|ALSJ||Jack can see the gimbal through the opening in the top of the @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#S7237253"@alsjt>instrument</a>.
119:22:24|ALSJ||Had the LSG actually detected gravity waves, the achievement might well have resulted in a Nobel Prize in physics. As it turned out, a design error - which Jack discusses in more detail below - prevented the balance beam at the heart of the experiment from completely uncaging.
119:22:24|ALSJ|LMP|As I remember, it did partially uncage and, eventually, they learned how to use the instrument as a seismometer.
119:22:24|ALSJ||Gene has returned to the HFE. He looks at checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-17</a>, gets his UHT, and starts releasing bolts.
119:22:35|ALSJ||Jack @alsjurl/alsj-ValveCluster.html"@alsjt>changes his cooling</a>.
119:22:37|ALSJ||The more cooling that either Jack or Gene use, the sooner they will run out of cooling water and have to terminate the EVA. Hence the reminder. Based on the experience of prior missions, relative high usage is expected during the ALSEP deployment; only prolonged operation at maximum cooling is a real concern.
119:22:40|ALSJ||Jack heads toward the Central Station. Fendell follows him.
119:22:40|ALSJ|LMP|Because we were at 23 north latitude, and because the Sun was already up maybe 8 to 10 degrees, it wasn't exactly east of us. There was probably a mark on the device that took that into account and showed me how to place the gnomon shadow so that the whole experiment would be properly aligned relative to east-west.
119:22:55|ALSJ||At the Central Station, Jack turns to look at Gene.
119:23:03|ALSJ|LMP|Generally, you didn't want the cables taut but, rather, with a bit slack so that they could drape over craters. But you also didn't want them to drape over rocks.
119:23:03|ALSJ||Jack turns away.
119:23:10|ALSJ||Jack reaches very low and uses the UHT to re-position the cable connecting the RTG to the Central Station. He then goes to the Central Station and moves the cable at that end. He then returns to the RTG and uses the handle of the UHT to drag the RTG a couple of feet toward the Rover and, finally, to turn it clockwise by perhaps 45 degrees. When he finishes, he turns to look at Gene again.
119:24:19|ALSJ||In response to Gene's manipulations of the HFE, its cable comes off the ground at the Central Station. Jack is now at the Central Station and has started to free the @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#S7237259"@alsjt>geophone module</a> as per @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-17</a>.
119:24:45|ALSJ||<a name="1192445">Jack</a> reaches down with his UHT, apparently to re-position the heat flow cable.
119:24:49|ALSJ||Jack uses the UHT to turn more of the @alsjurl/alsj-BoydBolts.html"@alsjt>Boyd bolts</a> with which the geophone module is attached to the pallet. He will deploy the module 30 feet south of the Central Station and then will emplace the four geophones at the following locations. No. 1 will go 150 feet east of the module; No. 2, 150 feet west; No. 3, 88 feet south and not quite as far as Geophone Rock; and No. 4, 260 feet south, well beyond Geophone Rock. He is in the middle of <a href="a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-17</a>.
119:25:02|ALSJ||<a name="1192502">Jack</a> reached down to pull the geophone module off by hand but managed, instead, to release the thermal cover. Hence his "Whoops!". The cover is the large white object at the right in @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#S7237259"@alsjt>S72-37259</a>. In this pre-flight lab photo, the five small compartments on the top of the dust cover contain marker flags, one of which has been removed and placed on the table top to the right of the dust cover.
119:25:34|ALSJ||In Houston, those who have been following what Jack has been doing in detail tell Flight Director Gerry Griffin that Jack has prematurely released the dust cover but that there will be no adverse effects.
119:25:36|ALSJ||Jack does a high, two-footed kangaroo hop over a cable and heads south. Note the reel at the center of the trailing cable.
119:26:27|ALSJ||<a name = "1192631">Jack</a> stops and, one at a time, takes five @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#S7237259"@alsjt>orange-colored, geophone flags</a> out of the storage compartment on the top of the dust cover and sticks them in the ground. The flags will be used to make the geophone locations visible in the photographs and also to help Gene to keep from running over the geophones with the Rover. In addition, as Jack emplaces the four geophones at the ends of long N-S and E-W lines centered on the geophone module, he can sight across the central module to a flag at the opposite end of an arm and keep his lines straight.
119:26:27|ALSJ||Gene is now at the bottom on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-17</a> and, next, will assemble the @alsjurl/a17/drill_21.gif"@alsjt>drill</a> he will use to sink two holes for the heat flow probes.
119:26:38|ALSJ||Again, there is some concern that movement of the TV camera might upset the @alsjurl/a17/a17-TGE.html"@alsjt>TGE</a>. The successful completion of this measurement indicates that there will be no problem.
119:26:48|ALSJ||If there has been any cooling, it has only been a fraction of a degree. By the end of the ALSEP deployment at 121:35:00, the temperatures will be down to 96 and 110 degrees.
119:26:53|ALSJ|LMP|I don't recall that we had developed any contingency plans for walking traverses. I think the idea was that, if it ever came to that, you'd develop plans in real-time, depending on what you'd gotten done before the Rover failed. With all the redundancy built into the Rover, and with two successful Rover missions completed, they figured that it wasn't much of a risk. If we'd had to, I think we could have probably gotten to our main objectives almost as fast loping as we could driving. You could move pretty fast, and it wasn't an effort, that I recall. I don't think they would have let us go all the way to Station 2, but I think we could have made it up the Scarp. It would have been tough climbing, but we probably could have done it climbing sidehill, zig-zagging up. The main problem was the lack of flexibility in the hip. It wasn't hard to stretch your leg, but lifting your thigh was difficult.
119:26:53|ALSJ||Jack puts the geophone module down and removes the UHT.
119:26:53|ALSJ||Off-camera, Gene has probably picked up the @alsjurl/drill_21.gif"@alsjt>drill assembly</a> and is consulting a decal to make sure he does the assembly correctly.
119:27:02|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Jim Scotti notes that the "machine" is almost certainly the Rover. Although Gene is working with the drilling equipment, he probably hasn't left the Rover.
119:27:12|ALSJ||Jack uses the UHT to lift off the geophone dust cover.
119:27:23|ALSJ||Jack tosses the dust cover toward the trash pile.
119:27:32|ALSJ||Fendell pans to follow the heat shield; only catches the shadow of it landing.
119:27:35|ALSJ||This may have a private joke between Bob and Jack.
119:27:40|ALSJ|LMP|The Support Crew had all sorts of clever little sayings and pictures and stuff like that that they would put into the checklist. Bob's favorite, since our motto was 'the end of the beginning', was 'this is the end, not the beginning'. And he had some little pink patches he called "Rover patches" as distinct from the flight patches; and there may have been something like that in the checklist at this point. Some of it you couldn't repeat over the airway. Or maybe this was just another part of the private joke.
119:27:40|ALSJ||Jack does not turn a checklist page here, so it must be another part of the joke.
119:27:40|ALSJ||<a name="1192755">Leaning</a> to his right, Jack pushes one of the five flags into the ground next to the module. This will hold the cables connecting the four individual geophones to the module so that, as he deploys the geophones, tension in the cables won't move the module.
119:28:14|ALSJ||Gene is pulling out the three legs of a stand on which he will rest the drill stems and hang his wrench. He is at the top of CDR-18. Jack, who is still in the TV picture, has run back to the Central Station and is now releasing the Lunar Mass Spectrometer. This task is at the top of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-18</a>. The LMS will measure the density and composition of the very tenuous lunar atmosphere. Because the LM releases enough gases during depressurization and during launch to overwhelm the instrument, like many others of the ALSEP gear, except for a brief checkout after installation, the LMS will be shut down until after lift-off.
119:28:43|ALSJ|LMP|The legs on Gene's drill-stem rack were packed unextended and when you extended them, they popped out with a spring. In training, they may have actually fallen off.
119:28:43|ALSJ||Bob agrees with Jack's recollection.
119:28:43|ALSJ||Jack frees the LMS and the Central Station jumps a little.
119:28:55|ALSJ||Jack carries the LMS eastward.
119:28:55|ALSJ||Fendell pans to Gene who is carrying a wrapped bundle of drill stems, a stem rack, and the drill. He positions the rack southwest of his mark. He is at the top of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-18</a>
119:29:48|ALSJ||Jack is stumped by the fourth line on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-18</a>.
119:29:48|ALSJ||Gene is holding the drill by a loop handle which allows him to set it on the ground, handgrips down, without bending over very far.
119:30:07|ALSJ|LMP|I was probably supposed to put the UHT in a socket and rotate it; the instrument was probably locked unless you put the UHT in and rotate it. Obviously, I had forgotten to do that in training and had forgotten again on the Moon.
119:30:19|ALSJ||Gene removes and discards the top of the quiver-like drill stem bag; and then leans the bag on the rack.
119:30:47|ALSJ||<a name="1193047">Gene</a> removes the initial, 137-cm drill stem from the quiver. The second and third stems are each 71-cm long. The total hole depth will be 2.5 meters.
119:30:49|ALSJ|LMP|We had done the deployment often enough in training that I had a feel for how far away he was supposed to be.
119:30:49|ALSJ||In the deployment plan on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-16</a>, Gene was to have put the heat flow package due north of the Central Station and the holes due east and west from the package. However, as indicated in the as-built ALSEP map, which is Figure @alsjurl/a17/a17psrf6-98comb.jpg"@alsjt>6-98</a> in the Apollo 17 @alsjurl/a17/a17psr.html"@alsjt>Preliminary Science Report</a>, the HFE was a bit east of due north, and the eastern hole a bit south, bringing him much closer to the LMS than usual. Without bending over, Gene fits the stem into the drill chuck and then twists it with his fingers to try to get it threaded in properly.
119:31:13|ALSJ||The stem comes loose from the chuck.
119:31:23|ALSJ||Gene will drill two heat flow holes and one for a deep core.
119:31:28|ALSJ||Gene has the stem partially threaded; however, as he lifts the drill by the stem, it falls off. The threads make a complete circle of the stem in about a half inch of rise and, in a shirtsleeve environment, the stem sections are very easy to join.
119:31:41|ALSJ||The stem finally seats properly.
119:32:00|ALSJ||The Lunar Mass Spectrometer is also known as the Lunar Atmosphere Composition Experiment (@alsjurl/WayneMorsfield.html"@alsjt>LACE</a>). In operation, any gas molecules entering the device will be bombarded and ionized by electrons given off by an internal source. Ions of different species are then separated magnetically and counted. During deployment, the entrance port is covered by a nylon dust screen which will be pulled back - by radio command - only after the crew has left the Moon and the seismic charges have been detonated.
119:32:00|ALSJ|LMP|This was probably a safety seal that held down the cover on the port. I had to remove it so that, when they later sent the Open signal, the screen would come off. You'll notice that I've moved well away from the LMS by this point. Often we did that - wait to brief them on something that had already happened - because it wasn't convenient to break in.
119:32:33|ALSJ||Jack is doing the last task on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-18</a>, which is "Housekeep C/S", where "C/S" is "Central Station".
119:32:33|ALSJ||Gene uses the drill stem to straighten the cable. He then plants the drill, and then removes and discards a thermal cover.
119:32:34|ALSJ|LMP|I may have been in a deeper depression than I had expected, although the pictures certainly don't show anything dramatic.
119:32:49|ALSJ||Gene leans forward and starts to drill. The stem is sufficiently angled that people in Houston are concerned about loads Gene may be putting on it.
119:33:53|ALSJ|CDR|Because of the weight of the PLSS, you had a tendency to lean forward and put a little torque or bending motion on the drill stem. The worry was having it bind up as a result.
119:33:53|ALSJ|LMP|There may also have been some consideration of optimizing power usage. The motor would have been more efficient at medium power levels than at higher power levels.
119:33:54|ALSJ||Gene stops drilling to give his hands a short rest. In order to grip the drill handle - which also serves as the on/off switch - Gene is having to squeeze his fingers closed against the pressure of the suit and that is very tiring. The top of the stem is at about knee height. He starts drilling again. Meanwhile, now that he has removed all of the experiment modules, Jack has begun to do a final leveling and alignment of the Central Station. This will prove to be a time-consuming task. He is at the bottom of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-18</a>.
119:33:54|ALSJ||The vibration of the drill produces a good deal of suit vibration and, thereby, a noise audible to listeners on Earth. Gene is wearing a Snoopy helmet which covers his ears and deadens any sounds except those coming through his earpiece.
119:33:54|ALSJ|CDR|Thinking about when I said 'it sounds like she's chipping away', you have to remember that sound and feel are very closely related, just like in the lift-off of the Saturn V. Do you "hear" the noise or do you "feel" the noise? In this particular case the "noise" or the vibration traveled from my hands up into my suit. So was I hearing it or was I feeling it. Probably feeling it; but sound and feel are very closely related when you're in an environment like that.
119:35:25|ALSJ||Gene stops for a moment, releasing his grip, then drills a final few inches before going to the rack for the wrench. Jack is in the background, still trying to level the Central Station.
119:35:25|ALSJ|LMP|In drilling those holes, it was nice that fifty percent of the regolith is particles smaller than 100 microns. The chances of hitting a large rock were pretty small, in spite of what you see scattered around on the surface. Because you're looking across the surface at a very low angle, you get a distorted view of how many rocks there are.
119:35:45|ALSJ||The process of getting the equipment level is a matter of finding a level position on the uneven ground, rather than smoothing and leveling the surface itself. The soil can be pushed out of the way or piled up with a boot, although care must be taken not to get any dust on thermally-sensitive surfaces. Here, Jack is leveling the base of the Central Station, prior to raising the top and the attached thermal curtains. Meanwhile, Gene leans over the stem rack to get the wrench but gets his center-of-mass too far forward and stumbles. Once he has the wrench in hand, he goes to the drill, put his right hand on the drill for balance, puts his left leg back and does a deep knee bend without quite touching his left knee to the ground. He attaches the wrench to the stem with his left hand and rises without difficulty. He rises and uses his left foot to brace the wrench while he turns the drill counter-clockwise to release it.
119:36:39|ALSJ||Gene takes the drill by the loop handle and sets it on the ground.
119:37:08|ALSJ|LMP|By leveling the Central Station and getting it aligned relative to the Sun, I could then use pre-determined coordinates for pointing the antenna.
119:37:08|ALSJ||The pre-determined antenna settings are printed on cuff checklist page LMP-20. Meanwhile, Gene does another deep knee bend, with his right hand on the detached drill to try to remove the wrench. However, the drill is to far away from the wrench and he doesn't get any support. He starts to lose his balance and has to scramble in the driection of the fall to regain is feet. In the process of recovering from the fall, he lifts the drill off the ground. He puts the drill down out of the way and then tries a dynamic grab. As he gets down, he misses to wrench but is able to stay down long enough the grab it on his second try and then rises and lurches forward to regain his feet.
119:37:14|ALSJ|CDR|We knew they were watching a lot of things on the television, so when we made a statement, we didn't necessarily make a complete statement because we knew they're looking at what we're talking about. In this case, I was talking about the difficulty of getting the wrench off.
119:37:14|ALSJ||John Young had practised doing dynamic grabs in the 1/6th-g airplane before Apollo 16 and got quite good at it. Gene hasn't yet learned to do it efficiently.
119:37:14|ALSJ||Gene gets a 71-cm drill stem out of the quiver. As indicated on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-18</a> the string of drill stems will include the long stem he just emplaced and, now, two 71-cm stems.
119:38:02|ALSJ||Gene threads the second stem into the one in the ground. Behind him, Jack tries to free the bubble by jerking the Central Station to one side or the other every few seconds.
119:38:10|ALSJ||Gene picks up the drill and hits it with his hand to knock some dust off.
119:38:35|ALSJ||Gene attaches the drill and looks at the pressure gauge on his wrist.
119:39:02|ALSJ||Gene uses his hand to shade the gauges on the top of his @alsjurl/alsj-RCU.html"@alsjt>RCU</a>.
119:39:16|ALSJ||Gene starts drilling and the vibration knocks a lot of dust off the drill. Gene is breathing heavily and, according to the plotted @alsjurl/a17/a17.mr11_2a.gif"@alsjt>record of his heart rate</a> (about 117:00 on the graph), he is at 130 beats, per minute, climbing toward a peak of 145 beats per minute, which he will reach in about 15 minutes, about the time he finishes emplacing the first heat flow probe and starts the second hole.
119:39:24|ALSJ||That is, a gnomon shadow is falling on a mark etched or painted on the top.
119:39:35|ALSJ||The drill sharply twists Gene's hands by a couple of inches.
119:39:53|ALSJ||Gene stops and looks down to see how far he's gone into the ground.
119:39:53|ALSJ||Ideally, he would have left about 15 cm of stem sticking out of the ground, but he has left himself only 10 cm. He gets the wrench from the rack and looks over at Jack.
119:40:23|ALSJ||Gene holds onto the drill for leverage as he bends his knees to attach the wrench.
119:41:27|ALSJ||Gene twists the drill off the stem and puts it on the ground next to the stem. Now he leans forward on the drill, puts his right hand on the drill, moves his feet back a little, bends his knees slightly and, with much of his weight on the drill, removes the wrench without difficulty. Gene then steps forward and rises easily.
119:41:47|ALSJ||Jack is still trying to fine tune the Central Station alignment and leveling.
119:42:06|ALSJ||Gene stands motionless next to the drill rack, his arms out in front of him in the rest position, knees slightly bent.
119:42:29|ALSJ||Crossed cables might interfere with each other electrically.
119:43:06|ALSJ||Jack is referring to his prowess in leveling the Central Station and, perhaps, to Gene's prowess with the drill, as well. Journal Contributor Tom Gebbie notes that Jack is quoting a famous phrase from the James Michener novel "The Bridges at Toko Ri". Gene starts drilling again.
119:43:13|ALSJ||The following discussion of the expression "in like Flynn" in adapted from the alt.usage.english FAQ by Mark Israel : This phrase's first meaning was "in favor; assured of success; in an enviable position". Some writers allege that it originated in allusion to Edward Joseph "Boss" Flynn (1892-1953), a campaign manager for the U.S. Democratic party (in the Bronx, New York) during Franklin Delano Roosevelt's presidency. Flynn's machine was so successful at winning elections that his candidates (and he, himself) seemed to be "in" office automatically. But the phrase was popularized (by U.S. Army Aircorps pilots during World War II) with reference to Australian-born Hollywood actor Errol Flynn (1909-59), whose amorous exploits (including two highly-publicized charges of statutory rape in 1942) gave it a second meaning: "being a quick seducer". The earliest citation we have seen does refer to Errol Flynn (but not to seduction): "'In like Flynn' (means) 'Everything is O.K.' In other words, the pilot is having no more trouble than Errol Flynn has in his cinematic feats." (1945 in American Speech, Dec. 1946, p. 310)
119:43:13|ALSJ||Other commentators on the Internet suggest that Penn State Professor Ed Miller, the author of the "American Speech" article, may have been given a cleaned-up definition by his post-war students. My thanks to Journal Contributor Brian Lawrence, who suggested this inquiry.
119:43:50|ALSJ|CDR|It was tough drilling. You had to hold the drill to keep it from turning in your hands and you had to put pressure on it. As I remember, it was during the drilling that I got heart rates up to 120 or 130. It was hard work, and that's why I had to rest every once in a while. You can hear how hard a job it was in the sound of my voice.
119:43:56|ALSJ||Gene stops for a minute. He's been leaning over the drill and straightens up to rest. His @alsjurl/a17/a17.mr11_2a.gif"@alsjt>heart rate</a> is over 130 beats per minute. In comparison, Jack's @alsjurl/a17/a17.mr11_2b.gif"@alsjt>heart rate</a> is the 90-110 range throughout the deployment.
119:43:59|ALSJ|CDR|If you hold a drill, the motor turns the drill stem and the bit. But if the bit gets hung up, and you let go of the drill, the motor spins the drill. It was very difficult to keep the drill from rotating; you really had to work at it. Here on Earth, in your back yard or in your garage, you've at least got full Earth gravity holding you down; but on the Moon, even with the weight of the PLSS you weigh a lot less and it's harder to hold onto the drill when it binds.
119:43:59|ALSJ||Gene starts drilling again. Meanwhile, Jack is probably releasing @alsjurl/alsj-BoydBolts.html"@alsjt>Boyd bolts</a> holding down the Central Station antenna as per <a href="a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-19</a>. He will not mount the antenna until after he has raised the top of the Central Station and, with it, the thermal curtain which shades the east, west and south sides.
119:44:28|ALSJ||Gene stops and gets the wrench.
119:44:42|ALSJ||Gene has been standing southwest of the Rover with his back to the camera and the drill in front of him.
119:44:43|ALSJ||Gene turns away from the Sun and, without quite kneeling, attaches the wrench.
119:44:58|ALSJ||Gene tries to turn the drill but it takes quite a bit of force before it suddenly releases.
119:45:10|ALSJ||He leans on the drill to remove the wrench. Here, Gene is using @alsjurl/a17/a17.lrvload.html#1175843"@alsjt>"Manischewitz"</a> instead of cursing.
119:45:40|ALSJ||Gene tamps dirt around the stem with his boot, then hangs the wrench on the rack.
119:46:36|ALSJ||Checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-19</a> contains the phrase "guide C/S up" which suggests that, in training, the Central Station raised itself reluctantly. Here, it sprang up to full height without any hesitation. Photo AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20491"@alsjt>20491</a> shows the raised Central Station from the east. Jack has not yet attached the antenna and gimbals that are shown in the photo, which was taken after the ALSEP deployment was complete. Note the attachment points on the top where the various experiment modules were mounted. The LSG is in the background at the right. AS17-147- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22586"@alsjt>22586</a> shows the Central Station from the north. Notice how the south edge of the bottom seems to be thrust into the soil. This is an indication of the lengths to which Jack had to go to get it leveled. The trash pile is at the left edge of the photo. The geophone module is between the Central Station and Geophone Rock; and Bear Mountain is the dark dome beyond and slightly to the left of Geophone Rock. The South Massif emerges from the center of the southern horizon and rises toward the west.
119:47:08|ALSJ||Gene has picked up the heat flow probe and removes it from its protective bag. The bag has kept the probe clean, despite the amount of dust that he has kicked around while drilling the hole. He is at the middle of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-18</a>.
119:47:19|ALSJ||Fendell starts to pans away from Gene; Experiments tell Flight they'd like to continue watching the heat flow deployment.
119:48:00|ALSJ||Gene goes to the heat flow hole he just drilled.
119:48:00|ALSJ||Jack's next task, on the bottom of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-19</a>, is to secure the thermal curtains that cover the east, west, and south faces. They are secured with patches of Velcro.
119:48:45|ALSJ||Gene has trouble getting the tip of the probe to go into the drill stem. After maneuvering it like a fishing line for a while, he finally does two quick knee bends so that he can push the probe in with his hand.
119:48:45|ALSJ|LMP|The four corners of the thermal curtain were sealed with Velcro, and it never worked very well. Because of the Apollo fire, we had to have Teflon Velcro; and that just isn't very good Velcro.
119:49:21|ALSJ||Gene does a discus throw of a bag or box from which he has just removed a rammer. He almost spins out of control and almost falls.
119:49:47|ALSJ||Gene telescopes the rammer from an 18-inch (0.5 m) length to about four feet (1.3 m).
119:50:48|ALSJ||Jack is concerned that they won't have much time to devote to geology. His next task, on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-20</a>, is to release the Central Station antenna gimbal assembly from the LEAM pallet and then mount it and the antenna on the Central Station. Meanwhile, Gene is having trouble getting the tip of the rammer in the hole. It seems to have a cable slot.
119:51:00|ALSJ||Gene gets the rammer in the stem.
119:51:36|ALSJ||Papa 1 is a mark on the heat flow cable indicating how far the cable has gone into the drill stem. The bottom heat flow drill stem has a closed drill bit so that the stems would remain clear for insertion of the probes. The heat flow probe contains multiple sensors and Gene is emplacing thermal shields between them. He is in the bottom paragraph on CDR-18. Meanwhile, Jack polices the trash pile, moving outlying items onto the main part of the pile, and then returns to the Central Station.
119:52:00|ALSJ|CDR|I remember that, at the end of the day, my fingers and forearms were very tired. You were always moving your fingers against the pressure in the gloves.
119:52:00|ALSJ||Gene removes the rammer from the hole, reattaches it to the cable at a higher position, and pushes it down the hole again. The cable has a number of sensors attached to it.
119:52:31|ALSJ||Here, Gene is telling Houston how far the top drill stem is in the ground. This is the "Measure height of stem" task on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-18</a>. Fendell pans the TV, finds Jack, and zooms in.
119:53:49|ALSJ||The last thermal shield minimizes the amount of heat the cable carries into the hole. It is visible in AS17-134-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20497"@alsjt>20497</a>. Note how Gene has positioned the cable so that it extends south from the hole for a foot or so before turning west toward the electronics package. The heat flow cables have retained some loops and waves from the days of storage in the LM. In the weak lunar gravity field, this "memory" is retained longer than it would on Earth. On Apollo 16, John Young caught a foot under a heat flow cable near the Central Station and tore it loose. Here, Gene wants to cover the cable with some dirt to hold it down.
119:54:09|ALSJ||Fendell returns to Gene as he picks up the stem quiver and, in the process, knocks the wrench off the rack. He retrieves it relatively easily with the rammer.
119:54:23|ALSJ||Gene picks up the rack and moves west and a little north. He is now at the top of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-19</a> and is about to drill the second heat flow hole.
119:54:40|ALSJ|CDR|One thing I ought to mention here, in case I forget it, is that on the first day you never felt any heat soak into your gloves. But I remember that on the third day you could feel the heat soaking in. That's because the Sun was 26 degrees higher than it was on the first day. You couldn't feel it on your body because you had the liquid-cooled garment; but your hands had no liquid cooling on them and, also, your hands were sitting out in the sunshine a lot of the time.
119:54:55|ALSJ||Gene puts the drilling gear down.
119:55:29|ALSJ||After Gene drills and extracts the deep core, he will emplace the neutron flux experiment in the resulting hole. The experiment is designed to measure background levels of neutrons produced by the natural radioactivity of the soil and by cosmic rays. Gene needs to be at least 80 feet from the RTG so that the neutrons it emits will not overwhelm the "natural" signal.
119:55:31|ALSJ||Gene has dropped the wrench again; he retrieves it with the rammer.
119:55:35|ALSJ||Jack is referring to one of two level bubbles on the Central Station antenna gimbal assembly. He is leveling the gimbal assembly as per @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-20</a>
119:55:41|ALSJ||Bob thinks that Jack is talking about the level bubble on the top of the Central Station, the one that Jack was using before he raised the top and curtains, rather than the ones on the gimbal assembly. Meanwhile, Gene goes to retrieve the drill from the first heat flow hole.
119:55:56|ALSJ||Gene has the drill in hand.
119:56:11|ALSJ||Gene is back at the second heat flow hole.
119:56:28|ALSJ||Gene threads the 137-cm stem into the drill chuck.
119:56:39|ALSJ||Gene picks up the drill.
119:57:09|ALSJ|CDR|With the station not level, you would just try to get the antenna pointed more or less in the right direction and see if you had an acceptable signal strength.
119:57:09|ALSJ||Gene has to get on tiptoes, his hands above the top of his helmet, to get the stem vertical. He starts drilling.
119:57:44|ALSJ|LMP|Whatever fluid they used evidently had surface tension in excess of the one-sixth g buoyant forces that were trying to move the bubble to the center, at least when the bubble was over at the edge. It took a jarring motion of some sort to break that surface tension.
119:57:44|ALSJ||Unfortunately, we have been unable to identify the fluid in the bubble level. Gene stops drilling and looks at the TV camera.
119:57:55|ALSJ||Gene gestures with his left hand, pointing north.
119:58:22|ALSJ||By putting the detector in a depression and behind a rock, Gene will reduce the contaminating neutron flux from the RTG's plutonium source. Photo AS17-147- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22575"@alsjt>22575</a> is one Jack will take after Gene has finished drilling the deep core hole. The picture is taken looking to the northeast and shows Gene at the Rover, with the east heat flow hole between the Rover and the place where Jack is standing. The rock in question is beyond the Rover to the left and the drill stem rack is just visible over the top of the rock. The RTG is behind Jack and this picture shows that the rock is providing shielding. AS17-134-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20503"@alsjt>20503</a> was taken from just north of the core hole and shows the treadle-and-jack that Gene will use to extract the core. The shielding rock is in the middle distance and, beyond it, we can see the Central Station. The dark object to the left of the Central Station is the RTG. Geophone Rock is beyond the RTG.
119:58:23|ALSJ|LMP|In analyzing cores, people had looked for and found radioisotopes which had been formed by the absorption of cosmic-ray neutrons in the lunar soil. If you knew the neutron flux and spectrum, you could use the abundance of these isotopes to determine ages and turnover rates for the soil. There had been estimates made of the neutron flux and, and there were also a lot of arguments about the estimates. This experiment was designed to give a direct measurement.
119:58:45|ALSJ||Gene stops drilling, looks at his watch on his left wrist, and then resumes.
119:58:46|ALSJ||Gene completes the drilling and reaches for the wrench.
119:58:46|ALSJ|LMP|I suspect that we had practiced this specific ALSEP deployment a half dozen times. I had done the Apollo 15 deployment a few times as part of the backup crew training; and Gene had done the Apollo 14 deployment. You didn't want to train for it too much, because each situation was going to be different. You needed to know it just well enough to be able to be adaptable, and a half dozen times seemed about right.
119:59:09|ALSJ||Gene opens the wrench.
119:59:18|ALSJ||Gene leans on the drill to attach the wrench.
119:59:21|ALSJ||Gene has the drill off.
119:59:31|ALSJ|LMP|The fluid surrounding the level bubbles was probably an oil that wouldn't freeze when it got cold in the LM Equipment Bay. We'd been in the barbecue mode on the way out, rotating the spacecraft to get uniform heating, but there wasn't any active heating in the Equipment Bay and it would have gotten pretty cold. I was probably thinking that the fluid was still a little viscous from having been cold. Maybe that was why the bubble stuck.
119:59:31|ALSJ||Gene takes some care in positioning the drill so that he can lean on it in removing the wrench. He learned a great deal from drilling the first hole and does this second hole much more efficiently.
119:59:57|ALSJ||By turning the shorting plug "On", Jack is letting current flow from the RTG into the Central Station - rather than through the shorting plug itself. Jack notes that the phrase "turning the shorting plug on" is a misnomer.
120:00:05|ALSJ||Gene has the wrench off.
120:00:18|ALSJ||"Full-scale left" usually means "off", and the needle is undoubtedly indicating that there is no current flowing through the shorting plug and, implicitly, that the current is now flowing into the Central Station.
120:00:18|ALSJ||Gene has the second stem (71-cm) out of the rack and is bracing the one in the ground with his right foot, toes up and on the stem, heel down and on the ground. Next, he giggles and twists the stem with his right hand.
120:01:25|ALSJ||Gene needs the wrench to hold the first stem still while he threads the second into it. He leans on the drill to attach the wrench.
120:01:25|ALSJ||Jack is now at the top of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-21</a> and is about the deploy the LEAM (Lunar Ejecta and Meteorite experiment).
120:02:13|ALSJ||This is the rock beyond the garbage pile in AS17-147-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22584"@alsjt>22584</a>. The RTG is in the foreground on the left side of the picture. Notice the deep shadows on the west face of the East Massif on the far horizon. Geophone Rock is at the right edge of the picture and the geophone module is in front of it. The large rock beyond and to the right of the LEAM is one that Jack will examine at 120:22:42, after deploying the east geophone. The planned LEAM deployment location relative to the Central Station is shown on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-15</a>.
120:02:28|ALSJ||The Lunar Ejecta and Meteoroid Experiment is designed to catch and count both small meteoroids and ejecta from lunar impacts. Ejecta from small, local impacts would tend to have rather flat trajectories and a nearby rock would "shadow" ejecta from beyond it. Jack wants to emplace the experiment far enough from the rock that it's shadow will be unimportant. AS17-134-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20500"@alsjt>20500</a> is a good picture of the LEAM with the trash pile, the Central Station, and the LSG beyond it. The RTG is to the right of the Central Station and the white box beyond the RTG is the Heat Flow Experiment package.
120:02:28|ALSJ||Gene has been trying to brace the stem with his foot and with the wrench; he finds that he can lift the stem out of the ground.
120:02:30|ALSJ||Fendell pans away from Gene, looking for Jack, who is southeast of the Central Station deploying the LEAM and apparently releasing the stool legs.
120:03:48|ALSJ||Jack sets the LEAM on the surface and rocks it with the attached UHT to find a level position.
120:05:03|ALSJ||Having removed the UHT, Jack kicks the ribbon cable, perhaps to remove some dirt.
120:05:18|ALSJ||Jack is near the RTG and moves the LEAM cable a little with the UHT.
120:05:24|ALSJ||Jack uses the UHT to pick up the @alsjurl/a17/ap17-S72-37260.jpg"@alsjt>heat flow pallet</a> for use as a base for the seismic array antenna. He is in the middle of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-21</a>
120:06:06|ALSJ||The pallet falls off of Jack's UHT. Apparently, the UHT locking pins had not seated properly in the receptacle on the pallet.
120:06:15|ALSJ|LMP|Anything that is not hermetically sealed is just not going to work very long.
120:06:35|ALSJ|LMP|There were two UHTs. Gene had used his to carry the heat flow electronics box and align it; and then just left the UHT in the heat flow box. So he's warning me not to disturb the alignment when I go to get his UHT later on.
120:06:35|ALSJ||After spending a short while trying to engage the UHT pins, Jack gives up on what we might call the high-tech end of the tool, turns the UHT end for end, and hooks the handle - which we can call the low-tech end - through the red handle which can be seen in NASA photo @alsjurl/a17/ap17-S72-37260.jpg"@alsjt>S72-37260</a>. He then lifts the heat flow pallet off the ground.
120:06:55|ALSJ|CDR|When you stop working and take a rest, you have a chance to look around. Earlier, when I was taking a rest from drilling the first heat flow hole, I had a chance to get ahead and talk to the ground about a place for the core hole, which I wasn't going to do for a long time yet. When you took a rest, that was the only chance you had to just look around; otherwise, you got so involved with what you were doing that you had tunnel vision and your perspective was very limited. So I looked around and said 'Oh, looks like it's getting dark.' Well, I probably had been facing all this bright, reflective soil while I was drilling the hole and all of a sudden I stopped and looked around and things didn't look so bright.
120:06:55|ALSJ||During our review of the mission, Gene and I thought at first that his "Whee" indicated that he was feeling the effects of the maximum cooling. However, as we will discover in a moment, he actually changed his cooling to Minimum. Then we thought that he may have taken a drink of water - which is certainly possible or even likely. However, it seems most likely that his "whee" is simply relief from being able to let go of the drill for a moment.
120:06:55|ALSJ||Jack returns to the Central Station, removes the LSPE antenna and its cable, discards a small object and backs off to the west, paying out cable. During the geology traverses, Jack will deploy a total of eight @alsjurl/tnD7141ApPyrotchnc.html"@alsjt>explosive</a> packages. Each is designed to be fired at a preset time - roughly 90 hours - after deployment and, therefore, well after Gene and Jack are safely off the Moon. A timer in each of the packages prepares it to receive a detonation signal transmitted from the Central Station, and what Jack is now deploying is the whip antenna through which those signals will be transmitted. AS17-136- <a href="images17.html#20705"@alsjt>20705</a> shows the antenna mounted on the pallets, the LSG immediately behind it and Geophone Rock and Bear Mountain in the distance.
120:07:22|ALSJ||Gene is telling him that he hasn't gotten to the end of the cable.
120:07:53|ALSJ||Gene knocks the drill over and then picks it up by going to one knee in a quick down-and-up motion.
120:08:35|ALSJ||In order to keep the socket clean, it is covered with a piece of aluminum foil which, rather than tearing easily, is resisting Jack's efforts to push the antenna through. See Jack's debrief comment at @alsjurl/a17/a17.eva1post.html#1263856"@alsjt>126:38:56</a>.
120:08:52|ALSJ||Jack uses the UHT to push the antenna into the socket.
120:08:55|ALSJ||Gene starts drilling. He is at the top of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-19</a> and is emplacing the second 71-cm stem in the second heat flow hole.
120:08:55|ALSJ||Fendell pans to Jack who is now at the Central Station.
120:09:26|ALSJ||Jack picks up a piece of the Central Station pallet and drops it on the trash pile.
120:10:00|ALSJ|CDR|When the drill's spinning and it hits something, it kicks the drill and spits it back at you. Not vertically, but rotationally. It was tough drilling. I was pushing down and all of sudden it hit something solid; the motor was still running but the bit stopped, so something had to turn. So, the drill turned backwards.
120:10:00|ALSJ||Jack continues policing the trash pile, using the UHT to push things around. He is hopping easily from foot to foot, changing directions and pace without difficulty.
120:10:31|ALSJ||In the deep core hole, which Gene will drill next, he runs into rock-strewn layers at intervals throughout the 3.2 meters of drilling. X-radiography performed after the mission shows an abundance of rock fragments from about 25 cm depth to 110 centimeters, presumably representing ejecta from the Camelot impact. Layers of fragments at 120 and 130 centimeter depths are probably associated with other nearby impacts, such as Poppie. The core then has relatively few fragments to a depth of about 190 cm, with the interval presumably representing reworked ejecta. Fragment layers are then encountered at depths of 250, 280, 290, and 310 centimeters. Although there are certainly differences in the details between the rock fragment distributions with depth at the core and heat flow holes - dependent on the placement of individual rocks in the various ejecta blankets - a general correlation is likely. However, the fact that the deep core is in a shallow depression - coupled with the random horizontal distribution of rocks in the various ejecta blankets - makes it difficult to identify his "hard layer" with a particular fragment zone in the core.
|ALSJ||Jack is running toward the Rover, using what looks to be a very efficient foot-to-foot gait. At one point, he gets his center-of-mass too far to the right and starts to lose his balance. He hops on his right foot a couple of times to get himself centered again.
120:10:37|ALSJ||Jack does a high kangaroo hop to avoid the first heat flow hole.
120:10:55|ALSJ||Because of John Young's accident, no heat flow measurements were made on Apollo 16 and this is the last chance to confirm the Apollo 15 data. @alsjurl/langseth.html"@alsjt>Marcus Langseth</a> is the Principal Investigator.
120:11:01|ALSJ||Gene is on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-19</a> and has just finished drilling the second heat flow hole. He has the wrench attached to the top stem and is trying to twist off the drill; but he has to get down to re-position the wrench. The TV jiggles as Jack works at the Rover. He is getting his camera and the gnomon so that he can document the geophones as he deploys them. He is at the top of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-22</a>.
120:11:53|ALSJ||Gene has the drill off.
120:12:04|ALSJ||Gene positions the drill, leans on it, and removes the wrench.
120:12:08|ALSJ||Gene has the wrench off and hangs it on the rack. He moves the drill out of the way. The TV has stopped jiggling, so Jack is probably on his way to the geophone module.
120:12:49|ALSJ||After a couple of unsuccessful attempts, Gene uses the wrench to pick up the heat flow probe. He removes the cover which he then drops accidentally.
120:13:43|ALSJ||Gene now drops the wrench as he tries to hang it on the rack.
120:13:54|ALSJ|LMP|Except for the little things, the ALSEP deployment went pretty much like training; and many, if not most, of the little problems had already happened in training. The only physically difficult part of the deployment was carrying the ALSEP out to the site, and then using your hands. All the manipulation just wore out the forearm muscles. You went slower and slower and slower, and then you got to the point where you started dropping things.
120:13:54|ALSJ||Gene tosses something off to the north, and then comments on how far it's flying with so little effort.
120:15:19|ALSJ||The probe goes in fairly easily.
120:15:42|ALSJ||Papa 1 and Foxtrot 1 are the desired depths of the bottom and middle shields, as indicated on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-19</a>. Bravo 1 is the height of the top stem. Bob was talking to the Experiments people in Houston and didn't realized that Gene had only given the last of these readings.
120:16:02|ALSJ||Gene attaches the rammer to the cable.
120:16:03|ALSJ||This is the mark indicating the deepest and most desirable penetration.
120:16:34|ALSJ||Gene removes the rammer from the hole and re-attaches it to the next higher probe.
120:17:00|ALSJ||@alsjurl/Fendell-Bio.pdf"@alsjt>Fendell</a> pans away from Gene. Jack is emplacing Geophone 3 eighty-eight feet south of the geophone module. Gene is looking in his direction and, with Jack in the foreground, is getting an appreciation for just how big Geophone Rock is. It is 3 meters tall, or about 10 feet. Jack is at the middle of <a href="a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-22</a>.
120:17:21|ALSJ||Fendell finds Jack as he deploys Geophone 3. He is thirty meters south of the module and about 20 meters northeast of Geophone Rock. For future reference, the gnomon is visible in the TV picture. Frame AS17-147- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22549"@alsjt>22549</a> is a documentation photo of geophone number 3, which Jack will take at about 120:38. Note the geophone flag and the gnomon at the left side, just in front of the partially buried boulder. Note, also, that Gene is at the Rover. Patrick Vantuyne has created a red-blue anaglyph from 22548 and 49 ( <a name="22548/9" href="A17-147-22548(9).jpg"@alsjt>435k</a> ).
120:17:21|ALSJ||Training photo @alsjurl/a17/ap17-72-H-1412.jpg"@alsjt>72-H-1412</a> show Jack deploying a geophone at the Cape. Note the cable reel on the UHT in his left hand and the anchor/flag in the right foreground.
120:17:41|ALSJ|LMP|By running the heat flow cable southward out of the hole, you got more uniform heating than you would if the cable ran east or west. That way you could calculate more easily the error that cable heating introduced into the measurements.
120:17:41|ALSJ||Jack returns to the Geophone Module near the RTG. He runs using a foot-to-foot stride and, as he gets close, plants both feet in front of himself. The 30 meter run takes about 25 seconds, including a few steps at the beginning to get himself up to speed and a few at the end to stop. His average speed is 4.3 kph. For a long time, I thought Jack had left the gnomon near Geophone 3 by accident but, from the evidence of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-22</a> and @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-23</a>, he had planned to leave the gnomon until after taking the photos listed on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-23</a>.
120:17:41|ALSJ|LMP|Although it doesn't look like it on the television, you actually had to rotate your hips a little bit to get your feet to stick into the ground.
120:18:11|ALSJ||Jack turns to the east and shields his eyes to find a predetermined point on the East Massif which he will use as a horizon marker so that he can take the east geophone out in the right direction.
120:18:42|ALSJ|CDR|I called the heat flow rammer a 'javelin' because what I really wanted to do was give it a heave-ho on the Moon and see what it would do.
120:18:52|ALSJ||Jack picks up geophone 1 by inserting the UHT in the top of the cable reel and lifting it out of the @alsjurl/a17/ap17-S72-37259.jpg"@alsjt>module</a>, and starts running east.
120:19:27|ALSJ|CDR|The checklist pages were made of fairly stiff paper and were about two-and-a-half inches square. They lay flat on your wrist because they were bound with a spiral wire hinge that forced them to bow up. As soon as you turned a page, the hinge put a stress on it and it would lay flat. The tabs that you used to turn the page weren't very large, but even in the gloves it wasn't really hard to get them turned.
120:19:27|ALSJ||A detail from Apollo 13 training photo @alsjurl/cuffcheckbind.jpg"@alsjt>70-HC-83</a> is a good side view of Jim Lovell's cuff checklist.
120:20:14|ALSJ||Jack reaches the end of the east geophone cable. He is part way down in the swale; the LM is in the background. In looking at the television picture, it appears that the LM is below the ALSEP site and, indeed, at several points in the mission it looks as though the Rover is sitting on high ground when, as is the case here, there is actually no elevation difference. Here, the fact that Jack is down in the swale may contribute to the impression.
120:20:14|ALSJ||Gene sounds fairly playful now.
120:20:32|ALSJ||Fendell pans away from Jack.
120:21:21|ALSJ|LMP|Each of the geophones was a cylinder that had a stake on one end. You put the point in the ground and then just stepped on the geophone to push it down into the surface.
120:21:21|ALSJ||One of the geophones can be seen at the lower left in @alsjurl/a17/ap17-S72-37259.jpg"@alsjt>S72-37259</a>, just below the thick cable which connects the module to the ALSEP Central Station.
120:21:21|ALSJ||Training photo @alsjurl/a17/ap17-72-H-1412.jpg"@alsjt>72-H-1412</a> show Jack deploying a geophone at the Cape. note the cable rell on the UHT in his left hand and the anchor/flag in the right foreground.
120:21:26|ALSJ||Frame AS17-136-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20695"@alsjt>20695</a> from Jack ALSEP pan shows Gene kneeling at the deep core hole. After extracting the core, he will place the neutron probe in the hole and needs to shield the probe from the RTG as much as possible by siting the core hole in a depression or, as he actually did, with a large rock blocking the line-or-sight to the RTG. The boulder in question is immedaitely south of Gene.
120:22:38|ALSJ||Fendell finds Jack again. He is looking toward Gene.
120:22:42|ALSJ||On his way back to the geophone module, Jack stops at a meter-high rock due south of the Rover. He leans on it for a few seconds to examine the minerals and then goes to get the next geophone. The rock appears on the right side of AS17-147- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22549"@alsjt>22549</a>, taken near Geophone 3, and is in the center of AS17-147- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22584"@alsjt>22584</a>, taken near the RTG.
120:22:51|ALSJ||The sound of Gene's drilling can be heard. After examining the rock, Jack makes his way to the geophone module, describing the rock to Bob as he runs.
120:23:31|ALSJ||Jack puts the geophone module upright, picks up geophone 2, and looks west. He is at the top of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-23</a>.
120:24:28|ALSJ||Gene is looking for his wrench, which may have popped off the core stem as a result of tension built up in the wrench while he blocked it with his leg so he could remove the drill.
120:24:57|ALSJ||He means "glass-covered crater bottoms". He is standing on the geophone 1 cable about 10 feet east of the geophone module, sighting across it to the western horizon.
120:25:00|ALSJ||Jack picks up a flag and heads west, talking as he runs.
120:26:13|ALSJ|LMP|For various reasons, you sometimes see places in a rock where it's splitting and coming apart. In this case I was saying that I thought the splitting in the rock I'd just examined was produced by the alignment of prismatic habit minerals parallel to that plane; and that's called a foliation. What that implies is some kind of stress during crystallization, either a flow stress as in a volcanic rock, or a shear stress during re-crystallization. By 'outcrop' you'd usually mean something attached to bedrock; in this case there would have been no evidence of that but, for some reason, probably just the size of the boulder, I used the term.
120:26:13|ALSJ||The term "prismatic habit" is a reference to elongated minerals with three or more edges parallel to the axis of elongation. Jack emplaces the geophone, tamping dirt around it with his foot.
120:27:03|ALSJ||Jack goes back to the geophone module, taking long running strides. He covers the 50-meter distance in 33 seconds for an average speed of 5.4 kilometers per hour. He takes about 30 strides, each about 5.5 feet in length. Geophone 4 will be emplaced 90 meters south of the geophone module.
120:27:41|ALSJ|LMP|By now I'm taking longer and longer strides and the running technique is getting to be very much like cross-country skiing. On future missions, either for recreation or for an emergency walkback, you ought to have ski poles available for stabilization. At this point I wasn't breathing hard and I think that, with poles, you could go faster than the Rover can drive (10-12 km/hr on a level surface) without expending much energy. And that way you could greatly extend your driving distance with a Rover. I also think the recreation of choice will be getting out and taking long 'skiing' trips. Just like with cross-country skiing, I think you could almost keep it up indefinitely. And if you had a suit with more hip-and-ankle mobility I think you really could do 10-15 km/hr, a good cross-country speed on flat terrain.
120:27:41|ALSJ||Jack's peak @alsjurl/a17/a17.mr11_2b.gif"@alsjt>heart rate</a> through this period is about 120 beats per minute at about 120:35 (in graph coordinates, 117:55), while he is running south with Geophone 4.
120:27:49|ALSJ||Fendell pans to find Gene, who is northwest of the Rover.
120:28:22|ALSJ|LMP|I don't remember why, but we didn't want the geophone cables to be suspended above the surface as they went across craters and depressions but, rather, wanted them to follow the contours.
120:29:30|ALSJ||Gene starts threading another core stem pair.
120:30:05|ALSJ||Gene leans on the drill to remove the wrench.
120:30:40|ALSJ||Gene picks up the drill.
120:31:08|ALSJ||When Jack got to the end of the west geophone line, the cable pulled taut; and, if the geophone module - to which the cables were all attached - had moved, it would have put tension on the remaining cables.
120:31:16|ALSJ||Gene attaches the drill and starts drilling.
120:31:16|ALSJ|LMP|We had anticipated that if any of the lines got pulled and the module moved, one or more of the geophones would get pulled out. So we equipped the module with an anchor of some sort, to keep it stationary. Obviously, the anchors wouldn't hold in the loose soil.
120:31:16|ALSJ||Gene has started drilling.
120:31:59|ALSJ||Gene completes the stem, attaches the wrench, removes the drill, and rests for a moment.
120:33:02|ALSJ|CDR|As I said earlier, when you stop and take a rest, that's when you have a chance to look around. You've got a second or two to yourself. You take a deep breath, take a rest for a second, and look around, and that's when you begin to enjoy your environment, look at what Jack's doing, look at the beautiful Earth, or notice just how high the mountains are. These are the times you can steal for yourself. But that first "oh boy" here definitely referred to how tired my hands were from working with the drill.
120:33:02|ALSJ||Jack may be running south with Geophone 4. If he maintained the 5.4 km/hr pace he had running from geophone 2 to the geophone module, the 80 meter trip would take 53 seconds.
120:33:02|ALSJ||Gene gets another stem pair and can't get it seated. As he tries to thread it, motion of the wrench, which is attached to the stem in the ground, shows that Gene is turning both stems, rather than connecting them. He gets down on his knees, with his right hand on the drill for stability and trying, again, to thread the new stem. The wrench moves again and, to hold it and the bottom stem still, he puts the wrench's wire loop handle over the drill. After 25 seconds of effort, he finally gets the third stem pair seated and, with help from the internal pressure of the suit, hops up, knocking the drill over. He rests for a second and then retrieves the drill on his second attempt to bob low enough to grab the wire handle. After positioning the drill, he then uses it for support as he drops to his knees to remove the wrench. He fails to get it off and hops up to his feet to take a rest.
120:35:10|ALSJ|CDR|In addition to getting tired in the hands and forearms, the other thing that was tiring was getting down and getting up. In training on Earth, with all the weight of a full backpack in full gravity, it was damn near impossible to get down and get back up. That's why, a lot of times in training we used lightweight backpacks with hoses supplying oxygen and cooling water so we wouldn't have to carry that weight. And in one-sixth gravity, even though it's easy enough to get up and down, you were bulky, you were still heavy, and the suit was cumbersome. That's why you're going to see a lot of this 'Going to take a rest for a minute.' You just got physically tired. At the end of the day, particularly that first day, we were really tired.
120:35:16|ALSJ|CDR|The drill stem was sticking out of the ground maybe eight or ten inches or so. Here on Earth, I could take that third stem and stand above the one in the ground, put those locking thread down in it, twist it, and get it locked. But on the Moon, with the stiffness of the suit and the lack of dexterity, if you got it slightly misaligned, the threads would cross, even thought they were big threads. We'd thought about all sorts of things so we wouldn't get them crossed; but it still got wedged. So you had to get down, probably on two knees, so that you could get your hands right down there where the action was and get that thing in and aligned. And then, after you were up, then you had to get the drill and put it on. All those things were physically taxing. The getting up, getting down, and the little intricate work you had to do with your hands.
120:35:16|ALSJ||Gene positions the drill, but knocks it over again. It takes him two tries to bob low enough to grab it. Evidently, he doesn't want to use the drill stems for support, probably because he doesn't want to damage them. During the following, Gene has the drill in his right hand, puts it down without letting go, puts his weight on the drill, gets his right knee down and then his left, removes the wrench and stands.
120:35:42|ALSJ||Checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-22</a> indicates that Jack planned to take documentation photographs of any geophones emplacements from which he couldn't see the geophone 3 flag. To this point, he hasn't taken any geophone photos but, probably because of Bob's query, takes AS17-147- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22528"@alsjt>22528</a> here at geophone 4.
120:35:42|ALSJ||On his way back to the geophone module, he will take @alsjurl/a17/a17.1203602_pan.jpg"@alsjt>several photos</a> of a small crater lying between Geophone 4 and Geophone Rock. These are AS17-147- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22529"@alsjt>22529</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22532"@alsjt>22532</a>. Jim Scotti notes, "These photos give a good free viewing stereo bit that covers the rocks in the foreground and the right edge of the crater. It's not hard for my eyes to compensate for the slight vertical misalignment of the two images to merge the stereo. It looks to me that the crater is actually a pair of craters.
120:35:42|ALSJ||Your editor regrets that 'free viewing stereo' is not one of his abilities. Sigh.
120:36:15|ALSJ||Gene hangs the wrench on the rack. His breathing is a bit labored. His heart rate (at 118:00 hours on the chart) is over 140 beats per minute again.
120:36:26|ALSJ||Gene picks up the drill.
120:36:26|ALSJ||Gene attaches the drill to the stem.
120:36:47|ALSJ||Parker is involved in a discussion about the length of the EVA and does not answer. Fendell pans away from Gene.
120:38:04|ALSJ||Gene is saying that, even if the hole does collapse, he thinks he could push the probe in at least a couple of feet.
120:38:04|ALSJ|LMP|I'd been doing 'instrument science' for several hours at this point, and I wasn't going to pass up a rock that size. It was my first chance to look at the detailed texture of a big rock and to get some idea of how much I was going to be able to see if, and when, we got a chance to do some geology. The ALSEP always did cut into the time for exploration and I spent an awful lot of my career as a troubleshooting astronaut trying to cut down the amount of time it would take people to deploy that thing. And, although we had some successes, as the ALSEPs got more complicated, the amount of time spent in deployment always seemed to grow.
120:38:04|ALSJ|LMP|Geophone Rock was probably ejected from Camelot but, even if it had been thrown into the valley from a long way off, it gave you a chance to see if there were any textures on scales larger than you could see in a hand specimen, changes in the character and structure of the rock over distances of more than a few inches. At Station 6, for example, examination of the big rocks there showed us some clear cases of intrusion by one breccia into another; and the chances of seeing something like that in a hand specimen are very small. Geophone Rock was also a chance to do some geology standing up. As soon as you had to bend down or squat down or lie down to see something, the physical stress became a distraction from your mental work.
120:38:04|ALSJ|LMP|As I recall, Geophone Rock was my first chance to convince myself that I could distinguish several of the minerals in these relatively coarse-grained basalts. In particular, I could see pyroxene and plagioclase, the plagioclase being most obvious because it gave white haloes around the micrometeorite impact craters - called 'zap pits' - on the rock surface. It was also my first chance to look at the patina which had been identified as a splatter covering of brown glass produced by those same impacts. Each zap would knock off patina right around the impact point, but would also add brown glass elsewhere, so, over a large rock surface, it was a steady-state process.
120:39:05|ALSJ||Gene sounds tired; he and Jack have been awake for 15 hours at this point. One interpretation of Gene's "unleaded, automatic" core stem is that he means "A-1, top quality". During the mission review, Jack raised the possibility that there had been concern about lead contamination from the core tubes, themselves, during Apollo 15 and/or 16 and that there had been a design change as a result. In her <i>Catalog of Apollo Lunar Surface Geological Sampling Tools and Containers</i>, Judy Allton writes: "On Apollo 17, to reduce lead contamination of the cored soil from the drill stems and bit, the core stems were treated with nitric acid and special processes were employed in the application of lubricant and color codes. Excess brazing compound was removed from the core bit to reduce silver and copper contamination.
120:39:26|ALSJ||Fendell pans away from Jack.
120:39:39|ALSJ||In 1969, the American Broadcasting Company began broadcasting a weekly, Monday night National Football League game. Prior to this time, almost all NFL games had been played on Sundays and, for a few years, at least, Monday Night Football was immensely popular.
120:40:08|ALSJ||It is about 9:33 p.m. Central Standard Time on Monday, December 11. The games started at 8 p.m. CST and, therefore, the first half has probably just ended.
120:40:21|ALSJ||Public Affairs reports that the EVA is also at the half and that the oxygen use rate is a little high. Houston is projecting a 6 hour, 45 minute EVA. Fendell finds Gene, just as he starts to drill the final stem pair. He stops drilling with the top of the stem about 3 feet out of the ground. He looks west, adjusts his sun shade, rests for a few seconds, then continues drilling. As per checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-23</a>, Jack is probably at Geophone 3, taking documentation photographs and a @alsjurl/a17/a17pan1204030.jpg"@alsjt>pan</a>. The pan consists of frames AS17-147- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22544"@alsjt>22544</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22562"@alsjt>22562</a>.

120:40:21|ALSJ||Note that photo @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22549"@alsjt>22549</a> appears to show Gene at the Rover. However, an examination of the relative locations of Geophone 3, the Rover, and the deep core hole are consistent with Gene being at the deep core hole when this picture was taken. In addition, Gene doesn't go over to the Rover until about 120:48 and, at that time, Jack takes another pan consisting of frames AS17-147- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22569"@alsjt>22569</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22588"@alsjt>22588</a>. In frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22580"@alsjt>22580</a>, the East Massif is in the distance on the right-hand side of the picture while the Sculptured Hills are behind the LM. Note the relatively high reflectivity of the Rover tracks in the middle distance and of the foreground footprints. The higher albedo is produced when the surface is compressed by a firm, flat object, such as the @alsjurl/a17/a12/AS12-57-8448.jpg"@alsjt>sole of the lunar boot</a> or by the chevrons on the Rover tires.
120:43:30|ALSJ||Gene removes the wrench from the rack.
120:43:51|ALSJ||As per @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-20</a>, Gene let the drill run for a few seconds without letting the stem penetrate deeper in the ground. This lets the flutes bring all of the cuttings to the surface, a process that should reduce friction when Gene extracts the stem with a jack and treadle.
120:43:55|ALSJ||Gene attaches the wrench.
120:44:20|ALSJ||Gene starts to remove the drill.
120:44:30|ALSJ||Gene has removed the drill, starts to put it down, but then re-attaches it.
120:44:35|ALSJ||Evidently, Jack didn't remember to bring the gnomon back with him after he finished the documentation photos and the pan at Geophone 3.
120:44:38|ALSJ||In an effort to save time, Gene tries pulling the core out by the drill handles. The stem doesn't move far enough for the motion to be obvious in the TV picture.
120:45:08|ALSJ||Gene removes the drill again.
120:45:34|ALSJ||Gene removes the wrench, but with a little struggle.
120:45:47|ALSJ||That is, Gene will have to use the jack to extract the core.
120:46:31|ALSJ||Gene gets a core plug from the rack. His "good" has the flavor of "I'm glad that it's you that has to do it." He is at the bottom of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-20</a>.
120:46:31|ALSJ|LMP|Either one of us could have taken the ALSEP photos, depending on who was ahead in the timeline. I can't remember why it was so onerous a job; but, apparently, neither one of us really wanted to do it.
120:46:31|ALSJ||The ALSEP photoplan appears on cuff checklist pages @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-25</a> and @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-23</a>. Although the photos were nominally Jack's responsibility, Gene's page @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-22</a> indicates that, had he been ahead of Jack in the timeline, he was to help with the geophone deployment and the ALSEP photos, as appropriate. The complexity of the photoplan explains why neither of them was eager to do the task.
120:46:31|ALSJ|CDR|We had done some cross-training on the deployment, but we specialized in certain things; like I in the drill, and Jack in the ALSEP deployment. But, because we trained together on them, I think I could have deployed the ALSEP, just like he could have handled the drill or even the Rover for that matter. I sort of got into the systems maybe a little bit more than he did, and he got in the ALSEP a little bit more than I did, but I wouldn't have had any problems, nor would he. It would have taken a little longer, maybe; but we could have gotten the job done.
120:46:31|ALSJ|LMP|As I remember it, we did a little bit of cross-training, but mostly for the case that one of the PLSSs wouldn't work and we had to do a one-man EVA. Actually, I don't know if they would have allowed a one-man EVA. NASA was pretty conservative by this time. As another example of that conservatism is that, if we had started planning early enough, we could have had consumables enough to stay on the Moon for four days with some reserves. But they wouldn't let us plan for it. There would have been trade-offs. In order to meet the margins, you probably wouldn't have been able to take some of the equipment, but you could have done it.
120:46:31|ALSJ||I remember that right after Bill Anders replaced Mike Collins on Apollo 8, probably in August '68, Alan Shepard - who was head of the Astronaut Office at that time - assigned (Buzz) Aldrin and myself to pull together a briefing for the President's Science Advisory Committee: Charlie Towns' committee. They had been asked to be briefed on NASA's plans for the first lunar landing mission. The trouble was that nobody had put together a plan since the time when the Design Reference Mission was defined prior to the RFPs (Request for Proposals) being issued for the lunar module. But by '68 we had to get realistic. So I pulled together the timeline - working with a small group of people - for what eventually became Apollo 12. And it was in that process - in defining the first mission with an ALSEP deployment - that we realized that the chances of a first mission having more than one EVA and having weight margins to carry the ALSEP with confidence had very remote possibilities. That's when I first raised the issue of designing a smaller ALSEP - called EASEP (Early Apollo Surface Experiment Package) - that included only a seismometer and a corner reflector. That was what eventually flew on Apollo 11; and that was put together in a hurry. When we briefed the PSAC, some of our viewgraphs indicated that we didn't think that the mission we'd put together could be the first lunar landing mission because of these problems. On the first mission you probably wanted all the weight margins you could get, and, at the time, it seemed as though the weight of the LM was growing and we realized that the 300 lb ALSEP was going to be a lot easier to kick off than a 100 lb alternative. Also, it was the first time anybody had put together a lunar-surface timeline, and we had to consider things like one-man versus two-man EVAs because they were still talking about doing umbilical EVAs rather than PLSS EVAs. Deke (Slayton) was very helpful in that he put his foot down and said Flight Crew Operations Directorate demanded a two-man EVA, and said that we weren't going to be constrained by umbilicals because they were too dangerous.
120:46:40|ALSJ||Jack is also beginning to sound a little punchy.
120:47:19|ALSJ||Gene uses the drill as a support to get low enough to insert the core plug.

120:49:06|ALSJ|LMP|On the camera focus, we had a number of detents that you could feel. They were calibrated for photogrammetric analysis but, in this case, I was assuming - correctly or incorrectly - that they didn't do photogrammetry with these pictures. A fifteen-foot focus of the ALSEP site sounds a little short to me now, but that's what I did.
120:49:06|ALSJ||Gene leaves the Rover, carrying the treadle-and-jack.
120:50:02|ALSJ||Gene leans on the drill to drive the plug with the rammer. Jack is referring to @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-25</a>. The drawings suggest that Jack is supposed to take cross-Sun (south-looking) and down-Sun (west looking) photos of the two heat flow holes, but no up-Suns (east looking).
120:50:19|ALSJ||As noted in @alsjurl/a17/a17psr_tbl8-II.jpg"@alsjt>Table 8-II</a> in the Apollo 17 Preliminary Science Report, the deep-core rammer went about 30 cm into the top stem. Using Gene's estimate that about 8 inches (20 cm) of the top stem was above ground, the top of the soil column was about 10 cm below the ground surface, undoubtedly due to compaction. As is discussed on @alsjurl/a17/a17psr_p8-5.jpg"@alsjt>page 8-5</a> in the Preliminary Science Report, at some time before the stems arrived at the Lunar Receiving Lab, the plug moved upward by 15 cm, causing "some loosening and disturbance" of the material in the top three stems, which had been returned to Earth as a unit.
120:50:27|ALSJ||Gene leans on the drill, holding the cap. He may be kneeling again.
120:50:42|ALSJ||Jack's pan starts with AS17-147- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22589"@alsjt>22589</a> and ends with @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22606"@alsjt>22606</a>. Frames @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22598"@alsjt>22598</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22599"@alsjt>22599</a> show Gene at the deep core hole.
120:50:47|ALSJ||Bob is asking if Jack has enabled the seismic experiment as per @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-24</a>; Gene picks up the treadle.
120:51:01|ALSJ||Jack is asking Bob to make sure that he completes all of his tasks. Gene fits the jack handle to the treadle, and telescopes the handle out to about waist height. He then moves the drill.
120:51:01|ALSJ||Gene fits the treadle over the core stem.
120:51:39|ALSJ||Gene tries holding the treadle down with his right foot.
120:51:39|ALSJ||Jack has just run out of film. At this moment, Ron Evans is passing overhead and has the following conversation with Houston.
120:51:39|ALSJ||Map coordinate DM 83 is about 250 meters west and 100 meters south of the LM. Ron's previous estimate - at 115:09:01 - of DN 83.3 is much better than Houston's. This is Ron's last report on the landing site.
120:52:17|ALSJ|CDR|It was a lot of hard work; and not at all easy.
120:52:47|ALSJ||Mag Alpha is also magazine 147 in the overall Apollo series.
120:52:54|ALSJ||During this interval, there is a discussion in Houston about the film magazines. It, along with a subsequent discussion is reproduced here to illustrate what was going on in Houston throughout the EVA.<br> <strong>EVA</strong> - Flight (Director), EVA (Team).<br> <strong>Flight</strong> - Go ahead.<br> <strong>EVA</strong> - Okay, when we change, we're going to need to go to H.<br> <strong>Flight</strong> - Magazine Hotel.<br> <strong>Parker</strong> - Okay, and do we want them to take the next one (the next pan) at 74 (foot focus)?<br> <strong>EVA</strong> - Yes, that's right.
120:53:22|ALSJ||Magazine Hotel is a black-and-white magazine, number 136 in the overall Apollo series.
120:53:25|ALSJ||To begin a stroke, Gene stands facing the Rover with the core at his right foot. With his left hand, he raises the handle to the vertical position, seats it against the core stem and pushes the handle across to his left to about the 45 degree position, at which point the jack bites against the stem. He then pushes the handle down another 15 or 20 degrees. Because the fulcrum is very close to the stem, he only raises the stem about an inch. After a couple of tries, he moves further from the core to his left so that he can get a longer stroke.
120:53:36|ALSJ||Gene is now almost going to his knees with every stroke, one every five or six seconds.
120:53:38|ALSJ||The jack is mounted on a treadle, a flat platform about a foot long and maybe six inches wide. In principle, the treadle provides a big surface for spreading the force of the jack lifting the core tube. However, the soft soil tends to shift under the pressure and the treadle is trying to bury itself.
120:53:38|ALSJ|LMP|The undisturbed regolith is well-packed and fairly dense, with a density of about, if I remember correctly, 1.9 grams per cubic centimeter. But, as soon as you start to stir it up, it loosens. So you can work things down into it, gradually, even though you don't sink into it when you walk on it.
120:54:00|ALSJ||Gene has raised the core about one foot; and he now kneels, with his back to the Rover, so that he can push the handle all the way to the surface with his right hand.
120:54:00|ALSJ|CDR|I was only able to get it out an inch or two at a time. The core was eight or nine feet long, so I was pumping the jack for a long time. I'd jack the core up a little bit and then I'd have to get the jaws back on the core tube with the other hand so that they wouldn't slip when I jacked again. I can still remember doing this, right down on my knees. It was a lot of hard work, as you can tell by the way I'm breathing and by the way I'm talking. My one-sixth-gravity weight was holding me down enough to give me leverage, but it was still difficult because it required all forearm work and finger dexterity work.
120:54:00|ALSJ||In Houston, there is a renewed conversation about the pan and the film magazine.<br> <strong>Experiments</strong>: Flight, Experiments. (No answer)<br> <strong>EVA</strong>: Flight, EVA. (No answer)<br> <strong>Parker</strong>: Experiments, this is CapCom.<br> <strong>Experiments</strong>: Go ahead.<br> <strong>Parker</strong>: Are we going to come back and take all the same photos over again on the second...(correcting himself) the third EVA? If so, we're kind of gilding the lily with two pans here.<br> {'Gilding the lily' is either a contraction or misremeberance of a line from Act 4, Scene 2 in Shakespeare's King John: 'To gild refined gold, to paint the lily ...' and means 'needless excess'. I came across it growing up in the suburbs of New York in the 1950s. The <a href="http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/gild-the-lily.html"@alsjt>earliest use I encountered in a quick web search</a> is from 1895.}<br> <strong>Flight</strong>: EVA, you called?<br> <strong>Experiments</strong>: (To Bob) We're not going to duplicate anything.<br> <strong>EVA</strong>: (To Flight) That should be magazine Golf in lieu of Hotel.
120:54:37|ALSJ|LMP|The guys in the Control Room were as deeply involved in the exploration as anybody and had a lot to do to make it possible. Sometimes, although not very often, they just couldn't come to a decision fast enough. It was tough to do. You've got two guys hopping around on the Moon making their own decisions and, to make a recommendation about which film pack to use, you've got to talk to the people who can give you an informed answer; and that takes time. The way that people worked in and with the Control Room is an important part of the story. We knew that these conversations were going on back in Houston because we'd been in the control room or the science support room on other missions; but, of course, we couldn't hear - and wouldn't have had time to hear - what was going on.
120:54:37|ALSJ||The TV jiggles as Jack works at the Rover.
120:55:21|ALSJ||Gene stops to rest and stands up. He has been raising up off his knees and then dropping down to put more force on the jack.
120:55:28|ALSJ|LMP|It's amazing to see Gene get right down on his haunches in this sequence, almost with his backside on his heels. There's no way I could have done that; I just couldn't bend my suit that much. Maybe Gene could because he is tall, because he's got longer legs.
120:55:28|ALSJ||Gene appears to have used his left hand to grip the core stem, which may have given him leverage to help keep himself down on his knees.
120:55:38|ALSJ||In Houston, Bob is being told that it is unlikely that they will be doing complete ALSEP pans on EVA-3.
120:55:49|ALSJ|LMP|We had the treadle-and-jack because of the trouble Dave Scott and Jim Irwin had in pulling the Apollo 15 core out by hand. But, at least on our mission, it looks as though it took up just as much time and energy. I was offering to put in a shift at the jack but, thank God, he refused it. I don't think I could have done as well as he was doing; he could get down to it.
120:55:52|ALSJ||Jack's offer to prepare the neutron probe - as per @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-24</a> - could save a little time, but won't help with Gene's basic problem of removing the core. Gene kneels east of the core, using his left hand to work the jack and his right hand on the core stems for stability.
120:55:52|ALSJ||Meanwhile, Jack has probably started taking his @alsjurl/a17/a17.1205555_pan.jpg"@alsjt>pan</a>. It consists of frames AS17-136- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20683"@alsjt>20683</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20710"@alsjt>20710</a>.
120:55:52|ALSJ||Frames AS17-136- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20694"@alsjt>20694</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20695"@alsjt>20695</a>, and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20696"@alsjt>20696</a> show Gene kneeling east of the core.
120:55:59|ALSJ||Gene is pressing the jack handle all the way to the ground. With each stroke, he leans to his left, lifting his right knees a few inches off the ground. This seems to be the most efficient technique he as used so far.
120:56:53|ALSJ||That is, Jack has been suspecting that there is only a shallow layer of regolith, which would mean drilling into rock, or least, fractured rock.
120:57:05|ALSJ||The Surgeon @alsjurl/a17/a17.mr11_2a.gif"@alsjt>reports</a> that Gene is running at about 150 heart beats per minute and a metabolic rate of about 2000 BTU/hr, about twice the average expected for ALSEP deployment. He does a total of nine strokes during this session and, not surprisingly, his breathing indicates that pushing the handle down is the hard part.
120:57:23|ALSJ||Gene uses the core stem, now about waist height, as a support as he hops up onto his feet.
120:57:30|ALSJ|CDR|I'm almost getting tired just from listening to this. I'm going back to those moments; and the comments and the sound of my voice really show how tired I was and how hard it was to get that thing out.
120:57:56|ALSJ||Gene reaches back to change the @alsjurl/alsj-ValveCluster.html"@alsjt>cooling setting</a>. He has been standing with his arms out in front of him. This is a natural rest position of the inflated suit and Gene can stand like this for a long time without appreciable effort. He has cables inside his suit that are fixed at the center of his chest, run laterally across to his arm pits and then up, over the outside of his shoulders through tubes and, finally, are attached at the center of his back. Friction of the cables in the tubes help him keep his arm in any position he chooses without effort and in order to reach the @alsjurl/alsj-ValveCluster.html"@alsjt>cooling control on the bottom of his PLSS</a>, Gene has to move his right arm forward and then back, twice, in a vertical plane to overcome the cable friction before he can reach the diverter valve. Gene and Jack will use this "double wave" motion throughout the mission to reach their controls. The shoulder tubes can be seen in a <a href="ap17-72-H-314.jpg"@alsjt>photo</a> (scan by Ed Hengeveld) from a suit fit session which shows a subject - probably Jack - seated on a minimalist Rover mock-up. Note, also, the waist @alsjurl/alsj-SuitConvolutes.html"@alsjt>convolute</a> that allows them to sit.
120:57:56|ALSJ|CDR|The suits were very integral machines. We had arm bearings and elbow joints and wrist joints in the Apollo suits. But we have yet to be able to devise a suit where you incorporate everything from the fingers, to the fists, to the hand, to the wrists, to the elbow, to the shoulder in one motion. Unencumbered by a suit, we can move our arms in any direction using a combination of simultaneous joint movements. To reach for something on a desk behind you, you twist in your chair, turn your head, and move most of the joints in your shoulder and your arm; and you do all those things at once. In a suit you can eventually position your arm or your hand almost any way you want but you're limited to maybe two movements at a time. You can't just incorporate a rotation, an extension, and an arm-bearing movement all at one time. You have to do one or two of those actions, and then do the others. I hate to say it, but it was almost like being a robot sometimes. God made the human machine and we have not been able to make a mechanical device which will incorporate all those movements at the same time
120:58:26|ALSJ||Jack's three photos of the heat flow holes are AS17-136- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20711"@alsjt>20711</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20712"@alsjt>20712</a>, and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20713"@alsjt>20713</a>.
120:58:28|ALSJ||Gene switches to @alsjurl/alsj-ValveCluster.html"@alsjt>Intermediate cooling</a> and then starts jacking again, this time left handed from his standing position north of the core. Surgeon reports his heart rate is down to 133.
120:58:28|ALSJ||In response to a question from Journal Contributor Ricardo Salam&eacute; P&aacute;ez , Claire Johnson, Gene's able assistant, writes: "Gene is right-handed, but he tells me that, because he's a pilot, he's almost ambidextrous.
120:59:05|ALSJ||Gene stops jacking.
120:59:08|ALSJ||While drilling and operating the jack, Gene has been using much more cooling water than Jack has and, if the imbalance remains, they might have to re-enter the LM with Jack still having cooling water in reserve. By spelling Gene, Jack might help extend the EVA a few precious minutes.
120:59:31|ALSJ||Jack reaches the core site; he has yet to push a button at the bottom rear of the Central Station - one of a row of about five or six one-inch diameter buttons - which will turn on the Lunar Surface Profiling Experiment (LSPE), the seismic experiment. This task is at the top of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-24</a> and was skipped when Houston asked Jack to check the LEAM.
120:59:31|ALSJ||Gene stands on the treadle; Jack moves from south of the core to northwest and kicks over the drill-stem rack in the process. He starts jacking.
121:00:24|ALSJ||Jack now has his right hand on the core for balance while he literally falls forward on the handle with his left hand. He has his toes as far out behind as he can, and his knees are bent at the thirty-degree position that is built into the suit.
121:00:24|ALSJ|LMP|I was trying to get all of my weight on the handle, just to get it to move. Gene was just heavier and could get it to go.
121:00:53|ALSJ||On this stroke, Jack pushes so hard on the handle that his toes come up about a foot off the ground.
121:00:53|ALSJ|LMP|I was putting every bit of weight and momentum into it that I could.
121:01:05|ALSJ||Jack loses his balance and spins to the ground; he kicks the rack again on the way down.
121:01:11|ALSJ|CDR|This part - where Jack spins around and falls ass-over teakettle - was the funniest thing in the world.
121:01:14|ALSJ||Jack is on his hands and knees. Gene grabs hold of the back of his PLSS and tells him to rock back onto his feet.
121:01:17|ALSJ||Jack rocks back on his knees and pushes up with his legs onto his feet, with Gene helping him balance.
121:01:36|ALSJ||They both hold the core, Jack is now effectively falling on the handle to push it down but with his right hand of the core to maintain control. Gene is also holding the core, probably to minimize any lateral stress Jack might put on it. During this interval (about 118:20 on the @alsjurl/a17/a17.mr11_2b.gif"@alsjt>graph</a>), Jack's heart rate peaks at about 135 beats per minute. Throughout the core drilling and extraction, Gene's heart rate has been running over 130 beats, with excursions to 145.
121:01:57|ALSJ||The warning tone raises the possibility that Jack damaged his PLSS when he fell. But he didn't.
121:02:25|ALSJ||After Jack's fourth stroke, they trade places.
121:02:45|ALSJ||Gene kneels west of the core with his thighs about thirty degrees past vertical and over his calves. He has his right hand on the core, which is now out of the ground to waist height, and is working the jack handle with his left hand, leaning to his left with each storke has he was doing before Jack same over to help. Jack is southeast of the core holding it with his right hand and with his right foot on the treadle.
121:03:22|ALSJ||The core is now coming up relatively easily. Gene is making good progress with short, rapid strokes.
121:03:45|ALSJ||Andy Chaikin suggests - and I agree with the suggestion - that Gene's reference is to Apollo 9 crewman Rusty Schweickart. During that mission, Schweickart did an EVA on the LM porch, primarily as a test of the PLSS. During that EVA, his call sign was "Red Rover", a reference to his bright red hair. Here, Gene may have used "Red Rover" without really thinking about his word choice but, then, immediately realized what he'd said and imagined Rusty's reaction.
121:04:23|ALSJ||Gene is referring to the apparent compactness of the soil as a possible explanation of why they didn't seem to kick up much dust during the landing. From the descriptions provided by the various crews during their post-mission technical debriefings, the 14 and 17 crews experienced the smallest amount of dust obscuration and the 12 and 15 crews experienced the most.
121:04:23|ALSJ||Armstrong, from the 31 July 1969 Technical Debrief - "I first noticed that we were, in fact, disturbing the dust on the surface when we were at something less than 100 feet; we were beginning to get a transparent sheet of moving dust that obscured visibility a little bit. As we got lower, the visibility continued to decrease. I don't think that the altitude determination was severely hurt by this blowing dust, but the thing that was confusing to me was that it was hard to pick out what your lateral and downrange velocities were, because you were seeing a lot of moving dust that you had to look through to pick up the stationary rocks and base your translational velocity decisions on that. I found that to be quite difficult. I spent more time trying to arrest translational velocities than I thought would be necessary. As we got below 30 feet or so, I had to select the final touchdown area. For some reason that I am not sure of, we started to pick up left translational velocity and a backward velocity. That's the thing that I certainly didn't want to do, because you don't like to be going backwards, unable to see where you're going. So I arrested the backward rate with some possibly spastic control motions, but I was unable to stop the left translational rate. As we approached the ground, I still had a left translational rate which made me reluctant to shut the engine off while I still had that rate."
121:04:23|ALSJ||Conrad, from the 1 December 1969 Technical Debrief - "As soon as I got the vehicle stopped in horizontal velocity at 300 feet, we picked up a tremendous amount of dust; much more than I had expected. I could see the boulders through the dust, but the dust went as far as I could see in any direction and completely obliterated craters and anything else. All I knew was there was ground underneath that dust. I had no problem with the dust determining horizontal or lateral velocities, but I couldn't tell what was underneath me. I knew I was in a generally good area and that I was just going to have to bite the bullet and land, because I couldn't tell whether there was a crater down there or not... (At 100 feet), the dust was bad enough and I could obtain absolutely no attitude reference by looking at the horizon and the LM. I had to use the @alsjurl/alsj-FDAI.html"@alsjt>8-ball</a>. I had attitude excursions in pitch of plus 10 and minus 10 (degrees), which happened while I was looking out the window making sure that the lateral and horizontal velocities were still nulled. I would allow the attitude of the vehicle to change by plus or minus 10 degrees in pitch and not be aware of it, and I had to go back in the cockpit and keep releveling the attitude of the vehicle on the 8-ball. I was on the gauges in the cockpit doing that at the time the Lunar Contact light came on. I had that much confidence in the gauges.
121:04:23|ALSJ||Shepard, from the 17 February 1971 Technical Debrief - "I believe that we had less problems with dust then they've had before. I think it's because, as we comment later on (in the 14 transcript), the surface of the general area in which we landed was less dusty - that is, exclusive of the dust around the rims of craters. The general area appeared to have less dust and we certainly had no problem with dust at touchdown...The dust was obvious, but you could also see the rocks through the dust. We had no problems here."
121:04:23|ALSJ||Mitchell, from the 17 February 1971 Technical Debrief - "I might add that, looking at the film of the descent last night, the dust problem appears a lot worse on the film than it appeared to me out the window. I thought I could see it (the ground) a lot better."
121:04:23|ALSJ||Shepard, from the 17 February 1971 Technical Debrief - "You probably would, in any event, because the camera is only looking at one spot and you don't have the more general feeling that your eyeball gives you.
121:04:23|ALSJ||Mitchell, from the 17 February 1971 Technical Debrief - "Right; but just looking out the window, you can see the dust is not a great problem at all."
121:04:23|ALSJ||Scott, from the 14 August 1971 Technical Debrief - "(At 150 feet) I could see dust - just a slight bit of dust. At about 50 to 60 feet, the total view outside was obscured by dust. It was completely IFR (Instrument Flight Rules). I came into the cockpit and flew with the instruments from there on down...I think if you had to move from one point to another, you could do it quite well. I would recommend maintaining an altitude of at least 150 feet so you don't get into the dust problem. I think dust is going to be variable with landing site."
121:04:23|ALSJ||Young, from the 5 April 1972 Technical Debrief - "From 200 feet on down, I never looked in the cockpit. It was just like flying the @alsjurl/LLTV-952.html"@alsjt>LLTV</a> (Lunar Landing Training Vehicle); your reference is to the ground outside. You had another thing that nobody has ever remarked about before, and that was the (LM) shadow. I really didn't have any doubt in my mind how far above the ground we were with that shadow, coming down. I had no scale of reference to the holes; but, with the shadow out there in front of you and coming down, it really takes all the guesswork out of it. For that kind of Sun angle, if the radar had crumped (failed), I don't think you'd have had a bit of trouble in just going right in and landing just like a helicopter. First, we could see the thing all the way to the ground; second, the shadow was right there to help you out with the rate of descent. When Charlie says (in the transcript) 'you stopped and you're hovering', there wasn't any doubt in my mind that I was hovering. I could look out the window and see that we're hovering just like a helicopter. We were well into the dust - maybe 40 or 50 feet off the ground - when we're doing that."
121:04:23|ALSJ||Duke, from the 5 April 1972 Technical Debrief - "It started at about 80 feet, John."
121:04:23|ALSJ||Young, from the 5 April 1972 Technical Debrief - "Yes, 80 feet. Certainly, it started there and it got a lot worse; but you could still see the rocks all the way to the ground. (You could see) the surface features, even the craters, and with something like that...Which really surprised me. I was expecting two things: either the dust would be so bad we couldn't see anything, or there probably wouldn't be as much dust as there was. Possibly, it's the 15-degree Sun angle that did all that. Because there's certainly plenty of dust down there to blow; and there's nothing thin about the regolith around the LM."
121:04:23|Technical Debrief|CDR|We started to get dust somewhere around 100 feet.
121:04:23|Technical Debrief|LMP|In my window, I didn't see dust until about 60 or 70 feet.
121:04:23|Technical Debrief|CDR|The dust layer was so very thin that I could definitely see through it all the way down. It didn't hamper our operations at all.
121:04:24|ALSJ||Jack has pushed the LSPE button on the back of the Central Station, probably with the UHT.
121:04:51|ALSJ||Gene means they should have used the core stem as the pole for the U.S. flag, because it is so firmly planted. About 8 feet of the stem is now out of the ground.
121:05:42|ALSJ||Jack has collected a rock fragment and has put it in one of the small Teflon bags used to pack individual samples. Each of them is marked - in this case "E-10" - so that there will be no confusion as to which sample was taken where. The checklist calls for Jack and Gene to mount a pack of 20 sample bags on each of their 70-mm cameras when they start preparing for the geology traverse at 121:26:32. In this case, Jack has used one of the @alsjurl/tools/judy79.jpg"@alsjt>"Dixie cup"</a> sample bags described in greater detail at 141:23:00, probably having taken one off of the stack stowed on the geopallet. Sometime in the next few minutes, Jack will mount a @alsjurl/tools/judy82.gif"@alsjt>pack of sample bags</a> on his camera.
121:06:45|ALSJ|LMP|A higher percentage of plagioclase indicates a higher proportion of silica, calcium, and aluminum in the lava. We were looking at relatively coarse-grained rocks formed from an extrusive lava flow and the higher proportion of plagioclase suggests that the flow might have differentiated, with the plagioclase-rich crystals having floated up toward the top of the flow.
121:06:45|ALSJ||Fendell pans away from Gene.
121:07:23|ALSJ||Fendell pans past Gene. The core is now completely out of the ground. Gene mentions his reasons for removing the treadle at 121:14:14 and 121:15:36, albeit not with any great clarity.
121:07:41|ALSJ||The Experiments people in Houston want Fendell to watch Gene.
121:08:31|ALSJ||Gene has just finished the "Deep Core Recover" section of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-21</a>.
121:08:31|ALSJ||Fendell pans past Jack, who is running southeast, away from the Rover.
121:09:03|ALSJ||Because Jack has used one of the Dixie-cup bags, Bob is under the impression that Jack has assembled the @alsjurl/tools/judy80.gif"@alsjt>LRV Sampler</a>.
121:09:12|ALSJ||Fendell returns to Gene, who has picked up the rack and drill. The core is laying in the rack.
121:09:20|ALSJ||The plug would have been inserted into the tube and forced in against the end of the core had the bit end not been full, thereby preventing movement of the core material in the tube and also preventing destruction of evidence of layering.
121:09:23|ALSJ|CDR|I used the drill as a cane so that I didn't have to get all the way down on my knees. Without it, the only way you could get something off the ground was to get down on your knees because you couldn't bend over. But, if you had a short cane like the drill - the drill was probably 12 or 18 inches high - you could lean on it and then reach over with the other hand to pick things up. It's hard for people to understand the kind of problems you had getting up and down, reaching down to pick things up from the ground. On Earth, we take for granted our mobility and our motion capability. Plus we take for granted the full force of gravity. In lunar gravity, when you were leaning on the drill, you don't lose your balance as quickly as you would on Earth, so that was an advantage. But, when you're being held down by Earth gravity, you can handle a lot more torque than you can being held down by one-sixth gravity. It's those kinds of things that made this a difficult task. It was just very difficult to flex that stiff suit.
121:09:23|ALSJ||Gene tries to re-position the drill, but it falls over.
121:09:49|ALSJ||Gene leans onn the drill with his right hand and, without going to his knees, picks up the gold-covered probe with his left hand. He is on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-21</a>.
121:10:02|ALSJ||Gene unwraps the lower section of the probe.
121:10:02|ALSJ|CDR|Remember, this was a disturbed surface, a very beat up area. There were footprints all over. And it was basically all one bland color. I had just drilled the hole a couple of inches in diameter, I'd gone four or five feet away, had come back, and then had to find the hole. If I hadn't left something close to the hole, so I'd know where to look, it probably would have been very difficult to find. You were looking across the entrance to that hole, and you were still looking at the same color in the wall of the hole. The low Sun would give you a shadow close to the top, but you wouldn't have seen that unless you were almost on top of the hole. And I'd drilled the hole in a hummocky crater, a little depression, that had some slopes on it. So, I was afraid of going back and not finding that hole to put the experiment into.
121:10:02|ALSJ|LMP|I'm still amazed that, after everything we did around that hole, that it was still open and that Gene was able to find it. The ground had really gotten chewed up and, by all rights, the hole should have fallen in, at least near the surface.
121:10:11|ALSJ||Bob Parker says that $3.25 was the prevailing per diem rate with government-furnished meals and lodgings.
121:10:37|ALSJ||Gene tries to use the probe to pick up the rammer. He flips the rammer up to head height but gives it enough motion away from himself that it flies almost out of the TV picture. Gene moves forward to retrieve the rammer.
121:11:10|ALSJ||This time, Gene gives the rammer a little inward motion, flipping it upward with the probe in his right hand. This time, the T-shaped head of the rammer hooks on the probe tip and he catches it with his left hand. He then hangs the rammer on the rack and activates the lower section of the probe. In brief, the neutron probe consists of targets containing either boron or uranium-235 which, upon capturing neutrons, emit alpha particles or fission fragments which are then captured by plastic or mica detectors. The instrument consists of an outer tube containing the detectors and a central core containing the targets. Because the targets and detectors do not cover the whole surfaces of the core and tube, respectively, the core can be twisted so that the target/detector pairs are either next to each other or 180 degrees apart. In the latter case, very few alpha particles or fission fragments are captured by the detectors and, therefore, the instrument is "off".
121:11:19|ALSJ|LMP|An alignment of elongated minerals such as plagioclase or pyroxene is called a lineation, and generally indicates that there has been a flow or some stress in the direction of alignment. The term 'foliation' is usually reserved for a situation where the orientation of tabular minerals creates a planar variation in the rock. A 'parting' indicates how the rock breaks, usually along foliation planes.
121:11:19|ALSJ||Gene is doing some detailed finger work on the neutron probe.
121:13:10|ALSJ|LMP|In molten rock, vesicles usually start out being roughly spherical in shape but, once the rock has solidified, if it stays warm for long enough, there will be a tendency for crystals to grow and destroy the smoothly spherical outline. If the rock cools slowly enough, the vesicles would start to look like 'vugs', with the crystals growing right into the void.
121:13:10|ALSJ||Gene removes the top section of the probe from its sheath and threads it into the lower section.
121:13:16|ALSJ||Jack's sample is too big for the scoop. He has taken photos AS17-136- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20714"@alsjt>20714</a> thru @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20717"@alsjt>20717</a>. Gene uses the probe to pick up the empty sheath, and then lays the sheath on the rack.
121:14:00|ALSJ||The neutron probe is a self-contained unit and, among other things, has no cable connecting it to electronics on the surface, a cable that would prevent the probe from falling out of reach to the bottom of the core hole. At the end of the third EVA, Jack will return to the ALSEP site and retrieve the probe so that he and Gene can bring it back to Earth for analysis.
121:14:14|ALSJ||Gene may mean that, after he got the core out of the hole, he tried to push the jack handle into its shortened, stowage position and couldn't. However, the problems he foresaw in emplacing the probe through the treadle aren't apparent.
121:14:33|ALSJ||Gene uses the probe to pick up the treadle.
121:15:08|ALSJ||Gene uses the jack handle to position the treadle over the hole but doesn't yet set it on the ground. He puts the probe through the hole in the treadle and then puts the tip of the probe in the hole and lowers it about a foot or so without lowering the treadle. He then drops the treadle to the ground and, finally, he lets go of the probe, which falls into the hole until the top catches on the treadle.
121:15:27|ALSJ|LMP|As I remember, Captain Marvel, the comic book hero, was a handicapped newspaper boy who, when he said 'Shazam', turned into Captain Marvel.
121:15:42|ALSJ||Apparently, with the handle upright, the opening through the treadle has an elongated shape. However, the probe was able to fall through until the top caught.
121:15:44|ALSJ||Gene covers the top of the probe with the gold sheath. This task is the last one on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-21</a>. Next, he will carry the deep core to the Rover for disassembly as per @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-22</a>
121:15:46|ALSJ||Bob asks the Flight Director for a briefing on the EVA plan.
121:16:05|ALSJ|CDR|It was a lot of hard work; and it was very satisfying to get it done.
121:16:05|ALSJ||Here, Jack is using one of the flat sample bags, suggesting that, although page @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-24</a> calls for Gene to mount packs of bags on the cameras during the upcoming geo-prep period, Jack already has a pack on his camera. At 121:26:54, he indicates that he had mounted a pack on his camera sometime prior to that time. Jack takes a stereopair of this sample location, AS17-136- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20718"@alsjt>20718</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20719"@alsjt>20719</a>.
121:16:05|ALSJ|LMP|The @alsjurl/tools/judy83.jpg"@alsjt>sample bags</a> were reasonably clear Teflon, with a little metal double-spring that held the lip open a little bit. They also had tabs on either end, and what you could do was push against those tabs to open it up even more, get your sample in it, and then pull them closed and then twist the tabs down. It wasn't a vacuum seal but it wasn't a bad mechanical seal to keep the sample from falling out.
121:16:22|ALSJ||Fendell pans clockwise, away from Gene.
121:16:57|ALSJ||They will actually have a 7 hour, 12 minute EVA. The workload and, consequently, the oxygen use rate will drop significantly once they start the traverse. Station 1 was to have been a stop at the east rim of Emory Crater, an impact feature 650 m in diameter. Fendell pans past Jack, who is returning to the Rover from the south, scoop in hand.
121:17:44|ALSJ||Gene is on checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-22</a> and is about to separate and cap the core sections for transport back to Earth.
121:17:58|ALSJ||A number of boulders on the west rim of Steno could be seen in blow-ups of pictures taken from the Apollo 15 Command Module. These are indicated by X's in the traverse map. Readers might want to note that Geophone Rock, which is near the planned landing site, was not noticed in the Apollo 15 pictures. The boulders at Steno can be seen in the accompanying blow-up of the relevant section of a frame taken with the Pan camera aboard the Apollo 17 Command Module.
121:18:24|ALSJ||Jack will get a surface soil sample from the deep core site while Gene separates the sections of core stem for later packing. Gene will put the core in a small vise mounted on the top of the geopallet and use the wrench to twist off one core section at a time.
121:18:24|ALSJ||Jack's photo of the deep core hole and the associated hardware is AS17-136- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20720"@alsjt>20720</a>.
121:18:36|ALSJ||The surgeon reports to the Flight Director that, during the first four hours of the EVA, Gene's average metabolic rate has been 1170 BTU/hr and Jack's 1120. These compare with the predicted averages of 1050.
121:19:14|ALSJ||Fendell finds Jack, who is sampling near the core hole.
121:20:08|ALSJ||Experiments wants to continue watching Gene. So, Fendell leaves Jack and pans clockwise, looking for Gene. He has to pan through almost a complete, 360 degree circle.
121:20:38|ALSJ||Contrary to his statement, Jack apparently took a single "before" picture of the sample site. The "before" and "after" pictures are AS17-136- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20721"@alsjt>20721</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20722"@alsjt>20722</a>, respectively.
121:21:42|ALSJ||Gene is referring to the vise/wrench. Fendell finds him at the back of the Rover, using the wrench to turn a stem section. It detaches very easily.
121:21:55|ALSJ||This is the so-called "Dixie cup" sampler consisting of a @alsjurl/tools/judy80.gif"@alsjt>UHT fitted into a holder for a stack of cup-shaped sample bags</a>. The sampler will allow Jack to collect rock fragments and soil during the Rover drive without dismounting. NASA Photo <a href="ap17-KSC-72PC-411.jpg"@alsjt>KSC-72PC-411</a> shows Jack examining the LRV sampler during a final, suited check of the Rover prior stowage on the LM.
121:21:55|ALSJ||Jack has returned to the Rover, carrying one of the two UHTs. He goes to the gate where he will get the cup holder for attachment to the UHT. Jack had planned to assemble the LRV sampler at the top of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-22</a> before deploying the geophones.
121:22:19|ALSJ||Gene is expressing his heartfelt relief that the drilling job is done. He puts a cap on the core section and hammers it on with his glove.
121:22:46|ALSJ||Gene removes the wrench and takes the core section to Jack's seat so that he can get it out of the way.
121:23:08|ALSJ||Gene returns to the vise and puts a cap on the now open end of the core.
121:23:53|ALSJ||Gene takes the core to Jack's seat. A @alsjurl/a17/a17drinkdet.jpg"@alsjt>detail</a> from a training photo by Ed Dempsey shows the position of Gene Cernan's drink valve and food stick.
121:24:00|ALSJ|CDR|Maybe we were 30 minutes late, but at least we got the job done and we got it done right. I think that was the feeling we had. A feeling of satisfaction. That's what we went up there to do during that period of time and we did it. It was a lot of work, probably more work than people anticipated because we ran into problems in getting the core out, but we got it all done.
121:24:00|ALSJ|LMP|I was not quite so satisfied as Gene was at this point because of the time we were losing for exploration. The difference was natural. Gene was very pleased with having gotten the ALSEP properly deployed, while I was concerned that we hadn't spent much time yet learning about the Moon.
121:24:00|ALSJ||Gene is sounding livelier than he had while he was struggling with the drilling and the core extraction.
121:24:00|ALSJ||Cernan -"If you expend energy at a high rate and you're not careful, frustration can set in. Fortunately, when I was a little kid, I used to work with my dad in building things: rebuilding automobile engines, building garages, fixing plumbing, or whatever it was. These kinds of things were fundamental things to me. My dad used to always say, "Do it right, or not at all." And it certainly applied to what we we're doing here, because we only had one chance to do it.
121:24:17|ALSJ||Gene consults his checklist. He is about finished with @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-22</a>. Readers who have been following along in the checklists should note that @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-23</a> is a duplicate of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-25</a>, the ALSEP photo plan.
121:24:35|ALSJ||Jack hasn't gotten the LRV sampler attached properly to the UHT. During the following exchange, Jack asks Gene to grab the sampler head and pull it off - with Jack still holding on to the UHT - so that they can get it properly aligned.
121:24:56|ALSJ||Jack returns to the gate.
121:24:57|ALSJ||Gene goes to the rear of the Rover to read the gravimeter. For this reading, he had not taken the instrument off the Rover.
121:25:26|ALSJ||Gene was supposed to have punched the Grav button when he was at the Rover getting the treadle. That was on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-21</a> and, in his eagerness to get the core out of the ground, he forgot to do that task. See Gene's further comment below at 121:35:53.
121:25:53|ALSJ||Jack is working at Gene's seat.
121:25:58|ALSJ||The Surface Electrical Properties Experiment (SEP, usually pronounced "Sep") measured variations in the conductivity of near surface materials and gives an indication of the subsurface geologic structure. It consists of an antenna, receiver, and data recorder mounted behind Jack's seat and a transmitter and associated antenna which they will deploy 150 meters east of the LM. As soon as they finish with the ALSEP deployment and their preparations for the geology traverse, Jack will run back to the LM, get the SEP transmitter, and then will carry it out to the deployment site. After the geology traverse, they will then deploy the transmitter and lay out the transmitter antenna.
|ALSJ||They are both now at the back of the Rover. They are about to prepare for the geology traverse. Details of the Geo Prep are on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-26</a> and @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-24</a>.
121:26:50|ALSJ||They each have a pocket on their right shin and on their left thigh.
121:26:57|ALSJ||The sample bags come in bundles of twenty which are hung from hooks at the bottom of the 70-mm cameras. That way, the bags were always in easy reach. The sample bags have been stowed in Sample Collection Bag (SCB) number one. The SCBs are much larger bags made of laminated Teflon cloth and are each 42 cm high, 22 cm wide, and 15 cm deep. Each of the astronauts will wear one on his PLSS. After a sample is sealed in one of the small, clear Teflon bags, they will put it in one or the other of the SCBs. Gene swings the gate closed; from the perspective of the TV camera, the top of it is about level with the top of his helmet.
121:26:59|ALSJ||Gene goes to his seat, carrying a packet of sample bags. The gnomon is on his seat.
121:27:29|ALSJ||The fact that both @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-24</a> and @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-26</a> have handwritten notes about the gnomon suggests that Jack forgot it more than once during training.
121:27:29|ALSJ||The cover gloves are dark brown from the impregnating dust. To prepare the gnomon for stowage, Gene grasps the legs which, rather like umbrella stays, collapse onto the central axis. He then puts the gnomon in its stowage sheath behind his seat.
121:27:45|ALSJ|CDR|The cover gloves had fingers that were cut out, rather like a golf glove. They went over the regular glove and covered the palms. Because of all of the drilling and such, we just wanted to put a little more protection on our regular gloves. We were only going to use them for the first EVA, because that's where all the manual labor was; the rest was all traverse work. You've seen how hard we worked with those things up to this point; and they were just ripped up and torn up and really battered. Most of the damage was a result of abrasion.
121:27:47|ALSJ||Gene has decided not to discard the cover gloves until, once back in the LM, he's had a chance to examine his suit gloves for wear. Jack is at his own seat, fiddling with his camera.
121:28:22|ALSJ||Gene is taking a core cap dispenser from SCB-1 - in which the sample bags had also been stored - and will put the dispenser in a storage slot on the gate. These are caps for short core tubes - called "drive tubes" - which they will hammer into the ground at several of the geology stops.
121:28:49|ALSJ||Jack removes his camera from the bracket on his chest and stows it under his seat.
121:29:06|ALSJ||That is, Gene will put equipment on Jack's PLSS.
121:29:13|ALSJ||Jack goes to the gate.
121:29:22|ALSJ||Gene starts working on the left side of Jack's PLSS. Training photo @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#72H1226"@alsjt>72-H-1226</a> shows Gene securing the rammer.
121:29:47|ALSJ||@alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-24</a> calls for Gene to mount both the hammer and the rammer on Jack's PLSS, but he has decided to keep the hammer handy in his shin pocket. The rammer is a short, thin rod used to seat plugs in the drive tubes.
121:29:49|ALSJ||Jack hands the rammer to Gene.
121:29:53|ALSJ||Jack is probably thinking about getting a sample of one of the boulders. Only Gene's camera is loaded with color film. See the discussion following 120:54:26.
121:30:03|ALSJ||Because the Earth turns under the Moon in a little more than 24 hours, no one tracking station can keep continuous contact with the crew. There are three principle tracking stations - Goldstone, California, @alsjurl/MDSCC.html"@alsjt>Madrid</a>, Spain, and Honeysuckle Creek, Australia - which swap every eight hours or so. At this moment - about 10:23 p.m. Central Standard Time, December 11, 1972 - the Moon is about to set at Goldstone and the handover is to Honeysuckle.
121:30:03|ALSJ||A Starry Night @alsjurl/a17/a17handover12130.jpg"@alsjt>view of Earth</a> ( 0423 GMT 12 December ) shows that Australia has rotated into view. The Moon rose at Honeysuckle about 2 hours ago.
121:30:03|ALSJ|LMP|Usually we wouldn't have noticed a handover. The one we did notice came right at lift-off from the Moon when they didn't get the handover done right away and we got a lot of static on the comm. They could hear us but we couldn't hear them.
121:30:03|ALSJ||As is discussed at 188:01:28, the initial comm loss at launch was actually due to the LM engine plume and, unfortunately, the operators at Goldstone waited far longer than was necessary to re-acquire the spacecraft.
121:30:09|ALSJ||Jack turns 180 degrees so that Gene can mount SCB-2 on the right side of his PLSS. This will put the SCB outboard when Jack is seated on the Rover. The spare SCBs are stowed, folded and strapped, on the rear-facing surface of the geopallet, inside the gate.
121:30:19|ALSJ||Gene notices the TV pointed at them.
121:30:36|ALSJ||As a result of problems experienced with John Young's SCB during Apollo 16, the attachment system was re-designed. At various times during Apollo 17, one or the other of the SCBs will come loose, an indication that the re-design was not adequate.
121:30:53|ALSJ||Gene adjusts the lower right strap on Jack's PLSS.
121:30:55|ALSJ||Jack turns around and presents the left side of his PLSS.
121:30:57|ALSJ||Jack presents the right side again.
121:31:14|ALSJ||Gene gets an SCB from the gate and attaches it, top and bottom, to Jack's PLSS.
121:31:17|ALSJ||As noted previously, Gene has put the hammer in his own shin pocket, rather than mounting the hammer on Jack's PLSS.
121:31:47|ALSJ||Jack goes to his seat. The @alsjurl/tools/judy91.jpg"@alsjt>long can</a> is about 18 inches long and 3 inches in diameter. Later in the mission, at Station 3, Gene will seal one of the drive tube sections in the long can, protecting it from cabin gases or exposure to the Earth's atmosphere. Note that, in addition to the long can, Jack's camera will be stowed under his seat while he runs back to the LM with the deep core.
121:31:55|ALSJ||The Moon will set at Goldstone in California in about an hour. Comm will now go thru Honeysuckle Creek near Canberra, Australia.
121:31:58|ALSJ||Jack returns to the gate.
121:32:17|ALSJ||They move to the left rear of the Rover. Jack has SCB-1 to attach to the left side of Gene's PLSS.
121:32:19|ALSJ|LMP|With my camera off, I could get close enough to Gene to attach the SCB easily. With the camera sticking out a foot or so, you had to work at arm's length.
121:32:29|ALSJ||That is, Houston had revised the list of photographic tasks.
121:32:37|ALSJ||Jack's checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-22</a> gave him the option of configuring the @alsjurl/a17/tools/judy80.gif"@alsjt>LRV Sampler</a> when he went back to the Rover after deploying the LSPE antenna at about 120:10. Had he done the task then, he would have used Gene's UHT, keeping his own for the Geophone deployment. His second option (on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-26</a> was to assemble the Sampler at the start of the Geo Prep, which he did at 121:21:55. Because he was done with his UHT, he used it as the Sampler handle rather than using Gene's.
121:32:55|ALSJ||Gene bends his knees, keeping his PLSS vertical.
121:32:55|ALSJ||The SCB is about the length of Gene's upper arm, has a square cross section six inches on a side, and has sharp creases which will disappear with use. Jack's comment that 'those hooks weren't designed for new bags' indicates that, while they worked well for the well-worn bags used during training, the stiff, fresh bags are harder to secure.
121:33:34|ALSJ||Jack goes to the gate; Gene to the heat flow site.
121:33:37|ALSJ||Gene is no longer talking loudly to Houston when he is at the Rover and only increases volume a little when he moves away from the Rover.
121:33:37|ALSJ|LMP|Part of this business about talking more loudly to Houston may be psychological distance; but I also notice that, when I'm describing something to them, I get more of an authoritarian tone. Certainly, when we were talking with each other, it was more buddy to buddy and we wouldn't have been thinking about anybody being a long way away.
121:34:07|ALSJ||Gene executes a flat throw; the UHT flies off, parallel to the ground, with no discernible rotation.
121:34:12|ALSJ||@alsjurl/Fendell-Bio.pdf"@alsjt>Fendell</a> pans away.
121:34:38|ALSJ||Jack, also, is no longer talking loudly to Houston. He probably leaves for the LM at this point. He is at the top of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-27</a>. After Gene takes care of a few housekeeping chores, he will be at the top of @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-25</a>. Journal Contributor Lennie Waugh noted that Jack's more-or-less-direct path back to the LM can be seen in a @alsjurl/a17/a17.ascent1.jpg"@alsjt>frame</a> (scan by Brian McInall) from the 16-mm camera mounted in his window during lift-off. The initial path Jack took out to the ALSEP site is south (left) of the return path, as in an alternately labeled @alsjurl/a17/a17.ascent2.jpg"@alsjt>version</a> by Waugh. Waugh has also assembled a post-EVA-3 window @alsjurl/a17/as17-22199-201.jpg"@alsjt>mini-pan</a> showing the two sets of tracks. A @alsjurl/a17/as17-22199-201lbl.jpg"@alsjt>labeled version</a> is also available.
121:35:10|ALSJ||Fendell finds Jack running toward the LM. The Rover seems noticeably higher than the LM. However, Jack is down in the swale and that may be helping to create the impression.
121:35:27|ALSJ||That is, they are hearing themselves in the earphones after the communications has made the two-and-a-half-second round trip to Earth and back. As Jack runs, splashes of light are visible at his feet. The effect is due to sunlight reflecting off sprays of dust that he kicks up as he runs. The best example of this is in the TV coverage of Gene running toward the Rover, from the east, just before they leave Shorty Crater on EVA-2.
121:36:05|ALSJ|LMP|We had worked hard, and our fingers, our hands, and our arms were very tired. But it was still fun. And, without the aches in our arms and hands, it would have been even more fun.
121:36:05|ALSJ||The song "While Strolling through the Park One Day" was written by Ed Haley in 1884.
121:36:13|ALSJ|LMP|All this singing that I was doing illustrates that it was possible to run in the suit without expending a lot of effort. By using what can be described as a cross-country-skiing stride, I was keeping changes in the suit volume to a minimum. I was moving my legs back and forth, but that was about it.
121:36:13|ALSJ||A re-design of the waist joint - done so that the J-mission crews could sit on the Rover - made a big difference in running efficiency. The Apollo 12 crew ran a distance of a few hundred feet at a speed of 5 - 6 kph and had to take a rest because their heart rates got up in the 160 beat/minute range. They also got a bit winded. It is important to note, however, that they, too, used a loping, foot-to-foot stride. By the time Jack reaches the SEP site at the end of this run, his heart rate will peak at @alsjurl/a17/a17.mr11_2b.gif"@alsjt>130 beats per minute</a>.
121:36:17|ALSJ||That is, he won't dust the TV.
121:36:30|ALSJ||Gene swings the TV camera around so that it points aft. Jack has not yet reached the LM. He started running at about 121:34:38 and has covered something less than the 180 meters between the Rover parking place and the LM in two minutes. Therefore, his average, straight-line speed, is no more than 5.4 kilometers per hour, the speed he achieved on the 50 meter run from the west geophone at 120:27:11.
121:36:41|ALSJ||TV off.
121:37:04|ALSJ||The yo-yo is a tool holder that Gene is wearing on the front of his suit, below the RCU and camera bracket. It consists of a length of wire, wound on a spring-operated reel, and a clip which Gene is attaching to his tongs. If Gene wants to use the tongs, he will just grab the handle and pull them away from his body, unreeling the yo-yo wire. When he is done, he can release the tongs and let the spring rewind the wire and pull the tongs back against his suit. Jack is wearing a yo-yo but has chosen not to wear his tongs. His usual tool will be the scoop and it cannot be attached to the tongs because the extension handle is too big around to fit into the clip.
121:37:09|ALSJ||Magazine Bravo is Apollo magazine 134. Gene is finishing up the last items on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-24</a>.
121:37:50|ALSJ||They are 277 minutes into the EVA with 36% oxygen left. At this rate, they would have a 433 minute EVA with no reserves. The EVA actually ends at 432 minutes, but with reserves to about 540 minutes.
121:38:10|ALSJ||Jack is referring to a rock next to the ladder footpad that he mentioned in his commentary following @alsjurl/a17/a17.1ststep.html#1171611"@alsjt>117:16:11</a>. As per his cuff checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17.eva1_lmp27.gif"@alsjt>LMP-27</a>, when Jack left the ALSEP deploymant site, he was carrying the core stems and layed them on the plus-Z struts before going around to @alsjurl/a17/a17flsp-f3.6-1.jpg"@alsjt>Quad III</a> to offload the SEP transmitter. Jack may be thinking of the footpad as the first step up to the porch.
121:39:22|ALSJ||Station 6, on the lower slope of the North Massif, will be the first stop on EVA-3. The position of the Station 6 boulders is best shown in AS17-141- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21550"@alsjt>21550</a>, taken during the drive to Station 6. Station 6 is about 550 meters east and 170 meters downslope from the very large, dark boulder with the prominent track. That boulder is quite a way up the slope of the North Massif on the left side of the picture. Turning Point Rock, which they will drive to on their way to Station 6, is above the TV camera, and Station 6 is to the right, with an elevation about midway between those of the dark boulder and Turning Point Rock.
121:39:37|ALSJ||Emory Crater is 650 meters in diameter and is located at the southern edge of the apparent dark-mantle area of the valley. Indeed, from overhead photography, it appeared in pre-mission analyses that only part of the crater is covered with the mantle. Therefore, a visit to Emory promised clues as to the origin of the mantle. In addition, there were indications that the crater might have penetrated through the valley fill and dug up samples of the original valley floor, materials presumably similar to those making up the Massifs. However, evidence from the seismic profiling experiment and from the Command Module radar experiment suggest that the valley fill is about two kilometers deep. Because Emory would have penetrated only to a depth of about 150 to 200 meters, the possibility that Emory penetrated through the valley fill now seems unlikely.
121:41:19|ALSJ||The Sun-Shadow Device is mounted on the Rover console, and is usually folded down against the panel for storage. To use the device, Gene raises the arm until it extends out from the panel at a 90 degree angle. When the Rover is headed to within 15 degrees of down-Sun, a gnomon on the end of the arm casts a shadow on a scale affixed to the panel. During the last minute or so, Gene maneuvered the Rover until the shadow gave a zero reading. Because the position of the Sun in the local sky is known accurately, by using this procedure, Gene has put the Rover on a well-determined, true heading of 279 degrees (9 degrees north of west). He will now "torque" or precess the gyro until the heading indicator reads 279.
121:41:37|ALSJ||The Rover Navigation system has not yet been initialized on the Moon, so the heading of 234 may be a value preset prior to launch from Earth, possibly with some drift introduced during the flight and during deployment. Details of the Nav initialization are given on a decal on the Rover, rather than in Gene's checklist.
121:41:50|ALSJ||Gene is waiting a minute and a half for the Nav system to power-up.
121:42:38|ALSJ||At the end of the EVA, Gene and Jack will lay out a cross-shaped antenna pattern for the SEP experiment. Jack is actually about 140 meters east of the LM. @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-27</a> has a handwritten note "Thumb=350'", a reminder, perhaps, that when Jack is 350 feet from the LM, his thumb will just cover the spacecraft when held at arm's length.
121:42:45|ALSJ||The SEP, like many other pieces of equipment, has a short, shadow-throwing gnomon and an angular scale for orientation relative to the Sun.
121:43:20|ALSJ||Jack will deploy the solar panels after the geology traverse.
121:43:44|ALSJ||Gene had to point the Rover west in order to initialize the navigation system; he now turns east, into the Sun.
121:44:20|ALSJ||The Rover uses an internal navigation system which depends counts of wheel rotation to meaure distance traveled and, when combined with heading information provided by a directional gyro, calculates the range and bearing to the last initialization point. During the Apollo 15 and Apollo 16 traverses, the system was shown to be accurate to about 100 to 200 meters over distances of a few kilometers.
121:44:20|ALSJ|LMP|There were times when NASA would talk about us having trouble getting back to the LM; and that was ludicrous. We would always know where the LM was in a valley with as many distinctive features as this one had. And, of course, you could always follow your tracks back. So the safety aspects of Rover navigation were always exaggerated. The Nav system may have been included originally in the Rover design for safety reasons; but, once we had it, its prime usefulness was clearly in position location, in finding our way from the LM to the various geology stations.
121:44:26|ALSJ||These Rover readouts will give a first estimate of the ALSEP location until a much more accurate determination can be made from the photographs of the LM taken from the ALSEP site and of the ALSEP taken from the LM windows. Because the sizes of these man-made objects are very accurately known, measurements of the photographic images directly give distances. The task of reporting range and bearing to the ALSEP from the LM are on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-25</a>.
121:44:26|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Marv Hein notes that, in real time, it should have been possible to estimate the LM ALSEP distance from the TV images.
121:44:50|ALSJ||That is, Houston is picking up signals going from the backpacks to the LM and then to Earth, rather than through the low-gain antenna.
121:44:50|ALSJ|LMP|It may have been that there were different frequencies for transmissions to Earth through the LM and the Rover low-gain transmitter. But, whatever the details, the decision as to which to use was Houston's; we had no control or influence over that, except for pointing the low-gain antenna.
121:45:43|ALSJ||Throughout the mission, Jack uses the term 'subfloor' and by it, means the valley-filling material underlying the regolith and the presumed dark mantle. To the uninitiated, 'subfloor' would seem a more natural name for the original floor, the material that was overlain by the lava fill; however, this is not the meaning of the term as used here.
121:45:43|ALSJ|LMP|I never liked the term 'subfloor'. It was something that had come out of the US Geological Survey, from the lunar mapping people, and it had always seemed contrived.
121:45:45|ALSJ||That is, the ALSEP is 22 degrees north of west from LM and at a range of 0.2 kilometers. Gene has driven 0.2 kilometers since leaving the ALSEP. The three-digit range indicator changes from 001 to 002 at a range of 150 meters and the distance indicator changes to 002 at 200 meters. The formal indication is, then, that the LM is between 200 and 250 meters from the ALSEP. Because Gene has not driven in a straight line, the distance reading should be reduced by about ten percent. The actual range of the LM from the ALSEP is about 185 meters. Because Gene had parked the Rover 60 feet (20 meters) northeast of the Central Station, the Rover-LM distance was about 180 meters, which agrees nicely with the 180 - 250 meter range indicated by the Nav system.
121:46:06|ALSJ|LMP|I wasn't actually looking at rocks at this point because, as I remember, there weren't any at the SEP site much over fist size. This was just a chance, while I was working on the SEP, for me to regurgitate some observations I'd made up to this point. When I said that 'We may not be down to the subfloor', I think I meant that I hadn't seen anything yet that wasn't recycled regolith.
121:46:27|ALSJ||The terrain around the LM is rather flat and a speed of 10 km/hr - about 10 minutes to the mile - doesn't seem impressive. However, when they get out into rolling terrain, with the potential of finding small, deep craters to jar the Rover just over every ridge, the ride gets a bit more exciting.
121:46:27|ALSJ|CDR|The Rover just didn't move very fast. It wasn't made to go very fast, but it could sure save a lot of energy. You could pack a lot of gear and save a lot of walking time, and it allowed us to cover territory and ground we never would have covered otherwise. I think probably we averaged 8-12 kilometers (per hour), and I think we hit a speed record of 14-15 kilometers coming downhill. It had four electric motors, one on each wheel for redundancy, and we would run with all four motors all the time. We didn't necessarily use both fore and aft steering all the time, but we always ran all four motors and 8-12 kilometers was about as fast as it could go. Your sensation of speed is probably what you would get down here. It didn't seem like you were moving very fast, and you really weren't. But you were moving, and it was nice to just sit back there and relax as you went from one place to another, as slow as it might seem. We weren't on a 400 mile trip, so it didn't matter how fast it was.
121:46:27|ALSJ|CDR|Of course, it could still be very sporty driving. When you start getting one wheel in a crater, or you hit a bump, or you start driving on the side of a hill, you really do appreciate the one-sixth gravity. If you hit a bump, you'd go u-u-u-u-p and come down. It wouldn't just be bing-bang, up and down. And on the side of a hill, you would start thinking that the Rover was just going to tip over and fall over on you. You didn't feel like there's much holding you to the surface at all. It was good, sporty driving; just not very fast.
121:46:27|ALSJ|CDR|The Rover had great maneuverability, particularly with the fore and aft steering - articulated steering, I guess it is. You could really maneuver it, really turn very sharp. You couldn't go real fast, but you could go. There is some film of John Young where he was kicking up dust and you'd think he was going 50 mph. He probably was going 10-12 kilometers at the most. On the lunar surface, it's a sporty little ride. It was fun.
121:46:27|ALSJ|CDR|I don't know how fast you would really want to go up there, quite frankly. You can't see what's up ahead of you too well. You know, you're driving along and it's so bland. With the shadows the way they are, especially if you're looking into the Sun, you just can't see much. You can't see where those holes are; you can't see what's ahead of you, and the next thing you know, wow, you're in a hole or you're up. You'll see us reacting to the little craters throughout here as we drive the Rover.
121:46:27|ALSJ|LMP|I'm quite certain that, even at 10 kilometers per hour, there were times when we had all four wheels off the ground. That really made it sporty. And the worst direction to drive in, I thought, was away from the Sun, because you had a 'white out' situation. The lack of shadows made it hard even to see boulders. But, the glare off your visors did make up-Sun difficult.
121:47:12|ALSJ||The actual range is about 330 meters from the ALSEP and about 140 meters from the LM.
121:47:30|ALSJ|CDR|The needle width was at least a couple of degrees, so there was a little hesitation here as I decided what figure to give.
121:48:04|ALSJ||Gene is re-initializing the Rover navigation system.
121:48:21|ALSJ||Jack will soon regret having ignored Bob's advice about not carrying a charge during the drive. Checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-27</a> calls for Jack to carry a charge, but only because he was to have deployed it near Steno during the planned drive to Emory. According to the original plan, Gene would have stopped the Rover long enough for Jack, without getting out of the Rover, to put the charge on the ground. As Jack will discover, holding the charge will tire his hands, unnecessarily in this case.
121:48:25|ALSJ|LMP|During training, Bob liked to use the term 'bomb' and, here, I'm trying to get him to change it.
121:48:28|ALSJ||Bob is saying again that Jack doesn't need to carry the charge.
121:48:40|ALSJ||A map of the planned traverse is shown on both @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-28</a> and @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-26</a>. South is up, on these maps, and the unboxed numbers associated with each traverse segment are a heading and segment length. The boxed numbers associated with the turning points are bearing and range to the nominal SEP transmitter location. Because the navigation system gives the Rover's position relative to the initialization point at the SEP transmitter - then, to the extent that the absolute location of the SEP is known, the heading and range indications can be used to find the planned geology stations. With practice and a good map, visual navigation is sometimes possible, but the undulating terrain, combined with the basic problem of estimating sizes and distances, makes the navigation instruments invaluable. At this point in the mission, the location of the LM and, therefore, of the SEP transmitter has not yet been pinned down and there will be some confusion. Based on the crew's site descriptions from the LM window, Houston is estimating that, at the west rim of Steno, the bearing to the SEP transmitter will be 340 degrees (twenty degrees west of north) and the range 1.2 kilometers. Relative to the actual SEP location, the bearing and range at the west rim of Steno is 352/1.5. Because of this fairly substantial difference, they will end up stopping just short of the northwest rim. Boulders are of interest since they are likely to be samples of the subfloor. Boulders that could be picked out in the Apollo 15 photographs are marked with crosses. Checklist pages @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-29</a> and @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-27</a> give details of the planned traverse. Pages @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-30</a> and @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-28</a> are identical and show a schematic of Emory Crater and the original site of Station 1.
121:49:26|ALSJ||They are planning to drive into the Sun until they come abeam of the northeast corner of Trident and then will turn south toward Steno. Gene is hoping that, during the first part of the drive, he can clear up his residual doubts about where he's landed. He actually is, of course, about 100 meters north of Poppie rather than West Trident.
121:49:39|ALSJ||This is Jack's first Rover ride of the mission and his first attempt to climb aboard. Ken Glover has produced a @alsjurl/a17/a17jacksits.rm"@alsjt>video clip</a> of Jack mounting the Rover onboard the 1/6th-g airplane.
121:50:32|ALSJ||The seat belts had been a problem on Apollo 15 because no allowance had been made for the fact that, on the Moon, the suits don't compress as much when the astronauts are seated as they do on Earth. The problem was easily fixed for Apollos 16 and 17.
121:50:44|ALSJ|CDR|Best way to get in was to face out from the Rover, sit in the seat, get down, and then kick your feet up and then throw them around. Here, Jack probably faced front, then tried to get one leg up and then another leg up. By starting out facing out from the Rover, you also cut down on the amount of dust you scattered on things.
121:50:44|ALSJ|LMP|What I ended up doing most of the time was standing at the side of the Rover, facing front, and jumping, more or less straight up and over toward the seat; and then rotated my feet up and forward so that I came down in the seat.
121:50:44|ALSJ||There is good TV coverage of Jack's attempt to mount the Rover at the end of Station 3 at 145:03:17.
121:50:46|ALSJ||Jack has finally realized that there is no reason to carry the charge; it could have been left in its transporter on the back of the Rover. He is probably already noticing his hands getting tired from having to keep them closed around the charge against the pressure of the suit. He is probably also becoming aware that the charge is keeping him from using his maps and checklist efficiently.
121:50:46|ALSJ||NASA photo @alsjurl/a17/ap17-KSC-72PC-436.jpg"@alsjt>KSC-72PC-436</a> shows the crew posing for a portrait on the 1-g trainer and the charge transporter and some mock-up charges can be seen mounted on top of the geopallet behind Gene's seat.
121:50:46|ALSJ||Although Jack's page @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-29</a> indicates that he hadn't planned to take any pictures during the drive, he will take a total of sixteen frames, beginning with AS17-136- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20723"@alsjt>20723</a>, an up-Sun picture taken about now. The next two frames, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20724"@alsjt>20724</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20725"@alsjt>20725</a> are mostly blocked by the traverse map. Notice that, in all three frames, the camera is tilted down to the right and, because this is true for almost all of Jack's EVA-1 traverse photos, I conclude that either he was sitting tilted to the right and/or his camera was tilted.
121:50:46|ALSJ||All the frames Jack and Gene take during the drive to Station 1 are displayed in the PDF document ( @alsjurl/a17/a17trvLM-Sta1.pdf"@alsjt>16 Mb</a> ).
121:51:20|ALSJ||Jack is misreading the @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-28</a> map showing the planned traverse path from the landing site to Emory. Because the traverse is merely being truncated and they think they have landed virtually at the planned point, they plan to follow the checklist and drive east on a heading of 116 (ESE) for 600 meters to get around the east side of Trident and then turn south to a heading of 181 for the drive to the west rim of Steno. The planned bearing and range at the turning point are 296/0.5.
121:52:10|ALSJ|CDR|When you're riding and not expending a lot of energy, it's a lot easier to look around and really see what's there.
121:52:20|ALSJ|CDR|We probably ran smack into a small crater - or maybe a boulder - that we couldn't see facing east and looking right into the Sun. And when I said, 'got it, got it' I meant I had the situation under control. Running into little craters or over little rocks wasn't critical; it was just that we didn't want to run into something big enough to matter. Here, we probably went down in a little crater and came back up. We did that a lot; but we got a little more excited here because this is our first real ride together on this thing. The burst of static probably indicates that I made a turn to try to avoid the crater and lost the low-gain lock.
121:52:20|ALSJ|CDR|There are three things that I remember most about the Rover ride. Number one, when you were driving east into the Sun, it was almost impossible to see things ahead of you. When you were driving cross-Sun you had much better visibility and depth perception because of the shadows; and even driving down-Sun you could certainly see the boulders. Second was the fact that you often couldn't see small craters and they were important in the same way that potholes are to you when you're driving down the highway. The difference is that, in one-sixth gravity, when you do hit a boulder or you do drop one wheel in a small crater, you literally lift the Rover off the ground. I mean, you were literally driving on three wheels a good part of the time. It wasn't a choppy, sports-car feel, driving down the highway going bang-bang, bang. It was more of a waltz. Boom, and you go u-u-up and come down. Hit another one; u-u-up and come down. And, of course, not only did the Rover bounce but so did we. So it was a very good thing that we had snug seatbelts. Without them, we could easily have bounced out of the seats. And, lastly, the reduced gravity was particularly noticeable when you were driving on the side of a hill. I remember many times when we were driving on the side of a hill and Jack commenting that we were going to roll over. And indeed, because you have less gravity holding you down on the Moon, that was not a false perception; it was fact. You had to be careful on the side of a hill, because if you hit a bump with an uphill wheel, you could lift the thing off the ground and possibly become unstable and tip over. Of course, the situation was more obvious if you were in the downhill seat and I tried to keep Jack on the downside. It was much more comfortable on the uphill side; and that's a commander's prerogative when he's driving the Rover.
121:52:20|ALSJ|CDR|Those were the three things that were most noticeable; and I don't know that it would have been advantageous to have had a Rover that could have gone any faster. You needed to be careful in driving and probably couldn't have used the additional capability. When we set a speed record of somewhere around 14 or 15 km/hr coming down a hill, we were really hauling the metal; we were really tearing. And, not being able to see all that well ahead, I don't think we would have wanted to come down much faster. Of course, we were traveling over uncharted terrain; and, if we'd been at an established lunar base with a yellow stripe down the middle of a 'paved' surface - or, at least, if we'd been on a surveyed path with no boulders or potholes in the way - then we could have driven comfortably at a lot higher speed. But if we'd hit a boulder at 10 km/hr and smashed the hell out of the front end of the Rover, we'd have been out of business. We could have gotten back to the LM, but we wouldn't have gotten the job done that we'd gone to the Moon to do.
121:52:20|ALSJ||The seatbelt latching mechanism is shown in training photo @alsjurl/a17/ap17-KSC-72PC-346.jpg"@alsjt>KSC-72PC-346</a> in which we see Jack's seatbelt belt latch hanging from the Auxilliary staff at next to Gene's right arm. The hook at the end of the latching mechanism was fitted to the U-shaped handrail as can be seen in AS17-135-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20544"@alsjt>20544</a>. After the hook was in place, the T-shaped handle on the latching mechanism was thrown across to the inboard position to tighten the belt and lock it.
121:53:06|ALSJ||On this traverse, Jack and Gene won't often be out of sight of the LM and could communicate through it to Earth. As a general rule, however, NASA prefers to communicate through the low-gain antenna on the Rover, thereby decreasing the frequency and length of communications breaks.
121:53:06|ALSJ|CDR|Pointing the antenna was easy enough when you were parked, but the indicator was really useful when you were driving, particularly when you were driving with the Earth behind you or well off to the side.
121:53:06|ALSJ||The indicator on the low-gain antenna is described at 119:07:05.
121:53:26|ALSJ||The traverse maps are clip mounted to the accessory staff mounted on Jack's inboard handhold. There are probably at least two maps, one showing the immediate area of this traverse, the other showing the whole valley. To look at the "big map", Jack would probably have to lean forward and to his left to lift up the local map.
121:53:26|ALSJ|LMP|With that charge in my hands, I'm not sure I could have reached for anything. And I think the reason my voice is sounding so subdued in this section is that my forearms are starting to get tired and I am mostly concentrating on not dropping the charge.
121:53:36|ALSJ||The map on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-26</a> shows the first leg of the traverse being a 0.6 kilometer drive on a heading of 116, starting from the spot of his Nav initialization at the SEP site.
121:54:06|ALSJ|CDR|The helmet didn't turn; so you didn't have a good view. To see to the side, you had to turn your head inside the helmet; but because of the visors, that only gave you a little bit of a view to the side. The only other choice was to turn your body and, because the suit was so stiff, that was very difficult. Consequently, you didn't have a lot of peripheral vision.
121:54:21|ALSJ||The L&amp;A consisted of a site model suspended over a moveable TV camera on the floor of the facility. The camera moved in response to crew input and provided a view in either the @alsjurl/tnD7112Simulators.html"@alsjt>LM simulator</a> windows or, for the Rover missions, on a monitor that was part of an LRV mockup. Dave Scott and Jim Irwin were the first to use the L&amp;A to get a feel for driving the Rover at their landing site. Jim Irwin made the first test drive about a week prior to the Apollo 15 launch and, while local detail wasn't reproduced, the simulations did give Scott and Irwin a feel for the relative location and appearance of the major site features. Apollo 16 photo @alsjurl/a16/ap16-72-H-430.jpg"@alsjt>72-H-430</a> shows John Young and Charlie Duke doing a simulated Rover traverse.
121:54:21|ALSJ|CDR|I can remember playing in the simulator and going down and flying around the valley. It wasn't the same picture you got when you're were sitting in the Rover 2-3 feet above the surface. It was like taking an airplane at a couple hundred feet and flying around the different parts of the valley just to get a feel for what it looked like. I don't recall that that helped very much because when you're in a Rover, you're just really down among them; you're down in this rolling, hummocky terrain. It was different.
121:54:34|ALSJ||They are about 200 meters northeast of the rim of East Trident and have not yet learned to judge the sizes of craters.
121:55:40|ALSJ||They are now near the east rim of East Trident.
121:55:45|ALSJ||East Trident is about 300 meters across while Poppie is about 70m.
121:55:58|ALSJ||As per @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-28</a>, they want to be driving south on a heading of 181 degrees.
121:56:12|ALSJ||At this point, Jack may be taking AS17-136-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20727"@alsjt>20727</a> and Gene may be taking AS17-134-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20390"@alsjt>20390</a>. During the next few minutes of the drive, Jack will take @alsjurl/a17/a17.1215626_trv.jpg"@alsjt>seven photos</a>, AS17-136-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20728"@alsjt>20728</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20734"@alsjt>20734</a>, and Gene will add AS17-134-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20391"@alsjt>20391</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20392"@alsjt>20392</a>. In successive frames, individual boulders can sometimes be tracked as Gene and Jack drive toward them. However, on this traverse, Jack takes so few frames that the coverage of the drive is spotty. Note that most of Jack's picture's have the horizon tilted down to the left, probably as a result of the way Jack is sitting or of the way his RCU-mounted camera is tilted.
121:56:12|ALSJ||All the frames Jack and Gene take during the drive to Station 1 are displayed in the PDF document ( @alsjurl/a17/a17trvLM-Sta1.pdf"@alsjt>16 Mb</a> ).
121:56:12|ALSJ||A "septum" is a dividing wall or membrane, such as the nasal tissue that separates the two human nostrils. Here, Jack is probably describing an area where the three craters don't quite overlap, leaving a bit of ground which is more or less level with the original surface.
121:57:30|ALSJ||The main feedwater tank contained about 8.5 pounds of water, and the auxiliary tank 3.4 pounds. They are nearly 5 hours into the EVA and will close the LM hatch at 7 hours 12 minutes, each with about one pound of water remaining. The time they take to use up the main supply depends, of course, both on how quickly they are expending water and on the amount of water they had in the tank to start with.
121:57:50|ALSJ||The control is on the bottom of the PLSS and there is a cut-out in the seat so that Jack can reach it.
121:58:21|ALSJ||Gene has decided that up-and-down motion (pitch) is more acceptable than side-to-side motion (roll).
121:58:58|ALSJ||The nearest rim of Powell is about 0.5 kilometers southwest of their present location.
121:59:19|ALSJ||Gene can see the charge at Jack's feet. Because of the bulk of his suit, the RCU, and the camera, Jack certainly can't see it.
121:59:29|ALSJ||The ridge is shown in AS17-136- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20735"@alsjt>20735</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20736"@alsjt>20736</a>.
121:59:29|ALSJ||All the frames Jack and Gene take during the drive to Station 1 are displayed in the PDF document ( @alsjurl/a17/a17trvLM-Sta1.pdf"@alsjt>16 Mb</a> ).
122:00:19|ALSJ||This would actually put the station very close to the west base of the Steno "dimple".
122:01:15|ALSJ||The nine o'clock position relative to their current direction of travel is east. Steno is actually southeast of them.
122:01:19|ALSJ||The L&amp;A facilty was housed next to the @alsjurl/tnD7112Simulators.html"@alsjt>LM simulator</a> and contained a large, ceiling-mounted model of the landing site . A TV camera on the floor beneath the model moved in response to crew inputs and provided a landing-site view either in the windows of the LM simulator or on a monitor on an LRV mockup.
122:01:19|ALSJ|CDR|This is another reference to simulations where we used the L&amp;A to fly the LM around our landing site to see what these places looked like from maybe 50 or 100 feet above the surface. But there were obvious differences. In the simulator you didn't have the Sun problem and you couldn't get right down on the surface like you could in the Rover. From 50 or 100 feet in the air, things look grossly different and that's what I'm referring to here.
122:02:13|ALSJ||They will park about 150 meters short of the Steno rim, at about the 11 o'clock position on the rim relative to the 12 o'clock north that Bob will use in his next transmission. As with Shepard and Mitchell on their climb to Cone Crater on Apollo 14, Gene and Jack won't actually get a look into Steno Crater, but they will sample boulders ejected from the crater. Their stopping place is on the right edge of AS17-136- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20737"@alsjt>20737</a>. When Jack says "they can locate us", he is noting that the Station location can be pinpointed in post-flight analysis of the pans they will take once they stop and get to work.
122:02:13|ALSJ||All the frames Jack and Gene take during the drive to Station 1 are displayed in the PDF document ( @alsjurl/a17/a17trvLM-Sta1.pdf"@alsjt>16 Mb</a> ).
122:02:19|ALSJ||From this, we can estimate that Houston thinks the SEP transmitter is roughly 200 meters west and 300 meters south of its actual location. Bob's remarks have been slightly edited for clarity.
122:03:09|ALSJ||Emory Crater is south of them, about another kilometer.
122:03:27|ALSJ||AS17-136- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20738"@alsjt>20738</a> and AS17-134-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20393"@alsjt>20393</a> are taken - in that order - as they maneuver to park at what they will call Station 1, despite the changed location. A @alsjurl/a17/a17LROEVA-1.jpg"@alsjt>labeled detail</a> from the July 2009 LROC image of the landing site shows the location of Station 1.
122:04:51|ALSJ||They are about 150 meters from the Steno rim.
122:05:14|ALSJ||There are eight seismic charges in all, differing only in the amount of high explosive each contains and the preset runout time of the mechanical timers. This package, number six, contains 454 grams of explosive. There are three pins which must be pulled to activate the charge and prepare it to act on a fire signal from the LSPE antenna that Jack deployed near the Central Station.
122:05:54|ALSJ||Jack means that there will be no need to take locator photographs specifically for the charge deployment; the charge will be visible in a pan planned for the end of the station. Note that Jack was supposed to have taken a pan at this point but, for some reason doesn't take it until 122:32:50. Those photos are AS17-136- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20744"@alsjt>20744</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20776"@alsjt>20776</a> and show the site, the charge, and the Rover parking orientation.
122:05:57|ALSJ||Gene is turning on the TV.
122:07:04|ALSJ||Figure @alsjurl/a17/a17psrf6-102.jpg"@alsjt>6-102</a> from the Apollo 17 Preliminary Science Report is a planimetric map of Station 1.
|ALSJ||TV on.
|ALSJ||The planned Station 1 activities - at Emory Crater - are shown on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-30 and 31</a>. Gene has identical pages, numbered CDR-28 and CDR-29. Because they are running behind, they have stopped about 150 meters from Steno Crater and will do all their sampling in a fresh crater about 20 meters across and 3 to 4 meters deep.
|ALSJ||Rather than take a pan at this point, Jack is off-camera examining the boulders at the crater rim. The crater can be seen in a @alsjurl/a17/a17.1220706_dmh.jpg"@alsjt>portion of a pan</a> he takes just before they leave the site. They will begin sampling with the large boulder on the left side of the near rim. Figure @alsjurl/a17/a17psrf6-102.jpg"@alsjt>6-102</a> from the Apollo 17 Preliminary Science Report is a planimetric map of Station 1.
122:07:35|ALSJ||@alsjurl/Fendell-Bio.pdf"@alsjt>Fendell</a> pans counter-clockwise past Jack, who is leaning over a two-foot-high boulder west of the Rover.
122:08:13|ALSJ||Water from the Aux tank flows through the Primary tank.
122:09:04|ALSJ||Gene and Jack are carrying two different varieties of drive tubes which they can push or hammer into the ground. The majority were "lower" sections which have a hardened bit to resist damage from buried rocks. The others were "upper" sections which can be threaded into lower sections to make double-length cores. When using either a lower section by itself or an upper/lower pair as a double core, they will attach an adapter at the top and then one of the extension handles. This way, they can hammer on the extension handle and then extract the core without having to bend over.
122:09:04|ALSJ||In the checklist, they have only generalized geology tasks listed, identically, on pages @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-31 and CDR-29</a>. On some of the early missions, the geology tasks were spelled out in considerable detail; but it was soon realized that such decisions were better made in real time by the geologists in the Backroom, with input from the crew. Even so, for this first Apollo 17 geology stop, the listed tasks were designed for a longer stop at Emory and many will be dropped to save time.
122:09:23|ALSJ||Gene is about to initiate the gravimeter measurement.
122:10:02|ALSJ||Jack is photographing the sunlit face of the rock that they are about to sample. Gene, who is about to take a cross-Sun stereopair from south of the boulder, is reminding Jack not to get his shadow on the rock. On the site map, this boulder is at about 7 o'clock on the crater rim, relative to a 12 o'clock north. Gene's cross-Sun stereopair is AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20394"@alsjt>20394</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20395"@alsjt>20395</a> and Jack's down-Sun is AS17-136- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20739"@alsjt>20739</a>. Gene's photos show the crater quite well.
122:10:22|ALSJ||A "locator" is a photograph which includes an object of known size - the Rover or the LM - and/or an identifiable horizon feature which can be used to locate the sample site. Jack's "locator" is AS17-136- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20740"@alsjt>20740</a>.
122:11:09|ALSJ||At the end of his pan, Fendell finds them working at the boulder Jack was examining earlier. Jack collects the first fragment with his scoop while Gene hammers on the top, northeast corner of the rock. It appears that Gene is standing a little downhill just inside the lip of the crater to their north.
122:11:09|ALSJ|CDR|You just had to get yourself in a stable position to be able to swing the hammer. Because of the restriction of the suit, there was basically only one pendulum plane in which you could swing the hammer; so you had to find a way to stand so that you could swing in that plane and be close to your work. You had some freedom to reach out a little farther, and some ability to rotate your wrist and swing more to the right or left, but not a lot. Generally, it was important to position correctly in three dimensions so that you could hit the spot you wanted and hit it with authority. And even then, you'd swing and just hit in the general area; it would have been really hard to hit a nail on the head.
122:11:09|ALSJ|LMP|Although I had a lot to do with the design of the hammer, the handle was too big around for me. I couldn't grip it, and that was one of the reasons why Gene was the one who carried and usually used it. I had convinced myself that I would generally do better with the scoop. Also, Gene could put a lot more force into the hammer. He could grip it, and he also had longer arms. The thing it took Gene a long time to learn was that you don't hit rocks in the middle to break them. You hit them on the edges and pieces break off much more quickly. By the time we got to the Moon, he was pretty good at it. But I remember that, early on in training, he would go after a rock right in the middle of it.
122:11:34|ALSJ||Gene hits the boulder with three sets of five blows. He manages to knock off a small fragment. Apparently, the hammer is turning somewhat in his hand. Although he has his back to us, he does seem to re-adjust his grip after each set.
122:11:47|ALSJ||Gene strikes the rock seven more times, a little below the first site. He then rests. He has been balancing on his right foot, with the edge of the crater just to the right of that foot and with his left leg stuck out to the side as he hammers on the north corner of the rock. It seems a very precarious stance, particularly so close to a rock-filled crater.
122:12:02|ALSJ||Gene hits the rock five more times. The strokes are audible through his suit.
122:12:05|ALSJ|CDR|You had to hold onto the hammer and that meant you had to squeeze your finger against the pressure in the gloves. After you did that for a while, your hand and your forearm muscle would get sore. So you'd have to take a rest; not because your shoulder was sore or you were out of breath, but because of your hand and forearm. We were in pretty good shape at the time; we did a lot of training that exercised our forearms before we started; but gripping was still very tiring.
122:12:05|ALSJ||In response to a question, Gene said that, while driving the Rover, he did not have to grip the handcontroller so much as curl his fingers, slightly, over the top of it. This took relatively little effort and, on the whole, he had a chance to rest his forearm muscles during the drives.
122:12:10|ALSJ||He hits the rock three more times.
122:12:21|ALSJ||Gene has been standing inside the crater, north of Jack and a meter below him, picking up a chip.
122:12:49|ALSJ||Gene puts the chip in the bag Jack is holding.
122:12:53|ALSJ||Gene climbs easily out of the crater, then stumbles slightly on a fist-sized rock.
122:12:53|ALSJ|CDR|Because of all of the stuff in front of you - your PLSS controls, your camera, your sample bags - it took a concerted effort to see exactly what you were stepping on. Like everything else you did on the Moon, you had to plan ahead a little bit. Here, it was just difficult to get up that little incline and I had to take a lot of little choppy steps. That gave me better balance than trying to take a big leap.
122:13:20|ALSJ||Gene hits the south-top corner six times and knocks off a sizable sample.
122:13:28|ALSJ||It's a flat, hand-sized piece.
122:13:33|ALSJ|LMP|Both pyroxene and ilmenite are dark minerals because of their iron and magnesium content.
122:13:33|ALSJ||Jack has retrieved the sample with the scoop and is now trying to stick the scoop in the ground so that he can have both hands free.
122:13:38|ALSJ||Jack opens Gene's SCB and puts the sample bag in it.
122:13:38|ALSJ|CDR|Early in training, we learned from working together that when the other guy is wrapping up a sample, you should turn your back and lean over so that he can drop the sample in the SCB. If you just walk away to do something else, he's left standing there with his hands full. The reason you have to lean over is mostly because the suit makes it difficult to reach up very high. Now, Jack isn't the tallest guy in the world, but the suit made it even harder for him. You just can't get your hand much above your shoulder unless you rotate your body to the side.
122:13:38|ALSJ|LMP|Once we got into operational training, we'd wear backpacks with SCBs even when we weren't wearing suits; and it quickly became second nature, a part of the routine, to turn and bend over so the guy wrapping the sample could put it in your bag.
122:14:10|ALSJ||Gene has handed Jack an empty sample bag. They are facing west, away from the Rover and the TV camera.
122:14:13|ALSJ||Gene uses his tongs to grab the sample.
122:14:45|ALSJ||Fendell pans away from them.
122:15:03|ALSJ||Fendell has pointed the camera at them again.
122:15:05|ALSJ||Because of the stiff suits, holding a bag with one hand and pouring samples into it with the scoop held in the other hand is a bit difficult. Here, Gene and Jack are working as a team, Gene holding the bag while Jack works the scoop. At Station 3 on EVA-2, a revision of the station activities leaves Jack sampling on his own, at a noticeable cost of efficiency. Later in the mission, Jack devises a reasonably effective method of solo sampling. Jack moves west and a little below the rock. He bends his knee and gets a fillet sample with the scoop.
122:15:26|ALSJ||To receive the sample, Gene flexes his knees slightly; however he doesn't hold the sample bag very low, as Dave Scott often did on Apollo 15.
122:15:26|ALSJ|LMP|There was a long-standing interest in the possibility of getting samples of permanently-shadowed soil so that the solar-wind chemists could look at material that hadn't been directly exposed for some period of time. I don't know if anything ever came of it, but we talked about it a lot over the years.
122:15:26|ALSJ||As of 1991, very little has ever been published with regard to the shadowed soil samples. As it turns out, lunar soil saturates with solar wind products in a matter of decades and then is thrown around and mixed. Analysis of the relative abundances of solar wind constituents in soils taken at the bottom of the deep cores showed little difference with relative abundances in soils collected at the surface or, presumably, in the shadowed samples. Had there been noticeable differences, the results would have been published and the lack of publications indicates an unremarkable result.
122:15:31|ALSJ||Jack uses a one-handed scooping motion.
122:15:53|ALSJ||Jack stumbles and spills some of the sample.
122:16:38|ALSJ||Jack has probably dropped the scoop and may, at this point, have devised the trick of stepping on the head to raise the handle to an easy-grabbing height.
122:16:41|ALSJ|CDR|You learned how to maneuver; you learned how to walk; you learned how to bend over to help each other; you eventually learned how to swing the hammer better; you learned how to pick up soil samples. You learned how to make your movements more efficient and productive.
122:16:55|ALSJ||The "after" is AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20396"@alsjt>20396</a>.
122:16:55|ALSJ||Journal contributor Yuri Krasilnikov has created a before/after animation ( @alsjurl/a17/a17anim20394-6.gif"@alsjt>352k</a> ) from 20394 and 96.
122:16:56|ALSJ||What Jack is suggesting is that, rather than pounding on the rock to break off another sample, they pick up a manageable piece off the surface. Gene retrieves the gnomon; Jack moves around to the east rim of the crater.
122:16:56|ALSJ|LMP|A block is a rock of almost any size, as long as its big enough that it clearly doesn't fall into the general size range of particles in the underlying regolith
122:17:09|ALSJ||Jack is standing at the east rim, gesturing at the rock around him.
122:17:22|ALSJ||Jack goes toward Gene, who is out of the TV picture. AS17-134-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20403"@alsjt>20403</a> is a close-up Gene will take at @alsjurl/a17/#1222313"@alsjt>122:23:13</a>, after he and Jack get two chip samples. The approximate location of the contact between the two parts of the rock is labeled in a @alsjurl/a17/a17lbl20403.jpg"@alsjt>detail</a>.
122:17:56|ALSJ||They are between the Rover and the first boulder that they sampled. Gene has set the gnomon on the ground south of the knee-high boulder and is taking "before" pictures from the south. In general, a contact is a surface defining a change in rock character within a single rock mass. Here, there is a change in vesicularity across the contact. They are not as close to the rim as they were before. Gene has taken a cross-Sun stereopair of the rock, and Jack has taken a down-Sun. Gene's "befores" are AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20397"@alsjt>20397</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20398"@alsjt>20398</a> and Jack's "before" is AS17-136- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20741"@alsjt>20741</a>).
122:18:06|ALSJ||Houston is puzzled that the TV hasn't shown any of the large boulders (large enough to have been seen in the Apollo 15 pictures) at the place where Houston thinks they are. Jack is saying that they just sampled a boulder, albeit, one less than a meter high.
122:18:17|ALSJ||Journal Contributor David Harland notes that, as Jack implied at @alsjurl/a17/a17.trvsta1.html#1220214"@alsjt>122:02:14</a>, it is more important that they are collecting samples near Steno than it is to know exactly where they are. The Station location can be determined in post-flight analysis of the pans.
122:18:17|ALSJ||Gene kneels east of the boulder and tries to get positioned so he can use the hammer effectively
122:18:27|ALSJ||Takes the scoop in his left hand, moves his knees back a foot or so and leans forward on the scoop while wielding the hammer with his right. We can't see his right hand, but he evidently breaks off a piece with just a blow or two.
122:18:27|ALSJ|CDR|Without the suit, I probably would have reached out with my left hand to brace myself on the rock, but that would have put me too close to the rock to hit it properly in the suit. So I used the scoop for support.
122:18:45|ALSJ||Gene rises, apparently by pushing back against the scoop handle.
122:19:02|ALSJ||Jack takes the hammer.
122:19:03|ALSJ||Jack leans on the rock from the southwest.
122:19:06|ALSJ||Jack gives the rock two sharp hammer blow and a sample breaks loose.
122:19:06|ALSJ|LMP|Note the value of geological field experience!
122:19:19|ALSJ||Gene uses the scoop to collect the fragment he broke off.
122:19:19|ALSJ||Still leaning on the rock, Jack examines the fresh face and then looks over at Gene. He does so mostly by turning his head inside the helmet; there is some slight rotation of Jack's body in that direction.
122:19:36|ALSJ||Jack delivers one sharp blow on the east face and knocks off a piece.
122:19:45|ALSJ||After hitting the east face twice more, without dislodging anything, Jack tries to change his grip by tossing the hammer but misses and almost drops it.
122:19:45|ALSJ||Gene collects the first fragment Jack knocked off. Because Gene is holding the top of the scoop handle in his left hand, he rests the scoop head on his left hand and then moves his right hand down the handle toward the head to shorten the distance he'll have to raise his right arm to tip the fragment into his left hand.
122:20:11|ALSJ||Gene hasn't yet collected the east-face fragment. He plants the scoop so he can get a sample bag off his camera. Jack hammers the rock four times without success. Even an experienced field geologist doesn't always dislodge the piece he wants.
122:20:30|ALSJ||Evidently, Gene was unable to get a bag, perhaps because he is holding the samle in his left hand.
122:21:25|ALSJ||Gene uses the scoop to pick the fragment off the surface, trying to get as little soil as possible.
122:21:37|ALSJ||Jack puts the sample bags in Gene's SCB, then gets another bag for the last sample. Before taking his close-ups, Gene takes a cross-Sun "after", AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20399"@alsjt>20399</a>, and a "locator", AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20400"@alsjt>20400</a>, toward the Rover.
122:21:40|ALSJ||That is, they will use the rake to collect about a kilogram of soil, about enough to fill one sample bag.
122:21:50|ALSJ||Jack puts this sample bag in Gene's SCB.
122:22:18|ALSJ||Gene goes to the Rover; Jack goes to the Rover, out of the picture.
122:22:33|ALSJ|LMP|I was just telling Gene to bootleg another sample. If he picked one up out of the area he'd just photographed, then Houston could probably identify it.
122:23:12|ALSJ||Fendell finds Gene again; he is taking pictures. His close-up photos of the second boulder are AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20401"@alsjt>20401</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20404"@alsjt>20404</a>.
122:23:40|ALSJ||Gene gets a sample with his tongs. The operation of his yo-yo is clearly visible. Gene goes to Jack northeast of the Rover, out of the TV picture. Fendell pans to follow Gene.
122:25:03|ALSJ||Jack is just in view; Gene is reminding him to position the gnomon color chart so that it is fully sunlit. A photograph of Jack positioning the SEP transmitter, AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20438"@alsjt>20438</a>, is a good illustration of Jack's posture at this point.
122:25:03|ALSJ|CDR|It was even awkward to get the gnomon down on a level piece of ground. You didn't want to drop it from a foot or two up, so you had to bend one knee, get the other leg out to the side, and lean sideways, very much like you sometimes had to in order to use the hammer. It was another one of ways you learned how to do things easily and with stability. You didn't really think about it; you knew when you were unstable and when you weren't, and you learned how to react. It's a normal reaction to a new environment.
122:25:06|ALSJ|LMP|Filleting is a natural consequence of the continual gardening of the upper regolith layers by the impacts of small meteors. Any boulder that's exposed will have material thrown against it that will collect at the base. The original thoughts about the 'dark mantle' material was that it had been put down very late, that it was very young; and that it might have been filleting the boulders. Of course, the truth is that the regolith and the dark material were intimately mixed. The dark mantling proved to be the result of pyroclastic materials - which had been laid down on top of the valley-filling lavas - being mixed with the regolith as the regolith formed. At Shorty Crater (EVA-2), we found black and orange pyroclastics which had been protected by a late lava flow until the Shorty impact dug it up; but, in most places, the pyroclastics probably had been deposited after the lavas had ceased to invade the valley. What we saw at Shorty may have been the result of the sort of thing that happens on Earth when, after the gas that has been powering the pyroclastic eruption is depleted, you have a lava flow. At @alsjurl/alsj_sunsetcrtr.jpg"@alsjt>Sunset Crater</a> near Flagstaff, the last thing that happened, except for a little bit of ash, was the @alsjurl/alsj_bonito.jpg"@alsjt>Bonito (Lava) Flow</a>. At Taurus-Littrow, the last of the lava flows may well have been the one that covered the pyroclastic deposit that the Shorty impact uncovered.
122:25:25|ALSJ|LMP|As with any of the other sampling procedures, you took a set of pre-sampling documentation photographs and then drug the rake basket through the regolith until you had a reasonable number of small fragments. Studies of samples from some of the early missions has suggested that, in the walnut-sized fragment population, you got more fragments from outside the immediate area than in any other size range. So the rake was designed to maximize the yield of these 'exotics'.
122:25:31|ALSJ||Fendell pulls back on the TV zoom, bringing both of the astronauts into the frame. Gene and Jack are both taking "before" photos of the rake area. Gene's pictures are AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20405"@alsjt>20405</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20407"@alsjt>20407</a> and Jack's are AS17-136- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20742"@alsjt>20742</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20743"@alsjt>20743</a>.
122:26:04|ALSJ||Jack takes the first rake swath, standing with his right foot forward and his body turned to his left, dragging the rake with his right hand as he moves backwards.
122:26:10|ALSJ||Jack finishes the first swath. The rake is not penetrating very far into the soil.
122:26:17|ALSJ||Jack takes three more swaths, shaking dirt out between the tines after each one. Gene's @alsjurl/a17/a17pan1222614.jpg"@alsjt>pan</a> consists of frames AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20408"@alsjt>20408</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20431"@alsjt>20431</a>.

In the first, he has his left hand under rake head where it is attached to the extension handle and is about to lift it up to horizontal so he can carry it over to Gene. In the second picture, he is a lot closer to Gene, who will get a sample bag out once he finishes the pan.
122:26:41|ALSJ||Jack takes swaths number 5 and 6; the bottom of his SCB is loose.
122:27:45|ALSJ||Gene is not in the TV picture.
122:27:52|ALSJ||Fendell pulls back on the zoom so that Gene can be seen.
122:28:05|ALSJ||Gene puts the sample bag in Jack's SCB.
122:28:16|ALSJ||Neither Gene nor Jack is sounding punchy any more.
122:28:58|ALSJ||Fendell pans up and then down; neither Jack nor Gene is in the picture when he finishes.
122:29:10|ALSJ||Apparently, Jack has poured most of the soil onto the ground, not into the bag. The rake has solid metal sides so that, rotated ninety degrees, it can be used as a big scoop.
122:29:33|ALSJ||Fendell pulls back on the zoom again and finds Jack using the rake.
122:29:51|ALSJ||The sample bags are square and were designed to hold rocks up to 11 cm in diameter. The volume of such a rock is about 700 cc's and bags could clearly hold a greater volume of soil. Soil poured loosely into a bag would have a density of no less than about 1.3 kg per liter and, consequently, a kilogram would occupy a volume of no more than about 800 cc's.
122:30:07|ALSJ||Not a very useful thing to try when wearing a helmet.
122:30:19|ALSJ||Jack retrieves the rake and goes to the Rover. Gene takes the "after" picture, AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20432"@alsjt>20432</a>.
122:30:19|ALSJ||Jack had planned to take two pans at Station 1 - one at the start and one at the end - but, for some reason, did not take the initial pan and, instead, went over to the boulders to examine them right away. Although Parker may suspect that the first pan wasn't taken, he doesn't know that for certain. The two pans, had they both been taken, would have provided "before" and "after" views of the site as a whole.
122:30:37|ALSJ||Jack mounts the rake on the gate, pushing the handle into a retaining bracket.
122:31:34|ALSJ||Fendell starts to follow Jack, but sees Gene's shadow, stops, and pans to find him at the gate. Fendell then pans away again and stops to look at a split boulder. Evidently, the geology team in Houston decided that the boulder was not of sufficient interest to call it to the crew's attention. The LM may be visible in the TV picture as a bright dot.
122:32:14|ALSJ||Fendell finds Jack taking a @alsjurl/a17/a17pan1223224.jpg"@alsjt>pan</a> southwest of the Rover.

122:32:14|ALSJ||Erik van Meijgaarden has combined 20758 and 20760 as a @alsjurl/a17/a17-20758-60.jpg"@alsjt>portrait of Gene at the Rover</a>.
122:32:14|ALSJ||The portion of Jack's pan showing the @alsjurl/a17/a17.1220706_dmh.jpg"@alsjt>Station 1 crater</a> was assembled by David Harland.
122:32:14|ALSJ||Harland calls attention to the difference in shadow lengths in this view compared with the lengths of the astronaut shadows in Gene's early @alsjurl/a17/a17.1222614_dmh.jpg"@alsjt>pan</a>. The dominant factor that produces the different shadow lengths is the different ground slopes on which the shadows are falling at this low Sun angle. A comparison of the pans suggest that Gene parked on a slight rise. Note, for example, that the Rover shadow can not be seen in Gene's pan, which was taken from east of the Rover. Clearly, the Rover shadow visible in Jack's pan falls on a downslope - relative to the Sun - while the astronaut shadows in Gene's pan may fall on an upslope. The Sun is about 18 degrees and, on a level surface, a 2-meter-high suited astronaut would cast a 6.15 meter shadow. A modest two degree upslope would reduce the shadow length to 5.49 meters while a two degree downslope would increase it to 6.97 meters. A second factor which influences perceptions of shadow length is orientation of the shadow relative to the observer. In Gene's pan the astronaut shadows fall more or less along the line of sight, which can make them look shorter than they really are while, in Jack's pan, the shadows run more nearly across the line-of-sight and suffer little foreshortening.
122:32:53|ALSJ||TV off.
122:33:13|ALSJ||Jack has just taken AS17-136- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20776"@alsjt>20776</a>. Details of the Station 1 close-out and of the drive back to the SEP transmitter are given, identically, on cuff checklist pages @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>LMP-33 and CDR-31</a>.
122:34:52|ALSJ||Jack's seat belt is twisted, which makes it too short to latch.
122:34:56|ALSJ||That is, did Jack close Gene's sample collection bag?
122:35:13|ALSJ||The sample bags hooked to the bottom of Jack's camera have apparently held the folds that they'd acquired in storage and are blocking his view of his seatbelt.
122:36:14|ALSJ||Jack turns the belt part way to find out if he's understood Gene correctly.
122:37:21|ALSJ|LMP|The basic use of the photographs was supposed to have been the location of observations, although nobody's ever done very much of that analysis. I think, also, that these traverse photos were added as a response to the problem that the Apollo 16 (means 15) crew had in knowing where they were, at least on their first traverse. And, finally, if you weren't doing anything else but riding, you might as well take pictures and get more information and documentation. There was plenty of film. And some of that information proved to be very useful. The pictures I took when we were driving on the avalanche during the second EVA helped confirm my observation that there weren't many boulders on the surface, as you would expect if it had been a gas-lubricated avalanche.
122:37:21|ALSJ||Journal Contributor David Harland notes that the practice of having the LMP take traverse pictures started with Apollo 16 as a result of the Apollo 15 experience. Readers should note that the pictures don't help the crew in knowing where they are, of course, because the pictures are developed post-flight in Houston. However, the pictures do help the geology team figure out where the crew went and, thus, tie verbal descriptions of features along the traverse route to the high-resolution pictures taken with the pan camera in the SIM Bay of the CSM.
122:37:21|ALSJ||During the drive back from Station 1, Jack takes a lot of pictures. Up to this point, he has probably only taken AS17-136- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20777"@alsjt>20777</a>, which shows Bear Mountain and the Steno rim and was probably taken as soon as he had his seatbelt fixed. The notation "Mtl" on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-31 and LMP-33</a> means "mantle", meaning the relatively-dark soil that blankets most of the site.
122:37:21|ALSJ||Between now and when Gene and Jack stop to deploy the seismic charge at 122:42:15, Jack takes approximately 36 pictures during the 600-meter drive, or about one every 17 meters.
122:37:21|ALSJ||A PDF file ( @alsjurl/a17/a17trv20777-96.pdf"@alsjt>17 Mb</a> ) contains the 20 photos, AS17-136-20777-96, Jack takes up to 122:40:04.
122:38:35|ALSJ||AS17-135- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20540"@alsjt>20540</a> will be taken at the SEP at the start of EVA-2 and shows the raindrop pattern quite well.

I suspect that Sherlock is hidden by its own rim and that the obvious crater in the middle distance is a nameless foreground feature. A detail ( @alsjurl/a17/a17-2309StenoSherlock.jpg"@alsjt>518k</a> ) from Pan Camera frame 2309 shows Steno in the center at the bottom and Sherlock at the upper right.
122:39:00|ALSJ|CDR|In looking at some of the pictures that Jack took on the way back to the LM, it's really obvious how difficult it was to know where you were in that three-dimensional environment. You could get up on high spots and orient yourself; and you always knew where you were in the valley - where you were in the 'big picture' - and where you were in relation to the LM. But the Rover Nav system really allowed you to go where you wanted to go fairly precisely. Getting back to the LM would have been easy enough without the Nav system. You could follow the Rover tracks back and, if that wasn't the most direct route, you could still get close enough to see the LM. There certainly weren't many things you could mistake for the LM. It was the only thing around that really reflected sunlight; it was also pretty big (23 feet or 7 meters tall) and would have been hard to miss. But in finding a particular crater when, as I say, you were 'down among them', the Nav system really helped.
122:39:07|ALSJ||Gene would rather have pitch motion than roll.
122:39:09|ALSJ|LMP|The glass-bottomed craters generally had a glass-lined central pit, a shelf surrounding that, and then the rim.

122:40:07|ALSJ||Gene probably turned the Rover to get a better view. At about this time, Jack took AS17-136-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20797"@alsjt>20797</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20799"@alsjt>20799</a>.

A @alsjurl/a17/a17det20799.jpg"@alsjt>detail</a>, rotate 15 degrees to the right, shows the LM subtending about 0.05 fiducial spacings or about 0.5 degrees. The LM is 7 meters tall, implying a distance of about 0.8 km. This is consistent with Gene report of a range of 0.7 km at 122:41:07, below.

122:41:00|ALSJ|CDR|The further away things were, the harder it was to judge size and distance. Things always looked closer and smaller than they really were. After a while you began to recalibrate your brain, but it was always deceptive.
122:41:40|ALSJ||A portion of the western valley floor is covered by light-colored material which, in overhead photographs, appears to be the result of a South Massif avalanche. During the second EVA, Gene and Jack will drive onto the light mantle and up onto the Jefferson-Lincoln-Lee Scarp, collecting samples and photographic evidence which will support the avalanche interpretation and give a 100 million year age.
122:41:43|ALSJ||Frame AS17-136- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20806"@alsjt>20806</a> shows Gene beginning to turn to the west. He may have done so to avoid the rock on the right - the top of which can be seen beyond the TV camera in 20805 - and noticed the white mantle off to his left. Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20810"@alsjt>20810</a> is the fullest view to the west. After Jack takes that frame, Gene turns back toward the north.
122:41:43|ALSJ||Jack is asking Gene about their range from the SEP transmitter (where Gene last initialized the nav system at @alsjurl/a17/a17.trvsta1.html#1213911"@alsjt>121:39:11</a>) because they want to deploy the charge at a range of 0.6 km.
122:42:13|ALSJ||They're stopping so Jack can deploy the seismic charge.
122:42:23|ALSJ||Horizon features in the photographs can be used to triangulate the deployment site. Gene's locator shots are AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20433"@alsjt>20433</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20434"@alsjt>20434</a> and Jack's photo at the same location and orientation is AS17-136- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20814"@alsjt>20814</a>>. See, also, a @alsjurl/a17/a17comp20433-20814.jpg"@alsjt>comparison</a>.
122:43:03|ALSJ||Jack has tried to put the charge far enough out to the side so that they won't hit it with the Rover. Training photo @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#72H1411"@alsjt>72-H-1411</a> shows back-up LMP Charlie Duke deploying a charge from his Rover seat.
122:43:22|ALSJ||Gene is driving the Rover in a slow, clockwise circle while Jack takes pictures. This is the "partial pan" listed on @alsjurl/a17/a17CuffEVA1.pdf"@alsjt>CDR-31</a>. Although there is virtually no chance of the charge going off if they hit it in the Rover, the antenna needs to be upright so that it can receive the detonation signal from the Central Station. As Gene discusses at @alsjurl/a17/a17.outcam.html#1413623"@alsjt>141:36:23</a>, the front-and-rear steering dictates a right-hand turn to avoid the charge.
122:44:02|ALSJ||Jack gave Bob a frame count of 95 when they were about to leave Station 1 at @alsjurl/a17/a17.sta1.html#1223308"@alsjt>122:33:08</a>. He had just taken frame AS17-136-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20776"@alsjt>20776</a>. That implies that Jack 'more or less' completed the pan with @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20827"@alsjt>20827</a>. An examination of the frames suggests that Gene started driving off in a northwesterly direction after Jack took @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20828"@alsjt>20828</a>. A comparison of details 20828 and 20813 ( @alsjurl/a17/a17comp20813-28.jpg"@alsjt>391k</a> ) indicates that 20828 was taken from a spot a bit farther north than 20813 but along much the same line-of-sight.

It is possible that that Jack's question, "(Can you) get through there?" refers to the space between two, small blocky-rimmed craters on either side of the TV camera in @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20836"@alsjt>20836</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20837"@alsjt>20837</a>.

The changing view of the distant mountains indicates that, beginning with 20838, he drove down into a large, shallow crater containing the possible bedrock, was climbing the inner, western slope by the time Jack took @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20841"@alsjt>20841</a>, and was completely out of the crater by the time Jack took @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20844"@alsjt>20844</a>.

122:47:08|ALSJ|CDR|When you drop a rock, it's like you've dropped a fresh fish in batter; the dust clings and the rock gets really coated.
122:47:13|ALSJ||Gene struggled with this observation. The version given here has been heavily edited.
122:47:37|ALSJ||During the drive from the "exposed bedrock" at 122:45:36 to their arrival at the SEP at 122:50;36, Jack takes photos AS17-136- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20843"@alsjt>20843</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20863"@alsjt>20863</a>. Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20849"@alsjt>20849</a> is taken from a distance of about 300 meters. The SEP site is about 100 meters east of the LM and, at 10 km/hr, the drive from the spot where 20849 is taken will take a little more than a minute.
122:47:44|ALSJ|CDR|When you were zig-zagging, if you weren't careful, the back end of the Rover could lose traction and swing around.
122:47:56|ALSJ||Throughout this period, they are driving with enough of a northerly heading that the Rover shadow is off on Gene's side. Jack's "Look what's ahead of us here" could be a reference to falling dust reflecting sunlight or, possibly, visibly impacting the surface out front. Gene's "Yeah, that's probably it. It probably didn't stay." is clearly agreement with Jack's hypothesis that they've lost the temporary fender. After saying that, Gene pauses briefly before saying "I can see it in the shadow." and that suggests that he looks to his left to examine the shadow.
122:47:56|ALSJ||Elapsed times used in the Apollo 17 LSJ are relative to the planned launch time of 0253 GMT on 7 December 1972. Consequently, it is currently about 0541 GMT on 12 December. The Sun is at an elevation of 18 degrees at an azimuth of 98 degrees. Jack's photo of Gene parked at the SEP site after initializing the LRV Nav system at the start of EVA-2, AS17-135-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20544"@alsjt>20544</a>, allows us to use the known length of the Rover - 3.0 meters - to calculate that the top of Gene's helmet is about 1.8 meters off the ground. With the Sun at an elevation of 18 degrees, Gene's shadow is 5.5 meters long, which is long enough for both of them to see it by turning their heads to the left inside the helmets.
122:48:04|ALSJ||Without the fender, the Rover and all of the equipment will get thoroughly covered with dust, thereby increasing in the risks of both mechanical and thermal problems. Dust on the battery covers, for example, increases the absorption of sunlight and raises the battery temperatures. Dust coating on the visors reduces visibility and, when the astronauts try to clean it off, creates scratches and additional glare.
122:48:04|ALSJ||I have done a brief comparison of the appearance of the top surface of the TV camera, but don't see any obvious evidence of dust accumulation. It should be noted that the appearance of the mirrored surface depends markedly on orientation of the Rover relative to the Sun.
122:48:12|ALSJ|CDR|We didn't go back to get the piece that fell off. But at the end of EVA-3, I broke off the other three fenders and brought those back to Earth along with the replacement fender that we made when we got back in the LM. Two of the fenders are on display at the Visitor's Center at the Johnson Space Center here in Houston, and the replacement fender is at the Smithsonian in Washington.
122:48:25|ALSJ||Jack is referring to the Surface Electrical Properties Experiment (SEP).
122:48:55|ALSJ||The Lunar Communications and Relay Unit (LCRU) contains most of the electronics for the voice and television systems. Because it is particularly sensitive to overheating, it is covered with highly-reflective gold foil which, in turn, is now covered with dust. Here, Gene spells out the acronym. Often, he and Jack will pronounce it "luh-crew".
122:49:13|ALSJ||After letting Jack off at the SEP transmitter, Gene will re-initialize the Rover navigation system which he will use in laying out N-S and E-W tracks with the Rover wheels. He and Jack will then use these tracks as guides for laying out the four 35-meter-long arms of the SEP transmitter antenna.
122:49:13|ALSJ||The third line of @alsjurl/a17/a17eva1CDR-32.jpg"@alsjt>CDR-32</a> calls for Gene to position the Rover so that he is pointing east. After initializing the Nav system, he is to drive east for 100 meters; then turn right to a heading of 210 and drive another 100 meters; and, finally, turn right to a heading of 360 for a drive of 200 meters north. This procedure would produce a cross of Rover tracks intersecting about 50 meters east of the SEP transmitter. Then, once Gene has the pattern laid out, Jack will carry the transmitter over to the intersection.
122:49:13|ALSJ|CDR|We came up with this during training; the Rover heading indicator let us get a very accurate layout.
122:49:13|ALSJ||Gene's statement that he is rolling west is open to several contradictory interpretations. One is that he has misspoken and means "east" rather than "west". A second interpretation is that Gene is going to lay out the pattern west of the transmitter, rather then east of it. A third interpretation is simply that he is going west of the transmitter before coming back alongside it, headed east, to let Jack off. I prefer the last of these.
122:50:10|ALSJ||That is, there still may be film left in Jack's magazine.
122:50:10|ALSJ||Once they are back in the cabin, Jack reports a frame count on this magazine (136/H) of 183. See the dialog after @alsjurl/a17/a17.eva1post.html#1265920"@alsjt>126:59:20</a>. The last useful image he took is AS17-136-20863, which corresponds to frame count 182. There were two additional frames that are virtually blank.
122:50:31|ALSJ||Actually, Jack's checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17eva1LMP-34.jpg"@alsjt>LMP-34</a> does not call out any photos, only a couple of "Pose for CDR".
122:50:50|ALSJ||Here is where Gene starts to drive his pattern. At about the middle of Jack's description, Gene reaches the end of the E-W arm and turns right to a heading of 210.
122:50:54|ALSJ||Jack seems to be describing, first, a shallow, subtle depression between the LM and the SEP and, second, the large, unnamed crater north of the SEP.
122:52:20|ALSJ||Gene has reached the southern end of the pattern and, having confirmed with Jack that he is south of the transmitter, is turning to a north heading.
122:53:22|ALSJ||Gene has now reached the north end of the pattern and is turning to come back to the transmitter.
122:54:05|ALSJ||As per CDR-32, Gene is parking the Rover pointing south.
122:54:05|ALSJ||The SEP antenna wires are wound on four reels fastened to the sides of the SEP transmitter. "This thing" - in Jack's next line - is probably the mechanism holding the reels in place, which is proving difficult to open. Jack has just dropped one of the reels. NASA photo @alsjurl/a17/ap17-S72-50268.jpg"@alsjt>S72-50268</a> (scan by Ed Hengeveld) shows Jack holding the transmitter during a training exercise on-board the one-sixth-g aircraft in September 1972 at Patrick Air Force Base in Florida.
122:54:37|ALSJ||Details of the transmitter and antenna deployment are on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva1LMP-34.jpg"@alsjt>LMP-34</a> and @alsjurl/a17/a17eva1CDR-33.jpg"@alsjt>CDR-33</a>. Jack has positioned the transmitter - which has to be aligned so that its solar panels will get maximum exposure, but not leveled - and has released the reels holding the antenna wires. Next, they will deploy the east and west arms, followed by the north and south arms.
122:54:59|ALSJ||TV on.
122:55:52|ALSJ||Gene appears briefly in the TV picture; he is at his seat, holding the @alsjurl/alsj-dustbrush.html"@alsjt>dustbrush</a>. The number 2 reel is the west arm and number 4 is the north arm. Number 1 is the east arm, and number 3 is the south arm.
122:56:33|ALSJ|CDR|The dust on the battery covers and everything else was thick enough to write in. With a working fender you'd always got a light film of dust; but this was 'dirt' dust.
122:56:33|ALSJ||@alsjurl/Fendell-Bio.pdf"@alsjt>Fendell</a> pans past Jack, who is now south of the Rover. His shadow appears to be 15-20 feet long.
122:57:10|ALSJ||In Houston, Bob is being told that the antenna reels and wires can rapidly become a "Chinese Puzzle" unless they are untangled very carefully.
122:57:13|ALSJ|LMP|There was a great deal of fine material in the regolith and, as it turned out, much of that was due to the orange and black pyroclastic glass which was present throughout the dark mantle. Just from the appearance of the area in the overhead photographs, we had anticipated that there would be pyroclastics and, here, I was carrying that anticipation a little bit farther.
122:57:46|ALSJ||Gene crosses in front of the panning TV; he is headed for Jack's position.
122:58:14|ALSJ||Jack will take reel 2 and deploy the western arm; Gene will take reel 1 and deploy the eastern arm.
122:58:30|ALSJ||Fendell finds Gene, who is picking up an antenna reel with his tongs.
122:58:35|ALSJ||That is, when Jack was deploying the geophones at the ALSEP site, any tension he got in the cables tended to move the central module.
122:58:47|ALSJ||Fendell is watching the SEP transmitter, which moves a couple of inches in Gene's direction. When Gene and Jack get to the ends of the wires, they will sight back across the transmitter at each other to make sure their lines are straight.
122:58:49|ALSJ||The transmitter moves a couple of inches east again.
122:59:02|ALSJ||The antenna wires may be attached low on the unit; it shows no signs of tipping over but, rather, just slides through the soil.
122:59:14|ALSJ||The two remaining antenna reels are visible in the TV, hanging from the north face of the transmitter. Fendell pans counter-clockwise away from the transmitter, and then reverses direction.
122:59:45|ALSJ||Neither Cernan, Schmitt nor Parker remembers what it was they "thought might happen.
123:00:31|ALSJ||Fendell gets as far as the South Massif in his clockwise pan and reverses direction again.
123:01:04|ALSJ||Fendell pans past Gene, who standing up-Sun of the Rover. His picture of Jack and of the east/west antenna arms is AS17-134-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20435"@alsjt>20435</a>.
123:01:21|ALSJ||They head back to the transmitter. There is no evidence that there were any anchors or flags for the ends of the SEP antenna wires. Jack suspects that they had decided, late in training, to stick the reels into the ground to serve as anchors and/or markers. Evidently, the attempt to use them as anchors was unsuccessful. Gene remembers that they planned to use the reels as markers. Bob agrees.
123:01:25|ALSJ||Mick Hyde calls our attention to the fact that Jack uses the word 'Taurus' here, rather than 'park' as originally transcribed. Jack sang another variation of "While Strolling Through the Park One Day" at @alsjurl/a17/a17.trvsta1.html#1213545"@alsjt>121:35:45</a>, using the word 'Moon' to replace 'park'. The pause in the rendition here suggests that he was trying to think of an alternative to 'Moon'; but his tone of voice when singing 'Taurus' and the disclaimer that follows indicate that he isn't happy with the choice.
123:02:18|ALSJ||Fendell finds both of them at the transmitter. The checklist calls for Jack to take reel 4 to the north and Gene to take reel 3 to the south. However, reversing roles will not matter at all.
123:02:28|ALSJ||Jack heads south; Gene drops his antenna.
123:02:29|ALSJ||Journal Contributor George Giusti, noting that I had failed to transcribe Gene's complete transmission, writes "My contemporaneous notes of 12/11/72 record Gene actually saying 'Oh, shit!'. Since I was in my teen years during Apollo 17, I am sure that I was particularly acute to listening and recording any profanity I would hear. (My wife likes to say my immaturity has only improved over the years!). In listening to (Larry) Haskin's (video) tape and replaying my own tapes recorded at the time, I do hear Gene mentioning the 'forbidden' word, although somewhat subvocally. The only reason I even mention this correction is your desire for completeness!!!
123:02:34|ALSJ||Jack returns to the transmitter; Gene retrieves the antenna with his tongs.
123:02:48|ALSJ||Jack doesn't remember what "this" was; nor what "that" might have been at 123:02:30.
123:02:50|ALSJ||Jack heads south again. Gene goes north. Fendell follows Jack, who lopes directly away from the transmitter. The dust he kicks up scatters sunlight toward the TV. Jack seems to be going down a slope away from the Rover, but probably isn't.
123:02:50|ALSJ|CDR|The TV camera was mounted about chest high (about 45 inches), so it's hard to say if that has any effect on your impression. Maybe it's just difficult to get a perspective on the surface. You don't have anything familiar to help you get a reference. For example, if you've got a little rise in front of you, it can be hard to tell that the ground drops away beyond it. You see a hill, you see a massif; but you don't have anything like a road disappearing to tell you that there's a drop off in between. You don't have trees to show you the slopes. You can't tell where a local horizon ends, except for where it makes a line on something in the distance and, on the Moon, there aren't a lot of times when those lines are obvious. It's just difficult.
123:03:31|ALSJ||Jack stops and looks back.
123:03:34|ALSJ||As we will discover at 123:28:18 and following, this is actually a piece of foam packing which protected the Rover high-gain antenna or some other piece of equipment during the trip from Earth. Ever since Gene discarded the pieces of foam near the LM, gas trapped in the foam lattice has been heating in the sunlight. Evidently, at some time since then, one or more pieces exploded and/or vented, throwing at least one fragment the hundred meters out to the SEP site.
123:04:02|ALSJ||Jack drops the antenna on the ground, and heads back toward the transmitter. Gene's picture is AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20436"@alsjt>20436</a>.
123:04:20|ALSJ|LMP|The Principle Investigator must have loved this statement. The picture was supposed to document the way you left things, not the way they were before you made some final adjustments.
123:04:42|ALSJ||Jack arrives at the transmitter, having made a three second stop along the way. The distance is 35 meters and Jack covered it in 37 seconds.
123:05:17|ALSJ||Jack re-positions the transmitter by picking it up and setting it down again.
123:05:18|ALSJ||Jack takes a bag off of Gene's camera bracket. It is not obvious why Gene couldn't get a bag. Whatever the reason, this bit of action gives Jack a chance to look at the "Sample".
123:05:40|ALSJ||Bob is apologizing for the interruption.
123:05:47|ALSJ||Jack continues leveling the transmitter; Gene goes to the Rover, closing the sample bag as he goes to put it in his footpan.
123:05:59|ALSJ|LMP|I remember thinking that it was a piece of foam and that Gene was pulling a joke on the scientists by putting it in a sample bag. So I was going along with the joke, not realizing that he was serious in thinking it was a piece of brown glass.
123:06:01|ALSJ||A photo of the LM will, from the size and orientation of the LM image, give a very accurate indication of Gene's location - 150 meters east and slightly north of the LM. Jack raises the SEP solar panels.

123:06:32|ALSJ||Jack is unfolding - in book fashion - two solar panels, each about 1 foot square and one on each side of the similar-sized central panel.
123:06:59|ALSJ||A photo ( @alsjurl/a17/a17HSK_Video_NevEyre.jpg"@alsjt>103k</a> taken at about this point at the Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station shows Video Tech Nevil Eyre adjusting the signal being sent to Australia's Overseas Telecommunications Commission terminal in Oxford Street, Paddington (Sydney) for transmission onward. Ken Glover believes that the photo was taken at the point where Gene says 'Boo. Boo.', above. Jack can be seen on the monitors deploying the SEP transmitter. Bear Mountain is in the distance.

123:07:43|ALSJ||The panels are not lying flat but, rather, the two outside ones are folded slightly upward.
123:08:01|ALSJ|LMP|There were some wires on the back of the solar panels which hadn't straightened out but, rather, were causing the panels to flop forward.
123:08:36|ALSJ||Fendell is panning the TV and finds both of them at Gene's Rover seat; they leave the field-of-view before Fendell can stop the camera. With the astronauts out of the way, Fendell gets a good view of the shadowing on the Sculptured Hills.
123:08:36|ALSJ|CDR|I could tear the tape with my hands. For some reason, this is one of the things I still remember clearly after nearly twenty years.
123:09:54|ALSJ||Jack checks the taping job just before they drive off for the EVA-2 traverse. Early in EVA-3, he takes AS17-141-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21510"@alsjt>21510</a>, which shows the transmitter from the back. A magnified detail of A @alsjurl/a17/a17det21510.jpg"@alsjt>magnified detail</a> shows the two pieces of tape Jack used on the back of the solar panels to keep them open. Note that the ends of each piece haven't stuck to the panels because of the dust they picked up from Gene's and Jack's gloves. The center of each piece has stuck because they were able to keep it sufficiently dust free.
123:10:57|ALSJ||Fendell finishes his pan and returns his attention to the transmitter. The solar panels are now open; the tape seems to be along the top.
123:11:07|ALSJ||Gene holds Jack's hand so that he can do a deep knee bend without quite kneeling.
123:11:24|ALSJ|LMP|What I think I was trying to say here is that, when I was taking something off the SEP, it lifted the box off the ground.
123:11:28|ALSJ||Gene helps Jack get up.
123:12:40|ALSJ||Fendell pans to Jack, who is jogging toward the LM.
123:13:07|ALSJ||The boulder appears to be 3-4 meters across but is mostly buried, with only perhaps 20 cm above ground. Jack let's himself fall forward so he can lean on the boulder.
123:13:07|ALSJ|LMP|I put my hands on the boulder and just leaned on it. That let me get my eyes about a foot or a foot and a half from the rock so that I could look at the minerals.
123:13:07|ALSJ|CDR|Without the scoop or something else to give you leverage, you could still get up from your knees using a 'stand-up kip'. Here, Jack pushed back off the rock to get his PLSS over his knees and then jumped up and kicked his feet forward. It's all center-of-gravity management. And, since you're in one-sixth gravity, you can push yourself up easy enough and sometimes jump to get weight off your feet so you can bring them under you. It would have been a lot harder to do that in one g.
123:13:07|ALSJ||TV off.
123:14:17|ALSJ||The big bag is a long version of the SCB which has been hanging from the MESA.
123:14:47|ALSJ||The SRC is the Sample Return Container, a metal rock box which has a high-tech vacuum seal to protect samples from cabin gases and other sources of contamination. Only one rock box will be filled per EVA.
123:15:10|ALSJ||During the drive back to the LM, Gene takes two pictures; AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20447"@alsjt>20447</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20448"@alsjt>20448</a>. These are the last pictures taken during this first EVA.
123:17:14|ALSJ||During the traverses, the radiator on the top of the SEP is normally covered with thermal blankets held down by pieces of Velcro glued to tabs on the covers and to the @alsjurl/a17/a17experiment_sep_en.jpg"@alsjt>thermal bag</a> enclosing the body of the SEP receiver. The glue holding the Velcro on the thermal bag has failed and the covers are now loose.
123:18:09|ALSJ||Jack was scheduled to use a drive tube at Station 1, but didn't for lack of time.
123:18:25|ALSJ||TV on. Gene has parked the Rover roughly between the LM and the U.S. flag.
123:20:03|ALSJ||@alsjurl/Fendell-Bio.pdf"@alsjt>Fendell</a> pans to Jack, who is at his Rover seat. After all the samples are transferred to SCB-1, Gene will put it in the SRC.
123:20:31|ALSJ||Gene joins Jack, who is putting samples from under his seat into SCB-1.
123:20:44|ALSJ||This is the sample Gene collected during the Rover deployment at 117:35:27.
123:21:02|ALSJ||That is, dust makes things ten times worse.
123:21:06|ALSJ||Jack reaches across the Rover to get the sample from Gene, who has now moved to his own side.
123:21:10|ALSJ||Jack means "SCB-1" rather than SRC-1. Some of the Sample Collection Bags have built-in, interior core-tube sleeves.
123:21:36|ALSJ||Gene has come around the front of the Rover; Jack hands him SCB-1, which he takes to the MESA.
123:22:11|ALSJ||Jack joins Gene at the MESA. Jack gets a long, white, cloth bag out of the MESA and goes toward the ladder. This is a transport bag for the deepcore stems.
123:22:38|ALSJ||The SRC seal consists of a knife-edge closure on the rim of the lower section of the box which, when the SRC is closed, digs into a soft, indium strip set in the lid. When the box was packed in Houston, a protective cover made of Teflon cloth was fitted into the box. The cover was fitted on a wire frame that would just barely fit into the box and, therefore, would stay put. The cover had a large opening in the middle to give Gene access to the interior of the box and flaps on all four sides which, at the beginning of the EVA, Gene unfolded and laid on top of the knife edge and the indium strip so that they would stay reasonably clean. Gene is removing that cover and, as well, a Teflon spacer which was installed in Houston to keep the knife edge from cutting into the indium strip prior to this final sealing of the box. Once he removes the cover - called the "skirt" on cuff checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17eva1CDR-35.jpg"@alsjt>CDR-35</a> - and the spacer, Gene makes a final check to make sure that none of the sample bags will catch in the seal when he closes the lid. On some of the prior missions, bags that caught in the seal created leaks and, when the samples were examined in Houston, they were found to be contaminated with cabin and/or terrestrial gases.
123:23:24|ALSJ||Table 9-II gives EMU consumable status for EVAs @alsjurl/a17/a17mrp9-6.jpg"@alsjt>1, 2</a>, and @alsjurl/a17/a17mrp9-7.jpg"@alsjt>3</a>. Both Jack and Gene will consistently use more oxygen and cooling water than predicted pre-flight, but will end each EVA with comfortable margins.
123:23:30|ALSJ||Gene goes to the Rover; Jack is working just beyond the ladder.
123:24:19|ALSJ||Gene is standing between the TV and the LM while he dusts the battery cover.
123:25:06|ALSJ||Jack is thinking of fecal containment bags. Upon reflection, Jack and Gene both believe that the @alsjurl/nasm05758.jpg"@alsjt>containment bags</a> Jack is now stowing in the ETB were later put around the SCBs to help with dust control. According to the Lunar Surface Procedures document (<a href="a17lsp-HSI208994.pdf"@alsjt>36 Mb PDF</a>), the six "@alsjurl/nasm10113.jpg"@alsjt>sample containment bags</a>" stowed in the MESA are distinct from the six "sample collection bags (SCBs)" stowed on the geopallet. Photos of containment bags in the National Air &amp; Space collection courtesy Allan Needell.
123:25:25|ALSJ||When they are in the Command Module, they have regularly scheduled exercise periods to help counteract the effects of weightlessness.
123:26:49|ALSJ||Gene leaves the field-of-view; Fendell examines the top of the LM.
123:26:49|ALSJ|LMP|Although we still called it the ALSEP in the checklists, this was really a new piece of equipment which, among other things, had a two-year design life rather than the one-year life of the prior units.
123:26:13|ALSJ||That is, he doesn't want the Rover to fail because a battery or some other critical piece of equipment overheats.
123:27:05|ALSJ||As Fendell moves the TV camera, The @alsjurl/a17/a17experiment_sep_en.jpg"@alsjt>SEP receiving antenna</a> is briefly visible above Jack's seat. Jack is starting page LMP-36.
123:28:06|ALSJ||Fendell finds Jack at Gene's side of the Rover. The SRB can be seen in AS17-143-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21924"@alsjt>21924</a>, a charge "locator" that Jack will take at the end of EVA-3 at 169:12:57.
123:28:18|ALSJ||Beyond Jack's head, a piece of debris is visible moving north and away from the LM.
123:28:42|ALSJ||Another piece of foam packing has exploded because of sunlight heating of trapped gas bubbles.
123:28:49|ALSJ||Fendell pans to Gene at Jack's seat; he is holding the dustbrush.
123:28:51|ALSJ||Gene is beginning to realize that the piece of "brown glass" he picked up at the SEP site at @alsjurl/a17/a17.trvlm1.html#1230325"@alsjt>123:03:25</a> was actually a piece of foam.
123:29:30|ALSJ||Evidently, some of the interior voids in the Styrofoam were still filled with gas, despite many days of exposure to vacuum during the trip out from Earth. Alternatively, the voids may have been filling with gases released from the foam matrix during the six hours or so that it has been lying out in the sunlight. In either case, solar heating has raised the pressure of the trapped gases. The fact that several fragments can be seen - coupled with Gene's use of the word "exploded" and John Young's phrase "blew up" - indicates an explosive disintegration of a piece of foam. Such explosions would propel fragments over considerable distances. For example, if a piece was launched at a 45 degree angle at a speed of 15.6 meters per second, it would come down 150 meters from the LM after a 13.6 second flight. It is also possible that the piece Gene picked up at the SEP site got there in several hops, each the result of a separate explosion or of a non-explosive venting episode.
123:29:30|ALSJ||Fendell pans to Jack at Gene's seat, packing maps, cameras, and film magazines into the ETB.
123:30:17|ALSJ||Jack is loading film magazines into the ETB.
123:30:49|ALSJ||Young lost a fender during the second Apollo 16 EVA, in much the same fashion. Ron Creel has provided a summary ( @alsjurl/LRV_Fender_Extensions.pdf"@alsjt>1.3 Mb PDF</a> ) of the fender extension losses that occurred on all three Rover missions.
123:31:07|ALSJ||In Houston, there is a discussion going on to the effect that re-attaching the fender is difficult enough unsuited, and probably impossible in a suit.
123:31:20|ALSJ||Jack is packing film magazines and loose rocks in the ETB; he briefly examines one of the rocks or one of the film magazines.
123:31:20|ALSJ||There is no mention of taking brushes up to the cabin on @alsjurl/a17/a17.eva1_lmp36.gif"@alsjt>LMP-36</a>, the page devoted to packing the ETB. Loss of the fender certainly makes it a good idea.
123:32:09|ALSJ||TV off.
123:32:09|ALSJ||Magazine Hotel - 136/H - is the B&amp;W magazine Jack used during this EVA.
123:32:35|ALSJ||Jack is probably referring to the map clip on the accessory staff. It has held the maps tightly despite the bouncy ride.
123:32:35|ALSJ||The maps are printed on stiff, cronopaque pages with an overhead photograph on one side and, laminated to the back, a contour map. The photos and maps are black and white, generally a fairly dark gray; they probably absorb heat fairly readily and may be delaminating as a result.
123:32:55|ALSJ||What Jack doesn't mention is that he has put the 500-mm camera in the ETB so that he can take some long-lens photos from the cabin. He will report these at @alsjurl/a17/a17.eva1post.html#1270228"@alsjt>127:02:28</a>.
123:33:05|ALSJ||Bob means the previously mentioned "containment bags", which is the designation in the checklist.
123:33:11|ALSJ||This is a hook on the back of the ladder, the one that Jack hung the @alsjurl/a17/a17.eva1prep.html#1153055"@alsjt>scissors</a> on at the start of the EVA.
123:34:49|ALSJ||Don McMillan has provided an animation ( @alsjurl/VLRV-covers.mov"@alsjt>0.8 Mb</a> ) of the battery covers on his Virtual Rover being opened.
123:34:56|ALSJ||Gene decided to leave the SRC on the MESA table, rather than move it to the @alsjurl/alsj-LM-Coord.jpg"@alsjt>plus-Z</a> footpad at the base of the ladder.
123:36:14|ALSJ||Jack is referring to a replacement lithium hydroxide (LiOH) canister for the cabin Environmental Control System (ECS). The canisters remove carbon dioxide from the cabin air and need to be replaced at intervals through the mission. One replacement is @alsjurl/a16/LM11-co3lbl.jpg"@alsjt>stowed behind the ascent engine cover</a> in the cabin, two others are stowed in the MESA. They will take one up to the cabin at the end of EVA-2 and the other at the end of EVA-3. At the moment, Jack is getting EVA Pallet 1 out of the MESA. Jack remembers that the pallet contains their food for the next 24 hours, along with such things as replacement batteries and replacement LiOH canisters for the PLSSs.
123:36:33|ALSJ||Jack is tidying the MESA thermal blankets.
123:36:45|ALSJ||The pins are indicators on the PLSS replacement batteries. The fact that they are green indicates that the batteries are fresh.
123:37:23|ALSJ||Gene is dusting the SEP. Jack has noticed some dust that has gotten under the loose cover.
123:37:23|ALSJ|LMP|Poor Gene. It was just like when you're doing windows and somebody taps from the other side to point out you missed something.
123:37:31|ALSJ||Jack is getting SCB-2 from his seat so that he can take it to the MESA, put the football-sized rock into it, and then carry it and the core-stem bag up to the porch.
123:38:08|ALSJ||The DSEA is the SEP Data Storage Electronics Assembly, which Gene and Jack will remove at the end of EVA-3 and return to Earth for analysis.
123:38:26|ALSJ||@alsjurl/a17/a17-TGE.html"@alsjt>TGE</a> readings could be taken with the instrument on the ground or mounted on the back of the Rover. In the latter case, there had been some concern that movement of the TV camera would spoil the measurements.
123:39:47|ALSJ||They are trying to transfer the football-sized sample from the big bag to SCB-2. The big bag has the same-sized opening as the SCB but has about twice the length.
123:39:47|ALSJ|LMP|I couldn't get a grip on the rock to get it out, and I needed to have Gene hold the bag still.
123:40:16|ALSJ||They've probably turned the big bag over to see if they can shake anything out.
123:40:41|ALSJ||Jack is looking for the sample he collected near the back of the LM at @alsjurl/a17/a17.alsepoff.html#1183110"@alsjt>118:31:10</a> and put in the big bag a moment later. Jack makes another reference to the disappearance of this rock at @alsjurl/a17/a17.clsout2.html#1473611"@alsjt>147:36:11</a> during the EVA-2 close-out. It seems likely that the sample fell out during their current effort to get the football-sized rock out of the big bag.
123:41:40|ALSJ||Jack probably jumps up to the first ladder rung during this interval and then waits for Gene to hand the two bags up to him.
123:42:38|ALSJ|CDR|The longer you work in that suit, the less feeling and dexterity you have in your hands. Your hands try to relax and you tend to drop things. And, if you drop things, they get dusty. If you drop things, you've got to get down and pick them up.
123:42:54|ALSJ||Gene is running down the items on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva1CDR-37.jpg"@alsjt>CDR-37</a>.
123:43:32|ALSJ||The ETB is probably hanging from the lanyard, which is next to the ladder.
123:43:50|ALSJ||Jack is probably on the ground again, having put the core stems and SCB-2 on the porch.
123:43:51|ALSJ||This is a rock under the west or @alsjurl/alsj-LM-Coord.jpg"@alsjt>plus-Z</a> footpad, the one below the ladder.
123:43:58|ALSJ||Gene is probably referring to the @alsjurl/a17/a17-TGE.html"@alsjt>TGE</a>.
123:44:12|ALSJ||This is a hook on the inside of the ladder strut.
123:44:49|ALSJ||They may have dropped the dustbrush.
123:45:31|ALSJ|LMP|You're hands were tired, so it was hard to hold on to the brush; and, in the suit, you couldn't position the brush any old which way you wanted. So you had to keep moving your body to get in position. It was a mess.
123:46:45|ALSJ||Jack doesn't get Gene's @alsjurl/alsj-PLSSOPSantenna.html"@alsjt>(PLSS/OPS) antenna</a> at this point.
123:47:36|ALSJ||This is Gene's first attempt at jumping up to the bottom rung on the ladder.
123:47:49|ALSJ||On Apollo 15, Dave Scott forgot to stow Jim Irwin's antenna at one point, and it broke off when he climbed back in the LM. Fortunately, Scott and Irwin were able to use tape to make an adequate repair.
123:48:29|ALSJ||Gene is on the ladder, above Jack. As Jack cleans Gene's legs, the dirt falls on him.
123:48:31|ALSJ|LMP|The dust issue is one that just has to be addressed. It's going to be the major environmental issue for future missions on both the Moon and Mars. Mars is going to have a different type of dust; but in both cases it's going to require careful thought to design suits that can handle 100 or 200 or 300 EVAs compared with the three that we did.
123:49:58|ALSJ|LMP|Little did we know!
123:53:04|ALSJ||Jack is stomping his boots on a ladder rung.
123:54:04|ALSJ|CDR|We practiced dusting each other in training, but never with any dust or dirt; we just went through the motions.
123:54:51|ALSJ||They've been dusting each other for eleven minutes.
123:55:57|ALSJ|LMP|I don't think I'd actually loaded anything on the pallet. Gene just wanted to make sure nothing had fallen out.
123:56:09|ALSJ|LMP|Gene must have put his visor up so he could see to dust me while we were standing in the LM shadow at the ladder; and then he stepped out into the sunlight.
123:58:11|ALSJ||A bag can be seen hanging from the ladder hook behind the lefthand side of the bottom rung in AS17-134-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20482"@alsjt>20482</a>, which will be taken at the end of EVA-3.
123:58:12|ALSJ|LMP|This a quote from one of Bill Mauldin's more famous World War II @alsjurl/a17/willie.jpg"@alsjt>cartoons</a> in the 'Up Front' collection. Willie and Joe are down in the mud with bullets going over them and that's the caption.
123:58:43|ALSJ|CDR|We could get about 30 seconds of one-sixth gravity flying in the KC-135 aircraft. That was too short for a lot of things and it had been a problem way back in @alsjurl/alsj-GeminiSumConf.html"@alsjt>Gemini</a>. Training underwater was not totally realistic either, but at least it gave you a lot longer duration.
123:58:43|ALSJ|LMP|We practiced getting in a hatch simulator in the KC-135 but that wasn't a static environment and I think it made it easier. There was just a little bit of motion and I think that helped you get through the hatch. And, of course, our hands weren't tired in the 135 and that also made a significant difference.
123:58:57|ALSJ||Jack is crawling into the LM and is getting caught up in Gene's LM hoses. They would be to Jack's right as he goes through the hatch, draped over Gene's handcontroller.
124:00:16|ALSJ||Gene isn't absolutely certain, but thinks that the message was written on a piece of tape on the strut. He thinks he may have put the message there himself. Gene and Jack took a number of photos of the official plaque mounted on the ladder strut. One of these shows all but the top two rungs and there is no piece of tape discernible in a 16x20 inch enlargement. Because a good deal of detail on the official plaque can be seen in this image, I conclude that there was no taped message in this part of the image. At the start of EVA-3, Jack took a picture of the entire forward face of the LM as part of a color pan taken with Gene's camera. The LM image is AS17-140-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21370"@alsjt>21370</a>, but nothing definitive shows up in an enlargement of that image, either.
124:01:17|ALSJ||Gene is opening the top of the @alsjurl/a17/a17-TGE.html"@alsjt>TGE</a> to expose a radiator. The TGE is now sitting in the shade of the LM and will be able to cool during the rest period.
124:02:00|ALSJ||On the early missions, the Lunar Equipment Conveyor (@alsjurl/a11/a11.lec.gif"@alsjt>LEC</a>) was a clothesline-like device used to transfer equipment up to the cabin. Using it was a two-man operation. Beginning with Apollo 14, the astronauts carried at least some equipment up the ladder by hand. Finally, the Apollo 16 crew decided that the clothesline LEC was more trouble than it was worth and carried everything but the ETB up by hand. To raise and lower the ETB, they used a simple hook-and-lanyard, but kept the LEC designation. Gene is using the lanyard-type LEC.
124:02:00|ALSJ|LMP|We used the lanyard to raise and lower the ETB because it had delicate equipment in it, particularly the cameras. It wasn't a rigid bag and, while I don't remember how or when the decision was made, I think we decided that, rather, than sling the ETB around, we'd just hoist it up.
124:02:07|ALSJ||Jack has been emptying the EVA pallet, which he will now push out through the hatch, almost certainly with his foot, so that Gene can discard it.
124:02:15|ALSJ||The sound of Gene beating on his suit with the dustbrush is audible, unless we are hearing him hit his microphone on his neckring as he strains to look down at what he is doing.
124:02:51|ALSJ|CDR|Getting up the ladder was a piece of cake. You pushed up with your legs - just a little spring up - and pulled with your arms.
124:03:27|ALSJ||Gene probably stands the SRC on end to make it easier to grab; then it falls on its side.
124:03:44|ALSJ||Jack is having to bend over as far as he can to grab the equipment as Gene hands it through the hatch. Jack notes that his voice quality suggests that he has his chin bent down so that he can see.
124:03:44|ALSJ|CDR|Even with the hatch open, he couldn't have worked kneeling, because he would have had to have his legs toward the hatch and it would have been hard to reach back and pull things in around his body.
124:03:44|ALSJ|LMP|As Gene handed the stuff in, I probably put it back on the engine cover, although I may have stowed the SRC right away. There were special compartments for each of the SRCs and the SCBs but we may not have stowed those until after we were repressurized.
124:04:05|ALSJ|CDR|Once the deep core was finished it really was a turning point. While we were deploying the ALSEP, we had a fixed set of tasks to do; and removing that core was probably the hardest of them. But after it was finished, then we could settle back into an exploratory mode of operations with a lot more control and choice about what we did.
124:04:22|ALSJ|LMP|From my point of view, the big turning point of the mission didn't come until we'd finished the second EVA. From an operational point of view, which was Gene's perspective, getting the core extracted and the rest of the ALSEP deployed was a major accomplishment; drilling those holes and extracting the core was tough work. But I was frustrated that we were still in the position that, if we had to leave the Moon before we had done another EVA, we wouldn't have had much information about the site. We'd gotten the heat flow experiment deployed so we were going to get confirmation of the Apollo 15 measurement. We had a few samples of the basalt, but had done no systematic sampling. We had the soil in the core, so we probably would have found the black beads; but there's not a lot of orange soil in that valley - it's mostly black - so we might not have had enough orange beads in the core to recognize it's importance. We had put out two seismic charges which, by themselves wouldn't have given us much. We had a few gravimeter readings but no profile across the valley and not enough information to understand the depth of the basalt fill. And, although we didn't know it at this point, the major experiment on the ALSEP, the long-period gravimeter (LSG), wasn't going to work. So, at the end of the first EVA, we were in the scientifically vulnerable position of having gone all the way to the Moon without having gotten very much out of the mission relative to what the potential was. By the time we finished the second EVA, we had a lot of information about the site and, from a scientific point of view, that was the big turning point of the mission. By the end of the second EVA, we had at least half a gravity profile because we'd gone across one contact up onto the South Massif; we had several more seismic charges deployed; and we had done a lot of systematic sampling of the mare basalts, the massif breccias, and the soils.
124:06:00|ALSJ||Jack has been working with the hatch door fully open to his right. He now moves to Gene's station on the left side of the cabin, closes the door far enough so that he can move across to his station on the right and then swing the door open as far as possible against his legs.
124:06:56|ALSJ||As can be seen in the accompanying diagrams, the @alsjurl/LMRHSCutAway.jpg"@alsjt>plus Z-27 bulkhead</a> separates the front the cabin from the back, and is just forward of the ascent engine cover. The plus Z-27 bulkhead is also the front face of what is called the @alsjurl/alsj-LM-Midstep.html"@alsjt>midstep</a>.
124:06:56|ALSJ|CDR|By this time, I was really tired and it was a lot of trouble to get back in the cabin. It's such a small space; and you've got to twist and turn to get in there. You've got to crawl in with that big PLSS on your back until you hit the back bulkhead with your helmet. Then you've got to start arching your back so that you can get your head up so that you can get further in. But you've got to keep the PLSS clear of the DSKY, so that means really arching your back. Then you push with your feet until you're in and you can stand up and then turn around. And it didn't help that a lot of space, particularly on the engine cover, was taken up by the boxes and bags we'd brought in from the surface. It was really crowded.
124:07:36|ALSJ|LMP|While you were arching your back, trying to keep your PLSS from hitting the DSKY, you really had to be careful not to scratch your visor on the back bulkhead any more than absolutely necessary. Gene may have had more trouble getting in than I did, simply because he is a longer person, even though, for the same reason, he didn't have as much trouble getting his back arched. Certainly he was tired - we both were - and it was only prudent for me to help him. You didn't want to bang that DSKY any more than you absolutely had to.
124:08:49|ALSJ|CDR|With two guys standing there, relatively immobile and wearing PLSSs, there wasn't a lot of room to bend over to look at the hatch opening for things that might keep you from getting a good seal. So you leaned back to get a look at it. It was important to get a good seal the first time, because otherwise you'd have to go through the whole procedure again.
124:08:49|ALSJ|LMP|You would probably blow the hatch seal clean if you depressed again, but you certainly didn't want to lose all that pressurization oxygen.
124:08:56|ALSJ||Jack may be kicking the hatch partially shut to get it out of the way. They will actually close and latch the @alsjurl/forward_hatch.jpg"@alsjt>hatch</a> at 124:10:44.
124:09:23|ALSJ||The two feedwater tanks are hooked up in series. The auxiliary tank was added to the PLSS for Apollo 15 and subsequent missions. Apparently, it was easier to add a second tank to the design than to enlarge the existing tank.
124:10:28|ALSJ||Closing the hatch is a difficult job in an inflated suit. Gene needs Jack to get back against the right-hand side circuit breaker panel so that he, Gene, can reach down to close the hatch.
124:10:59|ALSJ|CDR|To get the hatch closed and latched, you had to lean forward and sideways and close it by feel. The instrument panel stuck out about a foot into the cabin and you just couldn't see under it while you were closing the hatch. Then, once I got back up, I could lean back and see it was closed, and as Jack could, too. All of this was necessary because we were really constrained by weight; the LM had to be as lightweight as possible and we couldn't afford a lot of volume in the spacecraft. If we'd had more room and a little bigger hatch, all of this would have been a lot easier and have gone a lot faster.
124:11:17|ALSJ||Gene is reaching up and behind to his right to close the overhead dump valve.
124:11:45|ALSJ||In the Auto position, the @alsjurl/DumpValve.html"@alsjt>dump valve</a> will open if the cabin pressure exceeds 5.4 psi.
124:11:49|ALSJ||Having turned the PLSS water pump off, they verify that the warning signals are working properly.
124:11:57|ALSJ||If the PLSS oxygen supply in either suit was less than ten percent, they would have to do a manual cabin repressurization, watching the suit pressure gauge to make sure the suit maintained positive pressure.
124:12:39|ALSJ||Jack will set the cabin repressurization valve so that, when he closes the corresponding circuit breaker, repressurization will begin and, when the cabin is up to 5 psi, the valve will close automatically.
124:12:58|ALSJ||Gene is turning to make sure that the Cabin Warning light has come on.
124:13:19|ALSJ||The pressure regulators are now set to keep the cabin pressure at 4.8 psi.
124:13:40|ALSJ||The EVA ends when the cabin pressure reaches 3.5 psi. Although the PLSS oxygen is off, without intervention, the suits would deflate relatively slowly. To hasten suit deflation, once the cabin pressure is significant, they can open the purge valves.
124:13:57|ALSJ||The sound of repressurization ends abruptly.
124:14:11|ALSJ||That is, he has opened the purge valve and his suit is virtually deflated.
124:14:20|ALSJ||Jack is verifying that the circuit breakers and switches marked with white dots and EVA decals are in the same, powerdown configuration they were in prior to the start of the EVA.
124:14:23|ALSJ|CDR|Your hands just get so tired and sore, both from the work of squeezing your gloves around things all day and from the constant chafing. I wound up with blisters all over my hands, particularly between the thumb and the forefinger.
124:14:57|ALSJ||They are turning on the fans and a fan sensor in the Environmental Control System (ECS) Suit Circuit.
124:15:03|ALSJ||This indicates, as expected, that the Suit Circuit Water Separator is not yet up to speed.
124:15:12|ALSJ||It is a great relief to get the gloves off.
124:15:48|ALSJ||It is now eight hours and fifteen minutes since they started to get Jack's PLSS on, and it will be another forty-five minutes until they are both out of their suits. Preparations for the next EVA will take even longer, since they will have to start with suit donning.
124:16:20|ALSJ|LMP|I had been aware from the experience of previous crews that you could get rough or damaged finger tips and that your fingernails could lift right off the quick as a result of constantly reaching in the suit and getting a little bit of grabbing from the rubber bladder. Knowing that, I wore some nylon liners and also kept my fingernails clipped down as far as possible to delay the process. But, ultimately, all my nails were lifted off the quick and I can remember seeing blood under Gene's fingernails. There was nothing much else you could do about it; it was just a continuous, traumatic soreness which faded into the background.
124:16:20|ALSJ||NASA photo @alsjurl/a17/ap17-S72-56081.jpg"@alsjt>S72-56081</a> shows the crew preparing to cut a cake aboard the recovery carrier, Ticonderoga. Note the blood under the nails of Jack's middle and ring fingers.
124:16:20|ALSJ||A @alsjurl/a17/ap17-72-H-1561crop.jpg"@alsjt>detail</a> from NASA photo @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#72H1561"@alsjt>72-H-1561</a> taken on-board Ticonderoga shows signs of bleeding under the nail of the little finger on Gene's right hand and, possibly, under the nail on the middle finger.
124:16:43|ALSJ|LMP|Other than the times when I was talking to Gene or when Bob had asked a specific question, I don't think I was talking to anyone so much as I was dictating - particularly about the geology, providing a verbal set of field notes that I realized that I or others would be using. So I'm surprised that, even under those circumstances, we had a subconscious avoidance of profanity. Gene would occasionally use his "Manischewitz" as a substitute and I used "Oh, shoot" here and probably used other things on occasion. And I think it was characteristic of each of the crews. They all pretty much avoided profanity except on Apollo 16 when they accidentally had their mikes keyed when they were talking about the orange juice and on Apollo 10 when they had that startling experience with the jets firing when they weren't expected to.
124:17:52|ALSJ||They have their visor assemblies (@alsjurl/alsj-LEVA.html"@alsjt>LEVAs</a>) off, but still have their helmets on.
124:19:53|ALSJ||They have just removed their helmet and, as did previous crews, notice that the dust in the air smells like burnt gunpowder. There is enough dust in the air to smell, but not enough to see.
124:20:00|ALSJ||Gene is refering to his @alsjurl/alsj-DrinkFood.html"@alsjt>in-suit drink bag</a>.
124:20:00|ALSJ|CDR|I ran out late in the EVA, so it wasn't a problem.
124:20:13|ALSJ||They are opening the descent stage water supply, having turned it off prior to the EVA. This will provide cooling and drinking water until they get out of the suits.
124:20:47|ALSJ||Twenty years after the event, neither Gene nor Jack remembers what this was about. In 1997, Journal Contributor Brian Lawrence suggested that Jack's purge valve popped out, as a result of residual pressure in the suit, just before Gene's "Good shot." at 124:20:33.
124:21:31|ALSJ||They are directing the flow of Suit Circuit oxygen into the cabin via the LM oxygen hoses.
124:22:03|ALSJ||By setting the suit diverter valve to the horizontal position, they will direct some of the oxygen flow - once they get the LM hoses hooked up - into the torso, which will help dry the suits.
124:22:13|ALSJ||These are @alsjurl/alsj-RCU.html"@alsjt>RCU</a> switches for the PLSS oxygen fan and the PLSS LCG water pump. Astronaut Joe Allen joins the conversation as CapCom.
124:22:54|ALSJ||They are turning their @alsjurl/alsj-RCU.html"@alsjt>RCU</a> Communications Mode Selector switches to the "O" (Off) position. The accompanying @alsjurl/rcu_top.jpeg"@alsjt>photograph</a> shows the top of the RCU, with the front being up. The Mode Select switch is at the right and has four round cut-outs. The second cut-out from the right is larger than the other three and shows the selected communications mode, in this case "AR". The "O" mode is the next position to the right.
124:22:57|ALSJ||Houston is waiting to re-acquire the Command Module, now on its 19th orbit. They expect that Evans went to sleep during this Farside pass.
124:26:26|ALSJ|CDR|We wanted to get all of the housekeeping chores out of the way as soon as we could. Charging the PLSSs let us get them stowed - on the walls, I think - so that we'd have more room.
124:26:26|ALSJ||The LMP PLSS oxygen recharge is at the bottom of the left-hand column of @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf3-2.jpg"@alsjt>Surface 3-2</a>.
124:33:01|ALSJ||Long Comm Break as they recharge Gene's PLSS. Jack's PLSS now has 95 percent load of oxygen. They will top off the oxygen in both PLSSs at about 126:20, after their eat period.
124:39:44|ALSJ||There is, of course, only one recharge hose.
124:39:44|ALSJ||During this period they doff their OPSs and PLSSs and perform the @alsjurl/A15-17EMUv2Sec4.2.1.jpg"@alsjt>OPS checkout</a>.
124:48:21|ALSJ||Each of the OPSs contains two spherical oxygen bottles, each about eight inches in diameter. The high pressure in these - about 6000 psi - and in the PLSS bottles is necessary for the storage of significant amounts of oxygen in such small volumes.
124:48:21|ALSJ||The following exchanges were recorded during a change-of-shift press briefing and times are not available from the Public Affairs tape. During this period, they are changing PLSS batteries and LiOH canisters. The used items are placed in the @alsjurl/alsj-JettBag.html"@alsjt>jettison bag</a> for disposal at the start of the next EVA. They are now on <a href="a17LMLunarSurf3-3.jpg"@alsjt>Surface 3-3</a>.
124:58:01|ALSJ||The lithium hydroxide canister is a 6-inch diameter cylinder which lies horizontally across the two-foot width of the PLSS. The crew has removed the fabric thermal-covering from the PLSS in order to remove the used can and install a new one. The primary purpose of the LiOH can is the removal of carbon dioxide.
124:58:01|ALSJ||That is, a cold beer.
124:59:55|ALSJ||Now they are changing batteries and the canister on Jack's PLSS.
125:07:30|ALSJ||They have finished with Jack's PLSS and are now weighing and stowing samples.
125:15:56|ALSJ||The crew has a small spring scale which gives them terrestrial weights. That is, on Earth, a two-pound (Earth-weight) rock would register twelve pounds on the scale while, on the Moon, it would register two pounds. The actual weight of rocks collected during this EVA is given in the Mission Report as 31 pounds (14 kg). The 48-pound (21.8 kg) total given here includes the weights of the individual sample bags, the two 1.7 pound (0.8 kg) SCBs, and the 14.7 pound (6.7 kg) SRC. Weights are measured so that the flight engineers can adjust the stowage for center-of-mass control, if necessary.
125:17:09|ALSJ||They are heating the urine line so that, when they empty the urine out of the bladders in their suits, it won't freeze before reaching the sump in the descent stage.
125:21:51|ALSJ||They have finished the last of the tasks on @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf3-3.jpg"@alsjt>Surface 3-3</a>.
125:24:12|ALSJ||They have completed the @alsjurl/alsj-WasteFluids.html"@alsjt>urine dump</a> and are getting @alsjurl/alsj-A7LDonDoff.html"@alsjt>Gene out of his suit</a>. After they get his suit off, he will clean the hose connections and the neck and wrist rings, and lubricate the zippers. Then they will lay the suit on the ascent engine cover, cover the legs with a @alsjurl/alsj-JettBag.html"@alsjt>jettison bag</a> to keep the dust down, and attach the LM oxygen hose to dry the suit out.
126:10:18|ALSJ||Gene's means both sides of the cabin and, therefore, both he and Jack.
126:10:29|ALSJ||Gene sounds tired. He and Jack have been awake since 105:47 or nearly 20 1/2 hours.
126:10:29|ALSJ||Jack will wear biomedical sensors through the sleep period.
126:11:14|ALSJ|CDR|The sensors itched, and it was just generally irritating to have them on. We had learned to put them on ourselves, so that we could take them off when we could.
126:12:24|ALSJ||At the bottom of @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf3-5.jpg"@alsjt>Surface 3-5</a>, there is a notation to verify that one hour has elapsed since the initial oxygen recharge before starting the top-off. They finished the initial recharges at 124:39, well over an hour ago.
126:12:24|ALSJ|LMP|My guess is that you did an initial charge and then let things stabilize - let the oxygen cool or the tank relax - and then you topped it off.
126:12:24|ALSJ||Deke Slayton joins the conversation.
126:15:31|ALSJ||Because of the launch delay, a decision was made to reset mission clocks to give time relative to the planned launch time of 0253 GMT 7 December 1972. It is currently 0308 CST 12 December 1972 in Houston.
126:17:39|ALSJ|CDR|It was just an unacceptable situation. Imagine, a little thing like knocking a Rover fender off having the potential of compromising the rest of our mission. I still have no doubt that we had to find a fix. If we hadn't, then at bare minimum it probably would have taken thirty to forty percent of our time to consciously keep the dust off of the Rover, the tools, and the rest of the equipment. We wouldn't have been able to drive as fast, we would have had to spend a lot more time dusting.
126:17:39|ALSJ|CDR|I was concerned in the sense that I knew that we had to find a fix; but I was also confident that we'd find one. I knew that the ground was going to be working on a fix, but I was also responsible for the mission on our end and I was going to think about the problem, too. I'm the guy on the scene; I'm the guy who's got to actually fix the fender. The help we got from the ground was tremendous. They knew exactly what we had in the LM and were able to try out things during the night. But they were a quarter million miles away and I was going to have to do the fixing. So I spent some time, including while I was lying in the @alsjurl/a12/a12.hammocks.jpg"@alsjt>hammock</a>, thinking the problem through.
126:17:39|ALSJ|CDR|Before the mission, probably no one could have believed that losing a fender could have been that serious. But, if that had been an unmanned vehicle, dependent on the radiator for cooling and a clean TV lens for scientific exploration, you might have been out of business. Of course, maybe you could say that if we hadn't been there, it wouldn't have gotten knocked off; but even an unmanned vehicle can lose a fender by going too close to a rock or something.
126:17:39|ALSJ|LMP|As I recall, my perspective on the fender was that it wasn't a big deal; primarily because I had worked those kind of problems between EVAs on other missions. As Gene implies here, there are an infinite number of things that you can do to fix a problem; and that was the tradition of the whole ground support effort. You've got a problem? You go work on it and you fix it. And, so, I wasn't going to worry about it. I never imagined that they weren't going to come up with a solution. The only thing that bothered me - and I do remember thinking about this - was that the fix was going to eat up time out of the second EVA. As you may have noticed, Gene talked about the fender frequently but I never even responded to him, being busy with other things. So, obviously, it wasn't a big concern in my mind.
126:17:39|ALSJ||Dave Ballard provides the following account of what has been going on in Houston to come up with a fix. "It was Terry Neal from the Apollo 17 Flight Crew Support Team who put together the scheme and the procedures to rig the fix for the rover fender. I was the A17 Flight Crew Support Team leader and had no direct role in that effort. Our team guys needed no direction or supervision in these type of activities - they knew what was needed and did it! "It just so happens Terry and I were chuckling over this old war story at John Young's JSC retirement party this past December (2004). What happened -in summary - was that Terry went right over to the JSC rover and luner module mock-up because it was obvious a fix was necessary. Since Terry was the A17 Luner Module Crew System's Engineer, there was no one more knowledgable or capable of understanding what was at hand on board the spacecraft to be utilized for the repair. Using the fully stowed mockup's equipment, Terry developed the scheme using - and I may not be completely acurrate on each piece - some combination of clamps, tape, flight data file covers,etc. He passed the procedures over to the EVA procedures guys and they worked a suited-crewman exercise with John Young for verification. Then the procedure was sent up to the crew and the rest is history. However, here's the rest of the story: Post flight, John (and maybe some others) got a big NASA award for this effort - no mention of Terry Neal! This was a common thing - nobody took it very serious. To this day, every time John Young sees Terry Neal, he says, as only John can, 'I'm going to get you an award, Terry'. Thirty some odd years later John still remembers and respects the person who did the real work."
126:17:39|ALSJ||Ron Creel has provided a summary ( @alsjurl/LRV_Fender_Extensions.pdf"@alsjt>1.3 Mb PDF</a> ) of the fender extension losses that occurred on all three Rover missions.
126:18:50|ALSJ||Both Jack and Joe grew up in small towns: Jack in Silver City, New Mexico, and Joe in Crawfordsville, Indiana. According to Allen, in the late 40's, it was the height of automotive fashion - at least among teenagers in small-town America, to hang white mudflaps behind the wheels of a Ford or Chevy sedan. It didn't matter, Allen says, what color the car was - the flaps had to be white.
126:19:15|ALSJ|LMP|This was just a bit of small talk between two people who grew up in small towns, two people who carried on a lot of small talk.
126:20:06|ALSJ|LMP|The second charge procedure probably came out of people trying to push as much time into an EVA as possible for the J-missions. Probably somebody did a little experiment and realized that they could get another half-hour's worth or something like that. The whole J-mission or Block 2 effort was to extend capabilities over what had been possible on Apollo 11 and the other H-missions. Apollo 15 had originally been scheduled as an H-mission and Scott worked very hard to fly a Block 2 LM.
126:20:06|ALSJ||In 1967, NASA drew up a list of mission-types which would lead up to the first landing. "A" missions were unmanned, earth-orbital tests of the Saturn V and the Command-and-Service Module. "B" missions were unmanned, orbital tests of the LM. "C" missions were manned, earth-orbital tests of the CSM. Apollo 7 was a C mission. And the added Apollo 8 lunar orbit flight became a C-Prime mission. "D" missions were earth-orbital tests of the CSM/LM combination (Apollo 9). "E" missions were to have been CSM/LM missions to high-earth orbit and none of these were ever flown. "F" missions were full dress rehearsals in lunar orbit (Apollo 10). The "G" mission (Apollo 11) was the initial landing; and "H" missions were follow-on landing missions. By 1969, NASA was hard at work on significant LM upgrades which would allow three-day stays on the Moon supported by a Roving vehicle. These became the "J" missions. "I" missions were lunar-orbit-only science missions, none of which were ever flown.
126:20:31|ALSJ||Gene is sounding a bit more alert.
126:21:24|ALSJ|CDR|Listening to these conversations (that) we had once we were back in the LM, out of the suits, and relaxed is kind of a nostalgic experience. For me, it's really, really interesting to listen to this and it really brings back a lot of things that passed by so fast at the time. This is the first chance I've had in almost twenty years to go back and think about the details of some of these things, despite the fact that I see Joe Allen and Bob Parker maybe two or three times a month.
126:22:51|ALSJ||This list of lift-off times begins with Command Module orbit 21.
126:25:29|ALSJ||Jack is also sounding a bit refreshed.
126:25:35|ALSJ||This is a reference to the fact that Bob began his career as an astronomer, not a geologist.
126:25:53|ALSJ||Allen is also a scientist-astronaut, trained in physics.
126:25:56|ALSJ||Bob sounds congested and tired.
126:27:05|ALSJ|CDR|One of the things I was expecting to hear myself comment on was the fact that any time you traveled east - particularly on that first day when the Sun was so low - you just couldn't see very well and just had to go slower.
126:28:10|ALSJ||That is, there is plenty of material in the way to absorb the flux of neutrons produced by the RTG and, thereby, keep contamination of the measurement of the natural background to a minimum.
126:30:42|ALSJ||Grain size is an indicator of cooling rate and the coarse-grain character of the gabbros suggests that they cooled more slowly than most of the mare basalts brought back by the other crews. Because material at the surface cools most rapidly, where heat radiates away, and then more slowly as one goes deeper in a flow, one would normally think of coarse-grained samples as having come from a relatively deep portion of a flow and that one should also find finer-grained rocks derived from the upper parts. During a final review of the manuscript, Jack Schmitt suggested that one possible explanation for the absence of fine-grain rocks is that they had been pulverized during the process of regolith formation. Journal Contributor David Harland adds, "As an aside, the fact that the coarse stuff was also vesicular indicates that it formed near the top of the flow. Bear in mind Jack's observations that (1) the coarse stuff was rather lighter in color than he expected, and so was probably higher in plagioclase than usual, and (2) that the flow had probably cooled sufficiently slowly for there to be vertical differentation - the plage rising to enrich the surficial material - and you have another piece of evidence that there may not have been very much fine-grained material in the flow.
126:33:00|ALSJ||Bob is asking if the outcrops line up - hence his use of the word "linear" - and, if they do line up, whether they make a horizontal layer or a slightly tilted (hence "subhorizontal") layer.
126:33:25|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Ulli Lotzmann notes that the 10x40 monocular was manufactured by Leitz, Germany, and modified by NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) Houston.
126:35:09|ALSJ||Bob is referring to the lineations Gene had described on Bear Mountain after the landing.
126:35:30|ALSJ|CDR|Because of the low Sun on that first day - and it was a lot better on the second and third days - it wasn't at all easy to look at the Sculptured Hills and see any detail. They were about 20 or 30 degrees north of east and the glare was just too strong.
126:36:13|ALSJ|LMP|Somebody at the USGS - or maybe it was Jim Head - noticed that, in contrast to some of the other hills, they had a knobby appearance and said 'Hey, they look like somebody sculptured them'. So they became the Sculptured Hills.
126:36:43|ALSJ||They never did see an obvious scar. In the 100 million years since the slide, impacts and downhill movement of debris have erased and covered the source area on the mountain.
126:38:40|ALSJ|LMP|The instrumentation identified the signals from each of the geophones by number and, in order to interpret the data, the experimenters had to know where I had deployed each one of them.
126:40:24|ALSJ||The pitch/roll scale fell off during Apollo 16 but, because a modification of the already-built Apollo 17 indicator would have been difficult and the Apollo 16 crew had had no difficulty in estimating the attitude of their Rover, no change had been made.
126:40:28|ALSJ||Fillets are skirts of soil that pile up at the base of rocks due to small, nearby impacts that splash soil against the sides.
126:41:13|ALSJ||People in the Backroom are trying to find evidence to support interpretations of the Apollo 15 photography that suggest that only the northern half of the valley was covered by the hypothesized dark-mantling process. If it was a process that occurred late in the history of the valley, then there might have been a difference in the degree of covering of the pre-existing boulders.
126:42:04|ALSJ||That is, a good reminder to look for directionality in the filleting.
126:42:15|ALSJ|LMP|Angular boulders have profiles such that you can draw two lines from any point on the rock and the rock will fill the space between them. Subangular is the case where the tip has been rounded off and the rock won't fit between the lines. And "rounded" is the case where you can't draw any fit better than tangents.
126:43:56|ALSJ||The diameter and depth of a crater depend on the impact energy. In places where the regolith is thin, impacts forming relatively small craters would penetrate to bedrock (the subfloor) and dig up blocks.
126:43:57|ALSJ||During crater formation, the ejecta blanket can be described as overturning on the surrounding terrain. Material from near the original surface will be found at the bottom of the ejecta blanket and will be exposed only at relatively great distances from the rim. Material dug out from the greatest depth of penetration will lie on the top on the ejecta blanket, but only at the rim or even on the crater floor.
126:45:01|ALSJ||Gene is beginning to sound tired again.
126:45:34|ALSJ||Station 5 (Camelot Crater) and Station 10 (Sherlock Crater) are planned at the rims of large craters sure to have penetrated deep into the bedrock.
126:46:27|ALSJ||Station 10 is on the route back to the LM from the more northerly stops planned for EVA-3; Emory Crater, the original Station 1, is well to the south and, therefore, would require a substantial detour.
126:47:16|ALSJ|LMP|I was asking them to think about the situation of a fine-grained pyroclastic laid down on the subfloor. What sort of regolith would develop in that situation and what would you expect to find? Obviously I was thinking about it, and I wanted the bright guys on the ground to think about it, too. We eventually proved at Shorty that this is what had happened, but we hadn't been there yet and I was asking what might be unique about a regolith developed on a pyroclastic versus a regolith developed on a basalt flow. I don't think I ever got an answer to the question.
126:48:30|ALSJ||This is a reference to the disturbed reading at 123:56:55. Bob remembers that a 000 readout was an explicit indication that the instrument had been disturbed while a measurement was in progress.
126:49:00|ALSJ||Frank and Stacey O'Brien have provided a view ( @alsjurl/CAM000378.jpg"@alsjt>0.7Mb</a> ) of a RHSSC in a LM simulator taken in 2002 at the Cradle of Aviation Museum. The Right Hand Side Stowage Comparment (RHSSC) is on the lower part of the side bulkhead on the LMP's side of the cabin and consists of four shelves into which various soft stowage bags have been secured. Various other bags are secured to the sides. The set of items shown in the CAM photo undoubtedly differs in detail from the flown set in the Apollo 17 LM.
126:50:06|ALSJ||Gene and Jack had magazines Hotel (or "Helen" as Jack called it when he stowed it under his seat) and Golf ("Gail") out in the ETB at the start of the EVA. During close-out, at 123:31:59 and following, Jack mentioned that he had put Golf in the ETB and Hotel was on the LMP's camera. Jack reported a frame count of 197 on Hotel at @alsjurl/a17/a17.trvlm1.html#1225011"@alsjt>122:50:11</a> but gives 183 below at 126:58:05 and 126:59:20. It will not be used again. Golf is still unused and will be taken out for EVA-2.
126:50:06|ALSJ||They are using ball point pens, rather than pencils, for note taking. The Gold Visor is a gold-electroplated, ultraviolet shield.

127:02:46|ALSJ||Frames @alsjurl/a17/a17pan21991-93.jpg"@alsjt>21991 to 993</a> show the North Massif "@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21991"@alsjt>dark boulder</a>" and its prominent track. As can be seen in Figure @alsjurl/a17/a17psrf6-15.gif"@alsjt>6-15</a> from the Apollo 17 @alsjurl/a17/a17psr.html"@alsjt>Preliminary Science Report</a>, the dark boulder is about 600 meters west and 300 meters north of the Station 6 boulder. The difference in distance from the LM the dark boulder and Station 6 is only about five percent and a @alsjurl/a17/a17LM500DB.gif"@alsjt>comparison</a> of Jack's dark boulder photo from the LM cabin with his picture of the LM from Station 6 gives a good comparison of the relative sizes of the LM and the dark boulder. The LM is about 7 meters tall and, therefore, the large dimension of the dark boulder is about 14 meters. Compare with a 500-mm photo Gene will take of the dark boulder from Station 9, AS17-139- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21255"@alsjt>21255</a>. Station 9 is about 2500 meters from the dark boulder. Five boulders that can serve as markers are labeled in details from both @alsjurl/a17/a17_21991det.jpg"@alsjt>21991</a> and @alsjurl/a17/a17_21255det.jpg"@alsjt>21255</a>.

127:03:15|ALSJ||These photographs were taken through a lens with a 500mm focal length.
127:11:55|ALSJ|CDR|We were probably eating through this thirty-minute period and I remember that it was almost a relief not to have to talk to the ground or answer questions.
127:11:55|ALSJ|LMP|I was hoping they would ask more questions during this eat period. It was an opportunity to chat about the geology. I was tired, but I thought it was a waste of time not to talk. We were on 'push-to-talk' so I don't know what Gene and I were talking about at this point. Probably just the mechanics of eating: 'Do you want this? Or, do you want that?' It was all cold; you couldn't put hot water in it.
127:43:02|ALSJ||They have finished eating and have done second oxygen and water recharges on both PLSSs, They are about to configure the LM for the rest period.
127:43:08|ALSJ||They are going to a high rate of data transmission.
127:43:52|ALSJ|LMP|Battery management meant that you were going to check out all the LM batteries and see if they had the right voltages. And, I think, if you found that some had drawn down more than others, you would equalize them.
127:43:52|ALSJ||Details of the battery management procedure are given on @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf3-6.jpg"@alsjt>Surface 3-6</a>.
127:45:17|ALSJ||Jack is also checking the batteries for the @alsjurl/tnD7141ApPyrotchnc.html"@alsjt>Explosive Devices</a> (ED) which will separate the LM Ascent and Descent Stages just prior to lift-off. The voltages are unchanged from the pre-landing values.
127:46:05|ALSJ||"P00", which is pronounced "pooh", as in Winnie-the-Pooh, is shorthand for Program Zero-Zero.
127:46:05|ALSJ|LMP|P00 was the housekeeping program that allowed the ground to communicate with the computer to not only check out the computer to see how it was doing but also load data.
127:47:21|ALSJ||Jack sounds quite congested; Gene much less so. Jack is the only member of an Apollo surface crew to show an allergic reaction to the dust.
127:47:21|ALSJ|LMP|After I took my helmet off after the first EVA, I had a significant reaction to the dust; my turbinates ('cartilaginous plates in the walls of the nasal chambers') became swollen. And that went away by the next morning - except for a little bit of residual - and never came back again. Nobody's ever explained that to me.
127:48:12|ALSJ|LMP|Before the quarantines were lifted, there were a lot of people in the Lunar Receiving Lab exposed to lunar dust when they shouldn't have been. I'm afraid that the geologists didn't really believe in the quarantines and they honored them only in the breech for the most part.
127:48:58|ALSJ||After returning the telemetry system to low bit rate, they will start on @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf3-7.jpg"@alsjt>Surface 3-7</a>. They will reverse the direction of air flow through the suits and rig the @alsjurl/a17/LM10f1-6Hammocks.jpg"@alsjt>hammocks</a>.
127:52:20|ALSJ||There is some unallocated time in the flight plan, some "padding" in the schedule.
127:53:02|ALSJ|CDR|We still had to set up the @alsjurl/LM10f1-6.jpg"@alsjt>hammocks</a>. Our suits were probably already in the back of the cabin, hooked up to hoses to dry out; and there were always a few things to shuffle around: get our foodstuffs stowed, clean the visors, look at the rocks and pack them away, and so on. We were busy almost all the time.
128:02:36|ALSJ||Jack doesn't want to take a chance on scratching the visors.
128:04:59|ALSJ||During the EVA, water lost from the body in sweat and breath would have built up in the suit had the PLSS not contained a wick-like device to extract excess moisture. This was then stored in a reservoir, although not one connected to either the Liquid Cooled Garment closed-loop supply or to the sublimator feedwater supply. They have just finished recharging the PLSSs with feedwater and, prior to doing that, drained the wicked water into the descent stage sump.
128:04:59|ALSJ|CDR|The Liquid Cooled Garment was really important to help keep you cool so that you wouldn't sweat too much. Back in Gemini we had nothing but air cooling; and, during my Gemini IX EVA, the humidity in the suit got to be 100% and I got my helmet all fogged up. The LCG made it a totally different ball game. You still perspired and you had to make sure you drank enough water that you didn't become dehydrated; but you didn't have to worry about overheating and fogging up.
128:08:04|ALSJ|LMP|This was another alternative to consider for the dark mantle, another hypothesis to work on. Because there were more mafic minerals in the basalt than we originally thought, you might have had a darker impact glass develop and, so, you had to continue to consider the possibility that the dark mantle was a dark regolith derived from basalt with a high concentration of iron/titanium minerals in it. In a sense, because the glass beads we found at Shorty were dark because they were rich in iron and titanium, this hypothesis is also a step closer to the truth.
128:11:09|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Brian Lawrence suggests "Come Watson, the game's afoot.
128:13:53|ALSJ|LMP|Through the years, Joe and I would occasionally pun together. Still do.
128:13:58|ALSJ||If Jack is in his hammock, lying with his head to the north and his feet to the south. He can see Earth out his window, unless they've got window shades up by this time.
128:13:58|ALSJ||The layout of the hammocks is shown in a @alsjurl/a12/a12.hammocks.jpg"@alsjt>drawing</a> from the Apollo 12 Press Kit.
128:15:23|ALSJ||On Apollo 15, Jim Irwin slept in his Constant Wear Garment and used the sleeping bag. Dave Scott slept in his 'coveralls' without using the sleeping bag. On Apollo 16, Charlie Duke slept in his Liquid Cooled Garment (LCG). After the mission, John Young said that, the first night, he was very warm and went to sleep naked in the sleeping bag. However, his feet got very cold later during the rest period and he had to put the Interim Stowage Assembly (ISA) over them. For the remaining nights on the Moon, he slept in his LCG.
128:15:23|ALSJ||During Apollo 17 and in the post-flight debriefings neither Gene nor Jack mentioned what they wore for sleep. In reply to a January 2004 question, Gene wrote "In the LM because we had to take our suits off, I slept in my LCG. In the Command Module we didn't have to wear LCG, so I slept in my Constant Wear garment and in the sleeping bag for restraint.
128:15:23|ALSJ||In reply to the same question, Jack wrote "I think we both slept in the constant ware garments that show up in the interior pictures. I do not remember that we had sleeping bags, just hammocks. I am not sure the bags were even on board. I slept very well, waking only occasionally to listen to the 'comforting sound of fans and pumps.'
128:15:23|ALSJ||NASA Public Affairs reports to the media that Gene and Jack turned off the voice subcarrier at 128:54 but weren't yet asleep. The following message came 8 minutes later.
128:15:23|ALSJ|CDR|We'd had a long first day, something like 20 hours. This was PDI (Powered Descent Initiation) and Landing day and the whole thing. And you have to realize that, to me, sleeping on the Moon is the greatest waste of time a human being can conceive. I mean, you go all the way to the Moon; you go a quarter of a million miles to spend three days on the Moon and you sleep through one of them. But you had to sleep; we were just so tired that first night that we didn't have any choice but sleep or, at least, try to get some rest. I can remember just laying there with my eyes closed and thinking, "Hey, I'm on the Moon. Why am I wasting my time trying to sleep or rest?" And yet you'd worked so hard that biologically you just had to get some rest. There had been some discussion of a sleep period before the first EVA, but we decided it wasn't very useful to do that. You'd have to take your suit off, and the next day you'd put it on, and you'd just waste more time. We knew this was going to be a long day, but we had prepared for it. Sure, it was exhausting to some degree because it was a long day, a 20-hour day, and physically demanding. Getting the backpacks on, getting out, getting the Rover deployed, setting out all the experiments: those were all physically very demanding tasks. So we were tired when we finally got into the rest period and I slept fairly well. I'd get some sleep, dozing off. Then I'd open my eyes for a while and then doze off for another hour. It was certainly acceptable rest.
128:15:23|ALSJ|LMP|It's interesting that Gene felt that sleep was a waste of time, because there was really no alternative. On Apollo 12, in particular, we found that when the crew tried to sleep in the suits, the continued discomfort - even depressurized - meant they got very little rest. They basically got out for EVA-2 as tired as they had been when they'd gotten in the LM the night before.
128:15:23|ALSJ|LMP|I never felt that sleep was a waste of time. After the rest period, during which I got about five hours of sleep, I felt well rested and was ready to go again. I can't agree that sleeping was a waste of time, for the simple reason that we couldn't have performed well without it. Even with adequate rest, we were working so hard that, for example, I had a real emotional down time at Station 3, and it took the discovery of the orange soil to rejuvenate me. However, there had never been any question in my mind about trying to sleep the first day in between the landing and the first EVA. That just didn't make much psychological sense, even though it made for a long day. And besides the psychological advantage of getting right out, it also gave us a chance to get the ALSEP deployed and a few samples collected in case something happened that would force us to leave early.
128:15:23|ALSJ|LMP|I slept much better on the lunar surface than I did in orbit. One-sixth gravity is a very pleasant sleeping environment with just enough pressure on your back in those hammocks to feel like you're on something but not enough to ever get uncomfortable. I slept but my impression was that I only needed about five hours sleep to feel rested whereas ordinarily on Earth at that time I usually felt that I could use seven. But I think that's related mainly to the lower gravity environment. You just don't get physically as fatigued as you would on Earth. You get as fatigued mentally - obviously you're working just as hard with your neurons - but physically you don't work as hard.
128:15:23|ALSJ||Ron Evans has been off-comm - and/or asleep - since 123:33 and receives his wake-up call from Houston at 131:23. Three hours later, at 134:42, he has the following exchange with Gordon Fullerton.
136:55:05|ALSJ||Jack Schmitt (Dabney '57) and Gordon Fullerton (Fleming '57) were both undergraduates at the California Institute of Technology. At 7:00 a.m. on the mornings of Caltech final examinations, it was traditional for students with hi-fi systems to tie them together and wake up everybody in the undergraduate dorms by playing "The Ride" at full volume. For those - including your editor (Blacker '66) - who have been through the experience, the sound always gets the blood pumping no matter how little sleep they've had the night before.
136:56:43|ALSJ||Bob Parker was a married graduate student at Caltech and lived off-campus. Playing "The Ride" was strictly an undergraduate phenomenon and, for Bob, the Ride wouldn't have had the same significance as it did for Jack. In a February 1992 telephone conversation, Bob said that, if it was he who picked the piece, it was simply because he likes Wagner and can think of few things more stirring than the Ride. He also says that, in the Apollo era, the wake-up music was usually picked the night before and that they sometimes had trouble finding a recording in time.
136:56:50|ALSJ||In a separate telephone conversation, Fullerton said that he is certain that the idea of playing the Ride was not his. He noted that there were plenty of Caltech people around and that any one of them might have come up with the idea.
136:57:01|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Danny Ross Lunsford tells us that the tune Jack is humming is from the third movement of Chopin's 2nd piano sonata in B-flat minor, op. 35.
136:57:55|ALSJ|LMP|I wore the ear-piece every night because I was closer to the panel. The usable volume of the cabin is T-shaped. My @alsjurl/a12/a12.hammocks.jpg"@alsjt>hammock</a> was stretched across the front, and Gene was stretched out toward the back, over the engine cover, with the suits under him.
136:58:16|ALSJ||They are on Surface 3-8. According to the checklist, the crew has 25 minutes for "Post-sleep" activities. Those that are called out are stowing the @alsjurl/LM10f1-6Hammocks.jpg"@alsjt>hammocks</a> and sleep restraints getting a stay/no stay decision from Houston, reporting on their sleep and meals, and copying lift-off times for the next several hours. Needless to say, they are also taking time to urinate and perform other personal and housekeeping chores before having breakfast and getting into their Liquid Cooled Garments and suits. Because they were on a low residue diet, neither of them had to defecate while they were on the Moon.
137:00:32|ALSJ|LMP|We were very careful to keep things stowed in the place to which they were assigned. We had many storage training sessions. During the mission, I would have known where everything was stowed but, now, I can't remember anything except that there were a lot of soft fabric bags in the back portion of the usable volume of the ascent stage, along the walls as I recall. Actually, I take it back. I don't think they were soft; there were some soft containers, but I think they all had aluminum latch covers on them. But anyway, we had a place for everything and we made sure it went back into that place. Otherwise, it would have been chaotic. We tried not to have a lot of stuff out at one time.
137:00:32|ALSJ|CDR|Because of weight restrictions, I don't think we had aluminum covers on all of the storage compartments and, rather, a lot of our stowage areas had net coverings on them. Although we were going to be on the Moon for three days, we always had to keep things well stowed in case we had an emergency lift-off.
137:02:02|ALSJ||That is, Jack only heard comm noise once during the rest period.
137:06:25|ALSJ||The "explosion" was apparently caused by a slight expansion of the food bags which, when Gene and Jack opened the stowage compartment, popped out and got very disorganized. There was a prior mention of corn chowder at @alsjurl/a17/a17.postland.html#1145024"@alsjt>115:50:24</a> and, in both that instance and this one, they are referring back to episodes of flatulence on the trip out from Earth which they blamed on the chowder.
137:07:51|ALSJ||NASA photo @alsjurl/a17/ap17-KSC-72P-536.jpg"@alsjt>KSC-72P-536</a> was taken on December 4, two days before the scheduled launch, and shows Gene, Jack, and Ron making a final examination of the food packed for the mission under the watchful eye of dietician Rita Rapp (right), who headed the Apollo food program. Dave Ballard, Apollo 17 Flight Crew Support Team Leader, adds " This was the last crew equipment review prior to final stowage in the Command Module. The crew is looking at a food locker with Rita graciously overseeing the results of her able efforts. Left to right: Gene; Jack; a KSC Quality Control troop, name unknown; Bob Horne, Crew Equipment Engineer from our support team; Ron; and Rita.
137:08:30|ALSJ|CDR|I'm pretty sure that, while we slept, we each kept our PRDs in a pocket in our LCG and then, when we got suited, we'd put it in a pocket in the suit itself.
137:08:30|ALSJ||The checklist calls for PRD readings after they've got their LCGs and suits on but before they don the PLSSs. There are no mentions of any PRD transfers in the checklist.
137:09:24|ALSJ||These lift-off times will be needed by the computer if they have to launch early. In the following list, the first lift-off time is for Command Module orbit 26. The start of each orbit comes roughly at the point over the middle of the lunar Farside at which the crew did the engine burn that first put them into lunar orbit.
137:09:24|ALSJ|CDR|The PADs were pre-printed forms at appropriate places in the flight plan with labeled boxes where you would write things like these updated lift-off times.
137:09:30|ALSJ||Fullerton carefully pronounced each digit, and using "niner" rather than "nine" in his recitation. Jack does not follow suit.
137:12:03|ALSJ|CMP|is using less oxygen, water, maneuvering fuel, etc. than planned
137:12:29|ALSJ|CDR|People sometimes ask if I worried about getting home. Well, you're sitting there inside an oil can and you've already bitten the bullet. If something's going to happen there's nothing you can do about it. So why worry about getting back until the end of the three days when it's going to count.
137:15:47|ALSJ||Fullerton is struggling as he tries to say what he means.
137:16:20|ALSJ||Comm Break with occasional accidental keys
137:16:20|ALSJ|LMP|There was a tendency to be dehydrated and also a tendency not to be either thirsty or hungry - at least in the first few days - so I made a point to force myself to drink and eat. More so than I think either Gene or Ron. Gene didn't eat much the first few days. And neither did Ron.
137:16:20|ALSJ|CDR|I lost weight on all three of my missions: thirteen pounds on Gemini IX, eight on Apollo 10, and eleven on Apollo 17. (Evans and Schmitt each lost about five pounds during the mission.) Food was a necessity more than an enjoyment. You just didn't get hungry, the food wasn't that great, and you just didn't eat as much as you normally would. I don't remember whether I ate a lot or not; but, having flown before, I was certainly very aware of the need to continually drink as much water as we could.
137:17:58|ALSJ|LMP|Some of these accidental keys may have been caused by pushing the talk button out of habit.
137:19:55|ALSJ|LMP|John Young was involved in this not only because he was the backup Commander but also because he had broken a fender on his Rover on Apollo 16 and knew how important the problem was. Without the fender, you get a forward rooster tail and you end up driving into your own dust.
137:19:55|ALSJ||Ron Creel has provided a summary ( @alsjurl/LRV_Fender_Extensions.pdf"@alsjt>1.3 Mb PDF</a> ) of the fender extension losses that occurred on all three Rover missions.
137:20:11|ALSJ||Gene and Jack have a set of lunar surface maps which are printed on a stiff, photographic paper called "cronopaque". Each map is about 8 by 10 inches. The front of each sheet is a photographic map while the back is a contour map to aid in crater identification. Gene discusses the AOT lamp clamps below. They can be seen just to the right of Jack's right hand in training photo @alsjurl/a17/ap17-KSC-72PC-540.jpg"@alsjt>KSC-72PC-540</a>.
137:20:11|ALSJ|LMP|We had maps to cover the whole area in case we ended up with an 'off nominal' landing, as NASA would say, and had to run traverses different from the ones we planned. So there were a bunch of spare maps and that's what they decided to have us tape together to form the replacement fender.
137:22:27|ALSJ|CDR|We had a couple of auxiliary lights which were little spotlights with clamps on the back that you could fasten anywhere: on a circuit breaker panel, on a rod. They were very useful, and I think we even brought the clamps back in with us after the third EVA to make sure we had them. They were called the AOT lamp clamps because, most of the time, we had them clamped to the bars on the cage surrounding the sextant or Alignment Optical Telescope. As the cabin pictures show, the AOT was between us at about head height, on the front bulkhead between the windows.
137:22:50|ALSJ||There is a picture of the fender, as installed, at the start of the drive out to Station 2. It is frame AS17-135- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20542"@alsjt>20542</a>.
137:24:10|ALSJ|LMP|The guide rails were about as thick as a pencil and you could use them as something to clamp this new fender on so that it wouldn't move.
137:24:26|ALSJ|LMP|Gene has a naturally strong grip. He has very big hands and that's what John's referring to.
137:25:01|ALSJ||Young had been the backup Commander on Apollo 13.
137:26:24|ALSJ||The missing piece is the aft half of the right-rear fender.
137:27:56|ALSJ||Young is trying to describe a cylinder sliced lengthwise.
137:28:14|ALSJ||Andrew Chaikin suspects that this is a sly reference to an incident during Apollo 16 when, not realizing that he had an open mike to Houston, Young talked freely and frankly - and with a lot of cursing - about the trouble they were having with orange drink, which was getting in their hair and microphones and was making John suffer from incessent flatulence.
137:28:20|ALSJ|LMP|As I recall, I think I was just standing there, admiring the ingenuity of the support crew. The guys on the ground had gone out and thought about everything we had in the spacecraft, looked at the inventory, and then, as a team, tried to figure out what in the world we could do to solve the problem using what we had. I don't remember ever even thinking about a solution once they said the previous night that they were going to work on it. I figured they would work something out.
137:28:27|ALSJ|LMP|Terry Neal was a member of our support team. A real young guy. I introduced him to his wife - something to do with a blind date I couldn't make and he was the substitute and eventually married the girl. He was one of the ones responsible for storage of equipment in the LM and for generating the lunar surface operations plans and stuff like that.
137:28:27|ALSJ||In a January 1992 telephone conversation, Neal said that he and Ron Blevins - one of the training instructors - were called in to work on the fender problem. They went through the list of materials available in the LM and, having decided on the maps and the clamps, fashioned a fender, and showed it to Young. Neal remembers that Young then took the fender to the Control Room so that the Flight Director and others could examine it. (See NASA photo @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#S7255170"@alsjt>S72- 55170</a>.) Neal, himself, then went home to get some sleep. As Fullerton indicated at 137:13:15, Young subsequently got into a suit and put the fender on a training Rover to make sure that there wouldn't be any problems with the installation.
137:28:27|ALSJ||A fuller account can be found after @alsjurl/a17/a17.eva1post.html#1261546"@alsjt>126:15:46</a>.
137:28:27|ALSJ||As an aside, Neal also says that, in the blind-date story, Jack has mixed together two sets of memories. At some point during Apollo, Jack had a date with the daughter of a friend of Al Shepard's and, when a schedule conflict arose, Neal was a last minute substitute. Separately, Neal's future wife, Mary, worked at the Cape in the Crew Operations area and knew Jack in that context. The Neals' courtship did not begin until after she left Florida for Houston, long after the date switch.
137:30:56|ALSJ||They hadn't hit any good landmarks during EVA-1 which, given readouts from the Rover navigation system, would have let the people in the back room get an exact fix on the LM. Gene still doesn't realize that the crater 100 meters south of the spacecraft is Poppie.
137:30:56|ALSJ|LMP|Gene was more worried about this than I was. We knew where we were close enough for all of our planned EVA activities, so I quit worrying about where he actually landed.
137:30:56|ALSJ|CDR|Whether or not you're interested in where you landed is a difference between a pilot and a geologist. For me, as a pilot, I wanted to know exactly where we landed, mostly as a matter of pride. For Jack, what mattered was that we'd landed in a geologist's paradise and, no matter where we were exactly, we couldn't lose.
137:31:50|ALSJ||Gene and Jack were actually well east of the Trident craters on both the outbound and inbound legs of the Station 1 traverse. Following Gene's lead, Houston thinks they are about 100 meters south and 200 meters west of the actual landing spot.
137:33:10|ALSJ||Gene is a former Naval Aviator; Fullerton flew for the Air Force.
137:34:51|ALSJ|LMP|I was always interested in the news, particularly about Truman. He had gone into the hospital while we were on the way out; and I guess he died on the way back.
137:34:55|ALSJ||Gene occupies the left "seat" and Houston is asking to look at his biomedical telemetry.
137:37:33|ALSJ||This is George H.W. Bush, who served as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations from 1971 to 1973 and Chairman of the Republican National Committee ifrom 1972 to 1974. After stints as head of the U.S. Liason Office in the People's Republic of China and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, he was Vice President in the Reagan Administration from 1981 to 1989 and was elected President in his own right in 1988. His son, George H.W. Bush, was elected U.S. President in 2000.
137:38:06|ALSJ||Jack had spent quite a bit of time during the trip outbound to the Moon looking back at Earth and providing weather reports for the people stuck indoors at Mission Control.
137:39:10|ALSJ||This is a small window over Cernan's position on the left side of the LM - the "rendezvous port" which he will use to watch his position relative to the Command Module during the final approach as they return to lunar orbit. From their position at the landing site, Earth is also visible out the front windows, but it is high enough in the local sky that Gene probably would have to bend down to see it.
137:39:10|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Frank O'Brien notes that the average December daytime high temperature is 53 degrees Fahrenheit.
137:40:35|ALSJ|CDR|Things like this little weather report still seem unbelievable. It's amazing to think that somebody was actually up there on the Moon, looking back at Earth and telling people in Houston about their weather. And it was me that was doing it. Unbelievable!
137:40:54|ALSJ||During a preliminary, unrecorded discussion about the mission, Jack remembered how bright the Australian deserts were when they were sunlit. He said he hadn't been conscious of the Earth as a clock but did notice what was visible.
137:40:54|ALSJ|CDR|I was very conscious of the rotation of the Earth while we were on the Moon. If you gave yourself enough time, you could watch it rotate. It didn't have any strings holding it up; it didn't have any fulcrum like a globe spinning on your desk; but you could watch it rotate hour after hour. You could slowly watch certain continents disappear; and you'd realize that you were looking at something new and strange, and yet familiar. Even though so much of it was cloud- or snow-covered, you could still pick out enough of where the blues were to know where the continents were and therefore detect a shape, with the naked eye, from the Moon. And you'd realize that new continents were coming into view. You couldn't sit there and watch it; that would have been like watching water boil. But, literally, over a period of hours - say the eight hours between when we got out of the spacecraft and when we got back in - the Earth rotated a third of the way around.
137:45:09|ALSJ|LMP|The Lunar Surface Gravimeter (LSG) was a very-long-period seismometer which was basically a gravimeter. The Principle Investigator was Professor (Joseph) Weber at the University of Maryland, and its basic purpose was to monitor the free oscillation frequencies of the Moon, hoping that, when a gravity wave went past, it would excite both the Moon and the Earth simultaneously, and therein would lie proof of the existence of gravity waves. If it had worked and if they had indeed seen a gravity wave go by, it clearly would have been a Nobel Prize class experiment - probably the only one that ever flew on Apollo in that weird environment of Nobel Prizes. Unfortunately, if I remember correctly, the balance beam had a one-tenth-gram error in its design - right from the very beginning. And you might ask why wasn't it tested. And the answer is that it wasn't tested - to see if it would uncage in one-sixth gravity - because the subcontractor had claimed that such a test would reveal some kind of proprietary information about their gravimeter. And NASA let them get away with that! I heard about that when we did our last deployment of the flight hardware down in a big hanger in the Air Force launch area near the Kennedy Space Center; and I pushed them after that deployment to do a test - which you clearly could do, just by tilting the gravimeter, and making sure it would uncage - and they insisted that they didn't need to do that. And I didn't push it and I should have; I blame myself more than anybody. Then, when we got to the Moon and I leveled it and did everything I was supposed to, it didn't uncage properly; and, as we go through EVA-2 and, I think, even EVA-3, I will keep going back there to try things they'd thought of to make it uncage. They didn't figure out until much later - post-mission - that a design error was what was wrong. They kept saying that there was something wrong with the deployment. My gut tells me it used up two hours of EVA time.
137:45:09|ALSJ||The total extra time spent at the LSG was about a half hour, still a significant amount of time. The important point, of course, is that the instrument didn't work as planned. According to the Apollo Program Summary Report (@alsjurl/alsj-JSC09423.html"@alsjt>JSC-09423</a>, April 1975), "review of sensor records revealed that an error in arithmetic resulted in the sensor masses being approximately 2 percent lighter than the proper nominal weight for one-sixth-earth-gravity operation of the flight unit. The sensor mechanism allows a (plus or minus) 1.5 percent adjustment by ground command to correct mass inaccuracies." In a November 5, 1991 conversation and in a follow-up letter, Weber stated that the source of the uncaging error was not a design error but an arithmetic error made during the manufacture of the balance beam by the subcontractor, LaCoste and Romberg. Lacking any definitive NASA documentation on the matter, I am inclined to take Jack at his word and conclude that there was a design error. However, no matter whether the arithmetic error was made by the designer or the manufacturer, the lesson of the LSG experience is that, to the extent possible, every piece of flight hardware should be thoroughly tested before launch.
137:46:39|ALSJ|LMP|I got my mouth in motion before my mind. It's not good grammar; but it's the way we talked.
137:51:19|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Ulli Lotzmann notes that the 10x40 monocular was manufactured by Leitz, Germany, and modified by NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) Houston.
137:51:49|ALSJ|LMP|Anorthosite is a rock made up primarily of a calcium-aluminum silicate mineral called anorthite, a kind of feldspar. The sixty-kilometer-thick crust of the Moon appears to be largely anorthosite with olivine and pyroxene mixed up with it; and most of the light-colored places of the Moon that you see from Earth are this crust exposed. Although the outcrops on the Massifs look like anorthosites from the LM, it turns out that, after we looked at the rocks that had rolled down, these blue-gray rocks were blue-gray breccias. They were rocks composed of fragments of other rocks, some of those fragments being anorthosite. We weren't expecting to see whole anorthosites on the Massifs because the Massif rocks were almost certainly (shocked) material which had been thrown out of the Serenitatis Basin, so we weren't quite sure what we would see: big breccias or big chunks of anorthosite. It might have been either. The important observation from the LM was that the exposed rocks on the Massif looked fairly distinctly blue-gray and, later on when we got over there, indeed, the rocks were blue-gray. They were breccias but some of the chunks in them were anorthosite and others were dunite. Dunite is a rock composed largely of the mineral olivine, and one of those that we sampled was - and still is, I think - the oldest rock ever dated from the Moon at 4.6 billion, plus or minus 0.1 billion. And all of that happened over at Station 2 on this second EVA.
137:52:56|ALSJ||In the pictures that Gene took from his window shortly after the landing (especially AS17-147- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22482"@alsjt>22482</a>), the gap in the Camelot rim begins above Geophone Rock and extends about ten percent of the picture width to the left. Prior to the mission, researchers at Bell Laboratories used contour maps of the site to generate expected views of the Scarp from the LM and from points along the planned outbound EVA-2 traverse. The results of that study were reported in an October 12, 1972 @alsjurl/a17/a17.bell.html"@alsjt>memo</a> by H. F. Cooper. The expected @alsjurl/a17/a17.bellf2.jpg"@alsjt>view from the LM</a> did not include obscuration by the Camelot rim.
137:52:56|ALSJ|LMP|We started naming lunar features on Apollo 8. Bill Anders decided that it would be far easier to remember names than numbers or letters or anything like that, particularly for the pilots who were used to call signs. So I suggested that we start naming the craters on the Farside - the ones that didn't already have names - that were going to be useful in the navigation and landmark sighting exercises. And before we were through we had named an awful lot of craters - for people in the space program and God-knows what else. Some of them were rejected by the international commission (a nomenclature commission of the International Astronomical Union) that deals in naming features on other planets and some of them were ultimately accepted. Then I did the same thing for the Apollo 10 crew when they did their lunar orbit activities. And then all the crews started to get into it, and most of them did their own naming after that, I think. For our mission, I came up with most of the names for the landing site features and Gene added a few. Poppie and Punk were two of his. Again, the international commission accepted most of names we picked but, for example, the name 'Jefferson-Lincoln' Scarp was not accepted because of its 'political nature', and, I think, it is now called the J-L Scarp. On the other hand, the committee didn't understand the political nature of some of the other names and accepted them: Victory Crater is shaped somewhat like a letter 'V' and was named for @alsjurl/a17/a17.site.html#victory">Churchill</a>; and Camelot was named for John Kennedy.
137:52:56|ALSJ||For the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal, I have taken the view, as long as all lunar exploration was being done with telescopes, the IAU Nomenclature Committee had the responsibility of approving names. However, once the landing missions started, the prerogative of naming local features passed to the astronauts and their colleagues. As with the names bestowed by terrestrial pioneers and explorers, the choices were sometimes quirky and sometimes repeated existing names, but were always very personal. In all instances, I have either used the names the astronauts used during the missions or names - like Geophone Rock - that came into common, post-mission usage by the Apollo community. Note that the formal names of the Scarp - Jefferson-Lincoln, J-L, Lee, etc., are hardly ever used.
137:53:24|ALSJ|LMP|The prep-and-post card was Velcroed to the panel in front of us so that we could use it when we really couldn't use the checklists. You get to a certain point when you're pressurized in the suit where you really can't fumble with the book, so you just read a summary on the card.
137:54:12|ALSJ||NASA's Public Affairs mentions that the crew is about one hour behind the timeline, a holdover from EVA-1. Houston anticipates a start of EVA-2 at 140:10, or about 5 p.m. Central Standard Time. The actual start will be about thirty minutes later than this estimate.

138:01:16|ALSJ|LMP|Full-up simulations were relatively rare - only a few per mission - but we went through the critical phases over and over again. Depending on how complex each phase was, we would adjust the amount of time we spent. Also, if the console people felt we needed more time, they would recommend it. Even though we didn't run through the EVA preps and cabin configuration checks quite as much as some other phases of the mission, through the years I did an awful lot of them because, before I was assigned to a crew, I would check LM stowage for other crews. These were called Crew Compartment Fit and Function checks - 'C-squared/F-squared' or even 'CF-squared'. Mostly these were done with the LM or a mock-up fully configured, but there were times when some of the hardware simply didn't appear until fairly late and we would be using non-flight mock-ups or non-flight hardware as a substitute. Early on, the crews tried to force everybody to use flight hardware near the end, just to make sure that they never flew with anything they hadn't seen and which hadn't been fitted into the spacecraft and exercised in the ways that they would use it. In the early days the crews had been bitten by things that suddenly appeared and wouldn't work. That's where the whole concept of a C-squared, F-squared came about, I think.
138:01:16|ALSJ|LMP|Grumman would do a C-squared/F-squared before they shipped a flight LM and I often went up to do those. Fred Haise and I did several together. He and I were good friends and he would ask me to come up and do them with him. Some were done in shirtsleeve and some were done in the suits. And then we did vacuum chamber checks where we put the lunar module in a pressure chamber at Houston or the Cape. That was a major test, and both flight crews, Prime and Backup, would do those. The exception might have been Apollo 17 where John Young and Charlie Duke had just come off of Apollo 16. As I recall, they opted not to do those sorts of things.
138:01:16|ALSJ||NASA photo @alsjurl/a17/ap17-KSC-72P-537.jpg"@alsjt>KSC-72P-537</a> was taken on December 4, two days before the scheduled launch, and shows Gene, Jack, and Ron examining emergency gear to be stowed in the Command Module. Dave Ballard, , Flight Crew Support Team Leader, writes "The crew is looking at some of the final stowage items, but I only recognize the emergency breathing masks at the right on the table. Left to right: Ray Malone, CSM Crew Station Engineer from our support team); Jack Schmitt, Bob Overmyer, astronaut support - we use to call them 'red shirts; Ron Evans; Bob Horne; Crew Equipment Engineer from our support team; Gene Cernan, Dave Ballard.
138:01:16|ALSJ||Ballard continues, "Within a day or so of this exercise, the final stowage would take place in the CSM with our team guys in the middle of it to assure everything met our requirements - no surprises! Guys like Ray Malone, the CSM Crew Station Engineer, and Terry Neal, the LM Crew Station Engineer, Bob Horne and Gene Chase, the Crew Equipment Engineers, spent months - traveling coast to coast - to make sure that the hundreds and hundreds of items called crew equipment met the crew requirements. Crew equipment included all things that had crew interface, like food, cameras, film, experiments, clothing, LiOH cannisters, emergency items, hygene items, etc, etc, etc. The time our guys spent on these items started with active and somewhat assertive participation in the design reviews and testing of the items, formulating the proper stowage plan for particular missions, briefing/training the crews, writing procedures for flight, for vehicle interface testing, fit checks and final stowage, etc.
138:09:51|ALSJ||Jack's mother was staying with his younger sister in Tucson at the time.
138:11:03|ALSJ|LMP|This probably means that each purge valve was optimized to a particular suit flow system, and they wanted to be sure that we each had the right one. We had taken the valves out at the end of the first EVA, and part of the EVA-2 prep was to put them back in.
138:11:58|ALSJ||Astronaut Robert Parker takes over as CapCom.
138:13:54|ALSJ||Bob reads most of the following.
138:14:00|ALSJ||Houston still isn't sure of the exact landing point and is making an allowance for up to a quarter kilometer of driving at a speed of 7-8 kilometers per hour on both the outbound and inbound legs. This estimate is actually quite close to the truth.
138:15:24|ALSJ||The Rover battery covers are hinged at the front so that, with the Rover facing up-Sun, the open covers shade batteries and let them radiatively cool more quickly.
138:17:51|ALSJ||As mentioned previously, the ejecta blanket surrounding a crater represents an overturned section of the original stratigraphy. Materials which were originally on the surface form the bottom of the blanket and, generally, are exposed only at the outer fringe. Materials dug out from the bottom of the crater form the top of the blanket, at least close in to the rim. Because they didn't actually get to the Steno rim, they weren't able to get samples from the deepest parts of the crater.
138:17:54|ALSJ|LMP|Camelot is about 600 meters in diameter, which means that it probably penetrated to about 150 meters depth. Because the regolith wasn't going to be more than a few meters deep in most places, Camelot was sure to have dug deep into the subfloor material. As I recall, we saw the boulders as we drove by on our way to Station 2 and that, later on, then influenced the actual choice of the Station 5 location. They hadn't anticipated that we would see boulders when we drove by Camelot because there hadn't been any evident in the pre-mission photos, only some variations in brightness which suggested that we would find boulders on the southeast rim.
138:20:06|ALSJ|CDR|All of this came from the Backroom, where the scientists and geologists had looked over our first EVA. It seems as though they could have shortened what they read up to us, but it was like getting a debriefing from them. And we were eating and doing other things and it didn't hurt to listen. And it gave us an idea of their thinking, which was important.
138:20:06|ALSJ|LMP|What Bob was probably reading was a piece of paper that the science room sent in. @alsjurl/lee_silver.html"@alsjt>Lee Silver</a> or Gordon Swann or Bill Muhlberger put together something that was then severely edited. This discussion is another illustration of the literal universal importance of superposition in a gravity field. Most of what we do as geologists on Earth is look for evidence of superposition or cross-cutting relationships. And here we're talking about the same thing on the Moon. Their thinking was almost entirely about 'how do we find out what units lie on top of what other units'. That is superposition. I think that what had been surprising was that we had seen no evidence of the dark mantle. It had been so obvious in the pre-mission photographs - particularly in Lunar Orbiter and Apollo 15 photography of the site and even in photographs taken from Earth - that everybody thought that when we stepped out that we would be stepping onto the dark mantle and it would be obvious that it was dark mantle. Well, it wasn't obvious that there was dark mantle there. So, now, they were thinking about the observations we made the day before and they were trying to come to grips with what we saw - the regolith and this intermediate gabbro - and they were trying to summarize their hypotheses. As I've mentioned, the dark mantle question was not really answered until we got to Shorty and put the core tube down into the orange soil. When we pulled it up, the lower 50 centimeters or so of the 70-centimeter tube were dark - (almost) black. And right then it appeared that maybe that - whatever that black soil was - was a contributor to the dark mantle. And later on, it turned out to be devitrified orange soil - glassy, pyroclastic debris, volcanic material that is liquid when it is erupted and which hardened and/or crystallized as it fell back to the surface, a process similar to fire-fountaining that we see in Hawaii. Throughout the region, there was enough of this pyroclastic debris mixed in the regolith to give it - from a distance at least - the appearance of a dark mantle. And, in reality, it is a dark mantle! It has just been mixed up so much with ground-up subfloor material that there wasn't much of it left that you could see as a unit. The dark mantle isn't localized in Taurus-Littrow but is found all along the east, southeast, and southern rim of Serenitatis where there are a lot of grabens and graben faulting along which you apparently had volcanic eruptions of this material. And then as you get into the south and southwest portion of Serenitatis, it changes to large area-deposits of orange and red glass, similar to the orange pyroclastic material we saw at Shorty. The large areas of orange were noticed by Ron after I saw the orange soil in the valley of Taurus-Littrow; and then I spent a lot of time defining it and checking it out once I got back into orbit.
138:21:35|ALSJ||At the start of EVA-1, they loaded a pallet containing four charges - numbers 4, 5, 6, and 7 - on the back of the Rover. They planned to deploy all but number 4 on the trip out to Emory but, because of the shortened traverse, also did not deploy number 5. Now, they will put number 4 between the seats - as planned - for deployment early in the EVA-2 traverse and will save number 5 for EVA-3.
138:22:17|ALSJ||Station 10, Sherlock Crater, will be a chance to sample the subfloor if, for some reason, good samples aren't found at Camelot.
138:23:26|ALSJ||By now, Gene may have begun to attach his biomedical sensors.
138:23:26|ALSJ|CDR|We almost never had time to just listen to somebody talking; we were always busy. We ate, we cleaned visors, we put on the biomed stuff. We didn't always have to tell Houston exactly what we were doing; they knew that from the checklists. We were always, always busy in that cockpit.
138:25:01|ALSJ||This is the seed of Jack's Station 3 frustrations.
138:25:05|ALSJ||The NASA center responsible for development of the Rover was the Marshall Spaceflight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.
138:26:08|ALSJ||In general, although not exclusively, it is Gene who takes responsibility for spacecraft and Rover matters and Jack who takes responsible for geology.
138:26:08|ALSJ|LMP|I don't think it was anything more than the way things worked out. As I recall, we didn't sit around and establish that protocol. But it seemed to work pretty well.
138:26:08|ALSJ|CDR|Jack might have spent more time than I did on the EVA planning, but we were all involved. I involved myself mostly in the operational side - where we could go, what we could do - and left the geological side to the people who knew a lot more about it than I did. During planning and training, the CapComs worked with us as though they were going to make the traverses themselves.
138:26:26|ALSJ|CDR|Although we were all exposed to these geologic terms and trained pretty hard - particularly if you'd trained as part of a backup crew or a prime crew as I had on Apollo 10, 14, and 17 - you wouldn't find anyone but Jack who would make a statement that would include words like 'clinopyroxene gabbro with a fair amount of ilmenite'. Now, you'd find people who would know enough about what they were seeing to say 'there's bright, shiny flakes and dark minerals in the matrix; but the precision is going to come from somebody like Jack who has used the terms all his professional life and who, therefore, uses them with a great deal of confidence. That's the advantage of having a geologist on the surface; in real time, Jack could give the people in the Backroom a much clearer picture of what he was seeing than the rest of us usually could.
138:27:09|ALSJ|LMP|I'm getting closer to the truth than they were with this statement. This is exactly what the little beads of glass happened to be. They had a very high titanium content and were dark because of it. A lucky call.
138:29:22|ALSJ||Houston can only look at biomedical sensors on one of them at a time. Gene is setting a telemetry control switch so that they can look at his sensors. Gordon Fullerton rejoins the conversation.
138:29:28|ALSJ|LMP|There was no active sensor to show you whether the PLSS was filled or not; there was just a little bulb that you looked at to see if bubbles were coming out as you filled it; and when the PLSS was full there should have been clear water in there.
138:30:48|ALSJ|CDR|My daughter Tracy was nine years old at the time of the flight and she was interviewed by Jim Hartz of NBC who was covering the flight for the Today Show. She was on for about ten minutes and I have a tape of it. She had been three at the time of my first flight (Gemini IX) and was much too young to understand what was going on. She was six for my second flight (Apollo 10) and has a few memories of it. But, for this one, she was old enough to be very involved. It's heartwarming to watch the tape; there she was and there we were on a TV monitor in the background, walking on the Moon.
138:30:48|ALSJ||Training photo @alsjurl/a17/ap17-KSC-72PC-379.jpg"@alsjt>KSC-72PC-379</a> shows Tracy and her mother watching Gene deploy the U.S. flag during training at the Cape.
138:31:45|ALSJ||Two 10 1/2 x 8 inch pages will become one 15 x 10 1/2 piece.
138:38:05|ALSJ||There are decals stuck on important pieces of equipment with summaries of procedures. In this case, the <a href = "../plss05.jpg"@alsjt>'decal' text</a> is printed on a fabric square which, in turn, is sewn to the fabric covering of the PLSS.
138:38:05|ALSJ||They are going to assume that the PLSS Aux tank is empty and attempt to fill it for the full five minutes that it would take to fill were it empty. This was the most conservative procedure to follow; and there is no danger of overflow if it is already full or nearly so.
138:40:37|ALSJ|CDR|John Covington was a member of the support team, a PLSS specialist. A good man; he's still at Johnson. All the people on the support team were invaluable: the suit techs, the guys who helped stow the LM, the guys who helped devise the procedures, the guys who helped us train on those procedures. You couldn't do a mission like this without them.
138:50:30|ALSJ|LMP|Any time we gave Houston the ability to read a subsystem or, in the case of the computers, to update the memory, we'd say 'it's yours'. It was a sort of gratuitous thing: 'through our generosity we have given you access; and just remember, we can cut you off.' And that was true. Ours was a manned spaceflight program. The fail safe was always to the man. Up until recently, Soviet program has been just the opposite. They relied primarily on the automatic system or on ground control and it cost them on several occasions, cost them some people.
138:50:30|ALSJ|CDR|A lot of people get fooled by the words 'Mission Control' and think that the ground controlled our spacecraft. Really, it was our 'management advisory office' back here on Earth. With telemetry they could read all kinds of information that we didn't have in the cockpit, largely because of weight constraints and the complexity of the spacecraft; but we were the ones who were flying the spacecraft. We had computers to do a lot of things for us, and we got a lot of information from the ground; but, ultimately, it was the crew that had to tell the spacecraft what to do. In the U.S, the battle for crew control of the spacecraft had been won in the early days of Mercury. Now, I could have put the spacecraft in a configuration where the computer could have done the landing, but it wouldn't have known if it was going to land on a rock or in a hole. And there's no pilot in the world who would have traveled a quarter million miles only to let a computer do the landing.
138:51:07|ALSJ||Gene is now making the replacement fender.
138:52:08|ALSJ||When they go to Voice, the comm quality improves dramatically.
138:59:08|ALSJ||Very Long Comm Break as they don the suits. Procedure details are on Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf3-9.jpg"@alsjt>3-9</a>.
138:59:08|ALSJ|LMP|Thinking back to what's interesting about the old exploration reports, it's a lot of this stuff. It's the whole environment in which the exploration is taking place, all the distractions. The one thing that people forget is that the EVAs were not seven and a half hours. On either side of that was significant pressurized time. We were still in the suits before and after depress and repress and working in that suit was work.
139:20:17|ALSJ||This report of PRD readings is listed on page @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf4-1.jpg"@alsjt>4-1</a>.
139:20:50|ALSJ||Bob had switched to the wrong communications channel.
139:21:41|ALSJ||Houston estimates that they are about one hour and twenty minutes behind the flight plan timeline. Astronauts Tom Stafford and Charlie Duke have joined Parker, Young, and Fullerton at the CapCom console.
139:31:44|ALSJ||The ECS Primary lithium hydroxide canister removes carbon dioxide from the cabin air and has a stated capacity of about 20.5 hours (41 man-hours). The actual capacity is undoubtedly longer. The current canister has been in use since Gene and Jack activated the ECS at about 108:30 - about 31 hours ago. Subtracting off the time (during the EVA) when the ECS was not in use, the canister has been in use for about 24 hours.
139:33:03|ALSJ||Clearly, Houston is not concerned about the delay but does want to get the change done now. They have monitoring the carbon dioxide partial pressure in the cabin. See page EC-18 in the @alsjurl/a17/LM06_Environmental_Control_ppEC1-25.pdf"@alsjt>ECS section of the LM News Reference</a>.
139:40:37|ALSJ||Gene is now in his suit. The battery management procedures are on @alsjurl/a17/17sur40.gif"@alsjt>Surface 3-10</a>. There are five batteries in the Descent Stage and, at intervals during the mission, Jack checks their health and switches them on in various combinations to even the power consumption. During the rest period, batteries 1 and 2 had been on line and batteries 3, 4, and L were off line. Here, he will check the voltages of the separate pair of batteries used to power the @alsjurl/a17/tnD7141ApPyrotchnc.html"@alsjt>explosive devices</a> used to separate the LM stages just prior to lift off; and then, with Houston watching, he will bring batteries 3 and 4 back on line.
139:42:24|ALSJ||The battery management procedures on on Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf3-10.jpg"@alsjt>3-10</a>.
139:43:02|ALSJ||They will now spend a few minutes making sure that all loose items in the cabin are stowed. Then they will get out the EVA Prep cue card and begin the tasks on Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf4-2.jpg"@alsjt>4-2</a>.
139:45:00|ALSJ|CDR|In addition to giving us an emergency oxygen supply in case we'd lost integrity on one of the suits, the Oxygen Purge System also gave us another emergency capability. After the third EVA, we threw the PLSSs out of the LM but kept the OPSs so that, at rendezvous, in case we couldn't dock, we could use the OPSs to do an emergency transfer-EVA into the Command Module. We could plug the OPS in directly to the belly of the suit and stay pressurized for 30 minutes, long enough to get into the Command Module had we had a docking problem.
139:45:50|ALSJ||They are working their way down the left-hand column of Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf4-2.jpg"@alsjt>4-2</a>. The last step before donning the PLSSs is to unlock the forward hatch.
139:52:43|ALSJ|CDR|The lock was a simple one, rather like what you'd have on a front gate. You unlocked it by turning the handle through about ninety degrees.
139:52:43|ALSJ|LMP|We unlocked the hatch before pressurizing the suits because you couldn't really get at the lock mechanism in the pressurized suits. The hatch had enough surface area that it couldn't be opened if there were any appreciable pressure (more than about 0.2 psi) in the spacecraft, so there was no extra risk in unlocking it now. And then, once you were depressurized, all you had to do was pull the handle and open it. There was a valve in the hatch which we opened during depressurization and, if by some extraordinary circumstance, the hatch was fully closed and some gas were released, the cabin couldn't repressurize and seal the door.
139:58:11|ALSJ||Houston estimates they are about 35 minutes from depressurization at about 5:30 p.m. Central Standard Time.
140:04:26|ALSJ||They have begun the section titled "@alsjurl/PLSSComm.pdf"@alsjt>PLSS Comm</a> Check" which begins with a check of the circuit breaker panels. They are in the middle of the left-hand column of Surface <a href="a17LMLunarSurf4-3.jpg"@alsjt>4-3</a>.
140:04:26|ALSJ|CDR|The ground had copies of the cue cards and checklists that we were using and could follow along. When we told them where we were, they could tell exactly what we'd done up to that point and we wouldn't have to call out all the details. Some of the critical things we would verify with them; but in this fairly regimented part of the protocol - getting in the suits, getting the PLSSs on, and checking them out - we'd just let them know from time to time where we were.
140:06:19|ALSJ||Here, they have nearly finished the communications checks on Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf4-3.jpg"@alsjt>4-3</a>.
140:06:37|ALSJ||Jack is giving Gene a drink from the @alsjurl/water_gun.jpg"@alsjt>water gun</a> (photo by Mick Hyde). They do not have their helmets on at this time.
140:08:16|ALSJ||They could improve the quality of Jack's communications by raising the whip antenna on his OPS but, since he is readable, there is no point in risking antenna damage. They will leave both antennas stowed until they are outside on the surface.
140:11:42|ALSJ||They have completed the communications checks on Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf4-4.jpg"@alsjt>4-4</a> and will now prepare the spacecraft environmental systems for depressurization, install the purge valves, and connect their OPS hoses. These procedures are on Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf4-5.jpg"@alsjt>4-5</a>.
140:11:46|ALSJ||They will now circulate LM water through the Liquid Cooled Garments (LCGs) to get some cooling without having to use PLSS water.
140:12:12|ALSJ||They are turning off the flow of oxygen in the ECS Suit Circuit and are also turning off a sensor which detects a pressure difference across the fans.
140:12:16|ALSJ||The warning lights will provide confirmation that the fans and sensor are off. Having finished reconfiguring the circuit breakers, next they will reconfigure the @alsjurl/alsj-LM-ECS.html"@alsjt>ECS</a> valves on the panel behind Jack. FRank O'Brien has provided a photo of the LM ECS ( @alsjurl/FOB_lm_ecs.jpg" ttile="image"@alsjt>726k</a> ) displayed at the Cradle of Aviation Museum.
140:12:18|ALSJ||Frank O'Brien has provdied a photo of the upper part of the forward surface of the ECS ( @alsjurl/FOB_suit_gas_diverter.jpg"@alsjt>628k</a> ) in the LM simulator at the Cradle of Aviation Museum. The suit gas diverter valve is at the upper right in its own recess.
140:12:25|ALSJ||They are verifying that the Suit Circuit is isolated from the cabin and, in the following step, that the @alsjurl/lm_suit_circuit_relief_valve.jpg"@alsjt>Relief Valve</a> is in open and, therefore, would open only if the Suit Circuit pressure exceeds 4.3 psi. On the in-board face of the ECS ( @alsjurl/FOB_lm_ecs.jpg"@alsjt>723k</a> ), the Cabin Gas Return valve is upper center, above the Primary lithium hydroxide cannister.
140:12:35|ALSJ||They are verifying that Jack's suit is isolated from the @alsjurl/alsj-LM-ECS.html"@alsjt>ECS</a> oxygen supply by closing the disconnect valve and unplugging the hoses. See, also, a photo of the bottom, forward portion of the ECS ( @alsjurl/FOB_suit_iso_valves.jpg"@alsjt>667k</a> ). One of the Suit Isolation valves is immediately above the two, large, white hoses. Its twin is to its the left.
140:12:55|ALSJ||The ECS oxygen flow system and the water separator are now completely powered down.
140:15:34|ALSJ||That is, there would be no submerged stumps to catch a fishing line.
140:15:40|ALSJ||Jack named Bear Mountain for a peak near his boyhood home in Silver City, New Mexico. And he picked the name @alsjurl/a17/a17.fam-mtn.html"@alsjt>(West) Family Mountain</a> to honor all of the NASA families. Bear Mountain is much smaller than either of the massifs and, if Taurus-Littrow could be flooded, it would become an island. The mountain that originally was named @alsjurl/a17/a17.fam-mtn.html"@alsjt>(Old) Family Mountain</a> is also much smaller than the massifs.
140:15:51|ALSJ||They are turning off the flow of water from the supply tank in the Descent Stage. Next, they will don their helmets and gloves.
140:16:11|ALSJ||Although they have a lubricant that they applied to the glove-locking mechanism, the so-called quick disconnects, at the wrist, they had taken care of that before the rest period. Here, Gene is literally greasing his hand to try to prevent skin abrasion as he works in the glove.
140:16:15|ALSJ||Gene will now help Jack don his helmet.
140:16:44|ALSJ||The self-doff straps are attached to the sides of the visor assembly and can be used to release the tool harness.
140:19:22|ALSJ||Oxygen enters the suit from the PLSS through vents at the neck ring and in the suit chest. There is a chest-mounted diverter valve which allows the astronaut to select the relative amount of flow through the vents and, in the vertical position, all of the flow is into the helmet through a vent at the back of the neck.
140:19:24|ALSJ||Jack will now check Gene's suit and help him don his helmet.
140:21:20|ALSJ||Gene is asking Jack about the fit of the helmet in the neck ring at the back. Jack is using his fingers to feel for any misalignment.
140:21:45|ALSJ|CDR|It's a long, arduous, time-consuming, difficult, energy-consuming process getting ready to get out. You've got to get in the suits and get everything checked out. You're big and bulky and can't move around very well; just a couple of apes in there. I remember vividly what tough, physical labor it was to reach things. And it got even worse when you got pressurized. A difficult job, but absolutely necessary. You had to make sure that everything was on right and that everything was locked because that suit and that PLSS were your life-support system. It all would have been a lot easier if only we'd had a little more room. In the Shuttle they have a big airlock and it's a piece of cake; and, sometimes, I wonder how we got away with it, particularly in Gemini with that tiny, tiny cockpit. It was a tight fit with a pressurized suit and that chest pack; it's a wonder we didn't lose somebody.
140:21:53|ALSJ||They are on Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf4-6.jpg"@alsjt>4-6</a> and will now configure circuit breakers and switches for depressurization, opening all the breakers marked with white dots and putting all the switches marked with EVA decals in the indicated position.
140:22:35|ALSJ|LMP|The most significant physical discomfort we experienced was the fatigue in the forearm muscles that came from squeezing the glove against the pressure in the suit. It was like squeezing a tennis ball repetitively. And within a half hour or so, the forearm muscles were sufficiently fatigued to ache. And you reached a much lower productivity using your hands than when you started and then you stay at a constant level of whatever you can tolerate and still do the job and not drop things and still apply sufficient force to work, and that then went on for the rest of the EVA. However, after a night's rest and sleep, that soreness went away. There was no residual soreness. I think that's related to the lower gravity environment. Your heart and cardiovascular system are so much more efficient in removing the products of metabolism such as lactic acid that you never damage any muscle fiber. You fatigue it, but you don't damage it. And the important thing was that, with rest, it went away. It came back when you went out again and started work, but it wasn't compounded.
140:23:05|ALSJ||When a sovereign says "we give our consent", use of the so-called "royal we" indicates that the statement is made on behalf of the institution of the sovereign and not the individual who is the sovereign. When Bob tells Gene "we don't see your fan on", he is passing on a message from Flight Director Gerry Griffin, who has been told about the fan by the people monitoring the PLSSs. Here, Jack is jokingly acknowledging the sovereignty of the entire Mission Operations Control Room (MOCR) or, perhaps, of Griffin.
140:23:07|ALSJ||Gene is applying grease to either his hands or to his wrist rings - or both. The fact that there is no hint of Jack lubricating his wrist rings during any of the EVA preps suggests that Gene is greasing his hands. Nonetheless, Gene and Jack did lubricate the seals after each of the EVAs and the following applies.
140:23:07|ALSJ|CDR|Once we'd been outside, there was always a lot of dust on the suits. You could just scrape the dust off with your hand. You couldn't help mixing at least a little dust in with the seal lubricant. It didn't give us any particular problem; but, unlike graphite, lunar dust is not a lubricant and probably caused some wear in the seals.
140:23:52|ALSJ||The cover glove resembles a fingerless golf glove and is worn over the EV glove for abrasion protection.
140:25:07|ALSJ|CDR|I think that most of the time I had to help Jack with his gloves. Partly, perhaps, because of the size of my hands and also because I'd put gloves on so many times going back to Gemini. It was pretty easy for me. Jack could get one on with the other hand bare; but it was tough for him to get the second glove on. So I usually helped him; it was part of the buddy system that was so important.
140:25:14|ALSJ|LMP|This was a band that we put on our arms, over the suit, I think for our watches.
140:25:47|ALSJ|LMP|The gauntlets went about halfway up the forearm, protecting the bearing areas of the gloves.
140:26:11|ALSJ||PGA is the Pressure Garment Assembly, the suit. They are still connected to the LM water supply and have been cooling down as much as possible before disconnecting. They will not turn on the PLSS cooling until they have the hatch open. In this case, they will be off cooling for about 12 minutes.
140:26:41|ALSJ||Gene is connecting Jack's PLSS water hose and is asking Jack to hold the LMP LM water hose that he has just disconnected.
140:26:45|ALSJ|LMP|There was a cloth dust cover that protected the connection between the PLSS water hose and the suit.
140:27:04|ALSJ||Jack is referring to training exercises conducted in a LM that was inside a vacuum chamber. He is now connecting Gene's PLSS water.
140:27:44|ALSJ||This one of the few places in the transcript where Gene, Jack, and I cannot agree on the speaker identification. To me and to Gene, the speaker at 27:44 sounds unmistakably like Gene. Jack disagrees and points out that the remark is more characteristic of things he, Jack, would say. However, the context indicates that Jack is still checking Gene's water hose and, therefore, I have decided to believe my own ears. No matter who is right, the following comment still applies.
140:27:44|ALSJ|LMP|The hose connections were over my stomach and, with the suit not yet pressurized, when Gene pushed in, he pushed against my stomach.
140:28:58|ALSJ|CDR|In the normal configuration, if the cabin had started depressurizing, the O2 regulators would have started pouring oxygen into the cabin to make up the difference. But, in the Egress configuration you were telling the regulators that you were depressurizing on purpose.
140:29:07|ALSJ||The PLSS pump circulates water through the Liquid Cooled Garment. They will leave their sublimators off until the hatch is open.
140:29:19|ALSJ||They will do a suit pressure integrity check for one minute. The cabin is kept at its normal 4.8 psi pressure and the suits are pressurized an additional 3.85 psi as a safety check. Then, as the cabin is depressurized, the regulators bring the suits down in parallel so that they lock up at 3.85 absolute for surface operations. The cabin/suit air is pure oxygen, and there is no danger of the bends.
140:29:23|ALSJ||Jack may be trying to reach the oxygen control on the right-front-bottom corner of his PLSS.
140:30:23|ALSJ||After they get the suits pressurized, they will turn off the PLSS oxygen and watch the suit pressure decay. There will be a small decrease due to breathe-down and to slow migration of oxygen into various nooks and crannies in the suit. A decrease of significantly more than 0.1 or 0.2 psi in one minute would indicate a suit leak.
140:30:24|ALSJ||Once they start depressurizing the cabin, the suit regulators will not be able to keep pace and, for a short while, the relative pressure will be more than 3.85 psi and the suits will be extraordinarily stiff.
140:32:49|ALSJ||They will now bring the cabin pressure down from 5 psi to 3.5 psi and will watch the response of the suit regulators. They are in the middle of the right-hand column of Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf4-6.jpg"@alsjt>4-6</a>.
140:32:55|ALSJ||By opening the circuit breaker and closing the valve, Jack will make it doubly impossible for the ECS to repressurize the cabin when Gene opens the @alsjurl/DumpValve.html"@alsjt>dump valve</a>.
140:33:16|ALSJ|LMP|There were two valves we could use to dump the cabin oxygen for depressurization. There was one in the @alsjurl/forward_hatch.jpg"@alsjt>forward hatch</a>, but the one we used was overhead on the docking hatch and was easier to reach. And that wasn't closed until we came back in.
140:33:16|ALSJ|CDR|These were just little accordion valves, each with a small lever that we used to break the seal. Air pressure in the cabin was enough to keep them shut, but the surface area was small enough that you could open it easy enough with the lever. As Jack says, the overhead was just easier to get to in the pressurized suit. Here, he was probably standing facing away from me, so if he leaned toward me, his PLSS would be on my side of the cabin, and I was probably having to turn a little to get my right arm up and back to get at the valve.
140:33:16|ALSJ||Training photo @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#KSC72PC540"@alsjt>KSC-72PC-540</a> shows the overhead valve at the upper right.
140:33:28|ALSJ||There is no change in Jack's volume as recorded in Houston.
140:34:42|ALSJ||They have bled the cabin pressure down to 3.5 psi and are holding there while they watch the suits react. The EVA clock starts once they are satisfied with the suit integrity and then begin the final depressurization.
|ALSJ||They are now on @alsjurl/a17/a17surf4-7.jpg"@alsjt>Surface 4-7</a> and will start the final depressurization.
140:35:04|ALSJ|CDR|I'm really stretching to reach back up to get the valve because now the suits are even harder than they were when I first opened the valve.
140:35:04|ALSJ||The Overhead Dump valve is behind (aft) and slightly to the left of the hatch handle ( @alsjurl/FOB_overhead_dump_valve .jpg"@alsjt>652</a> ) in a photo taken of the LM Simulator displayed at the Cradle of Aviation Museum.
140:35:04|ALSJ||By definition, this valve opening after the suit integrity check is the start of the EVA.
140:35:13|ALSJ||Once the cabin pressure gets low enough, sensors in the PLSSs will take note of the fact that the sublimators are still off and will generate warning tones and will show H2O flags on the RCUs. In addition, the pressure difference between Gene's suit and the cabin has gotten high enough that his pressure relief valve has opened.
140:36:22|ALSJ||"Lean" would be more accurate than "bend".
140:36:52|ALSJ||The cabin pressure has dropped low enough for sublimator operation and the flag is telling Jack that there is no feedwater flow into the sublimator. The flag is, therefore, telling Jack three things: that he has no feedwater flow, that the cabin pressure is quite low, and that the PLSS warning system is working.
140:37:34|ALSJ|CDR|This was one of the reasons that it was a good idea not to leave things lying around in the cabin. Once the pressure got down low enough - 0.1 or 0.2 psi - you could lean down and use the handle to open the hatch. Then the rest of the air rushed out and anything lying around just zapped out the hatch with it.
140:37:43|ALSJ|LMP|Anything that wasn't tied down flew out. I don't remember any of the dust going out; it was down below the floor so it was a little harder for it to flow out.
140:37:45|ALSJ|CDR|The floor we stood on wasn't the pressure hull of the spacecraft but, rather, was a fitted floor made up of panels with cracks between them The dust got down in there and it was impossible to clean it out.
140:38:33|ALSJ|CDR|It took the suit regulator a while to get itself down to 3.85 psi and, until then, you were working with an extra stiff suit and there wasn't much point in trying to get down on your knees to get out.
140:38:44|ALSJ||The warning lights are telling them that the ECS is off and that the cabin is depressurized. This is primarily a confirmation that the warning system is functioning.
140:38:49|ALSJ|LMP|The actual meaning of 'Roger' is 'Understood', but it tends to be used as a substitute for 'Affirmative'; most of the pilots tended to use 'Roger' wrong and this was just me, trying to get it right.
140:38:52|ALSJ||Gene will turn ninety degrees so that he can get his feet through the hatch.
140:39:24|ALSJ||Jack needs to get as far to the right side of the spacecraft as possible so that Gene can open the hatch with Jack standing behind it.
140:40:06|ALSJ||Jack means that the hatch is open against his legs as far as it will go.
140:40:34|ALSJ||At 40:09, Jack's "get your buttons down" is another reference to the @alsjurl/a17/willie.jpg"@alsjt>Bill Mauldin cartoon </a> discussed at @alsjurl/a17/a17.clsout1.html#1235820"@alsjt>123:58:20</a>.
140:40:37|ALSJ||The cabin air cools rapidly as it escapes through the open hatch and some of the moisture condenses on the hatch opening and other surfaces. This ice will soon sublimate.
140:41:03|ALSJ||Once Gene gets out on the porch, Jack can swing the hatch partially closed, move to the other side of the cabin, and then swing the hatch fully open. He has just put the @alsjurl/alsj-JettBag.html"@alsjt>jettison bag</a> in the hatch opening and pushes it farther out with his boot.
140:41:33|ALSJ|LMP|There was probably some kind of humorous picture that the support crew had inserted into the checklist at this point. Heaven knows what it was. I don't know where those checklists went. But the support crew kept sticking things in there, particularly Bob Parker. At the end of every section we could count on finding 'This is the end and not the beginning', because Gene had come up with a slogan for our mission 'This is the beginning and not the end' and Bob turned it around every chance he had. The typical weird humor of the Caltech graduate.
140:41:54|ALSJ||Gene is attaching the Equipment Transfer Bag (ETB) to the lanyard - called the LEC or Lunar Equipment Conveyor - with which he will lower the ETB to the surface, in part to protect the cameras in the bag and, in part, to free Gene's hands as he goes down the ladder.
140:41:54|ALSJ|LMP|It was a lot easier using two hands going down the ladder. It wouldn't have hurt if you fell; or, I don't think it would have except it might have damaged the PLSS.
140:42:00|ALSJ||They will turn the tape recorder back on at about 163:03 during EVA-3 preparations.
140:42:13|ALSJ|CDR|This was probably a hook on the lanyard that I was hooking onto the ETB or that I was using to attach the lanyard to the ladder. We learned on Gemini IX that, with the pressurized gloves and the lack of dexterity, we needed big things that we could get a hold on, not little things that you had to open with your finger tips. We learned a lot in the early days about the kind of equipment you needed to work with in the pressurized suits.
140:42:17|ALSJ||Jack is making a final check of the circuit breakers and switches.
140:43:37|ALSJ||Here, Jack is referring to the sequence camera, which is mounted in his window primarily for taking one-frame-per-second movies of landing and take-off.
140:44:08|ALSJ||The gravimeter is on the ground, in the shade of the LM, near the ladder. Gene had made a reading just before climbing the ladder at the end of EVA-1, and then put the instrument in the Standby mode. This reading is an instrument check.
140:44:44|ALSJ||Jack is getting out of the LM.
140:45:08|ALSJ|LMP|Getting out the second day was actually more exciting for me than the first was because it looked like we were actually going to have a chance to do something useful (laughing) rather than just deploy the ALSEP. I don't think getting out was an 'adrenaline pumping' type of excitement because your checklist kept you organized and moving from one thing to another. I think the real adrenaline was Launch, Translunar Injection, Lunar Orbit Insertion, Powered Descent Initiation, Landing, Lift-off from the Moon, and Trans-Earth Injection. Although, again, it's amazing how training and procedures suppress those kinds of things because everybody has things they have to do; and so you have to keep doing them. If you got into an adrenaline high you'd increase the chance of missing a step. Training is a great suppressor of adrenaline. It's like being prepared to take an exam in college. The more prepared you are, the less exciting it is.
140:45:08|ALSJ|CDR|I don't know that the adrenaline wasn't pumping the first time we got out on the surface. The second time I was a little more calm and collected, but there was still the realization that I was back out on the surface and that the first time around wasn't just a figment of my imagination. I agree with Jack that where the heart really started pounding and beating wasn't when you were crawling down the ladder. It was things like the landing. It wasn't like you were crawling down the ladder into a pit full of rattlesnakes. You were crawling down the ladder to do something you were looking forward to, something you knew you were going to enjoy, something that, within reason, you had control over. It wasn't one of those heart-pounding things, but it was still a little unbelievable that I was really there. The first day was almost literally like walking in a dream the whole time; the second day, you could look around and begin to appreciate a little more where you were and prepare to be a little more productive. Everything on the first EVA had been checkout, checkout, checkout, checkout. This time we had the Lunar Rover out, we had the ALSEP deployed, and we could begin enjoying ourselves.
140:45:11|ALSJ||The LCRU is the Lunar Communications Relay Unit, hanging on the front of the Rover.
140:45:16|ALSJ||There is a dump-valve handle on the outside of the hatch.
140:45:27|ALSJ||The TV comes on, showing Gene's footpan. As usual, @alsjurl/JSC-OralHist.html"@alsjt>Ed Fendell</a> - who is operating the camera from Houston - starts with a counter-clockwise pan.
140:45:59|ALSJ||Gene has centered Earth in the high-gain antenna boresight.
140:46:07|ALSJ||Fendell now finds both Gene and Jack at the back of the Rover.
140:46:35|ALSJ||Jack is asking Gene to lean on the Rover so that he can reach his antenna.
140:47:02|ALSJ||Jack now bends his knees so that Gene can free his antenna.
140:47:02|ALSJ|CDR|Getting those antennas free was no easy task in the gloves.
140:47:39|ALSJ||Jack moves to the @alsjurl/a17/a17experiment_sep_en.jpg"@alsjt>SEP receiver</a>, mounted on the geopost at the right rear of the Rover, behind his seat. He is now on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_lmp05.gif"@alsjt>LMP-5</a>
140:47:51|ALSJ||The top of the SEP is at about chest height. The glue holding Velcro fasteners onto the SEP dust covers failed sometime during the first EVA. The unit has an internal temperature sensor which will shut it down if it gets too hot - greater than about 108F - and that limit is being approached. They will get data during the traverse to Station 2 and some on the drive back from Station 4 to the LM. Thereafter, the unit will be too hot to work.
140:48:22|ALSJ||Jack goes to the LM ladder to get the ETB.
140:48:55|ALSJ||There had been some concern about the battery temperature indicators and this is a check to see if they are giving proper zero readings with the batteries off.
140:48:59|ALSJ|LMP|Bob Parker and I had talked about getting a TV picture of a pendulum motion in one-sixth gravity. The lanyard was hanging down and so I just gave it a little push so that he could have his pendulum.
140:49:03|ALSJ||Because nothing is hanging from the lanyard to make it a classical pendulum, Jack's push excites multiple modes of oscillation.
140:49:16|ALSJ||Gene leans across his seat to close the battery circuit breakers and read the battery temperatures.
140:49:24|ALSJ||At the end of the first EVA, the temperatures were 108 and 123 degrees, respectively. Clearly, the combination of Gene's dusting and the wax cooling system has been effective.
140:49:29|ALSJ||Gene has gone toward the LM to open Sample Return Container (SRC) 2; Jack removes the replacement fender from the ETB and lays it in Gene's footpan. Gene is now on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_cdr0405.jpg"@alsjt>CDR-5</a>.
140:50:07|ALSJ|LMP|By putting the valve all the way up to full cold, you could very quickly feel a pulse of cold water in the Liquid Cooled Garment. This was done just to make sure the valve was working.
140:50:07|ALSJ||Jack is removing film magazines from the ETB.
140:51:11|ALSJ||Fendell pans to watch Gene at the MESA. He is sealing the organic sample - a roll of aluminum metal - in a sample bag and will put it in the SRC to provide experimenters with a measure of contamination of lunar samples by gases released by the spacecraft and the suits. Once the sample is sealed, Gene will close the SRC lid to prevent excessive heating. At the start of the first EVA, he'd had trouble getting the lid of SRC 1 to stay closed and eventually had to put the "big bag" on the top of the lid to hold it down.
140:51:14|ALSJ||Jack is taking film magazines from the ETB and is putting them under Gene's Rover seat. Gene closes the SRC lid. Some readers may want to note that Jack is not trying to come up with women's names for the film magazines as he did during EVA-1 and will later in the mission. Through this section, he seems too intent on getting ready for the traverse - his first chance to really get out and do geology - to be quite as playful as he is at other times.
140:52:26|ALSJ||The gravimeter is on the ground, between the MESA and the ladder. Gene bends his knees, holding on to the MESA to reach the Grav button to start a new reading.
140:52:42|ALSJ||The flashing light indicates that the gravimeter is leveling itself in preparation for making a measurement. In three minutes or less, it will be leveled, the measurement will be done, and Gene can push the Read button. Jack is about to start the tasks on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_lmp06.gif"@alsjt>LMP-6</a>.
140:53:26|ALSJ||As was discussed at 138:21:35, there are two charges in a transporter that Gene mounted on the Rover before driving out to the ALSEP site. EP-4 is a 1/8th pound charge which Jack will now put between the seats for deployment early in the upcoming traverse. EP-5 is a three pound charge which they will save until EVA-3 and, for now, Jack is getting it and the first transporter out of the way so that he can mount a second transporter - containing charges 1, 2, 3, and 8 - on the Rover.
140:53:57|ALSJ||The MESA bounces as Gene pulls on the battery, one handed. He has an SCB in his other hand which he now takes to the Rover.
140:53:57|ALSJ|LMP|The LCRU batteries were stored in the MESA section of the descent stage, and we had to put in new ones for every EVA.
140:54:42|ALSJ||Jack goes to the MESA with the ETB, followed shortly by Gene.
140:55:07|ALSJ||Jack takes the EP transporter - containing EP-5 - to the east LM footpad. Gene is still struggling with the LCRU battery. It is too far inboard for him to get a good grip with two hands.
140:56:17|ALSJ||Gene is puffing audibly.
140:56:23|ALSJ||The charge transporter is stowed in the equipment bay on the northeast face of the LM Descent Stage.
140:56:43|ALSJ|CDR|In listening to this part, I can still feel the frustration of trying to get that damn little LCRU battery out of a storage area in the MESA. The problems you want to deal with are the ones that are worth solving, not something little that's avoidable. Of course, the real world is always a little different than the training. The training is good because you can try to look at every possible aspect of what you're going to be doing. You anticipate problems, you get proficient, and you get productive; but you're always going to run into new and different situations and, when you do, it's the little, avoidable things that are frustrating. Like having to tie a shoelace that comes undone all the time. If you have the right shoelace to start with, you wouldn't have the problem. Same thing with these LCRU batteries: we had just started the damn EVA and all of a sudden I had to wrestle with a little battery that I should have been able to just pick up and put in place.
140:56:55|ALSJ||Jack comes to the Rover from the east; Gene is still struggling with the battery.
140:58:04|ALSJ||In 1997, I suggested to Gene that "bag of peanuts" was a reference to the small, plasticized bags of peanuts that the airlines serve that are all but impossible to open. He agreed.
140:58:04|ALSJ||Gene turns into the Sun, now holding the 8x4x2 inch battery by a loop handle.
140:58:22|ALSJ||Gene gets the @alsjurl/alsj-dustbrush.html"@alsjt>big brush</a> off the ladder hook where he had left it at the end of the first EVA. Jack goes around the south side of the LM to take a color pan with Gene's camera.
140:58:51|ALSJ|LMP|My shadow was the only long ruler that I regularly carried around with me. And, knowing that everybody underestimates distance on the Moon, I asked them to be ready to give me my shadow length so that I could see what it looked like and know what it really was. And it always looked a lot less long than it really was.
140:58:54|ALSJ||Gene goes to his Rover seat with the battery.
140:59:28|ALSJ||Gene waves into the TV.
140:59:44|ALSJ||Fendell pans away counter-clockwise.
141:00:11|ALSJ||Gene will stow the replacement LCRU battery under his seat as a backup for this EVA. If all goes according to plan, he will actually make the replacement at the start of EVA-3.
141:00:11|ALSJ||While Fendell is panning counter-clockwise, Gene is taking SCB-7 to the tool gate at the back of the Rover, as per @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_cdr0405.jpg"@alsjt>CDR-5</a>. He will then transfer a core cap dispenser, two packs of sample bags, and three core tubes from SCB-5 into SCB-7 and then, as per @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_cdr0607.jpg"@alsjt>CDR-6</a>, put sample-bag packs on the cameras and stow SCB-7 as a spare under Jack's seat. After that, Jack will put SCB-5 on Gene's PLSS, Gene to put SCB-4 on Jack's PLSS, and SCB-6 to be hung on the gate. They will actually wind up with a different pair of SCBs on the PLSSs because of the break in procedure caused by the fender replacement.
141:01:22|ALSJ||Jack is southeast of the LM, taking an @alsjurl/a17/a17pan1410123.jpg"@alsjt>8 o'clock pan</a> to complement the one he took at the start of the first EVA. These photos are AS17-137- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20866"@alsjt>20866</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20893"@alsjt>20893</a>.

141:01:22|ALSJ||The f-stop settings used relative to the direction of the Sun are shown on a @alsjurl/a17/a17magdec.jpg"@alsjt>decal</a> mounted on the top of the film magazine. 'HBW' is High-Speed Black-and-White. Smithsonian Institution photo by Jim Remar.
141:01:57|ALSJ||Fendell finishes the counter-clockwise pan and reverses direction.
141:02:27|ALSJ|LMP|The first Apollo TV camera was just ludicrous. NASA just totally screwed up the specs in buying the thing and there was no excuse for it. Finally, we got a good, high resolution camera for 15, 16, and 17. Actually, Tom Stafford flew it on 10. But the so-called Apollo Television Camera that flew on Apollo 11 was terrible - low resolution, black-and-white. Just not any good at all. It couldn't take any kind of bright scene at all. On Apollo 8, we had to put every filter in the spacecraft in front of it just to take a picture of the Earth.
141:02:27|ALSJ||Apollos 12 and 14 flew a low resolution color television camera which was still too light sensitive. The Apollo 12 crew accidentally burned out the vidicon tube in their camera by pointing it at a patch of reflected sunlight on the LM and, throughout the Apollo 14 ALSEP deployment - at a site down-Sun of the camera - all that could be seen of Shepard and Mitchell was a pair of overexposed, white blobs.
141:02:27|ALSJ|CDR|Getting color television on Apollo 10 was a personal crusade of Tom Stafford's. It was the first flight to carry color TV, and Tom had to lobby and push awfully, awfully hard to get it qualified and get it on board. It didn't make any difference who you were dealing with, every time you wanted to do something like that - whether it was for scientific purposes or whether it was for PR purposes - there was always an element that thought you were doing those kind of things from a self-promotional point of view. What I don't remember was why the color camera wasn't lunar surface qualified for the first three missions. Television, and particularly high definition color television let people understand what you were doing or seeing from a scientific point of view - or from an operational point of view or in terms of sharing the experience. Television had a major impact of the space program and we should have started using it a lot earlier. On Gemini 9, the ground had little or no idea what I was going through up there. If they had been able to see, they could have been a part of it; they could have helped. We might have solved some of the problems right then and there in real time.
141:02:55|ALSJ||Fendell finds Gene at the gate and Jack at Gene's seat.
141:04:10|ALSJ||The identity of "this" remains a mystery.
141:04:13|ALSJ||Jack has the 500 millimeter camera.
141:04:31|ALSJ||Fendell looks at the maps on Jack's seat, then returns to Jack at Gene's seat. Gene is getting two more packs of sample bags out of SCB-5 to hang on the 70-mm cameras.
141:05:08|ALSJ||Jack puts the 500 on Gene's seat.
141:05:15|ALSJ||Gene brings Jack a packet of sample bags to put on the seat, and then goes back to the gate.
141:05:30|ALSJ||Gene goes to Jack's seat.
141:06:05|ALSJ||Jack goes around the rear of the Rover to his own seat, passing Gene who is going to his own seat.
141:06:15|ALSJ||Jack arranges the maps.
141:06:25|ALSJ||Jack clips the maps to the accessory staff, puts the extra maps under his seat, and moves a 70-millimeter camera off of his seat. Gene is at the gate. Jack raises his seat and puts the SCB-7 in the seat pan.
141:08:02|ALSJ||The front half of the original fender is still in place. Gene, at the back of the wheel, positions the new fender over the top of the wheel and overlaps it with the remaining section of original fender.
141:08:02|ALSJ||Jack, standing to the side and slightly in front of the wheel, takes hold of the new fender.
141:08:26|ALSJ||He raises the rear of the paper fender to see how much coverage he's got, and then rotates the new fender 90 degrees.
141:08:49|ALSJ||Gene lifts the rear edge again to check coverage.
141:09:00|ALSJ||Gene opens one of the clamps. It has a screw mechanism requiring finger work. Young had recommended opening the clamps before they were placed in the ETB. However, Gene doesn't seem to be having much trouble, despite the stiffness of the gloves.
141:09:07|ALSJ||He pushes down at the clamp locations to demonstrate that the fender becomes a fairly rigid half-tube.
141:09:10|ALSJ||Gene is having trouble reaching the inboard clamp position.
141:10:08|ALSJ||Gene gives up on his second attempt to fasten the inboard clamp.
141:10:10|ALSJ||He gets the outboard clamp positioned and starts to screw it tight with his left hand.
141:10:26|ALSJ||Gene switches hands after a dozen or so turns of the screw. In Houston, the Public Affairs commentator offers "It's only a paper fender, but the Moon is real" which is a pun on the song lyric, "It's only a paper Moon...
141:11:05|ALSJ||They trade places; Jack to the rear, Gene to the front.
141:12:04|ALSJ||Gene has the inboard clamp positioned.
141:12:15|ALSJ||Gene gets his arm out of the way and leans in for a close look.
141:13:04|ALSJ||Gene starts tightening with his left hand.
141:13:21|ALSJ||Grunting, Gene tightens it a last little bit.
141:13:28|ALSJ||Gene adjusts the outside clamp.
141:13:54|ALSJ||The repair job took about 5 minutes.
141:13:54|ALSJ|CDR|It seemed like it was a lot longer than five minutes.
141:14:09|ALSJ||Young has, of course, been watching the proceedings.
141:14:12|ALSJ||Jack goes to the gate.
141:14:15|ALSJ||Gene straightens up, the job done to his satisfaction.
141:14:32|ALSJ||Gene was supposed to have gotten SCBs 4 and 6 off of the MESA. Jack was trying to get them back on schedule by getting the bags, but got the wrong one. Jack is on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_lmp06.gif"@alsjt>LMP-6</a> and Gene is on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_cdr0607.jpg"@alsjt>CDR-6</a>. They are starting the Geo Prep activities.
141:14:32|ALSJ|LMP|The empty bags were stowed in the MESA and you would think that an intelligent human being would be able to grab the right one.
141:14:49|ALSJ||Gene starts mounting the SCB on the right side of Jack's PLSS.
141:14:59|ALSJ|LMP|Once the samples were in the SCBs, that's where they were going to stay until recovery. In that way, if they wanted a particular set of samples, they would know which bag to get. Some of the samples would be in the boxes (meaning the SRCs), but a lot of them just stay in the bags until they got to the Lunar Receiving Laboratory.
141:15:23|ALSJ||Gene has SCB-8 mounted on Jack's PLSS; he reaches for his cooling control.
141:15:26|ALSJ|CDR|This is a good example of how I had to move my arm forward and then back to loosen the arm bearing and get some momentum so that I could reach the diverter valve. If you tried to just sneak back there slowly, it was hard to do. It was one of the little things you did to adapt to the suit and the environment.
141:15:26|ALSJ||Jack opens the gate.
141:16:24|ALSJ||They are mostly hidden by the gate. Jack is facing southeast; Gene is northeast of him, mounting equipment on the left side of his PLSS.
141:17:04|ALSJ||Gene gets something from the gate, probably the drive-tube rammer.
141:17:07|ALSJ||By getting Jack to turn around, Gene will have sunlight on the right-side straps he's trying to adjust.
141:17:17|ALSJ||Jack starts adjusting Gene's straps, working in shadow.
141:17:28|ALSJ||Jack goes around Gene to the other side.
141:17:41|ALSJ||Jack pushes Gene away from the Rover a little so that he can get at the gate.
141:18:12|ALSJ||Gene starts to move away.
141:18:21|ALSJ||Fendell pans the TV upward.
141:18:47|ALSJ||Fendell returns to them.
141:19:04|ALSJ||Gene gets the hammer from the gate, puts it in his shin pocket.
141:19:07|ALSJ||Jack gets a 70-mm camera from his seat and leaves. He is now on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_lmp07.gif"@alsjt>LMP-7</a>.
141:19:25|ALSJ||Gene goes to read the gravimeter.
141:19:45|ALSJ||Fendell pans away.
141:19:53|ALSJ||Fendell finds Jack jogging to the SEP site. He is using a foot-to-foot, loping stride as he runs.
141:20:17|ALSJ||The SEP gets its electric power from three small solar panels which Jack and Gene taped open at the end of the first EVA. It has been about 18 hours since Jack taped them at @alsjurl/a17/a17.trvlm1.html#1230908"@alsjt>123:09:08</a>.
141:20:34|ALSJ|CDR|I don't think we had nearly as many acronyms in the Navy as we had in NASA. NASA won the prize. The Navy used them for the names of commands, like 'ComNavAirPac' which means 'Commander, Naval Air-forces, Pacific'. But I tell you, going down to NASA meant learning a whole new language: an acronym for everything. And for the longer ones, like LCRU, you just turned them into words and said 'Lacru'. It's funny, but a lot of acronyms became so much a part of the NASA lingo that if you stopped somebody and ask them 'What does LCRU stand for?', they couldn't tell you. People would know which box the LCRU was and what it did, but they couldn't tell you what the letters stood for.
141:21:00|ALSJ||Jack reaches the SEP. Once again, it looks as though he is below the Rover, even though there is really no appreciable elevation difference. He has covered the 140 meters is a bit less than 2 minutes; his average speed, then, is a modest 4.5 kilometers per hour.
141:21:29|ALSJ||Training photo @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#72H1410"@alsjt>72-H-1410</a> shows Jack at the SEP transmitter.
141:21:39|ALSJ||Gene moves the TV camera just as Jack bends his knees so he can reach down far enough.
141:21:44|ALSJ||TV off.
141:21:51|ALSJ||This gnomon is a small post on the top of the SEP transmitter which casts a short shadow on a scale for alignment purposes.
141:22:17|ALSJ||Mag C, or Charlie, is Apollo magazine 137. Jack is using Mag Golf, which is Apollo mag 135.
141:22:54|ALSJ||Here, Gene is referring to the 70-mm camera which he has mounted on a bracket on his chest.
141:22:54|ALSJ||Jack's "random exposures and focuses" are frames AS17-135-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20533"@alsjt>20533</a> to 20537. Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20538"@alsjt>20538</a> is the "locator" to the LM, and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20539"@alsjt>20539</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20540"@alsjt>20540</a> show the sample location and the raindrop pattern on the soil.
141:22:54|ALSJ|LMP|This was the 'Dixie cup' sampler which I must have just grabbed and carried out to the SEP site without telling anyone. It held a stack of Dixie-cup-like bags on a long handle; and when you filled one and pulled it off, another one was ready to use. Again, the bags each had a metal ring and you clamped it down and twisted it and stowed it. Each of the bags already had a number on it.
141:22:54|ALSJ||NASA photo @alsjurl/a17/ap17-KSC-72PC-411.jpg"@alsjt>KSC-72PC-411</a> shows Jack examining the LRV Sampler during a final checkout of the Rover prior to stowage on the LM. Training photo @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#72H1227"@alsjt>72-H-1227</a> shows Jack using the sampler from his Rover seat.
141:24:03|ALSJ||Bob is subtly ribbing Gene about a piece of packing material he found at the SEP site at the end of the first EVA and mistook for a piece of brown glass. See comments at 123:03:34 and 123:28:18.
141:25:02|ALSJ||Jack's photo of Gene driving out from the LM is AS17-135- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20541"@alsjt>20541</a>.
141:25:24|ALSJ||These are the four 35-meter long wires that form the SEP transmitter antenna.
141:25:55|ALSJ||There is a burst of static as Gene turns the Rover to head west.
141:27:05|ALSJ||Gene needed to park the Rover within ten meters of the transmitter and within 5 meters of the west antenna arm. Once Jack climbs on board, they will drive along the west arm to give the experimenters a calibration reading. At this moment, Jack is taking pictures of the relative positions of the transmitter, the Rover, and the antenna arms at the start of the drive.
141:27:05|ALSJ|LMP|The intent here was to drive along the antenna on a constant heading so that the SEP experimenters could have a bit of calibration data that would have been easy to analyze - had the experiment been working. I don't know if it was still working at this point, and we certainly didn't know that until we got the data back to Earth. As I recall, they got a little bit of information on this EVA and, after that, it just got too hot.
141:27:05|ALSJ||AS17-135- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20542"@alsjt>20542</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20546"@alsjt>20546</a> document Gene's parking at the SEP transmitter.
141:27:05|ALSJ||in frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20544"@alsjt>20544</a>, note the long track made by the large boulder visible slightly above and to the right of the rake.
141:27:56|ALSJ||Gene will do the navigation system initialization by pointing the Rover directly away from the Sun. He had parked heading due west and since, the Sun is 12 degrees south of east at this point in the mission, he'll have to turn the Rover to a heading of 282 in order to zero the sun-shadow device.
141:28:24|ALSJ||These photos are AS17-135-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20547"@alsjt>20547</a> to 20549.
141:29:09|ALSJ||Jack will keep the LRV Sampler within reach, attaching it to the accessory staff. He probably would not be laying it in his seat pan since it would be hard to reach while seated.
141:29:16|ALSJ||This difference in heading has the potential of contributing up to a 100 meter southward bias to estimates of the LM location made from Rover readouts at the more distant stations visited during this EVA. This point is discussed in full at 164:48. If Gene did not do the correction - and that point is not crystal clear in the following dialog - all LM bearing readouts given during this EVA should be decreased by one degree.
141:30:25|ALSJ||A sketch map of the initial portion of the traverse is shown (identically) on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_lmp08.gif"@alsjt>LMP-8</a> and CDR-8. The average heading during the first six kilometers of the traverse will be 260 degrees, ten degrees south of west. As discussed previously, there is an offset in the low-gain antenna's pointing indicator to compensate for the Earth's position in the local sky and, therefore, the reason for the 240 degree pointing - rather than 260 - is not obvious. They also are carrying a more detailed cronopaque map, based on Apollo 15 photography, with a contour map on the back.
141:31:44|ALSJ||Gene has driven about 32 meters along the antenna arm in about 40 seconds. His average speed, therefore, was a bit over 4 kph. During the drive toward the LM, Jack takes AS17-135- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20550"@alsjt>20550</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20551"@alsjt>20551</a>, the latter showing a large, partially buried boulder northeast of the spacecraft.
141:31:51|ALSJ||Details of the initial stage of the traverse are given (identically) on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_lmp09.gif"@alsjt>LMP-9</a> and CDR-9.
141:31:56|ALSJ||It is possible that Houston is now giving credence to Ron Evans' sighting of the area lightened by the LM descent plume. Houston's estimate of the landing point is quite good considering the sparse information available at this point in the mission. Rover navigation data at well-defined stops during this traverse will be used to refine the estimate. See the discussion after @alsjurl/a17/a17.trvsta6.html#1644812"@alsjt>164:48:12</a>.
141:32:52|ALSJ||The Rover has digital indicators for bearing, distance driven, and range. The range indicator changes from 000 to 001 at 50 meters, to 002 at 150 meters, and so on. The distance indicator changes at 100m, 200m, and so on.
141:33:04|ALSJ||This is the flag marking the southernmost geophone that Jack deployed during the first EVA.
141:33:08|ALSJ||Jack's @alsjurl/a17/a17.1413310_trv.jpg"@alsjt>three traverse photos</a> taken during this interval are AS17-135-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20552"@alsjt>20552</a> to 20554. They show some large boulders south of Geophone rock.
141:33:37|ALSJ||Gene has been driving more or less south to get around the geophone and will now turn west.
141:34:00|ALSJ||Jack's @alsjurl/a17/a17.1413400_trv.jpg"@alsjt>eight traverse photos</a> taken during this drive west to the charge deployment site are AS17-135-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20555"@alsjt>20555</a> to 20562.
141:34:31|ALSJ||That is, at a range of 550 meters.
141:35:00|ALSJ|LMP|The drive up to the Camelot rim was a very gradual climb, unlike Cone Crater on Apollo 14 which was a crater on a knoll. The LM was probably on the ejecta blanket of Camelot, so it would have been hard to judge a change in slope. Generally, the terrain here was much flatter than on either Apollo 14 or Apollo 16, which were the highland sites. The average (vertical) variation at our site was perhaps a meter or a meter and a half; and there's one picture of the LM, taken looking back into the Sun, and there is a little low ridge blocking out the lower part of the LM.
141:35:00|ALSJ||Jack is probably thinking of AS17-145-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22185"@alsjt>22185</a>, which he takes at the end of the EVA from down in the swale west of the LM.
141:35:53|ALSJ||The SEP transmitter is seven degrees north of east from their current position and at a range of 450 to 550 meters. They are probably close to the upper figure because the distance reading is 600 meters. Because they have been driving around craters, this figure should be reduced by about ten percent, indicating that their straight-line distance is at least 540 meters.
141:36:15|ALSJ|LMP|The seismic charges had an Apollo Standard Initiator (ASI), which was the @alsjurl/tnD7141ApPyrotchnc.html"@alsjt>pyrotechnic initiator</a> they used for everything - for any kind of explosive bolt initiation, for instance. It was hooked up to a radio receiver and, at 90 hours, the timer moved a metal window from between that initiator and the charge. For half an hour after the window opened, the ground could send a signal to set off the initiator and, therefore, the charge. And, if it hadn't gone off in the half hour, then the window would close again and that would be the end of it. All of them actually did go off but, if they hadn't, they would have been safe sitting up there when the people from the Smithsonian went to collect them sometime in the future.
141:36:23|ALSJ||Training photo @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#72H1411"@alsjt>72-H-1411</a> shows back-up LMP Charlie Duke deploying a charge from his Rover seat.
141:36:23|ALSJ|CDR|Jack had to lean over to get the charge on the ground. Of course, we were riding low to the ground, but he had to reach to get the charge outside the fenders and sometimes he probably grabbed the antenna on the charge to set it down. Then, when we started up again, I had to be very careful not to run into the charge and knock it over. With the front-and-rear, Ackerman steering, if you turned left away from the charge, rather than the rear wheels dragging, the rear wheels were going to turn right and maybe hit the charge; so I'd turn right to avoid it.
141:36:29|ALSJ||Apparently, the head of the LRV sampler has come off. They'd had trouble getting it on during the Geo Prep at the ALSEP site.
141:36:32|ALSJ||Because of the stiffness of the suit and the bulk of the RCU and the camera blocking his view of his feet, Jack has no chance of looking for the sampler without getting off the Rover. Gene can see parts of Jack's foot pan, but not all of it.
141:36:47|ALSJ||Gene is suggesting that he turn the Rover in a slow circle so that Jack can take a sequence of photos for a partial pan. This technique was invented by Young and Duke during their second Apollo 16 EVA.
141:37:06|ALSJ||Jack is telling Gene that, once they are pointed at Geophone Rock, they will have finished the partial pan. The @alsjurl/a17/a17.1413652_pan.jpg"@alsjt>pan</a> photos are AS17-135-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20563"@alsjt>20563</a> to 20569. The last of these, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20569"@alsjt>20569</a>, shows the large blocks south of Geophone rock that Gene drove around to avoid Geophone 4.
141:37:30|ALSJ||Jack dismounts. The handle of the LRV sampler is one of the Universal Handling Tools (UHT's) that they used during the ALSEP deployment. Training photo @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#72H1227"@alsjt>72-H-1227</a> shows Jack using the sampler from his Rover seat.
141:37:48|ALSJ||Jack is referring to the retractable locking pins in the handle; Gene is probably holding the UHT, working the trigger.
141:38:20|ALSJ||Jack seems to be twisting the UHT into the sampler head.
141:39:23|ALSJ|LMP|In the pre-mission photos we could only see the very largest boulders and I don't think we could see any around Camelot. And we couldn't have seen any out that far from the LM.
141:39:23|ALSJ||A @alsjurl/a17/a17.eva1.tvrs-Camelot-det.jpg"@alsjt>2x-expanded detail</a> from a @alsjurl/a17/a17.eva1.trvrs.jpg">pre-flight map</a> made from the best Apollo 15 images shows the area around Camelot. There are two blocks marked on the north rim and one on the east rim. The outlined, light-colored areas on the west rim were possible locations for boulders. Station 5 was planned for the southwest rim, subject to change depending on what Gene and Jack found as the drove by on the way to Station 2.
141:40:29|ALSJ|CDR|I don't remember if 'two-blocked' is an old Navy term or what. But it means 'I've got it all the way out, hell bent for fire.'
141:40:36|ALSJ|LMP|We were driving down-Sun and that made craters hard to see despite the relatively level terrain.
141:40:36|ALSJ|CDR|One of the advantages of being the Commander and driving the Rover was that you knew when you were going to turn. It's just like what might happen if I took you on an airplane and did some acrobatics. I would know what I was doing and could anticipate the maneuvers, but you might start feeling uncomfortable, not being prepared, unless I really tried to talk you through everything.
141:41:07|ALSJ||The raindrop pattern that Jack is describing is caused by micrometeor impacts and looks rather like the pattern a light rain makes on dry, dusty ground. Jack's @alsjurl/a17/a17.1414113_trv.jpg"@alsjt>nineteen photos</a> taken during the drive to Camelot are AS17-135-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20570"@alsjt>20570</a> to 20588. Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20586"@alsjt>20586</a> shows the Scarp as they top a high point east of the Camelot rim.
141:42:35|ALSJ||Gene turns the Rover so that Jack can take photos of Camelot without having to twist his body. Jack's photos of the crater interior are AS17-135-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20589"@alsjt>20589</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20590"@alsjt>20590</a>.
141:42:35|ALSJ||These initial Camelot photos are combined in @alsjurl/a17/a17.1414235_trv.jpg"@alsjt>strip form</a> with a set Jack takes as they drive along the rim - @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20589"@alsjt>20589</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20589"@alsjt>20597</a>.
141:42:53|ALSJ||Jack is a little frustrated with Bob's interruptions. Both Jack and Bob, once they start talking, tend to charge ahead and, consequently, talk over each other more than would have been the case with, for example, Gordon Fullerton or Joe Allen as CapCom and, say, Al Bean (Apollo 12) or Jim Irwin (Apollo 15) as the LMP.
141:42:53|ALSJ|CDR|Bob and Jack were always bantering back and forth, from training right on through the flight. Although it was all meant in fun and they both had a sort of subtle sense of humor, the interruptions did sometimes bother Jack, particularly when he had something he felt was important to say.
141:42:53|ALSJ||The traverse started from the SEP transmitter at 141:30:33. In 12 minutes 17 seconds, Gene has driven 1.2 km and is now at a range from the SEP of 1.0 kilometers. His average speed, including the stop to deploy the first charge, is about 5.9 km/hr and his range rate - the rate at which the range is changing - is 4.9 km/hr. Because Gene's average heading has been directly away from the SEP transmitter, the difference between his average speed and range rate is due to the need to drive around craters.
141:42:55|ALSJ||Gene has turned south and the crater Jack describes next may be the one shown in AS17-135-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20591"@alsjt>20591</a>.
141:43:07|ALSJ||Jack is referring to the large group of boulders on right side of AS17-135-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20592"@alsjt>20592</a>. Note that Gene is on a heading south of the one to Hole-in-the Wall as he skirts the boulder field. In the next of Jack's traverse photos, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20593"@alsjt>20593</a> we see that Gene has steered even farther to the south to get around the boulders.
141:44:00|ALSJ||Frame AS17-135-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20594"@alsjt>20594</a> shows Gene driving on a more westerly heading as he skirts the Station 5 boulder field.
141:44:19|ALSJ|LMP|The light-colored areas on the rim of Camelot turned out to be that way because of reflections off of all of the rocky material, rather from an albedo difference of the soil. And it may be that the regolith on the west side was shallower for some reason, so that more blocks were dug out there.
141:44:27|ALSJ||In frame AS17-135-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20595"@alsjt>20595</a>, the boulders on the right are near the southwest rim of Camelot. Gene has now resumed a heading toward Hole-in-the-Wall.
141:44:27|ALSJ||Frames @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20596"@alsjt>20596</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20597"@alsjt>20597</a> show progressively fewer blocks as they get father from Camelot.
141:44:27|ALSJ||As indicated on Gene's @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_cdr0809.jpg"@alsjt>cuff checklist page 8</a> he plans to continue on a heading toward Hole-in-the-Wall and pass immediately south of Horatio which he will do, as indicated in a @alsjurl/a17/a17psrf6-3cam.jpg"@alsjt>detail</a> from @alsjurl/a17/a17psrf6-3.jpg"@alsjt>Figure 6-3</a> in the @alsjurl/a17/as17psr.pdf"@alsjt>Apollo 17 Preliminary Science Report</a>. Jack's statement probably means " we've left Camelot and are going toward Horatio" rather than "going between" in the sense of heading northwest and having Camelot on the right and Horatio on the left. They will cover that ground during the return drive from Victory.
141:44:27|ALSJ||Jack's next @alsjurl/a17/a17.1414428_trv.jpg"@alsjt>nine traverse photos</a>, taken once they get out of the Camelot block fields, are AS17-135-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20598"@alsjt>20598</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20606"@alsjt>20606</a>.
141:45:10|ALSJ|LMP|The presence of vesicles usually imply that the rock solidified in the top of a lava flow where the cooling is quick enough to temporarily trap the gas that makes the vesicles. The inner parts of the flow don't cool that fast and the gas usually has a chance to escape. And what I was trying to do at Camelot was try to see how many flows the crater might have penetrated. Was there just one flow top, or several? I don't think we really had the time to do that, even when we got back to Camelot at the end of the EVA; but if you could get out and walk around, that's what you would try to do.
141:45:11|ALSJ|LMP|I was trying to estimate the largest size of crater that had formed everywhere on the surface. And that's roughly a function of age. Because bigger impactors are relatively rare, the older the surface, the larger the saturation crater size.
141:45:36|ALSJ||They are about 140 meters south of where they will do Station 5 at the end of the EVA.

Note that, in the figures, Hole-in-the-Wall is called the Access Region.

141:46:11|ALSJ||That is, rocks cover about one percent of the surface in this area.
141:47:02|ALSJ||"Instant rock" or, more properly, "regolith breccia" is soil solidified by an impact.
141:48:21|ALSJ|CDR|We didn't go down in any big craters; this was probably a shallow depression of some kind.
141:48:21|ALSJ||AS17-135-20609 may show the Rover tilt as Gene drives into a depression here.
141:48:26|ALSJ||Apparently, Gene is driving right along the Horatio rim.
141:48:26|ALSJ|CDR|The reason the roll seemed like it was a lot was because, in one-sixth gravity, you're not anchored down the way you are in earth gravity.
141:48:42|ALSJ||Journal Contributor notes that Jack's estimate of a 20-30 meter regolith thickness was later confirmed by analysis of data from the Surface Electrical Experiment (SEP) and the Lunar Seismic Profiling (LSP) experiment.
141:49:41|ALSJ||Jack's @alsjurl/a17/a17.1414947_trv.jpg"@alsjt>thirteen photos</a> taken during this portion of the traverse are AS17-135- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20610"@alsjt>20610</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20622"@alsjt>20622</a>.
141:50:54|ALSJ||Journal Contributor David Harland notes that, although there are occasional comments about visibility, Gene is not having anything like the troubles that John Young had with down-Sun wash-out on the first Apollo 16 traverse. The main difference is that while John was driving almost directly down-Sun and, hence, was getting the full effect of zero phase, Gene is driving in a direction different enough from directly down-Sun to reduce the effect. In detail, during the Apollo 16 traverse to Station 1, the solar azimuth was about 84 degrees and the average bearing to the LM from the Rover was about 87 degrees: a difference of only 3 degrees. In contrast, during this traverse to Hole-in-the-Wall, the solar azimuth is about 101 degrees and the average bearing to the LM has been about 78 degrees, a difference of 13 degrees. Because Gene is having to maneuver around craters, he is not driving a straight-line course and, therefore, does occasionally have to deal with the full effects of zero-phase. On average, however, he is has less of an effect to deal with than John did.
141:50:54|ALSJ||The almost complete lack of detail at zero phase is due, in part, to objects hiding their own shadows and, most importantly, to a dramatic brightening caused by the phenomenon of @alsjurl/coherentbcksctr.html"@alsjt>Coherent Backscatter</a>.
141:51:21|ALSJ||Houston is using the Camelot and Horatio fixes to re-estimate the location of the SEP transmitter.
141:52:22|ALSJ|LMP|It was a puzzle, seeing apparent lineations on the slopes of mountains. Some people, as I recall, did some simulations, building models, putting random roughness on the surface, and then dusting them and moving the light around, and they were able to create apparent lineations just with light position. Generally, I think, people don't feel that they represent any underlying structure: it's just an accident of dusting and lighting. The massifs do have layers in them - layers of debris - and I think the fact that you see what appear to be zones of blocks at the top is probably a layer of relatively hard material. But they really are gross layers.
141:52:22|ALSJ|CDR|While we were in orbit, we looked at the landing site as much as we could, partly to update our position and partly to get a feel for what it was going to be like. I wanted to get a map of it in my brain so that I'd know where we were going. Of course, the valley went by very quickly, so it wasn't like we had a chance to study it for five or ten minutes. And sometimes, if you weren't right on top of the fact of when it was coming up, it would be gone. You'd miss it. Things aren't instantaneously recognizable from orbit and you have to know when to start looking and what you're looking for.
141:52:22|ALSJ||About four hours after they first entered lunar orbit, the Apollo 17 crew fired the Service Propulsion engine to put themselves into an elliptical orbit with its low point about 27 kilometers (14.5 nautical miles) above the landing site. They stayed in that orbit for nearly twenty revolutions prior to the start of the descent. From an altitude of 27 kilometers over the landing site, the horizon is about 300 kilometers ahead of the spacecraft, a distance covered in about 3 minutes and 20 seconds. The forward viewing angle into the valley was greater than 45 degrees for only about 20 seconds on each pass.
141:52:46|ALSJ||AS17-135- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20616"@alsjt>20616</a> is an excellent picture of the portion of the light mantle draped over the east-facing scarp.
141:53:39|ALSJ|LMP|Secondary craters, formed by ejecta from other lunar impacts, have a much lower energy and they tend to be more irregular, more elongate, and may have a blob of material in the bottom. The projectiles that form primary impacts hit at about 20 km/s, and that's an explosion. Most of the ejecta leaves the Moon entirely; very little of it falls back on the Moon. At most, the stuff that makes secondaries travels half way around the Moon and hits at 1.5 km/s and doesn't throw ejecta very far at all.
141:53:52|ALSJ||Jack's next @alsjurl/a17/a17.1415341_trv.jpg"@alsjt>four pictures</a>, AS17-135- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20623"@alsjt>20623</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20626"@alsjt>20626</a> show their approach to the secondary crater.
141:54:03|ALSJ||They've traveled 2.6 kilometers of straight-line distance in 23 minutes since leaving the SEP. The stops have kept their average speed to a modest 6.8 kph thus far.
141:55:09|ALSJ||Jack has collected a piece of rock with the @alsjurl/tools/judy80.gif"@alsjt>LRV Sampler</a> and is now swinging the head across so that Gene can remove the Dixie cup and seal it. This procedure takes far less time than Jack would take trying to get the Dixie cup off himself.
141:55:09|ALSJ||Training photo @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#72H1227"@alsjt>72-H-1227</a> shows Jack using the sampler from his Rover seat. He is leaning slightly to his right and has a grip on the accessory staff with his left hand for stability. He probably has turned his head inside the helmet so he can see what he is getting although, as he notes in a 2000 e-mail message: "The sampler was mainly just for collecting representative samples of regolith fines along the traverse route, so seeing what you grabbed was not critical most of the time." Note the maps mounted on the accessory staff and the SCB hanging below the maps. The SEP receiving antenna is behind Jack's head.
141:55:43|ALSJ||This sample, 72135, proved to be a breccia, a probable confirmation that it was a piece of the projectile.
141:55:44|ALSJ||Gene is putting the sample in the SCB hanging from the accessory staff.
141:56:15|ALSJ||Their "locators" are AS17-135- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20627"@alsjt>20627</a> and AS17-137- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20895"@alsjt>20895</a>.
141:56:29|ALSJ||AS17-135- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20628"@alsjt>20628</a> is taken toward the south as Gene turns to get back on course toward Hole-in-the-Wall.
141:57:02|ALSJ||That is, they want to be sure to get a sample in the light mantle, no matter what the Nav system says about their range and bearing.
141:57:10|ALSJ||In the overhead pictures, there is a narrow finger of light mantle east of the main mass of the avalanche and separated from it by about a kilometer width of the darker material.
141:57:15|ALSJ||That is, on the 260 heading, they are pointed right at Hole-in-the-Wall.
141:57:27|ALSJ||Gene occasionally moves the low-gain antenna to keep it pointed at the Earth.
141:57:33|ALSJ||As noted at 141:55:43, Jack was correct in thinking that the sample was not a piece of gabbro but, rather, was a piece of the projectile.
141:57:51|ALSJ||The diameter of Bronte Crater is about 200 meters, about one third the size of Camelot. AS17-135- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20629"@alsjt>20629</a> may be Jack's photo of the crater.
141:57:58|ALSJ||Gene is having to make a major detour and, as he maneuvers, doesn't have a hand free to keep the low-gain antenna aimed.
141:57:58|ALSJ|CDR|The low-gain was mounted in front of the control stick at my right hand. Most of the time I could drive and manipulate the low-gain at the same time, reaching across with my left hand to move it, probably not with the greatest of ease, but I do recall being able to do that. But, you know, if you got too many things going and you were making lots of turns you just couldn't sit there twisting that low-gain until you got to some reasonably steady course.
141:58:23|ALSJ||Jack's next @alsjurl/a17/a17.1415829_trv.jpg"@alsjt>seven pictures</a> are AS17-135- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20630"@alsjt>20630</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20636"@alsjt>20636</a>. Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20630"@alsjt>20630</a> is a good photo of Hanover Crater, the sharp-rimmed feature on the lower slopes of the North Massif.
141:59:03|ALSJ||The traverse started at 141:30:33 and Gene has driven 3.5 km. The range to the SEP transmitter is 2.9 km. Including the stops, Gene's average speed has been 7.4 km/hr and his range rate has been 6.1 km/hr. Because he has been driving directly away from the SEP transmitter most of the time, the difference between his average speed and the range rate is the result of zigs and zags he has taken to get around craters.
142:00:43|ALSJ||Gene is referring to the difficulty that Charlie Duke and John Young had in detecting albedo changes during the Apollo 16 traverses.
142:00:43|ALSJ|CDR|I don't know what we're going to run into next in the transcript, but I remember that when we drove onto the light mantle, although we talked about being able to see it from a distance, the albedo change was so subtle we really had to convince ourselves that we were there. It wasn't like suddenly going from dark to light, it was just fine-grained, subtle changes.
142:02:48|ALSJ||Jack's traverse pictures indicate that the maps clipped to the Accessory Staff are partially blocking his field-of-view.
142:02:54|ALSJ||Although Jack's camera problems are not discussed in the Apollo 17 Mission Report, Pete Conrad and Al Bean experienced similar problems on their missions and @alsjurl/a12/a12.mr14_45.gif"@alsjt>Figure 14-45</a> from the Apollo 12 Mission Report illustrates the situation. With the handle loose, Jack will still be able to take pictures by using his finger to push the button that is just below the lens; however, he is going to have a problem keeping a grip on the camera. Because the bracket with which the camera is affixed to the RCU joins the camera at the top of the handle, a loose handle means that the camera isn't secure and to keep from losing the camera, the trigger, or any of the attachment hardware, Jack is going to have to keep a firm grip with at least one hand. See, also, the discussion at 142:35:20. My thanks to Brian Lawrence, who "triggered" this comment.
142:03:29|ALSJ||Gene is still pre-occupied with the problem of detecting the albedo change when they cross it.
142:03:29|ALSJ|CDR|We wanted to know when we were up on the white mantle and we expected it was going to be a very subtle change. Here, we could see it coming; but I distinctly remember that it was very difficult to find a definitive line between the light and the dark mantle.
142:04:04|ALSJ||Jack's next @alsjurl/a17/a17.1420410_trv.jpg"@alsjt>four pictures</a>, AS17-135- 20637 to 20640 are from this part of the traverse. Frames @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20637"@alsjt>20637</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20640"@alsjt>20640</a> show bright craters.
142:04:48|ALSJ||Gene's average speed, including stops, is now 7.7 km/hr and the range rate is 6.7 km/hr. The difference indicates that, in making detours around craters, Gene has driven about 15 percent farther than the straight-line distance. This is sometimes called the "wander factor".
142:05:00|ALSJ||AS17-135- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20641"@alsjt>20641</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20642"@alsjt>20642</a> show their approach to the sample site.

142:08:56|ALSJ||Journal Contributor David Harland notes "Here, Jack is talking about having been fooled, during EVA-1, by the zap-pit halos into thinking there was more plagioclase in the gabbro than there really is. The false lightness in color produced by the zap pits led him to estimate 50 percent plage, rather than 30 percent. He realized his error after EVA-1 when he was able to study a sample in the LM, out of the glare of the Sun.
142:09:09|ALSJ||That is, by trying to avoid going into one crater, Gene gets them in another.
142:09:14|ALSJ||A sketch map of the second half of the traverse in shown (identically) on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_cdr1011.jpg"@alsjt>LMP-10</a> and CDR-10. The planned bearing/range at the turn near Lara is 080/5.5 and at Station 2 near Nansen is 063/7.2. The area below the dashed line that goes through Wagner Crater was mapped, pre-flight as dark mantle, as was the Tortilla Flats area that Gene is about to enter.
142:09:49|ALSJ|LMP|Formation of the massifs was part of a dynamic process; and the hard layers represented by the blocks near the crest are part of the evidence of that process. You had a relatively flat part of the Moon which was hit by a great big impact. It was virtually a point explosion, just like a nuclear explosion; and then, whatever was there was folded back. And, at least with the big, basin-forming impacts, you had a lot of molten material that formed in the instant cavity; and that stuff probably moved outward, too. Dynamic pressure forced the molten material to flow up and out of the cavity and on top of the rocks that form the Massifs. And since the top layers solidified out of partially molten material, that may be partially why they're harder. And then, subsequent to that - although you're still talking about the first few seconds or minutes after the Serenitatis impact - you get these radial grabens that form due to the dilation of the area that's been impacted. Parts of the rim of Serenitatis fell and formed what's called a graben, and the Valley of Taurus-Littrow is one of those radial grabens.
142:11:08|ALSJ||The SEP is eight degrees north of east from their position; they have traveled 5.0 kilometers since leaving the LM; and they are now 4.3 kilometers from the Nav initialization point. Gene's average speed is now 7.4 km/hr and the range rate is 6.5 kph. Both @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_cdr0809.jpg"@alsjt>LMP-9 and CDR-9</a> indicate a range for the contact of 4.0 km and a dark mantle sample at 4.2 km.
142:11:56|ALSJ||Because the Dixie cup is one in a stack, Jack can't see into it without changing his grip on the sampler.
142:12:45|ALSJ||The "locators" for this sample are AS17-135-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20649"@alsjt>20649</a> and AS17-137- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20897"@alsjt>20897</a>. Both are excellent photos and, among other things, show Hanover Crater and, just to the west (left) of it, the Scarp running up onto the North Massif.
142:13:05|ALSJ||This observation suggests that the Scarp formed after the mountain was raised.
142:13:12|ALSJ||Gene tries to put the two folded Dixie cups in the SCB hanging on the accessory staff. Apparently, he has trouble reaching across and gives the samples to Jack to put in the SCB.
142:13:12|ALSJ||Jack may be in danger of losing the LRV sampler.
142:14:13|ALSJ||That is, the North Massif has lineations east of the Scarp, but not at the Scarp itself.
142:14:47|ALSJ||Somewhere in here, Gene takes AS17-137- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20898"@alsjt>20898</a>, showing the South Massif and the Scarp. Jack's next @alsjurl/a17/a17.1421500_trv.jpg"@alsjt> next four photos</a> are AS17-135- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20650"@alsjt>20650</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20653"@alsjt>20653</a>.
142:15:20|ALSJ||Gene is making ten to twelve kilometers per hour on level terrain. However, even "level" terrain has plenty of hummocks formed by the rims of old, subdued craters. In order to maintain speed and get maximum use of their time and supplies of oxygen and cooling water, Gene is driving over blind crests without slowing, keeping his eye on the road so that he can brake and then turn if necessary. All craters big enough to be real hazards to the Rover are shown on the maps and, as well, are usually surrounded by enough ejecta that there is no real danger of coming upon one without warning. However, particularly when driving down-Sun, or when cresting a small rise, they sometimes come upon a small, fresh crater without warning and get quite a jolt. Because of the rough ride, seatbelts are absolutely essential.
142:15:20|ALSJ|CDR|You couldn't spent very much time sightseeing, and that's why Jack's doing most of the descriptions. Every once in a while you could steal a glance but, if you didn't get right back to watching where you were going, you'd get in trouble...especially the little craters.
142:15:45|ALSJ||That is, their average speed is high enough that they will have plenty of time to complete the planned activities at Nansen before moving on. They are currently 4.3 kilometers from the SEP site and have been driving, stops included, for 45 minutes. Their average range rate is 5.7 km/hr.
142:16:53|ALSJ||An impact will penetrate to a depth equal to about one-quarter of the diameter of the crater it produces. Blocks in a 50-meter crater would suggest regolith depth of less than 12 meters.
142:17:15|ALSJ|LMP|In principle, the term 'gabbro' has no genetic meaning but, rather, indicates a crystalline rock composed of roughly equal parts of the minerals pyroxene and plagioclase. However, here we were seeing rocks derived from lava flows that were thick enough that the rock cooled slowly enough that millimeter-sized crystals formed. They aren't very fine-grained like most basalts that cool very quickly, but neither are they as large-grained as the anorthosites found at Apollo 15 which cooled much, much more slowly, at depth within the crust. And, of course, these rocks weren't the breccias characteristic of highlands material.
142:17:33|ALSJ||AS17-137- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20899"@alsjt>20899</a> and AS17-135- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20654"@alsjt>20654</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20656"@alsjt>20656</a> are photos taken somewhere in this part of the traverse.
142:17:44|ALSJ||Hole-in-the-Wall is the juncture between a lobe of the Scarp and the main Scarp face, a geologic equivalent of the web of flesh between a person's thumb and forefinger. Avalanche material overlies both features. Hole-in-the-Wall was spotted in pre-mission photographs as a plausible path up to the top of the 80-m-high Scarp.
142:17:44|ALSJ|CDR|We were concerned about what we were going to find at Hole-in-the-Wall and what path we were going to take to get up the Scarp. I don't remember exactly, but I'm sure we must have looked at the Scarp from orbit.
142:18:04|ALSJ||The average range rate is now 6.3 kph. They are about 0.5 kilometers from Hole-in-the-Wall. The location of Hole-in-the-Wall is shown on a pre-flight @alsjurl/a17/a17.handmap.gif"@alsjt> map</a> with handwritten feature names. Note the name change from Amundsen to Nansen. The expected view from 1/2 kilometer derived from pre-flight estimates of surface elevations is linked @alsjurl/a17/a17.bellf5.jpg"@alsjt>here</a>. The expected views were produced from data extracted from photographs taken from the Apollo 15 Command Module and, despite the low resolution of those photos, these views bear at least some resemblance to what Gene and Jack are seeing.
142:18:42|ALSJ||There is a great deal of glass in the lunar soil and, at the down-Sun or "zero-phase" point, the reflected sunlight can be quite bright - more so here on the light mantle than on the dark mantle.
142:19:00|ALSJ||They're going into a small crater.
142:19:19|ALSJ||Up to this point, they haven't been able to see enough detail to tell whether or not Hole-in-the-Wall will be a good place to climb the Scarp.
142:20:01|ALSJ||Driving the Rover takes concentration and a fair amount of effort. As indicated in the table at 151:03:03, while they are riding, Gene's metabolic rate is about 10% higher than Jack's.
142:20:58|ALSJ|LMP|Because of the stiffness of the suits, our field-of-view was pretty much restricted to straight ahead. We could turn our heads a little in the suits and could gesture with our arms, but even then, Gene could really only see a gesture if I made it with my inboard arm.
142:20:58|ALSJ||Their current position is about 081/5.3. Nemo has a 400 meter diameter They are about 400 meters northwest of the near rim.
142:21:10|ALSJ|LMP|Lara is almost certainly a crater that pre-dates the avalanche. The avalanche rode over it and, indeed, in the good photographs you can see some subflows (secondary slides) down the slopes into it.
142:22:21|ALSJ||The Station 3 stop will be made at the base of the Scarp, just north of Lara, after they finish their activities at Nansen Crater and have driven back down onto the valley floor.
142:24:25|ALSJ||The average range rate is now 6.5 kph. Up to this point in the traverse, Gene has maintained a more or less constant heading of about 260 degrees and, consequently, the range rate is equivalent to the net outbound speed. With the change in heading, the range rate will no longer be a direct measure of the net speed. From here to Nansen, Gene will drive a map distance of 2.2 kilometers in 19 minutes for a net speed of 6.9 kph. Jack's sequence of @alsjurl/a17/a17.1422417_trv.jpg"@alsjt>eight photos</a> taken during the climb up Hole-in-the Wall is AS17-135- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20657"@alsjt>20657</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20664"@alsjt>20664</a>. The white crater that Jack will mention in a moment in visible in all the photos.
142:27:03|ALSJ||Gene's average heading during the drive from Hole-in-the-Wall to Nansen will be about 225.
142:28:24|ALSJ||"Zap pits" are small craters blasted into the surfaces of rocks by sand-grain-sized impactors. On the gabbros, Jack noted white halos of fractured minerals created around the craters.
142:29:10|ALSJ||The Rover is designed to handle loose slopes of up to 25 degrees. Steeper slopes can be handled by driving cross slope.
142:29:59|ALSJ||Since starting the drive up Hole-in-the-Wall, they've driven about 600 meters in 5 minutes for a net speed of 7 kph. They've climbed about 80 meters up from the valley floor. Jack's photo at the crest is AS17-135- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20665"@alsjt>20665</a>.
142:30:05|ALSJ||From the LM, Gene and Jack had seen tracks made long ago by boulders as they tumbled downhill from outcrops high on both the North and South Massifs. Some of the North Massif tracks were visible in the pre-mission photography taken from orbit during Apollo 15.
142:30:05|ALSJ|CDR|As I recall, from orbit you really had to look for the tracks. If you could find one of the very big boulders you could trace the tracks on the slopes of the massifs. On the surface they were relatively easy to see from the LM. I don't think most of them jumped right out at you because there is so much subtlety. But, especially if you could find a boulder, you could see the tracks pretty readily.
142:30:39|ALSJ||By sampling boulders that are clearly identified with boulder tracks, they can be sure of sampling rocks derived from outcrops high on the mountain.
142:30:59|ALSJ||Jack's next @alsjurl/a17/a17.1423103_trv.jpg"@alsjt>six photos</a>, taken during the drive toward Nansen, are AS17-135- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20666"@alsjt>20666</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20671"@alsjt>20671</a>.
142:31:18|ALSJ||From a position at the base of the Scarp, it will be impossible to prove whether these were true outcrops of bedrock or just concentrations of partially buried boulders. However, given the steepness of the slopes on the upper mountain and the fact that the visible boulders are bigger than any plausible thickness of the regolith, the odds are very good that these are genuine outcrops.
142:32:01|ALSJ||<blockquote>>i>Although they have finished climbing the scarp, they still can't see the base of the South Massif. There is a trench-like depression at the base of the mountain and they will need to get closer before they will be able to see the planned Station 2 location.
142:32:36|ALSJ||Lunar breccias are rocks made up of fragments of other rocks, and even soils, welded together during large impact events.
142:33:12|ALSJ||Jack means that they can visually follow the tracks from the boulders up to the source outcrop.
142:33:37|ALSJ||A box of Apollo 17 planning material given by Bob Parker to the Johnson Space Center History Office contains a large map of Taurus-Littrow with the names of features written in with a colored, felt-tipped pen. From the evidence of that @alsjurl/a17/a17.handmap.gif"@alsjt>map</a>, the original name of the feature Gene and Jack are approaching was "Amundsen", but that name was then crossed out and replaced with "Nansen". They are currently about 500 meters from the north edge of Nansen.
142:33:37|ALSJ|LMP|The printing on the map is not mine and I don't specifically remember changing the name; but I wouldn't be surprised if I oscillated back and forth between Amundsen and Nansen. Amundsen gets so much credit, at least in the United States, that I may have decided that Nansen was the unsung hero of Arctic exploration. Or, somebody may have pointed out that Amundsen already has a crater at the Moon's South Pole.
142:33:52|ALSJ||This crater shows well in AS17-135- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20672"@alsjt>20672</a> which was taken at about this point in the drive. Station 2 is just out of sight below the center of the image.
142:34:35|ALSJ||They are only seeing the upper parts of Nansen.
142:35:16|ALSJ||Throughout most of the drive, Jack has had to keep a hand tightly closed around the camera. Because he has had to grip constantly against the stiffness of the pressurized suit, his hands are now aching, despite switching them as often as seemed prudent.
142:35:49|ALSJ||A comparison of labelled details (@alsjurl/a17/a17M104318871NansenLaraP2309lbl.jpg"@alsjt>2.9 Mb</a>) from LROC image M104318871 (sun in the west) and Apollo 17 Pan Camera frame AS17-P-2309 (sun low in the east) highlight Nansen and the portion of the trough that extends northwest of it along the base of the South Massif.
142:35:49|ALSJ|LMP|Nansen isn't actually an impact crater but, rather, is an anomalously-deep, elongated depression that is part of the trough. It isn't filled as much as other parts of the trough. From the gravity measurements we know that, just before the mare lavas filled the valley, the difference in elevation from the valley floor to the tops of the South Massif may have been something of the order of four to five kilometers. That is, there appears to be now about two kilometers of mare basalt filling the valley. Originally the elevation difference was even more than four or five kilometers because there is strong evidence that the mountains have been subsiding over time, enough so that you never accumulate a talus at the base. The evidence of this is the trough that runs along the base of the massif. If you imagine a steeply dipping-fault between the South Massif and the original valley and the mountain subsiding relative to the valley, then the fault tends to open and either the talus tends to accumulate or you get a trough or both. Most people think that, once those mountains formed, they stayed relatively quiet; but the trough implies that there's been activity essentially up to the present. Otherwise, you would have filled up those troughs. Essentially, the gap is opening up as fast - or faster - than talus is accumulating, from a volume point of view. The average exposure age of the talus material is very low and does not correspond to the age of the mountain. The mountain formed 3.9 billion years ago and the exposure age of the soils in the trough is a few hundred thousand years.

A third boulder is labeled 'c' to help identify the overall pattern.
142:36:39|ALSJ|CDR|I'm an engineer and I think the greatest asset that education gave me was the ability to think logically and, rather than getting engrossed in the detail of a problem, be able to back off and start to figure out where you are, what it's all about, and start to focus in on the important parts. Too many people try to put the screw in the hole before they find out it's the wrong screw for the hole. In looking at the valley from orbit, I started out looking at it geographically and then topographically; and then, when we got down in among 'em - among the rocks and boulder - I could start to look at it geologically. To start with, I wanted to be sure that when I got down in that valley I would always know where I was. When I was near Nansen, I wanted to be sure in my mind what was to the north and what was back to the east, even if I couldn't see very far in those directions from the ground. I wanted to have a feel for where I was; not from a navigation point of view but from a geographic point of view. And then I wanted to understand the topography, which you can't fully appreciate until you literally get down to the surface. From orbit, Tracy's Rock (at Station 6) doesn't mean anything; but, when you get down in there, you can appreciate the slopes and the sizes of the boulders and the craters. And then, once you have the big picture, you can get into the geology. Basically, I'm a pilot. I was also a well-trained geologic observer, but I wasn't a geologist and probably never would have been and never will be. So, being a pilot, I like to know where I am all the time; I like to know what my surroundings are; I like to know what environment I'm in; I like to be able to anticipate; I like to be able to prepare. When you're a flyer, the environment that surrounds you - if you will, the 'geography' - includes the weather and the traffic. Not just the mountains, but a lot of things. And on the Moon, if you have a feel for the geography and the topography, when you start rambling through this valley you're not going to be too surprised by what you find. You're going to anticipate - which is very important - and, in many cases, you're going to know what to expect. Now, when you get on the slopes, and you get among the boulders, and you pass over the rims of those craters, those are the things you can't see or feel from orbit. So the Moon does take on a new dimension at the surface; but, at least you've got this background, this feel for the environment that you got from orbit; and that helps you.
142:36:39|ALSJ|CDR|People ask all the time if I was ever scared; and my answer to that, without hesitation, is 'No.' Apprehensive? 'Yes.' But I was never scared. Because, to me, fear is what happens when you're confronted with the unknown. Now, it's not that we didn't have many surprises on our flights. But we were aware of where we were, of what we were doing, and of what the risks were. We had a broad knowledge of our own personal capabilities and had confidence in our abilities to handle the unknowns. We had a broad knowledge of the hardware we were flying and how to manipulate it around problems. Could the Saturn V have blown up on lift-off, could we have not had ignition on the lift-off from the Moon, could a suit have sprung a leak? Sure, all those things could have happened. But you don't sit and worry about them. If I tell you to walk through a door into a dark room and walk out a door on the other side without telling you whether there's bears, rattlesnakes, alligators, or bogeymen in that room, you're probably going to be scared. But if I say 'This room has a Grizzly Bear over in one corner' - and you're dedicated to getting to the other side - you're going to learn all about the life of a Grizzly Bear: when he eats, when he sleeps, what he does in the darkness. You're going to understand all those things and you're going to develop confidence in you're ability to deal with him. Now, a Grizzly Bear can act in an unusual way just as a spacecraft can; but, while you may be apprehensive as hell when you open that door, you won't be scared because you will have thought through all of the things that are likely to happen.
142:37:29|ALSJ||Gene can see how much dust the front wheels are throwing up under the fender and is thinking what it would be like driving without the replacement.
142:37:45|ALSJ||Gene is talking about getting pictures with the 500-mm camera; Jack is suggesting that they would get a better view from a position farther to the north.
142:37:58|ALSJ||Out on the valley floor, fillets are formed exclusively by ejecta from local impacts splashing against the sides of rocks and building up skirts of soil. On steep slopes, downhill movement of regolith can also contribute to fillet formation.
142:38:51|ALSJ||From the spacecraft, the Massif summit is at an elevation of 11 degrees and the Earth at 45 degrees. Now, as they get closer and closer to the base of the mountain, the summit fills more of the sky and Gene's first statement suggests that the summit elevation from their current position is about two-thirds of 45 degrees, or 30 degrees. At 143:20:14, Fendell will use the TV to look at Earth and one can estimate that it is about 20 degrees above the apparent summit and, therefore that the apparent summit is at an elevation of about 25 degrees at Station 2. The agreement with Gene's estimate is quite satisfactory. Another reason to believe that Gene is not talking about the LM is the fact that he is driving southwest, away from the spacecraft so that, even if they were not down in the trough, he wouldn't be able to see it. As for the second half of Gene's statement, if the Earth disappeared behind the mountain, they would have to communicate with Houston through the LM, probably at a considerable loss of signal quality, so he'd rather not lose sight of Earth.
142:39:11|ALSJ||The North and South Massifs are 2000m and 2300m tall, respectively. In English units, the elevations are about 6500 ft and 7500 feet.
142:39:11|ALSJ|CDR|I think some mountains on Earth impress you as being taller than the Massifs. Up to the west of Calgary, the northern Rockies look very tall and impressive and they do rise up to 11 or 12,000 feet above sea level. But there, you're in a valley that is probably already at 6 or 7,000 feet and, so, the peaks are really only 4 or 5,000 feet above you. The Massifs, on the other hand, rise maybe 8,000 feet straight up from the valley floor. What was really impressive about the Massifs, however, was how massive they were; they were so massive they overpowered you. Visually, they weren't overly impressive; they didn't have the cliffs and abrupt breaks and snow-cover that you see in the Rockies; but they were massive, jumbo mountains. I use the word 'jumbo' because they weren't antagonistic-looking mountains; they weren't jagged; they weren't rugged; they were just jumbo in size. Mt. Rainier (4392 m) near Seattle gives you something of the same feeling. Not from Seattle, itself, because that's too far away, but maybe from twenty or thirty miles from the mountain. But Rainier is just one mountain and we were in a valley surrounded by jumbo mountains. On Earth, I've certainly never seen anything else like them.
142:39:11|ALSJ||Like Mt. Rainier, Mt. Kilimanjaro in northern Tanzania is a volcanic peak that stands by itself in relatively flat country. The summit elevation is 5830 m and, although the surrounding countryside has an elevation of about 2000 meters, the vertical rise of 3800 m is actually greater than the 2300 m of the South Massif. At its base, the South Massif is about 20 kilometers across, while Kilimanjaro is about 60 km across.
142:39:55|ALSJ||During mission planning, it was assumed that, should the Rover fail at any point during the traverse, the astronauts could walk back to the LM at an average speed of 2.7 km/hr, using cooling water and oxygen about 25 percent faster than they would have during normal activities (1290 BTU/hr rather than 1000 BTU/hr). On this traverse, the longest ever conducted during Apollo, cooling water budgets are rather tight and, at Station 2, Gene and Jack are about as far as they can get from the LM and still have a reasonable amount of time to do geology.
142:39:55|ALSJ||In this case, I believe Bob is referring not to walkback but to 'driveback' in the case of a PLSS failure, which would force them to drive back sharing cooling water from the good PLSS and using the OPS on the top of the failed PLSS to provide oxygen at low-flow. As indicated in @alsjurl/a17/a17lspSect4.4.pdf"@alsjt>Section 4.4</a> of the Apollo 17 @alsjurl/a17/a17lsp.html"@alsjt>Final Lunar Surface Procedures</a>, the OPSs each contained 5.34 pounds of usable oxygen in the low-flow mode and expended it at the rate of 3.8 lb/hr, giving the astronauts 80 minutes to get back to the Rover, get the BLSS hoses hooked up, drive back to the LM, and get into the cabin and get it pressurized. It has been about 70 minutes since they left the LM and Bob seems to be saying that the drive can't go on much longer or there won't be enough time for an emergency return.
142:39:55|ALSJ|CDR|We had lots of discussions about walkback and the rules that we came up with were generally compromises. If some of the real conservative people had had their way, we wouldn't have gone more than a mile from the LM; but we finally decided that we wouldn't consider a worst-case worst case of both the Rover and one of the PLSSs failing. Otherwise, there wouldn't have been much point in taking the Rover. If you didn't fight for what you thought was right, you'd go all the way to the Moon but be so limited in your capabilities that you couldn't get anything done because you were afraid of a failure. When you go all the way to the Moon, you've got to take some risks. It's like having a two-foot putt to win the Masters and then lagging it because you don't want to three-putt. You don't want to take unnecessary risks; but the Rover had four drive motors and two sets of batteries and the chance of both the Rover and one of the PLSSs failing was pretty small.
142:41:39|ALSJ||That is, on the steep Massif slope that rises up out of the south side of Nansen.
142:42:41|ALSJ||Gene will park the Rover pointing northeast. The main reason for this is that the high-gain antenna will then point back over the Rover and Gene will be able to look into the boresight while standing comfortably in front. The checklist pages describing the stop at Nansen are @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_lmp11.gif"@alsjt>LMP-11</a>, @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_lmp12.gif"@alsjt>LMP-12</a>, and @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_lmp13.gif"@alsjt>LMP-13</a>. Gene has identical pages. Generally, the items listed for the Apollo 17 geology stops are generic tasks which leave plenty of room for real-time decisions by the crew and the Backroom.
142:42:58|ALSJ||There is a burst of static as Gene does his turn.
142:43:31|ALSJ||"045" refers to the northeast heading at which Gene has parked the Rover.
142:43:37|ALSJ||Gene has misread the motor temps and corrects himself at 144:29:16.
142:44:16|ALSJ||For some reason, Gene is mis-stating the bearing to the LM as 'zero-point-one'. It is really 071. His net speed for the whole trip out from the SEP transmitter has been 6.4 kph - 7.9 kilometers of map distance in 73 minutes. Measured along their meandering, 9.1-kilometer path, their average speed has been 7.5 kph including several stops.
142:45:21|ALSJ||The @alsjurl/a17/a17experiment_sep_en.jpg"@alsjt>SEP</a> receiver/recorder on the back of the Rover has been overheating.
142:45:48|ALSJ||TV on.
142:46:11|ALSJ||Gene is working at the front and right side of the Rover, occasionally coming into view.
142:46:15|ALSJ||Jack's initial thought is that Bob is asking about the camera handle, and then realizes that he is asking about a frame count.
142:47:14|ALSJ||This Data Storage Electronics Assembly is a removable unit which will be brought back to Earth. As it turns out, good data has been obtained during the drive out from the LM and more will be collected on the return to the LM from Station 4.
142:47:23|ALSJ||Jack is at the gate. Re-attaching the scoop to the extension handle is a relatively simple matter of pushing the spring-loaded collar toward the scoop and rotating the collar to engage the latching pins.
142:47:23|ALSJ|CDR|The only time we did any traverse training pressurized was at the Cape. The rest of our geology traverse training was done in street clothes. But we needed to get in the suit and actually work with core tubes and the other equipment, actually get down into the nuts-and-bolts of it and handle the drill, handle the core tubes, assemble the Rover, and work with the things that were going to give you difficulty in the pressurized suit. Some things, like working the locking mechanism on the extension handle weren't very difficult; but things like aligning core tube threads were much harder to do than they were in shirtsleeves. That kind of training was very, very valuable. So, in the later stages, we'd do pressurized training down at the Cape maybe once or twice a week for the last couple or three months. It wasn't something I'd particularly look forward to, because it was hard, hard work.
142:47:23|ALSJ||The scoop and rake are each attached to an extension handle seated in a bracket on the gate. Even though the locking mechanism had released, as long as the back of the Rover didn't bounce too much, the tools wouldn't have jumped off the mating post on the end of each handle.
142:47:23|ALSJ|LMP|The failure of the lock was probably caused by the dust which, I'm sure, had worked it's way into the sockets by this time. By the third EVA, a lot of the sockets just weren't working: you either couldn't get them loose or couldn't get them connected because of the dust. Dust is going to be the environmental problem for future missions, both inside and outside habitats. And, unfortunately, although there's a lot of lip service paid to it, I don't detect a great deal of imaginative thinking about how you deal with the dust.
142:47:53|ALSJ||@alsjurl/Fendell-Bio.pdf"@alsjt>Fendell</a> pans the TV to look at the replacement fender; the TV lens is dirt spattered.
142:48:00|ALSJ||Fendell pans to Gene who is dusting the left-side batteries. Jack is at the gate, re-attaching the scoop to the extension handle.
142:48:34|ALSJ||Jack, a bit frustrated about all of the housekeeping chores, goes to Gene's seat and sticks the scoop in the ground while he gets a film magazine. Gene has moved out of the field-of-view.
142:48:40|ALSJ|CDR|As I recall, when we went down into the trough it was like going down a hillside. It wasn't a deep trough, but it was enough to give you a close, local horizon that hid the rest of the valley.
142:49:37|ALSJ||Jack finishes loading the film magazine in his camera. Although we don't see him remove the old magazine on this film change, he has probably put it on Gene's seat. When he picks up the new magazine, he removes the @alsjurl/alsj-DarkSlide.html"@alsjt>dark slide</a> and puts that on the seat, and then inserts the new magazine before putting the dark slide into the old magazine and stowing it under Gene's seat. Readers may want to note that the replacement fender will fail mechanically during the drive from Station 9 back to the LM at the end of EVA-3.
142:49:47|ALSJ||Jack gets a @alsjurl/alsj-lensbrush.html"@alsjt>lens brush</a> from beneath Gene's seat. Note that he uses the scoop as a support as he leans in inward to reach the brush.
142:49:57|ALSJ||Jack drops the lens brush and retrieves it. We get a brief glimpse of the brush handle.
142:50:07|ALSJ||Jack reaches across the seats. It's a very small brush.
142:50:10|ALSJ||Gene is asking Jack to see if his 70-mm camera lens is clean.
142:50:13|ALSJ||Jack leans across the seat so that Gene can clean his camera lens.
142:50:46|ALSJ||Before taking Magazine 135/G off his camera, Jack advances the film and gets four frames, AS17-135- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20676"@alsjt>20676</a>, to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20679"@alsjt>20679</a>, showing the LRV seats and floor.

142:50:46|ALSJ|LMP|You couldn't work ten hours like we did on the Moon, but we would work for like four hours. And we wore ourselves out before somebody had the bright idea - and I hope it was me, but I don't remember - of hooking the liquid-cooled garment up to some ice water. I'm surprised we didn't kill somebody from heat stroke. It was just too much. We shouldn't have been doing it. We didn't have any significant cooling for a long time - just an inadequate liquid-air cooling system in the lightweight PLSSs - and, then, during training for some mission, probably 15, we decided to have somebody walk behind the pressurized astronaut with a backpack full of ice water, and a hose going into the suit attached to the liquid cooled garment. And, of course, that made all the difference in the world. I think that was my suggestion, but I can't be sure; so much of that stuff happened synergistically. But I was worried and I know I made a big point to a lot of people for a long time that you were going to hurt somebody, that they were just getting too hot, including me.
142:50:46|ALSJ||Jack relates a variant of this story in his EVA-1 commentary at @alsjurl/a17/a17.alsepoff.html#1183952"@alsjt>118:39:52</a>. The first half of this EVA-2 review was actually done some months before the EVA-1 review.
142:50:46|ALSJ|CDR|I don't think we had the ice-water cooling for the Apollo 14 EVA training; for me, that showed up on Apollo 17. Although Apollo 14 was a January launch and ours was a December launch, we trained all year long. It got hot down there at the Cape, and you worked hard. I never felt we were going to kill anybody; but the ice water did help. It made a big difference. It allowed you to work more efficiently and kept you from getting as hot and tired and irritable, and you got more out of training than you would have otherwise.
142:50:46|ALSJ||Gene swings the TV around so that he can dust the lens.
142:50:46|ALSJ||This is a reference to the time before self-service gasoline/petrol station became common in the 1970s. When you pulled into a full-service station, an attendant came out and, after finding out how much gas you wanted - either a dollar amount of 'fill her up', would usually ask if you wanted the level of the car's motor oil checked. See a Wikipedia article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filling_station"@alsjt>Filling Stations</a>.
142:50:56|ALSJ||Gene raises his visor; he has a light growth of beard and a relaxed expression.
142:51:08|ALSJ||Gene finishes and moves away; Fendell starts a clockwise TV pan.
142:51:13|ALSJ||The light mantle is the result of a massive landslide that was triggered about 100 million years ago by the impact of ejecta from the Tycho impact.

142:52:11|ALSJ||Fendell finds Gene at his seat; Jack is in the distance, behind the Rover to the southwest with the lower slopes of the South Massif in the background. Gene gets the gnomon from its sheath behind his seat and goes to the gate.
142:52:49|ALSJ||Fendell pans away counter-clockwise.
142:52:53|ALSJ|LMP|When I was estimating the percentage of fragments, (the 10 to 15 percent figure) was related only to fragments large enough that they seemed to jump out of the matrix, that were clearly of a larger size than the matrix components. My guess is that the minimum was of the order of a few millimeters in size and that the estimate was really biased toward the larger fragments of centimeter size and more.
142:53:43|ALSJ|LMP|When the small impacting particles that form the zap pits hit, if there's crystalline rock - particularly plagioclase - at the impact point, then the halos look white. And in this case I'm saying that, because the halos don't look white, the rocks are not coarsely crystalline on the scale of the zap pit.
142:54:18|ALSJ||Fendell finishes his counter-clockwise pan at the Nansen/South Massif contact and reverses direction.
142:54:52|ALSJ|LMP|Boulder 1 was very weakly indurated but had a lot of layers in it; it was pretty easy to sample because it wasn't as tough a breccia as some of the others were. Boulder 2 was up on the slope and was about head high. We got a series of four or five samples, I think, and, as we'll hear described, we got a soil sample from a permanently shadowed place underneath an overhang. Boulder 3 was the one in which we found the crystalline dunite, which turned out to be very old. After the mission, there was a scientific consortium, called the Consortium Indomitable, headed by John Wood of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory at Harvard, which published a suite of papers about Boulder 1.

142:55:00|ALSJ|LMP|The gnomon gave you the local vertical, a 40 centimeter scale, a shadow which gave you azimuth, and also had a gray scale and three international color references for photometric calibration. In principle, the shadow, if visible in both pictures of a stereopair, could be used to control azimuth for topographic analysis. The vertical scale of known length provided other control parameters. I am not sure anybody ever did such an analysis, given the way resources dried up after the Apollo program. I don't think anybody's ever used those photographs or the data contained in them for analysis. But we gathered it.
142:55:00|ALSJ|LMP|The gnomon is the residuum of an original concept @alsjurl/shoemaker.pdf"@alsjt>Gene Shoemaker</a> had for gathering data with a stereo camera mounted on something called a Geologic Staff; the camera would have been taking pictures continuously, with the orientation of each frame recorded automatically. (A mock-up can be seen in Apollo 14 training photo @alsjurl/a14/ap14-s70-46157.jpg"@alsjt>S70-46157</a>.) In fact, it started out as a video camera. Unfortunately, NASA never saw fit to fund that. They finally, belatedly, funded development of a stereo camera, but they were forced to do it through a small business contract. And, instead of it going to a company like Kodak which had already built a stereo camera for use on the Moon - namely the Gold Camera (which is another story) for Apollo 11 - this one wound up going to a small company that couldn't handle it. They spent a lot of money and never produced a camera. It was just too much for them. Kodak did the Gold Camera, which I think in some ways was a more difficult job, in six months.
142:55:00|ALSJ|LMP|The Gold Camera took close-up stereo pictures of the lunar soil and that was NASA's homage to @alsjurl/ThomasGold1968.jpg"@alsjt>Tommy Gold</a> and his gadfly irritation of the system. (Flown only on Apollo 11,12, and 14.) He cost us an awful lot of time and money; although I have to admit those were nice little pictures. I don't know if anybody's ever used them for anything; they are close-up documentation of the pristine lunar soil or, at least, as pristine as you can get close to the LM. But you see, Tommy was the one who, fairly late in the game, kept coming back and saying that the astronauts were going to sink out of sight in a thick layer of lunar dust. And even after Surveyor landed, this kept coming up because, from his radio telescope investigations he was seeing the upper few microns of the surface and he was seeing this "faerie castle" structure. It really is there - in the very top surface - but there was absolutely no scientific, geologic, or logical reason to think that, on centimeter scales and larger, the surface wasn't well tamped by the meteors. And when Surveyor landed, it didn't sink down at all; and that should have been conclusive.
142:55:00|ALSJ||@alsjurl/HaroldUrey.jpg"@alsjt>Harold Urey</a> was another guy who was way outside his field and said many things that seemed to many people to be off-the-wall; but Harold's intellect was such that, in the final analysis, his suggestions were not the kind you could ignore. And in a lot of cases he was right on things that geologists were wrong on, mainly because geologists got too immersed in the details. Harold was able to look at the Moon in a cosmological sense and at least some of his conclusions - not all, but at least some - were quite good. He even wanted to go. In the late sixties, at a meeting in La Jolla, he volunteered to me that he would take a one-way trip. He said 'NASA is doing it all wrong. They ought to just let me go one-way, and then you wouldn't have to pay all the money to get me back.'
142:55:00|ALSJ||Readers interested in a further discussion of Urey's and Gold's lunar participation should consult Don E. Wilhelms' excellent 1993 book "To a Rocky Moon".
142:55:18|ALSJ|LMP|While Gene was doing this description, I was probably looking closely at the boulder, very engrossed. And, while it's true that Gene is repeating essentially what I had said earlier, it shows both how engrossed he'd been in his housekeeping tasks and how good a feel he had for observation. He picked up all of the same things that I'd picked up earlier and, as he always did when he put his mind to it, did an excellent job.
142:55:18|ALSJ|LMP|It was brought to my attention on, I think, an Apollo 12 training trip to Hawaii, that stratigraphy was something of interest to the other astronauts. I think Dale Jackson was leading the exercise. And after we'd done our exercise and were all gathered around, Dale asked each of the other astronauts to give their impression of what had happened geologically, of what they had seen. And then, after they had each had a chance to do that, he asked me to summarize it and I fell back on a technique I always used in order to organize my thoughts, and that was to talk in terms of oldest unit to youngest. I just put them in sequence and talked about how the relationships between units developed as I went through in my mind oldest to youngest. And Dick Gordon - although it could have been Al Bean - asked me how I kept my thoughts organized. And that emphasized in my mind how easy it was for them to understand the concept of superposition; it's the most fundamental concept in geology, the first ever documented by natural scientists, namely by Steno (alternatively Nicolais Steno and Niels Stensen), a Dane who lived in the 1600's. Anyway, it was something that I kept putting into the training program to make sure they all realized how easy it was to organize your thoughts in terms of what's on top of what. Gene picked it up and did it well. He could have done a lot more than he actually did. Some of his more rambling descriptions - for instance, when he did his hurried horizon description from the LM - are a little bit harder to follow but, in this particular case, you can see that Gene has his thoughts pretty well organized.
142:56:37|ALSJ||Fendell pans past the back of the Rover. Gene and Jack are hidden by the gate.
142:56:41|ALSJ|LMP|This was what we called a target of opportunity. We had been looking for situations where you could get a sample from underneath a boulder overhang where it has been protected for some time from the solar wind; and, if I remember correctly, that was to give us a better handle on when the boulder rolled into that position and began to shelter the soil underneath it. The solar wind age on the fillets on the boulder should be distinct from the age of the soil underneath the overhang. I don't know who thought that up, but I tell you, the synergism in the planning for these things was so great that there's just no way that any one individual can ever take credit for anything.
142:57:19|ALSJ||Fendell looks at the rear of the Rover. Nobody is in sight.
142:57:42|ALSJ||Fendell pans counter-clockwise.
142:57:44|ALSJ|LMP|I'm sure that the sample bag system evolved with time but, by the time we flew 15, we had a standard Teflon bag with the little metal strip in it; and they were all pre-numbered. We didn't try to take them out in sequence. They were on dispensers in sequence but, as I recall, we didn't worry about getting dispenser 1, dispenser 2, dispenser 3. You didn't have to; once you had the number of a sample, they could find it. In thinking more about it, Neil (Armstrong) went out and just tried to get as many different kinds of rocks as he could and put them in a bag; I bet you we didn't have individual bags on 11. On Apollo 12, though, I suspect that we did (true), because we knew they were going to move around more.
142:57:44|ALSJ|LMP|The metal strip was sealed into the upper hem of the bag in such a way that, when you took a bag off the holder it would spring open a little bit. But I think we had to squeeze in on the ends so that it would open even more. Then, when you had the sample in the bag, you folded the metal strip to provide a mechanical seal.
142:58:18|ALSJ||Gene is asking if Jack has finished putting the samples in his SCB.
142:58:34|ALSJ|LMP|A north/south overhang won't provide continuous sun shading and what we really wanted was an east/west overhang.
142:58:47|ALSJ||Jack is pleased that Gene knocked the sample off so easily.
142:59:06|ALSJ||Jack has picked up the rock fragment with his scoop and is waiting for Gene to get a sample bag open.
142:59:20|ALSJ||This is sample @alsjurl/a17/ap17-S73-16007.jpg"@alsjt>72255</a>, a 2.5x9x10.5 cm, 461 gm light grey breccia. The original location on Boulder 1 is indicated in @alsjurl/a17/a17smpcat1f2.jpg"@alsjt>Figure 2</a> from the Apollo 17 Sample Catalog, Part 1 ( @alsjurl/a17/A17SampleCat_1.pdf"@alsjt>29 Mb PDF</a> ).
142:59:20|ALSJ||Fendell reaches the limit of his counter-clockwise pan and reverses direction. Here, Jack is saying that, once a rock gets covered with dust, it is impossible to say much about it.
142:59:33|ALSJ|LMP|What we never worked out with Bob was that, when he heard something, he had to tell us that he heard it. And that invariably interrupted the next thought. It should have been only when they didn't understand that they would interrupt us, but we never got Bob to do that. And the total amount of time lost was significant.
142:59:33|ALSJ||Jack's comment should, however, be tempered by the observation that there were times when either he or Gene, realizing that they hadn't heard from Bob in a while or hadn't gotten confirmation of a transmission, would ask if they were being read. Bob would often try to judge when Jack had finish a thought before making an acknowledgment. Given the 2.5 second round-trip communications delay, that was sometimes difficult. In listening to the other missions, CapComs like Bruce McCandless (11), Ed Gibson (14), and Joe Allen (15) tended to interrupt less often than Bob did; however, on the other side of the coin, none of the other crews had as much to say. Obviously, this was occasionally a point of tension between Bob and Schmitt and was partly a product of their personalities.
142:59:33|ALSJ|CDR|It was never a problem. It was an open conversation between the three of us, plus Bob had fourteen people over his shoulder telling him what to do. He had to listen to them, listen to us, and get instructions up to us in between our comments to him. Frankly, I don't think any time was lost. Everything that was said needed to be said. And, let me tell you, when you're flying in an airplane or working on the Moon and it gets quiet on the airways for five minutes, I'll say 'Hey, Whisky Bravo, are you still with me?' If I don't hear other airplanes or the center or anybody else - which doesn't happen all that often except sometimes late at night - I'll do that. From my point of view, the occasional interruptions were a small price to pay for knowing that we'd been heard.
142:59:45|ALSJ||Fendell has been looking for Gene and Jack, and people in Houston are wondering where they've gone.
143:01:41|ALSJ||Gene is reminding Jack to keep his shadow out of critical parts of the photograph, which is probably Gene's "after", AS17-137-<a name="20902" href="images17.html#20902"@alsjt>20902</a>
143:01:48|ALSJ||Jack is southwest of the Rover but not yet above the break in slope and can now be seen through a gap in the top of the gate.
143:01:55|ALSJ||Gene's @alsjurl/a17/a17fltln20903-09.jpg"@alsjt>color flightline stereo and vertical pan</a> is made up of AS17-137-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20903"@alsjt>20903</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20909"@alsjt>20909</a>. They make up a portrait of the sunlit face of boulder 1. Jack is taking a @alsjurl/a17/a17fltln21030-5.jpg"@alsjt>black&amp;white flightline stereo</a> comprised of AS17-138-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21030"@alsjt>21030</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21035"@alsjt>21035</a>.
143:01:55|ALSJ|LMP|A flightline stereo was a series of stereo photographs rather than just a pair. For a pair, you would just take one step left or right between the frames but here, you took a series of steps in a line, taking a picture after each step. It was a series of stereopairs which could be convergent stereo if the camera was always pointed at the same point, or parallel stereo if you didn't turn the camera. For analytical purposes, convergent stereo was better, but we didn't worry too much about that and usually took the pictures roughly parallel.
143:02:14|ALSJ||Jack puts the sample in Gene's SCB.
143:02:21|ALSJ|LMP|We would take a "locator" back to something like the Rover, just so that there was something in the picture that could be used to work back to where the sample had been taken. We'd just turn around and take a picture of the Rover or of the horizon. Originally it had to do with the LM being in the picture as a "locator" because, from the geometry of the Lunar Module and knowing how it had landed, you could work back along a ray to where you were and, as well, get a distance based on the size of the Lunar Module. I'm sure that in this case the locator was back to the Rover.
143:02:21|ALSJ||Actually, Jack has forgotten to take a "locator" at Boulder 1, but will take one at Boulder 2.
143:02:39|ALSJ||That is, the boulder is split into two major fragments, with the dividing plane oriented SE/NW.
143:03:13|ALSJ||Fendell gets a good view of the rake.
143:03:16|ALSJ|LMP|In order for me to pour the soil in the bag, I wanted to get him downhill.
143:04:00|ALSJ|LMP|We were looking for an east-west overhang, preferably on the north side of the rock, where the sunlight and the solar wind might not have reached.
143:04:00|ALSJ||The best examples of boulders casting permanent shadows were found at Station 6 on this flight and Shadow Rock at Station 13 on Apollo 16. As it turned out, the solar wind saturates newly exposed soil in a matter of only decades and then retains the solar wind gases during the gardening process. Very little difference was found in the relative abundances of solar wind constituents between surface samples and samples from the bottom of the deep cores or permanent shadows.
143:04:25|ALSJ|LMP|A skim sample was the thinnest section of the surface of the regolith that I could get, intended to be a sample of the most modern solar wind effects. And then, you try to get stuff from underneath that.
143:04:54|ALSJ||They are visible through the gap in the gate again.
143:05:39|ALSJ||Something has come loose, possibly Gene's pack of sample bags. Fendell pans away to look at some nearby boulders and small craters at maximum zoom.
143:06:32|ALSJ|LMP|I think one reason you hear the word 'Okay' so much is that we were using it as a trigger for the VOX, the voice-activated communications circuit, so that you don't cut out your first real word. I don't think it's something we talked about; it just developed.
143:06:32|ALSJ||A quick check of the transcripts from the other Apollo missions indicates that all of the astronauts frequently used "Okay" and most often at that start of utterances.
143:06:37|ALSJ||These are AS17-138- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21036"@alsjt>21036</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21037"@alsjt>21037</a>.
143:06:56|ALSJ||Gene is about to climb the slope to Boulder 2.
143:06:58|ALSJ||Fendell returns to them.
143:07:17|ALSJ||Jack starts for the Rover; Gene, visible in the gap, starts climbing the slope to the southeast.
143:07:28|ALSJ||Jack reaches the Rover.
143:07:56|ALSJ||Jack mounts the scoop on the gate, takes the rake.
143:08:09|ALSJ||Gene has placed the gnomon near Boulder 2 but then goes downhill to take a couple of pictures of Earth, which he could see above the rock as he approached it. He leans backward to take the shots. These are AS17-137- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20910"@alsjt>20910</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20911"@alsjt>20911</a>.
143:08:30|ALSJ||Jack leaves the Rover but forgets the scoop and comes back to get it. Gene moves the gnomon.
143:09:36|ALSJ|LMP|I made a suggestion right at the beginning about where to do the rake sample; and they were coming back as if they never heard that. It seemed at the time that Bob wasn't screening requests from the Backroom and that he should have said, 'Hey, he's already told you that.' That's why I was getting annoyed.
143:09:36|ALSJ|CDR|There were just so many things going on in that Backroom and in the Control Center; Jack's been back there and he knows it. There were a lot of things that Bob had to filter out and there was a lot of time pressure. Coordination was the key and I think it worked pretty well. It was our job to let them know what we could do and couldn't do. And, while there were times when they may have wanted something we couldn't get for them, I don't ever remember anyone pushing once we advised against what they were asking us to do or we said it couldn't be done. I mean, it was our flight; they were there to help us and the mission simulations we did with the Backroom involved were an important ingredient in our training.
143:09:39|ALSJ||Jack switches to a two-footed hop as he gets on the steeper slope below the boulder. After a few hops straight uphill, he starts moving cross slope.
143:09:56|ALSJ||Jack plants the scoop in the ground. Gene is taking a series of cross-Sun pictures showing the entire south face of the boulder. These are AS17-137-20912 to 20923. David Harland has assembled frames @alsjurl/a17/a17.1431008_dmh.jpg"@alsjt>912 to 914</a>.
143:10:13|ALSJ||Jack leans on the boulder for a close examination. Gene double waves to reach his @alsjurl/alsj-ValveCluster.html"@alsjt>cooling control</a>.
143:10:55|ALSJ||A porphyry is a rock with two distinct crystal sizes.
143:10:55|ALSJ|LMP|We had learned from the rocks brought back on the earlier missions that the zaps were a very good indicator of what was underneath because, not only did they shatter the crystalline fragments, but they knocked off the patina. There was a light, brownish patina on all of these rocks that we had found out was a very thin, partial covering of brownish glass, probably due to the splattering from these zap pits. The more recent zaps knocked the patina off around the little pit and you could see better.
143:10:55|ALSJ|LMP|I spent a good deal of time between missions studying the rocks. I did the first real hand-specimen study of the Apollo 11 basaltic rocks and then I worked with other samples off and on, mostly just to get familiar with the rocks. I had quite a few sessions, just going through the rocks, taking notes, and fixing in my mind what other people had seen. And then I got some of the other crews over to the Receiving Lab to look at rocks.
143:11:13|ALSJ||Fendell pans away counter-clockwise.
143:11:27|ALSJ||Jack's down-Sun "before" is AS17-138- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21038"@alsjt>21038</a> and his "locator" to the Rover is @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21039"@alsjt>21039</a> (scan by Kipp Teague). In the "locator", notice the disturbed soil around Boulder 1. Note also, Jack's footprints farther to the right. This was his path back from the Rover with the rake. Wessex Cleft is in the far distance above the Rover.
143:11:57|ALSJ|LMP|This is a good example of using the appearance of terrestrial examples to help in a description. 'Andesite' implies a specific composition but, when you're in the field you're not so much saying that you think it's that composition as you're saying what it resembles based on your experience. I think that, somewhere else, we've talked about the trouble some members of the scientific community gave Buzz Aldrin when he said something looked like mica. There's absolutely nothing wrong in field geology of saying what something looks like; you'll find out what it really is later.
143:11:57|ALSJ|LMP|One of the reasons that these things looked like porphyries is that they were crushed. They were crystalline rocks - rocks that had crystallized out of a magma body - that had been crushed by impacts, and the largest uncrushed fragments stood out against the pulverized matrix. So you get a coarse crystal in a fine-grained matrix and that's why I used the word 'porphyry'.
143:12:09|ALSJ|LMP|I've just noticed that, at the start of this speech, my words were slurred, almost as if I were very dry or had too many drinks. I may have just been getting tired, because I'd just climbed the slope.
143:13:29|ALSJ||Houston is discussing a ten-minute station extension. Fendell is looking into Nansen.
143:15:33|ALSJ||Fendell is still looking into Nansen at high magnification.
143:16:01|ALSJ||Fendell pans clockwise.
143:16:38|ALSJ||Fendell examines the North Massif.
143:17:53|ALSJ||Fendell is looking at the sky.
143:18:19|ALSJ||Soil kicked under the overhang will contaminate any shadowed samples. One of the aims of collecting these samples is to look at the influence of solar wind exposure on the relative abundances of various elements and, of course, an admixture of unshadowed soil would, of course, muddle the analysis.
143:18:19|ALSJ|CDR|In the suit, shuffling around, you're not the most agile person in the world and, if you're not careful, you'll kick dust onto a pristine surface that you want to sample. When you're working, you're not necessarily watching how you're walking. You're not necessarily clumsy, but it's like waddling around in some big, old, fat galoshes and you just naturally disturb a lot of the surface in the area where you're working.
143:18:51|ALSJ||Gene has just taken AS17-137- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20924"@alsjt>20924</a>.
143:18:53|ALSJ||Fendell reaches the rear of the Rover. Jack has taken AS17-138- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21040"@alsjt>21040</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21041"@alsjt>21041</a>, and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21042"@alsjt>21042</a>.
143:19:31|ALSJ||Fendell is looking at Earth over the Massif.
143:19:58|ALSJ||Post-flight analysis of this 106-gram soil sample (@alsjurl/a17/Lunar Sample Compendium72320.pdf"@alsjt>72320</a>) indicates that it wasn't completely shielded from the Sun and is comparable to fully exposed soil collected nearby.
143:20:14|ALSJ|LMP|Ed had been in charge of the Communications Console for as long as I could remember.
143:20:14|ALSJ|CDR|The Earth looked big; and, like the Moon looks down here, it probably wasn't as big as it looked. Yet, because the Earth's beauty was so predominant, there was also a feeling that it was the most precious possession a man could stow in his memory. There was the beauty of the colors of the oceans and the clouds: multiple shades of blue, from the azure of the Caribbean to the deep dark blues of the Pacific; the shades of white of the clouds and the snow; and the black of space around it. There you were, standing on the surface of the Moon in full sunlight, looking at the Earth, a quarter million miles away, surrounded by the blackest black. Not darkness, but the blackest black a human being can conceive in his mind. I think the perception that the Earth looks bigger than it really is probably comes from the majesty of its colors and from the fact that you are there on the Moon, looking back at it. It's an overpowering figure of life in the sky.
143:20:14|ALSJ|CDR|Even on the TV, it is a spectacular view. It's a half Earth and you can see clouds and the blues of the oceans. With your naked eye, you could make out continents. You can imagine working on the slope of the Massif on top of the Scarp and, every once in a while you have to look over your shoulder to look at what's looking at you and think about where you are and what you're doing. Sometimes, it still hardly seems like it was real. It sometimes almost seems like we were too nonchalant, worrying about fractures and rocks and rake samples and all that when the Earth was over our shoulders.
143:20:14|ALSJ||At maximum zoom, three Earths would fit across the vertical width of the TV screen and about five horizontally. From the lunar surface, Earth's angular diameter is 1.9 degrees and, before Fendell went to maximum zoom, it appeared as though Earth was about ten diameters or 20 degrees above the apparent summit.
143:20:51|ALSJ||Fendell returns to Jack, who is positioning the gnomon at the rake site.
143:21:09|ALSJ||Jack plants the scoop.
143:21:33|ALSJ||As indicated on CDR-11 ( @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_cdr11.gif"@alsjt>26k</a> ), Station 2 was scheduled to be a 50 minute stop. They been here for about 38 minutes so far. They had planned to arrive at Station 2 at 2:02 and leave at at 2:52 minutes. They arrived at 2:08 and, with the extension, they should leave at 3:08. They will actually leave at about 3:12.
143:21:35|ALSJ||Jack is taking down-Sun photos of the rake site. The rake head is sitting on the ground with the handle sticking up at about a forty-five degree angle. The rake head is quite heavy, about 1.50 kilograms compared with 0.82 kilos for the extension handle. The "before" pictures of the rake site are AS17-138-21043 to 21046.
143:22:07|ALSJ||Gene's pan photos are AS17-137- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20926"@alsjt>20926</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20956"@alsjt>20956</a>. He is standing about 10 meters upslope from Boulder 2. Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20942"@alsjt>20942</a> is a good shot into Nansen.
143:22:38|ALSJ||A nominal down-Sun picture of a rake sample would be taken at f/11, at a distance of eleven feet, and at 1/250th of a second exposure.
143:22:42|ALSJ||Jack gets the sample by dragging the rake uphill. He stands facing the mountain, slightly uphill of the gnomon, and begins each stroke with the rake at his side and then pulls it forward. It looks like a very awkward motion. At the end of the stroke, he hops forward and drags the rake a little farther.
143:22:42|ALSJ|LMP|Any tool that you have to drag along the ground is going to be difficult to use and, by this time, anything you had to do with your hands wasn't easy.
143:23:19|ALSJ||After finishing the pan, Gene turns and takes three photos of the Earth over the South Massif. These are AS17-137- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20957"@alsjt>20957</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20958"@alsjt>20958</a>, and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20959"@alsjt>20959</a>. He then takes two more pictures of Earth over Boulder 2. These are AS17-137- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20960"@alsjt>20960</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20961"@alsjt>20961</a>.
143:23:45|ALSJ||A major consideration in traverse planning was the possibility of a Rover failure that would force the crew to walk back to the LM. For return under an hour, it was assumed that the crew could achieve an average speed of 3.6 km/hr and average metabolic rate of 1560 BTU/hr. For longer returns, the assumed averages were 2.7 km/hr and 1290 BTU/hr. The assumed metabolic rates included a 20 percent safety margin and were used determine how quickly the remaining supplies of oxygen and cooling feedwater would last.
143:23:45|ALSJ||A figure from a 22 August 1972, pre-flight planning document by P.E. Reynolds of Bell Labs ( @alsjurl/a17/A17Walkback.gif"@alsjt>50k</a> ) shows the planned elapsed times and distances to the LM at various phases of EVA-2. The oxygen and feedwater limits are represented by the diagonal lines on the righthand side. Note, also, the distance limit of 7.6 km imposed as a contingency against failure of one of the PLSSs. In that case, it is assumed that the two astronauts would use the BSLSS to share feedwater and that the astronaut with the failed PLSS would operated his OPS in low-flow mode. The assumed return speed is 7.3 km/hr and allowances are made for about 15 minutes to return to the Rover and get the BSLSS hooked up and, once back at the LM, another 13 minutes for emergency ingress.
143:23:45|ALSJ||I have added the actual Apollo 17 data, shown by dashed lines. Note that the return distances from the various stops are greater than used in planning because Gene landed east of his target point to avoid Geophone Rock.
143:24:22|ALSJ|LMP|By this time in Apollo, the walkback constraints had been well established. My main effort was to make sure they weren't too constraining. Left to their own devices, some of the planners would have been much more conservative than was necessary.
143:24:39|ALSJ|LMP|The people examining samples had concluded that there was a significantly larger variety in the walnut-size range than there were in the major rocks that were scattered around. Apparently, rocks thrown into a site from distant places were concentrated in the walnut-size range.
143:24:39|ALSJ||After finishing each rake swath, Jack has been moving sidehill to stand on the just-raked ground and begin the next swath. He had started the series with a long swath at 143:22:42, took nine more short ones requiring only a step or two each. Now, he finishes the series with an extra long swath taking by running uphill, dragging the rake behind him. Fendell is at maximum zoom. In his suit, Jack stands roughly six feet tall and he fills about half of the TV's six-degree-high frame. This suggests that he is about 120 feet from the Rover. The distance given in the Preliminary Science Report is 45 meters or 150 feet. Gene goes to Jack and gets a sample bag off of his own holder, ready to receive the rocks Jack has collected with the rake.
143:24:57|ALSJ||Jack gets another short swath.
143:25:07|ALSJ||Throughout the EVAs, the astronauts show a tendency to speak more loudly to Houston than to each other, despite the fact that, in both cases, there is a radio link through the LCRU.
143:25:12|ALSJ||Jack is wondering if he is now supposed to use the rake to get a bag full - roughly a kilogram - of soil.
143:25:17|ALSJ||Jack pours the rocks in the bag that Gene's holding. The checklist does not explicitly call out a kilogram of soil at this site.
143:25:24|ALSJ||Jack gets his scoop.
143:25:53|ALSJ||Jack angles the scoop head.
143:26:03|ALSJ||Gene gets another sample bag.
143:26:15|ALSJ||Jack gets a scoopful of soil but drops some as he lifts the scoop. Gene's "we changed 2 hours and 40 minutes" is a reference to a delay in launch from Earth. Not wanting to alter the timing of events at the Moon, NASA decided to have them fly a quicker-than-planned trajectory to the Moon so that they reached lunar orbit at the planned time. In addition, NASA put all of the mission clocks ahead by 2:40 so that, while we are currently at 143 hours, 26 minutes on the mission clock, it has only been 140 hours, 46 minutes since launch from Earth.
143:26:27|ALSJ||Jack gets a second scoopful.
143:26:43|ALSJ||They have been putting most of the samples in Jack's SCB and Gene is offering to take some of the load.
143:26:47|ALSJ||Jack presents his SCB to Gene, who is twisting the sample bag shut.
143:26:47|ALSJ|CDR|We tried to distribute loads but, compared with the weight of the backpack, the weight of the SCB never bothered me. In one-sixth gravity you just couldn't put that much into one of the SCBs and I just never felt like I was carrying any extra weight.
143:26:47|ALSJ||At the end of the EVA - and after some redistribution of samples - they report SCB weights of 24 and 35 terrestrial pounds. At the end of EVA-3, they report two other bags at 32 pounds each. In lunar gravity, then, a full SCB would weigh 5 or 6 pounds and, while the extra weight was noticeable hanging from the side of the PLSS, it was not troublesome.
143:27:15|ALSJ||Fendell pans away.
143:27:29|ALSJ||Fendell returns to them.
143:27:39|ALSJ||Jack starts downhill; Gene takes the "after", which is AS17-137-20962.
143:27:46|ALSJ||Jack stops at two rocks slightly uphill from Boulder 3.
143:27:55|ALSJ||Here, Jack is using 'anorthositic gabbro' to describe light-colored, crystalline material such as that found in Boulder 2. The 'two-cycle' breccia is the blue-gray material of Boulder 1. Gene comes downhill using the two-footed kangaroo hop.
143:28:18|ALSJ|CDR|When you were going uphill, you had to take little steps and get your toes dug in. Because you didn't have as much weight holding you down as you would have on Earth and because you're center-of-mass was so high because of the backpack, it was harder to keep your balance. But coming downhill, the only trouble was - like being on a ski-slope - if you came straight downhill using that kangaroo hop, you'd get going really fast. And, if you stubbed your toe, you'd go tail over tea kettle.
143:28:31|ALSJ||Gene positions the gnomon.
143:28:31|ALSJ||Jack plants the scoop and takes a down-Sun "before" of Boulder 3. This is AS17-138- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21047"@alsjt>21047</a>.
143:28:39|ALSJ||Jack is saying that he think that Gene can chip the rock with the hammer. Gene backs away to take a cross-Sun stereopair, AS17-137-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20963"@alsjt>20963-64</a>, while Jack takes the down-Sun. Throughout the sampling of this boulder they demonstrate just how good a sampling team they have become. They don't talk a great deal about what they are going to do; they both know what needs to be done and more or less who is going to do what.
143:28:39|ALSJ|LMP|The purpose of the training, in my mind, was to make everything that could be routine be as routine as possible so that you didn't have to think about it and didn't have to talk about it.
143:28:40|ALSJ||Jack turns to the east to take a "locator" of the Rover (AS17-138-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21048"@alsjt>21048</a>) then turns back to the rock and takes another before (AS17-138-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21049"@alsjt>21049</a>).
143:28:51|ALSJ||Gene gets the hammer from his shin pocket. Jack gets the scoop.
143:29:10|ALSJ||Hammering sounds - a soft "plock" - can be heard through Gene's suit. He takes seven whacks at the top of the boulder on the east end.
143:29:10|ALSJ|CDR|Although we can hear on the tape that the microphone in my suit was picking up the sound of my hammering, I don't ever remember hearing it. I could certainly feel it; and I've always contended that it's a very fine line between hearing noise and feeling noise. With that hammer, when you hit something the shock went through your whole body; but I'm not sure I ever heard the noise, probably because my ears were covered with the Snoopy helmet.
143:29:10|ALSJ||What seems likely is that, when Gene hits the rock, the hammer rebounds against the palm of the pressurized glove, creating a sound wave in the suit loud enough to be picked up by the microphone at Gene's lips. In brief, the suit acts like a drum.
143:29:10|ALSJ|CDR|The boulder was just sitting on the soil and, as I remember, when I hit it with the hammer, it moved. That's how I knew we would be able to roll it if we wanted to.
143:29:10|ALSJ||Gene takes three whacks on the east face.
143:29:10|ALSJ|CDR|This is a good example of the posture you have to assume to go after a boulder that's not much more than knee high. You have to bend down in your suit to get whatever sort of leverage you can with the hammer and then swing it from the side. Normally, we'd hit it straight on in a vertical plane but, because you don't have much mobility in the suit, I was bending my right knee, bringing the hammer up across my chest (to the left), and then swinging it down to my right. So I was actually back-handing it to get at the face. You just adapted to whatever the suit would give you. And, here, when I bent down, leaning a little into the hill, the suit was actually so stiff it helped me maintain that folded-knee position without dropping all the way to my knees. This is a good example of what it took to operate in the suit and on a slope.
143:29:35|ALSJ||Gene hits the east face twice more.
143:29:41|ALSJ||Jack gets one of the fragments, flexing a knee so that he can get low and skim it off of the surface with the scoop blade.
143:29:55|ALSJ||Gene takes two whacks on an east corner.
143:30:01|ALSJ||Jack gets the sample.
143:30:10|ALSJ|LMP|A rhyolite is a volcanic rock, usually having large crystals in a fine-grained matrix, low in iron-magnesium silicates, high in quartz and feldspar. This inclusion wasn't a rhyolite, but had a similar texture.
143:30:10|ALSJ||Gene hits the corner eight times.
143:30:16|ALSJ||Gene lays the hammer on the rock and gets a sample bag from his camera bracket.
143:30:22|ALSJ||Gene takes the scoop from Jack, grabbing it near the head, and pours the fragments in the sample bag.
143:30:37|ALSJ||Gene puts the bag in Jack's SCB.
143:30:37|ALSJ||Sample 72415,0 is a brecciated dunite clast weighing a little over 32 grams. It is described in @alsjurl/a17/A17SampleCat_1.pdf"@alsjt>Volume 1 of the Catalog of Apollo 17 Rocks</a>, as being pale, yellowish-to-greenish gray (colors 5Y 8/1 to 5GY 8/1 in the Geological Society of America (GSA) Rock-Color Chart)</a>. The sample location is shown in a @alsjurl/a17/a17smpcat1f1b.jpg"@alsjt>labeled version of AS17-138-21049</a> from the Apollo 17 Sample Catalog, Part 1 ( @alsjurl/a17/A17SampleCat_1.pdf"@alsjt>29 Mb PDF</a> ). Post-mission photos @alsjurl/a17/ap17-S73-16198.jpg"@alsjt>S73-16198</a> and @alsjurl/a17/ap17-S73-16199.jpg"@alsjt>S73-16199</a> give two different views of the sample.
143:30:37|ALSJ|LMP|One of these fragments turned out to be the oldest dated rock ever sampled on the Moon. It was dated at 4.6 billion years, plus or minus 0.1 billion years, in a mineral isochron analysis. They really had to work at it because there wasn't a lot there; it was mostly olivine and to do a mineral isochron you've got to do separates of a number of minerals. I don't know what they found in there, ilmenite or something. And then you have to extract the lead isotopes and do an analysis on them. The revolution in mass-spectrometry techniques as a result of Apollo was just phenomenal. It was literally getting down to the point where they were counting atoms as they were coming off the samples. And that, in turn, has led to this dilemma we have in environmental consideration here on Earth in that we can now measure very small quantities of 'supposedly toxic' substances which we never knew were there before. And I say 'supposedly' because some things don't become toxic until they reach certain levels of concentration. And, at very low levels, things like copper and selenium are even necessary for good health.
143:30:48|ALSJ||Gene gets the hammer and knocks a piece off on the third stroke. The piece comes off to Gene's left and he tries to grab it. He manages to touch it and, in so doing, knocks it into Jack's left wrist. The fragment bounces off of Jack's wrist and slowly falls to the ground behind him.
143:31:09|ALSJ||Gene puts the hammer in his shin pocket.
143:31:14|ALSJ||Jack collects the fragment, about ten feet southeast and slightly uphill.
143:31:20|ALSJ||Perhaps four feet east and two feet uphill.
143:31:24|ALSJ||Gene examines the ground northeast of the rock, the direction he thinks it will roll.
143:31:25|ALSJ||Gene gets a bag.
143:31:38|ALSJ||Jack pours the samples in the bag. The samples are 72430-35. The largest of these is 72435, a 161 g, clast-bearing, impact melt. It is described as being gray (N4 in the Geological Society of America (GSA) Rock-Color Chart)</a> in @alsjurl/a17/A17SampleCat_1.pdf"@alsjt>Volume 1 of the Catalog of Apollo 17 Rocks</a>. Public Affairs reports that crew heart rates are in the 90s.
143:31:53|ALSJ||Gene puts the sample bag in Jack's SCB.
143:31:53|ALSJ||Gene is standing just north of the rock; Jack moves east just far enough to get his shadow off the rock. Gene's "after" is AS17-137- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20965"@alsjt>20965</a>.
143:32:05|ALSJ||Jack turns around and moves a few steps east and a little downhill to a small crater full of rocky debris. Gene's close-ups are AS17-137-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20965"@alsjt>20965</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20973"@alsjt>20973</a>. He has used his tongs to make sure he is at the right distance from the rock for a good focus. The best of these pictures is probably @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20971"@alsjt>20971</a>.
143:32:33|ALSJ||Jack moves two short hops downhill for another stereo picture. In all, he takes three pictures of the crater: AS17-138-21050 to 21052.
143:33:11|ALSJ||Gene is now SW and a little uphill of Boulder 3.
143:33:18|ALSJ||Jack hands Gene the rake and leans on the boulder.
143:33:36|ALSJ||Jack gets up with some difficulty, using the rock and the scoop for support.
143:33:47|ALSJ||Standing uphill of the rock, Gene pushes it with his right foot. Jack moves quickly out of the way to the east. The boulder rocks forward slightly then falls back. Gene gives it a harder kick and the boulder turns over twice as it rolls.
143:33:53|ALSJ|LMP|There was a lot of boulder-rolling discussion on the @alsjurl/ap-geotrips.html"@alsjt>field trips</a>. Mostly, Gene just rolled this one for fun but, by doing so, he exposed the soil underneath and we got a sample of it.
143:33:53|ALSJ||On Apollo 12, Conrad rolled a rock into Head Crater in order to generate a signal for the ALSEP seismometer. And, on Apollos 15 and 16, the crews turned boulders over so that they could sample the soil underneath.
143:33:54|ALSJ||As it reaches him, Jack kicks the rock toward the north but it is stopped by a small rise. He tries another kick, but with little effect.
143:34:12|ALSJ||Gene is standing a little uphill, so Jack has to raise his arm quite high to pour the sample into the bag. Jack skims a second sample while Gene closes the first bag.
143:34:39|ALSJ||Gene has the second bag open, just as Jack raises the skim sample.
143:34:47|ALSJ||Jack does a little jump to get the skim sample out of the scoop and into the bag.
143:34:51|ALSJ||Jack presents his SCB.
143:35:11|ALSJ||Gene has the samples in Jack's SCB and turns to get the gnomon.
143:35:22|ALSJ|LMP|As it turned out, it was olivine in olivine; almost a pure olivine rock. So it's interesting that I made that guess up there. Olivine has a vitreous luster and a light greenish color but, again, in this case it was chunks of olivine in a crushed matrix of olivine that had been through the mill for four-and-a-half billion years.
143:35:22|ALSJ||Gene is using the kangaroo hop to get downhill; Jack is using alternating steps and doesn't seem to be moving as quickly. To get started, Gene used a few alternating steps to get up to speed.
143:35:22|ALSJ|LMP|The cross-country skiing motion, I think, takes less energy than the kangaroo hop because I was just sort of moving my ankles, not flexing the suit as much. I always seemed to wear out faster when I tried hopping versus the semi-stride.
143:35:59|ALSJ||Jack reaches the Rover. He has been carrying the scoop in his left hand with the handle forward and the head back and pointing at the ground. He tosses it like a baton, getting it to rotate so that, after he catches it, he can mount it on the gate with the head pointing up.
143:35:59|ALSJ|LMP|You got to where you were doing things like that all the time. Things moved very slowly and the best flexibility you had in any part of the suit was in the wrist; so you took advantage of it.
143:36:22|ALSJ||Jack stows the scoop; Gene stows the gnomon and then goes to turn the TV.
143:36:38|ALSJ||Gene points the TV into Nansen.
143:36:54|ALSJ||Gene takes the gnomon to Jack.
143:37:12|ALSJ||Jack is taking a @alsjurl/a17/a17pan1433716.jpg"@alsjt>black-and-white pan</a> from the second rake site northeast of the Rover. Jack's pan consists of frames AS17-138- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21053"@alsjt>21053</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21073"@alsjt>21073</a>.
143:37:12|ALSJ||David Harland has assembled the portion showing - from left to right - @alsjurl/a17/a17.1433716_dmh.jpg"@alsjt>Gene, the Rover, and Nansen</a>.
143:37:12|ALSJ||Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21069"@alsjt>21069</a> is a great picture of Gene.
143:37:25|ALSJ||Fendell pans counter-clockwise.
143:37:28|ALSJ||The cross-Sun "befores" of the rake site are AS17-137- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20974"@alsjt>20974</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20975"@alsjt>20975</a>. They show Jack taking his pan. Frames @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20976"@alsjt>20976</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20977"@alsjt>20977</a> are "locators" to the Rover.
143:37:30|ALSJ||Fendell pans clockwise.
143:38:21|ALSJ||Fendell finds Gene and Jack well north of the Rover.
143:38:47|ALSJ||Jack is taking swaths by running forward three or four steps, dragging the rake behind him. Each of the swaths, then is about two meters long.
143:38:55|ALSJ||Jack has made at least five rake swaths by this time.
143:39:35|ALSJ||Jack raises the rake to pour the fragments in the sample bag Gene is holding. He has taken at least seven swaths.
143:39:35|ALSJ|LMP|We were out on the light mantle, which we thought was an avalanche. If it is an avalanche, you wouldn't expect many rock fragments; they would have worked their way downward in a gas-lubricated avalanche (flow) and all that would be at the surface would be fines. If the surface were old enough, you would find a few fragments, all of them thrown in from elsewhere.
143:39:41|ALSJ||One of the rocks is a 51-gram 'impact melt breccia' - @alsjurl/a17/LunarSampleCompendium72735.pdf"@alsjt>sample 72735</a> - that is at least 3.85 billion years old.
143:40:04|ALSJ||Jack's down-Sun "after" of the second rake site is AS17-138-21074.
143:40:42|ALSJ||This 885-gram soil sample is @alsjurl/a17/LunarSampleCompendium72701.pdf"@alsjt>72701</a>. Its composition is similar to other sample taken in the 'light mantle' areas visited during this traverse.
143:40:42|ALSJ||Gene opens Jack's SCB after getting the sample bag sealed.
143:41:04|ALSJ|LMP|I suspect that I didn't want to drive a long distance on the Rover with a full SCB; if the top came open we could have lost samples.
143:41:06|ALSJ||Jack starts toward the Rover using a high-speed, long-stride lope which he has earlier described as a cross-country skiing stride.
143:41:10|ALSJ||Having taken AS17-137- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20978"@alsjt>20978</a> Gene starts back to the Rover, carrying the gnomon.
143:41:23|ALSJ||Gene is going at a rapid pace. Fendell follows him for a while, then does a final site pan.
143:41:23|ALSJ|LMP|Gene started out doing the kangaroo hop for a little ways and then went into a left-foot-forward skip. He wasn't getting very high off the ground because you can see his toe kicking dirt almost every step. Anybody wanting to estimate how fast two relatively tired people could go should look at this sequence. This one sequence could give you a lot of information about walkback. I'm glad we didn't have to do that.
143:41:31|ALSJ|CDR|It was a good station; we got a lot done. We'd joked around with the Falcon code - which I'd learned in the Navy - during training but, you notice, it was Bob who brought it up. There were about twenty Falcon phrases, and Falcon 109 was 'Beautiful; just fucking beautiful.'
143:41:53|ALSJ|LMP|The way I responded to Gene makes me think that I had noticed the buried layer of lighter material and had filed it away in the back of my brain while we were working. And it's a good thing he brought it up, because otherwise we wouldn't have noticed it at this point.
143:41:55|ALSJ|LMP| I think Gene is comparing the depth of his footprints in the light mantle with those he made in the talus slope where we sampled the boulders. From the fact that we got (rock) fragments on the talus slope but not in the light mantle tells me that we had a finer material on the light mantle and I expect we were sinking in farther down there. This section is confusing, there's a lot of (verbal) shorthand.
143:42:04|ALSJ||Fendell looks into Nansen again.
143:42:38|ALSJ|LMP|I was wondering if we got a big gravity change as we got up onto the Massif. We did, but I don't know if anybody ever told me about it.
143:42:38|ALSJ||There is no further discussion of the Station 2 gravimeter reading anywhere in the transcript.
143:42:48|ALSJ||That is, Gene is putting SCB-4 on Jack's PLSS. Note that Jack had been wearing SCB-8.
143:43:18|ALSJ|LMP|They were realizing that the SEP was running awfully hot and, probably because we were going to retrace our tracks, they thought that they might save it for the final traverse by leaving it off and covered.
143:43:38|ALSJ||The SEP has cooled down from 105 F during the stop.
143:43:41|ALSJ||They have just mounted SCB-8 on the gate.
143:44:02|ALSJ||Fendell finds them at the gate. The locks referred to here are clamps to hold SCBs on the gate.
143:44:56|ALSJ||Jack carries SCB-8 to his seat.
143:45:08|ALSJ||Jack is saying that they wouldn't have lost the time if they hadn't been told to remove the bag from the gate and put it under the seat. Of course, a little lost time would be minor compared with lost samples.
143:45:31|ALSJ||Fendell has the TV pointed down and aft, the proper position for the traverse.
143:45:37|ALSJ||TV off.
143:46:34|ALSJ||Heavy breathing as they mount the Rover. At some point after Jack gets seated, Gene takes a picture of the rear of the Rover, AS17-137- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20979"@alsjt>20979</a>. The blue object at the back of the Rover above the replacement fender is the Traverse Gravimeter.
143:47:22|ALSJ||The hammer is in the pocket on Gene's right shin and is probably catching on the bottom of the console.
143:47:30|ALSJ||They are now about 3 hours 12 minutes into the EVA. As indicated on CDR-15 ( @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_cdr15.gif"@alsjt>29k</a>), they had planned to leave at 2:52. Half of the twnety minute difference is due to the 10 minute extension that Houston offered and Gene accepted. The plan is to shorten Station 4 by those 10 minutes. A figure from an EVA-2 planning document by P.E. Reynolds of Bell Labs ( @alsjurl/a17/A17Walkback.gif"@alsjt>50k</a> ) shows the planned Return Distances and EVA Elapsed Times at various stages in the EVA. I have added the data for the actual EVA as dashed lines. The PLSS O2 and H2O walkback limits are shown as diagonal lines on the righthand side and, as they leave Station 2, they have about a half hour buffer. Note that the actual return distances from the various stations are great than those assumed in planning because Gene landed east of his target point to avoid Geophone Rock.
143:47:43|ALSJ|CDR|- (Laughing) "This is a typical exchange between Jack and Bob. Sometimes it almost got to be a test of wills.
143:47:43|ALSJ|LMP|We were there to learn. I wanted to be sure that I didn't get distracted and forget some pertinent observation. The Backroom wanted as much information as we could give them and during this time when we were driving away from the station was a good time to do the equivalent of making some field notes.
143:47:50|ALSJ||Jack sounds a little tired.
143:48:55|ALSJ|LMP|I think that this is the pilot laughing at the scientist's admission of imprecision.
143:50:00|ALSJ||The planned Rover sample stop is not shown on the checklist map on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_lmp14.gif"@alsjt>LMP/CDR-14</a> but, rather, on the list of traverse tasks on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_cdr1415.jpg"@alsjt>LMP/CDR-15</a>.

143:50:03|ALSJ||They are about 300 meters from Station 2.
143:50:03|ALSJ||Jack will take a series of pictures as Gene turns the Rover in a circle. These pictures are AS17-138- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21077"@alsjt>21077</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21092"@alsjt>21092</a>. Because of the glare of the Sun, the up-Sun frames - @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21079"@alsjt>21079</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21080"@alsjt>21080</a> - don't show much detail.
143:50:47|ALSJ||The whirring sound of film advancing in Jack's camera can be heard.
143:51:03|ALSJ||The pan turned out to be relatively uninteresting because of the Sun glare. Pictures taken during the next minute or two are AS17-138- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21093"@alsjt>21093</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21094"@alsjt>21094</a>, and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21095"@alsjt>21095</a>.
143:51:13|ALSJ||The light color of the small, fresh craters is probably related to the light layer of soil that Gene noted (at 143:41:45) a short distance below the surface. In just a few minutes, they will find more of it at the Scarp Gravimeter stop. The 'patination' process to which Jack refers comes in two varieties: (1) small impacts on boulders create a patina of brownish glass and (2) small impacts in the soil create small blobs of glass which tend to darken a soil as it ages.
143:53:25|ALSJ||Because they will take the gravimeter reading without putting the instrument on the ground, Gene is trying to level the Rover by using a crater rim to prop up one or more of the wheels.
143:53:57|ALSJ||Note, that it is very difficult to decide who has said what during the last few lines, a fact which also makes it difficult to decide what has been happening. The person speaking at 143:53:54 sounds like Gene, but this section doesn't make sense unless the speaker is actually Jack or, alternatively, unless Jack didn't get off the Rover at 143:53:28.
143:54:06|ALSJ||This is evidently not standard procedure and, at least in this instance, improvising costs precious time.
143:54:22|ALSJ||Jack is suggesting that vibrations produced by Gene's fans and pumps might disturb the @alsjurl/a17/a17-TGE.html"@alsjt>TGE</a>.
143:54:36|ALSJ||This location is plotted as Station 2a in <a hef="a17profpap-f6.jpg"@alsjt>Figure 6</a> and @alsjurl/a17/a17profpap-f7b.jpg"@alsjt>Figure 7B</a> in the USGS Apollo 17 Professional Paper.
143:55:06|ALSJ||They may be standing at the gate, waiting for the Rover to quiet.
143:55:12|ALSJ||There had been some discussion of taping the SEP covers at @alsjurl/a17/a17.outcam.html#1404754"@alsjt>140:47:54</a>, but no decision was made. Unless Jack did some taping without comment - which seems unlikely, the covers won't be taped until the start of EVA-3 at @alsjurl/a17/a17.trvsta6.html#1640057"@alsjt>164:00:57</a>. Consequently, the identity of "this thing" remains a mystery.

143:59:30|ALSJ||The rock isn't yellowish-brown after all. The spots of color are produced by sunlight reflected off the gold-colored foil on the LCRU blankets.

143:59:30|ALSJ|LMP|It really did look yellow or orangish and it's interesting that later on I hesitate on calling the orange soil 'orange' at Shorty, because I had already been fooled.
144:00:10|ALSJ||Jack wants to put the sample in the SCB on the Accessory Staff.
144:00:12|ALSJ||Gene forgot to re-aim the low-gain antenna when he parked the Rover at this stop. However, the signal quality wasn't noticeably different from normal and didn't change just now when he re-aimed the antenna, probably because Houston had switched to reception through the LM, rather than the Rover low-gain antenna, as indicated below.

144:01:06|ALSJ||Gene may be getting some Dixie cups to put in the sampler.
144:02:15|ALSJ||Apparently, Gene has fallen while trying to get on the Rover and, as he will comment in a moment, has uncovered some light-colored soil in the process.
144:02:24|ALSJ||Gene is probably holding on to the Rover as he pulls himself to his feet.
144:02:58|ALSJ||That is, it was a serendipitous stumble.
144:03:23|ALSJ||This is the sample stop at 080/5.5 listed on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_cdr1415.jpg"@alsjt>LMP/CDR-15</a>.
144:03:41|ALSJ||That is, Gene was getting on the Rover when he fell.
144:03:56|ALSJ||Jack is referring to the SCB hanging from the accessory staff.
144:03:59|ALSJ||This is a 346-gram soil sample, @alsjurl/a17/LunarSampleCompendium73121.pdf"@alsjt>73141</a>.
144:04:26|ALSJ|LMP|All over the Moon, the gardening process reaches a fraction of a centimeter deeper every million years, and the depth to the light material is fairly consistent with an avalanche age of about 100 million years that was determined from solar-wind exposure measurements.
144:04:26|ALSJ||Simulations of the gardening process described in the <a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/books/lunar_sourcebook/"@alsjt>Lunar Sourcebook</a> (1991, p.89) suggest that the rate at which the gardened layer thickens slows with time. The decreasing rate is due to the rarity of larger impactors. In a typical simulation, the depth to which soil is turned over once might be 0.6 cm after a million years, 1.5 cm after ten million years, and 4 cm after a hundred million years. However, at any given place, the history of the regolith will be very complex and variations on vertical scales of a few tens of centimeters can be expected over periods of a few tens of millions of years.
144:04:51|ALSJ||There is a cut-out in the seat through which Jack can reach his PLSS controls.
144:05:07|ALSJ|LMP|If he turned right, it tended to force me to take pictures through the TV antenna; whereas, if he turned left, I got a better field-of-view

144:07:53|ALSJ||The checklist gives a Station 3 position of 087/5.6 and they will actually stop at 087/6.0.

144:10:12|ALSJ||Gene has turned north and they can now look along the scalloped, multi-lobed edge of the Scarp toward Hanover and the North Massif. Jack's next @alsjurl/a17/a17.1441012_pan.jpg"@alsjt>five photos</a>, AS17-138- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21114"@alsjt>21114</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21118"@alsjt>21118</a> show all of these features with considerable clarity. Gene's photo AS17-137- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20980"@alsjt>20980</a> was also taken at about this time.
144:10:20|ALSJ|CDR|Ever since I've been back from the Moon, I've attributed the difficulty we had in judging size and distance to the lack of references like telephone poles, roads, trees, and so forth. I'd forgotten that I said this about the lack of color contributing to the problem, and I'm sure it's true. It's interesting that I made the observation at this point in the traverse. Here we were, high up on top of the Scarp in very hummocky, rolling terrain, looking out across the valley and across to the North Massif. You've got a bland-looking landscape, and I'm sure that what I was seeing were foreground features that just blended into the background. I'm sure that the overall gray color and the lack of major color changes contributed to the inability to develop accurate depth perception.
144:10:25|ALSJ|LMP|We don't know for sure, but the Scarp is probably an actual fault scarp and, out to about halfway across the valley, toward the South Massif, the landslide material is draped over it. And what I'm commenting on here is that on the southern end of the Scarp where we are now, the Scarp seems to be a series of scarps or steps whereas up to the north it seems to be one continuous line.

144:13:26|ALSJ||The LCRU hangs off the front of the Rover and, if the nose were to pitch down into a particularly steep-walled crater, there would be a chance of having the LCRU hit the surface.
144:13:33|ALSJ||NASA Public Affairs reports that both Gene and Jack have heart rates in the 80s.
144:13:33|ALSJ|CDR|Listening to the tapes, I'm really starting to re-live the ride. This ride up to Station 2 and back is much clearer in my memory than the ride to and from Station 1 was, because this was really spectacular terrain and driving the Rover and riding on it was really a challenge and was really fun. It was not your ordinary trip to the Moon. This was a unique place, probably the most unique and challenging for the use of the Rover because of the heights to which we climbed and the terrain which we were in. The lobes of the Scarp weren't vertical cliffs; they were lobes, as Jack describes, or rounded plateaus and they made it a challenging ride. You can hear it in our voices and see it in some of the pictures. It's a shame that the TV pictures and the still pictures don't really give a full appreciation of how steep some of those rolling hills were in this part of the valley. All you'd need would be a fishing pond and a few trees and it would be a great place to build a house.
144:15:23|ALSJ||On Apollo 15, Dave Scott did an unintended 180 degree spin-out as he and Jim Irwin drove down off the Apennine Front.
144:15:23|ALSJ|CDR|One-sixth gravity just did not hold the Rover to the ground very well. You always bounced around a lot and, if you had any speed, that just aggravated the bounce. Where 'the rubber meets the road' (an advertising slogan of the Firestone Tire Company in the 70's) was not a very tight fit and, if you were going downhill and you had to turn left or right, the tendency of the Rover to spin or roll was pretty great.
144:15:52|ALSJ||AS17-138- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21131"@alsjt>21131</a>, the first of @alsjurl/a17/a17.1441552_pan.jpg"@alsjt>five pictures</a> taken at about this point.
144:16:17|ALSJ||Gene wants to go to 087/6.1 and is currently at 079/5.7. He is driving on a heading which is a bit more than 90 degrees from the LM bearing and, therefore, is increasing both his range and bearing.
144:16:17|ALSJ|CDR|This is the way I think when I'm flying an airplane: to increase both bearing and range, I need to be more than ninety degrees to the left of the LM bearing. And if I wanted to stay at the same range and increase my bearing, then I'd 'fly an arc' and keep my heading at 90 degrees to the LM bearing.
144:16:31|ALSJ|LMP|The SPAN room was where the troubleshooting started when there was a problem. It was an engineering room, and I used to spend a lot of time in the SPAN room with other missions when I was helping out with various engineering problems. One time I was in there with George Abbey - and I can't remember now quite why it happened - but, up above their consoles, the people in the SPAN room had a pegboard where they stuck all their messages, and it wasn't structurally very sound. Somehow I hit the board, which knocked over the coffee cups they had in front of it, and the coffee spilled onto the consoles.
144:16:42|ALSJ|LMP|Dick Thorson was the guy who was on duty in the SPAN room the day I spilled the coffee
144:16:46|ALSJ||See an account of the @alsjurl/a17/a17SPANspill.html"@alsjt>Famous SPAN Coffee Spill</a> from the Apollo 17 Fifteenth Anniversary Reunion.
144:17:11|ALSJ||Two frames taken at the end of the EVA-3 traverse indicate the nature of Gene's problem. AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20476"@alsjt>20476</a> is a tourist picture of Gene taken from in front of the Rover and shows the TV antenna mounted forward of his seat. Jack was standing fairly close to the vehicle and the antenna isn't as tall as it appears in this image. AS17-143- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21924"@alsjt>21924</a>, taken from behind the Rover gives a better indication of the antenna's potential for blocking Gene's view. In this frame, the antenna is pointed to the side and doesn't block Gene's view very much. However, on this drive to Station 3, the antenna is apparently pointed fore or aft and Gene has to look through the full antenna. As can be seen in AS17-143- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21932"@alsjt>21932</a>, which is one of Gene's picture of the Rover parked at the VIP site, we can see that the antenna is relatively transparent when there is no sunlight reflecting off the wire mesh into the line-of-sight. During this drive to Station 3, the combination of the Rover heading and antenna pointing is such that there is enough sunlight reflecting off the antenna into Gene's eyes to make the antenna appear opaque. The effect is illustrated in AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20453"@alsjt>20453</a>, a picture taken from the front of the Rover.
144:17:11|ALSJ||A V.I.P. is a Very Important Person and at the Cape, the V.I.P. site is a set of viewing stands as close to a launch as anyone is allowed. Admission to this viewing area is by invitation only. At the end of the third EVA on each of the J missions, the Rover was parked about 100 meters east of the LM so that the world could get TV coverage of the LM launch.

144:19:54|ALSJ||Jack had done his Ph.D. dissertation work in Norway for a year and a half. Several of the names he gave to features in the valley have Norwegian origins.
144:21:36|ALSJ|CDR|I may have been exaggerating a little about 17-1/2 or 18 clicks, but I know we were going at least 14 or 15 clicks coming down there. We were really moving. (Smiling) But, then, what can I say? There it is, documented: 17-1/2 or 18 clicks.
144:21:54|ALSJ||Unless Gene has mis-spoken, he has turned enough that he can look south toward the mountain.
144:22:17|ALSJ||Gene is driving in a northwesterly direction and "on your right" could be north along the Scarp.
144:22:26|ALSJ||Parker is confused. 080 was the bearing at the cancelled LRV stop. Houston estimates that Station 3 will be at 089/6.1. Gene is currently at 087/5.9, a short distance southeast of where they want to be.
144:22:35|ALSJ||They are planning to stop near one or the other of two fresh, 15-to-20 meter craters in the area. One of them is in sight.
144:22:38|ALSJ|CDR|We were going north and, as we did, the bearings to the LM were going to get higher and higher. We would have had to have gone south to get to a bearing of 080.
144:23:38|ALSJ||For the next few moments, we have a period of overlapping conversation. Gene, with Jack's help, is orienting the Rover so that it is level and the sun-shadow device reads zero. They will ignore Parker until they are finished. Some of the Rover dialog is lost under Parker.
144:25:27|ALSJ||They are now about 3 hours 50 minutes into the EVA. As indicated on CDR-15 ( @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_cdr15.gif"@alsjt>29k</a>), they had planned to arrive at 3:19. A figure from an EVA-2 planning document by P.E. Reynolds of Bell Labs ( @alsjurl/a17/A17Walkback.gif"@alsjt>50k</a> ) shows the planned Return Distances and EVA Elapsed Times at various stages in the EVA. I have added the data for the actual EVA as dashed lines. The PLSS O2 and H2O walkback limits are shown as diagonal lines on the righthand side and, as they arrive at Station 3, they will have to leave again in no more than about 42 minutes because of walkback. As indicated in CDR-15 ( @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_cdr15.gif"@alsjt>29k</a>), they had planned to spend 45 minutes at Station 3. Note that the drive from Station 2 to Station 3 has taken longer than assumed by Reynolds, primarily because of the Scarp Gravimeter stop. Note, also, that the actual return distances from the various stations are greater than those assumed in planning because Gene landed east of his target point to avoid Geophone Rock.
144:26:27|ALSJ||The bearing to the LM is 087 (east), the range is 6.0 kilometers, and they've driven 12.6 kilometers. The latter figure includes about an 800 meter excess over the map distance due to the need to drive around craters. The map distance to Station 3 is the sum of the 0.3 kilometer eastward displacement of the SEP transmitter from it's planned location, 6.1 kilometers from the planned SEP site to Hole-in-the-Wall, 2.3 kilometers from there to Nansen, another 2.3 kilometers back to Hole in the Wall, and 0.8 kilometers from there to Station 3.
144:26:32|ALSJ||As shown in @alsjurl/lrvh_1_27.gif"@alsjt>Figure 1-27</a> the Sun Shadow Device (SSD) is normally folded down again the face of the console. To take a reading, Gene raised the arm and read the position of the gnomon shadow on the scale. A reading of zero indicates that he is parked on a heading directly away from the Sun. The pitch and roll indicators are part of a single instrument mounted on the left side of the control console, as can be seen in @alsjurl/lrvh_1_22.gif"@alsjt>Figure 1-22</a> from the @alsjurl/lrvhand.html"@alsjt>LRV Handbook</a>. Normally, the pitch indicator faces Gene and, in order to read roll, he has to rotate the instrument 90 degrees. See @alsjurl/lrvh_1_26.gif"@alsjt>Figure 1-26</a> in the Handbook.
144:26:32|ALSJ|CDR|While it is possible that I was leaning over to the right and maybe down a little bit to read the pitch indicator without parallax, what 'get it over to read' sounds like is that the indicator had flopped up and was showing me roll when I wanted to read pitch first.
144:27:28|ALSJ||Figure 7a ( @alsjurl/a17/a17profpap-f7a.jpg"@alsjt>930k</a> ) from the Apollo 17 Professional Paper shows the location of Station 3 in relation to Lara and the Scarp.

144:30:17|ALSJ||TV on.
144:30:54|ALSJ|LMP|Gene needed someplace to lay the long-can cap. When we did it together, I'd hold the cap.
144:31:19|ALSJ||They are parked just east of the top of the Scarp. @alsjurl/Fendell-Bio.pdf"@alsjt>Fendell</a> pans counter-clockwise.
144:31:44|ALSJ||Fendell briefly catches Gene on his way to the gate. Jack's cross-Sun and down-Sun "before" pictures of the trench are AS17-138- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21143"@alsjt>21143</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21147"@alsjt>21147</a>.

144:32:38|ALSJ||Fendell finds Jack on the rim of a small, raised-rim crater northwest of the Rover.
144:32:43|ALSJ||Here, Bob is referring to the light-colored, subsurface material which, presumably, is similar to the material Gene discovered at Station 2 and at the Scarp gravimeter stop.
144:33:20|ALSJ||Fendell looks at Jack, scooping soil with his back to the Rover. The low-gain antenna is in the way.
144:33:29|ALSJ||Jack pours soil in a sample bag; he gets about a half cup.
144:33:36|ALSJ||Jack plants the scoop in the ground and closes the bag.
144:33:50|ALSJ||Jack goes to the Rover to get an SCB. There are sample bags hanging from his camera.
144:34:10|ALSJ||The gravimeter will remain on the Rover for this measurement. If Gene had started the measurement, Jack couldn't have gotten an SCB off the Rover without ruining the measurement.
144:34:46|ALSJ||Fendell is looking at a small crater north of the Rover.
144:35:45|ALSJ||The TV jiggles as Gene works around the Rover. Fendell returns to Jack at the rim of Ballet Crater, so named because of later events.
144:36:17|ALSJ||Gene is out of sight at the gate and, having removed the long-can cap and having taken the rake off of one of the extension handles, is fitting the extension handle on the drive tubes. Jack has a sample bag in his left hand and gets the scoop in his right. If he has gotten an SCB off of the Rover, it isn't currently visible.
144:36:17|ALSJ|LMP|As I recall, I spent a few tens of seconds trying to find a place to set it so that it would stand; and I think I ended up off to the side a bit with it.
144:37:19|ALSJ||Jack plants the scoop.
144:37:57|ALSJ||The drive tube sections are each 42 cm long.
144:38:01|ALSJ||Fendell leaves Jack.
144:38:13|ALSJ||Fendell backtracks and goes by Jack again as he refurbishes his trench and gets the next sample.
144:39:34|ALSJ|LMP|With two of us working together, bagging samples was fairly easy; but it was a lot harder solo. A lot harder. You had to hold the bag in one hand, and somehow or another get your scoop out over it so that you could dump something in it. And it was not easy, because you're moving your arms against the pressure in the suit while gripping both the bag and the scoop.
144:39:34|ALSJ||Jack sounds tired. Fendell finds Gene, southeast of the Rover, pounding the core with the flat of the hammer. It is going in at about 2 inches per stroke. Because he is working above waist height, the suit allows him to swing the hammer in a vertical plane.
144:39:38|ALSJ||Gene stops hammering; puts the hammer in his shin pocket and looks at his checklist.
144:39:41|ALSJ||Gene goes to the Rover.
144:40:21|ALSJ||Gene gets a 70-mm camera from Jack's seat.
144:40:41|ALSJ||Gene takes a stereopair of the drive tube from the south. These are AS17-137- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20981"@alsjt>20981</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20982"@alsjt>20982</a>.
144:40:45|ALSJ||Gene puts the camera on Jack's seat so that he can work more easily with the core and the long can.
144:40:55|ALSJ|LMP|There was no note. Gene and Bob were just teasing the scientists, threatening to contaminate the sealed sample. This was a real-time 'put on' that Bob came up with; and Gene just fell in with the spirit of it instantaneously. I'm pretty sure it wasn't planned, although it could have been based on something that had come up in training.
144:40:55|ALSJ|CDR|I don't remember this, but I don't think there was any note. It was just a little bantering back and forth between Bob and I to make people wonder. I'd like to know if that can's ever been opened, because I think they were going to keep it sealed for some indeterminate length of time.
144:40:55|ALSJ||In a recent conversation, Bob recalled that this sample was going to be preserved in pristine condition until significantly better analytic techniques became available. During training, they had joked about putting in a note. The long can would be a time capsule and the note would be a surprise greeting from the past. Of course, an actual note would have contaminated the sample and would have spoiled the joke.
144:40:55|ALSJ||Gene grunts as he pulls the core out of the ground.
144:41:47|ALSJ||Twelve of the fifteen rocks Jack collected at Station 3 turned out to be breccias, four of them blue-gray and very similar to the blue-gray boulders sampled at Stations 2, 6, and 7.
144:41:48|ALSJ||Gene examines the end of the core and then brings it to the TV camera.
144:42:04|ALSJ||Gene is assuring Houston that, even in this soft soil, little of the core has been lost during extraction.
144:42:08|ALSJ||Gene has the tip of the core in his left hand and the body of the core in his right; he is standing at the right side of the Rover, facing forward, the core tube at right-angles to the Rover chassis and the tip pointing toward the rear-facing TV camera. We only get an oblique view of the dirt filling it. He flips the core 180 degrees, the top of it going up past his left shoulder, and turns his body 90 degrees so that he is facing the Rover, the core is parallel to the Rover chassis. Now, the tip is in his right hand, pointing forward and straight into the TV. It is chock full of soil. Individual pebbles or small clods are clearly visible.
144:42:24|ALSJ||Gene leans over Jack's seat. During the Rover preps at @alsjurl/a17/a17.outcam.html#1410327"@alsjt>141:03:27</a> Gene put a core cap dispenser on SCB-7 which, at 141:05:46, he then put under Jack's seat. At 141:16:50, as per checklist, he put another dispenser on the bag Jack as wearing, SCB-8, which Jack wore until the end of Station 2 at @alsjurl/a17/a17.sta2.html#1434242"@alsjt>143:42:42</a>. Gene briefly hung SCB-8 on the tool gate but then, at Houston's suggestion, they put it under his seat. Jack is currently wearing SCB-4.
144:42:46|ALSJ||It is not clear what pocket Jack is referring to here. Possibly a pocket on an SCB on the gate.
144:42:52|ALSJ||Apparently, Gene transferred the SCB-8 dispenser to SCB-4, the one Jack is now wearing, when he changed Jack's bag at the end of Station 2.
144:42:53|ALSJ||Gene goes to Jack at the crater. Fendell starts panning.
144:43:22|ALSJ||A twenty-bag packet of sample bags is attached to the camera bracket and that attachment isn't working properly. The Apollo 16 crew had a similar problem and the attachment had been re-designed in between the missions. As Jack tells Bob at 144:58:51, he has bent the "mounting point". At the end of the EVA, Jack will take a bag holder into the cabin with the camera and, during the rest period, will fix the attachment hardware. His bag holder will work perfectly during EVA-3.
144:43:53|ALSJ||Fendell is examining layering on the East Massif.
144:43:59|ALSJ|CDR|This is something that my father used to say, and I'm glad I said it on the Moon. 'If it's worth doing at all, it's worth doing right.' And then he'd add: 'Or you're just going to have to do it over again.' His name was Andy. Andrew George Cernan. And he also used to say 'I'll only ever ask of you to do your best.' Whether it was in studying, or playing football or playing the clarinet - which I tried to do but never did very well. 'You may not be better than everyone else at everything,' he said, 'but if you do your best, sometime, your going to shine in something. And there's only one person in the world who knows what's your best: and that's you.' A good man.
144:44:44|ALSJ||Fendell pans past Jack, who is going to his Rover seat. Fendell then looks north along the Scarp toward Hanover.
144:45:47|ALSJ||A xenolith is a foreign rock; and Bob is suggesting that Jack collect as many different types of rocks as he can find.
144:46:02|ALSJ||Fendell finds Jack back at the near rim of the crater. An SCB is now on the ground beside him.
144:46:15|ALSJ||Jack goes to the north rim of the crater and gets a scoopful of soil.
144:46:20|ALSJ||That is, a small amount of dirt fell out of the core tube. Meanwhile, Jack's scoop has fallen to the ground. In order to free both hands for closing a sample bag, he leaned the scoop against his thigh, but it slipped off and fell.
144:47:00|ALSJ||Facing cross-slope, Jack bobs down onto his uphill (right) knee and grabs the scoop. He has no trouble getting back up. He then goes to the SCB to stow the sample.
144:47:00|ALSJ|LMP|Facing up a slope like that, it was easy to get down and back up.
144:47:26|ALSJ||Jack gets another sample bag off the hook on his camera bracket, but drops the whole packet.
144:47:37|ALSJ||Jack leans on the scoop and retrieves the packet of bags easily.
144:47:39|ALSJ||Bob is anxious to get the tube number recorded.
144:47:53|ALSJ||Jack is trying to re-attach them to the camera bracket.
144:48:16|ALSJ||Jack reaches for his cooling control, doing the double wave to reach back far enough.
144:48:40|ALSJ||With some difficulty, Jack hops up the soft, southern rim of the crater to look at a 12-inch by 6-inch rock.
144:49:22|ALSJ||Jack demonstrates the difficulty of solo sampling. He is collecting four small rock fragments. He must hold the scoop by the end of the handle so that he can reach the ground and get a fragment. The scoop head is angled at 90 degrees and, after collecting each of the fragments, he tosses the scoop up, catches it near the head, tilts the scoop so that the fragments tumble to the heel of the scoop, and then lowers the scoop to collect the next fragment. The final time, he pours the fragments into a sample bag with some difficulty. By the end of the third EVA, he will have learned how to do solo sampling fairly efficiently.
144:49:49|ALSJ||Jack picks up a rock with the scoop. He rests the scoop handle against his crotch, but it falls again.
144:50:43|ALSJ||Jack goes to the SCB.
144:50:52|ALSJ||Jack has knocked the SCB over, scattering full sample bags. He drops to his hands and knees, facing upslope, gets the SCB standing upright, retrieves the sample bags, and stows them in the SCB without getting up.
144:51:16|ALSJ||Jack leans back to get his PLSS over his heels and kicks upright. He makes it, but drops the SCB in the process. He goes to one knee to retrieve it but stumbles and falls on his chest. He gets up successfully and goes to the scoop.
144:51:46|ALSJ||From later evidence, Gene is having trouble re-attaching the rake to the extension handle. Meanwhile, Jack's unused sample bags have fallen off his camera again.
144:51:53|ALSJ||Jack drops the SCB on the ground.
144:52:01|ALSJ||Jack turns away from the TV camera while he examines his 70-mm camera to see how dirty it is.
144:52:46|ALSJ||Gene is attaching the rake to the extension handle; he had removed the rake head so that he could attach the extension handle to the drive tube. Jack is now facing south, still trying to clean his camera.
144:52:53|ALSJ|LMP|This request for an EMU check was actually a code phrase which meant 'In our opinion, you need to slow down a bit; and, if you want to give us an EMU check, we'll take it.'
144:53:04|ALSJ||Jack starts a pan from the rim of Ballet Crater. When facing uphill he has to bend his knees and get on his toes to properly point the camera. When facing downhill, he only has to bend his knees. Figure 6-108 ( @alsjurl/a17/a17psrf6-108.tif"@alsjt>47k</a> ) from the Apollo 17 Preliminary Science Report is a planimetric map of Station 3 and shows the pan location.
144:53:04|ALSJ|CDR|There wasn't anything very exotic about taking pans. In training, we'd use real film and get it developed to see how we did. Basically, you wanted to get the horizon and it was pretty obvious what you had to do to get what you were looking for. It was just common sense. The only real variation was when I was facing upslope, sometimes I would take a picture of the foreground, lean back and get the horizon, then come down, turn a little, and take a picture straight in front of me, and then lean back to get the horizon again. That would give not only a horizontally overlapping pan but a vertically overlapping one as well for the local area that had a big upslope to it. I did that on my own because I figured that film was the least of our worries. And there were other times when I might take the camera off and sighted along the top surface to make sure I was getting things like the flag. And, of course, you had to use a lens-barrel sight when you used the 500.
144:53:36|ALSJ||Gene needs to put the rammer on Jack's PLSS. He had used the rammer to push followers into the drive tubes to compact and constrain the soil.
144:54:04|ALSJ||That is, he thinks he can manage by himself.
144:54:08|ALSJ||They are now about 4 hours 20 minutes into the EVA and have been at Station 3 for 29 minutes. As indicated on CDR-19 ( @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_cdr19.gif"@alsjt>29k</a>), they had planned to leave at 4:04. A figure from an EVA-2 planning document by P.E. Reynolds of Bell Labs ( @alsjurl/a17/A17Walkback.gif"@alsjt>50k</a> ) shows the planned Return Distances and EVA Elapsed Times at various stages in the EVA. I have added the data for the actual EVA as dashed lines. The PLSS O2 and H2O walkback limits are shown as diagonal lines on the righthand side and, at the present moment, they are only about 10 minutes from the O2 walkback limit. Note that the actual return distances from the various stations are greater than those assumed in planning because Gene landed east of his target point to avoid Geophone Rock.
144:54:28|ALSJ||Jack finishes the pan.
144:54:44|ALSJ|LMP|I was acknowledging that I'd been mad at him.
144:54:44|ALSJ||Jack gets the scoop by stepping on the head, thereby raising the handle.
144:55:05|ALSJ||Jack manages to grab the upright SCB without trouble this time and then tries to get the unused sample bags. Gene arrives with the tongs.
144:55:22|ALSJ||With his tongs, Gene easily gets the sample bags. Jack goes to the Rover.
144:55:47|ALSJ||Gene goes to the Rover.
144:56:21|ALSJ||Jack's "afters" of the trench are AS17-138-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21178"@alsjt>21178</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21180"@alsjt>21180</a>. This has been a very frustrating station for Jack. He had done some training doing solo sampling, but this station, more than any other in all of Apollo, offers support for his contention that, "We should have always sampled in pairs. It was just a lot more efficient.
144:56:21|ALSJ|CDR|Working in pairs has its advantages and we certainly saw that at Station 2. But, here, I was getting a core sample and that was a one-man job. There's no sense in two people doing that, so what is the other man going to do but something like take a pan and do some solo sampling? It's always nice to have the other guy to help and point things out, but you can still get a great deal of sampling done by yourself. Sampling seems to go smoother as a two-man operation because of the constraints of the suit: one guy can hold the bag and the other guy can pour a sample in. But it's also something you can learn to do by yourself. And, even when there are two of you doing the sampling, you have to wonder if you're really getting your money's worth out of the second guy. So, I'm not hard over on it like Jack is. This station was set up to be two one-man operations, particularly the core sample. Jack got a little frustrated. He dropped things, and his bags kept coming off, and he fell down. And all that adds up to the frustration that he feels about this station. But if one-man sampling had gone smoothly - which it could have - then he probably would have had a different attitude. Maybe the design of the tool should have been a little bit different or maybe there should have been different techniques, but I don't think that there should be a hard-and-fast rule about two-man sampling.
144:56:21|ALSJ|LMP|I have no problem with the fact that we tried to do solo sampling; I'm just saying that it wasn't very efficient. So I'll modify my position to say 'whenever possible'. Although, who knows? Maybe if we had worked in sequence - done the core together and then done the sampling together - it would probably not have taken any more time and it certainly wouldn't have been as frustrating.
144:56:21|ALSJ||As mentioned above, by the end of the third EVA, Jack will be doing solo sampling fairly efficiently.
144:56:34|ALSJ|LMP|They eventually named this Ballet Crater.
144:56:34|ALSJ||Gene is referring to the bag locks on the gate. He is trying to secure the SCB that Jack was using at the crater rim. On-camera, Jack is going for the gnomon. In response to Bob's 'Ballet' comment, he does two, big, one-footed hops on his right leg, with his left leg extended up and back, flexed at the knee. He is on the outer slope of the crater, hopping toward the rim. After the @alsjurl/a17/a17.ballet1.jpg"@alsjt>second hop</a> (TV still by Ken Glover) , he loses his balance and falls on his hands and knees. Clearly, he is playing. Fendell pans away.
144:56:46|ALSJ|LMP|I don't remember this, but I'm sure I was playing. It wouldn't have been out of character, and it was a major effort to get the heel up high.
144:56:46|ALSJ|CDR|You have to develop confidence in the suit. You didn't want to roll down into a rocky crater and bust up the PLSS, and you didn't want to tear the suit on a rock. You were cautious and were aware of the possibility of busting something on the suit if you did something extreme. But the suit had to be designed so that, in ordinary operations, what you did was more constrained by the inherent mobility and flexibility of the suit rather than by safety. You wanted to be sure that safety considerations simply didn't arise. Jack would have been a lot more careful had he been walking through a boulder field but here, on this little crater rim, there weren't any rocks, and this little bit of playing wasn't particularly dangerous at all.
144:56:50|ALSJ||Fendell pans back to Jack, who has gotten up, apparently without difficulty.
144:57:09|ALSJ||Jack returns to the Rover.
144:57:20|ALSJ||Fendell pans north, looking at the near-field.
144:58:56|ALSJ||Fendell finds them at Jack's side of the Rover.
144:59:09|ALSJ|CDR|goes to his seat
144:59:13|ALSJ||Jack waves into the TV.
144:59:33|ALSJ||Jack goes to the gate.
144:59:51|ALSJ||This is Apollo magazine 133.
145:00:06|ALSJ||Jack advances the film two frames so that, when he removes the magazine, he won't lose any pictures.
145:00:28|ALSJ||They will reach the walkback limit in about 4 minutes.
145:00:28|ALSJ||Fendell finds them at Cernan's seat. Jack hands out the 500-mm camera.
145:00:57|ALSJ||Jack has a film magazine from under Gene's seat. He has taken the @alsjurl/alsj-DarkSlide.html"@alsjt>dark slide</a> out of the new magazine and has put the dark slide on his seat. He then removes the old magazine and puts that on the seat.
145:00:57|ALSJ||Jack has finished loading the new film magazine, having secured a latch across the top. He gets the @alsjurl/alsj-DarkSlide.html"@alsjt>dark slide</a> and inserts it into the used magazine. Although the dark slide has a wire handle large enough to accommodate the glove fingers, inserting the dark slide was still delicate finger work.
145:00:57|ALSJ|LMP|It still amazes me that we could manipulate that dark slide, particular with our hands so tired.
145:00:57|ALSJ||Gene's @alsjurl/a17/a17pan1450105A.jpg"@alsjt>four pictures of Hanover and the Scarp on the North Massif</a> are AS17-144- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22047"@alsjt>22047</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22050"@alsjt>22050</a>. The first of these is superb.

145:00:57|ALSJ||Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22056"@alsjt>22056</a> is the best display of outcropping.
145:02:43|ALSJ||Jack goes around the back of the Rover to his seat.
145:02:43|ALSJ||Gene's photographs of @alsjurl/a17/a17pan1450251.jpg"@alsjt>Wessex Cleft</a> and the Sculptured Hills peak to the east are AS17-144- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22072"@alsjt>22072</a>) to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22077"@alsjt>22077</a>.
145:03:17|ALSJ|LMP|I think that during training, somebody took a bunch of pictures with the lens cap on, and it was always a big joke afterwards. On the 500-mm, you don't look through the lens to sight it. So you could leave the lens cap on and not know it. It was built that way because, with your head inside the helmet and the camera outside, the camera was a long way from your eye and a viewfinder would have been useless.
145:03:17|ALSJ||At other stations when we get to see the 500-mm being used, a gunsight is visible on the lens barrel.
145:03:17|ALSJ|CDR|With the 500 mm, unlike the 70 mm, if you moved it just a little bit you didn't get what you wanted. So the bullseye helped us a lot.
145:03:17|ALSJ||Fendell watches Jack as he mounts the Rover. He grabs the SEP mast with his left hand, kicks his feet up and bounces down on to the seat.
145:03:32|ALSJ||TV off.
145:05:23|ALSJ||Gene is probably reporting that they are rolling.
145:06:28|ALSJ||The checklist calls for a drive of 0.6 kilometers on a heading of 069 from Station 3 to reach an LRV sample point at 089/5.1. After getting the sample, they will drive 1.5 kilometers on a heading of 052 to Shorty.
145:06:52|ALSJ||Jack's @alsjurl/a17/a17.1450605_trv.jpg"@alsjt>first three photos</a> of the traverse are AS17-133- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20194"@alsjt>20194</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20195"@alsjt>20195</a>, and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20196"@alsjt>20196</a>.
145:07:31|ALSJ||Jack is misreading his checklist. 052 is the heading of Station 4 from Station 3 given on page @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_cdr1819.jpg"@alsjt>LMP/CDR-18</a>.
145:07:50|ALSJ|CDR|I have a vague recollection about this. We were starting to come back northeasterly. We were still in the very early morning sun, even on the second day and there was a lot of reflective material on the front of the Rover which meant that you had to be very careful.

145:09:08|ALSJ|LMP|In working with Ron Schrieve, an old friend of mine at UCLA who is an expert on landslides and avalanches, we had come up with a list of things that one might see to verify if this was actually an avalanche deposit that we were driving over. And this discussion refers to the list of things that one sees in terrestrial avalanches. And what I was saying was that 100 million years or so of gardening has pretty well destroyed the kind of detailed features that Ron had indicated one might see on a fresh avalanche. Now, one thing that I thought I observed at the time but which hasn't come up yet in the transcript - which makes me think it must have come up when I started studying the photographs after the mission - was that it appeared that the larger the crater in the surface of the light mantle, the larger the blocks that were on its rim. Combining that observation with the lack of any sizable rocks in the rake samples suggested that you get fine material on top and coarser and coarser material as you go down in the light mantle, which is what you would expect to happen in an avalanche. The larger fragments having a smaller surface area to volume ratio, and would naturally sink to the bottom of the flow. And that's really the only possible evidence we saw that it was actually an avalanche, other than the general form and characteristics.
145:09:08|ALSJ||Prior to Apollo 17, Jack made a series of bets with geologist Robin Brett concerning the answers to a number of geological questions to be addressed by Apollo 17. Grant Heiken, editor with David Vaniman and Bevan French of the superb <a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/books/lunar_sourcebook/"@alsjt>Lunar Sourcebook</a>, has provided a copy of the <a href="Schmitt-Brett.gif"@alsjt>document</a> signed by Schmitt and Brett formalizing the bets. Item 3 deals with the light mantle.
145:10:35|ALSJ||Jack's @alsjurl/a17/a17.1451039_trv.jpg"@alsjt>three photos</a> of the approach to this crater are AS17-133- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20205"@alsjt>20205</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20206"@alsjt>20206</a>, and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20207"@alsjt>20207</a>.
145:11:04|ALSJ||Gene is probably saying that this is the first really blocky-rimmed crater they've seen on the light mantle.
145:11:04|ALSJ||Gene is taking a turn at description while Jack grabs a quick sample. This is another example of efficient team work. The documentation photos for this sample are AS17-133- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20208"@alsjt>20208</a> and AS17-137- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20983"@alsjt>20983</a>. The samples, 74115 to 74119, all proved to be regolith breccias - so-called 'instant rock' - formed by the compression of regolith by the impact. Like regolith breccias Gene and Jack will sample at Station 9 and Dave and Jim sampled at their Station 9, regolith breccias are 'friable', meaning that they break apart or crumble easily. The crater is about 15 meters across and the impact din't reach deep enough to bring up any basalt from the underlying mare material.
145:11:49|ALSJ||Jack's next @alsjurl/a17/a17.1451153_trv.jpg"@alsjt>five photos</a> are AS17-133- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20209"@alsjt>20209</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20213"@alsjt>20213</a>. The first of these was taken as they drove off the ejecta blanket of the fragmental crater.
145:12:37|ALSJ||This is stop LRV-5. When the bag was opened after the mission, the contents were subsequently split into Apollo samples 74110 through 74119. As indicated in - or can be inferred from - the Preliminary Science Report, samples 74110 - 74114 contain the soil that was in the bag while samples 74115 through 74119 are described as "friable clods", an indication that most of the "fragments" around the crater are regolith breccias - or "instant rock" - formed from soil compacted in the impact that dug the crater.

145:13:44|ALSJ||Jack is noting that, while it may be nighttime in Houston, it's daytime at Taurus-Littrow.
145:14:42|ALSJ|CDR|It's hard to recall, but I've got to believe that we were forced into that decision because we had already stopped and had positioned ourselves to get that sample. And, when you're there, it makes sense to get it. And, heck, it didn't take 30 seconds.
145:14:50|ALSJ||This may be AS17-133- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20218"@alsjt>20218</a>.
145:15:19|ALSJ||The checklist indicates a Shorty location of 101/4.1. The actual Shorty stop will be at 102/4.4. See, however, the discussion at 145:23:32.
145:15:36|ALSJ||Jack's @alsjurl/a17/a17.1451539_trv.jpg"@alsjt>four photos</a> taken during the next stage of the traverse are AS17-133- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20219"@alsjt>20219</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20222"@alsjt>20222</a>.

145:19:51|ALSJ||In frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20223"@alsjt>20223</a>, Shorty is on the right.
145:19:51|ALSJ||In @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20226"@alsjt>20226</a>, Shorty is hidden by an intervening ridge.
145:19:51|ALSJ||Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20227"@alsjt>20227</a> is the best of the approach pictures. The Station 4 boulder is on the right, just below the low-gain antenna rear extension.
145:21:35|ALSJ||Jack takes AS17-133- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20227"@alsjt>20227</a>, the best of the approach pictures, at about this point. It shows the boulder.
145:22:13|ALSJ|CDR|As I recall, we had worked out all the parking attitudes based on for battery cooling, TV coverage, and a number of things.
145:22:13|ALSJ||Jack takes AS17-133- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20228"@alsjt>20228</a> as Gene turns to park.
145:22:41|ALSJ||They are probably getting their first look into the crater.
145:22:41|ALSJ|LMP|I don't remember coming up to the rim of Shorty very well. I can remember looking into the crater. Apparently, from the dialog here, it looked as if we were headed into the crater; although, from the photographs of where we parked the Rover, it doesn't look like we were that close to going down into the crater.
145:22:45|ALSJ||They are now about 4 hours 49 minutes into the EVA. As indicated by the dash lines in the walkback diagram ( @alsjurl/a17/A17Walkback.gif"@alsjt>50k</a> ), they have about a half an hour till they have to leave. At @alsjurl/a17/a17.sta4.html#1453701"@alsjt>145:37:01</a> Bob will tell Gene and Jack that they will have to leave no later than 145:57.
145:23:22|ALSJ|CDR|I didn't say "4.2" very clearly, but I can hear it and that's what it was.
145:23:32|ALSJ||As indicated in the Rover navigation work-up at 164:48:06, a range of 4.2 kilometers gives a SEP transmitter position in error to the west by almost 200 meters. A reading of 4.4 would be more compatible with the known locations of the SEP transmitter and of Station 4. Readers should note that, although Gene's "4.2" has always sounded to me (and to the original NASA transcriber) like "4.4", he is quite positive that what is recorded on the tape is 4.2. The fact that Bob seems to have heard 4.2 is additional supporting evidence of Gene's contention. If true, the only other comparable Nav system error is the Station 2 reading which gives a 200 meter easterly error. These uncertainties are comparable to the range reading observed by the Apollo 15 crew when they returned to the LM at the end of their second EVA. On this second Apollo 17 EVA, the residual error back at the LM will be less than 100 meters. As a final piece of evidence, we have Gene's report that they were at a range of 4.5 one minute before he had the Rover parked. To get to 4.2 in one minute, he had to reduce his range by at least 200 meters and probably a bit more. The implied minimum speed of 12 clicks is at the upper bounds of plausibility, especially if we deduct time for final maneuvering into the final orientation for parking. I believe that the bulk of the evidence supports 4.4 and I have used that figure in the Rover navigation work-up reported at 164:48.
145:23:48|ALSJ||TV on.
145:23:48|ALSJ|LMP|The tiredness is clearly gone from my voice. Getting there provided a new surge of adrenaline. Visually, this was a lot more exciting than Station 3, and it got even more exciting with the discovery of the orange soil. Station 3 was a lot of work; and this one turned out to be fun.
145:24:47|ALSJ||Gene leans in front of the rearward-facing TV to dust the right-side battery covers. The tasks planned for Station 4 are listed on cuff checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_cdr2021.jpg"@alsjt>LMP/CDR-21</a>. Because of the imminent discovery of orange soil on the rim of Shorty, this list of tasks will be abandoned.
145:24:47|ALSJ|CDR|(Watching the video) This is very interesting. You can see a reflection in my visor of me dusting the battery covers.
145:25:00|ALSJ||Jack is moving toward the boulder.
145:25:14|ALSJ||Gene has finished with the battery covers and moves to his side of the Rover.
145:25:57|ALSJ||@alsjurl/Fendell-Bio.pdf"@alsjt>Fendell</a> pans to Gene dusting the left-side battery covers.
145:25:57|ALSJ||Jack is not going to try solo sampling this time.
145:26:04|ALSJ||Gene dusts his @alsjurl/alsj-RCU.html"@alsjt>RCU</a>. The brush looks like a 6-inch paint brush.
145:26:22|ALSJ||Jack has just seen the orange soil. He is cautious, having been fooled by sunlight reflected off the LCRU at the Scarp stop.
145:26:26|ALSJ||Fendell starts panning slowly counter-clockwise.
145:26:27|ALSJ|LMP|The orange soil was several meters away from the Rover, up closer to the boulder. The orange spots of light that I saw reflected off the LCRU at the Scarp stop were tiny things; the Mylar covering the LCRU was crinkled, and you only got small spots every once in a while when the Sun angles were just right. When I spotted the orange soil, I probably hadn't even started the pan. What I probably saw was the scuff marks I'd made when I went over to the boulder. Actually you could see the orange through the regolith, but it was more obvious after you'd stirred it up.
145:26:27|ALSJ||The patch of orange soil will become discernible in the TV picture once Fendell has panned around to the boulder.
145:26:32|ALSJ|CDR|Quite frankly, when Jack said he saw orange soil, I began to wonder if he hadn't been on the Moon too long. Until I saw it myself.
145:26:46|ALSJ|CDR|Like a pair of ordinary sunglasses, the visor attenuated the light but didn't really change the colors. If it was red, it was red; if it was blue, it was blue. But you could see the colors better with the visor up. I do that flying; I take my sunglasses off if I really want to see things clearly. So lifting up the visor was a natural thing for me to do.
145:26:54|ALSJ||Gene passes in front of the panning TV, on his way to the SEP receiver. At some point during this exchange, Jack starts his @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20229"@alsjt>Station 4 pan</a>.
145:26:54|ALSJ||With regard to the timing of the pan, what seems likely is that Jack went over to examine the boulder and then moved back part way toward the Rover to start his pan. Because he always started his pans with a down-Sun shot, he would have been facing the boulder and would have seen the disturbed orange soil before actually taking a picture. Having made his report to Houston, he then started the pan while he waited for Gene to finish his housekeeping chores at the Rover. Note that @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20248"@alsjt>20248</a> shows Gene replacing the @alsjurl/a17/alsj-dustbrush.html"@alsjt>dustbrush</a> in its bracket on the front of the Rover. This picture was, therefore, taken at about 145:27:34. Note that we know from the TV record that Jack's Station 3 pan took about a minute and a half to complete. Both that pan and the one taken here at Shorty consist of about 27 frames, so we can fairly safely assume that the Shorty pan also takes no more than a minute and a half to complete - less if Jack hurried a bit or could take pictures more quickly because, here, he is standing on level ground. 20248 is the 20th frame in the pan, and its timing suggests that Jack started the pan at - or, perhaps, a little later than - 145:26:30. This estimate is consistent with Jack's recollection that he didn't actually do the pan until after he reported the orange soil to Houston.
145:27:07|ALSJ||This may be a serious question. Many American cheeses are orange.
145:27:07|ALSJ|LMP|You'll have to ask Bob, but I think he was thinking of green cheese, as in 'The Moon's made out of green cheese.' My guess is that he wasn't convinced that we weren't trying to pull their leg again. And for good reason, because every once in a while we'd do that, either inadvertently or advertently.
145:27:07|ALSJ||Bob says that it was a serious question - but with a joke thrown in.
145:27:21|ALSJ||A detail from Gene's Station 1 photo AS17-134-@alsjurl/a17/as17-20425det.jpg"@alsjt>20425</a> shows an orange "LMP" decal on the side of Jack's camera. See, also, AS17-134-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20426"@alsjt>20426</a>. A similar 'CDR' decal can be seen on the top of John Young's camera, just behind the lens, in a detail from Apollo 16 training photo @alsjurl/a17/a16/a16detKSC71PC776.jpg"@alsjt>KSC-71PC-776</a>; and an 'LMP' decal on Charlie's camera in a @alsjurl/a17/a16/a16detksc71pc777.jpg"@alsjt>detail</a> from Apollo 16 training photo @alsjurl/a17/a16/images16.html#KSC71PC777"@alsjt>KSC-71PC-777</a>.

145:27:21|ALSJ||Gene passes in front of the TV going around the front of the Rover to replace the @alsjurl/alsj-dustbrush.html"@alsjt>dustbrush</a> on the left corner of the LCRU and then go to his seat to get the @alsjurl/alsj-lensbrush.html"@alsjt>lens brush</a> for the TV camera.
145:27:23|ALSJ||Frame AS17-133-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20248"@alsjt>20248</a> in Jack's pan shows Gene replacing the @alsjurl/a17/alsj-dustbrush.html"@alsjt>dustbrush</a> on the LCRU.
145:27:50|ALSJ|LMP|The dust is going to get into anything that's not hermetically sealed. After a while, moving parts don't move any more with dust in them. We had a bracket for the dusting brush, and that bracket was now full of dust and he couldn't get the brush handle in it. One lock on the gate was no longer usable; and I was having an awfully hard time getting my scoop on and off.
145:27:50|ALSJ||Fendell finds Jack just west of the Rover finishing his pan. He takes the last frame a second or two before 145:28:15 and then hops west toward the scoop. He had dropped it, probably prior to starting the pan, and apparently contemplates going to one knee to get it; but he then kicks the scoop a few feet to toward Shorty, perhaps so that his feet will be downslope when he drops to his hands and knees and then pushes back to with his hands. With his feet and/or knees downslope, a given push off his hands will be more effective in getting his center-of-mass far enough back that he can stand.
145:28:15|ALSJ|LMP|I don't know what Gene had in mind, but I suspect that the sounder was just an instrument in the Command Module that he remembered that you could point at something. But the sounder wouldn't have had anything to see here, because of it's coarse resolution, if nothing else.
145:28:15|ALSJ||The Apollo Lunar Sounder Experiment (ALSE) used radar equipment on the Command and Service Module to map lunar topography and variation in subsurface electrical conductivity. Water present in the subsurface materials would influence the conductivity and, as Journal Contributor George Giusti notes, the orange/red color may have gotten Gene thinking about rust (oxidation) and, therefore, water and the sounder. Giusti writes, "According to the December 11, 1972 issue of US News and World Report, the sounder was intended to 'search by radar, from the orbiting command ship, America, for signs of water under the lunar surface'. My notes taken at the time of the mission indicate that, after the discovery of the orange soil, Farouk El Baz was quoted over the television as saying that the color might be due to the presence of water at some time in the lunar history. Indeed, the December 13 issue of the San Francisco Examiner has an article saying: 'Farouk El Baz said the orange color most likely was the result of iron in the lunar soil rusted by the water vapor escaping from the vent'. Maybe Gene was thinking along the same lines and that's why he wanted the sounder.
145:28:15|ALSJ||Readers should also note that the resolution of the instrument was no better than about 400 meters and, as Jack says, was incapable of seeing detail on the scale of Shorty.
145:28:15|ALSJ|LMP|Of course, Ron started to see orange areas from orbit as soon as he heard about it. He saw orange in the southwestern part of the Serenitatis Basin, in what's called the Sulpicius Gallus region ( @alsjurl/a17/a17LTO42D4.jpg"@alsjt>12 Mb</a> ). And, when Gene and I got back into orbit, we were able to confirm and I mapped quite extensive regions of the orange and other colors. And, as we left the Moon, we were looking back at a full Moon and, for a little while, we had good color/tint definition.
145:28:15|ALSJ||See, also, the @alsjurl/a17/a17.homeward.html#orange"@alsjt>discussion</a> in the chapter covering orbital activities after rendezvous.
145:28:15|ALSJ||At this moment, Evans is about ten minutes from LOS (Loss of Signal) on his 29th orbit. News of the discovery of the orange soil won't be passed up to him until shortly after he reappears around the Moon's eastern limb at 146:14. At that time he will have the following exchange with Houston: CapCom: While you're doing your pre-sleep checklist, you might be interested that, at Shorty, the surface crew found some very, very orange soil, a great deal of it. Indicates strong oxidation and possibly indicates water and/or volcanics in the area. And they're really...Jack's kind of like a boy at Christmas time. I'll tell you, a little kid at Christmas time on that one. Evans: (Laughing) I bet he would be. Hey, that's a great find, by gosh! CapCom: Yeah, that's the first time we find...It's orange. Boy, you can see it in the television; it's bright orange soil. No question about it. Evans: I'll be darned. CapCom: And, as luck would have it, they found it all and got working, and then they had to pull out of Shorty due to constraints, walkback constraints in the area. You know, consumables versus walkback.
145:28:15|ALSJ||Evans begins his rest period about ten minutes later; his wake-up call will come at 154:40; and it won't be until he gets a chance to look at Shorty at 166:17:51 that he becomes convinced that there is an orange tint around the crater and in certain other areas. His observation is reported to Gene and Jack at 171:02:56 and is reproduced there. It is important to note that, throughout the mission Evans has been conscious of variations in shades and tints and has reported his impressions. At 158:35:09, he remarks that "You know, to me the Moon's got a lot more color than I'd been led to believe. I kind of had the impression that everything was the same color. That's far from being true." However, the shades and tints are subtle and it will take a look at Shorty before he is convinced that he can see the orange from orbit.
145:28:15|ALSJ|CDR|When I heard that Ron had seen some orange patches from orbit, I was concerned that maybe the power of suggestion had taken over. You can stand on the Moon and suggest colors to yourself and you begin to see those colors. You could tint the bland gray color of the Moon blue or green or brown. By this time I was absolutely convinced that Jack and I could see the definitive color delineation between the orange and the gray (at Shorty), but I was concerned that Ron was being influenced by the power of suggestion. But, when we got back into orbit, I ate my thoughts because we really did see areas that you could definitively define as orange. Now, whether we would have seen those orange patches had we not seen orange soil on the surface, I don't know. If we had not found orange soil on the surface, we might have seen the orange areas from orbit and have just passed them off as reflections of some kind; because, who would have expected to find orange soil on the Moon? But, having known it was on the surface, we could feel comfortable about being able to say that we could see the orange from orbit.
145:28:15|ALSJ|LMP|The reason that this was a little more exciting than it might have even been otherwise was that, in our thinking about the origins of Shorty, we really had two major possibilities, with a number of observations related to each one. Number One was what we really believed and what turned out to be true: that Shorty was an impact crater that had penetrated the light mantle and was exposing the dark-mantle and/or subfloor basalt beneath. The other alternative, just because of the lack of resolution and information from the pre-mission photographs, was that it was a dark-haloed volcanic crater; and, if that were true, one of the things that we had on our list to look for were signs of alteration, possible fluid-induced alteration of materials around the crater. And normally, on Earth, that alteration is colored, fumarolic alteration from oxidation. And so, when we saw orange, that was the immediate thought that everybody had. 'My God, there's a volcanic emanation here that's altered the soil.' Well, it turned out that that wasn't true, of course. It was volcanic material, but it was volcanic glass that had been spewed out of some fire-fountain-like eruptions 3.5 billion years ago that somehow had been protected from mixing with anything else, even though it was now at the surface. It had almost certainly been covered almost immediately by a lava flow, so that it was protected from meteor disruption and stirring. And then, when Shorty formed, somehow the pyroclastic ended up in the rim and a few other places in nearly pure form. There are some issues having to do with its origins that we can get to in a moment, but that's what caused all the excitement. We had sort of halfway predicted that we would find it there, even though it turned out not to be what we predicted we would find. They had a camera running in the Backroom, and what it shows is that, when that call came over, everybody sort of jumped up in the air and there was just total loss of control in the back science room.
145:28:15|ALSJ||Post-flight photo @alsjurl/a17/ap17-S73-15171.jpg"@alsjt>S73-15171</a> shows some of the orange and black glass spheres, which have typical sizes of 20-45 microns.
145:28:15|ALSJ||Jack goes on hands and knees to get the scoop and, to get up, pushes sharply with his hands to get on his knees. He rotates backwards and, as his PLSS gets over his feet, he rises easily. He may have put his feet in a small crater to get leverage. This would explain his kicking the scoop earlier. Once he's up, Jack goes about ten feet toward the orange soil, carrying the scoop. Fendell pans counter-clockwise.
145:28:15|ALSJ|CDR|This is not meant as a criticism, but I think that Jack tended to fall more than the rest of us did. And it's maybe because he became more aggressive. And, thank God for one-sixth gravity. You would have dropped things anyway because of the lack of nimbleness and dexterity and you would have wanted to get down to pick things up and chip rocks and what have you. And one-sixth gravity made getting back up a lot easier than it would have been otherwise. You developed a personal technique - the way you skipped or hopped, the way you got on and off the Rover, the way you got up when you fell.
145:28:50|ALSJ||Gene moves the TV so that he can dust it.
145:28:57|ALSJ||Gene re-positions the TV.
145:29:43|ALSJ||In getting the gnomon, Gene will disturb the Rover and, therefore, the gravimeter. Therefore, he doesn't want to start the measurement until he has the gnomon. Fendell returns to Jack, who is digging his trench.
145:29:43|ALSJ|LMP|What we dug was half of a trench. That is, we'd only try to maintain one wall - the east-facing wall - and tear down the other one so that you could see in.
145:30:06|ALSJ||At @alsjurl/a17/a17.sta4.html#1453701"@alsjt>145:37:01</a> Bob will tell Gene and Jack that they will have to leave no later than 145:57. They are currently about 4 hours 56 minutes into the EVA and the dash lines in the walkback diagram ( @alsjurl/a17/A17Walkback.gif"@alsjt>50k</a> ) indicate that they will have to leave at about 5 hours 24 minutes.
145:30:16|ALSJ||After Fendell gets Jack in the TV field-of-view so they can watch him digging the trench, the TV starts tilting down.
145:30:19|ALSJ||In Houston, Ed Fendell tells Flight "It's gone (meaning 'tilted') down on me, and I can't tilt it (back up). Journal Contributor Bertrand Ouellet suggests that Bob said "dived", rather than "died". I"m not convinced I can hear the 'v' sound but, this context, either word describes the situation.
145:30:35|ALSJ||Gene raises the TV, thereby disturbing the gravimeter.
145:31:00|ALSJ||Fendell returns to Jack; the orange is faintly visible in a video tape copy made in 1989.
145:31:04|ALSJ||Gene joins Jack and looks west into the trench.
145:31:28|ALSJ|LMP|I think there have been others, but this is a particularly good example of where Gene deferred to me in organizing how we would approach a geological problem, just as I would defer to him on the Rover stuff and things like that. It worked out pretty well; that had all been sorted out, almost without us knowing it, during the training cycle.
145:31:28|ALSJ|CDR|You can't specifically train for every moment of the mission, so the key is that you train for knowledge of each other and you train for teamwork. And, when you come up with something new and different, you just defer to each other's capabilities. In this particular case, Jack had pretty much surrounded the orange-soil project, if you will, and had in his mind what we needed to get. So we went ahead and did it.
145:31:28|ALSJ||Gene puts the gnomon on the ground and takes a cross-Sun picture from the south while Jack takes a down-Sun from the east. Unfortunately, all of the pictures Jack took after finishing his pan are badly overexposed and/or motion blurred, possibly because of his excitement. These are frames AS17-133- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20257"@alsjt>20257</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20268"@alsjt>20268</a>. It is interesting to note that, although Jack first noticed the orange soil at about the time he started his pan, Jack's pan frames weren't blurred beyond that caused by the dust smudge that appears on all the frames after 20215.
145:31:28|ALSJ||Gene's cross-Sun pictures taken here are AS17-137- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20984"@alsjt>20984</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20986"@alsjt>20986</a>. Notice the width of the orange band that Jack has exposed and how the orange color fades toward the far end, which is nearest the crater rim.
145:31:45|ALSJ||This is the two-meter-high boulder a few feet west of the trench.
145:31:58|ALSJ||Gene does a deep knee bend to get the close-ups from a few feet southeast of the trench. These photos are AS17-137- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20987"@alsjt>20987</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20989"@alsjt>20989</a>.
145:31:58|ALSJ|CDR|You can see here how I could bend down without kneeling - without getting to a static position - to get some close-up pictures. In one-sixth gravity you can go down slow enough and you can waver in that almost-kneeling position - uncomfortable and hard to sustain - long enough to get a couple of pictures at a 125th of a second.
145:32:06|ALSJ||Gene goes a few feet east for the down-Sun, AS17-137-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20990"@alsjt>20990</a>.
145:32:37|ALSJ||They move in to sample: Jack with the scoop, Gene opening a bag.
145:32:51|ALSJ||Jack means that the soil is cohesive. He goes to his upslope (left) knee to scoop soil from the bottom of the trench; but he spills some of the soil getting up.
145:33:04|ALSJ|LMP|It came out in chunks. It was cohesive. It eventually fell apart as they worked with it in Houston, but it was cohesive enough that when we put it in the bags it was in chunks.
145:33:05|ALSJ||About a cup full of the orange soil has stayed in the scoop; Jack pours it into the bag.
145:33:12|ALSJ||Jack is standing east of the trench, casting a shadow on it.
145:33:17|ALSJ||Jack goes to the south end of the trench, Gene to the north. Jack goes to one knee to sample. He gets off balance with his right knee off the ground and, in the process of jumping to his feet, kicks surface material into the trench.
145:33:29|ALSJ||Jack does a deep knee bend and gets a sample this time.
145:33:42|ALSJ||Jack pours the sample into the waiting bag.
145:33:49|ALSJ||Gene closes the bag while Jack extends the trench southward to well past the edge of the orange band. Gene then puts the sample in Jack's SCB.
145:34:00|ALSJ||Jack is working hard. He gets another sample.
145:34:21|ALSJ||Jack pours.
145:34:35|ALSJ||Jack gets a sample by scooping sideways, knees bent.
145:34:40|ALSJ||Jack pours, and then presents his SCB for loading. He @alsjurl/alsj-ValveCluster.html"@alsjt>changes his cooling</a> while he waits.
145:35:13|ALSJ|LMP|Post-mission analysis showed that the orange soil turned out to be very small, spherical beads of glass, rich in titanium and low in silica and with the intensity of the orange color apparently related to the titanium/iron ratio.
145:35:19|ALSJ||<b>145:35:19</b> Schmitt: Moving to the north end of the trench
145:35:28|ALSJ||Gene opens a bag; Jack pours.
145:35:34|ALSJ||The short can or Special Environmental Sample Container (@alsjurl/tools/judy92.gif"@alsjt>SESC</a>) is 13 cm tall and has a 6 cm inside diameter. Like the long can (CVSC) used to transport one of the Station 3 drive tubes and, like the rock boxes (SRCs), the short can has a knife edge/indium seal to protect the sample from terrestrial and spacecraft gases. In order to increase the chances of getting a good seal, both the knife edge and the indium are protected with Teflon covers which Gene will remove just before he closes and latches the lid. In addition, Gene will put the short can in the rock box at the end of the EVA, doubling the chances that at least one seal - the short can itself or the rock box - will be good. Some of the knife-edge seals on previous missions were compromised by dust despite the precautions taken.
145:35:34|ALSJ||Training photo @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#KSC72PC440"@alsjt>KSC-72PC-440</a> shows the SESC in a pocket on the outside of the SCB on Gene's PLSS.
145:35:46|ALSJ||Gene puts the sample in Jack's SCB.
145:35:51|ALSJ||Gene goes to the Rover.
145:35:54|ALSJ||Jack comes about halfway back to the Rover then drags the scoop north along a crater radial.
145:36:24|ALSJ||A chorus of voices in Houston says "Yes".
145:36:24|ALSJ|LMP|The reason I asked the question was not so much because I disagreed but, as I did several times during the EVAs, I wanted to make the Backroom think a little bit, just to make sure they thought through some of the options they had. Based on the information we had up to this point, it looked like something vertical in the rim of the crater; and, fortunately, we did what they suggested and didn't change because, otherwise, we might not have hit the underlying black soil.
145:36:24|ALSJ||Twenty years after the fact, Gene questions whether Jack was quite so logical at the time.
145:36:26|ALSJ||Jack is removing the scoop from the extension handle so that he can attach it to the drive tubes.
145:36:36|ALSJ||What Jack means by "vertical stratigraphy" is that the orange soil deposit appears to have vertical contacts.
145:37:00|ALSJ||Jack goes to the Rover.
145:37:12|ALSJ||They are currently about 5 hours 03 minutes into the EVA and the dash lines in the walkback diagram ( @alsjurl/a17/A17Walkback.gif"@alsjt>50k</a> ) indicate that they will have to leave at about 5 hours 24 minutes.
145:37:15|ALSJ||Jack turns to look into Shorty; Fendell camera pans clockwise toward the crater.
145:37:41|ALSJ||Gene crosses the TV picture, carrying the core tubes.
145:38:29|ALSJ||trench, for the core)? (Pause) You know, we just about got laughs
145:39:00|ALSJ||Once he gets back in the LM, Gene will describe his piece of glass in some detail at 149:12:10.
145:39:26|ALSJ||This photo, like the others Jack has taken since finishing his pan, is badly overexposed.
145:40:22|ALSJ||Fendell returns to the astronauts. Jack is facing west with his back to the camera; Gene is facing him. The core tube is out of sight between them.
145:40:40|ALSJ||Jack is holding the core tube while Gene hammers it, and Gene is very anxious about that. He stutters a couple of phrases before he gets the thought out.
145:40:41|ALSJ||Jack moves out of the way to the south. Gene raises the hammer to level with the top of his helmet and swings down to hit the top of the extension handle at about waist height. He is hitting with the flat of the hammer to get a better chance of connecting.
145:40:41|ALSJ|CDR|You had to hold the hammer tightly with your fingers. It was like gripping your golf club too tightly: all your muscles tighten up and your swing goes to hell and you get tired. And to make it harder, the core wasn't going down all that readily. It was just a heavy bit of work, particularly clutching the hammer.
145:40:45|ALSJ||Usually, a locator is a shot taken at the sample site of either the LM or the Rover.
145:41:05|ALSJ||Gene stops to rest. Jack takes a picture of the Rover as a locator. Gene then hits the core a half dozen times more and stops. Jack's visor is halfway up.
145:41:27|ALSJ||Gene hits the core seven times more.
145:41:47|ALSJ||Gene stands south of the core, facing east, and grabs the tube in his left hand. Jack stands to the north, facing west, and grabs with his left hand.
145:41:57|ALSJ||The core comes out about a foot with apparent ease.
145:42:03|ALSJ||Gene gets a core tube cap off of the left side of Jack's PLSS.
145:42:11|ALSJ||Jack finishes pulling the tube out of the ground.
145:42:16|ALSJ||Jack raises the bottom of the tube for Gene to examine and cap. See, also, training photo @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#72H1229"@alsjt>72-H-1229</a>.
145:42:27|ALSJ|LMP|Post mission analysis showed that the black soil was mostly beads of devitrified (crystallized) glass of the same composition as the orange, but with a different cooling history.
145:42:39|ALSJ|LMP|It turned out to be ilmenite.
145:43:10|ALSJ|LMP|I think Gene had gotten the cap partially threaded on and wanted me to finish the threading by turning the tube in my hand while he held the cap.
145:43:14|ALSJ||This time, Gene doesn't have to use the double wave to reach his cooling control.
145:43:14|ALSJ|CDR|You can see in the TV how much inertia I got into my arm to get it back there. I didn't move back slowly at all. I already had my hand chest high and I sort of raised my hand and then moved back very rapidly. You just couldn't go back slowly and sneak up on it. Other times, when my arm was down more, I'd have to do the double pump; but, here, my hand was already up there. You adapted mentally and physiologically to find the easy way to do things like this and, rather than bust my butt trying to stretch and push that suit to go back, I'd just bring my hand up chest high and, with the strength I'd need if I was swinging the hammer, just swing my arm back there. Then, once your hand was back there, the suit was stiff enough that, before it rebounded, you could reach the control and not have to forcibly hold your arm back there.
145:43:32|ALSJ||Gene goes to the Rover.
145:43:45|ALSJ||They are currently about 5 hours 10 minutes into the EVA and the dash lines in the walkback diagram ( @alsjurl/a17/A17Walkback.gif"@alsjt>50k</a> ) indicate that they will have to leave at about 5 hours 24 minutes (145:57). The walkback constraint is based on the assumption that they would average 2.7 km/hr. They are 4.4 kilometers from the LM, so the walkback would take them 1 hour 38 minutes, getting them back at 7 hours 2 minutes with enough margins for an unhurried close-out.
145:43:55|ALSJ||Jack gets about halfway to the Rover when Bob gives the go-ahead to sample the boulder. He turns, gets the gnomon, and positions it at the east base of the boulder.
145:44:30|ALSJ|LMP|When we knew we only had a little bit of time, we got things done a lot better than when we did a station for no specific purpose, like Station 3. Station 3 was a disaster. We got a lot done, but it was a very poor use of time. This one was both productive and fun.
145:44:30|ALSJ||Jack is standing southeast of the boulder taking photographs. These photos are also badly overexposed and the next usable photos he will take will be once he gets back on the Rover for the drive to Station 5.
145:44:40|ALSJ||Jack moves to take down-Sun pictures of the boulder.
145:44:47|ALSJ||Jack leans on the boulder to examine it, then pulls off a hand-sized sample. He then moves southeast to take some "after" pictures.
145:44:47|ALSJ|LMP|The boulder had been intensely shocked. It was falling apart.
145:45:18|ALSJ||Jack picks up the gnomon and heads for the Rover.
145:45:47|ALSJ||Gene is trying to get a core cap out of the dispenser.
145:45:59|ALSJ||Gene hands Jack a sample bag. Jack's visor is up and we can see his face. He has probably had the visor up ever since he first found the orange soil.
145:45:59|ALSJ|LMP|Here, when I was bagging the sample, I was using the @alsjurl/alsj-RCU.html"@alsjt>RCU</a> and the top of my camera as a work bench that was immediately available.
145:45:59|ALSJ||John Young did something similar while collecting samples prior to the start of the A16 EVA-1 traverse.
145:46:10|ALSJ||The pockets on the side of Gene's SCB are clearly visible. Gene picks up something with his tongs.
145:46:54|ALSJ||Gene is at the left rear of the Rover. Jack is gathering the gnomon legs in his fist prior to stowage.
145:47:16|ALSJ||That is, compact the material in the core by ramming a "follower" on top of the soil so that it won't get shaken and mixed.
145:47:24|ALSJ||Gene heads east; Fendell follows him.
145:47:38|ALSJ||Gene takes this pan from about 40 meters east of the Rover.
145:48:06|ALSJ||Fendell catches up with Gene at the southeast rim of the crater.
145:48:06|ALSJ||The TV picture shakes as Jack works at the Rover.
145:48:36|ALSJ|LMP|A first-rate observation.
145:48:36|ALSJ|CDR|- (Tongue slightly in cheek) "I really do appreciate getting an A-plus on the quiz. I really wondered; it's taken a long time (nearly 19 years) to find out how I did.
145:48:36|ALSJ||Frame AS17-137-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20996"@alsjt>20996</a> from Gene's pan shows these orange/red streaks.

145:49:30|ALSJ||Gene moves about ten feet west. As he moves, he kicks flat sheets of dust a few inches off the ground. The sheets reflect sunlight into the TV camera, creating a short-lived patch of light.
145:49:51|ALSJ||Gene heads back toward the Rover.
145:51:21|ALSJ||Gene grabs the TV and turns it to point into the west portion of the crater.
145:52:57|ALSJ||This is another explosives package for the seismic experiment.
145:53:10|ALSJ||The scoop head can be rotated by squeezing a pair of flat plates on either side of the pivot. By pushing the plates, a locking mechanism releases. There are detents at angles to the handle of 0, 40, and 90 degrees. Here, Jack has been using the 40 degree detent.
145:53:11|ALSJ||Fendell finds Earth, which is a bit more than half illuminated.
145:53:33|ALSJ||Gene's "I guess I owe you" was said so quickly that, despite numerous listenings, none of us could figure out what he said until, during a final review of the manuscript, I was finally listening to it in the right frame of mind. Bob's next statement makes it clear that he didn't understand what Gene said and thought he was talking about comm quality.
145:54:42|ALSJ||TV off
145:55:31|ALSJ||The seat belt feels snug.
145:55:40|ALSJ||The warning flag is a thin metal plate, hinged at the top of the control console and held down by a spring. It is painted with diagonal red stripes and is triggered by thermostats in the batteries, nominally at 125 F, and in the drive motors at 400F. The warning flag can be reset.
145:55:43|ALSJ|LMP|We could see part of each other's footpan, but not all of it because of the console.
145:55:45|ALSJ||On the first day, the battery temperatures had been higher than expected and, prior to the second EVA, engineers at the Marshall Spaceflight Center in Huntsville had re-examined the question of battery sensitivity to temperature and advised the Flight Director and the crew that temperatures below 140 degrees Fahrenheit (or 60 Celsius) wouldn't be a problem.
145:55:45|ALSJ|LMP|The temperatures were getting up there; but Marshall also had pretty good safety margins on those batteries. The fact that they were getting hotter was a concern, but they never caused a problem.
145:55:54|ALSJ|LMP|My first inclination in the MOCR would have been to turn around and say 'Did anybody get that?,' rather than call right up and distract the crew.
145:56:21|ALSJ||As indicated by the dash lines in the walkback diagram ( @alsjurl/a17/A17Walkback.gif"@alsjt>50k</a> ) they had to leave by about 5 hours 24 minutes, which is about 145:57. Now that they will drive nearly three kilometers toward the LM at a much higher average speed than the assume walkback speed of 2.7 km/hr, walkback will no longer be important constraint for this EVA.
145:56:38|ALSJ||Gene will drive 1.5 kilometers east from Shorty to get to Victory Crater, where they will make a very brief stop to deploy the seismic charge. However, because of the bright Sun, Gene will tend to tack, turning slightly north and then slightly south to avoid the worst of the glare. A @alsjurl/a17/a17LaraShortyVictoryCamelot-lbl.jpg"@alsjt>capture</a> from @alsjurl/a17/http://target.lroc.asu.edu/q3/"@alsjt>LROC Quick Map</a> shows the location of Victory relative to other EVA-2 traverse sites.
145:56:49|ALSJ||Jack and Gene had both been so busy that they hadn't been able to listen carefully to each other's conversations with Bob. In Gene's case, he had completely missed the fact that Jack had already sampled the boulder; and, here, Jack wants to confirm the details of Gene's observation - which he may have only half heard - of the radial pattern of orange soil.
145:56:49|ALSJ|LMP|I can't say I remember this exactly, but I'm confident that, as we were driving away and I was finally taking a deep breath, I was beginning to review the thirty minutes we'd had at Shorty and what it all meant. So I wanted to make sure I understood what Gene had seen.
145:57:38|ALSJ||They will actually make their stop at 106/3.2. Houston has again revised it's estimate of the SEP transmitter location and, indeed, now knows where it is to high accuracy.
145:57:50|ALSJ|CDR|Driving up-Sun was mean. It was like what happens in flight when the Sun's directly overhead and you look down. You just lose your visibility because of the glare.
145:58:00|ALSJ||Jack's photos taken during the traverse from Shorty to Victory (@alsjurl/a17/a17trv20268-20280.pdf"@alsjt>18 Mb</a>) are AS17-133-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20268"@alsjt>20268 to 20280</a>. The first frame is overexposed but Jack set the camera properly before he taken 20269.
145:58:08|ALSJ|LMP|I started to talk too soon. I should have waited a few minutes; but I imagine the adrenaline was still flowing. I was trying to get to a point in my thoughts where I could start to interpret a little bit.
145:59:25|ALSJ||From the evidence of the overhead photography, there was a suggestion - as had been made for Shorty as well - that Van Serg Crater could be a volcanic feature. A visit to Van Serg (Station 9) is planned for EVA-3.
145:59:25|ALSJ|LMP|We were pretty quiet in here (for about forty-five seconds) and it seems to me that we were in a bit of a letdown after Shorty. We'd been on an emotional high and had been going so fast and needed to stop talking and take a deep emotional breath.
145:59:25|ALSJ|CDR|Being on the Rover was one of the few places where you could relax. Physically, you were constrained and had to relax. The only thing I had to do was drive - which took a little more attention than usual because of the Sun - and observe as best I could. Sometimes, not talking is very restful. When you're talking - particularly in a case like this, you've got to think; and thinking takes energy. And, after a while you get tired of hearing yourself talk. We'd done an awful lot in the last few minutes at Shorty and we needed to rest both mentally and physically.
146:00:43|ALSJ||In the overhead photographs, Tortilla Flats is a dark area between the main body of the light mantle to the west and a thin finger of light mantle to the east.
146:01:01|ALSJ|LMP|Victory is a 'V'-shaped depression that was probably made out of three craters. It commemorates @alsjurl/a17/a17.site.html#victory">Winston Churchill</a>. Although it's a political symbol, I think we actually got that one by the nomenclature committee.
146:01:37|ALSJ||At the House Rock stop on Apollo 16, at 167:32 of that mission, Duke hooked his sample bags onto his middle finger because the mounting bracket on his camera had failed.
146:01:49|ALSJ|LMP|This sounds like something that somebody might have said repeatedly during training, but I don't remember anything about it.
146:02:13|ALSJ|LMP|What I had hoped to do, as we crossed the edges of the light mantle on either side of Tortilla Flat, was to pick up anything at the contact that we might use to identify it. And, in retrospect, because we hadn't been able to see a sharp contact on the (down-Sun) drive to Station 2, with the Sun in my eyes there was just no way I was going to make any useful observations in here. So that's why there's not much information coming out of us at this point. Going down-Sun to Station 2, we had the highest albedo reflections coming right back at us and we could see the brighter crater walls on the light mantle. But going into the Sun you're mostly looking into shadow and there's also the obscuration caused by the dust on your visor.
146:02:26|ALSJ|LMP|The upper visor was the middle (laterally) part of the visor assembly that had a sunshade on it. It was fitted in a slot and you could grab the sunshade and pull it down. Mine had gotten a lot of dust in it.
146:02:43|ALSJ||In @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20272"@alsjt>20272</a>, Victory can be seen just above the TV camera.
146:02:43|ALSJ|CDR|In looking at some of the pictures that Jack took during the drive, you see things in one picture that you didn't see in the last. Everything was new. Every time you went over another hill, every time you went over a saddle, or went into another valley, you came into something that you didn't know was there or didn't expect to look like it actually looked. It was true exploration of a virgin territory; particularly with the mobility that the Rover gave.
146:03:48|ALSJ|LMP|A coincidental thing at this point in the transcript is that Professor McKinstry - after whom Van Serg Crater (Station 9) is named - had done a paper on geologese in which he made fun of what geologists sometimes use as terminology.
146:03:48|ALSJ|LMP|These pit-bottom craters really were quite common. I think that the depth of the bench in a pit-bottom crater varied with size. So I suspect, then, that it has to do with a relationship between the impact energy and the confinement of the regolith with depth. The more energy you have, the deeper it can penetrate before you have a hiatus in the relationship between confinement pressure, if you will, in the regolith and the excavation capability of the impact. I'm sure the soil mechanics people would have better ways to put that; but some of those pits were remarkable and, in my mind, it's a little hard to understand how those craters formed. It may reflect what people have said these impacts really are: small linear explosions. Near the upper surface, where there's no confinement, you get essentially a point explosion-type excavation. But, as you get near the depth of maximum penetration, you get more of a linear explosion back out. Who knows? They were quite common and the fresh ones, like all of the fresh craters, had a little glass in the bottom of them. I suspect they are prevalent everywhere on the Moon, but you're going to have to be clever to recognize them in the pictures. In a few places we sampled the glass and (in one case) even tried to get an oriented sample. One of the theories was that these impacts would cause local magnetic anomalies and we wanted to see if, as the glass cooled through the Curie point, it would retain memory of the field.

146:05:41|ALSJ|LMP|I don't think the antenna (on the charge) had to see the Central Station. There was a ground wave that would let you communicate.

146:08:41|ALSJ|LMP|You had to change the f-stop. With the Sun directly behind you it was f/11. On either side of that it was f/8. And then f/5.6 back toward the Sun. The shutter speed was 1/250th of a second. When we had color film in one of the cameras - usually in Gene's camera - we were making the first use of a brand new Kodak Ektachrome film.

146:09:01|ALSJ|LMP|It had seemed to me for a long time that with the Rover we just weren't getting enough statistical coverage of the regolith across the area, and the @alsjurl/a17/ap17-KSC-72PC-411.jpg"@alsjt>Rover Sampler</a> was a way to get more samples. I don't remember how many Rover samples we got, although it wasn't as many as I'd intended to get.
146:09:27|ALSJ||Jack believes that, at some point during training, he had requested a tool he could use to get samples from the Rover. "It was pretty much considered my baby.". Training photo @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#72H1227"@alsjt>72-H-1227</a> shows Jack using the sampler from his Rover seat.

146:09:39|ALSJ|LMP|Bob sometimes forgot to anticipate when the crew was busy.
146:10:11|ALSJ||They will drive about 1.9 kilometers on a heading of 120 to reach the southwest rim of Camelot.
146:10:25|ALSJ||Because they can't twist the suits and have limited field-of-view, Jack is asking Gene to turn the Rover.
146:10:25|ALSJ|CDR|Your helmet didn't move, so you had to turn your head. But the visor only let you look maybe 45 or 60 degrees to either side, so it was easier just to point the Rover.
146:12:09|ALSJ||This is a change from the location given on checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_cdr2425.jpg"@alsjt>LMP/CDR-25</a>, a revision due to the fact that the LM is not at the planned landing spot. Evidently, the Backroom is interested in a particular geographic location for the sample.
146:12:24|ALSJ|LMP|I think Bob may have been mis-using a term here. And that may be reflected in my next comment. A 'grid' sample would have been a series of samples on a map grid. So I'm not sure what he meant.
146:12:44|ALSJ||Long Pause; Jack hums at length from the Lerner and Lowe song 'Camelot': "Where once it never rained 'til after sundown," etc. Jack's traverse photos (@alsjurl/a17/a17trv20301-17.pdf: target="new>23 Mb</a>) taken from now until the completion of an LRV sample at @alsjurl/a17/#1461704">146:17:04</a> are AS17-133-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20301">20301 to 317</a>.

146:15:05|ALSJ|CDR|We were having a little observational debate through here. Jack looked at things differently than I did because of his professional background but, on the other hand, I always thought my observations were as good as his. You describe what you see. Someone else might interpret what it is. I always felt I didn't have to tell them what it was; I had to tell them what I was looking at. If I had an impression of what it might be, I'd give them that impression. But I don't think we had time to come to any absolute conclusions nor was it expected of us. We were on the Rover and we were moving and we had to give good enough observations that a geologist could put them together and come up with a pretty fair description of what these craters were all about.

146:19:19|ALSJ|LMP|That was the field geologist talking. When you're a field geologist and you say something's there and you put it on your map, you expect that people will trust you without a photograph. And Gene was thinking 'Nobody'll believe us unless there's a picture of it.'
146:19:19|ALSJ|CDR|A picture adds a lot to your description, particularly if you're in a hurry like we were at Shorty.
146:19:36|ALSJ||Jack's view may have been blocked by the high-gain; or Gene may have turned the Rover.
146:21:45|ALSJ||At @alsjurl/a17/a17.postland.html#1132322"@alsjt>113:23:22</a>, about twenty minutes after the landing, Gene commented on partially-buried boulders he'd seen and tried to avoid during the final approach.

In frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20325"@alsjt>20325</a>, boulders on the rim are visible in the glare of the Sun.
146:22:46|ALSJ||They are approaching the west rim of Camelot.
146:23:24|ALSJ||They will park just east of a group of meter-sized boulders. By parking east of the blocks, they will give Houston a view of them in full sunlight.
146:23:27|ALSJ||Gene also wants to give Houston a view of the blocks on the east wall of the crater.
146:24:04|ALSJ||If they are seeing Horatio, Gene must be headed west or southwest as he turns to get around the boulder field.
146:24:20|ALSJ||They've run over a rock with the wire wheel.
146:25:43|ALSJ||That is, Jack thinks he can complete the station without having to change film magazines.
146:26:26|ALSJ|LMP|Basically there wasn't going to be anything but the subfloor to sample here. Camelot is about a 600-meter-diameter crater, so it should have penetrated maybe 150 meters into the subfloor.
146:26:26|ALSJ||The tasks planned for Station 5 are listed on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_cdr2627.jpg"@alsjt>LMP/CDR-27</a>.
146:26:28|ALSJ||TV on. Jack is at the gate.
146:26:58|ALSJ||Jack goes to the @alsjurl/a17/a17experiment_sep_en.jpg"@alsjt>SEP receiver</a> behind his seat.
146:27:06|ALSJ||Gene goes to the gate. @alsjurl/Fendell-Bio.pdf"@alsjt>Fendell</a> starts panning counter-clockwise.
146:27:27|ALSJ||Gene comes into view, going to Jack's seat.
146:28:08|ALSJ||Fendell pans counter-clockwise past Jack, who is among the boulders west of the Rover.
146:28:31|ALSJ||Fendell pans clockwise to Jack; Gene crosses the field-of-view, carrying the brush to do the left battery covers. Fendell finds Jack making his way through a field of boulders up to 6 feet in size.
146:29:27|ALSJ||There are a great many rocks underfoot.
146:29:43|ALSJ||Jack goes to the big boulder.
146:30:19|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Bill Clancey notes with interest that Gene chose to ask Parker where to find unused bags, rather than interrupt Jack's work. Below, I have interwoven the conversation between the Flight Director and the EVA Controller with the ones between Bob and Gene and between Gene and Jack. Note that Jack, Bob, and the EVA Controller all know that there are bags under Jack's seat. Note, also, that the only voice that Gene and Jack hear from Houston is Bob's.
146:30:19|ALSJ||<b>Flight Director</b>: EVA, Flight.
146:30:23|ALSJ||<b>EVA</b>: Go, Flight.
146:30:26|ALSJ||<b>Flight Director</b>: (To EVA) He's looking for some kind of bags. (Having heard Bob and/or Jack and now asking for confirmation) Are they under the LMP's seat?
146:30:26|ALSJ||Jack turns to look toward the Rover.
146:30:30|ALSJ||<b>EVA</b>: (To Flight) They should be under the LMP's seat. Yes, sir.
146:30:31|ALSJ||<b>EVA</b>: (To Flight) (It will) be a used set from yesterday.
146:30:38|ALSJ||Jack examines several boulders around him, but without getting down to look at them closely.
146:30:50|ALSJ||Jack moves a few feet south among the boulders.
146:30:50|ALSJ|LMP|'Ophitic' - and 'subophitic' would be less strongly representative - is when the feldspar crystals are approximately the same size as the pyroxene and are only partially included in them. It looks like a mat with feldspar and pyroxene intergrown. 'Diabase' is the type of basalt that has that texture. And what I meant in the last sentence is that the rock structure is organized, that it's not a random, uniform face in that the vesicles are in planar concentrations. There were some zones with more vesicles and some zones with fewer vesicles and they were organized in planar structures. Lava flows often show that.
146:30:50|ALSJ|LMP|One characteristic of impact craters is that, when they form in layered rocks, they overturn the sequence and maintain it. You see that at Meteor Crater (Arizona) and other places where you can actually see the rim deposits. Nuclear explosion craters do the same thing. It's all ballistic and the layers just end up being overturned; so, as you walk away from the rim, you're walking upsection. That is, (as you walk away from the rim) you're going through the layers as if you were down in the bottom of the crater going up. And if there was going to be any variation, you would want to walk radial to the crater; not along the rim. Everywhere on the rim you'd find the same material from roughly the same layer.
146:32:24|ALSJ||Fendell pans clockwise to look at boulders on the rim and down into the crater.
146:33:38|ALSJ||Fendell returns to Jack, who hasn't moved since Fendell left him.
146:34:13|ALSJ|LMP|What I was trying to say was that, at Camelot, the rim thickness of mantle (the apparent depth of regolith burying boulders) was about half of what we saw at Horatio. That's the problem with talking and observing simultaneously.
146:34:46|ALSJ||Jack will take a pan from east of the Rover at about 146:49.
146:35:04|ALSJ||Gene enters the picture, stops a little west of the Rover and looks around.
146:35:23|ALSJ||Gene waves his forearm horizontally to indicate the orientation of the linearities he sees in the rock.
146:36:02|ALSJ||Jack leans on a three-foot rock.
146:36:25|ALSJ||Gene puts the gnomon down; Jack stands up.
146:36:37|ALSJ||Gene makes his way out of the boulder field to take cross-Suns from the south; Jack moves north out of the TV picture to take a cross-Sun from that direction.

146:36:37|ALSJ|LMP|I was trying to get Gene to work on a bigger boulder just to the right of where I was standing here. It was one I was looking at earlier; and he set up at a different boulder and I was afraid we were going to lose the opportunity to get the structures. This is one of the few times - that I remember, anyway - that he didn't follow the lead I was trying to get him to take on the sampling. Also, there were fractures and planes in the bigger boulder that he could have sampled without bending over.
146:36:37|ALSJ|CDR|Twenty years later, Jack's just got a better memory about some of the details of the sampling. If you had something on your mind at the time, the pictures and transcripts will tend to bring them back. And, if you didn't have them on your mind at the time, there's nothing to recall. But I do remember being in that boulder field and that you really did have to watch your step. We were hopping around between rocks and boulders and you could have tripped on even a foot-high boulder. And you definitely didn't want to fall on another rock or boulder. I won't say that it was 'precarious' but it certainly was a challenging traverse through there.
146:36:37|ALSJ|CDR|It wasn't something you could train for, because there wasn't any way to really train for the one-sixth gravity. There was a training device called the Peter Pan rig (with harnesses to simulate some aspects of one-sixth gravity) which was used early on; but I don't think I used it after Apollo 10. But, with a little common sense, you can adapt. I mean, you don't go in there dumb and blind. You know there are boulders and, by this time in the mission, you certainly knew how to get around in one-sixth gravity. If you jumped off the LM for the first time and, right away, had to walk around in this boulder field, you wouldn't have the aggressiveness - and caution - we had. You wouldn't be adapted yet to one-sixth gravity. You wouldn't know the most productive ways of getting around and you wouldn't know the pitfalls as well.
146:36:52|ALSJ||Gene gets the hammer out of his shin pocket.
146:37:05|ALSJ||Gene stands over the boulder and takes three low, nearly horizontal whacks at it.
146:37:20|ALSJ||Gene grabs the fragment with his tongs, then goes to Jack so that Jack can get a sample bag from him.
146:37:29|ALSJ||Gene raises the tongs so that Jack can take the sample.
146:37:41|ALSJ||Having examined the rock, Jack bags it. Gene dislodges another sample with three hammer blows.
146:38:01|ALSJ||Once Jack finishes closing the first sample bag, Gene presents his SCB.
146:38:40|ALSJ||Jack had taken the sample from the tongs but now can't open the sample bag. Gene takes the sample from him; Jack opens the bag; and Gene inserts the sample.
146:39:14|ALSJ||Jack drops the scoop, then asks Gene if he's finished taking the picture.
146:39:24|ALSJ||Gene's stereopair of "afters" is AS17-145-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22139"@alsjt>22139</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22140"@alsjt>22140</a>. Notice how dirty Jack's legs are. Jack uses the "step on the scoop head" retrieval trick again and Gene may have caught him in the act in the first of this pair of pictures. Gene gets the gnomon and they move away from the Rover a few feet to the chest-high, layered boulder.
146:39:52|ALSJ||Looking at them standing close together at some distance from the Rover, Jack seems by far the dirtier.
146:40:15|ALSJ||Gene takes a series of photos on an east-west line south of the boulder. His photos are AS17-145- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22141"@alsjt>22141</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22152"@alsjt>22152</a>.

146:40:53|ALSJ||Gene leans on the boulder from the south.
146:40:53|ALSJ||Gene strikes the rock ten times with the hammer: three slow and deliberate strokes, then seven quick strokes. Jack turns and takes a "locator" of the Rover. This is AS17-133-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20336"@alsjt>20336</a>.
146:41:47|ALSJ||Jack points with the scoop to the lower east face.
146:41:50|ALSJ||Gene hands Jack the hammer and takes the scoop.
146:42:00|ALSJ|CDR|The rubber grip on the hammer was made of the same material as the glove finger tips.
146:42:00|ALSJ||Jack leans on the rock, takes a half swing and knocks the sample off.
146:42:09|ALSJ||They trade hammer and scoop.
146:42:20|ALSJ||Jack gets the sample with the scoop.
146:42:43|ALSJ||Jack presents his SCB.
146:42:52|ALSJ||Jack hops toward the south. Gene takes an "after" picture (AS17-145-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22153"@alsjt>22153</a>) and then gets the scoop off of the boulder where Jack left it.

146:43:43|ALSJ||Gene picks up the gnomon and goes off-camera toward Jack.
146:43:52|ALSJ||Fendell finds them working farther south, still among the boulders. The gnomon is on the flatish rock that Jack has just described. Gene is taking cross-Sun pictures from the north. These are AS17-145-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22154"@alsjt>22154</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22155"@alsjt>22155</a>.

146:44:25|ALSJ||Using the scoop, Jack skims some soil off the rock, at about knee height. After taking a picture of Jack doing the skimming (AS17-145-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22156"@alsjt>22156</a>), Gene opens a bag.
146:44:25|ALSJ|LMP|This type of sample would enable you to decide whether dark mantle had been laid down on top of the rocks or whether that material had all just been thrown up there from the regolith surrounding it.
146:44:59|ALSJ||Jack skims another scoopful.
146:45:29|ALSJ||Jack collects a third scoopful of soil off the top of the rock.
146:46:00|ALSJ||Jack is now prying a fragment off the boulder with the scoop.
146:46:06|ALSJ||Gene puts the soil sample in Jack's SCB. Jack raises the scoop high enough that Gene can grab the fragment and bag it.
146:46:23|ALSJ||Jack moves about five feet south.

146:48:30|ALSJ||Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22165"@alsjt>22165</a> shows Jack running back to the Rover. Bear Mountain is above right-center and the East Massif dominates the left horizon. Note that @alsjurl/a17/a17pan22164-5.jpg"@alsjt>Gene did not turn to his right after taking 22164</a>, a clear indication that he saw Jack coming and decided to wait for him to come into the field-of-view. This superb picture is an intentional 'study' of Jack in motion.
146:48:30|ALSJ||Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22171"@alsjt>22171</a> shows the view to the west, with the @alsjurl/a17/a17det22171.jpg"@alsjt>sunward face of the Scarp</a> visible beyond the foreground boulders. The brightness of the Scarp face is enhanced by its covering of avalanche material.
146:48:30|ALSJ||On the foreground boulders in frame AS17-145- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22176"@alsjt>22176</a> we can see numerous small, bright, white patches of shattered minerals - primarily shattered plagioclase feldspar crystals - associated with 'zaps'.
146:49:05|ALSJ||Jack runs around the south edge of the boulder field, out onto open, flat, ground. He is moving very easily. Fendell pans to Gene who is still doing his pan.
146:50:03|ALSJ||Gene starts toward the Rover, coming directly east and picking his way between the boulders. Jack has started his @alsjurl/a17/a17.1464906_jpan.jpg"@alsjt>B&amp;W pan</a> and catches Gene making his way back to the Rover in AS17-133-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20341"@alsjt>20341</a>. In a @alsjurl/a17/a17de20341.jpg"@alsjt>detail</a>, he is visible above the seat backs. See, also, a @alsjurl/a17/a17pan20341-2.jpg"@alsjt>two-frame pan</a> made from 20341 and 42. The photos in Jack's pan are AS17-133- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20339"@alsjt>20339</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20361"@alsjt>20361</a>.
146:50:21|ALSJ||Gene turns south to get out in the open.
146:50:24|ALSJ||Gene switches from a running gait to a gallop.
146:50:24|ALSJ|LMP|Gene doesn't seem to have picked up the rolling gait that you need to have in order to use a stride rather than a hop. And that may just be because he never did any cross-country skiing. It's a fairly natural motion, I think, for a cross-country skier.
146:50:24|ALSJ|CDR|Each individual adapts in a different way, but the results are basically the same. Some guys skip; some guys hop. And you pick a way of getting around that gives you the greatest comfort and mobility and productivity. I moved around in a half-dozen different ways and found I liked the old fifth-grade skip, because I could cover eight or ten feet in the air and come down - with stability - on both feet. Boom boom and up again. That was my way of really moving across the surface without expending a lot of energy. And that's probably why, subconsciously, I went that way rather than wobbling from side to side. Subconsciously, you sought a way of getting around that gave you a sense of security and required the least amount of energy. And I got my energy out of my knees by springing up like that. You shouldn't say, rigidly, 'you have to do it in this fashion'. It's like a golf swing, to some degree. You'll find a number of good golfers with totally different swings.
146:50:40|ALSJ|CDR|I don't know where I got the song from, but it's got to be a thousand years old. Some cowboy singer or something. This was fun! My feet just got far enough apart for stability when I hit the ground and then I could spring up with both of them. I was doing a little bit of the cross-country stride in the beginning, but I wasn't doing it with strides as big as Jack's, going way left and way right like he did. You were less balanced like that than when you were skipping, so I switched.
146:50:40|ALSJ||Gene now switches to a kangaroo or bunny hop. During our review of Station 6, it occurred to Gene that a tendon injury suffered about 5 to 6 weeks before the flight may have influenced his choice of gait. See his comments at 165:59:32.
146:50:40|ALSJ|CDR|In order to stop, I had to take a couple of steps to transition from the skip to a walk. It's like a horse that's in a gallop and slows down to a trot.
146:50:53|ALSJ||In 1996, Andrew Chaikin discovered that the song Gene is singing is "Mule Train". He stumbled upon a copy of the words and music, albeit without information on the authors or publication date. The lyrics Chaikin found are:<br> Mule Train.<br> Mule Train.<br> Clippity cloppin' over hill and plain.<br> Seems as how they never stop.<br> Clippity clop,<br> Clippity clop,<br> Clippity, clippity, clippity, clippity, clippity cloppin' a long.<br><br> Journal Contributor Brian Lawrence provides a history of the song. "It was written by veteran composers Hy Heath, Johnny Lange, and Fred Glickman, published by Walt Disney, and heard in the Republic Pictures western 'Singing Guns' (1950). In 1949 there were at least four versions on the Billboard charts, by Frankie Laine, Bing Crosby, Tennessee Ernie Ford, and Vaughn Monroe - who appeared in 'Singing Guns'. Its popularity led to an Academy Award nomination, but it lost out to 'Mona Lisa'. A late addition to the record charts came from Gene Autry, who also obtained the rights to use the song as the title for one of his self-produced westerns, 'Mule Train' (1950). I don't know, but it seems likely that Autry would have used the song in his TV series, 'The Gene Autry Show' (1950-55). Therefore it may be that Gene Cernan remembered the lyrics from Gene Autry's films and TV shows." Gene Cernan was born in 1934 and was 15 when the song became popular.
146:50:53|ALSJ||Gene reaches the Rover and stows the gnomon. Fendell pans away clockwise.
146:51:10|ALSJ|LMP|It would have been nice to have had more time at Camelot, just like everywhere else. We hadn't seen much variety in the boulders we looked at and it would have been nice to go as far down the rim inside of Camelot as it was prudent to walk and then work our way - both sampling and observing - all the way to the edge of the boulder field and really see if there is any mineralogical or compositional variation. One of the hopes for the long-term future might be that these mare have stratified mineral deposits in them like the Bushveldt in South Africa and other places. It would be a ready way to get metallic resources for use on the Moon: for example, for making the teeth for any bucket-wheel miner you might have so that you don't have to keep importing those; you could just replace the teeth with ones you make on the Moon. But we just didn't have that kind of time.
146:51:10|ALSJ|LMP|Presumably, at the rim of Camelot we were sampling the deepest material that would have been thrown up out of Camelot. So maybe it was not unexpected that what we saw was fairly uniform; it would have cooled more slowly, probably, than other material we might have found. I don't think a rake sample would have added much because, again, we were dealing with pretty uniform stuff and it was just a question of what might have been thrown in there from somewhere else. And the other rake samples were already giving us that information.
146:51:10|ALSJ|CDR|It would have been nice to have more time. Time was your greatest asset because you're there at all; and it's your greatest enemy because you don't have enough of it. I would have liked to have walked down into that crater, too, and have spent some time down in the bottom. I think it could have been very interesting. It would have been a good walk out! But it would have been interesting.
146:52:23|ALSJ||When the adhesive holding patches of Velcro pile to the SEP Receiver bag failed, the patches remained mated with the hook patches on the covers.
146:52:36|ALSJ|LMP|It was a mistake when I carried the charges for long distances, primarily the charge I'd carried on the traverse to Station 1 and the one I'd carried from Shorty to Victory. And, what couldn't be rectified was that my hands were already tired.
146:52:44|ALSJ||TV off.
146:53:00|ALSJ|CDR|Jack was a little testy here. He was probably a little tired. And your hands do get tired from holding the camera and holding the bags.
146:53:03|ALSJ||Gene will be driving on an average heading of about 090 to get back to the LM, and will use a low-gain antenna pointing of 100 on the indicator. @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_cdr2829.jpg"@alsjt>LMP/CDR-28</a> is a map of this part of the traverse
146:54:13|ALSJ||Gene never did give a complete set of Rover readouts; but he parked the Rover with some noticeable pitch and roll. See his remark about Rover tilt at 146:25:25.
146:54:13|ALSJ|LMP|It must have been tilted towards me - it usually was - and that made it tougher to get on.
146:54:17|ALSJ||Jack is getting his seat belt on.
146:54:46|ALSJ|CDR|- (Tongue in cheek) "I always parked the Rover sloping towards Jack. It didn't make it tougher; it made it easier. It was lower to him and he didn't have to jump as high to get in. All he had to do was lean uphill. That was a Commander's prerogative. I particularly liked to drive on slopes with him on the downhill side.
146:55:16|ALSJ||The checklist location of Station 5 is 088/1.2. They parked very close to the planned spot and the 086/1.4 reading is the actual location relative to the SEP transmitter. Gene is looking at checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_cdr2829.jpg"@alsjt>CDR-29</a>, which indicates a planned drive of 1.4 kilometers to the LM - including some extra distance to get around the southern rim of Camelot - on an initial heading of 085. He is mistaking these numbers for the planned range and bearing to the SEP which, again, are 088/1.2.
146:55:46|ALSJ||Houston has been using Rover navigation readings at known sites, such as this southwest rim of Camelot, to estimate the landing spot.
146:56:03|ALSJ||Again, Gene is misreading his checklist.
146:56:26|ALSJ|LMP|In the final analysis, of course, it turned out that the dark mantle - the orange and black soils that we found at Shorty - were deposited from fire fountains well before - like three and a half billion years before - either Camelot or Horatio were formed. And what gave the impression of younger age is exactly what had fooled the mappers; and that is that the dark regolith is so loose and moves so much that craters don't last very long in it. It doesn't retain small craters as long as other types of regolith do, so you get a false impression of youthfulness. And when you hit it, it spreads around and produces pretty much the same effects that you'd get from true mantling.
146:56:34|ALSJ||It is also possible that, because Camelot is younger than Horatio, it may have thrown ejecta out over Horatio, helping to obscure any blocks on the rim or walls.
146:56:58|ALSJ||Gene probably started to move at 146:55:39.
146:57:20|ALSJ||They are driving along the south rim of Camelot looking at the east, inner wall of the crater. Jack's photos of the east rim and associated ejecta are AS17-133- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20363"@alsjt>20363</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20364"@alsjt>20364</a>.
147:00:51|ALSJ||In driving around craters, Gene has added 1.7 kilometers (or about 10 percent) to the straight-line, station-to-station distance. At some point during this part of the drive, Jack takes AS17-133- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20365"@alsjt>20365</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20366"@alsjt>20366</a>.
147:00:51|ALSJ|CDR|Adding a kilometer and a half or more to our projected travel distance from station to station is not too surprising. I call it the wander factor. When you're driving around, you've got to drive around craters; when you're driving up the scarp, you've got to take particular routes which are accessible and secure; and, when you're driving into the Sun, you've got to be extremely careful and you go around things you might not, otherwise, go around because you can't see them all that well. So it's not that surprising at all.
147:01:00|ALSJ||Jack is asking about the place where they will deploy the charge.
147:01:03|ALSJ||Gene's "oh-point-four" isn't very clear.
147:01:35|ALSJ||This is a pennant affixed to the antenna on charge they deployed at the start of the traverse - at 083/0.5. Neither Jack nor Gene remembers why they called it "the Italian Flag". Like the flags on all the charges, it was international orange in color.
147:01:53|ALSJ|LMP|During the design phase there was probably some discussion over whether one really needed the flags. And the reference to the "Boss" may mean that Shepard or Slayton finally ruled that there had to be flags. I think that Gene did see the box first; and then we corrected the record, facetiously, so that it was consistent with what the Boss said we had to see first, namely the flag. Of course, I'm guessing and making this up, because I don't remember this incident.
147:01:53|ALSJ||Gene doesn't remember the incident either, but suggests that the "Italian Flag" may have had something to do with Rocco Petrone, the Apollo Program Director at the time. Neither Shepard nor Slayton, nor Joe Allen was able to offer any insight. Bob Parker agrees with Gene that there may be a connection with Petrone. He remembers that, because of sensitivities about the Vietnam war, Petrone had insisted that the charges not be called 'bombs'.
147:02:09|ALSJ||See Gene's comment at 141:36:27 about having to turn right to avoid the charges. Photo AS17-133- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20367"@alsjt>20367</a> is taken toward the north, perhaps as Gene maneuvers so that Jack can deploy the charge.
147:02:25|ALSJ||This chance remark probably triggers Jack's decision to get a glass sample as described at 147:19:46.
147:02:47|ALSJ||Jack has been watching the indicator and, since the digit just changed, they are about 350 meters from the SEP transmitter - plus or minus a residual Nav system error of about 50 meters or so. The actual distance is 440 meters, an indication of the superb performance of the navigation system over a closed, 30-kilometer course.
147:03:14|ALSJ||These picture are included in the @alsjurl/a17/a17.1470314_trv.jpg"@alsjt>series</a> AS17-133- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20368"@alsjt>20368</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20373"@alsjt>20373</a> which Jack took prior to the charge deployment.
147:04:21|ALSJ||Gene is taking a picture of the charge with the LM in the background. This is AS17-145- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22184"@alsjt>22184</a>.
147:04:21|ALSJ||Jack's last two pictures are AS17-133- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20374"@alsjt>20374</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20375"@alsjt>20375</a>.
147:04:48|ALSJ||Here, Jack is referring to the LSG, the gravity-wave detector.
147:05:17|ALSJ||Gene probably is driving in toward the Central Station from the southwest, coming between the south and west geophone lines. Then, on his way to the LM, he will have to go all the way back out and around the south geophone line to avoid running over it.
147:06:23|ALSJ||They have two Universal Handling Tools. They are using one as the handle for the @alsjurl/tools/judy80.gif"@alsjt>LRV Sampler</a>; Gene tossed the other one in the general direction of the Central Station at the end of the ALSEP deployment.
147:06:38|ALSJ||There are two pairs of tongs. Gene is wearing one, attached to his yo-yo, and the other is almost certainly stowed in the tool rack on the back of the Rover.
147:06:41|ALSJ||As Gene confirms at 147:07:38, Jack is taking Gene's tongs and camera so that, as Jack relates at 147:20:13, he can collect a sample of glass on his way back to the LM.
147:07:23|ALSJ||Again, Jack is planning to get a glass sample but isn't telling Houston.
147:07:27|ALSJ|LMP|I may have been pulling out Gene's yo-yo and taking the tongs off so that he didn't have to fool with it. It would have been easier that way.
147:07:27|ALSJ||This would suggest that Jack moved around to Gene's side of the Rover. Alternatively, he could have stayed at his side of the Rover while Gene removed the tongs from his yo-yo and handed them across. Gene's "can you reach them?" suggests the latter.
147:07:52|ALSJ||Jack got a warning tone at 147:05:46 that his primary cooling water supply had run out and that he needed to @alsjurl/alsj-ValveCluster.html"@alsjt>switch to his auxillary tank</a>. He made the switch at that time and, as Parker suggests, this repetition of the tone may a sign that there was a momentary interruption of flow after the switchover.
147:08:00|ALSJ||Jack probably has moved away from the Rover by now, on his way to get the UHT. The following dialog suggests that the top of Jack's @alsjurl/alsj-RCU.html"@alsjt>RCU</a> is covered with dust.
147:08:09|ALSJ||Gene will look for a warning flag on Jack's @alsjurl/alsj-RCU.html"@alsjt>RCU</a>.
147:08:27|ALSJ||Gene hasn't dismounted and Jack is probably standing beside him.
147:09:00|ALSJ|LMP|When you switched to the Aux tank, it took a little while for either the flow of water or the water pressure - whichever the sensor worked on - to build up enough to get rid of the flag.
147:09:41|ALSJ|LMP|I was joking, of course; and I think this refers to some time in training when I accidentally kicked it.
147:09:41|ALSJ||Bob agrees that this is a training reference.
147:11:01|ALSJ||Bob is referring to the "sticky level bubble" Jack encountered on the Central Station at 119:38:02 and again at 119:55:35 and following. In that case, surface tension had kept the bubble stuck to the outside of its dome.
147:11:06|ALSJ|LMP|They wanted me to press the legs into the surface. I suspect that, by this time, Joe Weber was absolutely panicked about his experiment. And there was a tendency, if I remember correctly, for me to think that they were convinced that I hadn't deployed it right, instead of suspecting that the instrument was faulty. Clearly, Bob was on our side and believed we'd done it right.
147:12:04|ALSJ|LMP|I could see the gimbal by looking through the top of the instrument. I don't know why I said 'gimbal' because I was probably looking at the balance beam.
147:12:23|ALSJ|LMP|Getting off the Rover shouldn't have made Gene breathe heavily. He may have gotten off and leaned way over to read the console. That might have cramped him a little bit and made him spit his words out.
147:12:23|ALSJ||Gene is reading a bearing of 089 to the SEP and a range of 150 to 250 meters. The actual values are about 080 and 150, indicating a very small residual error.
147:13:07|ALSJ|LMP|There was a sunshade on the LSG that shadowed the hole in the top of the instrument that let it cool by radiating to the sky. Twenty degrees refers to our latitude and I guess I had to get the LSG leveled and then tilt the shade at the proper angle. It's amazing how you don't remember doing any of that. I remember going back to fix it, but not the actual deployment.
147:14:00|ALSJ|LMP|They were moving weights on the balance beam and my question was, could we do something to change the relative gravitational force on either side of the fulcrum to make it work. But I don't think they could have ever convinced themselves that it was a design problem in time to do something like that.
147:15:00|ALSJ||TV on.
147:15:48|ALSJ||Gene is dusting the right-side battery covers as per @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_cdr3031.jpg"@alsjt>CDR-31</a>. Normally, he and Jack would have taken care of the SCBs before the dusting but, since Jack is out at the ALSEP, Gene is taking care of the tasks that don't require Jack's presence. @alsjurl/a17/Fendell-Bio.pdf"@alsjt>Fendell</a> pans away.
147:15:57|ALSJ||Bob probably should have made sure Gene was in position to look at the SEP bag before starting this discussion.
147:15:57|ALSJ||The @alsjurl/a17/a17experiment_sep_en.jpg"@alsjt>SEP</a> receiver rides on the Rover just behind Jack's seat, protected from sunlight and dust by a thermal bag. The receiver - like the TV camera and the LCRU - has a mirror on its top surface which allows the unit to cool. As indicated in @alsjurl/a17/a17mrf15-20.jpg"@alsjt>Figure 15-20</a> from the Mission Report ( @alsjurl/a17/a17mr.html"@alsjt>26 Mb PDF</a> ), the top of the thermal bag consists of a pair of flaps held down by strips of Velcro attached to the undersides of the flaps and to the front of the bag. There are also pieces of Velcro designed to hold the covers open; in the drawing, this pair of patches can be seen on either side of the hinge of the closed cover. Finally, there are pieces of Velcro holding the back of the bag closed, one on the metal(?) case of the receiver and one on the inside of the bag. These are not shown in the drawing. At 123:17:10 at the end of the first EVA, Jack noticed that the Velcro pads glued to the front of the bag had de-bonded, allowing the cover to flap open. At the start of EVA-2, Jack suggested taping the cover but no decision was made to do so. Gene has been trying to keep the mirror clean but, even after cleaning, enough dust remains adhered that the SEP temperature is unacceptably high. Houston will have him tape the cover at 164:01:01. Because the LCRU and the TV camera are still working well, one obvious conclusion is that the SEP equipment is too sensitive to heat. One note of interest about this failure is the fact that, on Apollo 16, there was an adhesive failure on a Velcro patch on a padded sample bag, albeit a failure involving a different adhesive. No corrective action was taken because the padded bags were not going to be flown again; however, it does not appear that the failure modes of other adhesives were re-examined.
147:16:47|ALSJ||Gene is referring to the Velcro which holds the covers open, not to the pieces Bob is referring to that hold the back of the bag closed.
147:17:03|ALSJ||Fendell finds Gene leaning over the SEP.
147:17:34|ALSJ||Gene is uncharacteristically annoyed.
147:18:14|ALSJ||Gene dusts the SEP cover with the dustbrush.
147:18:50|ALSJ||Gene finishes dusting the SEP, then dusts the TCU. Fendell pans away counter-clockwise.
147:20:13|ALSJ||Jack borrowed Gene's camera when he got off the Rover at the LSG at 147:06:40. The "locator" to the LM is AS17-145- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22185"@alsjt>22185</a>. Note that this crater is down in the swale between the LM and the ALSEP. Jack's up-Sun stereopair is @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22186"@alsjt>22186</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22187"@alsjt>22187</a>; and his cross-Sun stereopair is @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22188"@alsjt>22188</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22189"@alsjt>22189</a>. He also shot a cross-Sun stereopair of "afters", which are @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22190"@alsjt>22190</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22191"@alsjt>22191</a>.
147:20:13|ALSJ|LMP|There's a little bell ringing in my head that I'd taken Gene's camera and tongs (at 147:06:41) just so that I could sample one of the glass-lined craters. That's probably why I didn't pay any attention to Bob when he told me to leave the camera with Gene.
147:20:16|ALSJ|LMP|Throughout training, I had used the pun 'gnomon is not an island', and Bob was one-upping me here.
147:20:33|ALSJ||Gene goes to dust the left side battery covers.
147:21:20|ALSJ||Fendell tilts the TV up. Jack is beyond Gene, so we don't get to see much of the SCB removal.
147:21:23|ALSJ||There is laughter in Houston.
147:21:38|ALSJ||Jack is having trouble removing Gene's SCB.
147:21:45|ALSJ||One end of the Velcro strap is sewn on to the bottom of the PLSS. There is a Velcro patch on that end, and a complementary patch of the free end. The free end of the strap can be secured, out of the way, by pressing those two patches together. After finishing, Jack goes to the Rover gate.
147:22:06|ALSJ||Gene moves toward the front of the Rover. Fendell pans clockwise to follow him.
147:22:32|ALSJ||Gene is doing something at the front of the Rover, then moves away. Fendell continues to pan clockwise.
147:22:39|ALSJ||They're not wearing the SCBs called for in the checklist.
147:23:21|ALSJ||Fendell passes Jack at his seat, Gene at the gate, and then pans up to Earth.
147:23:45|ALSJ||The reference to "volatiles" means that the Backroom is considering the possibility that the Station 4 orange soil is a product of recent volcanism. In essence, they want all of the Station 4 samples in the SRC in case volcanic gases remain adhered. Presumably, the Station 3 drive tubes - which will also go in the SRC, will provide a control. SCB-4 is the one Jack donned at Station 2 and was wearing at Shorty. Because Jack was sampling and Gene was bagging, the Shorty trench samples are in SCB-4.
147:25:17|ALSJ||Fendell returns to Jack at his seat. Gene is behind him, out of sight, at the MESA.
147:26:09|ALSJ||Jack takes SCB-5 to the MESA.
147:26:57|ALSJ||Jack goes to his seat. He is wearing Gene's tongs on a yo-yo, which he seems to have been wearing as a contingency, even though he hadn't planned on using it.
147:26:57|ALSJ|CDR|The yo-yo was about an inch or two high, a rectangular box, and it had a little strap that went under something (usually a hose) and came back around and snapped on itself. I wore mine all the time, so Jack must have been wearing one, too.
147:27:27|ALSJ||Jack pours samples out of an SCB into his footpan. He then grabs the tongs and picks up an unbagged rock that he may have just dropped. He puts the rock in an unseen SCB on his seat.
147:28:11|ALSJ||Jack takes the glass sample to the MESA.
147:28:35|ALSJ|LMP|I must have known - and this changes what I've said before about the observation of glass in craters on other missions - because I talked to the people doing remnant magnetism and asked them it they didn't want an oriented sample of glass in order to see if there had been any modern magnetic fields. And I don't remember their having any enthusiasm for it; but, in my mind, that was a reasonably important sample to get. And that's probably why I was manipulating things to get a sample and all the documentary photographs and why I had some concern over protecting it.
147:28:40|ALSJ||Jack takes SCB-4 to the Rover. Fendell stays with Gene at the MESA.
147:29:02|ALSJ||Gene is taking sample bags out of the SCB and is putting them in the SRC, the rock box.
147:29:20|ALSJ|LMP|There was a brand of pills called Carter's Little Liver Pills, and there was an expression 'You've got more of such-and-such than Carter has pills.'
147:29:33|ALSJ||Gene discards the SRC seal protector.
147:29:39|ALSJ|LMP|Bob thought he'd seen Gene throw SCB-4 to his left, not having noticed that I'd taken SCB-4 back to the Rover.
147:30:03|ALSJ||Jack, who has been at the gate, goes to his seat carrying an SCB.
147:30:55|ALSJ||Jack now picks up samples from his footpan and puts them in SCB-6.
147:31:08|ALSJ||During the EVA-1 Rover preps (checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17.eva1_lmp12.gif"@alsjt>LMP-12</a>), Jack had the option of deploying the cosmic ray experiment if he had time - and did so at 118:34:41. For the EVA-2 close-out, Gene's checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_cdr3031.jpg"@alsjt>CDR-30</a> indicates cosmic ray deployment unless Jack had already done it.
147:31:27|ALSJ||Gene may be referring to the large sample collected at Station 5 at 146:42.
147:31:39|ALSJ||Gene, at the Rover, dumps the contents of SCB-5 into SCB-6.
147:32:06|ALSJ|CDR|The latches were starting to stick, so I was just going to dust them to see if that would help. Jack's comment, it seems to me, was that, in a pressure suit, you can sometimes apply more force than you would normally intend to. You're not outfitted to be a brain surgeon with tweezers. So the tendency to grab hold of something and pull harder than you might want to was a real danger; and what Jack was saying was that he didn't want to pull the latches off.
147:32:06|ALSJ|LMP|You're putting pressure on the suit bladder whenever you open something, and you want to be careful. I think this is what scared a lot of us about what Scott and Irwin were doing on 15 when they were trying to get the deep core out. They got away with it; except Scott wrenched his shoulder. He's a moose anyway, but that shows you how much force they were putting on it.
147:32:06|ALSJ|CDR|Until this very moment, reading Jack's comment, it never crossed my mind that you could hurt the suit. I never had any concern about it. I had experience with suits going back to my Gemini IX EVA and the only problem was that you didn't have the feel. You could squeeze too hard or pull too quickly because you didn't have the feel - the sensitivity - in your arms and hands of whatever you were holding on to. But as far as heavy movements, like trying to get core samples out of the ground, and putting stress on the bladder, I'd never heard of that.
147:32:49|ALSJ||Jack takes SCBs 6 and 8 to the ladder so that he can put them on the LM footpad. One of them is partially open. As he pulls the SCBs out of his Rover footpan, he turns to his right so that he doesn't have to lift the bags very high.
147:32:49|ALSJ|LMP|I can't tell you why I was going sideways here, unless it was just the way I got started. A little overshoot on my rotation.
147:32:49|ALSJ|CDR|When I was working around the MESA, there were a lot of times when I wanted, for example, to move five feet to the left, that I did not turn left and start walking straight on. I'd just slither sideways. Those were not planned maneuvers. You just do what that computer up in your head tells you to do that's most productive, safe, responsive way to make a move.
147:32:57|ALSJ||Houston never had any suggestions about the locks.
147:33:19|ALSJ|CDR|Bob got out of this one by saying "John thought that they might still be open"; and Jack came back very nicely. If Bob had said "Jack, I thought maybe you had left them open", I guarantee you that Jack would have come back with some remark to Bob. That's just the way it went. Those guys could go after each other in a very sarcastic manner sometimes.
147:33:35|ALSJ||Jack stows the maps under his seat.
147:33:50|ALSJ||Jack takes the Rover sample bag (an SCB) from the hook on the accessory staff where it normally hangs and shows his TV audience just how empty it is.
147:34:05|ALSJ||That is, they can put samples under the seats.
147:34:14|ALSJ||Jack takes the sample bags out of the holder.
147:34:22|ALSJ||Jack opens his shin pocket, puts bag holder in the pocket, and closes the pocket cover.
147:34:28|ALSJ||Jack puts the sample bags under his seat.
147:35:00|ALSJ|CDR|I brought the whole fender home!
147:35:00|ALSJ||The replacement fender is on display at the National Air &amp; Space Museum in Washington, D.C. Ron Creel has provided a summary ( @alsjurl/LRV_Fender_Extensions.pdf"@alsjt>1.3 Mb PDF</a> ) of the fender extension losses that occurred on all three Rover missions.
147:35:11|ALSJ||Jack closes the seat.
147:35:33|ALSJ||He is on checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_lmp29b.gif"@alsjt>LMP-29</a>.
147:35:42|ALSJ||As is discussed at 118:35:03, deployment of the cosmic ray could have come then or now. Having had a spare moment after the flag deployment, Jack set out the cosmic ray experiment at that point in EVA-1.
147:36:00|ALSJ||Bob Parker was a member of the Astronomy Department faculty at the University of Wisconsin before joining the astronaut corps.
147:36:09|ALSJ||Jack is referring to a rock he collected east of the LM during the Rover preps at @alsjurl/a17/a17.alsepoff.html#1183110"@alsjt>118:31:10</a>. Shortly thereafter, he put it in the big bag but then, at @alsjurl/a17/a17.clsout1.html#1234007"@alsjt>123:40:07</a> during the EVa-1 close-out, couldn't find it.
147:36:18|ALSJ||Gene returns to the Rover.
147:36:21|ALSJ||Gene called out the polarization filter when he checked under his seat at 141:20:35 to make sure (as per checklist) that Jack had transferred the filter from the ETB during the Rover preps. They were to have taken pictures at Shorty with the filter on Jack's camera but the activity was dropped without remark because of the discovery of the orange soil.
147:36:42|ALSJ||This item is on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_cdr3031.jpg"@alsjt>CDR-31</a>. The fact that they are getting everything done - albeit in almost random order - is a testament to this crew's thoroughness and to their training. They know what needs to be done and why and know how to use the checklist as an effective tool. On Apollo 12, Pete Conrad had some occasional difficulties because he relied too much on his memory and, at the other extreme, one can imagine people using a checklist as a crutch, as a means of covering up inadequate preparation. Here, Cernan and Schmitt are using the checklists - and Houston - to help them make sure that everything gets done, but aren't getting flustered or confused because they are having to do things out of order.
147:37:14|ALSJ||Gene gets the 500-mm camera. Jack is on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_lmp30.gif"@alsjt>LMP-30</a> and Gene is waiting to finish the last few items on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_cdr3031.jpg"@alsjt>CDR-31</a>.
147:37:14|ALSJ||Gene raises the 500-mm camera to his face plate so that he can use the boresight mounted on the lens barrel as he photographs the South Massif. He takes a @alsjurl/a17/a17pan1473733LR.jpg"@alsjt>left-to-right sequence</a> consisting of AS17-144- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22080"@alsjt>22080</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22093"@alsjt>22093</a> and a @alsjurl/a17/a17pan1473733RL.jpg"@alsjt>right-to-left sequence</a> consisting of AS17-144- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22094"@alsjt>22094</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22104"@alsjt>22104</a>.
147:37:14|ALSJ||Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22090"@alsjt>22090</a> is a good picture of the most notable outcrop.
147:37:14|ALSJ|CDR|The boresight was just like a little magnifying glass and you could see rainbow-rings inside of it as you looked through it.
147:38:21|ALSJ||As can be seen in the TV, the lens cap is hanging free, attached to the barrel of the lens with a strap. After finishing a sequence of South Massif photos, Gene takes a @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22105-32"@alsjt>portrait of the North Massif</a>, taking three sequences of the summit area and finishing up with a sequence across the face of the mountain, starting to the left of the large boulder track. The images are AS17-144- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22105"@alsjt>22105</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22132"@alsjt>22132</a>.
147:38:21|ALSJ||Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22129"@alsjt>22129</a> shows the boulder track.
147:38:32|ALSJ||Needless to say, Gene can hear Bob perfectly well. The humor here is exceedingly dry.
147:39:14|ALSJ|LMP|I may have been trying to get Gene to take an over-exposed picture into the shadowed areas on the Sculptured Hills.
147:39:45|ALSJ||Many of the Apollo 16 500-mm pictures were badly smeared.
147:39:45|ALSJ||Gene finishes with the 500 and puts the lens cap back on.
147:40:19|ALSJ||Jack will expose two more frames before removing the film magazine and inserting the @alsjurl/alsj-DarkSlide.html"@alsjt>dark slide</a>.
147:40:33|ALSJ|CDR|Whether you're working in a pressurized suit or working in shirtsleeves, if I had to pick between zero gravity, one-sixth gravity, or full Earth gravity, in every case I'd pick one-sixth. Sometimes you'd have trouble getting as much leverage as you can on Earth; but, otherwise, one-sixth gravity makes things easier. The pressure suit, on the other hand, is a big inhibitant, particularly in restricting your dexterity. You can make the big movement and turn around and get from here to there with a step or a hop. But the things that get to you and the things that get frustrating are the little things that you can't do with you're fingers, things that you can't do with your hands. In a pressure suit, particularly from your elbows on down, you're a big, clumsy ox. You had the blue @alsjurl/apollo.glossary.html#RTV"@alsjt>RTV</a> on the fingers of the glove and, to pull the breakers, you had to force your fingers in there to get some fingertip dexterity and control through those gloves. It was just a very difficult thing to do. These were little, round, aircraft-type breakers rather than household breakers. The top of the breaker was no bigger across than the top of a pen - a half centimeter across. It was a little cylindrical breaker with a lip on it. We built them with a little more room so that you could grab onto them but, when they were pushed in they were only about a centimeter tall. They had to be set pretty tight, and it was hard to get a grip. And, besides, our hands were tired by this time.
147:40:40|ALSJ|CDR|These were @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#a17CDR_scissors"@alsjt>surgical scissors</a> with the rounded point, and they were the most common instrument in spaceflight.
147:40:55|ALSJ||This is the magazine off the 500-mm camera, which Jack is now putting in the ETB.
147:41:46|ALSJ||Houston wants to minimize the area exposed to the Sun and get maximum cooling through the rest period. Gene is on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_cdr3031.jpg"@alsjt>CDR-31</a>.
147:41:57|ALSJ||Gene points the TV camera in a generally westward direction and down toward the Rover seats.
147:42:06|ALSJ||TV off.
147:43:05|ALSJ|CDR|From the tone of voice, you can hear that we were pretty tired. 'God damn it, let's get on with the show and stop screwing around.' You can hear the fatigue in our voices.
147:43:29|ALSJ||Don McMillan has provided an animation ( @alsjurl/VLRV-covers.mov"@alsjt>0.8 Mb</a> ) of the battery covers on his Virtual Rover being opened.
147:45:39|ALSJ||TV on.
147:46:09|ALSJ||TV off.
147:48:44|ALSJ||They both laugh. Apparently, Jack has decided to take one or more of the SCBs up to the porch.
147:48:50|ALSJ||It's hard to get up the ladder because he's carrying a heavy SCB.
147:49:13|ALSJ|LMP|What would explain the two sets of tongs is that I had Gene's from when he let me off at the ALSEP and, sometime during the close-out, he took the others off the gate for some purpose. And it could be he just did it to have them in case he dropped something.
147:50:12|ALSJ||The Sun moves very slowly in the lunar sky, and shadows move only about 12 degrees in 24 hours.
147:51:09|ALSJ||At 147:59:32, Gene will give Bob a gravimeter reading. On every other occasion, Gene gave Bob a mark when he started the measurement, but not this time. The preceding statement suggests that, at this point, he has already punched the Grav button.
147:51:34|ALSJ|LMP|This is a play on words. I meant that finding the orange soil was a lucky break.
147:51:45|ALSJ||Jack is trying to brush Gene because, because of the stiffness of the suit and his general tiredness, what he is actually doing is hitting Gene.
147:51:55|ALSJ|LMP|I was referring to the 'intimate' nature of this part of the dusting operation.
147:52:38|ALSJ|LMP|I suspect that what I started to say was that he'd been throwing dust on our suits when he made sharp turns.
147:52:59|ALSJ||Gene is referring to the lamps clamps from the LM cabin that they used to fasten the new fender to the Rover. He is wondering if he'll need to take one or both up to the cabin after EVA-3.
147:53:42|ALSJ||Jack means Gene's @alsjurl/alsj-RCU.html"@alsjt>RCU</a>.
147:53:59|ALSJ||That is, Gene's right arm which, being inboard on the Rover, doesn't get sprayed with as much dust.
147:54:04|ALSJ||Gene is referring to his fall at the end of the Scarp Gravimeter stop as he tried to mount the Rover.
147:54:13|ALSJ|CDR|Dusting was a major process. By now, we've already spent 5 minutes dusting.
147:54:48|ALSJ||Jack fell several times at Station 3, now known as Ballet Crater because of his performance.
147:55:20|ALSJ|CDR| (Laughing) I just read this and said to myself, 'Now what's the worst thing that could happen.' It's dropping the brush in the dust. So I'm sure that that's what happened. It's just like with the hammer. You've got to hold on tight. And when you brushed, you had to brush hard. Your hands are tired, so you drop it. I'm positive I dropped the dustbrush.
147:55:34|ALSJ||Jack is offering himself for Gene to hold onto as he bends to retrieve the brush.
147:55:34|ALSJ|LMP|I can remember that, by the time I finished trying to dust Gene, that was it for my hands. My fingers and forearms were so fatigued that it was really hard to do anything useful in the dusting operation, because you just couldn't stroke without losing your grip on the brush. There was some pain under your nails because they had lifted off the quick, but mainly you were just fatigued and holding that brush was just the last straw. Gene didn't talk about it as much as I did; but sometimes, in listening to this, you get the impression that his hands were just as sore. That's probably why Gene dropped the brush. And the fatigue was the reason why I switched to just banging on his suit with the brush: it was easier hitting him than trying to brush. And that's when he complained. I can't believe that he felt it; but, apparently, he did.
147:55:34|ALSJ||NASA photo @alsjurl/a17/ap17-S72-56081.jpg"@alsjt>S72-56081</a> shows the crew preparing to cut a cake aboard the recovery carrier, Ticonderoga. Note the blood under the nails of Jack's middle and ring fingers.
147:56:27|ALSJ||Among its many advantages, the Rover delivers two relatively rested astronauts to each of the geology station. The only fatigue that the Rover ride didn't help with very much was the forearm and finger fatigue, particularly for Jack when he had to carry one of the charges.
147:57:11|ALSJ|CDR|This didn't mean that lightning was going to strike in ten minutes. If there was something to do and I had to stay out there ten or fifteen minutes longer, I still would have been very comfortable. I knew our margins were very, very conservative and I never had a concern about running out of consumables or having to scramble to get in. It wasn't like the margins we had for fuel to land the LM which you could eat up very quickly. Sometimes we were pushed up against Houston's limits on consumables but, in reality, it was never even close.
147:57:21|ALSJ||They've spent 6 1/2 minutes dusting, and will still take a lot of dust into the cabin.
147:57:22|ALSJ||Bob is referring to the antennas on the top of the OPSs which need to be put in the stow position before they crawl through the hatch. On Apollo 15, Scott and Irwin forgot to stow Irwin's @alsjurl/alsj-PLSSOPSantenna.html"@alsjt>(PLSS/OPS) antenna</a>, which then broke off.
147:57:24|ALSJ||This is the EVA pallet which contains replacement PLSS batteries and LiOH canisters, and food. Jack is now at the top of @alsjurl/a17/a17eva2_lmp32.gif"@alsjt>LMP-32</a>.
147:59:32|ALSJ||This measurement is listed in the Apollo 17 Preliminary Science report, albeit without a starting time. Because the experimenters took this to be a valid measurement, we can conclude that Gene pushed the Grav button without giving Bob a mark. At 147:42:54 Gene noted that he hadn't started the gravimeter measurement and, between then and now, there is only one statement (at 147:51:09) which can be interpreted to indicate that a measurement had been initiated.
148:00:56|ALSJ||The S-IVB is the top stage of the Saturn V that boosted them out of Earth orbit for the trip to the Moon.
148:01:14|ALSJ||Four minutes have elapsed since Bob told them they had ten minutes to get the hatch closed.
148:01:14|ALSJ|LMP|It seems from listening to the tapes that we never showed any concern whatsoever about ten minutes to go or any other limitation on getting in; and I suspect it's not only that we had certain things we had to get done but, also, we assumed - and which was correct, I think - that there were significant margins in the oxygen and coolant supply.
148:01:14|ALSJ||Table 9-II gives EMU consumable status for EVAs @alsjurl/a17/a17mrp9-6.jpg"@alsjt>1, 2</a>, and @alsjurl/a17/a17mrp9-7.jpg"@alsjt>3</a>. Both Jack and Gene will consistently use more oxygen and cooling water than predicted pre-flight, but will end each EVA with some margin left.
148:01:14|ALSJ||During this EVA they have used about 75% of their oxygen and battery power and 80% percent of their feedwater. On EVA-1, they went to 90% of their feedwater and will do so again on the third EVA. At 90%, they still have 45 minutes of cooling water left.
148:01:27|ALSJ||Carrying the rock box, Gene only has one hand free to grab the ladder as he jumps up to the first rung.
148:01:32|ALSJ||Captain America is a Marvel Comics character who first appeared in March 1941. Publication of the series ended in 1949, had a brief revival in 1953. Captain America had a second revivial in 1964 and, as of late 2005, was still in publication.
148:02:12|ALSJ||Gene and Jack got up on this day at 1:30 p.m., Houston time - a fashionably decadent hour.
148:02:31|ALSJ||This is a release pin on the EVA pallet.
148:02:35|ALSJ||The EVA won't be over until cabin pressure reaches 3.5 psi.
148:04:23|ALSJ|LMP|In training, when we went through these procedures, Gene didn't have anything to do. Somebody else handed me the pallet and I went through it, dutifully, simulating unloading and stowing material off the pallet. And, once or twice, we probably did it with the real hardware in the real LM, just to make sure it worked.
148:04:31|ALSJ||Jack is pushing the empty pallet out through the hatch with his foot.
148:04:32|ALSJ||Gene has tossed the pallet down to the surface.
148:04:58|ALSJ||Gene may not have pushed the SCB far enough through the hatch for Jack to get it easily. Alternatively, it may have been tipped over.
148:04:58|ALSJ|LMP|It was hard to lean down to get the things Gene's was handing in.
148:06:13|ALSJ|LMP|I may have stuck the SCBs and the rock box on their storage rails to make room for Gene. Either that or I stuck them on the engine cover.
148:06:13|ALSJ|CDR|I'll bet a million dollars that he wasn't stowing those things in the rack until we got into soft suits. It took too much time. The hatch had to go quite a ways open for me to get in so there wasn't much room under his feet, so I've got to believe that he stowed them on the engine cover.
148:06:46|ALSJ||As he had at the end of EVA-1, Jack had the hatch fully open while he was getting the SCBs and other gear stowed. Now, in order to let Gene get in, he has to stand on Gene's side of the spacecraft and swing the hatch closed far enough that he can get over to his side of the spacecraft. He will then open the door against his legs so that Gene can crawl in.
148:07:43|ALSJ||There is very little room in the LM for two suited astronauts.
148:08:14|ALSJ||They will now use the Post-EVA cue card. The items listed there are also listed on @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf5-1.jpg"@alsjt>Surface 5-1</a>.
148:08:26|ALSJ||That is, turn each other's feedwater off.
148:08:36|ALSJ||The PLSS controls are on the bottom, right, front corner. There are actually three controls, each with a very different shape so that they can be distinguished by feel. The outer control is a two bladed nylon lever that controls the PLSS feedwater diverter valve and, therefore, the amount of cooling. Inboard of the diverter valve are two other levers, one to turn on the primary feed and the other to turn on the Aux tank. One is a flat blade and the other is a rod.
148:08:48|ALSJ|CDR|It was just incredible in there with two guys in pressurized suits, plus all the stuff on the engine cover. It was just very difficult even to reach behind him.
148:10:00|ALSJ||They hear Bob but don't respond.
148:10:25|ALSJ||That way, Gene might be able to lift his arm behind Jack's PLSS and reach the valve.
148:11:02|ALSJ||Gene is facing inboard and needs to turn left and face more forward so that he can get his arm down behind Jack to get the valve.
148:11:19|ALSJ||The sound of the cabin filling with oxygen can be heard. The alarm and warning lights are expected because, when the Repress circuit breaker is closed, the system detects that the cabin is unpressurized.
148:12:08|ALSJ||The EVA is over after 7 hours, 37 minutes, 22 seconds.
148:12:27|ALSJ||They are verifying that all of the LM circuit breakers marked in the checklist with white dots are in the open position.
148:12:31|ALSJ||That is, he can remove the purge valve to depressurize the suit if the regulator hasn't done the job.
148:12:40|ALSJ||Some of the switches are marked with "EVA" decals to indicate the proper settings.
148:13:10|ALSJ||They are turning on a pair of fans which circulate oxygen through the ECS Suit Circuit.
148:13:13|ALSJ||And, now, they are turning on a sensor which responds to the pressure difference across the fans.
148:13:49|ALSJ|LMP|Gene doesn't sound as tired as after the first EVA, but he's eager to get the gloves off. I'm sure I was tired, in part because our last stop, at Camelot, was a little tougher, physically, than some of the others because of walking through the boulders.
148:13:49|ALSJ|CDR|These were like golf gloves with no fingers. We wore them to protect the suit gloves against abrasion. They really took a beating. They weren't falling apart, but they were pretty well worn.
148:13:49|ALSJ||They will take the gloves off during Rover preps on EVA-3. Gene will put his in his thigh pocket and will bring them back to Earth. They are currently in the collection of the Kansas Cosmosphere in Hutchinson, Kansas.
148:14:22|ALSJ|LMP|I think we had planned to take the cover gloves off after the ALSEP deployment because that was supposedly the major wear. But, it would seem to me that it would have been imprudent to take them off given the way they were wearing. We were pretty active - we were doing lots of stuff - and, every time you gripped something, you were abrading the cover glove with that soil. Gene's wore more quickly than mine because of the brushing and the hammering. Of course, the cover gloves made your hand's bulky. It's just like being out on the snow. The more you put on your fingers, the less mobility you have with them. The fingers are separated and the extra layers cramp you when you try to bend them. The cover gloves probably contributed to our fatigue, and they certainly affected dexterity.
148:15:33|ALSJ|LMP|It's hard to tell what was going on here, although it may have had to do with lock rings on Gene's gloves. As I recall, you pressed in on the ring and then turned. It was easy to do for yourself - when your hands weren't tired - but then you had to reverse your mind when you were doing it for somebody else, like tying somebody else's necktie.
148:15:33|ALSJ|CDR|I think there were arrows on the rings. And I do think that that is what we were doing: helping each other because it was cumbersome to unlock your own glove with a gloved hand. Once you got one off, the other one was a piece of cake to get off with your bare hand. By helping the other guy, rather than have him stretch and try to get the ring between his thumb and finger, you could take two hands and push in on the locks with your thumbs and turn the ring.
148:16:50|ALSJ|LMP|Boy, this is a classic of a discussion between two people who are looking at what they're doing and not communicating with anybody else. Maybe this was the glove lock rings.
148:16:50|ALSJ||In February 1994, I examined an Apollo suit being prepared for public display at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. Operation of the wrist ring requires pushing, simultaneously, a pair of tabs toward the glove fingers and then, while holding the tabs in place, rotating the wrist ring to unlock it. The tabs are separated by about 2 or 3 inches and, at least on an old, worn suit - John Young's Command Module Pilot suit from Apollo 10 - that hadn't been lubricated in a long time, the wrist rings were quite difficult to unlock, even with bare hands. New, well lubricated wrist rings are, according to the dialog, easy for a trained, rested person to operate. However, here, we have two tired astronauts who are also having to contend with equipment that has probably become at least a little fouled with dust.
148:17:03|ALSJ|CDR|By the time the mission was all over, my hands were nothing but blisters. The skin on my knuckles was gone. Inside the glove, all the knuckle points were constantly scrapping and, although they hurt, I guess I didn't let it bother me when we were on the surface. You're hands are so vital to everything you do that the gloves were custom fit; but we still ran into these problems. We got down to blue-collar work and you couldn't design everything for the convenience of the astronaut. On the Shuttle, I think, a lot of the equipment they're using in the Payload Bay EVAs are big things that you can hold on to. They don't have Rover breakers to pull, and sample bags to twist, and core caps to put on, and drills to run, and cores to jack out of the ground. If you went through the kind of things we did, your hands would probably get tired even if you didn't have gloves, if you didn't have to work against the pressure of the suit, if your knuckles didn't rub on the inside of the glove, if you didn't have to work with all of the layers covering your hand and your fingers, if you didn't have to work with your fingertips covered with @alsjurl/apollo.glossary.html#RTV"@alsjt>RTV</a>. Even if you took all of that away, if you look at all the work we did during those three EVAs, you would probably end up with your hands fairly tired anyway. How long can you grip a hammer and beat on a core tube and chip rocks even without gloves?
148:17:28|ALSJ||Gene's hands are probably wet.
148:17:50|ALSJ||Jack is anticipating having a reaction to lunar dust as he did after EVA-1.
148:18:14|ALSJ|CDR|There was a definite smell of spent gunpowder. I'll never forget that.
148:19:25|ALSJ|LMP|I meant that it was the achievement of the whole Apollo team.
148:20:05|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Brian Lawrence notes that, although Joe Allen is not very tall, the nickname "Little Joe" also comes from the character of "Little Joe Cartwright" in the very popular TV Western series "Bonanza".
148:20:44|ALSJ|LMP|I was referring to the times when I was annoyed with Parker, such as at Station 3.
148:20:51|ALSJ||They are removing the purge valves for cleaning. With the purge valve removed, the port in the suit is closed.
148:22:04|ALSJ||With the diverter valve in the horizontal position, air is flowing into the suit cavity. During the EVA, they had it in the vertical position and only got flow into the helmet. Flow into the torso helps dry the suit by keeping some flow going despite the fact that they have their helmets and gloves off.
148:22:20|ALSJ|LMP|We were setting up the LM oxygen flow and, even though we weren't connected to the LM hoses, the system would start to filter dust out of the air.
148:22:32|ALSJ||Gene may be talking about his @alsjurl/alsj-RCU.html"@alsjt>RCU</a> because that is where the switches for the pump and fan are located. See the discussion at 148:25:00.
148:22:46|ALSJ||The PGA or "Pressure Garment Assembly" is the combination of suit, PLSS, and visor assembly.
148:23:40|ALSJ||They are still on the left-hand column of Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf5-2.jpg"@alsjt>5-2</a>. "Skosh" means "a little bit".
148:25:00|ALSJ||After turning off the PLSS by going to Mode O, they hook up the LM comm circuit before recharging the PLSS oxygen tanks and then doffing the backpacks. Because of the short interval between Gene's comment about "going PLSS Mode to O" and Jack's remark about a hot piece of equipment, the most likely candidate, again, would seem to be the chest-mounted @alsjurl/alsj-RCU.html"@alsjt>RCU</a>. An alternate interpretation comes from Apollo 15 when, at 148:39:34, Scott and Irwin noticed that the EVA-2 SRC was hot. For Apollo 17, I think it is far more likely that the "hot" object is an RCU than the SRC because, at the start of the Apollo 17 EVA-2 at 141:19:53, Gene mentioned that SRC-2 was in the shade.
148:27:45|ALSJ||They are recharging Jack's PLSS for EVA-3 and are on the right-hand column of Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf5-2.jpg"@alsjt>5-2</a>.
148:27:45|ALSJ|LMP|We were recharging the PLSSs mostly just to get them out of the way. And, if you had a problem, then you'd know it right away. That's always a good philosophy: try to identify your problems early. Then they'd have all night to work it.
148:31:48|ALSJ||Next, they will recharge Gene's PLSS.
148:34:00|ALSJ||The nominal cabin pressure is 5.0 psi and Gene's question is whether or not there is some valve open that should be closed. Eventually, they will trace the increased pressure to a slow leak in Pressure Regulator A. There will be more discussion of this leak through the evening and into Day 3.
148:34:19|ALSJ||Jack does not sound as congested as he did after EVA-1.
148:36:52|ALSJ||They are resetting the Suit Gas Diverter valve so that oxygen can flow from the suit circuit into the cabin. Frank O'Brien has provdied a photo of the upper part of the forward surface of the ECS ( @alsjurl/FOB_suit_gas_diverter.jpg"@alsjt>628k</a> ) in the LM simulator at the Cradle of Aviation Museum. The suit gas diverter valve is at the upper right in its own recess.
148:37:14|ALSJ||If the cabin pressure exceeds 5.83 psi, a relief valve will dump the excess out of the spacecraft. As long as the valve works, there is no danger to the crew or the LM but, obviously, they would rather not waste oxygen.
148:38:03|ALSJ||Having finished Gene's PLSS recharge, they are disconnecting and removing the RCUs and OPSs and then the PLSSs. These activities are listed on Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf5-3.jpg"@alsjt>5-3</a>. Before stowing the OPSs, they will perform OPS checkouts and report the source pressures. The checkout procedures are stenciled on the OPS cover, as can be seen in training photo @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#KSC72PC347"@alsjt>KSC-72PC-347</a>. The procedures can also be found in @alsjurl/a17/A15-17EMUv2Sec4.2.1.jpg"@alsjt>Section 4.2.1</a> in @alsjurl/a17/alsj-EMU2.pdf"@alsjt>Volume 2 of the A15-17 EMU Handbook</a>.
148:48:01|ALSJ||Next they will change the PLSS batteries and LiOH canisters. These activities are listed in the right-hand column of Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf5-3.jpg"@alsjt>5-3</a>.
148:49:20|ALSJ||Jack is speculating that oxygen from the Suit Circuit is being added to the cabin through Gene's hose without returning to the Suit Circuit. However, it is normal procedure to have both Suit Isolation Valves ( @alsjurl/FOB_suit_gas_diverter.jpg"@alsjt>628k</a> ) in Suit Flow at this point. The @alsjurl/lm_cabin_gas_return_valve.jpg"@alsjt>Cabin Gas Return Valve</a> is currently in the Egress position and no oxygen would be flowing from the cabin to the suit circuit through that valve; cabin gas should be flowing back into the suit circuit through the return hoses; and, finally, with pressure regulators A &amp; B both set to Cabin, there shouldn't be any oxygen being added to the suit circuit.
148:49:20|ALSJ||The following dialog was accumulated during a change-of-shift press briefing and times are not available.
148:53:14|ALSJ||Houston wants Jack to turn off oxygen flow from the tanks in the descent stage to the cabin. They are testing the possibility that one or the other of the pressure regulators is adding small amounts of oxygen to the cabin even with the pressure substantially higher than 4.8 psi, the normal cutoff point.
148:53:14|ALSJ||Whenever either of the regulators is set to Egress, a sensor activates a solenoid which puts the diverter valve in Egress as well. The diverter valve has a push/pull control and Egress is the extended ("pull") position.
148:53:14|ALSJ||During the EVA preps, Jack had apparently stowed his hoses in such a way that oxygen could not flow out of them and into the cabin, thereby creating some back pressure.
148:59:35|ALSJ||The recharge station is on the left bulkhead next to Gene's shoulder. However, they aren't doing any recharging at this time but, instead, are just getting Gene's PLSS out of the way.
148:59:35|ALSJ|CDR|The odd numbered batteries were the Commander's and the even numbers were the LMP's. That way you could keep them straight. When you took a bad battery out, you'd put the new ones in the order 1,3,5 and 2,4,6 and you'd know you had the right battery at the right time.
149:02:44|ALSJ||If the PLSS fill valve were open, it could be adding oxygen to the cabin.
149:03:49|ALSJ||Jack still doesn't sound as tired or congested as he did at the end of EVA-1. He remarked on this at 148:20:30.
149:03:49|ALSJ||They are now on Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf5-4.jpg"@alsjt>5-4</a>.
149:08:27|ALSJ||Jack may be just finishing changing batteries and the LiOH canister on his PLSS. Once that is done, he will lay his PLSS on the floor between them. After the battery management, he and Gene will weigh and stow the samples.
149:13:34|ALSJ||Sample 12008 was collected at the end of the first Apollo 12 EVA. It is a fine-grained basalt with a notable ilmenite content.
149:13:34|ALSJ|CDR|It's amazing - like somebody remembering license plate numbers!
149:13:34|ALSJ|LMP|(Laughing) I had the sample numbers memorized in those days! I had worked very closely with the Apollo 11 samples; and, with two or three other people, I had done an introduction to the Apollo 11 Science Conference. My main contribution was to look at all of the basaltic samples and, particularly, study the minerals that lined the vesicles. And, after Apollo 12 came back, I extended that study. Bob Sutton and I gave a talk at the Apollo 12 conference in 1971 but, unfortunately, that paper has never been finished or published. We did something that had never been done before; and that was to try to relate the positions of the samples to the depth for which they were derived by the various impacts that formed craters in the vicinity of the Apollo 12 landing site. The 12 crew did an excellent job of sampling; they got a good distribution of samples. It was the only place where I think we had a chance to really look at the layering within the upper portion of the mare basalts. I need to finish that paper.
149:13:34|ALSJ|CDR|- (Tongue-in-cheek) "I want to thank Jack for supporting all my geologic observations about Gene's Rock, which looks very much like the Apollo 12 rock 12008.
149:16:51|ALSJ||One possible cause of the pressure increase is the heat load added by the warm suits, PLSSs, samples, and sample containers. Twenty years after the fact, Jack wonders if Allen may have been referring to the LM oxygen tanks, perhaps a temperature increase in the tanks resulting from the sudden outflow during repressurization. This does seem to be Allen's reference, but the speculation doesn't sound very plausible.
149:16:51|ALSJ||Usually, Jack and Gene pronounce the acronym as a single word: "Sep". This may be the only instance where Jack spells the acronym.
149:16:51|ALSJ||These are aggregate weights of the containers and the samples in them, measured in terrestrial pounds. The empty SRC weighs 14.7 pounds, each of the empty SCBs 1.7 pounds, and each of the individual sample bags a negligible 1/50 of a pound. In addition to bagged samples, the SRC also contains the long can - empty weight, one pound - and four core stems which, empty, collectively weigh 2.6 pounds. The Mission Report gives a net weight of about 75 pounds of samples for this EVA, a figure in good agreement with the 78 pounds estimated here. Gene and Jack collected about 31 pounds of samples during the first EVA and will collect about 137 pounds during the final traverse. The weights are being taken so that the flight engineers will have a good reading of the LM weight and, if necessary, can adjust stowage of the rock containers to control the center-of-mass in preparation for lift-off.
149:16:51|ALSJ|LMP|They wanted to make sure we didn't get over our margins so that we wouldn't have to use the RCS (Reaction Control System) to complete the rendezvous.
149:16:51|ALSJ||Gene and Jack will collect a total of 243 pounds of samples, compared with 210 pounds by the Apollo 16 crew, 170 by Apollo 15 crew, and a combined total of 215 pounds returned by the Apollo 11, 12, and 14 crews.
149:21:56|ALSJ||Prior to removing the suits, they turned on a heater for the @alsjurl/alsj-WasteFluids.html"@alsjt>urine dump line</a> and, then, emptied the urine collection bags.
149:22:19|ALSJ|LMP|By closing the regulators we stopped the flow of make-up oxygen into the cabin. The air in the cabin still circulated and, as you breathed down the oxygen and scrubbed out the carbon dioxide, you had a gradual decrease in pressure.
149:22:19|ALSJ||They have started to get Gene out of his suit.
149:28:16|ALSJ||They are letting oxygen from the suit circuit flow into the cabin through the diverter valve again. This will tell them if the source of the extra oxygen is in the suit circuit.
149:32:26|ALSJ||Jack's sinuses sound a little clogged. During this period they are probably cleaning the zippers and other fittings on Gene's suit as per checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf5-5.jpg"@alsjt>5-5</a>. Once they are done, they will stow the suit on the engine cover, neck ring aft, and will put the suit legs in @alsjurl/a17/alsj-JettBag.html"@alsjt>jettison bags</a> to try to control the dust. Once that is done, they will reconnect the air hoses to the suit to help dry it out.
149:48:21|ALSJ|LMP|When you took it off, the inside of the suit was damp but there wasn't water sloshing around.
149:48:21|ALSJ||Gene and Jack are two hours behind the nominal timeline. Now they will get Jack out of his suit and, then, clean and stow it.
149:57:51|ALSJ|CDR|This is just pilot's talk. 'Five-by-five' just means that you're reading loud and clear.
149:57:56|ALSJ|LMP|There wasn't much Gene could do but unzip me. So he just stood back out of the way while I wiggled to extract myself. It didn't take very long as long as the inside of the suit was reasonably dry and, because the zipper was on the front, you could get out by yourself if necessary.
149:59:13|ALSJ|CDR|I think you've really got to start out clean. There weren't any special 'clean-room' precautions like you utilize when you're making computer chips or something like that. People wore coveralls and they wore coverings on their shoes so that they wouldn't drag in dirt, but it wasn't burdensome in any way. You went in in your street clothes to suit up. You just wanted to start out with a clean suit, with clean wrist bands and all your seals working. 'Start with a whole airplane. Don't leave town with only part of an airplane, because you may lose another part of it on the way.' We proved that we could put the suits on, take them off, and put them on again - repeatedly and in a very constrained and not very clean environment. We tried to dry them out and we tried to wipe wrist rings off. We tried to make sure that the quick-disconnects on the oxygen hoses were clean. We proved that we could do it because we had no other choice. That's the way it was designed. But I don't know that, the way we were treating them, we could have gone for ten EVAs and not have trouble with them. I'm sure we probably would have had trouble, as a matter of fact. With all that dust, you're going to have seals start leaking. You've already heard us talk about how hard it was to turn the wrist rings because dust was getting in them; and, if you used them a little bit more, they were going to quit working altogether. If you're talking about a lunar base, I'm sure that, after ten outings, the suits are going to have to be put on a rack to be cleaned up and oiled and a few other things. At some point you're going to have to go through a refurbishment cycle and, if you're going out every day, you'll certainly want to have a couple of suits so that, while the technicians are cleaning up one, you've got another to use. We didn't push the hardware to that limit, but I'm sure we would have run into some problems if we had.
149:59:13|ALSJ|CDR|That was one of our major concerns: care and treatment of the suits. The worst thing in the world would be to be on the lunar surface and not be able to go out because your suit has a leak in it. So we were awfully, awfully careful with those things. There weren't four guys to help you and keep you cleaned and brushed and oiled. Rather than having the suits hanging on a rack, they were laying in a bundle on the engine cover; so you took care of them the best way you could.
149:59:13|ALSJ||A composite image (@alsjurl/a17/a17stitch20522-25eh.jpg"@alsjt>2.5 Mb</a>) made by Ed Hengeveld from photos AS17-134-20522 and 25, giving a wide view from the LMP's station.
150:18:42|ALSJ||Although the urine is dumped into a sump in the descent stage, opening the @alsjurl/DumpValve.html"@alsjt>dump valve</a> would influence the cabin pressure at least a little and Houston wants to watch what will probably be small variations in pressure in response to the regulators.
150:19:21|ALSJ||Having gotten Jack out of his suit, they then got out of their Liquid Cooled Garments and into their Constant Wear Garments or, longjohns. They are now on Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf5-6.jpg"@alsjt>5-6</a>.
150:28:23|ALSJ||These are optimum lift-off times for upcoming orbits of the Command Module, beginning with orbit 33.
150:29:51|ALSJ||Ron Evans, in the Command Module America, is roughly over the landing site, about halfway through orbit 32. Orbit 33 will start over the middle of the Farside at about 151:37.
150:30:28|ALSJ|LMP|The trail-food-like packages of freeze-dried or dehydrated food were connected together and, as you pulled them out of the storage compartment, you were supposedly getting that day's pre-planned meal. Now, that was the case in the Command Module and, in the Lunar Module, it probably wasn't that organized and we just had large packages with the mission day indicated: LMP Day 5 or something like that.
150:31:34|ALSJ||Jack reads the steps while Gene, who is off comm, enters them into the computer.
150:31:34|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Frank O'Brien notes that the steps 'Verb 37 Enter, 06 Enter' will start the computer powerdown program but he is "unclear how this will prevent the computer's clock from overflowing when the computer is powered up again.
150:32:07|ALSJ|CDR|I think our computer-based inertial navigation system was the state-of-the art. It ended up in 747's flying across the Pond (usually the Atlantic Ocean). We'd write the software for the different missions and it would take hours and hours in the simulator to wring out all the bugs in it before you would have a level of confidence in it that it could be declared operational. It's obsolete equipment today but, as far as I know, there was nothing comparable at the time in military or commercial aviation.
150:35:36|ALSJ|LMP|I was working a lot with my gold visor halfway down, just so I could see better. And they got confused when Gene or I made a comment some other place that the sunshade wouldn't come all the way down.
150:35:45|ALSJ||Joe is referring to comments made at 147:55:56 when Gene was dusting Jack's PLSS.
150:37:00|ALSJ||The phrase that Jack used at 145:25:00 to describe the Station 4 boulder was "intensely fractured". A search of the Station 4 dialog reveals nothing resembling "bedded spatter" or, as another possibility, "bedded strata".
150:37:00|ALSJ|LMP|If we had seen 'bedded spatter' or some other clearly volcanic-looking material, they would have sent us back to Station 4. If there was any indication at all that it was a volcanic cone, we would have gone back there.
150:38:04|ALSJ||At 145:23:48, Jack described the rocks in the bottom of the crater in the following words: "The central peak, if you will, or central mound, is very blocky and jagged. And the impression I have of the other mounds in the bottom is that they look like slump masses that may have come off the side.
150:39:01|ALSJ||Jack sounds like his sinuses may be a bit clogged.
150:40:37|ALSJ|LMP|Almost certainly, I was surprised - and I think I recall it now - that they didn't want to ask more questions about EVA-2. More than likely, there were lots of questions; but the Flight Director was saying 'We've got to get them back on the timeline and get them to sleep.' We did a lot of geology debriefing when we got home but, unfortunately, we can't find the tapes or a transcript. I sat with Lee Silver and probably Muhlberger and Swann and others and recorded a lot of extra debrief.
150:40:37|ALSJ||A raw transcript of the post-mission geology debriefing were found for us in early 1994 at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston by Carol Albyn.
150:42:01|ALSJ|LMP|After EVA-3, you were getting ready to go home, you'd done what you'd come to do so why worry about getting your full eight-hour rest period? You don't need eight hours of rest anyway; five was plenty, I think, for both of us. Plus, we were going to spend three days in orbit after rendezvous, so there wasn't going to be any hurry. So I think Gene was just trying to discourage them from even thinking about shortening the EVA.
150:42:19|ALSJ||That is, there is an hour's worth of unallocated time in the schedule. This is the item on Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf5-7.jpg"@alsjt>5-7</a> called "MCC-H Conference
150:42:56|ALSJ|CDR|We had five and a half hours to get prepared from the time we woke up to the time of lift-off and that was an enormous amount of time. We could have pushed the third night's sleep back and gotten up an hour later. And, if we did shorten the sleep, once we got back in the Command Module we could make it up.
150:42:56|ALSJ||As things will turn out, they will have a 7-hour rest period after a full, 7-hour, 15-minute EVA.
150:42:56|ALSJ|CDR|I've said that I thought sleeping on the Moon was a big waste of time. We needed physical rest, we needed to get out of our suits, but I really wish we'd had more time to absorb what was going on. There's no human being who can consciously take in all of an experience like that while it is occurring. Subconsciously, you do retain things that you weren't aware of at the time and it takes a while for those to come out. You have to be careful that you don't develop a convenient memory and have things come out the way you might like to have them come out or in a way that makes you look like you had all the right answers beforehand. It's a very dangerous trap that you can fall into. So I wish we'd had more time to absorb things. But we had no choice; we had to rest and, as crew commander I had to maintain some discipline in our relationship with the ground. We knew we had some padding in the schedule, we knew we could go out a little longer, we knew we could sleep a little less; but the eight hours was important because, although we really only slept about four hours, we needed to think and talk and rest.
150:48:26|ALSJ||The PLSS recharge was scheduled to start at 149:30. Evidently, they have decided to do the recharging tasks while they eat. They are now on Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf5-7.jpg"@alsjt>5-7</a>.
150:58:42|ALSJ||Houston knows the times at which the hot spots were seen from the Command Module instruments; but geographical identification will require knowing exactly where the spacecraft was in its orbit at each of the observation times.
151:01:04|ALSJ||The previous single EVA records had been 7:12 and 7:23 set during the second EVAs on Apollos 15 and 16, respectively.
151:02:25|ALSJ|LMP|Because we spent at least a couple of hours on the Rover on this second EVA, clearly we didn't stress ourselves as much as during the first day. And we were more familiarized, so there was less emotional stress than on the first EVA, if there had been any at all. And I'll tell you, I never remember feeling anxious about anything except about the timeline and being able to get things done.
151:03:03|ALSJ|LMP|Joe was joking here. He was going to ask how hard the Rover worked. That's the way Joe thinks.
151:03:03|ALSJ||The energy saved by riding the Rover is shown dramatically by the following table of activity averages. The table is derived from the Apollo 17 Mission Report.
151:03:03|ALSJ||<i>Jack notes that, even though he spent a lot of time leveling equipment versus Gene's efforts with the drill, he also spent time laying out the geophone lines. He offers his relatively low ALSEP average in support of his contention that running with the cross-country stride didn't consume much energy.
151:03:03|ALSJ|CDR|Our rates weren't all that different. (Laughing) Of course, I had to expend a lot of my energy getting Jack all squared away, so you'd probably want to take about ten percent off of my average and add it to his. I had to get his valves turned off, shove him in the hatch, help him on the Rover, pick him up when he fell. So, realistically, we've got to take that into account. (Somewhat more seriously) My rate while we were driving was about ten percent higher than Jack's and maybe that had to do with the fact that you're not a casual driver on the Rover - you're involved all the time. And I've got to believe that that shows up as an expenditure of BTU's.
151:04:56|ALSJ||At 10 kilometers per hour, they would cover 20 meters in 7 seconds. Note Gene's statement of 15 kph versus his claim of 17 1/2 or 18 kph at 144:21:31.
151:05:22|ALSJ||The avalanche that produced the light mantle had covered the Scarp with fine material - to a @alsjurl/a17/a17.ppintro.pdf"@alsjt>depth estimated to be 20 m at the base of the South Massif</a> - and, unlike out on the valley floor, there were very few blocks of any size near the rims of even the freshest craters. Therefore, when they were approaching a crater, unless they could actually see the interior, there was no ready way to distinguish the deep, fresh craters - which they wanted to drive around - from the shallow, aged craters they could usually drive through.

151:23:29|ALSJ||Magazine Bravo - number 134 the overall Apollo catalog - is the one Gene used during the first EVA.
151:23:29|ALSJ||At some point prior to the start of EVA-3, Jack takes a series of photographs out his window. He uses magazine 140, also known as Echo. Because that magazine was on Jack's camera at the start of EVA-3, he probably took the @alsjurl/a17/a17pan1512355.jpg"@alsjt>window pictures</a> (assembled by Dave Bryne) after putting the magazine on the camera but before stowing it in the ETB.

151:42:33|ALSJ|CDR|I sound a little tired. It was the end of a long day. During these long periods of silence we were probably eating something, packing things away, and cleaning up a little bit. Sort of relaxing a little bit and doing our own thing; letting them know, every once in a while, where we were. And they were leaving us alone to get things prepared for our rest period. It was good. You need that kind of time.
151:47:36|ALSJ||They are at about 150 hours in the timeline and have gained, at most, about ten minutes.
151:48:21|ALSJ|LMP|This was one of the few chances you had to reflect a little bit. This was just a gradual wind-down from the long day. While we were filling the PLSSs and doing the other things, Gene and I chatted, mostly about what'd we'd done rather than what we'd seen. And often, I think, we were speculating about the kind of things the ground might recommend. I wish we'd talked more with the ground about the geology, but I also understand the Flight Director's position.
152:17:56|ALSJ||Deke Slayton joins the conversation.
152:18:08|ALSJ||They are now on Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf5-8.jpg"@alsjt>5-8</a>. The rest period was scheduled to start at 151:25.
152:18:08|ALSJ|LMP|Gene got his @alsjurl/a12/a12.hammocks.jpg"@alsjt>hammock</a> up first and got in it, then I put mine up and got in it. There wasn't much spare space. The suits were on the engine cover under Gene's hammock and, as I recall, the helmets and visor assemblies were way at the back, sort of under the suits.
152:21:19|ALSJ||Joe's son, David Christopher Allen, was a very active four year old at the time of the mission.
152:24:09|ALSJ|CDR|It was easy to get philosophical. I've said before that I've always felt that sleep was one of the greatest wastes of the short time we had on the Moon. You're only there for 75 hours and you sure don't want to waste twenty four of it sleeping or resting. You'd like to be doing something that would allow you to go further in learning and exploring. And, yet, you had to rest if you were going to take advantage of your physical and mental capabilities the next day. Each EVA you became more tired and you began to sleep. When I slept, I slept pretty good. I don't know, maybe I got three or four good hours of sleep. So a lot of the time you'd just lay there and think. Just before you'd gone to bed, you'd look out the window and see the flag and the Massif and the Earth. There you were, a quarter of a million miles from Earth, laying in a hammock in a little tin can. 'Here I am; I'm really on the Moon. What should I be doing that I'm not doing? How can I take advantage of this? Is it real? Is it a dream?' I've always said that looking back at Earth was a link with reality from a place that was almost like a dream. During the rest of the mission you get caught up with all the things that you've got to do: checking out the PLSS, checking out the LM, doing the geology, driving. You get so caught up with what you're doing that you could be almost anywhere. So you've got to take time out sometime during the mission to think about where you are and what you're doing. You could do a little of that during the EVAs themselves. While Jack was dusting me off I could take a look around at the Massifs and the flag and the Rover and it was a pretty big chunk to swallow. So it was easy to get philosophical.
160:25:04|ALSJ||Pregnant Pause. Flight Director Gerry Griffin is an alumnus of Texas A&amp;M University. The University was one of many institutions founded as the result of the "(Morrill) Act of 1862 Donating Lands for Colleges of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts". Because it was founded as an "Ag" school, the students are known as "Aggies".
160:26:34|ALSJ|CDR|This was probably the first time I'd heard the Aggie War Hymn in my life and it really didn't impress me all that much. You can tell that in my tone of voice. So when I said 'I want you to say it first,' I meant 'Whatever you're going to say, let's get it done and over with.' I wish I knew what Jack thought of that.
160:26:40|ALSJ|CDR|Gerry went to Texas A&amp;M and he's a big Aggie (supporter). Now maroon is an Aggie color, but orange happens to be a (University of) Texas color. A&amp;M and Texas are always at odds. If we had found blue dirt, it would have been better than finding orange dirt. That's a big deal around Houston.
160:26:40|ALSJ|LMP|There were a lot of Aggies in the Control Room, but Gerry Griffin was the head Aggie.
160:27:01|ALSJ||That is, Gene is an alumnus of Purdue University and would like some appropriate wake-up music before the mission is over. Purdue is an engineering school and, hence, the students and alumni refer to themselves as "Boilermakers". A "Boilermaker" is also a drink consisting of a shot of whiskey followed by a beer chaser.
160:27:20|ALSJ||Gene's reference is to the morning-after feeling following a few too many boilermakers.
160:27:20|ALSJ|CDR|Sometimes you're asleep and it's the wake-up call that gets you up; and other times you're up and taking care of things without bothering the ground. Here, we'd had a couple of hard days on the Moon and had one day to go. The adrenaline probably started pumping a little while later; but I would expect that a little bit of the edge had worn off. We were pretty tired, physically, at the end of each one of those days, and you don't get the best rest in the world in a situation like that. You rest and you sleep; but you lay there half the time asking yourself if there isn't something else you could do instead of try to sleep. It was enough sleep to keep you going, but I don't know how good a rest it was. I probably had my comm helmet hanging up next to my hammock and, when Gordo called, sat up Indian style. One-sixth g gave you some facility to move around, even in those tight quarters.
160:29:03|ALSJ||The planned wake-up time was 159:25 and the planned start of the EVA was 162:40. Houston woke them up at 160:25 - an hour late - and they will start the EVA at 163:32 - only 52 minutes behind. Because of padding built into the timeline leading up to launch on Day 4, they will start this third EVA in great shape.
160:35:03|ALSJ||Fullerton reads the following list of lift-off times slowly and very carefully.
160:37:21|ALSJ||The crew first entered lunar orbit by firing the Command Module engines over the lunar Farside. Evans has completed a bit more than half of the current revolution. Gene and Jack are about to start eating breakfast. Forty-five minutes are allotted in the flight plan for each of the meals.
160:44:24|ALSJ||A Starry Night view of Earth from Taurus-Littrow at 1335 CST on December 13, 1972 ( @alsjurl/a17/A17dec13CST1335.jpg"@alsjt>18k</a> ) shows South America dominating the sunlight portion of Earth with Antarctica on the left and the southeastern U.S. on the right. This image is, of course, cloudless.
160:44:24|ALSJ|LMP|I remember that Gene was looking at the Earth through the rendezvous window. You couldn't see it out the front unless you got down and most of the time we were standing. The suits were on the engine cover, so you'd just stand and lean. In one-sixth g it was no big deal to stand forever.
160:44:24|ALSJ|CDR|There wasn't much room to sit anywhere, except on the suits, and that was one thing we didn't want to do (because of the danger of getting dust into the zippers and rings.)
160:44:50|ALSJ||That is, the Surgeon wants to look at Jack's biomedical data.
160:45:07|ALSJ|LMP|I doubt if anybody on the Moon would have told the doctors if there was a problem, just to make sure that there would be no glitches on getting out for the third EVA. Our hands and fingers were sore from the lifted fingernails. If you touched them, they were very sensitive. I don't recall that there was continuous ache. I think it was only when you hit your nails on something. I wore @alsjurl/glove.jpg"@alsjt>thin nylon liners</a> in my gloves to try to protect my fingernails. Without the liners, I was uncomfortable with my sweaty hand against the rubber. We didn't have the water cooling out into the fingers - just up to the wrist. You're hands didn't get hot, but you did perspire.
160:45:07|ALSJ||NASA photo @alsjurl/a17/ap17-S72-56081.jpg"@alsjt>S72-56081</a> shows the crew preparing to cut a cake aboard the recovery carrier, Ticonderoga. Note the blood under the nails of Jack's middle and ring fingers.
160:45:07|ALSJ|CDR|As I've said, I don't remember my fingernails giving me as much of a problem as blisters on my knuckles. I've got such a fat hand. But I do remember that the lunar dust penetrated well down into the quick. It took three, four, five, six weeks for the lunar dust to grow out. So the dust was able to get in there; I just don't remember any pain from the fingernails being lifted off. My main recollection is of my knuckles being rubbed raw.
160:45:11|ALSJ|CDR|If you go from the extremes of the first EVA to the third EVA, I can tell you that when I was working with my hands out in the Sun, I could feel the heat penetrate during that third EVA that I could not feel during the first EVA. Sun angle did have a significant effect. I don't know if the data show that we used more cooling in our PLSSs during that third EVA.
160:45:11|ALSJ||Gene's feedwater consumption rates for the three EVAs were 1.572, 1.339, and 1.566 pounds per hour. Jack's figures were 1.508, 1.326, and 1.589 lb/hr. The dominant factor determining the differences from day to day is the workload, rather than the Sun angle. On the first day, they spent most of their time deploying the ALSEP and, consequently, worked fairly hard. On the second day, they spent a considerable amount of time on the Rover and got plenty of rest between the geology stops. On this third day, they will spend much of their time doing geology on the slopes of the North Massif and the Sculptured Hills. The work will be challenging and they will have briefer drives between the stops.
160:46:18|ALSJ||They have completed the last task on Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf5-8.jpg"@alsjt>5-8</a>. Just after the second EVA, they filled the PLSSs with oxygen and then had let them settle before giving them a top-off charge just before going to sleep. Now they are doing a second top-off charge to ensure the longest possible EVA. Not surprisingly, this procedure was added to the checklist for Apollo 15, the first mission to attempt a seven-hour EVA. Note that there is no water top-off, suggesting that they are confident that there wasn't a significant volume of gas added to the water tank during the filling procedure.
160:46:59|ALSJ|LMP|The Lunar Orbiter team discovered mascons in the Doppler tracking data. They found that the lunar gravitational field is not uniform; and, specifically, that there are concentrations of mass under the most circular - i.e., the youngest - of the large basins and mass deficiencies under the rims of those basins - notably Serenitatis, Nectaris, Crisium, Imbrium, Orientale. The computer model that fits is one that has the mantle of the Moon - at about 60 kilometers depth - slightly raised under the basins and with a bit of a deficiency around them. It's like an incipient water splash. The rebound from the impact that formed the basin has caused the mantle beneath the center of the impact to rise slightly. Plus, the effect of that little rise is accentuated by the flat plate of dense material represented by the lunar mare. As I remember, the lunar mare has density of about 3.4 grams per cubic centimeter, whereas the surrounding highlands have a compacted density of about 2.9. So it's a significant contrast. One of the more interesting aspects of it is that the old, irregular mare basins don't have mascons. And that suggests that between the formation of the old, irregular basins and the young, circular basins, something fundamental changed in the lunar crust. It became stronger - a lot stronger - so that, in the younger basins, there was no compensation for (or relaxation as a result of) these density differences as apparently there was early on. And the change presumably occurred over a fairly short period of time around 3.9 billion years ago when most of the young, circular basins formed. There's a lot of controversy raging about whether all of the 45 to 50 basins formed at just about the same time. I'm of the belief that that can't have happened, in part, because you have this very distinct strengthening of the crust beneath the mascon basins.
160:46:59|ALSJ||The net effect of the mascons is generally a circularization of an elliptical orbit and an overall loss of orbital energy. Indeed, because of the effects of mascons, no object can stay in lunar orbit for more than a few months without engine burns to episodically increase orbital energy.
160:46:59|ALSJ|LMP|The flight dynamics people anticipated that, because of the micro accelerations and decelerations associated with the mascons along the path of the Command Module, you would get a perturbation of the orbit. So, after Ron dropped us off, he had a burn that put him into an orbit which, upon perturbation, would become a 60-mile circular orbit by the time we were ready to launch. They thought they could predict how the mascons would perturb the orbit - clever people, these Americans - but the mascons wouldn't co-operate. Their gravitational model was not sufficient to make those predictions. The main reason (for the inadequacies of the model) was that they couldn't track spacecraft as they orbited over the Farside and, consequently, they didn't have any information about Farside mascons. One of my reasons in proposing a Farside landing on Apollo 17 - when I tried to persuade NASA to let us land in Tsiolkovsky - was that you'd have to put together a communications system; and that would allow you to track the Farside orbits and gain additional knowledge about the Farside mascons. I suspect that there aren't very many. Tsiolkovsky is probably one of the few, because there just aren't many young, fresh, circular basins on the Farside. I suspect they've all compensated except for Tsiolkovsky and one or two others.
160:46:59|ALSJ|LMP|After the crew was finalized in the fall of '71, for the second time I tried to persuade Chris Kraft and others that we ought to consider a Farside landing. I had brought it up before - after Apollo 13 - as the culmination of the last four missions going to the places where everybody always wanted to go: Tycho, Orientale, the North Pole, and the Farside. I had fun trying to justify that mission to people. But everybody was so wrapped up in proving that they could survive the Apollo 13 failure and get Apollo 14 landed, that it didn't get much play. I worked it for a while, anticipating that just one more landing wouldn't help the politics of the space program very much. I wanted to build up to some sort of crescendo that would not only provide good science but would provide public interest. When I brought it up again in August or September of 1971, I went so far with the Lunar Mafia - the group of people at JSC who thought up these 'dumb' things to do on their own time - as to work out how to do it. Some of the guys in Flight Control were able to track down a couple of on-the-shelf Tiros satellites that could act as communications satellites. The plan was to place those, with a single Titan launch, at the Farside libration point. There's a libration point about 30,000 miles behind the Moon where things will stay, at least for a while, if you put them there. Except in very weird circumstances, satellites at the libration point would give you a direct link with Earth; and the two satellites gave you redundancy. It was a great plan. TRW quoted a price of about $80 million and I had added a $20 million contingency. And we had other plans. In one, as you went around the Moon in the Command Module, you'd drop off a bunch of small communications relay satellites, rather like the current Iridium scheme. (Laughing) But, finally, Chris called me in and said 'Shut up; quit talking about this. We're not going to spend a hundred million dollars to put a communications satellite behind the Moon for the last mission.' I'm not sure where the numbers came from, but the marginal cost of building the hardware for an Apollo mission was about $250 million and I was told that operational costs - to run the centers and the tracking stations, etc. - were about the same number.
160:46:59|ALSJ|CDR|Aside from the cost and the probability of having to delay the flight, management simply wasn't going to take the risk of sending us to the back side of the Moon. It would have been a challenge and would have been worthwhile doing, but we still had a lot to learn about the front side. I was involved in discussions at the level of Chris Kraft and George Low and it quickly became obvious that it wasn't going to happen. Jack used to go on crusades like this and get other people involved and go into the details of how to do it and what it was going to cost. And that was good. But Jack used to have the habit of pushing people and pushing people without knowing - politically or diplomatically - when to quit. And, finally, Chris got fed up.
160:48:38|ALSJ||Very Long Comm Break as they finish their meal.
160:48:38|ALSJ||The audio clip currently in the ALSJ jumps from here to @alsjurl/a17/#1631227"@alsjt>163:12:27</a>.
160:48:38|ALSJ||Because the Moon slowly rotates about its own axis while it orbits the Earth, it rotates under the plane of the Command Module orbit which stays fixed in space. Consequently, each time the Command Module makes it's closest approach to the landing site, the distance increases. In doing a plane change, Evans will apply a carefully calculated amount of lateral thrust at a particular point in his orbit such that his new orbital plane will pass directly over the landing site at the expected time of lift-off.
160:48:38|ALSJ|LMP|The normal rendezvous procedure was for the LM to be active and rendezvous with the CSM. And a CSM rescue would have been the case of where, for some reason, all the LM could do was get to orbit; and then it would have been a CSM-active rendezvous which would, of course, have taken lots more CSM fuel.
160:48:38|ALSJ|CDR|The LM had to get into some minimum, sustainable orbit. For a normal launch time, most likely it would have been a fuel problem that would have forced a Command Module rescue. For example, if your ascent engine shut down early and you got close to orbit and you had to expend most of your RCS fuel to get into that sustained orbit then, obviously, you would have done it. You would have used all the fuel you had to get into orbit; and then you'd rely on the Command Module to come get you. I always felt that a Command Module rescue was a remote possibility, although one that you had to maintain a fuel reserve for. The reason I say that it was a remote possibility is that, in most cases, you would have done the rendezvous even without the radar. The Command Module had a Doppler device and other systems to give us information and there was manually- and computer-derived information. The LM was a much better rendezvous vehicle than the CSM and, unless there was a fuel problem, there was little chance of having to do a Command Module rescue. And, even in the case of a fuel problem, the chances of you getting just high enough that, if the ascent engine shut down early, you had enough RCS fuel to add the amount of velocity to get a sustained orbit were small. You had to get into an orbit that wouldn't decay in five or six revs. And if you only got into an orbit that would decay in one or two revs, it would have been all over. The rescue was a time-consuming process. Now, for an emergency situation - which I always thought would have to have been a fairly catastrophic situation - it would have been a manual launch because of the inertial navigation system being powered down. You couldn't sit on an emergency on the lunar surface, but you could sit on an emergency once you got into orbit, because the Command Module did have that capability to come down and get you.
160:48:38|ALSJ|CDR|Of course, there were other reasons why we might have had to leave the lunar surface early. We could have been perfect but there could have been a problem with the Command Module which said 'guys, the Command Module's going to have to go home pretty quick, so you'd better get your ass off the lunar surface and get back there or he's going to go home without you. God forbid there had been an Apollo 13-type problem while the Lunar Module was on the surface, because I don't think any of us would have gotten home. But there might have been some other kind of problem in the Command Module: Ron could have gotten sick, a fuel cell could have gone out, you could have lost redundancy in your ability to start the Service Propulsion engine. And I guarantee you that, if you lose the redundancy to fire that engine, the ground is not going to allow you to stay there for three days. They're going to take you off the surface, you're going to rendezvous, and your going to come home. So it wasn't just a potential problem on the surface that we had to be prepared for; it was the other spacecraft as well. And that's always going to be the case with lunar travel. You've got to look at the entire system, not just at yourself. The suits, the backpacks, the amount of fuel you're using. One effects the other. If we'd blown one of our suits for some reason, had gotten in safely, and had gotten back to orbit but with only one good suit, we would have blown Ron Evans' EVA. With only two good suits, you couldn't depressurize the Command Module and all of that data that Ron had up there (in the SIM Bay) would have been lost. It wouldn't have been an emergency situation, per se, but it is typical of how interdependent the two spacecraft were.
160:48:38|ALSJ||Jack's next call indicates that they are ready to start Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf5-9.jpg"@alsjt>5-9</a>. They have picked up about 4 minutes.
161:22:00|ALSJ||Normally, they would have the pressure regulators in the Auto position in order to maintain cabin pressure. Because of the slow leak seen for a while the previous night, Houston is asking them to turn the regulators off and use the Suit Circuit to add oxygen to the cabin as necessary. After they put the @alsjurl/ECSf6GSuitIsolVlv.jpg"@alsjt>Suit Isolation Valve</a> to Suit Disconnect, they will attach oxygen hoses to the suits and re-position the Suit Isolation Valve to Suit Flow. Oxygen will then flow from the Suit Circuit into the suits and then, through the open neck ring, into the cabin. By positioning the @alsjurl/lm_cabin_gas_return_valve.jpg"@alsjt>Cabin Gas Return Valve</a> to Auto, any resulting pressure differential will open the valve and let oxygen flow from the cabin back into the Suit Circuit. Prior to performing the suit integrity check, they will put the Cabin Gas Return Valve back in Egress.

161:23:48|ALSJ|LMP|What comes to mind is that the bags for each meal were stacked together and taped. So what I was probably using was that tape. It was tape on plastic or whatever those bags were made of; so, when you pulled the tape off it was still good. Boy! I'd forgotten that that was what I used. But it certainly was better than grey (duct) tape because it was thinner. And the grey tape may have still been out in the Rover, anyway. Actually, I'm surprised that the ground hadn't come up with a fix, because that was a major deficiency in that second EVA.

Comparison with photos taken at the LM allow identification of boulders in the source region and, in an enhanced version of Jack's mini-pan, the upper part of the boulder track.
161:28:56|ALSJ|LMP|The surface of the dark mantle at the 17 site looks young relative to the age that was actually measured because it such fine-grained material. When you get an impact you may get a little of the regolith breccia - that we used to call 'instant rock' - but, for the most part, you're just distributing fine-grained materials - the Dunkirk Effect. You form a crater and then the crater subdues immediately because of the slumping of the fine-grained material. In World War II, when the Germans tried to bomb the British Expeditionary Force that was evacuated from Dunkirk, the sand absorbed the effects of their bombs. Unless they got a direct hit on somebody, very few people got hurt. If the British had tried to evacuate from a rocky coastline, they never would have made it. I just coined the name: the Dunkirk Effect. I don't know why I thought of it; but, basically, the impacts in the mantle were hitting into a great big sandpile and, unless they were really big ones and were getting down to the underlying basalt and threw up some rocks, the craters were not going to look fresh in the terms that we think of when they hit hard rock. The age of a surface is based on the number of craters that you see and, in this dark mantle, craters three to five times the thickness of the mantle tend to disappear very fast and not even be counted. So you count fewer craters of a given size. If you could do it accurately, you'd probably see a knee in the curve. In the large crater fraction, the counts would match the old age. And then there would begin to be a fall off as you got smaller and smaller.
161:30:04|ALSJ|CDR|This is typical of Parker and Schmitt. Jack would normally elaborate and this abrupt "Yes" was his way of getting back at Bob.
161:31:18|ALSJ||On the outbound leg of the EVA-2 traverse, they passed south of the ALSEP just before the range clicked to 0.4 kilometers - a range of about 350 meters from the SEP transmitter - and placed the first charge (EP-4) prior to the click to 0.6 km (a range of about 550 meters) at a bearing position of 083. On the inbound leg, they spotted the "Italian flag" on EP-4 at a time of 147:01:36 and they placed the second charge (EP-8) at 147:03:19 just after the range indicator clicked down to 0.4 (a range of 350 meters) at a bearing of 081. The dialog then suggests that they approached the ALSEP from the southwest. This is the information available to Houston at the moment. Analysis of the locator photographs indicate that the second package (EP-8) was placed about 300 meters from the LM and 440 meters from the SEP transmitter. The first package (EP-4) is 550 meters from the SEP transmitter. Therefore, they deployed the second package closer to the ALSEP - about 140 meters versus 225 - and a bit further south.
161:33:47|ALSJ||The SEP transmitter is east of the LM. Clearly, it is Houston that is confused.
161:34:57|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Ulli Lotzmann notes that the 10x40 monocular was manufactured by Leitz, Germany, and modified by NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) Houston.
161:34:59|ALSJ||Gene is correct. From their perspective, the charge on the left is EP-8, the one they emplaced at the end of the EVA. It is closer to the LM than EP-4, which they deployed at the start of EVA-2.
161:36:01|ALSJ|LMP|We hadn't planned to range along the base of the South Massif and didn't. And, in retrospect, we didn't do too badly in getting a fair variety at Station 2. Each of the three or four rocks we looked at in some detail was different. What we didn't get was which one was most representative.
161:39:21|ALSJ||As indicated at 161:31:18, the second package (EP-8) is about 140 meters from the geophone module. The first package (EP-4) is farther west and is about 225 meters from the geophone module. If Gene's 300 meters refers to the distance of the second package to the geophone module, his distance estimate is way off.
161:41:17|ALSJ||Very Long They are getting out of the Constant Wear Garments, into the Liquid Cooled Garments, and then the suits.
161:41:17|ALSJ|CDR|During these long comm breaks we were just busy doing things. You could always listen but, unless you were on VOX, it was sometimes inconvenient to key the switch to tell what you were doing. It was more efficient to just get it done. You know they're there and that you can talk to them if you need to.
161:52:54|ALSJ||It appears that they are working partly in parallel, rather than getting Jack into his suit first and then Gene.
161:57:47|ALSJ||Very Long By the end of this break, they are both in their suits. While Jack does the battery management, Gene may be getting unneeded items stowed and out of the way.
162:28:13|ALSJ||Next, they will report their PRD readings, as per Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf6-1.jpg"@alsjt>6-1</a>.
162:30:49|ALSJ||They are now on Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf6-2.jpg"@alsjt>6-2</a>.
162:33:43|ALSJ||By now, they've done the @alsjurl/A15-17EMUv2Sec4.2.1.jpg"@alsjt>OPS checkout</a>, have donned their @alsjurl/omega.html"@alsjt>watches</a> and wrist mirrors, and have gotten the helmets, gloves, and @alsjurl/alsj-LEVA.html"@alsjt>LEVAs</a> out into easy reach so that, once they have the PLSSs on, they can get at the other gear without having to do much turning or bending.
162:41:07|ALSJ||They have just finished the left-hand column of Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf6-2.jpg"@alsjt>6-2</a>. First, they will get Jack into his PLSS and then Gene into his.
162:49:53|ALSJ|CDR|My PLSS was stowed on the port bulkhead at my left shoulder with the (U.S.) flag outboard so that I could just back into it. I'm almost positive that Jack's was stowed on the floor by the hatch with the flag up and the surface that interfaces against the body down against the deck. There were some interim stowage bags hanging in front of the Commander's PLSS which we just threw in the back to get them out of the way.
162:49:53|ALSJ||At the end of PLSS donning, they put on their RCUs and connect the PLSS control cables to it. These steps are on Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf6-3.jpg"@alsjt>6-3</a>.
162:54:54|ALSJ|CDR|He had a signal strength meter and control knobs for pitch and yaw so that he could tweak up the signal. He must have hit one of the knobs.
162:58:46|ALSJ|CDR|On the surface, our antenna pointing didn't change but, throughout the flight when we changed attitudes, they would give us pitch and yaw for the (high-gain) steerable. This was true in the Command Module, too. If we were behind the Moon, they'd have given us a pitch and yaw so that when we came around the limb, we'd pick them up immediately.
162:58:46|ALSJ||static
163:00:40|ALSJ|LMP|All through this prep, it sounds like we had a pretty good rest. Compared with how we sounded at the end of the second EVA, it had obviously done us some good. Geno may not sound as rested as he has at other times, but I sound pretty normal.
163:00:40|ALSJ|CDR|- (Tongue in cheek) "Once you experience the responsibility of command, you realize that you never get as much sleep as the crew does. The crew's welfare comes first, before your own personal comfort.
163:00:40|ALSJ||By the end of this break, they have both PLSSs on and both RCUs connected and are about to start the comm check with each other and with Houston. As they come back on comm, they are doing the last two lines on Surface Checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf6-3.jpg"@alsjt>6-3</a>. Recall that they aren't actually using the Surface Checklist but, rather, cue cards which they have mounted on the panel at the front of the spacecraft. The cue cards contain the same steps as do the pages in the Surface checklist.
163:04:42|ALSJ||Jack is unable to hear Houston in this configuration.
163:06:01|ALSJ||The flags indicate that the suit is unpressurized and that the sublimator is not in operation. They also show that the warning system is working.
163:06:18|ALSJ||Now, it is Gene who can not hear Houston. They are near the top of the right-hand column of Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf6-4.jpg"@alsjt>6-4</a>.
163:07:18|ALSJ||They have finished the comm check and are about to start the @alsjurl/alsj-LM-ECS.html"@alsjt>ECS</a> reconfiguration steps on Surface <a href="a17LMLunarSurf6-5.jpg"@alsjt>6-5</a>.
163:07:21|ALSJ||They are circulating LM water through the LCGs.
163:07:25|ALSJ||They are shutting off the fans in the Suit Circuit and a sensor that detects a pressure difference across the fans when they are in operation.
163:07:40|ALSJ||Jack is remembering the troubles they had before the rest period with a small leak in one of the Demand Regulators. After testing, Houston had them open and close the valve in an effort to get it to reseat. It did and the leak disappeared. This is a good example of the attention that he and Gene paid to details that Houston sometimes forgot. There is nothing like being the person on the spot to focus one's attention.
163:08:03|ALSJ||Here, they are isolating the ECS Suit Circuit from the cabin.
163:08:05|ALSJ||The relief valve will open only if the Suit Circuit pressure exceeds 4.3 psi, dumping the excess oxygen into the cabin and, thereby, out the hatch and/or one of the @alsjurl/DumpValve.html"@alsjt>dump valves</a>. They are about to begin the right-hand column of Surface <a href="a17LMLunarSurf6-5.jpg"@alsjt>6-5</a>.
163:08:35|ALSJ|LMP|There were two settings on the valves. Low Flow was for make-up and High Flow was for use if you had a hole in the suit.
163:08:57|ALSJ|CDR|It isn't in the check list but, while I was putting in his purge valve, he might have taken the @alsjurl/water_gun.jpg"@alsjt>water gun</a> (photo by Mick Hyde) to get a drink, just to saturate himself." See, also, the confirming statement at 163:11:51
163:09:08|ALSJ|CDR|I don't know if he dropped the water gun or I dropped one of his hoses.
163:09:56|ALSJ||At 163:07:25 they'd turned off the fan in the ECS suit circuit and here, two minutes later, the Caution-and-Warning System is confirming that the centrifugal water separator has spun down and is no longer operating. As with other instances, this is primarily a test of the warning system.
163:09:56|ALSJ|CDR|Maybe someone would think, 'Master Alarm! Emergency lift-off'! But, with all these reconfigurations, we'd get them periodically.
163:10:29|ALSJ||As shown in @alsjurl/A14EMUHandbookV1FI-23.jpg"@alsjt>Figure I-23</a> in the @alsjurl/A14EMU-v1.pdf"@alsjt>EMU Handbook</a>, the PGA diverter valve is part of the oxygen inflow connector and gives them the option of directing the PLSS oxygen flow entirely into the helmet (the vertical position) or partly into the suit torso (the horizontal position). Generally, the astronauts put the diverter valve to horizontal only when they were in the cabin and were trying to dry the suits out a little. In the hoizontal position, used in the cabin, all the incoming oxygen stream is divided between a duct leading to the helmet vent and a duct leading the vents in the torso. In the vertical position, used outside, all the oxygen goes to the helmet vent. @alsjurl/A14EMU-v1-f1-10.tif"@alsjt>Figure I-10</a> from the EMU Handbook shows the layout of the ducts.
163:10:31|ALSJ||They are now finished with Jack's purge valve, his OPS hose, and his PGA diverter valve. They will now repeat the procedure for Gene.
163:10:40|ALSJ||They are talking about hose routing under Gene's right arm.
163:12:09|ALSJ||The tool harness straps attached to the outside of the LEVA on either side of the helmet. The attachment on the right side of Gene's helmet is visible in AS17-140- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21390"@alsjt>21390</a> taken early in this EVA and, also, in the formal, flag-and-earth portrait AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20387"@alsjt>20387</a> taken at @alsjurl/a17/a17.alsepoff.html#1182638"@alsjt>118:26:38</a>.
163:12:09|ALSJ|CDR|I think that these straps were attached there so that we could do a quick release in case we had to get in (the cabin) in a hurry.
163:12:09|ALSJ||Next, they do steps at the top of @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf6-6.jpg"@alsjt>6-6</a> - verifying all their suit connections - before completing the helmet donning at the bottom of @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf6-5.jpg"@alsjt>6-5</a>.
163:13:24|ALSJ||For the next half minute or so, they are probably checking the sunshades of Jack's @alsjurl/alsj-LEVA.html"@alsjt>LEVA</a>.
163:13:49|ALSJ||To get something out of the way, Jack would have to use his teeth.
163:15:32|ALSJ||The fan control is on the @alsjurl/alsj-RCU.html"@alsjt>RCU</a>.
163:15:34|ALSJ|CDR|When you snapped your helmet in, there was an L-shaped lip and you wanted to make sure that overlapping piece was flush. So, when you felt all the way around, if it wasn't snapped in properly, you could feel it. If it wasn't flush, that would indicate that it had gotten in kattiwampus (meaning, out of alignment or out of kilter) - that it may have locked the front but it didn't snap in and lock in the back. It was easier for us to feel each other's and it was very important to get the helmet on right. So we double verified it, just like we verified all those things. You don't want to go out with half a spacesuit. You don't want to have one little flaw, one little leak that might compromise your safety or your ability to get the job done.
163:15:50|ALSJ|CDR|The @alsjurl/alsj-LEVA.html"@alsjt>LEVA</a> didn't shift around very much, but it did have a little lock to keep it in place.
163:18:05|ALSJ||They are going to verify that they haven't hit any circuit breakers or switches.
163:18:37|ALSJ||They are staying on LM water for cooling for as long as possible. Jack will turn off the LCG pump at 163:23:15. They won't turn on their PLSS cooling until the hatch is open at 163:25:31.
163:18:42|ALSJ|CDR|We each had a stainless steel mirror on a Velcro strap. Mine was on my right wrist. The mirror was as much a part of the spacesuit as the watch was. We wore mirrors from Gemini right on through the whole program. It was the only way you could see the connectors on the front of your suit and, as I remember, things were written backwards so you could read them in the mirror. You could use the mirror to see things above you, behind you. We found it was invaluable in Gemini but they were afraid of glass so we had polished stainless steel mirrors. It was a square mirror, maybe three by three inches.
163:18:42|ALSJ||The strap on Gene's right wrist is visible in AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20380"@alsjt>20380</a> taken at about @alsjurl/a17/a17.alsepoff.html#1182320"@alsjt>118:23:20</a>. There appears to be a similar strap on Jack's right wrist in AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20425"@alsjt>20425</a>, part of Gene's Station 1 pan. The Apollo 17 packing list includes "wrist mirror" for each of them.
163:20:36|ALSJ||The cover gloves are fingerless and are worn to protect the suit glove. Gene and Jack had planned to discard the cover gloves at the end of the first EVA but, because the cover gloves were getting worn, it seemed prudent to leave them on and postpone damage to the suit gloves for as long as possible.
163:22:16|ALSJ||@alsjurl/a17/a17RTVWear20478-9.jpg"@alsjt>Details</a> from two photos of Gene taken late in EVA-3 shows, AS17-134-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20478"@alsjt>20478 and 479</a>, show an area on the hammer handle where the RTV has worn off.
163:22:16|ALSJ|CDR|I used the hammer so much that, in some spots on the handle, I literally wore off the @alsjurl/apollo.glossary.html#RTV"@alsjt>RTV</a> coating. You can surmise anything you want from that: I was squeezing it to death; or I was holding it loose and it was slipping back and forth in my hand; or whatever.
163:22:16|ALSJ||The Room Temperature Vulcanizing silicone rubber used to coat the Apollo 17 hammer handle was usually referred to simply by the acronym @alsjurl/apollo.glossary.html#RTV"@alsjt>RTV</a>. An RTV wrapping was added for Apollo 17, undoubtedly because of the problems the Apollo 16 crew had losing their grip on the hammer.
163:23:04|ALSJ||Mason jars are a brand of canning jars with rubber rings to provide the necessary airtight seal. Bob is saying that protection of the wrist seals is valuable.
163:23:04|ALSJ||Like the @alsjurl/apollo.glossary.html#RTV"@alsjt>RTV</a> coating on the hammer handle, Gene's cover gloves are very worn. He and Jack will discard their cover gloves during the Rover preps on this EVA, at <a href="a17.trvsta6.html#1634811">163:48:11</a>.
163:23:46|ALSJ||Here, Jack is putting a little pressure in his suit to keep it from collapsing around him because of breathe-down. Gene will put a little pressure in his suit at 163:24:54. The Apollo 12 crew had noted this problem in their post-mission technical debriefing and suggested this fix. Gene and Jack will fully inflate the suits for the pressure integrity check at 163:26:46.
163:23:58|ALSJ||Next, Jack will connect Gene's PLSS water hose.
163:24:06|ALSJ||And, then, Gene connects Jack's PLSS water hose.
163:25:57|ALSJ||They are now at the top of the right-hand column of Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf6-6.jpg"@alsjt>6-6</a>.
163:26:15|ALSJ|LMP|There were some gold-colored, yard-long lines connected to the utility lights and, since the clamps were outside on the fender, the lines may have been dangling. Or, I could have been referring to the LM hoses.
163:26:47|ALSJ|LMP|I will always be surprised that the suits held up as well as they did to the abuse we gave them. Just think about what we were doing and the dust environment we exposed them to. We tried to clean the bearings and plug the holes (that is, the connectors) and things like that; and they really did well, just like everything else we had in the Apollo program did better than anybody ever expected it to. And I think that just goes back to the motivation of the people who were building it and testing it and flying it. It makes a lot of difference if people believe it's the most important thing they're going to do in their lives and they don't want to be responsible for screwing it up.
163:28:12|ALSJ||Next, they will turn off the flow of oxygen into the suits so they can check for pressure integrity.
163:29:11|ALSJ||After getting out of their suits the night before, they cleaned and lubricated the zippers, seals and connectors as best they could. Under the conditions, it is not surprising that they weren't able to get everything completely clean. Consequently, there was still some dust in the connectors and mixed in with the lubricant. Jack is marveling that the suits aren't leaking more than they are.
163:29:53|ALSJ|LMP|Gene was going to lean down to get the @alsjurl/forward_hatch.jpg"@alsjt>hatch</a>. I was facing him and he wanted me to lean toward the rear of the spacecraft to maximize the room he'd have to get down. It was tough to get down there and get a hold of the hatch.
163:29:53|ALSJ|CDR|Once we had the suits up to 3.8, we moved around like tin soldiers (meaning very stiffly). 'You move a little bit, and I'll move a little bit.' From this point on, where you've got two people with the pressurized suits and the PLSSs on and the hoses on, a guy moving six inches left or right or six inches fore or aft meant a great deal to the ability of the other guy to reach something.
163:29:58|ALSJ||They are in the middle of the right-hand column of Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf6-6.jpg"@alsjt>6-6</a>.
163:30:17|ALSJ||Jack is still facing Gene. The Cabin Repress valve is on his left and the circuit breaker panel is on the wall behind him.
163:30:24|ALSJ||Jack needs to turn around to get the circuit breaker and Gene is probably leaning back to give him room to get around.
163:30:24|ALSJ|CDR|I can see in my mind Jack turning a little bit so that he could see the circuit breaker panel, and then his PLSS is hitting me right smack in the face.
163:30:49|ALSJ|CDR|Jack is getting as far over on his side (and as far forward) as he can, so that I can get back and up to get the overhead valve.
163:31:01|ALSJ||Gene is now turning to his right, putting his PLSS against the circuit breaker panel on the left wall so that he can reach up with his right arm.
163:31:01|ALSJ|CDR|The shoulder bearing really restricted your movements and I may have even been up on my tiptoes to get high enough. If we had been in a round room or a square room it might have been different. But we were in a room with all kinds of shapes and corners in our way. And we, ourselves, were very bulky and non-conforming shapes.
163:33:53|ALSJ|CDR|At five psi you might just as well have been in a block of concrete. Going down to 3.7 or 3.8 gave me a lot of flexibility that I didn't have at 5 to get down and open the hatch. When you went down to open the hatch, you're literally straining against the suit. So I didn't want to get down until my suit was down. And, also, there was no point in getting down to get it until the cabin was down enough that you could open it.
163:33:53|ALSJ||The pressure (above atmospheric) in a toy balloon is typically 1.5 psi.
163:35:10|ALSJ|LMP|One of the big issues for any kind of permanent lunar habitat is going to be dust control. And it just occurred to me that the design of the air/dust lock ought to be such that, when you depress to go out on an EVA, the air currents remove the dust you brought in the last time. Never thought of that before, and I've been dealing with this - along with a lot of other people - for a long time. I ought to patent that idea.
163:35:19|ALSJ|CDR|Once I was able to open the hatch against whatever residual pressure there was, if I didn't hold it open the pressure would slam it shut again. So I had to hold it open until the cabin relieved totally.
163:35:38|ALSJ||The regulators are normally set in the Egress position during EVA's. Evidently, Houston is having second thoughts about this regulator, which was the one that experienced the slow leak before the rest period.
163:36:47|ALSJ||Bob meant to say "high suit-loop pressures" and, hence, the confusion.
163:37:11|ALSJ||Gene is starting to turn around so that he can get down, put his feet out through the hatch and back out of the spacecraft.
163:38:11|ALSJ|LMP|There was a little bag called the 'purse' where we stowed the purge valves between EVA's.
163:38:11|ALSJ||The purse is hanging under Panel 5, directly in front of where Gene stands.
163:39:03|ALSJ|CDR|It was a strain getting out. It was easier for Jack because there was only one person and his suit's had longer to come down. I'm still at 4.3, here, with a very stiff suit.
163:39:07|ALSJ||Here, Jack is not talking louder to Bob than he is to Gene.
163:39:11|ALSJ|LMP|We had a piece of Velcro put on the inside of the helmet that we reached over and scratched our nose on. Everybody seemed to agree that you needed that. Also, the mention of the @alsjurl/a11/a11.lec.gif"@alsjt>LEC</a> reminds me of a lot of work we did - probably pre-Apollo 11 and probably Jack Small and myself, mostly - trying to devise some kind of a conveyor system to get stuff in and out of the cabin. There was some concern that it would be too difficult to carry stuff up and, at one point, we were actually trying to devise a loop one could use as a conveyor: attach something to it and then take it through a pulley. We got it so that you could do it but, in the final analysis, it was more trouble than it was worth.
163:39:11|ALSJ||The conveyor was actually used on Apollos 11 to 15.
163:40:33|ALSJ||Before the rest period, Houston had run a series of checks on the Demand Regulators to see if one or the other of them had a slow leak that would explain a slow but steady rise in the cabin pressure. During the tests, the pressure build up stopped and, as Joe Allen told the crew at 150:46:46, apparently the leak had been cured by cycling the regulators.
163:40:42|ALSJ||Gene is on cuff checklist page CDR-4. After starting a gravimeter reading, he will change the LCRU battery, getting the new battery from under his seat, where he stowed it at the start of EVA-2.
163:41:31|ALSJ||Jack is probably verifying the circuit breakers and performing his other tasks on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva3_lmp04.gif"@alsjt>LMP-4</a>.
163:41:53|ALSJ|CDR|It had become a little prayer at the start of those EVA's. I just shouted to the world, "God, bless us. Give us a shot at it." I'm beginning to think that there wasn't anything printed or written anywhere on that ladder. And if Jack doesn't recall it, it wasn't there. I think I just decided to say that when we started every EVA. Sort of like blessing the shrimp fleet.
163:41:53|ALSJ||The only sure way of knowing if the message was on the ladder or strut is to visit the expended Descent Stage at Taurus-Littrow. Gene first "reads" the message at the end of EVA-1 at 124:00:08. At the start of this EVA, Jack will take a color picture of the front of the LM and we have examined blow-ups of the hatch and ladder area. The blow-ups are quite grainy but there is nothing visible that looks anything like a note. A white spot just below the hatch is part of the normal LM hardware. At the end of this third day, Jack will take some pictures of Gene and the Apollo plaque, one of which shows considerable detail on the ladder and strut up as high as the second step below the porch. We have been unable to find anything that might be a message. The mystery remains.
163:44:00|ALSJ||The SEP temperature was 112 degrees Fahrenheit (44 Celsius) when Gene turned the unit off at 147:18:35.
163:44:06|ALSJ||Gene is asking if he can have some fun and see how far he can throw the battery.
163:44:25|ALSJ|LMP|During Apollo, the answer to Gene's question was very simple: you weren't going to go back there any time soon. But at a lunar base, any used material will have to be inventoried, catalogued, and stored in some kind of recoverable way because the value of practically any material will, because of transportation costs, be very, very high - at least until the Moon is self-sufficient and is producing it's own stuff. And that won't be for a long time. You're just never going to know when you're going to want to get something and, with a good inventory system, you can always ask 'Do I have that or something like it for refurbishment or reuse.'
163:44:25|ALSJ||There is some light static for a few minutes which ends when Gene turns on the LCRU.
163:46:33|ALSJ||TV on. Jack has probably brought the ETB over from the ladder. As per CDR-4, Gene probably left it hanging from the LEC.
163:46:55|ALSJ||@alsjurl/Fendell-Bio.pdf"@alsjt>Fendell</a> briefly picks up Jack at the gate, then pans clockwise.
163:48:25|ALSJ||The cover gloves add bulk to the hands, lessen flexibility, and hasten fatigue.
163:48:48|ALSJ||Gene can see the TV camera move as Fendell does his pan.
163:48:52|ALSJ||Fendell finds Gene leaning across his seat, pushing in the circuit breakers on the instrument panel. Gene is at the bottom of CDR-4 and Jack is taking care of the tasks on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva3_lmp05.gif"@alsjt>LMP-5</a>.
163:49:12|ALSJ||Jack goes to the SEP, behind his seat; Fendell follows him.
163:49:14|ALSJ||Jack reaches back for his @alsjurl/alsj-ValveCluster.html"@alsjt>cooling control</a> without having to do the double wave.
163:49:34|ALSJ||Gene goes to the gravimeter, which is on the ground near the LM ladder. Jack goes around the back of the Rover to Gene's seat.
163:49:56|ALSJ||The temperature at the end of EVA-2 close-out - at 147:18:35 - was 112&#186;F. The unit turns itself off when the temperature is over 108&#186;F, so they will get a little data on the traverse to Station 6 before the unit heats up again.
163:50:02|ALSJ||Gene is now on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva3_cdr05.gif"@alsjt>CDR-5</a>.
163:50:18|ALSJ||Gene arrives at the Rover carrying both the @alsjurl/alsj-dustbrush.html"@alsjt>dustbrush</a> and the big bag. The big bag has the same top cross-section as an SCB but is about twice as long and can be seen in AS17-143- <a href="images17.html#21924"@alsjt>21924</a>, taken at about 169:13. Usually, Gene opens and closes only the gate, leaving the geopallet - to which the gate is attached - fixed in place. Apparently, there is a place to mount a bag on the forward surface of the geopallet, far enough inboard that Gene can't reach it from the side of the Rover. Instead, Bob is suggesting that Gene open the pallet. Because the pallet pivots on the geopost at the right rear, Bob is urging that they watch to make sure the pallet assembly doesn't hit the replacement fender or the clamps holding it in place.
163:50:42|ALSJ||Gene is referring to the bag latches on the back of the Rover gate.
163:51:03|ALSJ||Gene goes out of the TV picture toward the front of the Rover.
163:51:13|ALSJ||Fendell pans clockwise to Jack at Gene's seat; he is putting film magazines in the seatpan, taking them from the ETB.
163:51:45|ALSJ||The magazines are marked with letters - MM, FF, and so on. At times through the mission - beginning at 118:15:29 - Jack has used girls names such as Franny for the magazines rather than the standard communications code words like Foxtrot. Bob has followed his lead but Gene won't join in the game until the end of Station 6.
163:51:46|ALSJ||Gene is having trouble getting the brush in and out of the bracket on the top of the LCRU.
163:51:52|ALSJ|LMP|I may have been thinking that we didn't want any more dust under the seat.
163:53:02|ALSJ||Fendell takes a close-up look of Jack working in Gene's seatpan. In the background, Gene swings the geopallet open.
163:54:06|ALSJ||Jack removes the roll of tape and lowers Gene's seat.
163:54:06|ALSJ||Jack takes the ETB to the MESA. Fendell follows him.
163:54:42|ALSJ||Gene goes to Jack's seat; Jack goes from the MESA to the gate. The next task listed on his checklist is a pan taken 30 feet out in front of the ladder.
163:55:33|ALSJ||Jack works on the open pallet.
163:55:40|ALSJ||Gene goes to Jack's seat.
163:56:16|ALSJ||Gene mounts a map on the holder to the right of the instrument panel. As per @alsjurl/a17/a17eva3_lmp05.gif"@alsjt>LMP-5</a>, Jack put the map on the seat when he was unloading the ETB.
163:56:16|ALSJ||If the solar flare is weak enough that the ETB offers adequate protection, the exposures experienced by the suited astronauts will be minimal.
163:56:44|ALSJ||Gene finishes mounting the map; Fendell pans clockwise to follow. Off-camera, Jack will take a @alsjurl/a17/a17pan1635650.jpg"@alsjt>12 o'clock color pan</a> with Gene's camera. These frames are AS17-140- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21359"@alsjt>21359</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21380"@alsjt>21380</a>.

163:57:45|ALSJ||Fendell pans to Gene, who is mounting sample bags on Jack's camera.
163:58:17|ALSJ||Gene reaches into Jack's seat pan for a core-cap dispenser.
163:58:25|ALSJ||Gene's checklist indicates that they had planned to put SCB-8 on Jack's PLSS at this point but, because of the mix up during the EVA-2 Geoprep, Jack wore SCB-8 during that EVA.
163:59:12|ALSJ||Gene goes to the gate; Jack goes to the cosmic ray experiment, which is hanging beyond the ladder.
163:59:23|ALSJ||Gene goes to the @alsjurl/a17/a17-TGE.html"@alsjt>TGE</a> at the LM ladder.
163:59:57|ALSJ||Gene takes the @alsjurl/a17/a17-TGE.html"@alsjt>TGE</a> to the Rover and mounts it at the right rear, behind the SEP.
164:00:27|ALSJ||These are AS17-21381 to 21384. The first two show the "Sun" component of the detector and the other two show the "Shade" component.
164:00:54|ALSJ||Jack goes to the MESA; Gene to the SEP receiver.
164:01:01|ALSJ||Fendell examines the LM.
164:01:28|ALSJ|LMP|You could dust the SEP mirrors, but you really couldn't get the dust out of the cover. So the tape wouldn't stick to the cover to hold it closed.
164:02:23|ALSJ||Fendell finds Gene at the SEP.
164:03:05|ALSJ||Jack leaves the gate; Fendell pans up to find Earth.
164:03:38|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Brian Lawrence notes that the British term for "taffy" is "toffee
164:04:18|ALSJ|LMP|I was thinking of the fine-grained, vesicular rock that Gene picked up at Shorty.
164:04:34|ALSJ|LMP|The SEP P.I.'s name was really (David) Strangway, but Bob called him 'Strangelove' (after the title character of the 1964 Stanley Kubrick film 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb')
164:04:34|ALSJ||Fendell pans down; Gene goes his seat.
164:04:34|ALSJ||Gene removes his right cover glove.
164:04:34|ALSJ||Unseen by the TV camera, Gene puts his cover gloves in a pocket on his left thigh so that he can bring them back to Earth. At this writing in early 1994, they are on display at the Kansas Cosmosphere in Hutchinson, Kansas.
164:04:34|ALSJ|CDR|They were pretty badly abraded, but not cut or torn.
164:04:34|ALSJ||Fendell pans up to find Earth again.
164:05:51|ALSJ||The lower drive tubes have a reinforced tip for driving into the ground. An extra upper would be far less useful than an extra lower, because a lower could be used to get a single core sample while an upper can only be used with a lower in getting a double core sample. The core tubes are marked with prominent L's and U's on the tops.
164:06:15|ALSJ||Fendell pans down to find Gene and Jack still at the left side of the Rover. Gene is on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva3_cdr06.gif"@alsjt>CDR-6</a> and Jack is on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva3_lmp07.gif"@alsjt>LMP-7</a>.
164:06:20|ALSJ||Gene turns to face the Rover; Jack attaches SCB-7 to the left side of his PLSS.
164:06:29|ALSJ|LMP|Gene is several inches taller than I am and reaching up to that level was tough in the suit.
164:06:29|ALSJ||An alternate interpretation is that, with Gene in a hole and Jack on a little rise, Jack is above Gene slightly and is laying claim to the title. Certainly, this would be in character. The TV camera angle makes this a difficult call.
164:07:11|ALSJ||Gene goes to the gate; Jack follows and presents his right side.
164:07:48|ALSJ||They are behind the gate; Jack is working on the right side of Gene's PLSS.
164:07:48|ALSJ|LMP|All the equipment was on the back of the Rover, so that's where we stood. And, unfortunately, that meant that we did most of this Geoprep work out of sight. It's too bad we didn't think about that.
164:08:29|ALSJ||They are thirty-six minutes into the EVA.
164:08:45|ALSJ||Gene gets the rammer from the gate; Jack presents his left side.
164:09:11|ALSJ||They go to Jack's seat; Gene gets the core caps and stows them in a pocket on Jack's SCB.
164:10:01|ALSJ||This is a flat, metal warning flag - painted with diagonal white and red stripes - which pops up when one of the battery temperatures exceeds 125&#186;F or one of the drive motors exceeds 400&#186;F. The flag can be reset by pushing it down and will not pop up again unless the other battery (or one of the drive motors) exceeds it's temperature threshold. Previously, the crew was told that Rover engineers at the NASA Space Flight Center concluded that the batteries would be no reason for concern at battery temperatures less than 140&#186;F.
164:10:27|ALSJ||Gene wants to take Jack's picture with the U.S. flag in the background and then have Jack return the favor. Jack returns to the Rover; Fendell pans counter-clockwise toward the SEP transmitter site.
164:10:41|ALSJ||Gene's pictures of Jack are AS17-140- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21385"@alsjt>21385</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21386"@alsjt>21386</a>, and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21387"@alsjt>21387</a>. Frame 21386 is the best of the three and shows Jack's checklist, sample bags, and his LRV Sampler. Journal Contributor Yuri Krasilnikov notes that, as can be seen in a @alsjurl/a17/Earth21386det.jpg"@alsjt>detail from 21386</a>, Earth can be seen reflected in Jack's visor in all three of these photos and in the four of the similar photos of Gene.
164:10:41|ALSJ||TV off. Gene is handing Jack the CDR camera so that the picture will be in color. He is asking if Jack can use the CDR camera while wearing his own.
164:11:16|ALSJ||Jack's pictures of Gene are AS17-140- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21388"@alsjt>21388</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21391"@alsjt>21391</a>. They show Gene's RCU, the "red apple" at the end of his purge valve release cable, his right thigh pocket, and his left calf pocket. A @alsjurl/a17/a17det21391.jpg"@alsjt>detail</a> from 21391 shows the OPS activator on the left side (from our perspective), the label at the lower right for the push-to-talk switch, and the camera mount attachment hardware at left center.
164:12:55|ALSJ||Gene is now on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva3_cdr07.gif"@alsjt>CDR-7</a>. Jack has left for the SEP transmitter. He is on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva3_lmp07.gif"@alsjt>LMP-7</a>.
164:13:30|ALSJ|LMP|My guess is that I wanted them to record or time my running motion as I was going out to the SEP transmitter.
164:13:48|ALSJ||At the end of EVA-2 at 147:42:11, Gene turned the LCRU off and lost comm with Houston. The problem was Houston's and, here, Gene is just making sure.
164:13:59|ALSJ||Jack removed his cover gloves at about 163:48:27 and Gene took his off, on-camera, at 164:04:58.
164:14:08|ALSJ||Gene is trying to read a decal affixed to the console. It has a list of Rover start-up procedures.
164:14:31|ALSJ||During the SEP transmitter deployment at the end of EVA-1, Jack had found that the wire springs that normally hold the two side solar panels open and flat weren't going to do their job. He and Gene then used grey duct tape on the backs of the panels to hold them open. Here, Jack is reporting that, while the side panels aren't lying perfectly flat, the loss in electrical power will be negligible. Jack takes a stereopair of the transmitter, AS17-141-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21510"@alsjt>21510</a> and 21511. Note the tape along the upper edge with both ends of the tape not adhering, probably because of dust picked up from Jack's glove fingers as he held the tape.
164:15:01|ALSJ||Training photo @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#72H1410"@alsjt>72-H-1410</a> shows Jack at the SEP transmitter.
164:15:16|ALSJ|CDR|It was pretty obvious to me that I wasn't rolled ten degrees, and I just ignored it, I guess.
164:15:45|ALSJ||The "Sun shaft device" is the Sun-shadow instrument mounted on the console. With the shadow falling on the zero mark, Gene has the Rover pointed directly away from the Sun and, because the Sun's position at this moment is accurately known, Bob can give him an accurate heading so that he can correct any drift in the Nav system. Note that Gene hasn't initialized the Nav system since the start of EVA-2.
164:16:21|ALSJ|CDR|Cross City was a VOR station west of Gainesville Florida. Tyndall is near Panama City. We flew that way from Cape all the time. Patrick (Air Force Base near the Cape), Cross City, Tyndall, and whatever to Ellington (Air Force Base in Houston). That's why I remembered the heading. I used to have that flight plan engraved in my brain.
164:16:50|ALSJ||Next, Gene will re-orient the Rover so that he is headed north and is within 5 meters of the north arm and 10 meters of the transmitter. He seems to have been west of the array when he did the Nav initialization. If so, then he will be driving into the Sun as he approaches the transmitter and will have some trouble seeing.
164:17:22|ALSJ||These are the cable reels for the SEP transmitter antenna wires. During deployment of the antenna array, Gene and Jack dropped the reels at the ends of the arms to serve as markers.
164:17:49|ALSJ|CDR|I had to physically look back. The mirror wouldn't have given me that kind of view.
164:17:49|ALSJ||The two ways of looking back are to turn the Rover or to raise up in the seat and turn the suit enough to be able to see. Gene doesn't think he turned the Rover at this point but, rather, raised himself up to look.
164:18:17|ALSJ||The bag actually contains two samples: 70290 and 70295. The latter rock is, by far, the larger and, in the @alsjurl/a17/a17psr.html"@alsjt>Preliminary Science Report</a>, is described as a "dark matrix breccia".
164:18:17|ALSJ|LMP|You would expect to see fine-grained basalts at the top of the subfloor because of the higher cooling rates; and the paucity of fine-grained samples probably was the result of our being in a cluster of fairly large craters - enough of them that the majority of material thrown out of them was the coarser-grained material from the interior of the presumably thick flow where the cooling was slow. We ultimately found a few, but there just weren't very many. So, not only was the top of the flow the first to be pulverized (which, if all the fragments were ground down into regolith, would contribute to the lack of fine-grained samples), but they were further diluted by the excavation of these large craters that some people think were part of a ray from Tycho.
164:18:38|ALSJ|CDR|This is a particularly good example of me talking louder to Bob than to Jack. It was a habit I had the entire time on the lunar surface. It was almost as if, because they were further away, I almost had to shout - that Earth was so far away that I wanted to make sure they could hear me. They probably didn't even need a radio to hear me.
164:18:38|ALSJ||Now that Gene is parked, he is zeroing the distance and range counters while Jack takes a picture of the transmitter and the Rover for use by the experimenters.
164:18:38|ALSJ||Jack's photos are AS17-141- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21512"@alsjt>21512</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21517"@alsjt>21517</a>.
164:18:38|ALSJ|CDR| @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21513"@alsjt>21513</a>, is an impressive picture to me. You've got the antennas pointed low over the South Massif to give you an idea how low to the horizon the Earth was. And I guess what really impresses me is that the Rover is so big in the forefront and yet, unless you have an appreciation for how big the LM is, you have no sense of how far away it is. You've got the SEP and the LM in the picture and, frankly, unless you know what you're looking at, you can't judge sizes very well. There are some boulders in the picture that appear to be farther away than the LM, so they must be really big.
164:18:38|ALSJ|LMP|This picture is a pretty good illustration of how, even just this far behind the LM, the material kicked up by our feet is almost the same albedo as the undisturbed soil. This contrasts with what you can see ahead and to the left of the LM, which is an area which was significantly lightened.
164:19:05|ALSJ||The low-gain antenna has a pointing indicator which, when it matches the Rover heading, indicates that the antenna is pointed at Earth.
164:20:17|ALSJ||A sketch traverse map is shown (identically) on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva3_lmp08.gif"@alsjt>LMP-8 and CDR-8</a>. As with the prior traverses, Gene and Jack have identical checklist pages. The feature named "Jones" is a cluster of small craters about one kilometer south of the large crater Henry and slightly west. Jack named it for John-Paul Jones, the Scottish-born naval hero of the American Revolution. Unlike other features names which are typed in the checklist maps, this one is written in by hand, although not by Jack.
164:20:32|ALSJ||Note that this sample location is not indicated on the checklist map. It is, however, listed in the traverse text on LMP/CDR-9. The location relative to the planned landing spot is 192/1.6 and the 7 degree difference in bearing is a result of Houston's estimate that SEP transmitter is 200 meters east of the planned location. The actual distance is 260 meters.
164:20:45|ALSJ|CDR|(laughing as he thinks about it) - This was probably the first time Jack said "Excuse me" since we got assigned to the crew! Record that for posterity. Obviously, old Twinkletoes, when he jumped on the Rover, probably almost knocked me out (of the Rover). I'm sure that's what happened. But I got even. When I drove on the sides of hills, I always put him on the bottom side. Always! On every hairpin turn, we went around with him on the bottom side.
164:21:57|ALSJ|CDR|We were supposed to drive parallel to the antenna lead and I probably got too close to it and it was easy enough to do a 360 (degree turn and go back) and do it again.
164:23:08|ALSJ||This is the large, unnamed feature north of the SEP.
164:23:09|ALSJ||Gene is referring to a Poppie-sized crater on the northwest rim of the unnamed crater. It is not @alsjurl/a17/a17.site.html#Rudolph"@alsjt>Rudolph</a>.
164:23:37|ALSJ||It is a little curious that no one has yet told them that Houston thinks they landed just north of Poppie. Bob will, however, tell them in just a few moments.
164:23:39|ALSJ||Meriwether Lewis and William Clark explored the drainages of the Missouri and Columbia Rivers in the years immediately following the 1803 Louisiana Purchase. The pair of craters named for them is about a kilometer NW of the current Rover position.
164:24:34|ALSJ||Houston now has them accurately located. Bob is referring to the contour map on the back of the 1/25000 traverse map labeled "NE Sheet", meaning the northeast of four maps showing the area around the LM. If he is giving them a LM location, it is quite accurate. The "little crater" is the unnamed, shallow feature north of the actual SEP location.
164:24:39|ALSJ||Jack will collect the fine-grained rock between the SEP and the LM at @alsjurl/a17/a17.trvlm3.html#1691501"@alsjt>169:15:01</a> as they approach the LM at the end of the EVA. This is sample 70215 and, unlike the sample in 45 Yankee, it is a fine-grained basalt. Jack's photos taken during this first part of the traverse are AS17-141-21519 to 21541 ( @alsjurl/a17/a17trv21519-41.pdf"@alsjt>22 Mb PDF</a> ).
164:27:47|ALSJ||The checklist location of the sample stop is 192/1.6.
164:27:55|ALSJ||Jack is referring to an exchange at 146:03:30 during the inbound drive from Shorty, when Bob invented the acronym GLPBC for the glass-lined, pit-bottom craters.
164:29:54|ALSJ||Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21533"@alsjt>21533</a>, is a representative photo showing the North Massif. A @alsjurl/a17/a17lbl21533.jpg"@alsjt>labeled version</a> shows the dark boulder and the Station 6 boulder. A @alsjurl/a17/a17det21533.jpg"@alsjt>high-resolution detail</a> focuses on Station 6.
164:33:19|ALSJ||The cross-slope track was made by the Station 6 boulder. There will be more discussion at 164:44:11. The Station 6 boulder is visible in AS17-141- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21533"@alsjt>21533</a>. As indicated in a @alsjurl/a17/a17lbl21533.jpg"@alsjt>labeled version</a>, it is just above the near horizon about halfway between the center of the image and the righthand edge. They are currently about 2 kilometers from the base of the mountain and, at that distance, the 10-degree separation of fiducials corresponds to 350 meters on the mountain.
164:33:24|ALSJ||This boulder is sometimes called the 'dark' boulder. It was photographed with the 500 mm camera from the LM during EVA-1. The photo is @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21991"@alsjt>21991</a>. The dark boulder also appears in @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21543"@alsjt>21543</a>, as indicated in a @alsjurl/a17/a17lbl21543.jpg"@alsjt>labeled version</a>.
164:33:33|ALSJ|CDR|In listening to Jack's descriptions in here while I'm driving, he's doing an excellent job. For someone who can't remember a great deal about it - about the craters and boulders - it brings a very descriptive picture to my mind. Jack, being the geologist, was better equipped to describe this stuff. But, boy, as you can tell from some of the comments, driving takes your full concentration. Every once in a while I could make a comment about something; but, once you start looking around - and you're moving at 6 or 8 or 10 kilometers per hour - peripherally you don't have the contrast to see obstacles and holes and craters. They don't stand out. They blend into the countryside and you've got to be looking for them or you don't see them. So you learn very quickly that you don't go rubbernecking as you drive. Everywhere you go - and it doesn't just have to be while you're in a boulder field - there's a hole or a pit or a rock or something. And, to some degree that may limit my recall because I was narrowly focused on a path and on a direction and on a destination. Jack, on the other hand, could back off and look at the big picture. And that was a good situation. You had two people, with one looking at the big picture and one getting you there. And it explains why don't I remember Turning Point Rock when I do remember taking the pan at Tracy's Rock (at Station 6, see below). There, I remember how steep that hill was; I remember having to crawl up that hill; and I remember having to watch my footing as I was taking the pan. That, I remember. I was taking in the big picture then. But I don't have any impression of driving up to Turning Point Rock or to Tracy's Rock. I was probably intent on driving and I don't have any recollection about any of this until I got off the Rover. The only exception is that I do recall the boulder tracks because I could drive and take a moment to look at those.
164:33:33|ALSJ||The large boulder at Station 6 is known in the scientific literature as Split Boulder. For reasons explained at 165:28:58, others know it as Tracy's Rock.
164:33:44|ALSJ||Jack's photos of the approach to the sample area are AS17-141- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21542"@alsjt>21542</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21543"@alsjt>21543</a>. Training photo @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#72H1227"@alsjt>72-H-1227</a> shows Jack using the sampler from his Rover seat.
164:33:44|ALSJ||Jack's two photos of the approach to the sample site are combined in a PDF document ( @alsjurl/a17/a17trv21542-49.pdf"@alsjt>8 Mb</a> ) with 21544 to 549, showing the climb to the top of a rise where they get their first look into Henry Crater.
164:33:58|ALSJ||The handle on the @alsjurl/a17/ap17-KSC-72PC-411.jpg"@alsjt>LRV Sampler</a> is too long for Jack to conveniently remove the cup so he will swing the cup end around in front of Gene so that Gene can remove the cup, seal it, and drop it in the SCB mounted on the accessory staff in front of them. Gene's "locator" is @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21392"@alsjt>21392</a>. Jack's corresponding photo is @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21544"@alsjt>21544</a>.
164:34:43|ALSJ|CDR|We had the low-gain antenna lead velcroed to the staff and that may have come off.
164:34:43|ALSJ||Because there is no evidence of a cable in the way of Jack's picture taking, it seems likely that the lead is getting in the way as Gene puts LRV sampler bags in the SCB on the accessory staff.

164:37:27|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Doug Bennett points out that, in pre-2009 versions of the Journal, a boulder on the near horizon near the center of 21456 is incorrectly identified as Turning Point Rock (TPR).

164:40:32|ALSJ||Henry, like Camelot, is about 600 meters across. The blocks extend 200 meters beyond the rim.
164:40:32|ALSJ||AS17-141-21554 to 21556 show this ejecta and the next part of the traverse.
164:40:45|ALSJ||Locke is 100-meter crater on the northwest rim of Henry. At the moment, Gene and Jack are driving by a smaller crater about 200 meters south of Locke and right on the west rim crest of Henry. Jack's size estimate is quite good.

164:41:46|ALSJ||Turning Point Rock is visible in overhead photographs taken from both the Apollo 15 and Apollo 17 Command Modules. It is about 400 meters NNE of Locke. The navigation readout there will give an excellent indication of LM location because of the very well-defined location of the rock and the fact that they haven't driven far enough for there to have been any substantial drift in the navigation system.
164:42:09|ALSJ||Jack's photos taken during the approach to Turning Point Rock are AS17-141- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21560"@alsjt>21560</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21563"@alsjt>21563</a>.

164:44:35|ALSJ||Based on the length of it's shadow in the overhead photograph, Turning Point Rock is comparable to the LM in height - 23 feet or 7 meters - in close agreement with Gene's six-meter estimate below. Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21564"@alsjt>21564</a> is taken as they go east of the boulder.
164:45:16|ALSJ||The checklist location is 192/2.9. Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21565"@alsjt>21565</a> is taken at about this point. See the discussion at 164:47:52.
164:45:31|ALSJ|CDR|That's big! I'm obviously impressed with how big it is. Jack says 'Gee, that's a big rock;' and all of a sudden I'm counting 'One, two, three...' All of a sudden I'm eighteen feet high! That's a big rock. And I hate to admit it, but I just cannot picture that rock in my mind. Now, the color pictures I took (AS17-140-21396 to 21398) do bring back some memories. And it may be that I remember because we'd stopped to take the pictures.

164:47:34|ALSJ|LMP|From my description, it sounds like Turning Point Rock was the same kind of rock as the north half of the Split Boulder (at Station 6). That boulder was two kinds of rock: a vesicular breccia that had intruded a blue-grey breccia. My first instinct here was to call it a vesicular breccia (@alsjurl/a17/#1644457"@alsjt>164:44:57</a> and @alsjurl/a17/#1644636"@alsjt>164:46:36</a>), and then I backed off from that.
164:47:34|ALSJ||Jack discusses the relationship between Turning Point Rock and the Station 6 boulder in a comment after @alsjurl/a17/a17.sta6.html#1653552"@alsjt>165:35:52</a>.
164:48:06|ALSJ||Because Turning Point Rock is almost due north of the landing site, the bearing gives a very good east-west position for the SEP transmitter. The two-degree difference in bearing is equivalent to a 100-meter east-west position difference at a 3-km range. In general, if the planned bearing and range at any particular place was Qp and Rp, respectively, and the actual values are Qa and Ra, then the position differences between the planned SEP location and the actual location are<BR> Dx = Ra sin(Qa) - Rp sin(Qp)<br> and<br> Dy = Ra cos(Qa) - Rp cos(Qp).<br> Here, a positive Dx indicates an eastward displacement of the actual SEP site and a positive Dy indicates a northward displacement. The following table (format by Joe O'Dea) lists estimated displacements for the reasonably-well-defined places visited during EVAs 2 and 3.</i><br> <b> Location Rp(km) Qp Ra(km) Qa Dx(km) Dy(km)</b><br> Hole-in-the-Wall<i> 5.5 80 5.7 81 0.21 -0.06</i><br> Station 2<i> 7.2 68 7.6 71 0.51 -0.22</i><br> Station 3<i> 5.6 87 6.0 87 0.40 +0.02</i><br> Station 4<i> 4.1 101 4.4 102 0.28 -0.13</i><br> Victory Crater<i> 2.8 107 3.2 106 0.28 -0.06</i><br> Station 5<i> 1.2 88 1.4 86 0.20 +0.06</i><br> Turning Point Rock<i> 2.9 192 2.8 186 0.31 +0.05</i><br> Station 6<i> 3.2 198 3.1 192 0.34 +0.01</i><br> Station 9<i> 2.3 235 2.2 230 0.20 -0.09</i><br> <b>Averages</b><i> 0.30 -0.05</i><br>Readers interested in some of the details of the table should note that, while doing the Nav initialization at the start of EVA-2, Gene read a heading of 283. With the sunshaft device properly zeroed, the heading should have been 282. Houston decided that the difference was too small to justify any heading correction. If there was an error of one degree, then all EVA-2 values of Qa would have to be increased by one degree and, for most of the EVA-2 stations, this would produce about a 100 meter increase in Dy and, for the over-all average, an increase of Dy to 10 meters north. However, it is not clear in the transcript whether Gene followed Houston's advice or, rather, torqued to the new heading. Similarly, we can't be certain that the sun-shaft device was perfectly zeroed, etc. If nothing else, these considerations emphasize the potential uncertainties in position measurements made with the Apollo LRV navigation system. For present purposes, I note that the displacement of the actual SEP site from the planned site is 260 meters east and 60 meters north, compared with 300 meters east and 50 meters south for the table averages. These discrepancies are comparable with those observed by the Apollo 15 and 16 crews. As anticipated, the best estimates come from the closest stations: Victory, Station 5, Turning Point Rock, Station 6, and Station 9. The averages for those stations are 0.26 and -0.01. It is a bit surprising that the north-south result isn't a little better. In detail, the planned SEP site was 100 meters east of the planned landing point or 150 meters west and 50 meters north of the center of Poppie. From the overhead picture, we know that the LM is actually 100 meters north of Poppie; and, from images of the LM obtained from the SEP site and from the Rover bearing readouts, we know that the SEP transmitter is about 140 meters east and 60 meters north of the actual landing spot or 140 meters east and 120 meters north of the center of Poppie.
164:48:06|ALSJ|CDR|260 meters out of 250 thousand miles ain't bad! They ought to give you that much leeway.
164:48:23|ALSJ||Gene's photo is @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21399"@alsjt>21399</a>. Station 6 is the apparent pair of boulders beyond the large foreground boulder. Jack takes a similar picture, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21569"@alsjt>21569</a>, at about this time. David Harland has assembled a @alsjurl/a17/a17.image169.jpg"@alsjt>trio</a> of frames which show Turning Point Rock (left image) and the Station 6 Split Boulder (right image). In the right-hand image, Split Boulder is just above center at the left side of the image. The center image of the trio is centered on Split Boulder.
164:48:55|ALSJ||They are now on the lower slopes of the North Massif, with presumably little or none of the gabbroic lava beneath them.
164:49:08|ALSJ||Jack's photos taken during the approach to Station 6 are AS17-141-21570 to 21574. Two of the major fragments of the Station 6 boulder are labeled in frame @alsjurl/a17/a17-21571lbl.jpg"@alsjt>21571</a>. See, also, @alsjurl/a17/a17psrf6-14.jpg"@alsjt>Figure 6-14</a> from the Apollo 17 @alsjurl/a17/a17psr.html"@alsjt>Preliminary Science Report</a>, which is a plan view of the Split Boulder.
164:49:41|ALSJ||They are angling upslope, with Jack's side down, as usual.
164:49:41|ALSJ|CDR|Here we have the responsibilities of command, again. Always watching out for your crew. And Jack deserved every minute of it. And I'll tell you one thing, I got myself on the downslope a couple of times and in one-sixth gravity...I won't say it's uncomfortable; but the Rover is so free to move, so free to bounce, that it seemed if you so much leaned an arm out you'd tip over. The slopes got very noticeable. Now, on a 45 degree slope, sometimes, you'd think you were going straight up. I compare it to bombing runs. You could be in a 60 degree run and you'd absolutely know that you were going straight down at 90 degrees. You always tend to overestimate your angle. If you were looking for a 30 degrees bombing run, you might be at 15 and think you were at 30. And it was the same way here. A 15 or 20 degree slope can be awfully steep when you're on it.
164:50:34|ALSJ|LMP|I didn't know what I was going to see on the other side of the block at this point, so I told them that we could work in the shade. You got quite a bit of diffuse light, particularly on a down-Sun face because the Sun backscatters directly on it. You can see pretty well, as some of the photos show.
164:51:03|ALSJ||There has been little apparent degradation of comm during this bit of maneuvering. Evidently, Houston has been reading them through the LM. They have now parked at Station 6.
|ALSJ||The Station 6 boulder is actually comprised of five large pieces, as shown in a plan view (@alsjurl/a17/a17psrf6-14.jpg"@alsjt>Figure 6-14</a>) from the Apollo 17 @alsjurl/a17/a17psr.html"@alsjt>Preliminary Science Report</a>. The five fragments are pieces of a large rock which, long ago, tumbled down the North Massif. The story behind the alternate name of the boulder - Tracy's Rock - follows 165:28:58. A labeled version of Jack's pan frame AS17-141-@alsjurl/a17/a17-21596lbl.jpg"@alsjt>21596</a> shows the fragments from the west.
164:51:40|ALSJ||Because of the slope, neither Gene - who has to get off the Rover on the uphill side - or Jack - who has to get off on the downhill side - is having an easy time dismounting.
164:52:40|ALSJ|CDR|Even the pan I took from up above Tracy's Rock doesn't really show you the slope; but the comments do. And we were parked cross slope, pointed roughly east, because they wanted us pointed 107. I had to get off uphill, and it was really pretty hard to get off. Jack said he almost rolled to the bottom of the hill. It was almost like parking in San Francisco, except we were parked side slope. Now, when we got back on, it was just the opposite: it was very difficult for him to get on and it was very easy for me. We might have wanted to park uphill or downhill, but we parked at their heading for battery cooling.
164:52:40|ALSJ||On Apollo 15, at Station 6a, Dave Scott and Jim Irwin also parked on a steep slope and, in that case, they decided to have Irwin stay with the Rover so that he could hold on to it in case it started to slip.
164:52:40|ALSJ|CDR|Working on hillsides wasn't something that you couldn't handle. Let's face it, you're on the Moon, it's a new environment, and all of a sudden you're on a hill. It wasn't something that you didn't expect. It's like you get on an airplane and you go to San Francisco and you sort of know what to expect. But you go and park on one of those hills and you still say "Wow"! In one sense, we were trying to relate to the people who were listening what we were confronted with, because they couldn't see any of it.
164:53:11|ALSJ||TV on.
164:54:02|ALSJ||At various places in the transcript and in post-mission documents, there are references to the slope being 11 degrees or 20 or more. Grant Heiken, editor of the <a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/books/lunar_sourcebook/"@alsjt>Lunar Sourcebook</a>, provides the following from a 2006 reading of the Apollo 17 Professional Paper: "Upper slopes of the massif, 20 to 30 degrees; lower slopes, including Station, 6 to 11 degrees. In and around the largest Station 6 boulder, slopes vary all over the place, from 11 over a broad area, to 20 where the regolith is pushed up around the boulder. I'm not sure what the rover was rated to do but 20 degrees is very difficult or even impossible for a vehicle on Earth, in spite of the SUV television commercials. Thought that would put a new slant on things.
164:54:02|ALSJ||As indicated in a 1972 Boeing document, @alsjurl/a17/A17_LunarRover2.html"@alsjt>Apollo 17 LRV Technical Information</a>, the Rover was designed to handle slopes of up to 25 degrees. As all the Rover crews noted, speeds dropped considerably on slopes.
164:54:06|ALSJ||Jack discusses the evolution in his thinking about this boulder in a comment following 165:35:52.
164:54:36|ALSJ||Gene backs a step or two from the Rover and has to lean about 20 degrees into the hill to stay erect. @alsjurl/Fendell-Bio.pdf"@alsjt>Fendell</a> pans the TV counter-clockwise.
164:54:47|ALSJ|LMP|I had worked out a rule of thumb that the glass color was indicative of composition. The glass in anorthosite - feldspar - was translucent white; and if you have any amount of @alsjurl/apollo.glossary.html#mafic"@alsjt>mafic minerals</a> at all, you're going to get darker color to black. I think that, right here, I'm mouthing off, getting my bearings, and don't really have things sorted out as yet.
164:54:47|ALSJ||Mafic minerals are usually dark colored and rich in magnesium and iron.
164:55:21|ALSJ|LMP|The flattened vesicles indicate that the rock was flowing while it was molten, but was still too stiff to allow the vesicles to take a spherical shape." See AS17-141- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21629"@alsjt>21629</a>
164:55:50|ALSJ||Fendell pans by the boulders east of the Rover and finds Jack on the north side of the north boulder, dwarfed by it and standing in the shadow.
164:56:04|ALSJ||A north overhang offers a chance of sampling soil which has been continuously shielded from the Sun.
164:56:58|ALSJ|LMP|Because of Shorty, they were thinking that another fairly dark, fresh-looking crater (Van Serg) might have some volcanic material around it. Of course, when we got there, it was just another impact crater into a very thick regolith with some dark-mantle material in its wall. As I recall - and we'll see - we never used the short can there. I don't recall.
164:56:58|ALSJ||Jack is examining the west face of the north boulder.
164:56:58|ALSJ|LMP|I was close to it to see better in the shadow, to keep my eyes out of the Sun.
164:57:06|ALSJ||Jack has moved around to examine the southwest face of the north boulder, which is in shadow because of an overhang. There is a spot of sunlight reflected onto the rock off of Jack's visor. He now moves south.
164:58:46|ALSJ||Jack moves to the west face again.
164:59:08|ALSJ||Gene is dusting the left-side battery covers; Jack moves north west of the Rover to take the pan.

As indicated in a @alsjurl/a17/a17det21598.jpg"@alsjt>detail</a> from 21598, these pictures show Henry on the right, Shakespeare in the center, and Cochise on the left. Each of these three craters is about 500 meters across.
165:00:19|ALSJ||Gene stows the @alsjurl/alsj-dustbrush.html"@alsjt>dustbrush</a>, gets his tongs and attaches them to his yo-yo with a small clip that fits onto the shaft. His yo-yo is attached to the hoses just above his left hip.
165:00:35|ALSJ||Gene moves to the rear of the Rover, uncovering Jack who is well up slope, taking the pan. In order to aim the camera for each exposure in the series, Jack bends his knees, his feet behind him, bounces up onto his toes, and arches his back.
165:00:53|ALSJ||Jack's visor is up and his face is clearly visible. Fendell zooms in on him. His feet are hidden by the near rim of the crater in which he is standing.
165:01:38|ALSJ||Jack moves farther away from the Rover, deeper into the crater. He is visible only from the waist up. He turns to the southeast.
165:01:38|ALSJ||Jack climbs out of the crater and moves cross slope, angling uphill and to the east.
165:02:33|ALSJ||Gene moves uphill and east.
165:02:33|ALSJ|CDR|It's not just walking uphill that's difficult, it's walking sidehill, too. In one-sixth gravity your stability changes and you need a new approach. You have to work at it a little harder.
165:02:33|ALSJ||Jack is standing in the middle of the boulder track, manipulating the scoop and a sample bag. In contrast with the problems he had at Station 3, Jack isn't having any particular difficulty doing solo sampling and pours soil into the bag with relative ease.
165:02:33|ALSJ|LMP|(Laughing) My hands must not have been tired. And you learn how.
165:03:00|ALSJ||Jack leans his stomach on the scoop handle. Gene is at the shadowed, northwest corner of Fragment 2, the boulder immediately north of the east-west split.
165:03:03|ALSJ||That is, it would be hard to see fragments that fall in the shadow area.
165:03:14|ALSJ||Jack has joined Gene at the north boulder; Jack puts his gold visor up, again.
165:03:28|ALSJ||Jack stands uphill of Gene and puts the sample in Gene's SCB.
165:04:00|ALSJ||Gene moves south; his gold visor is up also. Then, he pulls it down.
165:04:14|ALSJ||Jack follows Gene to the split.
165:04:17|ALSJ||Gene has been looking at the west face of the north boulder and Jack wants him to work the north face of the south boulder.
165:04:41|ALSJ||At the surface, the two boulder fragments are separated by about three or four feet. Jack tries to pass Gene to the north. Gene takes a couple of small steps closer to the south boulder, rests his hand on it, and creates a space big enough for Jack to pass.
165:04:46|ALSJ|CDR|The video of our work at this station really shows what it takes to work on a slope in the confines of a pressure suit. You can see that our movements are totally different than they were on the flat and level ground. If you start stepping downhill, your center of gravity shifts. You could hear me talking about leaning over the Rover to dust things. If you do it from the top side, you're going to fall down over the Rover. If you do it from the bottom side, you can't quite reach that far. And, if you do it cross hill, you've got a similar problem. I think this whole station is a good example of working in a sloped environment in one-sixth gravity. You don't have boulder fields to trip over, but you've got an undulating, sloped surface you're trying to work on. I haven't seen this in a long time. You look at the TV picture and the bodies are all cocked at 15 or 20 degrees. It's totally different from anything else we've seen. Now, granted, the Rover is on a slope as well and that probably accentuates it. But the combination of the TV and our comments really tell the story.
165:04:58|ALSJ||Gene steps back to take the pictures, bumping his PLSS against Fragment 4, the north boulder. Gene's photos are AS17-140- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21401"@alsjt>21401</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21404"@alsjt>21404</a>.

165:04:58|ALSJ||Jack's down-Sun is AS17-141 @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21604"@alsjt>21604</a> while @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21605"@alsjt>21605</a> is his "locator" to the Rover. Note the dirt on Gene's feet and legs.
165:05:39|ALSJ||Gene briefly raises his gold visor and then puts it down again.
165:05:42|ALSJ||Jack has moved a little east and now leans way under the north-facing overhang, supporting himself with his left hand on the boulder while he uses the scoop in his right hand and leans far forward.
165:05:42|ALSJ|LMP|I was trying to get as far under the boulder as I could.
165:05:56|ALSJ||Gene is holding the bag while Jack tries to pour in soil from the scoop, a difficult operation because of the stiff suit arms. Jack wants him to hold the bag lower to make the pouring easier.
165:05:56|ALSJ|CDR|I wasn't holding it in a way to make it difficult for him, it was just suit restriction. You seek out the most convenient and least restrictive positions while reaching out far enough and low enough. From his point of view, it would have been most convenient if I got down on my knees and held the bag, but only if I could have stayed there for ten minutes. But you take a sample and then you move ten feet; you take another sample and then you move again. So, unless he's going to go back and forth, you have to move together and you both have to be on your feet. It's a compromise.
165:06:10|ALSJ||Jack hops uphill to the east of Gene, while Gene turns to keep the sample bag in position.
165:06:10|ALSJ|LMP|I'm surprised that, with me moving like that, the soil stayed in the scoop. And I was reaching upslope some, so it was a tough maneuver.
165:06:38|ALSJ|LMP|There is more TV coverage at this station than I thought. I had forgotten that we had sampled together for a while. What I remember is being alone, working on the contact between the two breccias (the vesicular and non-vesicular materials described at 164:57:06) while Gene was taking some pans.
165:06:38|ALSJ||Jack scoops a sample just outside the shadow, leaning on the boulder again with his left hand. The scoop mark on the ground is very reflective.
165:07:00|ALSJ||Jack collects the second sample, then stands still while Gene puts the bagged first sample in his SCB.
165:07:17|ALSJ||Jack pours the soil into the bag and presents his SCB.
165:07:59|ALSJ||The gnomon staff is inclined about twenty degrees, pointing north and indicating just how much of a slope they are contending with. Gene is hammering on a protrusion on the south boulder at about shoulder height. He hits it a dozen times.
165:08:15|ALSJ||Gene's "after" pictures are AS17-140- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21405"@alsjt>21405</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21406"@alsjt>21406</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21407"@alsjt>21407</a>, and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21408"@alsjt>21408</a>.
165:08:15|ALSJ||Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21409"@alsjt>21409</a> is a "locator" to the Rover. Note the slope relative to the flat valley floor.
165:08:44|ALSJ||In order to reach down for the gnomon, Gene comes forward on his toes to keep his PLSS centered as he bends his knees.
165:08:44|ALSJ|CDR|It was just easier to bend my knees like a guy with a bad back might do. It was just easier to bend my knees to let my arms down low enough. You learn very, very quickly. The human being is very adaptable. You don't have to think about those things; you just do it. Somehow, that computer up above your neck just picks out the easiest approach.
165:08:44|ALSJ||They move off to the east behind the boulder, going gingerly and apparently downhill.
165:09:15|ALSJ||Gene comes into view, backing up to take pictures of the south boulder. His photos at this location are AS17-140- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21410"@alsjt>21410</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21411"@alsjt>21411</a>, and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21412"@alsjt>21412</a>.
165:09:22|ALSJ||Gene takes the last of the "before" photos, AS17-140- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21411"@alsjt>21411</a> and then turns to take the "locator", @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21412"@alsjt>21412</a>.
165:09:31|ALSJ||Jack's down-Sun is AS17-141- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21607"@alsjt>21607</a>. The frame shows Gene standing slightly closer to the Rover, having just taken his "locator", @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21412"@alsjt>21412</a>.
165:09:37|ALSJ||Fendell pans up, then looks at the soil in the split.
165:09:56|ALSJ||The sample is @alsjurl/a17/a17-Samp76015.html"@alsjt>76015</a>, a 2.8 kilogram piece of vesicular melt breccia.
165:09:56|ALSJ||Gene's flightline photos of the northeast faces of Fragments 4 and 5 are AS17-140- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21413"@alsjt>21413</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21433"@alsjt>21433</a>.
165:09:56|ALSJ||Fendell tilts the TV camera up to watch Gene doing a flightline stereo in the split.
165:11:17|ALSJ||Gene moves behind the south boulder. Jack follows, using the scoop as a cane in his right, uphill hand. His PLSS remains visible until Fendell pans away. Otherwise they are both out of view for quite a while.
165:11:40|ALSJ||Gene's photos of the sunlit portion of Fragment 2 are AS17-140-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21434"@alsjt>21434</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21440"@alsjt>21440</a>.
165:11:40|ALSJ||Frames @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21436"@alsjt>21436</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21438"@alsjt>21438</a> are examples.
165:11:40|ALSJ||The relevant checklist pages are @alsjurl/a17/a17eva3_lmpcdr10.gif"@alsjt>LMP/CDR-10</a> and @alsjurl/a17/a17eva3_lmpcdr11.gif"@alsjt>LMP/CDR-11</a>. The fact that neither of them has even glanced at their checklists at this station - and rarely do so at most of the other stations as well - is an indication of just how well prepared the J-mission (Apollos 15, 16, and 17) crews were. None of them depended very much on the geologic portions of their cuff checklist because they understood the geologic objectives and also were prepared to make real-time decisions - with input from Houston - on the tasks to be performed. Only when they got to a station could they know what was going to be important and, when one compares the mode of operation of these crews versus the first three crews, the difference is striking. Of course, on the first three flights - particularly Apollos 11 and 12 - geology was of secondary importance compared with the main task of flying the LM. The J-mission crews all had the advantages of training as backup crews on a landing mission and then could devote as much as 40% of the training for their own missions to geology and the other scientific tasks. In addition, with three 7-hour EVAs at their disposal - compared with two 4-hour EVAs - and with the mobility of the Rover to give them a greater variety of geology stops to explore, real-time decisions made more sense. The mission planners recognized this by including only generic tasks in the checklists. Nonetheless, here at Station 6, Jack and Gene are operating more independently than they or any other crew operated during all of the Apollo surface operations. Houston is making almost no suggestions, confident that with 45 minutes budgeted for this station, Jack and Gene won't miss anything important. In a few moments, at 165:14:44, when Jack takes a moment to get his thoughts organized about what they want to do at this station, Bob will summarize for them the objectives listed on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva3_lmpcdr11.gif"@alsjt>LMP/CDR-11</a>; but, basically, Jack will ignore him.
165:12:03|ALSJ||This sample is @alsjurl/a17/76215.pdf"@alsjt>76215</a>, a 644 gram vesicular impact melt breccia. One side of the sample is the inner wall of a large vug or cavity. @alsjurl/a17/a17ppf146.jpg"@alsjt>Figure 146</a> from @alsjurl/a17/a17ppsta5-6.pdf"@alsjt>USGS Professional paper 1080</a> shows the sample location at the east point of Fragment 6. A @alsjurl/a17/a17det21607Sample76215.jpg"@alsjt>detail</a> from Jack's down-Sun photo AS17-141-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21607"@alsjt>21607</a>, taken at @alsjurl/a17/#1650925"@alsjt>165:09:25</a> shows the piece of spall next to the gnomon. At @alsjurl/a17/#1651002"@alsjt>165:10:02</a>, Jack told Bob, "There's a big spall lying on the ground here (next to the gnomon) that has been knocked off up there, from right on top of the boulder. @alsjurl/a17/a17ppf158.jpg"@alsjt>Figure 158</a> in the Professional Paper is a detail from Gene's photo AS17-140-21416, showing the source site for the 'big spall'. A @alsjurl/a17/a17det21416Sample76215Source.jpg"@alsjt>high-resolution detail</a> from the recent scan from the original film shows the same area circled and also highlights an adjacent, vertical face that looks like it might be associated with the "big spall' they found next to the gnomon. Mike Gentry at NASA Johnson has provided a high resolution scan of LRL photo @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#S7333506"@alsjt>S73-33506</a>.
165:12:03|ALSJ||In the video clip, we see the gnomon rod next to the base of the boulder. The rod appears tilted about 20 degrees to the left because of the slope the Rover is sitting on. At about 2:08 after the start of the clip, Jack moves to our right, going out of sight from our vantage point. At 2:23 in the clip, we get a glimpse of what may be Jack's right hand, probably as he raises the scoop so he can grab the 'piece of that spalled rock that was sitting by the gnomon' with his left hand so he can get a bag open with his right hand. Jack clearly didn't collect all of the 'big spall'. @alsjurl/a17/a17ppf159,jpg"@alsjt>Figure 159</a> in the Professional Paper identifies the in-situ location of 76215 as part of the 'big spall'.
165:13:56|ALSJ||With the astronauts out of sight, Fendell makes a close-up examination of the shadowed @alsjurl/a17/a17psrf6-116.jpg"@alsjt>west face of Fragment 4</a> and then does a site panorama. During his examination of the shadow, Fendell is looking directly up-Sun. Clearly, the amount of sunlight reflected off the surrounding regolith is sufficient that, once Fendell zooms in enough that all sunlit surfaces are excluded from the field-of-view, the camera's auto-iris has no trouble producing a good view of into the boulder face.
165:14:32|ALSJ||That is, Gene is having to lean forward to maintain his balance and, as a result, his camera is pointing into the hill. In order to get a picture, then, he would either have to lean back or take the camera off the RCU bracket.
165:15:39|ALSJ|LMP|It's fairly clear from the tape that, during this period when Bob was taking to us, it was the wrong time because he made it difficult for us to talk to each other and we were trying to get some sampling done. And that's probably why I was fairly short, responding with just an 'Okay'. Now, I suspect we continued to work while he was talking; I don't think we stood around. Of course, I'm not sure when would have been a good time to interrupt us. (Laughing) Even though we asked the question, we probably didn't want an answer.
165:15:39|ALSJ|CDR|I want to emphasize the point. We never stood around and listened. We never stopped doing what we were doing. We could listen while we were taking a pan or getting a sample or whatever it was.
165:16:13|ALSJ||Jack is discussing Fragment 1. See the @alsjurl/a17/a17psrf6-14.jpg"@alsjt>Station 6 plan view</a>.
165:16:39|ALSJ||Being high up the slope, they can easily distinguish craters on the valley floor.
165:16:39|ALSJ||Jack's photos of the inclusions at the southeast corner of Fragment 1 are AS17-141 @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21608"@alsjt>21608</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21609"@alsjt>21609</a>. Fragment 1 is on the righthand side of 21608 and Fragment 2 is beyond Gene. See the @alsjurl/a17/a17psrf6-14.jpg"@alsjt>Station 6 plan view</a>. Note that they have note positioned the gnomon color chart and grey scale pointing up-Sun but, rather, toward Jack.
165:16:39|ALSJ||Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21610"@alsjt>21610</a> is the "locator" to Henry.
165:16:39|ALSJ||Gene's photo of Fragment 1 is AS17-140- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21441"@alsjt>21441</a>.
165:17:10|ALSJ||Jack's close-ups are AS17-141- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21611"@alsjt>21611</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21612"@alsjt>21612</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21613"@alsjt>21613</a>, and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21614"@alsjt>21614</a>.
165:17:44|ALSJ||Fendell is looking at Henry Crater. There are boulders clearly visible in the south wall. Gene is taking a series of close-ups, which are AS17-140- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21442"@alsjt>21442</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21455"@alsjt>21455</a>.
165:17:49|ALSJ||That is, the sample would fall out of the scoop.
165:18:18|ALSJ||Fendell is looking at the South Massif. The tilt of the horizon gives a good indication of the extreme Rover tilt.
165:19:43|ALSJ||Jack is referring to the last boulder he sampled at Station 2.
165:19:45|ALSJ|LMP|A good layman's translation of 'aplitic' is a coarse, sugary texture - like raw sugar.
165:19:57|ALSJ||Jack may take AS17-141- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21615"@alsjt>21615</a> about here.
165:21:28|ALSJ|LMP|I was trying to get a sample in Gene's SCB and he must have been upslope of me. So I probably handed it to him so that he could put it in my SCB.
165:21:37|ALSJ||The last sample taken - at 165:19:08 - was put in bag 556 and the one prior to that - at 165:12:03 - went in 535. There is discussion in Houston about the possibility of a misread bag number.
165:21:37|ALSJ|LMP|They would have asked us if it wasn't right but, probably, one bag came from one side of the pack and one from the other.
165:22:10|ALSJ|LMP|-"The boulder didn't split along the contact, largely because the vesicular breccia (which is referred to here as 'vesicular anorthositic gabbro') was intruded as partially-molten material. It was hot enough to metamorphose about a meter of the blue-gray breccia it intruded. You could tell that because there were small vesicles - which indicate some partial melting - in that contact zone which then died out as you got away from the contact.
165:23:01|ALSJ||The combination of a high Sun angle and the difficulty of working on the hillside makes this one of the few times that either of them uses the high cooling setting.
165:23:48|ALSJ||Jack has probably fallen.
165:24:21|ALSJ||Fendell finds Earth by panning to the low-gain antenna on the Rover and then following its pointing.
165:25:14|ALSJ|LMP|I don't know what this was, unless my watch band was coming loose or something like that.
165:26:35|ALSJ||Fendell finds Jack east of Fragment 2.
165:26:37|ALSJ||Gene's flightline of Fragment 1 consists of AS17-140- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21456"@alsjt>21456</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21481"@alsjt>21481</a>.
165:26:37|ALSJ||Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21475"@alsjt>21475</a> shows the soil on the upslope shelf of fragment 1, which Gene will sample at about 165:28:42. A @alsjurl/a17/a17-21475lbl.jpg"@alsjt>labeled version</a> identifies Fragments 1 and 2.
165:26:47|ALSJ||Jack is looking at the southeast corner of the north boulder, almost "treading" sand to keep his balance on the slope. He may be taking photos AS17-141- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21616"@alsjt>21616</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21620"@alsjt>21620</a>.
165:27:18|ALSJ||Someone in Houston notices that the bottom of Jack's SCB seems to be loose.
165:27:24|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Dean Eppler calls attention to a work ( @alsjurl/a17/Apollo17DarcyCartoon.jpg"@alsjt>270k</a> ) by Pulitzer Prize winning Newsday political cartoonist Tom Darcy (1933-2000) which sums up the problem that some journalists had covering the first lunar visit by a professional geologist.
165:27:49|ALSJ||John Young and Charlie Duke visited House Rock at the rim of North Ray Crater on EVA-3 of Apollo 16. It was the largest lunar boulder sampled by any of the crews. It was literally the size of a good-sized house, being about 12 meters high, 25 meters long and about 20 meters thick. The @alsjurl/a17/a17psrf6-14.jpg"@alsjt>Station 6 boulder</a> consists of five large fragments of what was once a single boulder about 6x10x18 meters. For comparison, Turning Point Rock is about 6 to 7 meters high and Geophone Rock is 3 meters high.
165:28:05|ALSJ||Bob waits to get a recommendation from the Backroom but, getting no prompt answer, makes the decision himself.
165:28:58|ALSJ||Out of sight of the TV camera, Gene gets the sample and takes the "after", which is AS17-140- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21482"@alsjt>21482</a>. As indicated in a @alsjurl/a17/a17-21482lbl.jpg"@alsjt>labeled version</a> of the "after", Gene stepped to the northeast corner of @alsjurl/a17/a17psrf6-14.jpg"@alsjt>fragment 1</a>, put his left hand on the dust-covered shelf to support himself, and reached out as far as possible toward the center of the dusted area and swept the bag twice from his right to his left, leaving furrows and, at the lefthand end of each furrow, a small mound of dust where he stopped. Later, at about 165:33:38, Gene will take a panorama from higher up the hill which will also show the mark left in the dirt where he took the sample. A labeled detail from frame AS17-140-@alsjurl/a17/a17-21496lbl.jpg"@alsjt>21496</a> shows the sample location, the area on the shelf probably disturbed by his left hand, and the area on the ground between fragment 1 and the foreground rock that he disturbed while taking the sample and earlier, at about 165:25:48, the flightline.
165:28:58|ALSJ|CDR|I haven't seen the rock from this perspective in nearly nineteen years. My hand print really shows you how big the rock is and, in @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21482"@alsjt>21482</a>, you can see across to the South Massif and the Scarp. The Scarp looks small in this photo, but I remember how big it was (80 meters) because we went up it.
165:28:58|ALSJ||The patch of dirt on the north face of the boulder is the subject of a painting by Apollo 12 astronaut Alan Bean. Bean took up a career as a professional artist after he left the Astronaut Corps and, in the years since, he has developed a considerable reputation as a space artist. As a result of the particular painting in question, those who know the story call the Station 6 boulder "Tracy's Rock". @alsjurl/a17/a17.s72_51687.jpg"@alsjt>Tracy</a> is Gene's daughter, who was nine years old at the time of the mission.
165:28:58|ALSJ|CDR|It was on this part of the rock that Al Bean wrote "Tracy", my daughter's name, in one of his paintings. After we came home I started to see a picture of the boulder in lots of places. It was the picture of Jack going past the corner of the rock (@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21496"@alsjt>21496</a>), one of the pictures from my pan. It became very popular. One day Al Bean came by and said he was doing a painting of it. And it was a big painting, six feet by three feet or something like that. Al likes to have stories in his paintings and he wanted to talk about it. So we talked about the slope and how hard it was to climb up there and I said that, if I'd known the picture was going to get so much notoriety, I wished I would have done something that I hadn't even thought of at the time. And that is to have printed Tracy's name in the dust. Al's daughter Amy and Tracy had grown up together and he asked 'How would you have done it'. So I wrote it out on a piece of paper and, some time later, he called and wanted me to come over and look at what he'd done. He had erased the place where I'd taken the sample and had put in Tracy's name, instead. And in the little story he put with the picture, he said that he'd done it to save me the trouble of going back to do it myself, and to save the taxpayers the expense of sending me back.
165:28:58|ALSJ||Jack leaps upward about a foot, kicking his heels back briefly before he lands.
165:28:58|ALSJ|LMP|I was having trouble getting up to exactly where I wanted to be to look at the boulder.
165:28:58|ALSJ|CDR|I can't see why a geologist would jump up and down in the air like this except to show his enthusiasm over finding a new and different rock. And, all joking aside, it really looks like he's trying to get closer to the rock and the slope made it hard to move.
165:28:59|ALSJ||Jack walks slowly uphill, leaning into it, knees dramatically bent. His SCB is clearly loose. Bob makes a misidentification.
165:30:03|ALSJ||While facing more or less north, leaning into the hill, and using the scoop in his left hand as a cane, Jack leans far enough forward that he can grab a fist-sized rock off the ground.
165:30:26|ALSJ||While Jack examines the bagged sample, Gene hops into view from behind Fragment 2. Jack seals the sample bag by grasping the ends of the metal sealing strip, flipping the bag over it, and then folding in the ends of the strips.
165:31:02|ALSJ||Jack is having a difficult time reaching Gene's SCB. Because of the slope, if Jack is to reach the top of Gene's SCB, they have to be standing on virtually the same hill contour. Gene can stand facing uphill, leaning into the hill, but Jack has to face him and lean sideways into the slope. Jack's right leg is fully extended downhill, and his left leg is bent at the knee.
165:31:02|ALSJ|LMP|Plus, he's taller than I am. That was always a problem.
165:31:29|ALSJ||Jack presents his SCB by turning to face uphill and using the scoop as a cane.
165:31:49|ALSJ||Whatever adjustments Gene mad to Jack's SCB, he didn't secure it at the bottom.
165:31:50|ALSJ||Gene moves east of the Fragment 2; Jack examines Fragments 4 and 5 while he listens to Bob.
165:33:03|ALSJ||Jack moves west, going downslope a little and out of the TV picture.
165:33:18|ALSJ||According to my <a href="http://www.m-w.com"@alsjt>Merriam-Webster</a>, "gung-ho", meaning "extremely or overly zealous or enthusiastic" came into use by U.S. Marines in about 1942 and was derived from the short version of the Chinese name for the Chinese Industrial Cooperative Society.
165:33:30|ALSJ||Fendell finds Gene beyond Fragment 2 and, out of sight, Fragment 1.
165:34:01|ALSJ||Gene @alsjurl/alsj-ValveCluster.html"@alsjt>switches his cooling</a> and then starts the pan. Jack crosses the TV picture, headed east to get the gnomon. This is the reason he appears in Gene's pan.

165:34:01|ALSJ||In frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21493"@alsjt>21493</a>, we see the rake sitting out, ready to be used, to the right of the Traverse Gravimeter, which Gene put on the surface not long after he and Jack arrived at Station 6. See, also, a @alsjurl/a17/a17lbl21493.jpg"@alsjt>labeled detail</a>.

165:34:01|ALSJ||In frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21496"@alsjt>21496</a> we see Jack headed for the Rover with the gnomon, which he has just retrieved for use at the rake site.
165:34:01|ALSJ||Patrick Vantuyne has used portions of 21494 to 21497 to create a red-blue anaglyph ( @alsjurl/a17/a17rb21494-7.jpg"@alsjt>474</a> ).

165:34:01|ALSJ||Journal contributor Bob Fry notes that @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21498"@alsjt>21498</a> shows @alsjurl/a17/as17det21498lbl.jpg"@alsjt>Van Serg and its dark ejecta blanket</a> on the far side of Shakespeare. Compare with a @alsjurl/a17/a17.site-n2lbl.jpg"@alsjt>detail</a> from Pan Camera frame 2309.
165:34:01|ALSJ||In frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21501"@alsjt>21501</a> we get a good view up-Sun into the gap between the Sculptured Hills and the East Massif.
165:34:01|ALSJ||Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21504"@alsjt>21504</a> shows the view toward Station 7. However, as indicated in an accompanying @alsjurl/a17/a17station6-7.html"@alsjt>discussion</a>, the Station 7 boulder is hidden by intervening terrain and/or boulders.
165:34:01|ALSJ|CDR|You really had to lean to get the horizon in the pan. And I don't think I was able to get the uphill pictures.
165:34:01|ALSJ||Fendell pans clockwise away from Gene to look for Jack. Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21489"@alsjt>21489</a> shows the Scarp.
165:35:18|ALSJ||A @alsjurl/a17/a17.2309tlhr.jpg"@alsjt>portion of Pan Camera frame AS17-2309</a> shows the South Massif at the upper right and the Sculptured Hills at the lower left. The North Massif is at the bottom right and Henry Crater is the rightmost of the three large craters in a triangular pattern at the foot of the mountain. South is up and Station 6 is on the flank of the North Massif slightly north and east of Henry.
165:35:20|ALSJ|CDR|I wish I'd climbed to the top of the mountain to get even a better view. But, even where we were it was a much better panorama than we got from the Scarp. We couldn't see much from the Scarp. Over here, we could see everything: Challenger, the Scarp, the Sculptured Hills, and everything. I do remember this. It was fantastic - like coming over a hill and getting a look into a great big valley somewhere in the middle of Idaho.
165:35:20|ALSJ||Fendell pans back to Gene, who is leaning way back to shoot uphill photos.
165:35:20|ALSJ|LMP|In order to find a level place, Gene went to a crater and stood, not in the bottom, but on the downslope wall which would be nearly level.
165:35:31|ALSJ|LMP|This examination of the boulder shows the evolution of my thinking as I was getting new information. The final impression that I had - which was born out by the samples - was of a blue-gray breccia intruded by - or enclosed by, we don't know which - vesicular, tan-gray material which also turned out to be a breccia. Now, when I first approached the boulder, the vesicles and crystals I could see in the matrix around them led me down the path of thinking that I was looking at a truly igneous rock. And it had not occurred to me yet that I might be looking at an impact breccia that got hot enough to melt. And it took the whole time of examining it - until right at the last - before I came to the correct conclusion. At the last, I saw the vesicles in the contact zone which pretty well confirmed it all. It took a while to work that through and to get away from thinking that I was looking at an igneous, anorthositic gabbro that had caught up pieces of other things. Normally, a field geologist would sort all those multiple working hypotheses as you go along and then eventually come to a conclusion. And that's what you write down. But here, what we see is a large part of my thinking process being verbalized. If we had had to stop after the first few minutes, we would have had all the wrong answers.
165:35:31|ALSJ|LMP|My guess is that the vesicular breccia was produced in the Serenitatis impact, that it was injected downward into the crust and then migrated back up along fractures in the ejecta. And, in that context, the blue-gray breccia may be pre-Serenitatis - who knows, perhaps Tranquillitatis ejecta or something like that. We'd seen the same blue-gray rock at Station 2. There was tan-gray breccia at Station 2 but that wasn't vesicular. Probably, the first place we saw the tan, vesicular breccia was at Turning Point Rock and, again, I was thinking there in terms of it being igneous.
165:36:31|ALSJ||Gene moves downhill, going down into the boulder track and then back out. He uses a hopping gait, but with his right foot forward about six to ten inches.
165:36:43|ALSJ||Gene trips and falls to his hands and knees, apparently without hitting the camera on the ground. He came over a small mound - possibly a crater rim - and, as he came off the mound, caught his trailing left foot, started to tilt sideways over his right foot and lost his balance.
165:36:43|ALSJ|CDR|I had some speed coming down, even though I was coming cross slope. It was so hard to get up there and so easy to come down, so I was moving. I was coming cross slope because, to come straight down, I probably would have gone head over heels. You couldn't come straight down that hill very fast. It's like skiing. If you go straight down, you're really going to motor. So you've got to shallow up the slope. But I got off balance, got on one leg, and fell into the hill. When I was watching this just now, I thought I was going to roll; but I didn't. I kept my balance pretty well. And I've got to tell you, agility goes along with the responsibility of command; and, to prove the point, I can only refer you to the help I received in getting that deep core out of the ground back on EVA-1.
165:36:43|ALSJ||Gene is, of course, reminding us of Jack's spectacular fall at 121:01:05.
165:37:02|ALSJ|LMP|(Laughing) That's a bad habit of mine. When people ask me to remind them to do something, I'll say it right then so I'm not held responsible for remembering.
165:37:02|ALSJ||Gene shifts position so that his feet are downhill. He then pushes back with his hands to get up on his knees and, as his PLSS rotates past the point of his knees, he rises to his feet.
165:37:04|ALSJ||Gene continues on his way, using the same gait at the same speed. Fendell does not follow him and, rather, starts a clockwise pan of the site.
165:37:04|ALSJ|LMP|By this third EVA we were very confident. We didn't worry about falling. Maybe we should have, but we didn't. What I want to know is how come he didn't get kidded about that fall like I got kidded about the fall at Ballet. That's just as spectacular.
165:37:13|ALSJ||AS17-141- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21621"@alsjt>21621</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21622"@alsjt>21622</a>, and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21623"@alsjt>21623</a> are cross-Sun "befores" of the rake site and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21624"@alsjt>21624</a> is a down-Sun.
165:37:16|ALSJ|LMP|This was an expression out of the old 'Fibber McGee and Molly' radio program.
165:39:17|ALSJ||One of the larger rocks in this rake sample is Sample 76535, a 155 g piece of Troctolite. On page 137 in the @alsjurl/a17/A17SampleCat_4.pdf"@alsjt>Catalog on Apollo 17 Rocks, Volume 4 - North Massif</a>, published in August 1994, Charles Meyer comments that "Troctolite 76535 is without doubt the most interesting sample returned from the Moon. It is a colorful, pristine, coarse-grained, plutonic rock that has had a slow cooling history ... Heroic effort have been made to date troctolite 76535, Most recently, Fremo and Tatsumoto have ... concluded that it was formed between 4.23 and 4.26 b.y. (billion years)." In an article published in in the 19 January 2009 issue of Science, a team of MIT researchers report clear evidence that, at the time, 76535 formed, it was imprented with a strong magnetic field produced by a rotating, liquid lunar core. According to an @alsjurl/a17/http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2009/moonrock-0115.html"@alsjt>MIT press release</a>, the field was about 1/50th the strength of the Earth's current magnetic field.
165:40:21|ALSJ||Fendell's pan crosses the back of the Rover. Neither Jack nor Gene is in sight. They are probably due west of the Rover, hidden by the gate.
165:40:28|ALSJ|CDR|(Smiling) I didn't want to let Jack use the hammer because I was afraid he'd hurt himself.
165:40:41|ALSJ||There is a discussion in Houston about having Gene do the 500-mm photography because of his longer arms. Jack apparently had had some trouble handling the 500-mm during training.
165:41:14|ALSJ||AS17-141- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21625"@alsjt>21625</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21626"@alsjt>21626</a>, and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21627"@alsjt>21627</a> are Jack's cross-Sun "afters". Note the tongs in 21625.
165:41:16|ALSJ||Fendell begins a counter-clockwise site pan.
165:41:30|ALSJ||That is, Jack will have to brace himself in order to steady the 500-mm camera to shoot upslope.
165:41:56|ALSJ||The 'lower' core sections have reinforced tips but, at this site, the soil is soft enough that one of the 'upper' sections could be used without fear of damage, thereby conserving the supply of lowers.
165:41:56|ALSJ|LMP|Obviously, I didn't remember what the core tube count was.
165:42:01|ALSJ||Gene rounds the front end of the Rover, apparently in a controlled skid.
165:42:01|ALSJ|CDR|I was just sidestepping as I was coming around the Rover, sidestepping to slow down and turn. By this time I was long familiar with operating in the suit, and I appreciated the slope I was on. So I just turned and sort of sidestepped into where I wanted to stop.
165:42:26|ALSJ||Fendell finds Jack at Gene's seat, 500 mm camera in hand. The rammer and core caps - among other things - are visible on the left side of his PLSS.
165:42:35|ALSJ||Jack goes east from the Rover; the lens cap is off.
165:43:32|ALSJ||Fendell pans the TV clockwise. Off-camera, Gene is taking the scoop off of the extension handle so that he can attach the handle to the core.
165:43:52|ALSJ|CDR|It was difficult to shoot uphill, because you couldn't lean back very far. So I suggested that Jack lean against the rock.
165:44:07|ALSJ||Jack passes in front of the south-looking TV; he is going east. Fendell reverses direction to follow him.
165:44:48|ALSJ||Fendell finds Jack against the west face of the north boulder, leaning his PLSS against it for stability while he aims the 500 uphill to the northwest. His SCB is loose again. Jack's first series of pictures, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#Sta6BoulderSource"@alsjt>of the source outcrop for the Station 6 boulder</a>, consists of frames AS17-139- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21186"@alsjt>21186</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21193"@alsjt>21193</a>. Comparison with photos taken at the LM allow identification of individual boulders in the source region and, in an enhanced portion of the mini-pan, the upper part of the boulder track.
165:45:27|ALSJ||Jack adjusts the camera and then takes a few more pictures.
165:45:27|ALSJ||Jack tries to point the camera higher.
165:45:27|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Syd Buxton has used frames AS17-140-21490-93 from Gene's pan to create a locator (@alsjurl/a17/A17Schmitt_Stn_6_500mm_Loctr-Full_Res.jpg"@alsjt>7 Mb</a> or @alsjurl/a17/A17Schmitt_Stn_6_500mm_Loctr-Third-Res.jpg"@alsjt>0.7 Mb</a>) for the four sets of 500-mm images Jack is about to take toward the west and south.
165:45:27|ALSJ||Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21195"@alsjt>21195</a> is undoubtedly an accidental shot showing the near surface. Frames @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21194"@alsjt>21194</a> and 21196 show Shorty Crater (Sta. 4). Note the out-of-focus rake head, sticking up from the back of the Rover, at the lower left in both frames. The prominent boulder on the fllank of the South Massif beyond the center of Shorty has been indentified in a detail from LROC image M104311715L. See a discussion in the 21194 caption in the A17 Image Library. Like the Station 6 boulder, the 21194 boulder came to rest when it encountered a much shallower slope near the base of the mountain. Buxton has combined 21194 and 21196 with 21206 and 21207 to create a mini-pan (@alsjurl/a17/a17pan1654626&1654931_Stn3&4_sgb.jpg"@alsjt>7 Mb</a> or @alsjurl/a17/a17pan1654626&1654931_Stn3&4_LoRes_sgb.jpg"@alsjt>0.3 Mb</a> showing both Shorty Crater and Lara Crater. Station 3 was done a short distance east of the near rim of Lara.
165:45:27|ALSJ||165:45:27|ALSJ||Frames 21197 to 21202 were shot in the direction of Station 2. Buxton has created a mini-pan (@alsjurl/a17/a17pan1654626&1654931_Stn3&4_sgb.jpg"@alsjt>7 Mb</a> or @alsjurl/a17/a17pan1654626&1654931_Stn3&4_LoRes_sgb.jpg"@alsjt>0.3 Mb</a>.
165:48:01|ALSJ||Fendell pans the TV counter-clockwise, away from Jack who is still shooting pictures west toward Stations 2, 3, and 4.
165:48:06|ALSJ||Fendell reaches the counter-clockwise stop without finding Gene. Fendell reverses direction and pans clockwise. He finds Jack, now shooting pictures toward the south.
165:48:23|ALSJ||They are two hours and fifteen minutes into the EVA. AS17-139- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21203"@alsjt>21203</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21204"@alsjt>21204</a>, and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21205"@alsjt>21205</a> are Jack's pictures of the LM. Station 6 is about 3.1 kilometer from the LM, which is about 7 meters tall. The two craters beyond the LM with prominent rim boulder fields may be the east (left) and west (right) components of Trident.
165:48:23|ALSJ||Gene's core tube photos are AS17-146- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22291"@alsjt>22291</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22292"@alsjt>22292</a>.

165:48:23|ALSJ||Fendell finds Gene downslope of the Rover. He has the core in hand and is leaning forward into the slope. He has taken a couple of pictures of Jack, still taking 500's from against the rock. These are @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22293"@alsjt>22293</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22294"@alsjt>22294</a>.
165:50:01|ALSJ||Jack's portrait of the @alsjurl/a17/a17pan21208-211.jpg"@alsjt>South Massif summit</a> includes frames AS17-139- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21208"@alsjt>21208</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21209"@alsjt>21209</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21210"@alsjt>21210</a>, and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21211"@alsjt>21211</a>.
165:50:13|ALSJ||Gene climbs to the Rover, taking short, choppy steps; it is a difficult climb. His picture of the empty hole is @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22295"@alsjt>22295</a>.
165:50:13|ALSJ|CDR|I didn't have to go very far, so I came straight up. It would have been really tough in Earth gravity, but in one-sixth gravity at least we could hop and get fairly good distance. I'm getting maybe a foot with each hop, just like hopping up some steps on two feet, step by step by step.
165:51:29|ALSJ||Gene takes the extension handle off the core; then turns north to see what Jack is doing.
165:51:31|ALSJ||Gene replaces the rammer on the left side of Jack's PLSS.
165:52:11|ALSJ||Gene is re-attaching the scoop to the extension handle.
165:52:42|ALSJ||Jack steps back and uncovers Gene, who is leaning far forward, into the hill, to punch the @alsjurl/a17/a17-TGE.html"@alsjt>TGE</a> button. "I'm sneaking up" is a joking reference to one of the Apollo 16 experiments. At one of the stops on their second EVA, Young and Duke collected a soil sample with a tool that looked a bit like a man's wallet mounted at the end of a meter-long handle. The wallet-like part could be opened, exposing a patch of cloth. The idea was to approach a meter-high boulder from the direction of the LM, moving as slowly as possible to avoid kicking soil onto the sampling site, and then reach over the boulder and press the cloth patch on the surface beyond the rock. In principle, the very top layer of soil, protected by the rock from LM effluents, would be caught on the cloth. The final step was to close the wallet to protect the sample. Duke had a great deal of fun describing the scene to Houston as Young was "sneaking" up on the chosen boulder; and this is Gene's reference.
165:53:18|ALSJ||Here, Jack goes to take a quick series of close-up pictures of the flattened vesicles. These are AS17-141- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21628"@alsjt>21628</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21630"@alsjt>21630</a>.
165:53:36|ALSJ||Fendell pans the TV clockwise.
165:54:28|ALSJ||They have to open the gate to get at the big bag.
165:54:43|ALSJ||Gene is having trouble opening the gate. The latch is fouled with dust.
165:55:30|ALSJ||Jack's sample is 76055, a 18x20x25 cm, 6.4 kg, tan-grey breccia. See post-flight photo @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#S7315713"@alsjt>S73-15713</a>.
165:55:32|ALSJ||While Jack puts 76055 in the big bag, he is asking Gene for a sample bag to hold another, smaller sample, 76335.
165:56:20|ALSJ||This is sample 76335, a very friable (breakable), 500 gram anorthosite. By the time the sample got back to earth, the largest piece was 8 x 6.5 x 5 cm. The approximate locations from which Jack collected 76055 and 76335 are shown in @alsjurl/a17/a17smpcat4f4.jpg"@alsjt>Figure 4</a> from the Apollo 17 Sample Catalog, Part 4 ( @alsjurl/a17/A17SampleCat_4.pdf"@alsjt>30 Mb PDF</a> ).
165:56:20|ALSJ||Fendell finds the LM; the lighter-gray surface discoloration caused by the descent engine is obvious and the LM is a black and white dot at it's center. The dot is black on the west; white on the east.
165:56:30|ALSJ||Parker has a foot switch so that he can speak to Gene and Jack. Normally, he releases the switch when he is talking with the Flight Director but, here, is leaving the switch depressed.
165:56:59|ALSJ||Fendell finds Jack, who is raising his seat so that he can stow the drive tube. Had the gate swung open, they might have lost some tools. Later in the EVA, during their drive back to the LM from Station 9, that is exactly what will happen. The gate will swing open and they will lose both extension handles along with the rake and scoop. Gene takes a couple of pictures of Jack. These are @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22296"@alsjt>22296</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22297"@alsjt>22297</a>. Note that Jack's gold visor is up and, therefore, we can see him in the suit. The seismic charge transporter is at the top of the geopallet, directly above the rear wheel. We can see the LRV sampler on the far side of the console and Gene's seatbelt stowed against the near side.
165:57:21|ALSJ||Jack gets his seat belt out of the way by draping of it over the Rover SCB.
165:57:56|ALSJ|LMP|I think we're both sounding tired after working on this slope. There isn't as much joking as when we first got there. We're quieter.
165:58:15|ALSJ||The Rover is rolled about 20 degrees - with Jack's side down.
165:58:22|ALSJ||As noted previously, Jack's gold visor is up. His helmet remains facing the TV camera through all of this, but he turns his head about 60 degrees to look downhill to the south.
165:58:37|ALSJ||Jack extracts the sampler, which is stowed vertically next to the control panel.
165:58:47|ALSJ||Jack starts downhill; Gene leans over the right-side battery covers.
165:59:01|ALSJ||Gene wants to get a large rock that they can use in the close-out ceremonies back at the LM. The plan is to split the rock into dozens of pieces for distributions to museums around the world. See 169:43:06.
165:59:13|ALSJ||Gene goes around the front of the Rover; Jack has only gone a few feet to the southeast.
165:59:29|ALSJ||Fendell finds Gene standing a few feet south, examining the Rover. Jack is beyond him, moving diagonally across the slope and toward the southeast.
165:59:29|ALSJ|LMP|One of the things that bothered me physically was doing a lot of sidehill traversing at Station 6. On going east on the south-facing slope for some distance, the inside ligament on my left leg began to feel fatigued because the right leg was so much down and the left leg was so much up. Most of the stress was on the left leg, and it is the same ligament that I had damaged skiing years before in '58 or '59; and I suspect that that was the reason for that. It was a pretty bad pull and, after it recovered, I never felt it again except for going sidehill right in this part of the traverse. I started to tire and I could feel that ligament. It wasn't bad, but I could tell it wasn't normal.
165:59:29|ALSJ|CDR|About five or six weeks before the flight, we were playing softball and I pulled my planteres (a small calf muscle associated with the Achilles tendon). I was running between second and third base and I thought somebody had hit me in the bottom of the right leg with a machete. And I just doubled up. I was on crutches for about a couple, three or four days. If it was ripped, I was done (that is, off the flight). It was strained or pulled but not ripped, I guess, and I had some great concern as to whether the doctors would consider it recovered enough for me to fly. But I guarantee you that, less than a week after I was off the crutches I was in a suit doing EVA training. Hurting like hell. And I really wondered how it would be on the Moon. When we did go, I could feel it the whole time I was doing some of these things, but never to the extent that it either hobbled me or cut down my mobility. It just hurt. It had healed very, very quickly and I'm not so sure...And it sounds a little crazy; but I think part of your physical well-being depends on your mental well-being. And I'm not so sure that, mentally, I didn't want to fly that flight so bad that it either healed faster or I didn't know it hurt. There were times during the surface activities that I did feel it; but I don't remember feeling a thing during the stuff we've just gone through at Station 6. Also, it's possible that, subconsciously, the injury may have influenced my choice of hopping and skipping rather than Jack's long, loping stride. When you were hopping, you had to plan on maintaining a special kind of balance each time you came down, but you had two feet supporting you all the time. I'm not sure, but maybe I did hop to make my leg feel more comfortable.
165:59:39|ALSJ||Gene moves the TV to its stowed position.
166:00:17|ALSJ||The remainder of this EVA was reviewed with Gene and Jack, together, in Santa Fe, New Mexico in September 1991.
166:00:17|ALSJ|CDR|I'd like to reminisce with Jack - a little bit - because, for what it's worth, we're sort of authenticating history, nineteen years later. It wasn't until Eric and I sat down in my office and watched the films and listened to our voices that I recalled the steepness of that slope at Tracy's Rock. Because Al Bean painted the picture, I've seen the hill a million times; but, in the years since we were there, I've never fully appreciated that you and I were walking at an angle on the side of the hill and that getting on and off the Rover was typical of the problems it caused.
166:00:17|ALSJ|LMP|I think it was one of the USGS (U. S. Geological Survey) guys who said that it was a twenty degree slope where we were parked. And there was a break there. The boulder probably hit and broke when it hit that break in slope and, above us, it was probably 25 or 26 degrees.
166:00:17|ALSJ|CDR|I recall climbing up there to do that pan, and being way above you. And I think this is important so that people can know what your ability is to maneuver around on slopes. And I don't think anyone else ever really encountered...I don't know what they did on Apollo 14 when they went up Cone Crater...
166:00:17|ALSJ|LMP|Apollo 14 didn't have a twenty degree slope. They had enough to make them work (about 10 degrees), but they didn't have as good a suit. They didn't have the new waist joint.
166:00:17|ALSJ|CDR|I just wanted to mention this. It was the one thing that impressed the devil out of me when we reviewed it. The still pictures and a lot of the TV don't show it, but it was really steep.
166:00:17|ALSJ|LMP|- (Laughing) "That's because the camera was always tilted twenty degrees.
166:00:17|ALSJ||TV off. In the copy of the audio tapes used to prepare the journal, the next five lines are buried under static and remarks by the Public Affairs commentator.
166:00:17|ALSJ||Gene's side of the Rover is the upslope side.
166:00:40|ALSJ|CDR|For Jack to have gotten on that downhill seat, even if he'd jumped up there he probably would have fallen back off. For me, it was much easier to get on the uphill side but it was steep enough that it really did feel like I was going to end up in Jack's seat.
166:00:40|ALSJ|LMP|It wasn't worth the effort for me to try to get on. By this time, we didn't have any problem with walking some distance.
166:00:40|ALSJ|CDR|The only thing about it is that Jack really did enjoy riding on the downhill side.
166:00:40|ALSJ|LMP|(Laughing) That might have influenced my decision as well.
166:03:44|ALSJ||48 Yankee contained Apollo samples 76030 through 76037. The largest fragment - 76035 - is a piece of blue-gray breccia. Interestingly, 48 Yankee also contains a 2.5 gram piece of basalt (76037).
166:04:39|ALSJ||Neither Jack nor Gene has any idea what "this thing" might have been. A quick review of the dialog hasn't revealed any clues. "It" is probably not the roll of tape, in part because Jack doesn't think the tape roll was big enough to have made him sit high.
166:04:39|ALSJ|LMP|Why couldn't we have said what it was!
166:04:39|ALSJ|CDR|You and I knew what was going on, but nobody else could have followed it.
166:05:22|ALSJ||The best TV record of an astronaut getting on a Rover is probably that of Charlie Duke at one of the Apollo 16 EVA-2 stations. @alsjurl/Fendell-Bio.pdf"@alsjt>Fendell</a> recorded Jack mounting the Rover at Stations 3 and 7. The best still is <a href="images17.html#20453"@alsjt>20453</a>, which Gene took of Jack at Station 9. Ken Glover has produced a <a href="a17jacksits.rm"@alsjt>video clip</a> of Jack mounting the Rover onboard the 1/6th-g airplane.
166:05:22|ALSJ|CDR|When you're sitting in the seat, you can't see what's going on in the seat. The other guy is the one whose got to look.
166:05:22|ALSJ|LMP|It's all by feel.
166:05:44|ALSJ|CDR|We were hearing static from the ground. But, as you can hear in the tape, they were reading us loud and clear. We were probably hearing carrier static.
166:05:56|ALSJ||Jack's @alsjurl/a17/a17trv21637-45.jpg"@alsjt>traverse pictures</a> taken during the 500-meter drive to Station 7 are AS17-141- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21637"@alsjt>21637</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21645"@alsjt>21645</a>.
166:07:23|ALSJ||During this EVA, Jack frequently has his visor positioned at about eye level. This provides him some shielding from the direct Sun while giving him a view of the ground unobscured by scratches in the visor. At this point in the review, Gene and Jack discussed the possibility that Jack was using one hand to steady himself as they drove on the slope. Jack doubts he could have reached the accessory staff mounted on his side of the console. They think he was probably holding onto a bar like the one shown on Gene's side of the Rover in @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22296"@alsjt>22296</a>, which is Gene's picture of Jack at his Rover seat taken at the end of Station 6.

166:11:09|ALSJ||Gene moves the TV so that he can dust the lens.
166:12:37|ALSJ||Fendell finds Jack WSW of the Rover, bagging a sample. He is leaning forward, but only a little more than he would at a level site.
166:13:00|ALSJ||Jack lowers his gold visor, then closes the sample bag by holding it by the two tabs at the top and twirling it three times. He is leaning on his scoop again, handle against his stomach.
166:13:11|ALSJ||Gene joins Jack and collects a fist-sized sample with his tongs.
166:13:17|ALSJ||Gene moves alongside Jack so that they are side-by-side, facing north.
166:13:36|ALSJ||Gene presents his SCB; Jack has dropped the scoop.
166:14:03|ALSJ||Once again, Jack retrieves the scoop by stepping on the head so that the handle rotates up to about waist height. With practice, this has become an easy procedure. Gene moves farther west to a large boulder.
166:14:29|ALSJ||Gene stops far enough from the boulder that his shadow won't show up in the pictures he is about to take.
166:14:38|ALSJ||Gene hops sideways to the north, taking a flightline stereo. These photos are AS17-146-22298 to 22315.
166:14:39|ALSJ||Gene is still taking pictures for the flightline stereo; Fendell pans southward to Jack who is collecting small rock fragments with the scoop.
166:15:13|ALSJ||Having bagged the first set of fragments, Jack collects some more. He has the head of the scoop angled 90 degrees to the shaft and is having a much easier time at solo sampling than he'd had at Station 3.
166:15:13|ALSJ|CDR|I notice that we seem much more relaxed during EVA-3. We were confronted with more ambitious things but, even little things like picking up the scoop that we would have commented on earlier in the mission, we were just doing.
166:15:13|ALSJ|LMP|In EVA-2, we were always behind the timeline.
166:15:13|ALSJ|CDR|Early on, we were shouting to Houston and now we're more in tune. I think that, in another week of this, it would have become pretty routine - 'routine' in the sense that everything we did wasn't brand new, wasn't a new challenge.
166:15:13|ALSJ|LMP|I think that the third EVA included not only all of those things but, also, a realization in the back of your mind that this was the last one.
166:15:13|ALSJ|CDR|We wanted to drag it out as long as we could.
166:15:45|ALSJ||Jack moves about ten feet to the south to get some more fragments. In order to collect and bag the samples, he rests the head of the scoop on the ground after he gets a fragment or two, then bends down as far as he can and grabs the shaft about a foot off the ground. This grip makes it relatively easy for him to pour the samples into a bag. Gene's close-ups of the boulder are AS17-146-22316 to 22328. He is using the tongs to make sure that he is the right distance away for good focus. In @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22325"@alsjt>22325</a>, one of the dikelets runs horizontally across the frame about 2/3rds of the way up.
166:16:14|ALSJ||Jack moves a few feet north and collects another fragment. Fendell pans to Gene who is examining the northeast corner of the boulder. The top of the boulder is just a bit above the top of Gene's head. We can see Gene using his tongs to gauge his distance.
166:16:23|ALSJ|CDR|I remember this episode very, very vaguely. I didn't describe it very well.
166:16:23|ALSJ|LMP|You're going through a lot of thought and you're only articulating every once in a while.
166:16:23|ALSJ||At most stations, Gene has spent the first few minutes cleaning up the Rover while Jack has taken a look at the local geology. Here, the roles are different. While Gene dusted, Jack took a "before" pan and then started sampling.
166:16:23|ALSJ|LMP|The assigned task was to get a collection of fragments.
166:16:23|ALSJ|CDR|Quickly. Along with some general documentation.
166:16:23|ALSJ|LMP|And, generally, sampling of this kind was my task because we had decided that the scoop was the fastest way to do it.
166:16:23|ALSJ|CDR|The rock was an added attraction, a target of opportunity. So I went over while Jack was picking up his samples.
166:16:23|ALSJ|LMP|That's generally the way we worked on field trips.
166:17:08|ALSJ||Gene is scraping fragments off of the face of the boulder; Jack puts the soil sample in his SCB.
166:17:19|ALSJ|LMP|'Dikelet' was a much better term than 'veinlet'. They're injected magma, melted rock.
166:17:19|ALSJ|CDR|And you didn't teach me that word before we started, either.
166:17:19|ALSJ|LMP|I think you knew 'dike' before...
166:17:19|ALSJ|CDR|Yeah; but 'dikelet'...I don't ever remember you telling me to use that word. (Tongue in cheek) Jack used to give me all these words and he'd say, 'Now, when you get up there, Cernan, use these. It will impress the hell out of them.' I had a list of words written down like a football player has a list of plays.
166:17:19|ALSJ|LMP|The guy that literally did that was Conrad. He had a list of geology phrases in his checklist, but he never used them. Of the first three crews, we probably had Beano and Pete as far up the curve in geology training as anybody. The last exercise they had in Hawaii just went beautifully. They were on top of everything we threw at them. So we expected the same thing to happen on the Moon and, yet, not a word! Not a word! Afterwards I found out - and I'm not sure exactly how - that they specifically decided not to say anything because, in the meantime, some of my scientific 'friends' had publicly made fun of Buzz talking about mica-like particles ('biotite' was the word Buzz used) that he saw sparkling on the surface. And they do sparkle like mica!! He'd seen it on field trips. But these assholes - I'll say that on tape - were making fun of Buzz because he described the way things looked. I'll tell you, I chewed a lot of guys out about the criticism of Buzz.
166:17:19|ALSJ||In October 1991 telephone conversations with Pete Conrad and Al Bean, both said that they did not remember the criticism of Buzz and both said that they never decided to avoid the use of specific geology terms in order to avoid criticism during their own mission. In addition, Bean stated in strong terms that it would have been completely out of character Pete to let criticism of Buzz influence his own behavior. Both did have lists of geology phrases in their checklists, lists which Pete says "Jack gave to us, maybe to poke fun at the guys who had criticized Buzz." Neither Pete nor Al saw the lists before they got to the Moon, and neither used any of the phrases, primarily because, in Pete's words "nothing appropriate ever came up". A secondary reason was that, again in Pete's words, "I decided it wasn't proper to be funny about that." As Pete says in his commentary to the Apollo 12 transcript, his prime concern with regard to geology descriptions was to avoid using his favorite geology word, which was "stuff". He had promised Uel Clanton that he would use either a proper geology term or the word "material" and Clanton had bet other members of the science team that Pete would keep his word.
166:17:19|ALSJ||Whatever actual events that preceded Apollo 12, and whatever agreements Pete and Al may have come to between themselves about the use of geology terms, the important point here is Jack's justifiable annoyance with those who criticized Buzz. At several places in the Apollo 17 commentary, Jack and Gene make a compelling case for the use of descriptive comparisons while doing field work. Precise terminology can be applied after the fact and after the samples have been examined by professionals in a shirtsleeve environment.
166:17:39|ALSJ||Gene and Jack are standing side-by-side, facing west and examining the boulder.
166:18:07|ALSJ|LMP|The reason that you don't hear any surprise in my voice (at Gene's discovery of the dike), is that what we had seen at Tracy's Rock was that you were getting partially-molten breccias in contact with the blue-gray rock. And here, some of that melt had been injected into the broken, crushed anorthositic fragments. So, while it wasn't a surprise, it was still a great find. (Laughing) And the only thing I had to do was to keep guiding Gene on using that hammer.
166:18:07|ALSJ|CDR|(In mock seriousness) You took my only playtoy away from me.
166:18:07|ALSJ|LMP|Hey, you were the only one who could hold it. I designed it, but I never could hold the damn thing. The handle was too big. We learned before we went that Gene was better in grasping the hammer; and the only thing I had to teach him to hit the edge of a rock instead of the center. 'Brute-force Cernan,' I kept thinking.
166:18:07|ALSJ|CDR|I've got a short, stubby hand, but I've also got a lot of strength in it. When you're grabbing that hammer, you're really grabbing it with your forearm muscles. That's where you get tired. The hammer, I didn't have any trouble with. (To Jack) If you remember, your hands were really hurting. Do you remember the blisters we had on our knuckles and it felt like our fingernails were driven back into the joints.
166:18:48|ALSJ||Rock buried deep beneath the surface are not exposed to cosmic rays and it is possible to use geochemistry techniques to estimate how long it has been since a rock was exposed since having been dug out by an impact or since it broke off an outcrop. In 1975, @alsjurl/alsj-CosRayExposur.html"@alsjt>C.J. Morgan</a> was able to determine that the Station 7 boulder had been exposed for about 28 million years. This is not the length of time since the dikelet material was injected, which is undoubtedly much, much longer.
166:19:52|ALSJ||Jack puts the sample bag in Gene's SCB; and then moves south about a meter along the rock face.
166:20:06|ALSJ||Gene touches the rock with the tongs held in his outstretched hand in order to establish a focus distance. These close-up "afters" are @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22329"@alsjt>22329</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22330"@alsjt>22330</a>.
166:20:06|ALSJ|CDR|There's two things here: the transfer of authority with the hammer going to Jack (general laughter), and then the measurement of the focal distance. And you notice how easy it is for me to get the hammer out. I don't even look down. I just reach down, feel the handle, and it comes out.
166:20:23|ALSJ||Jack has hit the rock ten times. The scoop falls to the ground behind Gene.
166:20:23|ALSJ|LMP|None of the strokes were hard. Just little taps to break away the edge of a fracture.
166:20:52|ALSJ||Jack steps south again, Gene following and trying to reach his SCB. Jack gets another sample loose with five hammer strokes.
166:21:26|ALSJ||Gene moves east to take photographs. Jack moves out of the way. Gene's photos are AS17-146-22331 to 22338.
166:21:37|ALSJ||Jack's lifts off a hand-sized sample he's knocked loose. The fresh surface on the boulder looks bright white in the direct Sun.
166:22:00|ALSJ||They rotate 90 degrees around a common center, putting Jack with his back against the rock and, primarily, putting Gene below him.
166:22:00|ALSJ|CDR|This scene here - where Jack's getting up hill so he can get to my SCB while I'm getting the hammer put away - is a pretty good example of how we were no longer struggling with each and every tasks. By the third EVA a lot of these things were beginning to come naturally. You could combine actions and you became more productive and efficient in your use of time.
166:22:00|ALSJ|LMP|Again, just to point out the obvious, in the first EVA it wasn't quite that way. Things like putting the hammer away took longer. And what that points out is that, no matter how much we had trained in the suit, until you get in one-sixth gravity, your motions don't become habit. But very quickly, once you're in the right environment, you learn to do things almost automatically.
166:22:00|ALSJ|CDR|We could never train in a one-sixth gravity environment. For the record, we've got people all over the country doing studies for lunar base and Mars habitats. And there's only eleven people in the entire world who've ever been in anything but one gravity or zero gravity. There's only eleven people who can tell you about one-sixth gravity or who, perhaps, can extrapolate to Mars gravity. I just say that because, while that experience is around, we ought to at least tap it. And I don't think we do. Think about it. We've got thousands of hours of spaceflight experience - all the Soviet experience, all the Shuttle experience - and there's eleven human beings alive (Jim Irwin having died prior to this review session) who've experienced reduced gravity other than zero gravity.
166:22:00|ALSJ|LMP|- (Straight faced) "And only two who really understand it.
166:22:00|ALSJ|CDR|I agree. Strictly speaking, in terms of most recent experience, how can you argue with that? But, it's something serious. We've got all these studies. Everybody and their brother's doing a study about how you're going to operate, work, live, and function. And what they need to think about is how you learn to adapt. On that first EVA, that hammer was almost a handicap. It was always in the way. I knocked a fender off. But later, somehow, subconsciously, I knew it was there and worked around it. I was able to get at it or put it away much more quickly without making it a specific task. I was able to get at tools I needed concurrent with doing other things, instead of making each one a separate task. I didn't have to say, 'Time out, I'll get the shovel. Time out, I'll get my hammer out of my pocket.' Just a minute ago, when Jack walked away from where we had been working, on his first step he stepped on the head of the scoop so that he could grab the handle and walk on. It wasn't a special task where he got down on one knee and took another thirty seconds to a minute before he could press on. I think it's pretty easy to adapt. But, here again. With all these studies about what kind of mobility we need and how we're going to adapt and what tools we're going to need to get the work done, I don't know that anyone has ever been asked any questions. I haven't been asked, for the most part.
166:22:00|ALSJ|LMP|I participated in one or two studies; but, as far as I know, those studies aren't used. The Essex study for crew systems down at Houston has a lot of that stuff in it. But, if you ask anybody if they've seen it, they say they haven't. It's typical. All these studies are done and, even if they're good, they stay on the shelves along with the bad ones. Nobody ever looks at them and they go do the work again. I don't know how you break through that.
166:22:00|ALSJ||In 1993, the Apollo astronauts were finally invited to the Johnson Space Center to participate in a series of structured interviews about their lunar work experience. A draft report - authored by Mary Conner and others - was being circulated in early 1994, although I have not seen a final version.
166:22:00|ALSJ||A question then arose about the value of contacts with prior crews to their training for Apollo 17.
166:22:00|ALSJ|LMP|I think that, for Gene and me, those contacts were a major part of assimilating the experience that others had had. An example is Gene's consciousness about the cables for the heat flow probe. He was aware that John Young had lost track of them and pulled them out.
166:22:00|ALSJ|CDR|We probably focused on the problems that other people had had. The problems that Apollo 14 had getting up to Cone Crater. The problems of Apollo 16 with the cables. And I think that probably 15 was as good an all round training experience for follow-on crews as any. Because they had a little bit of everything: the Rover, the drill, rugged terrain. So it was a good presentation of the kind of things that you wanted to be aware of.
166:22:00|ALSJ|LMP|At this stage in the game (twenty years later), it's hard to remember all the things that you assimilated from the crew debriefings and from watching their performances. But I'm sure that there were a lot of things in the back of your mind that you learned and prepared for. So, by the time we flew, we had the benefit of all of that experience.
166:22:00|ALSJ|CDR|And there's always the undocumented conversations when you're in someone's office or wherever you might be. Saying 'Hey, John, did you really have a problem here' or 'What were you thinking there?' We worked and traveled together and I'm sure there were a lot of informal discussions. I can remember talking to John (Young) about the tendency, when you're coming down, to drift backwards or sideways. I wanted to land with a positive foot-per-second forward velocity. I wanted to bias my zero horizontal velocity so that I wouldn't drift back into something I couldn't see. I know that Stu Roosa - having just flown Apollo 14 - worked very closely with Ron and was very interested in the orbital science aspects of our mission.
166:22:31|ALSJ||Gene heads for the Rover. Jack goes for the scoop. He leans on the boulder with his left hand, and goes down to get the scoop with his right. Gens stops part way back and tries to pick up a rock with the tongs. The rock is too big. The tongs are attached to Gene's yo-yo and, as he lets go of the tongs, he pushes them around to his side to make sure they are out of the way.
166:23:01|ALSJ||Gene gets the hammer out, intending to use it as a support so that he can get down to grab the rock. He puts the hammer to use in virtually the same way that he used the drill during ALSEP deployment - by leaning on it with one hand. At first, he doesn't quite go to his knees.
166:23:09|ALSJ||Gene has trouble getting his hand around the rock. He is now on his knees. This rock is not as big as Great Scott or Big Muley, the largest rocks collected on Apollo 15 and 16, respectively.
166:23:12|ALSJ|CDR|I found a narrow part of the rock that I could grip.
166:23:12|ALSJ||Gene pushes back off the hammer without moving his feet. As his PLSS rotates far enough back, he rises to his feet.
166:23:22|ALSJ||Gene tosses his hammer so that he can change grip as he catches it.
166:23:22|ALSJ|CDR|That's a great scene. I love that.
166:23:25|ALSJ|CDR|I think that this is what this whole EVA is about. Aside from the geology, you're seeing a much more productive use of time.
166:23:25|ALSJ||Jack takes hold of the gate and starts to open it.
166:24:21|ALSJ||Fendell pans away from them, counter-clockwise.
166:25:51|ALSJ||This is Apollo magazine 142.
166:26:07|ALSJ||Fendell finds Jack at Gene's seat and, beyond him to the NW, Gene kangaroo hopping uphill, away from the Rover.
166:26:07|ALSJ||<a name="1662658">Gene</a> has gotten into a small crater that provides him with a fairly level place on which to stand.

166:26:07|ALSJ||Because of this identification of the tops of the Station 6 boulders, an attempt was made to identify the Station 7 boulder in the corresponding frame from Gene's Station 6 pan, AS17-140-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21504"@alsjt>21504</a>. However, as indicated in an accompanying @alsjurl/a17/a17station6-7.html"@alsjt>discussion</a>, the Station 7 boulder is hidden by intervening terrain and/or boulders.
166:27:41|ALSJ|LMP|Here, the 'goodies' I'm talking about are the individual fragments that we sampled right off the bat. It's not a new sample. As I was listening to this, at first I thought I was off doing something I shouldn't have been. But I'm sure I'm just adding another comment about that first sample I took with a scoop.
166:27:51|ALSJ||Jack goes to the gate; Gene hops back to the Rover.
166:28:51|ALSJ||In Houston, Bob is told that the LCRU is getting hot. Gene goes to the front of the Rover; Jack goes around the back.
166:29:30|ALSJ||Gene moves the TV to its stow position; Jack hops into his seat just before Gene turns the TV off.
166:30:22|ALSJ||The traverse map for the drive to Station 8 is @alsjurl/a17/a17eva3_lmpcdr16.gif"@alsjt>LMP/CDR-16</a> and the traverse description is @alsjurl/a17/a17eva3_lmpcdr17.gif"@alsjt>LMP/CDR-17</a>.
166:30:28|ALSJ||One of the battery temperature gauges has failed.
166:31:42|ALSJ||Jack thinks that both he and Bob are making a sarcastic reference to some pre-flight discussions about SWP, but doesn't remember the context. As Bob has said, the cuff checklist shows a slight course change as they round the southwest rim of SWP.
166:31:49|ALSJ|CDR|I've been reading ahead and I want to warn you that there's another important geologic observation coming up at 166:33:28.
166:31:55|ALSJ|LMP|The other guys may have just had the EVA map with the traverse on it. And you (Gene) said, 'Why don't we put that in the cuff checklist.' It wouldn't surprise me.
166:31:55|ALSJ||This conjecture is correct. Neither the Apollo 15 nor 16 cuff checklists contained traverse maps.
166:31:55|ALSJ|CDR|I tell you what. It may go back to my days in the Navy when we were doing low-altitude run-ins, and we would take a big sectional map. Your track might turn you left and right and south and we would cut the map in sections and we'd paste together so that you'd always have the navigation line - the run-in line - going away from you so that you were always flying forward no matter whether you were flying north or south or whatever. Even today I fly that way. I turn maps and mentally strip it in the direction I'm going. So, this could be an evolution of that.
166:31:55|ALSJ|LMP| I think that's right. I think that Dave (Scott) and John (Young) used the map. Gene had the map up in front of him, but he wanted it translated into a strip format for the cuff checklist.
166:31:55|ALSJ|CDR|It's like a watch. Where's the most convenient place to put a watch? On a wrist. Not in a pocket. Pocket watches are nice, but the most convenient place to put it is where you can glance at it easily. That's why the cuff checklist, itself, was a great idea; and putting the maps in made it even better.
166:31:55|ALSJ|LMP|The idea of the checklist, itself, goes back to Apollo 8. Bill Anders asked for one listing the things he was going to describe from lunar orbit. It wasn't a cuff checklist, but the checklist that Neil had sewn on his sleeve evolved from that.
166:31:55|ALSJ|CDR|The support crews deserve credit for a lot of these little ideas. Something might have been a problem on a previous mission and someone like Ed Gibson (who came up with the idea of the stay-open, spring-bound cuff checklist for Apollo 12) could come up with a simple fix that people on the prime crew might not have had time to think about. And, by the time of Apollo 17, the cuff checklist wasn't just a checklist of the things you wanted to do, it was a geologic flight plan.
166:32:09|ALSJ|LMP|Now, as this line indicates, from my geologic experience - to contrast with Gene's Navy experience - you're used to keeping the map oriented one way and translate, in your mind, where north is. I never did it very well, but a lot of people are able to do that.
166:33:14|ALSJ||Jacks traverse photos are AS17-142- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21671"target="alsj">21671</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21691"target="alsj">21691</a>. Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21674"@alsjt>21674</a> is a photo of the "big mamoos". Mamoos is slang for breasts.
166:36:05|ALSJ||Jack is probably saying that his hands are getting warm; either that or he has noticed the battery temperatures. However, only the temperature gauge for battery 1 is working - the other having failed during the rest period. In addition, the battery 1 temperature at the next stop will be 115&#186;F. Prior temperatures on this EVA were 95&#186;F at the start, 100&#186;F when they left the LM, and 108&#186;F at the start of Station 6. The temperature at the end of EVA-2 had been 114&#186;F degrees.
166:36:05|ALSJ|CDR|I've got to believe that it's not batteries. We could start to feel the Sun penetrating the suit on the EVA-3. We were driving into the Sun, sitting still. We were not going in and out of shade. Everything that was in the Sun, stayed in the Sun for twenty or thirty minutes.
166:36:37|ALSJ||They are roughly 300 to 400 meters north of Cochise.
166:36:40|ALSJ|CDR|We do that a lot when you're flying an approach. I don't know why I was doing that. Maybe it was the Sun angle or the slope. It wasn't the direct route to where we were going; but, by staying at 3.4 from the LM, we were going to get there.
166:37:26|ALSJ||Gene is driving generally southeast as he drives his 3.4-km arc as he approaches SWP. The Cleft is north, to his left; however, as he maneuvers to avoid craters and rocks, occasionally he gets a look in that direction.
166:39:10|ALSJ|LMP|It strikes me - because of the casualness of Bob's little jibe - that, here we are, two hundred thirty thousand miles from Earth, third EVA, three and a half kilometers from the relative safety of the LM, and it sounds like we're down at the local Circle K (a chain of convenience stores), for crying out loud! Human beings and their psychological adaptability is just unbelievable!
166:39:10|ALSJ|CDR|There you were, in a space suit, two inches away from the vacuum of the universe. Every time you made a move - from Earth orbit to translunar coast to lunar orbit, out of the Command Module to the Lunar Module, to the lunar surface, out of the Lunar Module, out on the surface in your suit, jump in the Rover and drive out about as far as you can theoretically walk back - you added a link in a chain that you have to gobble back up to get home. And, yet, you only think about it when you have to think about it.
166:39:10|ALSJ||During discussions with Pete Conrad and Alan Bean about the Apollo 12 mission, they said that the main factor limiting how far they got from the LM was concern about the health of the spacecraft. If there was a problem with the LM, they wanted to be able to get back relatively quickly so that they could take care of it and/or leave. The suits and backpacks were of lesser concern.
166:39:10|ALSJ|CDR|The health of the LM was always a concern. Based on an accumulation of experience, by the time of Apollo 17 we had more faith in the LM and, at least for our flight, actually powered it down. But my personal feeling is that, should something have happened to the suit or the Rover, I was on the spot to be able to do something about it. Whether I could or not was another story. But I, at least, was in control. But if I'm 3.6 kilometers from the Lunar Module and something happens in the spacecraft, I'm not there to do anything about it. So, when you left the LM out there all by itself, that was the weak link in the chain. If we had a problem with the suit, we were going to scoot back home to the LM.
166:39:10|ALSJ|LMP|I've really been searching my memories of all the flight planning we did - and I did a lot of it for the EVAs - I don't remember concerns about the LM ever coming up. I remember concerns about suit leaks, about the energy levels it would take to walk, what was a reasonable distance to walk, and things like that. Pete's flight was the first pinpoint landing. We didn't know we were going to land as close to that Surveyor as we did. And so the EVA planning was pretty general and we thought a lot about what we were going to do if we didn't land close to it. I just frankly don't remember the security of the LM being an issue. I may be totally wrong. My thought in those days, as I recall, was that the ground was going to be watching that LM very, very carefully and was going to tell the crew. They were going to be close enough to get back in a hurry anyway.
166:39:10|ALSJ|CDR|The ground could tell you, but they couldn't do anything. They had absolutely no control over the LM. I've always felt - and this is not a knock at the LM, because the LM was one of the finest flying machines built for the purpose at hand - but I felt more comfortable in my suit. The LM was literally built to just get the job done, while the suit was almost over-engineered. When we pressurized the LM - whoop - it expanded like an oil can. It didn't scare me, but you did realize that you were at the mercy of a little tin can with a few motors running and blowers blowing and what have you. We convinced ourselves we could have gotten in our suits in three and a half minutes but, in the real world, we would have needed more time...
166:39:10|ALSJ|LMP|I think there was a (vacuum) chamber test - something associated with a chamber test. One of the tests was delayed because somebody stuck a pencil through the skin of the LM.
166:39:10|ALSJ|CDR|It was your minimum housing requirements on the lunar surface. Would I live in a LM for a month on the Moon? Aside from the lack of volume and so forth, I don't think that would be a judicious approach. I think you would have to get in something more stable. The LM is a good transfer vehicle and we lived in it for three days. But I don't think it would be adequate for any long period of time.
166:39:10|ALSJ|LMP|You wouldn't want a lot of long-term activity going on in there. There's just too much chance of damaging it. Every time we went in and out, we'd bang against the DSKY.
166:39:10|ALSJ|CDR|We've had a long digression, but I think that the person who utilizes this information for any reason - ten years, twenty years or, just from a historical point of view, a hundred years from now - ought to know the feelings of the people who were really there. It's an important part of this document.
166:39:24|ALSJ|LMP|The more I think about what I said, the more I think that there were two pit-bottom craters side by side. Maybe there's a picture that shows it.
166:40:16|ALSJ|LMP|Because things were so ill-defined over here at the Sculptured Hills, it was decided that we would pick the exact place.
166:40:16|ALSJ||Cuff Checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17eva3_lmpcdr18.gif"@alsjt>LMP/CDR-18</a> indicates the general area in which they intend to do Station 8. Gene is referring to the northern end of the area, specifically to the spot marked 8A on both @alsjurl/a17/a17eva3_lmpcdr17.gif"@alsjt>LMP/CDR-17</a> and @alsjurl/a17/a17eva3_lmpcdr18.gif"@alsjt>LMP/CDR-18</a>. He will actually stop at 226/4.0, which is spot a bit north of 8A but - because of the displacement of the LM from the planned landing site - at virtually the same range.
166:42:01|ALSJ||Gene takes @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22364"@alsjt>22364</a> at about this point. A @alsjurl/a17/a17lbl22364.jpg"@alsjt>labeled version</a> shows the location of the dark-rim crater.
166:42:44|ALSJ||AS17-142- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21692"@alsjt>21692</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21693"@alsjt>21693</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21694"@alsjt>21694</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21695"@alsjt>21695</a>, and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21696"@alsjt>21696</a> are Jack's photos of the approach to the crater.
166:43:34|ALSJ|LMP|My erstwhile colleagues (in the lunar geology community) don't like the term 'instant rock'. They call it 'regolith breccia'. I got taken to task at some talk I gave.
166:43:34|ALSJ|CDR|It is instant rock! (Jack laughs) I used to think of rock forming over hundreds of thousands of years; but, all of a sudden, now I know what it is. 'Instant rock' adds dynamics to the description.
166:43:34|ALSJ|LMP|What's happening in this area is that we've gotten a whole bunch of ejecta blankets from large craters like Henry, Cochise, and Shakespeare on top of each other. It's a very thick regolith, and craters which would have normally gotten to bedrock just penetrated farther into regolith, formed a lot of instant rock, and that's what's been thrown up on the rims. That's what we've sampled here and that's what we'll see at Van Serg (Station 9).
166:43:59|ALSJ||Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21697"@alsjt>21697</a> is the last picture Jack takes before they get to Station 8.
166:44:29|ALSJ||Gene is correct. Once they stop and climb up the hill to examine the rock, they will find that it is glass coated and, therefore, that it was almost certainly thrown onto the mountain side from somewhere else.
166:44:40|ALSJ||During the review, we discussed the matter of what Jack had intended to say and concluded that "exotic" - a rock thrown in from elsewhere - was most likely. Gene suggested "You ought to program a computer to think like Jack thinks, feed it this sentence, and let it finish it. (General laughter) It would be a tough task.
166:46:06|ALSJ||There was no change in the quality of the comm when they hit the crater, suggesting that Houston is still reading them through the LM.
166:46:19|ALSJ|LMP|I think we were still on the ejecta blanket of a crater - maybe Bowen (or SWP) - big enough to have penetrated to the subfloor and to have thrown rocks up the slope. So, what I was trying to do was get us away from that and get as far up the hill as we could go. We wound up at the northwest end of the Station 8 area.
166:46:35|ALSJ||The pitch meter has been broken since early in the mission.
166:48:33|ALSJ|LMP|Your ability to sense a slope in one-sixth g is not as great as it would be in one g. The extreme, of course, being zero g where you wouldn't sense a slope at all.
166:48:33|ALSJ||On all of the Rover missions, the crews drove up slopes which seemed much steeper once they got off the Rover and tried to stand.
166:49:27|ALSJ||The SEP electronics package has long since shut itself off because of too high a temperature.
166:49:56|ALSJ||TV on.
166:50:47|ALSJ||@alsjurl/Fendell-Bio.pdf"@alsjt>Fendell</a> pans counter-clockwise.
166:51:24|ALSJ||While Fendell is panning counter-clockwise through NE, Jack runs rapidly across the picture, going cross slope to the southeast. He is taking 3-4 foot strides.
166:51:24|ALSJ|CDR|Jack is really covering some territory. The fact that the camera is panning in the opposite direction makes it look faster, but he's really moving across that slope.
166:52:26|ALSJ||Fendell reaches the TV's counter-clockwise stop, and then reverses direction.
166:52:35|ALSJ||Gene had not given a mark, having been distracted by the fender clip.
166:53:20|ALSJ||Fendell finds Gene north of the Rover at an appreciable distance. Jack is beyond him, hopping upslope and approximately three times farther away.
166:53:20|ALSJ|LMP|With that slope, the kangaroo hop was the only way to move.
166:53:20|ALSJ|CDR|You couldn't really go one foot in front of the other uphill, because you can't get your foot high to take that step. So you hop.
166:53:20|ALSJ|LMP|I don't recall anybody ever walking up stairs in a pressurized suit.
166:53:20|ALSJ||During the Apollo 16 EVA deployment at @alsjurl/a16/a16.heatflow.html#1212245"@alsjt>121:22:45</a>, shortly after the loss of the heatflow experiments, John steps up onto a 20 cm rock and then down on the other side. This is the only 'step up' and 'step down' that I know of in the Apollo video record.
166:53:34|ALSJ||Gene makes his way cross slope to a boulder due north of the Rover. This is the sample 78135 location as indicated in the Station 8 @alsjurl/a17/a17psrf6-120.jpg"@alsjt>plan map</a>. Jack is climbing farther uphill to another rock, which is the sample 78220 location. Fendell starts to follow Gene, doesn't find him, and goes back to Jack. Gene's cross-Sun stereo pictures of the rock near the Rover are AS17-146- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22365"@alsjt>22365</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22366"@alsjt>22366</a>.

This excellent picture shows the TV camera pointed off to the left and the high-gain antenna pointed back towards Earth, which is over the South Massif. Note that the low-gain antenna, which is partially hidden by the high-gain is also pointed at Earth. The @alsjurl/a17/a17experiment_sep_en.jpg"@alsjt>SEP antenna</a> is behind Jack's seat and the rake for the explosive charges is visible on the back of the Rover. The East Massif is at the upper right. Readers should note the dark blemish on the East Massif foothill above and slightly to the right of the SEP antenna. This is the outcrop area that Gene notes as he and Jack leave Station 8 at @alsjurl/a17/a17.trvsta9.html#1673941"@alsjt>167:39:41</a>.
166:53:56|ALSJ||Fendell finds Jack leaning over the upslope boulder. The plan map of Station 8, extracted from the Apollo 17 Preliminary Science Report, indicates that the boulder is approximately 53 meters ENE of the Rover. The TV record suggests that the boulder is directly uphill from the Rover. According to the mission report, Jack's heart rate peaks at about 167:05 at 122 beats per minute. Gene's peaks at about 167:10 at about 122 beats. These times correspond, roughly, to the times when each of them makes their way back downhill to the Rover. However, the uncertainty in the plotted times is unknown and these peaks may also represent the climbs up to the rock.
166:53:56|ALSJ|CDR|I got tired just watching this. We weren't breathing hard; but Jack's voice, when he got up to the rock, was forceful - which we tended to do in those circumstances. You had to blow it out.
166:54:07|ALSJ|LMP|Good idea, Jack.
166:54:07|ALSJ||Jack has taken cross-Sun photos of the boulder and is now taking a down-Sun from the right at a distance about equal to his shadow length. His cross-Sun stereos are AS17-142- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21698"@alsjt>21698</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21699"@alsjt>21699</a>, and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21700"@alsjt>21700</a>. His down-Sun is @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21701"@alsjt>21701</a>.
166:55:36|ALSJ||Fendell zooms in on Jack. The rock is perhaps one third of a meter high and two-thirds of a meter across. From later evidence, it is also about two-thirds of a meter long in the direction away from the camera. It is also broader on the bottom than the top.
166:55:52|ALSJ||<a name="1665624">Jack</a> moves a few steps uphill. He turns his camera toward the Rover, takes a "locator", then moves to the upslope side of the rock.

166:56:39|ALSJ||Jack flips the rock over with his right foot. It starts to roll toward the Rover, but veers toward the right. Jack follows and kicks it again to keep it going. After a short while, it lands in a shallow depression and stops.
166:57:02|ALSJ||Jack climbs back up to the place where he'd found the boulder, intending to sample the soil which it had been covering. Gene comes into view briefly, going away from the Rover and hopping uphill.
166:58:12|ALSJ||Gene reaches the rolled boulder. Jack is still sampling soil at the original boulder site, this time holding the sample bag low and at arm's length. He is holding the scoop nearer the handle than the head.
166:58:13|ALSJ||Jack goes down to Gene.

166:59:27|ALSJ||Gene moves to the right of the rock and slightly below it, and hits it six times with the hammer. Jack moves upslope of the rock. Gene is raising the hammer to head height.
166:59:27|ALSJ|CDR|I still can remember the reverberation through my body when I hit a hard rock like that. Your whole body would feel the impact of that hammer. By this time, I wasn't feeling inhibited from taking good solid swings. But I would have hated to miss it and hit my shin.
166:59:27|ALSJ|LMP|I could feel it through the ground, through my feet, like a minor earthquake. And you could see where I moved when you started to swing? I never stood in front of you.
166:59:27|ALSJ||On at least two occasions during Apollo 16, Charlie Duke lost his grip on the hammer. Gene never did.
166:59:27|ALSJ|LMP|That's one reason why I didn't use it. I never felt like I had control of it
166:59:27|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Tomas Lundberg notes that Jack did use the hammer once on the Moon, at Camelot starting at @alsjurl/a17/a17.sta5.html#1464152"@alsjt>146:41:52</a>.
166:59:47|ALSJ||They are standing side-by-side. Using Gene's hand for support, Jack kneels to get the fragment, then gets up.
167:00:03|ALSJ||Gene strikes the rock three times.
167:00:03|ALSJ|CDR|You notice that I'm standing a little below the boulder. It's something you do automatically.
167:00:03|ALSJ|LMP|Human beings are basically lazy. And you naturally find the easiest way to get to it. One thing I noticed back at Station 7 is that, the first time I dropped the scoop, I stepped on it to get the handle up so I could grasp it. The second time, it was over at the rock and I just leaned against the rock and reached down.
167:00:03|ALSJ|CDR|That stepping to get the handle is something I do on the golf course all the time. If I happen to drop a sand wedge along the edge of the green - while I'm putting - and I go back to get it. Jack's right, we're lazy and we pick the easiest way out. I always step on the face of that club.
167:00:03|ALSJ|LMP|I play golf, but I never do that. My clubs are too good for that. (General laughter)
167:00:03|ALSJ|CDR|Jack never needs but one club when he's up to the green, and the putter's got a flat face and it's awful hard...
167:00:03|ALSJ|LMP|You don't want to step on your putter, anyway. It's bad luck.
167:00:03|ALSJ|CDR|Well, I've got all those high angle clubs with me when I'm around the green.
167:00:08|ALSJ||Jack gets the fragment with the scoop.
167:00:24|ALSJ||Gene drops the bag.
167:00:36|ALSJ||Gene retrieves the bag with his hammer.
167:00:43|ALSJ||Jack pours the sample into the bag that Gene is holding.
167:01:10|ALSJ||Gene hands Jack the sample bag and then leans on the rock so that he can retrieve his dropped hammer. He gets up easily and then strikes the rock seven times.
167:01:37|ALSJ||Gene changes his position from the right of the rock to above it.
167:01:38|ALSJ||Gene changes his mind and shifts back to the right. He hits three blows.
167:01:55|ALSJ||Gene strikes the rock nine times.
167:02:02|ALSJ||From the way that both of them react, it is evident that, after the final blow, a fragment flies off to the right.
167:02:08|ALSJ||Gene goes about 20 meters to the right of the boulder, using a skipping gait as he goes slightly downhill.
167:02:08|ALSJ|CDR|I was braking as I was going downhill and then I hopped on two feet coming back up. You can see the degree of that slope. It was a lot of work; I wasn't making much progress."

167:02:08|ALSJ||When Gene and Fendell return to the rock, Jack is examining it on hands and knees.

(General laughter) And, when I had to go pick up the chip of that boulder, Jack immediately picked up the cue and described it himself. Jack, this was going to be my big moment! You were going to let me do the whole thing, but you couldn't stand it.
167:03:07|ALSJ||From his hands and knees position, Jack gets a sample bag and hands it to Gene.
167:03:21|ALSJ||Jack pushes back off of the rock but can't get his PLSS back far enough to rise. On the third try, he rocks his PLSS back far enough that he starts to tip over backwards. Once the PLSS is over his feet, he rises and hops back under the PLSS to catch himself.

167:04:29|ALSJ||Gene moves the gnomon well away of the rock to the left. He then gets down on hands and knees and flips the rock with his right hand.
167:04:44|ALSJ||The rock rolls about 2 meters, landing with the same side up.
167:05:03|ALSJ||Gene gets up in two tries; then gets the gnomon.
167:05:43|ALSJ|LMP|I think that what I had in mind was to get top and bottom samples for solar wind dating. We also had a plan to get soil samples from way underneath boulders, samples that had been shielded from cosmic rays. Bob was thinking about the cosmic ray issue; I had in mind solar wind dating of when the boulder got there. The solar wind doesn't penetrate more than 500 Angstroms (5x10-8 m); whereas cosmic ray secondaries wind up at two or three meters. So we were both right; I just never explained to him what I was doing.
167:05:55|ALSJ||The fragment comes off on hit number seventeen. Some of the blows are audible, unless the sound is being produced by Gene's microphone tapping on the neckring or some similar phenomenon.
167:06:17|ALSJ||Gene gets a sample bag from Jack, who is collecting the fragment with the scoop.
167:06:31|ALSJ||Jack pours the sample into the bag. At some point after he finishes collecting the soil, he takes @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21704"@alsjt>21704</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21705"@alsjt>21705</a>.
167:07:11|ALSJ||Jack uses what might be described as a "hop, skip, and jump" gait. Gene's "after" pictures of the boulder are AS17-146-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22372"@alsjt>22372</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22374"@alsjt>22374</a>.
167:07:26|ALSJ||Jack switches to a two-footed skiing stance and makes repeated sounds of skis gliding and, as he goes, trying to hop from side to side.
167:07:26|ALSJ|LMP|I'd started out trying to stride downhill. And it didn't work.
167:07:39|ALSJ|LMP|Somebody was inspired to put out a "Ski the Moon" poster, this one just a white sphere on a black background.

167:09:59|ALSJ||Fendell can't keep up with Gene.
167:10:01|ALSJ|CDR|When you were hopping, I felt that you could really take off and still have significant control if you anticipated and shock-absorbed your landing. It really was the only way to travel downhill. I think that if you stride on a slope, you shift your weight too much from one foot to the other and, in one-sixth g, once you start to shift your weight your more apt to go kattiwampus (meaning "out of kilter").
167:10:01|ALSJ|LMP|Well, you know, it's hard to stride going downhill here on Earth, too. If you go down a twenty degree slope and you start striding, you just don't feel like you've got much control.
167:10:01|ALSJ|CDR|Yeah. And when you hop, you can lean back like you do in skis and control your center-of-gravity and not have it out in front of you. (Pause) I can relate to this. This is fun.
167:10:24|ALSJ||Fendell finds them at the one-third-meter-high rock NW of the Rover. Jack is raking; Gene moves out of the picture again.
167:11:55|ALSJ||Gene takes three "before" photos from inside the crater: AS17-146- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22399"@alsjt>22399</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22400"@alsjt>22400</a>, and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22401"@alsjt>22401</a>. These show Jack using the rake on the crater rim.
167:11:55|ALSJ||Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22402"@alsjt>22402</a> is a "locator" to the Rover.
167:12:08|ALSJ||Gene arrives with a sample bag.
167:12:41|ALSJ||Jack presents his SCB.
167:13:15|ALSJ||As can be seen in @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21706"@alsjt>21706</a>, the sides of the rake forward of the handle are made of metal sheet rather than being tines. Therefore, Jack can tilt the rake and turn it into a big scoop.
167:13:55|ALSJ||Jack has just finished pouring a third batch of soil scooped with the edge of the rake.
167:14:03|ALSJ||Jack presents his SCB.
167:14:35|ALSJ||Jack goes SE of the rake site to take a flightline series of photos. He hops north after each picture to get a stereo sequence. These photos are AS17-142- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21712"@alsjt>21712</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21715"@alsjt>21715</a>.

167:14:35|ALSJ||Gene's "after" of the sample location is @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22403"@alsjt>22403</a>.
167:15:37|ALSJ||Having hopped out of the crater, Gene gets the gnomon.
167:17:02|ALSJ||Fendell finds Jack leaving Gene's seat, headed for the gate.
167:17:02|ALSJ|LMP|The level of emotion seems to have dropped off a little bit. We'd been walking up and down that hill for quite a while.
167:17:28|ALSJ||Jack is probably taking "before" pictures of the trench site. Frames @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21717"@alsjt>21717</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21718"@alsjt>21718</a> are the cross-Sun pictures.
167:17:40|ALSJ||Fendell reaches the counter-clockwise TV stop and reverses pan direction.
167:17:46|ALSJ||Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21719"@alsjt>21719</a> is Jack's down-Sun "before" of the trench site, showing Gene in the background taking the @alsjurl/a17/a17-TGE.html"@alsjt>TGE</a> off the Rover.
167:18:24|ALSJ|CDR|The reason the camera comes off is that I've got to get close to the fender. The camera keeps you about a foot away from anything. Plus you bang up the lens.
167:18:24|ALSJ|LMP|There's something I don't think I mentioned back at Station 7. We were talking about manipulating things more easily. When I was getting samples into a bag, I had mastered how to do that without the camera interfering; where, on the first and second EVAs - like Station 3 - I hadn't figured it out.
167:18:24|ALSJ|CDR|If you had to bag something yourself, you had both a vision and an access problem. So you had to find out where your arms met each other above or below the camera.
167:18:43|ALSJ||Fendell zooms in on the rock at the rake site.
167:19:17|ALSJ||Jack's speech pattern has slowed noticeably. He spends time searching for words.
167:19:17|ALSJ|LMP|Part of the reason is that I'm tired. It also happens when I'm thinking and trying to talk simultaneously - which I never did very well.
167:20:02|ALSJ|LMP|It was a judgment call based on how deep the trench was. You'd take one at the bottom, one is the middle, and a skim off the top.
167:20:09|ALSJ||Jack's heart rate is down to about 90 beats per minute. Gene's is only down to about 110.
167:20:25|ALSJ|CDR|I was leaning over the fender, putting pressure on the Rover; and I think I was bouncing it up and down. I think that each wheel had a V-type torsion bar (see @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20453"@alsjt>20453</a>) because the Rover had been folded up for storage in the LM. We didn't have shock absorbers because we would have had dust problems.
167:20:25|ALSJ|LMP|The Rover was parked with the rear end downhill, so you were more or less able to stand there looking at it.
167:20:25|ALSJ||Fendell finds Jack southeast of the Rover, trying to angle the scoop head. He had it oriented vertically to dig the trench and now wants to set it at right angles to the handle so that he can sample the trench. Unfortunately, the locking mechanism is now thoroughly fouled with dust. He bangs the scoop head with his hand.
167:21:05|ALSJ|LMP|Anyone planning to work on the Moon or Mars ought to have Gene's statement engraved on their forehead and on the inside of their glasses.
167:21:34|ALSJ||Jack gives up on the scoop head and sets it at angle of about 20 degrees from vertical.
167:21:51|ALSJ|LMP|This confirms what I thought back when we were going through Station 7 - that the 90 degree angle was something I'd worked out in order to bag samples more easily when I was working alone. I'd hoped to do that here while Gene was doing something else; but, now, Gene's come over and we'll go back to two-man sampling routine.
167:22:10|ALSJ||Gene gets one of Jack's sample bags.
167:22:23|ALSJ||Jack's pictures of the trench are AS17-142- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21720"@alsjt>21720</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21721"@alsjt>21721</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21722"@alsjt>21722</a>, and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21723"@alsjt>21723</a>.
167:24:05|ALSJ|LMP|After I got the skim, I just stuck the scoop part way in the wall and scraped upward to get the next 5 centimeters.
167:24:24|ALSJ||Gene has been holding the sample bag at about chest height, thereby forcing Jack to fully extend his arm and raise it over his head to pour.
167:24:45|ALSJ||Gene gets another sample bag and holds it at about the same height; Jack solves the pouring problem by rotating the scoop.
167:25:25|ALSJ||They both turn to look at the trench.
167:25:37|ALSJ||Jack has taken two final "afters" of the trench. These are @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21724"@alsjt>21724</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21725"@alsjt>21725</a>.
167:26:01|ALSJ||The top of Jack's SCB is flapping open. Two sample bags have fallen out.

167:27:00|ALSJ|LMP|- (To Gene) "I don't know if you were aware of it or not, but one of the most successful experiments that we conducted was the portable gravimeter. They got great readings all across the valley; and the interpretation is great about the depth of the basalt fill in the valley - about two kilometers deep.
167:27:00|ALSJ|CDR|I'm glad; and I do think I remember that. But it was always a pain number one in the butt.
167:27:00|ALSJ|LMP|And what it tells you is that the valley used to be almost five kilometers deep before it filled up. The eruption of mare basalt started very soon after the valley formed; but there's as much as a hundred million years of play (meaning 'uncertainty'), there. Serenitatis formed at something like 3.8 billion years ago - something like that - and the oldest basalt that we brought back - from Station 5 - came out at about 3.7 something. Nobody knows for sure how many flows there were or how thick they were. Some of the late basalts in Imbrium are relatively thin - ten meters or so. Some of the layers that they see in Hadley Rille are relatively thin. But whether that applies to the stuff deeper down, nobody knows. You may have had pretty thick cooling units. It just depends on how fast that stuff came out. Probably most of the basalts - in the early phases, anyway - when the flows first start in a basin like Serenitatis, it probably erupts from literally millions of centers. It's not like out on the West Mesa of Albuquerque where you had a single crack and that's where the basalt came up. Initially, a basin like Serenitatis - 500 kilometers across - is fractured to beat all hell and, so, anything coming up from below has an infinite number of choices. And then, gradually, most of those seal off and the later flows come out of a few, discrete, individual eruptions.
167:27:43|ALSJ||They head toward the Rover.
167:27:43|ALSJ|CDR|Coming down those shallow slopes is poetry in motion. That's productive use of your time. If you could do something like helicopter skiing - have somebody drop you off at the top and pick you up at the bottom - you could really cover a lot of territory.
167:27:43|ALSJ|LMP|In that Essex study, my proposal for the Mars part of it was that you have a Rover that you can run either manually or automated. So if the pair were out working, you could have somebody else, say back at the base or the lander, remotely move it to where you want it. And then, after you leave, it can be operated remotely from Earth or from Mars orbit. I don't think it would be a big weight penalty; all it is, is electronics.
167:27:43|ALSJ||Another sample falls out of Jack's SCB. It comes out in the forward direction and into Jack's field-of-view before it hits the ground. He stops and turns to look.
167:28:07|ALSJ||Jack gets the fallen sample with the scoop and carries it back to the Rover as in an egg-and-spoon race.
167:28:33|ALSJ||Gene is at Jack's seat with the SCB. Jack goes to the gate.
167:29:40|ALSJ||Gene has removed an empty SCB, from under Jack's seat.
167:29:52|ALSJ||The reason, of course, is that Jack is doing most of the sampling while Gene holds the sample bags and then puts them in Jack's SCB.
167:32:08|ALSJ|LMP|I think that I was getting so that I didn't quite trust Houston. They kept having us fool around with the SEP and my feeling was that it was probably gone. So I'm trying to prod them a little bit, having just told them that it was 120 (degrees) and my memory, at the time, was probably that that was way outside the limits. Literally, the science room was leading us down the garden path on the SEP, because all this SEP stuff we were doing was wasting time. It had quit working when? Sometime in the first EVA, didn't it? As with the (long-period) gravimeter, they should have bit the bullet far sooner than they did. They knew what the limits were, but they kept having us dust it and tape it!
167:32:08|ALSJ||At 167:59:07, Parker will tell the crew that the SEP receiver turns itself off at 108 degrees. The temperature was 103 degrees at 163:43:51 at the start of the EVA but was 110 degrees by the time they got to Station 6. According to the @alsjurl/a17/a17psr.html"@alsjt>Preliminary Science Report</a>, the receiver switch was - unfortunately - in the Standby position, and no data was obtained during that drive. We note that Jack had reported putting the switch in the On position at the start of the traverse at 164:19:32. According to the @alsjurl/a17/a17psr.html"@alsjt>Preliminary Science Report</a>, some data had been recorded during EVA-2 on the outbound drive to Station 2 and on the inbound drive from Station 4. The crew reported a SEP temperature of 105 degrees when they got to Station 2. We note that the SEP temperature was 112 degrees throughout the inbound EVA-2 traverse, higher than the supposed cutoff, and yet data was supposedly obtained.
167:32:08|ALSJ||TV off.
167:32:08|ALSJ|LMP|I was wearing my visor with the lower edge at about eye level and, with it there, all you're getting is indirect sunlight reflected off the surface. And you don't go around staring at the Sun, anyway.
167:32:08|ALSJ||The Sun elevation is about 38 degrees. It was 13 degrees at landing.
167:32:33|ALSJ||This may be a temperature at which physical damage may occur to some of the SEP components. Bob doesn't mention the 108 degree shut off until 167:59:07, when they get to Station 9.
167:34:07|ALSJ||By pushing back on the front of Gene's helmet, Jack can get him rotating back over his knees.
167:34:42|ALSJ|CDR|At least I fell off-camera.
167:35:23|ALSJ|CDR|I don't remember this particular event but...
167:35:23|ALSJ|LMP|I can't believe I don't remember it.
167:35:23|ALSJ|CDR|It may be that I just fell on my ass trying to get on the Rover. But I never had problems getting up, and that's why I'm confused as to what this is.
167:35:23|ALSJ||Gene takes a moment to re-read the dialog starting at 167:33:28.
167:35:23|ALSJ|LMP|The thing I don't understand is why you couldn't do a push-up.
167:35:23|ALSJ|CDR|I don't understand either. I just don't recall that at all.
167:35:23|ALSJ|LMP|You know what it may have been? You may have started to kick to get on the Rover, then fell, and you were lying next to the Rover...
167:35:23|ALSJ|CDR|Caught by the slope against the Rover.
167:35:23|ALSJ|LMP|Yes. Which meant you couldn't rotate backwards. And my gratuitous advice was to get your feet downhill! (General laughter) And you must have had a feeling at some other time - probably Station 6 or 7 - that you were coming close to missing (the seat).
167:35:23|ALSJ||The dialog at 166:48:26 and following indicates that Gene parked the Rover pointed into the hill and without much of a sideslope. This suggests that Gene fell with his feet uphill. To get up by himself, he had to get his feet pointed downhill - as Jack suggested - and, because he had the Rover next to him, getting turned around would have been difficult.
167:35:54|ALSJ||The heading of 267 indicated on the checklist for the drive to Station 9 would have been valid had they done Station 8 at the south end of the planned area. Because they are at the northern end, their average heading will be more to the south.
167:36:53|ALSJ|CDR|The 240 heading - southwest - put me on the downslope side of the Rover. And what I'm saying here is that I'm never going to put myself on the downslope again.
167:37:02|ALSJ||Van Serg is WSW of Station 8, beyond the southern rim of Cochise but short of Shakespeare.
167:37:50|ALSJ||During the initial stages of the drive, they are headed more or less southwest, toward the South Massif and Bear Mountain. Jack's traverse photos are AS17-142- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21746"@alsjt>21746</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21751"@alsjt>21751</a>.
167:38:51|ALSJ|CDR|Because of the slope and the craters, we made some wide turns and I just wanted to know where we wanted to go, not how to get there.
167:38:55|ALSJ||The East Massif summit is SSE of their present position. As mentioned previously, this outcrop area is visible in AS17-146-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22367"@alsjt> 22367</a>, a photo taken from Station 8. The outcrop area is the dark blemish visible on the East Massif foothill above and slightly to the right of the SEP antenna. As they drive along, Jack takes AS17-142- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21752"@alsjt>21752</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21753"@alsjt>21753</a>, and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21754"@alsjt>21754</a>, which show, they have turned south for a moment, possibly to get around Bowen.
167:39:48|ALSJ|LMP|When I was laying out the east geophone line, I had picked out a point on the horizon to walk towards.
167:40:25|ALSJ||They are headed southwest again. Jack's traverse photos covering the drive from here to the rim of Cochise are AS17-142- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21755"@alsjt>21755</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21764"@alsjt>21764</a>.
167:40:35|ALSJ|CDR|Note the change in course.
167:41:05|ALSJ||The replacement fender has started to fail, flapping around and allowing the rear wheel to shower them with dust.
167:41:23|ALSJ||At Houston's request, they turned the LCRU off at 167:31:36 and are transmitting directly from their OPS antennas to the LM.
167:41:44|ALSJ||A hole in the high-gain antenna would indicate that Gene had caught his OPS antenna in it and, possibly, broken it off. Gene doesn't remember having such troubles in training.
167:42:29|ALSJ||Note that, despite Jack's earlier complaints about needless acknowledgments from Houston, here he wants to make sure that they are being heard.
167:43:11|ALSJ|LMP|I think that, at some point in the deep, dark past, the geologists at Flagstaff may have called the valley fill the 'plains unit'. You referred to these things as they appeared in the (overhead) photographs - the floor, the plains of the valley. They may have called it the plains unit at one time and then, because we're talking about the rocks - what's underneath that floor - decided to refer to it as the subfloor basalt.
167:43:11|ALSJ||The decision to call the bedrock "subfloor" seems to have come fairly late. The November 6, 1972 edition of the Apollo 17 Lunar Surface Procedures volume (the OPS plan) contains a paragraph headed "Plains Materials" describing the valley fill. There is a footnote to the paragraph title which reads "Or, better, 'subfloor material' to avoid confusion with the more familiar usage of 'plain' meaning the valley floor independent of any stratigraphic connotation." Prior to the flight, the geologists were not sure just what Cernan and Schmitt would find out in the middle of the valley. "The relative evenness of the valley floor at the landing site suggests that a basin-filling unit (plains material) that apparently submerged all but the highest projections of hill-forming (that is, massif) material was emplaced after formation of the trough (that is, the valley). Such fill might consist of volcanic flows (here, they were hoping for younger volcanics over mare basalts), colluvium derived from the adjacent uplands, or sheets of breccia (that is, flat layers of breccia from Imbrium and/or Serenitatis). Similar material may fill nearby uplands basins (e.g. Littrow) or may underlie the topographic bench around the eastern edge of the Serenitatis basin. Plains material is presumably exposed in the bright walls of the craters on the plains. The abundance of blocks in the crater walls and on their rims indicates that the plains material is either indurated or contains large indurated blocks. The large craters may penetrate through the plains material into the underlying massif or (Sculptured) hills units, which may represent their ejecta. Plains materials appear to be younger than the bulk of the massif and hill material and is probably older than the youngest mare fill of the Serenitatis basin. Hence, an age of Imbrium or pre-Imbrium is inferred for the plains material.
167:43:11|ALSJ|LMP|From memory, I believe they expected to see "dark mantle material" as the top unit and then had three options for the block-forming subfloor: (1) basalt, or (2) the down-faulted top of the Serenitatis ejecta, possibly partially molten 'sheet breccia', or (3) debris derived from the highlands. Also, they had no idea how thick the subfloor material might be.

167:48:50|ALSJ|CDR|- (Tongue still firmly in cheek) "At 48:50, where Jack says 'I think we've got that relationship', I don't want anyone to misinterpret the fact that we've been on the Moon three days. (Laughing) 'We can't get down to it, but at least we can take a picture.'
167:48:50|ALSJ|LMP|It'd be a little hard to have a relationship in those suits, anyway.

167:49:02|ALSJ|LMP|Gene was still talking about the rock in Cochise, and I was talking about a rock he hit.
167:49:02|ALSJ|CDR|We're moving pretty rapidly through this area. If you're going ten kilometers (per hour) and you hit a football (sized rock), you feel it. We put some dents into those wire-wheel tires.
167:49:26|ALSJ||Gene seems to be speculating that the fender has warped. He had tightened the inside clamp at Station 8 and, once he and Jack reach Station 9, they will take another look. At 167:56:11, they find that the fender has, indeed, warped. Gene brought the fender back to Earth. It is currently on display at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington. The rear portion of the fender - the last two or three inches that would have borne the brunt of the rooster tail - appears to be badly worn.
167:49:26|ALSJ|LMP|And if there is dust between the clamp and the map, it may be slipping.
167:49:46|ALSJ||Jack's photos taken during the drive from Cochise to Van Serg are AS17-142- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21783"@alsjt>21783</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21788"@alsjt>21788</a>.
167:50:53|ALSJ||"Tally-ho" is a call made during a hunt when the fox is first seen.
167:51:00|ALSJ|CDR|I was getting irritated with Bob for telling me how to get where I'm going. There was a touch of it a page or two ago and you're seeing it again here. What Bob doesn't see is that you don't just go from here to there. I might have to go around something, and I can see why I'm saying 'Damn it, I'm too good of a pilot not to know where I'm going! Don't tell me; just tell me where I need be and I'll be there.' Jack used to get irritated at Bob, and this is the first sign of my irritation.
167:51:00|ALSJ||Throughout these transcripts, Gene has shown great restraint in the face of provocation - from Jack, from Bob, and from the little misfortunes that are inevitably part of such a mission. After three days, he may be getting a little tired and, consequently, a little less willing to ignore minor irritations.
167:51:00|ALSJ|CDR|That may be. But, see, now he's infringing on my ability to navigate. He's telling me how to fly. And he doesn't know what the terrain looks like. He doesn't know how many football-sized rocks we're banging into and how many little craters we've got to go through and what the Sun is doing to us and what sightseeing we're doing along the way so that we can get up on the rim of a crater so we can get a picture. Yeah, I'm probably getting tired.
167:51:21|ALSJ|CDR|We had been moving at 10 or 12 clicks for a while but we're not moving that fast here. We're picking our way through here, probably at low speed, but as fast as we can get through the block field. With a wander factor of 50 percent, I've got to drive 15 meters to go forward 10.
167:51:52|ALSJ||Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21789"@alsjt>21789</a> shows the Van Serg ejecta and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21790"@alsjt>21790</a> shows the rim.
167:52:50|ALSJ||Gene has scraped the bottom of the Rover on a rock.
167:54:11|ALSJ|CDR|I'm out of my seat and I'm walking behind the Rover to see if I can't help Jack with his twisted seatbelt. And, while I'm there, I see the fender curled under. That's where we're getting our dust. And, maybe the other fenders were getting hot and twisted in the Sun.
167:54:11|ALSJ|LMP|- (To Gene) "Isn't it remarkable, though, that - even with the transcript - you have no image of looking at those fenders. I run into that all the time.
167:54:11|ALSJ|CDR|I can create the image here of what they looked like, but it's today's image; it's not a recollection.
167:54:11|ALSJ|LMP|Now, having read this and having heard about my belt, I can remember that now. It's a real image.
167:54:11|ALSJ|CDR|Certain things hit me like that, too. But I don't remember seeing the replacement fender curling or the others being warped. I would be kidding you if I said it was a recollection.
167:54:11|ALSJ|LMP|Another example, for me, of not having an image is all that floundering around you apparently did beside the Rover (at Station 8). And of me trying to get you stood up. Very faint bells have started to ring. And it didn't come immediately.
167:54:11|ALSJ|CDR|Me, too. And, then, I can go back earlier to Tracy's Rock and that whole slope and that whole affair came back to me beautifully. I was there. I remembered it. I remembered working around that rock. I remembered the slope. But, here, I'm losing it.
167:54:44|ALSJ||Gene has rotated Jack's footrest out of the way.
167:55:49|ALSJ||TV on. Jack is at the @alsjurl/a17/a17experiment_sep_en.jpg"@alsjt>SEP</a>; Gene is leaning over the instrument panel from beside his seat.
167:56:14|ALSJ||Fendell pans counter-clockwise, past Jack who may be trying to put some fore-aft creases in the fender to prevent the back end from folding under.
167:56:41|ALSJ||When the replacement fender was installed, the map sheets were quite stiff; they no longer are. Gene brought the replacement fender back to Earth and it is on display at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum. Ken Glover has provided a photograph of the @alsjurl/a17/a17.underfender.jpg"@alsjt>underside of the fender</a>, with the aft portion at the left. Glover writes: "From memory, I would describe the abrasion as being along the longitudinal axis, and clearly visible as far as about two inches in from one end. It has the appearance of several dark-coloured scratches. Think sand-blaster. There's also some minor fraying of the centre of the map at the very end. I believe the grid lines are still visible because the map is laminated and -- for the most part -- the plastic coating bore the brunt of the scouring and is still translucent. Obviously, the half that was clamped to the fender would not have signs of this sort of abrasion." MIssion photo AS17-137-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20979"@alsjt>20979</a> shows the top of the replacement fender as it appeared at Station 2. Note that there is tape along the shorter side only at the aft end.
167:57:46|ALSJ||Fendell pans past Gene, who has the large dustbrush in hand, headed for the LCRU.

167:59:34|ALSJ||Fendell examines a small, blocky-rimmed crater near the Rover.
168:00:51|ALSJ||Fendell finds Jack at the gate; Gene at his own seat.
168:01:55|ALSJ||Gene get the gnomon from behind his seat and then gets the dustbrush from under his seat and brushes the gnomon, trying to clean the color chart and the gray scale. After brushing for a moment, Gene taps the color chart with the brush to get some more dust off.
168:02:01|ALSJ||Gene stows the dustbrush and goes to the gate.
168:02:23|ALSJ||<i>Tiptoe Through the Tulips</i> was written by Joe Burke and Al Dubin. It first became popular in 1929 in a recording by Nick Lucas. Over two million copies of the sheet music were sold, particularly after a Lucas rendition was featured in an early 'talkie' motion picture called <i>Gold Diggers of Broadway</i>. The song re-emerged to popularity in 1968 as the signature song of the eccentric, falsetto-voiced, ukulele-playing personality @alsjurl/a17/a17.tinytim.jpg"@alsjt>Tiny Tim</a> (real name Herbert Khaury, 1932-1996, who probably took the stage name from the character in Charles Dickens's <i>A Christmas Carol</i>). Tiny Tim appeared regularly on the popular NBC television program <i>The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson</i> in 1968 and 1969. His fame/notoriety probably peaked with his on-air wedding on the Carson Show on December 17, 1969.
168:02:44|ALSJ||Gene goes to his seat, gets the tongs and attaches them to his yo-yo.
168:03:24|ALSJ||Gene goes past the front of the Rover, headed for the crater rim.
168:03:30|ALSJ||Fendell finds Jack, standing on the rim; Gene has almost reached him.
168:04:30|ALSJ|CDR|This is recall to me. This I've seen before. We're just over the rim of the crater.
168:04:30|ALSJ|LMP|You can remember walking up and, the first time you look in the crater, there's a lot more crater there than you think there is. I remember Van Serg pretty well.
168:04:30|ALSJ||Gene and Jack will both take pans of the interior of the crater. Jack's @alsjurl/a17/a17pan1682021.jpg"@alsjt>first Station 9 pan</a> consists of frames AS17-142- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21798"@alsjt>21798</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21824"@alsjt>21824</a> and will be taken at 168:20:21. Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21802"@alsjt>21802</a> shows the mound at the bottom of the crater.

168:06:41|ALSJ||Gene has moved beyond the rim crest and is now only visible from about the shoulders up.
168:07:39|ALSJ||Jack gets another sample with the scoop.
168:08:13|ALSJ|LMP|It's a big rock - too big for a bag. The bag's on one end and I'm trying to get it down in the bottom of his SCB so that the bag stays attached.
168:08:13|ALSJ|CDR|We did that a number of times, to protect or identify a rock.

168:10:15|ALSJ||Gene seals this sample bag by twisting the tabs, rather than flipping the bag.
168:10:38|ALSJ||Jack moves out of the way so that Gene can take "after" photos AS17-146- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22417"@alsjt>22417</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22418"@alsjt>22418</a>. He stepped to his right and turned slightly to his left between the frames.
168:11:08|ALSJ||They both look around, looking for Shorty-like features and/or pieces of subfloor gabbro.
168:11:26|ALSJ||Jack moves farther beyond the rim crest and goes out of sight.
168:12:09|ALSJ||Jack moves southwest, parallel to the rim, his head and shoulders coming into view.
168:12:14|ALSJ|LMP|For clarification, in this paragraph my use of the word 'fragment' is confusing. I had started to use 'fragment' when I should have been using 'clast'. A 'fragment' is sort of a loose piece of rock lying around; these were pieces in a breccia, so they're 'clasts'. I never found out what the light-colored clasts are; I don't think I ever looked into it. There was a mixture of material thrown from the sides of the North Massif and the subfloor-(derived) regolith, so the light-colored clasts are probably the pulverized and reworked material from the North Massif bound up in a matrix of regolith breccia.
168:12:14|ALSJ||According to the @alsjurl/a17/a17psr.html"@alsjt>Preliminary Science Report</a>, the Van Serg "soil breccias" contain "a variety of clasts, including basalts, several types of glasses, some breccia fragments with accretionary coats, and a variety of recrystallized felspathic rocks presumed to be derived from the surrounding highlands." The caption to figure @alsjurl/a17/a17psrf7-4.jpg"@alsjt>7-4</a> suggests that at least some of "light-gray" clasts are the pieces of felspathic breccias.
168:13:05|ALSJ||Because they are well out on the valley floor and shouldn't be standing on more than a few meters of regolith and/or mantling, an impact the size of Van Serg should have brought up subfloor gabbro.
168:13:16|ALSJ|LMP|What Gene's referring to, here, is that this stuff looked a little bit like the blue breccias up on the North Massif (at Stations 6 and 7) because, in appearance, it was dark, bluish-gray with the white clasts. As it turns out - and I don't remember if we came to the conclusion before we left (the Moon) or not - these were those regolith breccias.
168:14:10|ALSJ||Jack finally presents his SCB to receive Gene's glass sample.
168:14:26|ALSJ||Pele's Tears are small drops of volcanic glass, a reference to the Hawaiian volcano goddess and to @alsjurl/ap-geotrips.html"@alsjt>geology field trips</a> Gene took to the island of Hawaii - also known as the Big Island - during training for both Apollo 14 and Apollo 17.
168:15:10|ALSJ||Jack takes down-Sun picture AS17-142- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21795"@alsjt>21795</a>; Gene gets cross-Sun stereopair AS17-146- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22419"@alsjt>22419</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22420"@alsjt>22420</a>.
168:15:43|ALSJ||Jack turns toward the Rover to take "locator" photos AS17-142- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21796"@alsjt>21796</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21797"@alsjt>21797</a>; Gene moves in with the tongs to collect the sample.
168:16:06|ALSJ||Jack takes the glass sample, but drops it.
168:16:06|ALSJ||Gene has used the last of the sample bags in the bag holder attached to his camera. We can see the empty holderstill attached to his camera until about 168:19:06.
168:16:17|ALSJ||Gene retrieves the sample with the tongs and Jack takes it again.
168:17:20|ALSJ||Fendell de-zooms and it's hard to see any detail of what they are doing.
168:17:45|ALSJ||Fendell zooms in again. Gene gets a sample bag from Jack's supply.
168:17:56|ALSJ|LMP|The sample was just a little too big for the bag.
168:18:28|ALSJ||Gene presents his SCB.
168:18:28|ALSJ|CDR|At this stage of the game you get frustrated trying to use your hands. Not that the enthusiasm isn't there. During the first EVA you probably would have shoved it in there but it gets to the point where its difficult. Your dexterity is not what you want it to be. I think you're probably more efficient with your hands; you learn to adapt with your hands as well as with anything else, but now you're fighting (fatigue).
168:18:28|ALSJ|LMP|- (To Gene) "In terms of what you could do ungloved, how much less efficient are you?
168:18:28|ALSJ|CDR|Less than half.
168:18:28|ALSJ||We then asked Gene if, compared with the start of the EVA, he was taking longer to do tasks or had lost the ability to do certain tasks.
168:18:28|ALSJ|CDR|I don't think you lose your ability; you just get frustrated. You're probably smarter in the use of your hands. You know what you can't do, so you don't try to do those things. So you say, 'Well, it's almost done, so I'm not going to worry about the rest of it.' I can almost hear the frustration. Three consecutive days, twelve hours a day in a suit, is a long time.
168:19:01|ALSJ||Just before Jack moves close to Gene we get our last look at the empty bag holder attached to Gene's camera. We get our next look at Gene's camera a 168:20:13. At some point during this interval Gene removes the bag holder and tosses it into Van Serg. It can be seen in a detail (@alsjurl/a17/a17det21805.jpg"@alsjt>222k</a>) from frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21805"@alsjt>21805</a> in Jack's pan.
168:19:27|ALSJ||Gene takes a step farther away from the Rover, a maneuver that puts him a bit lower than Jack and makes working on the SCB a bit easier.
168:19:37|ALSJ||They will each take a pan, the distance between them giving a wide stereo of the crater. Gene's "after", cross-Sun stereopair is AS17-146-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22421"@alsjt>22421</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22422"@alsjt>22422</a>. He stepped to his right between frames.

168:23:39|ALSJ||Gene reaches the Rover; Fendell zooms in on Jack, who is still at the crater rim.
168:23:59|ALSJ||Gene has taken a measurement with the @alsjurl/a17/a17-TGE.html"@alsjt>TGE</a> on the Rover and will now make one with the TGE on the ground to see if there is any significant difference. The second measurement is 670, 057, 101 at 168:29:42.
168:23:59|ALSJ||Jack gets his scoop and climbs to the rim, having been slightly beyond the crest.

168:24:32|ALSJ||Jack takes AS17-142- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21825"@alsjt>21825</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21826"@alsjt>21826</a>, which show Gene at the Rover, taking the @alsjurl/a17/a17-TGE.html"@alsjt>TGE</a> off the back. He probably intended these two photos as "locators".
168:25:21|ALSJ||Jack puts the sample in his shin pocket, gets the scoop and moves northeast, rather than radially.
168:25:21|ALSJ||Gene's 500mm photos of the North Massif are AS17-139- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21212"@alsjt>21212</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21229"@alsjt>21229</a>. Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21219"@alsjt>21219</a> is a good photo of one of the North Massif outcrops.

168:25:21|ALSJ||Frames @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21249"@alsjt>21249</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21268"@alsjt>21268</a> are photos of the @alsjurl/a17/a17pan1682535C.jpg"@alsjt>North Massif outcrops and boulder tracks</a>. Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21225"@alsjt>21255</a> is probably the best of these.
168:26:21|ALSJ||The scoop head has just come off the extension handle.
168:26:40|ALSJ||Jack leans on the extension handle to retrieve the scoop head. As he rises, he has to run forward several steps to maintain his balance.
168:26:40|ALSJ|LMP|I used the extension handle as a prop so that I could reach down, in a dynamic fashion, grab the scoop and regain my balance. I did avoid sticking the female end of the extension handle in the ground. I didn't want to fill it with dust, so I turned it around and used the handle end. This exercise may be an indication of me getting tired and getting a little bit careless in the way I retrieved that scoop because, if I'd tripped, I'd have been on my face...I would have been in Van Serg. Either it was a very dumb thing to do or I had a hell of a lot of confidence in my ability to do it. I suspect it was the former.
168:26:40|ALSJ|CDR|I think that, all through this station, you can see us getting tired. You can go back to the start of the station and see where everything was going 'normal'. But, here, we're saying thing like 'Well, it'll have to do.' And we wouldn't have been saying that earlier.
168:26:40|ALSJ|LMP|We sort of hit a wall here. We'd been out for five hours and, while I don't remember it so much in the first EVA, in the second we had this same emotional up and down. I don't know whether we'll come back up again, here. But we did on the second EVA. We went down (emotionally) at (Station) 3 and back up at 4 and then there was a let down again (during the drive from Shorty to Victory) and then back up at 5.
168:26:40|ALSJ|CDR|I think this is a combination of the amount of work we did on this EVA on those hillsides and of three solid days of working - and not the greatest amount of sleep. I would predict that if we went out on a fourth day or a fifth day, the total slope (that is, the average trend of their emotional state) - not the up and down of a single EVA, but the total slope - would start darting back up. Who knows? I'm not tired of watching what we were doing, but I sympathize with the amount of effort we were putting out on this third day.
168:26:40|ALSJ|LMP|This had to be our most physical day. We rode (and rested) on the Rover for a solid hour getting out to Station 2 on the second day and, here, we only had fifteen or twenty minutes between demanding stations.
168:26:40|ALSJ|CDR|And they were demanding stations. We haven't had a piece of level ground (during this EVA) until now
168:26:53|ALSJ||Jack strides back to the Rover.
168:27:41|ALSJ||Fendell pans the TV camera to Gene, who is still using the 500 mm camera.
168:28:22|ALSJ||Gene has put the lens cap on the 500 and is now putting the camera under his seat. He did give a mark on the gravimeter, at 168:24:37.
168:29:25|ALSJ|LMP|Here, I was probably thinking about the sample I'd taken up on the rim.
168:29:27|ALSJ|LMP|While he was talking, I must have taken a swipe into the dirt near the Rover.
168:29:31|ALSJ|CDR|I was still thinking about getting some of the glass balls. I wasn't impressed by the white.
168:29:31|ALSJ|LMP|I don't think you'd seen it yet. You were on one side of the Rover and I was on the other. In fact, I think I remember that.
168:29:31|ALSJ||Fendell pans clockwise.
168:30:06|ALSJ|LMP|While Gene was reading the gravimeter and was talking to Bob, I must have started to dig a trench. I could dig those trenches pretty fast. In what - maybe twenty seconds - I was able to get several scoops out and I had a flat wall trench.
168:30:06|ALSJ||It wasn't obvious at this point in the review whether Jack had been able to get the scoop back on the extension handle. Momentarily, Fendell will find them and, as soon as he does, it is immediately obvious that Jack is using the scoop rather than the LRV Sampler.
168:30:11|ALSJ||AS17-142-21827 to 21829 are Jack's photos of the Station 9 trench.
168:30:40|ALSJ|LMP|- (Laughing) "It doesn't take much to get your enthusiasm back up. Because, all of a sudden, there's a whole different tone in my voice. It may be a combination of having seen something different and the fact that Houston's now put some pressure on us to get out of there.
168:30:40|ALSJ|CDR|It also shows that you've got to have someone on the spot to make a decision. They're saying get out and we're saying 'Sorry, guys, we're not going to get out for five minutes because we've got something we think is worthwhile.' That's the way you have to operate. The ground is an advisor; it's a flight planner; it's a lot of things. But you've got to make the decisions of what you're going to do with your time.
168:30:40|ALSJ||I then mentioned a conversation with Conrad and Bean in which they indicated that they had trained very tightly to their timeline. They had a great deal to do, in a small area, and not much time to be on the Moon. I noted that, on the longer missions, the tasks were not spelled out in such detail and asked for comments.
168:30:40|ALSJ|CDR|It's a natural maturation of the program. More time gives you more flexibility. But, as Jack mentioned earlier, we never did have a nominal station. They give you thirty minutes and they want an hour's worth of work. It's just normal. Using the time is never a problem.
168:30:40|ALSJ||Fendell finds them west of the Rover. The lighting conditions emphasize that Gene has gotten very dirty by this late in the mission.
168:31:05|ALSJ||Gene gets a sample bag from Jack's camera holder.
168:31:40|ALSJ||Fendell zooms in on the trench.
168:32:16|ALSJ||Houston has been discussing a possible extension at this station. However, the Flight Director is concerned about tired hands.
168:32:16|ALSJ|LMP|While we were doing this sampling, in the background on the video tape we can hear Gerry Griffin acting like a Flight Director. In trying to be objective about what we've seen here at this station, I thought he might have taken hold of the apparent fatigue a little bit sooner.
168:32:58|ALSJ||Fendell pans clockwise.
168:33:02|ALSJ||Jack needs to take occasional photos documenting the traverse.
168:33:48|ALSJ||Fendell finds both of them at Gene's seat.
168:34:18|ALSJ|LMP|I don't know why I remember this, but I think that the DSEA - which was the SEP recording tape - had a locking bolt that came up into a slot with a little winged, butterfly-shaped bow that you screwed down. And I think that what Gene found is that it was just sitting in there - that the bow had tripped.
168:35:56|ALSJ||Gene goes to Jack's seat.
168:36:00|ALSJ|LMP|I think that ground is showing some sensible decision making, here. Their taking new information - namely the white underneath the dark that we just discovered and sampled - and deciding to take a double core here, rather than taking pot luck at some other place. A bird-in-the-hand type philosophy.
168:36:44|ALSJ||Gene takes the scoop off the extension handle.
168:37:20|ALSJ|LMP|I think this exchange is another symptom of my being tired.
168:37:20|ALSJ|CDR| It was a symptom of being tired. My willingness to do the core had nothing to do with my geologic expectations. I was just saying, 'Whatever we're going to do, let's just get on with it'.
168:37:20|ALSJ|LMP|Had I really been thinking, (I would have realized that) those rocks are so soft you'd go through them (with the core) anyway.
168:37:35|ALSJ||Jack gets a core tube out of Gene's SCB. Gene is holding an upper section.
168:37:55|ALSJ||They connect the core tube sections.
168:38:40|ALSJ||Gene goes around the front of the Rover; Fendell follows him.
168:38:53|ALSJ||Jack wants to put the explosives package somewhere where it won't get in Gene's way as they leave.
168:39:00|ALSJ||Fendell finds Gene hammering the drive tube, north of the Rover.
168:39:28|ALSJ||Just as Bob says this, the tube penetration comes to a halt.
168:39:33|ALSJ||After two more hammer blows, Gene seems to break through whatever was blocking progress and the core begins penetrating again.
168:39:42|ALSJ||Gene stows the hammer in his shin pocket.

168:39:42|ALSJ||Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21857"@alsjt>21857</a> shows Gene with the core at the back of the Rover. A @alsjurl/a17/a17det21857.jpg"@alsjt>detail</a> gives good views of the charge transporter, the extension handle attachment to the upper drive tube, and the replacement fender.
168:39:42|ALSJ||David Harland has assembled frames @alsjurl/a17/a17.1683949_dmh.jpg"@alsjt>21856 and 21858</a>, which show Gene carrying the core tube back to the Rover at about 168:40:28.
168:39:57|ALSJ||Gene pulls the core out of the ground with his left hand. It takes about 12 seconds. Gene then rotates the core so that it is parallel to the ground and examines the outside from the top down toward the bit. As he finishes the examination, he lightly touches his forefinger to the soil exposed at the tip.
168:40:28|ALSJ||Gene goes to the Rover, using his forefinger as a core plug.
168:40:57|ALSJ||That is, Gene has capped the bit end of the lower section.
168:41:13|ALSJ||Fendell finds them at the gate.
168:41:31|ALSJ||Gene goes to Jack's seat with the lower section. He gets a cap and screws it on, then puts the section under the seat. Jack turns to present the left side of his PLSS. Gene gets a cap for the upper section that Jack has been holding.
168:42:24|ALSJ||Gene is talking about the pins that hold the extension handle to the upper section. This is the extension handle which is normally attached to the rake. Gene gets the rammer and goes to Jack's seat; Jack goes to the gate.
168:43:23|ALSJ||Jack giggles at the thought.
168:45:19|ALSJ||Fendell is looking in the direction of the marker flag on the Explosives Package. It is orange. When Fendell first pointed the TV at the horizon beyond it, he was at minimum zoom and the flag was just a few picture elements across and, therefore, just a faint blur of color. After a while, someone noticed the patch of color and Fendell zooms in to see what it is. Because it is actually in the very near field, rather than in the far field, zooming only blurred it more.
168:45:49|ALSJ||There are prior references to the "Italian Flag" at @alsjurl/a17/a17.clsout2.html#1470136">147:01:36</a> during the drive back to the LM at the end of the second EVA. The flag is shown here in AS17-143- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21837"@alsjt>21837</a>. The actual color is international orange.
168:45:49|ALSJ|LMP|I think that it was Bob who told me that they really didn't have any idea - when he started to call us - of what that was. None! And I don't think I've ever seen this sequence in a NASA tape.
168:45:49|ALSJ|CDR|I have never seen this picture until just now. Never. Never!
168:46:42|ALSJ||TV off; static
168:46:50|ALSJ||Gene goes to the front of the Rover to take pictures of Jack jumping in his seat. The three pictures are AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20452"@alsjt>20452</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20453"@alsjt>20453</a>, and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20454"@alsjt>20454</a>.
168:46:50|ALSJ|CDR|It was sort of a target of opportunity. It was just one of those (unplanned) things you do. And it's a pretty good picture.
168:47:38|ALSJ|CDR|I did whatever I'd done the last time (at Station 8 when he fell as he tried to mount the Rover) - got my foot caught on something, or whatever.
168:48:05|ALSJ||Because of the four-wheel steering, Gene will turn toward the charge to get around it. If he turned left, the back wheels of the Rover would turn toward the charge - although, in this case, the separation is substantial.
|ALSJ||Jack's first photo of the drive back to the LM is AS17-143- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21859"@alsjt>21859</a>, which shows a distinctive boulder at the right side of the image.

168:49:27|ALSJ||AS17-143-21860 to 21863 cover the next portion of the traverse.
168:50:32|ALSJ||AS17-143- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21864"@alsjt>21864</a> shows Gatsby from the east. Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21865"@alsjt>21865</a> is taken after Gene turns to give them a better view into the crater.

168:54:02|ALSJ||Bob is referring to the contour map on the back of the traverse map.
168:55:46|ALSJ||AS17-143-21871 to 21873 may be taken at about this time.
168:56:27|ALSJ|LMP|I think I was using 'alpha' or 'A' for 'Apollo', and Bob was using 'Bravo' in the sense of 'job well done'. It's possible that I had something going with those guys. It's possible, but I just don't remember.
168:56:39|ALSJ|LMP|- (Laughing very loudly) "That I remember!!
168:56:39|ALSJ|CDR|- (Laughing) "The fastest we went was coming off of the Scarp and, for a short period of time, we did hit 17 clicks (kilometers per hour). But, here, I think we set this one up.
168:56:39|ALSJ|LMP|Sometimes in my talk, I say that, in normal terrain you can push the Rover up to 10 to 12 clicks. But that, one time going downhill, we had it up to 18 kilometers per hour and regretted it. And we were bouncing.
168:56:39|ALSJ|CDR|But I do think that we set this one up; we wanted to go down in history. I was with Johnny Rutherford (an American race driver of Indianapolis or 'Indy'-type cars) one time. I'd asked him to give a talk about a year or two ago. Someone asked him a question and he was talking about being the fastest human or having the fastest time at Indy or something and I got up there and said that I didn't think that that was right. I said, 'I drove a little race car about 17 kilometers per hour on the surface of the Moon, and that makes me and Jack Schmitt the fastest race car drivers in the world. And he said, 'Well, what are you talking about?' And I said, 'When you add 17 kilometers per hour to the rate the Moon travels around the Earth..." (General laughter
168:56:39|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Brian Lawrence notes, " Rutherford was born in 1938, drove in twenty four Indy 500s, his rookie year being 1963. He won in 1974, 76, and 80. I suspect that the occasion Gene mentions was soon after the 1973 event, because Johnny set a new one-lap record of 199.071 mph, and a 4-lap record of 198.413 mph driving a Gulf McLaren. Both records lasted until 1977 when they were beaten by Tom Sneva." Brian and I are both race fans, he of Formula 1, primarily, and me of Indy-cars, primarily.
168:56:54|ALSJ||AS17-143-21874 to 21882 are Jack's pictures of their approach to the big block near Sherlock Crater.
168:57:11|ALSJ||I have marked a likely candidate for this boulder on a high-resolution scan ( @alsjurl/a17/a17GatsbySherlock.jpg"@alsjt>1.5 Mb</a> ) made from a print of AS17-2309. The candidate boulder is marked '168:57:10'. The distances from the photo stop made on the east rim of Gatsby at 168:51:03 and from the sample stop just north of Sherlock at 168:59:46 are consistent with the travel times. See, also, Figure 7e ( @alsjurl/a17/a17profpap-f7e.jpg"@alsjt>0.8 Mb</a> ) in the Professional Paper.
168:57:22|ALSJ|LMP| 'Evenly sorted' is an oxymoron. 'Sorted' implies that there's a non-random organization. 'Evenly sorted' means it's random. It's not very good jargon. It's used; but it's not very good jargon. And by 'massive', I mean that there is no other organization - the material within the vesicles didn't seem to have phenocrysts or alignments or anything like that.
168:57:38|ALSJ||Unlike the LM, Geophone Rock, Turning Point Rock, and Tracy's Rock, this boulder is not readily apparent in the high-resolution pan camera image of the landing site taken from the Command Module.
168:57:41|ALSJ||AS17-143-21883 to 21885 are the next in Jack's sequence of traverse photos. 21883 may show the Sherlock rim.
168:58:16|ALSJ||AS17-143- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21886"@alsjt>21886</a> is Jack's photo of the large block on the Sherlock rim.
168:59:00|ALSJ||AS17-143-21887 to 21890 are taken during the approach to the next Rover sample stop. Note the distinctive rock above the TV camera in @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21890"@alsjt>21890</a> and compare with Gene's photo AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20455"@alsjt>20455</a>.
168:59:02|ALSJ|LMP|Two or three kilometers away on either side, we're surrounded by highlands - high mountains with entirely different kinds of rocks. Yet I don't think we ever recognized any fragments of the breccias from the mountains. You would have thought that some would have been thrown in there in 3.8 billion years; but we just didn't see any. The interpretation, now, is that, at about 3.5 (billion years ago), there was a mantling of the dark pyroclastics with a little bit of orange soil mixed in. And then, over time, that's just been reworked into the soil and it's so fine grained that it may have absorbed fragments into it.
168:59:02|ALSJ||I asked about the depth of the regolith on the massifs, wondering if it was deep enough that you wouldn't get a lot of ejected fragments.
168:59:02|ALSJ|LMP|It's deeper (than on the valley floor), but it should give you some instant rock - some regolith breccias. And those would survive if they were hard enough. They find stuff (from the Massifs) in the soil, but no coarse fragments.
168:59:51|ALSJ||Jack's photos taken during the final approach to the sample site are AS17-143-21891 to 21893.
169:00:19|ALSJ||During our review, Jack noted that, at this point, his voice quality changed dramatically as he looks down to see what he's doing, getting his chin as far down on his neck as possible.
169:00:48|ALSJ||That is, Jack wants Gene to turn toward the north so that there is no Rover shadow on Jack's side of the vehicle.
169:01:34|ALSJ||They both take documentation photos. Jack's is AS17-143- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21894"@alsjt>21894</a> and Gene's is AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20455"@alsjt>20455</a>.
169:02:07|ALSJ|CDR|I think I was probably going pretty slow. As long as you don't hit those things hard and fast, you're okay. So I just went over it with the wheel.
169:02:32|ALSJ||AS17-143- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21895"@alsjt>21895</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21905"@alsjt>21905</a> are Jack's photos taken during the next few minutes.
169:03:23|ALSJ|LMP|Obviously, I was just running something through my mind out loud and (when) it didn't make sense to me, I decided to forget about it.
169:03:35|ALSJ||As shown in AS17-143- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21906"@alsjt>21906</a>, Gene takes a turn to the south, probably to get around a crater. Frames @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21907"@alsjt>21907</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21908"@alsjt>21908</a> are subsequent traverse photos.
169:04:01|ALSJ|LMP|I have an image of what the Challenger looked like coming back from Station 5 on the second EVA, but not from here.
169:04:01|ALSJ|CDR|Me, either.
169:04:01|ALSJ||They both take pictures. Jack's is AS17-143- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21909"@alsjt>21909</a>. The LM is just to the left of center, as indicated in a @alsjurl/a17/a17lbl21909.jpg"@alsjt>labeled version</a>. Gene's photo is AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20456"@alsjt>20456</a>. The LM is just under the angle of the high-gain.
169:04:46|ALSJ||Bob's reference to "last night" may be an indication of how tired he is, as well. I haven't been able to find a discussion of this EP deployment during the closing stages of EVA-2 or during the subsequent discussions in the cabin. More likely, Bob is referring to the EVA-3 pre-brief conducted while Gene and Jack were eating breakfast. It is now about 10:30 in the evening in Houston and, like everyone else, Bob has had three long days.
169:05:10|ALSJ||AS17-143- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21910"@alsjt>21910</a> seems to be Jack's only traverse photo taken between the spot where they saw the LM and the fractured boulder at San Luis Rey mentioned at 169:07:24.
169:07:21|ALSJ||AS17-143- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21911"@alsjt>21911</a> may show the fractured rock at San Luis Rey. Frames @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21912"@alsjt>21912</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21913"@alsjt>21913</a> are taken during the remainder of the drive up to the point where Jack gets off west of the SEP transmitter array to deploy a seismic charge.
169:07:37|ALSJ||Cuff checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17eva3_lmpcdr28.gif"@alsjt>LMP/CDR-28</a> shows a sketch of the complex. Compare with a @alsjurl/a17/a17prsci6-3det.jpg"@alsjt>detail</a> from Apollo 17 @alsjurl/a17/a17psr.html"@alsjt>Preliminary Science Report</a> Figure 6-3.
169:09:34|ALSJ||After they unload the Rover at the LM, Gene will drive the Rover out to its final parking place near the SEP transmitter, a spot far enough east of the spacecraft that the TV audience on Earth can watch the launch. This final parking place is called the VIP site, recalling the close-in viewing stands at the Cape reserved for Very Important Persons.
169:10:34|ALSJ||The range reading of 0.2 indicates that the Rover navigation system thinks they are 150 to 250 meters from the SEP transmitter, an error of about 100 to 200 meters, depending on whether or not the indicator is about to click down to 0.1. This close to the SEP, the difference between the bearing readout of 221 degrees - about SW - at the true bearing of about 270 is almost meaningless. Further information of the cumulative range error becomes available when Gene gets back to the LM at 169:18:00.
169:10:34|ALSJ|CDR|It worked great. They knew where we were, even when we didn't.
169:10:46|ALSJ|LMP|I'd probably noticed this rock during the first EVA when we were laying out the SEP. It was non-vesicular and fine grained, which was what attracted my eye.
169:10:46|ALSJ||This rock is @alsjurl/a17/a17Sample70215.pdf"@alsjt>sample 70215</a>, an 8.11 kilogram piece of fine-grained basalt. It is the biggest rock that they brought back. Jack will collect it at @alsjurl/a17/#1691501"@alsjt>169:15:01</a>.
169:10:55|ALSJ||What Jack doesn't realize is that the rake, the scoop, and both of the extension handles have fallen off the Rover, somewhere between here and Station 9.
169:11:03|ALSJ||The geopallet is attached to the Rover chassis behind the seats. There is a latch behind Gene's seat and, behind Jack's seat, the pallet is attached to the geopost. If the latch on Gene's side was unlocked, then the pallet could pivot. The "gate", in turn, is attached to the pallet and is also hinged behind Jack's seat. The gate latch has been giving them trouble throughout the EVA and it seems most likely that it is the gate that is swinging open.
169:11:48|ALSJ||The rack containing the explosive packages is mounted behind Gene's seat. In the picture Gene took at Station 9 of Jack mounting the Rover - AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20453"@alsjt>20453</a> - it is visible below the rake.
169:12:27|ALSJ||AS17-143- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21924"@alsjt>21924</a> is Jack's "locator" from behind the Rover. Note that the rake and scoop are missing, having fallen off at some time since they left Station 9. The Big Bag is mounted on the pallet. Gene's comparable photo, taken from his Rover seat, is AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20457"@alsjt>20457</a>. The SEP transmitter is to the right of the high-gain mast.
169:12:27|ALSJ||For future reference in determining the distance of the final Rover parking place from the LM, EP-2 is about 190 meters from the spacecraft.
169:12:27|ALSJ|LMP|- (Comparing the EP-2 "locator" with the VIP site "locator", AS17-143- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21932"@alsjt>21932</a>) "It looks like Gene parked the Rover about a third closer (actually about twenty percent) and, when that thing went off, the back of the Rover must have gotten splattered a little bit. This business of the explosives packages brings up the question of long duration activities on the Moon away from a radiation shelter and what you would do in the event of a solar particle event. We didn't worry about them because we figured that the probability was low enough that we'd just deal with whatever happened.
169:12:27|ALSJ|CDR|And we couldn't have dealt with big ones.
169:12:27|ALSJ|LMP|But if you're going to have a lunar base, you're going to have some kind of emergency capability. You'll have maybe a half hour - possibly as much as an hour - warning, although nobody's quite worked that out yet. But one way to deal with it is to excavate a trench with a linear charge, drive the Rover over it (to form a roof), get into the trench and, with an umbilical, attach yourself to Rover consumables. You have the walls protecting you and you can even think about putting low molecular weight material (e.g. water) in the floor of the Rover to give you additional protection. It's a neat idea; and it actually comes from Jim Blacic up at Los Alamos. And the reason I brought it up here is that people say, 'Explosives on the Moon!?' And you've got to remind them that we've already done that.
169:12:27|ALSJ|CDR|I was just thinking that it would be neat to be able to take a little tour back to the valley of Taurus-Littrow and see what things look like. See where the Ascent Stage hit (on the South Massif); see where the Rover is splattered with material from that bomb; see the remnants of the Descent Stage. Even if you had to do it remotely, I would really like to see what that area looks like.
169:13:38|ALSJ||Because Gene removed the data storage unit at Station 9, the SEP experiment is now non-functional.
169:13:41|ALSJ|LMP|I think that I didn't bother with the seatbelt because I was going to get off in just a little ways to pick up the big rock.
169:14:24|ALSJ|LMP|I think I tried to do some solo sampling on the first EVA, and I think I'd dropped a sample bag.
169:14:32|ALSJ||AS17-143- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21925"@alsjt>21925</a> is taken at about this point and shows the dark rock. Note the Rover tracks and, beyond the LM, the ALSEP.
169:15:00|ALSJ||The sample is @alsjurl/a17/a17Sample70215.pdf"@alsjt>70215</a>, an 8.1 kg fine-grained basalt, the largest rock Apollo 17 brought back to Earth. AS17-143- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21926"@alsjt>21926</a> is Jack's documentation photo of the sample location. AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20458"@alsjt>20458</a> is Gene's "locator". Note that the Rover tracks in the foreground are not particularly dark. Frames @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20459"@alsjt>20459</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20460"@alsjt>20460</a> are two subsequent photos Gene takes as he drives closer to the LM, and these show dark tracks.
169:15:20|ALSJ|LMP|It's a classic, old comedy routine. You start to pick something up and you kick it out ahead of you.
169:15:45|ALSJ||As described at 169:46:26, pieces of this rock were later put on public display and are the only pieces of the Moon that the public has ever been allowed to touch.
169:15:58|ALSJ||This is a reference to Gene's discovery of a piece of brown packing material near here during the SEP deployment. The details are given at 123:03:34 and 123:28:18.
169:16:08|ALSJ||Jack is thinking about the sample he collected at Van Serg with the @alsjurl/tools/judy80.gif"@alsjt>LRV Sampler</a> and, just for a second, forgot that he had put it in his shin pocket at 168:25:35.
169:16:13|ALSJ||Gene is wearing one pair of tongs on his yo-yo. Jack is getting a second pair off of the gate, rather than getting Gene's as he did at the end of EVA-2. See the discussion at 147:06:38 and following, and at 147:48:55 and following.
169:18:00|ALSJ||The readings are the bearing to the SEP transmitter, the distance driven, and the range from the SEP. Usually, Gene inserts a decimal point into the range readout but, here, gives the raw, three-digit reading rather than saying "0.1" kilometers. The actual bearing is about 080 and the range is about 150 meters. Because the distance from the LM to the SEP is short, the bearing error is meaningless. The range reading of 0.1 means that the navigation system thinks the range is between 0.05 and 0.15 km, an indication of a relatively small error.
169:18:11|ALSJ||Gene may be having trouble with his seat belt.
169:18:27|ALSJ||The battery 2 temperature gauge has malfunctioned, hence Gene's "forget 0".
169:18:27|ALSJ||Gene and Jack have driven a total of 36.0 kilometers and have used 57.2 amp-hours -plus another 14.8 amp-hours for LCRU operations - out of the 242 amp-hours available. Their average use rate of 1.58 amp-hours/km is similar to the 1.67 am-hours/km used on Apollo 15. The use rate on Apollo 16 was nearly twice as much due to an unexplained malfunction.
169:18:56|ALSJ|LMP|I believe they were looking for Descent Engine effluents and, to my knowledge, they were never able to detect any.
169:18:56|ALSJ||TV on.
169:18:56|ALSJ||Jack is stowing drive tubes at his seat. He is on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva3_lmp29.gif"@alsjt>LMP-29</a> and Gene is on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva3_cdr30.gif"@alsjt>CDR-30</a>.
169:20:49|ALSJ||Jack takes SCB-7 to the ladder footpad and then returns to the Rover. He is now on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva3_lmp30.gif"@alsjt>LMP-30</a>. Note that the SCB on Jack's PLSS is not attached at the bottom. @alsjurl/a17/Fendell-Bio.pdf"@alsjt>Fendell</a> has been panning left. Note that there is nothing on the ladder hook. Fendell stops pannding with the MESA in view. The ETB is hanging from the front of the MESA on the left.
169:21:34|ALSJ||Fendell has panned right and finds Gene near the ladder, reading his checklist. The bag bag is one the ladder hook, swinging. Evidently, Gene has just hung it there. EVA-3 photo AS17-143-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21924"@alsjt>21924</a>, taken at @alsjurl/a17/a17.trvlm3.html#1691228"@alsjt>169:12:28</a> after Jack dismounted to deploy EP-2, shows the big bag mounted in the forward surface of the geopallet.
169:21:40|ALSJ||Jack takes another SCB to the footpad; Gene reaches to switch to his auxiliary supply of feedwater. In order to reach back, Gene brings his arm up to about chest height and slightly adjusts the lateral orientation before he swings it back. On this first attempt, he can't quite reach the switch, brings his hand forward about a foot, and then swings it back again, this time successfully getting hold of the switch.
169:21:40|ALSJ|CDR|That's not atypical. That's what you had to do to work against the stiffness in the bearings.
169:21:57|ALSJ||Gene still has to get Jack's SCB off.
169:22:25|ALSJ||SCB-3 was on the accessory staff next to the control panel. Gene and Jack go to the Rover.
169:23:18|ALSJ||Fendell is looking at the pile of equipment at the ladder.
169:23:29|ALSJ||Jack's EP-2 "locator" - AS17-143- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21924"@alsjt>21924</a> - shows that the rake and scoop were gone at that time. A comparison with AS17-135- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20542"@alsjt>20542</a> suggests that the extension handles came out of the mounting brackets. Those are shown most clearly in AS17-146- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22296"@alsjt>22296</a> which was taken at the end of Station 6. At 169:38:29, they will confirm that the extension handles were lost, that it was a failure of the mounting brackets that caused the losses.
169:23:29|ALSJ|LMP|A bunch of Okies going across the countryside, dropping stuff right and left.
169:23:29|ALSJ||This is a reference to comic images of refugees from the Oklahoma Dust Bowl, a severe drought of the 1920's, driving to California with all of their earthly possessions piled high on a decrepit truck.
169:23:29|ALSJ|CDR|It was a good time to lose them, I guess.
169:23:29|ALSJ|LMP|- (Chuckling) "One thing to think about, Geno, is: if I had been successful in getting us a fourth EVA and we had gotten to this point with no rake and no scoop, what would the mission planners have done in replanning the fourth EVA?
169:23:29|ALSJ||In response to a June 2002 question from NASA Johnson veteran Michael Duke about pre-flight thinking about activities to be conducted during a fourth EVA, Jack writes, "No matter what had been planned for a 4th EVA, I suspect that it would have been hard to resist going back to Station 4 at Shorty Crater for some more investigation of the geology of the orange and black pyroclastic glasses. As you know, they are exposed in several spots and a layer in the case of the black. "A more extensive sampling of Mg-suite clasts and breccia layers at the base of the South Massif and closer investigation of basalt stratigraphy around Camelot probably would have been productive as a second priority to Shorty. We never did get much insight into the Sculptured Hills, but I am not sure how we would have been able to. There were no obvious exposures or boulders."
169:23:44|ALSJ||Jack goes to SCB at the footpad.
169:24:23|ALSJ||Both of them go to the Rover.
169:24:36|ALSJ||They go around the ladder and then south of the LM, Jack carrying the LRV sampler and Gene the SESC can. They are both moving easily and rapidly. Jack is using a running walk; Gene is kangaroo-hopping.
169:24:38|ALSJ||@alsjurl/alsj-LM-Coord.jpg"@alsjt>minus-Z</a>" is the rear (east) footpad, and the sample is to be obtained from under the LM, just forward (west) of that pad.
169:24:49|ALSJ||The ALSEP stowage compartment is in the southeast facing sector of the Descent Stage. Gene is holding the SESC while Jack gets some soil with the LRV Sampler. Jack has already taken a pair of stereo, down-Sun," before" photos of the sample site. These are AS17-143- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21927"@alsjt>21927</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21928"@alsjt>21928</a>.
169:25:56|ALSJ||Gene is asking Jack to remove the Teflon seal-protector from the SESC.
169:25:56|ALSJ||Gene's feet have been visible under the LM. He now turns to face the spacecraft. Jack is taking a cross-Sun "after" stereopair. These are AS17-143- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21929"@alsjt>21929</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21930"@alsjt>21930</a>.
169:25:56|ALSJ|CDR|I was patting the radar for doing a good job; I was saying 'Thank you' It was just a personal touch.
169:25:56|ALSJ|LMP|There's something in the back of my mind that there was an ad on commercial radio or television at the time that said 'Blank built better'. Ford or Chevy, maybe. And Gene was just putting 'radar' in the phrase.
169:26:47|ALSJ||Here, Jack is referring to the pictures he took after hanging the cosmic ray experiment from the rear strut during EVA-1. Gene stops a few feet from the Rover, closing the SESC.
169:27:09|ALSJ||Jack returns to his Rover seat, having come around the north side of the LM.
169:28:19|ALSJ||Jack returns to the Rover.
169:28:55|ALSJ||Jack goes around the front of the Rover, having just consulted his checklist.
169:28:57|ALSJ||Fendell moves the TV to watch Gene at the right-rear, replacement fender.
169:29:06|ALSJ||In 2011, a reader asked if the lost clamp was brought back to Earth. After searching the EVA-3 transcript for discussions of the fender and clamp, I am confident that the clamp fell off during the drive from Station 9 back to the LM and that it is still lying on the surface somewhere along the inbound Rover track. Briefly, at Station 8 at @alsjurl/a17/a17.sta8.html#1665200"@alsjt>166:52:00</a>, Gene noticed that the inner clamp was no longer holding the replacement fender. He fixed it before they left, finishing at @alsjurl/a17/a17.sta8.html#1672122"@alsjt>167:21:22</a>. At @alsjurl/a17/a17.trvsta9.html#1674111"@alsjt>167:41:11</a> during the drive to Station 9, Jack told Gene that dust was "raining" on them again. Once they got to Station 9, Gene examined the fender and, at @alsjurl/a17/a17.trvsta9.html#1675414"@alsjt>167:54:14</a> said "That fender just curled under; that's where we're getting the dust." Because Gene had spent several minutes at Station 8 securing the inner edge of the replacement fender with the clamp, he would have mentioned that the cclamp was missing if if had fallen off. That let's us conclude it was still in place. Once they were back at the LM and Gene had an opportunity, at 169:29:06, to examine the fender, he said "Well, we eventually lost one clamp. Let's see what we've got left on here." The implication is that, given what he'd seen at Stations 8 and 9, he wasn't surprised that the clamp had fallen off during the drive from Station 9 back to the LM.
169:29:36|ALSJ||Fendell looks at the gravimeter, which is on the ground beyond the right rear fender. Gene's football sized rock is sample 79035, an 8.1 kilogram dark-matrix breccia.
169:30:17|ALSJ||When he said "document the geophone", Bob may have been referring to documentary photos of the seismic charge Gene will deploy near the VIP site. "When he deploys it" probably refers to the charge and the phrase "we will not deploy it for the long-term experiment" refers to a planned deployment of the camera on the Rover seat as indicated on checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17eva3_cdr30.gif"@alsjt>CDR-30</a>. Specifically, the checklist calls out "Pos(ition) LMP cam(era) vert(ically) on seat." Gene remembers that he did put the camera on the seat, with the lens pointed at the zenith. Presumably, the intent was to recover the camera at some future date to get information of long-term exposure to the lunar environment.
169:30:17|ALSJ|CDR|Parker said 'We'll bring them both (that is, both cameras) back,' but I know what I did with that camera. I left it on the Rover pointed straight up. That's what I planned to do and that's what I did. I can remember specifically wedging it - I don't remember exactly where - somewhere up between our seats.
169:30:17|ALSJ||There is further discussion about this matter of the 70 mm cameras at 170:26:25 and 183:40:39.
169:30:31|ALSJ||Gene goes east of the LM with his camera and takes pictures looking back toward the LM and Rover. These are AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20461"@alsjt>20461</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20470"@alsjt>20470</a>.

169:30:31|ALSJ||Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20467"@alsjt>20467</a> is a good picture of Jack at the Rover with the MESA in the foreground.

169:30:31|ALSJ||After a while, Jack goes to get the ETB, which is hanging from the edge of the MESA, and takes it to the Rover. Gene also returns to the Rover.
169:31:59|ALSJ||At the start of this EVA, at @alsjurl/a17/a17.trvsta6.html#1635620"@alsjt>163:56:20</a>, Houston asked Jack to put the cosmic ray experiment in the ETB to protect it from a "little solar storm".
169:31:59|ALSJ|LMP|So, originally, it was going to be out there for the full three EVAs and they made a real-time change because they predicted a solar flare? (Chuckling) Thanks guys. What about us? Couldn't we get in the ETB? Well, there's a limited number of things you can worry about. Right, Gene? Like having to deal with Schmitt all the time.
169:32:05|ALSJ||Jack had started the game of using girls names for the magazine at the start of the EVA at 118:15:29. Gene joined the game only once, when he used "Franny" for magazine FF at Station 6.
169:32:05|ALSJ|LMP|I was just doing it, looking at the magazines and coming up with names. Probably, I couldn't remember how to spell Eileen.
169:32:05|ALSJ||While Jack was talking, Gene crossed Fendell's field-of-view, going to the LM. He came back to the Rover almost immediately.
169:33:13|ALSJ||Fendell pans clockwise past the ladder.
169:33:24|ALSJ||Fendell finds Jack at Gene's seat. He flips his gold visor down and removes mag Karen from the 500.
169:33:24|ALSJ||Gene may be taking a couple of pictures of Jack. If so, they are AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20471"@alsjt>20471</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20472"@alsjt>20472</a>. In 20471, note that Jack's visor is raised. In 20472, it is down. Frame 20472 is far the better picture and shows, among other things, Jack's cuff checklist and the high-gain sighting scope. Note the amount of dirt on the Rover console. Journal Contributor Ben Zarlingo notes that the open back of a camera can be seen at bottom center in 20472. This the Hasselblad fitted with the 500mm lens. Jack has the magazine he's just removed in his left hand.
169:34:16|ALSJ||Gene goes around the back of the Rover. Jack begins taking things out of Gene's seat pan.
169:35:04|ALSJ||Jack is not wearing a camera at the moment.
169:35:37|ALSJ||Jack takes the ETB away. He is now on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva3_lmp31.gif"@alsjt>LMP-31</a>.
169:35:56|ALSJ||Fendell pans to the LM.
169:36:36|ALSJ||Fendell pans to the MESA and finds no astronauts; he then pans clockwise. This is one of several reference to suit engineer Danny Schaiewitz who participated in many of the training exercises.
169:37:25|ALSJ||Fendell finds them at Gene's side of the Rover.
169:37:28|ALSJ||Jack waves his arms to dislodge the harness.
169:37:43|ALSJ||Jack takes his harness toward the LM, presumably to throw it under the Descent Stage.
169:38:06|ALSJ||Gene doesn't yet realize that the extension handles, to which the scoop and rake were attached, were also lost during the drive back from Station 9. Normally, they would attach one of the extension handles to a core tube in order to hammer it into the ground without having to bend over.
169:38:29|ALSJ||That is, Gene is saying that he can hammer the core tube in without the extension handle.
169:38:32|ALSJ||Fendell pans toward the MESA. Gene is at the gate.

169:40:36|ALSJ||Bob is subtly trying to remind Gene and Jack that they had planned a short close-out ceremony before Gene drives the Rover - and, more importantly, the TV camera - out to the VIP site. The close-out ceremony is not listed in the checklist.
169:40:44|ALSJ||It is currently about 0434 GMT on 14 December 1972. the Moon is still about 40 degrees the western horizon at Goldstone and 24 degrees above the eastern horizon at Honeysuckle Creek. Comm will now go thru Honeysuckle.
169:41:08|ALSJ||Fendell finds Gene at his seat, unfolding a large bag. Bob is still trying to remind them about the close-out ceremony.
169:41:14|ALSJ||Fendell pans counter-clockwise.
169:42:01|ALSJ||Fendell reverses the TV pan direction.
169:42:04|ALSJ|LMP|Gene is talking about the Station 9 rock he had put in his footpan; and that's already been packed. So I reached down and picked one up. I remember that. It was relatively flat, I think.
169:42:04|ALSJ||In 1975, N.G. Bailey and G.E. Ulrich of the U.S. Geological Survey produced an annotated, partial transcript of Apollo 17, selecting out those parts of the dialog of immediate interest to geologists. They identify this hand-sized rock as 70017, a 3.0 kilogram piece of coarse-grained basalt.
169:42:58|ALSJ||Gene manually points the TV at Jack and then goes out to join him.
169:43:06|ALSJ||Jack hands Gene the tabular, fist-sized rock that he's been holding.
169:44:45|ALSJ|CDR|The idea was there; the thought was there. But if I was going to say it again, I'd say it a little bit more eloquently. I'd thought about it a little bit beforehand but, like a lot of things, not a great deal. The thought, the idea, but not the words. And I guess we got the point across.
169:44:45|ALSJ|LMP|It reads well.
169:44:45|ALSJ||Readers will note that Gene's description of the rock as being "composed of many fragments" - that is, a breccia - involves a bit of poetic license. He had hoped to use a breccia in this ceremony and had ordered his thoughts with that idea in mind. However, there were no large breccias near at hand and, as we've noted, Jack gave him a piece of basalt. In the context, a bit of poetic license seems justified.
169:46:26|ALSJ||Apollo sample 70017 is now known as the Goodwill Rock. Although NASA still has about 80% of the rock in the Apollo collection, nearly five hundred pieces of it have been distributed to museums and researchers around the world. In the words of James Gooding, the Curator of Lunar Samples at the NASA Johnson Space Center, the Goodwill samples are "the most widely distributed of any lunar samples".
169:46:26|ALSJ||During our transcript review, Jack suggested that the rock they used in the ceremony never made it into the big bag and that the distributed samples might have come from the rock he had collected when Gene let him off the Rover part way back from the SEP site: "There's a piece of (Moon) rock that you can touch in the Smithsonian, and it's off that last big sample I'd stood up on end and kicked under the Rover (at 169:15:07). I think that's where that sample came from. In fact, I think that the samples they sent around to the kids around the world may have come from that same rock. It was a big rock; a real dense, heavy rock (Apollo 17 sample @alsjurl/a17/a17Sample70215.pdf"@alsjt>70215</a> weighed 8.1 kilograms).
169:46:26|ALSJ||Jack was partly right about this. The Goodwill Rock - the one used in the ceremony - did make it into the big bag and was put to the intended use. Canada's portion is shown in the accompanying @alsjurl/a17/a17.canadarock.jpg"@alsjt>photo</a> (courtesy of Ken Glover), along with a small Canadian flag that was flown on Apollo 17. And then, as Jack remembers, pieces of 70215 were also used for public display. According to John Dietrich, who retired as Curator of Lunar Samples at the end of 1991, four display samples - with a total mass of about 300 grams - were cut from 70215 and can be seen at the Smithsonian, at the International Space Hall of Fame in Alamogordo, New Mexico, at the Johnson Space Center, and as the centerpiece of a traveling NASA exhibition. Unlike most lunar samples which are carefully sealed and protected, the Smithsonian and Johnson samples are routinely displayed so that members of the public can "touch the Moon".
169:46:38|ALSJ||Gene has swung the TV around to point at the LM ladder. He is now at the ladder himself and removes a cover off the plaque. He tries to hang the cover on a ladder rung but gives up and drops it to the ground. Jack takes a series of pictures of Gene and the plaque. These are AS17-143-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20480"@alsjt>20480</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20488"@alsjt>20488</a>.
169:46:38|ALSJ||As far as I know, all the LMs had plaques afixed to the ladder strut, but only on Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 was it mentioned by the crews. Journal Contributor George Green reminds us that, in the Ron Howard film <i>Apollo 13</i>, Tom Hanks, playing Jim Lovell, is shown in the LM with a plaque. This undoubtedly represents a replacement plaque flown in the actual spacecraft because of the very late crew change. Technicians did have access to the LM until not long before launch. For example, Apollo 16 photo @alsjurl/a16/ap16-72-H-425.jpg"@alsjt>72-H-425</a> shows a technician with the plaque for that mission on 12 April 1972, four days prior to launch. In the case of Apollo 13, it is possible that the @alsjurl/a13/a13.plaque.jpg"@alsjt>replacement plaque</a> was not completed in time for installation.
169:48:57|ALSJ||Gene and Jack start for the Rover but stop again and move to stand in front of the camera as they listen to Fletcher.
169:49:35|ALSJ||Gene salutes as he stands facing the TV.
169:50:43|ALSJ|CDR|Little did we know that it would be this long - nineteen years later and even longer yet - before Man will ever return. I don't think that either Jack or I ever thought - and we kept saying that Apollo 17 was the end of the beginning and not the end - that it would take this long for this nation or mankind in general to decide not only when he's going to return but if he desires to go back to the Moon and then on to Mars. Finally, we're at a point in time where people are beginning to talk seriously about it happening. But as we sit here today, in 1991, we all know it's going to be after the turn of the century before Man goes back again. That, in itself, is almost an unacceptable position to be in. If we had realized that nineteen years ago...We kept saying that, well, we're the last for a while but somebody will be back pretty soon. I've got to believe that both Jack and I certainly felt that it would be in the time frame of the 20th Century.
169:50:43|ALSJ|LMP|I knew things had slowed down. I don't know if you remember, Gene, but, when we rendezvoused with Ron - and I think it was just before or just after we undocked with the LM - Houston read us a statement from Nixon in which he said, specifically, that we were the last people to visit the Moon in this Century. And I really got upset. I think I either showed it or talked to you about it. I thought that was the stupidest thing a President ever could have said to anybody. You may believe it privately, but why say that to all the young people in the world.
169:50:43|ALSJ|CDR|And don't forget, this was in 1972, so we had thirty years to go before the century was over.
169:50:43|ALSJ|LMP|It was just a totally unnecessary thing for him to say. Whoever wrote that speech really blew it with that remark. And I was really upset. Tired, but really mad. It was just pure loss of will.
169:50:43|ALSJ||The statement from Nixon was read up by Gordon Fullerton right after Challenger docked safely with America. It reads, "As Challenger leaves the surface of the Moon, we are conscious not of what we leave behind, but of what lies before us. The dreams that draw humanity forward seem always to be redeemed, if we believe in them strongly enough and pursue them with diligence and courage. Once we stood mystified by the stars; today we reach up to them. We do this not only because it is man's destiny to dream the impossible, to dare the impossible, and to do the impossible, but also because, in space, as on Earth, there are new answers and new opportunities for the improvement of, and the enlargement of, human existence. This may be the last time in this century that men will walk on the Moon, but space exploration will continue, the benefits of space exploration will continue, and there will be new dreams to pursue, based on what we learned. So let us not mistake the significance or miss the majesty of what we have witnessed. Few events have ever marked so clearly the passage of history from one epoch to another. If we understand this about the last flight of Apollo, then truly we have touched a 'many splendored thing'. To Gene Cernan, Jack Schmitt, and Ron Evans, we say God speed you safely back to this good Earth.
169:50:43|ALSJ|CDR|I knew we wouldn't be back in ten years; but we're talking about as many as thirty-five or forty years. And that's a generation and a half. The kids who are in grammar school now are the people who are going to be taking those trips back to the Moon and on to Mars. So we've got a generation in there that we've left in limbo. I don't really want to get into this - and the Shuttle is a sophisticated flying machine - but, whether it's the Shuttle or Soyuz or Mir, there is a difference between a space program that takes you to 300 miles away from your home planet and another one that sets you out on a voyage a quarter million miles away. There are significant differences, both technologically and philosophically. And, quite frankly, I'm a little disappointed in us, at this time, to know that we're really not much further along than we were back then.
169:50:43|ALSJ|LMP|We're not as far. Then, at least we had a technology base. Now, we've got to rebuild it.
169:51:04|ALSJ||Gene faces southeast and shades the indicators with his hand.
169:51:25|ALSJ||Bob laughs, realizing that Gene wants to see how far he can throw the @alsjurl/a17/a17-TGE.html"@alsjt>TGE</a>.
169:51:40|ALSJ||Gene throws the gravimeter toward the southwest with a half hammer-throw motion. It lands out of sight, behind the Rover. Jim Scotti notes that the bright-blue @alsjurl/a17/a17-TGE.html"@alsjt>TGE</a> and its impact marks can be seen in AS17-145-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22197"@alsjt>22197</a>, which Gene took out his window once he and Jack were back in the cabin.
169:52:26|ALSJ||In Houston, Experiments suggests to Flight Director Gerry Griffin that, as a result of Gene's treatment of the gravimeter, "that calls for another bias reading." Griffin replies, "You'll have to get it yourself.
169:52:37|ALSJ||TV off. Gene is on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva3_cdr31.gif"@alsjt>CDR-31</a>.
169:53:15|ALSJ|CDR|John Young drove his Rover out there to do the same thing - to get a picture of lift-off. And John may have told me something about positioning the Rover.
169:53:15|ALSJ|LMP|You know what I think it may have been? I was thinking about it a moment ago. (AS17-143-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21932"@alsjt>21932</a> shows that) you positioned it at an angle to the line between the VIP site and the LM so that the TV camera had a better field-of-view. When we were looking at the picture before, I wondered why you left it parked that way.
169:53:15|ALSJ|CDR|I agree. Whatever I'm referring to (here) has got to do with the parking of the Rover.
169:53:47|ALSJ||They no longer have a right-rear fender and, even in the short drive out to the VIP site, it will get covered with dust. If the Rover electrical system is to survive for very long, Gene will have to give it a thorough dusting.
169:55:12|ALSJ||When Gene arrived back at the LM at 169:18:27, the Battery 1 temperature reading was 132 degrees. It is now 139 degrees, hot enough to have tripped a warning flag on the top of the console.
169:56:28|ALSJ|CDR|As I remember, I went around behind the VIP site and drove up to the spot. So the antenna was probably looking pretty close to the Earth.
169:56:47|ALSJ||That is, Houston wants photographs taken while he's standing 7 feet north of the Central Station, and then another from the east, with the Sun at his back.
169:57:28|ALSJ||AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20489"@alsjt>20489</a> is a cross-Sun to the south, showing top half of the Central Station and, beyond it, Geophone Rock. Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20490"@alsjt>20490</a> shows the lower part of the north face where the switches are located. Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20491"@alsjt>20491</a> is the down-Sun from the east. All three are excellent pictures.
169:59:15|ALSJ||Because of the great distance between the Earth and Moon and other factors, Fendell will have to command the TV camera to start panning upward about 2 seconds before the actual launch. That way, the camera will actually start tilting up at the right time. The farther from the LM that Gene parks the Rover, the smaller the fraction of the TV frame that the LM will fill; and any mistakes Fendell makes in the panning speed won't matter quite so much. From the time that Fendell pushes the button in Houston to move the TV camera until the time he actually sees the camera move is about 6 seconds. In the first two seconds, the signal leaves Houston and travels by land or satellite link to one of the three large transmitters (Goldstone, Honeysuckle, or @alsjurl/MDSCC.html"@alsjt>Madrid</a>), then travels to the Moon (1 1/3 seconds out of the 2 seconds), and activates the TV tracking motors. During the next four seconds, the signal leaves the TV and travels back to Earth where the color-wheel signal is translated into a standard video signal for display in the Control Room.
169:59:15|ALSJ|LMP|In my talks I use a 35 mm slide of the TV picture of lift-off (which is necessarily grainy), and I say, 'Gene tried to persuade me to go out and get a really good picture of lift-off, but I declined.'
169:59:15|ALSJ|CDR|It would have been great to have a camera on the Moon to watch the Lunar Module come in for a landing. I'd love to have that.
169:59:15|ALSJ|LMP|- (Philosophically) "Some day.
169:59:15|ALSJ||An @alsjurl/alsj-LRVFinalParking.html"@alsjt>analysis</a> of mission photographs of the LM taken at the final parking place and at the SEP deployment site indicate that Gene will park the Rover about 158 meters from the LM.
169:59:40|ALSJ||<blockquote>Gene has climbed on the Rover and, as he drives a short way to the "little rise", we get a few seconds of video from the moving Rover.

Transmission to Earth requires that the high-gain antenna be pointed almost exactly and, here, we get a bit of video by luck. The LM can be seen at the left side of the image.

170:01:00|ALSJ|CDR|I sit here (looking at the picture) and swear that I parked the Rover with the wheels straight. That's the final parking? Well, we're behind the LM and it's about the right distance.
170:01:00|ALSJ|LMP|Why doesn't it have a fender?
170:01:00|ALSJ|CDR|I took it off. Both of them. I took them both home.
170:01:00|ALSJ||At some point before he goes back to the LM, Gene will remove the replacement fender - which is now at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington. He will also remove the rear section of the left rear fender - which is now on display at the Johnson Space Center's Visitor's Center.
170:01:21|ALSJ||Gene has parked the Rover pointed a little bit south of west, necessarily in the general direction of the LM so that the TV can be used to watch the launch. Because Earth is in the southwestern sky, the bore sight on the high-gain antenna is over the batteries and Gene is having to lean in to do the alignment. The normal Rover heading at one of the geology stops was 045 (northeast). With that heading, the high-gain was pointed back over the Rover and Gene could stand comfortably at the front of the vehicle to do the sighting.

170:04:42|ALSJ|CDR|They generally had a flight unit, a backup unit, and a qual unit (of most pieces of equipment).
170:04:42|ALSJ|LMP|My guess is that they didn't build a backup gravimeter.

170:12:47|ALSJ||Fendell has been panning clockwise and reaches the rear of the Rover. Part of Jack's seat is visible and there is no camera or lens in evidence. However, even if Gene has put the camera in place by now, he remembers putting it between the seats, and that part of the Rover is hidden behind the console. Before going to remove the neutron flux probe from the deep core hole, Jack takes three more ALSEP documentation photos.

Evidently, this is the control panel on the left side of the unit which, given the orientation of the Rover, is the south side. They want the LCRU mirror uncovered so that it can radiate and keep the unit relatively cool, and they want to cover the side panel with the blanket to minimize the amount of sunlight it absorbs.

170:14:23|ALSJ||Fendell points the TV at the LM; Gene is in the way.
170:14:57|ALSJ||In brief, the neutron probe consists of targets containing either boron or uranium-235 which, upon capturing neutrons, emit alpha particles or fission fragments which are then captured by plastic or mica detectors. The instrument consists of an outer tube containing the detectors and a central core containing the targets. Because the targets and detectors do not cover the whole surfaces of the core and tube, respectively, the core can be twisted so that the target/detector pairs are either next to each other or 180 degrees apart. In the latter case, very few alpha particles or fission fragments are captured by the detectors and, therefore, the instrument is "off".

170:17:43|ALSJ||At this point in our transcript review, Jack remembered that the 500 mm lens was mounted on the third camera which was stowed under Gene's seat. The Apollo 17 Spacecraft Packing List confirms the fact, as does the Surface Checklist. We also noticed in the TV that, at this point, Gene is not wearing his 70 mm camera, having taken it off to do the high-gain alignment and other Rover close-out tasks.
170:18:10|ALSJ|LMP|- (Telling Gene the LSG story) "The LSG was supposed to be a very-long-period gravimeter to sense free-oscillations of the Moon if a gravity wave went by. It was the only potential Nobel-Prize-winning experiment ever taken into space by Apollo. From the very beginning - the initial drawings - they had a mis-design on the weight of the balance beam by a tenth of a gram. It was never picked up. And I didn't know if you remember or not, but when we deployed the flight hardware for the last time in that big Air Force hanger (at the Cape)...We had insisted on deploying the flight hardware. They weren't happy about that, but we insisted on doing it and they had to repack it. But at that time, we stood around and talk about it and I asked "Have you tested the uncaging of the balance beam in a simulated one-sixth g tilt plane?" And they said, "No." And I said "Why?" And they said, "Because the manufacturer had said it would disclose proprietary information." So I probably said, "Well, you ought to do it," and then just forgot about it. Nobody ever tested the uncaging of that balance beam. And it wouldn't uncage. It was just that one-tenth of a gram too heavy and wouldn't uncage to the degree necessary to be a long-period gravimeter. And if you want to be upset about something, you can be upset about that.
170:18:10|ALSJ||A more complete discussion of the LSG can be found at 137:45:08.
170:18:10|ALSJ||Fendell finds Gene at his seat. He takes an empty SCB to the gate. Fendell pans back to the LM, then points the camera down to look at the battery covers and scans the soil near the Rover.
170:19:43|ALSJ||The fact that Gene does not mention the 500 mm camera suggests that he has set it between the seats.
170:19:43|ALSJ||Gene takes AS17-143- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21931"@alsjt>21931</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21934"@alsjt>21934</a>. One of the best of these is @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21933"@alsjt>21933</a>. Note Gene has removed the replacement fender and, from the left side, the rear extension. One seismic charge remains in the transporter. Gene will deployit at the west end of the SEP antenna array at @alsjurl/a17/#1702416"@alsjt>170:24:16</a>
170:20:41|ALSJ||Gene is now on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva3_cdr33.gif"@alsjt>CDR-33</a>. In Houston, Fendell tells the Flight Director that the distance is "well over" the 450 feet (137 meters) he needs. An @alsjurl/a17/alsj-LRVFinalParking.html"@alsjt>analysis</a> of mission photographs of the LM taken at the final parking place and at the SEP deployment site indicates that Gene parked the Rover about 158 meters from the LM.
170:20:50|ALSJ||Fendell points the TV back to the LM and finds Jack running toward it.
170:23:44|ALSJ|CDR|We hadn't gotten off the surface yet, and we still needed all the help we could get.
170:23:44|ALSJ|LMP|Somebody, I think, had put the message on a rung of the ladder.
170:23:44|ALSJ|CDR|I guess it had to be up there. It was just as I barely got out. I guess I've got to go along with that. My nature would have been to see that and read it. It was a response to whoever put it there.
170:23:44|ALSJ|LMP|It may have been pasted on the strut.
170:23:44|ALSJ||As indicated previously, we have been unable to find anything in the photos that looks like a message. However, we only have good, sharp images of about the lower two-thirds of the ladder and strut. And it is entirely possible that there is a message to be found when the site is visited next.
170:24:49|ALSJ||Once again, Fendell examines the ground near the Rover.
170:25:43|ALSJ||AS17-134-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20507"@alsjt>20507</a> may have been taken at this sample site as a locator. In the distance, we see Gene working around the Rover at the VIP site.
170:26:25|ALSJ|CDR|I can sit here and, just as sure as I'm alive at this moment, I can remember placing that camera (on the Rover seat). And I thought it was such a crime to leave a Hasselblad. But we were going to point it with the lens up so that, someday when someone goes back there, they can see the degradation of the lens from the cosmic radiation. And I guess I didn't do it. What can I tell you.
170:26:25|ALSJ||Gene wonders if the memory of putting the camera between the seats is actually derived from training. However, the possibility remains that he put the 500 mm camera on the seat.
170:26:33|ALSJ||At 169:51:04, Gene took a moment to see just how far he could throw something as bulky as the @alsjurl/a17/a17-TGE.html"@alsjt>TGE</a>.
170:26:49|ALSJ||AS17-146- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21935"@alsjt>21935</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21936"@alsjt>21936</a>, and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21937"@alsjt>21937</a> are Gene's "locators" from the place where he deployed Seismic charge 3. A @alsjurl/a17/a17det21936.jpg"@alsjt>detail</a> from 21936 shows the charge. Jack is at the LM, out of sight at the MESA. Note that the end of the antenna arm and, therefore, the charge, is 35 meters west of the SEP transmitter and 110 meters from the LM.
170:26:49|ALSJ||At some point before reaching the LM, Jack took six pictures of the spacecraft and flag, AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20508"@alsjt>20508</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20513"@alsjt>20513</a>.
170:27:05|ALSJ||Table 9-II gives EMU consumable status for EVAs @alsjurl/a17/a17mrp9-6.jpg"@alsjt>1, 2</a>, and @alsjurl/a17/a17mrp9-7.jpg"@alsjt>3</a>. Both Jack and Gene will consistently use more oxygen and cooling water than predicted pre-flight, but will end each EVA with comfortable margins. Jack will finish the EVA with 0.38 pounds of oxygen remaining - of 1.81 pounds loaded - and Gene will have about 0.44 pounds. The minimum acceptable level ( 'Redline' ) is 0.37 pounds.
170:27:16|ALSJ||Fendell finds Gene northeast of the LM, moving along with a long, easy skipping stride. He is carrying the replacement fender and the aft section of the left rear fender. See the discussion at 169:59:40.
170:28:37|ALSJ||If we assume that Gene left Seismic Charge 3 at 170:27:16, the 145-m run took 1 minute 25 seconds and his average speed was a very respectable 4.6 km/hr. The Apollo 17 record - at least for runs captured with the TV camera, belongs to Jack, who twice achieved 5.4 kph: once at 120:27:11 and again at 121:36:36. For reference, the best timed run on a prior mission was Charlie Duke's 7.9 kph run - 70 meters in 32 seconds - on the rim of North Ray Crater at @alsjurl/a16/a16.house_rock.html"@alsjt>167:37:00</a>.

170:29:52|ALSJ|LMP|emerges from behind the LM, moving a ways north
170:29:58|ALSJ||Jack throws the hammer with a discus motion. It is visible against the sky for a long time. Gene's pictures of the hammer throw are, AS17-143- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21938"@alsjt>21938</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21939"@alsjt>21939</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21940"@alsjt>21940</a>, and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21941"@alsjt>21941</a>. The last of these shows Jack as he apparently watches the shower of dust settle at the impact point. Check out Roberto Beltramini's @alsjurl/a17/a17-HammerFlight.html"@alsjt>animated gif</a> made from the first three frames.
170:29:58|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Danny Caes notes that we can see Jack's right eye - and, less clearly, the rest of his face in 21941. An @alsjurl/a17/a17cropped21941.jpg"@alsjt>enhanced detail</a> shows that, at the time Gene took the picture, Jack was actually looking to his left. This photo emphasizes that fact that helmet orientation tells us very little about head orientation at any given moment. The astronauts had quite a bit of freedom of head movement within the helmet volume.
170:29:58|ALSJ||In 1999, Journal Contributor Jim Scotti realized that Gene took four pictures of the hammer throw. "Some time ago, while watching Apollo 17 video tapes, I saw Harrison H. "Jack" Schmitt toss his hammer off into the distance. More recently, while browsing the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal on a cloudy night at Kitt Peak National Observatory, I happened across some B&amp;W images taken by Gene Cernan at the end of the last EVA and what did I see in one of those images up in the pitch black sky? A small streaky image that looked like it might be the hammer in flight. So, I examined some prints in the Lunar and Planetary Lab's <A HREF="http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/SIC/"@alsjt> Space Imagery Center</A> and sure enough, it is the hammer which can be seen in two consecutive images (end on in the 2nd) and in a 3rd, I found the plume of dust from the hammer's impact! Curiosity led me to dig up some images taken from inside the LM after the EVA and sure enough, with the help of the plume image telling me where to look, I found several images which show the hammer lying out on the lunar surface! <A HREF="a17.hammer.html"@alsjt>Go see the images.</A>
170:30:17|ALSJ||Because of the Rover's location east of the LM, none of the following close-out activities are visible.
170:30:47|ALSJ|LMP|I grabbed one of the unused core tubes, grabbed hold of the strut, and leaned on it underneath the LM, just behind the strut, and pushed it in as far as I could. And I think it went in about two-thirds of the way, and then I capped it.
170:35:03|ALSJ||Gene has been unable to get Jack's antenna tied down. Here, they are deciding to leave it up.
170:35:41|ALSJ||Jack is on cuff checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17eva3_lmp32.gif"@alsjt>LMP-32</a>. Gene is on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva3_cdr34.gif"@alsjt>CDR-34</a>.
170:35:41|ALSJ|CDR|Jack was supposed to turn the tracking light on so that I could see if it was blinking. Ron needed to track us visually. Bob was getting quite worried about us getting in, because I remember that I told him, 'Don't worry, we're doing it.' Jack and I felt like we had our act together. We weren't pushing against oxygen starvation or anything like that. I can see the guys back here in the MOCR saying, 'Get 'em in, get 'em in. They're down to mission-critical oxygen, a mission rule,' or what have you. But this is a time when we really felt we had it together. We knew what we were doing, we knew what we had to do. We'd been in and out of that hatch three or four times already.
170:35:41|ALSJ|LMP|It looks like I got in in two and a half minutes.
170:35:41|ALSJ|CDR|It looks like you got in awful quick.
170:37:41|ALSJ||Gene is on @alsjurl/a17/a17eva3_cdr35.gif"@alsjt>CDR-35</a>.
170:38:53|ALSJ|LMP|I wouldn't be surprised if we had almost a hundred pounds in that big bag. I think that all the big rocks were in there. But it's strange, that's still not a lot of weight. We must have been feeling the mass more than the weight.
170:38:53|ALSJ||The actual weight of the big bag, as reported at 171:36:39, is 71 terrestrial pounds or 12 lunar pounds. This is slightly more than half the 137 pounds of samples they collected during this EVA.
170:38:53|ALSJ|CDR|Relatively, I guess it was heavy. We didn't pick up a hundred pounds of stuff very often. We picked up the Rover together; but everything else we picked up - relatively speaking - was a lot lighter than that.
170:38:53|ALSJ||Fendell points the TV at the ground. This is a somewhat risky thing to do, considering that the Flight Director probably would not be eager to have Gene spend five minutes to go out and fix it.
170:39:26|ALSJ||Fendell is looking at Earth.
170:39:59|ALSJ||The ETB is hanging near the ground from the lanyard. Gene is pulling it up by hand.
170:40:42|ALSJ||Fendell points the TV at the LM.
170:41:55|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Rob Bourke had an opportunity to interview Gene during a visit to the Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California, in September 2000. He writes that his opening question concerned Gene's final words on the surface ""Was it on purpose or pure chance that the words, 'America' and 'Challenge' also happened to be the call sign names of his two spacecraft on that flight? (That is, Command Module 'America' and Lunar Module 'Challenger'.) It was a great opener. He responded with a genuine smile and said that no one had asked about that before and that it was not a coincidence at all. The crew had very carefully chosen their spacecraft names for their symbolism and he wanted to invoke those names in his final words. He had not flown to the Moon with anything prepared and his short speech had come to him, in full, only a few minutes before it was time to leave the surface.
170:41:55|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Larry McGlynn provides a photo he took, also in 2000, at the Kansas Cosmosphere, showing the back of the 'BSLSS Doff' page of Gene's EVA-3 cuff checklist ( @alsjurl/a17/a17CDRAmerChallng.jpg"@alsjt>426k</a> ). This page is the last in the checklist and the back was orginally blank. On it, Gene wrote the text of the plaque afixed to the ladder and, below the line, the words "Chall(enge) of Apollo. Door Promise.
170:41:55|ALSJ||This note is clearly related to the remarks Gene made before climbing the ladder and, in October 2005, I wrote to Gene asking if this was a reminder to himself for this purpose and when he had written the note the 'night' before the EVA. On his behalf, his Executive Assistant, Claire Johnson wrote, "To answer your questions, yes the notes below the line were a 'tickler' for Gene to remind him of what he wanted to say before leaving the lunar surface. He wanted to tie in the (LM) Challenger and (CSM) America into his final words and he wrote down the inscription on the placque as a reminder. And yes, he wrote these notes down the night before EVA-3.
170:41:55|ALSJ||I infer from this that Gene had a general idea about what he wanted to say but that, as he told Rob Bourke, he decided shortly before climbing the ladder and, in the process, changing 'Challenge of Apollo' to 'America's challenge'.
170:42:20|ALSJ||Here, Jack is closing the hatch so that he can get behind it and give Gene room to get in the cabin.
170:43:18|ALSJ||Fendell points the TV at the ground again, possibly for thermal reasons.
|ALSJ||They are now on Surface Checklist page @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf7-1.jpg"@alsjt>7-1</a>.
170:45:07|ALSJ|LMP|I don't remember exactly where the shutoff was, but I just never could reach it. Maybe not even in training. With his longer arms, Gene could handle it. I was probably standing facing the rear - which would have made it easy for him to get to the shutoff. Or, maybe I was facing inboard helping him with the door. It would have been a whole lot easier with more room in the LM; of course, (laughing) the suit probably would have expanded to fill it. Parkinson's Law applied to lunar modules.
170:45:07|ALSJ||<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law"@alsjt>Parkinson's Law</a> - : "<b>Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.</b>" was first published in a 1955 essay by Cyril Northcote Parkinson.
170:45:07|ALSJ|LMP|It disturbs me that I did training for this for over a year and it didn't get permanently imbedded in long-term memory. I wonder if actors remember their scripts? Probably not. It's probably all short-term stuff, except for pieces. But still, I trained for Apollo 15 - the same procedures. So it was 30 months and, God knows how many of these (rehearsals) we really did in that period of time. We never memorized the checklist - never tried to. The fact is, that would have been a bad thing to do, to work from memory. You'd be taking a risk of forgetting something. That's why you had the cue cards. But it's strange; why would I not remember having that difficulty (with the feedwater shutoff).
170:45:07|ALSJ||On Apollo 12, Pete Conrad and Al Bean tended to work from memory rather than the cue cards and forgot steps on a couple of occasions. In each instance, they had to use the cue cards to backtrack and take care of all the necessary steps.
170:45:49|ALSJ||The three PLSS water controls - the feedwater diverter valve and the primary and auxiliary On/Off levers - are located on the lower right front corner, with the diverter valve being at the corner and the other two being inboard from it on the front edge. The @alsjurl/plss/plss06.jpg"@alsjt>levers</a> have dramatically different shapes so that they can be easily distinguished by feel.
170:48:13|ALSJ||The oxygen control is on the chest-mounted @alsjurl/alsj-RCU.html"@alsjt>RCU</a>.
170:48:23|ALSJ|LMP|When Gene gets business-like, he sometimes talks too fast.
170:48:40|ALSJ||They are now at the top of the right-hand column of Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf7-1.jpg"@alsjt>7-1</a>. According to plan, they should be at 169:40 minutes into the mission and are, therefore, still about an hour behind, as they were at the start of the EVA. The planned start of the rest period is at 174:39 and they will actually start it at about 175:20, having gained back about a half hour. Because their workload between wake-up and launch is fairly light, they are in very good shape.
170:49:11|ALSJ|LMP|This sounds like Gene's hands were bothering him. Whatever he might have said later, he was happy to get those gloves off.
170:49:32|ALSJ||Once they get hooked up to the @alsjurl/alsj-LM-ECS.html"@alsjt>LM ECS</a> and get their PLSSs off, they will put their gloves back on so that they can depressurize the cabin, open the hatch, and jettison the PLSSs and other unneeded gear.
170:49:32|ALSJ|LMP|There was dust on everything we wore. Gene succeeded in falling and I did too - several times. The helmets had a lot of dust on them, and I suspect we got them pretty badly scratched. I don't remember the scratches very well, but we did talk about it a couple of times. However, the dust we brought in was almost all on the floor; it didn't come up and permeate the LM until we went weightless after lift-off. And then there was a lot of it. After the EVAs, there was dust flying around because, at least on the first EVA, I had a reaction to breathing it; but I don't remember there being a noticeable film of it on the instruments or anything else.
170:49:32|ALSJ||A 2005 Ulrich Lotzmann photo ( @alsjurl/a17/SchmittLEVA6.jpg"@alsjt>202k</a> ) of Jack's LEVA with the sun visor down shows some of the scratches.
170:49:32|ALSJ|LMP|What Gene was saying about Ron is that we had to take one of the helmet covers (that is, one of the @alsjurl/alsj-LEVA.html"@alsjt>LEVAs</a>) up to him so he could use it on his EVA to retrieve the film packets from the Scientific Instrument Bay (in the Service Module). Ron would never have admitted to anything (like a scratched visor) that would have kept him from doing his EVA. That was his next big thing; that's what he was really looking forward to.
170:49:32|ALSJ|CDR|Once we got to orbit, I don't think the dust was as bad as I was afraid it would be. We were concerned and were thinking about wearing our helmets to keep the dust out through the whole lift-off and rendezvous. We did wear them for lift-off, but I don't think we did for rendezvous.
170:51:24|ALSJ||They have been using the overhead valve and what may be happening here is that Jack first checked the safety on the overhead valve and is now verifying the safety on the hatch valve.
170:51:24|ALSJ||Training photo @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#KSC72PC540"@alsjt>KSC-72PC-540</a> shows the overhead valve at the upper right.
170:52:57|ALSJ||The switches for the PLSS pumps and fans are on the chest-mounted RCUs. Note that, after the second EVA Gene and Jack commented about something being hot. One possibility is that the hot object was an @alsjurl/alsj-RCU.html"@alsjt>RCU</a>. If so, it is notable that there is no comment about heat here.
170:52:57|ALSJ|LMP|Driving back from Station 5, the RCUs would have been facing into the Sun. Driving back from Station 9, they would be shaded. So you probably won't find that comment here. I don't remember if I've mentioned this but, on the long drive coming back from Station 4, I noticed the warmth of the Sun penetrating the suit on my forearm. I would ride with my forearm more or less across my chest. There was a shoulder detent that let you do that so that you could work out in front of your chest. Riding in the Rover I'd just rest my right arm in that detent. So, during the drive back into the Sun from Station 4 to Station 5 and then on to the LM, I noticed the warmth - finally - penetrating the seven layers of Mylar and warming that forearm. And it really felt good - a little therapy for those sore forearm muscles. I was probably using my left hand to take pictures and wouldn't have had that arm in the detent.
170:52:57|ALSJ|CDR|I know what Jack's saying, but I think that "detent" is the wrong word. There was enough friction (in the cabling) that you could put your arm in certain places and it would stay there, but I don't think there were any detents.
170:52:57|ALSJ||Joe Kosmo, a suit expert at NASA Johnson agrees that there were no detents. In detail, there was a pair of cables - one for the right arm and one for the left - which were attached at the center of the chest and ran over to the arm pit, then through a tube that ran up over the shoulder blade and down onto the back, and then over to a tie down at the center of the back. Friction between the cable and the tubing let them maintain a desired arm position without having the work against the internal pressure of the suit. The shoulder tubes can be seen in a @alsjurl/a17/ap17-72-H-314.jpg"@alsjt>photo</a> (scan by Ed Hengeveld) from a suit fit session which shows a subject - probably Jack - seated on a minimalist Rover mock-up. Photo @alsjurl/a17/ap17-72-H-253.jpg"@alsjt>72-H-253</a> shows Gene raising his arms during a suit fit check. The tube on his left shoulder is clearly visible. Note the small pulley apparently at the entrance to the tube on his right shoulder. In 72-H-314 a similar pulley seems to be present on the subject's left shoulder and these pulleys may have been included in the design to reduce binding and/or abrasion at the entrances to the tubes. Ron Evans does not have similar pulleys on his suit.
170:53:42|ALSJ||They want to make sure that they have the hoses hooked up properly before they depressurize the cabin for the jettison.
170:55:56|ALSJ||They are about to start the steps on Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf7-2.jpg"@alsjt>7-2</a>.
170:56:03|ALSJ|LMP|Between here and about 171:01, it sounds like there was some recovery in my voice from the let down of getting back in and struggling to get the LM configured and pressurized and stuff like that. By 171:01, I sound much more businesslike.
171:02:30|ALSJ||Bob Overmyer takes over briefly as CapCom. Throughout the Mission, he has been one of the Command Module CapComs. Houston has said goodnight to Ron Evans, who is near LOS on his 42nd orbit.
171:03:35|ALSJ||Ron Evans is now about 20 minutes into his rest period. His observations of Shorty were made at 166:17.
171:03:35|ALSJ||The phrase "pentagon complex" is one that only Ron uses and, apparently, refers to a pentagonal pattern of craters around the target point. Looking from the east, the base might be formed by East Trident and the unnamed crater north of the SEP, then Holden on the north arm, an unnamed doublet between Powell and Camelot on the south, and Camelot, itself, forming the west apex of the pentagon. There are many other possibilities in the area, but this one has the advantage of being symmetric around the CSM ground track.
171:03:35|ALSJ||A few moments later, Ron reports seeing a "sharp crater" in the area "from Tacquet on down to Menelaus or Melinor" that had "an ejecta almost the same color as the stuff around Shorty". Then, at 166:48 after he has crossed the terminator into lunar night, he has the following conversation with Houston.
171:04:05|ALSJ|LMP|At the recent - 1991 - Lunar Science Conference, a paper was presented on taking a new look at the Lunar Sounder data. And, basically, when they tried to analyze the original data, they found they really didn't have the capability to analyze it very well. Some of the digitized data that was produced here on Earth after the film data came back has disappeared. The film data is still refrigerated and in the NASA archives. There was some holographic data - and I don't understand what that means with regard to this data - and another look is being taken at it. It looks like there is still some very interesting stuff in it about large-scale layering in the lunar mare. But the sad thing is that some of the digitized data was not retained in the archives. Hopefully, somebody is going to put some effort into redoing all that. We'll see. The @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#S7253472"@alsjt>Lunar Sounder</a> was the granddaddy of the SIR system (Side-looking Imaging Radar) that flies on the Shuttle and looked at the Sahara, for example, and saw all those old water courses.
171:04:48|ALSJ|LMP|On the way out to the Moon, I started doing some exercises in which I would lie underneath the couch and grip a cross strut and run in place against the back wall of the lower equipment bay and try and get my heart rate as high as I could - just for exercise. And the flight controllers responsible for the cryogenic tanks (in the Service Module) found that the vibration was causing the tanks to stir without turning on what they called the 'fan' inside of it.
171:04:48|ALSJ||Bob Parker rejoins Bob Overmyer at the CapCom Console.
171:05:14|ALSJ||This is a reference to a slow leak in Pressure Regulator A noted during the post-EVA-2 period. Bob is suggesting that they put a piece of tape on the regulator as a physical reminder to keep it closed.
171:05:52|ALSJ||The Moon's gravity field is fairly irregular due to the presence of high density regions under some of the lunar mare. The detailed distribution of these "mascons" was not well known, particularly beneath the Farside track of America and the mission planners could only assume an average behavior based on what had happened to the Lunar Orbiters and the other Command Modules. After separating from Challenger prior to the descent, Evans fired the CSM engine to put himself in a 70 by 54 nautical mile orbit which was then expected to decay into a 60-mile circular orbit. As Overmyer says, the mascons did not cooperate and Evans will have to change the size of his orbit before the plane-change burn which will line him up with the planned ascent path of the LM.
171:07:09|ALSJ|LMP|Apparently, the MCC-H Conference was just a 60 minute pad they built into the flight plan in case we had to talk about lift-off or a LM problem of something like that.
171:07:24|ALSJ||They are performing the @alsjurl/A15-17EMUv2Sec4.2.1.jpg"@alsjt>OPS checkout</a> near the middle of the right-hand column of Surface <a href="a17LMLunarSurf7-2.jpg"@alsjt>7-2</a>.
171:09:45|ALSJ||They are checking the OPSs to see if they produce a proper regulated pressure. Each contains oxygen bottles pressurized at greater than 6000 psi and that pressure needs to be regulated down to the 3.8 psi that the suit is designed to handle. Jack's OPS is regulating at a pressure that is slightly higher than normal. Previously, Gene described plans for using the OPSs in case he and Jack were unable to dock with the Command Module and had to make a suited EVA transfer. If one or both of the OPSs fails this check of the regulators, they will keep one or both of the PLSSs rather than jettisoning them.
171:09:45|ALSJ|LMP| I don't remember the backup plan for an EVA transfer and, as we were listening to this, I thought we were checking out the OPSs so that we could take one of them up for Ron to use for his EVA.
171:09:45|ALSJ|CDR|We did use an OPS as a backup for Ron's EVA. But Ron wore hoses for his EVA and was pressurized off of spacecraft oxygen. We would never have let him go out on the OPS alone. But, we had to bring the OPSs up any way, for our EVA contingency. We'd already paid the weight penalty to bring it up to orbit, so it made sense to use one as a backup for Ron. He was out there and exposed. He could have ripped his suit or a hose could have popped off.
171:09:45|ALSJ|LMP|There was also a plan for using one of the OPSs if we had to hot-wire the LM. This last-ditch procedure was to take a line out to the batteries in the Descent Stage to Gene's circuit breaker panel to open the propellant valves. You didn't make the connection to the circuit breaker panel right away; because, as soon as you did, the valves would open and you'd be on your way. So you'd come back in (after connecting the wire to the batteries) and then, when you were finally ready to go, you'd touch the circuit breakers and hot-wire the hypergolic valves in the Ascent Stage. I think we went through that drill once to know where the batteries were.
171:09:45|ALSJ|CDR|It would have been a last ditch effort. The hatch would have been open and the wires would have ripped off.
171:09:45|ALSJ||When I told Ed Mitchell about this discussion, he said that he and Al Shepard were prepared to @alsjurl/a14/a14.clsout2.html#1352224"@alsjt>hot-wire the LM if necessary</a> and had done a walkthrough during training.
171:09:45|ALSJ||Prior to Apollo 15, two of the four 400 A-h Descent Stage batteries were located in Quad I and and two others in Quad IV, which on either side of the ladder. Because of the addition of extra water and oxygen tanks to Quad IV for the J missions, these four batteries - plus a fifth, called Battery L which was also added for the J missions - where placed the back of the spacecraft. Consequently, the wire would have been a long one.See, for example, Scott Sullivan's excellent book, <i>Virtual LM</i>.
171:09:52|ALSJ|LMP|To check the regulator, you had to have the hose blocked off and I was saying that I may not have done that. As I recall, there was a place you locked the hose in to seal it off; and then you opened the valve to see how it regulated into the hose. I interpret what I said here to mean that the hose wasn't locked down and that there was some flow out. But that would have given a lower regulated pressure; so, I don't understand this. Getting the check to come out right was important because, if you had to keep a PLSS, you might have to throw away some rocks!
171:10:09|ALSJ|CDR|Obviously, it didn't concern us. If it was regulating at 4.25 it would have made your suit harder, but it still would have been okay. If it had been regulating at 2.0, it would have been something different.
171:15:56|ALSJ||Houston has decided that Jack's OPS is acceptable as is. Once they get the OPSs stowed and get the PLSSs positioned for the jettison, they will weigh the sample containers, just in case they have hauled in too many rocks and have to jettison some of the rocks along with the PLSSs. They are moving to the tasks on Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf7-3.jpg"@alsjt>7-3</a>.
171:21:00|ALSJ||@alsjurl/nasm05758.jpg"@alsjt>Sample Containment Bags</a> were flown on the J missions to help reduce the amount of dust in the cabin. The Sample Collection Bags were put inside the @alsjurl/nasm10113.jpg"@alsjt>Containment Bags</a>. Photos of containment bags in the National Air &amp; Space collection courtesy Allan Needell.
171:22:03|ALSJ||Very Long During this break, they are weighing the sample containers.
171:22:03|ALSJ|CDR|Each pound mattered. I'm not saying that we would have thrown out a pound of rock. There were margins. But, weight translated into less Delta-V(elocity) and into fuel.
171:36:39|ALSJ||These are terrestrial weights, including the containers. The Interim Stowage Assembly (@alsjurl/apollo.glossary.html#ISA"@alsjt>ISA</a>) is a set of bags on a frame that normally hung behind Gene over his wall-mounted PLSS. An ISA can be seen on the left at Neil Armstrong's back in Apollo 11 training photo @alsjurl/a11/ap11-KSC-69PC-319.jpg"@alsjt>KSC-69PC-319</a>. Of course, when Gene was donning or doffing his PLSS or when the rockboxes were being mounted on the wall in its place, the ISA was put somewhere convenient, usually against the hatch or aft of the engine cover, or was hung on the forward bulkhead over the DSKY. For launch, it will be attached to the aft bulkhead.
171:37:53|ALSJ||They will now assemble the equipment for jettison - as listed at the bottom of the left-hand column of Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf7-3.jpg"@alsjt>7-3</a> - and then don their gloves, pressurize the suits, and perform a pressure integrity check before depressurizing the cabin.
171:39:29|ALSJ||They are near the top of the right-hand column of @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf7-3.jpg"@alsjt>7-3</a>.
171:39:37|ALSJ||Each of them has two pair of EV gloves, but have only been using one pair. As we will see at 171:54:54 and 174:52:48, they will jettison the unused pair, a departure from the checklist which doesn't call for any glove jettison. After repress - as called out in the checklist - they doffed their used gloves and stowed them on the comm panel. Now, they have re-donned the used gloves in preparation for the depress. Apparently, they have also gotten the unused gloves out of storage - an action not called out in the checklist - but have not put them on.
171:39:43|ALSJ||Gene wants to put some lubricant on his hands.
171:40:10|ALSJ|LMP|Don ran a group of contractor representatives who were outside the Mission Control Building in the tall building to the west. I can't remember the building number. And they were there to support any engineering data analysis that had to be done. This recorder, I gather, was gathering a lot of LM engineering data. I remember the recorder but I can't tell you why it only had eight hours of tape on it. But I must have left it on when we went out.
171:40:10|ALSJ||A 2001 @alsjurl/a17/a17.arabian.jpg"@alsjt>photo</a>, courtesy Tom McKeever, shows Don Arabian working on his boat.
171:40:47|ALSJ|LMP|Knowing Bob, I think he was saying that we should jettison me! Don was not going to be pleased.
171:40:50|ALSJ|LMP|This was a reference to <a href="http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/m-n.htm"@alsjt>Owen Morris</a>, the head of the Lunar Module Project Office. <a href="../AaronCohen.html"@alsjt>Aaron Cohen</a> watched over the Command and Service Module for George Low and Owen worked on the LM.
171:41:05|ALSJ||According to the checklists, the recorder was supposed to be on during flight and during the hatch opening for each of the EVAs and equipment jettisons. Specifically, Jack was to turn the recorder on during the comm check that preceded helmet donning and then turn it off just before following Gene down to the surface. For each of the EVAs, the instruction to turn the recorder off was printed on the cuff checklist and, obviously, he missed the step at the start of this third EVA.
171:41:23|ALSJ|CDR|The dust covers went over the wrist rings and were added to the program fairly late, I think, and maybe even for our flight. As I remember, they were a pain in the butt and I was adamantly against them. I was not happy about having one more piece of gear; and I remember that I got in some disagreements with some people about even having to carry them. But they wanted them to be part of the uniform and we did use them. And I will eat a little crow, because they did work better than I thought they would. Considering the amount of problems we had with dust, they did serve a good purpose.
171:42:27|ALSJ||The Rover Navigation system wasn't in operation until after the initial drive out to the ALSEP. That drive plus Gene's 200 - 300 meter test drive out to the east and back would have added the half kilometer to his total.
171:42:36|ALSJ||For the next minute or so, they seem to be struggling with one of Jack's gloves.
171:42:36|ALSJ|CDR|Generally, we each put on one of our own gloves and then helped the other guy with his second glove. Although it was possible to get both of your own on, it was generally easier with the buddy system.
171:42:51|ALSJ|CDR|There were a couple of buttons that you had to push down at the same time to unlock the wrist ring; but, to get the glove on, you just had to push it in and it snapped over. And then we had lock-locks on those gloves to make sure.
171:43:52|ALSJ||They may be leaning forward in the suits as they work on the gloves and aren't always triggering the voice-activated audio circuits.
171:45:53|ALSJ||Gene probably wants to unlock the hatch before pressurizing his suit.
171:46:38|ALSJ||We had some trouble deciding whether Jack was offering Gene some drinking water or whether he was offering to turn on the LCG pump. The @alsjurl/water_gun.jpg"@alsjt>water gun</a> (photo by Mick Hyde) is behind Jack near the floor, while the LCG pump breaker is on the panel to his right. However, by opening the pump breaker, Jack would have been departing from the checklist and probably would have been less casual about his offer. Hence, I conclude that he had the water gun in hand. Gene would have taken the water gun and inserted it in the cheek port.
171:48:19|ALSJ||They are watching the suit pressure decay in the usual manner, looking for less than a 0.3 psi decrease over one minute.
171:48:46|ALSJ||They are now setting the Suit Circuit Relief Valve to Auto - it was closed - and will feel the pressure adjustment as the suit circuit and the suits come into equilibrium.
171:48:58|ALSJ||They are now on Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf7-4.jpg"@alsjt>7-4</a>.
171:49:25|ALSJ||Gene is saying that they can use the hatch @alsjurl/DumpValve.html"@alsjt>dump valve</a> rather than the overhead valve. Without the PLSSs on, they have a great deal more freedom of movement.
171:49:44|ALSJ||Jack will open the forward @alsjurl/DumpValve.html"@alsjt>dump valve</a> while Gene watches the pressure gauge.
171:52:15|ALSJ||The idea is to make the gravimeter darker so that it would warm up by absorbing more sunlight.
171:53:20|ALSJ||This is another reference to the mock-up PLSSs used during training and to suit engineer Danny Schaiewitz.
171:53:20|ALSJ|LMP|The PLSSs were handed in for egress training and we may not have had PLSSs in the cabin, just to protect the equipment.
171:53:39|ALSJ|CDR|The PLSSs were all the same but, for some reason, the decision was made quite late on to use my backup. I don't know what happened to the primary.
171:53:49|ALSJ|LMP|I was leaning over the hatch and pushing the PLSS out with my hands. Gene was probably watching out the window. I don't think I could see down the ladder and just saw it bounce a little bit.
171:54:54|ALSJ||As indicated by a discussion at 174:52:48, they are both wearing their used EV gloves and have just jettisoned their unused gloves. The checklist does not call for any glove jettison. It does, however, call for boot jettison, which they seem not to have done.
171:55:16|ALSJ||The only reference we have been able to find to an ISS - other than Inertial Sensor System, which doesn't make sense in this context - is on page @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf7-3.jpg"@alsjt>7-3</a> in the surface checklist where the crew is instructed to "Remove ISS, Wrap &amp; Tie the Following: Lunar Boots (4), RCUs (2), Armrest (1), Yo-Yo's (2)" and then on page @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf7-4.jpg"@alsjt>7-4</a> where they jettison the ISS along with the PLSSs. Gene and Jack think ISS may be Interim Stowage Shelf, perhaps a part of the Interim Stowage Assembly.
171:55:16|ALSJ||Note that neither of the yo-yos was actually discarded. Gene's was sold at auction in early 2006 for USD 50000.
171:56:15|ALSJ|CDR|I remember that one of the PLSSs sort of got hung up on the porch and I had to get way out with my leg to get it unstuck. You didn't have room to throw them out; you just had room to push them out.
171:56:46|ALSJ||AS17-145- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22196"@alsjt>22196</a>, @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22199"@alsjt>22199</a>, and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#22211"@alsjt>22211</a> show the jettisoned PLSSs. These photographs will be taken after Gene and Jack get out of their suits.
171:57:07|ALSJ||They will do a very brief trash jettison in the morning.
172:02:11|ALSJ||Both Gene and Jack have the impression that the BRA was hung in the back of the cabin. Charlie Duke joins the conversation.
172:03:29|ALSJ|LMP|Charlie thought that all parts of the Moon looked just like all other parts of the Moon. And I think the TV of Taurus-Littrow changed his mind. He and John were in a pretty desolate, unscenic place at the Descartes site.
172:04:15|ALSJ|CDR|Charlie was CapCom on Apollo 10. When Tom Stafford and I went down in the Lunar Module over the top of the Apollo 11 landing site, I said 'Boy, we are down among 'em,' meaning that it seemed like we were going right down over the mountain tops.
172:04:15|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Brian Lawrence believes the exact quote is "We is down among 'em, Charlie.
172:04:44|ALSJ||Deke Slayton joins the conversation.
172:04:48|ALSJ||If the plane change leaves Evans in less than an optimal orbit for rendezvous, they might have to discard some of the samples.
172:05:16|ALSJ||In a moment, they will switch from voice-activated comm to Push-to-Talk. The safeties were pins with wires on them so that they wouldn't drop off and get lost.
172:05:41|ALSJ||They are now starting Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf7-5.jpg"@alsjt>7-5</a>.
172:05:58|ALSJ||Page @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf2-3.jpg"@alsjt>2-3</a> in the LM Lunar Surface Checklist lists procedures for a One-Man EVA. The reverse side - page @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf2-4.jpg"@alsjt>2-4</a> - is a procedure to follow in the event of a LM repress failure.
172:05:58|ALSJ|LMP|We probably never decided who would go out (for a one-man EVA). The back half of the page is something immaterial to the one-man EVA, and this remark suggests that we had had some discussion about who was going to be the one man.
172:05:58|ALSJ|CDR|It wasn't discussed in that much detail but, if we only had one PLSS, I suppose that - politically - we would have to have had a geologist go out. But, I guarantee you that Cernan would have been out there during part of it. We probably wouldn't have bothered with the Rover, because you wouldn't let one guy get that far away. But we probably would have each done a shortened EVA. A four-, five-, six-hour EVA - whatever we thought we could have done. And then have the other guy go out and do another one and, at least, stay there a couple of days. I don't remember specifically what our plan was; but that was one thing I always dreaded - that we would be faced with only one PLSS. That would have really compromised us. But there was no question that we would have both gone out. I wasn't going to go that far - a second time - and not go out on the surface. Period. But it would have been impractical, as well, not to have Jack go out - being a geologist. That was part of the reason for the whole trip.
172:07:10|ALSJ||The following is a discussion about the use of batteries versus fuel cells in the LM design.
172:07:10|ALSJ|LMP|The early plan, the first design reference mission that Grumman put together, was a fuel-cell vehicle. And what killed the fuel cells were the fuel-cell problems that Gemini ran into. And that scared the managers, so they went to batteries. It's unfortunate, because the Apollo fuel cell was a different fuel cell
172:07:10|ALSJ|CDR|We also had a Block II development of solar panels to take with us.
172:11:18|ALSJ||Casper the Friendly Ghost was an animated character who first appeared in a 1939 in a children's book, "The Friendly Ghost" by Seymour Reit and Joe Oriolo, then in various Paramount animated films, a series of comic books beginning in 1952, an ABC (USA TV network) from 1963 into the mid 1990s, and a live-action feature film in 1995, "Casper". "Casper" was also the name the Apollo 16 crew gave their Command Module. Here, Bob is referring to the Apollo 16 Command Module Pilot, Ken Mattingly, who will take over the CapCom console.
172:12:35|ALSJ||The background noise disappears as Mattingly takes his foot off his microphone switch. Long Comm Break.

172:25:36|ALSJ||That is, Gene is turning off his audio circuit. They will get him out of his suit first. They are now on Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf7-6.jpg"@alsjt>7-6</a>.

172:37:02|ALSJ|CDR|The pictures speak for themselves. We were pretty happy, pretty tired, and pretty dirty. Look at the faces and you can see the sense of satisfaction. And look at how dirty...look at how filthy we are! And hot. I guarantee you that underwear was soaked.
172:37:02|ALSJ|LMP|In all four of the pictures that we took of each other in the cabin, one things you can see is a prominent vein in the foreheads of both of us. Normally, you don't see it. Sometimes it will show up when you laugh and you get a lot more blood flow into your head. But I don't think I was smiling hard enough in these pictures for that to happen. Here, it's an illustration of the excess blood volume that goes into the upper body in reduced gravity. Even in one-sixth gravity, even after this long a time, and even after we'd sloughed off a lot of fluid by this time. We'd probably each lost about ten pounds because we'd lost a lot of fluids." See, also, Journal Contributor Anil Sahal's @alsjurl/alsj-fullness.html"@alsjt>discussion</a>
172:37:02|ALSJ||The following transmissions were accumulated during a press briefing and times are not readily available.
172:46:57|ALSJ|LMP|We were stowing the bags to optimize the center of gravity and, therefore, fuel consumption - particularly RCS fuel.
173:02:38|ALSJ||Gene is now out of his suit and they are probably working on Jack's, now.
173:19:13|ALSJ||Deke Slayton joins the conversation.
173:19:28|ALSJ||The checklist calls for a changing the LiOH canister after the meal and the one hour schedule padding called "MCC-H Conference" but, since they are running late, the change is coming about on time. Obviously, Gene and Jack are not only paying close attention to the detail of the checklist but understand the rationale for the when and why of each of the steps. Once again, they have beaten Houston to the punch.
173:19:44|ALSJ||That is, they can gain an hour by eliminating the MCC-H Conference.
173:20:09|ALSJ|LMP|What it sounds like is that Deke sent Ken to negotiate a minimum list of questions - which I would have argued against. You want to get information when it's fresh. And we weren't using the whole eight hour rest period anyway, so you could cut the time out of the rest period (rather than the geology debrief).

173:28:47|ALSJ||Had they actually done an emergency lift-off 18 seconds early, they would have reached orbit about 30 kilometers ahead of the Command Module. However, given that they would have been in the same orbital plane as the Command Module, the error would have been merely an annoyance. Both spacecraft would have had enough fuel to make the slight velocity adjustment need to close the gap.
173:28:53|ALSJ|LMP|I don't know where I got the number 'fifty', but I'd copied Pads a lot of times in training and a lot of times during the mission. There were a lot of them.
173:31:36|ALSJ|LMP|Because I was using the term 'anorthositic gabbro', it doesn't appear that it had really struck me yet that it (the vesicular Station 6 rock-type) was a partially molten breccia.

173:37:38|ALSJ|LMP|In this point in my thinking, I hadn't come to the ultimate conclusion that was made; and that was that Van Serg hit into a very deep zone of regolith and that the breccias we were seeing were primarily regolith breccias or what was once called 'instant rock' created by the impact. The reason that the regolith was deep there was that several large craters had superimposed their ejecta blankets in that particular region. So the regolith was probably 30 or maybe more meters thick, in contrast to the five meters out on the valley floor itself.
173:39:28|ALSJ|LMP|The material was apparently quite viscous but still hot (when it landed). It didn't shatter but broke. It was probably glassy when it hit, with some crystals in it.
173:40:14|ALSJ||The glass they found at Van Serg was undoubtedly formed in a relatively nearby impact.
173:40:38|ALSJ|LMP|I think I wasn't answering the question. I'm not sure, but photographs show that there was dark, fine-grained material streaming down the wall of Van Serg. And I'm not sure I noticed that, except in the photographs. Van Serg was actually a bench crater and the dark material was stopping at the bench. It may be that I described that. We'll see. After the mission, the people who looked at the soil samples found devitrified orange glass spheres. There was probably fire-fountaining along the bounding faults of the valley at the foot of the Massifs. That's the most likely place for the conduits to have developed.
173:40:38|ALSJ||This comment was made in a review session that was conducted long before our meeting with Gene in Santa Fe. The answer to Jack's question - did he describe the bench that the termination of the dark material at the bench? - is that, while he didn't notice the dark material, he did describe the bench which, in one sense, is visually defined where the dark streaks stop. The relevant photos are AS17-142- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21799"@alsjt>21799</a> to @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21811"@alsjt>21811</a> which are part of Jack's Van Serg pan.
173:41:17|ALSJ||Bob Parker rejoins the conversation.
173:44:34|ALSJ||The date is December 14. It is about 2:37 a.m. in Houston. Mattingly is wondering if they've had an early visit from Santa Claus.
173:46:13|ALSJ|LMP|The Sculptured Hills are almost certainly a variety of the ejecta blanket of the Orientale Basin. Why they have a different surface texture, I don't know. I think what was bothering me here is that we were seeing a large number of basaltic fragments up on the side of the Sculptured Hills where we were sampling. How they got there, I don't know. But we weren't too far from Cochise, Henry, and Shakespeare and they may be ejecta from those craters. Those are pretty big craters - as big as Camelot - and Camelot certainly had a lot of subfloor basalt around it. The theory I expressed here probably wasn't very good, except for the comments about the orthopyroxene anorthosite rock. That's good logic.
173:54:31|ALSJ||The planned maximum weights were 40 pounds aft of the engine cover; 40 pounds in the LHMS (Left-hand Mid-Section) which is a stowage area just aft of the area where Gene's PLSS had been stowed and, now, the rock boxes are fastened to the wall; 40 pounds each in the LHSSC and RHSSC (left-hand and right-hand-side stowage compartments) which are below the side instrument panels; and 50 pounds in the @alsjurl/apollo.glossary.html#ISA"@alsjt>ISA</a> (Interim Stowage Assembly).
173:54:31|ALSJ||Frank and Stacey O'Brien have provided a view ( @alsjurl/CAM000378.jpg"@alsjt>0.7Mb</a> ) of a RHSSC in a LM simulator taken in 2002 at the Cradle of Aviation Museum. The Right Hand Side Stowage Comparment (RHSSC) is on the lower part of the side bulkhead on the LMP's side of the cabin and consists of four shelves into which various soft stowage bags have been secured. Various other bags are secured to the sides. Undoubtedly, Gene and Jack would have removed any items no longer needed before stowing the samples.
173:59:11|ALSJ|LMP|Ken was being very diplomatic.
174:23:25|ALSJ|LMP|I think there were storage racks on the right and left-hand sides and, if I remember correctly, they had fabric covers.
174:23:25|ALSJ|CDR|The rock boxes stacked on top of each other where my PLSS had been on the port bulkhead. They were locked in with pins.
174:23:25|ALSJ||They are doing the tasks in the right-hand column of Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf7-7.jpg"@alsjt>7-7</a>, apparently not in order. Gene is stowing the rock bags, a task near the bottom of the column and, as indicated by his next statement, Jack is stowing film magazines, a task near the top of the column.
174:28:13|ALSJ||These are the photos that Gene and Jack took of each other and the helmets.
174:31:44|ALSJ||Jack is stowing the film magazines into the LCG (Liquid Cooled Garment) Stowage Compartment which is below his right-side switch panel.

174:31:44|ALSJ||Frame AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21944"@alsjt>21944</a> is of particular interest because it - like others in the sequence taken in the same direction - shows the geology hammer. See a full @alsjurl/a17/a17.hammer.html"@alsjt>discussion</a> by Jim Scotti.
174:31:44|ALSJ||Frame @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#21960"@alsjt>21960</a> is an excellent picture that shows the thrusters and an assortment of footprints and Rover tracks.

174:45:55|ALSJ||This suggests that they can use the floor space between them for stowage, but only after they are finished using the hatch.
174:52:48|ALSJ||As mentioned at 171:39:37, they each had two pairs of EVA gloves - a fact confirmed when, at the end of the second EVA, Gene asked Bob Parker if "those gloves that you've got packed in the back have got something in them." At 171:54:54, they departed from the checklist and jettisoned two pairs of gloves rather than two pairs of boots. As suggested by the dialog from here to 174:56:09, they jettisoned the unused EVA gloves - which they must have gotten out of storage, another action not in the checklist. Gene says that they had decided to bring the boots home and, perhaps, they decided to jettison a pair of gloves instead. Each of them also has a pair of Intravehicular (IV) gloves.
174:52:48|ALSJ|CDR|I think we had two pairs of EVA gloves because that was a single point failure to the suit.
174:55:30|ALSJ||Deke Slayton rejoins the conversation.
174:56:09|ALSJ||Editor's note: The value of the worn gloves - both from an historical and an engineering point of view is inestimable. They made the right choice.
175:00:08|ALSJ||The 'Down-Voice Backup' step is not to be found in the available version of the checklist on either Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf7-7.jpg"@alsjt>7-7</a> or @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf7-8.jpg"@alsjt>7-8</a>.
175:00:50|ALSJ|LMP|We had some soft cotton towels which we could wet with the water gun.
175:16:59|ALSJ||This step is near the top of the left-hand column of Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf7-8.jpg"@alsjt>7-8</a>.
175:16:59|ALSJ|LMP|This was an antenna on the LM for receiving EVA transmissions. The ground could monitor signal strengths and just pick whichever antenna was getting the best strength - either the Rover or the LM.
183:29:59|ALSJ|LMP|(Laughing) You're being overly generous. I didn't hear any successful harmony.
183:29:59|ALSJ|CDR|Can you imagine (the scene) down in the MOCR. They're quietly sitting there watching the systems and figuring out what their going to do next and off the open carrier comes this noise.
183:33:55|ALSJ||Gene, Jack, and Ron had a total of thirteen wake-up calls during the mission. Ten times Houston picked out appropriate musical selections, albeit none of them "Hail Purdue" in honor of Gene's alma mater, Purdue University. There was no music for their first two wake-up calls in space. For the third morning, Houston picked "The Jayhawk Fight Song" in honor of Ron Evans' alma mater, Kansas University. There was no music again for the fourth morning but, for the fifth call, on the day that Gene and Jack made their landing, Houston played John Denver's version of "The City of New Orleans" which features the phrase "Good morning, America, how are you?" in the chorus. "America" is, of course, the name of the Apollo 17 Command Module. For Gene and Jack's first wake-up call on the Moon, Houston picked Wagner's "The Ride of the Valkyries", a tune regularly played on mornings of final exams at Caltech, which was Jack's undergraduate school. (Gordon Fullerton and Journal Editor Eric Jones were also Caltech undergrads.) Flight Director Gerry Griffin's alma mater, Texas A&amp;M, was honored the next morning with a rendition of "The Aggie Fight Song". Strauss' "Thus Spake Zarathustra"is associated with space because of the Stanley Kubrick/Arthur C. Clarke film "2001: A Space Odyssey".
183:33:55|ALSJ||For the rest of the mission, the selections are: Roberta Flack's rendition of "If Ever I Saw Your Face", presumably a reference to the Moon below the orbiting spacecraft; the Doors' "Come on Baby Light My Fire", to be played on the day (December 17) that the Apollo 17 crew leaves lunar orbit for the trip home; "Home for the Holidays"; The Carpenters' "We've Only Just Begun", played in the belief that the end of Apollo is not the end of humanity's lunar adventure; and, for the morning of splashdown, a dual selection of the Navy's "Anchors Away" and the U.S. national anthem, "The Star Spangled Banner.
183:33:55|ALSJ||Journal Contributor Brian Lawrence notes that "the BBC used 'Also Sprach Zarathustra' to introduce their TV coverage of all the missions.
183:34:06|ALSJ||Procedures for powering up the inertial platform and other elements of the guidance and navigation system are printed on checklist page Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf7-9.jpg"@alsjt>7-9</a>. They are supposed to perform those tasks before breakfast but, as Fullerton indicates in his next statement, Houston agrees with their decision to start with breakfast. In fact, they have a relaxed schedule for the nearly five hours that remain before launch and won't be facing any time-critical tasks until the later stages.
183:35:20|ALSJ|CDR|Here we are, after three days of exploring the lunar surface. We're coming up on an extremely critical portion of the mission - lifting off from the surface - and the conversation is so casual. It just strikes me. We've got food spilled all over; they start playing songs; we're singing to them.
183:35:20|ALSJ|LMP|I wonder if, in the journals of other explorers, there is this light-hearted overlay to what was otherwise a stressful adventure. I wonder if there's any sign of the synergistic humor that human beings have among themselves - the kind where, if you read it, it doesn't sound very humorous, but you know it's there.
183:35:20|ALSJ|CDR|This conversation is laid back; and, yet, there is business involved. We ask for the status of the Challenger and so on. But, then, when you read on, Jack's got a poem. It just strikes me that we were confident, confident that we are proceeding along on the plan. I think the mood is worth commenting on and, as I look back on it, I'm proud of it. We weren't stereotypes going bang, bang through the checklist. We woke up, we sang them a song, and we're sitting back and eating breakfast. And you've got to picture what's going on. Jack and I are in our long underwear with our suits piled up behind us - it's like four people in the little lunar module - sitting wherever we can. And they ask for the PGNS and you just reach over and get it. I wish there had been a mini-camera inside the spacecraft. It's the kind of thing you want to relate to other people. We were a quarter million miles away from home; we'd done something unique; we had something extremely significant still to do; and we had to take things in stride, one step at a time. We were feeling pretty good about it. We were ready to take our spoils back home. It might have been a case of rewarding ourselves for what we'd done.
183:35:20|ALSJ|LMP|There are photographs of Gene and me in the LM (AS17-134- @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20521"@alsjt>20521</a> and @alsjurl/a17/images17.html#20530"@alsjt>20530</a> are examples) and I think the looks on our faces tell the story. The fact that we took the time to take pictures of ourselves says a lot.
183:36:38|ALSJ||They have been using the water supply in the Descent Stage up to this point - primarily to cool the electronics - and have nearly exhausted it.
183:38:27|ALSJ|CDR|I still think it's a classic. That's what I meant (a little while ago) about the tone of the moment.
183:39:20|ALSJ||Gene thinks Jack may have made some notes and was using them as he recited his creation. Jack has a vague recollection of having used notes.
183:39:20|ALSJ|LMP|The Apollo 8 reference is that somebody in the MOCR wrote a paraphrased version of 'The Night Before Christmas' and I read it up to the crew. As a kid I had given recitations of it.
183:39:20|ALSJ||On Christmas Day 1968, about 45 minutes after Apollo 8 had a successful engine burn to put themselves on a homeward-bound trajectory, the following conversation was recorded for posterity, starting at 89:59:18.
183:39:20|ALSJ||CapCom: Jack's been watching you since LOI (Lunar Orbit Insertion), and he has a few words he wants to give you.
183:39:20|ALSJ||Borman: Go ahead.
183:39:20|ALSJ||Schmitt: Typhoid Jack here, and we have some good words here that originated at the Cape with a bunch of friends of yours. And It's sort of a paraphrase of a poem that you probably are familiar with. Do you read me, Apollo 8?
183:39:20|ALSJ||Borman: You are loud and clear, Jack.
183:39:20|ALSJ||Schmitt: Okay. "'Twas the night before Christmas and way out in space, the Apollo 8 crew had just won the Moon race. The headsets were hung by the consoles with care, in hopes that Chris Kraft soon would be there. Frank Borman was nestled all snug in his bed, while visions of REFSMMAT's danced in his head; and Jim Lovell, in his couch, and Anders, in the bay, were racking their brains over a computer display. When out of the DSKY there arose such a clatter, Frank sprang from his bed to see what was the matter. Away to the sextant he flew in a flash to make sure they weren't going to crash. The light on the breast of the Moon's jagged crust gave a luster of green cheese to the gray lunar dust. When what to his wondering eyes should appear, but a Burma Shave sign saying 'Kilroy was here.' (Laughter) But Frank was no fool; he knew pretty quick that they had been first; this must be a trick. More rapid than rockets, his curses they came. He turned to his crewmen and called them by name. Now Lovell, now Anders, now don't think I'd fall for an old joke you've written up on the wall. They spoke not a word, but grinning like elves, and laughed at their joke in spite of themselves. Frank sprang from his couch, to the ship gave a thrust, and away they all flew past the gray lunar dust. But we heard them explain ere they flew around the Moon: Merry Christmas to Earth; we will be back there real soon." Great job, gang.
183:39:20|ALSJ||Borman: Thank you very much. That was a very good poem; but in order to win the race, you have got to end up on the carriers (the recovery ship).
183:39:20|ALSJ||The cultural references in the poem are to Kilroy, "a mythical soldier of World War II whose name was inscribed in unlikely places all over the world by American soldiers" (Webster's Third International Dictionary, 1968) and to the thousands upon thousands of Burma Shave signs that kept American motorists entertained between 1927 and 1963. As detailed in Frank Rowsome's <i>Verse by the Side of the Road</i>, the Burma-Vita Company advertised its brushless shaving cream with sets of six, red-and-white signs spaced far enough apart that there were easily read by passing motorists. Each set of six carried either an advertising message or a public service message, usually in funny verse with two or three words per sign and the last sign always saying "Burma Shave". Two examples from the 1960 campaign are "We've Made Grandpa / Look So Youthful / His Pension Board / Thinks / He's Untruthful / Burma Shave," and "Henry the Eighth / Sure Had / Trouble / Short Term Wives / Long Term Stubble / Burma Shave." A combination of rising costs, increasing urbanization, the development of the Interstate Highway System, and opposition to roadside advertising killed this much loved piece of Americana.
183:39:20|David Woods|LMP|During the last week of Apollo 8 training, with which I was deeply involved, I came down with a case of intestinal flu. As a result, I immediately isolated myself from physical contact with the crew. Frank, however, initially thought that his bout of space adaptation intestinal discomfort was the consequence of being exposed to me. Thus, references to 'Typhoid Jack.' If you look at his book, I think that he later admitted that it was a result of space adaptation.
183:40:39|ALSJ|CDR|Obviously, I did not leave the LMP's camera on the Rover pointed at the zenith. But I swear I put something there. It's possible it could have been the 500 lens, because we didn't bring it back and I mentioned it was under the seat. I know that I did something with a camera. Now, it could have been a lens. And I stuck it between the seats, sort of wedged it in somewhere, and pointed the lens toward the zenith.
183:40:39|ALSJ|LMP|Houston wanted us to jettison the camera because they didn't want us to take pictures of Ron Evans' EVA. They had decided it was too cumbersome and too risky. But, we were going to ignore them, and we figured out how we could do it. But we needed a camera. Ron had a camera, but it was not EVA-qualified.
183:40:39|ALSJ|CDR|We had made up our minds we were going to take pictures of Ron.
183:40:39|ALSJ|LMP|And we needed a lunar-surface camera to do it.
183:40:39|ALSJ|CDR|Now, we did put the LMP's camera in the jett bag, so we must have had mine.
183:40:39|ALSJ||What is puzzling about Gene's and Jack's memory on this is that Gene's cuff checklist page CDR-33 contains the line "Cam to ETB", indicating that Houston expected them to have that camera on board. Another puzzle is the fact that the pictures of Ron's EVA, such as AS17-152-@alsjurl/a17/images17.html#23391"@alsjt>23391</a> were not taken with a camera equipped with reseau crosses. This suggests strongly that they used Ron's camera.
183:41:28|ALSJ||That is, if Reg B doesn't work, they'll be able to use Reg A for repressurization following the final hatch opening.
183:46:39|ALSJ|LMP|Our rest period was normally eight hours, and we were usually a little late getting started.
183:46:39|ALSJ|CDR|We'd sit around and talk and Jack'd stick his finger in the rock bag.
183:47:05|ALSJ|LMP|The wet packs were the original form of the Army's irradiated Meal-Ready-To-Eat.
183:47:05|ALSJ|CDR|They were cold, not warm.
183:47:05|ALSJ|LMP|We had four kinds, as I recall: peanut butter, a hamburger, wieners...
183:47:05|ALSJ|CDR|Ham in a kind of gravy, and roast beef.
183:47:05|ALSJ|LMP|Maybe there were five, then. And there was a fruit cake, too. And it was really pretty good. They were our best meals.
183:47:05|ALSJ|CDR|It was a good change from eating all the rehydrated food.
183:48:02|ALSJ||They've already had breakfast, a bit out of sequence, and will now power-up the inertial platform and other elements of the navigation system. During this LM Comm Break, Houston has AOS with Evans, who is on his 49th orbit.
183:58:23|ALSJ||They are about 54 minutes behind schedule and will catch up easily.
184:11:11|ALSJ||They are getting state vector information from Houston.
184:15:01|ALSJ|LMP|RLS was probably the REFSMMAT Landing Site.
184:15:01|ALSJ|CDR|I haven't heard that word for years. It was the coordinates of the landing site so that we would know where we were lifting off from.
184:17:49|ALSJ||Very Long Because of slight deviations of the CSM orbit from the planned path, lift-off will be 1 minute, 10 seconds early. Evans has done a power-up test of the CSM vacuum cleaner in preparation for the arrival of the surface crew. Next, Gene and Jack will perform a check of the platform alignment using gravity and a sighting on the bright star Vega.
184:35:47|ALSJ||They have just done a gravity alignment and, as per instruction, will now skip the stellar alignment and prepare to don their suits.
184:40:34|ALSJ|CDR|We had some strap-on thigh pockets. I think we called them our 'checklist pockets' because we could slip our checklists in them. (Chuckling) And you know, we were ahead of the ground on a lot of things.
184:40:34|ALSJ|LMP|But it's nice to have them thinking for you.
184:40:59|ALSJ|CDR|We needed to take a leak (urinate) before we donned the suits.
184:40:59|ALSJ||Very Long Comm Break as they get out of the Constant Wear Garments and into the LCGs. Because of the low residue diet, neither of them had to defecate while they were on the Moon.
184:58:57|ALSJ||Very Long Comm Break while they get Jack into his suit. Houston is estimating that the descent water supply will run out at 186:40 plus or minus one hour. Gene and Jack will switch to ascent water, if necessary, prior to lift-off. In fact, they will make the switch to ascent water at the normal time of 187:43.
185:18:42|ALSJ||Very Long Comm Break while they get Gene suited. Once they get done, they will report their <a href="../ApolloPRD.jpg"@alsjt>PRD</a> (Personal Radiation Dosimeter) readings. This activity is near the top of the right-hand column of Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf7-1.jpg"@alsjt>7-12</a> and was scheduled for 184:59. They are now only about 32 minutes behind schedule.
185:32:32|ALSJ||Long Comm Break as they get all of the gear they will need for the jettison within reach and everything else out of the way. Their next call was scheduled for 185:07. They are still just a bit over a half hour behind schedule.
185:46:17|ALSJ||They switch to voice-activated comm and we pick them up in the middle of a conversation.
185:47:52|ALSJ|LMP|I think the original LM data recorder was to record engineering data that they didn't put on the telemetry. And then, for having screwed that up (by not turning the recorder off before going outside for EVA-3), I said I owed Don something. He sort of honchoed the third or fourth tier of industrial people that were watching over the missions. And it would be the kind of data they were interested in.
185:50:05|ALSJ||At this point in the review, we realized that Gene's grease is hand cream, not lubricant for the wrist rings.
185:50:05|ALSJ|LMP|Gene decided he liked that better, and I decided I liked the nylon liners. Neither one of them kept us from getting abraded and bruised.
185:51:19|ALSJ||The following transmissions were not available on the PAO tape I used to insert times into the raw NASA transcript. On that tape, the transmission are covered by the NASA Public Affairs commentator.
185:51:19|ALSJ||They will now begin the Pressure Integrity Check, which is on Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf7-13.jpg"@alsjt>7-13</a>. They have actually lost a little time in getting the gloves on and are 38 minutes behind schedule.
185:51:52|ALSJ||For the jettison operation, they will pressurize the suits by setting pressure Regulator B in the Direct O2 mode. In Direct O2, they added oxygen at a slow, but unregulated, rate. The five minute limit may have to do with Houston's ability to detect out-of-range leaks in this @alsjurl/alsj-LM-ECS.html"@alsjt>ECS</a> configuration.
185:55:23|ALSJ||The steps for the VHF comm check are in the box at the lower left on Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf7-15.jpg"@alsjt>7-15</a>.
185:56:00|ALSJ||Evans will do doppler ranging using the voice carrier.
185:59:23|ALSJ||This is Evans' last pass over the landing site prior to lift-off. @alsjurl/tnD6082_LandmarkTrackingAp8-10-11-12_1971002567.pdf"@alsjt>landmark tracking</a> will allow Houston to check the CSM orbit.
186:00:17|ALSJ||They go back to Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf7-13.jpg"@alsjt>7-13</a>, to the top of the right-hand column.
186:01:42|ALSJ||They are on page @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf7-13.jpg"@alsjt>7-13</a> of the Surface Checklist. The instruction to switch to Water Separator 2 is a late addition.
186:04:00|ALSJ||EVA-4 was the PLSS jettison prior to the last rest period.
186:04:02|ALSJ|CDR|You get the pressure in the cabin low enough that you can get the hatch open; but there's still a tremendous force on it and I had to hold it open to get it all the way down.
186:04:57|ALSJ||They are still on Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf7-13.jpg"@alsjt>7-13</a>.
186:05:24|ALSJ|LMP|There were all kinds of nooks and crannies in the LM, now. Not just the ordinary nooks and crannies, but we had bags that had gotten pressurized and, so, everything was venting. It didn't happen instantaneously. I don't remember thinking about that at the time, but that's probably what it was. There were just lots of sources of oxygen.
186:05:52|ALSJ|CDR|A lot of things we would just set down in front of the hatch and - pop - just kick them out. It was easy enough to do that. Kick them far enough to clear the porch.
186:06:22|ALSJ||We have no idea what is going on here. One possibility is that Gene has started to turn around, pretending that he is going to get out for an EVA or to get the clean gloves.
186:06:50|ALSJ||They now turn to Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf7-14.jpg"@alsjt>7-14</a>.
186:09:14|ALSJ||Public Affairs reports a 60 second EVA from hatch open to hatch close. By the normal definition of 3.5 psi to 3.5 psi, this was a six-minute EVA.
186:10:02|ALSJ||After doffing the helmets and gloves, they will stow the @alsjurl/alsj-LEVA.html"@alsjt>LEVAs</a> and EVA gloves and, in general, get things out of the way in preparation for launch.
186:14:00|ALSJ|CDR|We had some indentations in the floor to hook (the @alsjurl/restraints.jpg"@alsjt>tethers</a>) onto, so there must have been some adapter we had to put in.
186:18:53|ALSJ||As can be seen in the accompanying diagrams, the <a href="../LMRHSCutAway.jpg"@alsjt>plus Z-27 bulkhead</a> separates the front the cabin from the back, and is just forward of the ascent engine cover. The plus Z-27 bulkhead is also the front face of what is called the <a href="../alsj-LM-Midstep.html"@alsjt>midstep</a>.
186:19:45|ALSJ||Very Long After tidying up the cabin, they will copy data for the ascent, as per the last three lines on Surface @alsjurl/a17/a17LMLunarSurf7-15.jpg"@alsjt>7-15</a>. Fullerton gave them updates to the checklist concerning this and other sections at 183:42:26.
186:49:16|ALSJ|LMP|These were all contingency PADs and there was only a limited amount of information that could be stored in the computer.
186:50:15|ALSJ||The circuit breaker configuration is shown of Surface 8-2. Gene has probably verified the switches listed on 8-1.
186:52:01|ALSJ||During this break, Houston has LOS with Evans on his 50th orbit. Gene finishes his circuit breaker check on Surface 8-2 and Jack does his on Surface 8-3.
186:54:38|ALSJ||They have just finished a check of their circuit breaker configuration. And are about to perform a radar "self" test.
186:56:19|ALSJ||Jack is at the top of the right-hand column of Surface 8-4.
186:59:44|ALSJ||Note that this site handover comes about an hour before launch, rather than at launch as Jack suggested in his comment at 121:30:03. See the discussion at 188:01:39.
187:06:30|ALSJ||This step is at the bottom of the right-hand column of 8-4.
187:08:05|ALSJ||They have now finished the items on Surface 8-5.
187:09:49|ALSJ||This will be a "hot" test firing of the Reaction Control System, the small steering rockets on the LM.
187:12:01|ALSJ||The test using PGNS, which comes up next, is near the bottom of Surface 8-6.
187:13:52|ALSJ||Jack has now configured the computer to accept uplinked data from Houston. They are on 8-7, just above the line of asterisks.
187:16:31|ALSJ||Next, they will recheck the platform alignment as per the procedures on 8-7 and 8-8.
187:21:27|ALSJ||This is a gravity check of the platform alignment, as indicted at the top of Surface 8-8.
187:21:27|ALSJ||TV on. @alsjurl/Fendell-Bio.pdf"@alsjt>Fendell</a> plays with tracking he will use to follow the launch.
187:28:59|ALSJ||They have just done an alignment check using the bright star Vega. Gene's next transmission indicates that they are on Surface 8-9.
187:33:56|ALSJ||Next they will perform a check of switch positions, as detailed on Surface 8-10 and 8-11.
187:37:03|ALSJ||Evans is just re-emerging from his lunar farside pass. A single comm channel will be used for both spacecraft through launch.
187:40:05|ALSJ||Gene and Jack are now at the top of 8-12.
187:40:05|ALSJ|LMP|The AGS used what they called strapdown gyros. It integrated accelerations from those gyros to give three-axis velocities. It carried its own state vector, but much less precisely.
187:43:02|ALSJ|CDR|I think he pumped the cabin up because he had to use oxygen out of the Command Module to pressurize the tunnel, so he wanted to build up the pressure so that he could vent it into the tunnel once we were docked.
187:43:07|ALSJ||This is the normal switch-over time. Jack's call indicates that they now have their helmets and gloves on.
187:44:29|ALSJ||They have reached the bottom of Surface 8-12.
187:48:43|ALSJ||As Gene's next transmission indicates, they have finished the tasks on Surface 8-13 and have performed the pre-launch circuit breaker reconfigurations on Surface 8-14 and 8-15.
187:49:52|ALSJ||Jack is not on VOX, so we only hear Gene's half of the following conversation.
187:51:05|ALSJ||In the following procedures, they are firing small <a href="../tnD7141ApPyrotchnc.html"@alsjt>explosive charges</a> which open the valves on the helium tanks which, then, provide pressure to the propellant tanks. Readers may want to note the Emergency Launch procedures listed in the box at the right side of Surface 8-16. If the crew had found a leak in the either of the tanks in the Ascent Stage, they could have launched almost immediately to take advantage of as much of the propellant as possible.
187:51:13|ALSJ||That is, they could feel the vibrations caused by detonation of the charge.
187:52:22|ALSJ|LMP|On our gauges, the pressures for the two tanks were different, and they should have been the same. Down below (187:54:07), Gordo will tell us that they think there's a transducer problem.
187:52:24|ALSJ||For the first part of the ascent, they will use Ascent Fuel for the RCS (Reaction Control System, the small steering jets) and save the RCS Fuel supply for final maneuvers - hence the closure of the shut-off valves. See Gene's comment at 187:56:26.
187:52:51|ALSJ||They are now at the bottom of Surface 8-16 and are waiting for permission to launch. Details of the launch are given in the LM Timeline Book, which is not reproduced here. See Surface 8-17.
187:54:24|ALSJ||This card contains the final checklist items.
187:56:26|ALSJ|CDR|We had two sources of propellant for the RCS systems. One was their own tanks and, for the other, we could crossfeed and utilize ascent propellant. We did that during the ascent phase to save the RCS fuel for rendezvous. We had a margin in the ascent tanks to cover that.
187:57:51|ALSJ|CDR|In listening to this, it's obvious that we were pretty confident. I know how prepared we were and I'm still impressed. I'd have to go back and study and learn this all over again. It sounds to me like we knew exactly what we were going to do in the event of a no-light. You get to a point where you hope it never happens but you almost dare something to fail. Because you know that, if it does, you're prepared to handle it. I don't specifically remember why I was going to wipe out the thrusters (by rotating the control through all thruster positions), but I think we had to reinitialize something - maybe zero the AGS.
187:58:22|ALSJ||They are hearing the Command Module. Because Evans is in a 60 mile orbit, he 'rises' over the LM horizon about 6 minutes prior to passing overhead. They will launch prior to his overhead pass.
187:59:44|ALSJ||These lights indicate that the <a href="../tnD7141ApPyrotchnc.html"@alsjt>explosive bolts</a> which they will fire to separate the Ascent Stage from the Descent Stage are ready to fire.
188:01:20|ALSJ|CDR|This was a routine in the PGNS to start recording data from the accelerometers.
188:01:29|ALSJ||The accompanying @alsjurl/a17/a17v.launch.mov"@alsjt> video clip of the Apollo 17 LM launch</a> (1.8 Mb) starts 3 seconds before ignition and then follows the LM for the first 13 seconds of the ascent.
188:01:39|ALSJ|LMP|As I recall, at the moment of ignition, all we had was static - loud static. And I was looking to see what happened, to see if I'd lost lock.
188:01:39|ALSJ|CDR|Jack spent half of the lift-off trying to get comm back.
188:01:39|ALSJ|LMP|And I remember somebody telling me that what had happened was that they had a site handover scheduled right at lift-off! And nobody caught it.
188:01:39|ALSJ||Jack's memory is not quite accurate, although the problem was, in part, due to procedures on the ground. The following has been extracted from the Apollo 17 Mission 5-Day Report: "On lunar module ascent, two-way lock with the lunar module transponder was lost. This resulted in a 4-minute loss of uplink voice, and tracking data during ascent. It was necessary to have the Command Module Pilot pass comments from the ground to the lunar module crew during this period. The initial loss of lock was attributed to attenuation by the lunar module (engine) plume. Communications should have been re-established in less time (than 4 minutes). A review of data indicates that a normal re-acquisition by Goldstone should have been attempted earlier. Approximately 4 minutes after lunar module lift-off, a normal re-acquisition was accomplished.
188:01:39|ALSJ||According to Apollo 7 astronaut Walter Cunningham in his 1977 book "The All-American Boys" (p 241) and, more importantly, according to Gene in his 1999 book "Last Man on the Moon" (p338), Gene's last words on the Moon were "Let's get this mother out of here." During the mission review in Santa Fe, Gene was surprised not to hear those words but what seems likely is that what he was remembering was his "Now, let's get off." at 188:01:25; and that, in later tellings, the wording changed to the more colorful version. I have discussed this matter with Andrew Chaikin, another aficionado of the audio tapes, and we agree on the interpretation given here. My thanks to William Bianco for reminding me about this issue and to Hamish Lindsay for pointing me to the telling in Gene's book.
188:01:51|ALSJ||After launch, Fendell successfully tracks the LM for 26 seconds. He finds it again, very briefly, at 45 seconds and, a minute later, points the TV back at the Descent Stage. The flag is still standing, as is the SEP pallet Gene had leaned against the north landing strut. Note that the flag is pointing north. As can be seen in Jack's post-EVA-3 photo AS17-143-<a href="images17.html#21948"@alsjt>21948</a>, the flag was pointing east. Clearly, what has happened is that the ascent engine exhaust exerted sufficient force on the flag so that, like a weathervane, it swung around to point directly away from the source of the 'wind'.
188:01:51|ALSJ||Robin Wheeler has provided the portion of the <a href="A17_Asc.jpg"@alsjt>ascent map</a> showing the LM ground track for the first five minutes.
188:02:38|ALSJ||These are pointing angles for the high-gain antenna.
188:03:42|ALSJ|CDR|We had a table of altitude, attitude, and rate of climb. That was a manual backup that told us if we were on our trajectory or not - and a manual backup to tell us that the PGNS was doing what it was supposed to.
188:05:28|ALSJ||This is an @alsjurl/tnD7990LM_AGS.html"@alsjt>AGS</a> update in case the PGNS fails and they have to use it.
188:06:21|ALSJ|CDR|As I remember, the time to get fuel out of the ascent tanks (for the RCS) was when we had a g-force because, once we were in zero-g, we could not have gotten any even if there was some left. Now they've decided that we've taken enough of the ascent fuel for the RCS. They don't want to get the ascent fuel any lower because they want it for the ascent engine, itself. So, the RCS is now going on it's own tanks - which are full at this point, and that's important. Well, they're not full, because we didn't cross feed on the descent.
188:06:55|ALSJ||I asked Gene and Jack if, like Conrad and Bean, they experienced a significant amount of LM 'wobble' RCS firing during the trip up from the surface. Neither remembered anything notable.
188:07:07|ALSJ||They are gaining altitude at the rate of 126 feet per second.
188:08:49|ALSJ|CDR|As I remember, my intent was to let the PGNS shut it down and, if it didn't within a second afterwards, I was going to. I think I shut it down anyway. I wasn't going to let it send us into orbit around the Sun. But I was less concerned about the shutdown than the start. I was told that, at lift-off, I beat the PGNS start by some micro-cosmo of a second.
188:09:25|ALSJ||That is, Gene is positioning the LM for a slight correction burn (or, "tweak"), using the RCS.
188:09:44|ALSJ||This is the low point of the orbit they have just entered.
188:17:15|ALSJ||The Ascent burn lasted about 7 minutes and 18 seconds and it put the Challenger crew into an elliptical orbit with a low point of 9 nautical miles above the Moon and a high point of 50. It was a nearly perfect burn. At 12 minutes 12 seconds after launch, Gene did series of RCS (Reaction Control System) firings - called "tweak burns" - to fine tune the orbit. Compared with their 5500 foot-per-second (fps) orbital speed, the velocity change that Gene wanted - 4 fps aft (down through the ascent engine bell), 1 fps out the plus-Z axis (out the windows), and 9 fps left (toward Gene's side of the spacecraft) - was trivial in the extreme. However, they wouldn't rendezvous with Ron for another hour and a half - not until they'd gone around the backside of the Moon and were in radio contact with Earth again - and a net speed change of 10 feet per second meant the difference between a perfect rendezvous and a miss of several kilometers. Better to do the tweak now, with a small engine burn, rather than later with a bigger one.
188:19:31|ALSJ||Because the required velocity change was so small, Gene actually did three separate RCS firings - one for each of the three spacecraft axes. With Jack watching the AGS (Abort Guidance Computer), Gene fired the thrusters associated with the x-axis - which ran up through the Ascent Engine bell to the overhead hatch - until the AGS told them that they had made the desired 1 fps velocity change. Then he did the z-axis change - the z-axis runs from the rear of the cabin forward toward the hatch - and, finally, the y-axis (left/right) change. By the time they were done, they were 125 miles behind and below the Command-and-Service Module (CSM).
188:20:44|ALSJ||The LM crew was flying in an orientation such that, when they got close enough, they would have a clear view of their sister ship. About 18 minutes after the launch, Gene got his first visual sighting of the CSM. He and Jack had just passed through the sunrise terminator into darkness and, although Ron was still out in front of them, he was high enough that he was still in sunlight. Moments later, Ron also passed into darkness and, once his eyes adjusted to the lower light levels, he spotted the tracking light on Challenger.
188:50:44|ALSJ||The two spacecraft were now about 112 miles apart, engines quiet and following paths which, through the magic of orbital mechanics, would soon bring them together. Fifty minutes after launch, Challenger and America disappeared behind the Moon and, by the time they reappeared, forty-five minutes later, they were only 0.8 miles apart and were closing at a stately 30 fps. Gene and Jack had their backs to the Moon and were looking almost straight up at Ron in the CSM. Ron, too, had a good view. His TV camera was mounted in one of the CSM windows so that Houston and the rest of the world could watch Challenger as it seemingly rose up from the lunar surface. Gradually, Gene slowed his approach and, at a separation of only 100 feet, he stopped. Then Ron did a slow rotation of the CSM so that the LM crews could do a visual examination of the ship that would take them all home.
190:01:41|ALSJ||As the two ships passed over the landing site for the first time since lift-off, Gene and Ron maneuvered into docking attitude and then, ever so slowly, Gene inched closer. There was no need to hurry. They were going to spend the next two days in lunar orbit, gathering more data and adding to the wealth of visual observations that Ron had already provided. Fifteen minutes after they started to maneuver, the two spacecraft were docked and, in a few minutes more, they were sure that all the latches were secure. They had a hard dock and could open the hatches, clear the connecting tunnel and begin to transfer the precious lunar samples.
190:22:19|ALSJ||After the message from the President, Gene made a gracious statement of thanks and then Jack and Ron added brief thanks of their own. But, inside, Jack was steaming. Apollo was ending, but there were still 27 years left in the century and he hated the thought of an American President telling a whole generation that they would have no chance to do their own lunar exploration. But there was nothing Jack could do but suppress his anger and, in the meantime, there was some more exploration that he and the others could do before they headed home.
190:41:30|ALSJ||Once the hatches were open and the tunnel was cleared, Ron passed over the vacuum cleaner and Gene and Jack got busy with the worst of the dust. LOS (Loss-of-signal) came about forty minutes after the docking and, by the time Apollo 17 re-emerged three quarters of an hour later, Gene and Jack were handing sample containers over to Ron. With his own interests in mind, Ron also made sure that they had all the helmets and gloves and other gear that they would need for his EVA. Once they had left lunar orbit and were on their way home, Ron was going to go outside, secured with a tether, to retrieve film canisters from the SIM (Scientific Instrument Module) Bay. The EVA promised to be the highlight of the mission for Ron and he didn't want to lose out on his chance by leaving a helmet or a glove behind in the LM.
192:01:26|ALSJ||The rocks and the helmets and gloves were all safely aboard America and, indeed, the Command Module was so full of rocks and astronauts that the only way they were going to get a little elbow room was to get rid of a jettison bag that Ron had been filling for the last three days. Consequently, just before they closed the LM hatch for the last time, the astronauts tossed the bulging jett bag into the now empty cabin of the LM. Challenger had one last mission to accomplish. She was headed back down to the Moon for a planned impact on the eastern flank of the South Massif, a final sacrifice to the gods of seismology; and, as Challenger made her last trip down to the lunar surface. She also had the unglamorous - but necessary - job of carrying the trash.
193:58:03|ALSJ||Because of the precision that was hoped for Challenger's impact, the jettison operation was carefully choreographed. The crew got their suits on and did a pressure check. Then they pressurized the connecting tunnel and, at about 194 hours into the mission, released the latches so that the pressure in the tunnel could gently push the two spacecraft apart. For another half hour, the flight controllers made sure that they could control the LM attitude; and then, at the proper moment, at 195 hours 38 minutes into the mission, they did a long firing of the LM's RCS thrusters. At launch from Earth, the LM was carrying 630 lbs of RCS propellant and, because things had gone so smoothly throughout the flight, there were still 450 pound left when the LM was released for it's final descent. During the long, 1 minute 56 second burn, another 270 pounds of propellants was expended, enough to trim 213 feet per second off the orbital speed of the 5277 pound Ascent Stage and send it toward impact with the South Massif.
195:52:44|ALSJ||Because there were only 40 hours left before the crew was scheduled to leave lunar orbit, the instrumentation in the SIM Bay were still busily gathering data. There wasn't going to be another opportunity to gather close-up lunar data for a long time and a visual observation of the LM impact was of lesser importance than proper orientation of the Command Module for data gathering. Consequently, the crew was looking back along their ground track at the moment of impact and, because the LM was flying in a lower orbit, they were not yet over the landing site when it hit.
195:52:44|ALSJ||Down on the lunar surface, the TV camera on the Rover was still in good working order and, as the moment of impact approached, Ed Fendell pointed it at the planned impact point high on the eastern slope. But there was a question. Because there was only a limited amount of tracking data that could be acquired in the 17 minutes between the end of the deorbit burn and the impact, predictions of the impact point were uncertain by about 10 to 15 kilometers. Fendell could look at most of the error ellipse if he pulled back on his zoom; but, with a wide field, he would have limited resolution, which would lower his chances of seeing anything. For several minutes, he played with the zoom and adjusted his pointing. However, in the end, he went to maximum zoom and aimed at the planned point and hoped for the best. Given the relatively poor resolution of the camera - even at maximum zoom - there wasn't much chance of success and, even though the LM did hit the mountain within a mile of the planned spot, nothing was seen by the eager audience in Houston. The seismometers that Jack had deployed at the ALSEP site recorded the impact, but there was nothing to be seen on the TV.
195:52:44|ALSJ||The LM impacted with a speed of about 1.5 km/s and with a mass of 2400 kilograms. The impact energy was, therefore, 2.7e16 ergs. From a paper by V.R. Overbeck, we can estimate that the total displaced mass was about 6.7e8 grams. Then, if the mean density of the target material was 2.0 g/cc and the crater was conical in shape with a depth one-fourth its diameter, the crater diameter was about 17 meters.
207:37:10|ALSJ||On their final full day in lunar orbit, the crew of Apollo 17 was going to spend most of their time doing out-the-window geology and the wake-up music was Roberta Flack's "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face." During the day, Jack, the professional geologist, and Ron, the seasoned lunar observer did most of the talking.
213:43:23|ALSJ||Because of the discovery of orange soil at Shorty Crater at the landing site, they spent a lot of time looking for color at various places where they and the geologists in the Backroom thought that they might find other pyroclastic deposits. As they passed over the landing site, Ron noted that the orange coloration at Shorty was no longer visible but, a bit further west, in the Solpicius Gallus area in southwestern Mare Serenitatis, both he and Jack described numerous features that not only showed prominent orange, but also reds and reddish browns. Eventually, Jack saw enough that he was ready of offer an explanation of the colored layers.
212:34:45|ALSJ||For most of the day, the astronauts described what they were seeing out the window. The large, mare-filled, Farside crater Tsiolkovsky was of particular interest and so, too, was Mare Symthii near the eastern rim. Jack, of course, tended to talk in terms of comparisons between the various features he was seeing and, at one point provided a lengthy discussion of the so-called "wrinkle-ridge" systems which bound the various mare. Jack was truly in a geologist's paradise and, at one point, Fullerton jokingly told the crew that a requested change in the comm configuration was being done "so that the secretaries that are transcribing the air-to-ground can catch up with Jack."
220:01:10|ALSJ||Former President Harry S Truman - who had been in the crew's thoughts throughout the mission - was still in serious condition. He died the day after Christmas.
236:58:05|ALSJ||The TEI (Trans Earth Injection) burn was done over the Farside about eight hours after wake-up. During their final hours in lunar orbit, all three of the astronauts passed along miscellaneous geology observations, but the burn was the main event and, when they emerged from behind the Moon for the last time, Gene was able to report a nearly perfect, 1/2 g burn.
236:58:05|ALSJ||America climbed rapidly away from the Moon and, indeed, the increased altitude meant that AOS came more than 13 minutes early than it would have without the burn. The climb out from the Moon also gave the crew some new perspectives and they shared the view with Houston, especially a spectacular TV tour of the crater Tsiolkovsky. By the time the landing site came into view, they were 2000 miles out and they were beginning to lose detail.
250:53:16|ALSJ||During the stop at Van Serg toward the end of the third EVA, Gene and Jack had been surprised and puzzled that this fairly sizable impact out in the middle of the valley was not the basaltic rocks that they had come to expect but, rather, some very fragile rocks that looked to be breccias - rocks made up of fragments of other rocks fused together by an impact. On the drive back to the LM, Jack had speculated that Van Serg had, by chance, hit a "window" in the basalt and had dug up underlying breccias but, he remembers not being very happy with the hypothesis. Because Van Serg is only a few tens of meters deep, the "window" hypothesis would require that, elsewhere in the valley where they did see basaltic rocks, the basaltic layer not be very thick. Consequently, Jack's thinking during the night may have been influenced by the report from Fullerton that the Traverse Gravimeter was indicating that the basaltic valley fill was three or four kilometers thick and, therefore, the Van Serg breccias had to be made from something that was lying on top of the basalt at that location. Perhaps they were actually clods of soil which had been highly compressed - turned into a fragile "instant" rock - in the impact. And, indeed, when the Van Serg breccias were examined back in Houston, they proved to be soil breccias - larger, more competent versions of the instant rock that Gene and Jack saw at the rims of smaller craters at several places in the valley.
253:59:12|ALSJ||They put all the miscellaneous trash they'd accumulated since saying goodbye to Challenger and removed the center couch so that they'd have room for Ron to get out and for Jack to stand in the hatch and take pictures. (The jettison bag would drift off only slowly as they continued their journey and, once it hit the top of the atmosphere, would quickly burn up.)
257:33:59|ALSJ||Gene advised Ron to be sure that, once he had made his way back to the SIM Bay, he got his feet firmly planted in the footholds before he did anything else. During Gene's "spacewalk", which was only the third which had ever been done and the first in which an astronaut attempted to do real work outside the spacecraft, Gene was hindered by a lack of hand and footholds. When he tried to use a wrench to turn a bolt, it was he who tended to turn and, coupled with the inadequate cooling capability of the Gemini suit, he had a very frustrating and tiring time of it. For later Gemini EVAs, hand and footholds were added to the outside of the spacecraft and, back at the Apollo 17 SIM Bay, there was a pair of good footholds for Ron to use.
279:41:40|ALSJ||The ALFMED experiment was repeated on the trip back from the Moon, this time with all three of them wearing blindfolds. On that occasion, none of them reported any flashes. Readers may want to note, however, that the surgeon reported that the LMP seemed to be asleep during much of the homeward-bound experiment. ("My heart rate was very low anyway.")
301:17:18|ALSJ||Three hours before splashdown, Gene gave America a nudge of 2.1 feet per second to fine tune his trajectory. Considering how far and how long they had traveled since the TEI burn, this minuscule burn was a testament to the men and women who and designed, built, and flown the Apollo spacecraft.
304:31:50|ALSJ||America landed in the Pacific, 1.3 miles from its target. Crammed into the spacecraft with the crew were more samples and more frames of exposed film than any other crew had brought back to Earth and, although the splashdown marked the end of Apollo, it was a grand and fitting finale.
