004:59:37|ALSJ|summary|While they waited for the S-IVB burn, Cernan reported that, while he knew "we're not the first to discover this, but we'd like to confirm, from the crew of Apollo 17, that the world is round." In the two hours since the TLI burn, they had moved out far enough - about 16,600 miles - that they could see the whole Earth. Because of the Moon's position in its orbit, they were south of the terrestrial equator, over the southern tip of Africa, and had no trouble seeing Antarctica. The Earth was nearly full and, at 30,000 miles, they took a stunning portrait of the planet.
005:52:25|ALSJ|summary|Throughout the outbound journey, they had a good view back toward Earth. Schmitt, in particular, provided lengthy and detailed weather reports, complete with predictions. His first report, given while Cernan and Evans were getting out of their suits, went on for a full half hour and, as the Earth turned beneath them, he could update his predictions for various parts of the world. Later in the mission, CapCom Gordo Fullerton told him, "You're a regular human weather satellite."
009:00:00|ALSJ|summary|Nine hours into the mission, they were ready to sleep. Cernan wore a headset in case Houston needed to talk; and he also wore biomedical sensors so that the flight surgeon could watch his heart rate and other vital signs. On this first night, none of them got more than about three hours of sound sleep but, for the next few days, the work load would be relatively light and there would be plenty of time to get adequate rest.
015:02:45|ALSJ|summary|On the morning of this second day, Houston was ready to discuss a reset of the mission clocks so that when they got to lunar orbit at the pre-planned time, the clock time would agree with the times printed in the flight plan. In essence, they needed to add two hours and forty minutes to the actual elapsed time and Houston was looking for a spot in the flight plan where the reset could be done without significant disruption. Their first thought was to do the whole correction at 65 hours. However, the choice would shorten that work day from 16 hours to 13 1/3 hours and, after some thought, Houston decided that it would be best to modify the schedule in two stages and avoid any more disruption of the sleep/wake cycle than was already necessary. Between 46 and 65 hours after the actual launch, they would move all activities up one hour. That is, they would do the activities scheduled at 52 hours at 51 hours of elapsed time. Then, at 65 hours they would set the clocks forward to 67:40. It was a bit confusing, even to the crew, but it avoided two clock changes and, because there were to be relatively few things going on between 46 and 65 hours, there would be only a few pencil changes in the flight plan.
021:28:24|ALSJ|summary|About six hours after their first wake-up in space, Schmitt got down under one of the couches and, by holding onto one of the struts, was able to get some exercise by running in place on the bulkhead of what was called the Lower Equipment Bay. Before starting, his heart rate had been about 60 beats per minute and, much to the surgeon's pleasure, he was able to get his rate up to about 140. What is more, the engineers reported that he shook the spacecraft hard enough to stir the liquid oxygen in the Service Module tanks. Each of the tanks contained a fan and, when the fan wasn't running, heat losses at the walls created temperature gradients in the tank, a circumstance that the engineers wanted to avoid. By exercising, Schmitt had saved them the trouble of turning on the fan, thereby saving a little spacecraft power.
025:26:26|ALSJ|summary|The second day was purposefully short. The landing was scheduled for about 2:30 p.m., Florida time, and the crew was then going to do a full EVA before getting to bed. They wanted to wake up on landing day at about 7:30 a.m., Florida time, and it had been decided that, after the disruption of their sleep cycle caused by the night launch, it would be best to get back to a morning wake-up as early in the flight as possible. After launching, they hadn't gotten to sleep until it was about dawn at the Cape, and then their first wake-up came at about 3:30 in the afternoon. However, by having only a ten-hour second day, they were asleep by 1:30 a.m. Florida time and could wake up at 9:30 a.m. with most of the adjustment already made and with three more sleep periods to go before landing day. With the help of a Seconal sleeping tablet, each of them got 7 1/2 hours of sound sleep on their second night in space and awoke feeling well rested and ready to go.
034:10:19|ALSJ|summary|By now, they were a bit over half way to the Moon, about 125,000 miles out from Earth and the spacecraft was working beautifully. They had been consuming maneuvering fuel, water, oxygen, and electric power at very close to the predicted rates; and they were being conscientious about eating and drinking enough to keep the surgeon happy. After Schmitt reported on the weather for southern Africa and Argentina, Fullerton read a news summary that included items such as the ongoing negotiations in Paris between the United States and North Vietnam, the medical condition of former President Harry Truman, and the start of the Texas state high school football playoffs.
035:30:00|ALSJ|summary|The first big event of the day was a midcourse trajectory correction which came about two hours after wake up, an exceedingly modest two-second burn of the Service Module Engine.
042:59:32|ALSJ|summary|The crew ran a small, self-contained, heat-flow-and-convection experiment which proved to be so fascinating that Houston had to remind them to take care of some other items in the checklist. Schmitt thought that it was the best Saturday afternoon matinee he'd seen in a long time and wished that they'd had some popcorn.
056:35:40|ALSJ|summary|For this third rest period, Houston gave the crew of Apollo 17 a full eight hours and, for the first time in the mission, Fullerton had to wake the crew out of a sound sleep. As a wake-up call, he used the stirring strains of the Jayhawk Fight Song, in honor of Ron Evans' alma mater, the University of Kansas. It was going to be another quiet day and Schmitt thought their only problem was going to be keeping Evans from going back to sleep.
059:57:53|ALSJ|summary|Schmitt got back in the LM and powered it up for about a half hour so that Houston could take a look at the telemetry system. He made another brief check of the comm system and, as Houston had expected after thinking about things overnight, the previous day's problems were confirmed as being problems on the ground, rather than in the spacecraft.
063:10:15|ALSJ|summary|While they got ready for lunch, Cernan took a look back at Earth, conscious that this would be the last trip anyone would make out this far for some time to come. He told Houston "You can look right down at the Cape area - that's the Cape that we know, in Florida - and it's a little disheartening because the last time I was up here (on Apollo 10) looking back from this angle, they were moving another Saturn V for another Moon trip out on the pad already."
063:49:46|ALSJ|summary|The preparations for lunch took a bit longer than usual and the reason was that Evans couldn't find his scissors. The food, much of it dehydrated, was sealed in tough plastic bags. Each of them carried a pair of good quality surgical scissors so that they could cut the bags and get at the food. Without his scissors, Evans would get mighty hungry and his one hope, short of finding his own, was that Cernan or Schmitt would lend him a pair while they were down on the surface. After some joking about his predicament, they agreed to leave a pair behind.
065:00:00|ALSJ|summary|After lunch, it was time to reset the clocks. Fullerton read them an explanation written for the press by the Public Affairs Office and, if possible, it was worse than what I wrote for this summary. Certainly Fullerton and the crew had a good chuckle over it. The important point was that, after lunch, they were 65 hours into the mission but had completed all the planned activities up to 67:40. Now, they could change the clocks and, from then on, behave as though they had launched on time.
068:07:51|ALSJ|summary|ALFMED (Apollo Light Flash Moving Emulsion Detector). On early missions, various astronauts had reported that, with their eyes closed, they sometimes saw brief streaks of light. The most reasonable explanation is that their retinas were being triggered by cosmic rays and, to test the hypothesis, Evans donned a helmet that covered his eyes and also contained slowly-moving plates of photographic film that would record any cosmic rays entering his head. He wore the detector for an hour and reported all of the flashes that he saw. These were later compared with the film record. As a control, Cernan wore a blindfold and also reported any light flashes he saw. It took Evans and Cernan about fifteen minutes to get sufficiently dark adapted that they began seeing flashes. Thereafter, they reported events about once every 2 1/2 minutes.
081:31:00|ALSJ|summary|Cernan was the first up on Day 5. Houston had decided to give the crew an extra half hour of rest, but the Commander was awake before Houston could send a wake-up call. On this night, he hadn't taken a Seconal and had still managed about 5 hours of good sleep. Schmitt had taken a tablet in order to get to sleep and had slept soundly for over seven hours. Evans had also taken a Seconal but said that he thought he'd tossed and turned most of the night. However, the surgeon said that, although his periods of restlessness had been evident in the biomed data, none had been any longer than about ten minutes and it looked as though he'd gotten about 7 hours of good sleep.
084:12:53|ALSJ|summary|During launch from Earth and during the coast out to the Moon, the SIM Bay had been covered with a protective panel; but, now that the spacecraft was approaching lunar orbit, the experimenters were eager to get data and it was time to jettison the SIM Bay door.
084:42:47|ALSJ|summary|By later standards, the on-board Apollo computers were fairly primitive. The crew sometimes had to enter data (called Nouns) manually on a keyboard and then tell the computer what actions (called Verbs) to take. Memory was limited, although there was room for enough information that the computer could fly the nominal flight plan without minute by minute instructions from the crew. Houston could feed data for normal flight procedures directly into the computer when the crew set it up in Program 00 (called "pooh" for short) and put it in the Accept mode. For emergency purposes - say if they had to abort the mission and had lost communications with Earth - Houston occasional read up data "pads" which Schmitt then wrote into the appropriate blank spaces in the Flight Plan book. Because of the launch delay and the usual slight deviations of the trajectory from the planned path, Houston had a great deal of data to read up. Thanks to long hours of repeated practice, Schmitt and the ground team got the work done smoothly and without error. Slowly, Fullerton would read up a block of data and then Schmitt would read back what he had written before they moved on to the next block.
086:46:30|ALSJ|summary|All through the journey out from Earth, the crew had gotten a good view of Earth. As we have discussed, during the early hours of the mission they had been treated to a nearly full Earth. By now, their trajectory had carried them to a point where the Earth was about two-thirds full. Most of the time, they had been flying the spacecraft with its long axis oriented perpendicular to the Sun, slowly rotating around that axis so that all parts of the spacecraft would be heated uniformly. Informally, this was called the Barbecue mode or, in formal NASA-ese, the Passive Thermal Control (PTC) mode. There were five windows: one over each of the seats that gave a view more or less at right-angles to the long axis, and two others that gave a view forward for use during rendezvous and docking. For about two-thirds of each spacecraft rotation they had a good view of Earth. During the other half of each rotation, they had, in principle, a view of the Moon. However, because they were going to be landing at an eastern site just after local dawn, the Sun had been behind the Moon throughout most of the flight out from Earth. Therefore, the side of the Moon that they could see, the Nearside that always faces Earth, was in darkness and it wasn't until they got close that the perspective changed enough to see any of the sunlit portions. At a mission time of 86:46 - according to the reset clocks - Cernan reported their first view of the Moon.
086:47:03|ALSJ|summary|They were only about 5000 miles out and the Moon looked so big that Cernan had the impression that they were "coming right down on top of it". Half jokingly, he asked Fullerton if the tracking people were sure that they were going to miss the edge. Was the low point really going to be 73 miles as planned?
086:52:01|ALSJ|summary|They had to shield their eyes to see the Moon because, at the moment, the Sun was sitting right on the lunar horizon.
087:51:04|ALSJ|summary|Although Cernan had been to the Moon before, on the Apollo 10 approach the western Nearside limb had been in darkness and the final hours hadn't been so visually dramatic. Cernan remembered that, on Apollo 10, he'd been impressed with how fast they seemed to be climbing away when they left lunar orbit for the trip home and, also, that he'd wondered what it would be like coming in that fast toward a surface he could see. Now he knew. Fortunately, there was plenty of work - and a great deal of pure professionalism - to protect him and the others from the full psychological impact of their seeming headlong rush.
087:51:04|ALSJ|Schmitt|Until I was going through my set of pictures, that I eventually gave to the University of New Mexico, and saw some pictures that Gene had taken, my memory was that we didn't see the Moon during the final approach. And I still don't have a personal recollection of looking at the illuminated edge of the Moon. Not a strong one, anyway. But I think that's because Gene was in the seat to do that. We were not in barbecue. We were in the attitude-hold mode. And he was in the position to see it and I wasn't. I may have glanced at it once. In fact, the more I talk about it, the more I think I remember him saying 'Come over and look at this'. But, for a long time, I didn't have any recollection of seeing any part of an illuminated Moon as we came in.
087:51:04|ALSJ|Cernan|Jack and Ron, never having had the opportunity to see what I saw on Apollo 10, can't appreciate the approach to the Moon that we had. I don't think anybody in any of the missions had this approach. I think everybody, starting with Apollo 8, went into darkness in the shadow of the Moon, and got on their back and, at a predetermined time, fired the CSM engine - in darkness and upside down and going backwards - and then, all of a sudden - maybe five minutes, maybe ten minutes later - we'd come out of darkness at fifty miles or thereabouts above the surface and it's 'WOW! Look at those craters. There it is. Man.' It's just like instant sunlight and we're THERE! I mean, it's like we've been flying in the darkness to rendezvous with this thing we can't see (meaning the Moon) - and we know we're close because we're in the shadow - and all of a sudden, WHAM, someone turns the lights on. And then the next major thing is to come around and see the Earthrise. Now, on Apollo 17 - and nobody told me it was going to happen - we went through the darkness and came out into sunlight before we got to the Moon. And we were coming in on this damn target and we were seeing, to start with, just a sliver, just a slice of the Moon. And then we started to see more of it as we snuck around behind it. And it's getting big so fast you can't believe it. And I'm telling you, you talk about rolling over on your back and making a dive bombing run at some point some 50 or 60 miles above the surface! That was the most spectacular entry into lunar orbit. And I don't think anyone appreciates it! Except me! I don't think any of the other flights ever saw that. And I don't think Jack and Ron appreciated because I've got a feeling they thought it was supposed to be like that all the time.
088:43:38|ALSJ|summary|Now they were only 2660 miles out and had been accelerated by lunar gravity to 5000 feet per second. Cernan had the monocular out and, when the Moon was in view, got a good look into some of the larger craters on the illuminated edge. But then it was time to change the spacecraft orientation so that the big Service Module Engine would be pointed in the right direction when they swept down to their low point over the Farside. Half an hour before lunar gravity swept them around the west limb and out of radio contact with Earth, they had the linked CSM/LM re-oriented. Looking back past the LM, they could see the Earth. LOS (loss of signal) came at 88:43:21 and, eleven minutes later, the LOI (Lunar Orbit Insertion) burn to put them in a lunar orbit with a low point of 53 miles and a high point of 170 miles.
089:41:34|ALSJ|summary|On their first pass over the landing site, the area was in darkness and, because they had just gone through the dawn terminator a few moments before and still had the Sun shining in the spacecraft windows, Earthlight was of no help. By the time they came around again, the Sun would be up at Taurus-Littrow; but, first there was another burn to perform to put themselves in the proper orbit for the next day's descent. On this first pass over the Nearside and on the next as well, Houston took a careful look at the tracking data so that the burn parameters could be fine-tuned.
089:57:48|ALSJ|summary|While Houston was busy, the crew had an opportunity to admire the view and, throughout most of the Nearside pass, Schmitt gave a running commentary about the lunar surface below. Because they were near the high point of their initial orbit as they passed over the landing site, the Sun didn't go below their horizon for another ten minutes. But soon, thereafter, they began to pick out detail in the Earthshine. Because the Earth was virtually overhead throughout most of the Nearside pass, there weren't any Earthshine shadows to delineate the hills and holes until they had completed most of the Nearside pass. However, even without Earthshine shadows, they could see differences in albedo, differences in the degree to which the surface materials reflected the Earthshine. As an example, the bright rays emanating from the young crater Copernicus stood out quite well.
091:24:34|ALSJ|summary|By the time the crew re-emerged from behind the Moon again, Houston had the new data ready. Cernan configured the computer so that it could accept the uplinked data while Schmitt copied additional information that Fullerton read up. There was a great deal to be copied and Schmitt and Fullerton didn't finish until just before the second pass over the landing site. Down below, the shadows were very long. The North Massif was almost completely shadowed by the Sculptured Hills and there was little that was visible out on the valley floor. The only exception was the section of the Scarp near the crater Lara which, because it is highly reflective and was sloped toward the Sun, stood out quite prominently.
092:49:03|ALSJ|summary|For the rest of the orbit, the crew of Apollo 17 kept busy preparing for the burn that would put them in what was called the Descent Orbit. On the early missions, the CSM flew a 60-mile-high circular orbit and LM fuel was used to take the lander down, first, into a 15 by 60 mile orbit and then to the surface. However, beginning with Apollo 14 and in preparation for landing the heavy J-mission LMs, the mission profile was changed so that, prior to separation, CSM fuel was used to put both spacecraft in the 15 by 60 mile orbit. Consequently, at the end of their second orbit, when they were once again down to about 53 miles above the lunar surface, the crew of Apollo 17 fired the Service engine and changed the orbit from 53 by 170 to 59 by 15, with the low point now just east of the landing site.
105:47:28|ALSJ|summary|Landing day. If all went well and they got down on time and got the EVA started promptly, it was still going to be a 22 1/2 hour day from wake up to bedtime. Cernan and Schmitt had decided that there would be no point in a short landing day and a sleep period before going out. They were well-rested and fit. And there was no doubt that the Moon would hold their interest. The wake-up call for landing day was the John Denver version of the Steve Goodman song, The City of New Orleans, with its chorus of "Good morning, America, how are ya?" It is a happy song that had been suggested by people on the night shift in the press room - a song that matched the mood of the crew and, indeed, country-music-fan Schmitt requested a replay while he and the others finished waking up. Each of them had taken a Seconal; and Cernan and Schmitt, at least, had slept very soundly.
106:02:40|ALSJ|summary|LOS at the end of the ninth orbit came only ten minutes after wake-up and, by the time Apollo 17 had re-appeared forty five minutes later, the astronauts were getting the tunnel cleared and were getting into their suits. They'd had a very quick breakfast.
107:59:32|ALSJ|summary|Check out of the LM went quickly and smoothly; and, not long after AOS (Acquisition of Signal) on the eleventh orbit, Evans was in his suit and was busily sealing up the tunnel in preparation for undocking. As one of the last items, all three of them donned their helmets and gloves and performed pressure checks. They would perform the maneuvers unpressurized for the simple reason that their dexterity was limited in an inflated suit. However, they wanted to make sure that, in an emergency, the suits would inflate and stay inflated as long as necessary.
109:53:48|ALSJ|summary|As planned, the crew undocked the two spacecraft during the Farside pass at the beginning of the 12th orbit. For the next hour and a half, the two spacecraft flew close to one another so that the astronauts could make visual inspections and perform final checks of systems. Later in the orbit, just before LOS, Evans fired the Service Engine to boost himself back up into a 60-mile circular orbit so that, in the event of an aborted landing, he would be in an optimal position for a rendezvous. As seemed usual in Apollo, the crew had a little trouble getting contact with Earth through the LM's steerable, high-gain antenna but, otherwise, Challenger was ready for the landing.
110:47:34|ALSJ|summary|Cernan and Schmitt pressurized the propellant tanks and, a few minutes later, made their last pass over Taurus-Littrow prior to the descent. Evans had not yet made his circularization burn and was ahead and slightly below them. It was a spectacular, oblique view of the valley. They were less than fifteen miles away, and the LM crew took a couple of color pictures. Cernan was particularly interested in the small group of craters that surrounded his target point, and he called out the names as he found them.
111:48:04|ALSJ|summary|Evans did his circularization burn and, five minutes later, the LM crew did a more modest burn to move the low point of their orbit down to 10 1/2 miles over a point east of the landing site.
112:36:13|ALSJ|summary|At AOS on the 13th orbit, Evans reappeared first and confirmed that the LM burn had gone well. And then, once Houston had a bit more tracking data with which to update the LM computer, everything was ready for the landing.
188:17:15|ALSJ|summary|The Ascent burn lasted about 7 minutes and 18 seconds and it put the Challenger crew into an elliptical orbit with a low point of 9 nautical miles above the Moon and a high point of 50. It was a nearly perfect burn. At 12 minutes 12 seconds after launch, Gene did series of RCS (Reaction Control System) firings - called "tweak burns" - to fine tune the orbit. Compared with their 5500 foot-per-second (fps) orbital speed, the velocity change that Gene wanted - 4 fps aft (down through the ascent engine bell), 1 fps out the plus-Z axis (out the windows), and 9 fps left (toward Gene's side of the spacecraft) - was trivial in the extreme. However, they wouldn't rendezvous with Ron for another hour and a half - not until they'd gone around the backside of the Moon and were in radio contact with Earth again - and a net speed change of 10 feet per second meant the difference between a perfect rendezvous and a miss of several kilometers. Better to do the tweak now, with a small engine burn, rather than later with a bigger one.
188:19:31|ALSJ|summary|Because the required velocity change was so small, Gene actually did three separate RCS firings - one for each of the three spacecraft axes. With Jack watching the AGS (Abort Guidance Computer), Gene fired the thrusters associated with the x-axis - which ran up through the Ascent Engine bell to the overhead hatch - until the AGS told them that they had made the desired 1 fps velocity change. Then he did the z-axis change - the z-axis runs from the rear of the cabin forward toward the hatch - and, finally, the y-axis (left/right) change. By the time they were done, they were 125 miles behind and below the Command-and-Service Module (CSM).
188:20:44|ALSJ|summary|The LM crew was flying in an orientation such that, when they got close enough, they would have a clear view of their sister ship. About 18 minutes after the launch, Gene got his first visual sighting of the CSM. He and Jack had just passed through the sunrise terminator into darkness and, although Ron was still out in front of them, he was high enough that he was still in sunlight. Moments later, Ron also passed into darkness and, once his eyes adjusted to the lower light levels, he spotted the tracking light on Challenger.
188:50:44|ALSJ|summary|The two spacecraft were now about 112 miles apart, engines quiet and following paths which, through the magic of orbital mechanics, would soon bring them together. Fifty minutes after launch, Challenger and America disappeared behind the Moon and, by the time they reappeared, forty-five minutes later, they were only 0.8 miles apart and were closing at a stately 30 fps. Gene and Jack had their backs to the Moon and were looking almost straight up at Ron in the CSM. Ron, too, had a good view. His TV camera was mounted in one of the CSM windows so that Houston and the rest of the world could watch Challenger as it seemingly rose up from the lunar surface. Gradually, Gene slowed his approach and, at a separation of only 100 feet, he stopped. Then Ron did a slow rotation of the CSM so that the LM crews could do a visual examination of the ship that would take them all home.
190:01:41|ALSJ|summary|As the two ships passed over the landing site for the first time since lift-off, Gene and Ron maneuvered into docking attitude and then, ever so slowly, Gene inched closer. There was no need to hurry. They were going to spend the next two days in lunar orbit, gathering more data and adding to the wealth of visual observations that Ron had already provided. Fifteen minutes after they started to maneuver, the two spacecraft were docked and, in a few minutes more, they were sure that all the latches were secure. They had a hard dock and could open the hatches, clear the connecting tunnel and begin to transfer the precious lunar samples.
190:22:19|ALSJ|summary|After the message from the President, Gene made a gracious statement of thanks and then Jack and Ron added brief thanks of their own. But, inside, Jack was steaming. Apollo was ending, but there were still 27 years left in the century and he hated the thought of an American President telling a whole generation that they would have no chance to do their own lunar exploration. But there was nothing Jack could do but suppress his anger and, in the meantime, there was some more exploration that he and the others could do before they headed home.
190:41:30|ALSJ|summary|Once the hatches were open and the tunnel was cleared, Ron passed over the vacuum cleaner and Gene and Jack got busy with the worst of the dust. LOS (Loss-of-signal) came about forty minutes after the docking and, by the time Apollo 17 re-emerged three quarters of an hour later, Gene and Jack were handing sample containers over to Ron. With his own interests in mind, Ron also made sure that they had all the helmets and gloves and other gear that they would need for his EVA. Once they had left lunar orbit and were on their way home, Ron was going to go outside, secured with a tether, to retrieve film canisters from the SIM (Scientific Instrument Module) Bay. The EVA promised to be the highlight of the mission for Ron and he didn't want to lose out on his chance by leaving a helmet or a glove behind in the LM.
192:01:26|ALSJ|summary|The rocks and the helmets and gloves were all safely aboard America and, indeed, the Command Module was so full of rocks and astronauts that the only way they were going to get a little elbow room was to get rid of a jettison bag that Ron had been filling for the last three days. Consequently, just before they closed the LM hatch for the last time, the astronauts tossed the bulging jett bag into the now empty cabin of the LM. Challenger had one last mission to accomplish. She was headed back down to the Moon for a planned impact on the eastern flank of the South Massif, a final sacrifice to the gods of seismology; and, as Challenger made her last trip down to the lunar surface. She also had the unglamorous - but necessary - job of carrying the trash.
193:58:03|ALSJ|summary|Because of the precision that was hoped for Challenger's impact, the jettison operation was carefully choreographed. The crew got their suits on and did a pressure check. Then they pressurized the connecting tunnel and, at about 194 hours into the mission, released the latches so that the pressure in the tunnel could gently push the two spacecraft apart. For another half hour, the flight controllers made sure that they could control the LM attitude; and then, at the proper moment, at 195 hours 38 minutes into the mission, they did a long firing of the LM's RCS thrusters. At launch from Earth, the LM was carrying 630 lbs of RCS propellant and, because things had gone so smoothly throughout the flight, there were still 450 pound left when the LM was released for it's final descent. During the long, 1 minute 56 second burn, another 270 pounds of propellants was expended, enough to trim 213 feet per second off the orbital speed of the 5277 pound Ascent Stage and send it toward impact with the South Massif.
195:52:44|ALSJ|summary|Because there were only 40 hours left before the crew was scheduled to leave lunar orbit, the instrumentation in the SIM Bay were still busily gathering data. There wasn't going to be another opportunity to gather close-up lunar data for a long time and a visual observation of the LM impact was of lesser importance than proper orientation of the Command Module for data gathering. Consequently, the crew was looking back along their ground track at the moment of impact and, because the LM was flying in a lower orbit, they were not yet over the landing site when it hit.
195:52:44|ALSJ|summary|Down on the lunar surface, the TV camera on the Rover was still in good working order and, as the moment of impact approached, Ed Fendell pointed it at the planned impact point high on the eastern slope. But there was a question. Because there was only a limited amount of tracking data that could be acquired in the 17 minutes between the end of the deorbit burn and the impact, predictions of the impact point were uncertain by about 10 to 15 kilometers. Fendell could look at most of the error ellipse if he pulled back on his zoom; but, with a wide field, he would have limited resolution, which would lower his chances of seeing anything. For several minutes, he played with the zoom and adjusted his pointing. However, in the end, he went to maximum zoom and aimed at the planned point and hoped for the best. Given the relatively poor resolution of the camera - even at maximum zoom - there wasn't much chance of success and, even though the LM did hit the mountain within a mile of the planned spot, nothing was seen by the eager audience in Houston. The seismometers that Jack had deployed at the ALSEP site recorded the impact, but there was nothing to be seen on the TV.
195:52:44|ALSJ|summary|The LM impacted with a speed of about 1.5 km/s and with a mass of 2400 kilograms. The impact energy was, therefore, 2.7e16 ergs. From a paper by V.R. Overbeck, we can estimate that the total displaced mass was about 6.7e8 grams. Then, if the mean density of the target material was 2.0 g/cc and the crater was conical in shape with a depth one-fourth its diameter, the crater diameter was about 17 meters.
207:37:10|ALSJ|summary|On their final full day in lunar orbit, the crew of Apollo 17 was going to spend most of their time doing out-the-window geology and the wake-up music was Roberta Flack's "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face." During the day, Jack, the professional geologist, and Ron, the seasoned lunar observer did most of the talking.
213:43:23|ALSJ|summary|Because of the discovery of orange soil at Shorty Crater at the landing site, they spent a lot of time looking for color at various places where they and the geologists in the Backroom thought that they might find other pyroclastic deposits. As they passed over the landing site, Ron noted that the orange coloration at Shorty was no longer visible but, a bit further west, in the Solpicius Gallus area in southwestern Mare Serenitatis, both he and Jack described numerous features that not only showed prominent orange, but also reds and reddish browns. Eventually, Jack saw enough that he was ready of offer an explanation of the colored layers.
212:34:45|ALSJ|summary|For most of the day, the astronauts described what they were seeing out the window. The large, mare-filled, Farside crater Tsiolkovsky was of particular interest and so, too, was Mare Symthii near the eastern rim. Jack, of course, tended to talk in terms of comparisons between the various features he was seeing and, at one point provided a lengthy discussion of the so-called "wrinkle-ridge" systems which bound the various mare. Jack was truly in a geologist's paradise and, at one point, Fullerton jokingly told the crew that a requested change in the comm configuration was being done "so that the secretaries that are transcribing the air-to-ground can catch up with Jack."
220:01:10|ALSJ|summary|Former President Harry S Truman - who had been in the crew's thoughts throughout the mission - was still in serious condition. He died the day after Christmas.
236:58:05|ALSJ|summary|The TEI (Trans Earth Injection) burn was done over the Farside about eight hours after wake-up. During their final hours in lunar orbit, all three of the astronauts passed along miscellaneous geology observations, but the burn was the main event and, when they emerged from behind the Moon for the last time, Gene was able to report a nearly perfect, 1/2 g burn.
236:58:05|ALSJ|summary|America climbed rapidly away from the Moon and, indeed, the increased altitude meant that AOS came more than 13 minutes early than it would have without the burn. The climb out from the Moon also gave the crew some new perspectives and they shared the view with Houston, especially a spectacular TV tour of the crater Tsiolkovsky. By the time the landing site came into view, they were 2000 miles out and they were beginning to lose detail.
250:53:16|ALSJ|summary|During the stop at Van Serg toward the end of the third EVA, Gene and Jack had been surprised and puzzled that this fairly sizable impact out in the middle of the valley was not the basaltic rocks that they had come to expect but, rather, some very fragile rocks that looked to be breccias - rocks made up of fragments of other rocks fused together by an impact. On the drive back to the LM, Jack had speculated that Van Serg had, by chance, hit a "window" in the basalt and had dug up underlying breccias but, he remembers not being very happy with the hypothesis. Because Van Serg is only a few tens of meters deep, the "window" hypothesis would require that, elsewhere in the valley where they did see basaltic rocks, the basaltic layer not be very thick. Consequently, Jack's thinking during the night may have been influenced by the report from Fullerton that the Traverse Gravimeter was indicating that the basaltic valley fill was three or four kilometers thick and, therefore, the Van Serg breccias had to be made from something that was lying on top of the basalt at that location. Perhaps they were actually clods of soil which had been highly compressed - turned into a fragile "instant" rock - in the impact. And, indeed, when the Van Serg breccias were examined back in Houston, they proved to be soil breccias - larger, more competent versions of the instant rock that Gene and Jack saw at the rims of smaller craters at several places in the valley.
253:59:12|ALSJ|summary|They put all the miscellaneous trash they'd accumulated since saying goodbye to Challenger and removed the center couch so that they'd have room for Ron to get out and for Jack to stand in the hatch and take pictures. (The jettison bag would drift off only slowly as they continued their journey and, once it hit the top of the atmosphere, would quickly burn up.)
257:33:59|ALSJ|summary|Gene advised Ron to be sure that, once he had made his way back to the SIM Bay, he got his feet firmly planted in the footholds before he did anything else. During Gene's "spacewalk", which was only the third which had ever been done and the first in which an astronaut attempted to do real work outside the spacecraft, Gene was hindered by a lack of hand and footholds. When he tried to use a wrench to turn a bolt, it was he who tended to turn and, coupled with the inadequate cooling capability of the Gemini suit, he had a very frustrating and tiring time of it. For later Gemini EVAs, hand and footholds were added to the outside of the spacecraft and, back at the Apollo 17 SIM Bay, there was a pair of good footholds for Ron to use.
279:41:40|ALSJ|summary|The ALFMED experiment was repeated on the trip back from the Moon, this time with all three of them wearing blindfolds. On that occasion, none of them reported any flashes. Readers may want to note, however, that the surgeon reported that the LMP seemed to be asleep during much of the homeward-bound experiment. ("My heart rate was very low anyway.")
301:17:18|ALSJ|summary|Three hours before splashdown, Gene gave America a nudge of 2.1 feet per second to fine tune his trajectory. Considering how far and how long they had traveled since the TEI burn, this minuscule burn was a testament to the men and women who and designed, built, and flown the Apollo spacecraft.
304:31:50|ALSJ|summary|America landed in the Pacific, 1.3 miles from its target. Crammed into the spacecraft with the crew were more samples and more frames of exposed film than any other crew had brought back to Earth and, although the splashdown marked the end of Apollo, it was a grand and fitting finale.
