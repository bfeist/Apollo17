000:00:00|Apollo 17 is the final lunar mission of the Apollo programme and it is the the only launch of a Saturn V vehicle scheduled for night time. The launch window for the mission opens at 21:53 Eastern Standard Time on 6 December 1972 (02:53 GMT on 7 December) but a technical problem will delay lift-off until after local midnight. In the event, Apollo 17 will launch at 12:33:00 EST (05:33:00 GMT) on 7 December 1972.
000:13:47|Apollo 17 has just entered an orbit around Earth after a successful and spectacular night launch that was 2 hours, 40 minutes late due to a ground problem. Very shortly, the spacecraft will go out of range of the tracking ship USNS Vanguard. Had it launched on the originally intended azimuth of 72&deg;, it would have passed trough the reception area of a station on one of the Canary Island. Instead, the actual azimuth of 91.503&deg; will take it far south of that station. It will next be picked up by the Carnarvon tracking station in Australia half an orbit around Earth.

009:12:33|The crew have turned in for the night after their first day in space. Their first sleep period is deliberately short in order to resynchronise their sleep/wake cycle with Houston time, having been brought out of it somewhat by the need to launch at night, then forced further out by a 2-hour, 40-minute delay caused by a faulty sequencer at launch. Later in the mission, at 46 hours, they will start doing the tasks in their Flight Plan one hour early, then at 65 hours, the GET clock will be advanced by 2:40. This will place them back on a Flight Plan that matches the Earth times for the main mission events. The spacecraft's trajectory had already been set by a TLI burn that was calculated to bring them to the Moon at the time originally planned for the mission.
068:04:27|When the Apollo crews began to leave the relative safety of low Earth orbit and venture to the Moon, some of them would report seeing flashes in their eyes. Dave Scott of Apollo 15 compared pinpoint instances as appearing like a camera flashgun going off in the distance. Some occurrences appeared as streaks. They seemed to be related to having ventured beyond the Van Allen belts and are now thought to be due to very high energy cosmic rays interacting with the human optical system. To try to characterise the flashes, the Apollo 15 crew sat blindfolded in the CM cabin for an hour and verbally called out each time they saw a flash. On Apollo 16 and 17, these studies were taken further by having a crewmember wear an apparatus on their head to try to record the passage of the rays on their way to the eye/brain.
089:15:30|At 088:43:21, the Apollo 17 stack passed around the western limb of the Moon with respect to the ground station on Earth that was handling their communication. It is heading towards its closest approach to the far side on its current trajectory which will be just 52.5 nautical miles (97.2 km) altitude. At about this point, the SPS engine will be ignited to reduce their speed and rob them of the momentum that would take the spacecraft away from the Moon again. This will place them in an initial orbit measuring 52 by 170 nautical miles [96 by 315 km]. Note that there is no recording of the crew conversations covering LOI which is unusual for the Apollo missions. As detailed at the end of this nearside pass, a step was missed prior to LOI when setting up the bit rate used to record engine data.
090:41:00|The crew of Apollo 17 have entered lunar orbit and have made a single pass across the nearside of the Moon. They have just disappeared around the far side for a second time. When they do so for a third time, they will make a 22-second burn of the SPS engine in order to lower their nearside altitude down to only 14.9 nautical-miles [27.6 km]. This will be the descent orbit from where Cernan and Schmitt will descend to their landing site at Taurus-Littrow
