This is a project to digitize the Apollo 17 transcripts. I have started with the TEC (technical air to ground) transcript.
Read more about the project here https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/spacelog/H7D4UiLfhPo
Feel free to contact me if you're interested in this project or the output.

_Source_Images folder:
- PDFs
- PNGs (these were converted from jp2 format)

The "Abbyy Image OCR" folder contains a project that can be opened using ABBYY FineReader 11 Pro. This is where the body of the conversion work is being done.

The "OCR_Output" folder contains pipe-delimited CSV files that are direct outputs from FineReader.
The file "A17_TEC_cleaned.csv" in the "OCR Output" is the output of cleancsv.py in the "MC Processing" folder. This script scrubs timestamps and other data to make a more workable CSV. This output is experimental.

The "MC_Output" folder contains the output from processpipe.py in the "MC Processing" folder. This "MC" output is a format that's usable by Spacelog.org.
