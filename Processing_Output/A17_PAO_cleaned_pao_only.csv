-00:01|PAO|This is Mission Control. Gene Cernan reporting the launch vehicle maneuvering to the proper attitude, everything looking good at this point.
|PAO|First stage looks good. Altitude 1.1 miles. Booster says we look good. We are now at 2.5 miles.
|PAO|Everybody says "Looking great - Right on the line . We re now 1 mile down range. Launch vehicle 4,2 miles high. Coming up on maximum dynamic pressure at this point. 4 miles down range, 8 miles high and the velocity approaching 3000 feet per second.
|PAO|And the flight dynamics officer says we look good on all sources, right on the trajectory.
|PAO|Flight Director, Gene Kranz, taking a status for staging, we say we look good for staging.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/6/72 CST 23:31 GET 00:01 MC-45/2
000:01|PAO|Inboard engines shutting down on time as planned. Crew will experience maximum G forces of about 4 Gs at shutdown. Coming up on first stage shutdown. And we've had shutdown on time on the first stage.
|PAO|That's the automatic guidance system, the inertial guidance system, performing properly.
|PAO|Apollo 17 now 65 miles high.
|PAO|Coming up on 5 minutes. Everything still looks very good in the launch of Apollo 17. The launch vehicle spacecraft now 80 miles high, 230 miles down range.
|PAO|Capcom, Robert Obermeyer, advising Gene Cernan and the crew aboard Apollo 17 the second stage shutdown at about 9 minutes 20 seconds elapsed time. We'll have that shutdown in about 3 and a half minutes from now.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/6/72 2331 CST 00:01 GET MC-45/3
000:01|PAO|Apollo 17 still right on the nominal trajectory at an altitude now of about 92 nautical miles.
|PAO|Now 7 minutes in and we have sufficient velocity to make orbit with the Saturn third stage should we have an unexpected early shutdown of the second stage.
|PAO|We're now less than 2 minutes from second stage shutdown and ignition of the Saturn third stage. And the center engine will be shutting down as scheduled in about 10 seconds .
|PAO|And that inboard shutdown looked to be on time. Apollo 17 now 625 miles downrange, 93 miles in altitude.
|PAO|The spacecraft guidance systems agreeing very closely with the Saturn guidance. It looks good.
|PAO|Staging now less than 1 minute.
|PAO|Apollo 17 traveling at 21 000 feet per second. It's achieved about 83 percent of the velocity required for a minimum orbit.
|PAO|And about 10 seconds to staging.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/6/72 2331 CST 00:01 GET MC 45/4
000:01|PAO|We're up to 23 000 feet per second - we'll be shooting for something over 25 000.
|PAO|Coming up on 10 minutes 30 seconds after liftoff and the spacecraft launch vehicle now 11 000 - 1100 miles, rather, downrange, altitude 93.4 miles.
|PAO|And we're about 1 minute from shutdown, about 1 minute from orbit insertion.
|PAO|And that looked like a near nominal shutdown. At shutdown we show 25 600 feet per second. That also looks very close.
|PAO|Gene Cernan reporting the on board Indication of an orbit of 93.5 by 89.5. Now we'll be getting tracking and confirming that here on the ground.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/6/72 GET 00:14 CST 23:43 MC 46/1
000:14|PAO|This is Apollo Control coming up on 14 minutes after liftoff, that liftoff coming about 2 hours 40 minutes late, and we'11 be assessing the effects of that late liftoff on subsequent events in the mission timeline, passing those along. One of the effects will be a change in the acquisition of signal loss of signal time and as we move along on the ground track -
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 16 minutes 45 seconds after liftoff. We've confirmed Apollo 17 is in a near nominal orbit. The crew reported an orbit of about 93.5 by 89.5 based on their onboard calculations and computations on the
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/6/72 CST 00:24 GET 25:00 MC 47/1
025:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 24 minutes. Apollo 17 now in an orbit about 90 miles by 93 miles and everything appears to be nominal aboard the spacecraft and aboard the launch vehicle, Saturn third stage. One additional impact of our late liftoff will be the loss of television coverage for the transposition and docking maneuver. The television coverage will not be possible because the ground track has shifted and we'don't have the site coverage that had been expected for television. The translunar injection burn, reigniting the Saturn third stage to put the spacecraft on its trajectory to the Moon, is now scheduled to occur at a ground elapsed time of 3 hours 12 minutes 35 seconds, or roughly 9 minutes earlier than the flight plan time. This again the effect of the late lift off. And we will be reacquiring Apollo 17 through the Carnarvon Tracking Station at a ground elapsed time of about 52 minutes 20 seconds, roughly 27 minutes from now.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control now 32 minutes after the liftoff of Apollc 17 and we have loss of signal with the spacecraft, we will be reacquiring through the Carnarvon Tracking Station in about 20 minutes. And from the President of the United States we have the following message to the crew of Apollo 17. The message reads: As you set forth on the final Apollo expedition to the Moon I want to have my personal best wishes for a successful mission and safe return. I am sure your voyage, your scientific exploration, will be the crowning achievement in a program which has expanded man's horizons, brought great credit to your country and lifted the spirits of people all over the world. God speed to you all. Signed Richard Nixon. The flight Dynamics officer, continuing to process tracking data, following orbital insertions, reports that there is a small amount of out of plane error showing up in the orbit. This is believed is due to a small error in the ins truient unit of the Saturn thrid stage. However, the orbit is very close to nominal, about 90 nautical miles by 93 nautical -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 0:35 CST 24:03 MC 48/1
000:35|PAO|However, the orbit is very close to nominal - about 90 nautical jiiles by 93 nautical miles. And, we look very good, both with respect to the spacecraft and with respect to the Saturn 3rd stage which must perform that burn putting Apollo 17 on its trajectory toward the Moon. At 34 minutes, this is Apollo Control Houston. This is Apollo Control. The postlaunch press conference at Cape Kennedy is scheduled to begin at 12:33 central standard time, 1:33 a.m. eastern standard time. Again, that time 12:33 central standard time, 1:33 eastern standard for the post-launch press conference at Cape Kennedy.

000:51|PAO|Control at 51 minutes into the flight of Apollo 17 and we're standing by to reacquire the spacecraft through the Carnarvon, Australia, tracking station. One of the things the booster engineer will be looking for when we reacquire them and get good log on the data will be the Saturn 3rd stage instrument unit. Looking at one brief bit of data before we lost signal, it appears that one of the four batteries in the instrument unit had a very high current drain on it. We will be looking closely at that to see if it was simply a telemetry problem or if, in fact, that battery does have some problem. And we should be about 15 seconds from reacquiring.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 00:51 CST 24:25 MC 49/3
000:51|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're coming up now one 1 hour after liftoff for Apollo 17. And as you heard CAPCOM Robert Overmyer reporting to the crew that everything looks good including the Saturn 3rd stage. Apparently the indication we had of a possible battery problem in the instrument unit nothing more than a bad bit of telemetry there. When the booster engln eer got a good hard look at the telemetry on this pass, he reported everything looked good. We are ready at this point to begin the post-launch press conference at Cape Kennedy and we 11 switch to Cape Kennedy and stand by for that press conference
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 1:25 CST OlOO MC 50/1
001:25|PAO|This is Apollo Control. 1 hour 25 minutes after lift off. During the postlaunch press conference at Cape Kennedy, we had a short aquisition with the crew through the Hawaian tracking station. During that period of conversation, and during that period of monitoring the systems on the spacecraft and the launch vehicle, we found that the situation was essentially unchanged. That is both vehicles now looking good; the spacecraft and the launch vehicle.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 0120 CST 1:45 GET MC 52/1
001:45|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 1 hour 51 minutes. We're getting good telemetry data from Apollo 17 through one of the Apollo Range Instrumented Aircraft out over the Atlantic Ocean. Apollo 17 moving across the Atlantic now towards Africa. And on the next revolution, at about this point, the spacecraft will be on its way to the Moon during the Trans-lunar injection maneuver. Ignition for that burn is scheduled to occur 1 hour 21 minutes from now. During launch the flight surgeon monitoring heart rates on the 3 crewmen recorded peak heart rates of 130 for the Commander Gene Cernan, also 130 for Command Module pilot, Ron Evans, and 115 for Lunar Module pilot, Jack Schmitt. We should be reacquiring the command service module and reestablishing voice communications with the astronauts in about 2 minutes from now through Ascension.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We should be acquiring the spacecraft through Ascension in about 5 seconds and reestablishing voice communications with the crew.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 1:55 CST 0130 MC 53/2
001:55|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Apollo 17 now over the horizon from the Ascension site - will be reacquiring in about 25 minutes through Carnarvon. And, as you heard CAPCOM Robert Overmyer advising the crew, we've been getting a good look at all the data, and spacecraft launch vehicles look fine.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 0200 GET 2:25 MC 54/1
002:25|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 2 hours 25 minutes. Apollo 17 now approaching the west coast of Australia. And we'll be reacquiring the spacecraft in about 35 seconds. During this pass over Carnarvon we expect to pass up the first set of numbers to the crew that they'll use in the translunar injection burn to put them on their trajectory toward the Moon. That maneuver is scheduled to begin at 47 minutes from now. And we have acquisition of signal a little bit early.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 0224 CST 2:49 GET MC-55/1
002:49|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 2 hours 49 minutes. We're standing by now to acquire radio contact with Apollo 17 through Hawaii. During this Hawaian pass we're getting another good look at spacecraft and launch vehicle systems. The last look we had through Carnarvon everything looked very good. Flight Director, Gene Kranz, going over the status for these flight controllers observed that there appeared to be no problems that would interfere with TLI and we expect to have a normal translunar injection, about 23 minutes from now as Apollo 17 completes its stateside pass and moves out over the Atlantic Ocean at the start of its third revolution.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 03:34 GET 2:59 MC 56/1
002:59|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 3 hours 4 minutes. We are now some 8 minutes away from ignition. Everything's looking good for the translunar injection maneuver, the combined S-IVB Saturn third stage and the spacecraft with an orbital weight of three hundred eight thousand two hundred ninety eight pounds at the start of this maneuver.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 3:09 CST 0244 MC 57/1

|PAO|And telemetry data from the Saturn instrument unit shows the velocity increasing up now to 26 000 feet per second, beginning to climb ever more rapidly. This burn was initiated at an altitude of about 97 nautical miles above Earth, and when finished, the spacecraft will be at about 15 0 miles above Earth, and on its way to the Moon, some 213 000 miles nautical mi 1es away.
|PAO|Very weak voice communications and booster says the data is now static but at last look everything looked normal.
|PAO|That was CAPCOM Robert Overmyer confirming to the crew that our data showed the Saturn shifting its propellant utilization for a most efficient utilization of the propellant.

003:20|PAO|Well, we're still getting communications through the Apollo Range instrumented aircraft. We'll be picking up through Ascension shortly, at which time we'd expect the communications to improve, the noise to drop off. From Gene Cernan's report, also from the reports from Ron Evans, it appeared that that translunar injection was extremely close to nominal. The crew read a cut off time of 5 minutes 52 seconds. The premaneuver prediction was 5 minutes

The white team of flight controllers, headed by Gene Krantz, is in the process now, of handing over to the team headed by flight director Pete Frank. After 12 hours, the team came on about 3 hours prior to the scheduled launch time of 8:53 PM Central Standard Time. Of course, launch occurred 2 hours 40 minutes late at a ground elapsed time of 11, — of a Central Standard Time rather, 11:33 PM. As a result of the late launch-time the trans-lunar injection, that's up through translunar injection, also slipped 2 hours, 40 minutes. We would expect that the translunar injection which is targeted to make up the difference will get us back on the nominal flight plan time by the time the spacecraft arrives at the Moon. In other words, arrival time at the Moon would be at the same Central Standard Time as called for in the Flight Plan at about 1:49 PM Central Standard Time, December 10.

The Booster Systems Engineer has advised Flight Director Pete Frank that a second midcourse correction for the S-IVB, the third stage of the launch vehicle will be required. This maneuver is performed with the auxiliary propulsion system of the S-IVB, and the Booster Systems Engineer will command this burn at 11 hours 15 minutes ground elapsed time. The magnitude of the burn is not known at this time. That will be determined shortly before the midcourse is performed. The purpose is to tune up the trajectory to more precisely target the S-IVB stage to the desired impact point on the lunar surface. Tracking to this point of the spacecraft indicates that a midcourse correction will probably be performed for the spacecraft at the scheduled midcourse number 2 time at 35 hours and 30 minutes.

010:36|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 11 hours 27 minutes ground elapsed time into the mission of Apollo 17. Approximately 11 minutes ago, as you were 6 minutes ago, the S-IVB corrective burn was performed roughly 14.2 feet per second to modify the trajectory of the S-IVB third stage in the Saturn V, targeting for impact just west of the crater Ptolemaeus at latitude 7 degrees south by longitude 3 degrees west. However, the actual impact location and the time of impact will be forthcoming after some additional hours of tracking of the stage has been gathered. We're looking now at a midcourse correction burn number 2 of the Apollo 17 spacecraft at 35 hours 30 minutes, with a change in velocity -a posigrade of 10.5 feet per sec on d. S one 3-1/2 hours remaining in the crew rest period. All three apparently sound asleep at this time. And the passive thermal control mode puts the spacecraft at spinning at some 3 revolutions per hour. To repeat earlier statistics on half way in distance, time, and when the so-called sphere of influence is crossed will be at the half way point in distance at 30 hours and 3 minutes ground elapsed time, in which time it will be 114 787 nautical miles either direction to the Earth or Moon. And a half way point in time will occur at 43 hours 8 minutes and 6 seconds when the spacecraft will be 144 924 nautical miles out from Earth; and 87 561 nautical miles out from the Moon. The so-called sphere crossing, or the point in which the spacecraft is assumed to come under the gravitational influence of the Moon, will take place at 70 hours 43 minutes 24 seconds when the spacecraft is 33 639 nautical miles out from the Moon and approaching.

And Apollo 17 at the present time is 56 948 nautical miles out from earth at a velocity of 7 609 feet per second. A short time ago the Booster Systems Engineer Frank Von Ren seler reported that after the final APS burn in the S-IVB stage, which is targeting the stage to impact on the Moon, he reported that the S-IVB stage was tumbling intentionally after that burn, and as he gathered up all his documents and packed his briefcase, on the flight directors loop, he said, "I've enjoyed working with you on the Apollo program." Flight Director Neil Hutchinson replied "It's been nice riding with you." The riding implication being that they were riding on his launch vehicle. Van Renseler is a Marshall Spaceflight Center Engineer detailed to the Flight Control Division here at Manned Spacecraft Center. Van Rensleser finished his job for the last time. He packed his launch vehicle documents and left the room. The booster systems console is vacant for the final time in Apollo. Some 2-1/2 hours remaining in the crew sleep period. No word from the crew. They have not talked to the ground nor vice versa in the last several hours and at 12 hours 29 minutes this is Apollo Control.

They will be awakened about 2:30 Central Time. This is a rather short sleep period slightly under six hours, the object being to get the crew back on to Houston time day-night cycle eventually. The cycle disturbed somewhat by the, - initially what would have been a night launch, and ended up being a morning launch, - early morning launch at least by Cape time. Got a hand over to the Goldstone 210-foot tracking antenna, about 8 minutes ago.

And getting back on schedule with Apollo 17 because of the late liftoff and the hold situation early this morning. The translunar injection burn was targeted to get the spacecraft at the moon or into lunar orbit at about the same actual time it would have had we launched on time - at 8:53 P.M. last night central time. However, to get the flight plan back on the actual indicated ground elapsed times shown in the flight plan at approximately 64 hours they're going to have what is called a GET update some two hours and 40 minutes to force the event times in the flight plan to agree with actual ground elapsed times flown in the mission.

He had mentioned earlier in his post-sleep checklist that he was considering taking two aspirins. Apollo 17 is presently 72 843 nautical miles out from Earth. Velocity 6477 feet per second.

During the change of shift press briefing, flight director Gene Kranz reviewed the status of the mission with each of his flight controllers everything essentially normal at this point. Flight dynamics officer reported that they have not yet gotten sufficient tracking on the S-IVB trajectory to give an impact point based on tracking. We should have that in a matter of hours. And we'll get a report as soon as a set of coordinates for the S-IVB impact are available. Also, capcom Gordon Fullerton read up a news report to the crew. And it's been relatively quiet for the past 5 or 10 minutes on the air to ground line. We'll replay the accumulated tape and as soon as we've caught up with the tape we'll stand by for live conservations with the crew.

019:32|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 19 hours 33 minutes. That completes our replay of the segments of the air-to-ground that were lost on a portion of the Public Affairs Release Network earlier today. During that replay, we accumulated about 5 or 6 minutes of additional tapes with the crew, how the activities involved during that period of time or completion of waste water dump, the crew dumping excess water produced by the fuel cells and stored in a storage tank on the spacecraft, and they dump it down to about 10 percent of its quantity, or its capacity. And, also completed one other routine housekeeping activity. That was cycling the film in the panoramic and mapping cameras contained back in the service module scientific instrument module bay. That bay, of course, still has the door over it.

019:41|PAO|This is Apollo control. That completes our replay of accumulated tape we'll now stand by for any live conservations with the crew. One thing additionally that we get out of cycling the cameras the panoramic and mapping cameras as an indication of how they are performing mechanically. As you heard based on the telemetry data that we got here on the ground both cameras appear to be functioning properly tucked away in the scientific instrument module bay of the CSM. You also heard some conservation with Jack Schmitt who is wearing the biomedical harness during sleep periods it's customary for one of the three crewman only to wear the biomedical harness which allows them to get heart rate during the sleep period and the crewman take turns wearing that biomedical harness and during the sleep we are getting good biomedical data good heart rate data on Schmitt at the present time. Also, Ron Evans commented on getting the spacecraft in the PTC attitude. Essentially, this attitude has the spacecraft oriented at right angles to it's direction of travel. Right angles to the Earth Moon plane so that the Sun is essentially shining on the sides of the vehicle of the CSM and LM. And, then using the reaction control system thrusters on the conand module they set up a slow roll rate so that the two vehicles docked together are rotating at the rate of about three revolutions per hour. And, if this is done properly and it's a tricky maneuver usually crews get more and more experienced at it as they go through the mission, and tend to have the most problems early on in getting it set up. But if it is set up with all of the rates damped and everything very stable when the roll is started it will maintain this roll without wobbling out of it throughout the rest period. The purpose of this is to maintain a proper thermal equilibrium on the spacecraft so that the heating on one side from the Sun the cooling of the other as it is exposed to the black of space is uniform and nothing gets too hot or too cold. At the present time Apollo 17 is 84 482 nautical miles from earth and the velocity continuing to decrease gradually down to about 5 824 feet per second just a little over one mile per second. We'll continue to stand by live now for any conversations with the crew. This could continue to be a relatively quiet period based on Ron Evans or I guess it was Jack Schmitt's comment that Evans was in the kitchen leads us to believe that they are probably getting ready to eat. This is Apollo control at 19 hours 45 minutes.

|PAO|The crew set up the spacecraft in the passive thermal control mode before their previous sleep period and experienced no difficulty, and they appear to be going very smoothly. In this passive thermal control setup you heard CAPCOM Robert Overmeyer who's come in to relieave CAPCOM Gordon Fullerton, advise them that the rates have been killed off sufficiently to begin rotating the veh i c les now.

020:40|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 20 hours 45 minutes. We're occasionally picking up a bit of noise on the Air-to-Ground circuit. This is due to the fact that the spacecraft is in the passive thermal control mode, as it rotates. We're gradually losing contact through one of the OMNI antennas and re-establishing adequate signal strength on another one. And as it moves from antenna to antenna on our coverage, we get the noise. This is a characteristic that becomes more pronounced as the spacecraft gets farther and farther from Earth. Here in Mission Control, the Flight Activities Officer has been actively involved in figuring out how in the flight plan we're going to make up for the

And from that point on, the GET clock will be back in synchronization with the flight plan. This clock update is presently scheduled to occur at 66 hours Ground Elapsed Time, rather at 67 hours 40 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, and we'll move the clocks to 66 hours.

They've also been charging the two entry batteries that are used during peak electrical loads of liftoff, and then are recharged during the translunar coast when the fuel cells are producing a surplus of electrical energy. They recharged one of those two batteries and are in the process of recharging the second one at this time. And you heard the crew describe going into their pre-sleep checklist and getting things aboard the spacecraft configured for the sleep period, which is scheduled to begin at 25 hours ground elapsed time or a little more than 1-1/2 hours from now. Apollo 17 at this time is 96 244 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at 5 264 feet per second. And all spacecraft systems continue to function almost perfectly as planned. A little while ago the lunar module officer - control officer - confirmed from telemetry what Gene Cernan was reporting visually out the window and that is that the lunar module appears to be in very good shape.

Apollo 17, 137 714 nautical miles out from Earth, velocity now, 3985 feet per second, continuing to decelerate as we approach the so-called cross over between the sphere of influence from Earth to Moon. I can't recall ever seeing two pages of a flight plan as blank as these are, from 36 hours to 38 hours. Later on today, the, — after the eat—period the crew will crawl through the hatch into the Lunar Module for housekeeping chores checking out of stowage of equipment in the Lunar Module.

039:57|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Cernan and Evans at this time have gone into the Lunar Module, and they're going through the housekeeping transfer of items from the command module into the lunar module and will proceed with the checklist of activating the spacecraft, or lunar module, spacecraft communications system, and the communications have been split into two links on Earth, Air-to-Ground 1 for the command module, and Air-to-Ground 2 for the lunar module. They're on hot mikes of a voice-actuated circuit, so we can hear them run through the items as they accomplish them aboard the lunar module, Challenger.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control, a correction on the earlier statement, it is Cernan and Schmitt in the Lunar Module Challenger at this time. Evans had the detail of removing the probe and drogue earlier, but he's by his lonesome, back in the Command Module.

We're estimating the change of shift press conference in 15 minutes, 15 minutes at 6:15 central time in the small briefing room. Spacecraft communicator now is Bob OvermeyeT. During this past checkout of the lunar module. We've had considerable difficulty in some of the communications configurations in the way the down links and the uplinks were set up. And some bit of difficulty in sorting out just what the nature of the problem with one of the docking is. People will be examining this through the night and during the checkout of the LM tomorrow or additional work in the LM perhaps the thing can be sorted out. Apollo 17 presently at 143 562 nautical miles from Earth traveling at a velocity of 3 590 feet per second.

The crew is now in the midst of the heat flow and convection demonstration. This is the demonstration designed to provide more exact data on the behavior of fluids in a low gravity field. This type of investigation is really not possible on Earth where gravity determines flow of fluids. In space the flow forces the surface tension. There are three test cells involved in this demonstration for measuring and observing the fluid flow, behavior and the results are recorded with the 16 mm camera aboard. We have about 5 minutes worth of tape that accumulated during the news conference and we'll play that for you now and then pickup live.

004:34|PAO|This is Apollo control at 44 hours 43 minutes. That was a reminder that we are approaching the time where we are going to make the first step in a two step adjustment caused by the late launch. This will be to bring the Greenwich mean time, the ground elapsed time and the flight plan together. What this first step will account for an hour of 2 hours and 40 minutes adjustment that will be made eventually. The clocks will not be recycled at this time at 45 hours. The clock recycling will be accomplished later in the mission at 65 hours elapsed time. This 1 hour adjustment consists of moving the activities that were scheduled in the flight plan to take place between 46 hours and 30 minutes and 47 hours up to 45 hours in the flight plan. Therefore, during the hour from 45 hours to 46 hours we will have accomplished all the flight plan activities that were originally scheduled to be accomplished from

Apollo 17 is 80 322 nautical miles from the Moon. Velocity 3 349 feet per second. The crew is in a meal period at this time and we'don't expect much conversation for some time. Earlier today, while the Lunar Module was being checked out and during a test of simultaneous dual communications capability from Challenger and America, a portion of the conversation was lost due to a communication line configuration in the Public Affairs distribution system. We have now obtained tape of this lost conversation from the Air/Ground recorders in the Control Center and will play that for you now.

Here in the Control Room, flight director Gene Kranz and his white team are preparing to relieve the orange team which has been directed tonight by flight director Chuck Lewis. Major activities during this shift have been the heat flow and convection demonstration which has been performed twice during this shift. Once, while the spacecraft was nulled in all three axes and again after the passive thermal control spinup mode had been established. That demonstration is to provide data on behavior of fluids in a low gravity field and the information learned from the demonstration could be valuable in the future science experiments and perhaps for manufacturing processes in space. The crew is in its presleep checklist at the present time and we have a - again a new update on the S-IVB impact just provided by the flight dynamics officer updates impact time to 86 hours 59 minutes 38 seconds at

048:52|PAO|At the present time in Mission Control, Flight Director Gene Kranz is going around the room polling each of his Flight Controllers on the mission status and all the reports are coming up very good. The orbital science officer said that the temperatures in the SIMBAY where the various scientific instruments will be used in Lunar orbit to observe the Moon from orbit appear to be about as would be expected at this time. During the previous shift the film in the panoramic and mapping cameras was cycled and this is done once every 24 hours if the cameras are not used, to prevent the pressure points on the film in the transport mechanism from creating striations in the film emulsion, and those cameras are cycled ahead several frames to move that pressure point around on the film emulsion. During Lunar molule housekeeping when the crew entered the LM on the previous shift, everything looked to be in order in that vehicle. And the guidance and control officer reports that the midcourse correction maneuver performed earlier in the day — was very close to nominal. Also, the command module is running a bit ahead of the flight plan schedule as far as reaction control system propellent usage and service propulsion system propellent usage and we have a bit more than predicted for this point in the flight. And the Electrical Environmental Communications Officer, EECOM, said that in general the command module -the command and service module appear to be in very good shape. Apollo 17, at this time, is 75 975 nautical miles from the Moon and we're showing a velocity with respect to the Moon of 3325 feet per second. we'don't anticipate any further conversation with the crew, having said "goodnight" to them - and we are planning to give them an additional 30 minutes on their rest period if they so desire. The rest period, according to the flight plan, is scheduled to end at a ground elapsed time of 56 hours. However, we'do not plan to put in a call to the crew until 56 hours 30 minutes, giving them the option to sleep an additional 30 minutes if they so desire. We showed at 48 hours 38 minutes, or about 23 minutes ago, that they had turned off the voice sub-carriers indicating that they were preparing to bed down and get to sleep. During this sleep shift we'll plan to have the air-to-ground lines down to minimize the amount of noise on these circuits. we'll be recording any conversation with the crew and will be prepared to bring the lines up in very short order should we have any calls from the crew. At 49 hours 2 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.

049:57|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 49 hours 57 minutes. It's been nearly an hour and a half since we said goodnight to the crew and there's been no change in the status of the spacecraft or operations here in the Control Center. Everything's progressing along very smoothly at this point. we'don't expect to put in a call to the crew until 56 hours 30 minutes ground elapsed time or about 6 and a half hours from now. Apollo 17 is now 74 098 nautical miles from the Moon and the spacecraft velocity is 3 317 feet per second with respect to the Moon. The flight dynamics officer has the option of setting up the display which gives us the velocity of the spacecraft and its distance relative to either the Moon or the Earth. His option is to look at the spacecraft position and velocity with respect to the Moon or to Earth. At the present time, we are looking at those parameters with respect to the Moon. The large display plot up on the large 10 by 20 foot describing plotter display at the front of the Control Center shows us that the spacecraft is now 'approaching 160 000 nautical miles from Earth.

068:03|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 68 hours 7 minutes. ALFMED is Apollo Light Flash Moving
|PAO|That's the Apollo Light Flash Moving Emulsion Detector, associated with the visual light flash phenomenon that most crews have reported on past missions, seeing points of light in their eyes, when their eyes were closed. There are a couple of theories proposed on the origin of the flashes. One is that they are caused by cosmic rays. The other is that they are high energy atomic particles which enter the eyeball or ionize upon collision with retina or cerebral cortex. The ALFMED is an emulsion plate device that Ron Evans will wear. It will cover the front and sides of his head and will provide information on time, strength and path of particles penetrating the emulsion plates. The other two crewmen will wear eye shields. This test will last for approximately an hour. And the data on the, recorded by the ALFMED device will be correlated with the crewmen's verbal reports on flash observations.

On Monday 80 foreign students who are touring space research science centers in the United States will begin a three day visit here at the Manned Spacecraft Center. They will observe the three periods of lunar exploration by astronauts Cernan and Schmitt and will also tour the facilities at MSC. This International youth tour began December 2 in Washington D. C. and is being conducted under the auspices of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration with the cooperation of the state department. The student group saw the Apollo 17 launch at Cape Kennedy and since that time have toured the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Oakridge National Laboratory facilities in Tennessee. Today they're at the NASA Marshall Spaceflight Center in Huntsville, Alabama tomorrow they will tour the National Oceantic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Bureau of Standards in Bouider, Colorado. The students were selected by their respective governments in response to a NASA invitation, and they range in age from 15 to 17 years and rank high academically and have strong scientific interests. Following their visit to Houston the group will tour the NASA Ames Research Center at Moffitt Field, California and the jet propulsion laboratory in Pasadena, California. Schedules for the visit here at MSC and a complete list of the participating students, and countries may be obtained at the MSC news center. At 71 hours 5 minutes this is mission control, Houston.

Gene Kranz and the white team of flight controllers are preparing to take over duties in the Mission Control Center, relieving the orange team which has been directed tonight by Chuck Lewis. This has been a relatively quiet shift. A major activity was the medical experiment to gather more information on light flashes that most Apollo crews have seen with their eyes closed.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 75:37 CST 0030 MC 294/1
075:37|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 75 hours 37 minutes. Flight director Gene Kranz and the oncoming white team of flight controllers have been going over the status of the mission and find everything progressing very smoothly at this point. There are no anomalies in the performance of the spacecraft. All systems in very good shape and we're either up to or slightly ahead of the flight plan values on consumables at this point. During the shift a number of the flight controllers will begin working on some of the data the crew will use on awakening to place the spacecraft in lunar orbit, that event scheduled to occur at about 88 hours 56 minutes, and the retrofire officer and the flight dynamics officer will be busy during this shift working out some of the preliminary numbers that'll be used in the lunar orbit insertion maneuver. There is still no decision as to whether or not midcourse correction 4 will need to be performed and we suspect that that decision will also be made later on during this shift. At the present time Apollo 17 is

Now about 4 - 1/2 hours away from the scheduled crew awakening time, the flight surgeon reports that the crew appears to be resting comfortably at this time. Command Module Pilot Ron Evans is wearing the biomedical harness during this sleep period. And Commander Gene Cernan has the watch wearing the headset that would receive any call from the control center. Apollo 17 is 27 178 nautical miles from the Moon.

078:37|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 78 hours 37 minutes. There's been no change in the spacecraft status during the past hour. Everything continues to function normally and we have about two and one half hours remaining in the crew's sleep period. The flight dynamics officer reports that we've got a midcourse correction if it's performed prior to Lunar Orbit Insertion of about one half foot per second or less and that very small maneauver, if performed, would occur at 83 hours 55 minutes. Apollo 17 is now 23 112 nautical miles from the Moon and the spacecraft velocity up to 3 460 feet per second. We'll see that increase to somewhat in excess of 80 000 feet per second as the spacecraft reaches the Moon and swings around the Moon goes into orbit. The Lunar Orbit Insertion Burn removes on the order of 3 000 feet per second from that velocity. A lunar orbital velocity of about 1 mile per second. The flight surgeon has noted some stirrings of a bit of an elevation in the heart rate of Ron Evans, who is wearing the bio-medical sensors during this sleep period, although for the most part Evans has been sleeping soundly. At 78 hours 39 minutes, this Apollo Control, Houston.

079:37|PAO|This is Apollo control at 79 hours 37 minutes. Now about an hour and 1/2 away from the scheduled time for crew awakening. And it has again been very uneventful, very quiet sleep shift. With the flight controllers here in mission control monitoring spacecraft systems. Everything continuing to perform almost perfectly as planned; everything nominal. And our flight dynamics display at the present time is showing the spacecraft distance related to Earth, Apollo 17 now 198 .800 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a speed again with respect to Earth of 2168 feet per second. After awakening the crew's major activities during the day include jettisoning the scientific instrument module door which exposes the scientific instruments in the spacecraft's service module to the lunar environment. Lunar orbit insertion is scheduled to occur at about 88 hours 56 minutes. The Saturn third stage will be impacting the lunar surface. And there's still a possibility of a final midcourse correction prior to lunar orbit insertion. That midcourse correction to occur - if it occurs at 83 hours 55 minutes. And we expect that we will have a decision or recommendation from the flight dynamics officer within the next couple of hours as to whether or not that midcourse correction will be required. If it is done, it will be a very small maneuver performed with the reaction control system thrusters on the CSM.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 GET 81:25 CST 06:18 MC 300/1
081:25|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 81 hours 25 minutes. We are planning to put a call through to the crew in about 5 minutes to awaken them and Apollo 17, at this time, is about 17 350 nautical miles from the Moon. Spacecraft velocity is about 3567 feet per second. After awakening the crew we will be discussing a minor problem that has been noted during the sleep period. This involves a heater cycling in one of the three cryogenic hydrogen tanks that supplies hydrogen to the fuel cells. The nature of the problem is a heater that is cycling more often than normal. These heaters are controlled by a^ ^ pressure-sensitive switch on the tank as the temperature within the tank drops and the pressure drops. The switch senses this and activates the heater to bring up the temperature and hence the pressure within the tank and ensure a constant flow of ^ hydrogen to the fuel cells. The sensor appears to be responding to a much narrower range of temperature decrease that would normally respond to about a 20 degree excursion in temperature and it is now apparently responding to about a 2 to 3 degree temperature excursion, and therefore cycling more rapidly than would normally be the'case. This in itself is of no concern, however if the automatic cycling should fail, if the automatic cycling function should fail, it would require going to a backup manual mode whereby the crew would be instructed to turn the heaters on and off at certain intervals to maintain the proper pressure in the tank, which, by the way, is a mode of operation that has been used on previous missions, and works very well with a minimum impact to the crew time. And, as mentioned at this point we would see no reason for having to go to a manual mode. That would require some subsequent failure. This situation, however, will be discussed with the crew and they'll be advised as to the procedure that would be taken in the event that subsequent failure should occur necessitating the manual activation of the heater within this one tank. And we are now about 1 minute 50 seconds away from the scheduled awakening time, having given the crew an additional 30 minutes of sleep. The flight dynamics officer expects to give us a GO or NO/GO for the midcourse correction prior to lunar orbit insertion in about a half an hour at some 82 hours ground olapsod time. We'll continue to stand by live for that call to the crew .

Apollo 17 now 14 thousand 948 nautical miles from the Moon and CAPCOM, Bob Parker, just advising the crew that we will not require a midcourse correction prior to lunar orbit insertion. The flight dynamics officer had been reviewing tracking data and establishing another vector, as he calls it, on the trajectory based on that last vector and it appeared that a midcourse correction of something less than a half of foot per second would be required, if performed. And flight director, Gene Kranz, made the decision to cancel the midcourse correction prior to lunar orbit insertion.

099:16|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 99 hours 16 minutes. We are about 1 minute from reacquiring Apollo 17 now in its 6th revolution of the Moon. We said goodnight to the crew on the last revolution at 97 hours 47 minutes and the flight surgeon reported that it appeared Jack and Ron were both dozing off before we lost radio contact with the spacecraft as it went around behind the Moon on the fifth revolution. Here in Mission Control, flight director Gene Kranz has been reviewing the status of the mission with his oncoming team of flight controllers. No problems of note to be reported. The service propulsion system engine, it was reported, looks to be in very good shape as a result of the, or based on the data received during the LOI and DOI, the lunar orbit insertion and descent orbit insertion maneuvers performed earlier. The flight dynamics officer, during this shift, is going to be following the spacecraft trajectorys very closely looking for any cross range or down range errors which would need to be compensated for prior to the lunar landing.

We have about 6 hours 22 minutes remaining in this sleep period before the crew awakens to a very busy day which will include landing on the Moon for the Lunar Module Crew, Jack Schmitt and Gene Cernan and the first Lunar Surface EVA. Shortly before loosing radio contact Gene Crans checked with each of his flight controllers, got a report that everything was in order, no problems as Apollo 17 went behind the Moon. We'll be reacquiring the spacecraft in its seventh revolution in a little less than 45 minutes. At 100 hours 23 minutes this is Apollo Control,

103:03|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 103 hours 4 minutes. We're standing by now to re-establish radio contact with Apollo 17 as the spacecraft comes around the eastern rim of the Moon and reappears on the front side in it's eighth revolution of the Moon. The crew now, a little more than 5 hours into their sleep period, about 2 hours 40 minutes remaining before we send them the wakeup call. And all spacecraft systems continue to perforin normally. No outstanding problems at this time. We are showing Apollo 17 in an orbit of about 59 by 13 nautical miles, and we should be seeing telemetry data shortly now. Radio from the spacecraft being received at the 210 foot dish antenna at Honeysuckle Creek, Australia, near Canberra. And we're once again receiving data from the spacecraft. We, of course, do not expect any activity from the crew and we'll have the lines down during this front side pass, should there be any unexpected conversations we'11 bring up the lines immediately. We'll have about 1 hour and 5 minutes before Apollo 17 disappears around the back side of the Moon on the eighth revolution.

We're about 5 minutes away, now, from putting in a call to the crew getting them up for breakfast and ready to start a day that will culminate with landing on the lunar surface and the first EVA at the Taurus Mountain site, Taurus Littrow, near the Sea of Serenity. CAPCOM, Joe Allen, will be putting in a call to the crew in about four and one half minutes from now and we'll stand by for that wakeup call to the crew of Apollo 17. Here in the control center the landing shift, landing team of flight controllers, is beginning to come on duty, after a very quiet uneventful night monitoring Apollo 17 in lunar orbit. The spacecraft now on it's nineth revolution of the Moon completing the front side pass and we'll be losing contact with the command module as it goes behind the Moon on the nineth revolution in about 22 minutes.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 6:49 GET 105:56 MC 378/1
105:56|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've now had loss of signal as Apollo 17 goes behind the Moon on the ninth revolution. We'll be reacquiring in about 45 minutes - a little bit less, as the spacecraft comes back on the front side on the tenth revolution. And by that time the crew should have completed breakfast. They'll be getting the pressure suit unstowed and begin preparations for entering the lunar module, for the separation landing on the lunar surface, and the first EVA all scheduled to occur this day. The IR data which Joe Allen advised the crew we're getting in such good form back here on the ground from the spacecraft's service module, is from the IR scanning radiometer.

||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 08:47 CST 107:54 GET MC-385/1
107:54|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 107:59 ground elapsed time into the mission of Apollo 17. We've had loss of signal at this time as Apollo 17 coasted behind the Moon on the tenth lunar orbit. Approximately 47 minutes until the spacecraft both come around the far side as the crew prepares to transfer into the lunar module; that is, Cernan and Schmitt prepare to transfer into the lunar module. Get it powered up in preparation for today's activities of the descent orbit insertion maneuver number 2 and ultimately the landing at Taurus-Littrow and the first extravehicular activity. As they come around the Moon on the eleventh revolution, they will have checked out the lunar module with a few exceptions such as they will deploy the landing gear after acquistion of signal. Also at that time, both spacecraft, Challenger and America, though still docked, will be on separate air to ground links. The lunar module will be on the normal channel; the command service module link, with Ron Evans, will be piped into Room 161 in the News Center building for those newsmen covering the mission who prefer to listen to the command service module orbital science activities. As Apollo 17 went behind the western limb of the Moon, the orbit measured 12 nautical miles at pericynthion and 60.2 at apocynthion. Some maneuvers coming up - the next major maneuver for the lunar module will be the descent orbit insertion number 2 which at this time is predicted, or is calculated to take place at a ground elapsed time of 112 hours 1 minute 59.1 seconds. Total burn time of 21.8 seconds. For a Delta V or velocity change of 7.6 feet per second, which will change the orbit to an apocynthion of 60.4 nautical miles and a pe ri cy n thion j or nearest approach, which is just uprange of the landing site, of 6.7 nautical miles.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12711/72 08:47 CST 107:54 GET MC-385/2
107:54|PAO|The big maneuver of the day, of course, is powered descent and landing, which at this time is calculated to take place at a ground elapsed time of 112 hours 49 minutes 27 seconds, lasting 11 minutes and 57 seconds, plus whatever hover time is available as they get down to the landing site.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST9:38 GET108:45 386/1
008:45|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 108 hours 44 minutes ground elapsed time. Less than 2 minutes away from acquisition as America and Challenger, the spacecraft of Apollo 17, come around from behind the Moon on lunar orbit number 11. At that time the voice downlinks from both spacecrafts will be separated. For those, newsmen in Houston, who wish to listen to the voice from Ron Evans in the command service module, this will be available in room 161 in the Newscenter Office Wing. At the time the spacecraft reappears from behind the Moon, the crew should have completed most of the lunar module checkout procedures, and be prepared for deploying the landing gear, and a series of communication checks with the ground. Just before loss of signal on the eleventh revolution, the crew will be given a GO NO-GO for undocking and separation, which will take place during the time when the spacecraft is behind the Moon near the end of revolution number 11. In other words, when they reappear again, they will be flying separately on the twelfth revolution. We should have acquisition any moment, now, we've counted down to zero on the acquisition of signal clocks here in the Control Center. It takes a few seconds for the ground to lock up solidly with the downlink signal with the spacecraft. Network reports acquisition of signal, let's bring up the line and listen for the first call.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 10:40 GET 109:47 MC-392/2
109:47|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had LOS of signal as America and Challenger pass behind the Moon on the -toward the end of the 11th Lunar Orbit. When they reappear again approximately 47 minutes, they will be undocked. Station keeping flying along adjacent to each other. At LOS of signal the orbit measured 61.2 nautical miles pericynthion by 12 miles even nautical - pericynthion. Velocity at that time was 5315 feet per second. During the next front-side pass, as the Challenger continues in preparations for the descent orbit insertion we'll have a checkout of the descent propulsion system. The tanks will be pressurized and telemetry readouts here on the ground will be prepared to those on board, to make sure that, that system is preforming as advertised. An alignment - realignment of the inertial measuring unit, part of the lunar module's guidance system will be run during that - also during that frontside pass. And toward the end of the 12th revolution, just prior to LOS of signal the crew aboard Challanger will be given a GO/NO-GO for the Descent Orbit Insertion Maneuver //2, which is at this time still scheduled for a ground elapsed time of 112 hours 1 minute 59 seconds. There's a carton of book matches on top of the flight di re c t o r-c on s o 1 e here In the Control Center which was bought by a group of flight dynamics officers on all the ships. Bill Boone, Jay Green, Jerry Bostick and others. It's a blue match cover, it says The Trench. Traditionally the trench is the front row here in the Control Center where the flight dynamics people operate. It says on the front The Trench, Mission Control Center, Houston.

110:39|PAO|This is Apollo Control. One hundred ten hours, 39 minutes ground elapsed time in the mission of Apollo 17. Less than 2 minutes remaining now until America and Challenger separated and flying a few feet apart at this time will come around the front side of the Moon on the 12th lunar orbit. Slightly over a minute now until we should start attempting to lock up on the downlink signal from America and Challenger. The two way communications from spacecraft communicator for the command-service module, Ken Mattingly, and Ron Evans aboard America will be on a separate loop as it was the last revolution. These conversations can be heard in room 161 in the Houston News Center. Early in this revolution we'll have the pressurization of the descent propulsion system and checkout of that system. Some 6-5 seconds from acquisition we'll stand by until Network advises the Flight Director that they do have firm lock on. We have AOS in lunar module, let's see what we h ear.

111:47|PAO|This is Apollo Control, we've had loss of signal as America and Challenger coasting along near-by each other, passed behind the Moon on revolution number 12. Some 47 minutes until they come back around again, on the 13th lunar revolution. Behind the Moon this time, the command/service module piloted by Ron Evans will do CSM circularization maneuver which will place the spacecraft back up into an almost circular lunar orbit, measuring 69.7 by 54.5, those are the targeted measurements of that orbit. Ignition time, again which will be behind the Moon and out of contact is ground elapsed time of 111:57:28. The lunar module DOI, or descent orbit insertion burn number 2 also will be behind the Moon before we reacquire the spacecraft. That is scheduled for 112 hours 2 minutes 40 seconds. It's a fairly small burn 7.6 feet per second which will lower the pericynthion of the Challenger down to 6 1/2 miles - nautical miles with apocynthion staying at 61.5 nautical miles. During the next front side pass, comes the moment of truth with powered descent, and touchdown at Taurus-Littrow landing site as Challenger lights off the big descent engine at 112 hours 49 minutes, 52 seconds ground elapsed time. The ignition countdown clock in the control center is counting down to PDI some 59 minutes 17 - 16 seconds until ignition with landing shortly under 12 minutes later, depending on the amount of hover time available. The broadcast line will be brought up again just prior to acquisition of signal as America and Challenger come around on the front side again on revolution 13, and at 111 hours 51 minutes, this is Apollo Control.

But, as of now, we're saying the landing point is 20 degrees 9 minutes 50 seconds north, 30 degrees 46 minutes
|PAO|It's estimated that the lunar module, Challen ger, is on the planned north south line and approximately 1 to 200 meters east of the planned landing point.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 115 hours 18 minutes. We want to distinguish between the targeted landing point and the planned landing point. It had been the crew's intention all along to land approximately 200 meters east or short of the targeted landing point, the point at which the computer was targeting the Challenger. So, we believe that Challenger is approximately 300 meters east of the targeted landing point, which would put it about 100 to 200 meters east of the planned landing point.

During the EVA, Evans was primarily involved with running the lunar sounder experiment. This was one of the major activities aboard the command module. That experiment appeared to be functioning well, obtaining surface and sub-surface data on the lunar stratigraphic sequences and structure. We have a change of shift briefing, which will begin in a little less than 15 minutes in the News Center Briefing Room, Building 1.

Aboard Challenger on the lunar surface, Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt will now be involved in getting out of their space suits, getting the spacecraft cleaned up, ready for their sleep period and we expect to debrief them on the first EVA in about 15 minutes. Ron Evans now entering his scheduled rest period. America in the 19th revolution of th = Moon at the present time.

However, there is a fair amount of pad built into the Flight Plan during this period, up through the eat period and beginning with their sleep period, and we'do expect to get them to bed on time. We also earlier, got a report from them on weights — sample weights in sample collection bag number 2 and also in the sample return container, the rock box that was brought back aboard the lunar module. They reported 16 pounds for the sample collection bag, 32 pounds for the rock box. These are the gross weights, and we'll be coming up with net weights based on the estimated weight of the containers and other equipment. They are usually packing equipment stowed on the rock boxes. As soon as; we have a net weight for the samples we'll be passing that along. The next activity scheduled in the Flight Plan is the EVA debriefing and we expect that that will be occuring in the next 30 to 45 minutes.

We're estimating that they'll reach that point in the Flight Plan at about 126 hours 10 minutes. And, the debriefing will run 15 to 20 minutes. Ron Evans aboard America has been asleep now for about an hour and a half. We'll be waking him up at the ground elapsed time of 131 hours 20 minutes after about 8 hours of rest. America is presently in an orbit of 69.9 by 53.5 nautical miles, on the backside of the Moon in its 19th revolution, just about to cross over to the 20th revolution the beginning the 20th revolution, and we'll be reacquiring contact with that spacecraft in about 30 minutes.

Among the things in the checklist that they have done is to turn off the power amplifier which accounts for the somewhat noisier communications that we're getting. This is a normal presleep configuration and we'don't expect to be communicating with the crew a great deal in the next hour and of course, none while they're in their sleep period. As you heard in the last exchange between capcom Joe Allen and Gene Cernan the crew will probably be getting the sleep period about one hour later than the flight plan calls for.

149:11|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 149 hours 11 minutes. During the change of shift press briefing the major activity aboard Challenger on the lunar surface and here in mission control has been to get the spacecraft in the proper configuration for the crew to begin their eight hour sleep period. The crew reported and we confirmed through telemetry here on the ground that the spacecraft cabin pressure had come up just a little bit above what we would normally expect — normally runs around 5 pounds per square inch. And we're seeing a pressure of about 3/4 of a pound higher than that about 5.73 pounds per square inch. This is not particularly unusual. we'did see a pressure rise following rep ressurization after the first EVA where the cabin pressure came up somewhat above normal. The pressure relief valve in the cabin would operate at about 5.83 pounds per square inch. In the taped conversations with the crew that we obtained during the change of shift briefing, you'll hear some conversation about the cabin pressure and some instructions to the crew to have them looking for any sources in the cabin that might be putting extra oxygen into the cabin such as the PLSS fill valves that might not have been closed fully or something like that. At this point the cabin pressure has stabilized it looks like and we've found nothing amiss. We'll replay the tape conversation for you and then standby live.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 02:13 GET 149:21 MC-600/2
149:21|PAO|This is Apollo Control, that completes our tape playback. We're standing by live now. And the LM Cabin pressure reading at this time 5.77 pounds per square inch. There's no particular concern over the higher than normal cabin pressure. However, it is something we'don't understand at the present time. Now, there are a number of limited sources of oxygen that can be getting into the cabin to raise the pressure. And, as Joe Allen mentioned to the crew, there's not much chance that anything is leaking in from the outside. We've been systematically checking 1 by 1 the potential sources of the oxygen flow into the cabin. And at some point, if all of the potential sources are eliminated, we begin to reach the conclusion that perhaps the sensor is at fault. However, at this point, it's not possible to say what the - what the cause of the slightly higher than normal LM cabin and pressure
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 02:23 CST 149:31 GET MC-601/1
149:31|PAO|The demand regulators which Joe Allen was describing to the crew and suggesting that they might be the source of the small oxygen leak into the cabin are used to control the flow of oxygen from the storage tanks in the lunar module to the cabin. The procedure that we're going to follow here is to let the cabin pressure continue to drop.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The crew aboard Challenger, Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt running about 2 hours behind in their presleep preparations at this time. And, we'do expect to give them a full 8 hour rest period, which would mean that we will have a slip In the start of EVA 3, probably somewhere an hour and 2 hours. We won't be able to pin that exact start time down until sometime after the crew has gotten to sleep, and we see how their sleep period is working out, but again 1 to 2 hours delay in the start of EVA 3 looks likely at this time.

All of these things could have contributed to causing the pressure rise that we saw and it may well turn out that neither of the regulators has any problem. In the event that there is a small leak in one of the two regulators the Lunar Module functions perfectly well, the cabin atmosphere would be maintained perfectly well with one regulator and the procedure would be to simply shut down the regulator that was leaking. It, of course, could be brought back on line if needed and would perform it's function. And it still appears that we are approximately

152:15|PAO|would move the start time for the EVA 3 back 1 hour. We'll be getting conformation on that shortly. And both the CSM and the lunar module continuing to perform almost perfectly as planned.

America now on its 33 revolution of the Moon. And Ron Evans well into his scheduled 8 hour sleep period. Evans is right on the planned time for sleep. Sleeping right on the - on the flight plan times. During the sleep period we'll have the air-to-ground lines down. Normally that circuit gets rather noisy after the crew's gone to sleep - configured the lunar module to sleep. The power amplifier is turned off, the transmitter output power of the lunar module decreased from about 18 watts down to about 1 watt and that accounts for the noise that we frequently have on that circuit during sleep periods.

During the just completed front side pass the Command Module Pilot Ron Evans completed the lunar orbit plain change maneuver which went nominally on time with velocity change of 366 feet per second using the service propulsion system engine. Just prior to that before he appeared on the front side of the Moon a small trim maneuver was performed using the forward firing reaction control system thrusters. This maneuver was to trim up the orbit. Some dispurs ions that had grown during the lunar orbit period that America has been in motion about the Moon. The Gold Team of Flight Controllers is handing over at the moment to their replacements after about a 12-hour shift. The oncoming team is the White Team of Flight Controllers headed up by Eugene Krantz.

||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 13:14 GET 184:21 MC735/1
184:21|PAO|This is Apollo Control with 184 hours 32 minutes. Jack Schmitt and Gene Cernan aboard Challenger on the Lunar Surface at the present time, are going through the platform alignment getting their guidance & navigation equipment ready for Lunar liftoff. They will also shortly begin doning their pressure suits. And they appear to be running about 30 minutes behind the timeline, however, we expect they will have adequate opportunity to make up the lost time prior to a Lunar liftoff. And, we're looking for liftoff to occur pretty much on time at 188 hours 1 minute 44 seconds ground elapsed time. This is actually about 1 minute, 10 seconds earlier than the preflight plan with the difference caused by the fact that the Command Module for a period of time, was in a slightly smaller orbit than had been planned premission. With the plane-change and orbit circulation maneuver performed a few hours ago by the Command Module, that orbit is now back on the planned trajectory. However, because of the smaller orbit, the CSM was in for a period of time, the liftoff time of the LM has had to be moved up 1 hour 1 minute 10 seconds, to put the LM in the proper position with respect to the Command Module, for their rendezvous.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 13:14 GET 184:21 MC-735/2
184:21|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 184 hours 52 minutes. In about 2 minutes 45 seconds, we'll be losing radio contact with Ron Evans aboard America as the CSM goes behind the Moon on the 49th revolution. At the present time, Evans is in the process of checking out the rendezvous transponder on board his spacecraft, the first in a series of steps he'll be taking to configure the CSM for the rendezvous with the lunar module. Aboard the lunar module, Challenger, on the lunar surface, the team of Cernan and Schmitt will soon begin getting into their space suits, getting the lunar module configured for liftoff, a process, a series of steps which they have already begun. And, everything aboard the lunar module appears to be very close to normal. We are looking at one minor problem, and that concerns the water aboard the descent stage of the lunar module. For some reason, the consumption of water has been a bit greater than was predicted. This water is used primarily, at least the bulk of it, is used for cooling equipment aboard the lunar module. It's boiled into the vacuum of the lunar atmosphere and carries away heat from the electronic equipment in the LM. If we run out of water in the descent stage, .the crew will simply switch over to the reserves of the ascent stage and use those prior to liftoff. Our current prediction is that the descent water will last up through 186 hours 40 minutes, plus or minus 1 hour, so as early as 185 hours 40 minutes, or as late as 187 hours 40 minutes we could run out of water. In the lunar module module descent stage, if we run out early, again the procedure would be to have the crew switch over to the ascent water supply. This again would, in turn, cause no problem. We have adequate reserves in the ascent stage of the LM for a normal or an abnormal rendezvous and docking. And, in about
|PAO|And, we've had loss of signal now with the CSM. Be reacquiring in about 45 minutes. The spacecraft at that time on the 50th revolution of the Moon. We'll continue with the dual line setup communicating with the CSM on one circuit and the lunar module on another circuit through the next revolution, then beginning with acquisition of signal with the command module on the 51st revolution, which is the LM liftoff rev, we'll be switching to a single communication circuit with a single spacecraft communicator. Again, Cernan and Schmitt appear to be running about 30 minutes behind the flight plan timeline, but we expect they'll have adequate opportunity to make up that time before liftoff in a couple of hours. There are places In the flight plan where there Is a bit of a built in pad* and they should have no trouble being ready for an on-time liftoff if things continue to go as smoothly as they are at the present time. Cernan and Schmitt both in good shape for the liftoff. Cernan reported he got about 5 hours of sleep, Schmitt about 6 hours. Both crewmen

184:41|PAO|That last report from Jack Schmitt that he and Gene Cernan were reconfiguring their biomedical switches, harnesses, indicates that they're in the process of getting back into their pressure suits at this time.

185:21|PAO|This is Apollo control at 185 hours 40 minutes. And we're about 45 seconds now from reacquiring the command module on it's 50th revolution of the Moon. During this front side pass Ron Evans aboard America among other things will be performing some land mark tracking using the optics equipment on the command module. This will provide information on the precise orbital plane of the command module that information then to be fed into the lunar module guidance system and used in the targeting of the lunar module for liftoff and subsequent rendezvous with the CSM. On the lunar surface aboard Challenger, Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt have completed suit up. Their in the suits unpressurized without helmets and gloves on at the present time. And appear to be about 20 minutes behind the timeline. They made up about 10 of the 30 minutes they were down and it looks like they will have no problem getting caught up about and hour and 15 minutes before liftoff would liftoff essentially on time.

It looks good through the telemetry we're receiving here on the ground. Also, aboard the spacecraft, the primary guidance and backup guidance system clocks have been synchronized. The next item on the crew's preparation checklist will be to align the platform of their guidance system which is used as a stable attitude reference. And, we're now some 20 minutes from reacquiring the command module, which is now in its 51st revolution of the Moon. And, as mentioned before, when we'do acquire, we'll have both the LM and the command module on the same communication circuit.

If we understand this about the last flight of Apollo then truly we shall have touched a many splendored thing. To Gene Cernan, Jack Schmitt and Ronald Evans we say God speed, and safely back to this good Earth.

188:58|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 188 hours 59 minutes. About 2 minutes 45 seconds ago, Challenger should have performed the terminal phase initiation maneuver that will put the LM on an intersecting trajectory with the Command Module. We would like to recapitulate the lunar liftoff which was nearly normal in all respects. The liftoff occurred at Ground Elapsed Time of 188 hours 1 minute 36 seconds and shut down occurred 7 minutes 20 seconds, both as predicted. The onboard guidance system, the primary guidance system of the LM calculated an initial orbit of 48 by 9 nautical miles. Correction of 50 by 9 nautical miles, and on the ground we calculated an orbit agreeing very closely with that of 48 by 9. The CSM at this time in an orbit 62 nautical miles circular, nearly circular. There was a period of time during the early phase of the liftoff, at pitchover, which occurs at about 10 seconds when we lost tracking data.

189:33|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 189 hours, 34 minutes. We're about 2 minutes now from reacquiring the spacecraft, America and Challenger. At the time we reacquire, the two vehicles should be about 7 miles apart with Challenger behind and below the Command Module, closing at the rate of about 5 feet per second. As they pass out over the front side of the Moon, approaching the landing site at about 190 hours ground elapsed time, they should be in position for docking. And we expect to have television of that event. Docking is unlike some trajectory events not constrained to occur at a specific time, but depends on when the crew feels that they have everything aligned up properly and in a position to move in and dock. But we would expect that we would be fairly close to that time of 190 hours ground elapsed time.
|PAO|And we have a good television picture.

188:53|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 191 hours 34 minutes, about 1 minute away from reacquiring America and Challenger on the 53rd revolution of the Moon. During this front-side pass one of the major activities here in the Control Center and also aboard the spacecraft will be to get the lunar module Challenger properly configured for the LM jettison and the subsequent de-orbit burn that will impact at — into the lunar surface near the landing site at Taurus-Littrow. The Flight Dynamics Officer will be coming up with the numbers that will be programmed into the LM for that de-orbit jettison and subsequent de-orbit maneuver. Right now, we're looking a time for ignition, or rather, a time for separation of the LM of 193 hours 58 minutes, and a LM de-orbit burn at 195 hours 38 minutes 14 seconds. The LM will be jettisoned by severing pyrotechnic bolts that — pyrotechnic charges that in turn sever the connection between the two vehicles. And we have AOS. We'll pick up the live conversation.

The last series of numbers passed up to the crew included the time of ignition for the lunar module deorbit burn. And the parameters that will be fed into the LM guidance system to control that burn.
|PAO|The LM deorbit burn is now scheduled to be performed at ground elapsed time of 195 hours 38 minutes 13 seconds. This will be a 158 second burn, using the reaction control system thrusters on the lunar' module and the burn will be controlled by the lunar module primary guidance and navigation system. With a total Delta V of 286 feet per second.

The Flight Director on this shift is Charles Lewis and our Spacecraft Communicator is Astronaut Gordon Fullerton. Flight Director Chuck Lewis has completed a status review for each of his flight controllers and from all around the room a — reports of everything nominal come back. During this shift two things of interest will be the firing of the explosive charges left on the lunar surface by the astronauts to SS scientists and determining the sub-surface structure. The first of these charges, designated charge No. 6 is scheduled to be detonated at about 212 hours 51 minutes. There is some latitude in this event and because of that we'll have the television camera on the lunar Rover up early to catch the event as - at it's earliest possible occurrence, which would be 212 hours 21 minutes and will leave it up through 213 hours 21 minutes.

Now that question could be answered quite easily if the charge, of course, explodes on command as it's scheduled to at about 212 hours, 51 minutes. And that first charge is 1-pound explosive charge about 1.1 kilometer from the Lunar Rover.

|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've just had a report from ALSEP that one of the bombs went off. we'didn't see it on television, but we are beginning to see some seismic activity and we'll switch now on our television monitor to the seismic tracing, let you — let you look at that.
|PAO|No one here in the Control Center observed on the television the detonation of that charge. However, we are planning to replay the tape from that time and see if a close look at the tape shows any -- any activity that we can see on
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. It's going to take several minutes before we're ready to rerun the video tape of that time segment when the explosive charge detonated. In the meantime, we'll continue with our tape playback leading up to loss of signal with America on the 63rd revolution.

And they will be operating some of the scientific instruments in the scientific instrument module bay the SIM bay. But, relatively little scheduled in the flight plan during this period of time. We show the spacecraft in an orbit of 65.3 nautical miles at its high point, and a low point or pericynthion of 62.4 nautical miles. And, we should have acquisition of signal any second now.

And coming up at about 215 hours 27 minutes, a little less than 1 hour from now, we're scheduled to have the second detonation of an explosive charge on the lunar surface as part of the lunar seismic profiling experiment.

214:56|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 214 hours 56 minutes. In about one minute we'll be commanding the television on the lunar roving vehicle ON and we'll have it positioned to look for this second explosive charge which is going to be fired at about 215 hours and 27 minutes. This charge is part of the lunar seismic profiling experiment.
|PAO|We're about 27 minutes away from the predicted time of detonation. However, we are within the window during which the charge could explode. As we mentioned on the previous charge, this window is brought about by the fact that the timer is a mechanical timer, the firing charges set continuously during the window and as the timer moves across the face of the firing pin, the firing charge going in - the firing command going in continuously fires the charge as the window moves across the pin.
|PAO|And we believe the television camera is now centered on the area where this charge is located. Hopefully the charge is right in the middle of the television s creen.

215:16|PAO|Tbis is Apollo Control now about 1 minute 20 seconds away from reacquiring Apollo 17. It will be on the 65th revolution and we're looking through the lunar rover television camera at the spot on the Moon where we believe the second of two seismic charges to be detonated, is located. we'do have a problem with the TV camera in that it appears to be heating up close to the acceptable limit and it could become necessary to shut the camera down prior to the time we have the detonation. This decision will be based in part on what sort of priorities the scientists have for other things they would like to view with the camera in relation to the detonation of this charge. And the instrumentation communications engineer is keeping a close eye on those temperature readings reports that the temperature has apparently begun to stablize and to maybe even move down a bit, so we maybe out of the woods on that score,
|PAO|And we have acquisition of signal. Should get a good stable lock on shortly which will decrease the noise on the air-to-ground circuit.

The pan camera will be turned on briefly, just so we can get a look at the telemetry data on that camera. We won't be obtaining any photography with it. The mapping camera will be on for one full revolution obtaining ground track coverage supplemented by the laser altimeter data that provides an altitude reference in each photograph. Also the infrared and ultraviolet spectrometers will be operating and the crew will be taking a few hand held photographs out the spacecraft windows, using the Hasselblad camera. We may have a bit of noisy communications toward the beginning of this pass.

And, when once again we hear from the crew, they should be in the midst of eating their last meal in lunar orbit. Everything is in very good shape for the trans-Earth insertion maneuver to be performed at the end of this revolution, and at the beginning of the 76th revolution as they come around the front side of the Moon, they'll be on their way back to Earth. During this front-side pass, we'll be passing up to the crew the final set of numbers that'll be fed into their computer targeting the trans-Earth injection burn. Also, we have the times for acquisition of signal following TEI. With the normal TEI burn, we would expect to acquire signal at 236 hours 55 minutes. If for some reason, the burn is not performed as planned, we would regain radio contact at 239 hours 7 minutes 18 seconds. And, we should have AOS momentarily.
|PAO|I wanted to make one correction to the AOS times there. Without the burn, if the transEarth injection burn is not performed, the acquisition of signal time is 237 hours 7 minutes 18 seconds rather than 239 hours, as we gave you. Again those times. With the burn, 236 hours 55 minutes; without the burn, 237 hours 7 minutes 18 seconds. That would be about 12 minutes 18 seconds later if the burn is not done.

The final set of numbers passed up to the crew to perform the transearth injection burn are very close to those that we had earlier. A couple of very minor changes. The ignition time is 236 hours 42 minutes 8 seconds. That represents a change of one second. The total burn duration remains unchanged essentially at 2 minutes 25 seconds.

236:35|PAO|This will be the second time that we've had a chance to view the lunar far side via television from Apollo mission. The first time occurred on Apollo 10. We were discussing that mission with the Commander of Apollo 10 Gen. Tom Stafford, who's here in the Control Center. Stafford also recalled it being a very spectacular view, as all lunar crews have reported. One thing he did point out is that Apollo 10 had significantly more velocity at transearth injection than Apollo 17 will have. Had a shorter trip time of something like 40 hours for the return compared with about 68 hours for the return time on Apollo 17. This would perhaps cause the Moon to shrink a little less rapidly than we recall it from Apollo 10, but nevertheless, should be a very spectacular sight. The previous crews have described it, the Moon is looking as if you were in a high performance jet aircraft going straight up and the Moon goes from filling the TV screen to shrinking into a discernable sphere A relatively short period of time.

236:35|PAO|get our first report, of it as the crew comes back around on the lunar front side. Comparing this transearth injection maneuver burn with previous burns, it's interesting to observe the Flight Controllers. They're certainly all aware that this is a significant event, leaving the Moon for the final time in the Apollo Program, but the atmosphere here in the Control Center is not much different from previous transearth injection burns that we've observed. Having watched the spacecraft and crew perform this same maneuver flawlessly seven times previously, there's obviously less of the tension that was evident at this time after Apollo 8, when Apollo 8 was preparing to leave the Moon four years ago. We have a number of small clusters of people gathered around in casual conversation and in about 5 or 10 minutes, I'm sure we'll see everyone returning to consoles, getting set to receive that first data from the spacecraft. We're now 12 minutes away from the time at which the crew will be igniting their 20,500 pound thrust service propulsion system engine for 2 minutes and 25 seconds of what* s been described as a rather stiff kick in the tail for the spacecraft.

238:02|PAO|The significance of Capcom Gordon Fuller ton's comment to the crew a few minutes ago that the LCRU had "crumped", as he put it, is that we're no longer able to get television from the lunar surface. The television picture comes back through the Lunar Communications Relay Unit.
|PAO|P52 refers to the rather tricky job of aligning the stable platform, does require a fair amount of practice, and Gene Cernan threatening to take over the job, of course facetiously, if Ron Evans didn't get a good P52 on his first try. This is the stable platform used as a — as an attitude reference by the spacecraft guidance and navigation system.
|PAO|By virtue of the fact that the television is not available to us, we were not able to see the third of the explosive charges fz.red. The seismic data indicates that that charge was fired very close to the planned time at 237 hours 49 minutes 52 seconds.

And, of course, he was referring back to the commander Gene Cernans previous remark that if the P52 did not go properly he would take on the job himself. This, of course, is a task that the command module pilot is most proficient at and has done the most training and preparing for.

The exercise that we've been going through with Ron Evans and the antennas aboard the CSM involve an attempt to extend the second of the two elements of the High-Frequency antenna used in the lunar sounder experiment. Each of these elements is about 34 feet 2 inches long. Both together comprising elements of a single antenna. And, one; of the — one of the elements is extended, and the second is balking at extending. Apparently, due to being cold, and the resistance of pushing the antenna out is heating the motor up. Therefore, we have to turn it on for a period of time until the antenna bogs down and the motor begins to heat, and then turn it off to let the motor cool down.

265:51|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 266 hours 17 minutes. The crew at the present time is establishing the spacecraft in its passive thermal control mode. This is rotating it about 3 revolutions per hour for thermal control which means that they're preparing to get some sleep. Sleep period is scheduled to begin at 267 hours and the PTC or passive thermal control mode is the normal set up for the spacecraft to maintain thermal equalibrium during a sleep period. The crew had reported a possible glitch as they referred to it with the CDU or coupling data unit about an hour ago at 265 hours 7 minutes. We looked in great detail at the telemetry data and replayed data from the time when this glitch occured, and by looking at the data, have confirmed that there is no problem with the coupling data unit, and the guidance and navigation system which it forms a part of. To summarize the sequence of events, Gene Cernan was in the process of loading numbers into the spacecraft computer, telling It to maneuver to the proper attitude for passive thermal control, when he noticed that his eight-ball attitude indicator and his computer attitude readout disagreed. These 2 readouts if everything is as it should be, should be in very close agreement. Noting disagreement there, he advised that there was a possible glitch in the CDU or coupling data unit which feed information from the inertial measurement unit to the computer. The glitch being possibly that the CDU was feeding erroneous information to the computer. If this was in fact the case, the computer knowledge of the spacecraft attitude would become impaired.

At the presen': time in mission control we've got a group of engineers from the crew systems division clustered around the capcom console going over a set of recommended procedures which capcom Gordon Fullerton will be discussing with Ron Evans for fixing his communications carrier the so called Snoopy hat that the crew wears that has the earphones and microphone attachments built In, Evans reported several days ago :hat the comm carrier - communications carrier was intermittant and last night he took it apart looked inside and found that in fact a couple of wires had broken and made a temporary fix. The procedures that we'll be reading up to him are to ensure that so far as possible that the Snoopy hat communications carrier is fixed up to work properly during entry, If for some reason the Snoopy hat carrier couldn't be used Evans would plan to wear the light weight headset using the Snoopy hat to hold it in position but the preferable arrangement during entry would be to have a working comm carrier built into the Snoopy hat. Apollo 17 at this time is 93 270 nautical miles from Earth. And the speed is 5 444 feet per second,

During the night, the Flight Dynamics Officer and the Retro Return to Earth Officer will be compiling their last stretch of tracking data on the spacecraft and computing the final midcourse correction which would be performed at about 3 hours prior to entry. At the present time that midcourse correction would appear to be very small, around 2 feet per second. Apollo 17 at this time about 80 000 miles from Earth and the spacecraft velocity going through 6000 feet per second and we'll see an ever more rapid buildup in that velocity as the spacecraft nears Earth.
