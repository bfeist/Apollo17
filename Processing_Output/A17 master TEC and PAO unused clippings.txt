|041:18:05|LMP|Hello, Houston, America. How do you read?
|041:06:00|CC||America, this is Houston. Over.

|041:18:03|CC|Challenger, this is Houston. You're loud and clear, although we have a lot of background noise. Not sure whether that's getting through. Do you know if Ron is still on VOX?
|041:18:03|CC|America, this is Houston. Over.
|041:18:03|SC|Okay. Stand by, and Challenger is going to give you a call on S-band, and VHF checks are both GO on A and B.
|041:18:03|CC|I think I side marked on Challenger. We are getting some data. We'll stand by for another check.
|041:19:21|CMP|Do you acknowledge that?
|041:19:21|LMP|I heard him the first time.
|041:19:21|CDR|Okay. ... me get S-band in
|041:19:29|LMP|Okay, Houston; this is Challenger. Counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 How do you read?
|041:19:29|CC|Challenger, Houston. You're loud and clear, with the background noise.
|041:19:29|LMP|They don't have a good up-link, Gene. I - I had signal strength. And now I don't have any at all.
|041:19:29|CDR|Okay. Houston, Challenger.
|041:19:29|LMP|There it is. Now I do; 2.2.
|041:19:29|CDR|Okay.
|041:19:29|LMP|Tell them I heard their transmission to you.

|041:20:34|LMP|I was at zero signal strength, and I heard their transmission ... One of them. The first time they acknowledged that your - that I was going to do it.
|041:20:34|LMP|Did you shift my hose back? Oh,

|042:21:25|CT|You going back to air-to-ground 1?
|042:21:32|CMP|Okay. I heard somebody go to air-to-ground 1 that time, and -

|108:10:20|CC|America, can you verify that you gave us NARROW on the HIGH GAIN?
|108:10:20|CMP|Houston, America. Say again.
|108:10:20|CC|Could you verify that you gave us NARROW on the HIGH GAIN ANTENNA, please?
|108:10:20|CMP|Negative, I gave you WIDE. (Laughter) I'll give you NARROW now.
|108:10:20|CC|Okay. I - I asked for WIDE awhile back, and guess we missed the call there.
|108:10:20|CC|Got your eyeball in that telescope?
|108:10:20|CMP|I'm about to.
|108:12:24|CMP|Okay, Houston; America. Had 50 percent on mag Charlie Charlie when I changed mags there for the landmark tracking. And let's see, frame 110, I think - or 112 - let me look on that one.
|108:12:24|CMP|Frame 103 on mag 00. Shoot. I mean, pardon the French, (laughter). Okay; go ahead, Challenger. How you guys doing?
|108:12:24|LMP-LM|Hey, Ron, this is ... coming up.
|108:12:24|CMP|Looks like it's pretty low down there.
|108:12:24|LMP-LM|Well, when you're up here looking ...
|108:12:24|CMP|(Laughter) I'll bet.
|108:16:55|CMP|Hey, Challenger; America.
|108:16:55|CC|Okay, America. You're coming up on 3 seconds to T-l.
|108:16:55|CMP|Okay, 3 seconds to T-l. Thank you.
|108:18:26|CMP|Okay, Challenger; America. Good luck on your PDI burn there. I'm going to track your landmark for you.

|108:18:26|CDR-LM|Okay, babe. Have a ...
|108:18:26|CMP|Will do.

|108:18:26|CMP|Yes, I got it, too.
|108:18:26|LMP-LM|Hey, ... We got the landing site; we're coming ...
|108:18:26|CMP|That slide really shows up beautiful.
|108:20:02|CC|Okay. Coining up on 30 seconds to T-2. Expect the AUTO pitch rate, and remember, the good old Sun is going to be staring at you - -
|108:20:02|CMP|Okay.
|108:20:02|CC|- Ñ when you come around.
|108:21:25|CMP|Beautiful results.
|108:21:25|CMP|Blink! There's the Sun in the sextant.
|108:21:25|CMP|Oh, those guys are going to have fun down there.
|108:21:25|CMP|(Laughter)
|108:23:16|CMP|Oh, Houston, I got so excited on that, I forgot to turn the camera On.
|108:23:16|CC|Oh, that's fair? You got any comments to make on any of those marks? They were - they were collecting the marks in real time. Do you have any that they ought to pay particular attention to?
|108:23:16|CMP|Well, let me think for a minute, now. They were all within the crater itself. None of them were outside of the crater. The - the last ones I took at - started taking marks at - beyond what the really time was, just because you could still see it. So I wouldn't put too much faith in those - in about the last four.
|108:23:16|CC|Okay. Sounds good.

|108:26:08|CMP|Okay. TRANSPONDER'S ON now.
|108:26:08|CC|America, sounds like Challenge" is c-t-ill working on their RESET, if you wsnt to go a'asad and get your 52 out of the way vhile you're waiting for the range check. That might save a little time.
|108:26:08|CMP|Okay. I think they're about ready to dc it now. Challenger, America. You about ready fcr a VHF RANGING?
|108:28:51|CMP|Okay. There goes RESET. Now.
|108:28:51|CMP|Ah-ha! It works! Point - 0.50 miles. Okay, 0,50 or 0.49 miles.
|108:30:07|CMP|Okay, I'm going to turn the RANGING, OFF, then. Comm's a little better that way.
|108:33:34|CMP|Okay, Houston, you copying the 93?
|108:33:34|CC|Yes, sir. Talk any time.
|108:33:34|CMP|Okay. We'll talk at 45:13:45.
|108:33:34|CC|Okay.
|108:33:34|CC|And, America; Houston. Have some vectors to send if you give us ACCEPT. And we're standing by with a pad.
|108:35:50|CMP|Okay, Houston; America, ready to copy. Pad's here, and you have ACCEPT.
|108:35:50|CC|Okay. First one will be the circ pad, or> the same page.
|108:35:50|CMP|Okay. Press on.

The ullage is four jets for 12 seconds. Comment on your PC: If you happen to notice the chamber pressure, it'll probably be running 90 to 95, and we're predicting that it'll show you about 6 psi less than what the actual chamber pressure is.
||||Tape 72B/5|Page 550
|108:35:50|CMP|Ah-ha! Okay, that's good to know on that chamber pressure. What you're saying is that even during the LOI burn, the velocity gain and what-have-you was - for chamber pressure, probably up around a little better than 100, huh?
|108:35:50|CC|Yes, sir.
|108:35:50|CC|We've got a couple of transducer problems we'll - -
|108:35:50|CMP|I've got a readback on that circ pad.

|108:35:50|CMP|Okay. Copy that. Hey, while I think about it, on the landmark tracking there in that lower attitude mark, the computer was pointing me - I wish. I knew. I'd have to get a map to look at the name of it, but there I consider Sherlock. And then the one to the south of that, and then another one to the south of that. There are three in a row. And it was pointing to the one just south of Sherlock - one about the same size as 17-1. Okay. A readback on RP-3. T-l, 112:17:01; T-2, 21:51, 23:31, 24:19; be north, 04 miles.

|108:40:55|CMP|Why don't I get started to the VERB 49 attitude, then I'll get the rest of the pads, okay?
|108:40:55|CC|All right, sir. I think that sounds like a good plan.
|108:40:55|CC|And we're through with our up-link, you can go to BLOCK when you want to.
|108:40:55|CMP|...
|108:40:55|CMP|Okay. Got you loud and clear, too.
|108:40:55|CMP|Okay, Houston. Okay. PROCEED. Okay, Challenger and Houston. I'm maneuvering to circ burn attitude - Okay, sure will - Ah-ha! Great!

|109:55:09|CC|Okay. Glad to hear it.
|109:55:09|CMP|And I'll give you some dope here. Okay, it was on time. Burn time, as near as I can tell, was 4 seconds. V was 69-9. Okay. The trim angles (jA were 357, 89, and 4 degrees of yaw. Okay, at the completion of the burn there, the NOUN 85's.
|109:55:09|LMP-LM|Okay, Houston. This is Challenger. How do you read ... LM data?
|109:55:55|CMP|The NOUN 85's were plus 1.70 and a minus 0.6. They are trimmed out to 00 and a plus 0.1. DELTA-was minus 10.0.
|109:55:55|LMP-LM|..., Houston. How do you read Challenger?
|109:55:55|CMP|And I didn't look at that one until 112 plus 00. Oxidizer was 30.3. Fuel was 31.1. And unbalance was minus 200. Over.
|109:55:55|CC|Okay, that sounds good.

|109:55:55|CMP|(Laughter) Okay, Ken; Jack keeps talking every time you do. So maybe you can keep one ear on them or something. I got T-l and 112:50:52; and I think T-2 was 55:42, and that's all I got.

|109:55:55|CC|Okay, America. Are you ready to try again on the P24 pad?
|109:55:55|CMP|Okay. Let's try it now.
|109:55:55|CC|Okay. 17-1: 112:50:52, 55^2, 57:22, 58:10; north 02.

|109:55:55|CC|Okay, that's correct. And you were starting to say something about your RPs - target?
|109:55:55|CMP|Yes. RP-3 is Just about the limit of high Sun angle that you could take to track that thing. I could track it up to TCA. And then, from TCA on across, you could hardly even tell there was a crater there, at all. It's just completely washed out.
|109:55:55|CC|Okay. I'll keep that in mind when they look at it.
|109:55:55|CMP|I think we got some good marks on it anyhow, though.
|109:55:55|CC|Real fine.
|110:00:06|CMP|Also, Houston, I lost the landmark at 24:01 instead of 24:19.
|110:00:06|CC|Okay.
|110:01:14|CC|Okay, America. We've taken one last look around your bird and it's looking good. So at least your half is GO for PDI.
|110:01:14|CMP|Okay, mighty fine. And I think that chamber pressure was up around 95* I really couldn't swear to it. So you might take a look at the read-out on the playback.
|110:01:14|CC|Okay. You got a mighty fast scamp ... to see all that.
|110:01:14|CMP|(Chuckle) That's what I say. I really couldn't swear to it.

|110:35:15|CMP|Okay. You have it.
|110:37:05|CMP|Yes. It1s a good thing it's in the sextant because you can't see it in the telescope. The Earth is in the field of view.
|110:37:05|CC|Are you able to get something in the sextant, or would you like for us to look for some new stars and attitudes?
||||Tape T4B/2|Page 582
|110:37:05|CMP|No. You can see them in the sextant real well, Ken. You just can't see them in the telescope.
|110:37:05|CC|Okay. That's a mighty pretty thing to look at in the telescope, though, isn't it?
|110:37:05|CMP|Yes, it sure is.
|110:37:05|CMP|You know, I noticed there's even a lot of difference in earthshine and - and in the double umbra. You get in earthshine on the thing, and it's - it's hard to see the stars even if you don't have the Earth in there.
|110:37:05|CC|Yes. That - that makes a surprising difference.
|110:37:05|CMP|The double umbra on the back side of the Moon -Yes. The double umbra on the back side of the Moon is even better than the simulator (laughter).
|110:39:36|CMP|Okay. If those look good to you, I'll torque at 20.
|110:39:36|CC|Okay. That looks good.
|110:45:18|CMP|Okay, Houston; this is America. I think I'll go ahead and use a shaft, 200.12, and a 57.470.
|110:45:18|CC|Okay. We copied that.
|110:45:18|CMP|That's for the COAS cal.
|110:45:18|CC|All righty. That thing flies a little better than the simulator on that, doesn't it?
|110:45:18|CMP|Yes. It sure does. It's outstanding, as a matter of fact. You can even see the star out here.
|110:45:18|CC|Yes, it's a rather wondrous thing. When you get around to it, I've got a HYDROGEN tank 1 call. I'd like to have you turn that to OFF.
|110:45:18|CMP|Okay. Let me get started here in the P20 attitude.
|110:45:18|CC|Sure thing.

|110:52:52|CC|Okay. Got my clock running.
|110:52:52|CMP|Okay.
|110:55:01|CMP|Still barber pole.
|110:55:01|CC|Yes. We're commenting on the same thing. We don't have any data yet, but ... - -
|110:55:01|CMP|(Laughter)
|110:55:01|CMP|Hey, it went gray.
|110:56:10|CMP|MARK it.
|110:56:10|CC|Okay. Thank you.
|110:56:10|CMP|About 3 minutes and 20 seconds, wasn't it?
|110:56:10|CC|Yes, sir. 03:21. Okay, Ron. And before we get started this morning, we skipped the Lithium caninter, and that was back at 108 hours and 10 minutes on page 3-109. So, at your convenience, you might want to catch up on that one.
|110:56:10|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. Do you have it handy there? What it is? Which one?
|110:56:10|CC|Yes. Just a second. I'll read it to you.
|110:56:10|CMP|Can you just tell me?
|110:57:00|CC|Okay. We wanted to take 11 into A, and stow number 9È which you're going to take out, into A-9.
|110:57:00|CMP|Into A-9. Okay. That must be where 11 is then.

|110:57:00|CC|Eleven should be in - Yes, okay. Get all of you in A-9 now, hopefully.
|110:57:00|CMP|(Whistling)
|111:01:01|CMP|Okay. The old lithium hydroxide canister's changed.
|111:01:01|CC|Okay. Thank you.
|111:01:01|CMP|And, Ken, can you give me a hack on Houston time there? Or Greenwich mean time or something so I can set my watch?
|111:02:16|CC|Okay. I'll give you Houston time. It's 14:35=21 -2-3-4- 5.
|111:02:16|CMP|Okay. Mighty fine. Thank you.
|111:03:25|CC|Okay, America. We're about 3 minutes from LOS. All systems look good. And G&C has noticed that you've got the OPTICS not in ZERO, and next time you're down that way, it would make everybody feel better if you'd put it there. It's not - not something that you have to do right away.
|111:03:25|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. Will do. Good way to keep me honest.
|111:03:58|CC|And a ... to that.

|111:56:01|CMP|... vent's closed. Okay, Houston. This is America. Looks like we have you for good now.
|111:56:01|CC|Roger. Ron, you're looking great. We need a -words on the spacecraft condition. We got a couple of rockets out at White Sands ready to launch for a UV calibration, and we need the GO from you on that.
|111:56:01|CMP|(Laughter) Yes, I'm great up here. They're not going to try to hit me, are they?
|111:56:01|CC|No, babe. We wouldn't do that. These are a couple of calibration rockets on Aerobee.
|111:56:01|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. Sounds great. Tape motion has stopped, by the way. And I'm ready to charge battery B.
|111:56:01|CC|Roger. That's a GO on that.
|111:56:01|CMP|By the way, battery - Okay - the battery compartment pressure went up to 0.8 after 3 or 4 days here.
|111:56:01|CC|Roger, Ron. We copy that.
|111:57:18|CMP|Okay. BUS TIES are OFF; PYR0 BUS TIES are OPEN. Let's see about BUS A and B. I think those are OPEN. Yes, they're OPEN.

|111:58:24|CMP|Okay. PAN CAMERA POWER is OFF. And - let's see. Is the time for the lunar sounder stuff?
|111:58:24|CC|Got about 3 minutes on that, Ron.
|111:58:24|CMP|Okay.
|111:58:24|CMP|You know, all I did was eat for 3 days. And now I don't even get a chance to eat.
|111:58:24|CC|Roger. You getting hungry?
|111:58:24|CDR|I've had two gingerbread bars and a brownie, so far.
|111:58:24|CC|Yes. We1 re going to keep you busy.
|111:58:24|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. That's good.
|111:58:24|CC|I understand they left you some scissors so you can eat. Huh?
|111:58:24|CMP|Yes, fortunately. I still got them. I even got them tied down this time.
|111:58:24|CC|Roger.
|111:58:24|CMP|Did Challenger figure out where they are? Are they pretty close to - the center of the ellipse?
|111:58:24|CC|They look like they're a couple of hundred meters short, Ron. No problem. They landed in a smooth area. And that's what counted.
|111:58:24|CMP|Oh, that's great.
|112:02:11|CMP|Okay. LUNAR SOUNDER OPERATE is in STANDBY. RECORDER is going ON. RADAR is going ON. RECORDER is gone OFF. OFF to center; not to HEATERS. And the MODE is going to VHF.
|112:02:11|CC|Thank you, Ron. I've got that pan camera photo pad any time you want it.
|112:02:11|CMP|Okay. Let's see, 116:30. Huh?

|112:04:09|CMP|HIGH GAIN to AUTO.
|112:04:09|CMP|And, Houston; America here. I'm ready to do the LUNAR SOUNDER EXTEND test here for a while, if you want. Whenever your ready.
|112:04:09|CC|Roger. Stand by, Ron.
|112:05:40|CC|Okay, America. We're ready for the HF ANTENNA EXTEND test, and, just for your information, White Sands got one of the rockets off. The other one was a NO GO.
|112:05:40|CMP|Oh, okay. Good.
|112:06:02|CMP|Okay. HF ANTENNA 1. Barber pole. 1001, 1002. It's OFF. Gray. Okay; number 1, RETRACT, barber pole. Barber pole? No barber pole. Very interesting.
|112:06:02|CMP|Would you believe number 1 stuck out there?
|112:06:02|CC|Roger, Ron. We're seeing stall current right now.
|112:06:02|CC|Ron, we'd like to go OFF on HF ANTENNA 1. And standby on number 2.
|112:06:02|CMP|Okay; it's OFF, and, of course, it went gray again.
|112:06:02|CC|Roger.
|112:06:02|CMP|You say standby for number 2?
|112:06:02|CC|Stand by on that, Ron. Don't do number 2 yet.
||||Tape 75B/4|Page 608
|112:06:02|CMP|Okay. I won't do it yet.
|112:09:51|CC|America, Houston. We'd like to try ANTENNA 1 again We'd like you to go EXTEND for barber pole plus 3 seconds, then OFF, then RETRACT.
|112:09:51|CMP|Okay. We'll try that. HF number 1, EXTEND. 1001, 1002, 1003. It's OFF. And, of course, I got a barber pole as it was going up. Okay; you want to try RETRACT again?
|112:09:51|CC|That's affirmative.
|112:10:32|CMP|Okay. HF for number 1 to RETRACT, now. And a barber pole.
|112:10:32|CC|Ron, we'd like you to turn it OFF now.
|112:11:14|CMP|Okay; it's OFF, and the talkback is gray.
|112:13:56|CC|Ron, Houston here. On that one, we followed your RETRACT current in for 7 seconds, and then it went into stall; so it apparently is the track -it's retracting normally up to a point, and then goes into stall. We'd like you to press on and do EXTEND on HF ANTENNA 2. And we're going to press on here, probably thinking like maybe we won't get the antennas in. And on ANTENNA 2 - -
|112:13:56|CMP|Okay.
|112:13:56|CC|- - it's - it's according to the Flight Plan, barber pole plus 2 seconds.
|112:13:56|CMP|Okay; we'll go barber pole plus 2.
|112:14:31|CMP|Okay. Number 2, EXTEND. Barber pole 1001, 1002, Off. Okay; number 2 going to RETRACT, now. Barber pole 1001, 1002. Hey! Okay; it went gray - and back to OFF.
|112:14:31|CC|Roger. We copy that.
|112:14:31|CC|Okay, Ron. You're GO for the extending, and just a reminder on the Flight Plan, there's a RECORDER, ON, prior to the EXTEND there.
||||Tape 75B/5|Page 609
|112:14:31|CMP|Oh, okay; that's good.
|112:15:28|CMP|Okay. RECORDER'S going ON. And we'll extend number 1. Let me get the clock going here. Okay; 3, 2, 1 -
|112:15:44|CMP|MARK it.
|112:15:44|CC|Currents are looking good. The extension is looking normal, so far. And the Aerobee rocket had some problem - -
|112:15:44|CMP|Okay; great.
|112:15:44|CC|- - and didn't get a chance to look at the Sun.
|112:15:44|CMP|Uh-oh.
|112:15:44|CC|And they're going to try and launch a couple more the day after tomorrow.
|112:15:44|CMP|Very good.
|112:16:45|CMP|Hey, I think I can see a light spot down there on the landing site where they might have blown off some of that halo stuff.
|112:16:45|CC|Roger. Interesting, interesting comment.
|112:16:45|CMP|It's between Sherlock and Camelot - between -
|112:17:00|CMP|Hey, it's gray now on the number 1 EXTEND.
|112:17:00|CC|Roger. We got it. And we got - we copy it's all the way out down here. You can to go 0EF on that one.
|112:17:08|CMP|Okay; number 2 is going to - it's OFF. And number 2 is going to EXTEND.
|112:17:08|CC|Okay, Ron. The currents look normal on number 2 while it extends.
|112:17:08|CMP|Okay.
|112:18:17|CMP|Hey, I can see number 2.
||||Tape 75B/6|Page 610
|112:18:17|CC|Roger. That's good show. It's going to be moving, Ron.
|112:18:17|CMP|All the way out there. It is?
|112:18:17|CMP|My window's all fogged up here, and can't see a thing.
|112:18:17|CC|Roger.
|112:18:17|CC|Okay, Ron. We show it all the way out - -
|112:18:17|CMP|Fogged up on the ... side ...
|112:18:17|CC|- - so you can go ahead and turn it off.
|112:19:09|CMP|Okay; we'll turn it off.
|112:19:09|CMP|Houston, this is America.
|112:19:09|CC|Go ahead, Ron.
|112:19:09|CMP|I didn't have my map there, but I was looking at the landing site, and as close as I can remember, it had to be somewhere around about DN 83.3 on the 200-meter scale, the TL25-8.
|112:19:09|CC|Okay, Ron. I'm coming up on some Flight Plan operations on the mapping camera that you might want to check.
|112:19:09|CMP|Thank you.
|112:19:09|CMP|Okay.
|112:23:58|CMP|Probably dark down there. MAPPING CAMERA to OFF.
|112:24:49|CMP|Okay; MAPPING CAMERA to STANDBY. LASER ALTIMETER, OFF, IMAGE MOTION, OFF. Barber pole; gray.
|112:25:08|CMP|MAPPING CAMERA to OFF.
|112:26:09|CMP|Let's see. PAN CAMERA SELF TEST, OFF. And it's after sunset. UV, OFF. IR is OFF. DATA SYSTEM is OFF. SM/AC POWER, we're going to get that OFF. SM/AC POWER is OFF. Okay; it looks like 12. LUNAR SOUNDER to OPERATE.
||||Tape 75B/7|Page 611
|112:29:01|CC|America, while we're waiting for this lunar sounder to operate for 2 minutes, could you - could you say again those coordinates you gave us. I dug out the map TL 25-8, and I got the 83-3, but what was the azimuth coordinate on that, Ron?
|112:29:01|CMP|It was Dog November, and maybe just a little bit to the right of Dog November.
|112:29:01|CC|Okay; Dog November. Thank you. And you think that's where they are, huh?
|112:29:01|CMP|Yes.
|112:29:01|CC|Okay.
|112:29:01|CMP|Well, there's the - there's a real white spot down there, you know. And I didn't have - I only got a short - I only got a look at that thing for about 30 seconds before I had to so something else. But I'm just re - re - recalling in my mind where the - where the white spot is with respect to those - there's Camelot and there's Sherlock, and them from Camelot to Sherlock, there were two other craters, and they were just a little bit closer to Camelot, but between those two other craters there.
|112:29:01|CC|Good show. Roger.
|112:29:01|CMP|There's a white spot - yes, there's a white spot on the - like it might have been dust blowing or something, you know.
|112:29:01|CC|Roger. That may be the - the rocket exhaust. It might be just a little off that light spot.
|112:29:01|CMP|Yes.
|112:29:01|CC|Okay, Ron. We're ready for LUNAR SOUNDER, OPERATE to OPERATE. And if you'll give me a mark, I'll time it out for you.

|112:48:04|CMP|Boy, you talk about night flying, this is the kind of night flying you want to do, by the full Earth.
|112:48:04|CC|Is that right?
|112:48:04|CMP|Beautiful out there.
|112:50:04|CMP|Okay. It went to STANDBY at 30.

|112:51:08|CMP|Okay. Are you going to try to pull that antenna back in first before we completely change the Flight Plan?
|112:51:08|CC|Ron, we're going to take a good hard look at that, and see if we can generate up either a test on that or what. That's kind of in limbo right now, Ron. These Flight Plan changes - -
|112:51:08|CMP|Oh, okay.
|112:51:08|CC|- - these Flight Plan changes I've got for you coming up later will be all some items Farouk has on camera pictures on the - that spot Jack thought he saw the light spot and a few other changes.
|112:51:08|CMP|Oh, okay.
|112:51:08|CC|And, Ron, just for your information, regardless of what we do on that antenna, we won't have any Flight Plan changes until after 144 hours due to that antenna.
|112:51:08|CMP|Oh! Okay,
|112:51:08|CC|Ron, we would like Hg tank 2 FANS to ON.
|112:54:00|CMP|tank 2 FANS are ON, now.

|113:54:45|CMP|So far as I know.
|113:54:45|CC|Okay, great. Anytime you want to start taking a Flight Plan update, just let me know.
|113:54:45|CMP|Okay. (Cough) Give me a little bit of time to lead into the landing site there, and we can go ahead and do it now.
|113:54:45|CC|Okay.
|113:54:45|CC|The first thing is at 119:00, 119:00. Add the following words, Ron: "Configure camera." In parenthesis, "Earthshine photos. CM5, command module 5 window/November Kilo. Nikon/55/VHBW." That's Victor Hotel Bravo Whiskey.

|113:54:45|CC|Okay. Go down to 119:24 and add the following. Let me just read it to you in - quickly here, so you can put in the words you want to. The words are "Point at target marked by LMP. Use same technique as for Copernicus central peak."
|113:54:45|CMP|Okay. We'll point at the target by the LMP. Use the same technique, which is starting out at 1 second - -
|113:54:45|CC|Roger, Let me read it to you.
|113:54:45|CMP|- - was it 30 seconds?
|113:54:45|CC|Roger, 1 second, two frames; 1/2 second, two frames; 1/4 second, two frames; 1/8 second, two frames; l/l6 second, two frames. On Copernicus, we're using a 30-second interval. It's not important, - the interval. It's mainly just the stop settings on that. You're going to use a total of 10 frames.
|113:54:45|CMP|Okay.
|113:54:45|CC|Okay, then add the following after that: After completion of above, switch to window CB3. For 8 frame of end of target, Papa 17 Delta. At 30-second intervals. Record frame number.
|113:59:52|CMP|Okay, I've got to switch to window number 3 for end of target. Say again, the target number.
|113:59:52|CC|P, as in Papa; 17 Delta, D as in Delta. 17 Delta.
|113:59:52|CMP|Okay, Papa 17 Delta.
|113:59:52|CC|As 30-second intervals.
|113:59:52|CC|Okay, Ron. There is a caution note on this. It's a note concerning the frame usage.
||||Tape 76B/3|Page 630
|113:59:52|CMP|Seems to me like Zebra Zebra only has 18 frames, doesn't it?
|113:59:52|CC|That's affirm. Do not exceed 18 frames. The balance of mag Zebra Zebra was used for preflight calibration. Do not exceed 18 frames. You can put that down any way you want it.
|113:59:52|CMP|Okay.
|113:59:52|CC|Okay. Under rev 17, I've got a note - a similar note, Ron, for rev 17.
|113:59:52|CMP|Okay.
|113:59:52|CC|The note is, do not exceed 40 frames on earthshine mag Whiskey Whiskey. Balance of magazine was used for preflight cal. I'll say again, do not exceed 40 frames on earthshine mag Whiskey Whiskey.
|113:59:52|CMP|Okay, on mag Whiskey Whiskey don't exceed 40 frames. The balance is already on calibration.
|113:59:52|CC|That's affirmative. And I've got three notes then, Ron, just general notes - may come up in the crew film area. Mag Papa Papa for crew option. Just use mag Papa Papa for crew option. Do not use Kilo Kilo for crew option. Do not use Kilo Kilo for crew option. The last one is save all the remaining VHBW on Quebec Quebec and Romeo Romeo for scheduled photos. We have a very small margin on each.
|113:59:52|CC|... end of update.
|113:59:52|CMP|That was - Okay, save all remaining on Quebec Quebec. And what was the other one, Jack?
|113:59:52|CC|Romeo Romeo.
|113:59:52|CMP|Okay, no extras on those two, then - on the VHBW, huh?
|113:59:52|CC|Yes, we got a very small margin on those now. And, you're about 10 minutes prior to landing site orbital. Why don't you go over and start studying that, if you want?
||||Tape 76B/4|Page 631
|114:03:20|CMP|Okay.
|114:11:52|CMP|You know you look at - next to Macrobius A, there is a lind of a dark halo-type crater there. Very small one. And it doesn't have the appearance of a hummocky crater rim to it, at all. It looks like the material just kind of spreads out all over the area, but it doesn't have a hummocky appearance to it. I'm going to take a look at that again when I come back - on back around on the other side. There's a small mound down in the bottom of the crater, also. It's a domicalshaped structure in the bottom of that small crater. It's right next to J3. North of J3.
|114:11:52|CC|Roger, Ron.
|114:11:52|CMP|Coming in, I can see the landing site, now -quite well. The appearance of the slide area definitely shows up. The South Massif seems to have the Sun shining right on the walls. I'm looking for any type of layering, or anything like that. And can't see anything that - that would show that up. The big difference between the massif structures and the Sculptured Hills is that the massifs look like they are a steeper slope. And they - they don't seem to have that type of covering over them, like the Sculptured Hills do.
|114:11:52|CMP|I'm right over now. The scarp definitely cuts up through the North Massif. I can't see continuation on into the South Massif at all. But, you can definitely see a vertical exaggeration as it cuts on around up over the North Massif. And it's almost - I'd have to take another look at it for sure, but it almost looks like a flow coming from Family or in the vicinity - in the direction of Family Mountain - but from the direction of Family Mountain - lapping up on the side of the North Massif. That's the way it looks as you go on by it. I couldn't see anything that would lead you to believe that the slide area, so to speak, would come on across anything that would be the source of that slide area. I still think I can see the -one spot that has a lighter albedo than the surrounding area there in the Pentagon complex. And it's pretty close to the - Let me get my chart out here and take a look at it again.
||||Tape T6B/5|Page 632
|114:16:50|CMP|No, it still looks like that area that's blown away there is Dog November - between Dog November and Dog Papa. And about 83.4 or something like that.
|114:17:07|CC|Copy.
|114:17:07|CMP|Yes, just like the map shows, and all the pictures, you've got a definite demarcation in the annulus around Serenitatis here, as you look by Sulpicius Gallus area. As you look at it - I'm going to have to take another check on it - but the dark annulus looks to me like it's raised above the mare, proper, itself. I'll check that a little more as we come on across.
|114:17:07|CMP|You know all those rilles to the north of - I mean to the west of Sulpicius Gallus. There is a bunch of crisscrossing. One is right on the edge of the Serenitatis basin - and I don't remember the name of that crater, I'll have to look it up later - but they've got slightly raised rims around the rilles. You can see some layering down inside the rille itself, in the east-west and the one that runs in the east-west direction.
|114:17:07|CC|Roger. You're talking about near Menelaus?
|114:17:07|CMP|Yes, I'll have to look on the map and see for sure what the crater is, but there's an impact crater right on the edge of Serenitatis basin -right on the terminator. Right now.
|114:17:07|CC|P.oger.
|114:17:07|CMP|And then those rilles are just to the north of that crater.
|114:17:07|CC|Roger. That's probably Menelaus - M-e-n-e-l-a-u-s -Menelaus.
||||Tape 76B/6|Page 633
|114:17:07|CMP|I think it is.
|114:17:07|CC|Okay, Ron. Is The PAN CAMERA, OFF? T-stop time. PAN CAMERA to STANDBY. T-stop time.
|114:17:07|CMP|Okay. Is it now?
|114:17:07|CC|Roger. You're just a little bit past it.
|114:17:07|CMP|Oh, okay, thank you. (Chuckle) Okay, PAN CAMERA -STANDBY. Thank you. That's the first chance I had to look at the Moon, you know. These guys - -
|114:17:07|CC|Roger.
|114:17:07|CMP|- - let me look at the windows.
|114:17:07|CC|That's all right. We don't mind calling you, if you don't mind getting the call.
|114:17:07|CMP|(Chuckle) No, not in the least.
|114:17:07|CC|Ron, I'll give you a cue here shortly for PAN CAMERA - OFF. I just want you to know, we will not be retracting the mapping camera; and, therefore, we will not be closing the mapping camera, laser altimeter cover. But we will be dumping normally. Over.
|114:17:07|CMP|Okay. We're going to dump with the mapper open, is what you're saying, huh?
|114:17:07|CC|That * s aff innative.
|114:17:07|CMP|Okay.
|114:17:07|CMP|You know it looks to me like it all disappears anyhow. It just kind of leaves the spacecraft. I don't think anything comes around or even sticks around.
|114:17:07|CC|Roger, Ron.
|114:22:03|CC|At your convenience, HIGH GAIN to AUTO.
|114:22:03|CMP|You have HIGH GAIN to AUTO.
||||Tape 76B/7|Page 634
|114:22:03|CC|Thank you, sir.
|114:22:03|CMP|Okay, it's orbital science photos coming up here. Do you want to use magazine KK still? Or should we finish up Oscar Oscar?
|114:22:03|CC|Stand by, Ron. Checking with Tommy on that one.
|114:22:03|CC|Ron, they'd like you to use mag KK on that.
|114:22:03|CMP|Okay.
|114:22:03|CC|While you're looking at the Flight Plan there, at 117'-20 where that mapping camera stuff - just delete mapping camera, retract; and mapping camera, laser altimeter cover, closed at 117:15-
|114:22:03|CMP|Okay. Delete mapping camera, retract; arid mapping camera, laser altimeter, closed. Okay.
|114:22:03|CC|Roger.
|114:22:03|CMP|Okay, magazine KK is starting with 21 pictures.
|114:22:03|CC|Roger. We copy.
|114:22:03|CMP|Okay. Bob, if - would you give me a call when you get ready for that mapping camera stuff? I was kind of shoved off this morning, and I got to sample their buses.
|114:22:03|CC|Yes. Roger, Ron. We'll give you a call - first one will probably be a pan camera call here shortly, and then I'll call you when it's time for those purge line heaters - things like that.
|114:26:20|CMP|Okay.
|114:26:20|CC|Okay, Ron, PAN CAMERA POWER to OFF.
|114:28:22|CMP|Okay, PAR CAMERA POWER - Let's see. PAN CAMERA POWER is OFF.
|114:28:22|CC|Thank you, sir.
|114:28:22|CMP|Good.
||||Tape 76B/8|Page 635
|114:28:22|CMP|Hey, this is not so bad, if you think of iced tea, I guess.
|114:28:22|CC|Roger.
|114:28:22|CC|Just for your information, Ron. Gene's out on the surface right now.
|114:28:22|CMP|Oh, they are? Hey, great I
|114:28:22|CMP|Did they confirm my position yet?
|114:28:22|CC|I don't - Let me check here - I don't think we have it pinned down exactly. You're pretty darn close to it. That's for sure.
|114:32:25|CMP|You know, it's funny. It wasn't as bright - That pass over - This last pass - as it was the time before.
|114:41:05|CC|I hope you haven't - I hope you haven't spilled any; and, by the way, LMP is on the surface now, too.
|114:41:05|CC|America, Houston. You can go with the HO PURGE HEATERS now.
|114:41:05|CC|America, Houston.
|114:41:05|CMP|Houston, America. Go ahead.
|114:41:05|CC|Roger. You can go with the H2 PURGE LINE HEATERS and the rest of that Flight Plan.
|114:41:05|CMP|Okay. What do you know? The PURGE LINE HEATERS have been ON.
|114:41:05|CC|Roger. We kind of suspected that.
|114:41:05|CMP|Okay. (Laughter) Okay. Let's see. MAPPING CAMERA can come OFF. Thirty seconds.
|114:45:31|CMP|Okay, MAPPING CAMERA is going to STANDBY. IM PITCH MOTION is OFF. Altimeter - LASER ALTIMETER -is OFF. UV is OFF. IR is OFF. Okay, UV cover -box. UV COVER is CLOSED; barber pole, gray. IR COVER is CLOSED; barber pole, gray. Okay, MAP CAMERA LASER ALTIMETER - we'll leave that one OPEN.
||||Tape T6B/9|Page 636
|114:45:31|CC|Good show, Ron.
|114:45:31|CMP|Okay. Then it's my understanding you don't want to do any dumping until I go on the back side of the Moon. Is that correct?
|114:45:31|CC|That's affirm, Ron.
|114:45:31|CMP|Okay.
|114:45:31|CC|According to the Flight Plan, you do it at 117:50. Right about that time.
|114:45:31|CMP|Okay. Will do.
|114:48:23|CMP|Bob, one little notice. Supplies I had this morning. Might made notes, so I wouldn't forget about it. It was when you go to tunnel vent, it takes a heck of a long time to vent that tunnel. In the simulator down there, you go to tunnel vent, and it flips right down and vents. And I was beginning to wonder if it - if it was leaking or something.
|114:48:23|CC|Roger.
|114:48:23|CMP|As it turned out, as it turns out, it worked out all right. But I bet it took a good 10 minutes, -to get up to 3.5. Before I could turn the jets back on, you know.
|114:48:23|CC|Roger.
|114:48:23|CMP|Go, that's ready to go.
|114:48:23|CC|Ron, just one reminder as we go around the horn here. The waste water - the way - the position it is in will probably take between 10 and 12 minutes to dump it completely. Or dump it to your .10 percent number.
|114:48:23|CMP|Okay, that's good. Oh, glad I don't have anybody watching for me this time. Do I?
|114:48:23|CC|Yes, that's right. We won't be able to call you on that. When it's down to 8 percent.
||||Tape 76B/10|Page 637
|114:48:23|CMP|(Laughter) Okay, I'll put my old timer on.
|114:48:23|CC|Hey, Ron, one other reminder. We know it's in the Flight Plan, but you may get real busy just prior to that orbital science photos. And EECOM would like to make sure you get the H purge line heaters off, as scheduled, at 118:02.
|114:48:23|CMP|Okay. Okay, is she in there? Yes - it's in the Flight Plan. Okay.
|114:53:21|CC|Roger; it's in the Flight Plan. But it's just before you're going to get busy on that orbital science photo. You might of - you might go to the window earlier or something.
|114:53:21|CMP|Okay. It's a good point.
|114:53:21|CC|And your friends out on the surface have the Rover out now and - starting to load it up and getting ready to check it out.
|114:53:21|CMP|Hey, great 1
|114:53:21|CC|The surface work is going really good. They're just a little bit behind the time line from their suiting-up exercise. But it doesn't make a whole lot of difference.
|114:53:21|CMP|Uhuh. Uhuh. 250 lens on that thing.
|114:58:19|CC|Ron, you're 5 minutes to LOS here. And you're looking real good all around the room. No problems with any of the systems that we can see. We'll see it at 118:29. And we'll be with you for another 5 minutes here.
|114:58:19|CMP|118:29, okay. Okay, we're going to have a little grape drink.
|114:58:19|CC|Just remember what Jan says. Don't spill it on your flight suit.
|114:58:19|CMP|(Laughter) Right.
||||Tape 76B/11|Page 638
|114:58:19|CMP|Did I miss lunch? Or wasn't I supposed to get any lunch today?
|114:58:19|CC|I don't know, that wasn't on my shift. But if you're hungry, why don't you eat something?
|114:58:19|CMP|(Laughter) That's what I'm doing.
|114:58:19|CC|It's been a long time since lunch - -
|114:58:19|CMP|I'm nibbling.
|114:58:19|CMP|Yes. Long time since breakfast, I think, wasn't it?
|114:58:19|CC|Yes, I think it was. And you got about 4 more hours until scheduled eat time. So - you got some lunar sounder work there - and about 119 or so, so you might as well consider eating a lot.
|114:58:19|CMP|Yes, I could eat dinner. I'm kind of nibbling a little bit.
|114:58:19|CC|Just want to make sure you don't lose your scissors, too.
|114:58:19|CMP|Yes. This time I got them snapped to the hand controller and stuck in the little thing around it. I don't know how I've lost those things.
|114:58:19|CC|Roger.
|114:58:19|CMP|I didn't like that big string on there all the time. I didn't like that big string getting all over the place. So I rolled the string on the strap, and stuck the scissors in that little bungee that's on the hand controller. I woke up the next morning and they're gone. I still think it's behind the optics.
|114:58:19|CC|Just don't go look at them; okay? We'll find them pre - postflight. Okay?
|114:58:19|CMP|Okay.
||||Tape 76B/12|Page 639
|114:58:19|CC|Hey, Ron. I don't know what Tommy has against you, but they just never scheduled an eat period in here. We checked this out so thoroughly that, we forgot to check it to see if there was an eat period in there.
|114:58:19|CMP|We probably weren't hungry when we checked it out.
|115:00:54|CC|Roger.

|115:51:12|CMP|Hey, great!
|115:51:12|CC|And Bob just passed word that they just dropped the scissors up there, but they found them under the dirt awhile. Anyway, they almost lost a pair of scissors.
|115:51:12|CMP|(Laughter) Oh, come on now. They've only got one pair, too, I think. Unless both of them ended up over there.
|115:51:12|CC|Get some good pictures of Aitken there, Ron?
|115:51:12|CMP|Yes, I sure did.
|115:51:12|CC|Out of curiosity - -
|115:51:12|CMP|Almost missed ... picture.

|116:06:24|CMP|Gee whiz.
|116:07:118|CMP|Okay. Finally got mag ZZ on the ole Nikon.
|116:07:118|CC|Roger. Looking at the Flight Plan, Ron, you're coming up on selecting OMNI Bravo and setting up the HIGH GAIN and pow - powering it OFF-, and getting ready for the LUNAR SOUNDER receive only section here.

|116:09:52|CMP|(Laughter) Very good. I was just curious. I don't hear them. I thought maybe I could hear them. Yes, have a ball down there, guys.
|116:13:40|CC|Okay, Ron. We're - It looks like we're about 30 seconds in front of OPERATE. Right there on OPERATE,
|116:13:40|CMP|Okay.
|116:13:40|CC|And we're not going to have a number - - any calls here for a good 40 minutes, so this is a good time to catch up on your meal regimen there if you want, Ron.
|116:13:40|CMP|(Laughter) Okay.
|116:20:59|CC|Ron, when you get a chance, we'd like H TANK 3 FAN to OFF.
|116:21:09|CMP|Okay. H£ TANK 3 FANS are OFF.
|116:21:09|CC|Roger,
|116:21:09|CMP|Hey, Bob. Did Jack call down where that flash is -where he saw that light flash?
|116:21:09|CC|Roger.
|116:21:09|CMP|Okay. I've got a mark next to Riccioli G -Riccioli Golf. Is that correct?
|116:21:09|CC|That's affirmative. We - we circled it - at Grimaldi B and the east and north of Grimaldi B, right in that area.
|116:21:09|CMP|Okay. We've put it just - got a little X about the diameter of Riccioli G, to the west of Riccioli G.
||||Tape 77B/5|Page 690
|116:21:09|CC|Okay. That's probably - -
|116:21:09|CMP|... west of it.
|116:21:09|CC|That's probably - he didn't ever call the - I'll ask FAO here, but I don't think he ever called the actual - coordinates on it. I'll ask FAO. That's probably close enough. They'll probably all be in the picture anyway, wouldn't it?
|116:21:09|CMP|Oh, yes. They'll all be in the picture anyhow.
|116:21:09|CMP|You'll never believe it, but I saw lightning flash down there too. I don't know. That last rev. Did you hear that?
|116:21:09|CC|Roger. We heard that, Ron. The thought that occurs to us, should you be seeing the - those cosmic ray flashes just while you're looking at the lunar surface and getting that effect?
|116:21:09|CMP|Yes, that's what I'm wondering myself, you know.
|116:21:09|CC|As Charlie said, he mentioned he'd seen something similar to that and possibly thought it was that. And we were thinking that maybe what it was with Jack, but it won't hurt to take a picture of the area anyway.
|116:21:09|CMP|Well, I think we'll try taking a picture of it, but I think I tend to agree with you. That's probably what it was.
|116:21:09|CC|We're just guessing just like anybody else on that. We're just - just guessing on it, Ron.
|116:21:09|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. Nothing showing up on the seismometer anyhow ...
|116:21:09|CC|Well, you have to remember on the seismometer, on at least the one for Jack's call, the S-IVB had just clobbered the seismometer, and - and that there was something small impact that when the -it was in the mud, you wouldn't have seen it.
|116:21:09|CMP|Oh, okay; sure.
||||Tape 77B/6|Page 691
|116:27:58|CC|Ron, I know you're wondering. All the data so far on the lunar sounder has come out real good, and the HP pass is looking real good.
|116:27:58|CMP|Oh, that's dandy! Hey, that's great!
|116:27:58|CMP|Let's hope something is going on the film.
|116:27:58|CC|That's - that's Roger on that. We sure hope so.
|116:27:58|CMP|(Laughter) Oh, I'm sure it is.
|116:27:58|CC|You take another look at Copernicus, or did you eat during the test?
|116:27:58|CMP|Just stuck my head out the window. I've got to find it. There it is, right here.
|116:27:58|CMP|Oh., boy. Just wasn't quite light adapted there. I'm not sure if you could really tell ... going through there or not.
|116:27:58|CC|Roger. Understand.
|116:27:58|CMP|You know, light and dark albedos show up real well. You can see some indication of terrain; that is, hilliness or burrows or - or grabens or rilles. Of course, the fresh craters show up a - lot wider with, respect to the surrounding territory than I think they do in the - on the bright side, you know? With the Sun shining on them.
|116:27:58|CC|Roger.
|116:33:20|CC|Gene became the first auto-mechanic on the Moon as one of the rear fenders fell off the Rover right after they deployed it, so he had to tape it on with some tape.
|116:33:20|CMP|(Laughter) Oh, he did? Well, they were pretty much sure those things were going to fall off anyhow.
|116:33:20|CC|Yes, they were willing to bet on it.
|116:33:35|CMP|You can't pack them in there, you have to - yes - -
||||Tape 78B/1|Page 736
|116:34:54|CC|Roger.
|116:34:54|CMP|I should be able to get back there next rev, I guess.
|116:34:54|CC|Roger. Look like a gamma up there? Is that why they call it a gamma?
|116:34:54|CMP|Hey, that sure does. Oddly enough, it almost looks like an elongated crater in this - this light.
|116:34:54|CC|Roger.
|116:34:54|CMP|You know, with the gamma part of it ...
|116:34:54|CC|Now, we've got both of - we got two - or a number of picture-taking sections here next rev, but we got that sequence on Copernicus and that sequence on Reiner Gamma there.
|116:34:54|CMP|Aha. Okay.
|116:34:54|CMP|And now, I'll see if I can find Riccioli.
|116:34:54|CMP|I should be able to see Grimaldi, I think.
|116:34:54|CC|Getting pretty easy to locate yourself as you go along your track?
|116:34:54|CMP|Yes, it's starting to get that way. It's not as good as I - as I want it yet. Every once in awhile, you look out of the window, you don't have the slightest idea where you are (chuckle).
|116:34:54|CC|Right.
|116:34:54|CMP|Yes, I can see Grimaldi and Riccioli coming up now. Just passing over the edge of the mare ...
||||Tape 78B/2|Page 737
|116:32:54|CC|Roger. That's Grimaldi mare there?
|116:32:54|CMP|Yes, I can see it coming up.
|116:32:54|CC|Okay.
|116:32:54|CMP|There's a pretty stark difference between the mare and the - I guess you might as well go ahead and call them highlands, that's what they look like.
|116:32:54|CMP|East of Procellarum, in fact just before you get to Grimaldi.
|116:44:32|CMP|Okay, I want to switch to window 3. A little better to try and get the pictures.
|116:44:32|CC|Roger.
|116:44:32|CMP|Getting too much glare on the windows.
|116:44:32|CMP|Okay, Bob. That is correct. Now, you want to continue on across here at a 15th, huh?
|116:44:32|CC|Roger.
|116:48:53|CC|Okay, Ron. No ... for picture taking, but you need to select OMNI A when you get a chance.
|116:48:53|CMP|Okay.
|116:48:53|CMP|There you go.
|116:48:53|CC|Good show.
|116:48:53|CMP|Say, I can only take 18 pictures on that, I think.
|116:48:53|CC|Say again, Ron.
|116:48:53|CMP|It will only take 18 pictures, I think.
|116:48:53|CC|Roger.
|116:48:53|CMP|(Laughter) Fool around in here by yourself, and you get disoriented.
||||Tape 78B/3|Page 738
|116:54:05|CMP|Well, I didn't see any slices down there that time.
|116:54:05|CC|Roger.
|116:54:05|CC|Hey, you're looking good, Ron. You're right on the Flight Plan. We haven't missed a thing yet today, I don't think. In really good shape.
|116:54:05|CMP|Oh, okay. Good. I tell you, there's a little more hussling up here than I thought there would be though.
|116:54:05|CC|Keeping you busy, huh?
|116:54:05|CMP|(Laughter) Yes, a little bit. That's all right. It's fun.
|116:54:05|CC|Just don't want you to get lonely up there.
|116:54:05|CMP|(Laught er) Sure won't.
|116:54:05|CMP|Okay. That was mag Zebra Zebra, I guess. Started out just like we had it planned. Took two each in 1 second and a half, and then a fourth, and then an eighth. The total count on this camera is going to be 50 instead of 60.
|116:54:05|CC|Back at 150.
|116:54:05|CMP|And then the rest of them - -
|116:54:05|CC|Yes.
|116:54:05|CMP|- - And then the rest of them are l60 - 150 throughout, except the last 2 foot and a half.
|116:54:05|CC|Okay.
|116:54:05|CC|I'll get a confirmation on some, Ron, but I think when we get on to Reiner Gamma on that pass of target 15 Delta, we're not going to have enough film left to run out over Riccioli and that area, which is already taken. That's why we hate to take these now, because when - when we come up there in the next pass, you're not going to have enough film.
||||Tape 78B/4|Page 739
|116:54:05|CMP|Oh, I see. Okay.
|116:54:05|CMP|Let's see. While I got the camera out, I can look ahead, I guess, and see what - what mag to put in there.
|116:54:05|CMP|WW, I guess, huh?
|116:54:05|CC|Yes, that's affirm. WW on the lunar ...
|116:54:05|CMP|Okay. Give you that.
|116:54:05|CC|Ron, comm is getting pretty bad down here with us, we're going to lose you in about 4 minutes, maybe 5, completely. And we'll pick you back up at - 120:28 thereabouts, 120:28.
|116:54:05|CMP|120:28. Okay. We'll see you there.
|116:54:05|CC|Roger.
|117:01:52|CC|Ron, you're about ready to go over the hill. You're looking really good.
|117:01:52|CMP|Okay, Robert. Thank you much. See you in about 45 minutes then, I guess.
|117:01:52|CC|That's affirmative.
|117:01:52||BEGIN LUNAR REV 17
|117:50:05|CC|Hello, Ron. How's it going up there?
|117:50:05|CMP|Hey, pretty good, Robert. The last photo pass was a - a good one.
|117:50:05|CMP|Just about half an Earth now.
|117:50:05|CC|Roger.
|117:53:01|CMP|Houston, America. The mag Lima Lima is on frame number 54 now.
|117:53:01|CC|Roger, Ron. We copy. Lima Lima on 5^-
||||Tape 78B/5|Page 740
|117:53:01|CMP|And mag - and mag Quebec, Quebec is starting on frame 53.
|117:53:01|CC|Roger. We copy.
|118:02:16|CMP|Houston, America. I got to unplug you for a little bit. I'm so tangled up in my hoses here, I'm getting strangled to death.
|118:02:16|CC|Okay. No problem, Ron. We'll just sit. Give us a call when you're back on the air. Okay?
|118:08:01|CMP|Houston, do you need OMNI Bravo yet? Will you give me a call when you want it?
|118:08:01|CC|Roger, Ron. We'll give you a call. You can go on to Bravo now, Ron.
|118:08:01|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. Do you have it? Okeydoke.
||||Tape 79B/1|Page 778
|118:07:43|CC|Roger.
|118:07:43|CMP|But I'm sure it isn't that way.
|118:07:43|CC|Yes, we've got - -
|118:07:43|CC|Ron, if you're right there, we'd like you to take the Hg tank 2 FANs to OFF, please.
|118:09:42|CMP|Okay. Hg tank 2 FANs to OFF.
|118:09:42|CMP|You know, from the pictures of Maraldi Gamma, looked to me like it might have been some sort of a - a - well, maybe even a volcanic dome or some kind. Now when you look at it up there now and compare it with the rest of the surrounding material, it looks just like any other - any of the other sculptured hills. They have small domical structures on it, the same type of material that carries on through south of Maraldi. And it looks like maybe some kind of a mare fill has come in and filled up, Maraldi itself. You can see flow lines, it looks like, going down into Maraldi from Tranquillitatis. Now - The impact on the craters that are inside Maraldi, they're smaller-type craters and they have a - they have a definite bluish tinge to the halo that comes out as opposed to the bright - opposed to the bright craters or white-type thing and those are -have more of a bl - a darkish bluish tin - tinge to them. And - -
|118:09:42|CC|Thank you, Ron.
|118:09:42|CMP|- - oddly enough, that's the same type of - That's the same type of bluish tinge that I see right in the landing site right now. In the Pentagon complex, MOCR shows up that - that same type of a bluish tinge to it.
||||Tape 79B/2|Page 779
|118:09:42|CC|Roger. Did you have any luck locating the LM area in the landing site this time?
|118:09:42|CMP|Yes, I don't even see the bright spot there anymore. I know - I know where to look for it and I don't even see it.
|118:09:42|CC|Roger. Understand.
|118:12:30|CMP|Well, South Massif just went into a hole, too, so -
|118:12:30|CC|Roger. Our best estimate of their location down here. Ron is - 83 - Delta Mike 83. Delta Mike 83.
|118:12:30|CMP|Delta Mike 83, huh?
|118:12:30|CC|Yes, and that's - that's seen on the southeast sheet - the FE sheet with the landing site and the first EVA on it. The one, the 25,000 grid map on the - one of those you had put in at the last minute there.
|118:12:30|CMP|Okay,
|118:12:30|CC|And I assume you're set up for these pictures coming up at 121, right?
|118:12:30|CMP|Yes. It's funny, I can see Bessel, but I'll be durn if I can see a Copernican ray going across it - I mean a Tycho ray going - Copernican ray, I guess.
|118:12:30|CC|I think you were right the first time, weren't you?
|118:12:30|CMP|Yes, it's a lycho ray.
|118:12:30|CC|Ron, I'm sorry we missed this last time. If you'll give me a hack when you start on the oarth-shine photos on P17s the Copernicus one, I'll -I'll time your 30 seconds for you down here ;md save you looking at the clock. And - -
|118:12:30|CMP|Oh, okay. Hey, that's a good idea.
||||Tape 79B/3|Page 780
|118:12:30|CC|I guess even though the start time we passed and everything is the time, Farouk wanted to remind you that when you pass Eratosthenes is a good time to be looking into the heart of Copernicus, there. If you'll remember from the map, there.
|118:12:30|CMP|Okay. Hey, that's a good idea; thank you.
|118:16:28|CC|Were you able to see the Sul- Sulpicius Gallus Ridge there, Ron?
|118:16:28|CMP|Yes, man oh man. That thing really sticks up there.
|118:16:28|CMP|I'm trying to estimate the height of it with respect to one of those craters down there, but -I - I still can't get over the - the difference in the color and the annulus around Serenitatis. And that thing is really apparent.
|118:16:28|CC|Roger.
|118:16:28|CMP|And it looks like - the color- - the color distinction - stops right at this ridge here, just as we're going into the sunset right now.
|118:16:28|CC|Roger.
|118:16:28|CMP|I'm trying to determine a - a flow with respect to those ridges, if there is such a thing.
|118:16:28|CMP|I'll have to look at it again when I come around the next time. Okay, Ki - Kilo's got 69 frames.
|118:16:28|CC|Roger.
|118:21:48|CC|Okay, Ron. You're about 2 minutes from T-start time, but again bias your T-start time with respect to the crater Eratosthenes.
|118:21:48|CMP|Okay. Why don't you just kind of give me a - ... gouge when I should be at Eratosthenes (chuckle).
|118:21:48|CC|Okay. I'll give a call and, of course, your first frame is - -
||||Tape 79B/4|Page 781
|118:21:48|CMP|I think I'll - -
|118:21:48|CC|- - first frame is f/1.2 for 1 second and you'll take two frames.
|118:21:48|CMP|Okay.
|118:23:27|CC|Okay, Ron. You're about 30 seconds from T-start time.
|118:23:45|CMP|Okay. I think I got her.
|118:23:45|CC|Okay, just give me a call when you start. You're about 10 seconds out, now.
|118:23:45|CMP|Okay. Stand by 3, 2, 1 -
|118:23:59|CMP|MARK it.
|118:23:59|CMP|Okay; switch to a half.
|118:23:59|CC|Okay, coming up on 30 seconds.
|118:24:27|CC|MARK it.
|118:24:27|CMP|Okay, got it. The fourth.
|118:24:27|CC|Okay, coming up on another 30 second, here -
|118:24:57|CC|MARK it.
|118:24:57|CMP|Okay. Okay, I'm down to 1/15- I'm just now passing it, Bob. So there's a one on 1/15.
|118:24:57|CC|Okay, you're one ahead on the figure. You should be at 1/8 - -
|118:24:57|CMP|Two on the 15 - -
|118:24:57|CC|- - right now.
|118:24:57|CMP|- - I'll start my time from there. Yes, I've -I've already passed it so I had to get them quick (chuckle).
|118:24:57|CC|Okay, there you are 1/8 there.
||||Tape 79B/5|Page 782
|118:24:57|CMP|Okay, tell me when to - Okay.
|118:24:57|CMP|Okay. The rest of them 1/8?
|118:24:57|CC|No, at l/l6 or 1/15-
|118:24:57|CMP|Okay. Give me a time hack every 30 seconds.
|118:24:57|CC|Well - okay.
|118:24:57|CMP|Or whenever, tell me to switch windows.
|118:26:00|CC|HACK it.
|118:26:00|CC|Coming up on 30 seconds.
|118:26:30|CC|MARK it.
|118:26:30|CC|Coming up on another mark, Ron.
|118:27:00|CC|HACK it.
|118:27:00|CMP|Okay.
|118:27:00|CC|Just a reminder, the end of this line goes up to Encke and .Kepler; you've probably reviewed that.
|118:27:00|CMP|Okay.
|118:27:00|CC|Coming up on another mark.
|118:27:30|CC|HACK.
|118:27:30|CC|Coming up on our other mark.
|118:27:58|CC|MARK it.
|118:27:58|CC|Okay, Ron.
|118:28:30|CC|MARK it.
|118:28:30|CMP|Pictures in here. Okay.
|118:28:30|CC|Okay, Ron. You'll be coming up on another mark here.
||||Tape 79B/6|Page 783
|118:28:57|CC|MARK it.
|118:28:57|CMP|Got it.
|118:28:57|CC|Okay, according to my calculations you've got two more sets of two frames each to take. You've taken 20 and you've got four more to go, I believe.
|118:28:57|CMP|Okay, I want to get some for Reiner Gamma right?
|118:28:57|CC|Roger. As soon as you do that, you just switch windows to the north side and - Reiner Gamma -You got two more to go. Here we go. Coming up on another 30 seconds.
|118:28:57|CMP|Okay.
|118:29:29|CC|MARK it. You probably should be able to see Encke out there now. That's your last target there.
|118:29:29|CMP|Okay. Switch over to window 3, then.
|118:29:29|CC|Okay. Did you take that last one on Encke or you got two more to go on Encke there?
|118:29:29|CMP|... I've got - I've only got 19 frames left so -
|118:29:29|CC|Okay. That's the last ... it marked there.
|118:29:29|CMP|Same thing on the Eratosthenes? Okay.
|118:29:29|CC|Okay, Ron. On these Reiner Gamma pictures, you don't have to wait 30 seconds. You just shoot the frames as soon as you get it in view there. Shoot two frames at 1 second, two at 1/2, two at 1/4, and two at 1/8.
|118:29:29|CMP|Okay. Would you - would you believe that's what I did on Eratosthenes and also on Copernicus?
|118:29:29|CC|Roger. That's what you're supposed to do on Copernicus so you remembered better than me on that one. It wasn't 30 seconds - -
|118:29:29|CMP|(Laughter)
||||Tape 79B/7|Page 784
|118:29:29|CC|- - until after Copernicus.
|118:29:29|CMP|Yes. Well, I made a mistake too. I thought Eratosthenes was Copernicus. But anyhow we got -we got a series on Eratosthenes and also a series on Copernicus. So we're in good shape.
|118:29:29|CC|Okay. You should be seeing Gamma about now, shouldn't you?
|118:29:29|CMP|Yes, but I don't see it yet.
|118:29:29|CC|Okay.
|118:29:29|CC|Ron, you can just run this mag all the way out to frame 40. After you finish on Gamma, you just continue on out that line up towards Riccioli; and - and then run out to frame 40 and stow it.
|118:32:19|CMP|Okay; will do.
|118:36:54|CMP|Okay. Got her in sight now.
|118:46:48|CC|Okay, Ron. Did you get that mag finished up?
|118:46:48|CMP|Okay. All but one picture and I was going to try to take one of Orientale. I've saved one there just for right on the edge.
|118:46:48|CC|Okay.
|118:46:48|CMP|So I'm just kind of looking out the window now. Why, do you have some Flight Plan stuff?
|118:46:48|CC|I've only got one minor Flight Plan and that1s all so any time you're ready, don't - you know, don't tear yourself away from the window as long as you can see anything here.
|118:46:48|CMP|Okay.
|118:46:48|CC|We would like you to select OMNI Alfa.
|118:47:30|CMP|OMNI Alfa.
||||Tape 79B/8|Page 785
|118:47:30|CC|And, if you're looking at anything and you can see anything interesting, we wouldn't mind hearing about it.
|118:47:30|CMP|Okay.
|118:47:30|CMP|The big difference right in here, of course, is the - the ejecta and the radial furrows and ridges and what have you from Orientale - there isn't -doesn't seem to be that type of a pattern at all on the back side.
|118:47:30|CC|Ro ger. Underst and.
|118:50:27|CC|Can you still see - see things in earthshine or is it getting pretty black down there?
|118:50:27|CMP|Actually, you know. You can still see it. That's what kind of amazes me. It's almost like - you know, sunrise and sunset.
|118:50:27|CC|Roger.
|118:50:27|CMP|Pretty soon, the shadows get longer and longer.
|118:50:27|CC|I tell you, we got the television screen here of the - -
|118:51:07|CMP|Okay; that's my last picture off.
|118:51:07|CC|Roger. You're going to have a couple of dirty companions when they come back up, I'll tell you.
|118:51:07|CMP|(Laughter) What are they doing? Getting all dirty?
|118:51:07|CC|Well, I think they've just fallen a couple of times, and they're black all over.
|118:51:07|CMP|Yes, it looked like a dark area down there.
|118:51:07|CC|Well, they sure are dirty. Okay, Ron, I - in the Flight Plan at 133:12, way on ahead, you just might mark this down somewhere. It's a real simple -"MAPPING CAMERA/LASER ALTIMETER COVER, OPEN," and "MAPPING CAMERA, EXTEND," you'll just delete those since they're already there.
||||Tape 79B/9|Page 786
|118:51:07|CMP|Okay. Let's see - where was that now, about 131, Bob?
|118:51:07|CC|133:12. It's in the other volume, in the next volume of the Flight Plan.
|118:51:07|CMP|Oh, (chuckle) I'll just write it down, I don't have that volume out.
|118:51:07|CC|Yes, just mapping - it's delete the "MAPPING CAMERA/LASER ALTIMETER, OPEN," and ''MAPPING CAMERA - EXTEND." Just delete those two functions. You remember it's already out and the cover is staying open because it's out.
|118:51:07|CMP|Oh, okay. And that's about 131, huh?
|118:51:07|CC|133:12, 133:12.
|118:51:07|CMP|Okay. 133 plus 12.
|118:51:07|CC|And, Ron. We made a trip around the room here and the CSM systems are all GO. They all look good and the lunar sounder is looking good also.
|118:51:07|CMP|Hey. Real fine. I guess I'll grab a bite to eat then here pretty quick.
|118:51:07|CC|Yes, do that, will you? Sorry you missed that other one.
|118:51:07|CMP|(Laughter) Oh, I filled in, every once in a while so that's not too bad.
|118:51:07|CC|Good enough.
|118:51:07|CC|And just a reminder, which is in the Flight Plan, DSE voice recorded at the back side will not be dumped - so -
|118:51:07|CMP|Oh, okay.
||||Tape 79B/10|Page 787
|118:51:07|CC|And, Ron, the reason why we' OFF, now is we're trying to drop some and we'll come up uration this next half.
|118:54:12|CMP|Oh, okay.

|119:49:22|CMP|Houston, America. ...
|119:49:22|CC|Go ahead, Ron.
|119:49:22|CMP|Okay. Had ny headset off here, and I wasn't paying much attention when AOS came.
|119:49:22|CC|Oh, I wasn't even talk - listening for you. I was talking to your wife.
|119:49:22|CMP|Oh, okay.
|119:49:22|CC|Did you get a decent meal?
|119:49:22|CMP|Well, it wasn't too bad.
|119:49:22|CC|Jan said - -
|119:49:22|CMP|Turkey and gravy.
|119:49:22|CC|Jan said she's - you're the last person she would ever think would miss a meal up there.
|119:49:22|CMP|(Laughter) That's probably true, really.
|119:59:08|CMP|Thank heavens.
|120:00:05|CC|Ron, are you out - glued to a window, or are you just eating now?
|120:00:05|CMP|I'm really just eating.
|120:00:05|CC|Roger. Just thought I'd update here before you get into your presleep checklist ... Have a little bit of news from the day, but today's - -
|120:00:05|CMP|Oh, okay.
||||Tape 80B/2|Page 838
|120:00:05|CC|- - sure not much news today. It's a good thing you guys made the landing today, because there wouldn't be any news in the paper tomorrow if it wasn't for you all.
|120:00:05|CMP|(Laughter)
|120:00:05|CC|Let's see. Japanese Prime Minister Tanaka's Liberal Democrats lost 26 seats, but he still has a firm hold on the Diet, and Tanaka still has a firm majority. And Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho's secret Paris peace talks have bogged down some more, and they think they are bogged down under some academic situations. And - news out of Kansas City isn't too good, but President Truman is - feeling some irregular heartbeats and has reduced the optimism for his recovery.
|120:00:05|CMP|Not too good.
|120:00:05|CC|This last one has got to be the height of trivia. I'm just going to read it to you exactly the way it is. It's from Saigon. Question? What does an Air Force enlisted man do when he meets a naked general? He salutes. An order issued by Major Paul M. Boseman at Tan Son Nhut Air Base makes the requirement clear. Salute when you recognize an officer, even though you both are nude. An Air Force spokesman said he didn't know under what circumstances officers and enlisted personnel might encounter - encounter each, other in the nude. End of - news for tonight.
|120:00:05|CMP|(Laughter) News - a little trivia, isn't it?
|120:00:05|CC|Yes, indeed.
|120:00:05|CC|Everybody from the homefront sending their love. They are having a little trouble hacking out the -the comm, since we're all on a squawk box together. So they are going to try to get it set up so just the CSM loop will go into your house tomorrow night. Tonight we had all of it, and it was kind of a jumble for them.
||||Tape 80B/3|Page 839
|120:00:05|CMP|(Laughter) I imagine so, wouldn't it? They can't turn one down - or something, huh?
|120:00:05|CC|That's right. Well, they are going to - they are going to try and get it worked on for tomorrow so that only the CSM loop will go in there. They just had to finally give up on it and go watch the - the surface work on television because over where the loop was, it was just too much.
|120:00:05|CMP|Yes, I bet.
|120:00:05|CC|When you get into the presleep checklist, you. can delete the stir cryos, which is in the checklist. We won't stir the cryos, and then as you get further downstream closer to LOS here - the sleep period, we'll have you turn the TANK 2 FANS to the ON position. I'll give you a reminder on that.
|120:00:05|CMP|Okay.
|120:05:06|CMP|Okay, Houston-, America. BAT C is about 36.8 or 9È something like that (cough).
|120:05:06|CC|Say again. Say again - -
|120:05:16|CMP|PYR0 A is 37.
|120:05:16|CC|Okay.
|120:05:18|CMP|PYR0 - okay. PYR0 A is 37; PYR0 B is 37- BAT C is oh - 36.9- Okay. I think you want the quads now, ...?
|120:05:18|CC|Roger.
|120:05:44|CMP|Okay. Alfa is 82. Bravo - a 78. Charlie is 80. Delta is - about 83.
|120:05:44|CC|Roger. We got those, and that matches pretty close with, what we got right in front of us on those quads. You can go ahead and take the tanks 2 FANS to ON at this time - -
||||Tape 80B/4|Page 840
|120:05:44|CMP|Okay.
|120:06:22|CMP|Okay. Tank 2 FANS are going ON. H2, that is.
|120:06:22|CC|Roger.
|120:07:35|CC|And, Ron, we'd like OMNI Bravo.
|120:07:44|CMP|Okay. You have OMNI Bravo.
|120:18:13|CC|Ron, you have leas than a minute to LUNAR SOUNDER, OPERATE and STANDBY.
|120:18:13|CMP|Oh, okay. Thank you. 2:59, huh?
|120:18:13|CC|Roger. 122:59-
|120:18:13|CC|How about giving me a mark on it so I can see what the actual delay is here in the room? If you're going to do it right at 59, give me a mark, will you please?
|120:18:13|CMP|Okay.
|120:18:13|CMP|55 - 56 - 57 - 58 - 59 -
|120:19:03|CMP|MARK it.
|120:19:03|CC|Answer: 3 seconds away, big as life.
|120:19:03|CMP|(Laughter) Okay.
|120:19:03|CC|You may be far away, but you're as close as your telephone.
|120:19:03|CMP|(Laughter) That's right.
|120:20:13|CC|You can go RECORDER, OFF, now, Ron.
|120:20:21|CMP|Okay. RECORDER - is OFF.
|120:20:21|CC|And if you will, you can pick up on the top of the next page, 123- RADAR, OFF; DATA SYSTEM* OFF; et cetera. ... DATA SYSTEM, ON.
||||Tape 80B/5|Page 841
|120:20:21|CMP|Okay.
|120:21:24|CMP|Okay. RADAR is coming OFF, DATA SYSTEM is coming ON.
|120:21:32|CMP|HIGH GAIN ANTENNA is going to POWER.
|120:21:42|CMP|MANUAL, WIDE.
|120:21:50|CMP|74, 280.
|120:22:22|CMP|Okay. SM/AC POWER is coining ON.
|120:22:45|CMP|MAPPING CAMERA is STANDBY. Self test to heaters.
|120:22:56|CMP|UV is ON. IR is ON.
|120:23:05|CMP|(Cough) UV COVER is going OPEN. Barber pole and a gray.
|120:23:11|CMP|IR is OPEN. Barber pole and a gray.
|120:23:11|CC|Roger, Ron. Just on those HIGH GAIN ANTENNAS, on your knob settings, we'd like you to tweak those as close to those settings as you can possibly get it, for good comm during the night.
|120:23:11|CMP|Okay. You want - minus 74 and 280, huh?
|120:23:11|CC|That's affirmative; we just wanted to tweak them up as best we can.
|120:23:11|CC|I'll say it again. It's the one in the sleep checklist. You'll get to it at - you get to it down here at about - at about 23:10.
|120:23:11|CMP|Oh, okay.
|120:23:11|CC|Sounds like some good music in the background there.
|120:23:11|CMP|Oh, not too bad really.
|120:25:30|CC|Ron, if you're finished there, we would like the -ACCEPT. We got to get on monitor load, and we got a state vector for you tonight.
||||Tape 80B/6|Page 842
|120:25:42|CMP|Okay. You have ACCEPT.
|120:25:42|CC|Roger.
|120:25:42|CC|FDO showed me where those - they're plotting on Doppler what those mascons are doing to you. They really - really have effect.
|120:25:42|CMP|Oh, they are, huh?
|120:25:42|CC|Yes, you can really see when you are going right over Imbrium and - Serenitatis.
|120:25:42|CMP|(Laughter)
|120:25:42|CC|And Just prior to getting into the rest - sleep, we can take BATTERY B off the charge; terminate the charge.
|120:26:36|CMP|Okay.
|120:27:35|CMP|Okay. I checked out the tone booster, and it's hooked up.
|120:27:35|CC|Good show.
|120:30:34|CMP|Well, I guess I'd better chlorinate the old water.
|120:35:20|CC|Okay, Ron. You can go to BLOCK. The computer is yours.
|120:35:20|CMP|Okay. Will do shortly.
|120:35:20|CC|Okay. You want me to remind you again while you're - after you're chlorinated here?
|120:35:20|CMP|No, I'll get it out.
|120:35:20|CC|Okay.
|120:35:20|CC|The ~ the sur - the surface boys are on the way back to the LM, completed their EVA, and they're getting - they're driving back to LM right now.
|120:35:20|CMP|Hey, good.
||||Tape 80B/7|Page 843
|120:35:20|CMP|They got out and did a little riding around on the Rover too, huh?
|120:35:20|CC|That's right. It - they - they - -
|120:35:20|CMP|After the ALSEP wsts all deployed?
|120:35:20|CC|Yes. The ALSEP's deployed. They had to cut their time at Station 1 a little bit. They got to curtail the EVA slightly short of 7 hours due to the high oxygen usage during the - deploying the ALSEP. Only 15 minutes early, so it's no big deal.
|120:35:20|CMP|Oh., I see. Well, that's not bad.
|120:35:20|CC|No, they1 re - Gene was working pretty hard putting tkat drill in the ground, and it was some pretty difficult work. And they - they each fell a couple of times, so they were really pretty busy.
|120:35:20|CMP|(Laughter)
|120:39:00|CMP|Are we going to leave tank 3-1 mean, tank 2, H_ FAN, ON, all the time?
|120:39:05|CC|Roger. H2 tank 2 FAN, ON, for all night.
|120:39:05|CMP|Okay.
|120:39:32|CC|Only thing we've got, Ron, is it looks like you've got to get the BAT B off the CHARGE and then -configure the comm, and you are already to bed down.
|120:39:32|CMP|Okay.
|120:39:59|CMP|Okay. BATTERY B relay's breakers IN. Charger's OFF.
|120:39:59|CMP|Okay. I've got to clean the old suit circuit return screen yet.
|120:39:59|CMP|Plus X forward here so - plus 25 and 195* No, wait a minute. Minus 10 and plus 25.
||||Tape 80B/8|Page 844
|120:39:59|CC|Roger. That - that's affirmative. Minus 10, plus 25. And as tight as you can get it to those numbers, Ron.
|120:39:59|CMP|Well, I'll tell you what. I believe the dials more than I believe the set knobs, so - Was that the AOS there? No. Not quite.
|120:42:37|CC|Ron, we just been debating here; you need to be sure to do the knobs at the minus 10 and plus 25*
|120:42:37|CMP|Okay. I'll put the knobs there.
|120:44:27|CC|Ron, everything is looking great down here. It was a really great day, really busy. We're sorry about that eat period; and it' s been real - lot of - lot of things accomplished.
|120:44:27|CMP|(Laughter) It was a good day. Don't worry about that eating. No problem there.
|120:44:27|CC|And the bird looks great, and We'll see you when we wake you up. You can sign off any time.
|120:44:27|CMP|Okay.

|120:47:57|CC|Ron, just a reminder on the S-BAND NORMAL, VOICE, OFF, vtien you're ready to - back out.
|120:47:57|CMP|Okay. Let me throw a little ... solution down in the water here for about 10 minutes, I think.
|120:47:57|CC|Roger.
|120:47:57|CMP|It takes a little longer to do all this stuff by yourself (laughter).
||||Tape 80B/9|Page 845
|120:47:57|CC|It sure does.
|120:53:24|CC|Okay, Ron. We're going to drop the up-link here in 1 minute, so see you tomorrow.
|120:53:24|CMP|Okay. Thank you all. We'll see you in the morning.
|120:53:24|CC|That's all right. You - you can call us, but we - -

|134:18:15|CMP|Okay. Just a second.
|134:18:15|CMP|Okay. Go.
|134:21:59|CC|Okay. At 137:33, the solar corona photo pad is T-start: 137=33:48. Over.
|134:21:59|CMP|Okay. Solar corona pad, 137:33:48.
|134:21:59|CC|Roger. The next one's over at 139:20.
|134:21:59|CMP|Okay ¥ Go.
|134:21:59|CC|Okay. The old one, delete "MAPPING CAMERA/LASER ALTIMETER COVER, OPEN." And at 139:21, delete "MAPPING CAMERA, EXTEND," since they're already there.
|134:21:59|CMP|Okay. Got them.
|134:22:54|CC|Okay, Ron. At 139:21, where it says, "UV COVER, OPEN," move that down to 139:23. Make the following note. "Delay opening 2 minutes to check operating current with cover closed." We'll be checking that and giving you a cue on that.
|134:22:54|CMP|Oh, okay.
||||Tape 89B/4|Page 968
|134:22:54|CC|And there's nothing - no problems expected there, Ron, We're just getting some extra data that OSO wants.
|134:22:54|CMP|Okay. Good deal.
|134:23:35|CC|Okay. The next one is at l4l:50.
|134:23:35|CMP|l4l -
|134:23:35|CC|141:50.
|134:23:35|CMP|l4l:50; okay.
|134:23:35|CC|Okay. We got - -
|134:23:35|CMP|Okay, I got It.
|134:23:35|CC|We've got a little - seeing some funnies on the V/H OVERRIDE, so after PAN CAMERA, STANDBY, STEREO, and POWER, we want to add the following: V/H OVERRIDE, HIGH ALTITUDE - HIGH ALT.
|134:23:35|CMP|Okay, V/H OVERRIDE to HIGH ALTITUDE.
|134:23:35|CC|Okay, make - -
|134:23:35|CMP|After you get the PAN CAMERA POWER, ON.
|134:23:35|CC|Pardon me, Ron. I missed that.
|134:23:35|CMP|That's right. That's - after you get the PAN CAMERA POWER, ON, V/H to HIGH ALTITUDE.
|134:24:40|CC|Roger. Okay, Ron, the next two are just a couple of info notes for you. I don't know where you want to write this one, but FAO would like to remind you that you don't have any margin on mag Lima Lima anymore; you used up all your margin on that mag. Everything else is needed for planned operation.
|134:24:40|CMP|Uh-huh! Okay.
|134:25:10|CC|And, the last one just - -
||||Tape 89B/5|Page 969
|134:25:10|CMP|Discontinue spares on Lima Lima.
|134:25:10|CC|Roger. Just use Lima Lima as scheduled, but don't -don't use any spare shots on it. And the last one is just a sum up here, Ron.
|134:25:10|CMP|Okay.
|134:25:10|CC|You obviously are aware of it, but you have not missed any mapping camera, pan- camera, or lunar sounder operations to date. And we're all on schedule and right on the Flight Plan - outstanding Flight Plan.
|134:25:10|CMP|Yes. You bet it's an outstanding Flight Plan. That's great!
|134:25:10|CC|Yes, Ron. I think you had a really outstanding Flight Plan to be flying at this time of the year, because the weather in Houston is so miserable that you can't believe it.
|134:25:10|CMP|(Laughter) Oh, boy. That's what everybody keeps saying.
|134:25:57|CC|Roger. I just drove in, and it's kind of a sleety rain. It feels like it might snow at any moment, although It's really not that cold. The ceiling is probably down about 6 - 700 feet. It is really rotten out there.
|134:25:57|CMP|(Laughter) Yes, we did - we did pick a good time to make the flight then.
|134:25:57|CC|That's affirmative. It's been this way since you left.
|134:25:57|CMP|(Laughter)
|134:25:57|CC|You guys - you realize, of course, that you're going to get --
|134:25:57|CMP|Well, we want everybody to get ... - -
|134:25:57|CC|- - blamed for that, because with two people on the Moon, that's what happens.
||||Tape 89B/6|Page 970
|134:25:57|CMP|(Laughter) Yes, right.
|134:25:57|CC|Okay. You can get back to work then, if you want.
|134:25:57|CMP|Okay.
|134:26:54|CMP|See if I can get my solar - solar corona squared away here.
|134:26:54|CC|Okay.
|134:27:35|CMP|Okay. Solar corona is mag QQ, and we're on frame 69*
|134:27:35|CC|Okay. Mag QQ, 69.
|134:31:56|CMP|And, Houston; America. Let's see. You're going to send me over the hill in high bit rate this time for sure, are you? As usual (chuckle).
|134:31:56|CC|Stand by on that, Ron. Let me check in the go on that.
|134:31:56|CMP|Looks like it.
|134:31:56|CC|That's affirmative, Ron. You'll be going over the hill in high bit rate.
|134:36:14|CMP|And, Houston; America. Just so I won't get confused there, I put two protect frames at the start of this.
|134:36:14|CC|Roger. That's affirm. We got that.
|134:36:14|CMP|I just wanted to try out that - mode contrable [sic] -control cable with the PCM stuff, you know?
|134:36:14|CC|Roger. Understand.
|134:44:42|CC|Ron, we're coming up on 5 minutes to LOS and just want to update you. We went around the room, and the spacecraft is looking great. We just have one reminder and that's at the end of the solar corona period. Please use only one protect frame - one protect frame per the Flight Plan or per the checklist. And the other thing is - the lunar sounder -the little check you did at the beginning of this pass - the recorder is pulling film as normal. The glitch we saw was a telemetry grit - glitch and the lunar sounder is looking great.
||||Tape 89B/7|Page 971
|134:45:19|CMP|Hey, outstanding! That's good to hear. Sounds like we're getting kind of low on VHBW film though is what you're saying, huh?
|134:45:19|CC|On that particular magazine; yes, Ron. That's the problem, I think. Looking at the total thing is more - is which magazine has got what on it.
|134:45:19|CMP|Oh, okay.
|134:45:52|CC|And we'll see you at 01:38:15 when you'll be just about eating. So give us a call if you want anything. We'll be listening.
|134:45:52|CMP|Okay. I'll be on the loop. Oh - Hey, one thing. Can you check on mag - what do I have on the Nikon now, XX, I guess? It seems to me like - we just need that for another zodiacal light thing.
|134:45:52|CC|Okay. We got FAO working on that.
|134:45:52|CMP|... know is, in other words, are there two or three frames available? Do we have two or three frames available on that one?
|134:45:52|CC|Okay. Let me check on it, Ron?
|134:45:52|CMP|Okay.
|134:46:44|CMP|I want to take a red and a blue picture of the landing site sometime.
|134:46:44|CC|It's going to take a little bit of chasing on that, Ron. We may not have the word before you go LOS, but we'll have it definitely when you come up AOS.
|134:46:44|CMP|Oh, okay. Yes, don't - No - no problem. I won't use it until we get to the landing site anyhow.
|134:47:24|CC|Okay, Ron. There are 18 spares on X-ray X-ray that you could use.
|134:47:31|CMP|Oh, okay . Good.

|135:36:33|CMP|Houston, America.
|135:36:33|CC|Hello, America. How are you doing?
|135:36:33|CMP|Well, I think I've got it back under control again.
|135:36:33|CC|What happened - any problems?
|135:36:33|CMP|Let's see. Let me go back to my - Well, I almost got into gimbal lock (laughter).
|135:36:33|CC|Okay. You almost got into gimbal lock. Go ahead - -
|135:36:33|CMP|Just at the last step of the - last step of the solar corona thing which says go back to CMC AUTO - which wouldn't have been too bad, except as soon as you get a waste water dump, it really torques it around, I guess. And, somewhere - you ought to be able to check it back on the tape -at about 137:50 - between 50 and probably - no, between 55 and 58, somewhere in there, I got the GIMBAL LOCK light and all those good deal things; and got her under control. Took her back. And we got back to SIM bay attitude at 137:59:20. In the meantime, while I was doing all that, looked like my waste water dropped down kind of low, too. How much are you reading down there?
|135:38:25|CC|Okay. Stand by on that, Ron.
|135:38:25|CC|We're reading 0.16 percent and 0.9 pound - 1.6 percent and 0.9 pounds, Ron.
|135:38:25|CMP|I didn't quite make it to zero, did I?
|135:38:25|CC|Ron, that's affirm.
|135:38:25|CMP|Okay. Caught that in time, anyway.

|135:38:25|CC|Hey, Ron, just a question, here. Pick up where you were briefing us there. Did you go to CMC AUTO after the solar corona, or did you get the GIMBAL LOCK light prior to going to AUTO.
|135:40:04|CMP|(Laughter) I got it prior to going to AUTO. I forgot to go to AUTO after the solar corona thing.
|135:40:04|CC|Okay. We've got you.
|135:40:04|CMP|The full cell purge and the waste water dump. Yes.
|135:40:04|CMP|I saw it before it tumbled the platform, though.
|135:40:04|CC|Roger. We've got you, and the platform looks good then, too?
|135:40:04|CMP|Oh, yes. The platform's okay.
|135:40:04|CMP|And if Enco's [?] timing his bit rate forces there, high bit rate was - I mean going to low bit rate is about 137=42 - was pretty - -
|135:40:04|CC|Okay. We copy that.
|135:40:04|CMP|... this thing. Okay. And then going to high bit rate, I've got the high bit at 137:50:30. And I hit LOW BIT RATE again at 138:08; went to HIGH BIT RATE at 138:14.
|135:42:05|CC|Roger, Ron. We copy those times.
|135:42:05|CC|Sounds like you might have got your heartbeat going good for your eat period. Is that right, Ron?
|135:43:17|CMP|(Laughter) Yes, might have. I'm going to have some peanut butter now, if you guys don't care.
|135:43:17|CC|Roger. It's your eat period.
|135:43:17|CMP|(Laughter) Okay.
|135:43:17|CC|At least he didn't forget this one. Ron, we've got some data here for you.
||||Tape 90B/3|Page 982
|135:43:17|CMP|Yes, that's right, by gosh. I've even got one scheduled. Go ahead.
|135:43:17|CC|We've got some data here for you, for - if you're planning on taking those red and blue filtered exposures across the landing site - if you want this information.
|135:43:17|CMP|Oh, yes. Okay; go ahead.
|135:43:17|CC|Okay, Ron. Here is - here it is. It's a Nikan [sic] - NK - November Kilo 55; VH - VW; mag X-ray X-ray. Okay. With the red-blue filtered exposure you want it at F/ll, 1/125, one frame each filter; F/ll, 1/250; one frame each filter. With no filter, expose at F/ll, 1/1000. And if you want to use the polarizing filter, expose at F/ll, 1/500 of a second.
|135:45:25|CMP|Okay. Looks like we'll bracket it, there: F/ll, 1/125, one frame on each filter; and F/ll at 1/250, one frame on each filter; and without a filter, one -F/ll at 1/1000; and polarizing F/ll at 1/500.
|135:45:25|CC|Okay. Here's a note that I'm not sure I understand totally, but let me read it to you. "Observe targets through viewfinder and shoot as desired with polarizing filter in different positions. Mark exposure time with polarizing filter as data analysis requires the incidence angle."
|135:45:25|CMP|Okay. So we need the GET time when we take the picture.
|135:45:25|CC|That's - that's affirm - with the polarizer.
|135:45:25|CMP|... Yes. Yes, with the polarizer. Right.
|135:45:25|CC|And there's another note here. Do not exceed 18 frames total for the above pictures. 18 frames total.
|135:45:25|CMP|Okay.
|135:45:25|CC|And your TCA - TCA is - for the landing site - is 138:39:11.
||||Tape 90B/4|Page 983
|135:45:25|CMP|Okay. TCA is 138:39:11.
|135:45:25|CC|And, Ron, if you'll just give us a MARK when you make the shot. That'll be close enough and we'll -we'll mark the time here on those polarizing ones. So we'll get the angle that way.
|135:47:22|CMP|Oh, okay.
|135:49:37|CMP|Lost the freaking camera.
|135:49:37|CC|Ron, we'd like ACCEPT on the computer. We have a new state vector for you. Your downtrack there got to be in excess of 30,000 feet, and this has nothing to do with your backside water dump just now - it's just accumulation of errors in the path.
|135:51:53|CMP|Oh, okay. You have ACCEPT.
|135:51:53|CC|Ron, it's your computer.
|135:51:53|CMP|Okay. Going to BLOCK.
|135:57:11|CC|Okay, Ron, anytime you want to reach up and go AUTO on the HIGH GAIN - your - your convenience.
|135:57:11|CMP|Okay. Stand by. Is it 1/500? Yes. Stand by.
|135:58:37|CMP|MARK it. And the polarizer all the way to the left. Stand by.
|135:58:45|CMP|MARK it. That's the polarizer all the way, counterclockwise.
|135:58:45|CC|Got you.
|135:58:45|CMP|Okay. That's eight pictures. Okay. Stand by. Okay. Wait a minute. I lost the landing site. Stand by. Okay. Stand by.
|135:59:34|CMP|MARK it. It's all the way to counterclockwise. Stand by.
|135:59:42|CMP|MARK it. And that's all the way clockwise.
||||Tape 90B/5|Page 984
|135:59:42|CC|Roger. We got them.
|135:59:42|CMP|Frame 23 and 24-1 mean - yes, 23 and 24; we're looking north along the ridges there. The other two polarizers - the two before that were looking at the landing site. Then I had three - three red ones at a 1/500 and 1/250 and a l/25th and the rest l6. And, the blue one's at the same thing.
|135:59:42|CMP|And we're setting on frame number 25 on mag XX -that's XX ...
|136:01:03|CC|Roger, Ron.
||||Tape 91B/1|Page 1005
|136:19:08|CMP|Oh, okay. Want me to configure the DSE, though, at 39:32 right?
|136:19:08|CC|That's affirmative.
|136:19:08|CMP|Okay.
|136:28:49|CMP|How's the crew of Challenger? Are they getting about ready to go out again?
|136:28:49|CC|They're a little bit delayed, Ron, but there's no problem. They just slept a little longer and -Yes, they're in their prep - pre-EVA prep.
|136:28:49|CMP|Yes .
|136:28:49|CC|And everything's going good.
|136:28:49|CMP|Bet they're going to find that Scarp is a pretty good hill.
|136:29:19|CC|Roger. We understand.
|136:29:19|CC|America, Houston. At your convenience, Ron - no hurry on this - we'd like you to service your ZPN sensors on each side there. We're getting some bad data on that now.
|136:29:19|CMP|'They're itching. (Laughter)
|136:29:19|CC|Roger.
|136:29:19|CMP|Yes, it's pretty dry.
|136:29:19|CC|Roger. The - Dr. Z. recommends you might find a new location for them - just move them around a little bit, and put some cream on the other ones.
|136:29:19|CMP|Okay.
||||Tape 91B/2|Page 1006
|136:29:19|CC|There's no hurry on that, Ron, I wouldn't interrupt what you're doing now to - for that - it's not critical.
|136:29:19|CMP|Okay, I understand, Bob. I'll - -
|136:29:19|CC|You sound like a tour - -
|136:29:19|CMP|I will as soon as I get a chance. Okay?
|136:29:19|CC|Roger. You sound like a tourist up there.
|136:29:19|CMP|(Laughter) That's right.
|136:29:19|CC|Going to need a Kodak store here shortly, I'm afraid.
|136:29:19|CMP|(Laughter)
|136:29:19|CC|Okay, Ron, you might want to look at your Flight Plan when you get a chance. We're coming up on a SIM bay reconfiguration here shortly.
|136:29:19|CMP|Ah-ha. Okay.
|136:29:19|CMP|56, 57, 58, 59 -
|136:35:02|CMP|MARK it. OFF.
|136:35:02|CC|Roger. We got it.
|136:35:02|CMP|... wherever that is.
|136:35:02|CMP|Okay. RECORDER is going OFF, not the HEATERS. RADAR is OFF. DATA SYSTEM is ON. Uh-oh. Should have the SM/AC POWER switch up - up there (laughter) at 230, as much as we use It.
|136:35:02|CC|Roger. I concur with that one. I thought it would only be in the simulation that it would get to you on that one.
|136:35:02|CDR|(Laughter) Yes. Okay. SM/AC POWER is ON. The old MAPPER's going to STANDBY. IR is going ON. SELF TEST is going to HEATERS. UV is going ON, Now, we're going to open IR and we're going to wait on UV.
||||Tape 91B/3|Page 1007
|136:37:19|CC|We concur with that, Ron.
|136:37:19|CMP|Okay.
|136:37:19|CC|We'll give you a cue on that UV COVER, OPEN, here.
|136:37:33|CMP|Okay, there's the IR. Barber pole. And a gray.
|136:37:33|CMP|Houston, America.
|136:37:33|CC|Go ahead, Ron.
|136:37:33|CMP|Okay. Are you going to try to ship the back-side DSE back in there for this next pass - on the Orbital science visuals and stuff?
|136:37:33|CC|Ron, we're calling for the DSE operation exactly as - as it is in the Flight Plan. Is that - do you concur with that?
|136:37:33|CMP|Oh, yes. I concur, but I mean - sure, that's -that's no problem there. But I mean getting it back to Houston before the end of the flight, you know.
|136:37:33|CC|Negative. That was not in the plans unless you want us to, Ron. We don't have any provision to - to - to record it and send it back here, until it comes back in the transcript form.
|136:37:33|CMP|Okay, no problem. I'll paraphrase what I say then, and when I get into AOS over there.
|136:37:33|CC|Okay. No sweat. And if you have something you really want us to listen to, we can bring up the loop to get It, but it takes a little effort, Ron. That's all.
|136:37:33|CMP|Okay. Yes. No, I - it's - let's don't do it, yet.
|136:37:33|CC|Ron, I just heard the voice quality has been real good. We've listened to it several different times, and it's been real good and we can bring it in without too much problem. Probably wouldn't be ready for the next rev, but we can get it In here without too much strain, if you want it brought in.
||||Tape 91B/4|Page 1008
|136:37:33|CMP|Okay. I think it might be worthwhile, especially on - on this particular one, where I'll be essentially talking all the way across, on this one.
|136:37:33|CC|Okay, we'll just plan on it, Ron.
|136:37:33|CMP|If it's not too much of a problem. Yes.
|136:40:32|CC|Okay, Ron. You can UV COVER, OPEN, anytime.
|136:40:32|CMP|... Okay. Okay.
|136:40:40|CMP|OFF, OPEN, barber pole. And it's gray.
|136:40:40|CC|Ron, we need to precondition our tanks again. We'd like tank 2 FANs to OFF, please.
|136:41:07|CMP|tank 2 FANs are OFF.
|136:41:07|CC|Roger.
|136:41:07|CC|And, Ron, just a reminder, ve will bring in that voice from the - the rev 27 backside pass.
|136:41:07|CMP|Oh, okay, good. Thank you. Tell the lunar sounder guys I'm sorry if I pointed their antenna in the wrong direction there, for a short period of time.
|136:41:07|CC|No problem. Just one question, Ron, that is the Hasselblad we're hearing every once in a while, isn't it?
|136:41:07|CMP|There's what?
|136:41:07|CC|Is that your camera running? Every once in a while?
|136:41:07|CMP|No, not now.
||||Tape 91B/5|Page 1009
|136:41:07|CC|How about during this eat period - on this pass, were you running the camera quite a bit?
|136:41:07|CMP|Wo. The only thing was - was the Nikon.
|136:41:07|CC|Okay, understand. We keep hearing something that sure sounds like the camera is chugging - -
|136:41:07|CMP|The - might have been picking up the tape re -no, it might have been the tape recorder. Might have been me, trying to clear my ears, you know?
|136:41:07|CC|No, I don't think so.
|136:45:29|CC|Ron, we're a few minutes from LOS. And you're looking real good.
|136:45:29|CMP|Okay, Robert. Thank you much. We'll see you on the other side.
|136:45:29|CC|Okeydoke. And I'll try and get through to the -the homefront here, maybe for this next pass. And you are going to be pretty busy, but I'll give you a little update.
|136:45:49|CMP|Okay.
|136:45:49||BEGIN LUNAR REV 27
|137:33:16|CMP|... it as well as the - some of the more Eratosthenian craters around Saenger. Looks to me like you can still have a little bit of a hint - at least of the layering, or a broken-up different-colored material at the top of all these craters.
|137:33:16|CMP|And supposed to stop and rewind the DSE. Forgot to do that.
|137:33:16|CC|Roger, Ron. We'll take care of the DSE.
|137:33:16|CMP|Okay. Okay, I'll let you do it.
||||Tape 91B/6|Page 1010
|137:33:16|CC|Roger, Ron.
|137:33:16|CMP|Okay.
|137:33:16|CMP|Okay. I took three, or four, pictures on mag 00 up to frame 104 kind of looking north across the Arabia.
|137:33:16|CC|Roger, Ron. We copy.
|137:33:16|CC|Ron. Just some words for you. We placed - -
|137:33:16|CMP|Okay, kind of a - Okay, go ahead.
|137:33:16|CC|No, go ahead - go ahead with yours. We don't want to interrupt.
|137:33:16|CMP|I was just going to say that on the crater Aitken, on the other side, is probably - there are no -no - rays - visible rays that I can see at the low Sun angle, anyhow, coming across there. There's definitely a mare floor in there. It's a dark albedo-type - flat floor with swirls in it; no definite expression of swirls. One thing that's quite apparent, you have a flow scarp in the northeast corner of it coming out of - oh, a little cloverleaf-type of an area there. I'm going to have to look the next pass over it to see if, on account of the south domical structure that's in there, it's breached. And I can't tell if the flow of material is flowing to the east out of that domical structure or if the flow is flowing into the domical structure. I ought to take a better look at that the next time - the next time around.
|137:37:11|CC|Roger. We got you. See any lava marks on the crater rims, there?
|137:37:11|CMP|Well, that's - that's the - the lava mark is what I'd call - is almost a lava scarp - in - up in the northeast corner. There are some lava marks along the central peak. They aren't nearly as apparent as the one up in the northeast corner. The northeast corner is definitely a flow front -a lava flow front, that has flown up the - the old interior wall of the crater.
||||Tape 91B/T|Page 1011
|137:37:11|CC|Roger, Ron. What's the color of the dome in Aitken?
|137:37:11|CMP|Well, the color of the dome in Aitken is - the colors are hard to - to visualize - the color of the dome is essentially the same as, as - pretty much the surrounding material around there. Maybe a little bit lighter - a little bit lighter than the surrounding material. Of course it's definitely lighter than the floor. The floor itself, to me, has a tan - had a tan to it.
|137:37:11|CC|Okay, Ron. We'll have to break away here a second. PAN CAMERA MODE to STANDBY.
|137:38:41|CMP|Okay.
|137:38:41|CC|If you haven't got your Plight Plan, it's PAN CAMERA MODE to STANDBY, then POWER ON.
|137:38:55|CMP|... Okay, POWER is going ON.
|137:38:55|CC|Okay, Ron. And it's time to charge battery A and we'll cue you on the PAN CAMERA POWER OFF. Okay, that should have been deleted. We've already charged the bat A, so - -
|137:38:55|CMP|... Yes. Yes. It's already charging.
|137:38:55|CC|Right. Sorry about that, Ron.
|137:38:55|CMP|Okay, no problem.
|137:39:17|CC|How about the freshness of the wall and ejecta materials, and the brightness of the rim deposits on Aitken while we have a minute here.
|137:39:17|CMP|Okay. The brightness of the rim deposits are a little bit brighter than the surrounding area on the thing. The way that you put It, probably early Eratosthenian. It's definitely not Copernican because I can't see - well, at least in that low Sun - I can't see any rays - any rays around it. But probably late Eratosthenian -somewhere in that area because you have the slumping - Well, it's not subdued at all. The walls themselves - of the crater are not subdued. They are fairly fresh - not as fresh as Copernican. And - and I just can't remember whether we had the - seems to me like it was brighter at the higher Sun angles around there, which indicate that there would still be some remnants of a -of a bright ring around it.
||||Tape 91B/8|Page 1012
|137:39:17|CC|Okay, Ron. And whenever you're ready, PAN CAMERA POWER to OFF.
|137:40:35|CMP|PAN CAMERA POWER is going OFF.
|137:40:35|CC|And -we're with all eyes here waiting for a Crisium-Serenitatis visual.
|137:40:35|CMP|(Laughter) Okay.
|137:40:35|CC|Anything at all, Ron, while we've got an open area, anything you want to say - we're following you on the map - just sing out.
|137:40:35|CMP|Okay.
|137:40:35|CC|Ron, while you're thinking here a second, do you have any views on the possible origin of the domes in Aitken?
|137:40:35|CMP|Well, I'm pretty sure they've got to be volcanic in origin. That's what - that's what it looks like to me anyhow. And especially if I can determine that the material in the northeast corner of Aitken has flown out of that domical little structure in there.
|137:40:35|CC|Roger. Understand.
|137:42:51|CMP|You know something - the observation that I think is pretty significant is the fact that most of the 30-kilometer craters on the back side of the Moon seem to be fairly fresh. And any of them that are fresh - by fresh I mean you don't have any real definite ray pattern to them, but you've got a real smooth - not smooth but streaked straight - slope, 45-degree angle going down into the crater and the crater wall. And then you get down to the bottom of the crater, and you got a flat floor down there or sometimes there is a domical type of a floor. And the domical material down there doesn't resemble anything like the stuff that's slumped down the side.
||||Tape 91B/9|Page 1013
|137:42:51|CC|Okay, we copy. Ron, if you're handy, you might hit Error RESET on the DSKY. It looks like you might have hit a MARK button or something.
|137:42:51|CMP|... Yes, might have hit the MARK button.
|137:42:51|CC|That - that makes it.
|137:42:51|CMP|Okay. I just got used to the other attitude, and now I'm at a different attitude. (Laughter) ... attitude, though.
|137:42:51|CC|Roger. Understand. Roger. Are you able to pick anything up on the Crisium yet?
|137:44:37|CMP|No, just now coming up on Crisium. I just now see it out of window 5È Just off the southern edge. Let me try window 3; I think it might be better.
|137:44:37|CC|Okay; you might remember we're looking for the colored tones , the shades between units up on Crisium, and we're looking for location of color boundaries relative to the mare ridge system.
|137:45:10|CMP|Okay, I'm looking at the eastern edge of Crisium now. As you come across there, it looks there might be - a little bit darker - You know, I keep seeing browns all the time up here instead of grays - gray tones. Maybe that's just the way I interpret them. They are - to me kind of a brownish tint to them, and it's a darker brown than the - the stuff to the - to the south of the ridge system there.
|137:45:10|CC|Roger. Ron, our data would show that CM5 might be a better window.
|137:45:10|CMP|Take a look at that one. Yes, it's a little better. Looking straight down. I am just now passing that crater I took a picture of on the last time - of the pass on there. And instead of having a round bottom, it's got a diamond-shape fill in the bottom. And the diamond, Itself, is about - oh, a half of the crater diameter. And this is on the south rim of Crisium.
||||Tape 91B/10|Page 1014
|137:45:10|CC|Okay. We copy. Does the ridge system cross the color boundary, Ron, in Crisium?
|137:46:52|CMP|Well, this ridge system is running east and west down here. The color boundary isn't nearly as apparent in Crisium as it is in Serenitatis. Except that right under me right now there's kind of a subdued crater-type thing and with a southern part of a ridge. The ridge runs east - west, and it looks like we've got a flow coming out of it. Let me see if I can get a quick picture of that one. Well, lost my camera (laughter). Here it is. Oh, it's too late; it's gone now. You know something, you see this subsolar point, it's kind of -zero phase - zero phase point, I mean, is following me right along out here in Crisium, so I get a different color straight out from the window than I do out from the edge of it. So I think that's going to influence my thinking.
|137:46:52|CC|Roger, Ron. How does color of Picard - the rim deposits on Picard compare to the surrounding mare material there?
|137:48:35|CMP|Okay. The color on Picard is - is definitely darker. It's got a darker rim, darker material that goes out to - oh about a half a crater and some points extending out to a crater diameter. And then from south arcing around to the west to -to the northwest corner, you got some light-colored material on top of that.
|137:48:35|CC|Is any of that tan or brown?
|137:48:35|CMP|It's kind of a - the darker material I'd call tannish-gray. More gray than tan. In other words, the whole mare, itself, I'd consider kind of a - kind of a light tan. And then the type of material, the dark material that's flowing out -has flown out - is kind of a tannish-gray.
|137:48:35|CC|Okay. In the inner appearances of Picard, for color variations, can you determine different units based on color and flow characteristics?
||||Tape 91B/11|Page 1015
|137:49:42|CMP|Yes, you can. In the area where you have the white thrown out on top, you essentially got a -as - as you go down the crater wall, you've got a white streak that goes all the way around it, and then you've got a dark layer underneath that. And then a white layer on below that.
|137:49:42|CC|Roger. Are you saying the color zones are concentric?
|137:49:42|CMP|Yes, the color zones are concentric going around.
|137:49:42|CC|Beautiful. How about the central peak material to that of the crater walls?
|137:50:30|CMP|Well, the central peak material is - you know, it's more smooth-type stuff. This stuff in the crater walls is - fine, straight sloping, except where it is slumped down. Where it's slumped down, it's just kind of piled up - a jumble of -type stuff, you know?
|137:50:30|CC|Roger.
|137:50:30|CMP|You know, in the crater nearest over there has the same color distinction around it for - out for about a crater diameter, except it doesn't have any of the light material on it at all.
|137:50:30|CC|Okay, Ron, we might direct your attention to the dark halo craters in the western Mare Crisium. Are they impact or volcanic in origin?
|137:50:30|CMP|You can see some of the rays from the crater Proclus have spread out all the way across here. And they completely cover up the ridge system that goes around there, so I can't see any color distinction on the eastern - or on the western edge of Crisium.
|137:50:30|CC|Roger. We copy. How about those dark halo craters? Are they volcanic in origin?
||||Tape 91B/12|Page 1016
|137:51:40|CMP|Some of the - Yes, I was looking at the volcanic -or the dark-rimmed craters, and some of them have what I'd call a - an ejecta pattern around them; and the others just have kind of a raised rim with no apparent blocks. The one to the west - let's see, southwest - of that little V that sticks out there by Yerkes - that hill that sticks out there by Yerkes - now, that's the one that, to me, looks like it has an ejecta pattern around it with blocks It's about a - oh, a thousand-meter crater.
|137:51:40|CC|Roger. Got it. Oh that crater that you mentioned was a flow pattern, will you be sure and make a mark on your map on that, please? We're really interested in that.
|137:51:40|CMP|Okay.
|137:51:40|CC|Should be coming up on Macrobius by now, aren't you?
|137:53:07|CMP|Yes, I can just barely see Macrobius. And - ... be better out of window 3.
|137:53:07|CC|Okay. We're standing by.
|137:53:07|CMP|I'm looking for any dark-halo craters in - I was looking for any dark-halo .craters in this area that might be sticking through the Proclus rays. Well, you know, you compare on either side of the Proclus ray, though, and the same size crater rather ... Tranquilitatis or the - the moundy stuff before you get to Tranquilitatis are really underneath Coper - the - the Proclus ray. You get the same albedo of ray material from the small craters in either case.
|137:53:07|CC|Roger. We understand.
|137:54:12|CMP|Oh, here's a Macrobius A and B. Course, J-3 is up there. The two dark craters - well, the one just - north, I guess, of Macrobius A, and also north of J-3 - that's the one that has the dark mound around it. It's got a small dome down in the center. It - it doesn't have any ejecta pattern around it - you know, no rays, no nothing. To me, that looks like - it sure looks like a cinder cone to me. You get that same type of feeling. The dark halo that goes around it goes out for at least a crater and a half diameter. The raised dome down in the center of the crater is about a fourth of a crater diameter. And there are no rays. And it has a dark halo.

|137:54:12|CC|See any color tones on that crater at all, Ron?
|137:56:05|CMP|Yes, the color on that particular - color of that is the same color as you see in Maraldi and as you see in the landing site. And that is what I consider the dark tannish - tannish gray.
||||Tape 92B/1|Page 1037
|137:55:01|CMP|Yes, the color on that particular - the color cf that is the same color as you see in Maraldi and as you see in the - the landing site. And that is what I - what I consider the dark - tannish -tannish-gray type of material. And again, the fresh craters around Maraldi still look kind of bluish to me, not as much as they did yesterday, but they still look kind of a - have a bluish tint to them from the reflection of the Sun. In other words, they are fresh craters and they are about the size of - one of them is about the size of MOCR, and the other one is about the size of Sherlock or Camelot.
|137:55:01|CC|Okay. You're around Maraldi now ... - -
|137:55:01|CMP|... same way. Yes, I'm still on Maraldi. Yes.
|137:55:01|CC|Okay - -
|137:55:01|CMP|I was on Maraldi, and - -
|137:55:01|CC|How about comparing the floor fill of Maraldi to the light plains In Maraldi E?
|137:55:01|CMP|The floor fill in Maraldi is definitely a darker color. The light plains in Maraldi E are the -the light-tan material. And Maraldi - The floor of Maraldi looks just like the landing site.
|137:55:01|CC|How about the color, tone, and texture of Maraldi Gamma?
|137:57:44|CMP|Okay. Maraldi Gamma looks just like the rest of all of the surrounding hills around there. I think that's just a - some of the - what do you call it, the Sculptured Hills type of material that has been - was high and has been inundated by mare flow at one time or another. It had - mare flows kind of come up around it.
|137:57:44|CC|Okay. How about the domical hills inside of Vitruvius A, as compared to Aitken?
||||Tape 92B/2|Page 1038
|137:57:44|CMP|Okay. I just missed that one. We'll have to pet that one on the way by.
|137:57:44|CC|Okay.
|137:58:23|CMP|Next time I guess. Right now, I'm looking at the ridge system around the annulus of Serenitatis. And the dark material stops before you get up to -Oh, what's the crater that sticks into the side of Serenitatis and sticks out beyond the eastern edge of Serenitatis? Anyhow, the dark material stops before you get to there. The dark material only goes up to - let's see - There's a definite rllle. There's a wrinkled ridge and at the east of the wrinkled ridge, there are two craters, about 20 kilometers in diameter. And then farther east of that is the - the rille. A graben, it looks like that goes up - and that's about the extent of the dark area that's the same as the - the same material as the landing site.
|137:58:23|CC|Roger. We copy.
|137:58:23|CC|Okay, Ron. That - that completes the visuals on this pass. We - if you want to look some more, we've got some time. We do have some Flight Plan camera pads and all that, but no hurry on any of it.
|137:58:23|CC|We do have some attitude changes - -
|137:58:23|CMP|- - continue looking here until we pass - oh, do you need an attitude change now?
|137:58:23|CC|No, that's not until 46. We got some time on that. It's a VERB - change of NOUN 78.
|137:58:23|CMP|Okay. Give me a clue about a minute ahead of that,.
|137:58:23|CC|Yes, I'll do that, Ron. Just keep talking.
|138:00:09|CMP|Okay. We're in the Tacquet area now, and in this case, the wrinkled ridge system that's out in the middle does not make a change in the color boundary. The color boundary is completely out to the outer edge and is - in the area of those - the rille. Those are - There's kind of arcuate rilles, straight rilles, and in the Tacquet, yesterday, I said this was Sulpicius Callus, but it's Tacquet - Tacquet area, but ... - -
||||Tape 92B/3|Page 1039
|138:00:09|CC|Roger, Ron. Can you give us a color difference on the dark mantle and the mare at this Sun angle?
|138:01:07|CMP|Yes, the color difference - again the - You know, I just - I just now noticed that when I get down at this Sun angle, out in front of me, I got one color, and then I look straight down and I have a different color. But in this Tacquet area, you've definitely got some cinder cone type - No, I don't want to say cinder cone, but anyhow - volcanic. And it almost looks like a breached cinder cone right next to - I think it's Melrose [?] - is the name of that - that crater - the big one that's right on the edge of Serenitatis. I'll find it on the map and mark it for sure. But just to the east of that, it sure looks like a breached cinder cone in - in - in one of those rilles down there. And then that type of material is - is - kind of a dark tan in - at this Sun angle. And it's definitely darker than the - than the Serenitatis Basin material.
|138:01:07|CC|I think it's Tacquet is the name of that crater. Isn't it, Ron?
|138:01:07|CMP|Tacquet is the little one, and then - then there's a bigger one right next to Tacquet.
|138:01:07|CC|Okay. Menelaus is just to the east of Tacquet there.
|138:03:04|CC|Hey, Ron, I - I blew that. Menelaus is west of Tacquet up there.
|138:03:04|CMP|Yes, Menelaus; that's the one.
|138:03:04|CC|Any textural difference between the dark mantle in the site and the Sulpicius Callus formation, Ron?
|138:03:04|CMP|Yes, there is.
||||Tape 92B/4|Page 1040
|138:03:04|CC|Would you attribute it to the actual ground or would you attribute it to possibly the Sun angle difference?
|138:03:04|CMP|I think, I would attribute it really to the - to the actual ground. I guess what I am going to have to do is really wait until the Sun angle gets a little bit higher there in that Tacquet region to answer that for sure. But it seems to me like the - the material in the landing site area is -is more smooth, you know, or smoother than what's in the Tacquet region. The part in the Tacquet region seemed to me like it was - is - It's just a rougher-looking-type material. You know, not - not massive. Hey. There's D - D-Caldera. Hey, what do you know?
|138:05:06|CC|Do you have - do have any dark - do you have any dark halo craters near Sulpicius Gallus?
|138:05:06|CMP|Yes. The - I'll be darned.
|138:05:06|CC|We're - we're with bated breath, waiting.
|138:05:06|CMP|... Picture 28 of D-Caldera with the Hasselblad. I mean with the Nikon (laughter), and Sun angle must be about 1 or 2 degrees.
|138:05:06|CC|Roger. We copy.
|138:05:06|CMP|You know, I really didn't concentrate too much on - on Sulpicius Gallus at that - that particular passing, I was concentrating on the Tacquet area, and in that - in that case, all of the - the rilles and the ridges - not the wrinkled ridges out in the middle out in there, but the rilles and the area built up around the rilles and also associated maybe - Oh, I was going to say 10 times the will -the rilles width is all one color.
|138:05:06|CC|Okay, Ron. We'd like HIGH GAIN to AUTO, and we'd like to load your NOUN 78.
|138:06:41|CMP|Okay. HIGH GAIN to AUTO. Let me see, 22 NOUN 70 to ENTER. Okay. Let's see, plus 5?.25- Plus 52.25. Up-1ink. VERB 58 ENTER. ... PROCEED to ... gets out of the way. Okay. D-Caldera was taken on picture number 28. It was f/8 at 1/500, and then I took three more before that. They're terminator photos, looking north across Sulpicius Gallus and farther north. And they were 1/500 at f/l6 to start with and then f/11.

|138:06:41|CC|Roger, Ron.
|138:06:41|CMP|That's probably about all I'm allowed, I think, on this XX film.
|138:06:41|CC|What was your last frame number on XX, Ron?
|138:06:41|CMP|Yes, that was - I'm on number 29 now.
|138:06:41|CC|29- Roger. You're on 29, right here.
|138:06:41|CMP|Say, on magazine Oscar Oscar, did we get enough of our required photos out of that, or are the rest of those - opportunity or not?
|138:06:41|CC|We'll check on that with FAO, Ron. I do have one Flight Plan update for you on the pan camera photo pad. But you first ought to go to the IMAGE MOTION, INCREASE, barber pole plus four steps, to ON, and LASER ALTIMETER, ON.
|138:06:41|CMP|Right now, you mean?
|138:06:41|CC|Yes, it's - It's time, Ron. It's time for that.
|138:09:35|CMP|Okay. IMAGE MOTION - let's see - I think that was barber pole plus three before. There it is, 3 - 4 -
|138:09:56|CMP|LASER ALTIMETER, ON.
|138:09:56|CC|Okay, Ron. That pan camera - -
|138:09:56|CMP|I hope to pick up some answers to some of t,hos--.o things on a couple more pasties. Okuy. That's right. Go ahead.
|138:09:56|CC|Okay. Did - did it bother you, me - me reading some of those questions to you? I know you'd probably had time to study them, but I thought I'd jog your memory on them.
||||Tape 92B/6|Page 1042
|138:09:56|CMP|Oh, no. That's - no, that's good. I appreciate it.
|138:09:56|CC|Okay. I'll get a conference here with Farouk before we start the next pass on the next- rev around and see if we can improve it. Things worked perfect down here. We - I had the questions in front of me, and Farouk flipped them into the screen and it really worked great.
|138:09:56|CC|Okay, Ron - -
|138:09:56|CMP|Yes. That's good, okay.
|138:10:44|CC|- - at l4l:50, I've got the pan camera photo pad.

|138:10:54|CC|Good show, Ron. It's - your bird now for a while.
|138:10:54|CMP|Okay.
|138:12:37|CC|Ron, just for your information, we're playing back the voice playback from the last rev, and it'll be recorded in house. It is readable, and we can read it.
|138:12:37|CMP|Oh, okay. Good. I purposely tried to keep one of the microphones right on my mouth on those things. I don't know if that helps or hinders it .
|138:12:37|CC|Roger, Ron - -
|138:12:37|CMP|At least I could hear myself talk that way.
|138:12:37|CC|Roger. It worked. We can read it, and somebody can listen to it here when we get a chance. How about on this back side of this next rev? Looks like you're pretty busy with some pads and - and some photo work in there. Do you expect to be doing any recording - much recording there?
||||Tape 92B/7|Page 1043
|138:12:37|CMP|No, probably not. I'll just try to - try to make notes of it or something, and then pass it on out when I come out the other side.
|138:12:37|CC|Good show, Ron. Good show.
|138:14:07|CC|And your - your grounded friends down there are busy working around the LM right now and doing some loading the Rover and that, getting ready for the EVA-2 work. They're out on the surface and loading the Rover.
|138:14:07|CMP|Very good. I'll be glad to - curious to know if they can make it up that hill or not - to Scarp.
|138:14:07|CC|Roger.
|138:14:07|CMP|Looks like they should be able to go right up that valley, the way they've got it planned there.
|138:14:07|CC|Gene's got to take some time here on this EVA and make a fender. We're - we're piecing together a couple of maps and trying to get a fender, because they lost a piece of the fender last night.
|138:14:07|CMP|(Laughter) They did, huh?
|138:14:07|CC|We're going to give Gene his auto mechanic's license if it works.
|138:14:57|CMP|How's my - yes, right. How's my ZPN? All I did was move it. I didn't put in a new sensor yet. Do I need to put on a new sensor?
|138:17:34|CC|Ron, the ZPN data isn't too good. It's the sensor sponges need to be replaced, if you didn't already replace them.
|138:17:34|CMP|(Laughter) Thought I'd get by without replacement. Yes, I'll replace them pretty quick.
|138:17:34|CC|Hey - you know - your choice. We can - we can stand the crew exercise period without replacing them, I'm sure.
||||Tape 92B/8|Page 1044
|138:17:34|CMP|Okay. While I was eating my peanut butter awhile ago, I lost my lobster bisque and my Juice. And I just now found it.
|138:19:08|CC|Okay, Ron. Here's your word on some magazines here X-ray X-ray has to be left for the Zodiacal light. You - you should not take any more on X-ray X-ray until after Zodiacal light. Mag Oscar Oscar and Papa Papa are yours to play with, as long as you stay with the Flight Plan on the rest of the mags .
|138:19:08|CMP|Okay.
|138:19:08|CC|And those are your crew options for the rest of the mission, those two mags.
|138:19:08|CMP|Okay. In other words, we made it up on Oscar Oscar, I guess, on that one pass, huh? Rest of them are - are crew options.
|138:19:08|CC|Roger.
|138:25:38|CC|Hey, Ron. You got a 110 heart rate. What are you doing?
|138:25:38|CMP|(Laughter) Shaking the couch.
|138:25:38|CC|(Laughter) I thought we could hear that. That's pretty good.
|138:25:38|CMP|Shaking the couch (laughter).
|138:26:19|CC|Okay. Keep it up, there; you got 120 now. Dr. Berry would like to keep it there for a while.
|138:26:19|CMP|(Laughter) I'm getting tired.
|138:26:19|CC|That's the whole idea of the thing, Ron.

||||Tape 92B/9|Page 1045
|138:31:47|CC|Hate to say this, because it's very dead serious work, but I'm kind of watching a lunar comedy as the - the two lunar stalwarts are trying to plan the new fender on the vehicle down there.
|138:31:47|CMP|(Laughter) I'll bet that's really no easy job, you know.
|138:31:47|CC|That's right. They've got a couple of their clamps - what they did is they - -
|138:31:47|CMP|... kind of hard.
|138:31:47|CC|They took a couple of their clamps, and they took -taped together in the cockpit a couple of their big lunar maps - the big heavy maps - and they're - now they're clamping that map to the fender where the removable part is.
|138:31:47|CMP|Oh, I see. Must be pretty dusty down there or something.
|138:32:33|CC|Yes. Well, they lost a fender, and it was throwing dust up on Gene. It's just ridiculous how much dust they got on them, so they - they just decided they just had to go ahead and do something.
|138:32:33|CMP|Yes.
|138:32:33|CC|I would hate to be paying for that fender repair job by the minute.
|138:32:33|CMP|(Laughter) Boy, that's for sure.
|138:32:33|CC|Oh, that was me - went off on the wrong loop, - loop there, Ron.
|138:32:33|CMP|Oh, okay. (Laught er) Okay.
|138:32:33|CMP|On that Crisium Serenitatis - number 4 of 5 - that - dark dome just to the northwest of J-3 - the one I was talking about that had the typical cone-type shape with the dome down in the side of it.

|138:32:33|CMP|Yes. Okay. Okay.
|138:40:45|CC|Just talked to the home front a little while ago, and everybody's fine, Ron. And they were able to get the squawk boxes squared away, so she should have been listening to you for last couple of passes - all on the ... The problem was it wasn't able to shut off one loop or the other, so today we've been - they've been able to get all - just the CSM loop in there for - during the AOS periods.
|138:40:45|CMP|Oh, I see. Otherwise, they - they were both coming in, huh?
|138:40:45|CC|Yes. Last night, they were both coming in. Today, they got it squared away, so you're just coming in, and they are able to watch and listen to the other one on - on the TV camera.
|138:40:45|CMP|Yes. TV, yes.
|138:40:45|CC|And they say they are looking forward to good weather tomorrow. Supposed to finally get a break in this stuff tomorrow.

|139:29:50|CMP|Houston, America.
|139:29:50|CC|Go.ahead, Ron.
|139:29:50|CMP|Okay, Robert. I guess the big thing I want to report from the back side on this one here is that I took another look at the - the Cloverleaf in Aitken, with the binocs, and that southern, domical crater of the Cloverleaf - it has a breach on the east - east side of it. it - I can't tell -There's - there's a flow - In other words, the domical structures, themselves, are part of a flow material that is partially filled up the breach. In other words, the breach has either flowed into that little domical structure before the domes were built, or else all of that stuff that's in the mare floor has flown out of that domical structure before the domes came in. In other words, the domical structures, themselves, are different time relationship to the floor, itself. They are - are younger than the floor, itself.
|139:29:50|CC|Roger, Ron. We copy that.
|139:35:20|CC|Ron, is there a difference in the color between the dome and the mare in Aitken, there?
|139:35:20|CMP|Yes, there - yes, there is. The dome-type material is - the colors again are very hard, you know? I'm just going to have to say that it's - it's slightly darker than the mare floor - is the way it looks to me, right at this point in time. Also, the texture is a coarser texture than the floor itself. In other words, the floor, to me, is kind of a standard mare flat-floor-type stuff. And I have to compare the texture of the domical hills to - Oh - I guess what I would imagine is some of the dacite flows that I've seen out in California. You know, the heavy viscous-type flows.

|139:35:20|CC|Roger. We copy there, Ron.
|139:35:20|CC|That's good data on Aitken there, Ron. Those color differences any - on any of these things - that color is one of the most important things you can give us. We'll be all ears for that. È
|139:35:20|CMP|Okay. I'll try to - The trouble with colors, I'm finding out, is that - it's sure a function of the Sun angle as to what color it appears to your eye.
|139:35:20|CC|Roger. We can believe that. We just - we'll - -
|139:35:20|CMP|... passes. Yes.
|139:37:41|CMP|You know, you take a look at the central peak of Neper, and on the south and western edge of it, you get the vertical stripes in it or streaking like you get off of the massifs in the landing site area. And then, you look at the area around in the rim - around the rim of Neper, and you get the corncob - I guess - or Sculptured Hill-type of appearance.

|139:40:11|CC|Roger. Understand. Condorcet Hotel.
|139:40:11|CMP|Condor - Condorcet Alfa - it's either got a landslide - I'll get a picture of that the next time with - with the other frame, but it's either got a landslide on it, or it's had a - And it doesn't look like a crater on the side of the wall, on the northwest wall of the crater.
|139:40:11|CC|Okay. We copy that. Northwest wall of Condorcet A
|139:40:11|CMP|That's a - the area is oval or ellipse shape. Of course, the top of the ellipse is toward the top of the crater. And it looks like it's - almost gets a flow out of the bottom of the ellipse, which is about a fourth of the way up from the bottom of the crater.
|139:40:11|CC|Ron, can you give me a scale on the size of that flow, as compared to the rest of the crater?
|139:40:11|CMP|Uhhh. The - the hole or the slope or the slide, or whatever you want to call it, down through there, is maybe one-eighth of the crater diameter. And the floor area is only just a real small portion of one-eighth size. it's a ... - -
|139:40:11|CC|You seeing any lineaments in the area? Any lineaments in the area?
|139:40:11|CMP|Yes. There was some lineaments on the area - in the area; and again, they're vertical-type lineaments or lineations kind of like the - the downslope - operations of most ... craters.
|139:40:11|CC|Roger.

|139:45:34|CMP|They're fresher ones. Okay, let's see. We're going to Picard and then on up to - Yerkes - Where's Yerkes? There it is. Okay. Let's see where we're aiming at, here. Okay, is it about time, does it look like?
|139:45:34|CC|Roger. You can start at - you're just about 30 seconds from starting on Picard, And like you said on the map, you go up - you go up Picard, after you start up Picard X, there, and you go on up through Picard and Yerkes and that - -
|139:45:34|CMP|Okay.
|139:45:34|CC|- - that front there, up at Yerkes' area. That's the Yerkes. Right above there is where you change to f/11.
|139:45:34|CMP|Okay. Okay, here we go.
|139:46:21|CMP|Started it, Picard X,
|139:46:21|CMP|Works better when you take the slide out.
|139:46:21|CC|If you'll give me kind of a call at what you're aiming at, like Picard X and Picard, I can give you a call on those f-stops, Ron.
|139:46:21|CMP|Okay. I just passed Picard X; and then the one west of that. *** what it was. The next - about half the size of Picard X. Hey, does this go right through Picard? Or south of it?
|139:46:21|CC|No, it goes right through dead center of Picard.
|139:46:21|CMP|Okay. We!ll get it.
|139:47:43|CMP|Sure hope that color difference shows up in - on Picard.
|139:47:43|CC|Roger. We hope so9 too.
|139:47:43|CMP|There's black material - now - get on up here -you get on up here5 the darker tannish-gray material covers essentially from the east all the way around to the south. it goes outside the rim as well as inside the rim. it drapes over the rim. That can't be a shadow effect.
||||Tape 93B/5|Page 1106
|139:47:43|CC|Have you taken Picard yet, Ron?
|139:47:43|CMP|Just now. Just one more, and I'll be through with Picard. Change to what?
|139:47:43|CC|No, not yet. You don't change it until you get on the other side of Yerkes, up there. Your path goes directly between Yerkes and ... - -
|139:47:43|CMP|Okay. Let me go to f/ll.
|139:47:43|CC|No. Don't change to f/ll until you're at Yerkes.
|139:47:43|CMP|Yes, okay. Until I get to the other side of Yerkes.
|139:47:43|CMP|I can still see those dark halo craters down there. I'm going to have to look at them with the binocs sometime.
|139:47:43|CC|Roger.
|139:47:43|CC|Okay. When you're at Yerkes there, you want to switch to f/ll. Just - -
|139:47:43|CMP|Okay.
|139:47:43|CC|And looking west, you'll go right through Proclus.
|139:47:43|CMP|Okay.
|139:47:43|CMP|Now, what comes after Proclus?
|139:47:43|CC|Okay. You just keep pressing on up through -through - up in towards Maraldi. You go up through Proclus, and then Proclus D; and at that point, you'll change to f/5.6 and then get - get into the Maraldi N, across the maria there; and the mare of Tran - Tranquillity.
||||Tape 93B/6|Page 1107
|139:47:43|CMP|Oh, okay.
|139:47:43|CMP|It's sure easy to see why that - ray excluded zone shows up on the pictures because, to me, it's -it's a tan Sculptured Hill-type material - where -in the ray excluded zone of Proclus.
|139:47:43|CC|Okay, Ron. The - this pass continues and you change to 5-6 up there at Proclus D at the mare/ highland contact at Proclus - up around Proclus and Franz.
|139:53:13|CMP|Okay. it's about now. Change to 5-6. Getting out into the mare.
|139:53:13|CC|Okay. You go right across the Mare - Maraldi M and Maraldi D, and across Vitruvius A and Vitruvius.
|139:53:13|CMP|Oh. Okay. it's a little closer in, then.
|139:53:32|CC|And, at Vitruvius again - -
|139:53:32|CMP|At - Okay, Vitruvius? Yes, okay; f/4. You know, if you can look up on your map, it looks like there's kind of a subdued ... almost submerged crater, between - I mean just east of Vitruvius A. And that - that domical mounds that are sticking up around there are the same type of structures as Maraldi Gamma. And that's what lead me to believe that - you know - it's just some old jumbled-up-type stuff that was here before the mare.
|139:53:32|CC|Roger. We copy.
|139:53:32|CMP|That has a completely - it has a completely different - texture to it than the domical structures of Aitken.
|139:53:32|CC|Okay. We got that.
||||Tape 93B/7|Page 1108
|139:53:32|CC|Okay. Have you gotten up over, vertical over Vitruvius? If you are, that's where you go to f/4.
|139:53:32|CMP|Not quite. I'm in Vitruvius A, right now.
|139:53:32|CC|Okay. Good show.
|139:53:32|CMP|And I just took a peak at it with the binocs and -Let's see, I'm 5*6 at 1/250. And that's a different type of material. it looks like it's a - it almost has to be a slump-type of operation. Somehow, it gets piled up down in the middle. But they're a smoother, more subdued type of domical structures than the ones in Aitken. Okay. Switching to f/4 - -
|139:53:32|CC|Roger; f/4 - -
|139:53:32|CMP|- - 1/250.
|139:53:32|CC|Your track goes right across the mare - the mare there between Tranquillity and Serenity - right across Dawes, and ends at just to the east and north of Plinius. On that - -
|139:53:32|CMP|Okay.
|139:53:32|CC|- - that appears to be the boundary between Tranquillity and Serenity.
|139:53:32|CMP|No, when I take a look at it from this angle, you even get a different - the - the ejecta from Plinius kind of covers up the rilles and the annulus around Serenitatis.
|139:57:29|CMP|Now, we're getting into a relatively low Sun. And Serenitatis is a lot lighter colored than the -the light tan, to me. And then you Ñ in the low Sun, you look out into Tranquillitatis, across Plinius, and that demarcation turns out to be the same - same kind of gray-tan. You know, it's a darker -
||||Tape 93B/8|Page 1109
|139:57:29|CC|But there is a color difference between Serenity and Tranquillitatis, there?
|139:57:29|CMP|Yes. There's a definite color difference between Tra - and it almost looks like - If you could stand on color alone, the color from Tranquillitatis extends on over, and covers into - you know, kind of drapes over the edge and covers up part Serenity.
|139:57:29|CC|Okay. We got that. Well, that should be all of your photos there, on that pass, Ron.
|139:57:29|CMP|Oh, okay. (Laught er)
|139:57:29|CC|And, Ron, before we get into the visual, here, we'd like HIGH GAIN, AUTO.
|139:58:40|CMP|Okay. HIGH GAIN -
|139:58:40|CC|And, can you give me --
|139:58:40|CMP|... away from the window, here.
|139:58:40|CC|- - a magazine report on that two pictures?
|139:58:40|CMP|Okay. We're magazine Lima Lima. And it's 129-
|139:58:40|CMP|Yes, we're at the same Sun angle, and there's no doubt about it from Tacquet on up to Mel something or other, there's a group of small rilles in there, and those rilles have got ejected material, around and up and over the rilles. And not - not impact-type ejecta. it's got to be a volcanic ejecta of some kind up and around there. it's a dark brown -a darker brown, than the tan of Serenitatis.
|139:58:40|CC|Roger. You're referring to the Menulus [sic] rilles, there, right to the west of Tacquet, right? That's to the west of Tacquet? Still, it looks like it's in the Serenitatis - Serenitatis Basin, right on the edge of it.
||||Tape 93B/9|Page 1110
|140:01:13|CC|Roger. We see -them.
|140:01:13|CMP|And then they kind of st - they stop just even with Mel whatever it is. (Laughter) Malinius or something like that.
|140:01:13|CC|Not Melinius or Menelaus? Pick your pick.
|140:01:13|CMP|Yes. Okay.
|140:01:36|CC|You see a ray coming out of Menelaus going through -through Bessel? is that one of Tycho's rays?
|140:01:36|CMP|It disappeared. I couldn't - couldn't see that one.
|140:01:36|CC|Roger.
|140:01:36|CMP|Take a look the next time around.
|140:01:36|CC|That was my question. I was just curious.
|140:01:36|CMP|Yes. I know it shows it on the map there, and I haven't really got a good - a good clear picture of a ray, yet.
|140:01:36|CC|I'm going to be more interested to see it - -
|140:01:36|CMP|I'll look for it for sure the next time.
|140:01:36|CC|Ñ - I want to - more interested to see if you can see the alleged crater Arabia on this next pass-
|140:01:36|CMP|(Laughter) I've been looking for that every pass. And - there's a lot of depressions - and ridges and - hills around there. it's hard to - see, you don't really get a big picture view of it. You get a little piece of it at a time. And I think, in order to really con - convince yourself that you got something there, you're going to have to get - get off - away from it. And - -
|140:01:36|CC|Roger. Understand.
|140:01:36|CMP|*** D-Caldera is sure a depression. Like nothing I've ever seen before.
||||Tape 93B/10|Page 1111
|140:01:36|CC|Got you. You're going to get a chance to get some pictures of that next - next rev.
|140:01:36|CMP|Next rev? Okay, they ought to be good ones because the Sun angle is going to be pretty good. But, at this point, you get a dark tan, kind of a mare-type material - it's in mare-type materials And then it's a light gray down in the D-Caldera itself. Sure looks like a "D" all right. But it's a light gray down in there. And then it's got burnps that stick up, and the burnps themselves are - I want to look at it again for sure. But I get the impression the burnps, themselves, are the light tan material.
|140:04:59|CC|Okay. Understand. The burnps are light tan. Right?
|140:04:59|CMP|Whereas, down - Yes, the burnps are light tan. And down between the burnps that are down in the Caldera, it looks like a rough - real rough blocky - gray material.
|140:04:59|CMP|Bob, I hope you're keeping me honest on the Flight Plan. I got my head out the window. I can't follow the Flight Plan.
|140:04:59|CC|Affirmative. All you got is, in about 4 minutes, or 3 minutes, now, you pick up orbital science visuals on Copernicus. And we'll just stay with you on those orb science visuals right through Reiner Gajrnna. And at 143:12, you've got a rather rapid time, you might want to quit early. You got the LOI [sic] canister change. Then you got a P52. So, your choice on that. I'll call you right at 143:12, if that's what you want.
|140:06:13|CMP|Okay, yes. Give me a call right there, because I got to get ready for this - I'll do the PJ2 first, so you all can see it, then I can always change that canister.
|140:06:13|CC|Yes, okay. We'll concur on that; but just don't forget it.
|140:06:13|CMP|Okay.
||||Tape 93B/11|Page 1112
|140:06:13|CC|Ron, you're coming up on Copernicus; I might read you some of these questions. One of them was, "Study the floor of Copernicus, and compare its material to that on the walled terraces." The other one is, "When viewed from the opposite direction, is there an extension of the structure in the middle central peak?" I guess that we refer to that as what might be a dike In that middle central peak. And "What is the nature of that structure?"
|140:06:13|CMP|Okay. I think those things are going to be kind of hard to see. But we'll try.
|140:06:13|CC|The back room would like you to kind of concentrate on looking on that dike, if it is at all possible, Ron. Even if you have to use - -
|140:06:13|CMP|Okay. I'll --
|140:06:13|CC|- - even if you have to use the binoculars.
|140:06:13|CMP|- - get the ole binocs, here. Okay.
|140:08:25|CC|If you want to feel for some scale on that, just a reminder: the crater is about 3 kilometers deep, and the central peak is 400 meters high, Ron.
|140:08:25|CMP|400 meters. Okay.
|140:08:25|CMP|Is this Eratosthenes I'm passing over now? 1 hope.
|140:08:25|CC|Yes. You should be just about over Eratosthenes right now.
|140:09:57|CMP|1 hope it's Eratosthenes because the old Sun's shining right on my rendezvous light, out here.
|140:09:57|CC|Roger.
|140:09:57|CMP|And you can't see anything out the window.
|140:09:57|CMP|Ahhhhhh, there's Copernicus.
|140:09:57|CMP|And I'll tell you what. 1 think we - need more daylight (1aught er).
||||Tape 93B/12|Page 1113
|140:09:57|CC|Kind of tough, huh?
|140:09:57|CMP|Yes, especially the binocs cut off - they must cut off too much light or something.
|140:09:57|CC|Okay, we understand that. Might just stick with the naked eye then and do the best you can, I guess.
|140:09:57|CMP|Well, I'm trying to - to recall what Jack said on it, and what I see. I'm not sure, did he mention the - the dark part to the south - on the south side of Copernicus? In other words, you can see albedoes real well, and there's a dark area that extends maybe - oh, a half a crater diameter, three-quarters of a crater diameter to the south5 and then it kind of flows down in -I don't know - I don't want to say flows, but at least it carries itself down - down the crater wall - down to the crater floor. And this is kind of in the south maybe from 6 - or let's see, from about 4:30 to 7:30. And then the rest of the crater all the way - all the rest of the way around it, you can see light albedo step all away around the crater. The first step down about a fourth of the way down in the crater wall.
|140:13:31|CC|I don't recall that, but sounds good, Ron.
|140:13:31|CMP|Okay. Unfortunately, those things really disappear fast.
|140:13:31|CC|Roger. Take - take a look at the peaks and concentrate on that mountain in the center of the peaks, If you will, Ron.
|140:13:31|CMP|Okay. is - it's already passed now but I can recall as - as I was looking at it, the peaks -well, seems to me like there's four and they have the same light albedo texture as the - not texture, but the same light albedo - as that first - rings on the inner wall of the crater. And then interspersed between those white peaks were a darker -you could just tell it's the darker - albedo. And you couldn't tell for sure - it's not part of the crater floor, it's just a darker albedo interspersed in there. And I spent - oh, half my time trying to acquire the thing in the binocs. And it just cuts - the binocs just cut down the light too much.
||||Tape 93B/13|Page 1114
|140:13:31|CC|Okay. We'll try maybe later on with the binocs on Copernicus. I guess you're coming up in the Kepler area, aren't you - your - your right coming up on Kepler B.
|140:13:31|CMP|Yes. I think there should be Kepler B right out there now.
|140:13:31|CMP|Let's see - Yes, that's out in Oceanus Procellarum, I guess, isn't it?
|140:15:32|CC|That's af firmat ive.
|140:15:32|CMP|Yes, and then Aristarchus is coming up, I think, isn't it? No, that's Kepler.
|140:15:32|CC|I think Kepler is the real bright one with many bright rays from - coming out it.
|140:15:32|CMP|Yes, it's got a - got a lot of the bright rays on it. Kepler D, and must be another one down there. They, the two small Keplers, don't show any bright rays at all. Do show they're - they've bright slopes on the inner walls. The rays of Kepler really show up quite markedly in the earth-shine. I bet - I bet they show up probably better in earthshine than they do - otherwise. Because I think earthshine tends to bring out the - the albedo differences - considerably.
|140:16:55|CC|Why don't you give me a hack when you're right over Kepler, Ron?
|140:16:55|CMP|Okay, will do. And then what's directly south of Kepler, there's one about the same size as Kepler?
|140:16:55|CC|Encke is about the same size and directly south of Kepler.
||||Tape 93B/14|Page 1115
|140:16:55|CMP|Yes, that's Encke. Okay, Encke.
|140:16:55|CMP|Encke has - departing from the west - Yes, no, I mean departing on its eastern side - it's either -it's a light - I don't see how in the world it can have only one ray, but that's the only one I can see. But there's a light streak - oh about an eighth of the diameter of Encke; and it goes out to the east a little ways and then curves back - it goes out to the east - oh, about three-quarters of the crater diameter, and then it essentially curves back to the northeast and continues on out for another crater diameter.
|140:18:20|CC|Roger. Good show.
|140:18:20|CMP|That might be - that might be the margin of the highlands, there. I'm not sure.
|140:18:20|CC|Okay.
|140:18:20|CMP|Let's see, Reiner Gamma is going to be out of window 3, won't it?
|140:18:20|CC|That's affirmative, Ron. Window 3 for Reiner Gamma.
|140:18:20|CMP|Yes. Okay. Just north of - sure can't remember those names - Kyber?
|140:18:20|CC|North of Kepler, there?
|140:18:20|CMP|Kepler. Yes.
|140:19:45|CMP|And I'm looking out window 3 now, and you can still see those rays. They must be coming from Kepler. They go way on up north toward - the next one is - is - -
|140:19:45|CC|Yes, did you see them going up toward Mariun, there
|140:19:45|CMP|Yes, there's ... zero phase. Yes, I can see Aristarchus. I think that must be Aristarchus. Way back over to the north.
|140:19:45|CC|Yes, that's - that's Aristarchus.
||||Tape 93B/15|Page 1116
|140:19:45|CMP|Sure - -
|140:19:45|CC|That's affirm.
|140:19:45|CMP|--yes , yes.
|140:20:31|CC|Can you see anything on that Marius Rille up there? Or is that too far up?
|140:20:31|CMP|Yes. it - I've sort of kind of looking for it. I can just see some - about three or four light spots up in there. But that's a long ways away, you know.
|140:20:31|CC|Roger.
|140:20:31|CMP|It's about halfway - it's about halfway to the horizon. Or the real light area. Let's see, and you can see Reiner Gamma. I guess Reiner is the crater there. ... isn't there a big crater just before you get to it - -
|140:20:31|CC|That's affirm.
|140:20:31|CMP|- - I think. And then Reiner Gamma - Hey, you know, from here it almost looks like it's the -the ejecta from a crater, because (chuckle) and then continuing from the bottom of the - bottom of the Gamma is a - again a lighter albedo that comes down toward the crater Reiner about halfway between the two of them, and then it takes off and goes perpendicular to - to the line between Reiner and Reiner Gamma.
|140:21:51|CC|Roger. We copy that.
|140:21:51|CMP|And that's a lighter - lighter albedo demarcation, there.
|140:21:51|CC|Is there any topographical expression associated with brightness - with the brightness of Gamma?
||||Tape 93B/16|Page 1117
|140:21:51|CMP|Well, that's what it - is - is very hard to pick up. Maybe that's what the - what I'm describing here - is going perpendicular to the - to the two of them. I got to check and see if that's a - you know, a rise from a relatively flat area up to a kind of a - a hilly terrain.
|140:21:51|CC|Any dark deposits associated with the Gamma? Reiner Gamma?
|140:21:51|CMP|Yes, it's - the Gamma, itself, is - is dark. Now, when zero - zero - Hey, I think we're going to be lucky - zero phase is going to go right through it. But there are dark - in other words, the Gamma, itself - is about the same size as the - as the -the full extension is about the same size as the crater Reiner. And then half of a crater diameter on the inside of that - and, of course, in the Gamma-type shape is a dark type material. Zero-phase is going right through it right now. By gosh, it didn't blot out the dark at all.
|140:23:46|CC|Got any Ñ any more thoughts about what it is?
|140:23:46|CMP|The--
|140:23:46|CC|Do the light-colored markings to the north look the same, Ron?
|140:23:46|CMP|You know, you get - you mean off toward the Marius Hills area?
|140:23:46|CC|Yes, that's right.
|140:23:46|CMP|There's a - the only light - yes, the only light-colored stuff that you can see - I don't see anything off towards the Marius Hills on the thing. You see it right around Reiner Gamma itself. And intermixed within that is that dark - it's a dark annulus, except the annulus is on the inside of the white. And it looks like - I don't know if your eyes deceive you in this darkness or not, but it sure looks the light-colored stuff is raised up with respect to the dark. In other words, the dark almost looks like the interior of a crater -crater rim, interior of a crater wall, you know - -
||||Tape 93B/17|Page 1118
|140:24:58|CC|Roger.
|140:24:58|CMP|- - with the light material around it. Now that's what it looks like in the - in the darkness. And then on the - let's see - southwestern rim of it, it almost looks like you've got a breach of the dark albedo stuff going out to the southeast corner of it in two spots. Okay, then the light stuff turns into - how do you put it - a darker swirly looking type stuff as you continue on west of Reiner Gamma. it crosses kind of a wrinkle ridge, I can see a wrinkle ridge down there, now. it crosses the wrinkle ridge with the no - no apparent change in albedo, anyhow, as it crosses the ridge.
|140:24:58|CC|Roger. Got you, and I think I've got the ridge on my map. I think we've got you.
|140:24:58|CMP|Okay.
|140:24:58|CC|Still - still think it might be a ray from one of those craters - -
|140:26:09|CMP|That's the last of the - you know, it's kind of associated with its own little thing. it doesn't look like it's a ray. it doesn't look like a ray, in other words, it doesn't thin out in different parts of it, like a ray does.
|140:26:09|CC|Okay.
|140:26:09|CMP|It looks like it was a lot thicker than - than a ray.
|140:26:09|CMP|Yes. Okay, this must be - what - Riccioli, I guess? The big crater? About -
|140:27:03|CMP|Now.
|140:27:03|CC|You're just coming up on Ricci - Grimaldi and you got to go through Hevelius, first of all, and then you get Into Grimaldi and Riccioli.
|140:27:03|CMP|Okay, that's Hevelius, then, is the one I'm passing right now. Hevelius is showing up real clear. You can see the slumping of the crater walls coming down there. it's a fairly old-type crater because you don't see any - any rays associated with it. Although the - the slumping is not completely degraded. There's a flat floor with a central peak on it. The central peak has the same albedo -it's a lighter albedo - no, the same albedo texture as the walls - as the west wall.
||||Tape 93B/18|Page 1119
|140:28:20|CMP|We're passing over a - well, generally a hilly type of terrain, and then just before we get into Grimaldi area, it looks like we're out into a plains-type material, again, interspersed with a hummocky-type. I guess that hummocky - is -hummocky stuff is associated with Grimaldi.
|140:28:20|CC|Roger. Looks like you're just passing a little bit to the west of Grimaldi now. You concur with that? About right over Riccioli?
|140:28:20|CMP|It doesn't look like Grimaldi to me - I guess it is, though.
|140:28:20|CC|Okay, Ron. You probably ought to think about - If it's getting kind of dark there for seeing or anything, you might consider getting in the P52, although you're a couple more minutes - still a couple minutes left on it. If you can see back at anything within Reiner Gamma - -
|140:28:20|CMP|Okay.
|140:28:20|CC|- - from this angle, it would be good; otherwise, if it's out, you ought to just consider the 52.
|140:29:48|CMP|Ah, she's pointing in the wrong direction.
|140:29:48|CC|Okay. That was some good stuff, Ron. Just don't hesitate to keep talking on that. We can sort it all out when we get down.
|140:29:48|CMP|Okay. Well, the bright - I'm looking out window I now. Must be out to the north I guess, and there's two very bright craters, in there, just crossing some rilles that run north and south. There's a little bit of a mare material out in there. I wish I knew what that crater was. Weil, I better get going on P52, I guess.

|140:43:54|CC|Hey, Ron. We just had a discussion here and your point is well taken, and why don't you just go ahead, if you want to, and take the ZPN sensors, the yellow plug ones, off and take them off for the evening, if you like.

|152:01:17|CC|Glad to hear it, Ron. Good morning.
|152:01:17|CMP|Good morning.
|152:01:17|CMP|I slept with my lightweight headset on last night so didn't have to have that cap on. Is the fidelity of this thing any good, at all?
|152:01:17|CC|Pretty good, Ron. Pretty good. And as you start your morning's activities, you can be aware that we were watching the spacecraft through the night, and as Flight puts it, everything is swinging.
|152:02:21|CMP|Outstanding. That's what we like.
|152:06:26|CMP|Hey, it's still dark outside.
|152:06:26|CC|We start work early around here.
|152:06:26|CMP|Well, I guess.
|152:12:34|CMP|Hey, Houston; America.
|152:12:34|CC|Go ahead.
|152:12:34|CMP|You know, I'd just be kind of curious how the old heart rate compares to those sleep tests that we did - preflight? Is it about the same when I'm soundly asleep or is it lower or what, you know?
|152:12:34|CC|Stand by, Ron, and I'll ask the men on my left.
||||Tape 101B/2|Page 1392
|152:12:34|CMP|Okay. You know, maybe they'll have that information.
|152:12:34|CC|Roger. They think maybe 5 minutes. And we'll be back to you.
|152:13:30|CMP|Okay. No problem. Curiosity more than anything.
|152:14:08|CMP|I didn't get quite as much sleep last night. I took a bath and changed my underwear, and all those good ... things, you know. Probably only got - oh, maybe 7 hours at the most. Probably closer to 6-1/2 of good sleep
|152:14:08|CC|Roger.
|152:14:08|CMP|I'll give you the rest of that in just a jiffy when I get it squared away.
|152:14:38|CC|Okay.
|152:18:21|CC|America, this is Houston.
|152:18:21|CMP|Go ahead.
|152:18:21|CC|Roger, Ron. Apparently in your preflight data base they show you with a rate of in the low 60*s or high 50's, that's a sleeping rate. And we're showing you now, during your sleep periods, of heart rates of about 10 beats lower per minute. And with heart rates that show less variation than the preflight data shows.
|152:18:21|CMP|Ah ha, okay. Well, thank you much. The heart does slow down a little bit up here, then.
|152:18:21|CC|Apparently so - they assured me however, that it would not be approaching zero. So you can relax there.
|152:18:21|CMP|(Laughter) Okay.

|152:21:17|CC|Okay, Ron. Good morning and go ahead.
|152:21:17|CMP|I just got something a day off (laughter). Okay, Gordo. Glad to have you aboard with us. Okay. PRD, 150Ul; and the sleep, I mentioned, probably about 6-1/2 or 7 good hours. I took a Seconal last night, and I had four cans of fluid.

Lobster bisque, all the peanut butter, all the jelly, three pieces of bread, citrus beverage, a tea, a chocolate bar, and a package of pecans. And I had a beef steak, butterscotch pudding, and an orange drink.

|152:24:10|CC|Okay, Ron. I just picked it up. Let me read it over and then I'll give you a summary.
|152:24:33|CMP|Oh, okay. Sure; no problem.
|152:28:40|CC|Hello, Ron. I'll give you a little summary here of the EVA. It's going to be a little rambling, because I haven't had time to organize it, but it was a very interesting night last night on that second EVA.
|152:28:40|CMP|Sure that's ... Go ahead.
|152:28:40|CC|Traverse lay over terrain of extraordinary geologic diversity and yielded a far greater variety of information than ever obtained on any other lunar traverse. Systematic descriptions and samples of four of the six main units of the area, massif, subfloor, the light mantle, and the dark mantle were obtained. In addition, detailed descriptions were given of a variety of craters, including exciting discoveries that the crater Shorty, and descriptions of the Lee-Lincoln Scarp and lineaments in the hilly terrain. The South Massif is composed of two main varieties of breccia; blue-gray and tan-gray blocks of both varieties were abundant at station 2 up on Nansen. I won't go into the geologic details on those breccias. But - they then found samples of the subfloor unit exposed as blocks in the ejecta around larger craters that had been partly buried by the dark mantle. Stand by.

||||Tape 102B/1|Page 1396
|152:30:32|CC|Yes, Ron. You're loud and clear.
|152:30:32|CMP|Okay. I'm just finishing up my fruit cocktail.
|152:30:32|CC|Okay. While you're munching there, let me give you a few status reports here. First of all, your RCS is hooking right along there 4 percent above the Flight Plan line; however, we have some plans for that 4 percent, which I'll go over with you later. On the oxygen, you've gained a little on it, since I was last on anyway. O2 tank 1 is a little low, but it's balanced by tank 3 being a - a little high, and tank 2 is right on the redline, so I think they all balance out to be about on the redline on the Flight Plan line. And they all three balance out to be right on the Flight Plan line, as close as I can tell. On hydrogen, you're probably up about 4 percent in tank 1, and the other two are right on the line, so you are in good shape there, still.
|152:30:32|CMP|Very good.
|152:30:32|CC|Okay, while you're - I've got some words on your -on your orbit here, which won't require anything -writing down anything - but for some reason you're missing the mascons or something, and your orbit's not degrading like we expected it to. It's not degrading down into a circular orbit. It's - I think it's staying just about the way it was, and so we're looking ahead to a plane change, and we're - we're thinking about an extra maneuver prior to plane change - about 1 hour prior to plane change on the back side. There was some discussion here about what to call that maneuver. Somebody wanted to call it a HAM, height adjustment maneuver, and someone else said, well that one's already used in the rendezvous sequence. Maybe we ought to make it "bacon." And even "lox" was was suggested, considering the FDOs objected to "bacon" because of his religion. So the "lox" was eliminated because ¥we already used that for the S-IVB.
||||Tape 102B/2|Page 1397
|152:30:32|CMP|How about "mascon adjust?"
|152:30:32|CC|Anyway, what the maneuver's going to be - whatever we call it - is about 11 foot per second RCS burn, 1 hour prior to plane change so that'll be on the back side. And, that'll just about use up your RCS overage and put you back on the Flight Plan line. That will adjust the height when you get around to the plane change, and then the plane change will be a little bigger than originally planned, showing about 365 feet per second, SPS, of course. And, looking at the consumables, that will put you down right - right on the rescue red-line on SPS, so we're still in good shape - con-sumablewise. Further tracking will refine this, of course, so we'll have updates on the plan. Any questions on that? Over.
|153:27:16|CMP|No, it sounds like you all thought it out. I appreciate your letting me know about that. I think - Is the time line worked out good enough in there to work in a P4l? I guess it does - an hour before, huh?
|153:27:16|CC|Yes, well - we'll make it. I haven't looked at it myself, but we are - FAO has - and I haven't heard exactly what needs to be changed, if anything. Okay, on the SIM bay. Basically there's nothing new to report. And all the people down here appreciate your timely operation of the SIM bay, and it's responsible for really maximizing the data return. In general, we're pretty happy. The problems that we're have - having with it are ones that have already been mentioned to you. On the - on the HF antenna retract problem that we have, if we have it, here's the plan. We're -Well, first of all, the consensus on that is that we really think the antennas are retracting okay. That it's a malfunction in the limit switch that drives the talkback that's really the problem. So we have devised an alternate method, utilizing timing and stall current, and actually the signature of the motor stall current down here in the data, to determine proper retraction. And just prior to 168 hours in the Flight Plan, you're supposed to retract those antennas, and we're going to check the data at that time, and say yes or "no"; they are retracting or they aren't. If they don't, then the alternate plan we'll swing into at that time is to reschedule the HF targets that are now scheduled on rev 55* Reschedule them and do them on rev 42. After which, we'll try one more time to retract the antennas, and if it still looks like they indeed are not retracting - I guess it's just the one that's in question - then we'll go ahead and jettison them at that time. And we'll still have gotten most of the - of the least -priority HF targets with that alternate plan. Over.
||||Tape 102B/3|Page 1398
|153:29:45|CMP|Yes, that sounds like - sounds like a good plan to me.
|153:29:45|CC|Okay, we got one request from EECOM here. Can you turn the tank 2 FANs, OFF, please?
|153:30:04|CMP|H2 tank 2 FANs are OFF now.
|153:30:04|CC|Okay. And when you get between courses on breakfast there, I have some pencil work for you in the way of Flight Plan updates. Not too much, really.
|153:30:04|CMP|Okay. Contrary to the way I eat breakfast on the ground, I always end up leaving my orange juice to last. I guess that's because you like to eat the hot things first.
|153:30:04|CC|Roger.
|153:30:04|CMP|What I'm saying is the only thing I've got left to eat is orange juice, and I'm ready to copy.
|153:30:04|CC|Okay, 156:22 - which is coming up here - like to, at that time, verify all command module VHP off. You are now 11 after - You have to terminate the jet-on monitor and then get the sounder operating. I can break this off at any time if you think we're pressing that. Just interrupt me.

|153:30:04|CC|Okay, that's correct. Now at - that same page -158:13, after "PAN CAMERA - ON," add a line that says, "V/H OVERRIDE - HIGH ALTITUDE."
|153:30:04|CMP|Okay, at 158:13, "V/H OVERRIDE to HIGH ALTITUDE."
|153:30:04|CC|Okay, and at 158 - -
|153:30:04|CMP|I think it's still in HIGH ALTITUDE from yesterday. Yes, it is.
|153:30:04|CC|Okay. 158:21 is another, "Verify all command module VHF, OFF."
|153:30:04|CMP|Okay, 158:21, "Verify all VHF, OFF," and I know what that means.

|153:35:06|CC|Okay.
|153:35:06|CMP|I was looking at - Aitken when they came that side. Aitken is almost right in the terminator, right now. So when they come up on terminator photos there - The only thing is that, even though it was down in the shadow, down in the bottom of the crater, I could still see the bottom of the craters on - when they come around there for the nearterminator photography. I'm going to open the camera up and take a picture down in the shadow itself and see if that works.
|153:35:06|CC|Okeydoke.
|153:35:06|CMP|And there was quite a bit of backlight - quite a bit of backlight reflection from the northeastern side of it and also the eastern side of it, I guess. Funny, down in the eastern rim - -
|153:35:06|CC|Ron, if you give us ACCEPT, we'll give you a vector while you got it.
|153:36:29|CMP|- - the only way I can describe it - Okay. You have ACCEPT.
|153:36:29|CC|Roger.
|153:36:29|CMP|And the DSKY is clear. With the shadow effect on the eastern - I guess the east and southeastern interior rim of the crater, it reminds me a lot of some eroded hills. Like if you've got a valley that maybe has a 20-foot - it's bigger than that -but say you got a 20-foot drop on the thing where it's been - just rain erosion down the side and it kind of washes little - little valleys down it here and there. And it leaves mounds and humps in between that haven't eroded away yet. And that's the way the side of that crater works. And then the other side of it, the northeastern rim of it and the interior rim, looks just like a - a - one of the massif units. That is, it's a very fine texture, no real erosional processes, just a smooth, gentle -gentle slope.

|153:38:17|CMP|You know that Skylab drink bag has really been a pretty good deal because you can use the nipple that's on the end of that thing and use it for all of the beverage packages. And that way, you don't have to cup open the end of it and let it drip out all over the place.
|153:38:17|CC|Hey, I'll pass that along to the Skylab - -
|153:38:17|CMP|- - you can use the nipple.

|153:48:17|CMP|The dark annulus around Serenitatis - As you look north - the dark variation there, and I'm kind of looking back - looking a little bit backwards now -but that dark has no continuity with the ridge at all. Goes right down the middle of the ridges. As you look directly east of Littrow - east - I mean directly west of Littrow, the wrinkle ridge is there, and then there's - it comes out, and you have the light tan, tannish, tannish -. There's a dark, I guess you call it - a dark tannish-gray. And then you get out to the light tan of the Mare Serenitatis, itself.
|153:48:17|CC|Okay, Ron.
|153:53:09|CMP|You know, I'm looking almost directly into the Sun and you can still see a topographic expression -topographic high around the rilles in the Tacquet area, and also the grayness has disappeared out of that - out of the dark material, and it's just -looking into the Sun now - it looks more of a tan -a darker tan than the Serenitatis area. And you can all see - also see the topographic rise to it now - I'm looking quite a ways away from it and looking down on it.
|153:53:09|CC|Roger.
|153:54:23|CMP|You know, that's kind of funny now, looking back at Sulpicius Gallus and just to the north of that, there's a crater that's about - well, it's right at the end of those rilles that go north from Sulpicius Gallus. And you can really see the ejecta blanket. The ejecta blanket looks very dark, around it now in this Sun. Now you look out across the Mare Serenitatis now and you're getting toward the sunset, looking back into the Sun, and the color is disappearing all except in that one spot. Now that must be a - either a fresh ejecta - and you look the brightness of it or something - or either that or it's dark. It1s sure a dark - it's a dark ejecta blanket around it. The blanket itself goes out maybe two or three crater diameters, and it looks like it has kind of a ray-type pattern to it. I'll mark that crater. I don't even know if it has got a name or not, but I'll mark it on my map.

|153:54:23|CC|Okay.
|153:54:23|CMP|I got a ding. Let's see. It must be time to do something.
|153:54:23|CC|Yes, it's time to turn the recorder on.
|153:55:43|CMP|RECORDER, ON. RECORDER'S ON.
|153:55:43|CC|Okay.
|153:57:04|CMP|Just - I don't know where I am right now, I'll be honest. I just looked out window 3, and I'm right on the terminator. And, let's see, I'm going west, so we've got some arcuate - There's kind of a mare area down there. Okay, I think it is. And you.can see lava tongues sticking out through there. And lava flow fronts with the high side on the east side because you got a shadow all the way along the front. And they're about - in the one area - you might consider a scalloped area -an ejecta scallop. Coming out of that one area you can see a crazy lava flow coming out from it.
|153:57:04|CC|Roger on that.
|153:57:04|CMP|At least the flow -
|153:57:04|CMP|Hey, those are Apennines I'm just going over, aren't they?
||||Tape 102B/9|Page 1404
|153:57:04|CC|That's right. That's what they ought to be. We need the IR, OFF.
|153:57:04|CMP|You look back out across Seren - Okay.
|153:57:04|CC|We need the IR COVER, CLOSED, please.
|153:57:04|CMP|Say again, Gordo.
|153:57:04|CC|We want the IR COVER, CLOSED. Right away.
|153:59:34|CMP|Okay, it's going CLOSED. Okay, it's CLOSED. How about the UV?
|153:59:34|CMP|IR COVER is CLOSED.
|153:59:34|CMP|I was just going to say, looking back across Serenitatis into the Sun now, there must be Bessel that has ejecta pattern out there. When you look at the ejecta patterns into the Sun, they all look black with respect to the mare. I think it must be a shadow effect or something that you get off of the - the raised ejecta that comes up across it.
|153:59:34|CC|Roger.
|154:02:41|CC|Hey, Ron, that frantic call there was because the Sun had started to get in the IR and hadn't really thought that would happen, but started to see it get in there. But you caught it in time; the cover saved it.
|154:02:41|CMP|Okay. Real good. I figured that's probably what it was.
|154:02:41|CC|And you can go ahead with the rest of the steps in there with the UV off after sunset.
|154:03:21|CMP|Okay. MAPPING CAMERA is going OFF. COVER'S CLOSED on the IR so then we'll turn it off. PAN CAMERA, SELF TEST, OFF. And let's see, I don't see the Sun shining up a light out there. It must be sunset. Couldn't be yet, though. Yes, sure enough is, though. Okay, UV's going OFF. You want the IR COVERs back OPEN just to keep things straight here?
||||Tape 102B/10|Page 1405
|154:03:21|CC|Stand by on that.
|154:03:21|CMP|They're just - I - next time we use the IR, let's just remember to open the cover.
|154:03:21|CC|Okay. Just open it up the next time we use It, which is in about 15 minutes. We'll we'll remind you on that if you forget.
|154:03:21|CMP|Oh, okay. That's right. Okay. That's right, these are just short sounder passes now, aren't they?
|154:03:21|CC|That's right.
|154:03:21|CC|Ron, I can finish up my description of the last night's EVA if you like since nothing to look at now. I'm watching the clock on the sounder start for you.
|154:03:21|CMP|Okay; hey, appreciate it.
|154:06:01|CC|Okay, think I left off, or was cut off there without mentioning two varieties of breccia in the South Massif. They found blue-gray and tan-gray and, without going into the geological details, those are the two types they found up there at Nansen. The subfloor unit was exposed as blocks and ejecta around larger craters had been partly buried by dark mantle. And craters apparently had penetrated thin parts of the light mantle. Especially good samples were obtained from the rim of Camelot where the same textural characteristics which are banding caused by variations in vesicle concentration, coarse-grain size, and mineralogic features, as reported in EVA-1, were found. So apparently this unit is quite uniform over the distances that they have covered so far in the traverses. The prominent east-facing scarp, crossing the valley floor from north to south about 5 kilometers west of the LM, was traversed twice near the crater Lara, near Hole-in-the-Wall, al-although Hole-in-the-Wall appeared to be pretty subtle. No change in the surface characteristics or lithology of the mantle was discernible where the astronauts traversed the Scarp. Outcrops of boulders were observed farther to the north where the northward extension of the Scarp crosses the face of the North Massif, it forms a notably smooth and relatively young-appearing surface. Elsewhere, the surface of the North Massif is prominently furrowed and textured, and the crew described it as a cross-hatched pattern on the surface that they could see with one set of lineaments dipping eastward and the other westward at about 30 degrees. Some of the most interesting observations made during the EVA were related to craters. Many small craters within the dark mantle have glass-coated central pits. Jack called them dimples. Some of the pits are nearly cylindrical and maybe half again as deep as the crater itself. Other small craters occurring in both the dark and light mantle have bright halos, but these halos appear to be noticeably brighter on the light-colored material. This bright material is not blocky or fragmental ejecta derived from a subfloor layer, but rather appears to consist of "instant rock" or soil breccia which has been partly consolidated by the impact shock itself. The most interesting eureka during the EVA was at station 4, Shorty Crater, where Jack found some bright red or orange, he described it, orange dirt within the gray to dark-gray rim material. The colored banding is circumferential to the crater and resembled alteration halos, which occur around many terrestrial volcanic vents. So you can see why the geologists are excited on that one. The morphology of Shorty, however, is similar in some respects - -
||||Tape 102B/11|Page 1406
|154:09:20|CMP|You bet you.
|154:09:20|CC|- - impact craters have definitive interpretation of its origin may depend on sample analysis. And I got about a .minute and a half to start the sounder. It might be close to 02:30 there, if you aren't. They took a total of about 850 pictures. They've taken a total of 1270, would you believe, pictures ... on the lunar surface. Including about 150 with the 500-millimeter camera mostly of the North, South, East Massifs, and Family Mountain. They got 56 samples, two double cores, probably about 36 kilograms worth, and they traveled a total distance of 20 kilometers. Over.
||||Tape 102B/12|Page 1407
|154:09:20|CMP|Hey, sounds like a good summary. They're finding all kinds of things up there. Which is the reason you explor, I guess, to find - to see what you can find.
|154:09:20|CC|Yes, they - they were really in their element last night. About 30 seconds to T-start time. 1*11 let you call it yourself, though.
|154:09:20|CMP|Okay. I'll get it.
|154:11:04|CMP|DATA SYSTEMS are OFF. OPERATE, 05.
|154:11:04|CC|Okay.
|154:11:04|CMP|Hope this thing's in Reiner Gamma. Then you can find some sort of a topographic expression, to that light-colored material around there. It looks to me like there is - right around the Reiner Gamma itself anyhow.
|154:11:04|CC|Roger.
|154:11:04|CMP|Maybe the lunar sounder will collaborate my moonlight investigations here - or earthlight investigations, I'm sorry.
|154:11:04|CC|(Laughter)
|154:11:04|CMP|While we're waiting here - I decided to sleep last night without being tied down or anything. So I slept in the old - What do you call them in the Navy? -
|154:11:04|CC|Hammocks, I think.
|154:11:04|CMP|Well, anyhow, sleeper strings, we call them up here. Yes, sleeping bags - or some kind of sack. And the last 2 or 3 nights, what I'd do is put the lap belt on loosely. And you know, it just kind of keeps you from rolling all over the cockpit. Then last night, I didn't put it on at all and stayed in the sack. And I really didn't go too far anyhow. One time I woke up and I was crossways in the couch up here. And then when I woke up this morning my feet were up in the tunnel, and my head was kind of still in the center couch, more or less. So you really don't roam around too much that way anyhow, even if you aren't tied down. And you can get the "huggy pillow" effect by being inside that sack and laying your head on the outside of the sack. It just about fits me, except that if I stretch my feet out - then I get a little bit of a pull. Little bit of a pull - on it and it feels like a huggy pillow that way.
||||Tape 102B/13|Page 1408
|154:11:04|CC|Kind of a security blanket effect, huh?
|154:11:04|CMP|(Laughter) Yes, right. That was the biggest problem the first 2 or 3 days here - what do you do with your head when you go to sleep. I'm used to sleeping with a pillow. And I'm used to sleeping on my side. And it's amazing the psychological effect that you can get from - for me it's hard to go to sleep just laying on my back. So you can -turn on your side and you go right to sleep (laughter). What's your side and what's your back - I don't know, but anyhow, it works.
|154:11:04|CC|That's got to be psychological.
|154:16:57|CMP|(Laughter) It sure is.
|154:16:57|CMP|5, 6, 7, 8 -
|154:16:12|CMP|MARK it. LUNAR SOUNDER to STANDBY.
|154:16:12|CC|Okay.
|154:17:14|CMP|Okay. RECORDER is going OFF. ... the heaters.
|154:17:14|CC|Roger.
|154:17:24|CMP|DATA SYSTEMs coming ON.
|154:17:41|CMP|Okay. SM/AC POWER is ON.
|154:18:40|CMP|I guess we need to open the old door. IR, OFF, barberpole, gray bar. I get to mess with the old optics again.
||||Tape 102B/14|Page 1409
|154:18:40|CC|We're getting some of that, Ron. Sounds like the mike might have slipped away from your mouth, though.
|154:18:40|CMP|Okay. That's a good point - let me change my headsets here. Anyway, I went right through the Flight Plan with all that stuff.
|154:18:40|CC|Okay, and - -
|154:18:40|CMP|... left the IR COVER, OPEN.
|154:18:40|CC|Okay. Great memory there.
|154:18:40|CC|Ron, if you like while you're getting ready for the 52, I can summarize the news real rapidly. There wasn't a whole lot.
|154:18:40|CMP|Okay. Sure, go ahead, I've got a different headset now. Is that okay?
|154:18:40|CC|Yes, you're loud and clear. Former President Truman is still hanging in there. His heartbeat and breathing became unstable yesterday, but then improved again. Of course, the big headlines were about the discovery of the orange dirt at Shorty Crater. And there was a picture of Jan, John, and Jaime in the paper, watching the EVA on TV. The only thing new on the peace talks is that Kissinger will probably be coming back to the United States today and there's a rumor, the French press said that the compromise is in the work on the withdrawal of the North Vietnamese troops from the south. The Rockets lost - the Aeros, the hockey team, won last night. They beat the Alberta Oilers. The Rockets lost to Buffalo. And the weather finally cleared out. The cold front cleared out the wet stuff and last night I think was the first time since you guys launched that we've had a look at the Moon, so we had a direct look at you last night. It's just nice and sunny here, this morning when I came to work. Over.
|154:18:40|CMP|Hey, thanks for the news and I guess those three guys that went up to the Moon - you know, they probably cleared that weather up there in Houston.
||||Tape 102B/15|Page 1410
|154:18:40|CC|It sure took you awhile though.
|154:18:40|CMP|(Laught er) Right.
|154:24:31|CMP|Okay, 14 is Canopus again, the same ones I had last night I think. That's Canopus. Canopus looks about as bright as Sirius, but not quite.
|154:24:31|CC|Roger.
|154:24:31|CMP|My sextant - is good and everything like that, but you just can't quite get the reticle in focus.
|154:24:31|CC|Roger.
|154:24:31|CMP|It1s kind of the way they said it was going to be.
|154:24:31|CC|Okay, Ron. We copy those. Clear to torque them.
|154:26:14|CMP|Okay, let's see; we'll torque at - oh, make it 06:30.
|154:26:14|CC|All righty.
|154:26:14|CC|Ron, we've still got about 5 or 6 minutes until LOS, but in case we drop off on your maneuvering there - just want to tell you that everything's looking good. In fact, the IR is pumping out good data, so with that fantastic teamwork, we saved it back there, and we'll see you next time around.
|154:27:24|CMP|Hey, okay. Sounds good, there's little old Aldebaran in there. Saturn still must be out of the - There it goes into the -
|154:28:58|CMP|(Humming) got to align the old GDC here.
|154:28:58||BEGIN LUNAR REV 36

|154:28:58|CC|Hello there, America. We hear your scratchy-sounding OMNI.
|154:28:58|CMP|(Laughter) Probably so.
|154:28:58|CC|You're readable but noisy.
|154:28:58|CMP|You're cutting in and out on the OMNI. I thought I couldn't get you.
|154:28:58|CC|Roger.
|154:28:58|CMP|Looks like we get the high gain here pretty quick.
|155:22:52|CC|Roger.
|155:27:29|CMP|Launch a little heavy [?].
|155:27:29|CMP|Okay, Houston; America. We probably have pretty good comm now, huh?
|155:27:29|CC|Yes, Ron. We're getting you now, and you sound good.
|155:27:29|CMP|Okay. I don't have any observations to report from the back side. About time for blue bag number 4. Somebody has got to develop a better mouse trap.
|155:29:23|CC|Roger on that.
|155:32:07|CMP|Okay, the old PAN CAMERA'S in STANDBY.
|155:32:07|CC|Roger, Ron.
|155:32:07|CMP|Power's coming - power's coming on and V/H is the HIGH ALTITUDE.
|155:32:07|CC|Okay.
|155:32:07|CC|Okay, Ron, we1 re ready for SELF TEST.
||||Tape 103B/2|Page 1412
|155:32:07|CMP|Okay, going to SELF TEST -
|155:32:49|CMP|Now. Barber pole.
|155:32:49|CC|Roger.
|155:32:49|CMP|Okay, by the way, mag Lima Lima is empty. 165 frames showing there. Started mag Mike Mike with frame number 95* Finished the orbital science at 142. Took the crazy camera at f/5-6 at 1/125- When I got ready to change to f/5.6 at 1/250, I looked at the crazy thing and it was setting at f/ll. Maybe those first frames in there, maybe they can develop them a little different or something and still bring - get them to come out.
|155:37:01|CC|Okay, Ron. We got that.
|155:37:01|CMP|I think what happens is I must have been holding the thing by the lens or something or I burnped the - the f-stop thing somehow.
|155:37:01|CC|Ron, we're ready for PAN CAMERA POWER to OFF. And did you go to HEATERS after you set the SELF TEST switch to SELF TEST, when we started this?
|155:37:01|CMP|No, I just went back to to OFF. Was I supposed to go to HEATERS?
|155:37:01|CC|Okay, we'd like it in HEATERS, now.
|155:37:59|CMP|Okay, it's going to HEATERS. Now it's spring-loaded to OFF, and I just left it there. Okay, going to HEATERS, and now it's going to - power if OFF.
|155:37:59|CC|Okay.
|155:37:59|CMP|Okay, let's see. Are we ready for Lunar Sounder? Need a clock down here by panel 230 (laugh). Not really. I can look back and see the LEB one. Okay, it's about time. Okay. LUNAR SOUNDER's verified in STANDBY. The RECORDER is going ON. RADAR is going ON. And the RECORDER is OFF, not the heaters. If antenna 1, verify they're out, eh? EXTEND. No barber pole. Back to OFF. Number 2 EXTEND. No barber pole. Back to OFF. Okay, MODE is going to HF and let me take a look at - Alfa is OFF; Bravo is OFF. B DATA is OFF, BEACON is OFF; RANGING is OFF. Okay, let's see. Two, two. 250 lens. Okay.

|155:40:27|CMP|Mike goes in the temporary stowage bag; QQ goes on with 104 frames.
|155:40:27|CMP|That's going to be window 3.
|155:40:27|CMP|Somebody had - had his nose up against window 3, here Got to wipe it off. Boy, these windows have really been great though. They haven't - you know -don't have any coatings or anything like that on them.
|155:42:18|CC|Roger, on that.
|155:42:18|CMP|I'll be darned. I'll bet that's a little micro-meteorite pit in window 3. Right in the middle of it. It looks like two of them out there. It's about - much smaller than a 1/32 - 1/64 - 1/64 in diameter probably.
|155:42:18|CC|Got cha.
|155:42:18|CMP|It's a little, round - Doesn't seem to have any -It's just a pit, you know.
|155:42:18|CC|Ron, you said that was window 3?
|155:42:18|CMP|Window 3, yes.
|155:42:18|CC|Okay.
|155:45:54|CMP|Oh, it scared me for a minute there. I was configuring for terminator photos, and I looked on the near-side terminator, and I didn't see any. It's on the far side.
|155:45:54|CC|Yes, Stu and I were looking at the same thing. We're just about a - 30 seconds ahead of you.
|155:45:54|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. One's of Aitkin on the far side. Okay. Aitken and Ibn Hyan [sic], I think, or something like that. Debber [?], Ibn Hyan [sic].
||||Tape 103B/4|Page 1414
|155:45:54|CMP|Yes. You know, going to come across - come across the Tacquet area again, and there doesn't seem to be any - it - there's a bright crater - a recent crater in the annulus - in that dark annulus, in the southern part of Serenitatis, it shows up again as that kind of a blue-gray brightness, as opposed - as opposed to the tannish - tannish brightness of the - of the bright craters in Serenitatis. There's still is no apparent wrinkle ridge - there's no color tone or differentiation in the winkle-ridge area, in this part of it. The only differentiation, and - It looks like south of Tacquet you get the same color tone variation occurs on over into Tranquillitatis. When you get to the Tacquet area, from Tacquet up to Miller or something - I wish I could remember the name of that crazy crater.
|155:45:54|CC|How about Menelaus.
|155:49:31|CMP|Menelaus. That's it. Yes. From Tacquet up to Menelaus now, the - that's got to be a buildup of material and it's more on the tan side than it is on the - more of a dark tan than it is to the tannish-gray. So it's a different type of material than - than on the annulus down below the crater, Tacquet.
|155:49:31|CC|Okay, Ron. You're saying this is sort of a annular plateau, then, that stretches across between Tacquet and Menelaus?
|155:49:31|CMP|Yes, it is. It's an annular plateau in there, and the plateau is got to have been coming from those rilles down - that are down in there.
|155:49:31|CC|Okay, do those - Maybe you've already said this -do those wrinkle ridges cross the color boundaries?
|155:49:31|CMP|No, I can't find the wrinkle ridge that crosses the color boundary. The wrinkle ridges are out in Serenitatis itself, and there is no color boundary on the western edge of Serenitatis. It's all the same.
|155:49:31|CC|Okay. Those sound like supergood observations, Ron.
||||Tape 103B/5|Page 1415
|155:49:31|CMP|Passing over - Sulpic - and - I'm just passing over Sulpicius Gallus, now. And just beyond Sulpicius Gallus - Sulpicius Gallus is out in the Mare Tranquillitatis, itself, and it looks like you could - it's either a talus slope - you know, you got a gentle slope of the - of the massif coming down and then it changes slope a little bit, and the - it looks like you have finer-grained material. And that might be what we have at one time or another called the high-water mark, but I kind of believe that's just a talus change in the slope. As you..go on down there in the fine-grained material, somehow developing down there in the bottom. But as soon as you cross that area -we're going west now from Sulpicius Gallus - again we've got kind of the same tannish - a dark tan material that essentially covers the highland -this highland-type of an area here. It's a hummocky-type material. There are a few rilles just north of Sulpicius Gallus; those rilles, again, have -have the dark tan material on it. About the same as the tan - same color tones that you pick up from Tacquet to Mele - Meleneis [sic].
|155:51:54|CC|Okay sounds great. Keep talking, we'll cue you as the Flight Plan events come up.
|155:51:54|CMP|Okay. D - D-Caldera is sure fascinating. I'll try and take a quick look with the binocs on that one. *** binoc and I can't find it there. There it is.
|155:51:54|CMP|I hope the pictures will kind of confirm a little bit of a - of a topographic rise around the D-Caldera, just a slight one, and it's about half the width of the - if you - As you look at the "D,Ó it's a half a width of the "D," not the height, but the width. And it seems to be a raised, kind of a raised, flat rim around it. The color of the raised burnps down in the D-Caldera are the same as the surrounding material, around there. The de - the burnps that are raised up are smooth looking and the depression for it has to be a caldera, I guess, or at least, the part of the depression, anyhow, is a light bluish gray; I'll call it that way, very light bluish gray.
||||Tape 103B/6|Page 1416
|155:54:14|CC|Hey, Ron I'm not suggesting you do, because it's probably trouble to find. Have you tried the color wheel, comparing it on any of this stuff?
|155:54:14|CMP|(Laughter) No, I haven't. Let me try. That's a good idea, though. I'll try that and see what I can come up with on that thing.
|155:54:14|CC|Well, don't don't go to a lot of trouble. I never got around to it, but you might - you might peg down some of these colors a little better. Particularly when you were talking last night about -on the back side - -
|155:54:14|CMP|That's a good point.
|155:54:14|CC|On one of those passes about the green.
|155:54:14|CMP|Yes.
|155:54:14|CC|Okay, you're about 7 seconds away from where we're wanting the recorder on, Ron. Any time here's fine
|155:54:14|CMP|Okay, RECORDER - let's see -
|155:55:09|CMP|Is ON. Verify RADAR is ON, remove HF, okay.
|155:55:09|CMP|You know, to me, the Moon's got a lot more color than I'd been led to believe. I kind of had the impression that everything was the same color. That's far from being true.
|155:55:09|CC|Okay.
|155:55:09|CC|I guess, maybe we could say, perhaps, color is in the eye of the beholder.
|155:55:09|CMP|I think there is a considerable amount of truth to that.
|155:55:09|CMP|(Whistling)

|156:09:05|CC|Sure will, Ron.
|156:09:05|CMP|A minute before that or so.
|156:09:05|CMP|I had the lights up. I may not be light adapted.
|156:09:05|CMP|Sure is ...
|156:09:05|CMP|I was trying to think if there was anything I could add to the Reiner Gamma observation there. I'm right over that - the light albedo of that type of material that goes perpendicular between Reiner and Reiner Gamma. It's kind of a crooked type - Well, you know, it goes for a little ways, and then it breaks off into a dark-albedo-type stuff; and then breaks off in another direction a little bit. So, it doesn't look like a straight ray at all.
|156:12:26|CC|Roger.
|156:12:26|CMP|You know - you can see crater holes, and this type of thing. You look right down on Reiner now, you've sure got that dark annulus - the lighter-albedo-type stuff is essentially in the middle of it. And the annulus is - let's see, maybe 30 kilometers wide by twice as long - that's a relative size, anyhow - by twice as long, and that's the dark area. And then around that, the light albedo stuff is about half of the width, and it's lighter on the outside than it is on the inside. The inside is not quite as light as the - I'd call it the rim, I guess. It's very hard to see any - -
|156:12:26|CC|Okay.
||||Tape 104B/2|Page 1419
|156:12:26|CMP|- - great, great, great topographic expression to it, though. The reason I say that is because it kind of blends in with everything, whereas if you look at a crater out here in the middle of the mare or a hill, you get a brighter - part of it's brighter than the surrounding territory. You can actually see the demarcation. So that's the way you get your depth perception out of it.
|156:12:26|CC|Okay, about 30 seconds now until T-stop.
|156:12:26|CMP|Okay. T-stop is 54:38 and we'll go to STANDBY at that time. Tape switch. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7; STANDBY.

|156:17:42|CC|Okay.
|156:17:42|CMP|Do-do-do-do-aadoot-doot.
|156:17:42|CMP|Houston, America. You might tell the medics not to pay any attention to those sample numbers on those busses. Pay attention to the GET time, because when you take them out of the buss storage bag, the right one never comes out. So I don't think it makes any difference, Just pay attention to the GET time.

|157:20:56|CC|Okay. It's T-start of l60:4l:22; T-stop is l6l:26:47. And the remark that goes with that -you don't need to write this down - but the T-start time is biased 10 seconds prior to when we really think sunset will occur. If you see, visually - -

|157:20:56|CC|That's correct, and do you want to read back the start time?
|157:20:56|CMP|My start time is l60:4l:22. Is that correct?

|157:24:06|CMP|Goody, I've got a zodiacal light coming up there sometime; blue filter, no less. Oh, I started to say, when I was coming across Aitken - Of course Aitken itself was down in the shadow, and the Sun was really shining on window 3. I took the first one at f/5*6 and a 1/15* the second one 56, 5.6, I mean, at a - at a 1/30, and a third one at a 1/60, and then a fourth one at a 1/25È and the fifth and sixth ones I took off to the north - looking off to the north - out of window U.
|157:24:06|CC|Okay.
|157:24:06|CMP|And they were 5-6 at 1/125. I kind of doubt if -It might work, but there's sure a lot of glare on the window. If it can get through that glare, well then we've got it made.
|157:24:06|CC|Roger.
|157:27:10|CMP|Oh, the other thing I was going to tell you was that magazine Quebec Quebec - I finished that one on 114.

|157:27:10|CMP|I don't know who took my water jug, but it's gone.
|157:27:10|CMP|Okay. Overboard drain is purged enough. I guess we can turn that off.
|157:27:10|CMP|That big filter on here - here. I always leave the hose and everything disconnected and stick it back behind this rock bag. I'm afraid I'll kick it, break it off. You know - you know those rock bags. I unzip those and blow the air out of them every night, wake up the next morning, and they're full of air again; just like two big balloons down there.

|109:34:44|CC|Roger.
|109:34:44|CMP|And. if north is zero as you look at the crater, then over about 1 o'clock there's some kind of a fault area in the side of the rim, and that's another spot where the dark material drapes down into the rim and also out on the outer - outside -outside of the rim. And then you have that same type of impression at about 11 o'clock. You've got a black streak going dcwn inside the rim, and then it widens out going out toward a little crater out there on the outside of the rim.
|157:36:03|CC|Okay,--

|157:43:14|CMP|Okay, 1111 check that.
|157:43:14|CMP|You know, I'm looking from this position back toward le Monnier - le - le Monnier or whatever. Le - le Monnier, and you can see the - well, it's hard viewing it - to see it here, but your - you can see the annulus around Serenitatis. The demarcation is about the diameter of le Monnier toward - westward from there and the demarcation of the color - the color from this observation, again, is a light tan. Darn. I forgot to get that color wheel out, but it's a darker tan than the tan of Serenitatis.
|157:43:14|CC|Roger, Ron.
|157:43:14|CMP|The color boundary is not associated with any rille or anything that I can see. Doesn't look like there's any topographic expression to it.
|157:43:14|CMP|There it is.
|157:48:16|CC|Diought you might be interested, Ron. We just woke up the Challenger, and they're all doing fine.

||||Tape 105B/6|Page 1428
|157:48:16|CC|Yes, they pressed me into service because they have - We woke up the Challenger and they needed someone on that one, so I'm over here. Still cold and cloudy.
|157:48:16|CMP|(Laughter)
|157:48:16|CC|But we've got one blessing. It's not raining outside.
|157:48:16|CMP|Well, that's good anyhow. You know, even from here now I can still see that annulus around le Monnier or le Monnier or whatever it is.
|157:48:16|CC|I'll buy that.
|157:48:16|CMP|Pronounce those things for me, you know (laughter).
|157:48:16|CC|Are you saying that annulus extends out into Serenitatis, and you see some, kind of like, rings of le Monnier out there in Serenitatis like that?
|157:48:16|CMP|No, they aren't rings there - they're just a - it's a diameter that extends into Serenitatis about the diameter of le Monnier.
|157:49:36|CC|Okay. We copy that.
|157:49:36|CMP|And even from this distance. You know, I'm almost to the western edge of Crisium, looking back across there, and even from this distance, you can still see the - the color boundary between the two and as far - It goes up north by Posidonius, and then it kind of blends in and it will look - as far as I can tell anyhow. Going from Posidonius on around to the north side of Serenitatis. Of course, it's a long ways away, and I really can't see, but I couldn't tell a definite demarcation. It just kind of blended in from the tan to - to the dark tan.
|157:49:36|CC|Oh, Roger.
|157:50:42|CMP|Yes. Bessel is the one crater that really shows up out there. It's the biggest one in the - in the Mare Serenitatis, and it's also the one that has that - an ejecta pattern - a fresh pattern ejecta pattern around it and that really shows up in the - in the shallow Sun as you're looking back towards the Sian.

|157:52:35|CMP|Oh, okay. Which way?
|157:52:35|CC|Roger, Ron. We want a 360 - We want a 360 degree roll, 360 roll, 360, or 000; your choice.
|157:52:35|CMP|Okay. That's only 20 degrees.
|157:52:35|CC|Yes, it would mean a 360 roll. Just roll to 360.
|157:52:35|CMP|Yes, that's right. That's what I assumed.
|157:52:35|CMP|Fifteen degrees to go. Will that hack it?
|157:52:35|CMP|How's that? Got me in the clear?

|158:00:04|CMP|Pretty close, but we made it.
|158:03:29|CC|Just of interest to you, Ron. We are really pleased with the way that our visual display and that worked out last night during the orbital science visual. Farouk was able to feed me the questions, and I was able to get them to you. If you have any comments one way or another, if you don't want us to do it on rev 40 or not, let us know. We plan right now on rev 40 for those orbital science visuals to do the same thing going - It's the visuals through landing site down through D-Caldera, and we're going to run the same operation, since it went so smoothly down here. We hope it went that way for you up there.
|158:03:29|CMP|It sure did. As a matter of fact, I like it very much. That kind of clues me on what to look for as you're going through, because you see so many things down there - that you - that you kind of -Frankly, I have a tendency to forget what the main thing that you're trying to look for is.
|158:04:27|CC|Good show. We're prepared to do it on this next rev, and I guess you might say even though it isn't that way in the Flight Plan, we'll probably just stand by right straight through on rev 40 where you - you pick up at the landing site and go right through D-Caldera. We'll be just standing by for that whole rev - that rev - whole piece - about 12 minutes, or so.

|158:24:25|CC|I sure hope I'm as clear to you as you are to us. You sound like you're just in the next room. It's really great comm.
|158:25:50|CMP|Well, you are really - It's really great.
|158:30:36|CC|Ron, we're about ready to lose you, and at l6l:30 you have a maneuver. We want to make sure that gets started on time because of Sun problems on the camera.
|158:30:36|CMP|At l6l:30. Okay.
|158:30:36|CC|Yes, it's just a matter of doing it on time - -
|158:30:36|CMP|Okay. We'll do that.
|158:30:36|CC|- - or else we'll have Sun problems.

|158:30:59|CMP|Okay.
|158:30:59|CC|And it's because the camera's out of shade.
|158:30:59|CMP|I tell you what. I'll start that.
|158:30:59|CMP|Yes, I'll start that as soon as I get the clem [?] cover closed on T-stop. That will give us a minute or so there, too.
|158:30:59|CC|Biat would be real fine, Ron.
|158:30:59|CC|Okay. We've got the DSE running, Ron, as per the Flight Plan.
|158:31:33|CMP|Okay.

|229:45:25|CMP|Hey, America - Houston, this is America. We've got you loud and clear. A little late on picking you up that time, but worked okay. Okay, on mag Q, Quebec - it's finished right now, and whatever frame number it was on when they left the lunar surface to 143. Q? Oh, K. Mag Kilo, okay. Whatever frame they were on on the lunar surface to 143 were selected shots by the LMP. Frame 143 to 172 were near-side terminator photos of Ts i olkovsky.
|229:45:25|CC|Okay, Ron. We copy that right from the Flight Plan change.
|230:31:39|CMP|Okay. And PAN CAMERA to STEREO - Jack, ... help me get it. Verify STANDBY on STEREO. Okay , PAN CAMERA POWER coming ON. Oops, stand by here. Okay. V over H, HIGH ALTITUDE.
|230:31:59|CMP|Okay, PAN CAMERA to POWER. Okay, got the power. Okay, we've got a T-start coming up here at 24:07, 12 minutes. ... suppose that's what it should be ... yes, ... Let's see, Houston, America. I only have one pan camera pad here. Is that correct?
|230:31:59|CC|Let me see. We've got one sitting right in front of us for 233:40. Do you want that one?
|230:31:59|CMP|I don't have that one.
|230:31:59|CC|Yes.
|230:31:59|CMP|I've got the one that starts at 24:0? ana ends at 38:42.
|230:31:59|CC|That's correct, and you don't have the other one because we never said it. We've got here ready to go.
|230:31:59|CMP|Oh, okay.

|230:31:59|CC|Okay, T-start time, 233:48:15; T-stop is 234:00:30
|230:31:59|CMP|Okay, photo pad is - T-start is 233:46:15, T-ntop is 234:00:30.
|230:31:59|CC|Roger, Ron. And let me give you some words here that you might be interested in. Right now we're looking at probably pulling in those antenna at 233:45 or 46, right in that time frame. If those maneuvers - that should not work, we shall have to jettison the antennas at around 234:3 - 235:39. We have, and we won't give it to you until we need It. We have a VERB 49 maneuver to a jett attitude for 234:25, and that'll keep in that attitude and then we'll jettison the antennas at 235:43, and, of course, we'll have to bring up the logic power on those. We have this all available standing by and there's no sense passing it until we find out how the antennas do on RETRACT.
|230:31:59|CMP|Okay, that sounds reasonable. Do you have the, cr you want to use, the page in the Experiments Checklist there?
|230:31:59|CC|Roger. Except for the NOUN 78s. We'll change those.
|230:31:59|CMP|Oh, okay. Sounds good.
|230:31:59|CMP|It's in the Volkswagen pocket. Okay.
|230:36:05|CMP|I don't think we ever changed it though. Okay, the arrow's there, which indicates that ve didn't do it. Okay, LI0H canister change, 19 into A, take 17 and put it into A - A-4. That's correct.
|230:37:17|CMP|At 24, we want the pan camera.
|230:37:17|LMP|Bob, while we're waiting for the pun e user a , a quickie here. One of the ways that seems be useful for determining the relative age of he larger basins, to me anyway, is the abundance of block fields on the slopes of the walls or the slopes of the central peaks. That abundance decreasing with increasing age, and one of the comparisons that I just made that it looks as if Tsiolkovsky and Sklodowska have about the same abundance of - of block fields on both those features of the crater.
