|041:18:05|LMP|Hello, Houston, America. How do you read?
|041:06:00|CC||America, this is Houston. Over.

|041:18:03|CC|Challenger, this is Houston. You're loud and clear, although we have a lot of background noise. Not sure whether that's getting through. Do you know if Ron is still on VOX?
|041:18:03|CC|America, this is Houston. Over.
|041:18:03|SC|Okay. Stand by, and Challenger is going to give you a call on S-band, and VHF checks are both GO on A and B.
|041:18:03|CC|I think I side marked on Challenger. We are getting some data. We'll stand by for another check.
|041:19:21|CMP|Do you acknowledge that?
|041:19:21|LMP|I heard him the first time.
|041:19:21|CDR|Okay. ... me get S-band in
|041:19:29|LMP|Okay, Houston; this is Challenger. Counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 How do you read?
|041:19:29|CC|Challenger, Houston. You're loud and clear, with the background noise.
|041:19:29|LMP|They don't have a good up-link, Gene. I - I had signal strength. And now I don't have any at all.
|041:19:29|CDR|Okay. Houston, Challenger.
|041:19:29|LMP|There it is. Now I do; 2.2.
|041:19:29|CDR|Okay.
|041:19:29|LMP|Tell them I heard their transmission to you.

|041:20:34|LMP|I was at zero signal strength, and I heard their transmission ... One of them. The first time they acknowledged that your - that I was going to do it.
|041:20:34|LMP|Did you shift my hose back? Oh,

|042:21:25|CT|You going back to air-to-ground 1?
|042:21:32|CMP|Okay. I heard somebody go to air-to-ground 1 that time, and -

|108:10:20|CC|America, can you verify that you gave us NARROW on the HIGH GAIN?
|108:10:20|CMP|Houston, America. Say again.
|108:10:20|CC|Could you verify that you gave us NARROW on the HIGH GAIN ANTENNA, please?
|108:10:20|CMP|Negative, I gave you WIDE. (Laughter) I'll give you NARROW now.
|108:10:20|CC|Okay. I - I asked for WIDE awhile back, and guess we missed the call there.
|108:10:20|CC|Got your eyeball in that telescope?
|108:10:20|CMP|I'm about to.
|108:12:24|CMP|Okay, Houston; America. Had 50 percent on mag Charlie Charlie when I changed mags there for the landmark tracking. And let's see, frame 110, I think - or 112 - let me look on that one.
|108:12:24|CMP|Frame 103 on mag 00. Shoot. I mean, pardon the French, (laughter). Okay; go ahead, Challenger. How you guys doing?
|108:12:24|LMP-LM|Hey, Ron, this is ... coming up.
|108:12:24|CMP|Looks like it's pretty low down there.
|108:12:24|LMP-LM|Well, when you're up here looking ...
|108:12:24|CMP|(Laughter) I'll bet.
|108:16:55|CMP|Hey, Challenger; America.
|108:16:55|CC|Okay, America. You're coming up on 3 seconds to T-l.
|108:16:55|CMP|Okay, 3 seconds to T-l. Thank you.
|108:18:26|CMP|Okay, Challenger; America. Good luck on your PDI burn there. I'm going to track your landmark for you.

|108:18:26|CDR-LM|Okay, babe. Have a ...
|108:18:26|CMP|Will do.

|108:18:26|CMP|Yes, I got it, too.
|108:18:26|LMP-LM|Hey, ... We got the landing site; we're coming ...
|108:18:26|CMP|That slide really shows up beautiful.
|108:20:02|CC|Okay. Coining up on 30 seconds to T-2. Expect the AUTO pitch rate, and remember, the good old Sun is going to be staring at you - -
|108:20:02|CMP|Okay.
|108:20:02|CC|- Ñ when you come around.
|108:21:25|CMP|Beautiful results.
|108:21:25|CMP|Blink! There's the Sun in the sextant.
|108:21:25|CMP|Oh, those guys are going to have fun down there.
|108:21:25|CMP|(Laughter)
|108:23:16|CMP|Oh, Houston, I got so excited on that, I forgot to turn the camera On.
|108:23:16|CC|Oh, that's fair? You got any comments to make on any of those marks? They were - they were collecting the marks in real time. Do you have any that they ought to pay particular attention to?
|108:23:16|CMP|Well, let me think for a minute, now. They were all within the crater itself. None of them were outside of the crater. The - the last ones I took at - started taking marks at - beyond what the really time was, just because you could still see it. So I wouldn't put too much faith in those - in about the last four.
|108:23:16|CC|Okay. Sounds good.

|108:26:08|CMP|Okay. TRANSPONDER'S ON now.
|108:26:08|CC|America, sounds like Challenge" is c-t-ill working on their RESET, if you wsnt to go a'asad and get your 52 out of the way vhile you're waiting for the range check. That might save a little time.
|108:26:08|CMP|Okay. I think they're about ready to dc it now. Challenger, America. You about ready fcr a VHF RANGING?
|108:28:51|CMP|Okay. There goes RESET. Now.
|108:28:51|CMP|Ah-ha! It works! Point - 0.50 miles. Okay, 0,50 or 0.49 miles.
|108:30:07|CMP|Okay, I'm going to turn the RANGING, OFF, then. Comm's a little better that way.
|108:33:34|CMP|Okay, Houston, you copying the 93?
|108:33:34|CC|Yes, sir. Talk any time.
|108:33:34|CMP|Okay. We'll talk at 45:13:45.
|108:33:34|CC|Okay.
|108:33:34|CC|And, America; Houston. Have some vectors to send if you give us ACCEPT. And we're standing by with a pad.
|108:35:50|CMP|Okay, Houston; America, ready to copy. Pad's here, and you have ACCEPT.
|108:35:50|CC|Okay. First one will be the circ pad, or> the same page.
|108:35:50|CMP|Okay. Press on.

The ullage is four jets for 12 seconds. Comment on your PC: If you happen to notice the chamber pressure, it'll probably be running 90 to 95, and we're predicting that it'll show you about 6 psi less than what the actual chamber pressure is.
||||Tape 72B/5|Page 550
|108:35:50|CMP|Ah-ha! Okay, that's good to know on that chamber pressure. What you're saying is that even during the LOI burn, the velocity gain and what-have-you was - for chamber pressure, probably up around a little better than 100, huh?
|108:35:50|CC|Yes, sir.
|108:35:50|CC|We've got a couple of transducer problems we'll - -
|108:35:50|CMP|I've got a readback on that circ pad.

|108:35:50|CMP|Okay. Copy that. Hey, while I think about it, on the landmark tracking there in that lower attitude mark, the computer was pointing me - I wish. I knew. I'd have to get a map to look at the name of it, but there I consider Sherlock. And then the one to the south of that, and then another one to the south of that. There are three in a row. And it was pointing to the one just south of Sherlock - one about the same size as 17-1. Okay. A readback on RP-3. T-l, 112:17:01; T-2, 21:51, 23:31, 24:19; be north, 04 miles.

|108:40:55|CMP|Why don't I get started to the VERB 49 attitude, then I'll get the rest of the pads, okay?
|108:40:55|CC|All right, sir. I think that sounds like a good plan.
|108:40:55|CC|And we're through with our up-link, you can go to BLOCK when you want to.
|108:40:55|CMP|...
|108:40:55|CMP|Okay. Got you loud and clear, too.
|108:40:55|CMP|Okay, Houston. Okay. PROCEED. Okay, Challenger and Houston. I'm maneuvering to circ burn attitude - Okay, sure will - Ah-ha! Great!

|109:55:09|CC|Okay. Glad to hear it.
|109:55:09|CMP|And I'll give you some dope here. Okay, it was on time. Burn time, as near as I can tell, was 4 seconds. V was 69-9. Okay. The trim angles (jA were 357, 89, and 4 degrees of yaw. Okay, at the completion of the burn there, the NOUN 85's.
|109:55:09|LMP-LM|Okay, Houston. This is Challenger. How do you read ... LM data?
|109:55:55|CMP|The NOUN 85's were plus 1.70 and a minus 0.6. They are trimmed out to 00 and a plus 0.1. DELTA-was minus 10.0.
|109:55:55|LMP-LM|..., Houston. How do you read Challenger?
|109:55:55|CMP|And I didn't look at that one until 112 plus 00. Oxidizer was 30.3. Fuel was 31.1. And unbalance was minus 200. Over.
|109:55:55|CC|Okay, that sounds good.

|109:55:55|CMP|(Laughter) Okay, Ken; Jack keeps talking every time you do. So maybe you can keep one ear on them or something. I got T-l and 112:50:52; and I think T-2 was 55:42, and that's all I got.

|109:55:55|CC|Okay, America. Are you ready to try again on the P24 pad?
|109:55:55|CMP|Okay. Let's try it now.
|109:55:55|CC|Okay. 17-1: 112:50:52, 55^2, 57:22, 58:10; north 02.

|109:55:55|CC|Okay, that's correct. And you were starting to say something about your RPs - target?
|109:55:55|CMP|Yes. RP-3 is Just about the limit of high Sun angle that you could take to track that thing. I could track it up to TCA. And then, from TCA on across, you could hardly even tell there was a crater there, at all. It's just completely washed out.
|109:55:55|CC|Okay. I'll keep that in mind when they look at it.
|109:55:55|CMP|I think we got some good marks on it anyhow, though.
|109:55:55|CC|Real fine.
|110:00:06|CMP|Also, Houston, I lost the landmark at 24:01 instead of 24:19.
|110:00:06|CC|Okay.
|110:01:14|CC|Okay, America. We've taken one last look around your bird and it's looking good. So at least your half is GO for PDI.
|110:01:14|CMP|Okay, mighty fine. And I think that chamber pressure was up around 95* I really couldn't swear to it. So you might take a look at the read-out on the playback.
|110:01:14|CC|Okay. You got a mighty fast scamp ... to see all that.
|110:01:14|CMP|(Chuckle) That's what I say. I really couldn't swear to it.

|110:35:15|CMP|Okay. You have it.
|110:37:05|CMP|Yes. It1s a good thing it's in the sextant because you can't see it in the telescope. The Earth is in the field of view.
|110:37:05|CC|Are you able to get something in the sextant, or would you like for us to look for some new stars and attitudes?
||||Tape T4B/2|Page 582
|110:37:05|CMP|No. You can see them in the sextant real well, Ken. You just can't see them in the telescope.
|110:37:05|CC|Okay. That's a mighty pretty thing to look at in the telescope, though, isn't it?
|110:37:05|CMP|Yes, it sure is.
|110:37:05|CMP|You know, I noticed there's even a lot of difference in earthshine and - and in the double umbra. You get in earthshine on the thing, and it's - it's hard to see the stars even if you don't have the Earth in there.
|110:37:05|CC|Yes. That - that makes a surprising difference.
|110:37:05|CMP|The double umbra on the back side of the Moon -Yes. The double umbra on the back side of the Moon is even better than the simulator (laughter).
|110:39:36|CMP|Okay. If those look good to you, I'll torque at 20.
|110:39:36|CC|Okay. That looks good.
|110:45:18|CMP|Okay, Houston; this is America. I think I'll go ahead and use a shaft, 200.12, and a 57.470.
|110:45:18|CC|Okay. We copied that.
|110:45:18|CMP|That's for the COAS cal.
|110:45:18|CC|All righty. That thing flies a little better than the simulator on that, doesn't it?
|110:45:18|CMP|Yes. It sure does. It's outstanding, as a matter of fact. You can even see the star out here.
|110:45:18|CC|Yes, it's a rather wondrous thing. When you get around to it, I've got a HYDROGEN tank 1 call. I'd like to have you turn that to OFF.
|110:45:18|CMP|Okay. Let me get started here in the P20 attitude.
|110:45:18|CC|Sure thing.

|110:52:52|CC|Okay. Got my clock running.
|110:52:52|CMP|Okay.
|110:55:01|CMP|Still barber pole.
|110:55:01|CC|Yes. We're commenting on the same thing. We don't have any data yet, but ... - -
|110:55:01|CMP|(Laughter)
|110:55:01|CMP|Hey, it went gray.
|110:56:10|CMP|MARK it.
|110:56:10|CC|Okay. Thank you.
|110:56:10|CMP|About 3 minutes and 20 seconds, wasn't it?
|110:56:10|CC|Yes, sir. 03:21. Okay, Ron. And before we get started this morning, we skipped the Lithium caninter, and that was back at 108 hours and 10 minutes on page 3-109. So, at your convenience, you might want to catch up on that one.
|110:56:10|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. Do you have it handy there? What it is? Which one?
|110:56:10|CC|Yes. Just a second. I'll read it to you.
|110:56:10|CMP|Can you just tell me?
|110:57:00|CC|Okay. We wanted to take 11 into A, and stow number 9È which you're going to take out, into A-9.
|110:57:00|CMP|Into A-9. Okay. That must be where 11 is then.

|110:57:00|CC|Eleven should be in - Yes, okay. Get all of you in A-9 now, hopefully.
|110:57:00|CMP|(Whistling)
|111:01:01|CMP|Okay. The old lithium hydroxide canister's changed.
|111:01:01|CC|Okay. Thank you.
|111:01:01|CMP|And, Ken, can you give me a hack on Houston time there? Or Greenwich mean time or something so I can set my watch?
|111:02:16|CC|Okay. I'll give you Houston time. It's 14:35=21 -2-3-4- 5.
|111:02:16|CMP|Okay. Mighty fine. Thank you.
|111:03:25|CC|Okay, America. We're about 3 minutes from LOS. All systems look good. And G&C has noticed that you've got the OPTICS not in ZERO, and next time you're down that way, it would make everybody feel better if you'd put it there. It's not - not something that you have to do right away.
|111:03:25|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. Will do. Good way to keep me honest.
|111:03:58|CC|And a ... to that.

|111:56:01|CMP|... vent's closed. Okay, Houston. This is America. Looks like we have you for good now.
|111:56:01|CC|Roger. Ron, you're looking great. We need a -words on the spacecraft condition. We got a couple of rockets out at White Sands ready to launch for a UV calibration, and we need the GO from you on that.
|111:56:01|CMP|(Laughter) Yes, I'm great up here. They're not going to try to hit me, are they?
|111:56:01|CC|No, babe. We wouldn't do that. These are a couple of calibration rockets on Aerobee.
|111:56:01|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. Sounds great. Tape motion has stopped, by the way. And I'm ready to charge battery B.
|111:56:01|CC|Roger. That's a GO on that.
|111:56:01|CMP|By the way, battery - Okay - the battery compartment pressure went up to 0.8 after 3 or 4 days here.
|111:56:01|CC|Roger, Ron. We copy that.
|111:57:18|CMP|Okay. BUS TIES are OFF; PYR0 BUS TIES are OPEN. Let's see about BUS A and B. I think those are OPEN. Yes, they're OPEN.

|111:58:24|CMP|Okay. PAN CAMERA POWER is OFF. And - let's see. Is the time for the lunar sounder stuff?
|111:58:24|CC|Got about 3 minutes on that, Ron.
|111:58:24|CMP|Okay.
|111:58:24|CMP|You know, all I did was eat for 3 days. And now I don't even get a chance to eat.
|111:58:24|CC|Roger. You getting hungry?
|111:58:24|CDR|I've had two gingerbread bars and a brownie, so far.
|111:58:24|CC|Yes. We1 re going to keep you busy.
|111:58:24|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. That's good.
|111:58:24|CC|I understand they left you some scissors so you can eat. Huh?
|111:58:24|CMP|Yes, fortunately. I still got them. I even got them tied down this time.
|111:58:24|CC|Roger.
|111:58:24|CMP|Did Challenger figure out where they are? Are they pretty close to - the center of the ellipse?
|111:58:24|CC|They look like they're a couple of hundred meters short, Ron. No problem. They landed in a smooth area. And that's what counted.
|111:58:24|CMP|Oh, that's great.
|112:02:11|CMP|Okay. LUNAR SOUNDER OPERATE is in STANDBY. RECORDER is going ON. RADAR is going ON. RECORDER is gone OFF. OFF to center; not to HEATERS. And the MODE is going to VHF.
|112:02:11|CC|Thank you, Ron. I've got that pan camera photo pad any time you want it.
|112:02:11|CMP|Okay. Let's see, 116:30. Huh?

|112:04:09|CMP|HIGH GAIN to AUTO.
|112:04:09|CMP|And, Houston; America here. I'm ready to do the LUNAR SOUNDER EXTEND test here for a while, if you want. Whenever your ready.
|112:04:09|CC|Roger. Stand by, Ron.
|112:05:40|CC|Okay, America. We're ready for the HF ANTENNA EXTEND test, and, just for your information, White Sands got one of the rockets off. The other one was a NO GO.
|112:05:40|CMP|Oh, okay. Good.
|112:06:02|CMP|Okay. HF ANTENNA 1. Barber pole. 1001, 1002. It's OFF. Gray. Okay; number 1, RETRACT, barber pole. Barber pole? No barber pole. Very interesting.
|112:06:02|CMP|Would you believe number 1 stuck out there?
|112:06:02|CC|Roger, Ron. We're seeing stall current right now.
|112:06:02|CC|Ron, we'd like to go OFF on HF ANTENNA 1. And standby on number 2.
|112:06:02|CMP|Okay; it's OFF, and, of course, it went gray again.
|112:06:02|CC|Roger.
|112:06:02|CMP|You say standby for number 2?
|112:06:02|CC|Stand by on that, Ron. Don't do number 2 yet.
||||Tape 75B/4|Page 608
|112:06:02|CMP|Okay. I won't do it yet.
|112:09:51|CC|America, Houston. We'd like to try ANTENNA 1 again We'd like you to go EXTEND for barber pole plus 3 seconds, then OFF, then RETRACT.
|112:09:51|CMP|Okay. We'll try that. HF number 1, EXTEND. 1001, 1002, 1003. It's OFF. And, of course, I got a barber pole as it was going up. Okay; you want to try RETRACT again?
|112:09:51|CC|That's affirmative.
|112:10:32|CMP|Okay. HF for number 1 to RETRACT, now. And a barber pole.
|112:10:32|CC|Ron, we'd like you to turn it OFF now.
|112:11:14|CMP|Okay; it's OFF, and the talkback is gray.
|112:13:56|CC|Ron, Houston here. On that one, we followed your RETRACT current in for 7 seconds, and then it went into stall; so it apparently is the track -it's retracting normally up to a point, and then goes into stall. We'd like you to press on and do EXTEND on HF ANTENNA 2. And we're going to press on here, probably thinking like maybe we won't get the antennas in. And on ANTENNA 2 - -
|112:13:56|CMP|Okay.
|112:13:56|CC|- - it's - it's according to the Flight Plan, barber pole plus 2 seconds.
|112:13:56|CMP|Okay; we'll go barber pole plus 2.
|112:14:31|CMP|Okay. Number 2, EXTEND. Barber pole 1001, 1002, Off. Okay; number 2 going to RETRACT, now. Barber pole 1001, 1002. Hey! Okay; it went gray - and back to OFF.
|112:14:31|CC|Roger. We copy that.
|112:14:31|CC|Okay, Ron. You're GO for the extending, and just a reminder on the Flight Plan, there's a RECORDER, ON, prior to the EXTEND there.
||||Tape 75B/5|Page 609
|112:14:31|CMP|Oh, okay; that's good.
|112:15:28|CMP|Okay. RECORDER'S going ON. And we'll extend number 1. Let me get the clock going here. Okay; 3, 2, 1 -
|112:15:44|CMP|MARK it.
|112:15:44|CC|Currents are looking good. The extension is looking normal, so far. And the Aerobee rocket had some problem - -
|112:15:44|CMP|Okay; great.
|112:15:44|CC|- - and didn't get a chance to look at the Sun.
|112:15:44|CMP|Uh-oh.
|112:15:44|CC|And they're going to try and launch a couple more the day after tomorrow.
|112:15:44|CMP|Very good.
|112:16:45|CMP|Hey, I think I can see a light spot down there on the landing site where they might have blown off some of that halo stuff.
|112:16:45|CC|Roger. Interesting, interesting comment.
|112:16:45|CMP|It's between Sherlock and Camelot - between -
|112:17:00|CMP|Hey, it's gray now on the number 1 EXTEND.
|112:17:00|CC|Roger. We got it. And we got - we copy it's all the way out down here. You can to go 0EF on that one.
|112:17:08|CMP|Okay; number 2 is going to - it's OFF. And number 2 is going to EXTEND.
|112:17:08|CC|Okay, Ron. The currents look normal on number 2 while it extends.
|112:17:08|CMP|Okay.
|112:18:17|CMP|Hey, I can see number 2.
||||Tape 75B/6|Page 610
|112:18:17|CC|Roger. That's good show. It's going to be moving, Ron.
|112:18:17|CMP|All the way out there. It is?
|112:18:17|CMP|My window's all fogged up here, and can't see a thing.
|112:18:17|CC|Roger.
|112:18:17|CC|Okay, Ron. We show it all the way out - -
|112:18:17|CMP|Fogged up on the ... side ...
|112:18:17|CC|- - so you can go ahead and turn it off.
|112:19:09|CMP|Okay; we'll turn it off.
|112:19:09|CMP|Houston, this is America.
|112:19:09|CC|Go ahead, Ron.
|112:19:09|CMP|I didn't have my map there, but I was looking at the landing site, and as close as I can remember, it had to be somewhere around about DN 83.3 on the 200-meter scale, the TL25-8.
|112:19:09|CC|Okay, Ron. I'm coming up on some Flight Plan operations on the mapping camera that you might want to check.
|112:19:09|CMP|Thank you.
|112:19:09|CMP|Okay.
|112:23:58|CMP|Probably dark down there. MAPPING CAMERA to OFF.
|112:24:49|CMP|Okay; MAPPING CAMERA to STANDBY. LASER ALTIMETER, OFF, IMAGE MOTION, OFF. Barber pole; gray.
|112:25:08|CMP|MAPPING CAMERA to OFF.
|112:26:09|CMP|Let's see. PAN CAMERA SELF TEST, OFF. And it's after sunset. UV, OFF. IR is OFF. DATA SYSTEM is OFF. SM/AC POWER, we're going to get that OFF. SM/AC POWER is OFF. Okay; it looks like 12. LUNAR SOUNDER to OPERATE.
||||Tape 75B/7|Page 611
|112:29:01|CC|America, while we're waiting for this lunar sounder to operate for 2 minutes, could you - could you say again those coordinates you gave us. I dug out the map TL 25-8, and I got the 83-3, but what was the azimuth coordinate on that, Ron?
|112:29:01|CMP|It was Dog November, and maybe just a little bit to the right of Dog November.
|112:29:01|CC|Okay; Dog November. Thank you. And you think that's where they are, huh?
|112:29:01|CMP|Yes.
|112:29:01|CC|Okay.
|112:29:01|CMP|Well, there's the - there's a real white spot down there, you know. And I didn't have - I only got a short - I only got a look at that thing for about 30 seconds before I had to so something else. But I'm just re - re - recalling in my mind where the - where the white spot is with respect to those - there's Camelot and there's Sherlock, and them from Camelot to Sherlock, there were two other craters, and they were just a little bit closer to Camelot, but between those two other craters there.
|112:29:01|CC|Good show. Roger.
|112:29:01|CMP|There's a white spot - yes, there's a white spot on the - like it might have been dust blowing or something, you know.
|112:29:01|CC|Roger. That may be the - the rocket exhaust. It might be just a little off that light spot.
|112:29:01|CMP|Yes.
|112:29:01|CC|Okay, Ron. We're ready for LUNAR SOUNDER, OPERATE to OPERATE. And if you'll give me a mark, I'll time it out for you.

|112:48:04|CMP|Boy, you talk about night flying, this is the kind of night flying you want to do, by the full Earth.
|112:48:04|CC|Is that right?
|112:48:04|CMP|Beautiful out there.
|112:50:04|CMP|Okay. It went to STANDBY at 30.

|112:51:08|CMP|Okay. Are you going to try to pull that antenna back in first before we completely change the Flight Plan?
|112:51:08|CC|Ron, we're going to take a good hard look at that, and see if we can generate up either a test on that or what. That's kind of in limbo right now, Ron. These Flight Plan changes - -
|112:51:08|CMP|Oh, okay.
|112:51:08|CC|- - these Flight Plan changes I've got for you coming up later will be all some items Farouk has on camera pictures on the - that spot Jack thought he saw the light spot and a few other changes.
|112:51:08|CMP|Oh, okay.
|112:51:08|CC|And, Ron, just for your information, regardless of what we do on that antenna, we won't have any Flight Plan changes until after 144 hours due to that antenna.
|112:51:08|CMP|Oh! Okay,
|112:51:08|CC|Ron, we would like Hg tank 2 FANS to ON.
|112:54:00|CMP|tank 2 FANS are ON, now.

|113:54:45|CMP|So far as I know.
|113:54:45|CC|Okay, great. Anytime you want to start taking a Flight Plan update, just let me know.
|113:54:45|CMP|Okay. (Cough) Give me a little bit of time to lead into the landing site there, and we can go ahead and do it now.
|113:54:45|CC|Okay.
|113:54:45|CC|The first thing is at 119:00, 119:00. Add the following words, Ron: "Configure camera." In parenthesis, "Earthshine photos. CM5, command module 5 window/November Kilo. Nikon/55/VHBW." That's Victor Hotel Bravo Whiskey.

|113:54:45|CC|Okay. Go down to 119:24 and add the following. Let me just read it to you in - quickly here, so you can put in the words you want to. The words are "Point at target marked by LMP. Use same technique as for Copernicus central peak."
|113:54:45|CMP|Okay. We'll point at the target by the LMP. Use the same technique, which is starting out at 1 second - -
|113:54:45|CC|Roger, Let me read it to you.
|113:54:45|CMP|- - was it 30 seconds?
|113:54:45|CC|Roger, 1 second, two frames; 1/2 second, two frames; 1/4 second, two frames; 1/8 second, two frames; l/l6 second, two frames. On Copernicus, we're using a 30-second interval. It's not important, - the interval. It's mainly just the stop settings on that. You're going to use a total of 10 frames.
|113:54:45|CMP|Okay.
|113:54:45|CC|Okay, then add the following after that: After completion of above, switch to window CB3. For 8 frame of end of target, Papa 17 Delta. At 30-second intervals. Record frame number.
|113:59:52|CMP|Okay, I've got to switch to window number 3 for end of target. Say again, the target number.
|113:59:52|CC|P, as in Papa; 17 Delta, D as in Delta. 17 Delta.
|113:59:52|CMP|Okay, Papa 17 Delta.
|113:59:52|CC|As 30-second intervals.
|113:59:52|CC|Okay, Ron. There is a caution note on this. It's a note concerning the frame usage.
||||Tape 76B/3|Page 630
|113:59:52|CMP|Seems to me like Zebra Zebra only has 18 frames, doesn't it?
|113:59:52|CC|That's affirm. Do not exceed 18 frames. The balance of mag Zebra Zebra was used for preflight calibration. Do not exceed 18 frames. You can put that down any way you want it.
|113:59:52|CMP|Okay.
|113:59:52|CC|Okay. Under rev 17, I've got a note - a similar note, Ron, for rev 17.
|113:59:52|CMP|Okay.
|113:59:52|CC|The note is, do not exceed 40 frames on earthshine mag Whiskey Whiskey. Balance of magazine was used for preflight cal. I'll say again, do not exceed 40 frames on earthshine mag Whiskey Whiskey.
|113:59:52|CMP|Okay, on mag Whiskey Whiskey don't exceed 40 frames. The balance is already on calibration.
|113:59:52|CC|That's affirmative. And I've got three notes then, Ron, just general notes - may come up in the crew film area. Mag Papa Papa for crew option. Just use mag Papa Papa for crew option. Do not use Kilo Kilo for crew option. Do not use Kilo Kilo for crew option. The last one is save all the remaining VHBW on Quebec Quebec and Romeo Romeo for scheduled photos. We have a very small margin on each.
|113:59:52|CC|... end of update.
|113:59:52|CMP|That was - Okay, save all remaining on Quebec Quebec. And what was the other one, Jack?
|113:59:52|CC|Romeo Romeo.
|113:59:52|CMP|Okay, no extras on those two, then - on the VHBW, huh?
|113:59:52|CC|Yes, we got a very small margin on those now. And, you're about 10 minutes prior to landing site orbital. Why don't you go over and start studying that, if you want?
||||Tape 76B/4|Page 631
|114:03:20|CMP|Okay.
|114:11:52|CMP|You know you look at - next to Macrobius A, there is a lind of a dark halo-type crater there. Very small one. And it doesn't have the appearance of a hummocky crater rim to it, at all. It looks like the material just kind of spreads out all over the area, but it doesn't have a hummocky appearance to it. I'm going to take a look at that again when I come back - on back around on the other side. There's a small mound down in the bottom of the crater, also. It's a domicalshaped structure in the bottom of that small crater. It's right next to J3. North of J3.
|114:11:52|CC|Roger, Ron.
|114:11:52|CMP|Coming in, I can see the landing site, now -quite well. The appearance of the slide area definitely shows up. The South Massif seems to have the Sun shining right on the walls. I'm looking for any type of layering, or anything like that. And can't see anything that - that would show that up. The big difference between the massif structures and the Sculptured Hills is that the massifs look like they are a steeper slope. And they - they don't seem to have that type of covering over them, like the Sculptured Hills do.
|114:11:52|CMP|I'm right over now. The scarp definitely cuts up through the North Massif. I can't see continuation on into the South Massif at all. But, you can definitely see a vertical exaggeration as it cuts on around up over the North Massif. And it's almost - I'd have to take another look at it for sure, but it almost looks like a flow coming from Family or in the vicinity - in the direction of Family Mountain - but from the direction of Family Mountain - lapping up on the side of the North Massif. That's the way it looks as you go on by it. I couldn't see anything that would lead you to believe that the slide area, so to speak, would come on across anything that would be the source of that slide area. I still think I can see the -one spot that has a lighter albedo than the surrounding area there in the Pentagon complex. And it's pretty close to the - Let me get my chart out here and take a look at it again.
||||Tape T6B/5|Page 632
|114:16:50|CMP|No, it still looks like that area that's blown away there is Dog November - between Dog November and Dog Papa. And about 83.4 or something like that.
|114:17:07|CC|Copy.
|114:17:07|CMP|Yes, just like the map shows, and all the pictures, you've got a definite demarcation in the annulus around Serenitatis here, as you look by Sulpicius Gallus area. As you look at it - I'm going to have to take another check on it - but the dark annulus looks to me like it's raised above the mare, proper, itself. I'll check that a little more as we come on across.
|114:17:07|CMP|You know all those rilles to the north of - I mean to the west of Sulpicius Gallus. There is a bunch of crisscrossing. One is right on the edge of the Serenitatis basin - and I don't remember the name of that crater, I'll have to look it up later - but they've got slightly raised rims around the rilles. You can see some layering down inside the rille itself, in the east-west and the one that runs in the east-west direction.
|114:17:07|CC|Roger. You're talking about near Menelaus?
|114:17:07|CMP|Yes, I'll have to look on the map and see for sure what the crater is, but there's an impact crater right on the edge of Serenitatis basin -right on the terminator. Right now.
|114:17:07|CC|P.oger.
|114:17:07|CMP|And then those rilles are just to the north of that crater.
|114:17:07|CC|Roger. That's probably Menelaus - M-e-n-e-l-a-u-s -Menelaus.
||||Tape 76B/6|Page 633
|114:17:07|CMP|I think it is.
|114:17:07|CC|Okay, Ron. Is The PAN CAMERA, OFF? T-stop time. PAN CAMERA to STANDBY. T-stop time.
|114:17:07|CMP|Okay. Is it now?
|114:17:07|CC|Roger. You're just a little bit past it.
|114:17:07|CMP|Oh, okay, thank you. (Chuckle) Okay, PAN CAMERA -STANDBY. Thank you. That's the first chance I had to look at the Moon, you know. These guys - -
|114:17:07|CC|Roger.
|114:17:07|CMP|- - let me look at the windows.
|114:17:07|CC|That's all right. We don't mind calling you, if you don't mind getting the call.
|114:17:07|CMP|(Chuckle) No, not in the least.
|114:17:07|CC|Ron, I'll give you a cue here shortly for PAN CAMERA - OFF. I just want you to know, we will not be retracting the mapping camera; and, therefore, we will not be closing the mapping camera, laser altimeter cover. But we will be dumping normally. Over.
|114:17:07|CMP|Okay. We're going to dump with the mapper open, is what you're saying, huh?
|114:17:07|CC|That * s aff innative.
|114:17:07|CMP|Okay.
|114:17:07|CMP|You know it looks to me like it all disappears anyhow. It just kind of leaves the spacecraft. I don't think anything comes around or even sticks around.
|114:17:07|CC|Roger, Ron.
|114:22:03|CC|At your convenience, HIGH GAIN to AUTO.
|114:22:03|CMP|You have HIGH GAIN to AUTO.
||||Tape 76B/7|Page 634
|114:22:03|CC|Thank you, sir.
|114:22:03|CMP|Okay, it's orbital science photos coming up here. Do you want to use magazine KK still? Or should we finish up Oscar Oscar?
|114:22:03|CC|Stand by, Ron. Checking with Tommy on that one.
|114:22:03|CC|Ron, they'd like you to use mag KK on that.
|114:22:03|CMP|Okay.
|114:22:03|CC|While you're looking at the Flight Plan there, at 117'-20 where that mapping camera stuff - just delete mapping camera, retract; and mapping camera, laser altimeter cover, closed at 117:15-
|114:22:03|CMP|Okay. Delete mapping camera, retract; arid mapping camera, laser altimeter, closed. Okay.
|114:22:03|CC|Roger.
|114:22:03|CMP|Okay, magazine KK is starting with 21 pictures.
|114:22:03|CC|Roger. We copy.
|114:22:03|CMP|Okay. Bob, if - would you give me a call when you get ready for that mapping camera stuff? I was kind of shoved off this morning, and I got to sample their buses.
|114:22:03|CC|Yes. Roger, Ron. We'll give you a call - first one will probably be a pan camera call here shortly, and then I'll call you when it's time for those purge line heaters - things like that.
|114:26:20|CMP|Okay.
|114:26:20|CC|Okay, Ron, PAN CAMERA POWER to OFF.
|114:28:22|CMP|Okay, PAR CAMERA POWER - Let's see. PAN CAMERA POWER is OFF.
|114:28:22|CC|Thank you, sir.
|114:28:22|CMP|Good.
||||Tape 76B/8|Page 635
|114:28:22|CMP|Hey, this is not so bad, if you think of iced tea, I guess.
|114:28:22|CC|Roger.
|114:28:22|CC|Just for your information, Ron. Gene's out on the surface right now.
|114:28:22|CMP|Oh, they are? Hey, great I
|114:28:22|CMP|Did they confirm my position yet?
|114:28:22|CC|I don't - Let me check here - I don't think we have it pinned down exactly. You're pretty darn close to it. That's for sure.
|114:32:25|CMP|You know, it's funny. It wasn't as bright - That pass over - This last pass - as it was the time before.
|114:41:05|CC|I hope you haven't - I hope you haven't spilled any; and, by the way, LMP is on the surface now, too.
|114:41:05|CC|America, Houston. You can go with the HO PURGE HEATERS now.
|114:41:05|CC|America, Houston.
|114:41:05|CMP|Houston, America. Go ahead.
|114:41:05|CC|Roger. You can go with the H2 PURGE LINE HEATERS and the rest of that Flight Plan.
|114:41:05|CMP|Okay. What do you know? The PURGE LINE HEATERS have been ON.
|114:41:05|CC|Roger. We kind of suspected that.
|114:41:05|CMP|Okay. (Laughter) Okay. Let's see. MAPPING CAMERA can come OFF. Thirty seconds.
|114:45:31|CMP|Okay, MAPPING CAMERA is going to STANDBY. IM PITCH MOTION is OFF. Altimeter - LASER ALTIMETER -is OFF. UV is OFF. IR is OFF. Okay, UV cover -box. UV COVER is CLOSED; barber pole, gray. IR COVER is CLOSED; barber pole, gray. Okay, MAP CAMERA LASER ALTIMETER - we'll leave that one OPEN.
||||Tape T6B/9|Page 636
|114:45:31|CC|Good show, Ron.
|114:45:31|CMP|Okay. Then it's my understanding you don't want to do any dumping until I go on the back side of the Moon. Is that correct?
|114:45:31|CC|That's affirm, Ron.
|114:45:31|CMP|Okay.
|114:45:31|CC|According to the Flight Plan, you do it at 117:50. Right about that time.
|114:45:31|CMP|Okay. Will do.
|114:48:23|CMP|Bob, one little notice. Supplies I had this morning. Might made notes, so I wouldn't forget about it. It was when you go to tunnel vent, it takes a heck of a long time to vent that tunnel. In the simulator down there, you go to tunnel vent, and it flips right down and vents. And I was beginning to wonder if it - if it was leaking or something.
|114:48:23|CC|Roger.
|114:48:23|CMP|As it turned out, as it turns out, it worked out all right. But I bet it took a good 10 minutes, -to get up to 3.5. Before I could turn the jets back on, you know.
|114:48:23|CC|Roger.
|114:48:23|CMP|Go, that's ready to go.
|114:48:23|CC|Ron, just one reminder as we go around the horn here. The waste water - the way - the position it is in will probably take between 10 and 12 minutes to dump it completely. Or dump it to your .10 percent number.
|114:48:23|CMP|Okay, that's good. Oh, glad I don't have anybody watching for me this time. Do I?
|114:48:23|CC|Yes, that's right. We won't be able to call you on that. When it's down to 8 percent.
||||Tape 76B/10|Page 637
|114:48:23|CMP|(Laughter) Okay, I'll put my old timer on.
|114:48:23|CC|Hey, Ron, one other reminder. We know it's in the Flight Plan, but you may get real busy just prior to that orbital science photos. And EECOM would like to make sure you get the H purge line heaters off, as scheduled, at 118:02.
|114:48:23|CMP|Okay. Okay, is she in there? Yes - it's in the Flight Plan. Okay.
|114:53:21|CC|Roger; it's in the Flight Plan. But it's just before you're going to get busy on that orbital science photo. You might of - you might go to the window earlier or something.
|114:53:21|CMP|Okay. It's a good point.
|114:53:21|CC|And your friends out on the surface have the Rover out now and - starting to load it up and getting ready to check it out.
|114:53:21|CMP|Hey, great 1
|114:53:21|CC|The surface work is going really good. They're just a little bit behind the time line from their suiting-up exercise. But it doesn't make a whole lot of difference.
|114:53:21|CMP|Uhuh. Uhuh. 250 lens on that thing.
|114:58:19|CC|Ron, you're 5 minutes to LOS here. And you're looking real good all around the room. No problems with any of the systems that we can see. We'll see it at 118:29. And we'll be with you for another 5 minutes here.
|114:58:19|CMP|118:29, okay. Okay, we're going to have a little grape drink.
|114:58:19|CC|Just remember what Jan says. Don't spill it on your flight suit.
|114:58:19|CMP|(Laughter) Right.
||||Tape 76B/11|Page 638
|114:58:19|CMP|Did I miss lunch? Or wasn't I supposed to get any lunch today?
|114:58:19|CC|I don't know, that wasn't on my shift. But if you're hungry, why don't you eat something?
|114:58:19|CMP|(Laughter) That's what I'm doing.
|114:58:19|CC|It's been a long time since lunch - -
|114:58:19|CMP|I'm nibbling.
|114:58:19|CMP|Yes. Long time since breakfast, I think, wasn't it?
|114:58:19|CC|Yes, I think it was. And you got about 4 more hours until scheduled eat time. So - you got some lunar sounder work there - and about 119 or so, so you might as well consider eating a lot.
|114:58:19|CMP|Yes, I could eat dinner. I'm kind of nibbling a little bit.
|114:58:19|CC|Just want to make sure you don't lose your scissors, too.
|114:58:19|CMP|Yes. This time I got them snapped to the hand controller and stuck in the little thing around it. I don't know how I've lost those things.
|114:58:19|CC|Roger.
|114:58:19|CMP|I didn't like that big string on there all the time. I didn't like that big string getting all over the place. So I rolled the string on the strap, and stuck the scissors in that little bungee that's on the hand controller. I woke up the next morning and they're gone. I still think it's behind the optics.
|114:58:19|CC|Just don't go look at them; okay? We'll find them pre - postflight. Okay?
|114:58:19|CMP|Okay.
||||Tape 76B/12|Page 639
|114:58:19|CC|Hey, Ron. I don't know what Tommy has against you, but they just never scheduled an eat period in here. We checked this out so thoroughly that, we forgot to check it to see if there was an eat period in there.
|114:58:19|CMP|We probably weren't hungry when we checked it out.
|115:00:54|CC|Roger.

|115:51:12|CMP|Hey, great!
|115:51:12|CC|And Bob just passed word that they just dropped the scissors up there, but they found them under the dirt awhile. Anyway, they almost lost a pair of scissors.
|115:51:12|CMP|(Laughter) Oh, come on now. They've only got one pair, too, I think. Unless both of them ended up over there.
|115:51:12|CC|Get some good pictures of Aitken there, Ron?
|115:51:12|CMP|Yes, I sure did.
|115:51:12|CC|Out of curiosity - -
|115:51:12|CMP|Almost missed ... picture.

|116:06:24|CMP|Gee whiz.
|116:07:118|CMP|Okay. Finally got mag ZZ on the ole Nikon.
|116:07:118|CC|Roger. Looking at the Flight Plan, Ron, you're coming up on selecting OMNI Bravo and setting up the HIGH GAIN and pow - powering it OFF-, and getting ready for the LUNAR SOUNDER receive only section here.

|116:09:52|CMP|(Laughter) Very good. I was just curious. I don't hear them. I thought maybe I could hear them. Yes, have a ball down there, guys.
|116:13:40|CC|Okay, Ron. We're - It looks like we're about 30 seconds in front of OPERATE. Right there on OPERATE,
|116:13:40|CMP|Okay.
|116:13:40|CC|And we're not going to have a number - - any calls here for a good 40 minutes, so this is a good time to catch up on your meal regimen there if you want, Ron.
|116:13:40|CMP|(Laughter) Okay.
|116:20:59|CC|Ron, when you get a chance, we'd like H TANK 3 FAN to OFF.
|116:21:09|CMP|Okay. H£ TANK 3 FANS are OFF.
|116:21:09|CC|Roger,
|116:21:09|CMP|Hey, Bob. Did Jack call down where that flash is -where he saw that light flash?
|116:21:09|CC|Roger.
|116:21:09|CMP|Okay. I've got a mark next to Riccioli G -Riccioli Golf. Is that correct?
|116:21:09|CC|That's affirmative. We - we circled it - at Grimaldi B and the east and north of Grimaldi B, right in that area.
|116:21:09|CMP|Okay. We've put it just - got a little X about the diameter of Riccioli G, to the west of Riccioli G.
||||Tape 77B/5|Page 690
|116:21:09|CC|Okay. That's probably - -
|116:21:09|CMP|... west of it.
|116:21:09|CC|That's probably - he didn't ever call the - I'll ask FAO here, but I don't think he ever called the actual - coordinates on it. I'll ask FAO. That's probably close enough. They'll probably all be in the picture anyway, wouldn't it?
|116:21:09|CMP|Oh, yes. They'll all be in the picture anyhow.
|116:21:09|CMP|You'll never believe it, but I saw lightning flash down there too. I don't know. That last rev. Did you hear that?
|116:21:09|CC|Roger. We heard that, Ron. The thought that occurs to us, should you be seeing the - those cosmic ray flashes just while you're looking at the lunar surface and getting that effect?
|116:21:09|CMP|Yes, that's what I'm wondering myself, you know.
|116:21:09|CC|As Charlie said, he mentioned he'd seen something similar to that and possibly thought it was that. And we were thinking that maybe what it was with Jack, but it won't hurt to take a picture of the area anyway.
|116:21:09|CMP|Well, I think we'll try taking a picture of it, but I think I tend to agree with you. That's probably what it was.
|116:21:09|CC|We're just guessing just like anybody else on that. We're just - just guessing on it, Ron.
|116:21:09|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. Nothing showing up on the seismometer anyhow ...
|116:21:09|CC|Well, you have to remember on the seismometer, on at least the one for Jack's call, the S-IVB had just clobbered the seismometer, and - and that there was something small impact that when the -it was in the mud, you wouldn't have seen it.
|116:21:09|CMP|Oh, okay; sure.
||||Tape 77B/6|Page 691
|116:27:58|CC|Ron, I know you're wondering. All the data so far on the lunar sounder has come out real good, and the HP pass is looking real good.
|116:27:58|CMP|Oh, that's dandy! Hey, that's great!
|116:27:58|CMP|Let's hope something is going on the film.
|116:27:58|CC|That's - that's Roger on that. We sure hope so.
|116:27:58|CMP|(Laughter) Oh, I'm sure it is.
|116:27:58|CC|You take another look at Copernicus, or did you eat during the test?
|116:27:58|CMP|Just stuck my head out the window. I've got to find it. There it is, right here.
|116:27:58|CMP|Oh., boy. Just wasn't quite light adapted there. I'm not sure if you could really tell ... going through there or not.
|116:27:58|CC|Roger. Understand.
|116:27:58|CMP|You know, light and dark albedos show up real well. You can see some indication of terrain; that is, hilliness or burrows or - or grabens or rilles. Of course, the fresh craters show up a - lot wider with, respect to the surrounding territory than I think they do in the - on the bright side, you know? With the Sun shining on them.
|116:27:58|CC|Roger.
|116:33:20|CC|Gene became the first auto-mechanic on the Moon as one of the rear fenders fell off the Rover right after they deployed it, so he had to tape it on with some tape.
|116:33:20|CMP|(Laughter) Oh, he did? Well, they were pretty much sure those things were going to fall off anyhow.
|116:33:20|CC|Yes, they were willing to bet on it.
|116:33:35|CMP|You can't pack them in there, you have to - yes - -
||||Tape 78B/1|Page 736
|116:34:54|CC|Roger.
|116:34:54|CMP|I should be able to get back there next rev, I guess.
|116:34:54|CC|Roger. Look like a gamma up there? Is that why they call it a gamma?
|116:34:54|CMP|Hey, that sure does. Oddly enough, it almost looks like an elongated crater in this - this light.
|116:34:54|CC|Roger.
|116:34:54|CMP|You know, with the gamma part of it ...
|116:34:54|CC|Now, we've got both of - we got two - or a number of picture-taking sections here next rev, but we got that sequence on Copernicus and that sequence on Reiner Gamma there.
|116:34:54|CMP|Aha. Okay.
|116:34:54|CMP|And now, I'll see if I can find Riccioli.
|116:34:54|CMP|I should be able to see Grimaldi, I think.
|116:34:54|CC|Getting pretty easy to locate yourself as you go along your track?
|116:34:54|CMP|Yes, it's starting to get that way. It's not as good as I - as I want it yet. Every once in awhile, you look out of the window, you don't have the slightest idea where you are (chuckle).
|116:34:54|CC|Right.
|116:34:54|CMP|Yes, I can see Grimaldi and Riccioli coming up now. Just passing over the edge of the mare ...
||||Tape 78B/2|Page 737
|116:32:54|CC|Roger. That's Grimaldi mare there?
|116:32:54|CMP|Yes, I can see it coming up.
|116:32:54|CC|Okay.
|116:32:54|CMP|There's a pretty stark difference between the mare and the - I guess you might as well go ahead and call them highlands, that's what they look like.
|116:32:54|CMP|East of Procellarum, in fact just before you get to Grimaldi.
|116:44:32|CMP|Okay, I want to switch to window 3. A little better to try and get the pictures.
|116:44:32|CC|Roger.
|116:44:32|CMP|Getting too much glare on the windows.
|116:44:32|CMP|Okay, Bob. That is correct. Now, you want to continue on across here at a 15th, huh?
|116:44:32|CC|Roger.
|116:48:53|CC|Okay, Ron. No ... for picture taking, but you need to select OMNI A when you get a chance.
|116:48:53|CMP|Okay.
|116:48:53|CMP|There you go.
|116:48:53|CC|Good show.
|116:48:53|CMP|Say, I can only take 18 pictures on that, I think.
|116:48:53|CC|Say again, Ron.
|116:48:53|CMP|It will only take 18 pictures, I think.
|116:48:53|CC|Roger.
|116:48:53|CMP|(Laughter) Fool around in here by yourself, and you get disoriented.
||||Tape 78B/3|Page 738
|116:54:05|CMP|Well, I didn't see any slices down there that time.
|116:54:05|CC|Roger.
|116:54:05|CC|Hey, you're looking good, Ron. You're right on the Flight Plan. We haven't missed a thing yet today, I don't think. In really good shape.
|116:54:05|CMP|Oh, okay. Good. I tell you, there's a little more hussling up here than I thought there would be though.
|116:54:05|CC|Keeping you busy, huh?
|116:54:05|CMP|(Laughter) Yes, a little bit. That's all right. It's fun.
|116:54:05|CC|Just don't want you to get lonely up there.
|116:54:05|CMP|(Laught er) Sure won't.
|116:54:05|CMP|Okay. That was mag Zebra Zebra, I guess. Started out just like we had it planned. Took two each in 1 second and a half, and then a fourth, and then an eighth. The total count on this camera is going to be 50 instead of 60.
|116:54:05|CC|Back at 150.
|116:54:05|CMP|And then the rest of them - -
|116:54:05|CC|Yes.
|116:54:05|CMP|- - And then the rest of them are l60 - 150 throughout, except the last 2 foot and a half.
|116:54:05|CC|Okay.
|116:54:05|CC|I'll get a confirmation on some, Ron, but I think when we get on to Reiner Gamma on that pass of target 15 Delta, we're not going to have enough film left to run out over Riccioli and that area, which is already taken. That's why we hate to take these now, because when - when we come up there in the next pass, you're not going to have enough film.
||||Tape 78B/4|Page 739
|116:54:05|CMP|Oh, I see. Okay.
|116:54:05|CMP|Let's see. While I got the camera out, I can look ahead, I guess, and see what - what mag to put in there.
|116:54:05|CMP|WW, I guess, huh?
|116:54:05|CC|Yes, that's affirm. WW on the lunar ...
|116:54:05|CMP|Okay. Give you that.
|116:54:05|CC|Ron, comm is getting pretty bad down here with us, we're going to lose you in about 4 minutes, maybe 5, completely. And we'll pick you back up at - 120:28 thereabouts, 120:28.
|116:54:05|CMP|120:28. Okay. We'll see you there.
|116:54:05|CC|Roger.
|117:01:52|CC|Ron, you're about ready to go over the hill. You're looking really good.
|117:01:52|CMP|Okay, Robert. Thank you much. See you in about 45 minutes then, I guess.
|117:01:52|CC|That's affirmative.
|117:01:52||BEGIN LUNAR REV 17
|117:50:05|CC|Hello, Ron. How's it going up there?
|117:50:05|CMP|Hey, pretty good, Robert. The last photo pass was a - a good one.
|117:50:05|CMP|Just about half an Earth now.
|117:50:05|CC|Roger.
|117:53:01|CMP|Houston, America. The mag Lima Lima is on frame number 54 now.
|117:53:01|CC|Roger, Ron. We copy. Lima Lima on 5^-
||||Tape 78B/5|Page 740
|117:53:01|CMP|And mag - and mag Quebec, Quebec is starting on frame 53.
|117:53:01|CC|Roger. We copy.
|118:02:16|CMP|Houston, America. I got to unplug you for a little bit. I'm so tangled up in my hoses here, I'm getting strangled to death.
|118:02:16|CC|Okay. No problem, Ron. We'll just sit. Give us a call when you're back on the air. Okay?
|118:08:01|CMP|Houston, do you need OMNI Bravo yet? Will you give me a call when you want it?
|118:08:01|CC|Roger, Ron. We'll give you a call. You can go on to Bravo now, Ron.
|118:08:01|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. Do you have it? Okeydoke.
||||Tape 79B/1|Page 778
|118:07:43|CC|Roger.
|118:07:43|CMP|But I'm sure it isn't that way.
|118:07:43|CC|Yes, we've got - -
|118:07:43|CC|Ron, if you're right there, we'd like you to take the Hg tank 2 FANs to OFF, please.
|118:09:42|CMP|Okay. Hg tank 2 FANs to OFF.
|118:09:42|CMP|You know, from the pictures of Maraldi Gamma, looked to me like it might have been some sort of a - a - well, maybe even a volcanic dome or some kind. Now when you look at it up there now and compare it with the rest of the surrounding material, it looks just like any other - any of the other sculptured hills. They have small domical structures on it, the same type of material that carries on through south of Maraldi. And it looks like maybe some kind of a mare fill has come in and filled up, Maraldi itself. You can see flow lines, it looks like, going down into Maraldi from Tranquillitatis. Now - The impact on the craters that are inside Maraldi, they're smaller-type craters and they have a - they have a definite bluish tinge to the halo that comes out as opposed to the bright - opposed to the bright craters or white-type thing and those are -have more of a bl - a darkish bluish tin - tinge to them. And - -
|118:09:42|CC|Thank you, Ron.
|118:09:42|CMP|- - oddly enough, that's the same type of - That's the same type of bluish tinge that I see right in the landing site right now. In the Pentagon complex, MOCR shows up that - that same type of a bluish tinge to it.
||||Tape 79B/2|Page 779
|118:09:42|CC|Roger. Did you have any luck locating the LM area in the landing site this time?
|118:09:42|CMP|Yes, I don't even see the bright spot there anymore. I know - I know where to look for it and I don't even see it.
|118:09:42|CC|Roger. Understand.
|118:12:30|CMP|Well, South Massif just went into a hole, too, so -
|118:12:30|CC|Roger. Our best estimate of their location down here. Ron is - 83 - Delta Mike 83. Delta Mike 83.
|118:12:30|CMP|Delta Mike 83, huh?
|118:12:30|CC|Yes, and that's - that's seen on the southeast sheet - the FE sheet with the landing site and the first EVA on it. The one, the 25,000 grid map on the - one of those you had put in at the last minute there.
|118:12:30|CMP|Okay,
|118:12:30|CC|And I assume you're set up for these pictures coming up at 121, right?
|118:12:30|CMP|Yes. It's funny, I can see Bessel, but I'll be durn if I can see a Copernican ray going across it - I mean a Tycho ray going - Copernican ray, I guess.
|118:12:30|CC|I think you were right the first time, weren't you?
|118:12:30|CMP|Yes, it's a lycho ray.
|118:12:30|CC|Ron, I'm sorry we missed this last time. If you'll give me a hack when you start on the oarth-shine photos on P17s the Copernicus one, I'll -I'll time your 30 seconds for you down here ;md save you looking at the clock. And - -
|118:12:30|CMP|Oh, okay. Hey, that's a good idea.
||||Tape 79B/3|Page 780
|118:12:30|CC|I guess even though the start time we passed and everything is the time, Farouk wanted to remind you that when you pass Eratosthenes is a good time to be looking into the heart of Copernicus, there. If you'll remember from the map, there.
|118:12:30|CMP|Okay. Hey, that's a good idea; thank you.
|118:16:28|CC|Were you able to see the Sul- Sulpicius Gallus Ridge there, Ron?
|118:16:28|CMP|Yes, man oh man. That thing really sticks up there.
|118:16:28|CMP|I'm trying to estimate the height of it with respect to one of those craters down there, but -I - I still can't get over the - the difference in the color and the annulus around Serenitatis. And that thing is really apparent.
|118:16:28|CC|Roger.
|118:16:28|CMP|And it looks like - the color- - the color distinction - stops right at this ridge here, just as we're going into the sunset right now.
|118:16:28|CC|Roger.
|118:16:28|CMP|I'm trying to determine a - a flow with respect to those ridges, if there is such a thing.
|118:16:28|CMP|I'll have to look at it again when I come around the next time. Okay, Ki - Kilo's got 69 frames.
|118:16:28|CC|Roger.
|118:21:48|CC|Okay, Ron. You're about 2 minutes from T-start time, but again bias your T-start time with respect to the crater Eratosthenes.
|118:21:48|CMP|Okay. Why don't you just kind of give me a - ... gouge when I should be at Eratosthenes (chuckle).
|118:21:48|CC|Okay. I'll give a call and, of course, your first frame is - -
||||Tape 79B/4|Page 781
|118:21:48|CMP|I think I'll - -
|118:21:48|CC|- - first frame is f/1.2 for 1 second and you'll take two frames.
|118:21:48|CMP|Okay.
|118:23:27|CC|Okay, Ron. You're about 30 seconds from T-start time.
|118:23:45|CMP|Okay. I think I got her.
|118:23:45|CC|Okay, just give me a call when you start. You're about 10 seconds out, now.
|118:23:45|CMP|Okay. Stand by 3, 2, 1 -
|118:23:59|CMP|MARK it.
|118:23:59|CMP|Okay; switch to a half.
|118:23:59|CC|Okay, coming up on 30 seconds.
|118:24:27|CC|MARK it.
|118:24:27|CMP|Okay, got it. The fourth.
|118:24:27|CC|Okay, coming up on another 30 second, here -
|118:24:57|CC|MARK it.
|118:24:57|CMP|Okay. Okay, I'm down to 1/15- I'm just now passing it, Bob. So there's a one on 1/15.
|118:24:57|CC|Okay, you're one ahead on the figure. You should be at 1/8 - -
|118:24:57|CMP|Two on the 15 - -
|118:24:57|CC|- - right now.
|118:24:57|CMP|- - I'll start my time from there. Yes, I've -I've already passed it so I had to get them quick (chuckle).
|118:24:57|CC|Okay, there you are 1/8 there.
||||Tape 79B/5|Page 782
|118:24:57|CMP|Okay, tell me when to - Okay.
|118:24:57|CMP|Okay. The rest of them 1/8?
|118:24:57|CC|No, at l/l6 or 1/15-
|118:24:57|CMP|Okay. Give me a time hack every 30 seconds.
|118:24:57|CC|Well - okay.
|118:24:57|CMP|Or whenever, tell me to switch windows.
|118:26:00|CC|HACK it.
|118:26:00|CC|Coming up on 30 seconds.
|118:26:30|CC|MARK it.
|118:26:30|CC|Coming up on another mark, Ron.
|118:27:00|CC|HACK it.
|118:27:00|CMP|Okay.
|118:27:00|CC|Just a reminder, the end of this line goes up to Encke and .Kepler; you've probably reviewed that.
|118:27:00|CMP|Okay.
|118:27:00|CC|Coming up on another mark.
|118:27:30|CC|HACK.
|118:27:30|CC|Coming up on our other mark.
|118:27:58|CC|MARK it.
|118:27:58|CC|Okay, Ron.
|118:28:30|CC|MARK it.
|118:28:30|CMP|Pictures in here. Okay.
|118:28:30|CC|Okay, Ron. You'll be coming up on another mark here.
||||Tape 79B/6|Page 783
|118:28:57|CC|MARK it.
|118:28:57|CMP|Got it.
|118:28:57|CC|Okay, according to my calculations you've got two more sets of two frames each to take. You've taken 20 and you've got four more to go, I believe.
|118:28:57|CMP|Okay, I want to get some for Reiner Gamma right?
|118:28:57|CC|Roger. As soon as you do that, you just switch windows to the north side and - Reiner Gamma -You got two more to go. Here we go. Coming up on another 30 seconds.
|118:28:57|CMP|Okay.
|118:29:29|CC|MARK it. You probably should be able to see Encke out there now. That's your last target there.
|118:29:29|CMP|Okay. Switch over to window 3, then.
|118:29:29|CC|Okay. Did you take that last one on Encke or you got two more to go on Encke there?
|118:29:29|CMP|... I've got - I've only got 19 frames left so -
|118:29:29|CC|Okay. That's the last ... it marked there.
|118:29:29|CMP|Same thing on the Eratosthenes? Okay.
|118:29:29|CC|Okay, Ron. On these Reiner Gamma pictures, you don't have to wait 30 seconds. You just shoot the frames as soon as you get it in view there. Shoot two frames at 1 second, two at 1/2, two at 1/4, and two at 1/8.
|118:29:29|CMP|Okay. Would you - would you believe that's what I did on Eratosthenes and also on Copernicus?
|118:29:29|CC|Roger. That's what you're supposed to do on Copernicus so you remembered better than me on that one. It wasn't 30 seconds - -
|118:29:29|CMP|(Laughter)
||||Tape 79B/7|Page 784
|118:29:29|CC|- - until after Copernicus.
|118:29:29|CMP|Yes. Well, I made a mistake too. I thought Eratosthenes was Copernicus. But anyhow we got -we got a series on Eratosthenes and also a series on Copernicus. So we're in good shape.
|118:29:29|CC|Okay. You should be seeing Gamma about now, shouldn't you?
|118:29:29|CMP|Yes, but I don't see it yet.
|118:29:29|CC|Okay.
|118:29:29|CC|Ron, you can just run this mag all the way out to frame 40. After you finish on Gamma, you just continue on out that line up towards Riccioli; and - and then run out to frame 40 and stow it.
|118:32:19|CMP|Okay; will do.
|118:36:54|CMP|Okay. Got her in sight now.
|118:46:48|CC|Okay, Ron. Did you get that mag finished up?
|118:46:48|CMP|Okay. All but one picture and I was going to try to take one of Orientale. I've saved one there just for right on the edge.
|118:46:48|CC|Okay.
|118:46:48|CMP|So I'm just kind of looking out the window now. Why, do you have some Flight Plan stuff?
|118:46:48|CC|I've only got one minor Flight Plan and that1s all so any time you're ready, don't - you know, don't tear yourself away from the window as long as you can see anything here.
|118:46:48|CMP|Okay.
|118:46:48|CC|We would like you to select OMNI Alfa.
|118:47:30|CMP|OMNI Alfa.
||||Tape 79B/8|Page 785
|118:47:30|CC|And, if you're looking at anything and you can see anything interesting, we wouldn't mind hearing about it.
|118:47:30|CMP|Okay.
|118:47:30|CMP|The big difference right in here, of course, is the - the ejecta and the radial furrows and ridges and what have you from Orientale - there isn't -doesn't seem to be that type of a pattern at all on the back side.
|118:47:30|CC|Ro ger. Underst and.
|118:50:27|CC|Can you still see - see things in earthshine or is it getting pretty black down there?
|118:50:27|CMP|Actually, you know. You can still see it. That's what kind of amazes me. It's almost like - you know, sunrise and sunset.
|118:50:27|CC|Roger.
|118:50:27|CMP|Pretty soon, the shadows get longer and longer.
|118:50:27|CC|I tell you, we got the television screen here of the - -
|118:51:07|CMP|Okay; that's my last picture off.
|118:51:07|CC|Roger. You're going to have a couple of dirty companions when they come back up, I'll tell you.
|118:51:07|CMP|(Laughter) What are they doing? Getting all dirty?
|118:51:07|CC|Well, I think they've just fallen a couple of times, and they're black all over.
|118:51:07|CMP|Yes, it looked like a dark area down there.
|118:51:07|CC|Well, they sure are dirty. Okay, Ron, I - in the Flight Plan at 133:12, way on ahead, you just might mark this down somewhere. It's a real simple -"MAPPING CAMERA/LASER ALTIMETER COVER, OPEN," and "MAPPING CAMERA, EXTEND," you'll just delete those since they're already there.
||||Tape 79B/9|Page 786
|118:51:07|CMP|Okay. Let's see - where was that now, about 131, Bob?
|118:51:07|CC|133:12. It's in the other volume, in the next volume of the Flight Plan.
|118:51:07|CMP|Oh, (chuckle) I'll just write it down, I don't have that volume out.
|118:51:07|CC|Yes, just mapping - it's delete the "MAPPING CAMERA/LASER ALTIMETER, OPEN," and ''MAPPING CAMERA - EXTEND." Just delete those two functions. You remember it's already out and the cover is staying open because it's out.
|118:51:07|CMP|Oh, okay. And that's about 131, huh?
|118:51:07|CC|133:12, 133:12.
|118:51:07|CMP|Okay. 133 plus 12.
|118:51:07|CC|And, Ron. We made a trip around the room here and the CSM systems are all GO. They all look good and the lunar sounder is looking good also.
|118:51:07|CMP|Hey. Real fine. I guess I'll grab a bite to eat then here pretty quick.
|118:51:07|CC|Yes, do that, will you? Sorry you missed that other one.
|118:51:07|CMP|(Laughter) Oh, I filled in, every once in a while so that's not too bad.
|118:51:07|CC|Good enough.
|118:51:07|CC|And just a reminder, which is in the Flight Plan, DSE voice recorded at the back side will not be dumped - so -
|118:51:07|CMP|Oh, okay.
||||Tape 79B/10|Page 787
|118:51:07|CC|And, Ron, the reason why we' OFF, now is we're trying to drop some and we'll come up uration this next half.
|118:54:12|CMP|Oh, okay.

|119:49:22|CMP|Houston, America. ...
|119:49:22|CC|Go ahead, Ron.
|119:49:22|CMP|Okay. Had ny headset off here, and I wasn't paying much attention when AOS came.
|119:49:22|CC|Oh, I wasn't even talk - listening for you. I was talking to your wife.
|119:49:22|CMP|Oh, okay.
|119:49:22|CC|Did you get a decent meal?
|119:49:22|CMP|Well, it wasn't too bad.
|119:49:22|CC|Jan said - -
|119:49:22|CMP|Turkey and gravy.
|119:49:22|CC|Jan said she's - you're the last person she would ever think would miss a meal up there.
|119:49:22|CMP|(Laughter) That's probably true, really.
|119:59:08|CMP|Thank heavens.
|120:00:05|CC|Ron, are you out - glued to a window, or are you just eating now?
|120:00:05|CMP|I'm really just eating.
|120:00:05|CC|Roger. Just thought I'd update here before you get into your presleep checklist ... Have a little bit of news from the day, but today's - -
|120:00:05|CMP|Oh, okay.
||||Tape 80B/2|Page 838
|120:00:05|CC|- - sure not much news today. It's a good thing you guys made the landing today, because there wouldn't be any news in the paper tomorrow if it wasn't for you all.
|120:00:05|CMP|(Laughter)
|120:00:05|CC|Let's see. Japanese Prime Minister Tanaka's Liberal Democrats lost 26 seats, but he still has a firm hold on the Diet, and Tanaka still has a firm majority. And Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho's secret Paris peace talks have bogged down some more, and they think they are bogged down under some academic situations. And - news out of Kansas City isn't too good, but President Truman is - feeling some irregular heartbeats and has reduced the optimism for his recovery.
|120:00:05|CMP|Not too good.
|120:00:05|CC|This last one has got to be the height of trivia. I'm just going to read it to you exactly the way it is. It's from Saigon. Question? What does an Air Force enlisted man do when he meets a naked general? He salutes. An order issued by Major Paul M. Boseman at Tan Son Nhut Air Base makes the requirement clear. Salute when you recognize an officer, even though you both are nude. An Air Force spokesman said he didn't know under what circumstances officers and enlisted personnel might encounter - encounter each, other in the nude. End of - news for tonight.
|120:00:05|CMP|(Laughter) News - a little trivia, isn't it?
|120:00:05|CC|Yes, indeed.
|120:00:05|CC|Everybody from the homefront sending their love. They are having a little trouble hacking out the -the comm, since we're all on a squawk box together. So they are going to try to get it set up so just the CSM loop will go into your house tomorrow night. Tonight we had all of it, and it was kind of a jumble for them.
||||Tape 80B/3|Page 839
|120:00:05|CMP|(Laughter) I imagine so, wouldn't it? They can't turn one down - or something, huh?
|120:00:05|CC|That's right. Well, they are going to - they are going to try and get it worked on for tomorrow so that only the CSM loop will go in there. They just had to finally give up on it and go watch the - the surface work on television because over where the loop was, it was just too much.
|120:00:05|CMP|Yes, I bet.
|120:00:05|CC|When you get into the presleep checklist, you. can delete the stir cryos, which is in the checklist. We won't stir the cryos, and then as you get further downstream closer to LOS here - the sleep period, we'll have you turn the TANK 2 FANS to the ON position. I'll give you a reminder on that.
|120:00:05|CMP|Okay.
|120:05:06|CMP|Okay, Houston-, America. BAT C is about 36.8 or 9È something like that (cough).
|120:05:06|CC|Say again. Say again - -
|120:05:16|CMP|PYR0 A is 37.
|120:05:16|CC|Okay.
|120:05:18|CMP|PYR0 - okay. PYR0 A is 37; PYR0 B is 37- BAT C is oh - 36.9- Okay. I think you want the quads now, ...?
|120:05:18|CC|Roger.
|120:05:44|CMP|Okay. Alfa is 82. Bravo - a 78. Charlie is 80. Delta is - about 83.
|120:05:44|CC|Roger. We got those, and that matches pretty close with, what we got right in front of us on those quads. You can go ahead and take the tanks 2 FANS to ON at this time - -
||||Tape 80B/4|Page 840
|120:05:44|CMP|Okay.
|120:06:22|CMP|Okay. Tank 2 FANS are going ON. H2, that is.
|120:06:22|CC|Roger.
|120:07:35|CC|And, Ron, we'd like OMNI Bravo.
|120:07:44|CMP|Okay. You have OMNI Bravo.
|120:18:13|CC|Ron, you have leas than a minute to LUNAR SOUNDER, OPERATE and STANDBY.
|120:18:13|CMP|Oh, okay. Thank you. 2:59, huh?
|120:18:13|CC|Roger. 122:59-
|120:18:13|CC|How about giving me a mark on it so I can see what the actual delay is here in the room? If you're going to do it right at 59, give me a mark, will you please?
|120:18:13|CMP|Okay.
|120:18:13|CMP|55 - 56 - 57 - 58 - 59 -
|120:19:03|CMP|MARK it.
|120:19:03|CC|Answer: 3 seconds away, big as life.
|120:19:03|CMP|(Laughter) Okay.
|120:19:03|CC|You may be far away, but you're as close as your telephone.
|120:19:03|CMP|(Laughter) That's right.
|120:20:13|CC|You can go RECORDER, OFF, now, Ron.
|120:20:21|CMP|Okay. RECORDER - is OFF.
|120:20:21|CC|And if you will, you can pick up on the top of the next page, 123- RADAR, OFF; DATA SYSTEM* OFF; et cetera. ... DATA SYSTEM, ON.
||||Tape 80B/5|Page 841
|120:20:21|CMP|Okay.
|120:21:24|CMP|Okay. RADAR is coming OFF, DATA SYSTEM is coming ON.
|120:21:32|CMP|HIGH GAIN ANTENNA is going to POWER.
|120:21:42|CMP|MANUAL, WIDE.
|120:21:50|CMP|74, 280.
|120:22:22|CMP|Okay. SM/AC POWER is coining ON.
|120:22:45|CMP|MAPPING CAMERA is STANDBY. Self test to heaters.
|120:22:56|CMP|UV is ON. IR is ON.
|120:23:05|CMP|(Cough) UV COVER is going OPEN. Barber pole and a gray.
|120:23:11|CMP|IR is OPEN. Barber pole and a gray.
|120:23:11|CC|Roger, Ron. Just on those HIGH GAIN ANTENNAS, on your knob settings, we'd like you to tweak those as close to those settings as you can possibly get it, for good comm during the night.
|120:23:11|CMP|Okay. You want - minus 74 and 280, huh?
|120:23:11|CC|That's affirmative; we just wanted to tweak them up as best we can.
|120:23:11|CC|I'll say it again. It's the one in the sleep checklist. You'll get to it at - you get to it down here at about - at about 23:10.
|120:23:11|CMP|Oh, okay.
|120:23:11|CC|Sounds like some good music in the background there.
|120:23:11|CMP|Oh, not too bad really.
|120:25:30|CC|Ron, if you're finished there, we would like the -ACCEPT. We got to get on monitor load, and we got a state vector for you tonight.
||||Tape 80B/6|Page 842
|120:25:42|CMP|Okay. You have ACCEPT.
|120:25:42|CC|Roger.
|120:25:42|CC|FDO showed me where those - they're plotting on Doppler what those mascons are doing to you. They really - really have effect.
|120:25:42|CMP|Oh, they are, huh?
|120:25:42|CC|Yes, you can really see when you are going right over Imbrium and - Serenitatis.
|120:25:42|CMP|(Laughter)
|120:25:42|CC|And Just prior to getting into the rest - sleep, we can take BATTERY B off the charge; terminate the charge.
|120:26:36|CMP|Okay.
|120:27:35|CMP|Okay. I checked out the tone booster, and it's hooked up.
|120:27:35|CC|Good show.
|120:30:34|CMP|Well, I guess I'd better chlorinate the old water.
|120:35:20|CC|Okay, Ron. You can go to BLOCK. The computer is yours.
|120:35:20|CMP|Okay. Will do shortly.
|120:35:20|CC|Okay. You want me to remind you again while you're - after you're chlorinated here?
|120:35:20|CMP|No, I'll get it out.
|120:35:20|CC|Okay.
|120:35:20|CC|The ~ the sur - the surface boys are on the way back to the LM, completed their EVA, and they're getting - they're driving back to LM right now.
|120:35:20|CMP|Hey, good.
||||Tape 80B/7|Page 843
|120:35:20|CMP|They got out and did a little riding around on the Rover too, huh?
|120:35:20|CC|That's right. It - they - they - -
|120:35:20|CMP|After the ALSEP wsts all deployed?
|120:35:20|CC|Yes. The ALSEP's deployed. They had to cut their time at Station 1 a little bit. They got to curtail the EVA slightly short of 7 hours due to the high oxygen usage during the - deploying the ALSEP. Only 15 minutes early, so it's no big deal.
|120:35:20|CMP|Oh., I see. Well, that's not bad.
|120:35:20|CC|No, they1 re - Gene was working pretty hard putting tkat drill in the ground, and it was some pretty difficult work. And they - they each fell a couple of times, so they were really pretty busy.
|120:35:20|CMP|(Laughter)
|120:39:00|CMP|Are we going to leave tank 3-1 mean, tank 2, H_ FAN, ON, all the time?
|120:39:05|CC|Roger. H2 tank 2 FAN, ON, for all night.
|120:39:05|CMP|Okay.
|120:39:32|CC|Only thing we've got, Ron, is it looks like you've got to get the BAT B off the CHARGE and then -configure the comm, and you are already to bed down.
|120:39:32|CMP|Okay.
|120:39:59|CMP|Okay. BATTERY B relay's breakers IN. Charger's OFF.
|120:39:59|CMP|Okay. I've got to clean the old suit circuit return screen yet.
|120:39:59|CMP|Plus X forward here so - plus 25 and 195* No, wait a minute. Minus 10 and plus 25.
||||Tape 80B/8|Page 844
|120:39:59|CC|Roger. That - that's affirmative. Minus 10, plus 25. And as tight as you can get it to those numbers, Ron.
|120:39:59|CMP|Well, I'll tell you what. I believe the dials more than I believe the set knobs, so - Was that the AOS there? No. Not quite.
|120:42:37|CC|Ron, we just been debating here; you need to be sure to do the knobs at the minus 10 and plus 25*
|120:42:37|CMP|Okay. I'll put the knobs there.
|120:44:27|CC|Ron, everything is looking great down here. It was a really great day, really busy. We're sorry about that eat period; and it' s been real - lot of - lot of things accomplished.
|120:44:27|CMP|(Laughter) It was a good day. Don't worry about that eating. No problem there.
|120:44:27|CC|And the bird looks great, and We'll see you when we wake you up. You can sign off any time.
|120:44:27|CMP|Okay.

|120:47:57|CC|Ron, just a reminder on the S-BAND NORMAL, VOICE, OFF, vtien you're ready to - back out.
|120:47:57|CMP|Okay. Let me throw a little ... solution down in the water here for about 10 minutes, I think.
|120:47:57|CC|Roger.
|120:47:57|CMP|It takes a little longer to do all this stuff by yourself (laughter).
||||Tape 80B/9|Page 845
|120:47:57|CC|It sure does.
|120:53:24|CC|Okay, Ron. We're going to drop the up-link here in 1 minute, so see you tomorrow.
|120:53:24|CMP|Okay. Thank you all. We'll see you in the morning.
|120:53:24|CC|That's all right. You - you can call us, but we - -

|134:18:15|CMP|Okay. Just a second.
|134:18:15|CMP|Okay. Go.
|134:21:59|CC|Okay. At 137:33, the solar corona photo pad is T-start: 137=33:48. Over.
|134:21:59|CMP|Okay. Solar corona pad, 137:33:48.
|134:21:59|CC|Roger. The next one's over at 139:20.
|134:21:59|CMP|Okay ¥ Go.
|134:21:59|CC|Okay. The old one, delete "MAPPING CAMERA/LASER ALTIMETER COVER, OPEN." And at 139:21, delete "MAPPING CAMERA, EXTEND," since they're already there.
|134:21:59|CMP|Okay. Got them.
|134:22:54|CC|Okay, Ron. At 139:21, where it says, "UV COVER, OPEN," move that down to 139:23. Make the following note. "Delay opening 2 minutes to check operating current with cover closed." We'll be checking that and giving you a cue on that.
|134:22:54|CMP|Oh, okay.
||||Tape 89B/4|Page 968
|134:22:54|CC|And there's nothing - no problems expected there, Ron, We're just getting some extra data that OSO wants.
|134:22:54|CMP|Okay. Good deal.
|134:23:35|CC|Okay. The next one is at l4l:50.
|134:23:35|CMP|l4l -
|134:23:35|CC|141:50.
|134:23:35|CMP|l4l:50; okay.
|134:23:35|CC|Okay. We got - -
|134:23:35|CMP|Okay, I got It.
|134:23:35|CC|We've got a little - seeing some funnies on the V/H OVERRIDE, so after PAN CAMERA, STANDBY, STEREO, and POWER, we want to add the following: V/H OVERRIDE, HIGH ALTITUDE - HIGH ALT.
|134:23:35|CMP|Okay, V/H OVERRIDE to HIGH ALTITUDE.
|134:23:35|CC|Okay, make - -
|134:23:35|CMP|After you get the PAN CAMERA POWER, ON.
|134:23:35|CC|Pardon me, Ron. I missed that.
|134:23:35|CMP|That's right. That's - after you get the PAN CAMERA POWER, ON, V/H to HIGH ALTITUDE.
|134:24:40|CC|Roger. Okay, Ron, the next two are just a couple of info notes for you. I don't know where you want to write this one, but FAO would like to remind you that you don't have any margin on mag Lima Lima anymore; you used up all your margin on that mag. Everything else is needed for planned operation.
|134:24:40|CMP|Uh-huh! Okay.
|134:25:10|CC|And, the last one just - -
||||Tape 89B/5|Page 969
|134:25:10|CMP|Discontinue spares on Lima Lima.
|134:25:10|CC|Roger. Just use Lima Lima as scheduled, but don't -don't use any spare shots on it. And the last one is just a sum up here, Ron.
|134:25:10|CMP|Okay.
|134:25:10|CC|You obviously are aware of it, but you have not missed any mapping camera, pan- camera, or lunar sounder operations to date. And we're all on schedule and right on the Flight Plan - outstanding Flight Plan.
|134:25:10|CMP|Yes. You bet it's an outstanding Flight Plan. That's great!
|134:25:10|CC|Yes, Ron. I think you had a really outstanding Flight Plan to be flying at this time of the year, because the weather in Houston is so miserable that you can't believe it.
|134:25:10|CMP|(Laughter) Oh, boy. That's what everybody keeps saying.
|134:25:57|CC|Roger. I just drove in, and it's kind of a sleety rain. It feels like it might snow at any moment, although It's really not that cold. The ceiling is probably down about 6 - 700 feet. It is really rotten out there.
|134:25:57|CMP|(Laughter) Yes, we did - we did pick a good time to make the flight then.
|134:25:57|CC|That's affirmative. It's been this way since you left.
|134:25:57|CMP|(Laughter)
|134:25:57|CC|You guys - you realize, of course, that you're going to get --
|134:25:57|CMP|Well, we want everybody to get ... - -
|134:25:57|CC|- - blamed for that, because with two people on the Moon, that's what happens.
||||Tape 89B/6|Page 970
|134:25:57|CMP|(Laughter) Yes, right.
|134:25:57|CC|Okay. You can get back to work then, if you want.
|134:25:57|CMP|Okay.
|134:26:54|CMP|See if I can get my solar - solar corona squared away here.
|134:26:54|CC|Okay.
|134:27:35|CMP|Okay. Solar corona is mag QQ, and we're on frame 69*
|134:27:35|CC|Okay. Mag QQ, 69.
|134:31:56|CMP|And, Houston; America. Let's see. You're going to send me over the hill in high bit rate this time for sure, are you? As usual (chuckle).
|134:31:56|CC|Stand by on that, Ron. Let me check in the go on that.
|134:31:56|CMP|Looks like it.
|134:31:56|CC|That's affirmative, Ron. You'll be going over the hill in high bit rate.
|134:36:14|CMP|And, Houston; America. Just so I won't get confused there, I put two protect frames at the start of this.
|134:36:14|CC|Roger. That's affirm. We got that.
|134:36:14|CMP|I just wanted to try out that - mode contrable [sic] -control cable with the PCM stuff, you know?
|134:36:14|CC|Roger. Understand.
|134:44:42|CC|Ron, we're coming up on 5 minutes to LOS and just want to update you. We went around the room, and the spacecraft is looking great. We just have one reminder and that's at the end of the solar corona period. Please use only one protect frame - one protect frame per the Flight Plan or per the checklist. And the other thing is - the lunar sounder -the little check you did at the beginning of this pass - the recorder is pulling film as normal. The glitch we saw was a telemetry grit - glitch and the lunar sounder is looking great.
||||Tape 89B/7|Page 971
|134:45:19|CMP|Hey, outstanding! That's good to hear. Sounds like we're getting kind of low on VHBW film though is what you're saying, huh?
|134:45:19|CC|On that particular magazine; yes, Ron. That's the problem, I think. Looking at the total thing is more - is which magazine has got what on it.
|134:45:19|CMP|Oh, okay.
|134:45:52|CC|And we'll see you at 01:38:15 when you'll be just about eating. So give us a call if you want anything. We'll be listening.
|134:45:52|CMP|Okay. I'll be on the loop. Oh - Hey, one thing. Can you check on mag - what do I have on the Nikon now, XX, I guess? It seems to me like - we just need that for another zodiacal light thing.
|134:45:52|CC|Okay. We got FAO working on that.
|134:45:52|CMP|... know is, in other words, are there two or three frames available? Do we have two or three frames available on that one?
|134:45:52|CC|Okay. Let me check on it, Ron?
|134:45:52|CMP|Okay.
|134:46:44|CMP|I want to take a red and a blue picture of the landing site sometime.
|134:46:44|CC|It's going to take a little bit of chasing on that, Ron. We may not have the word before you go LOS, but we'll have it definitely when you come up AOS.
|134:46:44|CMP|Oh, okay. Yes, don't - No - no problem. I won't use it until we get to the landing site anyhow.
|134:47:24|CC|Okay, Ron. There are 18 spares on X-ray X-ray that you could use.
|134:47:31|CMP|Oh, okay . Good.

|135:36:33|CMP|Houston, America.
|135:36:33|CC|Hello, America. How are you doing?
|135:36:33|CMP|Well, I think I've got it back under control again.
|135:36:33|CC|What happened - any problems?
|135:36:33|CMP|Let's see. Let me go back to my - Well, I almost got into gimbal lock (laughter).
|135:36:33|CC|Okay. You almost got into gimbal lock. Go ahead - -
|135:36:33|CMP|Just at the last step of the - last step of the solar corona thing which says go back to CMC AUTO - which wouldn't have been too bad, except as soon as you get a waste water dump, it really torques it around, I guess. And, somewhere - you ought to be able to check it back on the tape -at about 137:50 - between 50 and probably - no, between 55 and 58, somewhere in there, I got the GIMBAL LOCK light and all those good deal things; and got her under control. Took her back. And we got back to SIM bay attitude at 137:59:20. In the meantime, while I was doing all that, looked like my waste water dropped down kind of low, too. How much are you reading down there?
|135:38:25|CC|Okay. Stand by on that, Ron.
|135:38:25|CC|We're reading 0.16 percent and 0.9 pound - 1.6 percent and 0.9 pounds, Ron.
|135:38:25|CMP|I didn't quite make it to zero, did I?
|135:38:25|CC|Ron, that's affirm.
|135:38:25|CMP|Okay. Caught that in time, anyway.

|135:38:25|CC|Hey, Ron, just a question, here. Pick up where you were briefing us there. Did you go to CMC AUTO after the solar corona, or did you get the GIMBAL LOCK light prior to going to AUTO.
|135:40:04|CMP|(Laughter) I got it prior to going to AUTO. I forgot to go to AUTO after the solar corona thing.
|135:40:04|CC|Okay. We've got you.
|135:40:04|CMP|The full cell purge and the waste water dump. Yes.
|135:40:04|CMP|I saw it before it tumbled the platform, though.
|135:40:04|CC|Roger. We've got you, and the platform looks good then, too?
|135:40:04|CMP|Oh, yes. The platform's okay.
|135:40:04|CMP|And if Enco's [?] timing his bit rate forces there, high bit rate was - I mean going to low bit rate is about 137=42 - was pretty - -
|135:40:04|CC|Okay. We copy that.
|135:40:04|CMP|... this thing. Okay. And then going to high bit rate, I've got the high bit at 137:50:30. And I hit LOW BIT RATE again at 138:08; went to HIGH BIT RATE at 138:14.
|135:42:05|CC|Roger, Ron. We copy those times.
|135:42:05|CC|Sounds like you might have got your heartbeat going good for your eat period. Is that right, Ron?
|135:43:17|CMP|(Laughter) Yes, might have. I'm going to have some peanut butter now, if you guys don't care.
|135:43:17|CC|Roger. It's your eat period.
|135:43:17|CMP|(Laughter) Okay.
|135:43:17|CC|At least he didn't forget this one. Ron, we've got some data here for you.
||||Tape 90B/3|Page 982
|135:43:17|CMP|Yes, that's right, by gosh. I've even got one scheduled. Go ahead.
|135:43:17|CC|We've got some data here for you, for - if you're planning on taking those red and blue filtered exposures across the landing site - if you want this information.
|135:43:17|CMP|Oh, yes. Okay; go ahead.
|135:43:17|CC|Okay, Ron. Here is - here it is. It's a Nikan [sic] - NK - November Kilo 55; VH - VW; mag X-ray X-ray. Okay. With the red-blue filtered exposure you want it at F/ll, 1/125, one frame each filter; F/ll, 1/250; one frame each filter. With no filter, expose at F/ll, 1/1000. And if you want to use the polarizing filter, expose at F/ll, 1/500 of a second.
|135:45:25|CMP|Okay. Looks like we'll bracket it, there: F/ll, 1/125, one frame on each filter; and F/ll at 1/250, one frame on each filter; and without a filter, one -F/ll at 1/1000; and polarizing F/ll at 1/500.
|135:45:25|CC|Okay. Here's a note that I'm not sure I understand totally, but let me read it to you. "Observe targets through viewfinder and shoot as desired with polarizing filter in different positions. Mark exposure time with polarizing filter as data analysis requires the incidence angle."
|135:45:25|CMP|Okay. So we need the GET time when we take the picture.
|135:45:25|CC|That's - that's affirm - with the polarizer.
|135:45:25|CMP|... Yes. Yes, with the polarizer. Right.
|135:45:25|CC|And there's another note here. Do not exceed 18 frames total for the above pictures. 18 frames total.
|135:45:25|CMP|Okay.
|135:45:25|CC|And your TCA - TCA is - for the landing site - is 138:39:11.
||||Tape 90B/4|Page 983
|135:45:25|CMP|Okay. TCA is 138:39:11.
|135:45:25|CC|And, Ron, if you'll just give us a MARK when you make the shot. That'll be close enough and we'll -we'll mark the time here on those polarizing ones. So we'll get the angle that way.
|135:47:22|CMP|Oh, okay.
|135:49:37|CMP|Lost the freaking camera.
|135:49:37|CC|Ron, we'd like ACCEPT on the computer. We have a new state vector for you. Your downtrack there got to be in excess of 30,000 feet, and this has nothing to do with your backside water dump just now - it's just accumulation of errors in the path.
|135:51:53|CMP|Oh, okay. You have ACCEPT.
|135:51:53|CC|Ron, it's your computer.
|135:51:53|CMP|Okay. Going to BLOCK.
|135:57:11|CC|Okay, Ron, anytime you want to reach up and go AUTO on the HIGH GAIN - your - your convenience.
|135:57:11|CMP|Okay. Stand by. Is it 1/500? Yes. Stand by.
|135:58:37|CMP|MARK it. And the polarizer all the way to the left. Stand by.
|135:58:45|CMP|MARK it. That's the polarizer all the way, counterclockwise.
|135:58:45|CC|Got you.
|135:58:45|CMP|Okay. That's eight pictures. Okay. Stand by. Okay. Wait a minute. I lost the landing site. Stand by. Okay. Stand by.
|135:59:34|CMP|MARK it. It's all the way to counterclockwise. Stand by.
|135:59:42|CMP|MARK it. And that's all the way clockwise.
||||Tape 90B/5|Page 984
|135:59:42|CC|Roger. We got them.
|135:59:42|CMP|Frame 23 and 24-1 mean - yes, 23 and 24; we're looking north along the ridges there. The other two polarizers - the two before that were looking at the landing site. Then I had three - three red ones at a 1/500 and 1/250 and a l/25th and the rest l6. And, the blue one's at the same thing.
|135:59:42|CMP|And we're setting on frame number 25 on mag XX -that's XX ...
|136:01:03|CC|Roger, Ron.
||||Tape 91B/1|Page 1005
|136:19:08|CMP|Oh, okay. Want me to configure the DSE, though, at 39:32 right?
|136:19:08|CC|That's affirmative.
|136:19:08|CMP|Okay.
|136:28:49|CMP|How's the crew of Challenger? Are they getting about ready to go out again?
|136:28:49|CC|They're a little bit delayed, Ron, but there's no problem. They just slept a little longer and -Yes, they're in their prep - pre-EVA prep.
|136:28:49|CMP|Yes .
|136:28:49|CC|And everything's going good.
|136:28:49|CMP|Bet they're going to find that Scarp is a pretty good hill.
|136:29:19|CC|Roger. We understand.
|136:29:19|CC|America, Houston. At your convenience, Ron - no hurry on this - we'd like you to service your ZPN sensors on each side there. We're getting some bad data on that now.
|136:29:19|CMP|'They're itching. (Laughter)
|136:29:19|CC|Roger.
|136:29:19|CMP|Yes, it's pretty dry.
|136:29:19|CC|Roger. The - Dr. Z. recommends you might find a new location for them - just move them around a little bit, and put some cream on the other ones.
|136:29:19|CMP|Okay.
||||Tape 91B/2|Page 1006
|136:29:19|CC|There's no hurry on that, Ron, I wouldn't interrupt what you're doing now to - for that - it's not critical.
|136:29:19|CMP|Okay, I understand, Bob. I'll - -
|136:29:19|CC|You sound like a tour - -
|136:29:19|CMP|I will as soon as I get a chance. Okay?
|136:29:19|CC|Roger. You sound like a tourist up there.
|136:29:19|CMP|(Laughter) That's right.
|136:29:19|CC|Going to need a Kodak store here shortly, I'm afraid.
|136:29:19|CMP|(Laughter)
|136:29:19|CC|Okay, Ron, you might want to look at your Flight Plan when you get a chance. We're coming up on a SIM bay reconfiguration here shortly.
|136:29:19|CMP|Ah-ha. Okay.
|136:29:19|CMP|56, 57, 58, 59 -
|136:35:02|CMP|MARK it. OFF.
|136:35:02|CC|Roger. We got it.
|136:35:02|CMP|... wherever that is.
|136:35:02|CMP|Okay. RECORDER is going OFF, not the HEATERS. RADAR is OFF. DATA SYSTEM is ON. Uh-oh. Should have the SM/AC POWER switch up - up there (laughter) at 230, as much as we use It.
|136:35:02|CC|Roger. I concur with that one. I thought it would only be in the simulation that it would get to you on that one.
|136:35:02|CDR|(Laughter) Yes. Okay. SM/AC POWER is ON. The old MAPPER's going to STANDBY. IR is going ON. SELF TEST is going to HEATERS. UV is going ON, Now, we're going to open IR and we're going to wait on UV.
||||Tape 91B/3|Page 1007
|136:37:19|CC|We concur with that, Ron.
|136:37:19|CMP|Okay.
|136:37:19|CC|We'll give you a cue on that UV COVER, OPEN, here.
|136:37:33|CMP|Okay, there's the IR. Barber pole. And a gray.
|136:37:33|CMP|Houston, America.
|136:37:33|CC|Go ahead, Ron.
|136:37:33|CMP|Okay. Are you going to try to ship the back-side DSE back in there for this next pass - on the Orbital science visuals and stuff?
|136:37:33|CC|Ron, we're calling for the DSE operation exactly as - as it is in the Flight Plan. Is that - do you concur with that?
|136:37:33|CMP|Oh, yes. I concur, but I mean - sure, that's -that's no problem there. But I mean getting it back to Houston before the end of the flight, you know.
|136:37:33|CC|Negative. That was not in the plans unless you want us to, Ron. We don't have any provision to - to - to record it and send it back here, until it comes back in the transcript form.
|136:37:33|CMP|Okay, no problem. I'll paraphrase what I say then, and when I get into AOS over there.
|136:37:33|CC|Okay. No sweat. And if you have something you really want us to listen to, we can bring up the loop to get It, but it takes a little effort, Ron. That's all.
|136:37:33|CMP|Okay. Yes. No, I - it's - let's don't do it, yet.
|136:37:33|CC|Ron, I just heard the voice quality has been real good. We've listened to it several different times, and it's been real good and we can bring it in without too much problem. Probably wouldn't be ready for the next rev, but we can get it In here without too much strain, if you want it brought in.
||||Tape 91B/4|Page 1008
|136:37:33|CMP|Okay. I think it might be worthwhile, especially on - on this particular one, where I'll be essentially talking all the way across, on this one.
|136:37:33|CC|Okay, we'll just plan on it, Ron.
|136:37:33|CMP|If it's not too much of a problem. Yes.
|136:40:32|CC|Okay, Ron. You can UV COVER, OPEN, anytime.
|136:40:32|CMP|... Okay. Okay.
|136:40:40|CMP|OFF, OPEN, barber pole. And it's gray.
|136:40:40|CC|Ron, we need to precondition our tanks again. We'd like tank 2 FANs to OFF, please.
|136:41:07|CMP|tank 2 FANs are OFF.
|136:41:07|CC|Roger.
|136:41:07|CC|And, Ron, just a reminder, ve will bring in that voice from the - the rev 27 backside pass.
|136:41:07|CMP|Oh, okay, good. Thank you. Tell the lunar sounder guys I'm sorry if I pointed their antenna in the wrong direction there, for a short period of time.
|136:41:07|CC|No problem. Just one question, Ron, that is the Hasselblad we're hearing every once in a while, isn't it?
|136:41:07|CMP|There's what?
|136:41:07|CC|Is that your camera running? Every once in a while?
|136:41:07|CMP|No, not now.
||||Tape 91B/5|Page 1009
|136:41:07|CC|How about during this eat period - on this pass, were you running the camera quite a bit?
|136:41:07|CMP|Wo. The only thing was - was the Nikon.
|136:41:07|CC|Okay, understand. We keep hearing something that sure sounds like the camera is chugging - -
|136:41:07|CMP|The - might have been picking up the tape re -no, it might have been the tape recorder. Might have been me, trying to clear my ears, you know?
|136:41:07|CC|No, I don't think so.
|136:45:29|CC|Ron, we're a few minutes from LOS. And you're looking real good.
|136:45:29|CMP|Okay, Robert. Thank you much. We'll see you on the other side.
|136:45:29|CC|Okeydoke. And I'll try and get through to the -the homefront here, maybe for this next pass. And you are going to be pretty busy, but I'll give you a little update.
|136:45:49|CMP|Okay.
|136:45:49||BEGIN LUNAR REV 27
|137:33:16|CMP|... it as well as the - some of the more Eratosthenian craters around Saenger. Looks to me like you can still have a little bit of a hint - at least of the layering, or a broken-up different-colored material at the top of all these craters.
|137:33:16|CMP|And supposed to stop and rewind the DSE. Forgot to do that.
|137:33:16|CC|Roger, Ron. We'll take care of the DSE.
|137:33:16|CMP|Okay. Okay, I'll let you do it.
||||Tape 91B/6|Page 1010
|137:33:16|CC|Roger, Ron.
|137:33:16|CMP|Okay.
|137:33:16|CMP|Okay. I took three, or four, pictures on mag 00 up to frame 104 kind of looking north across the Arabia.
|137:33:16|CC|Roger, Ron. We copy.
|137:33:16|CC|Ron. Just some words for you. We placed - -
|137:33:16|CMP|Okay, kind of a - Okay, go ahead.
|137:33:16|CC|No, go ahead - go ahead with yours. We don't want to interrupt.
|137:33:16|CMP|I was just going to say that on the crater Aitken, on the other side, is probably - there are no -no - rays - visible rays that I can see at the low Sun angle, anyhow, coming across there. There's definitely a mare floor in there. It's a dark albedo-type - flat floor with swirls in it; no definite expression of swirls. One thing that's quite apparent, you have a flow scarp in the northeast corner of it coming out of - oh, a little cloverleaf-type of an area there. I'm going to have to look the next pass over it to see if, on account of the south domical structure that's in there, it's breached. And I can't tell if the flow of material is flowing to the east out of that domical structure or if the flow is flowing into the domical structure. I ought to take a better look at that the next time - the next time around.
|137:37:11|CC|Roger. We got you. See any lava marks on the crater rims, there?
|137:37:11|CMP|Well, that's - that's the - the lava mark is what I'd call - is almost a lava scarp - in - up in the northeast corner. There are some lava marks along the central peak. They aren't nearly as apparent as the one up in the northeast corner. The northeast corner is definitely a flow front -a lava flow front, that has flown up the - the old interior wall of the crater.
||||Tape 91B/T|Page 1011
|137:37:11|CC|Roger, Ron. What's the color of the dome in Aitken?
|137:37:11|CMP|Well, the color of the dome in Aitken is - the colors are hard to - to visualize - the color of the dome is essentially the same as, as - pretty much the surrounding material around there. Maybe a little bit lighter - a little bit lighter than the surrounding material. Of course it's definitely lighter than the floor. The floor itself, to me, has a tan - had a tan to it.
|137:37:11|CC|Okay, Ron. We'll have to break away here a second. PAN CAMERA MODE to STANDBY.
|137:38:41|CMP|Okay.
|137:38:41|CC|If you haven't got your Plight Plan, it's PAN CAMERA MODE to STANDBY, then POWER ON.
|137:38:55|CMP|... Okay, POWER is going ON.
|137:38:55|CC|Okay, Ron. And it's time to charge battery A and we'll cue you on the PAN CAMERA POWER OFF. Okay, that should have been deleted. We've already charged the bat A, so - -
|137:38:55|CMP|... Yes. Yes. It's already charging.
|137:38:55|CC|Right. Sorry about that, Ron.
|137:38:55|CMP|Okay, no problem.
|137:39:17|CC|How about the freshness of the wall and ejecta materials, and the brightness of the rim deposits on Aitken while we have a minute here.
|137:39:17|CMP|Okay. The brightness of the rim deposits are a little bit brighter than the surrounding area on the thing. The way that you put It, probably early Eratosthenian. It's definitely not Copernican because I can't see - well, at least in that low Sun - I can't see any rays - any rays around it. But probably late Eratosthenian -somewhere in that area because you have the slumping - Well, it's not subdued at all. The walls themselves - of the crater are not subdued. They are fairly fresh - not as fresh as Copernican. And - and I just can't remember whether we had the - seems to me like it was brighter at the higher Sun angles around there, which indicate that there would still be some remnants of a -of a bright ring around it.
||||Tape 91B/8|Page 1012
|137:39:17|CC|Okay, Ron. And whenever you're ready, PAN CAMERA POWER to OFF.
|137:40:35|CMP|PAN CAMERA POWER is going OFF.
|137:40:35|CC|And -we're with all eyes here waiting for a Crisium-Serenitatis visual.
|137:40:35|CMP|(Laughter) Okay.
|137:40:35|CC|Anything at all, Ron, while we've got an open area, anything you want to say - we're following you on the map - just sing out.
|137:40:35|CMP|Okay.
|137:40:35|CC|Ron, while you're thinking here a second, do you have any views on the possible origin of the domes in Aitken?
|137:40:35|CMP|Well, I'm pretty sure they've got to be volcanic in origin. That's what - that's what it looks like to me anyhow. And especially if I can determine that the material in the northeast corner of Aitken has flown out of that domical little structure in there.
|137:40:35|CC|Roger. Understand.
|137:42:51|CMP|You know something - the observation that I think is pretty significant is the fact that most of the 30-kilometer craters on the back side of the Moon seem to be fairly fresh. And any of them that are fresh - by fresh I mean you don't have any real definite ray pattern to them, but you've got a real smooth - not smooth but streaked straight - slope, 45-degree angle going down into the crater and the crater wall. And then you get down to the bottom of the crater, and you got a flat floor down there or sometimes there is a domical type of a floor. And the domical material down there doesn't resemble anything like the stuff that's slumped down the side.
||||Tape 91B/9|Page 1013
|137:42:51|CC|Okay, we copy. Ron, if you're handy, you might hit Error RESET on the DSKY. It looks like you might have hit a MARK button or something.
|137:42:51|CMP|... Yes, might have hit the MARK button.
|137:42:51|CC|That - that makes it.
|137:42:51|CMP|Okay. I just got used to the other attitude, and now I'm at a different attitude. (Laughter) ... attitude, though.
|137:42:51|CC|Roger. Understand. Roger. Are you able to pick anything up on the Crisium yet?
|137:44:37|CMP|No, just now coming up on Crisium. I just now see it out of window 5È Just off the southern edge. Let me try window 3; I think it might be better.
|137:44:37|CC|Okay; you might remember we're looking for the colored tones , the shades between units up on Crisium, and we're looking for location of color boundaries relative to the mare ridge system.
|137:45:10|CMP|Okay, I'm looking at the eastern edge of Crisium now. As you come across there, it looks there might be - a little bit darker - You know, I keep seeing browns all the time up here instead of grays - gray tones. Maybe that's just the way I interpret them. They are - to me kind of a brownish tint to them, and it's a darker brown than the - the stuff to the - to the south of the ridge system there.
|137:45:10|CC|Roger. Ron, our data would show that CM5 might be a better window.
|137:45:10|CMP|Take a look at that one. Yes, it's a little better. Looking straight down. I am just now passing that crater I took a picture of on the last time - of the pass on there. And instead of having a round bottom, it's got a diamond-shape fill in the bottom. And the diamond, Itself, is about - oh, a half of the crater diameter. And this is on the south rim of Crisium.
||||Tape 91B/10|Page 1014
|137:45:10|CC|Okay. We copy. Does the ridge system cross the color boundary, Ron, in Crisium?
|137:46:52|CMP|Well, this ridge system is running east and west down here. The color boundary isn't nearly as apparent in Crisium as it is in Serenitatis. Except that right under me right now there's kind of a subdued crater-type thing and with a southern part of a ridge. The ridge runs east - west, and it looks like we've got a flow coming out of it. Let me see if I can get a quick picture of that one. Well, lost my camera (laughter). Here it is. Oh, it's too late; it's gone now. You know something, you see this subsolar point, it's kind of -zero phase - zero phase point, I mean, is following me right along out here in Crisium, so I get a different color straight out from the window than I do out from the edge of it. So I think that's going to influence my thinking.
|137:46:52|CC|Roger, Ron. How does color of Picard - the rim deposits on Picard compare to the surrounding mare material there?
|137:48:35|CMP|Okay. The color on Picard is - is definitely darker. It's got a darker rim, darker material that goes out to - oh about a half a crater and some points extending out to a crater diameter. And then from south arcing around to the west to -to the northwest corner, you got some light-colored material on top of that.
|137:48:35|CC|Is any of that tan or brown?
|137:48:35|CMP|It's kind of a - the darker material I'd call tannish-gray. More gray than tan. In other words, the whole mare, itself, I'd consider kind of a - kind of a light tan. And then the type of material, the dark material that's flowing out -has flown out - is kind of a tannish-gray.
|137:48:35|CC|Okay. In the inner appearances of Picard, for color variations, can you determine different units based on color and flow characteristics?
||||Tape 91B/11|Page 1015
|137:49:42|CMP|Yes, you can. In the area where you have the white thrown out on top, you essentially got a -as - as you go down the crater wall, you've got a white streak that goes all the way around it, and then you've got a dark layer underneath that. And then a white layer on below that.
|137:49:42|CC|Roger. Are you saying the color zones are concentric?
|137:49:42|CMP|Yes, the color zones are concentric going around.
|137:49:42|CC|Beautiful. How about the central peak material to that of the crater walls?
|137:50:30|CMP|Well, the central peak material is - you know, it's more smooth-type stuff. This stuff in the crater walls is - fine, straight sloping, except where it is slumped down. Where it's slumped down, it's just kind of piled up - a jumble of -type stuff, you know?
|137:50:30|CC|Roger.
|137:50:30|CMP|You know, in the crater nearest over there has the same color distinction around it for - out for about a crater diameter, except it doesn't have any of the light material on it at all.
|137:50:30|CC|Okay, Ron, we might direct your attention to the dark halo craters in the western Mare Crisium. Are they impact or volcanic in origin?
|137:50:30|CMP|You can see some of the rays from the crater Proclus have spread out all the way across here. And they completely cover up the ridge system that goes around there, so I can't see any color distinction on the eastern - or on the western edge of Crisium.
|137:50:30|CC|Roger. We copy. How about those dark halo craters? Are they volcanic in origin?
||||Tape 91B/12|Page 1016
|137:51:40|CMP|Some of the - Yes, I was looking at the volcanic -or the dark-rimmed craters, and some of them have what I'd call a - an ejecta pattern around them; and the others just have kind of a raised rim with no apparent blocks. The one to the west - let's see, southwest - of that little V that sticks out there by Yerkes - that hill that sticks out there by Yerkes - now, that's the one that, to me, looks like it has an ejecta pattern around it with blocks It's about a - oh, a thousand-meter crater.
|137:51:40|CC|Roger. Got it. Oh that crater that you mentioned was a flow pattern, will you be sure and make a mark on your map on that, please? We're really interested in that.
|137:51:40|CMP|Okay.
|137:51:40|CC|Should be coming up on Macrobius by now, aren't you?
|137:53:07|CMP|Yes, I can just barely see Macrobius. And - ... be better out of window 3.
|137:53:07|CC|Okay. We're standing by.
|137:53:07|CMP|I'm looking for any dark-halo craters in - I was looking for any dark-halo .craters in this area that might be sticking through the Proclus rays. Well, you know, you compare on either side of the Proclus ray, though, and the same size crater rather ... Tranquilitatis or the - the moundy stuff before you get to Tranquilitatis are really underneath Coper - the - the Proclus ray. You get the same albedo of ray material from the small craters in either case.
|137:53:07|CC|Roger. We understand.
|137:54:12|CMP|Oh, here's a Macrobius A and B. Course, J-3 is up there. The two dark craters - well, the one just - north, I guess, of Macrobius A, and also north of J-3 - that's the one that has the dark mound around it. It's got a small dome down in the center. It - it doesn't have any ejecta pattern around it - you know, no rays, no nothing. To me, that looks like - it sure looks like a cinder cone to me. You get that same type of feeling. The dark halo that goes around it goes out for at least a crater and a half diameter. The raised dome down in the center of the crater is about a fourth of a crater diameter. And there are no rays. And it has a dark halo.

|137:54:12|CC|See any color tones on that crater at all, Ron?
|137:56:05|CMP|Yes, the color on that particular - color of that is the same color as you see in Maraldi and as you see in the landing site. And that is what I consider the dark tannish - tannish gray.
||||Tape 92B/1|Page 1037
|137:55:01|CMP|Yes, the color on that particular - the color cf that is the same color as you see in Maraldi and as you see in the - the landing site. And that is what I - what I consider the dark - tannish -tannish-gray type of material. And again, the fresh craters around Maraldi still look kind of bluish to me, not as much as they did yesterday, but they still look kind of a - have a bluish tint to them from the reflection of the Sun. In other words, they are fresh craters and they are about the size of - one of them is about the size of MOCR, and the other one is about the size of Sherlock or Camelot.
|137:55:01|CC|Okay. You're around Maraldi now ... - -
|137:55:01|CMP|... same way. Yes, I'm still on Maraldi. Yes.
|137:55:01|CC|Okay - -
|137:55:01|CMP|I was on Maraldi, and - -
|137:55:01|CC|How about comparing the floor fill of Maraldi to the light plains In Maraldi E?
|137:55:01|CMP|The floor fill in Maraldi is definitely a darker color. The light plains in Maraldi E are the -the light-tan material. And Maraldi - The floor of Maraldi looks just like the landing site.
|137:55:01|CC|How about the color, tone, and texture of Maraldi Gamma?
|137:57:44|CMP|Okay. Maraldi Gamma looks just like the rest of all of the surrounding hills around there. I think that's just a - some of the - what do you call it, the Sculptured Hills type of material that has been - was high and has been inundated by mare flow at one time or another. It had - mare flows kind of come up around it.
|137:57:44|CC|Okay. How about the domical hills inside of Vitruvius A, as compared to Aitken?
||||Tape 92B/2|Page 1038
|137:57:44|CMP|Okay. I just missed that one. We'll have to pet that one on the way by.
|137:57:44|CC|Okay.
|137:58:23|CMP|Next time I guess. Right now, I'm looking at the ridge system around the annulus of Serenitatis. And the dark material stops before you get up to -Oh, what's the crater that sticks into the side of Serenitatis and sticks out beyond the eastern edge of Serenitatis? Anyhow, the dark material stops before you get to there. The dark material only goes up to - let's see - There's a definite rllle. There's a wrinkled ridge and at the east of the wrinkled ridge, there are two craters, about 20 kilometers in diameter. And then farther east of that is the - the rille. A graben, it looks like that goes up - and that's about the extent of the dark area that's the same as the - the same material as the landing site.
|137:58:23|CC|Roger. We copy.
|137:58:23|CC|Okay, Ron. That - that completes the visuals on this pass. We - if you want to look some more, we've got some time. We do have some Flight Plan camera pads and all that, but no hurry on any of it.
|137:58:23|CC|We do have some attitude changes - -
|137:58:23|CMP|- - continue looking here until we pass - oh, do you need an attitude change now?
|137:58:23|CC|No, that's not until 46. We got some time on that. It's a VERB - change of NOUN 78.
|137:58:23|CMP|Okay. Give me a clue about a minute ahead of that,.
|137:58:23|CC|Yes, I'll do that, Ron. Just keep talking.
|138:00:09|CMP|Okay. We're in the Tacquet area now, and in this case, the wrinkled ridge system that's out in the middle does not make a change in the color boundary. The color boundary is completely out to the outer edge and is - in the area of those - the rille. Those are - There's kind of arcuate rilles, straight rilles, and in the Tacquet, yesterday, I said this was Sulpicius Callus, but it's Tacquet - Tacquet area, but ... - -
||||Tape 92B/3|Page 1039
|138:00:09|CC|Roger, Ron. Can you give us a color difference on the dark mantle and the mare at this Sun angle?
|138:01:07|CMP|Yes, the color difference - again the - You know, I just - I just now noticed that when I get down at this Sun angle, out in front of me, I got one color, and then I look straight down and I have a different color. But in this Tacquet area, you've definitely got some cinder cone type - No, I don't want to say cinder cone, but anyhow - volcanic. And it almost looks like a breached cinder cone right next to - I think it's Melrose [?] - is the name of that - that crater - the big one that's right on the edge of Serenitatis. I'll find it on the map and mark it for sure. But just to the east of that, it sure looks like a breached cinder cone in - in - in one of those rilles down there. And then that type of material is - is - kind of a dark tan in - at this Sun angle. And it's definitely darker than the - than the Serenitatis Basin material.
|138:01:07|CC|I think it's Tacquet is the name of that crater. Isn't it, Ron?
|138:01:07|CMP|Tacquet is the little one, and then - then there's a bigger one right next to Tacquet.
|138:01:07|CC|Okay. Menelaus is just to the east of Tacquet there.
|138:03:04|CC|Hey, Ron, I - I blew that. Menelaus is west of Tacquet up there.
|138:03:04|CMP|Yes, Menelaus; that's the one.
|138:03:04|CC|Any textural difference between the dark mantle in the site and the Sulpicius Callus formation, Ron?
|138:03:04|CMP|Yes, there is.
||||Tape 92B/4|Page 1040
|138:03:04|CC|Would you attribute it to the actual ground or would you attribute it to possibly the Sun angle difference?
|138:03:04|CMP|I think, I would attribute it really to the - to the actual ground. I guess what I am going to have to do is really wait until the Sun angle gets a little bit higher there in that Tacquet region to answer that for sure. But it seems to me like the - the material in the landing site area is -is more smooth, you know, or smoother than what's in the Tacquet region. The part in the Tacquet region seemed to me like it was - is - It's just a rougher-looking-type material. You know, not - not massive. Hey. There's D - D-Caldera. Hey, what do you know?
|138:05:06|CC|Do you have - do have any dark - do you have any dark halo craters near Sulpicius Gallus?
|138:05:06|CMP|Yes. The - I'll be darned.
|138:05:06|CC|We're - we're with bated breath, waiting.
|138:05:06|CMP|... Picture 28 of D-Caldera with the Hasselblad. I mean with the Nikon (laughter), and Sun angle must be about 1 or 2 degrees.
|138:05:06|CC|Roger. We copy.
|138:05:06|CMP|You know, I really didn't concentrate too much on - on Sulpicius Gallus at that - that particular passing, I was concentrating on the Tacquet area, and in that - in that case, all of the - the rilles and the ridges - not the wrinkled ridges out in the middle out in there, but the rilles and the area built up around the rilles and also associated maybe - Oh, I was going to say 10 times the will -the rilles width is all one color.
|138:05:06|CC|Okay, Ron. We'd like HIGH GAIN to AUTO, and we'd like to load your NOUN 78.
|138:06:41|CMP|Okay. HIGH GAIN to AUTO. Let me see, 22 NOUN 70 to ENTER. Okay. Let's see, plus 5?.25- Plus 52.25. Up-1ink. VERB 58 ENTER. ... PROCEED to ... gets out of the way. Okay. D-Caldera was taken on picture number 28. It was f/8 at 1/500, and then I took three more before that. They're terminator photos, looking north across Sulpicius Gallus and farther north. And they were 1/500 at f/l6 to start with and then f/11.

|138:06:41|CC|Roger, Ron.
|138:06:41|CMP|That's probably about all I'm allowed, I think, on this XX film.
|138:06:41|CC|What was your last frame number on XX, Ron?
|138:06:41|CMP|Yes, that was - I'm on number 29 now.
|138:06:41|CC|29- Roger. You're on 29, right here.
|138:06:41|CMP|Say, on magazine Oscar Oscar, did we get enough of our required photos out of that, or are the rest of those - opportunity or not?
|138:06:41|CC|We'll check on that with FAO, Ron. I do have one Flight Plan update for you on the pan camera photo pad. But you first ought to go to the IMAGE MOTION, INCREASE, barber pole plus four steps, to ON, and LASER ALTIMETER, ON.
|138:06:41|CMP|Right now, you mean?
|138:06:41|CC|Yes, it's - It's time, Ron. It's time for that.
|138:09:35|CMP|Okay. IMAGE MOTION - let's see - I think that was barber pole plus three before. There it is, 3 - 4 -
|138:09:56|CMP|LASER ALTIMETER, ON.
|138:09:56|CC|Okay, Ron. That pan camera - -
|138:09:56|CMP|I hope to pick up some answers to some of t,hos--.o things on a couple more pasties. Okuy. That's right. Go ahead.
|138:09:56|CC|Okay. Did - did it bother you, me - me reading some of those questions to you? I know you'd probably had time to study them, but I thought I'd jog your memory on them.
||||Tape 92B/6|Page 1042
|138:09:56|CMP|Oh, no. That's - no, that's good. I appreciate it.
|138:09:56|CC|Okay. I'll get a conference here with Farouk before we start the next pass on the next- rev around and see if we can improve it. Things worked perfect down here. We - I had the questions in front of me, and Farouk flipped them into the screen and it really worked great.
|138:09:56|CC|Okay, Ron - -
|138:09:56|CMP|Yes. That's good, okay.
|138:10:44|CC|- - at l4l:50, I've got the pan camera photo pad.

|138:10:54|CC|Good show, Ron. It's - your bird now for a while.
|138:10:54|CMP|Okay.
|138:12:37|CC|Ron, just for your information, we're playing back the voice playback from the last rev, and it'll be recorded in house. It is readable, and we can read it.
|138:12:37|CMP|Oh, okay. Good. I purposely tried to keep one of the microphones right on my mouth on those things. I don't know if that helps or hinders it .
|138:12:37|CC|Roger, Ron - -
|138:12:37|CMP|At least I could hear myself talk that way.
|138:12:37|CC|Roger. It worked. We can read it, and somebody can listen to it here when we get a chance. How about on this back side of this next rev? Looks like you're pretty busy with some pads and - and some photo work in there. Do you expect to be doing any recording - much recording there?
||||Tape 92B/7|Page 1043
|138:12:37|CMP|No, probably not. I'll just try to - try to make notes of it or something, and then pass it on out when I come out the other side.
|138:12:37|CC|Good show, Ron. Good show.
|138:14:07|CC|And your - your grounded friends down there are busy working around the LM right now and doing some loading the Rover and that, getting ready for the EVA-2 work. They're out on the surface and loading the Rover.
|138:14:07|CMP|Very good. I'll be glad to - curious to know if they can make it up that hill or not - to Scarp.
|138:14:07|CC|Roger.
|138:14:07|CMP|Looks like they should be able to go right up that valley, the way they've got it planned there.
|138:14:07|CC|Gene's got to take some time here on this EVA and make a fender. We're - we're piecing together a couple of maps and trying to get a fender, because they lost a piece of the fender last night.
|138:14:07|CMP|(Laughter) They did, huh?
|138:14:07|CC|We're going to give Gene his auto mechanic's license if it works.
|138:14:57|CMP|How's my - yes, right. How's my ZPN? All I did was move it. I didn't put in a new sensor yet. Do I need to put on a new sensor?
|138:17:34|CC|Ron, the ZPN data isn't too good. It's the sensor sponges need to be replaced, if you didn't already replace them.
|138:17:34|CMP|(Laughter) Thought I'd get by without replacement. Yes, I'll replace them pretty quick.
|138:17:34|CC|Hey - you know - your choice. We can - we can stand the crew exercise period without replacing them, I'm sure.
||||Tape 92B/8|Page 1044
|138:17:34|CMP|Okay. While I was eating my peanut butter awhile ago, I lost my lobster bisque and my Juice. And I just now found it.
|138:19:08|CC|Okay, Ron. Here's your word on some magazines here X-ray X-ray has to be left for the Zodiacal light. You - you should not take any more on X-ray X-ray until after Zodiacal light. Mag Oscar Oscar and Papa Papa are yours to play with, as long as you stay with the Flight Plan on the rest of the mags .
|138:19:08|CMP|Okay.
|138:19:08|CC|And those are your crew options for the rest of the mission, those two mags.
|138:19:08|CMP|Okay. In other words, we made it up on Oscar Oscar, I guess, on that one pass, huh? Rest of them are - are crew options.
|138:19:08|CC|Roger.
|138:25:38|CC|Hey, Ron. You got a 110 heart rate. What are you doing?
|138:25:38|CMP|(Laughter) Shaking the couch.
|138:25:38|CC|(Laughter) I thought we could hear that. That's pretty good.
|138:25:38|CMP|Shaking the couch (laughter).
|138:26:19|CC|Okay. Keep it up, there; you got 120 now. Dr. Berry would like to keep it there for a while.
|138:26:19|CMP|(Laughter) I'm getting tired.
|138:26:19|CC|That's the whole idea of the thing, Ron.

||||Tape 92B/9|Page 1045
|138:31:47|CC|Hate to say this, because it's very dead serious work, but I'm kind of watching a lunar comedy as the - the two lunar stalwarts are trying to plan the new fender on the vehicle down there.
|138:31:47|CMP|(Laughter) I'll bet that's really no easy job, you know.
|138:31:47|CC|That's right. They've got a couple of their clamps - what they did is they - -
|138:31:47|CMP|... kind of hard.
|138:31:47|CC|They took a couple of their clamps, and they took -taped together in the cockpit a couple of their big lunar maps - the big heavy maps - and they're - now they're clamping that map to the fender where the removable part is.
|138:31:47|CMP|Oh, I see. Must be pretty dusty down there or something.
|138:32:33|CC|Yes. Well, they lost a fender, and it was throwing dust up on Gene. It's just ridiculous how much dust they got on them, so they - they just decided they just had to go ahead and do something.
|138:32:33|CMP|Yes.
|138:32:33|CC|I would hate to be paying for that fender repair job by the minute.
|138:32:33|CMP|(Laughter) Boy, that's for sure.
|138:32:33|CC|Oh, that was me - went off on the wrong loop, - loop there, Ron.
|138:32:33|CMP|Oh, okay. (Laught er) Okay.
|138:32:33|CMP|On that Crisium Serenitatis - number 4 of 5 - that - dark dome just to the northwest of J-3 - the one I was talking about that had the typical cone-type shape with the dome down in the side of it.

|138:32:33|CMP|Yes. Okay. Okay.
|138:40:45|CC|Just talked to the home front a little while ago, and everybody's fine, Ron. And they were able to get the squawk boxes squared away, so she should have been listening to you for last couple of passes - all on the ... The problem was it wasn't able to shut off one loop or the other, so today we've been - they've been able to get all - just the CSM loop in there for - during the AOS periods.
|138:40:45|CMP|Oh, I see. Otherwise, they - they were both coming in, huh?
|138:40:45|CC|Yes. Last night, they were both coming in. Today, they got it squared away, so you're just coming in, and they are able to watch and listen to the other one on - on the TV camera.
|138:40:45|CMP|Yes. TV, yes.
|138:40:45|CC|And they say they are looking forward to good weather tomorrow. Supposed to finally get a break in this stuff tomorrow.

|139:29:50|CMP|Houston, America.
|139:29:50|CC|Go.ahead, Ron.
|139:29:50|CMP|Okay, Robert. I guess the big thing I want to report from the back side on this one here is that I took another look at the - the Cloverleaf in Aitken, with the binocs, and that southern, domical crater of the Cloverleaf - it has a breach on the east - east side of it. it - I can't tell -There's - there's a flow - In other words, the domical structures, themselves, are part of a flow material that is partially filled up the breach. In other words, the breach has either flowed into that little domical structure before the domes were built, or else all of that stuff that's in the mare floor has flown out of that domical structure before the domes came in. In other words, the domical structures, themselves, are different time relationship to the floor, itself. They are - are younger than the floor, itself.
|139:29:50|CC|Roger, Ron. We copy that.
|139:35:20|CC|Ron, is there a difference in the color between the dome and the mare in Aitken, there?
|139:35:20|CMP|Yes, there - yes, there is. The dome-type material is - the colors again are very hard, you know? I'm just going to have to say that it's - it's slightly darker than the mare floor - is the way it looks to me, right at this point in time. Also, the texture is a coarser texture than the floor itself. In other words, the floor, to me, is kind of a standard mare flat-floor-type stuff. And I have to compare the texture of the domical hills to - Oh - I guess what I would imagine is some of the dacite flows that I've seen out in California. You know, the heavy viscous-type flows.

|139:35:20|CC|Roger. We copy there, Ron.
|139:35:20|CC|That's good data on Aitken there, Ron. Those color differences any - on any of these things - that color is one of the most important things you can give us. We'll be all ears for that. È
|139:35:20|CMP|Okay. I'll try to - The trouble with colors, I'm finding out, is that - it's sure a function of the Sun angle as to what color it appears to your eye.
|139:35:20|CC|Roger. We can believe that. We just - we'll - -
|139:35:20|CMP|... passes. Yes.
|139:37:41|CMP|You know, you take a look at the central peak of Neper, and on the south and western edge of it, you get the vertical stripes in it or streaking like you get off of the massifs in the landing site area. And then, you look at the area around in the rim - around the rim of Neper, and you get the corncob - I guess - or Sculptured Hill-type of appearance.

|139:40:11|CC|Roger. Understand. Condorcet Hotel.
|139:40:11|CMP|Condor - Condorcet Alfa - it's either got a landslide - I'll get a picture of that the next time with - with the other frame, but it's either got a landslide on it, or it's had a - And it doesn't look like a crater on the side of the wall, on the northwest wall of the crater.
|139:40:11|CC|Okay. We copy that. Northwest wall of Condorcet A
|139:40:11|CMP|That's a - the area is oval or ellipse shape. Of course, the top of the ellipse is toward the top of the crater. And it looks like it's - almost gets a flow out of the bottom of the ellipse, which is about a fourth of the way up from the bottom of the crater.
|139:40:11|CC|Ron, can you give me a scale on the size of that flow, as compared to the rest of the crater?
|139:40:11|CMP|Uhhh. The - the hole or the slope or the slide, or whatever you want to call it, down through there, is maybe one-eighth of the crater diameter. And the floor area is only just a real small portion of one-eighth size. it's a ... - -
|139:40:11|CC|You seeing any lineaments in the area? Any lineaments in the area?
|139:40:11|CMP|Yes. There was some lineaments on the area - in the area; and again, they're vertical-type lineaments or lineations kind of like the - the downslope - operations of most ... craters.
|139:40:11|CC|Roger.

|139:45:34|CMP|They're fresher ones. Okay, let's see. We're going to Picard and then on up to - Yerkes - Where's Yerkes? There it is. Okay. Let's see where we're aiming at, here. Okay, is it about time, does it look like?
|139:45:34|CC|Roger. You can start at - you're just about 30 seconds from starting on Picard, And like you said on the map, you go up - you go up Picard, after you start up Picard X, there, and you go on up through Picard and Yerkes and that - -
|139:45:34|CMP|Okay.
|139:45:34|CC|- - that front there, up at Yerkes' area. That's the Yerkes. Right above there is where you change to f/11.
|139:45:34|CMP|Okay. Okay, here we go.
|139:46:21|CMP|Started it, Picard X,
|139:46:21|CMP|Works better when you take the slide out.
|139:46:21|CC|If you'll give me kind of a call at what you're aiming at, like Picard X and Picard, I can give you a call on those f-stops, Ron.
|139:46:21|CMP|Okay. I just passed Picard X; and then the one west of that. *** what it was. The next - about half the size of Picard X. Hey, does this go right through Picard? Or south of it?
|139:46:21|CC|No, it goes right through dead center of Picard.
|139:46:21|CMP|Okay. We!ll get it.
|139:47:43|CMP|Sure hope that color difference shows up in - on Picard.
|139:47:43|CC|Roger. We hope so9 too.
|139:47:43|CMP|There's black material - now - get on up here -you get on up here5 the darker tannish-gray material covers essentially from the east all the way around to the south. it goes outside the rim as well as inside the rim. it drapes over the rim. That can't be a shadow effect.
||||Tape 93B/5|Page 1106
|139:47:43|CC|Have you taken Picard yet, Ron?
|139:47:43|CMP|Just now. Just one more, and I'll be through with Picard. Change to what?
|139:47:43|CC|No, not yet. You don't change it until you get on the other side of Yerkes, up there. Your path goes directly between Yerkes and ... - -
|139:47:43|CMP|Okay. Let me go to f/ll.
|139:47:43|CC|No. Don't change to f/ll until you're at Yerkes.
|139:47:43|CMP|Yes, okay. Until I get to the other side of Yerkes.
|139:47:43|CMP|I can still see those dark halo craters down there. I'm going to have to look at them with the binocs sometime.
|139:47:43|CC|Roger.
|139:47:43|CC|Okay. When you're at Yerkes there, you want to switch to f/ll. Just - -
|139:47:43|CMP|Okay.
|139:47:43|CC|And looking west, you'll go right through Proclus.
|139:47:43|CMP|Okay.
|139:47:43|CMP|Now, what comes after Proclus?
|139:47:43|CC|Okay. You just keep pressing on up through -through - up in towards Maraldi. You go up through Proclus, and then Proclus D; and at that point, you'll change to f/5.6 and then get - get into the Maraldi N, across the maria there; and the mare of Tran - Tranquillity.
||||Tape 93B/6|Page 1107
|139:47:43|CMP|Oh, okay.
|139:47:43|CMP|It's sure easy to see why that - ray excluded zone shows up on the pictures because, to me, it's -it's a tan Sculptured Hill-type material - where -in the ray excluded zone of Proclus.
|139:47:43|CC|Okay, Ron. The - this pass continues and you change to 5-6 up there at Proclus D at the mare/ highland contact at Proclus - up around Proclus and Franz.
|139:53:13|CMP|Okay. it's about now. Change to 5-6. Getting out into the mare.
|139:53:13|CC|Okay. You go right across the Mare - Maraldi M and Maraldi D, and across Vitruvius A and Vitruvius.
|139:53:13|CMP|Oh. Okay. it's a little closer in, then.
|139:53:32|CC|And, at Vitruvius again - -
|139:53:32|CMP|At - Okay, Vitruvius? Yes, okay; f/4. You know, if you can look up on your map, it looks like there's kind of a subdued ... almost submerged crater, between - I mean just east of Vitruvius A. And that - that domical mounds that are sticking up around there are the same type of structures as Maraldi Gamma. And that's what lead me to believe that - you know - it's just some old jumbled-up-type stuff that was here before the mare.
|139:53:32|CC|Roger. We copy.
|139:53:32|CMP|That has a completely - it has a completely different - texture to it than the domical structures of Aitken.
|139:53:32|CC|Okay. We got that.
||||Tape 93B/7|Page 1108
|139:53:32|CC|Okay. Have you gotten up over, vertical over Vitruvius? If you are, that's where you go to f/4.
|139:53:32|CMP|Not quite. I'm in Vitruvius A, right now.
|139:53:32|CC|Okay. Good show.
|139:53:32|CMP|And I just took a peak at it with the binocs and -Let's see, I'm 5*6 at 1/250. And that's a different type of material. it looks like it's a - it almost has to be a slump-type of operation. Somehow, it gets piled up down in the middle. But they're a smoother, more subdued type of domical structures than the ones in Aitken. Okay. Switching to f/4 - -
|139:53:32|CC|Roger; f/4 - -
|139:53:32|CMP|- - 1/250.
|139:53:32|CC|Your track goes right across the mare - the mare there between Tranquillity and Serenity - right across Dawes, and ends at just to the east and north of Plinius. On that - -
|139:53:32|CMP|Okay.
|139:53:32|CC|- - that appears to be the boundary between Tranquillity and Serenity.
|139:53:32|CMP|No, when I take a look at it from this angle, you even get a different - the - the ejecta from Plinius kind of covers up the rilles and the annulus around Serenitatis.
|139:57:29|CMP|Now, we're getting into a relatively low Sun. And Serenitatis is a lot lighter colored than the -the light tan, to me. And then you Ñ in the low Sun, you look out into Tranquillitatis, across Plinius, and that demarcation turns out to be the same - same kind of gray-tan. You know, it's a darker -
||||Tape 93B/8|Page 1109
|139:57:29|CC|But there is a color difference between Serenity and Tranquillitatis, there?
|139:57:29|CMP|Yes. There's a definite color difference between Tra - and it almost looks like - If you could stand on color alone, the color from Tranquillitatis extends on over, and covers into - you know, kind of drapes over the edge and covers up part Serenity.
|139:57:29|CC|Okay. We got that. Well, that should be all of your photos there, on that pass, Ron.
|139:57:29|CMP|Oh, okay. (Laught er)
|139:57:29|CC|And, Ron, before we get into the visual, here, we'd like HIGH GAIN, AUTO.
|139:58:40|CMP|Okay. HIGH GAIN -
|139:58:40|CC|And, can you give me --
|139:58:40|CMP|... away from the window, here.
|139:58:40|CC|- - a magazine report on that two pictures?
|139:58:40|CMP|Okay. We're magazine Lima Lima. And it's 129-
|139:58:40|CMP|Yes, we're at the same Sun angle, and there's no doubt about it from Tacquet on up to Mel something or other, there's a group of small rilles in there, and those rilles have got ejected material, around and up and over the rilles. And not - not impact-type ejecta. it's got to be a volcanic ejecta of some kind up and around there. it's a dark brown -a darker brown, than the tan of Serenitatis.
|139:58:40|CC|Roger. You're referring to the Menulus [sic] rilles, there, right to the west of Tacquet, right? That's to the west of Tacquet? Still, it looks like it's in the Serenitatis - Serenitatis Basin, right on the edge of it.
||||Tape 93B/9|Page 1110
|140:01:13|CC|Roger. We see -them.
|140:01:13|CMP|And then they kind of st - they stop just even with Mel whatever it is. (Laughter) Malinius or something like that.
|140:01:13|CC|Not Melinius or Menelaus? Pick your pick.
|140:01:13|CMP|Yes. Okay.
|140:01:36|CC|You see a ray coming out of Menelaus going through -through Bessel? is that one of Tycho's rays?
|140:01:36|CMP|It disappeared. I couldn't - couldn't see that one.
|140:01:36|CC|Roger.
|140:01:36|CMP|Take a look the next time around.
|140:01:36|CC|That was my question. I was just curious.
|140:01:36|CMP|Yes. I know it shows it on the map there, and I haven't really got a good - a good clear picture of a ray, yet.
|140:01:36|CC|I'm going to be more interested to see it - -
|140:01:36|CMP|I'll look for it for sure the next time.
|140:01:36|CC|Ñ - I want to - more interested to see if you can see the alleged crater Arabia on this next pass-
|140:01:36|CMP|(Laughter) I've been looking for that every pass. And - there's a lot of depressions - and ridges and - hills around there. it's hard to - see, you don't really get a big picture view of it. You get a little piece of it at a time. And I think, in order to really con - convince yourself that you got something there, you're going to have to get - get off - away from it. And - -
|140:01:36|CC|Roger. Understand.
|140:01:36|CMP|*** D-Caldera is sure a depression. Like nothing I've ever seen before.
||||Tape 93B/10|Page 1111
|140:01:36|CC|Got you. You're going to get a chance to get some pictures of that next - next rev.
|140:01:36|CMP|Next rev? Okay, they ought to be good ones because the Sun angle is going to be pretty good. But, at this point, you get a dark tan, kind of a mare-type material - it's in mare-type materials And then it's a light gray down in the D-Caldera itself. Sure looks like a "D" all right. But it's a light gray down in there. And then it's got burnps that stick up, and the burnps themselves are - I want to look at it again for sure. But I get the impression the burnps, themselves, are the light tan material.
|140:04:59|CC|Okay. Understand. The burnps are light tan. Right?
|140:04:59|CMP|Whereas, down - Yes, the burnps are light tan. And down between the burnps that are down in the Caldera, it looks like a rough - real rough blocky - gray material.
|140:04:59|CMP|Bob, I hope you're keeping me honest on the Flight Plan. I got my head out the window. I can't follow the Flight Plan.
|140:04:59|CC|Affirmative. All you got is, in about 4 minutes, or 3 minutes, now, you pick up orbital science visuals on Copernicus. And we'll just stay with you on those orb science visuals right through Reiner Gajrnna. And at 143:12, you've got a rather rapid time, you might want to quit early. You got the LOI [sic] canister change. Then you got a P52. So, your choice on that. I'll call you right at 143:12, if that's what you want.
|140:06:13|CMP|Okay, yes. Give me a call right there, because I got to get ready for this - I'll do the PJ2 first, so you all can see it, then I can always change that canister.
|140:06:13|CC|Yes, okay. We'll concur on that; but just don't forget it.
|140:06:13|CMP|Okay.
||||Tape 93B/11|Page 1112
|140:06:13|CC|Ron, you're coming up on Copernicus; I might read you some of these questions. One of them was, "Study the floor of Copernicus, and compare its material to that on the walled terraces." The other one is, "When viewed from the opposite direction, is there an extension of the structure in the middle central peak?" I guess that we refer to that as what might be a dike In that middle central peak. And "What is the nature of that structure?"
|140:06:13|CMP|Okay. I think those things are going to be kind of hard to see. But we'll try.
|140:06:13|CC|The back room would like you to kind of concentrate on looking on that dike, if it is at all possible, Ron. Even if you have to use - -
|140:06:13|CMP|Okay. I'll --
|140:06:13|CC|- - even if you have to use the binoculars.
|140:06:13|CMP|- - get the ole binocs, here. Okay.
|140:08:25|CC|If you want to feel for some scale on that, just a reminder: the crater is about 3 kilometers deep, and the central peak is 400 meters high, Ron.
|140:08:25|CMP|400 meters. Okay.
|140:08:25|CMP|Is this Eratosthenes I'm passing over now? 1 hope.
|140:08:25|CC|Yes. You should be just about over Eratosthenes right now.
|140:09:57|CMP|1 hope it's Eratosthenes because the old Sun's shining right on my rendezvous light, out here.
|140:09:57|CC|Roger.
|140:09:57|CMP|And you can't see anything out the window.
|140:09:57|CMP|Ahhhhhh, there's Copernicus.
|140:09:57|CMP|And I'll tell you what. 1 think we - need more daylight (1aught er).
||||Tape 93B/12|Page 1113
|140:09:57|CC|Kind of tough, huh?
|140:09:57|CMP|Yes, especially the binocs cut off - they must cut off too much light or something.
|140:09:57|CC|Okay, we understand that. Might just stick with the naked eye then and do the best you can, I guess.
|140:09:57|CMP|Well, I'm trying to - to recall what Jack said on it, and what I see. I'm not sure, did he mention the - the dark part to the south - on the south side of Copernicus? In other words, you can see albedoes real well, and there's a dark area that extends maybe - oh, a half a crater diameter, three-quarters of a crater diameter to the south5 and then it kind of flows down in -I don't know - I don't want to say flows, but at least it carries itself down - down the crater wall - down to the crater floor. And this is kind of in the south maybe from 6 - or let's see, from about 4:30 to 7:30. And then the rest of the crater all the way - all the rest of the way around it, you can see light albedo step all away around the crater. The first step down about a fourth of the way down in the crater wall.
|140:13:31|CC|I don't recall that, but sounds good, Ron.
|140:13:31|CMP|Okay. Unfortunately, those things really disappear fast.
|140:13:31|CC|Roger. Take - take a look at the peaks and concentrate on that mountain in the center of the peaks, If you will, Ron.
|140:13:31|CMP|Okay. is - it's already passed now but I can recall as - as I was looking at it, the peaks -well, seems to me like there's four and they have the same light albedo texture as the - not texture, but the same light albedo - as that first - rings on the inner wall of the crater. And then interspersed between those white peaks were a darker -you could just tell it's the darker - albedo. And you couldn't tell for sure - it's not part of the crater floor, it's just a darker albedo interspersed in there. And I spent - oh, half my time trying to acquire the thing in the binocs. And it just cuts - the binocs just cut down the light too much.
||||Tape 93B/13|Page 1114
|140:13:31|CC|Okay. We'll try maybe later on with the binocs on Copernicus. I guess you're coming up in the Kepler area, aren't you - your - your right coming up on Kepler B.
|140:13:31|CMP|Yes. I think there should be Kepler B right out there now.
|140:13:31|CMP|Let's see - Yes, that's out in Oceanus Procellarum, I guess, isn't it?
|140:15:32|CC|That's af firmat ive.
|140:15:32|CMP|Yes, and then Aristarchus is coming up, I think, isn't it? No, that's Kepler.
|140:15:32|CC|I think Kepler is the real bright one with many bright rays from - coming out it.
|140:15:32|CMP|Yes, it's got a - got a lot of the bright rays on it. Kepler D, and must be another one down there. They, the two small Keplers, don't show any bright rays at all. Do show they're - they've bright slopes on the inner walls. The rays of Kepler really show up quite markedly in the earth-shine. I bet - I bet they show up probably better in earthshine than they do - otherwise. Because I think earthshine tends to bring out the - the albedo differences - considerably.
|140:16:55|CC|Why don't you give me a hack when you're right over Kepler, Ron?
|140:16:55|CMP|Okay, will do. And then what's directly south of Kepler, there's one about the same size as Kepler?
|140:16:55|CC|Encke is about the same size and directly south of Kepler.
||||Tape 93B/14|Page 1115
|140:16:55|CMP|Yes, that's Encke. Okay, Encke.
|140:16:55|CMP|Encke has - departing from the west - Yes, no, I mean departing on its eastern side - it's either -it's a light - I don't see how in the world it can have only one ray, but that's the only one I can see. But there's a light streak - oh about an eighth of the diameter of Encke; and it goes out to the east a little ways and then curves back - it goes out to the east - oh, about three-quarters of the crater diameter, and then it essentially curves back to the northeast and continues on out for another crater diameter.
|140:18:20|CC|Roger. Good show.
|140:18:20|CMP|That might be - that might be the margin of the highlands, there. I'm not sure.
|140:18:20|CC|Okay.
|140:18:20|CMP|Let's see, Reiner Gamma is going to be out of window 3, won't it?
|140:18:20|CC|That's affirmative, Ron. Window 3 for Reiner Gamma.
|140:18:20|CMP|Yes- you know, a rise from a relatively flat area up to a kind of a - a hilly terrain.
|140:21:51|CC|Any dark deposits associated with the Gamma? Reiner Gamma?
|140:21:51|CMP|Yes, it's - the Gamma, itself, is - is dark. Now, when zero - zero - Hey, I think we're going to be lucky - zero phase is going to go right through it. But there are dark - in other words, the Gamma, itself - is about the same size as the - as the -the full extension is about the same size as the crater Reiner. And then half of a crater diameter on the inside of that - and, of course, in the Gamma-type shape is a dark type material. Zero-phase is going right through it right now. By gosh, it didn't blot out the dark at all.
|140:23:46|CC|Got any Ñ any more thoughts about what it is?
|140:23:46|CMP|The--
|140:23:46|CC|Do the light-colored markings to the north look the same, Ron?
|140:23:46|CMP|You know, you get - you mean off toward the Marius Hills area?
|140:23:46|CC|Yes, that's right.
|140:23:46|CMP|There's a - the only light - yes, the only light-colored stuff that you can see - I don't see anything off towards the Marius Hills on the thing. You see it right around Reiner Gamma itself. And intermixed within that is that dark - it's a dark annulus, except the annulus is on the inside of the white. And it looks like - I don't know if your eyes deceive you in this darkness or not, but it sure looks the light-colored stuff is raised up with respect to the dark. In other words, the dark almost looks like the interior of a crater -crater rim, interior of a crater wall, you know - -
||||Tape 93B/17|Page 1118
|140:24:58|CC|Roger.
|140:24:58|CMP|- - with the light material around it. Now that's what it looks like in the - in the darkness. And then on the - let's see - southwestern rim of it, it almost looks like you've got a breach of the dark albedo stuff going out to the southeast corner of it in two spots. Okay, then the light stuff turns into - how do you put it - a darker swirly looking type stuff as you continue on west of Reiner Gamma. it crosses kind of a wrinkle ridge, I can see a wrinkle ridge down there, now. it crosses the wrinkle ridge with the no - no apparent change in albedo, anyhow, as it crosses the ridge.
|140:24:58|CC|Roger. Got you, and I think I've got the ridge on my map. I think we've got you.
|140:24:58|CMP|Okay.
|140:24:58|CC|Still - still think it might be a ray from one of those craters - -
|140:26:09|CMP|That's the last of the - you know, it's kind of associated with its own little thing. it doesn't look like it's a ray. it doesn't look like a ray, in other words, it doesn't thin out in different parts of it, like a ray does.
|140:26:09|CC|Okay.
|140:26:09|CMP|It looks like it was a lot thicker than - than a ray.
|140:26:09|CMP|Yes. Okay, this must be - what - Riccioli, I guess? The big crater? About -
|140:27:03|CMP|Now.
|140:27:03|CC|You're just coming up on Ricci - Grimaldi and you got to go through Hevelius, first of all, and then you get Into Grimaldi and Riccioli.
|140:27:03|CMP|Okay, that's Hevelius, then, is the one I'm passing right now. Hevelius is showing up real clear. You can see the slumping of the crater walls coming down there. it's a fairly old-type crater because you don't see any - any rays associated with it. Although the - the slumping is not completely degraded. There's a flat floor with a central peak on it. The central peak has the same albedo -it's a lighter albedo - no, the same albedo texture as the walls - as the west wall.
||||Tape 93B/18|Page 1119
|140:28:20|CMP|We're passing over a - well, generally a hilly type of terrain, and then just before we get into Grimaldi area, it looks like we're out into a plains-type material, again, interspersed with a hummocky-type. I guess that hummocky - is -hummocky stuff is associated with Grimaldi.
|140:28:20|CC|Roger. Looks like you're just passing a little bit to the west of Grimaldi now. You concur with that? About right over Riccioli?
|140:28:20|CMP|It doesn't look like Grimaldi to me - I guess it is, though.
|140:28:20|CC|Okay, Ron. You probably ought to think about - If it's getting kind of dark there for seeing or anything, you might consider getting in the P52, although you're a couple more minutes - still a couple minutes left on it. If you can see back at anything within Reiner Gamma - -
|140:28:20|CMP|Okay.
|140:28:20|CC|- - from this angle, it would be good; otherwise, if it's out, you ought to just consider the 52.
|140:29:48|CMP|Ah, she's pointing in the wrong direction.
|140:29:48|CC|Okay. That was some good stuff, Ron. Just don't hesitate to keep talking on that. We can sort it all out when we get down.
|140:29:48|CMP|Okay. Well, the bright - I'm looking out window I now. Must be out to the north I guess, and there's two very bright craters, in there, just crossing some rilles that run north and south. There's a little bit of a mare material out in there. I wish I knew what that crater was. Weil, I better get going on P52, I guess.

|140:29:48|CMP|{Humming - "Deck the Halls")
|140:34:17|CMP|Old heaters sure work on these optics. They're always nice and warm when you take them out.
|140:34:17|CC|Well, Roger. Understand you're changing the LOH -LiOH canister now.
|140:34:17|CMP|(Laughter) No, the optics.
|140:34:17|CC|Okay, good.
|140:34:17|CMP|Tele - yes - telescope. When you - you take the telescope out, it's got a heater on it in there and it keeps it nice and warm. Okay, CMC, FREE. Do a P52, option 3. Okay, then back to P20. Okay, this time we will not forget to go to AUTO.
|140:34:17|CMP|Okay, computer, find me a star. *** out there. Menkar. Okay, take me to Menkar. Oh!
|140:36:03|CMP|Looks like Menkar.
|140:37:06|CMP|Okay. Canopus. Canopus. Okay, take me to Canopus.
|140:37:06|CMP|And Canopus is as bright as all get out.
|140:37:06|CC|Just like the simulator, huh?
|140:37:06|CMP|*** bright that - brighter than any star we've ever had in the simulator. *** so bright it almost blanks out the crosshair. Got Saturn.
|140:37:06|CC|Yes, hope it's not Saturn, huh?
|140:37:06|CMP|(Laughter) Me, too.
|140:37:06|CC|Well, we'll know in a minute when we look at your NOUN 05-
|140:37:06|CMP|Oh, man, okay.
|140:37:06|CC|Nothing wrong with that one.
|140:37:06|CMP|That's pretty good.
||||Tape 93B/20|Page 1121
|140:37:06|CC|Yes. We'll buy that.
|140:37:06|CMP|Think that's a good one?
|140:37:06|CC|Okay, Ron, you can go ahead and torque.
|140:37:06|CMP|Okay. We'll torque at 19*
|140:37:06|CC|Good show, huh?
|140:37:06|CMP|Now my new - bet that's in there, isn't it - unit vectors of Saturn. Would that be in here, somewhere?
|140:37:06|CC|Say again, Ron?
|140:37:06|CMP|These unit vectors of SaturnÈ aren't they in my -planet unit vectors Ñ yes, stars - oh, here we go.
|140:39:57|CC|Okay, we just got a beautiful picture of the Earth from the - from the Rover. Just spectacular picture of the Earth.
|140:39:57|CMP|Oh, really?
|140:39:57|CC|Yes.
|140:39:57|CMP|Great.
|140:39:57|CC|Just beautiful. Old Fendell's been hunting for all night, but he finally found it. it's just beautiful.
|140:39:57|CMP|(Laughter)
|140:39:57|CC|Ron, we're 5 minutes from LOS here. Everything's looking great. Just - you have to finish off your checklist on that TM, P20 and CMC MODE back to AUTO. And then just a reminder on that LOH [sic] canister: if you'd go back and pick that up, we'd appreciate it.
|140:39:57|CMP|Okay, we'll get that one- I'm going to try and see if I can find Saturn here.
||||Tape 93B/21|Page 1122
|140:39:57|CC|Okay.
|140:39:57|CC|This VOX mode is just great. We're sitting here following what you're doing. You don't even have to talk to us. it's really great.
|140:39:57|CMP|(Laughter) I think it's great, too.
|140:39:57|CC|Your voice is so clear - - Oh, shucks. Now the fuel is - Ñ
|140:39:57|CC|You sound like you're in the next room.
|140:39:57|CMP|Oh, really? You know, that's funny because I really can't hear myself and the - you know, on the intercom.
|140:41:28|CC|You sound - you sound - -
|140:41:28|CMP|Well, I'll have to look ... - -
|140:41:28|CC|- - louder in my earphone than in the simulator, when you're down at the Cape, or over here across the way. You're just loud and clear, even better than down there.
|140:41:28|CMP|(Laughter) That's good. Well, it's beyond the field of view. So we'll have to catch it another time.
|140:41:28|CC|Yes, that's too bad.
|140:41:28|CC|We're going to pick you up at l44:10. I'll be losing you in a minute or so. And 144:10 has a good back side.
|140:41:28|CMP|Okay.
|140:41:28|CC|And you might check your ZPN settings when you -your sensors - when you get a chance on the back side here. They're still not giving much good data.
|140:41:28|CMP|Okay. Yes, it looks like I'll have a little time this time, so I'll do it.
||||Tape 93B/22|Page 1123
|140:41:28|CC|Roger. Just don't let them tear you away from the window, though.
|140:41:28|CMP|(Laught er) Okay.
|140:41:28|CC|And we've dumped the data from the last couple of back-side revs and you sound real good, Ron.
|140:42:50|CMP|Okay, hey, real fine. You know the guys at lunar surface don't even have any ZPN, you know. They left it up here.
|140:42:50|CC|Roger. {Laughter)
|140:42:50|CMP|I didn't even - I didn't know that until they left. Okay, the old LiOH canister, let's see - 13 into A, and 13 must be in A-9 then. (Humming)
|140:43:54|CMP|Oh, there's old 13. Take 14 out, so we - put ... in the bottom.
|140:43:54|CC|Hey, Ron. We just had a discussion here and your point is well taken, and why don't you just go ahead, if you want to, and take the ZPN sensors, the yellow plug ones, off and take them off for the evening, if you like.
|140:44:25|CMP|Hey, that sounds like an excellent idea. Thank you.
|140:45:09|CMP|Okay, we're 11 - out - picked nice small ones, I guess. None of them have been stuck so far.

|141:03:00|CC|Ron, this is your friendly inter - intervalometer speaking, can I help you?
|141:03:00|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. Let's see, we're about 159 -I'm going to take two more pictures on this frame, and finish it up on Lima Lima, huh? Off to the north. Maybe it's got 160, I'll keep it.
|141:34:12|CMP|Okay, Lima Lima is on l6l. I don't know how many's left. It says 160 on it, still going, but -
|141:34:24|CMP|Mike Mike is starting with number 1.
|141:34:24|CC|Mike Mike, number 1. Roger.
|141:34:24|CC|Ron, just for your information, we're not going to give you a TEI-49 pad or a state vector this pass. We're going to give it to you at the beginning of the next pass. We want to refine our data a little bit.
|141:34:24|CMP|Oh, okay. Hey, I found the intervalometer, stuck under the seat - between the web and the - the metal part. ... that.

|141:35:54|CMP|Okay. (Singing) Okeytedokeyte. Let's see now. ... 8, ... 50, ... 88 frames - take lots of pictures. Here's frame 160 on Lima Lima. And now configure camera. Okay, Peirce ... that ... and then mag QQ's standing by (whistling).
|141:38:48|CC|How'd the photos go, going right across Arabia there, on this last - little bit of go, Ron?
|141:38:48|CMP|Okay. Yes, those were good. You can - you can kind of see the topographic rise in the Saenger area especially, it's a little bit higher to the west of Saenger than to the east. But you can still see a general rise in that area.
|141:38:48|CC|Roger.
|141:38:48|CMP|You get a kind of a hint of the - the second ring of Arabia.
|141:38:48|CC|Real good, Ron. We need to get the battery A -terminate the charge on battery A.

|141:39:39|CMP|... of a time to lose my map.
|141:39:39|CMP|(Singing) There it is.
|141:39:39|CMP|Okay. This is on the pan camera photos. When you want to start looking at something, look for a small - Okay, just to the east of Abul Wafa, there's a small crater. About - oh, he must be about 2 to 400 meters in diameter. And he's got a black strip right on the western wall - going down - going down the western wall of the crater. It doesn't look like the strip extends beyond the rim at all; just down inside the crater wall. Also next to a - Now I forgot where I was.
|141:39:39|CC|What was that najne of that crater with the black wall there; where - where was it near again?
|141:39:39|CMP|Well, it's right near Abul Wafa on the first ring of Arabia.
||||Tape 94b/3|Page 1183
|141:39:39|CC|Okay.
|141:39:39|CMP|And I think that ought to be up in - should show up in the pan camera.
|141:39:39|CC|Okay, good. Good show. You notice the swirls right near Abul Wafa?
|141:41:58|CMP|Yes, I really saw them that time. And where the swirls, they really show up, are about a crater diameter from Firshov - crater diameter to the west. And I talked about it on the tape. But, basically they're kind of concentric swirls in that area with light and dark. And the contrast between the light and dark is - is something tremendous. The dark is not a mare dark - tan, but it comes real close to it.
|141:41:58|CC|Real good. Ron, you're coming up within a minute of this or a couple minutes of this orbital science photo of Peirce starting at - in the Sea of Cr -Crisium and going through Peirce in that area.
|141:41:58|CMP|Okay. Let's see that ought to be out window 3. We are going to stay f/8 all the way across with this one, huh?
|141:41:58|CC|Wo, it says f/8 at start. And then according to the Flight Plan, you change to f/5-6 and you'll change that at about Macrobius A. And then you'll go to 1/125 right at the Littrow area.
|141:43:31|CMP|Okay. ... do I want to jump to f/ll going across those highlands, huh? At - on the western edge of Crisium?
|141:43:31|CC|Well, see, f/8 - 1 shows f/8 on the map all the way across Crisium, starting at f/8 and using f/8 all the way across Crisium.
|141:43:31|CMP|Okay. Let's see there's Picard X, so we should start in here somewhere.
|141:43:31|CC|Yes, it's those rilles or whatever you call - rilles I guess, to the north of the Picard X is where you start.
||||Tape 94B/4|Page 1184
|141:43:31|CMP|Okay, me get a shot of those - oh, come on ... longer. Okay, we started it, ... then about 10 [?] time.
|141:44:54|CMP|Okay. There is absolutely no color variation on these flow fronts or scarps, or - By golly, flow fronts, looks to me like. Just looking north, right from the Picard X.
|141:44:54|CC|Roger. You'd call them flow fronts and -
|141:44:54|CMP|Well, flow front, or - or I've hardly even, it's -let me see they're bright on the high side, as you're looking north. You know, they're - they're bright on the high side. I would presume they kind of run east and west.
|141:44:54|CC|Roger. According to the map, they're just exactly east and west.
|141:44:54|CMP|~ - ... inside of them. Yes.
|141:44:54|CC|Your photo path goes directly between Peirce and Pease - Peirce Bravo. And then leads up toward Peirce Charlie just a little bit north of Peirce Charlie.
|141:44:54|CMP|Okay.
|141:46:21|CMP|Well, Peirce Charlie has really got some black lines going down, vertical down them.
|141:46:21|CC|You talking about inside the crater, black vertical lines inside the crater?
|141:46:21|CMP|Yes, inside the crater. And it also looks like it carries on across. As I get a little bit closer, I'll see if it carries on across or not. This can't be shadow. You can still see the darker ennuius around - Peirce. Peirce Bravo's also got a dark annulus around it. In Peirce Bravo has only - goes out to about a half a crater diameter, though.
|141:46:21|CC|Roger.
||||Tape 94B/5|Page 1185
|141:46:21|CMP|Well, you know Peirce Charlie looks like - the sides of the South Massif, almost. Look down in that. In other words, it is kind of highly eroded, elongate crater.
|141:46:21|CMP|... are all vertical; you know, I don't - I don't -vertical is the only way I know how to describe them. They point toward the - you know, radial -they point radial, but they all point toward the middle of the crater.
|141:46:21|CC|Roger.
|141:46:21|CMP|Does that make sense? (Laughter)
|141:46:21|CC|We will try to salve them out. Yes, that makes sense, Ron.
|141:46:21|CMP|Okay.
|141:46:21|CMP|Peirce Charlie was right In the middle of a little framelet there. South of Microbius, huh?
|141:46:21|CC|Yes, just a little bit south of Mic - Macrobius there. Lay it on the edge of it actually, and on the nor - southern edge of Macrobius.
|141:46:21|CMP|Okay.
|141:46:21|CC|As you get up ahead, between the contact line between the mare and the highlands at Macrobius Alfa, is where you'll change to 5*6.
|141:46:21|CMP|Okay.
|141:49:54|CMP|Hey, do we go north of Macrobius Alfa?
|141:49:54|CC|Boy, it looks like you just, yes, you're north of Macrobius Alfa. That's affirm. You're even just a little bit north of Macrobius Bravo.
|141:49:54|CMP|Yes, that's ... what I mean ... Macrobius 3ravo. Boy, it's a beautiful - between Macrobius 3ravo and Macrobius there is a beautiful - ray excluded -what you call it - butterfly! Little butterfly -about a 1000-meter crater.

|141:49:54|CC|Roger.
|141:49:54|CMP|Got him (laughter). 5-6.
|141:49:54|CMP|You know this - -
|141:49:54|CC|Okay, you ought to be changing 5-6.
|141:49:54|CMP|Okay. Let's see about 5 - Now here again is where Sun angle may make a little bit of difference on the thing. But this kind of a hummocky, well, close to sculptured-hill-type of material that we are flying over between Proclus and Macrobius A and B, doesn't look at all like the Sculptured Hills in the landing site area, next to - In other words, all along the edge of Crisium, or the edge of Serenitatis you have the sculptured-hills effect that have the vertical, dark lineations'in it. These vertical, radial or whatever you want to -lineations, striations, I guess, dark striations are not apparent under the western edge of Crisium at all. Where does this come out by the landing site? North of the landing site?
|141:52:16|CC|Roger. You're quite a bit north of the site. You are over Li - Littrow. In fact, you're north of Littrow.
|141:52:16|CMP|Over Littrow?
|141:52:16|CC|You're north of Littrow.
|141:52:16|CMP|Okay, we're to get the Littrow ...
|141:52:16|CC|Okay, when you cross into the mare on Serenity there, after Littrow, you want to change to 1/25.
|141:52:16|CMP|... 25; okay. So that'll be -
|141:54:26|CC|And, Ron, this is camera path ends at Bessel A -Bessel Alfa in the Sea of - in Serenity -Serenitatis.
|141:54:26|CMP|Okay. Okay, let's see, that's beyond the rilles out there. Let's see, it's quite a - in the midale isn't it - way out there. Okay.
||||Tape 94B/7|Page 1187
|141:54:26|CC|Yes, you cross those east-west - east-west running rilles there in Serenitatis and then get right up to the Bessel.
|141:54:26|CMP|Okay.
|141:54:26|CMP|Well, I don't think that scarp could be a flow front across there, but it sure does look like it. The thing that changes your mind about it being a flow front is that it goes up to North Massif. I couldn't see any real continuation. It looks like there's two possible continuations on a south side and the South Massif. I'll have to take another look at that the next time around.
|141:54:26|CC|Okay, HIGH GAIN to AUTO when you get a chance there, Ron. And you got to switch over for this terminator photo P29 Charlie on Sulpicius Gallus.
|141:54:26|CMP|Okay.
|141:57:18|CMP|Okay. Serenitatis Sulpicius Gallus, huh?
|141:57:18|CC|Roger. You get - -
|141:57:18|CMP|Two of 500.
|141:57:18|CC|And then f/ll on the mountains right behind, right to the west of Sulpicius Gallus. That's using a 250-millimeter.
|141:57:18|CMP|Okay. These are 250 m - 250, f/22. Okay, and it's mag Quebec Quebec, starting at 79-
|141:57:18|CC|Got it, starting at 79- Roger.
|141:57:18|CMP|Got six and one - yes, which window was the -
|141:57:18|CC|I don't have my friendly helper here or I could give it to you.
|141:57:18|CMP|There's the ones that's going to be ... (laughter).
|141:57:18|CC|CM-5 is what we think.
|141:57:18|CMP|... seeing it out of window 3.
||||Tape 94B/8|Page 1188
|141:57:18|CC|Try CM-5, Ron.
|141:57:18|CMP|And - Yes, that CM-5 is ... Okay, about six of them around Sulpicius Gallus there. There's 22 to 500.
|141:57:18|CC|Okay. Get those Haemus Mountains right to the west of Sulpicius Gallus.
|141:57:18|CMP|Yes.
|141:57:18|CC|Then, you get D-Caldera.
|141:57:18|CMP|Okay. Hope I can find it this time again (laughter) Wouldn't that be a heck of a note?
|141:57:18|CC|You better believe it.
|141:59:32|CMP|Try to take a picture of it and couldn't find it (laughter). Okay. Let's see, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Okay, next one is 11.
|141:59:32|CC|Okay. On D-Caldera, you want to go, f/8 at 1/250.
|141:59:32|CMP|Okay. Let me get some of these mare. Still got to get the Haemus Mountains there.
|141:59:32|CC|Okay.
|141:59:32|CMP|And got to get some of the - Okay, D-Caldera. 250th, huh?
|141:59:32|CC|Yes, 1/250 f/8, f/8, 1/250 on D-Caldera.
|142:01:31|CMP|Okay. I found it.
|142:01:31|CMP|Okay. What's the next one?
|142:01:31|CC|Okay. I don't even know what the name of it is. It's just immediately up that hill and rille there, just immediately to the west of D-Caldera.
|142:01:31|CMP|Okay.
|142:01:31|CC|Looks like it would be right at the terminator.

|142:01:31|CC|Ron, when - soon as you're done with the photos, you might check the laser altimeter. We - it went belly up during this photo pass - just absolutely quit like you had shut it off with your toe or something.
|142:01:31|CMP|Thank you. Okay. It is off, as a matter of fact. Shall I turn it on now?
|142:01:31|CC|Why don't you turn it on so we'll get a check here, and then it'll be coming off in a second. Think you got it with a toe or something?
|142:03:32|CMP|Okay. It's ON. I must have.
|142:03:32|CC|Okay. It's working good, too.
|142:03:32|CMP|I wonder if I ever turned - I wonder if I ever turned it on?
|142:03:32|CC|Wo, it was - it was on and running, Ron. And then all of a sudden, about 5 minutes ago, we got just a complete belly up; no power to it at all.
|142:03:32|CMP|Oh. Well, I'll tell you, I've (chuckle) worn the toes through in my underwear here, so you do a lot of rolling around (chuckle). Let's see - let's recapitulate here. In mag QQ, we're on frame 104.
|142:03:32|CMP|I'm not sure where it was when we started on that one.
|142:03:32|CC|I think you gave me a call at 79> didn't you?
|142:03:32|CMP|I didn't write it down (chuckle).
|142:03:32|CC|That's all right. You - We've gotten all your calls. I think Tommy can pick that one up.
|142:03:32|CMP|Oh, okay.
|142:03:32|CC|Tommy's shaking his head that he's got it all squared away. So, if the bookkeeper's right, we're right.
|142:03:32|CMP|Oh, okay (laughter).
||||Tape 94B/10|Page 1190
|142:03:32|CC|And you can go ahead and start down that line now. We've seen the laser altimeter enough, I think.
|142:05:32|CMP|Okay. I have the camera OFF. Yes, it's dark down there. I'm not getting any more pictures. Okay.
|142:05:46|CMP|MAPPING CAMERA to OFF. Wait 30 seconds, it says. Okay. Rolling them up.
|142:05:46|CC|Okay. You've got MAPPING CAMERA to STANDBY and IMAGE MOTION, OFF.
|142:06:39|CMP|Okay. MAPPING CAMERA to STANDBY. OFF, barberpole, gray. LASER ALTIMETER, OFF. Okay. We've already in CMC FREE, and we're rolling left.
|142:06:39|CC|Roger. Ron, IIJCO just asked me to remind you that those high gain angles that you see in this block here are strictly if we lose lock here during the manuever. That's the reacquire angle.
|142:06:39|CMP|Okay. That's after we get the attitude. Okay.
|142:06:39|CC|Watching your buddies on the screen down here right now, and they've, believe me, they've got more black showing than they do white right now -of those suits. They've really been down among them.
|142:06:39|CMP|They out to the Scarp yet?
|142:06:39|CC|Yes, they're - Let me ask Bob here.
|142:06:39|CMP|At the edge of the mountain? Have they - -
|142:06:39|CC|They've gone up and down the Sc arp. Wh -
|142:06:39|CMP|Okay. They've gone all the way past Station 2 and then they're going to Station 4, huh?
|142:06:39|CC|Roger. Let's see, they're - they're at Station 3 right now, matter of fact. That's where they were showing them on TV. They've been up the Massif and up to Station 2, and now they're back down to Station 3.
||||Tape 94B/11|Page 1191
|142:08:42|CMP|Okay, Mike Mike is at 95- I don't know if I ever told you that or not. I think I always get more pictures than I'm supposed to.
|142:08:42|CC|We decided that what you're doing is trying to use up all the crew options before Jack gets up there.
|142:08:42|CMP|(Laughter) You guessed it!
|142:08:42|CMP|HeyÈ yes, which reminds me, if - you know, you get to a point where we've got one of these mags that doesn't have enough for a complete set, you know we could make those options on the end of a - a reel and use Papa Papa, there.
|142:08:42|CC|Roger. That's - that's affirmative.
|142:08:42|CC|Ron, I got to ask this - During the last eat period, did you leave the Hasselblad running without a mag in it, just to pull our chain?
|142:08:42|CMP|(Laughter) No, honest I didn't; I really didn't. You heard something clicking all the time, huh?
|142:08:42|CC|Roger. It's very periodic, just like it was on the intervalometer and it sounded just like - just like the Hasselblad sounded this last time. Just exactly like it.
|142:08:42|CC|Tommy was just pulling his hair out over there.
|142:08:42|CMP|Did - have I used up any more film on some of these than I should have?
|142:11:08|CC|No, we haven't caught any, anomalies in the film usage.
|142:11:08|CMP|(Humming: "Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf")
|142:11:08|CMP|ã.. 32; roll attitude.
|142:14:39|CMP|You know, I just noticed something that I didn't know before.
|142:14:39|CC|What's that ?
||||Tape 94B/12|Page 1192
|142:14:39|CMP|That is that the - when you manuever, you know, in a simulator, it's Just like the eye-view ball. You know, it's nice, smooth transition, you know. You look at the GDC ball and it goes, it kind of takes a jump in pitch and then a jump in yaw; a jump in pitch and then a jump in yaw. You put it on ball 2 ... ball 1 and it all does the same thing.
|142:14:39|CC|Roger.
|142:14:39|CMP|Yes, it does the same thing. That's just the way the GDC operates I guess.
|142:14:39|CMP|Yes, not the - not the ball, it's just the GDC.
|142:14:39|CC|Roger. The G&C is - just said that's a nominal.
|142:14:39|CMP|Well, I'm sure it is, but, you know, I just didn't even know it. Because I hadn't noticed it before, I guess, either.
|142:18:55|CC|Ron, while you're sitting there watching this manuever to completion, I've got some read-up from the orbital science report for the CMP if you would like to hear it?
|142:18:55|CMP|Yes, I sure would. Go ahead.
|142:18:55|CC|Okay. Let's talk about the UV. The far UV spectrometer data has been excellent throughout the mission. Indications are that the hydrogen atmosphere of the Moon is much less than expected. The Aerobee launched from White Sands on Monday failed to get solar UV calibration because an instrument viewing port failed to open. A second Aerobee flight is scheduled for tomorrow. The IR scanning radiometer is performing beautifully. Indications are that the subsolar point surface temperatures are higher than Earth-based observations predicted. Many thermal anomalies are being seen in the Ocean Procellarum area west of Copernicus. A few unusual cold spots have also been detected indicating areas of fine soil with few and no blocks. The lunar sounder data is excellent and the specular power monitor signals correlate with surface features; HF data indicates that layers are being detected in the mare areas. Over.

|142:20:14|CC|Roger. And don't worry about that short period of time the laser altimeter was off; it shouldn't affect anything.
|142:20:14|CMP|Okay.
|142:20:14|CC|And anytime you can reach over there, Ron, it's H2, tank 2 FANs to ON for the night.

|142:25:43|CMP|Okay. You know, it doesn't shake, rattle, and roll as much since we got rid of that tin can. But it still does a little bit, you know, you get a - it is a little more dynamic than I had thought it would be.
|142:25:43|CC|We'd like ACCEPT, we've got a jet-on monitor load for you, Ron.

|142:31:35|CC|Ron, Jaime wanted me to mention the fact that she got a couple of A's on some tests today, and she's real tickled and knew you'd be happy to hear that.
|142:31:35|CMP|Hey, you bet, by golly! That's great!
|142:31:35|CC|Ron, we are probably going to lose you a little early on this half5 and we may pick you up a little late at the start of the next half, unless you were to try and acquire us manually, or something like that. If you go via the Flight Plan, which is really what we want, we will be coming in a little bit later than is shown. If you have to talk to us or anything like that, you can acquire manually, and we'll be right there.
|142:38:21|CMP|Manually, yes. Okay. I was just looking at the Earth out of window 3 here. Boy, that's beautiful! I have an earthset pretty quick.

|157:48:16|CC|But we've got one blessing. It's not raining outside.

You know, I'm almost to the western edge of Crisium, looking back across there, and even from this distance, you can still see the - the color boundary between the two and as far - It goes up north by Posidonius, and then it kind of blends in and it will look - as far as I can tell anyhow. Going from Posidonius on around to the north side of Serenitatis. Of course, it's a long ways away, and I really can't see, but I couldn't tell a definite demarcation. It just kind of blended in from the tan to - to the dark tan.

|158:03:29|CC|Just of interest to you, Ron. We are really pleased with the way that our visual display and that worked out last night during the orbital science visual. Farouk was able to feed me the questions, and I was able to get them to you. If you have any comments one way or another, if you don't want us to do it on rev 40 or not, let us know. We plan right now on rev 40 for those orbital science visuals to do the same thing going - It's the visuals through landing site down through D-Caldera, and we're going to run the same operation, since it went so smoothly down here. We hope it went that way for you up there.
|158:03:29|CMP|It sure did. As a matter of fact, I like it very much. That kind of clues me on what to look for as you're going through, because you see so many things down there - that you - that you kind of -Frankly, I have a tendency to forget what the main thing that you're trying to look for is.
|158:04:27|CC|Good show. We're prepared to do it on this next rev, and I guess you might say even though it isn't that way in the Flight Plan, we'll probably just stand by right straight through on rev 40 where you - you pick up at the landing site and go right through D-Caldera. We'll be just standing by for that whole rev - that rev - whole piece - about 12 minutes, or so.

|163:13:46|CC|How you doing up there, Ron?
|163:13:46|CMP|Okay; real fine. I just saw a - part of these rilles - type things, and it's got a light-brown - well, dark-brown - it's almost a mare-type coloring - heading in the southeast-northwest direction. And it's down from - oh, yes, there's Saenger, east of Saenger yet. Let me find it on my map.
|163:15:12|CC|Down east of Saenger there, you get into the first ring of Arabia or the second ring of Arabia there.
|163:15:26|CMP|Yes. Hey, you know this is - Let me get this picture. This is the first time I've really been able to see that first ring of Arabia.
|163:15:26|CC|You think - think you see it, huh?
|163:15:26|CMP|And it shows up as - Yes. It - I'll take two of them. First, I'd better get the dark slide out. The way the Sun is shining on the darn thing, and it shows up as a bright - I'll be darned! That's amazing! it shows up as a bright ring, just like we got it drawn on the map. You know, you - you get a brighter albedo all the way around to the top of the ring. That was frame 120 through -or 122 through 124 on mag Oscar Oscar.
|163:16:35|CC|Okay, Ron, we've got a - a Flight Plan update and a lunar sounder pad, if you want to take it before we get into the visuals here.
||||Tape 108B/4|Page 1514
|163:16:35|CMP|Okay, I better I guess.
|163:17:51|CMP|Okay. Frames - last three frames before 128 were also looking east. Okay, we had an update, huh?
|163:17:51|CC|Lunar sounder pad is at 166:40 on the Flight Plan. Let's do that one first, okay?
|163:17:51|CMP|Okay.
|163:18:19|CC|OkayÇ T-start time, 166:42:12; T-stop time, 47:10-
|163:18:19|CMP|Okay. T-start, 166:42:12, and T-stop is 47:10.
|163:18:19|CC|Good copy. I've got the lunar sounding - grazing attitude VERB 49 at 167:28.
|163:18:19|CMP|7:28, okay.
|163:18:19|CC|We're tweaking up that attitude a little bit; it's 283, 063, and 328. Over.
|163:18:19|CMP|(Laughter) That's really tweaking it up. 283, 063, and 328.
|163:18:19|CC|Roger. And over there at 167:55 where it's - the antenna retract bit?
|163:18:19|CMP|Yes; right.
|163:18:19|CC|Okay. It's pretty obvious we want to take "HF antenna 2, retract" and move it above "HF antenna 1." We'll call for the retract - make sure we're ready, and we'll also cue it on our cue, Ron. What we want to do is look at HF antenna 2 retract all the way, get the times, et cetera, and then we'll go ahead and retract HF antenna 1.
|163:18:19|CMP|Oh, okay. Sounds reasonable.
|163:20:11|CC|Oksy, Ron, we're all just standing by. That takes care of the Flight Plan updates, and we're just standing by for your visuals. This pass you're to concentrate on the landing site and the D-Caldera, you know?
||||Tape 108B/5|Page 1515
|163:20:11|CMP|? Okay.
|163:20:39|CC|Ron, we want to concentrate on the small-scale features, and your binoculars may be what you need. We want to look at the dark-halo craters in the site area and examination of D-Caldera with the binocs.
|163:20:39|CMP|Okay. That sounds like a good idea. We'll see what we can - (Laughter) That's crazy. I go over in inertial attitude, and every time I look out the window, I've got to look in a different direction.
|163:20:39|CC|Roger; we understand.
|163:20:39|CMP|(Laughter) it's funny.
|163:22:14|CC|Hey, Ron, when you come up on the landing site, we would like you to concentrate on Shorty Crater and F Crater and then the other dark-halo craters. As you know, as I told you last night, Shorty ended up with some orange-colored material that looks an awful lot like a fuma - fumara - event anyway - fumarole. And it looks - -
|163:22:14|CMP|Fumarole.
|163:22:14|CC|- - an awful lot - Yes, okay (laughter). Looks an awful lot like it and what we' re trying to do is see what you see from there, and that may give us some correlation on some of these other ones.
|163:22:49|CMP|Okay. I got to take a look and see which one's Shorty.
|163:22:49|CC|Ron, it's the dark crater on the slide, the dark crater on the slide.
|163:23:13|CMP|Oh, okay.

|161:53:33|CDR-EVA|Okay, here we are 1.5 and 185.
|161:53:37|CC|Okay, copy that.
|161:53:39|LMP-EVA|Okay, is this a Rover sample?
|161:53:13|CDR-EVA|
||||Tape 109B/1|Page 1567
|163:24:12|CC|Roger.
|163:24:12|CMP|Because what that - little diamond turned out to be with the binocs - it's a dome of material in there, and the reason it looks like a diamond is because you have slide material or talus-type stuff that's slumped down around it. And in that dome-type material, there are three or four black spots in it. I call it black; they're really a - I con -I kind of consider it a greenish - greenish black, you know?
|163:24:12|CC|Roger.
|163:24:12|CMP|I sure hope we - If - Why don't you check with Farouk and see if our pan camera coverage covers that - that crater? I think it probably did. That's an interesting one to take a look at anyhow.
|163:30:12|CC|Ron, Farouk thinks it is on the pan.
|163:30:12|CMP|Very good.
|163:31:02|CMP|You know, in the eastern wall of Picard - I'm looking at it with the binocs now, and you can definitely see the first part of it up there has some vertical enscarpments [sic] - escarpments along the edge of it. And the vertical escarpments are kind of in irregular layers - well, just kind of like you would suspect if you - you eroded out a bunch of lava layers. In other words, they're noncontinuous, but they're kind of intermingled along, and they go about - oh, a third of the way down from the top of the rim, down to where the talus starts sliding on into the - into the crater.
||||Tape 109B/2|Page 1568
|163:31:56|CC|Good show. We'll tie that - tie that up with what you gave us last time on Picard.
|163:31:56|CMP|Okay.
|163:31:56|CMP|All these dark-halo craters in the - in that one picture by that little diamond we've got up there by Yerkes. The one that's farthest to the south looks like an impact type of crater. In other words, you've got a definite ejecta lopping out around on those. The one that's hard to look at in the middle of my picture, but I think it's probably the second one down from the top. It has rounded ridges - rounded rims, and - coming up on the side here - I don't know if I am going to be able to see it until I go by it. It has rounded - a rounded rim. The ejecta pattern or the dark halo is about twice the size of the ... one crater diameter. And it doesn't - it's - it's either a highly eroded impact-type crater, or it's a volcanic-type structure. And, to me, it doesn't look like a highly eroded impact one. Again, that's a little one we can probably pick up ground truth, so to speak, off of the pan camera film.
|163:35:38|CC|Ron, are there any similarity between the highlands, west of Crisium and those east of Serenitatis?
|163:35:38|CMP|You know, I loo - that's just what I was looking at. And the ones east of - west of - well - yes, east of Crisium and west of - No.
|163:35:38|CC|West of Crisium - -
|163:35:38|CMP|What I was looking at was the - -
|163:35:38|CC|- - and east of Serenitatis.
|163:35:38|CMP|Yes, west of Crisium and east of Serenitatis. Those are different - seem to be a different type of islands, and I want - I want to check the other ones when I go by, but it looked like when I was coming up on - on those west of Crisium, they're more of a tan-type colors, smaller - undulations smaller - They have a corn-cob effect, I guess is what you'd call it - what I call it anyhow. Smaller - smaller ears of corn or smaller mounds closer together as - as opposed to, when you get over to the landing site - The ones on the landing site seem to be more - raised, I guess. In other words, you still have a - a group of the small mounds and what have you, but they're a little more massive; you get more of an appearance of a dark flow - or a dark albedo between the mounds and between the blimps.
||||Tape 109B/3|Page 1569
|163:35:38|CC|Roger. Good show.
|163:35:38|CC|Are you getting the landing site into view now?
|163:37:34|CMP|I got it in window 2.
|163:37:51|CMP|Okay. I've got Shorty in the - picture. It looks like a sharper crater than any of them in the Pentagon complex. The other thing that looks sharp, just like that one, is F Crater.
|163:38:48|CMP|... back to the other window.
|163:38:48|CMP|Did they kind of find that orange stuff on the north side of it?
|163:38:48|CC|Let me check on that, Ron. I'll be back with you in a second. I don't think so; their stop was at -Station 4 was on - -
|163:38:48|CMP|... I'll get ...
|163:38:48|CC|Station 4 was on the south side of it.
|163:38:48|CC|Just go ahead with what you see and - -
|163:38:48|CMP|I'd say they just barely got into the stuff, then, becau - But it - but it looks like - kind of the north rim of it has more of a - a tint of a different color to it.
|163:38:48|CMP|I ... my pictures.
|163:38:48|CC|Is the color differentiation concentric around the -the crater or is it just in - in splotches?
||||Tape 109B/4|Page 1570
|163:38:48|CMP|No. It's just in the - kind of the north side of it.
|163:38:48|CC|What would you say the color is then? is it one of the different tans?
|163:38:48|CMP|Yes, the color - (chuckle) Yes, it's a kind of a different - Would you believe kind of an orangish -tan through this - mic - through these binocs? I got to take another look at that when I go by the next time.
|163:38:48|CC|Roger. I'm with you.
|163:38:48|CC|Ron, when you get back - when you get done with this, we'd like you to sketch - when you get a chance, the color variations - just some thoughts on where the color splotches are with respect to Shorty, in particular.
|163:38:48|CMP|Okay. The - I'll do that when I finish up here.
|163:38:48|CC|Roger. Did you get a chance to look at F Crater?
|163:41:50|CMP|Yes, F Crater is - is sharp - just like - Shorty. I hope I was getting F Crater. F Crater is about the same size as Shorty, isn't it? If not, I was getting one between Family Mountain and -
|163:41:50|CC|Just about the same size, Ron. Maybe just a tad bigger.
|163:41:50|CMP|Yes.
|163:41:50|CC|Ron, is there a cone associated with F Crater?
|163:41:50|CMP|I didn't get a chance to look at it that much. I'll have to check it the next time.
|163:41:50|CC|Okay. Have any thoughts on how - what's its origin?
|163:43:02|CMP|I'll have to look at F Crater again the next time I come over on the thing, because I spent most of the time looking at - Shorty.
|163:43:02|CC|Okay.
||||Tape 109B/5|Page 1571
|163:43:14|CMP|You Know -
|163:43:32|CMP|This - this formation again from - Tacquet on down to Menelaus or Melinor [sic]. Just went over that again, and I was looking at it with the binoculars, and I saw one sharp crater in the area that had a -an ejecta - almost the same color as the stuff around Shorty.
|163:44:16|CC|Roger, Ron. You may point - pinpoint that crater between Tacquet and Menelaus when you ... down here.
|163:44:16|CMP|Okay.
|163:44:16|CMP|Boy, oh boy, D-Caldera is going to be - between all the windows.
|163:44:16|CC|You have any flow scarps in that unit - near that Menelaus Crater?
|163:44:16|CMP|No. I'll tell you what. There aren't any scarps there at all. That's why - That's another thing I was looking for, it's just a gradual degradation or gradual change in the color.
|163:44:16|CC|You have any topography changes with respect to that color?
|163:44:16|CMP|Yes, but the - the - No, the topography change is just a gradual - gradual change - with - There's a mound - There it is. I got to switch to all the windows.
|163:44:16|CC|Are - are you able to get up on the D-Caldera?
|163:46:07|CMP|Yes, I got D-Caldera into my sights now. The mound - ... In the center - are the same type of material - same type of material as that surrounding the D-Caldera itself. Down in the caldera, the gray blocky-type of stuff - and you know what? I'd almost say that - You know how water drops kind of form on a - on a - on a surface as you - as you - Have you ever had a high spot and something kind of slowed up - up to it, high spot - and water kind of flowed up to and didn't quite stick to it - you know it doesn't stick to it, all in one spot - -
||||Tape 109B/6|Page 1572
|163:46:07|CC|Roger.
|163:46:07|CMP|- - but it would leave a - a depression due to a surface tension as you come on up there - and then you have kind of a little - little bubbles that -float across there, and that's what that looks like to me.
|163:46:07|CC|Roger. We copy that. Keep - keep going; that sounds great.
|163:46:07|CC|How about the dark-halo crater west of the D-Caldera?
|163:47:59|CMP|Hey, I'm finding out with - with the binocs, your observation is - is cut in about a half, and I'm going to have to get that the next time over.
|163:47:59|CC|Roger. You think the dark halo crater is any relationship to those marelike patches in D-Caldera itself?
|163:47:59|CMP|No, I don't think so. Just a - because the color differences are - or the color is completely different. So that - that's what - that's an open question on that one, and I'll have to find out the next time around.
|163:47:59|CC|Any thoughts about the light-colored annulus around D-Caldera.
|163:47:59|CMP|No. I couldn't see a light-colored annulus.
|163:47:59|CC|Okay. Hey, we need a RECORDER, ON, here on the lunar sounder.
|163:49:16|CMP|Oh, okay. Let's see. RECORDER is - The RECORDER is ON.
|163:49:16|CC|Okay, Ron, let me read you some questions here real quick on D-Caldera. Determine the color difference between D-shaped expression and it's surroundings. I think you pointed some of that out. You got any more comments on that?
||||Tape 109B/7|Page 1573
|163:49:16|CMP|Okay. There is nothing - surrounding D-Caldera that looks anything like the - the silver - silver-gray meterial that has depressed. It's definitely depressed with - with respect to the surrounding terrain. The little burnps that are in D-Caldera are the same color and the same - smoothness -kind of - smoothness as the rest of the material -the mare material surrounding the area.
|163:49:16|CC|Okay.
|163:50:17|CMP|I could not detect the - an external annulus around the caldera itself.
|163:50:17|CC|Okay. Do - do you. feel that any of the material on the caldera is related to the material in the immediate vicinity?
|163:50:17|CMP|The smooth-looking - let me get my picture - the smooth-looking - burnps in there are definitely -doesn't look to me like they're the same material as the stuff in the whole area.
|163:50:17|CC|Okay.
|163:50:17|CMP|They're smooth - tannish.
|163:50:17|CMP|You know, if I look at that picture, the dark-colored stuff looks to me like it's a depression, you know? And it's - and it's the other way around. The light -light - the light-colored light-albedo stuff in the picture is the part that's depressed and the darker portions that look like the - the material surrounding the area is the part that's raised up.
|163:50:17|CC|Roger. We copy that. ... on D-Caldera, do you have any view of any more of this terrain below you, or are your windows pretty well messed up?
|163:52:17|CMP|It just got dark.
|163:52:17|CC|Okay.
|163:52:17|CMP|Yes, I - I stopped talking joist about the time we got to the terminator.
||||Tape 109B/8|Page 1574
|163:52:17|CC|Okay. Good show.
|163:52:17|CMP|Let me - let me go back to a map and make sure I was talking about F Crater.
|163:53:03|CC|Ron, I think if you put an order of priority on some activity, as far as the geology goes, you might consider sketching out on Shorty - with just a rough handle on where you thought you saw some of the coloring differentiation up on the northern side of Shorty - and also give some thought on F Crater, if you will. I know you didn't get a chance to look at it because - If we can tie up the -what you see from orbit on Shorty to what we know we've got from the ground truth, we might really have something here, as far as matching up on some of these other craters.
|163:53:03|CMP|Uh huh; that1s a good point.
|163:54:04|CMP|Guess I can change the DAP here and get that out of the way.
|163:55:04|CMP|Well, let's see, just kind of fouled that one up. Really wanted l42, narrow dead band, don't you, at 142, 269, and 0 - and 359? Thought we were already in that attitude.
|163:55:04|CC|Ron, you might want to trim your attitude that -you were not to go to that VERB 49. That was the deleted at one thir - at 166:36. That VERB 49 was deleted, and your attitude is back to the -142, 269, and 359, and you might want to trim that up.
|163:55:04|CMP|Okay. Just did it. Thank you, Bob. I'd have done it by myself if I hadn't ^one to CMC FREE, but I'd forgotten we were already in that attitude.
|163:55:04|CC|Roger. No sweat here; you got a minute ir so before we're in the lunar sounder attitude for the Marius Hills there.
|163:55:04|CMP|Okay; 166:42. i
||||Tape 109B/9|Page 1575
|163:58:16|CC|And, Ron, you may be interested that, after we got the lunar sounder unsaturated there with the different attitude, we - we could detect the SEP in the lunar sounder data.
|163:58:16|CMP|Oh, very good. Kind of proves it's working anyhow.
|163:58:16|CC|Yes, that's for sure. Everybody seems to be pretty tickled with what they're getting so far. Just hope the film comes out as well.
|163:58:16|CMP|Oh, I'm sure it will. People out at Goodyear out there at Litchfield Park do a good job.
|164:01:39|CC|Ron, we got 30 seconds to T-start.
|164:01:39|CMP|Oh, thank you.
|164:01:50|CMP|OPERATE; she started at 42:12. Okay. RECORDER'S ON; RADAR is ON. Go to work.
|164:01:50|CMP|9 - -
|164:02:12|CC|MARK.
|164:02:12|CMP|- - 10, 11, go. Hey, it worked out fine (chuckle). Must have hit it 3 seconds early.
|164:02:12|CC|Roger. I still haven't figured out how to time this thing, I guess.
|164:02:12|CMP|(Laughter) No, that was good. I got the mark the same time I did it.
|164:02:12|CC|Okay, and you can relax, Ron, and I'll give you a call at 40 - about 30 seconds prior to 47:10, so you don't have to sit there and watch for anything.
|164:02:12|CC|Okay, I'll -
|164:02:12|CC|Got to earn my pay down here somehow.
|164:02:12|CMP|(Laughter) Boy, you already have, I'll tell you.
|164:06:37|CC|Okay, Ron. We're about 30 seconds from T - from LUNAR SOUNDER STANDBY time.
||||Tape 109B/10|Page 1576
|164:06:37|CMP|Okay; 7:10, OPERATE to STANDBY.
|164:07:06|CC|5 seconds.
|164:07:09|CC|MARK.
|164:07:14|CMP|Got it.
|164:08:10|CC|Okay. There's your 1 minute, Ron.
|164:08:16|CMP|Okay. RECORDER is going OFF, not to HEATERs.
|164:08:16|CC|Roger. Good show, Ron. Farouk just came out and said a real good show. He's real excited about what you saw there, and we're real, pleased with it.
|164:08:16|CMP|Okay. I think I said north and as I look at the map -the orange distribution goes generally about a - a crater diameter to the north, but it essentially starts - Well, if you'd cut a - on a 60-degree angle - from Dog Sierra at 63 - cut a 60-degree angle there and then - and then make that go around -out about a crater diameter.
|164:08:16|CC|Okay. To the north at Dog Sierra at 63?
|164:08:16|CMP|Yes, Dog Sierra at 63; that's on the 400-meter scale there.
|164:08:16|CC|Yes, I've got it.
|164:09:50|CMP|On TL-50. And, at the right-hand side - if you're looking at the thing from the bottom, the right-hand side is 0 - go up 60 degrees. You're 60 degrees up from the horizontal and 30 degrees down from the vertical. It'll be something about like that.
|164:09:50|CC|Okay.
|164:09:50|CMP|It had kind of a brownish-orange tint to it.
|164:11:57|CC|Ron, I guess one of the things that at least t;oes through Stu's and my mind on that Shorty Crater -and I think you dispelled it when you say it goes out like in a 60-degree angular cone away from it. But the question we'd really like to be thinking about - is that a concentric coloring around there, like it might be just a layering from a flap ov -you know, a turned-over flap or something like that, or whether it just seems to be some sort of a - I don't want to say flow, but something that would give it direction that one - the one 60-degree direction like that.
||||Tape 109B/11|Page 1577
|164:11:57|CMP|Yes, I see what you're saying. And - it all -almost looked to me like it was gradational, as you, -as you went away from the crater. In other words, more - more orangish - more orangish closer - closer to the crater than as you got away from it.
|164:13:05|CC|Okay. We're - we're ending up looking at future passes, not today probably, but for the future and see if we can fit in one or two more observations to you here, where we can set up the back room like we had in all the - if you'll go along with that, and if we can fit it in, would you like to do that?
|164:13:05|CMP|Oh, sure. The crater that I described as looking comparable to Shorty, I don't think is the one on Family Mountain. I think it's the one on - bright dot - about the same size dot as Shorty on the 17-1 leadln for the - 17-1 for the landmark tracking.
|164:13:05|CC|Okay.
|164:14:15|CMP|I think Family Mountain is the bigger of the two mounds to the west of the landing site, isn't it?
|164:14:15|CC|Stand by a minute, Ron. Let me clarify that. Roger, it's west of the landing site, and I believe it's the bigger of the two.
|164:14:15|CMP|Yes. Okay. The one that I said-that looked like Shorty is kind of between the two mounds, and that1 s the one I looked at.
|164:14:15|CC|You say it looked like Shorty or looked like the other one?
|164:14:15|CMP|- - ... a little bit.
||||Tape 109B/12|Page 1578
|164:14:15|CC|F Crater or Shorty?
|164:14:15|CMP|Looked - looked like Shorty.
|164:14:15|CC|Okay.
|164:14:15|CC|Ron, we'd like the TANKs and 3 FANs to ON, please.
|164:15:48|CMP|Okay, H2 TANK 2 FAN is ON now; TANK 3 FAN is ON.
|164:15:48|CC|Roger. Thank you.
|164:16:53|CC|Ron, I just might draw your attention to the Flight Plan at 167:20, in that area where the lunar sounder finishes up, and it says that there will be no SIM bay or PCM data recorded until 169:03 and then you have to configure the DSE there. Just want to draw your attention to that.
|164:16:53|CC|Okay. That's a good point.
|164:17:33|CMP|Hey, when you all drew that 60-degree angle, were you making that 63 degrees up from - not 60 -60 degrees up from line 63?
|164:17:33|CC|Yes. I - I didn't know how to handle on 63, but I took a point at Dog Sierra and 63 and kind of -caught - created a 60-degree cone away from the crater at that point.
|164:17:33|CMP|No, you want to create a semicircle. That's the center of the sem - Well, let's see. With the flat half of the semicircle along the line that goes through Dog Sierra 63 and Dog Whisky 57.
|164:17:33|CC|Dog Whisky 57? Roger.
|164:17:33|CMP|Right.
|164:17:33|CC|Okay. I've connected a line - -
|164:17:33|CMP|Connect a semicircle to the right of that line.
|164:17:33|CC|Okay. To the right of that line or - to the north side of that line?
|164:17:33|CMP|Yes. Actually, it will be kind of to the northeast, but to the north side of it, yes.

|164:22:03|CC|Ron, we're going to lose you shortly, and all the systems look GO here. I've got a bet with EEC0M that you'll get everything in the Flight Plan. You won't miss anything for me.
|164:22:03|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. We'll try. Hey, before I go, take a look at Crisium and Serenitatis, 3 of 5; and the second one down from the top - or second one from the north, is the one I was looking at as that - is described as - as a partially subdued and - I mean a rounded-type thing with - with the kind of breaches in the side of the wall - what I consider breaches in the side of the wall.
|164:22:03|CC|Okay. We got it. Crisium, 3 of 5, second one from the north, huh?
|164:22:47|CMP|Yes. And the other one's not even circled; it's just north of the - the one in the bottom, and that's the one that even shows up on here and the -impact-type, because it's got ray - ray material, but it's a fresh impact bringing up bluish -bluish-type material.
|164:22:47|CC|Okay. Good show. You're - you're saying that the two of them are distinctly different from - when you're viewing. One's impact and one is possibly volcanic ...
|164:22:47|CMP|Yes. Right.
|164:23:20|CC|Good show.

|229:45:25|CMP|Hey, America - Houston, this is America. We've got you loud and clear. A little late on picking you up that time, but worked okay. Okay, on mag Q, Quebec - it's finished right now, and whatever frame number it was on when they left the lunar surface to 143. Q? Oh, K. Mag Kilo, okay. Whatever frame they were on on the lunar surface to 143 were selected shots by the LMP. Frame 143 to 172 were near-side terminator photos of Ts i olkovsky.
|229:45:25|CC|Okay, Ron. We copy that right from the Flight Plan change.
|230:31:39|CMP|Okay. And PAN CAMERA to STEREO - Jack, ... help me get it. Verify STANDBY on STEREO. Okay , PAN CAMERA POWER coming ON. Oops, stand by here. Okay. V over H, HIGH ALTITUDE.
|230:31:59|CMP|Okay, PAN CAMERA to POWER. Okay, got the power. Okay, we've got a T-start coming up here at 24:07, 12 minutes. ... suppose that's what it should be ... yes, ... Let's see, Houston, America. I only have one pan camera pad here. Is that correct?
|230:31:59|CC|Let me see. We've got one sitting right in front of us for 233:40. Do you want that one?
|230:31:59|CMP|I don't have that one.
|230:31:59|CC|Yes.
|230:31:59|CMP|I've got the one that starts at 24:0? ana ends at 38:42.
|230:31:59|CC|That's correct, and you don't have the other one because we never said it. We've got here ready to go.
|230:31:59|CMP|Oh, okay.

|230:31:59|CC|Okay, T-start time, 233:48:15; T-stop is 234:00:30
|230:31:59|CMP|Okay, photo pad is - T-start is 233:46:15, T-ntop is 234:00:30.
|230:31:59|CC|Roger, Ron. And let me give you some words here that you might be interested in. Right now we're looking at probably pulling in those antenna at 233:45 or 46, right in that time frame. If those maneuvers - that should not work, we shall have to jettison the antennas at around 234:3 - 235:39. We have, and we won't give it to you until we need It. We have a VERB 49 maneuver to a jett attitude for 234:25, and that'll keep in that attitude and then we'll jettison the antennas at 235:43, and, of course, we'll have to bring up the logic power on those. We have this all available standing by and there's no sense passing it until we find out how the antennas do on RETRACT.
|230:31:59|CMP|Okay, that sounds reasonable. Do you have the, cr you want to use, the page in the Experiments Checklist there?
|230:31:59|CC|Roger. Except for the NOUN 78s. We'll change those.
|230:31:59|CMP|Oh, okay. Sounds good.
|230:31:59|CMP|It's in the Volkswagen pocket. Okay.
|230:36:05|CMP|I don't think we ever changed it though. Okay, the arrow's there, which indicates that ve didn't do it. Okay, LI0H canister change, 19 into A, take 17 and put it into A - A-4. That's correct.
|230:37:17|CMP|At 24, we want the pan camera.
|230:37:17|LMP|Bob, while we're waiting for the pun e user a , a quickie here. One of the ways that seems be useful for determining the relative age of he larger basins, to me anyway, is the abundance of block fields on the slopes of the walls or the slopes of the central peaks. That abundance decreasing with increasing age, and one of the comparisons that I just made that it looks as if Tsiolkovsky and Sklodowska have about the same abundance of - of block fields on both those features of the crater.
